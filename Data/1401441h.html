  <h2><a name="chap01"
     id="chap01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p>The same day, which saw our friends in the country house at Ostia, and the
  bond of love sealed between Aurelius and Claudia, had been one of infinite
  agitation and annoyance to the Emperor Domitian.</p>

  <p>The very first thing in the morning came vexatious tidings from the town
  and provinces. At the earliest dawn inscriptions had been discovered on
  several of the fountains, columns and triumphal arches, of which the sting
  was more or less covertly directed against the Palatium and the person of
  Caesar. "Enough!" was attached to the base of a portrait bust.<a href=
  "#1">1</a> "The fruit is ripe!" was legible on the Arch of Drusus. In the
  fourth, eighth and ninth regions the revolutionary question was to be seen in
  many places: "Where is Brutus?" and at the entrance of the baths of Titus, in
  blood-red letters, stared the appeal: "Nero is raging; Galba, why dost thou
  tarry?"</p>

  <p>Domitian, who had heard all this from his spies, long before the court
  officials even suspected what had happened, received these courtiers in the
  very worst of tempers. His lev&eacute;e was not yet ended, when a mounted
  messenger brought the news that a centurion had raised the standard of revolt
  on the Germanic frontier,<a href="#2">2</a> but that he had been defeated and
  slain after a short struggle.</p>

  <p>At noonday the soldiers of the town-guard seized an astrologer, Ascletario
  by name,<a href="#3">3</a> who had publicly announced that ruin threatened
  Caesar. Before the moon should have twelve times rounded&mdash;so ran his
  prophecy&mdash;Caesar's blood would be shed by violence. The immortals were
  wroth at his reprobate passion for a woman who, by all the laws of gods and
  men, he had no right to love.</p>

  <p>At first Domitian laughed. His connection with Julia seemed to him so dull
  and pointless a weapon for his foe to turn against him, that the stupidity of
  it astonished him. However, he commanded that the astrologer should be
  brought before him.</p>

  <p>"Who paid you?" he enquired with a scowl, when the prisoner was dragged
  into the room.</p>

  <p>"No one, my lord!"</p>

  <p>"You lie."</p>

  <p>"My lord, as I hope for the mercy of the gods, I do not lie."</p>

  <p>"Then you really assert, that you actually read in the stars the forecast
  you have uttered?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord; I have only declared, what my skill has revealed to
  me."</p>

  <p>The superstitious sovereign turned pale.</p>

  <p>"Well then, wise prophet, you can of course foretell your own end?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord. Before this day is ended, I shall be torn to pieces by
  dogs."</p>

  <p>Domitian looked scornfully round on the circle of men.</p>

  <p>"I fancy," he said, "that I can upset the prophetic science of this worthy
  man. Carry him off at once to execution, and take care that his body is burnt
  before sundown."</p>

  <p>The astrologer bowed his head in sullen resignation. He was led away to
  the field on the Esquiline, and immediately beheaded before an immense
  concourse; within an hour Domitian was informed that all was over. At this
  news his temper and spirit improved a little. He congratulated himself on the
  prompt decision, which had so signally proved the falsehood of the
  prophecy.</p>

  <p>At dinner he carried on an eager conversation with Latinus, the
  actor<a href="#4">4</a> who, among other farcical parts, filled the role of
  news- monger.</p>

  <p>"You are later than usual to-day," said Caesar graciously. "What detained
  you?"</p>

  <p>"A most laughable occurrence," replied the comedian. "By a mere chance I
  passed by the Esquiline. There, in the public field, an astrologer had just
  been executed. The dead body was still lying there, when a stranger came by
  with three huge dogs.<a href="#5">5</a> Before the slaves could prevent it,
  the three hounds had rushed upon the carcass and had torn it literally to
  bits. The dogs were killed at once with loud outcries; the owner had vanished
  completely. Immediately after, Clodianus came up to me and asked me if I had
  not seen the fellow, with a long red beard. One thing led to another, till
  your adjutant quitted me to make farther enquiries. I hastened hither and, as
  it was, arrived later than I ought."</p>

  <p>The narrator had not observed that every trace of color had faded out of
  the Emperor's cheeks. As he ceased speaking, Domitian sprang up and, without
  saying a word, rushed out of the triclinium and into his own apartments. An
  intolerable dread almost deprived him of breath;<a href="#6">6</a> he ran
  like a hunted deer from one room to another, now shaking his fists in
  impotent fury, and again stopping to look suspiciously round him on every
  side. In this wretched frame of mind he was found by Julia, who had been
  seriously ill ever since the return of Domitia. In spite of the Empress's
  commands, she had not yet quitted the palace. She came in, fevered and pale,
  to implore protection against her haughty rival, who had threatened to turn
  her into the street. The palace servants had tried to stop her at the
  entrance to Domitian's apartments, but she had thrust them aside with the
  strength of desperation. At the sound of footsteps Domitian started and
  turned round. She stood before him&mdash;young, lovely, wretched&mdash;the
  victim of his remorseless passion. But the sight of her, far from stirring
  his pity, roused him to foaming rage. Was it not she, the abandoned creature,
  who had brought down on him the wrath of the gods? Was it not for her sake,
  that his blood was to be shed, if the astrologer had prophesied truly? And he
  had prophesied only too truly! His own end had borne witness to the truth of
  his mission.</p>

  <p>"Hussy!" yelled the Emperor. "Have you come to mock me? Are you plotting
  to murder me, that you come sneaking round me? It is your doing, and no one
  else is to blame if Caesar perishes in his blood...! Go, serpent! This very
  day quit Rome, or I will have you flogged through the gates."</p>

  <p>The hapless girl drew herself up proudly.</p>

  <p>"This," she cried, "to crown my misery. Are you not satisfied with having
  betrayed my youth, and poisoned my innocence? Is this the compensation for a
  life of horror?"</p>

  <p>"Silence! It is a lie! It was your own vanity, that ruined you&mdash;your
  ambition, hoping to share a throne. Out of my sight, I say&mdash;you have no
  one to blame but yourself."</p>

  <p>"Miserable coward! Are you frightened by the forecast of a soothsayer?
  Well, your fate will overtake you; but not for my sake&mdash;no; for the sake
  of Rome!"</p>

  <p>"Go..." shrieked Domitian, "or I shall kill you!"</p>

  <p>"Well then, kill me. Add the crowning stroke to all your crimes! What do I
  care? I do not ask to stay in this world of misery and infamy, or in this
  proud Empire of Rome whose Emperor is an executioner."</p>

  <p>At this instant the slaves, who were waiting in the anteroom, heard a dull
  sound as of a blow or push, a piercing scream, and a heavy fall, and the next
  moment Domitian called out in a hoarse, choked voice: "Phaeton!" When the
  slave entered the room, Julia was senseless on the floor.<a href="#7">7</a>
  She was lying doubled up in a convulsed attitude, and her face was livid
  rather than pale.</p>

  <p>"Carry her away," said Caesar; "she is ill."</p>

  <p>The senseless girl was carried away, and that same day she died of an
  internal injury.</p>

  <p>Domitian spent a terrible night. In the course of the third vigil he sent
  an express to Norbanus, the general of the Praetorian Guard. For hours he sat
  up in torment on his couch, making his slaves sing to the lute. Now and again
  he asked for a weapon, or for drink, or sent all the attendants out of the
  room excepting Phaeton, his favorite slave, who was to bar the door, and
  guard it sword in hand.</p>

  <p>At last the day broke. It was Domitian's birthday, the 24th of
  October.<a href="#8">8</a> During the first hour after sunrise the usual
  ceremonious reception took place of magistrates, senators, and
  knights.<a href="#9">9</a> Outside the palace there was a scene of confusion,
  such as was rarely seen even in Rome. All the suburbs seemed to have emptied
  themselves, and the people to have converged on the Forum. Instead of one
  cohort of the Praetorian Guard, two had been posted on guard, and the
  sentinels at the palace gates were also doubled. The officials, whose
  business it was to check the admission of visitors, straightly enquired of
  each individual as he crossed the threshold of the audience chamber, whether
  he had any weapon about him. It was many years since this had last been done,
  and the effect was paralyzing.</p>

  <p>Domitian received the senators, not merely with reserve, but with evident
  repugnance, nor did he bestow on one of those who attended the customary
  honor of a kiss. A dull atmosphere of suspicion brooded like a vapor, and
  seemed to fill the splendidly-decorated room.<a href="#10">10</a> As the last
  visitors retired from the presence, it was rather like an escape or a flight.
  <i>Atra cura</i>, as sung by Horatius Flaccus,<a href="#11">11</a> seemed to
  have flung her dark robe over the palace.</p>

  <p>At last three men were left in attendance on the Emperor: Clodianus,
  Parthenius, the high-chamberlain, and Norbanus, the general of the Guard.
  This last was perhaps the only person, whom Domitian had received with
  politeness&mdash;indeed, so far as he was concerned, with marked attention.
  The tyrant, who, to every one else was cold and contemptuous, turned from
  time to time to the noble soldier with an engaging smile to assure him, half
  stammering, of his unaltered favor. The ruler of the world had altogether
  lost his command of himself.</p>

  <p>"And you have found no trace, formed no guess?" he asked with a frightened
  glance in the general's face. "Your efforts too, Clodianus, have been
  unsuccessful?"</p>

  <p>"Alas, my lord and god! I have offered great rewards, I have bribed dozens
  of idlers&mdash;all in vain; and to crown our ill-luck, when the slaves burnt
  the pile intended for the astrologer's body, they flung in, not merely the
  remains of Ascletario, but the dead hounds as well. Thus we lost the last
  clue to the discovery."</p>

  <p>"Let them be crucified! idiotic fools!" shrieked Caesar, trembling in
  every limb.</p>

  <p>"They richly deserve it," said Clodianus. "Still, I cannot comprehend the
  matter. The strange man, who suddenly appeared with the dogs, as suddenly
  vanished, as if the earth had swallowed him; and from among a knot of old
  women I heard a voice exclaim: 'It is Ahasuerus!'"</p>

  <p>"Ahasuerus!" shouted the Emperor, starting up. "Then have Ahasuerus
  advertised for."</p>

  <p>"Impossible," replied Clodianus. "Ahasuerus is a bogey creature of the
  Nazarenes, a restless spirit that wanders over lands and seas. I only
  mentioned the fact, to show you the impression produced by the apparition.
  There was something supernatural and appalling in his appearance..."</p>

  <p>Domitian was more agitated every moment; he paced the room excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Are all those infamous inscriptions torn down and wiped out?" he suddenly
  asked, addressing Parthenius.</p>

  <p>"Can you doubt it?... Why, the very morning dew, disgusted at the crime,
  did its best to wash them away."<a href="#12">12</a></p>

  <p>"Why did you not tell me of the inscription at the baths of Titus?"</p>

  <p>"My lord, you knew of it... "</p>

  <p>"From Latinus, who came to me at break of day."</p>

  <p>"My lord, I thought "</p>

  <p>"Silence. It was your duty to tell me the whole truth. Only by complete
  knowledge can an evil be met; a blind man falls into the pit."</p>

  <p>"My lord, if you desire it..." said Parthenius, laying his hand on his
  heart. Clodianus also bowed in sign of utter devotion, and his eye was
  positively radiant with fidelity and reverence&mdash;only on his full
  underlip there was the faintest possible twitch of self-satisfied irony.</p>

  <p>Again Domitian took to pacing the room, which was lined with mirrors. On
  every side he could see his pale, bloated face, here and there distorted and
  lengthened by some imperfection in the mirror. He shuddered.</p>

  <p>"I am ill, my faithful friends," he said in a low voice. "I need rest and
  quiet reflection&mdash;but the good of the Empire is paramount. Listen and
  perpend." He sat down and went on deliberately: "The times are perilous;
  treason lurks in every comer. Rome relies on Caesar; I must act. Terror alone
  can suppress treason, and I will strike terror into the traitors. The law
  against the Nazarenes is a good beginning, but it is merely a beginning. It
  only attacks the Catilines among the slaves and lowest class. We must go
  farther. We must strike at. Caesar's foes in the houses of the great and
  noble among the knights, and in the Senate. Numbers are suspected by us, and
  to be suspected is to deserve death. Our heart, in its tender mercy,<a href=
  "#13">13</a> has too often held our hand, but now the hour is come. In
  profound silence, but without delay, we must act&mdash;must strike the guilty
  with the swiftness and certainty of lightning. This very day vengeance must
  be planned. Once more, valiant Norbanus: how about the trustworthiness of
  your cohorts?"</p>

  <p>Norbanus bowed. "They are Caesar's&mdash;heart and soul and body."</p>

  <p>"The little gold Domitians have pleased the good fellows? Keep them warm,
  dear Norbanus, and if the two millions are not enough for you, say so without
  reserve. The soldiers, who protect my Empire, must learn to believe, that
  liberality sits on the throne of the Caesars."</p>

  <p>"Many thanks, my lord, but greater largesse might weaken discipline."</p>

  <p>"But the centurions?"</p>

  <p>"They are without exception strict and faithful. At a nod from me they
  would ride through fire and water."</p>

  <p>"Capital!" said Domitian with a bitter-sweet smile; for, without intending
  it, the general had given utterance to a painful sentiment, of which the
  Emperor had long been conscious: namely, that the Praetorian Guard would
  first obey their general, and at his orders only were devoted to their
  sovereign. This did not escape the keen insight of Clodianus, and again a
  subtle line of malicious satisfaction curled the lips of the man, who usually
  played the part of stolid honesty with the greatest success. As chance would
  have it, on this occasion the Emperor, looking up suddenly, caught the last
  quivering trace of this smile. He took no notice of it; he perhaps became a
  shade paler&mdash;but he turned to whisper to the prefect of the Guard.</p>

  <p>"Only let this cloud of disaffection and excitement pass over," he said,
  clapping him on the shoulder, "and, I promise you, Caesar will not forget
  you. Now, my fiiends, farewell, and await our commands."</p>

  <p>The general received a farewell kiss, and quitted the room.</p>

  <p>"What an age is this, by all the gods!" exclaimed Domitian, throwing up
  his arms. "To contend against the malice of the people, Caesar is forced to
  sacrifice the hours, which he owes to the happiness and welfare of the
  people. Woe is me, that the immortals should allow such things to happen! Up
  and to work then! That is the word."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he rose and, followed by Parthenius and Clodianus, he went
  into his private study. The chamberlain closed the door behind him; Phaeton
  was on guard in the anteroom.</p>

  <p>While the founder of the reign of terror thus yielded to an ill-concealed
  attack of panic, and already, in fancy, heard the roar of revolt, knocking
  with its blood-reddened sword at his palace gate, the reign of terror itself
  was lording it abroad, apparentiy more splendid and firmly based than ever.
  The doubled garrison had increased the popular feeling of the Emperor's
  might, and the calm, impressive solemnity, with which the terrible edict
  against the Nazarenes had been discussed and promulgated, seemed amply to
  prove how strong the throne felt itself, and how completely it was master of
  the situation. The numerous sacrifices which the prime mover of that piece of
  legislature, Titus Claudius Mucianus, had, in his function as Flamen, offered
  up to Jupiter, were both favorable and auspicious. The lower classes, who
  streamed in merry troops to the Circus Maximus, rejoiced over the gifts of
  corn and the gratification of their passion for a spectacle. The shouting and
  chanting processions of the priests of Bona Dea and of Isis added to the
  solemnity of the festival. Not a word of disaffection, not a discordant
  murmur was to be heard in this universal jubilation, which rolled in a mighty
  flood through the streets, markets, and public places. Sorrow and discontent
  are silent on such occasions. In the temple of Saturn a troop of blooming
  youths, wearing to-day for the first time the <i>toga virilis</i>,<a href=
  "#14">14</a> sang a high-flown festal ode, composed by Marcus Valerius
  Martialis. The inspired verse sounded out through the Forum, borne on the
  wings of a hundred youthful voices:</p>

  <p class="verse">"Hail! oh birthday of Caesar, day more bright and
  auspicious<br>
  Ev'n than the day when, on Ida, Rhea gave birth to Zeus<a href=
  "#15">15</a><br>
  Hail f and return more often than erst to Pylian Nestor,<a href=
  "#16">16</a><br>
  Ever as bright as to-day, or a thousand times more fair.<br>
  Many years yet may Caesar keep the feast of Minerva<a href="#17">17</a><br>
  Held on the Alban Hill; and confer the victor's wreath<br>
  Twined of oak-leaves, the prize to crown the worthiest singer.<br>
  Soon may he hallow the secular games with offerings and gifts!<br>
  Great is the boon we ask; but from the gods in heaven,<br>
  Such a boon is due to Caesar, the god upon earth."<a href="#18">18</a></p>

  <p>The melodious strain soared up from the temple of Saturn to the towering
  Palatium beyond.</p>

  <p>But he, to whom the homage was offered, heard it not. Shut up with
  Clodianus and Parthenius, he was writing down on a wooden tablet the names of
  those, whom he devoted to death.<a href="#19">19</a> Parthenius read them out
  in a low voice, and the Emperor assented; then the chamberlain wrote down
  another list of names, and again they were discussed in an undertone.
  Domitian's face meanwhile grew more and more like that of a jaguar, lurking
  in ambush to pounce on his prey.</p>

  <p>"And you, Clodianus," he whispered, almost inaudibly. "Do not you know of
  any reprobate wretch, who deserves to die?" He fixed his eye on the soldier's
  face.</p>

  <p>"No, my lord," said the adjutant. "It seems to me, that you have not
  overlooked one."</p>

  <p>"It is well. You will copy out the list&mdash;at once. The tablet I myself
  will keep. When Rome is saved, I will hang it up in the temple of
  Jupiter."</p>

  <p>Clodianus took his writing implements out of the folds of his tunic.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," the Emperor added with a meaning smile.&mdash;" Perhaps another
  name or two may occur to me." And he hid the strip of lime-wood in his
  bosom.</p>

  <p>"And now," he continued, "make your plans. I will not listen to anything
  till you can say to me: all is over; the deed is done. You know how
  cautiously, how warily you must proceed. Remember, your existence too is
  endangered; when a tree falls, the branches fall with it.&mdash;Go, my
  friends. If you triumph, I will endow you with power above all other mortals,
  and in splendor and honors you shall be equal with myself. I will name you my
  brothers."</p>

  <p>He sank exhausted on to a chair; Parthenius and Clodianus left the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes!" muttered Domitian between his teeth, as the door closed behind
  the two men; "one is yet wanting on the list of the elect!"</p>

  <p>He drew forth the tablet, and, with an indescribable grimace of hatred,
  wrote at the end of the long list of names: "Clodianus."</p>

  <p>"Wait awhile, my friend! This task you shall be allowed to
  finish&mdash;but then&mdash;it is not well, when a sapling grows too proudly
  skywards."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p>Early next morning Quintus made his way to the Flamen's house. The great
  sitting of the Senate, which was to determine the fate of the edict against
  the Nazarenes, had been fixed for this forenoon; until he should join it,
  Titus Claudius was spending the morning with his family. The weather was
  unusually mild for the late season, and Octavia had ordered that breakfast
  should be served in the peristyle, and here, comfortably extended on his
  couch, the high- priest was enjoying his favorite dish, fresh eggs with
  garum,<a href="#20">20</a> The ladies, attended only by Baucis and a little
  girl, were sitting in easy-chairs, sipping milk cooled with ice<a href=
  "#21">21</a> out of pale, gleaming Murrhine cups. Perfect silence reigned in
  the cavaedium; not even a slave stole across the marble flags, and the very
  tree-tops, golden in the morning sunshine, were motionless in the mild autumn
  air.</p>

  <p>As Quintus came in from the arcade, and saw this party of those who were
  near and dear to him, his heart sank within him. A longing, which even in his
  sleep had haunted, his dreams, and had driven him from his bed before
  daybreak, came over him now with almost irresistible force; his impulse was
  to throw himself at his father's feet, and kiss the hands that had so often
  rested lovingly on his head and brow. But he controlled himself. He went up
  to the high-priest, and gave him an affectionate kiss as usual, pressed his
  hand warmly, and then greeted the rest of the party gaily enough.</p>

  <p>The previous day Quintus had come to a conclusion which must open an
  impassable gulf between himself and his father. At the very time, when Titus
  Claudius was putting the finishing strokes to the great plan of attack
  against the Nazarenes, Quintus had made up his mind, that nothing less than
  the doctrine of that contemned sect could quench the thirst of his yearning
  soul. This consciousness had started into being suddenly, like a plant which
  springs up in a night; but the soil whence it made its way towards the light
  was&mdash;as we already know&mdash;ready long since, up-turned, as it were,
  by the ploughshare of doubt and dissatisfaction. The germ of his new views of
  life had long been slumbering as a dim craving, a longing, deep but aimless,
  for some saving certainty; it had needed no more than a fertilizing shower to
  develop it. Quintus was not disposed to bring a critical philosophy to bear
  on each of the various mysteries of the new faith, which, indeed, were as yet
  only known to him in part; but he grasped the kernel of the matter, and the
  more he investigated it, the deeper his conviction grew. The grand principle
  of the brotherly equality of all men, impressed him as strongly as the simple
  and yet consoling metaphysics of Christianity. To a naturally-creative
  imagination like his, the doctrine of an universal spirit embracing all time
  and space in sempiternal love was intrinsically clear and intelligible. He
  found in it the happy half-way term between the bewildering superstitions of
  popular belief and the cold abstractions of systematic philosophy. Added to
  this, was the ineffaceable impression made on his feelings by the high-souled
  nature of the wounded slave. The figure of Eurymachus shed a heavenly light
  on the source, whence he could have derived his invincible strength and lofty
  contempt of suffering and death.</p>

  <p>Late the evening before, Quintus had sought out old Thrax, and had told
  him that Eurymachus at last was safe. Then they had all sat together for a
  long time&mdash;Quintus, Thrax, Glauce, Euterpe, and Diphilus&mdash;and the
  old man had not wearied of talking of the carpenter's Son, of his wanderings
  through the land of Palestine, and the agonizing death he had suffered on the
  cross to redeem mankind. The impressive story of that life and passion, which
  has touched and stirred so many million hearts since, had an extraordinary
  effect on Quintus. And, in fact, Thrax told his story well; the glow of
  conviction seemed to sparkle from his eyes. His was not the calm inspiration
  of Eurymachus&mdash;it was the language of a vehement and excited nature, of
  a soul full of suppressed energy and enthusiasm; not John, who leaned on the
  bosom of Jesus, but Peter drawing his sword in passionate zeal.</p>

  <p>As Barbatus ceased speaking, Quintus started up, threw his arms round him,
  and exclaimed through his tears: "Receive me among you... I too, am one of
  you!"</p>

  <p>So it was agreed that Quintus Claudius, the son of the Flamen, Titus
  Claudius Mucianus, should, next day, be baptized, in a quarry not far from
  the river Almo.</p>

  <p>It was the thought of this privilege, and of the contradictory aspects of
  his position, which all through the night had pursued him in a thousand
  different forms, and now, in his father's hall, filled him with unutterable
  confusion. He felt that he must for a moment forget the abyss that lay
  between them, and once more hear his father's voice in loving tones, before
  their parting was an accomplished fact&mdash;forever.</p>

  <p>The sense of an imperative duty was added to this sentiment. He felt that,
  hoping against hope, he must, even at the eleventh hour, try to weaken his
  father's position.&mdash;The final details of the edict, he knew, were
  virtually in the Flamen's hands. The Senate had long been accustomed to vote
  for whatever the Emperor wished, without any alterations, and Titus Claudius
  spoke in Caesar's name. Domitian, amply satisfied of his representative's
  inexorable temper, had not even taken the trouble to look through the sketch
  of the edict; the whole tenor of the law, in fact, lay in the high-priest's
  hands.</p>

  <p>How gladly would Quintus have poured out his heart to his father, and have
  told him without reserve all that he held to be true, fair, and good! How
  willingly would he have gone up to him, and have said: "Caesar's government
  is groping in darkness; these Christians, whom you are condemning to
  destruction, are not criminals, but noble, virtuous, high-souled men&mdash;as
  noble, and virtuous, and high-souled as you yourself, father, who persecute
  them with such vindictive fury."</p>

  <p>But such boldness, alas! was out of the question; Quintus knew his father
  too well. He knew, that the rigid convictions of a mind like his were
  impervious to all that was new or strange, that even the logic of facts could
  only reach him by a long and circuitous route. His convictions had been the
  slow growth of years of unresting activity, and now they were
  immovable&mdash;a part of his very self. Thus Quintus had not the smallest
  doubt, that Titus Claudius, like a second Brutus, would not spare his own
  son, if duty, and paternal feeling should come into conflict. So it was not
  his own peril only, which dictated moderation and silence, but regard for his
  father's situation; and he never had felt a more tender reverence for him,
  than in this terrible hour. He could not speak as an adherent, nor even as
  &auml; defender of the persecuted creed; only as a looker-on from the point
  of view of abstract justice. In speech and in silence alike he must betray no
  impatience, and seem only to have acquired his more exact knowledge of the
  Christian creed by accident. He could do no more than represent the Nazarenes
  as harmless folks, who neither deserved persecution nor were worth the
  trouble.</p>

  <p>When he had taken his seat at the table by Lucilia, like a man who has
  time before him, he asked, throwing his head back and clasping his hands
  across his knee:</p>

  <p>"Well, father... and to-day is the last meeting?"</p>

  <p>"As you say," replied the high-priest.</p>

  <p>"I must confess, that the matter has remained almost unknown to me... I
  have been so absorbed in study, that I have hardly time to frequent the baths
  "</p>

  <p>"You are three-and-twenty, Quintus! When do you propose to take a proper
  interest in the great concerns of the Empire?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I generally follow them all with eager interest. It is only that
  just lately, at this moment..."</p>

  <p>"This is the very moment, when all who are well-affected ought to cling
  together and show their zeal in action."</p>

  <p>"It is said, that the decree you propose is excessively severe," said
  Quintus after a pause.</p>

  <p>"It will answer its purpose."</p>

  <p>"And will be issued unmodified?"</p>

  <p>"Why should good sound sense be modified?"</p>

  <p>"Well... opinions might differ."</p>

  <p>"They might, if the whole body of the Fathers<a href="#22">22</a> were men
  of the same stamp as that Cornelius Cinna... then sound sense would indeed be
  in danger!"</p>

  <p>"Cornelius Cinna is a man of keen judgment..."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand, that you should talk the language of the uncle of
  your betrothed; but, as I know him, he is devoid of all capacity for
  statesmanship. Now in this matter of the Nazarenes he has amply betrayed his
  want of judgment&mdash;I will call it so, since I should be loth to suppose
  that his opposition arises from mere personal aversion."</p>

  <p>"What?" cried Quintus astonished. "Cornelius Cinna takes the part of the
  Nazarenes?"</p>

  <p>"No, he does not take their part, but he does not regard them as
  dangerous. He laughs at them as visionaries and fools, who are no more to be
  held as reprobate, than the worshippers of Isis, or any other oriental sect.
  Mockery, contempt, are the only weapons worthy of a thinking man. When I
  pointed out to him, that the creed of the Nazarenes was undermining the
  religion of the state in a way which no other superstition had done, he dared
  to utter these audacious words: 'If your Olympus cannot take care of itself,
  it may crumble into dust.'"</p>

  <p>"The words, I admit, sound audacious enough," replied Quintus, looking his
  father in the face; "but they cover a truth nevertheless, which, it seems to
  me, cannot fail to be self-evident to the priest of Jupiter."</p>

  <p>"You think so? I can only tell you, that I see nothing of the sort. The
  rabble crowd of superstitious cannot, to be sure, destroy almighty Jupiter
  himself, but it can upset the belief in his divine rule. We may be deprived
  of our discernment of the truth, if a lie becomes paramount."</p>

  <p>"Why then do you not resist the belief in Isis?"</p>

  <p>"Because the religion of Isis has never dared to interfere in any way with
  that of the state. Besides, Isis is Juno; the name makes no difference. The
  symbol may vary&mdash;the essence remains untouched. You know, that even in
  my own house I have suffered Baucis..."</p>

  <p>"Oh! merciful Isis!" cried the old woman in alarm, "am I too to be dragged
  under the dreadful law? Why, how often have I been to Barbillus? Four, or at
  most five times&mdash;or six or seven..."</p>

  <p>"Hold your tongue, and leave us together," cried the priest angrily. "She
  is getting silly," he added, as Baucis vanished among the columns.</p>

  <p>"She is growing deaf," said Claudia in excuse. "Since our return from
  Baiae, I have had more to put up with every day."</p>

  <p>"You see I can be patient," Titus Claudius went on, addressing his son.
  "But in this instance we must take up arms against the attacks of a dangerous
  foe. The Nazarenes are working underground, day and night, like moles. Their
  passion for converts amounts to insanity; they are systematically undermining
  the state and society. I am determined to put a stop to these attacks. If we
  do not put our veto on them in time, we shall have a common porter on the
  throne of the Caesars, and all that wear the purple will be put to the sword.
  Some slave, whose sole employment till now has been to drag dead beasts to be
  buried, or carry plague-stricken wretches through the streets, will be
  sacrificing in the Roman Capitol as high-priest to the Nazarene! I know it
  all full well; there are unmistakable signs in the air. This, my dear
  Quintus, by the help of the gods, is what we must oppose, and I shall avail
  myself of the aid of all the terrors of the law. This very day it will be
  proclaimed to all men, that leniency is at an end: henceforth the punishment
  for the crime of belonging to the Nazarenes is death by wild beasts in the
  Arena."</p>

  <p>The blood faded from the young man's face; his heart stood still. He could
  not utter a word.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with you?" asked Titus Claudius startled. "You are
  pale trembling "</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," Quintus said with an effort. "I was only horrified at the
  severity of the measure. What? The disgraceful death of the vilest criminals
  hideous butchery for the amusement of the mob...? Father, impossible!"</p>

  <p>"It is necessary," replied the Flamen.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you. Is it necessary to punish with death a
  crime&mdash;which to me seems an error indeed, but a pardonable, a noble, a
  sublime error? Father, you do not know these persecuted people; you have
  never studied their doctrine; you cannot imagine how completely you are
  entangled in delusions about them. The Nazarenes are not rebels; they are
  quiet, duteous folk, who ask but one thing: to be allowed to worship their
  God. Their Master himself taught them: 'To render unto Caesar the things that
  are Caesar's.'"</p>

  <p>"Only a partisan of the sect could have poured such lies into your
  ear..."</p>

  <p>"I was, by accident, witness to a discussion," Quintus stammered out. "And
  I will pledge my life and honor as to the truth of what I have said!"</p>

  <p>"The truth!" laughed his father. "For the truth of your own view of the
  matter at most. By the gods, but I really do not understand how my son, of
  all men, should have come to be a defender of this accursed sect! However, be
  it so! I leave you the free exercise of your judgment; the course of events
  will soon rectify it. Meanwhile, you will perhaps allow me to carry out the
  line of action, which I have cautiously weighed with solemn appeals to my
  conscience."</p>

  <p>"Then you want to conjure the age of Nero from the grave?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my son. The age of Nero was not so bad, though the unbridled Caesar
  himself committed many crimes. His fight against the Nazarenes wipes out all
  scores."</p>

  <p>"Then you can praise him for having wrapped Nazarenes in tow and resin,
  and set fire to it?"</p>

  <p>"Those are mere foolish tales, invented by contemptible writers, who were
  at a loss for color in their pictures,"</p>

  <p>"What? Things that all the world knows; a fable!"</p>

  <p>"As you say."</p>

  <p>The blood mounted to the young man's brow.</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps you will say it is a fable, that Domitian&mdash;a second
  Nero&mdash;has killed his mistress by a kick?"</p>

  <p>"Who says so?" cried Titus Claudius starting up.</p>

  <p>"All Rome. You only, Father, seem to be ignorant of what has filled
  thousands with horror."</p>

  <p>"You heard it from Cinna."</p>

  <p>Quintus shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Be easy," the priest went on; "I have it from Parthenius, that Julia died
  of her long illness."</p>

  <p>"Parthenius!" laughed Quintus scornfully.</p>

  <p>"I am not justified in doubting his assertion, particularly in this
  instance, when it is in contradiction to such an impossible calumny. I myself
  have been intimate with Caesar long enough to know his calm nature, his
  equanimity, and self-command."</p>

  <p>"Yes, when he speaks to you; but every one knows that he wears a mask in
  your presence. You are, in fact, the only man in Rome, who can command his
  respect."</p>

  <p>"I should be a fool indeed to believe such a thing. I know full well, that
  hatred and calumny never sleep. The higher their prey, the more virulent is
  their attack. Beware, my son, of propagating such disgraceful reports; do not
  break the law which threatens the detractors of the sovereign with heavy
  punishment."</p>

  <p>"Then, to be a worthy citizen, I must choke the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Not the truth&mdash;only lies. The weeds have been allowed to grow too
  long, and now we must mow down the crop, which threatens to choke the good
  seed! Here comes the boy to tell us the time. In an hour the Senate meets.
  Let us enjoy the interval without vexing each other."</p>

  <p>"Then you persist in extreme measures? Every one who confesses the
  Nazarene must die?"</p>

  <p>"Without reprieve, be he slave or senator."</p>

  <p>Quintus was fighting an agonizing battle; his lips trembled, already
  parted to cry in despair to the inexorable judge: "Father, you are condemning
  your son to death!" but he controlled himself in time. He rose.</p>

  <p>"Farewell," he said in a low voice, and he held out both hands to his
  father. "I am very busy," he added in a steady voice. "Important
  business&mdash;you need not laugh, Lucilia&mdash;requires my return. Father,
  when it is your turn to speak in the Senate, remember your son&mdash;perhaps
  the thought may soften your heart; the Christians, too, whom you doom to
  death, are fathers' sons..."</p>

  <p>He rushed away. He was on the verge of tears, but he set his teeth and
  clenched his fist.</p>

  <p>"Oh! misery, misery!" he said to himself. "Father! Father! who could have
  foreseen this severance when I, as a boy, sat at your feet? Nay, quite
  lately, when you spoke to me so gravely!&mdash;How happy, how gay they all
  were; and he, so calm in the sense of doing his duty! If he only
  knew&mdash;it would kill him!"</p>

  <p>He hurried through the atrium, almost beside himself; Blepyrus, to whom he
  had only yesterday granted his pardon, was waiting there with others of his
  clients and slaves.</p>

  <p>His family looked after him in silence. Octavia was the first to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"It is strange," she said thoughtfully, "by all the gods, strange! What
  can have come over him? He always held the populace in such contempt."</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to count upon him," said Lucilia. "But this time, it
  seems to me, he is carrying his whim too far."</p>

  <p>"You are wrong," said her father sternly. "It was no whim that spoke in
  that mood of excitement, it was genuine enthusiasm. I have observed in him
  for some time, that this frame of mind has been growing to a height. It is
  the sacred fire of pity, which bums within him, a noble sentiment which
  discerns the man even in the criminal. He cannot comprehend, that the State
  must ignore all such sentiment^ if the commonwealth is not to suffer. His
  impulse is a foolish one, but I love him for it; and many a Roman maiden who,
  with thumbs turned down,<a href="#23">23</a> helps in condemning the stricken
  gladiator to the death-blow, might envy him his nobler soul!"</p>

  <p>The high-priest rose and walked two or three times up and down, past the
  fountain where the sparkling water now gleamed in the rising sun.</p>

  <p>"It is time to go," he said, standing still in front of his wife. "What a
  pity! It is a glorious morning, and I feel as if I had never so thoroughly
  enjoyed the rest and peacefulness of this peristyle. Perhaps it is only by
  contrast with the storms outside, that toss the vessel of state The sitting
  will be a long one, if only on Cinna^s account, who never will refrain from
  words, even when the struggle is a hopeless one. I shall be thankful if it is
  all over by supper-time. And&mdash;did I tell you?&mdash;Sextus Furius is to
  be our guest."</p>

  <p>Claudia colored.</p>

  <p>"He is welcome," Octavia said.</p>

  <p>"Oh! that odious man with a long-pointed nose!" cried Lucilia. "It is
  horrible always to have none but such weak-kneed old men at table with
  us."</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius was accustomed to allow considerable license to his adopted
  daughter's audacity, but such broadly-expressed contempt was beyond all
  permissible measure.</p>

  <p>"Lucilia!" he exclaimed almost angrily. "You sometimes allow yourself
  jests, which seem to me positively silly. Remember&mdash;do you hear
  me?&mdash;many follies, which we forgive in a child, sound shocking when
  uttered by the lips of a young woman. How dare you make any guests of mine
  the subject of your mockery? Sextus Furius is an honorable man, wise,
  experienced, and worthy of all respect. If his outward man is not altogether
  that of the fine gentlemen, who swarm and buzz from morning till night round
  the dressing- chairs and litters<a href="#24">24</a> of fine ladies, in my
  eyes, at least, that is to his advantage."</p>

  <p>"My dear, good, little father," said the criminal, "do not take a
  thoughtless speech so seriously; I cannot bear to hear you speak to me so
  ungraciously&mdash;and your eyes are not so kind and sweet as usual, and here
  on your forehead&mdash;just here&mdash;there is an ugly line that makes you
  look so much older..."</p>

  <p>She threw her round, rosy arms round his neck, and stroked his cheek
  lovingly.</p>

  <p>"Come, be kind again to your little girl&mdash;and I will declare that
  your long-nosed&mdash;oh! I forgot&mdash;your excellent friend, Sextus
  Furius, is delightful." Titus Claudius gently released himself; he could not
  help smiling.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to scold you, you little imp," he Said shaking his head.
  "I am afraid I spoil you."</p>

  <p>And he once more glanced up at the blue sky, as though he grudged having
  to exchange the airy peristyle for the senate-house. Then, waving them a
  farewell, he went off to his own rooms.</p>

  <p>"But he is a perfect horror, all the same," Lucilia repeated, when her
  father was out of hearing. "I can tell you. Mother dear, I could not kiss him
  for a thousand millions, much less marry him! And is this long-nosed, weak-
  kneed creature to be the husband of our Claudia?"</p>

  <p>"Silence, silly child," said Octavia with affected severity. "Your
  father's will is our law. He has his own reasons for whatever he decides
  on."</p>

  <p>"You are only making believe," said Lucilia. "You know you like him no
  better than I do, and you, too, grieve over the odious fancy..."</p>

  <p>"Lucilia!"</p>

  <p>"Well... is one to bite one's tongue out simply from respect of persons?
  My father often has fancies. What should Claudia have to do with that wooden
  simpleton? And he is as cowardly as a whimpering woman! Cornelia told me
  so&mdash;she heard it from her uncle."</p>

  <p>"It is not every one, that has the headstrong spirit of Cinna."</p>

  <p>"A Scythian, who simply cut down all before him, his wife into the
  bargain, rather than a milksop, that you can knock down with a feather!"</p>

  <p>"You know nothing about it, child. But where is Claudia? Why has she left
  us?"</p>

  <p>"She has gone to her own room, I daresay, to cry there. Since yesterday,
  when my father told her of his determination, she has practised such complete
  self-control, that her grief must have its way at last."</p>

  <p>But Lucilia was mistaken. Claudia had followed her father, and went into
  his room close on his heels.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked in surprise, seeing his daughter stand before
  him, pale, calm, and stately.</p>

  <p>"I have a confession to make to you, which has been on my lips ever since
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Well?" said the high-priest, hardly attending.</p>

  <p>"Send away the servants."</p>

  <p>"Child, I have no time now for any discussions; in twenty minutes..."</p>

  <p>"I will not detain you." The Flamen signed to the slaves, who disappeared
  with an enquiring glance at the young girl's unusually serious face and
  manner.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;what have you to say?" he asked, when they were alone.</p>

  <p>"Father," said Claudia in a low, but resolute tone, "I cannot marry Sextus
  Furius."</p>

  <p>"Folly!"</p>

  <p>"It is not folly&mdash;it is as I say."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! and why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because I do not care for him."</p>

  <p>"An excellent reason! Why, you hardly know him; try first to understand
  his worth."</p>

  <p>"I solemnly assure you it is quite in vain. My heart is given away&mdash;I
  love Caius Aurelius Menapius."</p>

  <p>"What!" cried the priest sternly. "A provincial, a man of no birth or
  family!"</p>

  <p>"He is a Roman knight."</p>

  <p>"A knight&mdash;and who is not a knight now-a-days? A man is a knight if
  he is anything but a laborer or a slave. Besides, is not his mother descended
  from some barbarian tribe?"</p>

  <p>"From the tribe, that could conquer Varus."</p>

  <p>"So much the worse. It grieves me to have to tell you, that I will never
  submit to such a vagary."</p>

  <p>"But let me ask you one thing: do you not esteem Caius Aurelius?"</p>

  <p>"You know I do. From the first I have thought most highly of him. But, by
  Jupiter! To regard him as my guest is one thing&mdash;as a suitor for my
  daughter's hand is quite another!"</p>

  <p>"Father, if you part me from Caius Aurelius, I shall never be happy again.
  He has my promise."</p>

  <p>Her tone, and, yet more, the sparkle in her eyes betrayed such settled
  determination, that the high-priest was staggered. The thought flashed upon
  him that, after all, not everything in the world could be calculated by the
  inexorable laws of logic; the possibility of Claudia's choosing for herself
  he had never taken into consideration. And now this possibility&mdash;nay,
  actuality&mdash;stood before him so pressingly, in the form of a pair of
  tearful, suppliant eyes, that he at once lost his grasp of the situation. As
  for Claudia herself, her forced calmness was fast giving way before the storm
  of excitement, which shook every fibre of her slender frame.</p>

  <p>"Claudia, my darling," stammered the Flamen, clasping his child in his
  arms, "you are trembling and tearful; but come, come, be reasonable. There,
  lay your head on my shoulder, and tell me, calmly and without tears, what is
  troubling your heart? I am your father, my child, and not a tyrant. Do you
  hear, my Claudia?"</p>

  <p>She looked up like a flower after a thunder-shower&mdash;a radiance of a
  grateful smile lighted up her features.</p>

  <p>"You are so good!" she said, tenderly. "Forgive me, if I cannot help
  causing you trouble."</p>

  <p>"Speak, my child; tell me everything. But, no; for the present leave me.
  You are agitated, and time presses. We will talk it all over&mdash;this very
  evening.&mdash; Just now I have not leisure&mdash;I belong to my country.
  Meanwhile I must ask you one thing: do not be too abrupt with Sextus Furius.
  Promise me that, dear Claudia."</p>

  <p>"With all my heart."</p>

  <p>She kissed her father eagerly and left the room.</p>

  <p>"No," said the priest half-aloud, "she must not and shall not be unhappy.
  I never before saw her like this; that anguish came from the bottom of her
  heart. I know her; I understand her! The dignity of my name! Yes, it is dear
  to me, and sacred as a gift bestowed by the gods&mdash;but at that price!
  Never. My heart swelled as she clung to me, crying in my arms. And yet what a
  joy to me, in spite of sorrow! Ah, my children! how you have grown to be part
  of my very soul! Every life-throb of my heart is doubled by your lives! I
  thank Thee, all-merciful giver, for so precious a blessing&mdash;every cloud
  of incense, that rises from thine altar, wafts up my fervent thanks to thy
  throne!"</p>

  <p>For a few minutes he stood absorbed in thought; then he called his slaves
  to dress him.</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later Titus Claudius was at the temple of Jupiter
  Capitolinus, where the Senate was to sit.</p>

  <p>Almost all the Fathers had met on this occasion. Here sat Nerva, a noble
  and reverend figure, mild, but majestic as Jove; there, bending over his
  rolled book and writing tablets, sat Cornelius Cinna, the chief opponent of
  the proposed law; there again sat Sextus Furius, shy and hesitating, but in
  earnest discussion with his neighbor, evidently endeavoring to display a
  feverish anxiety that the new decree should be passed. On every side were
  snow-white togas, grave and dignified faces, a strangely-excited air of
  suspense. The scribes&mdash;the writers of protocols&mdash;sat at tables
  prepared to write, while at the entrances stood the lictors<a href=
  "#25">25</a> with their axes and fasces.</p>

  <p>The presiding magistrate&mdash;on this occasion a praetor, no doubt
  because the consul, Titus Flavius Clemens, was suspected of secretly favoring
  the Nazarenes, or even of having joined the sect&mdash;pronounced the sitting
  opened."<a href="#26">26</a> He briefly set forth the occasion of the present
  meeting, and explained to the assembled worthies the main features of the
  edict, as drawn up by Titus Claudius.</p>

  <p>When these preliminary statements&mdash;known as the
  <i>relatio</i><a href="#27">27</a> had been got through, the collecting of
  votes began with the usual formula addressed to each senator: "<i>Quid
  censes?</i>"&mdash;"What thinkest thou?"</p>

  <p>As almost every member present declared his assent without hesitation, and
  some with servile cordiality, in hardly more than a quarter of an hour it
  came to Cinna's turn to express his opinion.</p>

  <p>He rose slowly. His by no means remarkable stature seemed to grow from the
  sheer calm dignity of the man. His eye glanced contemptuously round at the
  assembled multitude and rested, at length, on the grave face of Titus
  Claudius Mucianus. Then, in clear and audible tones, he began to contest the
  proposed measure which, in his opinion, was unworthy of the Roman name. It
  was a brilliant and memorable effort of political eloquence. At the same time
  his discourse was not framed on the ordinary models in any respect, it was
  not with the arid wisdom of a statesman that he spoke&mdash;no, it was the
  biting lash of the satirist that he wielded&mdash; the fiery invective of
  epigram, that gave glow to his words. There was not a province of human
  knowledge so recondite, that his subtle mind had not drawn upon it for
  drastic similes and ironical comparisons.</p>

  <p>"Will you nail flies to the cross," he exclaimed in a voice of thunder,
  "erect cranes and levers to lift a straw over a wall? Send me a hundred
  cohorts to my country-house; a mole-hill has been discovered there! Give me
  shears and scythes and a couple of wagons; I want to cut a rose-bud at
  Praestum! Reef the sails, captain, the fair Lycoris is about to sneeze! You
  are really inimitable, you stern guardians of morals and most sapient
  defenders of the immaculateness of the State! Punish the sparrows, if you
  please; one of those traitorous villains but just now soiled my cloak. Away
  with the wretch to the field of blood! If you do not at once take steps, the
  Senate and the whole Roman people will be buried alive by cock-sparrows."</p>

  <p>After thus gibbeting the measure as absolutely superfluous, petty and
  ridiculous, from the point of view of any cultivated and philosophical mind,
  he followed up his statement to its logical issues.</p>

  <p>"This decree," he cried, turning towards Titus Claudius, "condemns the
  Nazarenes, because they regard the gods of the populace as unreal&mdash;as
  mere idols of the fancy. Well! And is it the right or the duty of the State
  to take under its control any such matters of personal conviction? Where
  would you draw the line, ye assembled Fathers? Do you not perceive, that you
  are throwing away the last fragments of our liberties, if you assent to this
  law? What? You will kill the Nazarenes? Then you are equally bound to crush
  all, who refuse to acknowledge the love passages of Mars and Rhea Silvia as
  facts! And again I say, where do you draw the line? How far does the duty of
  a staunch citizen extend? Must an Athenian, for instance, give due guarantee,
  that he accepts the historical reality of Leda's eggs? Is he required to
  believe in Danae's golden shower, in Sisyphus<a href="#28">28</a> and his
  tormenting labor with the marble mass that forever rolls downwards? Nay,
  noble Fathers! Nothing like this has ever yet been heard of in Rome. Never
  yet has the State ventured to put forward any article of faith as a test and
  standard, and require every Roman citizen to be persuaded of its truth or
  lose his rights and privileges. What is the meaning of our old, beautiful and
  truly Latin word '<i>religio</i>'?<a href="#29">29</a> Nothing more than the
  holy dread, the heartfelt reverence of man before a higher power; but what
  that higher something may be, it contains no indication. It is left to each
  individual, to conceive of an idea which may satisfy his own soul and
  intellect. The measure now before you will drag this religion from the depths
  of men's souls into the public street, as it were, in defiance of the
  original deep-felt sense of the word, and of the spirit of our traditions and
  customs; it will create a State-religion, and condemn every man's opinions to
  wear at least the same livery. Assembled Fathers! Such a decree as this means
  ossification&mdash;spiritual ossification&mdash;of the age we live in, and
  for this, if for no other reason, it should be thrown out!"</p>

  <p>He paused; a dull, uneasy silence filled the room. The senators sat in
  consternation at the unheard-of audacity of the. man, who could dare to defy
  Caesar's omnipotence with such disinterested liberality.</p>

  <p>"He is uttering his own death-warrant," whispered Sextus Furius. Gradually
  a low murmur arose and swelled by degrees.</p>

  <p>"Have you done?" asked the President, seeing that Cornelius Cinna gave no
  sign of resuming his seat.</p>

  <p>"Allow me a few words more," replied Cinna. "Do not be afraid that my
  intention is merely to postpone your decision by digressions.<a href=
  "#30">30</a> I only want to touch on one other point, which has perhaps
  escaped the notice of the noble Fathers. This law, which in accordance with
  my every conviction I feel bound to oppose, not only threatens to cripple the
  public mind; it will destroy all the peace and happiness of family life.
  Tale- telling and dishonorable espionage, to a very grave extent, will be the
  inevitable outcome&mdash;and of these, as it is, Rome needs no increase! A
  law, which offers a prize, as it were, to the informer&mdash;such a law, I
  say, is death to the morality and mutual confidence of the people. I have
  warned you! Do not calmly lend a hand in forging a weapon, which threatens
  thousands of peaceful citizens with death. Can you foresee, that no
  conditions will arise to turn its point, even against yourselves? You are
  masters of the cast only so long as the spear is in your own hands. Assembled
  Fathers, I am convinced that you will unanimously reject this measure which,
  on one hand, is superfluous and undignified, and, on the other, to the last
  degree dangerous&mdash;reject it, I say, to the honor and glory of the name
  of Rome!"</p>

  <p>The impression made by this speech&mdash;which derived from the dignified
  presence, the sonorous voice and the impressive manner of the speaker an
  importance far beyond the mere meaning of the words&mdash;was so profound,
  that it fanned into brief flame the few sparks of the old Roman spirit, which
  still lurked here and there in the assembly. Shouts of approbation were
  audible on both sides. For a moment the grave features of Titus Claudius wore
  an expression of anxiety. But the cries of assent were few and scattered. On
  any other occasion Cornelius Cinna would have triumphed, but now only one
  voice could gain a hearing&mdash;the voice of fear. The effect of its
  eloquence was visible as the next names were called; the members announced,
  not without hesitation, that there was much in Cinna's discourse "which was
  amply justified, but that they must nevertheless cast their votes in favor of
  the decree, particularly as they felt assured that Titus Claudius, the real
  originator of the measure, would only have acted on a perfect knowledge of
  the state of affairs, and after the maturest deliberation. And indeed, the
  motives which the Flamen had assigned on former occasions, had by no means
  been nullified by Cornelius Cinna,</p>

  <p>When four or five speakers had expressed themselves to this effect, in
  feeble and colorless language, it was the turn of Titus Claudius Mucianus
  himself. He rose with the lofty indifference of a man, who no longer has a
  doubt of the triumph of his cause. He abstained, almost too evidently, from
  all rhetorical effects. In a cold and strictly business-like address he
  recapitulated the points from which the government viewed the measure.
  Cornelius Cinna, he said, was entirely wrong, if he thought that its object
  was to fetter liberty of thought and belief. The whole matter bore a simply
  political aspect in the eyes of the government. He thanked the eloquent
  speaker, who had thrown so much light on the subject from the other side;
  such a dissertation always tended to enlightenment. At the same time, he
  hoped that the assembled Fathers would allow themselves to be guided rather
  by the force of solid argument, than by the dazzling light of a brilliant
  oratorical display. Then, step by step, he proceeded to demolish Cinna's
  assertions, and it was with special emphasis, that he combatted the idea that
  the new law would conduce to espionage and informing; the measure&mdash;as
  the most superficial glance could detect&mdash;contained nothing to arouse
  suspicion on that score. Cornelius Cinna had altogether misunderstood its
  tendency. The speaker ended with a short but striking picture of the danger
  to society, which it was proposed to guard against, and appealed to the
  assembled Fathers, in the words of the old Roman text of warning: "Be on your
  guard, lest the Fatherland should suffer!"<a href="#31">31</a></p>

  <p>A thunder of applause filled the temple. The remaining senators renounced
  all expression of opinion, and the Praetor proceeded to collect the votes by
  a show of hands.<a href="#32">32</a> The measure was passed against a
  minority of six. The exhausted senators rose and made their way
  homewards&mdash;only just in time for the usual supper-hour.</p>

  <p>Quintus Claudius supped late and alone. He had spent the whole day in
  solitude in his room; gloomy and anxious forebodings tortured his soul. He
  eat but little, and then again withdrew&mdash;not even Blepyrus was admitted
  to his apartments. At about the beginning of the second vigil, Quintus threw
  on his toga and went out slowly into the moonless night. After a long walk he
  reached the coppice on the bank of the Almo, where Euterpe and Diphilus were
  waiting for him. An hour later the deed was done. Quintus was baptized by the
  eldest member of the congregation of Nazarenes.</p>

  <p>It was nearly midnight, when he took his way homewards. The endless Appian
  Way was silent as he turned into it, and silent too was the busy city. It was
  not till he reached the Flavian Amphitheatre, that he met any stir of life.
  There, standing by the fountain of the Meta Sudans, was a group of men,
  talking eagerly. They were discussing the event of the day&mdash;the edict
  just published against the Christians.</p>

  <p>"There will be heaps and heaps of arena fights," cried one; "the Subura
  swarms with Nazarenes."</p>

  <p>"Let them have it!" said another. "The last wild-beast fight was the most
  wretched affair; and when I sit there, in my newly-bleached toga,<a href=
  "#33">33</a> blood is what I want!"</p>

  <p>"Merciful Lord Jesus Christ!" murmured Quintus. "From this hour my only
  God! To Thy keeping I commend my life. And ah! protect him&mdash;that dear
  father, who never dreams how fearful is the darkness that shrouds his sight.
  Preserve him&mdash;my dear, dear father; and forgive him, O God&mdash;him and
  his fellows&mdash;for they know not what they do."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap03"
     id="chap03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p>DOMITIAN had not been present at the meeting of the Senate. He had gone to
  sleep late, and, not waking till long after sunrise, he remained in bed to
  receive his chamberlain, Parthenius, who came to announce to him that the
  plan of campaign against the proscribed sect was fully laid and ratified.
  This news entirely restored Caesar's lost composure, and he came to breakfast
  in the best humor possible.</p>

  <p>His spirits rose still higher, when Parthenius reported the results of his
  overtures to Barbillus. The priest of Isis had expressed himself ready to
  meet the Emperor's wishes for a consideration of ninety thousand denarii. His
  co-operation was not to be had cheaper, since Barbillus had a tender
  conscience, and could not risk the wrath of Isis, the all-powerful, for
  less.</p>

  <p>Domitian rubbed his hands, and a hideous, leering smile stole over his
  sallow face. His eyes sparkled scornfully under his lowering brow.</p>

  <p>"By Cypris! a sly fox is this Barbillus! And will he pledge his word that
  the shy nymph?"</p>

  <p>"Do not be uneasy, my lord. Barbillus has planned such a piece of
  bewildering magic to play, that she will lose her head. You are to appear
  before her, mysteriously illuminated and with lightning flashing round you,
  in the form of the hawk-headed god, Osiris.<a href="#34">34</a>&mdash;All
  sorts of mystical effects are to be introduced.&mdash;Rely upon it, my lord,
  she is yours, if ever a mortal woman was conquered by an immortal god."</p>

  <p>"You have done well!" cried Caesar, enchanted. "How our noble Cinna would
  writhe, if he could know... These conjurors are inexhaustible with their
  ingenious tricks. The strange thing is, that so much truth creeps in among so
  many lies. Who was it, that told you that Barbillus is a master of
  astrology?"</p>

  <p>"Sextus Furius, to whom he foretold his brothers* death."</p>

  <p>"I remember... and the prophecy was verified?"</p>

  <p>"To the very hour. The two men were in Gaul at the time, and no one here
  knew that they were ill. The elder died on the ides of February, and the
  younger two days later."</p>

  <p>Caesar's face clouded, and he cast a sinister glance at Parthenius. Could
  it, indeed, be that the chamberlain did not know he was speaking
  treason?&mdash;could he so utterly have forgotten, what had happened to the
  soothsayer Ascletario? Domitian had expected a denial from the courtier, not
  a confirmation of the facts. Truly, even Parthenius, it would seem, had
  ceased to care for his sovereign's favor! Even he was growing audacious and
  reckless.</p>

  <p>Domitian involuntarily felt for the little wooden tablet which lay under
  his pillow; but Parthenius met his eye with a look of such perfect innocence,
  that Domitian felt a qualm of remorse. He held out his hand to the
  chamberlain and said, with an effort to be amiable:</p>

  <p>"Thank you, my friend; your information will be useful. I have not yet
  decided whether I will appear at table, or indeed leave my rooms at all. But,
  in any case, do you be here in good time for the precious divine comedy in
  the evening."</p>

  <p>"As my sovereign commands."</p>

  <p>"Listen&mdash;stop!" cried Caesar, as Parthenius was going. "To-day, you
  know, Julia, my late brother's daughter, is to be buried..."<a href=
  "#35">35</a></p>

  <p>"I know, my lord!"</p>

  <p>"Well... I forgot to say... her ashes are to be carried to the temple of
  the Flavia family;<a href="#36">36</a> the dignity of our race requires it. I
  beg of you to omit nothing, that is due to the Manes of the illustrious
  dead&mdash;such as Julia. I would have the people know and tell each other,
  how Domitian honors the daughter of the divine Titus."</p>

  <p>"I understand."</p>

  <p>And Parthenius went.</p>

  <p>"I will watch him," said Domitian to himself. "If he too... No torture
  would be too severe for such a breach of faith Folly! His fate is so
  inseparably bound up with mine, that my fall must bring him down too."</p>

  <p>He slowly raised himself from the pillow, leaning on his right hand, and a
  slight shudder ran through him; he was cold. "The consequence of yesterday's
  excitement," he said to himself, drawing the coverlet closer round him. By
  Castor, but it is becoming absurd. Always the same fabric of the
  brain&mdash;that foolish, hideous figure, with its ghastly face and gaping
  wound!" And he pressed his hand over his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is ridiculous. Must everything on earth repeat itself? Nero, gory
  shade, I laugh you to scorn! Have I waded in blood? Have I set the immortal
  city in flames, and struck my lyre while the people howled in anguish? Have I
  murdered my own mother? Nay&mdash; I am a mild and merciful sovereign.
  Compared with Nero&mdash;a child, a lamb, a dove! Away! Why stand grinning at
  me there, horrid vision? You have long been dust and ashes.&mdash;Vanish, go,
  or I will strangle you!"</p>

  <p>He groaned and sank back on his cushions. His eyes were closed, but his
  hands were stretched out, stark, as if convulsed; his breath came hard and
  quickly, and his livid lips never ceased moving.</p>

  <p>"It is he, it is he..." he stammered, sitting up again. "I see him,
  barefoot, his mantle torn, riding towards Phaon's house.<a href=
  "#37">37</a>&mdash;I hear the shouts of the soldiers in the camp close
  by.&mdash;They are cursing him.&mdash;His horse has shied&mdash;he is looking
  round&mdash; the Praetorians know his pale face.&mdash;Now he has leaped from
  his saddle, and is hiding in the bushes.&mdash; How he gasps! How thirsty he
  is&mdash;he is stooping over a puddle to drink!&mdash;They have reached the
  villa; there&mdash;he is trembhng, his knees give way.&mdash;Here is a
  messenger from Rome bringing Phaon the news&mdash;the decision of the Senate.
  Traitors! Treason! Death by the hand of the executioner.&mdash;Hark!
  Horses!&mdash; the soldiers are coming out to take him.&mdash;Come, more
  merciful steel, and pierce this throbbing heart. Kill him, murder him, tear
  him limb from limb!&mdash;It is over, there he lies, stiff on his cloak, his
  eyes starting out of their sockets. His face is as pale as ashes.&mdash; Thus
  dies Nero!&mdash;Alas! and woe is me! Thus dies Domitian!"</p>

  <p>A loud and piercing shriek; then the silence of the grave.</p>

  <p>"Help, help!" cried the boy, who was on guard in the cubiculum.
  "Help&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>It was Phaeton, Caesar's favorite slave; he rushed forward to lift up the
  Emperor, who lay like one dead. His left arm hung helplessly over the edge of
  the bed; he had pushed aside his pillows, and with them, his wooden tablet
  which, as Phaeton pulled the cushions into place, fell with a clatter on to
  the floor. The lad stooped and picked it up, only just in time to save it
  from being trodden on by the other slaves, who came rushing in from all
  sides. He instinctively hid the piece of wood in his tunic. A moment later
  and the physician came in, who at once dismissed all unnecessary attendants,
  among them Phaeton, who was still trembling from the shock. Caesar, he said,
  must have absolute rest.</p>

  <p>Phaeton, however, lingered; he wanted to know whether Caesar's life was in
  danger, and it was not till the leech had reassured him on that point, that
  he was persuaded to quit the room and remain in the cavaedium close at hand.
  There he went to the south-western entrance, where two of the Praetorian
  Guard were keeping watch in shining armor. He sat down, squatting on the
  mosaic pavement,, near a door which commanded a view over the Aventine. For a
  time he stared vacantly at the tall, stiff figures with their dazzling
  helmets and their calm, stem, weather-beaten faces. Then, with a yawn, he
  idly drew forth the wooden tablet. He could not read, and his eye wandered
  curiously down the close rows of curling or angular letters, which to him
  were signs far more mystical than the old Hebrew rolls of manuscripts, which
  he had seen his mother read. Then he fell to balancing the little board on
  his fingers, trying to support it on one comer, as he had seen Masthlion, the
  famous juggler do, out on the Field of Mars.</p>

  <p>At this moment the heavy tread of Clodianus was heard approaching.<a href=
  "#38">38</a> He had been requested by the chamberlain to visit the room where
  Julia was lying dead. The boy, with a dim sense of wrong-doing in thus
  playing tricks with the property of his imperial master, hastily hid the
  tablet in his tunic again. But the very promptness with which he did so
  attracted the adjutant's attention.</p>

  <p>"What are you hiding there?" he asked, beckoning the lad to him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, my lord&mdash;a little board..." stammered Phaeton. "Our lord
  and god is ill&mdash;he fainted; the bit of wood fell on the ground "</p>

  <p>"Show it to me." The boy obeyed, trembling, for the adjutant's voice had a
  growl in it of distant thunder. At the court of the Roman Emperor any one
  might, at any moment, happen to offend the majesty of Caesar beyond all
  forgiveness. The quaking youngster fully expected that the next words he
  should hear would be: "Go, and be soundly flogged!" or even worse. What then
  was his surprise when Clodianus, who on first glancing at the tablet had
  frowned darkly, suddenly lost his expression of angry defiance, and looked
  anxiously round at the sentinels.</p>

  <p>"Have they seen this?" he asked, drawing the lad aside.</p>

  <p>"No, my lord."</p>

  <p>"Where did you find this tablet?"</p>

  <p>"It was lying under the great sovereign's pillow."</p>

  <p>"And you stole it?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, my lord. It fell out, when Caesar lost consciousness."</p>

  <p>"Caesar is sick, then?"</p>

  <p>"I said so before. He screamed as if an asp had stung him; then he
  fainted. The leech says there is no danger "</p>

  <p>"Let us hope so, let us hope so.&mdash;Did any one see you pick up this
  little tablet?"</p>

  <p>"No, my lord."</p>

  <p>"Listen, then, to what I tell you. Replace it as soon as possible, and
  secretly.&mdash;Mark me well, very secretly&mdash;exactly where it was. If
  any one finds out that you brought it out here, you are a dead man&mdash;I
  mean well by you, Phaeton."</p>

  <p>"Oh! my lord, if I could have dreamed that I was committing a
  crime..."</p>

  <p>"Be silent, and do as I bid you. By our conquering eagle! I am not one of
  those, who make an outcry about every little stupid thing. An old soldier is
  not prone to tale-telling&mdash;only do not betray yourself."</p>

  <p>"How have I deserved so much kindness?" said the poor boy, kissing the
  wily courtier's hand. "Perhaps I could slip into the room again now..."</p>

  <p>"You can but try, my boy; and for the future take care what you do. Things
  that Caesar thinks fit to hide under his pillow, are not meant for the eyes
  of others, you may be sure. Do not forget that."</p>

  <p>The lad went; Clodianus looked after him, nodding his head as he said to
  himself: "A most fortunate chance! You write a plain hand, Caesar! I have
  seen this coming for some time. You insist on having none but foes, great
  potentate! No confederates! Well&mdash;I can but try to play the part."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Domitian had recovered from his swoon. An overwrought mind, the
  physician said, and anxiety for the weal of his beloved Romans had reduced
  the Father of his country to this condition; escape from all business,
  amusement, and enjoyment of every kind, were the only means of avoiding a
  recurrence of the attack. Domitian accepted this diagnosis with favor. The
  external application of Vesuvian wine, and a few mouthfuls of the strongest
  Samian, which he swallowed eagerly, had entirely restored his vigor; he did
  not even feel so languid as usual. He spent another hour in bed, by the
  leech's advice, and then he allowed himself to be dressed, and ordered his
  litter. Just as he was quitting the room he remembered the tablet; he
  hastened back and raised the pillow. There it lay&mdash;the register of
  death. He put it in his bosom.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" he said, turning sharply on Phaeton, who was
  standing by, pale and frightened.</p>

  <p>"Whatever my lord and god may command."</p>

  <p>"Then order Narcissus to wait in the cubiculum,<a href="#39">39</a> and do
  you come with me."</p>

  <p>Phaeton breathed once more. He obeyed with the swiftness of the wind.</p>

  <p>The Emperor passed the hours till supper-time in one of the vast
  pleasaunces on the top of Mons Janiculus, and to Phaeton was vouchsafed the
  coveted honor of entertaining the ruler of the world, while the rest of the
  suite stood aside in reverent silence. Domitian was remarkably gracious
  to-day. He condescended to pinch the boy's rosy cheeks, and invited him to
  share the breakfast, which was served in a garden-house with every
  conceivable luxury. Then Phaeton must sing to him, and tell him once more
  about his mother, the beautiful, heart-broken Judith, who had been brought to
  Rome as a young girl from her home in Palestine, and had never ceased weeping
  till her large, flashing eyes were dim and blind. The boy knew how to talk,
  sometimes gaily, sometimes sadly&mdash;of the holy citadel of
  Jerusalem<a href="#40">40</a> which, to him, included all that was sacred on
  earth&mdash;of the horrors of the siege&mdash;the Temple of Solomon&mdash;the
  hoary cedars of Lebanon. Then he would relate some reminiscence of his own
  experience&mdash;of the first time he threw the discus on the Field of Mars,
  and attracted the notice of Parthenius&mdash;of the pride and awe with which
  he had, for the first time, entered the imperial apartments&mdash;his delight
  at Caesar's approbation, when he returned from an excursion to Albanum.</p>

  <p>As he listened to this simple childlike prattle, Domitian was moved to a
  guileless feeling of affection, which he had long forgotten.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Phaeton," he said, stroking the boy*s long curls, "if base
  villains were to attempt your master's life, or try to hurt him, you would
  stand by him?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I was able, my lord," said the boy heartily. "But who would
  dare to commit so monstrous a crime?"</p>

  <p>"No one. Phaeton, by the gods! I only asked you to try your love for
  me."</p>

  <p>When he was weary of Phaeton's chatter, Caesar had his bearers to carry
  him about in the gardens for a while, and at last back to the
  palace&mdash;almost exactly at the hour when the assembled Fathers were
  coming down from the Capitoline, after passing the decree against the
  Christians. He remained in his room till he went to table, and at the meal he
  was lively, almost excited, though he eat but little, while, on the other
  hand, he drank full draughts of Falernian unmixed with water.</p>

  <p>When the coena was over, he retired to his private business-room. There he
  rushed up and down the room in loud and vehement soliloquy, fighting the air
  like a gladiator and exclaiming wildly: "Come on&mdash; only come on, you
  villains! my good sword shall cleave your skulls." Then he took to catching
  flies, as he had been wont to do as a boy,<a href="#41">41</a> impaling them
  on his writing-stylus.</p>

  <p>"Through and through!" he exclaimed in a tone of triumph. "Have I got you
  now, traitors? Aye, writhe and wriggle&mdash;like mad things! you shall not
  escape me now, till Tartarus yawns to receive your souls."</p>

  <p>By degrees his excitement calmed down; still, when the chamberlain made
  his appearance, he was so vigorous and eager, that Parthenius allowed himself
  to make a somewhat broad allusion to the evening's adventure.</p>

  <p>"You are a precious witty fellow!" laughed the Emperor. "But I feel myself
  that you have, in jest, hit the truth. Up then to deeds of glory! I only hope
  that Isis, the celestial Egyptian, may be content with her new brother."</p>

  <p>Cornelia, meanwhile, awaited this evening with feverish anxiety. The red-
  gold shafts of light, thrown by the setting sun on the eastern wall of the
  peristyle, had never lingered there so long as they mounted to the top. And
  when at last&mdash;at last they had disappeared, how slowly the darkness
  fell! How long it was before the night-sky had decked itself in its glory of
  stars.</p>

  <p>She gazed eagerly into the blue depths, seeking the constellation of
  Cassiopeia.<a href="#42">42</a> From that spot the god, veiled in invisible
  clouds, was to float eastwards through the air. The stars seem to twinkle and
  smile at her, as though they were conscious of the favor the immortals were
  about to grant her. To-night! to-night at two hours before
  midnight&mdash;what an unfathomable mystery. So potent were the prayers of
  Barbillus, the initiated minister of the gods, Osiris himself, the
  incomprehensible, had vouchsafed to meet a mortal woman, to appear in all the
  glory of his divine majesty, splendid and radiant as he once stood, risen
  from the dead, when the man-headed bird, Amun, had restored him to life. His
  face, to be sure, must remain hidden from a creature of earthly
  birth&mdash;that divine face of the sun, before whose fires a mortal would
  melt away as Semele,<a href="#43">43</a> in the Greek legend, had died in the
  arms of Zeus. Isis, the all-merciful mother, had made her brother swear never
  to appear on earth, without hiding the flaming glory of his countenance
  behind a hawk's head, which the people believed to be the real head of that
  inscrutable divinity, but which the initiated knew to be a benevolent
  mask.</p>

  <p>Cornelia sighed&mdash;a sigh of longing ecstasy. Her reason was altogether
  lulled to sleep. A passionate desire for release from all earthly burdens, a
  vague but fervent craving for some spiritual rapture wholly possessed her
  lofty and ardent soul. Barbillus might well congratulate himself; the success
  of his fantastic arts was beyond all he could have expected.</p>

  <p>It grew darker and darker.&mdash;"Go to bed, Cornelia," said her uncle,
  rising from his seat. "It is late. Come and kiss me, child! I feel strangely
  this evening, sad at heart! Generally, when I see folly prevailing over
  truth, it makes me angry, the blood boils in my veins. But to-day it all
  makes me melancholy; I feel something like pity for the myriad-bodied
  sufferer we call humanity. Enslaved to all that is base, mean, and
  common&mdash;that is its eternal and pitiable fate!... Sleep well, Cornelia;
  I am weary of these struggles, weary with this day's work, weary with the
  weight of long years."</p>

  <p>He clasped the girl in his arms, and kissed her forehead; then he retired
  to his own room. What was that light-colored object in front of the iron
  lamp! A note! Again, at this late hour! It was strange.</p>

  <p>"Charicles!" he called into the anteroom. The slave appeared.</p>

  <p>"Who brought this letter?"</p>

  <p>"The same stranger as before. I did not like to disturb you "</p>

  <p>"It is well; you can leave me," Cinna undid the fastening and read:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Fly, Cornelius. To-morrow at nightfall you will be seized.
  Your death is decided on... Save yourself, friend of freedom, and save your
  country."</p>

  <p>The Senator looked closely at the page; the writing was the same as in the
  first letter. He thought and wondered, but in vain. He did not doubt an
  instant. The display of force at the Palatium yesterday was in itself
  suspicious; at certain incidents in the morning's sitting&mdash;particularly
  one apparently innocent observation made by Titus Claudius&mdash;had somewhat
  startled him; and now this letter It was beyond all doubt. He determined to
  take Nerva and Ulpius Trajanus into counsel the first thing at daybreak, and
  to have quitted the city by noon. The details could be left for future
  consideration.</p>

  <p>He burned the letter in the lamp, and went to bed, calm, almost cheerful.
  After so long enduring the torments of uncertainty, the decision which forced
  him to action was, in spite of danger, far more welcome than a continuance of
  the suspense he had been living in.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was asleep, Cornelia, accompanied by Chloe and the faithful
  Parmenio, made her way to the temple of Isis. The slave and the freedman were
  parted from her sooner than on previous occasions; they were left in a
  ground- floor room, while Cornelia was conducted up-stairs by a servant of
  Barbillus'.</p>

  <p>The priest met her at the door of the antechamber. After putting off her
  cloak and her shoes, and saying a short prayer, she entered the sanctuary.
  Here, much had been altered since her last visit; the image of the goddess
  stood more on one side, and in the place of the black curtain, embroidered
  with silver, there was a sky-blue one, that fell in light, cloud-like folds.
  The soft floor was thickly strewn with white roses, which exhaled a delicious
  scent; and where formerly the altar had stood, a heavy tissue hung from the
  ceiling to the floor.</p>

  <p>"My daughter," said Barbillus, "you are indeed blessed above other
  mortals. Fear not, even if the majesty of the divinity should at first appal
  you; do not tremble, though its glory should dazzle you. All that is sent
  from heaven is gracious; infinite favor, even though it should seem strange
  and terrible. If you truly love the all-merciful mother of the universe and
  her divine brother&mdash;if you are in earnest in your efforts to avert the
  strokes of Fate from the beloved youth, to whom you are about to devote your
  life, once and forever&mdash;be brave and steadfast! Submit to the
  inscrutable counsels of him, who rules heaven and earth. Give him truthful
  devotion and childlike obedience, and the wish of your faithful heart shall
  be triumphantly fulfilled."</p>

  <p>Cornelia stood motionless. Her light dress and snow-white
  feet&mdash;barely covered by the border, the pale roses and her face, paler
  still&mdash;in the dim moonshiny light of the hanging-lamp, made a weird,
  though beautiful picture. The charm touched even the calculating
  priest&mdash;for a second he forgot to play his part; a ray of ardent
  admiration flashed from under his lashes. Only for an instant, but long
  enough for Cornelia to detect it. She started and drew herself up. She tried
  to persuade herself, that the dim flickering light or her own excited nerves
  had cheated her into such an impossible fancy. But do what she would, a shade
  of suspicion, a breath of distrust, lingered in her mind.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Kneel down there," said Barbillus, pointing to a cushion close to the
  curtain. "Pour out your soul unceasingly in prayer, and wait till the all-
  powerful god shall hear you."</p>

  <p>He was quite himself again&mdash;the devoted minister, solemn, reverend
  and dignified in his sublime loftiness.</p>

  <p>Cornelia was reassured. Still, as if struck by a sudden idea, she went up
  to him trembling.</p>

  <p>"My lord and master," she said with some agitation, "I do not know what it
  can be, that so unexpectedly troubles my soul. Am I indeed worthy to behold
  the infinite and all-merciful one with these sinful eyes? Is it possible? Is
  it conceivable?"</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;do you hesitate?"</p>

  <p>"Swear to me by all the immortals, by your own life and your hopes of
  bliss..."</p>

  <p>"Well, my daughter," said Barbillus, raising his right hand to heaven, "I
  swear by Isis of the thousand names, by the happiness of my life and the
  future bliss of my soul; the ruler of the world himself will vouchsafe to
  appear to you, the mighty lord before whom all grovel in the dust, from the
  rising to the setting of the sun."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I thank thee!" cried Cornelia in a transport. "Let me kneel, holy
  Father, and wait in all humility till your words are fulfilled."</p>

  <p>The priest left her. Cornelia sank on to the purple cushions with a sigh,
  and bowed her head; her long hair fell in a waving stream over her face and
  down to the ground. She clasped her hands and prayed.</p>

  <p>Then she heard once more that wonderful music, that seemed to come out of
  the ceiling and out of the walls, and yet sounded so distant, so appealing,
  so dream -like. Suddenly the lamp went out; a terrific peal of thunder shook
  the air, and the room quivered under her feet.<a href="#44">44</a> At the
  same instant an intense and intolerable light, which gradually became milder,
  filled the room. When Cornelia looked up again, trembling, the curtain in
  front of her had been drawn back. Not far beyond she saw a magnificent
  pulvinar<a href="#45">45</a>, as it was called; a stuffed couch, such as the
  priests made ready, when they offered the food of the gods to the sacred
  images of the immortals. Over the head of this couch hung a light cloud,
  which again flashed into vivid light, then gradually died out, till at last
  it looked merely like a mist, dim and ghostly. Then an icy breath fanned
  Cornelia's burning brow, the mist parted, and the figure of some unknown
  creature slowly advanced towards the terror-stricken girl&mdash;mysteriously,
  shrouded in some sheeny blue drapery that made the outlines indistinct, like
  an image in a dream.</p>

  <p>"Fear nothing," said a voice in a whisper.</p>

  <p>Cornelia looked upwards; the voice was soft like the murmur of waters, and
  seemed to come from above.</p>

  <p>"Fear nothing," it repeated. "Thy prayer is heard. Thou shalt be blest
  above all mortal women."</p>

  <p>The figure came nearer, and Cornelia, with an awe-stricken shudder,
  recognized the grotesque hawk-head that she had so often seen in images. Yes,
  it was the same guise that Osiris wore down in the temple, where he stood on
  his plinth of ivory and sardonyx, an inscrutable combination of hideousness
  and dignity. A god with the head of a brute creature! How could she so ignore
  her sense of beauty! How could she do such violence to the instincts of her
  nature? By degrees her pious delusions had gained the mastery; but
  now&mdash;now, when the statue seemed to have come to life, when the god
  himself in the hawk mask had stepped down from his pedestal, what a shiver
  chilled her blood! She shuddered, as if a snake or a scorpion were creeping
  towards her.</p>

  <p>By this time the shadowy form&mdash;which almost seemed to float in the
  air, so noiselessly had it moved&mdash;was standing close before her. A hand
  was softly laid upon her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Fear nothing," said the voice above. "The ways of the gods are
  wonderful."</p>

  <p>But this god, who appeared in such a questionable shape, now threw both
  arms round the excited girl and clasped her to his breast with a vehemence
  not usually attributed to the divine beings; at the same time the mysterious
  Osiris heaved a sigh, almost a gasp, which in the midst of all his grotesque
  paraphernalia sounded remarkably human. Enough&mdash;in the next instant
  Cornelia had violently flung the god from her with a loud shriek, and, as he
  staggered backwards, she flew at him and seized him by the throat with the
  strength of desperation. A thunder-clap even, that broke close over her head,
  failed of its effect; after a short struggle Cornelia stood free in the
  middle of the room, with the hideous painted mask crushed and broken in her
  left hand, her right hand clenched and raised to strike. Before her, with
  distorted features, his eyes inflamed with rage and terror, was the sneering
  and repulsively-bloated face of the Emperor. From his cheek, where Cornelia's
  nails had torn the flesh, blood was trickling out. He groaned and panted.</p>

  <p>For some minutes they stood transfixed, looking at each other.</p>

  <p>"Divine girl!" he said at last, in a broken voice. "Nothing but the
  wildest passion&mdash;a soul on fire..."</p>

  <p>He came a step nearer, and pressed his hand to his heart.</p>

  <p>"Stand back!" shrieked Cornelia wildly. "Is this the field where Caesar,
  the ruler of the world, seeks a triumph? Are these the glorious deeds of a
  Flavian?"</p>

  <p>"Hold your tongue, girl!" cried Domitian, furious.</p>

  <p>"I mock at your contemptible anger! Rome may crawl and whimper at your
  feet&mdash;I, Cornelia, scorn you! You clench your fist&mdash;coward! Kill me
  then, as you killed Julia."</p>

  <p>"How she stands there,", muttered Domitian, "like animated marble! I had
  expected a different issue to my hour of immortality. You shall pay for this,
  Barbillus!"</p>

  <p>Cornelia had made her way towards the door, her eye still fixed on the
  enemy, and she now laid her hand on the bolt&mdash;but the door was fastened
  outside. Domitian laughed. He saw that Barbillus had foreseen every
  contingency, and this restored his spirits. If cunning failed, force might
  still conquer. He felt for the dagger he wore in his bosom</p>

  <p>"You are wasting your trouble," he said scornfully. "Here you are mine,
  fair Cornelia."</p>

  <p>The girl supported herself against a pillar; her head swam, and the dim
  blue light which shone into the room from the alcove, suddenly grew dark
  before her eyes. But she soon recovered the use of her wits. It occurred to
  her, that on the other side, where the Emperor had come in, there must be
  another door. She sprang upon Domitian like a lioness, and he could not stand
  against the unexpected attack. He tottered on one side, his foot caught in a
  fold of the curtain, and he fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>By the time he had picked himself up again, Cornelia had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Barbillus!" shouted Domitian, in the darkness of the long corridor, which
  checked his pursuit. "I cannot see my hand before my
  face&mdash;Barbillus!"</p>

  <p>The priest came up the stairs with a lantern in his hand.</p>

  <p>"You have betrayed me, cheated me!" Caesar yelled, as Barbillus came
  towards him somewhat doubtfully. "Where is Parthenius?"</p>

  <p>"Here, sovereign lord," said the chamberlain's voice.</p>

  <p>"Wait here in the colonnade with Phaeton," said Domitian angrily. "And
  you, Barbillus, divest me this instant of all this foolery."</p>

  <p>When he found himself alone with the priest, and had got fully rid of the
  grotesque attributes of the divinity, he hurled furious abuse at
  Barbillus.</p>

  <p>"What?" he snarled. "There is no such thing as a virtuous Roman girl?
  Liar&mdash;answer."</p>

  <p>"I am deeply grieved," replied the priest. "How was I to guess that she,
  of all others, would be the girl to disappoint you! Her soft, credulous
  eyes&mdash;I would have risked my head on it."</p>

  <p>"Here you see the traces of her tender submissiveness! She shall
  die&mdash;a wretch, that dared to lift her hand against her
  sovereign&mdash;why, the blood has run down to my shoulder."</p>

  <p>Barbillus dipped a handkerchief in the cool fountain, and bathed
  Domitian's face.</p>

  <p>"How it stings!" he exclaimed wrathfully. Then his brow suddenly cleared;
  a gleam of satisfaction dawned on his face.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Barbillus; I believe this misadventure is of good omen."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," said Barbillus, thankful for this diversion. "A wound from so
  fair a hand "</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay&mdash;you do not understand. Did you hear of a scoundrelly
  astrologer, Ascletario, who paid for his audacity with his life two days
  since?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord; all the world has heard of it, and bewails it."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" laughed Caesar, in the gayest spirits. "Do not you see, that
  the prophecy is already fulfilled? Do not you perceive that henceforth I am
  safe? What were his words? That, ere long, my blood should be shed by
  violence, because the immortals were wroth at my love for a woman, who did
  not belong to me by any law, human or divine. Well&mdash;that blood has been
  shed."<a href="#46">46</a> And he pointed with evident delight to his
  cheek.</p>

  <p>"My lord, your wisdom is unequalled," said the priest. "Certainly, by all
  the laws of astrology it is beyond a doubt&mdash;the prediction is
  fulfilled."</p>

  <p>Domitian grinned with contentment.</p>

  <p>"So that, in fact, I owe a debt of gratitude to sweet Cornelia! By Zeus! I
  feel all my annoyance entirely vanishing and giving way to the tenderest
  regret. A girl like Aphrodite! And I, Caesar, the Lord of the universe,
  invite her, and she refuses to fling herself into my arms with rapture! It is
  preposterous! Ridiculous You must find means, crafty Barbillus, for you
  see"&mdash;and he laughed slyly&mdash;"the anger of the gods is brief."</p>

  <p>"My lord, but how am I to find means?" exclaimed Barbillus in despair. "Do
  you suppose, that Cornelia will ever set foot across this threshold
  again?"</p>

  <p>"You do not understand. I want no repetition of this solemn farce. It is
  not as a priest, but as a man, that you must find tools for your
  cunning."</p>

  <p>Barbillus looked at the floor, musing.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he said, "if I know Cornelia, sooner will she perish than break
  her faith with her lover. Nothing but a trick could give us the smallest
  chance of success, nothing but the mask of divinity."</p>

  <p>"Curse him!&mdash;And is another man to obtain what Caesar cannot win? Is
  a boy, a maundering lover, to stand in my way?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you know he is the son of the Flamen. If he were of any other
  family&mdash;Cornelius or Ulpius..."</p>

  <p>"You are right. I owe special consideration to the Claudia
  family.&mdash;So much the worse for you! And do you mean to say that, in all
  your mystical lore, you know of no charm that can part two turtle-doves? Are
  there not women, who make it their business to entrap young men&mdash;or
  sapient tongues to wag away a young girl's reputation? Is not Lycoris a
  perfect mistress of all the arts of seduction&mdash;or Martial a writer,
  whose epigrams are poisoned shafts? Come, consider the matter; try, plot,
  scheme. I must clasp that incomparable creature in my arms!&mdash;I
  must&mdash;do you understand, Barbillus&mdash;or, to speak plainly, I
  will."</p>

  <p>"Your will rules the world," replied Barbillus.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow for the rest. I will send my chamberlain to you early. Domitian
  will not be slow to recognize your services."</p>

  <p>He drew the hood of his lacerna over his head and descended the stairs,
  followed by Barbillus.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p>The noonday bustle was at its height in the baths of Titus. A constant
  stream of men, for the most part belonging to the rank of senators or the
  class of knights, flowed steadily through the wide Corinthian portico to the
  <i>apodyterium</i><a href="#47">47</a>, where a host of slaves were busy in
  divesting the new-comers of their toga and tunic.</p>

  <p>An equally dense crowd filled the <i>elaothesium</i><a href="#48">48</a>
  where the body was anointed with oil, and pressed through into the
  gymnasium,<a href="#49">49</a> where wrestling and discus-throwing were
  practised. One of the first laws of old Roman hygiene prescribed exercises of
  this kind before the bath. When the muscles had thus been thoroughly
  stretched, the bather wrapped himself in a light woollen garment and sat down
  to cool himself.</p>

  <p>This quarter of an hour of cooling on the benches round the wrestling-
  hall was one of the pleasantest of the day. Nowhere else was the chat so
  humorous or so gracious; nowhere else were the events of the day discussed
  with so much wit and acumen. Here, Martial launched his most daring epigrams.
  Here, Parthenius, the chamberlain, retailed the most flagrant intrigues and
  richest scandals. Here the last triumph in the circus was discussed, the
  proceedings of fair Lycoris, the achievement of some great gladiator, the
  peculations of a provincial governor, the will of a childless
  senator,<a href="#50">50</a> the suits pending before the centumvirate, the
  last recitations, banquets, deaths&mdash;but whatever the whims and humors of
  the loungers might bring uppermost, it was always cast in a form of easy
  grace, and discussed with a peculiar sparkle of light humor.</p>

  <p>On the day in question there was the usual flow of free talk in the
  luxuriously-furnished hall, and the marble statues, which looked down from
  their purple niches, might have heard, if they could, many a cutting speech
  and many a peal of noisy laughter.</p>

  <p>One of the most reckless talkers, in a group that had gathered round
  Martial, was Clodianus; his rubicund face beamed with Dionysiac excitement.
  The poet, wrapped over his ears in his sheet, had just delivered himself of
  an epigram, in his most pungent style, on an incident in the life of a
  certain attorney-at-law.<a href="#51">51</a> This man, Sabellus by name, a
  perfect model of incapacity, was never chosen to conduct a case by any but
  people of the lowest class, and from the beginning of his career had never
  once been successful. At last he had gained his first cause. The matter in
  dispute had been a cart-horse belonging to a wagoner. His client had offered
  the triumphant advocate a honorarium paid in kind, and the worthy Sabellus,
  in the excess of his joy, was talking of the brilliant success of his efforts
  in every public place m Rome. The poet described with malicious glee, how
  Sabellus had already told the story of the great horse case eight times, and
  at each repetition held his head a little higher. Martial concluded with
  these improvised lines:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Ah! these jubilant airs our friend Sabellus<br>
  Founds on half a measure of meal and lentils,<br>
  Three half-pounds of frankincense and pepper,<br>
  Falernian chitterlings<a href="#52">52</a> and a Lucanian sausage,<a href=
  "#53">53</a><br>
  A Syrian jug of black and muddy liquor,<br>
  A jar of Libyan figs that might be fresher."<a href="#54">54</a></p>

  <p>The whole story, told with a mixture of infinite relish and irony, was
  irresistible; but not one of the party laughed so immoderately, so long, and
  so loud, as the starch adjutant. He could not get over it; laughter as of a
  Cyclops filled his throat; it was as though the honest clumsiness of the
  soldier stood revealed in this naive and noisy amusement. His demeanor was so
  frank and blunt, that it might have satisfied Caesar himself.</p>

  <p>Still, this loud joviality was somewhat belied by the glances which
  Clodianus cast from time to time, when he thought himself unobserved, at a
  comer of the hall, where a man with piercing eyes and a strong aquiline nose,
  was beguiling the quarter of an hour spent in cooling himself, by reading.
  When the loud shout of laughter echoed through the room like the rattle of
  thunder, the reader raised his reddened eyelids.</p>

  <p>"What, Stephanus!" shouted Clodianus, holding his sides. "You are once
  more to be seen here? You have neglected us too much these last weeks.
  Martial grows more audacious every day. He is a splendid rascal, this
  Hispanian bully; by Incitatus! but he makes mince-meat of our Quirites. The
  story of Sabellus is delicious, a thing to revel in! And what are you
  studying here, in the intervals of discus-throwing?"</p>

  <p>He had slowly gone up to the steward, while the group round the witty
  epigrammatist were already drawn into the current of another story.</p>

  <p>"You are too kind," replied Stephanus. "But an individual can never be
  missed, where good talk is kept up by so many distinguished men. I am worried
  and out of spirits, and quite out of place among the gay and cheerful."</p>

  <p>Clodianus expressed his regret in a long-drawn "Ah," but his eye betrayed
  no sorrow. He seated himself on the couch by Stephanus.</p>

  <p>"It is very true, the air of the city is saturated with anxiety. I have my
  own little share of it. You know the old saying: 'A scorpion lurks under
  every stone.'" Stephanus smiled.</p>

  <p>"You carry your politeness&mdash;or your irony&mdash;too far.&mdash;You,
  the most fortunate man in Rome."</p>

  <p>"I might very well say the same of you. Except the little annoyances that
  Cneius Afranius can cause you, your life is that of a god on
  Olympus.&mdash;To be sure," he added in a lower voice, "that man's tenacity
  is beginning to look threatening. All the more so since..."</p>

  <p>"Well, finish your sentence."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, you know that until now I have found ways and means of
  parrying his attacks, but now..."</p>

  <p>The freedman turned pale.</p>

  <p>"But now?"</p>

  <p>"Now certain symptoms are revealing themselves&mdash; symptoms which make
  me suspect, that I shall not be able much longer to elude his thrusts."</p>

  <p>He had spoken these words hardly above his breath. They distilled slowly
  into the steward's ear like poisonous adders, and seemed to writhe in his
  very soul.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" he exclaimed in a choked voice. "You, the influential
  favorite of Caesar..."</p>

  <p>"It is as I say. Why, I cannot myself altogether understand, but I am
  alive to the fact. The wind is blowing keenly through all the Basilicas, and
  if you do not keep a bright look-out you may be wrecked."</p>

  <p>"But, by Jupiter! why have I not heard this till today?"</p>

  <p>"Because I fancied at first that I might be deceiving myself Splendid!
  First rate, Duilius! That is what I call throwing. Look, look now&mdash;<i>Io
  triumphe!</i>&mdash;a winner at Olympia could not beat that!"</p>

  <p>"I implore you," whispered Stephanus, "tell me at once..."</p>

  <p>"Keep calm," replied Clodianus. "The Baths are not the place for such a
  discussion. Where do you dine?"</p>

  <p>"With Lycoris."</p>

  <p>"Good, I will excuse, myself to Furius, and go with you. After supper, in
  the park, we shall easily secure a few minutes Bravo, Septimius! bravo I What
  wonderful muscles! Praxiteles<a href="#55">55</a> ought to have had you for a
  model! By Castor, but you will break every bone in Sempronius' body, sturdy
  as he is! Well, then," he went on, turning to Stephanus again, "we shall meet
  at the fair Massilian's table."</p>

  <p>He rose with a friendly nod, and passed through the great door in the
  inner wall into the frigidarium.<a href="#56">56</a></p>

  <p>There he tossed his woollen wrapper over the head of a slave, and
  descended in all the dignity of stalwart corpulence into the vast bath. More
  than a hundred bathers were already sitting in it, up to their shoulders in
  the transparent water. Only a few swimmers were disporting themselves at the
  farther end.</p>

  <p>Clodianus sat down too, thinking contentedly, and his gaze wandered round
  the noble hall. The light, which poured in from above through a circular
  opening, sparkled and twinkled so gaily on the dancing ripples&mdash;the
  splashing from the shells, through which the pipes were led which constantly
  renewed the water, sounded so soothing&mdash;the graceful forms of the nymphs
  in the fresco painting, and of the marble goddesses on their tall pedestals
  smiled so seductively, that any one might have supposed that the radiant
  expression on the adjutant's features was nothing more than a reflection from
  these bright and rosy surroundings.</p>

  <p>But Clodianus saw much more with the mind's eye, than with the eye of the
  senses. Elaborate schemes were disentangling themselves in his restless,
  brooding brain; incredible events rose before his fancy in vivid colors.</p>

  <p>And Clodianus looked better pleased than ever, when the tall figure of
  Stephanus appeared on the threshold. Sternly as the wily steward strove to
  conceal his feelings, Clodianus saw at a glance what an effect his revelation
  had had upon him, and he laughed, like a hunter who has had good sport in the
  field.</p>

  <p>"You are as radiant as the sun-god!" said a little man, who went down the
  steps at this instant. "It is horribly cold this morning&mdash;pure snow-
  water."</p>

  <p>His teeth chattered, and he shrugged his shoulders up to his ears.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Sextus Furius!" cried Clodianus, a little startled. "I am glad to
  meet you. I wanted to let you know, as soon as I quitted the bath, that I am
  prevented dining with you to-day. Important business "</p>

  <p>"That is a pity," replied the noble Senator, who, here, in the
  frigidarium, was not by any means an Apollo. "I had a great many things to
  talk to you about."</p>

  <p>"Business?"</p>

  <p>"Concerning the chamberlain. You know we are in treaty over an estate at
  Baiae?"</p>

  <p>"To be sure.&mdash;A most delightful residence. Made on purpose for the
  raptures of the honeymoon." And he winked significantly. But the little
  Senator pursed up his mouth and knit his brows in displeasure, and flourished
  his elbows so vehemently that the water splashed up all round him.</p>

  <p>"Furius, you are becoming a perfect Fury!" cried Clodianus. Then he
  laughed at his own precious wit and stirred his side of the bath into
  circling wavelets.</p>

  <p>"You seem monstrously happy!" remarked Furius biting his lips.</p>

  <p>"Monstrously! And if I only had a sweetheart as handsome and as hugely
  rich as your divine Claudia..."</p>

  <p>"Pooh, nonsense, I have not got so far as that yet. Titus Claudius, at the
  eleventh hour, begged for time for reflection."</p>

  <p>"You are in treaty for the estate all the same?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly&mdash;what do you think now? If the affair with Claudius falls
  through, I shall carry my suit next day to Fannia, who is younger, or to
  Paula or to old Camilla. My honor is at stake. I have already made every
  preparation; dramatic and pantomimic performances, sham fights and races. I
  cannot possibly withdraw; I am compromised on every side."</p>

  <p>And again he shivered and his teeth chattered. An instant later he sprang
  with one leap out of the bath.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," he said, "I am fast turning to ice. With regard to the
  estate.&mdash;Well, we can talk of that another time." He ran as fast as he
  could across the flags and flung himself into the warm water of the
  <i>caldarium</i> in the farther pillared hall. After warming his chilled
  limbs there for a short time, he submitted himself to the operations of the
  <i>tractators</i><a href="#57">57</a> or shampooers with brushes and
  strigils, and then, as red as a boiled lobster, betook himself to the
  dressing-rooms. He presently made his way home, anointed with Egyptian and
  Phoenician perfumes, and among the cushions of his luxurious dining-couch did
  his best to forget the chill of the <i>frigidarium</i> and the coldness of
  his coy Claudia.</p>

  <p>Clodianus finished the processes of the bath with an air of profound
  satisfaction, that was observed by all the bathers and accepted as undoubted
  evidence of his security in his office. No doubt the impression that he left
  behind him, here and elsewhere, must have some effect on Domitian. Caesar's
  capricious and vacillating nature was often more easily guided by such
  trifles, than by well-considered and deliberate action.</p>

  <p>From the baths Clodianus went on foot to the residence of Lycoris, talking
  as he went with the greatest affability to the clients and slaves who
  accompanied him. Nay, with one of his clients he exchanged blows in sham
  fight, regardless of the numerous gazers who respectfully made way for him,
  but who were greatly amazed at this rough jesting.</p>

  <p>At the house of the Massilian he met a mixed company. Stephanus had
  already arrived, and he preserved his usual calm and easy indifference, when
  the adjutant came in. But he gradually made plans and preparations to involve
  Clodianus in a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te conversation, while Clodianus
  showed great cleverness in ignoring and evading these attempts. They went to
  table and were entertained by flute-players and singers. The Lucrine oysters
  were relished with intolerable deliberateness; the succession of dishes was
  positively interminable&mdash;so, at least, it seemed to the freedman, who
  was quite exasperated by the soldier's huge appetite.</p>

  <p>At last, at last, they rose, and, after a quarter, another quarter of an
  hour's manoeuvring, Stephanus gained his point. He was slowly pacing by the
  gourmand's side through the splendid avenues, where the light west wind now
  and again lifted a brown leaf from the bough and wafted it to its rest on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"You see I am in the greatest agitation," began Stephanus, as his
  companion seemed inclined to continue a conversation begun at the
  supper-table. Clodianus suddenly turned quite solemn.</p>

  <p>"To be frank with you," he said, "you have good reason. Why should I try
  to conceal it? The situation is most critical. Be on your guard, Stephanus; I
  fear you may need all your keenest wits.&mdash;Hark! some one is behind us;
  even here we are surrounded by listeners. Only one thing I must say. Afranius
  is attracting Caesar's liking..."</p>

  <p>"That would be my ruin," gasped the freedman in dismay.</p>

  <p>"Not yet&mdash;you must not lose all hope. It is true that, if I am not
  deceived, Caesar will not only allow, but will command Afranius to make the
  strictest enquiries.&mdash;However, you have a crafty brain. I only wanted to
  let you know the state of affairs; in the first place to warn you, and
  secondly to show you the reason why my interference is now at an end.
  Afranius indeed I might outwit, but..." He shrugged his shoulders, and his
  face expressed the deepest concern. Stephanus gnawed his lips.</p>

  <p>"Then Afranius must be got out of the way," he said, frowning. "I have
  long thought I was too easy..."</p>

  <p>"That would do no good. On the contrary; the sudden disappearance of
  Afranius would excite comment and remark, and every one would know at once to
  whom to attribute it. I tell you once more, it is not Afranius, it is Caesar
  himself.&mdash;Silence! to-morrow come and see me in my villa in the Via
  Praenestina&mdash;after sundown.&mdash;Nay, hold up your head, Stephanus. If
  it comes to the worst you can take ship and sail for Africa."</p>

  <p>"I? Leave Rome! I would die first. Rome is the only place where one can
  breathe. I should die in a province."</p>

  <p>"Well, we can discuss that later. See, Lycoris and the noble Norbanus have
  found us out&mdash;a well-matched pair! The conqueror of Dacian armies, and
  the conqueror of Latin hearts. Come, fair mistress, and decide the question;
  we are disputing as to whether the plane or the elm turns yellow first. Speak
  the decisive word."</p>

  <p>Lycoris laughed.</p>

  <p>"If you put me to torture, I do not know. They both turn yellow too soon
  to please me." She drew her cloak more closely round her, for the evening was
  chilly. They turned and went down the avenue together; Lycoris and the two
  soldiers in eager chat, Stephanus in the silence of despair.</p>

  <p>When, after a short walk, they reentered the house, Clodianus laid his
  hand on the steward's arm and looked meaningly into his eyes. "Hold up your
  head," he said with determined emphasis. "You may conquer yet, if you are a
  man."</p>

  <p>The words seemed to work a miracle. Stephanus inferred from them, that
  Clodianus had not told him everything. This idea, and yet more the peculiar
  expression of the adjutant's manner, restored his confidence.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," he whispered, as he shook hands with the astute officer. Then
  the party gave themselves up to enjoyment&mdash;a gay party!</p>

  <p>It was near midnight, when Stephanus set out homewards. He could now
  hardly realize how he had so utterly lost heart at a single blow. Had he not
  sailed with triumphant success round many a rocky shore? Had he not ridden
  with safety through every storm? The storm that now roared round him was, to
  be sure, a hurricane. But Clodianus, that stalwart pilot, was standing at the
  helm.&mdash;In short&mdash;the much-dreaded Caesar was but a man like other
  men&mdash;It was folly to run his head against the troubles of the future!"
  To- day is mine, and I will enjoy the present."</p>

  <p>In his bedroom he found his favorite, Antinous. The slave flew to meet him
  with eager eyes, and as soon as the others had withdrawn, Stephanus sat down
  on his couch, and called the lad to him.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"The game is ours," said the slave. "But it has cost much trouble and
  pains "</p>

  <p>"Ours? Do not sell the lion's skin, before he is in the net."</p>

  <p>"But he is in the net. I have found out everything, and what I know, my
  lord, will be the death of him as surely..."</p>

  <p>"Do not go too fast; the Claudians are powerful. Nothing but the most
  terrific stroke will fell him."</p>

  <p>"But hear me, and then judge. Quintus Claudius has joined the
  Nazarenes."</p>

  <p>"Impossible! A millionaire has thrown in his lot with the beggars 1 It is
  a lie, boy." Antinous laughed.</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a fable, does not it? But it is the truth all the same. I
  pledge my head on it: before the week is out Quintus Claudius is taken and
  sentenced."</p>

  <p>"Boy, you are a jewel!" cried Stephanus beside himself " If all this
  proves true, by the gods, I will have you set in gold."</p>

  <p>"My plan is most simple. To-morrow morning early... "</p>

  <p>"That will do," interrupted Stephanus, who was quite incapacitated by
  delight, from attending to details. "I trust it all to you, and give you full
  powers to do whatever you think necessary. As I live, that would be a
  victory&mdash;a triumph such as never was heard of! Come here, lad, that I
  may kiss you." He hugged the boy as if he had lost his reason.</p>

  <p>"Now go, be off&mdash;I must rest."</p>

  <p>"Sleep well!" said Antinous. "You may rest on laurels." And he ran off</p>

  <p>"Capital, glorious!" murmured his master. "Now&mdash;now, fair Domitia
  "</p>

  <p>In the excitement of his feelings he hid his head in the pillows; a slight
  shudder shook his meagre frame. He clenched his fists, and closed his lips
  tightly.&mdash;Thus he fell asleep; and his deep and difficult breathing
  sounded loud in the still, dimly-lighted room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p>After the frightful scene in the sanctuary of Barbillus, Cornelia had
  rushed blindly down the dark corridor, which brought her to a flight of steps
  in the outer wing of the building. She thus found her way into the courtyard,
  and from thence into the anteroom, where Parmenio and Chloe were waiting for
  her. "Fly!" she cried in desperate accents, and hurried on, past the
  ostiarius and out into the road.</p>

  <p>As soon as she reached home, she went to her own room, evading Chloe's
  well-intentioned questions with angry retorts. She lay on her bed till
  morning, unable to sleep. Her whole being was unhinged. All that had, until
  now, seemed highest and most sacred, all the transcendental dreams of her
  ecstatic spirit, were suddenly shown to be empty and base, a miserable
  illusion, a sordid imposture. With her belief in the divine mission of
  Barbillus, she flung from her all faith in Isis the universal mother, and
  indeed, in everything supernatural.</p>

  <p>It was a sudden convulsion of her whole nature, that had rent and upheaved
  its very foundations.</p>

  <p>Through that long and dismal night, when she lay awake and in tears,
  strange voices seemed to sound in her ears. How often had she listened, only
  half-attentive, to her uncle, as he and Ulpius Trajanus sat discussing of the
  Nature of Things, of the great secret of the Universe! She had never been
  able to understand how Cinna could dare to deny the existence of the gods,
  but now she recalled all she could remember of these discussions. In fancy
  she saw that frank face, full of bland and happy excitement, every feature
  bearing the seal of moral conviction. She reflected on the deep impression,
  which Cinna's words made on Ulpius Trajanus&mdash;a calm, reflective mind.
  And then again, she saw the ludicrously grotesque figure with its hawk-head,
  and the priest's insidious and hypocritical face. What a flagrant contrast!
  And if the priest with his debauched Osiris was the incarnation of a lie,
  then Cinna must be the embodiment of truth. The conclusion was not logical,
  but Cornelia philosophized from the heart.</p>

  <p>The next day she stole about the house, like the youth of Sais after he
  had lifted the veil. To Chloe she did not speak a word; it was as though she
  felt her to be an accomplice and was ashamed.</p>

  <p>Towards noon Cornelius rode out on horseback, accompanied by Charicles and
  one of the younger slaves.</p>

  <p>"How ill you look, child!" he said, as he took leave of Cornelia; "order
  your litter, and be carried out to the Field of Mars, the fresh air will do
  you good. I shall be back as it grows dark.&mdash;I have some business to
  attend to at Aricia. Say so, if by any chance I should be asked for."</p>

  <p>Cornelia dined in a little room opening out of her own, if a little fruit
  could be called a meal. As it grew dark, her lover came to see her. All day
  he had felt the same urgent craving for solitude and meditation as Cornelia.
  The consciousness, that he had crossed the threshold of a new and unknown
  life, and had sealed, solemnly and forever, a covenant with a new God,
  possessed him with irresistible force. He felt that he must clearly face and
  realize the fact, before he could go forth again into the wild turmoil of
  city life. Rome, which until lately he had considered as the element in which
  alone he could live, now watched him with the jealous eye of an informer.
  Every comer-stone, every column cried mockingly: "Quintus, be on your guard!"
  Every human countenance threatened betrayal and an ignominious
  death.&mdash;Aye, beware, Quintus, and hide your secret as a murderer hides
  his crime!</p>

  <p>By degrees the young man arrived at a clear view of himself and of his
  position. All that was needful, was calm presence of mind and absolute
  silence. Not a soul must guess what, on the face of it, was so incredible; no
  one&mdash;if only for his father's sake. Cornelia alone, that dear one, whose
  lofty nature had always been marked by what was a truly Nazarene longing for
  something absolutely divine&mdash;Cornelia alone should, by degrees, be
  admitted to know the great secret, and be won over to the doctrine of Jesus
  Christ. The idea of not sharing every thought, to the inmost spring of his
  moral life, with the girl he so devotedly loved, was so intolerable, that he
  determined to try at once, at least, to sound the depths of her feeling, for
  some ground where he might, by-and-bye, find anchorage.</p>

  <p>The fact, that he found Cornelia alone, seemed to him of happy omen; he
  could talk with her undisturbed The evening was too cool to allow of their
  sitting in the peristyle, and Cornelia received her lover in her uncle's
  study. Quintus was struck by her silence and uneasy looks; still, this seemed
  to him to be the very mood in which to speak to her of matters outside and
  above ordinary life.</p>

  <p>Their surroundings too, suggested an opening. A number of book-rolls, and
  among them the works of the elder Pliny, lay on the large ebony table. Cinna
  had for a long time been engaged in writing a work on natural history which,
  in many respects, went far beyond Pliny; this led Quintus to speak of the
  wide difference between the views held by the uncle and the niece. How
  surprised he was then to find Cornelia's whole nature entirely altered, as it
  seemed to him, when she shook her head and smiled bitterly over his
  passionate eloquence, and finally declared, shortly and drily, that she was
  cured once and forever of the follies of her childhood, and would take every
  precaution to avoid a relapse.</p>

  <p>Quintus was so astonished, that he dropped the subject.</p>

  <p>"We will discuss this some time, when we are less fatigued and in better
  spirits," he said. "We both need rest; you are looking pale, Cornelia."</p>

  <p>A deep sigh was heard from a comer of the room. It was Chloe filling up
  the brazier with a shovelful of charcoal broken small.</p>

  <p>"That may well be!" she murmured, in a melancholy key.</p>

  <p>"What time is it?" Cornelia asked her, to stop her talking.</p>

  <p>"Half-way into the first vigil."</p>

  <p>"My uncle is very late!" said Cornelia. "He was to return at sundown.
  Hark! I hear steps..."</p>

  <p>Parmenio come into the room announcing Caius Aurelius.</p>

  <p>"At this hour!" cried Cornelia in surprise.</p>

  <p>"He is in a great hurry," said the slave. "He must speak to my lord, he
  said, even if you were gone to bed, I told him my master was gone to Aricia;
  at first he seemed much pleased to hear it, but then he grew anxious again.
  Now he begs to be admitted."</p>

  <p>"How very strange! Well, tell him he is welcome."</p>

  <p>Aurelius came in, evidently bewildered and agitated. He greeted Cornelia
  briefly, and asked whether Cinna was expected to return that evening.
  Cornelia's reply made him thoughtful. Still, learning that Cinna, who was
  usually so punctual, was already nearly two hours behind time, his face
  beamed with inexplicable satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"He may perhaps be detained for several days," he said emphatically. "Be
  that as it may, you will allow me to leave two lines for him. If he should
  happen to come in, give him the note instantly, everything depends upon
  it."</p>

  <p>"You alarm me!" said Cornelia. "What is happening?"</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, dear mistress, if I can tell you nothing more..."</p>

  <p>He went to the table, hastily seized the first piece of paper that fell
  under his hand, and wrote as follows: "The Batavian to the noble Cornelius,
  greeting. Delay is danger. Remember Rodumna!"</p>

  <p>He folded up the leaf.</p>

  <p>"As soon as he arrives, before he has taken his cloak off&mdash;do you
  understand me, mistress? And if he should not return, tear the note into
  fragments, or throw It into the fire."</p>

  <p>"If he should not return?&mdash;but what should prevent him?"</p>

  <p>"I only mean, if he should not return this night."</p>

  <p>Quintus drew the excited visitor on one side.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" he said.</p>

  <p>"The worst, Quintus. Cornelius is watched, followed&mdash;but by-and-bye,
  my friend&mdash;just now I am as hard pressed as a stag followed by the
  hounds. Farewell! Who knows&mdash;by the gods! my brain is in a whirl."</p>

  <p>"Must you go?" said Cornelia.</p>

  <p>"Indeed I must. Farewell, the gods be with you all."</p>

  <p>He rushed out to the atrium, where Herodianus and Magus were waiting for
  him in silence and darkness.</p>

  <p>"Now, come&mdash;as fast as possible, to the high-priest*s house; Claudia
  is expecting me. If she could dream, that I am about to take leave of
  her..."</p>

  <p>The whole house was wrapped in sleep, when Lucilia cautiously unbolted the
  side-door. Claudia was standing in the colonnade, and her heart beat high as
  the Batavian softly went up to her.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," he said, "for daring to snatch an interview so late at
  night. Claudia, do you feel strong enough to cling to me faithfully through
  every change of fate?"</p>

  <p>"What a dreadful question, Caius; and I have been so content to-day, so
  happy&mdash;the future looked so rosy.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Caius, my dear love, what has happened? Your hand is
  trembling&mdash;what have you to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"I must go away, sweet Claudia&mdash;this very night."</p>

  <p>"Impossible! Ah, Caius! say this is a jest."</p>

  <p>"Nay, I will tell you all, only not now, not at this minute. You shall
  very soon hear from me, Claudia; but as to whether I shall ever
  return&mdash;that lies in the counsels of the Immortals. If you regret your
  promise, Claudia, if the remote and unknown future terrifies you, say so in
  time; you shall not be bound. "But, if you love me with all your soul. Fate
  cannot divide us. You will find out the path by which we may meet again, and
  you will not be mistaken in the man you have chosen, happen what may."</p>

  <p>"Caius, you are breaking my heart! I do not understand it&mdash;but you
  will not allow me to ask.&mdash;Well, so be it then, I submit. Come what may,
  Caius, I am your wife, and when you bid me I will follow you. Oh ye gods! how
  cruel, how hard&mdash;in the midst of so much sunshine.&mdash;I cannot bear
  it!"</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, forgive me," said Aurelius, himself hardly able to check his
  tears. "It is a shame to spoil your happiness, but I cannot help
  it.&mdash;Farewell, my Claudia. Love me, remember me, and trust to your
  protecting star!"</p>

  <p>"Farewell," sobbed the girl. "And you will tell me all, everything, will
  you not?"</p>

  <p>"All I can and may," said Aurelius. "Perhaps," he added tremulously, "I
  may be able to tell you that all is well, here, in Rome, in your father's
  house. But, if what I am planning and hoping, must fail&mdash;well, even
  then, I know that one thing will remain dearer and more precious than
  success&mdash;you, my Claudia."</p>

  <p>He clasped her in his arms; then he tore himself away, and hurried off to
  the little door.</p>

  <p>"A thousand thanks, good soul!" he whispered to Lucilia as he passed. The
  bolt was cautiously pushed back into the rings, and Caius Aurelius flew home,
  leaning on the arm of Herodianus. It was almost midnight by the time he
  reached home; the door-keeper was asleep, nor did he wake till they had
  knocked repeatedly.</p>

  <p>"You may go now, Antisthenes," said Herodianus. "I will shut up the house;
  you are released for tonight." The ostiarius went off to his little room.</p>

  <p>Herodianus not only bolted the door, but barred it too,<a href=
  "#58">58</a> with the strong iron stanchion which stood unused in the corner,
  slipping it into the staples on each side of the door; and it was not till he
  had made all fast that he followed his master, who had lighted the lamps in
  one of the large rooms adjoining the peristyle, and opened a brass- plated
  cupboard in the wall. While Aurelius and Herodianus were busy packing up all
  their valuables, and particularly large quantities of gold coin, Magus, in
  the garden behind the house and adjoining the pillared court, was saddling
  three capital horses.</p>

  <p>He had just finished tightening the girths of the second, a fine
  Cappadocian, when three thundering knocks at the front entrance echoed
  through the house.</p>

  <p>"What, already?" muttered the Goth. "Then indeed..."</p>

  <p>He flung the saddle on the third horse with double haste, and then
  listened in breathless anxiety. Meanwhile Herodianus had gone to the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" he asked wrathfully. "Open the door," answered a gruff
  voice.</p>

  <p>"By Pluto! My master only receives visitors in the day time."</p>

  <p>"Open it!" repeated the voice. "In the name of the city-prefect."<a href=
  "#59">59</a></p>

  <p>Herodianus just waited to make sure that the bar was fast in the staples;
  then he ran as quickly as he was able back to the peristyle.</p>

  <p>"My lord, are you ready?" he said breathlessly to Aurelius, who was
  girding on a short sword. "The spies have come two hours too soon."</p>

  <p>"Then may the gods befriend us! I though^ it was a messenger from
  Cinna..."</p>

  <p>"No indeed&mdash;from the city-prefect. Hark, they are shaking the house
  to the foundations..."</p>

  <p>"I will speak to them," said Aurelius. "Do you meanwhile arm yourself and
  see whether the road by the garden door is clear. As soon as you are ready,
  give me a signal."</p>

  <p>Herodianus flung the valuables they had packed, and five or six bags of
  coin, into a large leather sack, which lay on the floor; then he hurried into
  the garden, gave the sack over to Magus, who swung it lightly over his
  shoulder, bid him mount, and, with cautious steps, went to reconnoitre from
  the side gate. Aurelius had gone out into the ostium, which was still being
  shaken with the blows at the door.</p>

  <p>"Stop that!" he cried, as loud as he could shout. "Who dares to use such
  violence here? I am a Roman citizen, and will have you punished for your
  insolence."</p>

  <p>"Open the door, or we will break it in," said a voice outside.</p>

  <p>"It will be the worse for you if you do.&mdash;Who are you, that come to
  attack my house by force?"</p>

  <p>"Hold your tongue. I am here in the name of the city-prefect."</p>

  <p>"And what do you want with me?"</p>

  <p>"That you shall soon know. Open the door, or by Jupiter!"</p>

  <p>"Very good, I will open it."</p>

  <p>He went forward and took hold of the bolt; as he did so he heard that some
  of the men outside were on horseback; this discovery chilled his blood and
  almost paralyzed him. He stood motionless with his hand on the bolt, which he
  had half thrust out of the staple.</p>

  <p>Just then a shrill whistle from the atrium reached his ear; it gave him
  new life.</p>

  <p>"In a minute&mdash;directly," he shouted to the men, who were again
  rattling at the door with their spears and swords. "This bar sticks&mdash;I
  will call the slaves."</p>

  <p>With these words he flew into the garden, where Magus, who had whistled in
  the corridor between the atrium and the peristyle, was in the act of mounting
  his horse. Aurelius flung himself into the saddle; the side gate was open.
  Herodianus went forward slowly on the Cappadocian, which, since his
  misadventure in the Field of Mars, he had ridden pretty constantly. Aurelius
  followed on his often-proved Andalusian, and Magus came last. Hardly had the
  slave come through the gate, when the master's steed started and pricked his
  ears in alarm; at the same time they heard distant hoofs.</p>

  <p>"They are riding round the hill," said the freedman.</p>

  <p>"Then we must turn to the left, towards the Porta Asinaria," cried
  Aurelius. "Hurry! We are riding for our lives."</p>

  <p>The horses rushed on like the wind. The neighborhood in which they found
  themselves, south of the Caelian, was a very quiet one, and the few
  passers-by, men on foot and chiefly of the lowest class, made way in
  astonishment for the cavalcade that stormed by. In a few minutes they were
  outside the walls of the city.</p>

  <p>The night was bright and starry, and Magus, looking round as they turned a
  comer, could plainly see, at about three hundred paces behind them, a troop
  of horsemen pursuing them at full gallop.</p>

  <p>"One, two&mdash;four&mdash;six," he said to himself Then he laid his hand
  on his sword-hilt and struck spurs into his horse, which had fallen a little
  behind.</p>

  <p>"Curse them!" said Aurelius. "We are going far out of our way; the nearest
  road is by Ardea."</p>

  <p>Magus looked once more through the darkness and his keen eyes, accustomed
  to the gloomy nights of the northern seas, presently detected a cross-road at
  five or six hundred paces to the south-east and cutting across the plain to
  join the Appian and Ardeatinian Ways. He pointed it out to his master.</p>

  <p>"Very good, let us try it."</p>

  <p>The spot indicated by the Goth was reached in a minute. The horses heads
  were abruptly turned and they made a good pace across the open country, along
  an unpaved bridle-path. The hoofs of the pursuers rang out through the silent
  night&mdash;suddenly they ceased. The pursuers too had reached the turning
  into the crossroad.</p>

  <p>"They ride like the Walk&uuml;re!" exclaimed the Goth.</p>

  <p>They galloped on, breathlessly, but with uncanny noiselessness, past hats
  and isolated villas, trees and hedge-rows, till they reached the wooden
  bridge over the Almo, across which Magus led the way and the others followed.
  An interminable line of houses, standing out in silhouette against the
  western sky, here marked the line of the Via Appia. From thence it was only a
  few hundred paces to the Via Ardeatina.<a href="#60">60</a></p>

  <p>Meanwhile the distance between the pursued and the pursuers had neither
  increased nor diminished perceptibly; only one of the city-prefect's horsemen
  had left his comrades behind and gained upon them every minute. They were
  just crossing the Via Appia when this man threw his spear and it passed close
  by the head of Herodianus's horse. The beast shied on one side and reared;
  then it rushed on with increased swiftness after Magus and the Batavian.</p>

  <p>Five or six minutes more slipped by. Neither of the fugitives now thought
  of depending in any way on the others; a glance backwards, a movement, might
  be fatal. The distance between the foremost horseman and his company might
  now be about two thousand paces, and he was close on the freedman's heels.
  They had long since struck into the Via Ardeatina, and could not now be very
  far from the Oracle of the Faun,<a href="#61">61</a> where the road turned
  off that led to Lavinium and from thence to Laurentum<a href="#62">62</a> and
  Ostia. The soldier urged his horse with a desperate effort to overtake
  Herodianus, and drawing his sword he drove it up to the hilt into the
  Cappadocian's flank. The horse fell as if struck by lightning, while
  Herodianus flew head foremost out of the saddle, and must have broken every
  bone in his body, if a hillock covered with soft turf had not lain in the
  way. The horseman, who could not at once check his pace, shot over the mound
  and some paces farther. This gave Herodianus time to pick himself up and draw
  his sword, and hardly had he got on his feet and made ready to defend
  himself, when the man sprang back upon him; desiring him to give up his sword
  and surrender.</p>

  <p>"Not so fast!" said Herodianus, whose anger had risen as he got over the
  shock. "This hillock will serve for a fortress, and you may beseige me in it
  if you will!"</p>

  <p>"Idiot!" shouted the man. "I give you one more chance; throw down your
  sword, or I will kill you."</p>

  <p>He put spurs to his horse, to take the mound at a leap and ride down
  Herodianus; but at this instant Aurelius appeared on the field, sword in
  hand. He was only just in time to save his worthy retainer, but he fell with
  such fury upon the mercenary that, after attempting a short defense, he
  hastened to withdraw; Aurelius had, however, given him a deep cut on the
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Where is your horse?" asked he.</p>

  <p>"There&mdash;by the ditch; the villain has killed it."</p>

  <p>"Come and mount behind me," said Aurelius. "Hi! Magus&mdash;what are you
  doing?"</p>

  <p>The Goth had dashed past with his bridle hanging loose.</p>

  <p>"Magus!" shouted his master anxiously. "What are you going to do?" And
  then turning to Herodianus he added: "Well, make haste.&mdash;My horse can
  carry two."</p>

  <p>"Pooh! Do you take your old friend for a shirker? Sooner will I fall into
  the hands of that gang, than bring you to destruction too."</p>

  <p>"Here! Jump up here!" shouted the Goth. He held the soldier's horse by the
  bridle. The rider was lying in the dust about a hundred paces off.</p>

  <p>"Hail to the victor!" cried Herodianus. "That is what I call prompt
  reprisal."</p>

  <p>"He is a German like myself," shouted Magus, "and is not ashamed to run
  down one of his own kith and kin! But I was down upon him, by Odin's
  raven!"</p>

  <p>Herodianus, with a gasping effort, threw himself into the saddle.</p>

  <p>"On we go!" he exclaimed, as he settled himself and seized the bridle, and
  they started afresh along the echoing road. Only just in time, for they heard
  the little group check their horses as they came up with their comrade, who
  had become unconscious from his heavy fall and from loss of blood.</p>

  <p>"Pick him up, Aeolus," cried the leader of the little band. "The dark mass
  down there behind the trees is Ardea. We can leave him at the tavern."</p>

  <p>While one of the men stopped to rescue his senseless comrade, the others
  mended their pace and rode on after the fugitives. But their steeds were not
  equal to it. Before they had reached Ardea one fell, the blood flowing from
  his nostrils, and the others panted so terribly, that the captain saw that
  the chase was hopeless and gave the order to slacken. In about twenty minutes
  they reached the northern gate of the town and knocked up the innkeeper.</p>

  <p>Aurelius and his companions had meanwhile ridden at their original pace to
  a spot about a thousand paces beyond the little town. There they stopped, and
  finding that there was nothing to be seen or heard between them and Ardea,
  they allowed themselves a minute to breathe and to swallow a draught of
  Setian wine,<a href="#63">63</a> after which they went forward at an easier
  gallop. Thus, in about an hour, they reached Antium, still in the silence of
  the night. The town seemed dead, there was not a human being to be seen in
  the deserted streets. At the north-west end of the harbor the trireme lay at
  anchor and, to his great satisfaction, Aurelius found the boat ready on the
  shore to carry him and his friends on board. He, then, was not the first to
  arrive.</p>

  <p>"Ho! Chrysostomus!" he cried, turning his horse towards the strand. "How
  are things going on?"</p>

  <p>"Well, my lord. We have been waiting here ever since it grew dark. Your
  friends have all arrived. Half an hour since the old man came, the one with
  white hair&mdash;Cocceius Nerva&mdash;he was the last."</p>

  <p>Herodianus and Magus went forward, and Aurelius followed. The Roman's
  horse and the one Magus had ridden were left behind; Aurelius*s Andalusian
  they took with them. The boat pushed off, cut across the dark waters of the
  harbor and carried the party safe on board.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p>On the following morning the frightful news spread like wild-fire through
  the city that several citizens, some of them men of high position, had been
  seized at dead of night by the city-prefect and carried off to the state-
  prisons; while others&mdash;and among them the Senators Cornelius Cinna and
  Marcus Cocceius Nerva&mdash;had only escaped sharing their fate by
  flight.</p>

  <p>After Cinna's rash demonstration, in opposition to the law against the
  Christians, such proceedings were not considered very astonishing. Nerva,
  too, had long seemed ripe for destruction, from the point of view of the
  state-craft of the time. But that a host of individuals who, till now, had
  been regarded as blamelessly innocent, nay, that such a man as Furius should
  be apprehended, produced a painful impression on the public mind. Every one,
  who did not feel himself protected by his modest station and personal
  insignificance, began to quake, and even the humble population of the Subura
  seemed to be dragged into sympathy with the anxiety of the higher classes.
  The cries of the wandering dealers and street pedlars were subdued, and
  though the cook-shops and barbers' rooms were crowded, the talk was in low
  mysterious tones. On every band suspicious and anxious looks prevailed.</p>

  <p>What most agitated and puzzled the citizens of Rome, was the fact, that
  the confessed enemies of Caesar had been able to escape; this revealed a
  regular and well-organized plot; nay, from the high rank and wide influence
  of the fugitives, it was almost an open declaration of war. It was
  self-evident, that Nerva and Cinna would not have retired so promptly into
  exile, but that they were about to strain every nerve in order to return
  victorious. Much was said about the connections they both could count upon in
  the provinces, and particularly in the Gallia Lugdunensis. These allies,
  judiciously treated, might, in the present state of public feeling as to
  Domitian's tyranny, combine for some crushing catastrophe. If no more than
  two or three legions should raise the standard of revolt, under the guidance
  of a commander bent on death or success, the Emperor's rule would be in
  serious danger, to say the least. Men recalled the days of Nero&mdash;how
  rapidly the flame of revolution had spread in every direction, when the mass
  of combustibles had been piled sky- high, through many years of
  misgovernment. The Praetorian Guard could only be trusted conditionally.
  Their loyalty was simply a matter of price. As long as they were splendidly
  paid they would be for Caesar, and this sort of fidelity could easily be
  corrupted in a single night.</p>

  <p>On the other hand the noiselessness, with which the arrests had been
  managed, and the calm unforced regularity, which prevailed in every
  department of public life, seemed to guarantee the unwavering stability of
  the government. The palace was to-day guarded by a single cohort, as usual.
  The morning audience had been duly crowded. The Senate met at the usual hour,
  and Domitian joined them, carried to the sitting in his litter, and escorted
  by only a small portion of the Praetorian Guard. Races were announced for the
  following day in the Circus Maximus, and at the same time the Acta
  Diurna,<a href="#64">64</a> the official sheet of Rome, formally proclaimed
  Caesar's intention of edifying and delighting his beloved Romans by the
  celebration of magnificent centennial games, never yet equalled for splendor
  and variety. In short, within the precincts of the Palatium such security and
  indifference prevailed as could not fail, if thoroughly carried out, to exert
  great influence on public feeling. Added to this, a vague report got about
  that the birds had flown in consequence of a warning, to which the government
  had been accessory, since Caesar had been willing to avoid the painful
  necessity of arraigning such men as Cinna, Nerva, and Trajan before the
  Senate. Thus it was not to Caesar's dilatoriness or clumsiness that they owed
  their escape, but to his magnanimity.</p>

  <p>Though no such magnanimity had ever before been seen at the palace, this
  view was warmly encouraged.</p>

  <p>Clodianus swore to Caesar by all the gods, that the treason which must
  evidently have been at work, should be tracked to earth and avenged. The
  guilty party must be some one in the Emperor's immediate service. Was
  Domitian absolutely certain that the tablet, with the list of doomed names,
  had never been out of his own hands? To this Caesar replied, that he had kept
  the tablet about his person day and night; but Clodianus reminded him of the
  hour when he had swooned, throwing out a dark hint which served to cast his
  suspicion on the physician. Domitian, however, was more inclined to look for
  the traitor among the employees of the city-prefect, than in the palace
  itself. At any rate, the zeal shown by Clodianus in these circumstances made
  an admirable impression in his favor. The Emperor began to think he might
  have been mistaken, and to consider whether the last addition to the list on
  the tablet should not after all be erased.</p>

  <p>Clodianus detected this revulsion of feeling with the eye of a
  clairvoyant, and it gave him extreme satisfaction, for it opened out the
  prospect for certain schemes, though he was not clear himself yet as to the
  details. When the pressure of business should allow him leisure, he would go
  to the villa on the road to Praeneste, intending to settle and confirm these
  details in concert with Stephanus.</p>

  <p>In the course of the afternoon it was reported that Caius Aurelius, too,
  was one of the fugitives. Baucis brought this news to the high-priest's
  house, when she returned from market in the Field of Mars.</p>

  <p>Not long before Claudia had received a note from Aurelius. It was dated
  the day before, and had been written before their last meeting. It contained
  the explanation, that Aurelius had thrown in his lot with those who were
  scheming and hoping for liberty. Their schemes had been betrayed. He was
  flying now like a criminal, but he hoped, ere long, to return and find Rome
  free and happy.</p>

  <p>Claudia had escaped with this letter to her own room, she knew only too
  well all it implied. She fancied she could already hear her father's verdict,
  for his tenderness to his child must now inevitably give way to the
  inexorable severity of a state-official and Caesar's faithful adherent.</p>

  <p>The rest of the family had meanwhile rushed into agitated discussion of
  this utterly unexpected departure. They were sitting in one of the larger
  rooms opening out of the court-yard, not far from the very spot where
  Aurelius, the night before, had torn himself from his Claudia. Quintus and
  Cornelia were present, as well as the parents and Lucilia. They had waited
  till long past midnight for Cinna's return, and had then parted in the utmost
  anxiety, for Aurelius' hasty visit, and the mysterious warning he had
  written, left them to surmise the worst. Thus they met at an early hour at
  the high-priest's house, whither each had come hoping for news and good
  counsel. Titus Claudius had, in fact, be^n informed of all that was known by
  Parthenius, and actually before he was up. He received Cornelia, who was in
  the highest excitement, with a mixture of severity and sympathy.</p>

  <p>"I do not know all the motives," he said solemnly, "that may have led to
  these measures on Caesar's part. But so much as this seems to me certain:
  that this step was prompted by necessity for the preservation of the State.
  As an officer of State myself, and as the father of your betrothed husband, I
  can only advise you&mdash;and I mean it well&mdash;to have nothing farther to
  do with a proscribed man. I promise you I will do my best to induce Caesar to
  give up all farther pursuit of the fugitives, and to consider banishment from
  the Empire, or perhaps only from Italy, as sufficient punishment."</p>

  <p>So spoke Titus Claudius, and then no more was said about Cinna. In the
  discussion as to Aurelius, Cornelia could take part more calmly than the
  others. Her pride had been roused by the Flamen's speech, and when this was
  the case, she was mistress of herself in all respects.</p>

  <p>When Claudia, having recovered such composure as she could, returned to
  the sitting-room, a single timid glance at her father's careworn face showed
  her, that his mind was already made up on the matter. His features revealed
  all the keen struggle and pain it cost him to inflict suffering on his
  daughter under the irresistible stress of circumstances; but, at the same
  time, she saw with perfect certainty that nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing
  &mdash;could change his idea of the necessity. His eye, which he kept calmly
  and immovably fixed on her, was so eloquent, that her cheek tingled, and she
  could hardly control herself so as not to throw herself sobbing into
  Lucilia's arms.</p>

  <p>"Forget that you ever loved such a man as Aurelius!" was what that sad
  gaze said to her. "I might have condescended to set aside the glory of my
  many centuries of ancestors and the dignity of my house, but never my honor
  as a guardian of the State. I might have sacrificed my pride&mdash;but not my
  duty. I could have borne to give my daughter to a youth of no renown, a mere
  provincial of obscure origin, hard as that would have been&mdash;but to a
  traitor! No, not if he wore the purple. Caius Aurelius is dead&mdash;dead to
  you, to me, to his country!"</p>

  <p>The only person, who in this depressing atmosphere did not lose her good
  spirits was Lucilia.</p>

  <p>"Who knows how all this hangs together?" she said consolingly. "Has not
  Sextus Furius been arrested? He surely is the very incarnation of peaceful
  civic virtue. Some low informer has slandered him secretly, and it is the
  same, I make no doubt, with Aurelius. I can quite understand, that he should
  have no fancy to exchange his pretty villa for a residence in a state-prison.
  But his innocence may yet come to light."</p>

  <p>"Nay," said the Flamen, "only those who are conscious flee. The man who
  knows that he is falsely accused stays where he is to justify himself."</p>

  <p>"I should think so indeed!" exclaimed Lucilia. "As if no innocent man had
  ever been condemned! I may say honestly, I should have done the same in his
  place. It is particularly unpleasant to watch a game, where one is oneself
  the stake played for. Only let us set to work at once to get at the bottom of
  the matter. If Aurelius were in truth a rebel, would not the chamberlain have
  mentioned him to you this morning, when he told you the names of those who
  had escaped and those who had been arrested?"</p>

  <p>"Parthenius was in a desperate hurry. He only mentioned the worst, the
  ringleaders. It may be indeed, that Aurelius has been led away... "</p>

  <p>"You see!" cried Lucilia, "and those who have been misled must be
  forgiven."</p>

  <p>"Forgiven!" echoed Cornelia. "Those may accept forgiveness who
  choose!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you, with your everlasting Roman pride 1 That was all very well under
  a Republic. For my part, sooner than wander about the world an outcast and in
  misery, I would admit what a fool I had been. You must progress as the times
  advance. The Empire is firmly established once and for all..."</p>

  <p>"You are wasting your breath, in trying to make a jest of what is grave
  earnest," said the high-priest. "I have been greatly deceived in this
  Aurelius. I took him to be frank and trustworthy, a man of character... "</p>

  <p>"Father!" cried Claudia, trembling^ from head to foot, "I will not bear to
  hear you speak so of the man, whom I regard as the noblest and truest on
  earth."</p>

  <p>"What, daughter? Even now, after his flight as a criminal?"</p>

  <p>"Even now."</p>

  <p>Quintus and Cornelia looked inquiringly, first at the priest, and then at
  the girl.</p>

  <p>"Why should I conceal it?" cried Claudia. "You may hear me say
  it&mdash;and all the world may know it&mdash;I love him, he is mine now and
  forever!"</p>

  <p>"Poor child!" said her father, and Lucilia went up to her and led her out
  of the room. In the solitude of her own room the strength, that had kept her
  blood at boiling point, gave way entirely. She flung herself into her
  sister's arms, and cried long and bitterly.</p>

  <p>The high-priest too retired, and shut himself up in his study till dinner-
  time. The information brought him by Parthenius, and the flight of Cinna and
  Aurelius more particularly, had been a great shock to him. And then the sight
  of the young creature, who stood up so bravely for her love&mdash;and
  yet&mdash;he could not hesitate&mdash;who must give it up forever. That had
  been a dagger-thrust in his heart. He struggled for firmness, for cold and
  stem resolve. He told himself that true kindness, in this case, lay in
  severity and outward hardness; every sign of wavering, every expression of
  tender impulse, would only make the inevitable harder for his child to bear.
  The human heart can better endure the sudden extinction of its happiness than
  its slow decline, fanned by the breath of a faint hope which is too weak to
  revive the flame of life, and yet too strong to allow it to die out.</p>

  <p>For many hours this man, who was usually so prompt and decisive, sat bent
  over his table as if in a trance. If Sextus Furius had not been one of the
  victims of this nocturnal raid, Titus Claudius would, even now, have arranged
  his daughter's betrothal to this suitor before the week was out. The very
  cruelty of such a proceeding seemed to him wholesome and bracing. But, as it
  was, Furius too&mdash;for some unimaginable reason&mdash; was an inmate of
  the Mamertine prisons. What was to be done? He considered the possibilities
  of a journey, and remembered that Quintus, the year before, had expressed a
  purpose some day to pass a few months at Athens. The house of Claudia had
  many illustrious friends in the Attic capital, who would have welcomed , the
  brother and sister with the greatest pleasure, and have treated them as
  lovingly and as liberally as their own. But the plan was rejected as soon as
  it was made. The unfavorable season was at hand; the south-westerly gale,
  which a few days since had swept over the whole coast of Latium and Campania,
  had devastated the country south of Antium. Sea-voyages were at an end for
  the season; no one would venture out to sea but under pressing necessity.</p>

  <p>Finally, the priest came to the conclusion, that Claudia would best and
  soonest get over her grief in her parent's house and the old familiar habits
  of her daily life; he, therefore, decided on leaving the poor child in peace,
  when once he had explicitly impressed on her that Aurelius was lost to her
  forever, and then tacitly treating the matter as settled once for all.</p>

  <p>The whole family eat their meal in conscious silence; Quintus and Cornelia
  remained as guests. Claudia begged to be excused; she would join them later,
  in the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>When they rose from table, Lucilia, Octavia, and the betrothed couple went
  to walk up and down the peristyle, and Titus Claudius went to his daughter's
  room. It was not without an uneasy feeling about his heart, that he desired
  the slave-girl who sat outside the door to raise the curtain, and he felt sad
  enough as he entered the room, which was one of the prettiest and pleasantest
  in the house. Claudia had made it a charming retreat for her studies and
  favorite pursuits. To the right lay the apartment she shared with Lucilia;
  but here she alone was mistress, and everything in the room seemed to have
  taken the stamp of her individuality. The unpretentious and tasteful
  furniture seemed to proclaim her frank simplicity. On the wall hung her gilt
  cithara with its red ribbon, the confidant of her hopes and dreams. There lay
  her favorite authors neatly arranged in ivory cases,<a href="#65">65</a> the
  Greeks to the left, the Latins to the right&mdash; above all Homer,
  Sophocles, and the odes of Sappho. There were a few costly vases of sardonyx,
  statuettes in Parian marble, and in a purple-lined niche a head of Jupiter,
  copied from the world-famed work of Phidias.<a href="#66">66</a></p>

  <p>There were too a silver-mounted spindle and a small hand-loom, besides all
  sorts of toys and baubles, such as young people were wont to give and receive
  during the Saturnalia. In short, the pretty bower betrayed itself in every
  detail as the retreat of a bright-natured, busy and happy girl.</p>

  <p>And now?</p>

  <p>But what was the priest's surprise when, instead of the crushed and
  weeping child he expected to meet, Claudia came towards him with gentle
  pride, grave, but mistress of herself, calm and almost radiant with a
  half-sad, but half-happy confidence.</p>

  <p>In the silence of her chamber Claudia had thought out the course of events
  and the issues they must lead to; she had questioned her own heart, and taken
  stock of her duties. The tangle had come straight, light had dawned in the
  darkness. It was useless to weep and puzzle herself over what could not be
  altered; it mattered not now to wonder whether Aurelius had acted wisely in
  taking part in the rash attempt of the conspirators. Nay, the right or wrong
  of the attempt itself was of secondary importance. One thing only Claudia was
  sure of: she loved him, and she was pledged to him. This had sealed her fate.
  As soon as this certainty stood forth clear and confessed in the midst of her
  sorrow, her peace of mind returned as if sent from heaven. She knew now how
  she must act, come what might now or in the future; she saw the goal towards
  which her whole existence strove, and she could wait in all submission, till
  the gods might point out a way in which she could walk. But that she would
  never look aside from that goal, that no power on earth could tear that love
  from her heart&mdash;that was as clear to her as her belief in love itself.
  Every blow, which could now fall on this hapless heart, would be the
  inevitable dealing of Fate, which neither gods nor men could evade. Claudia
  still hoped for some happy issue, even with her father; for the hopefulness
  of love is inexhaustible. But, if Fate would have it otherwise, it was quite
  clear to her that the issue must be worked out without her father&mdash;nay,
  if it came to the worst, against her father; and the sense of this
  possibility gave a melancholy undercurrent to her confident resolve.</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius misunderstood the signs of her face and manner; her calm
  decisiveness he took for the submission of an obedient daughter; her silent
  melancholy for the anguish of resignation. He went up to Claudia with an
  impulse of deep tenderness, took her in his arms, kissed her, and loaded her
  with tender commendation; she, ashamed and feeling almost guilty, submitted
  to his embrace. Then she raised her eyes in tearful entreaty to his face.</p>

  <p>"Let us speak no more of all this," she said in a low voice. "Time will
  show, whether he is guilty or not. You shall never hear a word of murmur from
  me. I will command myself; I will be just what I have always been&mdash;a
  little grayer perhaps, but not lackadaisical and pining. Only never speak of
  him, do not speak harshly of him! I cannot bear it. Father!"</p>

  <p>"You are my own good, wise child," whispered Claudius, holding her more
  closely in his arms. "I know you by this for my own flesh and blood. May
  Jupiter, in his goodness, give you strength to cast this luckless love out of
  your heart. I know, my child, we Claudians have a deep heart, and what has
  once sunk to the bottom there is apt to strike deep root in the soil. But
  nature has also given us a strong will, and a defiant spirit that fears no
  struggle. If you ever feel too miserable, if the fight is too much for you,
  then fly for rest to your father's heart, Claudia, and do not forget, that
  every grief that troubles yours I feel two-fold and three-fold in my own."
  Claudia wept aloud; overcome by her grief, she clung to that loving father's
  sheltering arms. Then, collecting all her firmness, she freed herself, looked
  up with a smile, and said, as she dried her tears:</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;I am myself again. Go to the others, pray. Father, and I will
  follow immediately."</p>

  <p>The Flamen left the room. Claudia threw herself on her knees, and after
  kissing the spot on the rug where he had stood, threw up her arms and her
  slender figure in passionate prayer to the gods.</p>

  <p>"Do not crush me, Immortals, if I am sinning!" she whispered with
  trembling lips. "For you know, ye all-merciful and all-wise, that I cannot
  help it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p>It was past midnight. The Christians of the Subura had once more assembled
  in the quarry between the Appian and the Labicanian Ways. Among them stood
  Quintus, who had joined the congregation to-day for the first time.</p>

  <p>The subterranean hall&mdash;not the small square Vault where Eurymachus
  had taken refuge, but a large oval space, whose natural roof was here and
  there supported by pillars of artificial construction&mdash;was lighted by a
  lamp with five arms, which hung from the smoke-blackened vault. On each side,
  close to the wall, a natural ledge of tufa served for seats. These were given
  up to women and girls, mostly very humbly dressed, while the men occupied the
  farther end of the hall, some standing, some sitting on wooden stools, and
  some squatting on the ground.</p>

  <p>Quintus was leaning, with eager, glistening eyes, against a pillar that
  was so built into a wall as to form a semicircular niche at one end of the
  hall, and opposite to him, against the corresponding pillar, stood Thrax
  Barbatus, his sinewy arms crossed over his breast.</p>

  <p>The attention of the congregation had at first been centered on
  Quintus&mdash;who was welcomed with astonishment as a member of the little
  band&mdash;but it had gradually been diverted to another object. Behind an
  arm- chair stood the tall and commanding figure of an old man, who looked
  ninety at least. His still upright bearing and his weather-tanned face showed
  him to be a soldier; and yet an expression of touching gentleness and
  benevolence marked his features, a melancholy and tender gleam, as it were,
  that played round his expressive lips and half-closed eyes. Those eyes were
  blind, darkened by the unwholesome gloom of the Sardinian mines,<a href=
  "#67">67</a> where, for three years, the old man had been buried alive. They
  were used to light, and to the free airs of heaven, those bright, bold
  warrior's eyes; and when Tigellinus,<a href="#68">68</a> Nero's favorite, had
  thrust him into blackness, because he had refused to tender false evidence,
  they grew fevered and dim in the twilight depths, and at last had darkened
  into endless night. The fall of Nero restored him to liberty. He had been
  taken on board ship by some kind-hearted mariners, carried first to Athens
  and then to Corinth, where his brethren in the faith received him gladly, and
  took charge of his maintenance. For some years he lived thus, a zealous
  member of the infant congregation, and a faithful guardian and preacher of
  the gospel. But at last he could contain himself there no longer. His
  homesickness for Rome, his native city, which he loved in spite of all her
  sins and crimes with the passion of a true-born Roman, grew more irresistible
  every day. An Egyptian merchant, who esteemed him highly, after taking him a
  long sea-voyage, brought him at last to the harbor of Ostia. For many weeks
  the venerable stranger had wandered in vain through all the fourteen regions
  of the city, hoping to find some friend of his early years; they were all
  without exception dead and gone. One day he sat down, sadly leaning on his
  staff, on the step of a fountain not far from the temple on the Quirinal.
  Here he was found by Euterpe, who, filled with pity, addressed the blind old
  man. They soon made the discovery that they were of the same faith, and now
  for five or six days he had been sharing the home of Diphilus; and though, at
  first, this had been somewhat of a burden to the carpenter, the liberality of
  Quintus Claudius had relieved him of all anxiety.</p>

  <p>Calenus was now telling the assembled Christians some of the adventures of
  his youth, when he was fighting in Palestine. Eager devoutness was stamped on
  every face that watched him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my beloved," he said, and his voice sank to deeper solemnity, "I can
  remember every detail as if it were yesterday. But I knew not what I was
  doing. My heart was holden, and my soul was darkened. It was not till long,
  long after, that the grace of God enlightened me... It was at the time when
  the Jews keep their Passover. Our division had been sent to guard the
  state-prison, but I and a few of my comrades had been warned to keep
  ourselves ready to march at any moment, and within an hour the word was given
  to set out. We joined a noisy procession, headed by the Roman eagles, which
  flowed on up the hill Where criminals are executed, outside Jerusalem. We
  could scarcely see or hear what was taking place, the people shrieked and
  howled so incessantly, evidently inflamed to the highest pitch by their
  priests and the scribes. However, we were ordered to let them have their way.
  At last, when I asked a woman what all the tumult was about, she replied:
  'They are going to crucify Jesus, the King of the Jews.'"</p>

  <p>He ceased and bowed his head, as one self-convicted, and a death-like
  silence reigned in the room.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my brethren!" he went on presently, in a tone of deep sorrow. "Would
  that some angel of God had been near in that awful hour to open my heart! In
  the ear of a heathen soldier, that name sounded like any other. Darkened and
  in ignorance, I kept guard on the spot where my Saviour was to die."</p>

  <p>Again he bowed his penitent head. But soon looking up again with renewed
  and joyful eagerness, he told them he had been mercifully permitted to see
  from afar the sublime face of the man, whom he had learned, years after, to
  recognize as the Redeemer of mankind. The pale features which had looked down
  on him, as in a vision, had been indelibly graven on his soul, and later,
  when the tidings of salvation had come home to him, the image had risen to
  new life, and shone radiantly upon him, like a star of promise, through the
  darkness of his sufferings and sorrows.</p>

  <p>When Calenus ceased speaking, no one for some time ventured to break the
  silence. Glauce, who was shedding quiet tears and recalling her dear
  Eurymachus, mixing up in her fancy the vision of the Nazarene with the
  picture of her lover, looked up at the speaker like a worshipper at his
  divinity. To the rest, indeed, the hoary old man, on whom a ray from that Sun
  had once fallen, appeared as a superior being, and presently, when the spell
  of silence was broken, they all crowded round him to kiss his hands with
  fervent devotion, or even the hem of his garment.</p>

  <p>The wonderful tale had made an almost weird impression upon Quintus. His
  fancy was haunted by the face of the pale sufferer, who, at that first
  meeting in Domitian's park, had stirred him to such new and unwonted
  feelings. A shudder, such as he had never felt before, shook him from head to
  foot, and his whole nature seemed to float away into the rarer air of
  incomprehensible mysticism.</p>

  <p>While the band of Christians sat listening in absorbed silence to the
  words of Calenus, a troop of armed men were setting forth from the
  Esquiline&mdash;twenty stout fellows armed with spears and short swords. They
  were led by a stalwart veteran, who had won the rank of centurion on the
  battle- fields of Germany; on his left walked a torch-bearer, on his right a
  handsome, active stripling&mdash;Antinous, the steward's slave. They marched
  to the south- east along the Via Labicana, and their regular tramp marked
  time on the pavement. Now and again a sword rattled or a piece of mail; now
  and again the leader muttered a short, sharp question, which the slave
  hastily answered. The ruddy light, that fell on his pretty girlish face, lent
  a witch-like effect to his features. It was thus that the Greek myth
  represented the beguiling Sirens: beautiful but fateful. The centurion
  himself was not quite at ease in the company of the supple youth, and he
  betrayed it not merely by the roughness of his address, but, even more, by
  his lowering brow, and the expression of aversion and contempt that curled
  his lips.</p>

  <p>At the spot where, on a former occasion, Quintus had come upon the road
  with Eurymachus in his Utter, the party halted. The centurion glanced keenly
  across the fields in the direction pointed out to him by Antinous, and he
  knew the country better than the Greek, whose only idea was to go in the same
  line as he had then come by, like a wild animal. After closely
  cross-questioning the slave, he made his men go forward by the road about
  five hundred paces farther, and thus reached a fairly-beaten bridle-path,
  nearly parallel to the line which Quintus had taken across hedge and ditch.
  They passed under the arches of the Aqua Marcia, again, soon after, under
  those of the Aqua Claudia, and then they were in view of the pine wood, which
  looked like a black, fantastically-shaped cloud against the sky.</p>

  <p>When the file of men were within a few paces of it, the torch was
  extinguished, as the uncovered light could not be carried through the
  brushwood, and a small horn-lantern was lighted instead. The centurion
  doubted whether he had not better leave some of his men outside. However, as
  the wood extended for a considerable distance to the south-east, there were
  objections to this plan. It would have taken half a legion to guard every
  possible exit as far as the spurs of the Alban Hills, and besides, Antinous
  asserted positively that they could reach the entrance to the quarry without
  any fear of discovery, as it was so effectually screened by the thicket, that
  the Nazarenes believed themselves to be in perfect security. In fact, they
  never even set a watch; so that he had lately ventured fifteen paces or more
  into the wide cross-gallery, without being detected.</p>

  <p>One after the other, the armed men entered the wood. Antinous had taken
  the lantern; in three minutes they were at the laurel bushes which screened
  the opening of the quarry; Antinous triumphantly parted the boughs.</p>

  <p>"Here!" he said proudly, "with a twist of your thumb you have them all as
  safe as hares in a trap."</p>

  <p>The little band of Christians, who were thus overtaken by their fate, were
  in the act of kneeling for a common prayer, when heavy steps and the rattle
  of arms were suddenly heard in the passage. All started in terror to their
  feet. A few instantly dropped on their knees again, wringing their hands. The
  women and girls clung to each other in despair. Some of the younger men, and
  with them Thrax Barbatus, assumed an air of sullen determination, which
  threatened desperate resistance on their part, while others stood motionless
  and unmoved in dull resignation. Among them there were a few faces that
  beamed with the transport of sacred ecstasy, and Quintus and Calenus were
  perhaps the only two, who betrayed no sign in their faces of what was passing
  in their minds. Before it was possible even to think of flight, the old
  centurion was standing in the door-way, his drawn sword gleaming ominously;
  behind him shone the helmets of his men-at-arms.</p>

  <p>A loud cry rose from the congregation; Thrax Barbatus flung off his cloak,
  and drew the dagger he had concealed under it.</p>

  <p>"Whoever tries to escape is a dead man!" shouted the soldier, giving a
  sign to his men. In a minute they were ranged round the hall to the right and
  left.</p>

  <p>Quintus, who was likewise armed, grasped his sword-hilt convulsively. He
  glanced round at the little congregation; the fight would be too unequal,
  simply ridiculous, but he felt he must attempt it. His sword flashed from its
  sheath; but at that instant Antinous sprang upon him from one side and, with
  the strength of desperation, clutched his right arm. Before Quintus could
  shake him off he was surrounded by soldiers, his weapon was wrenched from
  him, and six or eight sinewy hands held his arms and shoulders with the grip
  of a vice. The centurion came up to him with his sword point downwards.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he said, "you see&mdash;resistance is hopeless."</p>

  <p>"What do you want of us?" asked Quintus, with a defiant sparkle in his
  glance.</p>

  <p>"My lord, you know."</p>

  <p>"And do you know me?"</p>

  <p>"Who that lives in Rome can fail to know the son of Titus Claudius?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;and yet you seize me as if I were a thief?"</p>

  <p>"I am doing my duty&mdash;I am seeking the Nazarenes."</p>

  <p>"And you have found them!" exclaimed Antinous, still breathless from his
  exertions.</p>

  <p>"Who is this boy?" asked Quintus, with a feeling of unutterable
  loathing.</p>

  <p>"I? I am Antinous, Stephanus' boy," he answered audaciously. "I bring you
  my master's greetings, and"&mdash;he added in a whisper&mdash;" those of your
  imperial neighbor, the lady of Baiae..."</p>

  <p>"Silence!" said the centurion, sternly. "You have done your part! Take
  yourself off&mdash;instantly."</p>

  <p>Quintus breathed hard and deep. He understood only too well all that the
  impudent young villain's words conveyed. The captain did not give him much
  time to indulge his feelings.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he said, "you are my prisoner. If you will swear to me not to
  attempt to escape, nor to lay violent hands upon yourself, I will take the
  risk of leaving you unfettered. This one, however, I must put in chains, and
  if you have any influence over him, advise him that he had better submit
  quietly."</p>

  <p>"Never!" roared Thrax Barbatus, flourishing his short sword. "Let us
  fight, my brethren&mdash;fight, and die fighting. The martyr's crown awaits
  not those alone who suffer, but those who fight too."</p>

  <p>"Cease!" said old Calenus. "Who dares to speak so blasphemously here? Will
  you sin as Peter sinned in the garden or Gethsemane? Will you shed your
  brother's blood like Cain? Woe unto ye blind! Not thus may ye win Heaven, but
  eternal punishment!" The blind man's words, spoken in a sort of prophetic
  exaltation, made a deep impression. Those who a moment since had stood forth
  in defiance, now bent their heads. Thrax Barbatus alone stood his ground.</p>

  <p>"Do you think," he shouted in a voice of thunder, "that the Son of God,
  who lashed the dealers and money-changers out of the Temple with a scourge,
  was a lamb? He was a lion, that only force could overcome! The Saviour
  preached to slaves, that their lives and their rights are as precious as
  those of their tyrants! He, who breaks the chains of the prisoner, will have
  nothing to say to cowards and fools. Glauce, come close to me&mdash;your
  tender body shall never be meat for the lions of Gaetulia! Pray,
  Glauce&mdash;pray.&mdash;And may the Lord Jesus Christ have mercy upon
  us!"</p>

  <p>He held the girl tightly clasped in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Give yourselves up to the inscrutable counsels of God!" said the solemn,
  prophetic voice of the blind man.</p>

  <p>"Amen!" rose from the lips of the congregation.</p>

  <p>"Put them in chains," the centurion said. But Quintus, with calm dignity,
  requested a hearing.</p>

  <p>"One word," he said, turning to the centurion. "That scurvy slave has
  misled you. I swear to you on my honor, centurion, this nocturnal surprise
  was only intended for me. Here I am, take me with you! I will follow you;
  carry me in chains to the city, and you may be perfectly certain, that you
  have all the prey you need show. But these poor wretches, who stand here
  trembling as to their fate&mdash;let them go free; let them go on their way
  unhindered. They only came here to see for the last time the halls where they
  have, until now, celebrated the rites of their faith. They have no intention
  of defying the law."</p>

  <p>"Who is there here that will deny his Saviour?" Again it was the blind
  prophet that spoke. "We are faithful to confess Christ crucified. His name be
  praised and blessed forever!"</p>

  <p>Quintus was silent, and a shade of deep trouble fell on his face.</p>

  <p>"Well, then," he said, turning away, "do your duty."</p>

  <p>The mercenaries pushed forward. The Christians, none of whom were armed
  except Thrax and Quintus, submitted at once. Thrax alone withdrew farther and
  farther into the niche; his left arm still held up Glauce, who leaned only
  half- conscious on his shoulder, and in his right he still clutched the
  dagger. The soldiers came up with him.</p>

  <p>"Come, old man, make short work of it!" cried the foremost. "You see there
  are a score of us."</p>

  <p>Close to Thrax and Glauce Euterpe was kneeling by a pillar. In her wild
  anguish she had thrown her arms round the cold stone, and was murmuring
  vehement prayers. Now, looking up a moment, a shrill and piercing shriek
  broke from her lips, and she fell backwards on the earth, where she lay
  senseless. Instead of answering the soldier, Thrax Barbatus had raised the
  dagger, and thrust it to the very hilt in Glance's side. The two men, even,
  stood petrified at the sight of such a deed, while Thrax gently laid the
  slender body on the ground. Tears streamed down his rugged cheeks. Even in
  death the poor child smiled&mdash;shivered.&mdash;All was over.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," muttered the miserable father. "No executioner will ever
  harm you now. Come on, accursed crew, and lay me by the side of my sweet
  Glauce."</p>

  <p>He rushed headlong on one of the men, who avoided the stroke, and tried to
  seize his assailant round the body. But in vain; a mightier blow fell upon
  his helmet, and stunned him. He staggered backwards.</p>

  <p>"Old fool!" cried the other soldier. "Fling away that dagger, or by
  Hercules..."</p>

  <p>"Thrax, miserable man! For Christ's sake!" A score of voices appealed to
  him at once. But Thrax had raised the blade again, and charged the foe like a
  lion.</p>

  <p>"Well, he will have it!" said the soldiers, now falling upon him from all
  sides.</p>

  <p>The next instant Thrax Barbatus fell, pierced by three swords at once, on
  the ground by Glance's side. Not a groan of pain parted his set lips, not a
  throe, not a sign, betrayed the pain of such a death; only his hand feebly
  felt for Glance's.</p>

  <p>Quintus gazed down at the dead.</p>

  <p>"Would I might have died so!" he said to himself. "Almighty God, Thy will
  be done."</p>

  <p>"Now, men&mdash;are you ready?" cried the centurion, sheathing his
  weapon.</p>

  <p>"As you say."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then; away to the city! * Give over crying, you women. A crime
  was never yet atoned for by howling and wailing. Onwards&mdash;march!"</p>

  <p>And the long and melancholy procession set out. None remained behind but
  the dead&mdash;the free and happy dead.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p>The company of soldiers, who had been sent by the city-prefect in pursuit
  of the Batavian and his companions, had given up the chase at a short
  distance from Ardea. They rode slowly into the town, and rapped with their
  sword-hilts at the door of the little old tavern till the innkeeper crept
  grumpily out of his bed, and let them in. A stable boy unsaddled the horses,
  while Ciconia, the host's unprepossessing wife, brought out a dish of smoked
  cheese,<a href="#69">69</a> some loaves, and a jar of red wine from Veii.</p>

  <p>While his men sat round the stone table and burned their parched throats
  with coarse liquor, the captain walked up and down the room reflecting with
  little satisfaction indeed on the events of the night. He wondered why the
  fugitives had selected the road through Ardea. The Via Appia would have been
  wider, more convenient, and safer for strangers unfamiliar with the district,
  while the road to Ardea, with its many inequalities and turnings, would seem
  to give the pursuers, who were more familiar with them, an appreciable
  advantage. The more he thought of it, the more convinced he became that
  Antium must have been the goal of their hopes. But, in that case, the
  refugees must have intended to sail from Antium and reach one of the
  neighboring islands, or perhaps even Sardinia or Corsica. And in that case it
  would not be difficult to find out who had undertaken to convey them. Thus
  all was not yet lost. He took up a cup of wine and emptied it at a draught.
  Then, turning to the hostess, he asked in great excitement: "Ciconia, have
  you a horse?" "No, my lord; what do you want it for?" "I must get on to
  Antium immediately, and our beasts are tired to death." Ciconia
  reflected.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "there is a horse, no doubt, in the
  stable&mdash;standing there since noon. It belongs to a trader out of
  Metapontum<a href="#70">70</a>&mdash;but I do not know whether he would allow
  it."</p>

  <p>"He must; or, better still, why should he ever know it? I shall be back
  again in a few hours. I will leave all our horses in pledge with you, and pay
  for your nasty verjuice as if it were Falernian. Make no ceremony."</p>

  <p>In five minutes the Metapontine trader's steed stood saddled and bridled
  at the door. It was a small, square-set brute, but strong. The soldier
  mounted, desired his men to await his return, and set off at a round
  pace.</p>

  <p>Shortly before reaching Antium he met two riderless horses, one of which
  he at once recognized as that of his wounded comrade. There could no longer
  be a doubt; the fugitives were trusting to the sea. With renewed energy he
  struck spurs into his horse, and had soon got over the few hundred paces that
  still lay between him and the harbor. Here, however, there was nothing to be
  seen or heard. He rode all round the bay and back again, keeping &auml; sharp
  lookout. The ships lay motionless by the mole&mdash;the barges and
  shore-boats in the middle, farther out the larger merchant-vessels, and away
  to the left the imperial trireme, which through the summer months had cruised
  in search of pirates about the coasts of Egypt and Cyrenaica.<a href=
  "#71">71</a> All was as silent as the dead, excepting when, now and then, the
  night-breeze whistled through the cordage.</p>

  <p>Then he stopped awhile, and gazed out to sea&mdash;not a speck was to be
  seen on the starlit expanse so far as the eye could reach. He was beginning
  to think that he had been wrong in his calculations, and was about to take
  his way back again in a very provoked frame of mind, when an unhoped-for
  incident arrested him in the very act. Was it the uncertain twilight that
  cheated his sight? The large barque at the farthest end of the harbor seemed
  to be slowly moving, and then he heard the distant stroke of oars. At the
  same moment he sprang from his saddle, and thundered with a powerful fist at
  the door of the nearest house.</p>

  <p>"A boat!" he shouted as the bewildered door-keeper opened to him. "In the
  name of the city-prefect I must row at once to the imperial guard-ship."</p>

  <p>"My lord, you are under a mistake," said the slave not very civilly. "We
  are neither boat-keepers nor oarsmen. Euterpius lives here, the harbor-
  master."</p>

  <p>"So much the better. Take me to your master immediately, if you want to
  keep your head on your shoulders, fellow."</p>

  <p>Such a mode of address admitted of no denial; the harbor-master himself
  understood that the case was no common one, and in ten minutes he and the
  soldier were seated side by side in a light boat. They soon reached the
  imperial trireme, which at once took them on board, and the soldier explained
  in breathless haste how matters stood. The captain of the ship, a man of
  prompt determination, at once gave orders for sailing after the fugitives.
  While the soldiers made ready for a fight, the sailors weighed anchor and
  hauled in the chains. The oarsmen took their seats, the coxswain's hammer
  gave the stroke, and they were off in chase.</p>

  <p>The Batavian's trireme had a good start; it was now but a speck,
  motionless as it seemed, on the north-western horizon.</p>

  <p>It was not till nearly an hour later, that any one discovered on board the
  Batavia that they were being chased, and it was Magus' eagle eye that made
  the unpleasant discovery. Keeping a bright lookout landward from the stem, he
  perceived that a dark object, which he at first thought to be part of the
  buildings above the harbor, was a vessel in motion. Its starting at so
  unusual an hour, and still more, the direction it was taking, roused his
  suspicions. Magus confessed his fears to Caius Aurelius, and, in the dawn
  which was now breaking, his master saw clearly the danger of their position.
  The conspirators&mdash;who after exchanging greetings had separated, some to
  rest, and some, wrapped in cloaks, like Aurelius himself, to pace the
  deck&mdash;were soon assembled to hold council in that centre-cabin, which,
  to Aurelius, had a peculiar sanctity, as having been the scene of his first
  meeting with Claudia. The steersman was called in, and Magus remained on deck
  to find out what more he might.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," the Batavian began, "for having, under stress of
  circumstances, disturbed your slumbers. You have heard of the new danger
  which threatens us. It is a trireme, and, to judge from the speed she is
  making, well manned."</p>

  <p>"Then we must pull for our lives," said Ulpius Trajanus. "A fight would be
  useless."</p>

  <p>"I know the ship," said Cornelius Cinna, addressing the Hispanian. "It is
  the Charybdis, which has been in chase of pirates all the summer, off the
  coast of Cyrenaica. It was the only imperial vessel lying off Antium. She is
  well manned&mdash;no doubt of that; but only when she is on service. At the
  end of the season the soldiers go on shore to do other duty, or take leave of
  absence. There are very few left on board during the winter."</p>

  <p>"If I understand Aurelius rightly, he spoke of the rowers, not of the
  fighting men," replied Trajanus. "And as the oarsmen are in full numbers,
  leave has probably not yet begun."</p>

  <p>"Nay, you are mistaken. The oarsmen work at day in the harbor, but the law
  compels them to pass the night on board. I do not wish to fight! I only meant
  to say that, if it came to the worst, the battle is not so hopeless as you
  think, particularly as Caius Aurelius has arms on board for half a cohort of
  soldiers. So, if Fate will have it that we are not to escape scot-free, we
  can, at any rate, give the foe a warm reception."</p>

  <p>"Of course, of course," cried Trajanus. "None but a coward yields without
  a struggle. However, our surest hope, I believe, is founded on the strength
  of the oarsmen. We must not forget the sheathed rostrum! Our Batavia is a
  splendid ship, and, Aurelius assures me, has a three-fold coating of timber,
  but how often has it happened that the strongest vessels have been pierced
  and sunk by a well-directed thrust from the prow of the enemy&mdash;and the
  imperial guard- ships are admirably armed. What will the most splendid
  courage avail us then? I would propose, therefore, that the rowers' seats are
  at once manned by the very best of your oarsmen."</p>

  <p>"That has already been done, my lord!" said the steersman. "And as regards
  the foe*s rostrum, I confess I do not share your fears. If we fail to escape,
  we can but turn round. Then, prow to prow&mdash;two can play at that game,
  and we shall see who is sunk first. We are not accustomed, it is true, to
  manoeuvre like a man-of-war, but the Batavia answers her helm as a fish turns
  with its tail, and that is the great thing."</p>

  <p>He had hardly spoken, when Magus appeared.</p>

  <p>"They are gaining on us. As I reckon, they have twenty oars more than the
  Batavia."</p>

  <p>"You hear!" exclaimed Cinna, springing from his seat. "There is no farther
  time for deliberation. Let each man be assigned his part at once."</p>

  <p>"You then must be general of the forces," said Nerva quietly. "Many are
  better at laying plans than you are, but in carrying them out you are
  unequalled."</p>

  <p>"Agreed," said Cneius Afranius. "Our new Rome, met here on board the
  Batavia, invests Cinna with the dignity of Dictator."</p>

  <p>"I accept your jest as of good augury," replied Nerva. "Our new Rome is
  indeed in the hour of its birth, and it is our part to see that it shall
  thrive and grow. Good! Now, Dictator, summon the troops."</p>

  <p>Cinna's orders were soon issued. All the oarsmen were armed; those who
  were rowing, as well as those who were resting below till their turn came at
  the oars. Nor did the trireme lose ground while these preparations were being
  made; a sword and a small round shield were laid at the feet of each rower,
  without stopping him in his pull; they could not yet give up all hope of
  escape. If it became hopeless, the rowers were to cease at the word of
  command, to rest till the enemy was close upon them, and then pull again till
  the Charybdis was within grappling range. At the instant when the enemy's
  boarding- planks were thrust across over the grappling-hooks,<a href=
  "#72">72</a> the men were to seize their arms and await the commands of
  Ulpius Trajanus, who would lead them on deck.</p>

  <p>Nerva himself, stepping from bench to bench, issued these instructions to
  the rowers. Dimly lighted by the ruddy gleam of a flickering lamp and by the
  twilight of dawn, the tall, majestic figure, with long silver hair, made a
  singular impression on the crew.</p>

  <p>These men, who sat and steadily dipped their oars, were for the most part
  of Teutonic origin, natives of the Rhine provinces and the north-east of
  Germany&mdash; rough and primitive creatures, hardly understanding the Latin
  tongue&mdash;indeed Magus had to interpret to them their illustrious
  commander's orders. But one thing they perfectly understood, their beloved
  master, Caius Aurelius, was in the utmost peril, and the proud but gentle old
  man, who passed down their ranks, was a friend of Aurelius and a partner in
  his danger. This was enough. They glanced down at the weapons, and were
  almost glad to think their strength would be tested at some other toil than
  pulling their oars. And then it was for Caius Aurelius! Was there in all the
  Roman Empire a knight, who treated his people with so much
  kindness&mdash;nay, with so much friendliness? What a jolly time they had
  just spent at Ostia! The long voyage from Trajectum, to be sure, had been a
  severe pull, but how handsomely he had rewarded them, and what perfect
  liberty they had enjoyed while the Batavia lay at anchor. Well, he took after
  his worthy father&mdash;stern when duty was to be attended to, but, though
  strict, never hard; open-handed, and never without a kind thought for the
  humblest of his slaves. That was what the old merchant had been, and his son
  was the same...</p>

  <p>While the rowers were indulging in these reflections and expressing their
  views in whispers, the men off duty were posted ready for action on the
  forepart of the deck, with Cornelius Cinna himself at their head. He desired
  the Batavian to remain with the ship's servants in the cabins till the moment
  of attack. Nerva&mdash;and this was unanimously agreed to by all the
  conspirators&mdash;in consideration of his advanced age&mdash;was entreated
  to remain in the hold of the vessel, till the battle was decided. But the old
  man stoutly refused; he still had vigor enough, he said, to wield a blade,
  and a man was never too old to die for freedom by the side of brave comrades.
  So Cocceius Nerva was told off to the division under Aurelius&mdash;only as a
  private soldier, for he positively refused to command. Cneius Afranius and
  the old, one-armed centurion took their places by Cinna, somewhat as his
  adjutants or lieutenants.</p>

  <p>All this time they had rowed steadily ahead. To the east, over Latium, it
  grew lighter every minute. The elaborate rigging of the imperial trireme was
  now distinctly visible, for its sails, like those of the Batavia, were close-
  reefed, the wind being contrary. The three ranks of oars on each side rose
  and fell like broad black wings. There was no longer any doubt. She was
  gaining on them. Her oarsmen outnumbered those of the Batavia, not by twenty
  only, but by thirty or more. Aurelius measured with his eye the fast
  diminishing distance between them, not without a feeling of apprehension. On
  board both vessels there was absolute silence; nothing broke the stillness of
  the dawn but the splash of the oars' blades in the water and the
  hammer-strokes of the time- keepers. Not another vessel was to be seen on the
  calm lead-colored waste. In all this vast and desert expanse the only living
  thing was that embodiment of stealthy and vindictive hatred!...</p>

  <p>It was a ghastly thought, and he shivered.</p>

  <p>Another quarter of an hour went by, and the most persistently hopeful
  could no longer dream of escape. Cornelius Cinna gave the word; the Batavia
  turned round and the oars ceased to lash the waves. The Charybdis immediately
  slackened her tremendous speed, evidently in order to put on a final spurt
  for a killing thrust. She came nearer and nearer, till within about three
  hundred paces. Then the rowers suddenly fell to with all their force; the
  ship made a half-turn and rushed with furious might on the Batavia, which was
  lying still. But Chrysostomus, her steersman, was an experienced seaman. With
  five or six strokes she turned sharply round, and the Charybdis shot by,
  close to along- side but harmless.</p>

  <p>She turned back at once; the Batavia was again lying to in watchful
  expectation, her gleaming rostrum threatening the foe, and the Charybdis was
  not far enough off to repeat her attack with any effect. She now took another
  line of action. She pulled slowly and peacefully to within a speaking
  distance of the Batavia. The city-prefect's captain came to the bulwarks with
  the ship's commander and roared out to them, in the tone of a conqueror, to
  give up their useless resistance and return to Antium.</p>

  <p>"And who are you?" asked Cinna contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"A servant of Caesar's and a guardian of the insulted majesty of the
  law."</p>

  <p>"Or else a pirate<a href="#73">73</a>..."</p>

  <p>"A foolish subterfuge!&mdash;You know the sovereign's guard-ship; aye, as
  well as I know the face of a rebel. Are not you Cinna, the eloquent advocate
  of the Nazarenes?"</p>

  <p>Cinna did not fail to observe that, during this colloquy, the Charybdis,
  stealthily, worked only by the stern-most oars, was creeping nearer and
  nearer. This was exactly what he had hoped for. If only they would grapple!
  If only they would board. A fight on the decks of the Batavia was, of all the
  chances open to them, by far the most promising; their knowledge of the
  vessel, and particularly of its trap-doors and ladders would be a precious
  advantage. Cinna therefore judged it wise to parley a little longer with the
  enemy, that he might be deluded into believing that his scheme was not
  perceived or understood.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;that is my name!" he shouted back. "And who in the world has
  any right to dog my movements and detain me here?"</p>

  <p>"Caesar and the law," replied the soldier. "Do not resist, but trust
  rather to Caesar's clemency than to the issue of an unequal battle."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand your meaning. Cornelius Cinna sails for
  Liguria<a href="#74">74</a>&mdash;What spite is this, that dares to hinder
  his doing so?"</p>

  <p>The warrior exchanged a few words with the ship's captain.</p>

  <p>"Is not Caius Aurelius Menapius on board?" he asked after a short
  pause.</p>

  <p>"Not to my knowledge. Now, make an end of this insolent catechising. I owe
  you no account of my proceedings, and I demand a free passage&mdash;or, by
  Pluto!"</p>

  <p>Magus, meanwhile, without speaking a word, had run down to the armory.
  There he seized a sharp axe, which he tried on the panel of the cabin, and
  then took the heft firmly between his teeth. While Cornelius Cinna stood
  disputing with the officer, our friend the Goth glided like a weasel through
  the port- hole near the rudder, and slid softly into the sea. For a few
  seconds he lay floating on his back, breathing deeply through the nostrils;
  then he dived in the clear blue water and came up again close to the rudder
  of the unsuspecting Charybdis. Again he drew a deep breath; then, swimming
  with his left hand, he took the axe in his right, and with two or three
  mighty blows he severed the rope by which the rudder was worked.<a href=
  "#75">75</a> a broad smile of satisfaction shone on his tanned face; he
  dropped the axe into the sea and made his way back to the Batavia.</p>

  <p>The Goth was out of reach before the enemy's crew fully understood their
  disaster. The harpoons and lances they flung after him missed their mark, and
  he got on board unhurt.</p>

  <p>Chrysostomus, the steersman, had at the same time handled his ship very
  cleverly. The Batavia was now in a position, on her part, to run the foe
  through the flank with her iron-shod beak so effectually, that he would never
  have made his way home, for with a loose rudder the Charybdis was of course
  defenceless. Cinna, however, would not hear of this. He would have fought for
  freedom&mdash;he would not fight for revenge.</p>

  <p>Three blows of the hammer, the Batavia's oars dipped deeply in the waves
  and she rode majestically away to the westward. The Charybdis did not even
  attempt to chase her.</p>

  <p>The soldier and the captain of the vessel foamed with rage. They had been
  so sure of their prey, and it had slipped through their fingers when they
  thought they held it fast. It was their confidence, which had led to their
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>Cornelius Cinna leaned thoughtfully over the taff-rail, gazing at the
  Charybdis as she diminished to a speck, for she had taken a homeward course
  to Antium. Strange thoughts filled his brain. Was it so easy as this, to make
  a proud and well-armed vessel incapably helpless? One bold stroke, and she
  had become unmanageable&mdash;was it not the same perhaps with the vessel of
  State?<a href="#76">76</a> Could it be so difficult to deal a blow at that
  ship's rudder, to board the drifting barque and to pull it at last into the
  haven of freedom and peace, there to be freshly fitted and manned for a
  happier voyage in the future?</p>

  <p>Magus, of course, was the hero of the hour. He was loaded with thanks and
  praises, his master embraced him warmly, and gifts were showered upon him;
  but the honest fellow seemed hardly to understand why so much was made of his
  achievement. What was the difference, whether he hung over a precipice on
  some northern shore to gather a rare plant from the rock, or cut his way
  through the Rugian forests to cast a net over the horns of the aurochs, or
  climbed to the topmost branches of a primeval oak, or&mdash;as he had just
  done&mdash;swam a few paces to thwart a foe? It was all instinctive
  prompting, nothing meritorious or remarkable.</p>

  <p>The rowers set to work with a will, notwithstanding that the imperial
  trireme was now disabled. The coast was still too close for them to feel sure
  whence or by whom the pursuit might not be taken up.</p>

  <p>I After a short council, they decided on taking a course between the
  little islands of Planasia and Ilva,<a href="#77">77</a> north of Corsica, to
  the coast of Gallia Narbonensis, and then to cast anchor in the most
  unfrequented bay they could find; Athenopolis<a href="#78">78</a> perhaps, or
  Olbia.<a href="#79">79</a> From thence, either separately or together, they
  could make their way into the interior, and reach Gallia Lugdunensis, where a
  large number of troops were stationed, some in scattered fortresses, and some
  in the chief town of the province, Lugdunum on the Rhodanus.<a href=
  "#80">80</a> Rodumna, on the Liger, the native town of Afranius, was still to
  be the central point of meeting on a particular day, to be fixed later,
  unless the conspiracy should through some unforeseen occurrence be broken
  up.</p>

  <p>It had now long been day. The fugitives, quite tired out, retired to their
  couches; Aurelius only still found something to do. First he went to
  Herodianus' cabin; he had taken himself to bed as soon as he had come on
  board, and all the bustle of the last hour or two had not waked him. He now
  lifted up a bruised and swollen face, and complained of severe pain. His fall
  on the way had shaken him considerably. Aurelius helped him to move, and then
  applied a bandage and a herb poultice to his arm and shoulder, and in five
  minutes the patient was asleep again.</p>

  <p>Aurelius, however, still could not rest. He went next to the fugitive
  entrusted to his protection by Quintus Claudius: Eurymachus. He found him
  excited, pale, and breathless. He was in a high fever, and sitting up in bed.
  Through the half-opened port-hole of his cabin he had listened in alarm to
  the mysterious confusion and noise; he imagined that the pursuit had been on
  his account, and it had distressed him beyond measure to think that the
  magnaminous Aurelius should be involved in his hapless fate. When the
  Batavian had reassured him on this point, he fell back on his pillows with a
  few words of gratitude. A sort of ague fit shook his frame, and his teeth
  chattered as if with cold.</p>

  <p>"How strange," said Aurelius to himself. "This man, who is so indifferent
  to danger for himself, is ready to die with anxiety for the safety of his
  preserver!"</p>

  <p>He went back to his own room, and threw himself, wrapped in his cloak as
  he was, on the outside of his bed. He tried to recall all the events of the
  last twenty-four hours, but his thoughts became confused. He seemed to see a
  sweet maiden form stooping over him&mdash;to see her smile and feel her kiss
  his forehead. "Claudia!" he sighed and shivered; then he fell quite
  asleep&mdash;and he was at Baiae,in the quiet, peaceful garden, far from the
  world of hatred, tyranny, and persecutions. A lovely dream! as distinct from
  the realities of the present, as a bright star in the dark vault of night</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p>All this time the wily Barbillus had not been idle. He knew too well the
  whole meaning of a wish of Domitian's, particularly when the wish was
  expressed in such a manner, as his desire to conquer Cornelia had been.
  Besides, the priest had only too much reason to fear the Emperor, in relation
  to his high pretensions to prophetic powers. More than once had Domitian
  shown his aversion to Chaldaeans, mathematicians, and seers generally, and
  had banished them from Rome by special edicts. These edicts might at any
  moment be turned against Barbillus, even though he also officiated as the
  priest of a tolerated faith, and hitherto had had no cause to dread his
  imperial patron, whom he had found means to amuse and manage. Again, and
  above all, his vanity was at stake; he felt the failure of the
  elaborately-contrived mummery as personally humiliating, and longed to purge
  himself of the charge of clumsiness in the Emperor's eyes.</p>

  <p>On the following day, therefore, he set to work again, and began to
  reconnoitre the ground. His spies, under a variety of excuses, made their way
  into Cornelius' house, eavesdropping and bribing the slaves. Now as a Syrian
  yam-seller, now as a shipwrecked sailor humbly praying the ostiarius to admit
  him to shelter, or as a dealer in Egyptian charms&mdash;one or another of the
  indefatigable Oriental's tools contrived to see and hear something, without
  their presence being thought strange in a house where so many came and went.
  Thus Barbillus learned many details as to Cornelia's habits and mode of life,
  which might possibly prove of use, though he did not as yet see the
  connection they would have with his schemes.</p>

  <p>However, the results of this system of espionage seemed more tangibly
  satisfactory when, on the second day after beginning operations, there was
  put into his hands the note which Caius Aurelius had written and left on the
  occasion of his nocturnal visit.</p>

  <p>The slave-girl, who had not parted with it for anything less than gold,
  declared that she had plainly seen and heard Cornelia, when she took it from
  the Batavian and promised to deliver it to her uncle. Since it could hardly
  be doubted that it was a precautionary warning from a fellow-conspirator, it
  would not be difficult to make it appear that Cornelia must be a party to the
  plot. To an unprejudiced judge, it was indeed self-evident that Cornelia had
  no suspicion of the importance of this bit of writing; otherwise she would
  have taken better care of it, and would not have been so foolish as to leave
  it lying by the lamp when she went to bed. But all that Barbillus wanted was
  some valid excuse for a hold over the young girl.</p>

  <p>When the note was put into his hands, the day was already waning. It was
  that same eventful day when, in the morning, the Batavian had so happily
  escaped, and at night the Christians were doomed to surprise and seizure.
  Barbillus decided not to waste an instant; he hurried off to the
  chamberlain^s house, where, after some ceremony on the part of the servants,
  he succeeded in gaining admission.</p>

  <p>The courtier was entertaining a highly select circle. They had just risen
  from a magnificent supper, and he had conducted his guests into a handsomely-
  decorated room, where a variety of entertainments were provided for them.
  Some, heated with their potations of fine wines, went out into the cooler air
  of the peristyle; among these were Parthenius himself and Clodianus, who
  stood eagerly talking to the master of the feast.</p>

  <p>"Come&mdash;let us talk no more of business," said Parthenius, half in
  earnest and half in jest, when Clodianus paused for a moment. "I assure you,
  my noble friend, I am almost overwhelmed when I think of the work before us.
  I am half afraid, that with all these arrests we have loaded ourselves with a
  burden that we can hardly carry."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the adjutant coolly.</p>

  <p>"Only think! the flower of the Senate and the Knights! It will hardly be
  wise to punish so many and such illustrious captives with death. Merely to
  banish them would be to endanger the Caesar's power..."</p>

  <p>"Then keep them in prison till further notice."</p>

  <p>"That will not do either. Do you suppose then, that their relations and
  friends would sit with their hands before them? It would be putting a
  dangerous weapon into the enemy's hands."</p>

  <p>"Really, Parthenius, you talk as if the throne were already tottering.
  What can the anger of the accused, or the disaffection of their allies matter
  to us? Is not the Palatium strong enough? Are not our soldiers faithful? Is
  not Caesar one with all the true feelings of his people?"</p>

  <p>"Again I say, put off all serious discussion till to-morrow," replied the
  chamberlain, offering his hand to the adjutant. "The duties of a host now
  claim my attention..."</p>

  <p>At this moment a servant led the way for a priest of Isis.</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Barbillus, bowing, "I have come on the business you know
  of. Caesar commissioned me..."</p>

  <p>"Ah! now I recognize you!" exclaimed Parthenius after looking at him
  closely for a moment "You are Barbillus, the stage-manager and prompter at
  the Temple of Isis. Charmed, by the gods, I am sure!"</p>

  <p>Barbillus, who was not particularly pleased at this reception, looked down
  in embarrassment. He did not know whether to take up a jesting tone in reply,
  or to try to be dignified and haughty; so as to impress the adjutant, at any
  rate, even if it were impossible with the chamberlain, who was cognizant of
  his miserable failure.</p>

  <p>"Do you recollect," continued Parthenius, turning to Clodianus with a
  meaning glance, "that charming creature, whose coarse-fisted slave had the
  audacity... "</p>

  <p>"To be sure. Caesar told me of that wonderful intrigue. I always used to
  be his right-hand man in such little affairs."</p>

  <p>"Then you know the lovely joke about the mask of Osiris?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. But let this man speak; he is evidently in a hurry."</p>

  <p>"You are right," said Barbillus with dignified calm. "In spite of the
  inconvenient hour I have ventured to disturb the illustrious Parthenius, in
  order to inform him that I have found the ways and means..."</p>

  <p>"My friend," interrupted the chamberlain, "I see there my falsehood
  Latinus, the actor, who is looking anxiously for me. Every second of my time
  is precious. Clodianus, would you have the kindness to hear what this worthy
  priest has to say, and in case of need to give him your always valuable
  advice. Then, when my actors have done, you can tell me what he proposes. And
  at any rate, Barbillus, if your plans should not necessitate immediate
  action, pray remain as my guest."</p>

  <p>He waved a polite hand and turned away with a light step. Clodianus drew
  the priest a little on one side.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said: "What is your news?"</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Barbillus, "to begin at the beginning, it would seem that
  you too know of the commission with which Caesar has honored me. I am to make
  up for that little mishap the other evening. Well, I have discovered how to
  solve the problem; this note, if judiciously used, will put the coy damsel
  entirely in your power&mdash;by right of law, without the slightest exercise
  or appearance of arbitrary dealing."</p>

  <p>"Show me!"</p>

  <p>The priest gave him the note. "Caius Aurelius," he said, "gave her this
  note a few hours before he fled."</p>

  <p>Clodianus read every word slowly and thoughtfully, and muttering to
  himself: "The Batavian to the noble Cornelius greeting. There is danger in
  delay. Remember Rodumna!"</p>

  <p>Then a ray of intelligence lighted up his features, and his eyes sparkled
  with sudden fire. Rodumna! as it happened, he knew the little town, and one
  of his clients was a native of the place. In the self-same instant it struck
  him, that Rodumna was not far from Lugdunum, and this was like a flash of
  revelation; Rodumna, of course, was the head-quarters of the
  conspirators.&mdash; For that a conspiracy existed, none could doubt after
  all that had occurred, and Cinna*s well-known connection with Gallia
  Lugdunensis made the choice of that province as a base of operations probable
  on the face of it.</p>

  <p>Clodianus breathed hard. His keen wit took in the whole situation at once.
  If the contents of this note could be kept secret, if he could succeed in
  turning the Emperor's suspicions in another direction, this unhoped-for
  discovery would be of incalculable value. It was but a point to be sure, but
  that point might serve as the fulcrum from which to lift the world off its
  hinges. If his schemes with Stephanus and the Empress should fall through,
  here was a new lever ready to his hand, and stronger, more reliable, more
  splendid than the first.</p>

  <p>Clodianus made up his mind in an instant. He put on an expression of
  almost ferocious gravity.</p>

  <p>"Barbillus," he said with excessive sternness: "You are my prisoner!"</p>

  <p>"You are joking!" exclaimed the priest in dismay.</p>

  <p>"By no means! This note reveals a secret which, if it became known, would
  nullify all the measures taken by the government. Till this moment, not a
  soul but Caesar and those in his confidence knew that the conspirators were
  to meet at Rodumna. Accident has put you, too, in possession of the
  information. I must have you in safe-keeping."</p>

  <p>"That would be an ill return for the zeal I have shown in the matter."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, but consideration for you must' yield to my care for the
  safety of the State. The secret must be kept at any cost. Nothing but your
  imprisonment will be a sufficient guarantee. Come into the house with me, and
  I will consider where to send you."</p>

  <p>"You are resolved on my ruin!" cried Barbillus in despair. "A priest of
  Isis in prison! only consider; my office, my position, my influence will be
  utterly lost. Do you suppose, that all these years and in such a place as
  mine I have not learnt to hold my tongue? Silence is the first virtue of a
  priest."</p>

  <p>The adjutant seemed to waver.</p>

  <p>"If I could trust you.&mdash;But no. It will not do; I cannot undertake
  such a responsibility."</p>

  <p>"You can, you may, in all confidence. You may throw me to the wild beasts,
  if a rash word ever passes my lips. Only spare me this irremediable disgrace.
  I am thought by every matron in Rome to be specially favored by the goddess.
  You are destroying my very existence."</p>

  <p>"That would no doubt be a misfortune," said Clodianus relenting. "Well, be
  it so; once more I will be fool enough to be good-natured. But woe to you, if
  you abuse my kindness."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, thanks, my lord!" exclaimed Barbillus, raising the crafty
  courtier's hand to his lips.</p>

  <p>"The letter itself I will destroy at once," continued Clodianus.
  "Parthenius himself must know nothing of its contents, or he would undo all
  my precautions. Swear to be secret by all you hold most sacred."</p>

  <p>"I swear by the precious head of Barbillus," said the priest, laying his
  hand on his heart.</p>

  <p>"Very good; now come with me. You must tell the chamberlain some fib. That
  you hope to persuade the fair one to yield willingly, or anything else that
  comes into your head. I will take care of the rest."</p>

  <p>"Would it not be wise, if we were to discuss the details of the fib? I am
  anxious not to blunder, for I have already angered Caesar once."</p>

  <p>"Then go, keep out of it, and leave the whole matter to me. I will let you
  know what I have settled in the course of the evening."</p>

  <p>"That will, I think, be the safest plan. My appearing here at so late an
  hour might excite suspicion. Farewell, my lord. I will never forget the grace
  you have shown your humble servant."</p>

  <p>"The best thanks will be in silence."</p>

  <p>Barbillus took his leave. Clodianus took a few more turns up and down the
  colonnade, rubbing his hands with satisfaction; then he returned to the
  reception-rooms.</p>

  <p>When the extremely witty, but extremely licentious comedy had been acted
  to the end, amid the wild laughter of the audience, Parthenius found time to
  speak a few words in private with Clodianus. The adjutant had thought out his
  scheme and devised a fable, too simple to seem doubtful, to justify the
  priest's unexpected visit.</p>

  <p>The lovely Lycoris&mdash;who looked more bewitchingly than ever from under
  her long lashes&mdash;was just coming towards them, with the intention of
  thanking their amiable host for the delightful treat he had given them, and
  the amusement she had derived from it, and Parthenius was turning to meet
  her, when his attention was once more claimed in an opposite direction. A
  note from the city-prefect informed him of the escape of the Batavia and the
  disaster of the Charybdis. The letter also reported the most positive
  information, that the Batavia was bound for Liguria. This was inferred from
  the fact, that after that luckless encounter she took her course northwards
  rather than to the west. The city-prefect had sent express messengers to
  Ostia, that the chase might, if possible, be renewed immediately,</p>

  <p>Clodianus, to whom the chamberlain handed the note with a shrug of
  vexation, understood the position at once and took advantage of it. The city-
  prefect's mistake as to the direction the fugitives had taken, must be
  confirmed by spurious evidence and by an affectation of entire conviction,
  and Parthenius, who was just now very open to persuasion, must be talked over
  as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it is obvious!" said he, as though to himself. "Savo<a href=
  "#81">81</a> or Albium Ingaunum<a href="#82">82</a> are the only possible
  spots.&mdash;Well planned, on my word! Their route lies straight there, no
  islands in the way, and the vast curve of the coast makes it impossible to
  head them by land. From Liguria they will easily reach the Germanic
  Highlands, where the Batavian has powerful friends.&mdash;I see the whole
  plot. They will inveigle Germania and march across northern Italy with their
  flaxen-haired mercenaries and down upon the capital."</p>

  <p>"Your keenness is wonderful," said Parthenius. "To be sure, the whole
  thing is as clear as day. But what then, what can I do? The order for the
  pursuit has been issued, and I can but approve, though I am perfectly
  convinced that it is too late.&mdash;Here in Rome one never has a minute to
  oneself? Go, slave, tell your master I am obliged to him.&mdash;And now,
  enchanting Massilian, by Cypris! but if the ship those conspirators have
  sailed in had a heart, it would sail straight to Gaul to meet your sisters in
  beauty .<a href="#83">83</a>&mdash;Tell me now, what you found to criticise
  in our comedy.&mdash;I see a curl of Attic irony playing round your rose-bud
  lips."</p>

  <p>Lycoris did in fact make a few sarcastic remarks on the piece and the
  performers; but from that she went off into harmless chat of such delightful
  gaiety and sweetness, that Parthenius could not weary of listening to her
  melodious voice or of gazing at her round and snow-white shoulders. Never
  before had she seemed to him so perfectly enchanting; her lips smiled promise
  and her eyes flashed passion. Parthenius&mdash;a finished connoisseur in all
  the tricks and graces of the stage of the time&mdash;never suspected that
  this lavish display of her charms and fascinating wiles was a branch of the
  art; that Lycoris was acting a comedy, and that Stephanus was the manager of
  the drama. Stephanus himself, no doubt, was but a puppet in the hands of this
  witch, whose ambition aimed at the highest mark that ever dazzled the fancy
  of a Roman&mdash;at the sceptre of the world.</p>

  <p>Stephanus himself was one of the guests, and with him all was <i>couleur
  de rose</i>. While Lycoris was devoting herself to entangling the
  chamberlain, Stephanus was exchanging a few polite phrases with the
  adjutant.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said Clodianus in a low voice, as Stephanus turned to leave him;
  "I wish to warn you&mdash; Cneius Afranius is on the list of the proscribed,
  but this in no way prevents Caesar from taking the opportunity you know
  of..."</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>"Gently&mdash;we are watched. Will you come to see me in the course of the
  week? I will let you know the day and hour.&mdash;Good; now enjoy yourself,
  and of all things trouble yourself last about me&mdash;take no notice of
  me."</p>

  <p>New, and still new surprises, had been provided to entertain the company.
  A whole troupe of very slightly-attired dancing-girls from Gades, with
  butterfly-wings and floating hair, crowded into the lower end of the hall,
  and began their mazy dance. When this was ended, a shower of rose-scented
  spray<a href="#84">84</a> that fell from above like a fine mist, cooled the
  revellers deliclously; and finally soft music invited the company out into
  the pleasure- grounds, where a brilliant display of fireworks turned night
  into day.</p>

  <p>Through all these entertainments, the <i>blas&eacute;</i> adjutant made a
  great show of enthusiastic enjoyment. He laughed immoderately, he shouted, he
  even sang, and praised their liberal and amiable host in a stirring
  speech&mdash;their host, who, in the midst of his pressing cares and
  unresting exertions, could still find time to make a study of amusing and
  delighting his friends He devoted himself to winning the good graces of a
  young Greek girl, who had lately come to Rome from the island of Cypris. He
  affected a fervent accent, as he called her Cypris in person, swore by the
  sanctuary of Paphos<a href="#85">85</a> that a smile from the lovely Myrrhina
  would outweigh for him all the treasures of India, and quoted the famous line
  of Catullus:<a href="#86">86</a> " Let us live, my Lesbia, and let us
  love."</p>

  <p>"On my word, that Clodianus is a true son of Epicurus, as he represents
  himself in his book!" exclaimed a client of the house, who had modestly held
  aloof</p>

  <p>"And no wonder," retorted another. "Wealth and good fortune are poured
  into his lap! His whole life is sunshine. Even the affairs of state hardly
  trouble him at all; he has no ambitions&mdash;no fears&mdash;no anxieties. He
  plucks the present<a href="#87">87</a>&mdash;<i>carpe diem</i>, as Horace
  sings, and never for an instant troubles himself about the future. Who would
  not change with him!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p>It was during the night following on the evening, which the guests of
  Parthenius spent in dissipation, that the fearful catastrophe took place of
  which the reader is already informed. Quintus Claudius and the whole
  congregation of Nazarenes were discovered and seized in the catacomb between
  the Via Appia and the Via Labicana.</p>

  <p>We left our hero at the moment, when the procession of prisoners was
  setting out Rome- wards. It was a long and melancholy march through the
  solitude and gloom. No one spoke a word; only a suppressed sob or a groan of
  anguish now and then broke the oppressive silence. With what emotion did
  Quintus cross the bridge over the Almo, which he had walked over once before,
  that night when he had rescued Eurymachus. He did his best to banish all
  memories, all fears&mdash;nay, all hopes&mdash; and to fix his mind
  unswervingly on one thought alone: that his life and fate were in the hands
  of God.</p>

  <p>But it was hard, very hard, to school his struggling soul to composure.
  Again and again an image rose before him, which threatened to undermine his
  self-control&mdash;an agonized face&mdash;the features of his beloved, oh! so
  devotedly loved father. And then again the voices, the shouts of a vast
  multitude rang in his ears&mdash;he was in the arena&mdash;face to face with
  ravening beasts&mdash;defenseless, alone, forsaken, delivered over to a
  fearful death.</p>

  <p>It was impossible!... He, a son of the ancient and noble house of Claudia!
  No, never! That father could never give up his only son to be torn limb from
  limb. Perhaps this would end in salvation for all, perhaps his arrest meant
  liberty for all his companions. If he, Quintus Claudius, could swear fidelity
  to the creed of the Nazarene, was it not at once and forever purged of all
  suspicion of hostility to the State? Could any one think of him&mdash;the
  richest and most envied youth of the imperial city&mdash;as a foe to social
  order? Certainly his father could see and understand how greatly the
  government had erred; the faith that had been so blindly condemned, would be
  granted a hearing, and the law which had but just been passed for its
  suppression, would be trampled under foot.</p>

  <p>And in spite of his will, these pictures chased each other through his
  excited brain, terrors and hopes in rapid alternation, till, at last, their
  destination was reached: the Mamertine prison<a href="#88">88</a> at the foot
  of the Capitoline Hill. Then he had no thoughts but for the horrors of the
  present.</p>

  <p>Here, in the very heart of the splendid capital, in sight of gorgeous
  temples and pillared halls&mdash;which, lighted at this hour by torches,
  looked even more imposing than by day&mdash;in view of the imperial palace he
  had so often entered as Caesar's guest and friend&mdash;here he must be
  swallowed up, as it were, as a malefactor in the horrible gulf of the
  Tullianum!<a href="#89">89</a> The thought was unendurable; he was on the
  point of making a desperate resistance to the centurion's word of command.
  But his eye fell on the calm and happy face of the blind man&mdash;and in
  that instant the picture, which the old disciple had set before his hearers
  with such startling reality, rose before the young man*s soul.</p>

  <p>"It must be endured to the end," said he to himself "To be sure, at eighty
  a man's heart does not throb with such keen pain as at twenty."</p>

  <p>The Christians wept and embraced each other; they were led away to
  separate rooms in the prison. Quintus' turn came last, and to him the
  governor had assigned a separate cell. He crossed its threshold with calm
  deliberation; the gaoler set down some food and drink&mdash;not a better sort
  of food, such as was usually granted to prisoners of rank, but the ordinary
  criminal's fare. Then he shut the heavy, iron-plated door, and pushed the
  three outside bolts.</p>

  <p>Quintus sank on the stone bench<a href="#90">90</a> that served as a bed-
  place, utterly annihilated; the last drop of his self-command seemed to
  evaporate, as the echoing steps of the gaoler died into silence. He covered
  his face with his hands, and a wild groan broke from him; then for nearly an
  hour he sat stunned and motionless.</p>

  <p>Exhaustion and cold recalled him to his senses; a raw, damp atmosphere
  pervaded the underground vault. He shuddered and drew his cloak, which had
  fallen off, over his shoulders; then he looked round him.</p>

  <p>The cell was rather longer than it was wide, rectangular, and just high
  enough to allow of his standing upright. By day a niggardly ray of light
  might be admitted through a round hole in the roof; at present a smoky little
  oil- lamp was burning on one side of the room, opposite the bed-place.
  Besides this couch the cell contained a rough wooden bench and a short iron
  rivet, furnished with rings and chains, to which the temporary resident in
  the cell could be secured, and he perceived a second rivet of the same kind
  on the opposite side near the bed.</p>

  <p>With a tremulous hand he lightly touched the rattling irons; it made him
  shiver. He started to his feet, and began to pace the cell in feverish
  excitement. He involuntarily remembered that Gaetulian mountain lion which,
  at Ostia, had rushed so fiercely at the bars of its cage... He, a proud and
  noble Roman, was caged now, no better off than a wild beast.&mdash;No better!
  His scornful laughter echoed uncannily through the vaults. He compared the
  lion's airy and open cage with the hideous dungeon that held a man but just
  now free and happy&mdash;and he envied the brute. That clumsy, dull, black
  door confronted him as though it could never open again; he went close up to
  it, struck it with his fists, and tried to shake it. It neither moved nor
  rattled. It was as immovable in the masonry as the lid of some huge primeval
  sarcophagus. He suddenly felt helplessly inconsolable, and pressing his
  forehead against the cold iron plate, he cried like a child.</p>

  <p>What was that written in Greek characters&mdash;carefully, elaborately
  scratched by hands that had all-too-much time? He read through his tears a
  message of promise.</p>

  <p>"Jesus, my Saviour and Redeemer.&mdash;To Thee I live and die."</p>

  <p>Then some other follower of the Christian faith, some fellow-sufferer in
  the cause, had here awaited his fate. Laboriously, and to comfort his
  stricken heart, he had left a record in the dungeon, where he lingered and
  pined, to greet and console a successor. And it was no cowardly lament, no
  cry of despair, but a brave confession, a word of heavenly confidence and
  beatific submission to the Master. Quintus felt, what so many thousands have
  felt since: the overpowering attractiveness of example; the bliss, the charm
  of martyrdom. This creed, which made the most agonizing death so easy, and
  filled the most wretched with peace, calmness, joy&mdash;must indeed be the
  creed of redemption, high above all that the wisdom of men had yet
  devised&mdash;and it would surely pour balm even into his aching wounds, and
  bear him up on the wings of enthusiasm to triumph over the terrors of
  death.</p>

  <p>Strangely comforted, he carefully examined the walls all round, and he
  found numbers of inscriptions, some hardly legible in the rough stone, but
  all telling the same tale of suffering and of supreme faith, of death for the
  truth's sake and the beatitude of a godly frame of mind.</p>

  <p>In one place, in Latin, he read as follows: "I, Sericus, forty-three years
  old, and I, Psyche, the daughter of Sericus, seventeen years old, write this;
  imprisoned here by the city-prefect under Nero. We are Christians; we die for
  the faith. We forgive our enemies and hope for God's mercy." Close by, in
  Greek, was written:</p>

  <p>"Blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs
  is the Kingdom of Heaven." And below this, another hand had added in
  continuation: "Yea verily, that is my hope and comfort, which shall
  strengthen me in the hour of death."</p>

  <p>The longer Quintus lingered over these tokens of past spiritual victories,
  the more he felt as a wanderer might who, in the horrors of the wilderness,
  traced the footprints of men and so learnt that others had crossed the desert
  before him. He fancied himself surrounded and overshadowed by the
  death-defying army of martyrs, and he swore to himself that he would quail no
  more than Sericus and his maiden Psyche; than Archilaos, a lad of twenty,
  spoken of in another inscription, or than Chabrias, who left a lovely and
  adored bride in Rhodes, to be burnt alive or crucified in Nero*s gardens.</p>

  <p>And here the thought of Cornelia, which he had, so far, resolutely held at
  bay, took possession of his soul. He shuddered and turned cold at the
  recollection; but his resolution was not to be shaken. Even the reflection
  that not one of the witnesses that had sojourned here, not even Chabrias, had
  had this horror added to his sufferings; that he was a victim to his own,
  dearly- loved father&mdash;even this worst stroke of all could not make him
  flinch. Something within him had frozen&mdash;petrified&mdash;something which
  had hitherto been alive to all the impulses of hope, fear and despair. If he
  could bear something more than all had suffered, who had gone before him,
  then it must be that God, who had laid it on him, deemed him to be of more
  heroic mould. The torment was greater? then the greater must the glory be!
  Fate had set him in the high places of life, visible from afar, one of the
  leaders of the people.&mdash;Then he must endure greater bitterness, suffer
  greater torments, so that his death should be heard of among the nations like
  a herald's call from a mountain-top.</p>

  <p>The solemn conviction that a special call from Heaven had ruled his fate,
  became clearer and firmer in his mind as the hours went by. With a curious
  mixture of pride and humility he regarded himself as an instrument in the
  hand of Providence, and in proportion as this belief grew and struck root
  another idea died out, which, during the last few hours, had recurred as
  mysteriously seductive, that of killing himself if all other hope failed.
  This, from an educated Romanes point of view, was in no respect sinful or
  wrong.</p>

  <p>It was considered permissible, nay highly praiseworthy, to cut the thread
  of existence, when every hope of an endurable future was lost. Nor had
  Quintus been long enough familiar with the principles and views of
  Christianity, to reject this desperate remedy at the first thought of it. But
  now, as he began to believe that he saw in his fate the designs of a higher
  power, he felt steeled against its seductions.</p>

  <p>The lamp had burned lower and lower and at last went out; Quintus sat
  staring into the darkness for some little time. Then he felt his way round
  the wall to the bed, lay down on the mildewed worsted blanket and covered
  himself with his lacerna. After once more dedicating himself to God and his
  conscience, even unto death, he repeated the short prayer that the
  congregation had used on the occasion of his reception under the covenant. He
  had heard the words but once, but they were graven on his soul&mdash;those
  simple child-like words: "Our Father"&mdash;and then he fell asleep, as
  soundly and quietly as if he were lying on the soft cushions of his own
  cubiculum.</p>

  <p>When he awoke, some hours later, a dull foggy twilight pervaded the room.
  The rattle of the bolts had roused him. It was his gaoler, who came in and
  set a freshly-filled amphora<a href="#91">91</a> down by his side; then he
  tilted the bowl of porridge, which Quintus had not touched, to see if the
  mess were yet too stiff to be eaten. After a moment's hesitation he put it
  down and was leaving the room, when Quintus spoke to him.</p>

  <p>"What time is it?" he asked, sitting up.</p>

  <p>"Two hours past sunrise."</p>

  <p>"I am very hungry; give me something to eat."</p>

  <p>The gaoler pointed to the clay bowl without speaking.</p>

  <p>"You do not indulge in luxuries here!" said Quintus bitterly. "That is too
  vile food for the meanest of my slaves, nay for my dogs."</p>

  <p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You must get used to it. We are under the strictest orders to treat every
  one alike by the rules of the place, with no distinction of birth."</p>

  <p>"Indeed&mdash;and what is the rule of the place?"</p>

  <p>"Porridge and water, with rye-bread for supper. I cannot help it, if you
  fine gentlemen do not relish it. We often have folks here, who are only too
  thankful for such food, poor wretches who have not had a morsel for days if
  the gifts of corn have been stopped."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who I am?" Quintus interrupted his voluble informant.</p>

  <p>"No, I rarely get out into the world. It is a year last Feast of Saturn,
  since I was in the Field of Mars. But I can see by your manner that you are
  of some noble family."</p>

  <p>"I am Quintus Claudius, the son of the Flamen."</p>

  <p>"Stuff and nonsense!" said the gaoler. "Why, you were caught in a quarry
  with the Nazarenes."</p>

  <p>"Quite true."</p>

  <p>"Then you cannot be Quintus, the son of the Flamen Dialis."</p>

  <p>"You doubt it? Did not the centurion, who took us, tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Not me&mdash;he spoke to the governor."</p>

  <p>"To be sure. Well, you will know it too before the day is out. Now listen
  to what I ask. The news of my arrest can hardly yet have got to my father's
  ears. And if the report reaches him, if a stranger tells him the worst,
  point- blank, it will kill him. No one but myself knows how to mitigate the
  blow to him. Will you carry him a note, only two short lines&mdash;on these
  wax-tablets?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" said the man, drawing back.</p>

  <p>"Look here&mdash;I will give you this stylus&mdash;it is of pure
  gold..."</p>

  <p>"If you offered me ten times its value, I dare not. It is as much as my
  life is worth."</p>

  <p>"Then take me to your superior officer."</p>

  <p>"I cannot without leave."</p>

  <p>"Try to get leave." The gaoler looked doubtful; . the young man's calm,
  urgent manner, and his evident high breeding, impressed him greatly.</p>

  <p>"I will see what can be done," he said, hesitatingly. "Take patience till
  this evening."</p>

  <p>"Till this evening!" cried Quintus, in despair. "Miserable man, do you not
  understand that you are killing him. Every instant is precious, and you say:
  till this evening."</p>

  <p>He had hardly ceased speaking, when they heard steps outside the dungeon
  door. The gaoler rushed out, and Quintus heard the murmur of voices coming
  nearer and nearer. Suddenly his heart stood still.</p>

  <p>"Many thanks," he heard just outside. "Leave me alone now, worthy Haemon;
  you know me well enough to feel sure that you run no risk, in admitting me
  without a witness."</p>

  <p>Quintus gazed anxiously at the door. It was his father's voice. In an
  instant the door opened, and Titus Claudius stood before him.</p>

  <p>For a long time neither could utter a word; they stood looking at each
  other as pale and silent as the dead. Their lips quivered, but this was the
  only outward sign of their cruel suffering. But they understood each other;
  each was struggling for such composure as might enable him to speak. It was
  the father, who first succeeded; but it was in a hollow, forced voice that he
  said, as he clenched his hands convulsively; "It is here
  &mdash;here&mdash;that we meet!"</p>

  <p>The words conveyed such deep and unspeakable anguish, that Quintus
  shuddered from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"Father..." he began, and then he broke into sobs. He turned his face to
  the wall in despair, and pressed his cheek against the cold stone as though
  entreating its pity.</p>

  <p>"Quintus," the priest went on&mdash;and his voice was as gentle and mild
  as a child's, "is it true, that you spent the night in the catacomb with the
  Nazarenes?"</p>

  <p>The young man looked round.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Father," he said.</p>

  <p>"Did you not know the law?"</p>

  <p>"I knew it, Father."</p>

  <p>"And what were you doing among the rebels?**</p>

  <p>"Who calls them rebels?" retorted Quintus, recovering his self-
  possession.</p>

  <p>"All who respect the government, for the law has branded them so. Answer
  me, Quintus: What were you seeking in the society of these reprobates?"</p>

  <p>"What I never found in the society of their persecutors, what all my life-
  long I have vainly longed and hoped for: peace and salvation for my
  soul."</p>

  <p>"Then it is true&mdash;it is true?"</p>

  <p>"What, Father?"</p>

  <p>"That you are not merely their protector, but, in fact, one of them."</p>

  <p>"As you say."</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius turned paler and more ghastly than before.</p>

  <p>"Wretched boy!" he said; "then you are a lost man! The crime of being a
  Nazarene is punished with death."</p>

  <p>"I know it."</p>

  <p>"You know it? And you tread the law under foot?"</p>

  <p>"In my soul I carry a higher law."</p>

  <p>"There is no higher law than that of duty. You are a Roman. You are my
  son. Madman! As a Roman, you are breaking the laws of the country&mdash;as a
  son, you are breaking your father's heart I What demon possesses you? What
  disease is this that has turned your brain? Does it charm your hopes more to
  bleed to death under the fangs of Libyan beasts, than to be clasped in the
  arms of your Cornelia? Does the air of the Tullianum please you better, than
  the perfumed atmosphere of your own rooms? You have everything, every single
  thing your heart can desire, and you must plunge into dark gulf of crime,
  soil your soul with the foul mire of superstition&mdash;nay, call yourself
  the brother of vile slaves, of panders and corpse-carriers!"</p>

  <p>"I follow the light of truth," replied Quintus. "You are wrong, father, in
  regarding the Nazarenes as mere vile rabble. It is not rank that makes the
  man, but character. Before the God of the Nazarenes there is no respect of
  persons, and it is just that which makes the doctrine of Christ so
  noble."</p>

  <p>"Noble! Quintus&mdash;by all the gods, return to your right mind! A man of
  senatorial rank, a son of the house of Claudia, thinks the doctrine noble,
  which grants him equal rights with street-porters and executioners.<a href=
  "#92">92</a> Such madness puts me beside myself And what has all this to do
  with the salvation of your soul? Have you gone through the senseless farces,
  of which I have heard so much? Kissed the gallows,<a href="#93">93</a> and
  offered sacrifice before the miserable image of a crucified man? Have you
  lent ear to the fables, which superstition has woven round that execution on
  Golgotha? Alas! your silence is only too eloquent. These tricksters have
  entangled you with their wiles, till you have lost the power to free yourself
  from the net. Oh! I can quite understand, that it was well worth their while
  to entrap a Claudius. Your name outweighs a thousand lesser ones, and held
  aloft on their banner at the right moment, it might bring victory to the
  traitors! And do you not perceive all this? Does your keen eye fail to see
  through their treacherous game?"</p>

  <p>"Father, we can never understand each other. By all that is sacred..."</p>

  <p>"I will not hear you!" interrupted the priest. "What can you say? Who it
  is that has entrapped you, and how far the ramifications of the plot extend,
  we shall learn in the course of enquiry. I came not as your judge, nor
  commissioned by the Senate. I came to save you. Confess you were led astray,
  abjure this superstition, which can never really have taken possession of
  your soul, offer a sacrifice of atonement to Jupiter Capitolinus&mdash;and
  all will be well. A year of exile&mdash;to Hellas perhaps, where I have
  crowds of friends&mdash;would be the worst that could befall you, and even
  this short banishment Caesar would no doubt remit at my entreaty. All is
  ready, and to- morrow morning early the ceremony can take place. Till then
  you will be a prisoner, but in my house,<a href="#94">94</a> and treated with
  the honor due to your name. Norbanus himself will escort you thither; he is
  waiting at the door of the prison. His highest officers will keep guard over
  you. Forwards then; let us leave this scene of disgrace&mdash;and may your
  bitter experience have taught you wisdom."</p>

  <p>But Quintus did not stir. His eyes were spellbound to the wall which, in
  the gloomy watches of the night, had revealed such strange histories. Each
  inscription, each name seemed to raise the image of some pale and suffering
  face. He felt at the bottom of his soul that now, here, the moment had come
  for giving expression in deeds to the reflection and resolve of those dark
  hours. Side by side, too, with the ecstatic enthusiasm of the convert, there
  surged up in his soul the unbending pride and iron will of his race. Should
  he be more cowardly, baser, weaker than the lowborn and wretched? His heart
  beat high at the thought, and the blood mounted to his brow.</p>

  <p>"I cannot, Father," he said, turning away.</p>

  <p>"What? You cannot walk in the path, in which your father is ready to lead
  you? Or do you think it mean to confess the error of your ways? Give place to
  reason, Quintus! It is to no mortal, but to the gods alone that you have to
  confess your crime. Humility before the gods is no dishonor..."</p>

  <p>"Your gods are not mine," cried Quintus vehemently. "A confessor of the
  true God can never sacrifice to Jupiter Capitolinus."</p>

  <p>"Who is the true God, but he whose care and rule we see, wherever we turn
  our eyes, and feel in our souls? Are you so utterly degenerate, that you have
  learnt to confound the great universal spirit&mdash;whom our fathers
  worshipped as Jupiter, the Father of Light&mdash;with a mortal&mdash;with a
  Jewish revolutionary, whom the imperial governor silenced by death?"</p>

  <p>"Nay Father, you misunderstand. We do not revere the crucified Saviour as
  God himself, only as our Master, who revealed the true God to us. Between the
  God of Christ and your idols there is a great gulf fixed. Your own noble
  nature associates with those idols of a false faith, aspirations and
  feelings, which have always been foreign to the spirit of that faith. If only
  you knew how the faith in the light I walk in glows through my whole being,
  you would expect the skies to fall, sooner than that I should pronounce the
  base denial you ask of me."</p>

  <p>"Mad fool!" cried the priest in great wrath. "You hold a tissue of lies as
  more precious than life and happiness, as higher than the honor of your
  family? Have done with this reckless mockery! Follow me, I command you!"</p>

  <p>"Father!" groaned Quintus with growing anguish, "God is my witness, that I
  would shed every drop of blood in my body for you and for your happiness:
  only this one thing&mdash;I cannot&mdash;I cannot..."</p>

  <p>"You must. By all the gods, but you must! What? My son a traitor&mdash;to
  be the sport and gazing-stock of a cackling crowd, scorned and mocked at as a
  fool, and condemned to an ignominious death&mdash;? You are raving, boy!
  Come, away from this fetid cell. I command you!"</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius gazed with agonized enquiry at his son's pale face, which
  looked more and more petrified to marble.</p>

  <p>"I cannot, Father!" That was all the bloodless lips could utter.</p>

  <p>Then the despairing father fell on his knees and raised his hands in
  entreaty, like a criminal suing for mercy. Tears streamed down his distorted
  face, which looked ten years older for that hour*s anguish. He rent his robe,
  he tore his hair, he struck his forehead against the pavement. In
  heart-rending accents he implored his son&mdash;his only, beloved son, the
  star and joy of his life&mdash;not to make him so miserable&mdash;more
  miserable than ever man had been before in all this grief-stricken and
  strife-plagued world. He reminded him of the days of his infancy, when he had
  nursed him in his arms, lived, cared, and toiled only for his boy. And would
  this child, his Quintus, his all in all, doom him to this hideous fate?</p>

  <p>The miserable man presented a pitiable sight.</p>

  <p>"Oh Father," cried Quintus, gasping for breath. "What have you done? Woe
  is me, I am a monster! That sacred head in the dust&mdash;compose
  yourself&mdash;you are driving me mad! O God, not yet! Father, I will obey
  you, I am yours henceforth. My soul's salvation?&mdash;I give it up. You
  shall not suffer for my sake."</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius rose. The strong man was trembling like a child. With one
  passionate cry the father and son were clasped in each other's arms.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p>The commander of the imperial guard, with a few officers and soldiers,
  received Quintus as he slowly went out through the heavy stone gate-way into
  the street, but his silent greeting was not altogether free from
  embarrassment. During the last few days events had occurred, which had thrown
  the worthy soldier off his balance. The intrigues of a court, with their
  underhand and mysterious details, were foreign to his nature. Out in the
  field, with the Dacian foe in front of him, he could avail himself of the
  ruses of war and the arts of strategy; but in peace, in the capital of the
  empire, this mode of action revolted and puzzled him. Such a measure as the
  wholesale arrest of senators and knights had never been adopted before, even
  under Domitian. And now this mysterious discovery of Quintus Claudius in the
  catacomb with the Nazarenes! Norbanus was wholly at a loss how to account for
  it. The high-priest had given him a very superficial and hasty explanation,
  and the whole thing might be either the device of some mortal enemy, or the
  result of some outrageous whim. Norbanus had long known the young man's
  spirit and daring, though under different circumstances. A man, who could
  address a love-song to a vestal virgin, would be quite capable of playing the
  part of an adherent of the Nazarenes, particularly if among them there
  bloomed some rose of Palestine, whose beauty would suffer no drawback from
  the superstition of her people. To be sure&mdash;as they came out, the father
  and son together&mdash;their faces were too pale and grave for so light a
  matter. The worthy warrior had a grave feeling that, whatever had happened,
  he had not the key of the riddle and would be sure to say the wrong thing, so
  he wrapped himself in a dignified and significant silence, which each might
  interpret just as he pleased or as the case required. Quintus understood it
  to mean kindly sympathy and due considerateness, the Flamen took it for
  horror and disapproval, the tribunes and centurions attributed it to military
  severity and discipline.</p>

  <p>They took the shortest way to the high-priest*s residence&mdash;along the
  foot of the Capitoline and across the Forum. The people crowded round them
  from all sides, for the rumor of Quintus* arrest had long since spread into
  the remotest quarters of the city. Now, every one wanted to see the
  illustrious father, who had been to fetch his son out of the depths of the
  Tullianum. The little procession could hardly get along. Even the lictor, who
  marched before the high-priest and the soldiers of the guard were powerless.
  A hundred voices at once shouted their comments on the unwonted sight.</p>

  <p>"He plotted against the Caesar's life," said a rough voice in the
  background.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense&mdash;he is one of Caesar's friends."</p>

  <p>"He was in the quarry with the Nazarenes."</p>

  <p>"He kissed the cross."</p>

  <p>"He is condemned to death."</p>

  <p>"It was his own father that made the law."</p>

  <p>"But see; it is his father, who is setting him at liberty."</p>

  <p>"That is just the way of the world."</p>

  <p>"True enough. Laws are only made for slaves and beggars! They take things
  easier at home."</p>

  <p>The last words were spoken under the very nose of the high-priest, so that
  he could not help hearing them. An angry glow flushed his face, and with a
  scornful curl of his lip he looked round. He seemed as though he would speak,
  but he checked himself in time. A smile of supreme contempt parted his
  haughty lips; then he said aloud to Norbanus:</p>

  <p>"You are too considerate, and the people too bold. Your men should use
  their arms."</p>

  <p>The general looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"To be sure," Titus Claudius added more mildly, "we might have foreseen
  this crowd. Such a sight is ambrosia to the mob."</p>

  <p>They were nearly ten minutes reaching the Flamen's house. Norbanus and one
  of the officers went in with them to the rooms adjoining the peristyle; the
  rest remained till farther orders in a room opening out of the atrium.</p>

  <p>When Quintus had washed and put on a clean dress he went, still
  accompanied by Norbanus and his centurion, into his father's study, where the
  family had assembled. Quintus wondered to find his mother so calm,
  comparatively speaking. He did not know, with what enormous effort of self-
  command Titus Claudius had represented the catastrophe as a trifling mistake,
  a mere misunderstanding. Lucilia was a good deal excited; the exceptional and
  startling character of the event gave her fancy much to busy it. She would
  have given the world to talk over the occurrences of the last few days with
  Fabulla, the wise old mother of her friend Cneius Afranius; but now, in all
  this confusion, an expedition to Ostia was quite out of the question. So she
  must think it all over to herself alone, particularly as Claudia had shut
  herself up in unapproachable reserve, and had no answer for any questions but
  "Yes" and "No." Even now, when her brother came into the room, Claudia was
  very chary of her words, in marked contrast to Lucilia. And yet Quintus was
  obscurely conscious, that she took the situation more gravely and seriously
  than either Octavia or the excited Lucilia. And, in fact, Claudia knew her
  brother too well, not to feel sure that something deeper was at work here
  than a mere foolish adventure. The audacity of wild spirits craves a public;
  its extravagant flights are displayed to those who are like-minded, and who
  will applaud and admire. But when a man like Quintus had carried out a plan
  in secret and among such unfamiliar companions, it could be no jesting
  matter.</p>

  <p>During an hour which he spent with his family, Quintus himself was for the
  most part silent Seated in a deep easy-chair, he eat a small breakfast which
  Lucilia brought to him. The Flamen meanwhile exerted himself to explain to
  the party, what steps he had taken to win Caesar's favor and clemency for his
  son, and what the ceremonial sacrifice, which Quintus was to offer, must
  consist in.</p>

  <p>The more the father talked, the more the son's heart was wrung. He might
  be absolutely convinced of all he so vehemently uttered; to Quintus it was
  all a foul lie, a ridiculous and cowardly subterfuge. It was a lie, to say
  that mere boyish curiosity had led him to assist at a meeting of the
  Nazarenes; it was a lie, that intriguing knaves had taken advantage of his
  curiosity under false pretences. It was a lie, that the Nazarenes had plotted
  to overthrow the whole fabric of Roman society, that they had fanned his
  ambition after befooling him, that they had abused his good nature. It was
  above all a lie, to say that he bitterly repented of ever having had anything
  to do with the Nazarenes, and only longed to purge himself publicly of the
  disgrace of that contact. Why was it so impossible to convince the
  priest&mdash;usually so calm, clear-sighted, and just&mdash;of the error of
  his prejudice? Why had he so resolutely closed his eyes and heart to the
  truth?</p>

  <p>The burden of this question, and all the false aspects of his position,
  almost crushed the young man to the earth. He returned to the room which had
  been his till he quitted his father's house, as dull and indifferent as if he
  were only half-witted. This room was a pleasing counterpart to Claudia's
  pretty room, and, like it, was 01/ the upper floor, and on the same side of
  the house. The furniture was still as he had left it. Even some of his first
  books, his playthings as a boy, and other such memorials of the happy past
  had found an abiding place here, so that&mdash;as Octavia said&mdash;the son
  might always recognize his old home in his parents' house. Lately, no doubt,
  the quiet nook had for months together never been visited but by the slaves,
  who came to dust it and shake up the pillows on the divans.</p>

  <p>Quintus thanked the captain of the guard for his considerate treatment,
  and begged to be allowed to be alone. Norbanus, who regarded his watch over
  the young man as a mere formality, acceded with pleasure. He posted a
  centurion at the entrance with three men-at-arms, recommended the utmost
  courtesy to their prisoner, pressed the young man's hand with a jesting
  farewell, and left the house, as urgent business required his presence at the
  palace.</p>

  <p>Now, at last, Quintus realized his position. All that he had gone through
  and done during the last few hours had gone over his head, as it were, not
  more than half understood. He had walked on like a somnambulist over heights
  and hollows, without appreciating the danger, and now, waking suddenly, he
  shuddered to see precipices and yawning gulfs on every side. Wherever he
  looked, horror stared him in the face&mdash;misery, shame, dishonor, and
  despair. Either way his fate was hopeless. Either he must shatter the
  existence of the man he loved more than himself&mdash;or he must be that mean
  and cowardly thing, a traitor and a renegade, trailing all he held most
  sacred in the dust. Had not the Master of Nazareth taught, that no man could
  have any part in the infinite mercies of God, who fell away from the faith
  through fear of men? And was it not this which was driving him into
  denial&mdash;base fear of men? It wore, to be sure, the specious aspect, the
  garb of light of filial love. But ought not the true heir of the faith
  patiently to take upon him even that fearful grief? Did not Jesus die on the
  cross, although he knew that he was breaking his parents' hearts? Aye, He had
  done this thing, the Just one, the Mighty, Omnipotent; but
  he&mdash;Quintus&mdash;was but a feeble and worthless disciple of the Great
  Teacher. He could not do it, though the joys of heaven and the torments of
  hell were in the balance. He must lose his soul to all eternity&mdash;if only
  he might spare his father.</p>

  <p>It was a terrible day that he spent, surrounded by all the treasured
  relics of his unclouded childhood. Titus Claudius came to visit him, to thank
  him for his filial obedience, and to assure him once more, that his father's
  heart had forgiven and forgotten all that had passed. Quintus was incapable
  of responding to all his loving words, spoken in a voice that trembled with
  agitation, excepting by sighs and silent signs of consent and submission. In
  all this Titus Claudius read remorseful distress, and did his utmost to
  encourage him and raise his spirit; but presently, seeing that his efforts
  were vain, he left his son to himself again, in the hope that solitude and a
  night's rest would restore his agitated soul.</p>

  <p>But he was mistaken; Quintus did not close his eyes all night. From time
  to time he fancied he heard the voice of old Calenus, reproaching him with
  his base apostasy. Then, tortured with horror, he sprang from his bed. He
  compared the night he had passed in the Tullianum with this present night
  under his father's roof. There&mdash;a squalid cell, with death under the
  clutches of wild beasts an almost absolute certainty. Here&mdash;a pretty,
  comfortable room with freedom ere long, happiness for his family, and all the
  joys of life for himself. And yet his storm-tossed heart had yesterday been
  at peace, while to- day it was wrung with incessant and unutterable
  anguish&mdash;"Blind fool!"&mdash;he seemed to hear the words
  spoken&mdash;"You think you are sacrificing only your own soul. But are you
  not also betraying and imperilling, so far as in you lies, the whole glorious
  work of the Master? If all were to act as you have done, where would the
  sublime idea be, which brought light and joy to the crucified Saviour: the
  Redemption, to wit, of mankind? Have you any right to sacrifice the salvation
  of millions, merely to spare your father&mdash; however much you may love
  him&mdash;a transient sorrow, which may even lead him too to the light of
  truth?"</p>

  <p>He thought that Calenus was standing by his bed-side, and laid his hand on
  his forehead. "Take courage!" said the blind man solemnly, "by God's help
  all&mdash;all&mdash;all may be overcome."</p>

  <p>Again Quintus sat up terror-stricken. It was but a dream with his eyes
  open&mdash;a vision, but how vivid! He had plainly felt the pressure of a
  hand on his brow, and seen the prophet-like face, with its calm, holy,
  celestial gaze.</p>

  <p>At last morning broke. The slaves came to help him to dress. He felt as if
  he were being dragged to execution, but he unresistingly submitted to all his
  father commanded.</p>

  <p>The sun was rising over the Esquiline, when the father and son, in festal
  dress, went out of the house. Norbanus was on the spot, and a large party of
  clients and fiiends. The Forum and the adjoining streets swarmed with
  spectators, notwithstanding the early hour. The recantation was the great
  event of the day. The supreme council of the Pontifices<a href=
  "#95">95</a>&mdash;at the head of which sat Caesar as Pontifex
  Maximus&mdash;had agreed, in consideration of the distinguished merits of
  Titus Claudius, that the sacred ceremony should be one with the daily public
  sacrifice offered by the Flamen Dialis, and that Quintus should be held
  justified and free from all suspicion of Christian proclivities, if he would,
  after his father and in unison with the high-priest's clients and friends,
  distinctly offer up a prayer to Jupiter, the almighty and all-merciful,
  calling down vengeance and destruction on all the foes of the State, and
  especially on the vile and reprobate sect of the Nazarenes. All this Titus
  Claudius had hastily explained to his son, adding that everything else was a
  mere matter of course.</p>

  <p>The solemn procession made its way up the broad steps to the Capitol.
  Quintus was suffocating, a weight lay on his breast like a tombstone. Once or
  twice he stood still, his knees trembled and he could hardly stand. Norbanus,
  who was walking by his side, had to support him.</p>

  <p>At the top Quintus involuntarily looked round him. His eye gazed over the
  heads of the crowd in the Forum, past the Flavian Amphitheatre, out to the
  Via Appia. There, to the left, hardly distinguishable in the distance, was
  the wood, in whose calm retreat salvation had been opened to him&mdash;and
  now?</p>

  <p>"Proceed&mdash;why do you hesitate?" said his father in his ear; and on
  they went to the temple. Here again a crowd, half curious and half reverent,
  had followed them and filled the vast hall. The altar of the patron divinity
  of the city was decked and wreathed with consecrated plants and costly
  streamers, ready for the sacred ceremony. A herald now proclaimed
  silence,<a href="#96">96</a> and not a murmur was heard. Two of the
  temple-servants led in the beasts for sacrifice, covered with garlands, while
  a third made a mixture of wine, spring-water, incense, and cones<a href=
  "#">97</a> with which to dedicate them.</p>

  <p>The high-priest took his place in front of the altar; he was as pale as
  death. Raising his hands, he spoke in a deep voice, audible in every
  comer:</p>

  <p>"Jupiter, the merciful and mighty one! Save and de* fend this city, that
  thou hast made great!"</p>

  <p>"Defend this city, that thou hast made great!" echoed from the chorus; and
  Quintus too moved his lips in a faint whisper.</p>

  <p>"Blast the foes of the Roman name with the lightnings of thy wrath!" Titus
  Claudius went on, and again the choir repeated the words.</p>

  <p>"More especially destroy all reprobates and traitors, who hoist the
  standard of superstition and plot the ruin of society. Crush the foul brood
  of rebellious Nazarenes!"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;a thousand times no!" shouted a voice of thunder, that echoed
  from the stone walls. "Tear me in pieces, but spare me so base a lie!"</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius staggered; he had to support himself by clinging to the
  altar.</p>

  <p>"My son, my son, what have you done?" he muttered in a husky voice.</p>

  <p>"What I had to do," cried Quintus vehemently. "Lead me back to my cell,
  kill me&mdash;I die a Nazarene!"</p>

  <p>An unexampled tumult arose on this unexpected incident. Titus Claudius,
  with a faint scream, sank senseless into the arms of a temple-servant. The
  mob, who took up the young man's words as a note of defiance, forgot all the
  respect due to the sanctuary, and pressed forward, shouting for prompt
  vengeance. Indeed any faith in the doctrines of the State religion survived
  in very few, it was Roman arrogance, which had taken the place of the old
  Roman pride, which demanded its rights. The crime, that Quintus had now
  committed, was contempt of the majesty of the people, an insult to the Roman
  name&mdash;a crime a thousand times more unpardonable than the folly of those
  poor wretches, who gathered in a catacomb to worship in secret round the
  cross. Norbanus tried in vain to restore order; even his nearest allies
  seemed paralyzed and helpless.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the voice of the Flamen was heard once more; he had recovered his
  self-possession, and was standing in an imperious attitude before the
  altar.</p>

  <p>"Stand back!" he exclaimed, clenching his fist over the heads of the mob
  as though he wielded the bolts of Jove. "What do you want? What do you fear?
  The law is immutable. Centurions of the guard, do your duty, as I do mine.
  Away with the Nazarene! Take him back to prison! And you, noisy simpletons,
  meditate in devout silence, till the priest shall have ended his sacred
  office."</p>

  <p>A death-like stillness responded to this address. No one stirred; neither
  of the centurions ventured to obey the Flamen's orders.</p>

  <p>"Why do you delay?" said Quintus to Norbanus. "The ground here bums under
  my feet. Take me away!"</p>

  <p>Norbanus and his subalterns quitted the temple with a saddened mien;
  Quintus walked slowly in their midst. Once he turned, and in a tone of
  anguish said:</p>

  <p>"Father&mdash;farewell!"</p>

  <p>"You no longer have a father," said the high-priest averting his eyes, and
  he at once began the interrupted prayer and performed the service and
  sacrifice to the end.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p>Eight days had gone by since the events related in the last chapter. A
  chill cloud hung over the house of Claudia, the sources of life seemed ice-
  bound. All intercourse with the outer world was restricted to what was
  absolutely necessary; the inhabitants crept and glided about like speechless
  ghosts. Titus Claudius fulfilled the duties of his office with stem
  regularity, but without unction, dully and mechanically. His son's name never
  passed his lips, and yet every one felt that one hideous thought was ever
  present to his mind. It was the same with the two girls. All brightness, all
  youthfulness had deserted them, particularly Claudia, who had borne her own
  hard fate with such steadfast hopefulness. Octavia alone clung unshaken to
  her conviction, that her husband, whose irresistible strength of will had
  proved victorious in so many contests, would, even in this bitter strait,
  find a solution and an issue.</p>

  <p>It was still early, but two hours after sunrise, and Octavia was sitting
  in silent abstraction with her two daughters, in the snug little room
  where&mdash;so short a time since&mdash;Caius Aurelius had read to them the
  Thebais of Statius. Cornelia, too, was with them; she was sitting pale and
  listless near the door, and listening for a step in the hall. She was waiting
  till the high-priest should come in from attending Caesar's
  <i>lev&eacute;e</i> and presenting a petition to him. Since the day when
  Quintus had been taken back to the Tullianum, Cornelia had never ceased to
  implore to be admitted to the dungeon, where she thought she could bend her
  lover's obduracy; for she was convinced that nothing but a proud spirit of
  defiance had prompted his retractation at the last moment.</p>

  <p>"You do not know how to coax and entreat him," she had said to the high-
  priest. "Your very requests sound like commands, and leave a sting in his
  wounded pride. But I am a woman, his betrothed; I love him, and I will
  implore him! His heart will soften, as soon as he hears my voice."</p>

  <p>She had thus persuaded Titus Claudius, who, though he felt that Cornelia
  did not fully understand his son's character, thought he ought not to neglect
  this last possibility. But unluckily he met with unexpected hindrances. The
  governor of the prison, supported by higher authority, positively refused her
  admission, and the priest's declaration that he would take all the
  responsiblity on his own shoulders, produced no effect whatever.</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius applied to the city-prefect, but a long discussion only led
  to the same result. Some one, it was evident, must have an interest in the
  complete isolation of the illustrious prisoner, and that some one must be of
  exalted rank. A visit to Clodianus was equally unsuccessful. Indeed, the
  adjutant displayed a rough and uncompromising severity, which was startling
  in a man who was not wont to deal thus with persons of position and
  influence, and the Flamen quitted him in high wrath. The meeting seemed to
  have resulted in a lasting coolness, not to say hostility, between the two
  officials. But this step, too, on the adjutant's part was the result of
  calculation. If Caesar should hear of the matter&mdash;and he was certain to
  hear of it, for there were witnesses present&mdash;he could no longer doubt
  the devotion of his faithful Clodianus. He, at least, was a true and
  trustworthy servant, who would rather make an enemy of the powerful
  high-priest, than abridge by one iota the laws and interests of the State,
  which in the present instance were so surprisingly identical with the private
  interests of Caesar himself.</p>

  <p>On leaving Clodianus, Titus Claudius betook himself to the chamberlain
  Parthenius. Still the same refusal, though wrapped here in the utmost ouTness
  and reverence&mdash;but it could not be, it was simply impossible. If in
  anything else Parthenius could oblige his illustrious friend, he would devote
  himself to the cause with all the indefatigable zeal he had before now
  displayed in the service of a man so highly venerated, world-renowned and
  distinguished.</p>

  <p>After two or three more attempts to interest influential personages in the
  matter, the high-priest resolved on laying his request before Caesar himself,
  though it went hard with him to appear as a petitioner in his own behalf. And
  now, for the past half-hour he had been waiting at the palace.</p>

  <p>The family, and particularly Cornelia, awaited his return with eager
  anxiety, and at every step on the pavement the excited girl started and
  shivered. Her hands clutched the arms of her seat; her breath came quickly,
  and her face was as white as marble. If this last chance failed! Alas, and
  Cornelia had only too much reason to regard failure as certain! Domitian,
  that incarnation of hatred and revenge&mdash;it was too much to hope for!
  Domitian, whom she had scorned and humiliated, as a queen might treat a
  slave&mdash;was it likely that he would allow her to save the man she loved?
  And yet, if anyone could wring this permission from the tyrant by the mere
  weight of personal influence, it was the Flamen.</p>

  <p>The minutes went by&mdash;a quarter of an hour&mdash;half an hour. Hardly
  a word was spoken. Claudia held a book and tried to read, but could not get
  beyond the first three lines. Lucilia sat gazing at the floor and gave
  herself up to sad fancies; that delightful day at Ostia now and then rose
  before her memory&mdash;what a difference the little time that since elapsed
  had wrought in three happy young creatures! Cornelia's lover in a dungeon,
  Claudia's under sentence as a traitor, self-banished and far away, never to
  return perhaps&mdash;while she, Lucilia&mdash;she, to be sure, had no lover,
  no falsehood, no one to care for her&mdash;but she felt for all that
  concerned Cornelia and Claudia, and she herself had been happy too in that
  peaceful country home, oh so happy! That good old Fabulla, how kind she had
  been, how anxious to please her guests, how full of sympathy were her clear
  honest eyes. And those eyes were now perhaps not less tearful than
  Claudia's&mdash;who so often wept at night when she thought Lucilia was
  asleep&mdash;for her only son Cneius Afranius was one of the fugitives too.
  How sad for her to miss the accustomed greeting and kiss, never to hear that
  honest manly voice. Yes, sad indeed&mdash;everything was sad&mdash;poor
  unfortunate mother?</p>

  <p>Lucilia was wiping away a tear, that had fallen unbidden down her own
  cheek when, with a loud cry, she started from her seat.</p>

  <p>There in the door-way stood, in the flesh, the very subject of her
  compassion. Fabulla, announced by Baucis, had come in, and, with a thousand
  assurances of her dutiful respect, begged to be forgiven her venturing to
  intrude her presence on the illustrious family of the high-priest. But for
  ten days she had had no news of her son, her letters had remained unanswered;
  a messenger she had sent to his residence had found the house locked up. So,
  in her despair, she had come herself to Rome, and as she did not know another
  living soul in the city, she had thought of the noble young men and ladies,
  who had done her the honor of visiting her at Ostia.</p>

  <p>While she was thus explaining herself in spasmodic haste, Lucilia had
  rushed to meet her, had affectionately taken her hand and made her welcome;
  and Octavia bowed politely and begged her to be seated, for she must be
  tired. Claudia, however, and Cornelia particularly, seemed too much absorbed
  in their own thoughts to take much notice of the new arrival. This Lucilia
  remarked, and as Titus Claudius might now be expected at any moment, she
  thought she would be doing both her family and her friend a kindness, by
  taking Fabulla into another room, to give her the information she wished. She
  easily found some simple excuse and took Fabulla upstairs, just as she heard
  the measured tread of the master of the house in the atrium.</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius came into the room with the most perfect calmness; a faint
  tinge of color alone betrayed, that he had gone through some severe trial to
  nerves and temper.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing now to prevent your visit to the prison," he said
  gently; but then he sat down, and, in a hoarse voice, asked for a draught of
  water.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible?" said Cornelia, rushing up to him. "I may see him? You
  have settled it?"</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius signed to her to have patience; a slave brought him the
  water, and he drank it in a long, deep gulp.</p>

  <p>"It was a hard matter," he said, seeing they all were eagerly awaiting his
  words; "Caesar was not at all like himself He received me coolly, almost
  repellent."</p>

  <p>"You," cried Octavia, starting up, "his most faithful adherent?"</p>

  <p>"He fancied I was about to ask some favor for the imprisoned
  Nazarene.&mdash;And, in that case, Octavia, he would have had a right to be
  angry with me, for my petition would have imperilled the State. Laws are not
  made, to be evaded at the first case that occurs. That Caesar should have so
  misunderstood me.&mdash;It makes my face burn with shame and indignation only
  to think of it! I explained to him, perhaps in too strong terms, that he was
  mistaken. What Titus Claudius could ask was forbidden by no law, only by the
  over-carefulness of his officials. I then told him all I had done, in the
  hope of disarming their precautions^ and how I had at every turn met with the
  same refusal; that I had at last come to the determination to come before
  him, the fount of all justice and clemency, and so gain my end beyond a
  doubt, though at the cost of troubling his sovereign majesty. He, no doubt,
  would allow me a privilege, which had never before been refused to any one. I
  was ready to pledge my life for it, that the course of justice would be in no
  way interfered with. Caesar was gloomy, almost wrathful, and he looked at me
  with an expression I never saw in him before. However, he granted my request.
  He sent to Parthenius at once..."</p>

  <p>"Your firmness and dignity were too much for him," said Octavia, with a
  sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"And when&mdash;when?" asked Cornelia.</p>

  <p>"As soon as you like. Two of my slaves will accompany you. This snake-
  ring, with my signet, will be your token."</p>

  <p>He drew off a ring, broken in its continuity as the law prescribed, and
  gave it to the girl, who was trembling with joy.</p>

  <p>"Not an instant will I lose," she cried excitedly. "You will see, his
  pride will melt like the snow on Soracte when spring returns."</p>

  <p>She hurried out into the atrium in front of the slaves, and got into her
  litter.</p>

  <p>The governor of the prison had been duly warned; he came himself to the
  gate, and received the visitor with the politeness which seemed due to her
  misfortunes, her dignified demeanor, and her beauty, even more than to her
  rank and position. When she showed him the ring, which Titus Claudius had
  lent her, the governor bowed, as though to say that no such guarantee was
  needed. He begged her, however, to leave the slaves with the litter-bearers,
  and to follow him unescorted to the cell, where she was to be allowed a
  strictly private interview with Quintus. In an hour he would return and
  conduct her back.</p>

  <p>The door turned heavily on its hinges, and with a half-suppressed cry of
  rapture and sorrow, Quintus and Cornelia were in each other's arms. Pain and
  love, despair and hope, broke in that cry from their trembling hearts.</p>

  <p>After the first storm of feeling had subsided, Cornelia took her lover's
  hand, and looked up to him like a child beseeching a favor.</p>

  <p>"Quintus," she began tenderly, "how cruel you have grown. Do men then
  understand the meaning of no other word than Pride? Must everything be
  sacrificed to that idol&mdash;even all that is sweetest and most sacred? Your
  father&mdash;but why should I speak of others, when no one can suffer so much
  as I do! Woe, woe, and three times woe on the pride of your house! Accident
  threw you in the way of these Nazarenes, and so you have pledged yourself to
  defend their cause, even unto death, as if it were your own!"</p>

  <p>"It is mine," said Quintus, sadly looking at the ground.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes! you will say so. A Claudius is not to be frightened into
  yielding! That is grand, magnanimous!&mdash;But what threats cannot do, love
  may. Quintus, only reflect, only think; try to comprehend all that your
  refusal involves. You are the son of a family whose happiness is centred in
  you, and the very idol of a devoted girl, who must die.&mdash;Do you hear me,
  Quintus? I shall die, if this hideous law hurts even a hair of your head. But
  I know, I know: in the eyes of a Roman and a Claudius, the only virtue is to
  persist in a thing you have once undertaken. Your poets praise tenacity as
  the crown of glory.<a href="#98">98</a> You would rather run headlong into
  error, than turn round and seek the right path. But in this case,
  Quintus&mdash;you must own it yourself&mdash;there is a tenacity, a
  wilfulness, which is a crime. You cannot possibly regard the wild stories of
  these Nazarenes as true?"</p>

  <p>"As the only truth, that is known to man."</p>

  <p>"What? Is it you, my own Quintus&mdash;proud, wise, high-
  spirited&mdash;who say this? Have you waited for me to tell you, that all
  belief in the gods, be their names what they may, is as hollow as a gilded
  nut which a child or a fool takes for gold...?"</p>

  <p>"Belief in the gods&mdash;yes, Cornelia; but not belief in God. One word
  may have many and various meanings. The gods&mdash;is the name the people
  give to those idols of the imagination, to which they attribute human
  passions and weaknesses. Dionysus is a god&mdash;and Silenus!<a href=
  "#99">99</a> But what we call God, dear Cornelia, has nothing in common with
  those empty mockeries. Our God dwells not in a temple made with hands. Our
  God is a Spirit, and the very essence of all that lives in us, round us and
  above us, and that stirs our souls to joy and sorrow. He is in the light that
  shines from heaven; the blossom that unfolds in Spring; the passions that
  bind your heart to mine, and the courage that will support me to face death
  without blenching, for the faith's sake."</p>

  <p>"Death!" cried Cornelia in despair. "Quintus&mdash; my darling; Death! But
  the light of heaven and the flowers of Spring, and all that is lovely in us
  and around us bid us live. If you, my dearest, believe what I can never,
  never again believe: that higher powers rule our existence, well and good;
  indulge and cherish the consoling thought; nurse it as a gardener nurses his
  flowers; but what can compel you to confess the secret to all the world? What
  can drag you so irresistibly to cast in your lot with that abominable sect,
  of whom the very best is not worthy to kiss the dust from off* your
  feet?"</p>

  <p>"The Master's will. Those who have known salvation, find their highest and
  sublimest duty in laboring together in the great work of redemption. Without
  knowing it themselves, suffering hearts are striving and groaning towards
  that light, which they now think so dim and contemptible. You have lost your
  faith in a divinity, because the form of your belief was false and hollow.
  Until you have got past this condition of negative and comfortless mistrust,
  you will never be able to understand me. I shall not even attempt to make it
  clear to you, and will say only one thing: In spite of all my love for you
  and my family&mdash;a love beyond words&mdash;in spite of the youthful blood
  that dances in my pulses&mdash;I cannot do otherwise! I am, and shall die a
  Christian."</p>

  <p>"Quintus a Christian! Turning from Cornelia, to bleed in an arena with
  slaves and workmen out of the Subura! And we had so fondly, so confidently
  dreamed of a happy future! An empty, worthless formula is dearer to him, than
  my spoilt and ruined life!"</p>

  <p>"A formula! Ah! if it were only that. There is no humiliation I would not
  submit to for your sake."</p>

  <p>Cornelia sat closer to him and threw her arms round him.</p>

  <p>"Quintus!" she cried, bursting into tears "Do not refuse my entreaties.
  See with what bitter tears I implore you for mercy. I will be your slave, I
  will worship you all my life. Only have pity on my wretchedness! Speak the
  word, oh Quintus, say I may hope!"</p>

  <p>"Cornelia, you break my heart&mdash;but I cannot; God help me, but I
  cannot!"</p>

  <p>Cornelia stood up.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said coldly, "where you stay, I stay. We are pledged to
  each other, and I will keep my oath."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"You will see&mdash;Oh! the chains of my love are not so easily shaken
  off."</p>

  <p>She went to the door and knocked at it; the governor and the gaoler
  appeared at the summons.</p>

  <p>"You can keep me here," she said; "I too am a Nazarene."</p>

  <p>"She is raving!" said Quintus horrified. "She came to persuade me to
  renounce Christianity."</p>

  <p>"Your eloquence has converted me," she retorted scornfully. "Governor, do
  your duty. I confess myself guilty. The God of the Nazarenes is the only true
  God. Your Jupiter is a foolish, ridiculous image."</p>

  <p>The governor shook his head in bewilderment</p>

  <p>"Follow me then," he said doubtfully; "I will inform the city-prefect"</p>

  <p>"Quintus&mdash;farewell!" cried Cornelia, with a triumphant glance at her
  lover. "Think better of it, Quintus! or else we meet again face to face with
  the beasts in the arena!"</p>

  <p>Quintus stood petrified. The door was shut, the bolts rattled&mdash;their
  steps died away&mdash;he was alone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p>On the following day Titus Claudius presented himself a second time as a
  petitioner at the palace. Thus, under stress of circumstances, within a few
  hours the haughty man had twice been forced into a position which he had
  carefully avoided his whole life long.</p>

  <p>There was to-day no public reception. Caesar had risen late, and now, when
  the sun was already high over the Caelian hill, he was sitting with Clodianus
  and Parthenius in a room looking to the south-east. He knew full well why
  Titus Claudius craved an audience, for the city-prefect had informed him the
  day before of the strange occurrence in the Tullianum.</p>

  <p>When the high-priest perceived on entering, that the emperor was not
  alone, he involuntarily paused for an instant. Hitherto, when serious matters
  were under discussion, he had always enjoyed the privilege of a t&ecirc;te-
  &agrave;-t&ecirc;te interview with Caesar, and the letter in which he had
  asked admission to-day had expressly stated, that the occasion was strictly
  personal and private.</p>

  <p>Domitian rose, went a few steps to meet him and kissed him. Never before
  had this traditional formality seemed so meaningless and hypocritical to the
  high-priest, and there was an expression of such diabolical satisfaction on
  Caesar's face, that Titus Claudius for the first time felt an echo in his own
  mind of that public opinion, which he had hitherto so persistently rejected
  as prejudiced and unfair. What a smirk, what a suspicious play of features!
  Some new intrigue must have come in his way, some underhand transaction, and
  the high-priest's request might interfere with it! Titus Claudius had already
  had an inkling of this when, the day before, he had gained permission for
  Cornelia to visit the prison. It almost looked as though Caesar had kept the
  adjutant and the chamberlain about him, that their presence might be a
  preservative against any possible fit of amiability and weakness.</p>

  <p>"And what have you to say, my worthy Claudius?" asked Caesar, with cool
  formality.</p>

  <p>The high-priest looked him steadily and respectfully in the face.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he replied with much dignity, "I have again come to crave a
  favor. I do not know whether you have heard&mdash;my son's betrothed,
  stricken it would seem with sudden frenzy... "</p>

  <p>"I am informed of her crime," Domitian interrupted. "I pity you sincerely,
  but I cannot and ought not to weaken the arm of the law."</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius turned pale.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he began, drawing a painful breath, "I have come only to
  prevent the law from degenerating into blind cruelty. The law condemns the
  Nazarenes, but not a crazed girl who, in her desperate grief, feigns belief
  in their errors. Inform yourself^ my lord..."</p>

  <p>"The law judges of facts," Caesar threw in, "and not of feelings. None but
  the gods can read the souL Besides, how can you prove what you assert?"</p>

  <p>"I will attest it by the most solemn oaths. I know, for certain, that
  Cornelia loathes the superstitions of the Nazarenes. My lord, Titus Claudius
  sues only for her, not for&mdash;the other. That may guarantee the honesty q(
  my purpose. If I could only stoop to lie&mdash;it would be for him, and not
  for the niece of Cornelius Cinna."</p>

  <p>His lips quivered as he spoke, and Clodianus looked with sympathy at the
  man, lately so erect and haughty, now bent, his head drooping, his spirit
  crushed. Even Parthenius, cold as he was, felt that momentary qualm, of which
  a father's heart is conscious in seeing another parent suffer. Domitian alone
  was unmoved.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt, Claudius, that you speak the^ truth," he said with
  affected benevolence, "but my personal convictions have no right to speak,
  when the safety of the State is involved. And that safety would be
  endangered, if I were to yield to my feelings and to your wish, which so far,
  it is true, I can only guess. Is the city-prefect to set the prisoner free,
  that she may proclaim in every street: I am a Christian, but Titus Claudius
  has procured my pardon!...? You see, circumstances are too strong for
  me."</p>

  <p>The high-priest looked at the ground in silence. Certainly, if Cornelia
  persisted in her madness, Caesar was right.</p>

  <p>"Well, my lord," he began in a low, hoarse voice, "I confess that I had
  overlooked that contingency.</p>

  <p>She must, then, remain in confinement till her excited brain has recovered
  its balance. But one thing yet I would crave of 'your grace: remove her at
  least from the dungeon, and let her be kept in ward elsewhere. She is but a
  tender creature&mdash;deal with her as with a sick child, not as with a
  criminal."</p>

  <p>Domitian glanced meaningly at Parthenius, and he spoke with a sugared
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Our clemency," he said, "is never weary of obliging our friends. When so
  meritorious an official expresses a wish or a request, his sovereign must
  grant it&mdash;if it can possibly be reconciled with his duties and the
  prosperity of the State. It is well! I will run the risk of being accused of
  undue partiality, and have the girl held in custody here, in the Palatium,
  with all the respect due to her. She will hardly feel her imprisonment even
  as a check upon her freedom; only she must on no consideration quit the
  apartments I shall assign to her. You see, my worthy friend, how truly
  Domitian inclines to leniency.<a href="#100">100</a> Nay more, I will
  endeavor to mitigate the severity of Quintus' incarceration. Only, do not ask
  more than I ought to grant."</p>

  <p>"I thank you," said Claudius, drawing himself up. "I am glad you consent
  to be lenient with Cornelia. But, as regards my son&mdash;no, my lord; the
  horrors of imprisonment are my last hope. Solitude, misery, hunger&mdash;by
  these, if at all, his proud spirit may be broken. If this should be the
  result, if he repents of his errors and does due penance&mdash;then indeed I
  will advance a claim on the mercy of the Ruler of the world."</p>

  <p>Caesar dismissed him, and the high-priest, utterly exhausted by the
  tension of this brief interview, hurried home, and shut himself up in his own
  study. There was a bitter distrust lurking in his mind, like the after-taste
  of some nauseous draught. Caesar had, at last, been gracious. And
  yet&mdash;that first impression was ineffaceable. Here, in the privacy of
  home, he felt all that was wounding in that reception more keenly than at the
  moment. A strange spasm in his throat seemed to choke him, a dull headache
  weighed upon his brow, and the blood throbbed in his temples. He had been
  pacing the room, but suddenly his knees gave way, he dropped into a chair,
  and all grew dark before his eyes. But presently he staggered to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"I shall be ill," he said to himself. "Hold up, miserable body! your task
  is not yet ended! You must not and shall not give way, till the last
  resources have been tried, and the last hope is dead."</p>

  <p>And the mere will of this man of iron was strong enough at this appeal to
  seem to work a miracle. Titus Claudius was firmer, calmer, and stronger at
  once, and a draught of icy-cold water completely restored his powers.</p>

  <p>He went to join Octavia, to inform her as to the issue of his efforts. He
  found her alone; but in the adjoining room, with the door half open, Baucis
  was sitting and chattering, it would seem to herself. The priest closed the
  door and told his story, and his manner and way of speaking were reassuring.
  As he spoke the name of Quintus, Octavia sighed deeply, but her looks showed
  that she had not yet given up her hope of a happy ending to their trouble.
  When her husband had done speaking, she went up to him with the gentle and
  almost childlike reverence with which she always treated him, and took his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"My dearest," she said, looking at him through her tears, "what have you
  not had to suffer in these dreadful times of sorrow and terror! If only I
  could relieve you of the whole burden of anxiety! We women succumb and bend,
  and the weight is less intolerable. But you&mdash;proud, unyielding, you hold
  up your head and stiffen your neck and suffer doubly."</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius embraced her in silence, and she leaned her head on his
  shoulder and wept. He gently smoothed her still abundant hair and said, half-
  unconsciously: "Save your tears, Octavia! save your tears... "</p>

  <p>"You will need them in a worse hour than this," he would have added, but
  he realized what he was saying in time to check himself. He clasped her more
  closely and only saying: "Farewell for the present," he turned to leave the
  room.</p>

  <p>"You are going?" she said disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I have business to attend to."</p>

  <p>"What, again to-day? I thought the most pressing work was now all
  over."</p>

  <p>The priest sadly shook his head.</p>

  <p>"So long as our Quintus lies pining in a dungeon, I cannot have an hour's
  rest. What I must do, how and where to set to work&mdash;I have no idea. But
  I must try everything&mdash;everything. And alas! Rome is a wide world, and
  the roads are endless, dear Octavia&mdash;if only one of them might lead to
  the goal. Yes, one does&mdash;that I know full well&mdash;but it is a bloody
  and thorny path "</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you."</p>

  <p>"No?" said the priest with a strange smile. "Well, if the law demands a
  victim, it might be possible to effect an exchange. The few years I have to
  live&mdash;what can they matter? If the father's grey head were given for the
  son's young life&mdash;Justice would lose nothing."</p>

  <p>"What are you saying?" cried Octavia horrified. "By Jupiter the all-
  merciful, cast off these hideous thoughts! You will save him&mdash;but not at
  such a cost! Go, there is none like you! My heart at every throb is always
  with you."</p>

  <p>At this instant Lucilia came into the room, flushed with eagerness; she
  had on a long full cloak, as though prepared to go out.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" asked Octavia, and the priest paused in the door-
  way.</p>

  <p>"I have just returned from the house of Cneius Afranius, and I am now
  going out with Claudia. I only wanted to hear what news my father had brought
  of Cornelia.</p>

  <p>Octavia told her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that is good indeed!" said Lucilia delighted. "For my part I have
  always hoped for the best; for I cannot believe that Quintus ever really
  joined those meek imposters&mdash;or even mixed with slaves and vagabonds.
  The whole thing must soon be cleared up; I wish it were equally so hopeful
  for some other folks.&mdash;Poor old Fabulla! only think, mother, her son's
  name is really on the list of the proscribed, and it seems he is more hated
  at the Palatium than all the rest. His house has been broken into by the
  city-prefect and every comer of it searched; they say they mean to raze it to
  the ground. The poor woman is half-crazed, and I had to promise her that, as
  soon as matters were settled for Quintus and Cornelia, I would go and spend a
  few days with her at Ostia. She is afraid she shall go out of her mind in her
  utter solitude. But I must go now; Claudia is waiting for me in the litter.
  Ye gods! what a time of bustle and scurry; I never have a minute to
  myself&mdash;well&mdash; good-bye for the present!"</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius looked sadly after her.</p>

  <p>"And she does not see either, what is hanging over our heads!" he said
  half to himself. Then he went through the atrium and out of the house,
  followed by a few of his clients.</p>

  <p>Domitian meanwhile had made arrangements for fulfilling his pledge as soon
  as possible, for the turn affairs had taken was precisely what he could have
  wished. Without arousing any kind of suspicion, he could thus have the girl
  in his power. Neither craft nor mystery was needed; in a simple, honorable
  and perfectly legal manner, he was attaining the end which, since the tragi-
  comic scene in the temple of Isis, had become a fixed . idea with him.
  Barbillus, indeed, seemed to have set about the task assigned to him in a
  very questionable manner, and now his wily agency could be altogether set
  aside.</p>

  <p>Almost at the very moment when Lucilia got into her litter, after her
  short interview with her parents, another litter, closely curtained and
  escorted by a small party of the imperial body-guard, was being carried by a
  circuitous route, past the Circus Maximus<a href="#101">101</a> to the
  Palatine Hill. Arrived at the Palatium, out stepped Cornelia, confused and
  agitated, a pathetic image of anguish and despair. The events now befalling
  her, and a well- founded suspicion of what awaited her, filled her soul with
  apprehension; she had lost all her self-command, and trembled like a
  reed.</p>

  <p>Parthenius received her with marked politeness, and begged her pardon in
  flowery language for his inability, under the law, to set her at liberty at
  once. That, he admitted, was unhappily out of the question; but her durance
  should be made so easy and agreeable, that the fair Cornelia could not but
  forgive him. Titus Claudius, who&mdash;as she no doubt knew&mdash;had the
  greatest influence over Caesar, had made interest with their imperial
  sovereign to spare her the horrors of the Mamertine prison; she was therefore
  to spend the interval till the decision of her case in the Palace itself</p>

  <p>He led the way through the pillared halls, and Cornelia mechanically
  followed. But she kept her right hand tightly clasped over a spot in her
  breast- belt.<a href="#102">102</a> There, ever since that night of the
  Osiris performance, she had kept a small phial of poison. She was determined
  to be prepared for the worst. She had not a doubt that Caesar would, ere
  long, recommence his persecution; for such a failure was, to a man of his
  temper, reason enough in itself for a fresh attempt. Formerly Cornelia would
  have trusted to her maiden pride, her uncle's high rank, and to the aid of
  Isis the all-merciful. But now her pride had been deeply wounded, her uncle
  had deserted her, and Isis the all-merciful was dead. She must have some
  means of protection, which in the last extremity might save her from
  unthinkable shame, so she betook herself, as secretly as a criminal, to
  Bryonia,<a href="#103">103</a> a freed-woman of evil repute living by the
  wall of Servius Tullius, who kept a tavern much resorted to by the low
  population of the quarter, but who also prepared strong potions of hemlock,
  wolf's bane, and venomous sea-creatures, which she sold to the wealthy and
  noble for good gold coin. Cornelia's desire to possess herself of a dose of
  this poison, was strong enough to conquer all her loathing and to enable her
  to endure with cool composure the hag's mumbled enquiries as to whether it
  was a hated husband, a tyrannical guardian, or a successful rival she wished
  to get rid of. She paid the price and hid the tiny phial in her wide belt.
  There it was still&mdash;almost forgotten for a time under the stress of the
  events that had followed, but suddenly remembered again now, in the very den
  of the imperial tiger. Cornelia felt the hard edge of the crystal with a sort
  of sinister delight^ the contact seemed to revive her strength and
  resolution.</p>

  <p>The room, to which she was led, was indeed an effective contrast to the
  vaults of the Mamertine prison. Everything, that the most extravagant luxury
  of a luxurious age could contrive, was combined in this little room, which
  was lighted by a skylight of costly glass panes. Carpets of the rarest kinds,
  magnificent flowers and plants in jars, soft pillows and couches of gorgeous
  colored stuffs, columns of onyx and ornaments of beaten gold&mdash;it was a
  perfect casket&mdash;of the most enchanting aspect, and well adapted to
  impress a girl whose keen sense of beauty had been cultivated by wealthy
  surroundings. And in point of fact, notwithstanding her miserable plight, she
  could not help feeling the charm as pleasant and restful. She drew a deep
  breath, the atmosphere was full of aromatic perfume, and yet as pure and
  fresh as the mountain air that fanned the heights of Tibur.</p>

  <p>"Here I will leave you," said the chamberlain. "Two slave-girls await your
  commands in the next room." He pointed to a heavy gold-fringed curtain. "Here
  you are absolute mistress; there is nothing to remind you that you are a
  captive, but the step of the guard at your door, if you should happen to hear
  it. And&mdash;I may add&mdash;it rests with yourself to cast off even these
  light fetters, as soon as you will. Farewell&mdash;fair Cornelia. I shall
  often allow myself the honor of enquiring as to your needs or wishes."</p>

  <p>He bowed low and went out; Cornelia could hear him speaking a few words to
  the guard outside, and then his steps died away in the labyrinth of
  passages.</p>

  <p>Cornelia, fairly exhausted, sank upon a seat and rested her head on her
  hand. Her eyes slowly filled with scalding tears, that gathered and rolled
  down her cheeks. To what straits had she been brought! Her lover in a prison
  and devoted to certain death&mdash;she herself offered the choice of the last
  conceivable disgrace, or of sharing his fate. Of what use was it to hope? If
  Quintus could resist the attack of her besieging, imploring love, it was only
  too certain that his delusions had overthrown his mind.</p>

  <p>She abandoned herself unresistingly to her crushing grief&mdash;but
  suddenly she started up. She remembered where she was; she realized all the
  hideous significance of this transfer, which the unsuspecting Flamen had
  accepted as an unqualified favor. She looked round her, and the sneering face
  of the tyrant seemed to leer at her through the elegance of the room. A sense
  of unutterable desertion came over her, and with her head thrown back and her
  arms flung up as if in desperate supplication, she gazed at the blue autumn
  sky which looked down upon her, pale and remote, through the round
  skylight.</p>

  <p>"Ah, miserable fate!" she cried, clenching her fists. "Why are you so
  empty and cold, ye skyey spaces? Why does no heart dwell beyond you, that can
  feel for us below&mdash;no merciful spirit, that can understand what crushes
  our souls? Oh Isis! Isis! With what fervor have I not besought Thy favor
  I&mdash;and if Thou Art&mdash;if, anything resembling Thee exists beyond the
  stars 1&mdash; but no; if Thou wert Isis, who should fear Thee more than Thy
  priest? And he&mdash;he despises and desecrates Thee. It is ah invention of
  the brain, an illusion, a fable; and in my quaking heart all is wretched and
  hopeless enough without that fable."</p>

  <p>She ceased to look upwards, her gaze fell, and she fixed her eyes on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"There is none," she said, with dull conviction. "No help&mdash;but in
  Bryonia's potion."</p>

  <p>She paced the room, and her steps fell silently on the thick, soft
  rugs.</p>

  <p>"A gilded cage indeed!" she muttered, looking round her. Then she went to
  the door-way, and raised the curtain. Two handsome slave-girls were lying on
  fine panther skins; they seemed to be sleeping, but at the rustle of the
  curtain they started up.</p>

  <p>"Lie still," said Cornelia, with a melancholy smile, and they needed no
  second telling. They had perhaps spent the night as dancing-girls, or in
  waiting late on their master's orders; their pale, olive faces were weary and
  worn.</p>

  <p>Cornelia studied the details of this second room. It was completely fitted
  as a bedroom, with everything that a Roman lady of rank could need for her
  elaborate toilet. A deeply-cushioned couch filled up all one wall to the
  left, and opposite to her was a door. Cornelia went past the sleeping
  handmaids and opened it. It led into a third room, small, dark and square,
  intended apparently as an eating-room. When the chandelier which hung from
  the ceiling should be lighted, this room also might look rich and
  comfortable, but it had no entrance excepting through the cubiculum. All the
  rooms were lighted above; this third room through a kind of shaft, that
  pierced the ceiling obliquely. Thus the outer world was completely
  excluded.</p>

  <p>Cornelia now returned to the first room, and tried whether the door,
  through which she and the chamberlain had entered, was bolted on the outside.
  At a slight touch the two ebony wings turned easily on their hinges, and the
  young girl, with her swift impulses, was on the point of acting on her hope
  of liberty, when a glance at each end of the corridor showed her that she had
  been too hasty; three of the Praetorian Guard, in full armor, were posted at
  each exit.</p>

  <p>One of them came up to her, and asked, half-respectfully but half-
  ironically, if she had any orders. He was a gigantic Gaul, stalwart and
  broad- shouldered, with a good-humored look in his face.</p>

  <p>"Do you take orders from a prisoner?" said Cornelia, haughtily.</p>

  <p>"Why yes, mistress," said the soldier. "And, by Hercules! they will be
  fulfilled with zeal. Sooner or later "</p>

  <p>But he broke off; Cornelia's lofty gravity confused him.</p>

  <p>"What were you about to say?" she asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>"I only meant... If you and Caesar&mdash;if you were
  reconciled&mdash;Caesar is very good-natured to the ladies&mdash;he loves.
  You might pay us off, if..."</p>

  <p>"Man!" interrupted Cornelia, quivering with rage. "What do you take me
  for?"</p>

  <p>"For all that is sweet and lovely," said the man much disconcerted. But
  Cornelia heard him not; she had gone back into the room, and flung herself in
  despair upon a divan. Convulsive sobs choked her, but presently the tears
  came, and at last, after crying silently for a long time, she fell asleep.
  But even in her slumbers her hand still clutched the little phial of
  poison.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p>It was late in the afternoon, when Cornelia woke from her swoon-like
  sleep. She felt crushed and racked in every limb, and her head ached madly.
  She rose and went into the next room. The slave-girls were gone, and in the
  inner room she heard a clatter as of laying the table. She opened the door,
  and saw the two girls busy, with two Nubians dressed in yellow, in arranging
  a supper with costly Murrhina vessels, cups, wine-jugs, and flower-vases. The
  five- branched lamp that hung from the ceiling was lighted, and she could see
  that the walls were colored bright-red, while beautiful figures of the gods,
  each a masterpiece, stood out from this strong background. All the furniture
  was of pure silver, richly and tastefully wrought; particularly the couches,
  which were of fine incised work, and covered with sky-blue cushions.</p>

  <p>As she stood there a trap-door opened in the marble floor&mdash;the head
  and shoulders of a slave came up through it, and a fresh load of flowers,
  just gathered, were taken from him by the two slave-girls.</p>

  <p>"What does all this mean?" asked Cornelia.</p>

  <p>"It means, my pretty one," said a voice in Greek, dose at her elbow, "that
  it is nearly supper-time, and that Caesar will do you the great honor of
  permitting you to eat at the same table with himself."</p>

  <p>She turned round, and before her, in full dress, stood Parthenius.</p>

  <p>"Such a favor is quite unmerited," said Cornelia, summoning up all her
  courage. "I am wearied, worn out, almost too ill..."</p>

  <p>"Oh! the presence of the sovereign works wonders. Be fresh and gay,
  Cornelia. True wisdom is at home everywhere. Only children and old men pout
  to get their own way."</p>

  <p>"But do you consider of what crime I am accused? Caesar derogates from his
  majesty, by sitting at table with a criminal."</p>

  <p>"Oh! but clemency is the prerogative of the crown. One word from the
  sovereign wipes out any crime."</p>

  <p>He nodded significantly, and went back into the outer room. Cornelia stood
  at if rooted to the spot; but presently, recovering her presence of mind, she
  rushed after Parthenius. She threw herself on the ground before him, and
  clasped his knees.</p>

  <p>"Let me go, take me away again&mdash;back to prison&mdash;straight to
  execution&mdash;wherever you will; only away from that hated presence, that
  hideous fate! Have pity, have mercy, Parthenius."</p>

  <p>The courtier shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You take the matter too hardly," he said, raising her politely. "Be
  brave, and divest yourself of all prejudice. The situation is a simple one.
  Your lover has fallen under the law; what then can you lose, by raising the
  veil of maidenly coyness a little? Moreover, a thoughtless speech has placed
  you in a position to fear unpleasant consequences. These of course will be
  spared, if you show yourself amenable to&mdash;reason. Nay, if for old
  attachment's sake, you feel any strong desire to save that perverse Quintus
  .Claudius from the last extremity, even in this&mdash;I am well
  assured&mdash;Caesar's clemency may be easily obtained if&mdash;of
  course...You understand."</p>

  <p>At every word, that Parthenius spoke, Cornelia turned colder and paler.
  The choice, then, that lay before her was between the last disgrace, that
  could befall a woman and a Roman&mdash;and the death of the man she loved,
  ah! so passionately. Both were alike unbearable&mdash; and now, as this was
  borne in upon her consciousness, she felt clearly that a third alternative
  must at any risk be attempted&mdash;even if it were the maddest ever dreamed
  of by mortal creature. And for that she must gain time; she must detain
  Caesar, put him off, seem to fall into his horrible trap, deceive him,
  entangle him.&mdash; Some good genius would suggest to her how, where, and
  when the chance for safety offered. Despair is so ingenious, and makes us so
  cool, so steady, so keen- sighted.</p>

  <p>Parthenius supposed that Cornelia's calm reflections were the result of
  his worldly-wise harangue.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my child," he went on, "that is how matters stand, and you will do
  well to reckon with the factors as they are given you. Do you think you know
  Rome, my good Cornelia? Nay&mdash;you only know the narrow, cross-grained,
  little world, that your uncle chose you should see. If you had eyes for all
  that goes on round you, you would make no difficulties. Did not Julia enjoy
  the most splendid position, although her connection with Caesar was a breach
  of morals, as it is called? Is there anywhere in good society a single
  married woman, who has not a dozen of lovers? And do the clients and slaves
  bow less low before her? Men must live their lives."</p>

  <p>Cornelia's heart sickened in loathing of the man, but she looked him
  steadily in the face.</p>

  <p>"What?" she asked with affected innocence; "would it, do you think, be no
  sin before the gods?"</p>

  <p>"The gods! What are the gods? Are you afraid of the image you stitch into
  linen with colored yam? And what you call the gods are just such images, in
  the web of human culture. Children are frightened at them, when you show them
  the bogie for the first time..."</p>

  <p>These were the very thoughts, that had passed through Cornelia's mind a
  score of times during the last few days. How was it then, that this
  confirmation from the chamberlain's lips sounded so revolting? How was it,
  that the courtier's utterance of them almost roused her to denial, and that
  her heart refused to ratify the conclusions, which her reason had so lately
  approved?</p>

  <p>But she had no time for these reflections. She must play a part&mdash;the
  part of a yielding, over-persuaded victim. She shuddered with hatred and
  disgust as she thought of it, but there was no choice.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she sighed. "Caesar's commands would not have terrified me half so
  much, if it had not been for the recollection&mdash;I do not know whether you
  heard&mdash;Barbillus, that mean trickster..."</p>

  <p>Of course she knew that Parthenius had long since been fully informed of
  all that had taken place in the sanctuary of Isis; otherwise how should
  Caesar have employed him to prepare the way for his own coming? But she
  affected innocence so skilfully, that the courtier was deceived.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," he said; "I know all about it."</p>

  <p>"Then you can understand, that I must have been frightened. If Caesar had
  not been so violent, if Barbillus had not so cruelly betrayed my confidence.
  I am sure&mdash;things might have been different."</p>

  <p>Parthenius smirked affably. "Well, well; all is well that ends well. This
  may be set right yet. I am truly delighted to find, that the account Caesar
  gave me of your obstinacy was exaggerated."</p>

  <p>"I, obstinate?" sighed Cornelia with the expression of a baby of ten. "Far
  from it. I love nothing so much as peace and quietness. But, you see&mdash;I
  am afraid of Caesar."</p>

  <p>As she said it, it sounded too helplessly foolish; but Parthenius,
  enchanted at his success, did not notice that she overacted the part.</p>

  <p>"You little simpleton," he said kindly. "Do not be uneasy. I will give him
  a hint. It is plain to any man, that a lily must be plucked with greater care
  than a cabbage. Though he likes cabbage now and then, does our gracious
  sovereign," he added with a laugh.</p>

  <p>Parthenius carried on this strange conversation some little time longer.
  Then, hearing steps outside, he signed to Cornelia to withdraw into the
  middle room, while he himself went to the entrance. He threw the door wide
  open, for it was the Emperor, followed by his favorite slave, little Phaeton
  who, by reason of his tender years, was reckoned as nobody in such
  circumstances. Domitian wore a long and ample lacerna, and had drawn the hood
  over his face. When the door was closed behind him, he threw off the wrap,
  and stood in a short-sleeved tunic of colored flowered stuff, with a gold
  fillet round his thin hairs, smiling mysteriously at the chamberlain.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said, glancing round the room.</p>

  <p>"All promises for the best, my lord! The fair one is by no means the
  monster you imagine. It was only the sudden flight, that turned her brain
  that evening. I have found her quite reasonable, most reasonable; and if the
  sight of your majesty does not prove too much for her again, I venture to
  predict..." A smile ended the sentence.</p>

  <p>"You are a finished master in all affairs of gallantry," said Caesar.
  "Ovid himself might take a lesson from you. But where is she, the lovely,
  aggravating Fury, who handled the lord of the universe with such rough
  defiance? Tell me now, Parthenius: Am I not infinitely kind? Is not my
  condescension far beyond everything you ever heard of? I might have snatched
  the fruit of the Hesperides by force, and I resign myself to wait till it
  drops into my lap, beguiled by all the arts of love. It is a stroke of
  genius, a refinement...! If it comes to the worst&mdash;of course&mdash;but
  you say you are sure."</p>

  <p>"I am sure you have only to be yourself, to be certain of victory."</p>

  <p>Cornelia overheard this dialogue, and she involuntarily made a gesture as
  if to throttle the hateful man, and she only resumed her indifferent air just
  in time, for at this moment the chamberlain raised the curtain, and in the
  next instant Domitian and Cornelia stood face to face.</p>

  <p>For some minutes the Emperor found no words. The presence of the noble
  girl, whom he now had so completely in his power, seemed to have deprived him
  of his presence of mind. He was deeply conscious, that this queenly Cornelia
  was no every-day quarry, and that few women in all Rome could compare with
  her for beauty.</p>

  <p>"To-day you will be my guest, fair Cornelia," he said at last, taking a
  step towards her. "Your crime is wiped out&mdash;for our clemency is
  boundless. In return I ask but one thing: a happy smile and a few kindly
  glances from those divine eyes. Will you grant me these, Cornelia? It is your
  sovereign, who sues to you?"</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Cornelia, "I will try."</p>

  <p>"You are as gracious as Amathusia!<a href="#104">104</a> Well, to-day
  Parthenius will share our meal&mdash;but to-morrow&mdash; to-morrow, say,
  beloved one&mdash;you will receive me alone?"</p>

  <p>"I will try," repeated Cornelia, looking down.</p>

  <p>Parthenius threw a triumphant glance at Domitian, a glance that seemed to
  expect some acknowledgment of the superior skill, which had so quickly
  converted the coy maiden into a docile child. And Caesar vouchsafed him a
  hasty nod. Then he took Cornelia by the hand, and, with an air of repulsive
  gallantry, led her into the little triclinium, where the slaves had by this
  time made everything ready. Caesar took his place on the middle couch, with
  Parthenius on his left hand, and Cornelia on his right. As each couch was
  intended to accommodate three persons, this arrangement placed them at some
  distance apart; a respectful distance, which Domitian intended as a sort of
  atonement for his vehemence on the former occasion. They had no one to serve
  them but the two slave-girls, helped by Phaeton.</p>

  <p>Cornelia had eaten nothing the whole day, and the dishes before her were
  the choicest productions of that great artist, Euphemus. Nevertheless she
  could hardly force herself to swallow a mouthful. Her throat seemed to close;
  her terrors increased every instant, and to give herself some courage, she
  emptied the gold cup of strong Falernian twice or three times.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was from a kindred feeling, that Caesar carried the goblet to
  his lips oftener than usual.&mdash;Gentle and humble as the beautiful girl
  seemed, who reclined there on the pillows, now and again he saw, in fancy,
  the haughty and indignant heroine.&mdash;It was not till he had drunk deeply,
  and the Falernian began to warm his blood, that he found some of the
  flattering phrases of a wooer. By degrees his eloquence grew freer and
  readier. He enlarged on the all-conquering might of beauty, before which even
  the gods themselves must bow; he dilated in rhetorical flights on the charms
  of a country life&mdash;asked for no greater happiness than to marry the vine
  with the elm,<a href="#105">105</a> to wield the harrow, the plough, and the
  pruning hook, and to live on fresh figs with honey and goat's milk. A few
  cups more, and his ecstatic mood had sunk to amorous melancholy. He spoke of
  the solitude of a throne, the aching void of a heart that beats unsatisfied
  even when nearing the grave; of "black care," which incessantly hovers round
  a crowned head.</p>

  <p>All this mawkish sentimentality, so ill-becoming the furrowed face stamped
  with the traces of the lowest vices, put the finishing touch to Cornelia's
  utter loathing. She almost repented not having frankly betrayed her aversion,
  in spite of every danger, and boldly faced death rather than submit to the
  approaches of this revolting reprobate. But the thought of Quintus kept her
  resolution up.</p>

  <p>A newer and heavier wine now sparkled in the cups. Caesar drank it unmixed
  with water, and the color took a deeper dye in his bald and polished
  forehead&mdash;the golden circlet had slipped backwards, his eyes were half
  shut, and he spoke thickly. He raised himself slowly and unsteadily from his
  couch.</p>

  <p>"Your health, sweet Cor-Cornelia," he stammered, supporting himself with
  his left hand against the table, while his right hand held the goblet. "I am
  happy to think that Aphrodite has touched your heart to kindness."</p>

  <p>He went towards her, and laid his hand on her round, white arm. She
  shuddered, but she kept still.</p>

  <p>Her mind was made up to endure to the very last limits of endurance, and
  then to cast off the mask of submission, and defend herself with all the
  strength of desperation. She hastily glanced at the side-table, where the
  slaves had set down the dishes; she hoped to see a carving-knife, but in
  vain. All the meat had come up ready carved<a href="#106">106</a> through the
  trap- door. There was no weapon available but the gold cup with its heavy
  foot&mdash;or, in the last extremity, Bryonia's terrible little phial.</p>

  <p>"Cornelia," he continued, still grasping her arm, "we anger the gods, if
  we scorn their gifts&mdash;and to-day&mdash;now&mdash;I feel so bright, so
  well, so happy&mdash;the present smiles on me.&mdash;Cornelia, speak..."</p>

  <p>Cornelia made a hasty movement, and freed her arm from his clutch; he
  tottered.</p>

  <p>"It is suffocatingly hot!" he said, looking up at the lamp.
  "Air&mdash;give me air! Only for an instant. Parthenius, give me your arm as
  far as the balcony!<a href="#107">107</a> the wine has bewildered me&mdash;or
  happiness&mdash;joy... Come, Parthenius. Only for five minutes, and then,
  sweet Cornelia, one last cup to consecrate our meeting."</p>

  <p>The chamberlain led him slowly away. Cornelia gazed after them like one
  dazed. Her face was bloodless. All the misery that this man had heaped upon
  her head, seemed to rise before her mind in that fearful moment: the
  relentless law to which Quintus was a victim, the exile of her venerated
  uncle, and the crushing, maddening disgrace which threatened her even
  now.</p>

  <p>She looked round her; the two slaves were standing with their backs to the
  table, and Phaeton had quitted the room.</p>

  <p>The next instant something bright sparkled in her trembling fingers; it
  was the phial she had received from the old woman. Just in front of her, full
  almost to the brim, stood the Emperor's goblet. She bent forward and poured
  the contents of the phial, all but a few drops, into the purple wine. But at
  the same instant she started back with a loud scream; before her, in the
  door-way, she saw Phaeton's pale face: he had seen all.</p>

  <p>The lad did not utter a word. He stared at the wine-cup as if paralyzed at
  the sight. A minute or two later Domitian and Parthenius returned. The
  Emperor went to his couch, without observing that Cornelia was lying half-
  senseless on hers. He was on the point of taking up the cup once more, and
  still the terrified boy found no utterance&mdash;but suddenly a shrill cry of
  anguish broke from him, and he threw himself at Caesar's feet.</p>

  <p>"Do not drink, my lord!" he cried, wringing his hands. "The wine is
  poisoned. She, there&mdash;look! She still has the phial in her hand!"</p>

  <p>Domitian had turned ashy-pale; it was only too evident that the boy spoke
  the truth.</p>

  <p>"The guard! call the guard!" he shrieked in the voice of an old hag; his
  teeth chattered, and his jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Is it true," Parthenius said, as Cornelia slowly pulled herself up, "what
  this boy says?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said with quivering lips. "I did what every woman, who deserves
  to be a Roman, would have done in my place. My honor is a thousand times more
  precious than that wretch's life!"</p>

  <p>Phaeton had flown into the corridor to fetch the guard. That instant of
  respite gave Cornelia time to lift the poisoned goblet to her lips. But
  before she had tasted it, Parthenius sprang upon her, and, with an adroit
  twist, spilt the contents of the cup.</p>

  <p>"Serpent!" snarled Caesar, "you will not get off so cheaply, do not fancy
  it."</p>

  <p>"Oh! she will soon find out, that Caesar's wrath postpones death till life
  has paid its utmost penalty!" said Parthenius. "From Caesar's arms to the
  rack and scaffold&mdash;that is your fate, audacious murderess."</p>

  <p>"Here come the Praetorians! Away with her t Throw her into chains. The
  governor of the prisons shall answer for it with his head, if she lays hand
  upon herself."</p>

  <p>Cornelia was more dead than alive. The soldiers bound her hands behind her
  back, and carried her half-fainting, out of the room.</p>

  <p>"You did well, Phaeton," said the Emperor, who was completely sobered by
  the shock. "Here, take this cup, which was so near being my death&mdash;I
  will give it to you in perpetual memory of the event. Henceforth you shall
  never quit my side, for eyes like yours do good service in these treasonable
  times."</p>

  <p>The lad humbly kissed his hand.</p>

  <p>"You put me to shame, my lord," he said steadfastly. "I only did my duty,
  and deserve no praises."</p>

  <p>"Only your duty!" echoed Domitian. "Then you are superior to all the
  millions, who own my sway. The world is rotten, rotten at the core&mdash;it
  must crumble into dust.&mdash;Come now, you two who are faithful. Take me
  away from this scene of murder.&mdash;Abandoned, mad wretch!"</p>

  <p>"Do not let it weigh too heavily on your mind," said Parthenius. "Women
  often have such crazes. If once a girl has taken it into her head, that she
  must guard her honor The greatest triumph you could now achieve, and the best
  punishment for the crime she dared to attempt, would be cold-blooded mockery
  and compulsion..."</p>

  <p>"The gods forbid!" cried Domitian in horror. "The woman is a demon. She
  would be quite capable of strangling me in her arms, or setting her teeth in
  my throat under pretence of a kiss. No, Parthenius, I renounce all
  pretensions to such flowers as these. Henceforth I acknowledge no claim but
  that of justice. Punishment, the extremest punishment, torment for body and
  soul, and a cruel death&mdash;these must be the retribution for such a crime.
  And that Quintus Claudius&mdash;it was for his sake she aimed the blow at my
  sacred head&mdash;he too shall feel what it is to have the sovereign of the
  world for his enemy."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p>The little town of Rodumna<a href="#108">108</a> lay half-hidden in olive-
  woods and vineyards, on the right bank of the Liger, in Gallia Lugdunensis.
  It had formerly been strongly fortified, but since the fall of the Republic
  it had lost its strategical and military importance. The foreign wars of the
  Empire were carried on far, far away on the northern and eastern frontiers,
  while internal convulsions had been constantly more and more centralized in
  Rome, since the rule of the Caesars had been fairly established, and a civil
  war in its original sense had almost ceased to be a possibility. Men lived
  faster in these days, and political changes were rougher and more summary.
  Thus, Rodumna had gradually dwindled in importance as a citadel; the walls
  had begun to fall into ruin, and were being overgrown with ferns and maiden
  hair. In Rome, and even in Lugdunum, men had something else to do than to pay
  any attention to this out-of-the-way little town, whose inhabitants, for
  their part, troubled themselves little enough about the affairs of the great
  world, and repaid contempt with indifference. Here reigned that idyllic peace
  "far from the madding crowd," which Horatius Flaccus had sung in his famous
  odes. The inhabitants, for the most part small land-owners or farmers, won
  from the surrounding lands all that they needed for actual existence, and
  even something more; produce which was sent either down the river in vessels
  to Decetia<a href="#109">109</a> and Noviodunum,<a href="#110">110</a> or in
  carts, over the ridge of mountains to the east, to the chief town of the
  province. The poorer inhabitants fished in the river, labored in humble toil,
  and kept a few taverns in which the thick and muddy wine of the country was
  sold.</p>

  <p>In the course of the last ten years several houses and villas had been
  built outside the town walls, often separated by wide tracts and surrounded
  by gardens, fields and groves, each a little world of itself.</p>

  <p>It was one of these isolated country-houses, the home of his old and
  paternal falsehood Rufinus, that Cneius Afranius had designated as the place
  of meeting for the conspirators. They were to concentrate on this point by
  the ides of February,<a href="#111">111</a> and meanwhile each was at work
  independently in different parts of the province. They were to assemble as
  quietly as possible, to report the success and prospects of their efforts,
  and to form their plans for future action.</p>

  <p>The eventful thirteenth of February had dawned. The evening before, Cneius
  Afranius and the Batavian, accompanied by his freedman Herodianus and Magus
  the Goth, had already met, and early in the morning, before sunrise, the
  others had arrived, most of them in extraordinary disguise. Ulpius Trajanus
  appeared dressed as a merchant from Palestine, Nerva, who was with him,
  played the part of his accountant&mdash;his former tutor. The snowy beard,
  which he had allowed to grow during the last few months, entirely concealed
  his identity. Even the one-armed centurion had been so cautious as to assume
  a disguise, though his name was not on the list of the proscribed. He was
  travelling as a Lusitanian dealer in amulets. Cinna, on the other hand, like
  Afranius and Aurelius, though with less reason, had regarded these
  precautions as unnecessary. He wore an ordinary travelling-cloak, gave
  himself out to be a Roman knight of Lilybaeum,<a href="#112">112</a> who had
  come on business connected with an inheritance to Lugdunum, Vesontio<a href=
  "#113">113</a> and Argentoratum,<a href="#114">114</a> and he trusted to his
  good fortune, which certainly had, so far, preserved him from any meeting
  with a too keen observer. Caius Aurelius had thought it wise to separate from
  Herodianus. The freedman's conspicuous appearance and unmistakable
  physiognomy made him a dangerous travelling-companion, and it was not till
  they were close to Rodumna, that the great worshipper of the Opimian
  wine-jar<a href="#115">115</a> had rejoined him&mdash;to his unspeakable
  delight&mdash;for, away from his beloved patron, to him the finest Caecubum
  tasted no better than the verjuice of Veii.</p>

  <p>Up to their present meeting, not one of the conspirators had been in a
  position of any real danger. Cinna attributed this to a certain amount of
  negligence and, perhaps, timidity in the administration. Of course he could
  not know, that the conspiracy had a noble and influential supporter in the
  Palatium itself, in the person of Clodianus, who, with all the zeal he seemed
  to devote to Caesar's interests&mdash;and especially to the work of
  persecution&mdash;nevertheless contrived, by the subtlest expedients of
  intrigue, to cripple every active effort, particularly if it originated with
  Parthenius, and who managed to combine an appearance of the greatest energy
  with absolute inaction. His master-stroke consisted in collecting a
  considerable mass of evidence, which convinced Domitian, and even the
  chamberlain, that the conspirators were to converge upon Rhaetia,<a href=
  "#116">116</a> and take that district as the basis of their operations. Thus,
  while Caesar's agents were searching and watching that province with eager
  haste and, misled by false reports, advanced farther and farther to the
  north, the conspirators in Gallia Lugdunensis were congratulating themselves
  on their unhoped-for liberty. One old and devoted client of the adjutant's
  was indeed cautiously endeavoring to track them&mdash;not to circumvent them
  as a foe, but because Clodianus wanted to open negotiations with them, and to
  further their plots against Domitian. This ambiguous conduct on his part was
  unexpectedly successful, mainly because for some days Parthenius had also
  betrayed a strange revulsion, and had ceased to urge on the persecutions with
  his original virulence. What could have caused this change in the
  man&mdash;whether it was his more intimate connection with the intriguing
  Massilian, Lycoris, or some secret understanding with the
  Empress&mdash;Clodianus could only guess. But, diligently as Parthenius
  strove to conceal the fact, he soon became aware of it, and with all his
  wonted elasticity he stretched out his feelers, so to speak, in order with
  all caution to investigate this new phenomenon.</p>

  <p>The friends at Rodumna had no suspicion of all this. Even the fact, that
  some unknown friend had warned them of the danger, could not put them on the
  track of such a wild and incredible idea. When, on board the Batavia, Nerva
  had referred to these warning letters, Cinna had attributed them to a
  mercenary betrayal on the part of some subordinate about the court, who thus
  perhaps gave vent to his own spite and disaffection, and counted on a reward
  at some favorable opportunity.</p>

  <p>Now, on the thirteenth of February, the villa near Rodumna was the scene
  of an agitated discussion. The owner of the house had taken the precaution of
  sending off all his slaves the day before, down the river to an outlying part
  of his property. Only two trustworthy men had been kept back, and these, as
  the sun rose over the hills, prepared a country breakfast for the assembled
  party, and then went with Magus into the garden, where they mounted watch
  over the high-road and carefully-barred gate. At the back of the house, where
  a small door-way opened to the south-east, Herodianus posted himself, in
  accordance with his particular wish. The songs of Pindar,<a href=
  "#117">117</a> and a jar of the best wine that Rufinus could produce&mdash;
  this was all he should need to keep his spirits up, even if the sitting
  should last until sundown.</p>

  <p>The centurion first made his report. His efforts had been chiefly directed
  to sounding the feeling of the common soldiers, and he had traversed the
  country in every direction. Everywhere he had been met with cautious reserve,
  or even with frank distrust. He had several times been taken for one of those
  imperial spies,<a href="#118">118</a> whose business it was to betray an
  incautious speaker into some rash utterance of opinion. These agents, who had
  hitherto been employed only in Rome, had, since Caesar's suspicions had grown
  to such a head, made their appearance among the troops stationed in the
  provinces, and had fomented much ill-feeling. It happened that Lugdunum had
  just lately been the scene of the cruel execution of an officer, who was
  universally beloved but who, under the influence of wine, had spoken some
  inconsiderate words and who had been denounced by one of these treacherous
  informers. The centurion had taken good care not to weaken this prejudice
  against himself, indeed he had occasi9nally risked his own safety in playing
  the part thus forced upon him. In other places, where he had not been
  suspected, but had been able to talk frankly and freely with the men, he
  found that two facts especially, as reported from the metropolis, had made a
  deep impression; one was the unhappy end of the miserable Julia, and the
  other Caesar's action against Cornelius Cinna. Cinna, he said, had already a
  strong and enthusiastic following among the common soldiers. It had never
  been forgotten in the army, that he had so often spoken in the Senate on
  their behalf and, more particularly, had taken their part against the unjust
  partiality shown to the Praetorian Guard, but he believed it would be harder
  to win over the military tribunes and the rest of the superior officers.
  Among them Domitian's ascendancy was on the whole undisputed.</p>

  <p>These were the most important results of the old centurion's experience;
  the assembly expressed their thanks and their admiration for his
  indefatigable energy, and the worthy man, whom Cinna and even Nerva had
  greatly undervalued&mdash;perhaps because they mistook his modesty for
  incapacity&mdash;rose at once to a high place in their estimation. Indeed, it
  presently proved that the enquiries of Trajan, Nerva and Cornelius Cinna had
  yielded relatively smaller results than those of this unpretending
  soldier.</p>

  <p>Ulpius Trajanus, who spoke next, frankly admitted that, in spite of all
  his efforts, he had only occasionally spoken to a few officers and
  centurions, and had convinced himself that, so far as he was concerned, he
  could not hope for any success excepting by declaring himself, particularly
  to the divisions of the troops he had formerly commanded.</p>

  <p>At these words Caius Aurelius seemed quite delighted&mdash;he evidently
  thought that the speaker had hit the turning-point of the whole
  discussion.</p>

  <p>"You know," Ulpius Trajanus went on, "that one of the three legions
  stationed here was under my command, in the campaign on the Rhine against the
  Germans.<a href="#119">119</a> My men were blindly devoted to me, and if I
  were to stand before them to-day and say: Soldiers, behold your general an
  exile, persecuted, hunted down, because he defends the cause of truth,
  justice and freedom.&mdash;I am convinced, especially after what our worthy
  centurion has told us, that they would rise as one man to resist the tyrant.
  The only question is, whether the adherence of one legion is enough as a
  beginning of the revolt; whether on the contrary so small a spark might not
  be at once trodden out. Ah! my friends, had I only guessed, when I led my
  army out of Hispania across the endless wastes of southern Gaul to the shores
  of the Rhine&mdash;had I only dreamed then, that the real enemy of our
  country dwelt in the Palatium! had I known that the eternal city was more
  gravely menaced by the canker at her heart, than by the wild hordes of the
  Teutobergian and Hercynian forests! But I was no more than a soldier,
  thinking of nothing but the task in hand, and never troubling my head about
  anything beyond the field of battle. At that time I could easily have
  overthrown the reign of terror, have set the Senate free to act, and so have
  obtained a legal verdict against the arch-traitor, who now treads our sacred
  rights under foot with impunity. Why did I not then understand your misery
  and evil plight! I almost feel as if that were my own fault, which is, in
  fact, only the ordering of fate. Just lately, when I have been endeavoring to
  prepare the soil for our plans, the curse of delay has stared me in the face
  with heart-breaking clearness. Of all the thousands I then had at my
  disposal, so few remain with me, that I doubt, as I said, whether it is safe
  to reckon on such a handful. I await your counsel."</p>

  <p>Nerva, who had been Trajan's constant companion during the last few weeks,
  had nothing to add to this speech, and Cinna's report was but a meagre
  one.</p>

  <p>"So long as we stick at the preparatory stage," he said, discontentedly,
  "I am nobody. I have seen and observed many things. With all the precautions
  I could take, I have found out old connections and, as I will tell you
  presently, I have found a few persons of distinction, that are won over to
  our cause, and who may be of the greatest service to us. But with all this I
  fail to see how you propose to go on. Either one thing or the other All now
  depends on a hazard; it is a game in which everything hangs on a throw of the
  die."</p>

  <p>"The die is cast," said Caius Aurelius.</p>

  <p>Every face was turned in astonishment to gaze at the excited young man,
  who went on as follows in great agitation:</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear friends and colleagues, if I am not greatly deceived, our
  cause is as good as won. How should I, an unknown nobody, have achieved so
  great a success? I can quite understand your being dumb with
  astonishment.&mdash;But the success is not mine, but yours&mdash;yours,
  generous Cinna; yours, noble Nerva, and, above all, yours, Ulpius Trajanus.
  Listen and perpend: After we parted on the coast of Narbonensis, I was
  crushed by the consciousness of being the least capable of all of doing
  anything to promote your prospects. All the circumstances were new to me; I
  had no connection with any great man; I had no glorious past in my own life.
  So for some weeks, accompanied by one of my galley-slaves, I wandered
  aimlessly about the province doing no good whatever. Then accident inspired
  me with a brilliant idea. I was at no great distance from the Rhodanus; I was
  tired with a long ride, and we had dismounted in the middle of a wood, tied
  the horses by their bridles to the trunk of a holm-oak, and had lain down
  ourselves a little way off, where a clear spot offered us a comfortable
  couch. Presently we heard voices&mdash;the Propraetor of Lugdunum,<a href=
  "#120">120</a> as I subsequently discovered, who had a house in the
  neighborhood, and his eldest son. The two men, who had no servants with them,
  had been hunting, and were now resting awhile. We kept quiet, for silence and
  patience are the first virtues of a refugee. Thus I involuntarily overheard a
  conversation, which in a few minutes was of the greatest importance to our
  purpose and plans. I learnt, in short, that the Propraetor highly disapproves
  of the latest edicts from the Palatium, and is anything rather than blind to
  the crimes of the man, whose representative he is. I discovered that he
  esteems many of the proscribed, and you especially, my respected colleagues,
  as brave and upright men, and that he regards Trajan's hostility, especially
  to the present government, as a highly important feature&mdash;as a sign,
  that Caesar is treading a most dangerous road. The son, who is a military
  tribune, agreed with the father in every particular, especially with regard
  to Ulpius Trajanus.<a href="#121">121</a> He spoke of his distinguished
  services in the campaigns against the Northmen; he particularly remarked that
  at that time&mdash;at the head of your legions^ when you had the power
  entirely in your own hands&mdash; you never laid any ambitious plans, and he
  wondered how it could have come to pass, that so moderate a man, after
  achieving such splendid deeds, should be now placed in the position of a
  Catiline. All this was said in broken phrases and a low conversational tone,
  and then they went on to speak of the games and races in the circus of
  Lugdunum. However, it was enough for me. The whole tone and style of their
  speech had convinced me, that I was listening to people of position and
  influence; I therefore determined to keep my men in sight, and when they rose
  and set out I followed them, leaving the horses in the copse. Before long I
  observed a villa, and meeting some slaves returning from labor in the fields,
  I learnt, in answer to my questions, that the noble personage who walked on
  so unpretentiously was the Imperial Propraetor, and had been stopping for a
  few days in his country-house, as he was particularly devoted to sport.
  Indeed, as I approached the house, I saw a number of soldiers and a guard of
  honor,<a href="#122">122</a> which left no doubt as to the rank of the owner.
  Then I felt as if the gods themselves had inspired me.&mdash;My resolution
  was taken at once. I wrote a few lines on my wax-tablet, gave it to my rower,
  and desired him, in case I should not return from the Propraetor's villa, to
  carry them to Herodianus, that he might give you all due warning. Still, I
  had every hope that the immortals would crown my rashness with success. My
  slave left me; I went forward, and had myself announced to the Propraetor
  with the notice that I had a most important communication to make to him. Ten
  minutes later I was standing face to face with the governor of the
  province.&mdash;My lord, said I, as calmly and steadily as if I had arrived
  to announce some imperial fiat&mdash;I come in the name of Cinna, of Nerva,
  and of Trajan, to inform you, that they have determined to accuse Domitian
  before the Senate,<a href="#123">123</a> charging him with high-treason, and
  to depose him, and to this end to lead the legions of this province against
  Rome..."</p>

  <p>"What madness!" cried Cinna, horrified.</p>

  <p>"Yes, noble Cinna," said Aurelius, frankly; "now, when I calmly think it
  over, I am astonished at my own audacity. And yet&mdash;what was I risking
  after all? My life! And my freedman would have had ample time to warn
  you.&mdash;This occurred the day before yesterday."</p>

  <p>Cinna changed color from red to white, and from white to red again.</p>

  <p>"Go on, go on!" urged the others; and Aurelius proceeded:</p>

  <p>"The Propraetor was thunderstruck. For a moment I fancied he feared for
  his own safety; that he thought that his legions had already been secretly
  instigated to rebellion, and that at a given signal the revolt would break
  out. He seemed to breathe more freely, when I told him that the friends of
  freedom had addressed themselves to him, hoping to precipitate some prompt
  decision; counting on his knowledge of affairs, his rectitude, and his
  time-tested patriotism to guide them to an issue from the situation. I
  painted in glowing colors the fermenting discontent, the smothered
  disaffection and hatred of the populace, the tyranny of the capricious and
  detested despot^ his crimes and foul deeds that cry to Heaven, and the
  inevitable pressure from within towards some complete change. Then I reminded
  him once more of your names, you who are here to defend the cause of our
  country: Nerva, Cinna, Trajan.&mdash;What else I may have said I forget, but
  the gods willed, that I should touch some chord which roused a threatening
  echo in the old warrior's breast. It may be, that some personal motives
  weighed with him&mdash;be that as it may, the Propraetor is on our side, and
  as soon as you please you can go to take counsel and lay schemes with
  him."</p>

  <p>"If the whole thing is not a trap on his part?" said Afranius.</p>

  <p>"No, no," cried Trajan. "I remember now. Clodianus told me last summer,
  that after the death of his first wife the Propraetor had wished to marry
  Julia Did he not know how Julia had died?"</p>

  <p>"He knew it only by vague report. I told him the facts as they were
  commonly current in Rome; and he did, certainly, seem very much
  shocked..."</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of Herodianus at the door interrupted Caius Aurelius
  in his speech. Behind the. freedman they could see the ragged figure of a
  beggar.</p>

  <p>"A messenger from Rome," said Herodianus mysteriously. "He has brought
  important news, if he speaks the truth."</p>

  <p>The beggar came forward, and asked if Cornelius Cinna were present, and
  when Cinna acknowledged his identity, the man handed him a much-crumpled
  letter. Cinna broke the tie and seal with eager haste, and the eyes of the
  party were fixed in anxious expectation on his face, which first turned
  deadly pale, and then flushed with rising color.</p>

  <p>"A new ally!" he said, as his hand fell on to the table. "And a powerful
  one too! This note is from the adjutant, Clodianus... Like the wolf in the
  fable.&mdash;You had but just spoken of him, Trajan."</p>

  <p>"What? Clodianus! impossible!" cried Trajan.</p>

  <p>"Not so impossible," said Caius Aurelius. "Only a short time before our
  flight I met him at the house of Norbanus. The things he said&mdash;the
  questions he asked&mdash;I remember it all now."</p>

  <p>"By Hercules! but let us hear," said Afranius.</p>

  <p>When Herodianus and the messenger had withdrawn, Cornelius Cinna read the
  letter aloud. It contained, in the first place, the information that it was
  Clodianus, who had given the mysterious warning of the projected arrests, and
  to confirm this, the words were quoted of the note that Cinna had
  received&mdash;a proof which all the hearers were satisfied to regard as
  conclusive. Clodianus then sketched, with great judgment, a project for their
  joint action. He told them how for some time, he had been working on the
  minds of the Praetorian Guard, and assured them that the only difficulty here
  would arise from the character of Norbanus, who clung to Caesar with
  considerable obstinacy, who was wholly and solely a soldier, and never
  troubled himself at all about questions of State. Still, he was not
  altogether without hope of gaining over this important officer to the side of
  freedom for Rome; if it came to the worst, ways and means might be found to
  keep him out of the way, without hurting his feelings. Then he added some
  valuable hints with regard to military operations, and the opening of rapid
  and reliable means of communication between Clodianus and the conspirators.
  Finally he wrote as follows:</p>

  <p>"If, as I imagine, Caius Aurelius, the Batavian, is with you, tell him
  that his betrothed came to my house a few days after the ides of November.
  She is well. She came to entreat my intercession in favor of her brother
  Quintus who, as you may chance to have heard, was arrested soon after your
  escape, and cast into the Tullianum on a charge of having joined the
  Nazarenes. I promised to do my best, in the certainty, however, that so long
  as Domitian wields the sceptre there is no hope of justice even, and much
  less of mercy."</p>

  <p>This sentence took a surprising effect on Caius Aurelius.</p>

  <p>"My friends," he exclaimed, "you see, the gods themselves have opened a
  way for us! Why do we hesitate? What better guarantees can we expect for the
  success of our plans? Even if the Propraetor has begun to waver, this letter
  from Clodianus will open his eyes&mdash;he must see that it is vain to
  struggle against Fate. I would propose that you should at once enter into
  negotiations with the Propraetor, and start as soon as possible for Lugdunum.
  There, we will proclaim to the legions that Caesar is deposed, and that the
  noble old republic of Cincinnatus and Regulus is reestablished!"<a href=
  "#124">124</a></p>

  <p>"To Lugdunum without delay!" they exclaimed unanimously.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p>April, the sweetest month in the south, had decked the land in all its
  wealth of beauty. The City of the Seven Hills, with its endless gardens and
  plantations, wore a really enchanting aspect. It seemed to have put on its
  freshest and gayest attire in honor of the secular games, which had already
  begun on the previous day with magnificent races in the Circus Maximus.
  To-day, the sixth after the calends,<a href="#125">125</a> two hours after
  sunrise, gladiators and ships were to fight in the Flavian Amphitheatre, and
  men were to fight with beasts.</p>

  <p>It was still nearly an hour to the lime, but in the Forum and all the
  neighboring streets the slanting light of morning fell on a crowd so dense as
  to defy all description. Long files of litters, gorgeous in purple and goldy
  pushed their slow way through the surging masses of men struggling along the
  Via Sacra towards the entrance to the amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>Three hundred lions<a href="#126">126</a> and as many panthers, fifty
  Cantabrian bears, forty elephants and other beasts, six hundred gladiators
  and boxers&mdash;among them some women and dwarfs&mdash;a dozen of highwaymen
  from the Appian Way, and about ninety Christians, were to shed their blood,
  some in single combat, others in larger or smaller divisions, and all in the
  course of the next three days, for the evening of the fourth saw the end of
  the great festival.<a href="#127">127</a> Indeed, the herald who invited the
  populace in the Emperor's name, spoke the truth in more senses than one, as
  he shouted the usual proclamation: "Come hither to see what none of you has
  ever yet seen, or ever will see again!"<a href="#128">128</a></p>

  <p>To-day, the second day, the interest and excitement seemed even greater
  than yesterday. The number of strangers, gathered together from all parts of
  the Empire^ was certainly swelled and, although the amphitheatre could
  accommodate above eighty thousand spectators, the crowd was so enormous, that
  many visitors were doubtful of succeeding in fighting their way to
  places.</p>

  <p>In the stream of litters, which were moving towards the Arena, not from
  the Forum only but from the Cyprian Way, was one of conspicuous elegance and
  splendor. The curtains were drawn open, and two handsome but over-dressed and
  painted girls sat chattering among the billowy cushions. These were Lycoris
  and one of her friends, Leaina, a native of Asia Minor, who had spent the
  winter in Athens as companion to an Egyptian lady of rank, and had arrived
  only yesterday evening in Rome, the sea-passage being only just considered as
  open for the season. Lycoris had a sort of sisterly kindness for
  Leaina&mdash;all the more because she was well aware, that the oriental could
  not compare with her in beauty; and Leaina, who had originally filled a very
  humble position as a dancer in a low tavern at Capua, had been introduced
  into society by Lycoris, and felt for her a feeble reflection of the feeling,
  which in a deeper nature might have risen to gratitude. As they sat together
  in the litter, splendidly dressed, their eyebrows darkened with
  stibium,<a href="#129">129</a> and the veins in their temples outlined with
  blue color, they seemed to be of one heart and one mind.</p>

  <p>"It is delightful," cooed Lycoris, "to have you at least&mdash;to enjoy
  the fights in the amphitheatre with me. That stupid ship to be so
  late&mdash;particularly when I think of your love for races. They were
  splendid, my dear, positively splendid! First there was the great procession
  from the Capitol to the Circus Maximus;<a href="#130">130</a> all the finest
  young men in Rome on milk-white horses&mdash;a lovely sight! Then the two-
  wheeled and four-wheeled chariots, the dancers, flute-players and cithara-
  players, the priests in full dress, and last of all the judges, with crowns
  of golden oak-leaves and robes of ceremony, like the hero of a triumph. That
  was enough to show what the greatness of Rome means I As a rule, all that
  people say of the glory of the Roman name and such speech-making, is to me
  simply laughable; but when I see a sight like that, it gives me a shiver down
  my back, and I feel a sense of&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;the
  sublime&mdash;of&mdash;I do not know whether you understand the feeling?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said Leaina, vaguely. "But you mentioned the priests; was
  Titus Claudius present, the high-priest of Jupiter? You wrote to me, a few
  weeks since, that his son Quintus had been charged before the Senate with
  having joined the Nazarenes, and was condemned to the beasts. I should think
  his father would hardly care to take part in a festival..."</p>

  <p>"My dear child!" interrupted the Massilian. "I see that Athens is indeed
  out of the world. You do not know what has been the talk of Rome for some
  days; ever since the ides of March Titus Claudius has been lying at death's
  door. He has a violent fever, is quite delirious and, indeed, out of his
  mind. His hair, they say, has grown white in these few months like that of a
  very old man. Rome does not generally find time to think of the misfortunes
  of individuals, but the sympathy in this case has been universal. At first
  every one blamed Quintus Claudius, but now he is only pitied, and hundreds of
  the most influential men in Rome are exerting themselves to save him. Even I,
  who am indolence itself, have appeared as a suppliant at the consulate.
  Seriously, Leaina, I feel for him deeply; it is a pity, he is so young and so
  handsome. Wherever I had a chance I tried&mdash;with the chamberlain, whom I
  can generally twist round my little finger&mdash;at last even with the
  Empress&mdash;I forget, whether I told you when I wrote, that even the
  Empress had done me the honor to smile upon me All in vain, Caesar is
  inexorable. Even when the father offered in sheer despair to be a victim to
  the law in his son's stead, and to kill himself in expiation, Domitian would
  not hear of mercy. Now the only hope is, that even in the Arena the people
  will demand his release."</p>

  <p>"And Cornelia, his betrothed? She too was arrested?"</p>

  <p>"She is to share his fate. Indeed she is guilty of a double crime: she is
  a Nazarene, and she tried to murder Caesar. To ask pardon for her would be
  tantamount to high-treason."</p>

  <p>"It is a strange story altogether," said Leaina, with a little sigh. "And
  after all, tell me, what is the particular crime of being a Nazarene? What is
  it that they do?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, my dear, you ask me more than I can answer. It would appear, that
  they carry on all sorts of idolatrous worship, and concoct schemes of
  rebellion. Norbanus told me that they want to turn the world upside down, and
  make the masters slaves, and the slaves masters. I told him, that did not
  sound to me at all a likely story; for, if it were so, only slaves would have
  anything to do with them. And now, besides Quintus, the consul Flavius
  Clemens,<a href="#131">131</a> a relative of Caesar, has been caught and
  converted; so there must be something more in it than that."</p>

  <p>"Of course!" said Leaina.</p>

  <p>"Very likely the whole business is somehow connected with the
  disturbances, that have been reported lately from the Rhaetian frontier. It
  is said that the conspirators&mdash;you know, Cornelius Cinna, Ulpius
  Trajanus and the rest&mdash;have formed an alliance with some Germanic
  princes, and are marching on Rome!"</p>

  <p>"But that would be frightful! Just now too, when the best season of the
  year is coming on!"</p>

  <p>"Oh! do not be alarmed. Clodianus discovered it all in good time. And to
  make sure, he is bringing troops out of the provinces&mdash;out of Gallia
  Lugdunensis I rather fancy&mdash;down into the peninsula. If it comes to the
  worst, they will give the rebels a lesson. But, as you see, the feast is the
  only thing in men's minds. If they had the remotest idea even..."</p>

  <p>"Well, by Cypris! I do not know what I should do. Only think of it, a
  conflagration like that under Nero perhaps! The whole season would be
  ruined."</p>

  <p>"You silly child!" laughed Lycoris. "But what is the matter again,
  Philemon? Every minute we come to a stand-still."</p>

  <p>"Mistress," said the bearer, "the city- watch have got a man in charge,
  and the people are crowding round them and have stopped the way."</p>

  <p>Lycoris leaned as far as she could out of the litter. To the left, not far
  from the entrance to the baths of Titus, two stalwart officials had rushed at
  a pale young man, who defended himself desperately at first, but was
  overpowered after a short struggle.</p>

  <p>"I surely know that face," said Lycoris. "And yet I cannot be sure
  Philemon, find out what that man has done to be arrested."</p>

  <p>The bearer sent one of the slaves, who went in front of the litter, across
  to the spot where the two men-at-arms were now binding their prisoner's hands
  behind his back. In a few minutes the messenger returned.</p>

  <p>"It is Eurymachus, the slave of Stephanus, who was hunted for through all
  Latium only last autumn."</p>

  <p>"To be sure, it is he!" cried Lycoris. "Do you remember, Leaina? It was
  just before you left Rome. Of course; now I recognize his pale, determined
  face. Only he has cut off his beard, which made him look even paler then. My
  dear, do you know I shudder when I think of that scene! Since Quintus has
  been condemned to the beasts, I have grown quite nervous. That Eurymachus was
  his evil genius. Only see how desperately he looks about him&mdash;and then
  he was perfectly calm, even when he was led to the foot of the cross."</p>

  <p>"It would seem, that the last few months had taken down his spirit a
  little."</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;he must have some other reason, that you may depend upon.
  Besides&mdash;as he certainly was involved in this business of
  Quintus&mdash;oh! perhaps there may be some new aspect of the question! He
  ought to be heard.&mdash;Philemon, ask those men to come this way, to
  me."</p>

  <p>The two men, extremely astonished, came up to the splendid litter,
  dragging their prisoner between them.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said Lycoris, in condescending tones. "You have caught a prize
  this time. I know the fellow, and I know that Stephanus has set a great
  reward on his head. Now, if you wish to find special favor in his master's
  eyes, just do as I advise you. Take my tablets, on which I will write two
  lines, and carry them instantly, with your prisoner, to Stephanus. You will
  still find him at home&mdash;for he is very busy, and will not come to the
  Arena before noon. Will you do as I desire you?"</p>

  <p>"Mistress," said one of the men, "it is all the same, whether we take the
  prisoner to the city-prefect or to his owner's house. If you wish it..."</p>

  <p>Lycoris signed to the slave, who had called the men to speak to her, and
  the servant took out of his robe two gold pieces, which he gave to them,
  while Lycoris wrote on her tablets:</p>

  <p>"Lycoris to the illustrious Stephanus, greeting:</p>

  <p>"With these lines you will receive your slave, Eurymachus, whom you have
  so long sought in vain. Keep him in safety, but do him no hurt, till you have
  taken counsel with me. Why, I will tell you when we meet. I would go to you
  at once if it were not so late, but I am afraid of missing the beginning of
  the games. I am writing in my litter&mdash;in the Cyprian Way, where your
  slave was taken. Expect me to dinner. Farewell!"</p>

  <p>She gave the tablets to the man, and bid him take the greatest care of
  them. Once more she glanced at the pale and sadly-handsome face of the
  prisoner, and a strange feeling stole into her heart, a stirring of pity and
  of confusion. Most assuredly&mdash;so she thought&mdash;if, that evening, she
  had seen the victim's face so close, she would have spoken a good word for
  him! Those grave, drooping lids veiled a wonderful glow in the eyes! and the
  mouth, with its expression of silent suffering and self-suppression, was a
  curious contradiction to that fiery glance! It was altogether a fascinating
  riddle for the Massilian's mobile fancy. It was only a pity, that the problem
  should offer itself under so unattractive a guise! A young officer, a Roman
  knight, a senator's son, with such a mysterious countenance, would have
  captivated her.&mdash;It was disappointing, by Cypris! positively vexatious!
  There was something bewitching in the man, as he raised his eyes to her
  face&mdash;she could well understand, that it must have had a great effect on
  a nature so impressionable as Quintus'.</p>

  <p>The more she thought about it the more determined she became; she must
  find out how it all had come about. The man, Eurymachus, to be sure, looked
  by no means incapable of refusing point-blank to give her any information.
  But did not his fate depend upon her? His death was inevitable, and she alone
  could save him; so if she said: "Speak, tell me all, or I leave you to your
  fate, which will be certain death."&mdash;Absurd! of course he would speak.
  And it must be a wonderful secret indeed, that could induce a youth like
  Quintus...</p>

  <p>And then it suddenly struck her, that Eurymachus was not exposed to the
  vengeance of the steward only. As a Christian he was condemned by
  law&mdash;and she could not interfere with the course of the law. The chief
  point still remained open: she would examine him closely, if indeed Stephanus
  agreed to her request. And he must, positively must. Only the other day she
  had had him in leading-strings, but the child had suddenly outgrown her
  management. Since she had become so intimate with
  Parthenius&mdash;Parthenius! And might not this prime favorite of Caesar's be
  of some service? If Parthenius spoke the word, Eurymachus would be set at
  liberty, in spite of any sentence passed upon him.</p>

  <p>Lycoris passed her hand across her forehead; her head was burning. What
  strange ideas were these, that had taken possession of her? What a
  concatenation of foolish fancies and wild, confused ideas! She hardly
  perceived, that meanwhile the litter had reached the entrance to the Flavian
  Amphitheatre. Leaina had to rouse her from her dreamy mood.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with you, golden-haired maid?" she said in a low
  voice. "You seem depressed, and just now you were all in the mood for
  enjoyment! Tell me&mdash;the sight of that refractory fugitive has reminded
  you of the performance, which ended so unfortunately?&mdash;Oh! but your
  vanity as a hostess makes you too sensitive. Smile again, enchantress!
  Consider, half Rome is looking at us."</p>

  <p>"You are very right, child," replied Lycoris. "Our part is to look
  beautiful, and we may leave grave thoughts to the vestal virgins."</p>

  <p>They got out of the litter, while one of the slaves obtained at an office
  on the right hand of the door-way, the <i>tesserae</i>, ivory tickets of
  admission,<a href="#132">132</a> on which the numbers of the seats were
  marked in Latin and in Greek. The two girls took their tickets and slowly
  made their way through the crush, to the places pointed out to them by an
  attendant in a gaily-colored holiday tunic.<a href="#133">133</a> They gave
  him a small gratuity in silver, dropped on to the cushions, which a slave had
  carried in for them,<a href="#134">134</a> and drew a deep breath, quite
  tired out with standing, climbing and struggling.</p>

  <p>The amphitheatre was a magnificent spectacle. The fighting was not to
  begin for half an hour yet, but the rows of seats, particularly the higher
  and cheaper ones, were already crammed. Every part was as gay as a
  flower-garden with gorgeous dresses,<a href="#135">135</a> eager eyes, and
  faces flushed with expectation. Even the poorest had donned a newly-cleaned
  and bleached toga. The gentler sex, decorated with gold pins and diadems, was
  particularly strongly represented, from the matron of senatorial rank to the
  artisan's wife, and the gay Syrian of more than doubtful origin.</p>

  <p>Now the gaudily-gilt <i>podium</i>, kept for the senators,<a href=
  "#136">136</a> began to fill. They took their seats deliberately, with an air
  of affected dignity; the Fathers of the State, as they were called, who were
  now little more than tools in the hand of a despot. And there was many a gap
  in their ranks, for Caesar's suspected and proscribed foes still languished
  in prison, vainly awaiting a judicial trials much less a verdict of
  acquittal.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, the vestal maidens came in, in long white robes; for
  them too law and custom reserved a place of honor. Ah! and the boldness of
  Quintus Claudius in an audacious moment, in addressing one of these
  priestesses as his lady-love, was not so outrageous as his father had
  represented it, for those sacred robes were a cloak for more than one broken
  vow,<a href="#137">137</a> and the irony of Lycoris' remark was not
  altogether undeserved.</p>

  <p>More and more crowds of spectators kept pouring up the stairs and
  corridors; a hum of voices, like the surges of the Tyrrhenian sea, rose from
  every part of the vast oval. At last the place was filled to the very last
  comer. Only the purple and gold pulvinar,<a href="#138">138</a> prepared for
  the Emperor, and the seats of honor immediately near to it now remained
  unoccupied. All eyes were fixed on the shining gates, through which the
  sovereign and his suite were to enter. The velarium too&mdash;the enormous
  canvas awning,<a href="#139">139</a> which was stretched across the whole
  oval of the amphitheatre and supported by fifty masts&mdash;bellied and
  flapped, as though it shared the impatience of the audience. Any one, seeing
  it for the first time, would have been tempted to think that the sky was
  about to fall in on the earth.</p>

  <p>"A quarter of an hour yet," said a fruit-seller, who passed in front of
  Lycoris and Leaina. "Fresh oranges from Tauromenium!<a href="#140">140</a>
  Take some, mistress."</p>

  <p>"Bye-and-by, my little friend! Look, Leaina, there, in the fourth
  row&mdash;do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"I am too short-sighted."</p>

  <p>"It is Martial, our famous wit; and there, in the same row, the tenth or
  twelfth seat from you<a href="#141">141</a>&mdash;he is stooping forward
  now..."</p>

  <p>"The priest of Isis!" said Leaina. "Oh! his amulet was invaluable. Close
  to Rhegium<a href="#142">142</a> we had such a storm..."</p>

  <p>"He is looking uncommonly grave over it, is Barbillus."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he is thinking, that the same fate may overtake him and his Isis-
  creed, as has fallen on the Nazarenes."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," laughed Lycoris. "He is in high favor with the
  chamberlain."</p>

  <p>"Do you see any more acquaintances near us?"</p>

  <p>"Acquaintances, oh yes! But no one I care about. There sits that most
  ridiculous creature&mdash;do you know her, the silly Gaditanian,
  Melinno?&mdash;I think I wrote to you about her. A Hispanian knight&mdash;she
  is his freedman's wife&mdash;brought her here a few weeks since, and now the
  simpleton tries to ape me and my way of living, thinking to put me out of
  fashion. Why, she even attempted to get up a recitation; Statius was to do
  her the honor.&mdash;Oh! she is exquisitely funny with her affectation of
  culture; and all the time she cannot even read."</p>

  <p>Leaina colored, for she was conscious of being equally ignorant, and to
  change the subject she hastily enquired as to the order of the games and
  fights. Lycoris could not give her much information on the subject. She only
  knew, that the master of the festival had paid particular attention to the
  variety and due alternation of the different entertainments, so that, on each
  of the three days, every kind of fight should be represented, and in typical
  completeness.</p>

  <p>"You may be sure of good entertainment, ladies," said a well-dressed young
  man with an ingratiating smile; he was sitting a row above them, and had
  heard their last words. "Women even are to fight with knives&mdash;indeed the
  condemned Nazarenes are more than half of them women."</p>

  <p>"And are they supposed to be able to defend themselves?" asked Lycoris.
  "Against lions and tigers?"</p>

  <p>"As well as they may," said the lad, shrugging his shoulders. "Some of the
  men are to have swords. I do not know whether the women are to be so
  armed."</p>

  <p>"What can it matter?" said Leaina. "They are bound to die as
  criminals."</p>

  <p>"Very true; and a few inches of steel cannot make much difference. Even
  Quintus Claudius, who is one of the strongest and best fighters in Rome, will
  find out the difference between a fight with a lion, and a wrestling-match in
  the ring at the baths."</p>

  <p>"I fancy the people will demand a pardon for him," said Lycoris.</p>

  <p>"Then Caesar will refuse it. If ever all means and ways were tried to save
  a man, they have been in his case. All he would concede was, that the
  criminal should be let off after conquering three beasts, and what that means
  no Roman needs be told."</p>

  <p>"True indeed!" sighed Lycoris. "A Gaetulian lion, and a little, short
  knife! It is as if I were to try to pull these walls down with my own
  hands."</p>

  <p>"A very good simile.&mdash;How often have we seen it from this very spot
  The cleverest stroke&mdash;the knife to the hilt in the brute's
  breast&mdash;never saves the man from being torn to pieces at last. And even
  if what seems impossible should happen once, how can we hope that the
  impossible should happen twice?"</p>

  <p>A rattling roll of drums interrupted this dialogue. The roar of voices in
  the amphitheatre was suddenly hushed. The gates behind the gorgeous couch of
  state slowly opened, and Domitian, the awe-inspiring Emperor, who&mdash;as
  his flatterers expressed it&mdash;moved the world by a wink of his
  eyelash,<a href="#143">143</a> came forward in magnificent array, and took
  his seat on the decorated throne.</p>

  <p><i>"Ave Caesar,"</i><a href="#144">144</a> shouted the mob to hail the
  tyrant, and he graciously bowed, and with theatrical exaggeration raised his
  hand to greet his faithful Romans.</p>

  <p>Domitia took her place on the Emperor's right hand; the seat to the left
  remained vacant.<a href="#145">145</a> It had been intended for Titus
  Claudius Mucianus, the miserable man, who&mdash;but a few hundred paces
  distant from the scene of these hideous combats&mdash;was lying on a bed of
  anguish in a dark struggle with madness and death.</p>

  <p>Among the suite, that followed Domitian, was Parthenius, as ever the
  perfect courtier and man of the world, smiling graciously, a very Sun of
  condescension and affability. Clodianus, too, upright and soldierly, only a
  little paler than usual; but perhaps his paleness was only a reflection from
  the velarium which, now that Caesar had taken his place, hung in a long curve
  over the arena, as though stricken with reverence.</p>

  <p>The herald's drum rattled once more. Horns and trumpets struck up, shrill,
  loud and exciting, as if the legions of the Republic were marching to meet
  Hannibal. Then, down in the arena, the doors were opened for the gladiators.
  Slowly and solemnly the combatants came out from their cells on to the scene
  of action; tall and powerful forms, mostly fair-haired, for the greater
  number were northerners by birth. They marched round the arena with defiant
  looks, and pausing in front of the imperial couch, they bowed and shouted in
  loud chorus: <i>"Ave, Caesar, morituri te salutant!"</i><a href=
  "#146">146</a></p>

  <p>When they had all passed by, the manager of the ceremonies came forward,
  bowed to the sovereign, and said in a distinct voice:</p>

  <p>"Marcus the Suevian will fight with Tumelicus the Cheruscan." Wild, noisy
  music began to play, and the rest of the gladiators retired into the lairs,
  the master of the fights described with a staff the circle within which the
  struggle was to take place. The two gladiators were armed by slaves; they had
  helmets given them, and round shields, and short broadswords. Then again a
  drum gave the signal to begin.</p>

  <p>There was breathless silence. Often as the Roman populace had seen the
  bloody games of the arena, they never failed of their absorbing interest. The
  matrons and maidens, with their golden ornaments, forgot even the vicinity of
  their flattering gallants,<a href="#147">147</a> who till this moment had
  done their utmost to fulfil to the letter Ovid's advice as to availing
  themselves of favorable opportunities.</p>

  <p>Stealthily, like panthers waiting to spring, the combatants went towards
  each other; each was watching for an unprotected spot in his antagonist,
  while trying to expose himself as little as possible. They probably had known
  each other for some time; they had most likely lived for some months in the
  same barrack and been in daily intercourse; they perhaps had made
  friends&mdash;if the occupation of a gladiator could leave room for the
  feeling of friendship&mdash;and now they had but one idea: To kill, in order
  not to be killed.</p>

  <p>There was a loud ring of metal; Marcus had dealt the Cheruscan a fearful
  blow on the helmet. Tumelicus nearly lost his balance; he withdrew a step or
  two, anxiously screening himself with his shield. Thus he recovered from the
  shock of the onslaught. He rushed forward, and retorted with a still more
  tremendous stroke. His attack was better than that of his opponent. The
  Suevian turned pale; the blow had shattered his sword and so severely wounded
  his right- hand, that it seemed impossible that he should defend himself any
  longer; he flung away his shield without more ado. A roar of mocking laughter
  from eighty thousand throats rent the air. He stretched out his arm and held
  up his thumb, in token that he acknowledged himself beaten and implored for
  mercy.</p>

  <p>Fresh shouts of laughter! What, a man, whose clumsiness had so shamefully
  shortened their entertainment, could hope for mercy! How little he knew the
  Roman mob.</p>

  <p>All the spectators' thumbs were turned down,<a href="#148">148</a> as if
  at a preconcerted signal; there was not a single exception, and Leaina even
  put out both her fat little hands glittering with rings, to give emphasis to
  her demonstration.</p>

  <p>Thumbs downwards, that meant death.</p>

  <p>The hapless gladiator glanced despairingly upwards, as though to call on
  Heaven and the future to avenge his miserable fate. He panted for breath, and
  terrible anguish was depicted in his face. His thoughts flashed back perhaps,
  in that instant, far away to his German home, where a yellow-haired maiden
  sat sadly by the hearth, and his blind old mother wept for his return; away
  to the hills of the Black Forest, where in the happy days of his freedom, he
  had hunted the chamois and the wild goat, or gathered the alpine rose for a
  wreath for that golden head. He clenched his fist and his lips quivered. Then
  suddenly his expression settled into dull resignation; he bent his ^ head and
  silently awaited his death-blow. He was too well schooled as a gladiator, not
  to know that, by all the rules of the art, he must yield and die.</p>

  <p>Tumelicus came up to do the office of executioner; he drove his knife in
  just below the shoulder blade, into his antagonist's heart. The Suevian fell
  on his knees, gazing fixedly at the ground. The Cheruscan slowly drew out his
  weapon, and a gush of blood sprinkled the victor with its red flood.</p>

  <p>The air shook with the storm of applause; the Emperor himself approved.
  But it was especially the fairer portion of the spectators, who seemed beside
  themselves with delight. Leaina clapped so indefatigably, that it seemed
  doubtful whether she did it out of sheer pleasure, or rather to display her
  round, plump arms. Lycoris too, naturally swam with the stream, though less
  eagerly than her companion. She seemed somewhat languid and indifferent to-
  day.</p>

  <p>When the storm of plaudits had somewhat subsided, a handsome youth,
  dressed as Mercury, appeared on the scene. He had silver sandals with wings;
  he carried an iron staff, red-hot at one end. It was his duty to touch the
  body of the fallen gladiator with the hot iron, to make sure that life was
  extinct. The Suevian, however, seemed still to breathe, though he had lost
  consciousness.</p>

  <p>Mercury signed to a servant, who stood in the doorway with a shining axe
  in his hand, ready to give the <i>'coup de grace'</i> to the victim. One
  mighty stroke&mdash;as a butcher might fell an ox&mdash;and all was over.
  Immediately a second ruffian came forward with a harpoon in his hand. He
  struck it into the bleeding corpse, with brutal force, and the remains of the
  hapless Marcus were dragged away to the Porta Libitinensis&mdash;the gate of
  the dead.</p>

  <p>The whole scene was repeated twice more, and in neither case did the
  people respite the conquered victim. They seemed possessed with a special
  blood- thirstiness.</p>

  <p>It was not till the fourth scene, a tilting-match, when a rider, who was a
  favorite with the women, happened to be unhorsed, that their thumbs were
  turned up, so that the admired and splendid champion, who had so often proved
  victorious and the hero of many a gallant adventure, should be respited to
  achieve future deeds of valor. His antagonist's lance had pierced his thigh;
  cries of <i>"Habet,"</i><a href="#149">149</a> resounded from the upper
  galleries, and when the women had pronounced in his favor, three slaves came
  forward and carried him away with the utmost care.</p>

  <p>These single combats on foot and horseback were only introductory. The
  fights with wild beasts were now to begin. When the servants had strewn the
  arena with sand<a href="#150">150</a> and, so far as possible, hidden the
  traces of blood, the master of the ceremonies appeared once more, and
  proclaimed: "The criminal, Calenus, condemned as a Nazarene, will fight with
  a mountain lion from Gaetulia."</p>

  <p>"Calenus, a wretch&mdash;one of the brood of traitors,<a href=
  "#151">151</a> and a contemner of the gods!" said the stranger behind
  Lycoris.</p>

  <p>The door opened, and two slaves led forward the tall, solemn figure of the
  sightless man, with his long snow-white hair. He held in his hands a wooden
  cross, the symbol of his faith, the only weapon that the tyrant's ferocity
  had vouchsafed him.</p>

  <p>"He was a soldier," their unknown informant whispered, "and often punished
  for his insubordination. Let us see how he will behave himself now!"</p>

  <p>"How can he fight?" said Lycoris, "he is blind. Only see how helplessly he
  stands there; he does not know which way to turn."</p>

  <p>"Blindness cannot save a criminal from punishment."</p>

  <p>"Punishment, by all means; but the master of the ceremonies said a
  fight!"</p>

  <p>"Well, and why not?" said the young man scornfully. "The Nazarenes
  declare, that their cross is a mighty weapon, and that their God shows them a
  path even in darkness."</p>

  <p>Lycoris turned away; her eye fell on Barbillus. The handsome and
  expressive head of the oriental priest had a strange, fixed and lifeless
  look. And, in truth, the scene, which was now going forward in the arena, was
  well calculated to excite and impress such a man as Barbillus. He, absolutely
  bereft of convictions, felt the power of faith come home to his soul as a
  strange phenomenon. Brought up in his early youth by priests, and then
  trained at Athens in philosophy and sophistry, he had always been accustomed
  to regard everything supernatural from the vantage ground of mere
  self-interested trickery. The more devoutly and zealously his credulous
  followers gave themselves up to this jugglery, the more convinced he felt,
  that all faith was the result of a sickly hallucination&mdash;particularly in
  women, a disorder of the system, which must be dissipated like mist by the
  rough breath of reality. And that this ecstatic frenzy should carry grave and
  ripe men so far, that they could cling to it in defiance of the law of the
  land, and sacrifice their lives to a death of excruciating torment&mdash;this
  to the sensitive physique of the Asiatic was astounding, shocking! It was
  incomprehensible; a man&mdash;to all appearance a well-educated man, while
  his lofty brow indicated superior capacity&mdash;and that man believed! That
  man was at the point of death in witness of his belief&mdash;and he did not
  even tremble.</p>

  <p>Barbillus pressed his hand to his heart, which seemed to be rising into
  his throat, and his breath rattled as he drew it.</p>

  <p>The door, which barred the egress of the wild beasts from the dens, now
  opened. A lion came bounding into the arena, paused, looked round him, licked
  his fangs, and gave a mighty roar. Suddenly he started back a step or two.
  Calenus, who till this minute had stood upright, had dropped on to his knees;
  and clasping his cross with both hands, he held it up towards heaven, praying
  audibly:</p>

  <p>"Jesus Christ, my Lord and Saviour! behold me about to die for Thy sake.
  And in dying I declare before all men: Thou alone art the Light and the
  Truth; O God, my God, have mercy upon me, for Thy Son's sake, who died upon
  the cross for the redemption of the world."</p>

  <p>Dull murmurs, jeering laughter, and a few words of pity were heard as the
  blind man ended his prayer. The priest of Isis had turned paler than ever and
  perfectly rigid; he leaned forward; the veins in his forehead swelled, and
  his lips quivered. A thousand dancing flashes mocked his sight. His whole
  spirit was in torment under a fearful and paralyzing vision.</p>

  <p>The cross, which the blind-man raised skywards, seemed to grow till it was
  four, five times as tall as the kneeling man. The galleries of the
  amphitheatre were deserted. The senators and vestal virgins vanished in
  smoke; the Sovereign of the World and his court were lost in thin air; every
  living creature was swallowed up in the yawning depths of a vast gulf. The
  splendid arcades were empty and silent, the marble and stucco facings dropped
  away from the pillars, clinking as they fell, till the rough masonry and
  brickwork of the main structure stood unadorned and bare. Nettles, darnel and
  ferns sprouted from every seam. Crows and daws fluttered in flocks from arch
  to arch, filling the air with melancholy croaking&mdash;but still, down there
  in the arena, the cross stood up on its stone plinth, the triumphant emblem
  of a despised faith, whose adherents were torn to pieces to feast lions and
  tigers by Caesar's commands.</p>

  <p>Barbillus sat gazing at the awful picture, that his brain had raised, his
  eyes almost starting out of his head. He wanted to shriek, but he was
  speechless; only a choked rattle came from his lips, a groan of torture and
  terror. Utterly overpowered and bewildered, he covered his face with his
  robe. A roar of applause roused him from his trance, and he looked up once
  more. The hideous vision was gone. There sat Caesar on his purple throne, and
  the wind still flapped the waving screen. A hoarse growl resounded through
  the arena, the lion crouched for his spring, and in a moment was standing
  victorious over the body of his defenceless prey Calenus was no more than a
  bleeding and lifeless mass.</p>

  <p>Barbillus rose from his seat, tottering and half-stunned; the ground
  seemed to burn under his feet. He hastily made his way out. "When, when is
  this vision to be fulfilled?"<a href="#152">152</a> he asked in his trembling
  soul. Then he rushed home, bolted himself up in his room, and wrote;</p>

  <p>"I, Barbillus, the priest of Isis, saw on the second day of the secular
  games, in the sixteenth year of Domitian, a wonderful vision&mdash;whether
  sent me by the gods (if gods there be), or a trick played me by some
  <i>daemon</i>, I thought I saw with these eyes things which were not there to
  be seen..." So he wrote, and told his story.</p>

  <p>In the Flavian Amphitheatre meanwhile&mdash;the Coliseum as it is now
  called&mdash;the bloody festival goes on&mdash;only interrupted for a while
  by the dinner-hour&mdash;till supper-time puts an end to it for
  to-day.<a href="#153">153</a> Tired and exhausted, but not yet satiated with
  blood, the Roman people withdraw to the triclinium, to discuss the incidents
  of the day over sparkling Falernian or the muddy liquor of Veii. All are
  looking forward to the morrow, for each day of this glorious festival is to
  be more delightful than the last.</p>

  <p>Lycoris and her friend went to Stephanus. Parthenius, Clodianus, and the
  colonel of the body-guard, supped with Caesar. Rome was quiet, Rome was
  happy. So, at least, said Clodianus in the speech in which he proposed health
  to Caesar, the glorious president over these unequalled centennial games, and
  drank it in Opimian wine.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap18"
     id="chap18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p>The sudden reappearance of Eurymachus had been extremely agitating to the
  steward. Satisfaction, alarm, hatred and surprise, struggled in his mind for
  the upper-hand. He at once gave up all idea of going to the Amphitheatre,
  and, with his own hand he locked the slave, heavily fettered, into the
  remotest and securest hiding-place in his house. He was devoured by a
  feverish anxiety to know what Lycoris could have to say in the matter, and,
  having neglected, in his surprise, to question the two men-at-arms, he
  supposed the accidental meeting to have been planned beforehand, and thought
  that it was Lycoris, who had herself recognized the escaped slave and given
  him in charge. The whole day he tormented himself with trying to guess how it
  had all happened, and in his morbid restlessness he did nothing but walk
  about from one room to another. At last, as the supper-hour drew near, he
  began to wonder whether it would not be better to put the man, whose
  existence was a standing threat to him, out of the world at once, without
  waiting for the Massilian's arrival. In pursuance of this idea he opened a
  case of weapons and took out a dagger. He slowly polished the keen blade,
  which had been the costly gift of a Parthian chief, whom he had been able to
  oblige. One blow with this blue, gleaming steel, and the incubus would be
  removed for ever.</p>

  <p>He set his lips firmly; the idea gained ground as he thought it over. As a
  persecuted slave, who must have lived in the fear of being at any moment
  recognized and seized, Eurymachus could hardly, up to the present hour, have
  revealed the secret that incriminated his master, to any one but his fellow
  Nazarenes and accomplices; and they, under the ban of the law and threatened
  with the same punishment as himself, had the most urgent reasons for keeping
  it and themselves dark. But what if Eurymachus, even now, were to find an
  opportunity?&mdash;Perhaps even the men who had taken him?&mdash;But no; such
  sharp practitioners would have taken advantage of it ere this, in the hope of
  extracting a splendid bribe. But Lycoris? some bold hint from the wretch
  might have betrayed the secret to her, and then Stephanus would be as
  completely at the mercy of this woman, as she had, ere this, been at his. For
  she hated him&mdash;on that point he had no doubt whatever. And if she wished
  to see the slave, on what valid pretence could he, Stephanus, refuse.</p>

  <p>He slipped the dagger into its sheath again and hid it in his tunic; then
  he called a slave and desired him to light a hand-lamp. This he took in his
  left-hand, and went to the room where Eurymachus lay, half-stunned as it
  seemed, on the stone floor.</p>

  <p>"At last I have you in my power," muttered the steward, setting the lamp
  down on the ledge. "And this time, by the gods, you do not escape me!"</p>

  <p>Eurymachus did not reply; he looked up with dull indifference.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been hiding yourself this last half-year?" Stephanus went
  on. "Will you speak, or shall I loosen your tongue by the help of this
  dagger?"</p>

  <p>He drew out the weapon and stepped forward. The slave raised his head with
  a melancholy smile.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said, "you have come to finish your work. You are
  afraid of me. After suffering so long from the misery of terror, you want to
  make away with the witness of your crime. But you are mistaken. That dreaded
  secret will not die with me. Cneius Afranius knows it, and sooner or later he
  will make himself heard. But kill me all the same. For me death can hardly
  hold more terrors than life."</p>

  <p>Stephanus had dropped his arms by his side; a flash of implacable hatred
  glared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Wretch! you dared... But you triumph too soon; Afranius is an exile,
  banned as a traitor... "</p>

  <p>"By Caesar," added Eurymachus. "But even Caesars are mortal and human.
  Take my word for it, that exile will see an end. The wrath of God is hanging
  over the head of the tyrant, who gives the servants of God to be devoured by
  beasts. Your accuser will return and demand justice of a tribunal, that you
  cannot bribe as you did the judges to whom Thrax Barbatus appealed for his
  rights."</p>

  <p>"Mean slave!" cried Stephanus furious. "And what is there to prevent me
  from having you racked and tortured, till every nerve in your body writhes
  with anguish like a worm?"</p>

  <p>"Well, satisfy your vengeance. Throw me into the lowest depths of your
  ergastulum, and leave me there to rot before I die. Send me to join your
  father&mdash;aye, your father&mdash;for I know it, and Afranius knows
  it&mdash;it was not your uncle even, but your own father, who was the victim
  of your brutal crime."</p>

  <p>"Silence!" roared Stephanus, "or I will murder you!" and he flew at the
  slave. But something in the man's lofty indifference again stayed the
  blow.</p>

  <p>"Is it loathing and horror of yourself, that hold you back?" asked
  Eurymachus. "Aye, shudder, Stephanus, and quail! Yes&mdash;I saw him, the
  hapless wretch, half-mad on his filthy bed of straw. I shuddered at it too,
  as if hell had shown me its horrors, and I thanked God, even with tears, when
  I knew that in that very hour the suffering soul was free. For three dreadful
  years, immured by his own son, bereft of life and hope, fed like a beggar's
  dog&mdash;and this for the sake of filthy lucre, which you would certainly
  have had in the course of time I Why, the bloodiest patricide is meritorious,
  when compared with your crime!"</p>

  <p>Then suddenly drawing himself up, he went on:</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, and mark well what I say. I was in safety&mdash;free, and
  as a <i>free</i> man could laugh at your penalties and your threats. Then I
  learnt that Quintus Claudius, who once did me a great benefit, was cast into
  prison; I learnt that the Senate had condemned him to die for the faith's
  sake. From that moment I had but one idea: to free him at the risk of my own
  life&mdash;as he once freed me. I hastened hither from Germania, where I had
  found a peaceful though laborious refuge, and across Gaul to the sea. At
  Massilia I took a place on board a galley that was short-handed, and served
  as a rower to reach Ostia&mdash;thus I got to Rome two days before your
  bloody sports began. Here indeed I find news to shake my soul; I heard, that
  the dearest treasure I possessed on earth had died a most pitiable death. But
  even this dreadful news could not divert me from the end I had in view. I
  thought, schemed, considered&mdash;all in vain. It was too late for any
  elaborate plans, and I had no means of effecting a bold stroke. So I
  determined at least to offer one last consolation to the friend I could not
  save: the consolation of knowing that one heart on earth beat true. For the
  glory of our common faith I intended, as soon as Quintus Claudius should
  appear on the arena, to hasten down to meet him, to thank him once more for
  the infinite, loving kindness he has shown to a poor slave, and to suffer the
  same death by his side. Then your spies seized me. Well, who knows whether
  this disaster, which at first drove me to despair, is not rather the merciful
  dealing of Providence? You are all- powerful; your wisdom rules the Empress.
  I swear to you by that God whom we confess, unshaken even in death, that I
  will not only be silent myself as to your crime, but that I will bind over
  Afranius to do likewise, if you will use your influence to save Quintus
  Claudius."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" said Stephanus with a gasp. "I hate him, he is my enemy, he
  must die."</p>

  <p>"Does that mean, that you have reason to fear him too if he lives?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Stephanus, scowling.</p>

  <p>"Do not be uneasy; a Christian forgives his enemies. Believe me, Cneius
  Afranius is a far more dangerous foe; and yet, I swear solemnly "</p>

  <p>"Folly!" interrupted the steward. "Even if I took your word for it, so far
  as you are concerned, who shall warrant me, that Cneius Afranius will listen
  to you?"</p>

  <p>"My solemn oath. Afranius will do what I promise in his name, if I tell
  him that I pledged his word for the life of Quintus."</p>

  <p>"Stephanus! Stephanus!" It was the girlish voice of the lad Antinous who,
  now that his master had given him his freedom, called him quite familiarly by
  his name.</p>

  <p>The steward hastily sheathed and hid the dagger, and hurried out of the
  room. He locked the door carefully and went to meet the boy, who had come to
  announce the arrival of Lycoris and Leaina. They came in at the same moment;
  Leaina with formal politeness, Lycoris almost with vehemence.</p>

  <p>"Where is he? where have you put him?" she asked. "I must speak to him, I
  must question him!"</p>

  <p>"I do not understand," said Stephanus evasively. "Explain yourself."</p>

  <p>"Presently, my good friend, after supper; but, for the present, just take
  my sweet Leaina into your handsomest parlor and pay her a few compliments on
  her fine-scented hair.<a href="#154">154</a> You are expecting other guests
  of course&mdash;they may arrive at any moment. Meanwhile, leave me alone with
  your prisoner&mdash;I want to find out from him, how on earth he succeeded in
  making a Nazarene of Quintus Claudius."</p>

  <p>"What interest can you take in the question?"</p>

  <p>"The interest of curiosity&mdash;and something more. Do you suppose we
  women remain quite indifferent, when the handsomest man in Rome is thrown to
  the lions?"</p>

  <p>"He ought to be left to us," laughed Leaina; "we should demolish him more
  tenderly."</p>

  <p>"But, I beg of you..." said Stephanus, paying no heed to Leaina. "If it
  were known&mdash;what would people think?"</p>

  <p>"Anything they please. Make haste; where is he? I am dying to hear what he
  has to say."</p>

  <p>"Very well " said Stephanus, shrugging his</p>

  <p>shoulders, and with an unsteady hand he unlocked the door again, went into
  the room, and whispered to the slave. "I will see what can be done for
  Quintus Claudius&mdash;meanwhile, not a word&mdash;or..."</p>

  <p>He ended with a horribly suggestive gesture. Then he added in a louder
  tone:</p>

  <p>"Here is a lady, who wants some information as to your relations with
  Quintus Claudius; answer her with due respect and strict regard to
  truth."</p>

  <p>The bronze lamp was still standing on the shelf. Lycoris went in and
  closed the door behind her, while Stephanus, with a heavy heart, conducted
  Leaina to the peristyle where, in a few minutes, they were joined by Martial
  and a few other guests, who vied with each other in their attentions to the
  graceful and coquettish Asiatic.</p>

  <p>Then they went to table. The first dish had been handed round, the first
  cup was emptied&mdash;Lycoris was still with the prisoner. At last Stephanus
  sent a messenger, who returned with an indefinite answer. A quarter of an
  hour slipped by; the steward was growing impatient. He sent a second
  messenger, who, to his great astonishment, brought back the reply that
  Lycoris felt ill, and begged to be excused if she did not join them in the
  triclinium.</p>

  <p>Stephanus started to his feet. What nonsense was this? Did this saucy jade
  take him for a fool? or was she making common cause with the foe? Who could
  tell whether this private meeting with Eurymachus had not been instigated by
  Parthenius? After all that Stephanus had heard from Clodianus, there was
  nothing he might not expect at the hands of the wire-puller at the
  Palatium</p>

  <p>He excused himself to his guests with a jest, and hastened to the room
  where he had left Lycoris. What was his astonishment at finding the young
  Massilian sitting on the floor by the slave, and bathed in tears; while
  Eurymachus, with a faint flush on his face, was exhorting her in grave and
  solemn tones, and only ceased speaking as Stephanus appeared in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>The Massilian rose and dried her eyes and cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I thank you heartily,". she said with a deep sigh; "you have lifted a
  burden from my soul&mdash;ah! I never knew till now how intolerable it
  was."</p>

  <p>"What is going on here?" asked Stephanus, suspiciously. "You are weeping?
  Will you have the goodness to explain to me...?"</p>

  <p>"Not now. No, nor presently! You could never understand what it is that
  moves me. How pale you are! I verily believe you are afraid of your slave
  there. You do not know, that his noble soul forgives you? But you, too, must
  try to overcome the hatred that possesses you. You must grant the slave his
  freedom, and give him the means of quitting Rome in secret and in safety.
  Nay, more; you must now, at once, make a last effort to mitigate the fate of
  Quintus Claudius. I wish it&mdash;I demand it&mdash;I insist upon
  it&mdash;and, let me tell you, I am in a position to enforce my commands.
  Nay, you need not scowl so; I mean it."</p>

  <p>"Lycoris!" exclaimed Stephanus, trembling in every limb, "do not forget to
  whom you owe everything, and what you rose from."</p>

  <p>"From bog and mire, I know it well&mdash;but not to struggle all my life-
  long in the slough of dependence. You have counted without your host,
  Stephanus 1 I am no longer your tool. It is you yourself who, without knowing
  it, have shown me the path to freedom. One sign from me, and Parthenius will
  crush you to the earth. I have paid dearly for my power, bought it with sin
  and disgrace&mdash;but I mean to use it. Go, Stephanus, and fulfil the
  behests of the miserable and despised creature, on whose neck you once could
  have set your foot."</p>

  <p>Before Stephanus could reply, Antinous, his familiar, was standing before
  him, offering him a note. "A message from the Empress," he said, out of
  breath.</p>

  <p>Stephanus opened it and read:</p>

  <p>"Domitia to her Steward. I must speak with you at once, this instant."</p>

  <p>"I will come," said Stephanus, with a side glance at Lycoris. "The
  messenger can say, that I am close behind him. And now, Lycoris&mdash;I
  cannot wait&mdash;I promise you..."</p>

  <p>"Well, what?"</p>

  <p>"All&mdash;everything," he said in utter bewilderment, "only give me time
  to breathe."</p>

  <p>They went together out of the cell, and Stephanus himself locked the door;
  then he seized Lycoris by her wrist and his eyes had a sinister roll.</p>

  <p>"I beg of you," he said, "take my place with my guests."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she replied. "But you&mdash;do not forget."</p>

  <p>"Serpent!" he snarled between his teeth as he hastily quitted the
  room.</p>

  <p>Domitia received him with unwonted ceremony, and in that same rose-
  colored room into which she had once before admitted him. She was handsomer
  than ever.</p>

  <p>"Stephanus," she began. "You have carried out your task with a mastery,
  that almost makes me tremble. I am standing face to face with a splendid
  triumph, and yet&mdash;the gods know! I do not rejoice in it. I am told that
  Quintus Claudius is as calm and unshaken as a demi-god. To-day, as I saw the
  beasts standing over their gory prey, I pictured him to myself&mdash;him...!
  Stephanus, even at this last moment, you must stem the current and divert it
  into some happier channel. You may call me faithless&mdash;false; I cannot
  help it, I refuse you the reward of your cruel services, unless you succeed
  even now in saving Quintus Claudius."</p>

  <p>"But Madam, you crush me to the earth," cried Stephanus in accents of
  unfeigned despair. "You too...! But how can I...? If you yourself have not
  the power..."</p>

  <p>"You must achieve, what your mistress has failed in doing. I have asked
  his pardon of Caesar, and have been refused&mdash;perhaps for no other
  reason, but that it was I who asked it. I loathe the fate, which thus
  humiliates me! And you, Stephanus, can you risk your life for your
  mistress?"</p>

  <p>"For the prize of your love? my life a thousand times over."</p>

  <p>"Well then&mdash;but come close that I may speak low. I know, that during
  the last few months you have often in secret paid visits to Clodianus; ah!
  your surprise is in itself a confession. You are compromised, past all
  escape; but fear nothing! I know all. Now, perhaps, you may understand what
  has hitherto puzzled you: why I have tried to influence Parthenius through
  Lycoris.&mdash;Now, tell me, how would you like to see Domitia, your
  sovereign. Empress of the World?"</p>

  <p>"Madam&mdash;I am bewildered, helpless; too much is coming upon me at
  once. I confess..."</p>

  <p>"Now, consider what you have to do. If the sceptre were in my hand this
  day, Quintus Claudius would be pardoned. But, as it is, my will is a mere
  breath beating vainly against the rock of perversity and cruelty. It is all
  the same, you must save him&mdash;I swear it, by my wrath, by my love!"</p>

  <p>"Oh! this is torment, martyrdom! What an incredible revulsion; is your
  revenge already slaked? And supposing I could save him&mdash;who knows
  whether you might not then reproach me, for having yielded to the request you
  insist on so vehemently to-day? Then, once more, I should be cheated of
  heaven and plunged deeper than ever into the gulf of despair."</p>

  <p>"I swear to you by Styx, that dark river by which the gods themselves
  swear: I am yours, as soon as Quintus is saved. You must see, Stephanus,
  offended pride has gone too far. Have you not heard, that his father is on
  his death-bed? Pity will have its way, if only for the guiltless father's
  sake. I too will claim the privilege of the gods and forgive. Now, leave me,
  Stephanus&mdash; go, set to work at once."</p>

  <p>"I have no notion how.&mdash;But Domitia commands, and I obey. Such a
  passion as mine dares even the impossible."</p>

  <p>He left the room.</p>

  <p>"I am but a weak creature," said Domitia to herself, "but I am under a
  spell. The idea came suddenly into my mind like an inspiration from heaven,
  and I was goaded by it into action. No, no, I cannot bear it; Quintus
  Claudius a victim to some ravening brute! That noble form, mangled and torn!
  Sooner would I strangle him with my own hands."</p>

  <p>Stephanus went to his own rooms, and there he demeaned himself like a
  madman. What curse was this, that had fallen upon him, in this absurd demand
  from three quarters at once? Had he triumphed so signally over Quintus
  Claudius, only to lose his vantage-ground; had he so painfully raised an
  edifice only to strike it into ruins with his own hand? Besides, how was he
  to do the odious task in so short a time? It was enough to drive him mad.</p>

  <p>For the first time in many years the most unheard-of thing occurred:
  Stephanus, the courtly man of the world, entirely forgot his company. He had
  left them at table and did not even return to apologize. He paced his study
  incessantly like a tiger in his cage, and when at last Lycoris came in search
  of him, his face was furious, his eyes bloodshot, his lips livid.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" asked Lycoris horrified.</p>

  <p>"Has the boy made fools of you all?" shrieked the steward, hoarse with
  rage. "Away with you&mdash;go! You see I am incapable of attending to
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Oh! I am going. But do not forget&mdash;every minute is precious."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap19"
     id="chap19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p>On the following morning, at the earliest gloaming, Quintus Claudius was
  conducted from the dungeons of the Tullianum to the underground cells of the
  Amphitheatre;<a href="#155">155</a> and with him were Cornelia and some of
  the other Nazarenes. About fifty were reserved for the last days of the
  festival.</p>

  <p>The procession of the condemned moved silently along the Via Sacra; as
  they passed through the arch of Titus and the yellow grey of the eastern sky
  fell upon their faces, they looked like a file of corpses. Cornelia was as
  pale as death, and her eyes looked larger than ever. Only Quintus seemed to
  have lost little of his handsome and elastic youthfulness during these months
  of imprisonment.</p>

  <p>The prisoners were all, without exception, calm and composed. Even those
  few who, when they first set out, had wept and lamented, soon recovered their
  firmness when they saw that of their fellow-sufferers.</p>

  <p>Cornelia herself was perfectly unmoved. Though she had no ground for that
  happy assurance and sustaining comfort, which her companions found in their
  confident faith, she was invincible through her stolid contempt for life
  which, now that all hope was over, seemed to petrify her spirit and her
  senses. To live without Quintus was simply impossible. If Fate would not
  relinquish this victim, if the dark sisters were inexorable to her
  overwhelming grief, she could have but one wish: to die with the man she
  loved. To be free from this torment, to vanish into nothingness; this was the
  one idea that possessed her soul. Even the horror of the last scene of
  all&mdash;the dishonor of standing as a spectacle to the gaping crowd, the
  agonizing pain under the fangs of the beasts&mdash;of all this she took no
  account. And so it came to pass that she, disbelieving and hopeless, she who
  so lately tore her hair like one demented&mdash;now, on the road to death,
  bore herself as bravely as the staunchest confessors of the Redeemer; nay,
  more bravely than some. And the passing glance, a look from soul to soul,
  that she had exchanged with Quintus as they came out of the prison&mdash;the
  first for so many weeks&mdash;had only fanned this passionate desire for
  annihilation and eternal rest to a fiercer flame.</p>

  <p>That look had had a very different effect on her lover. After struggling
  in the loneliness of a dark cell^ and triumphing at length over all that
  could chain him to life; after a hundred victories over every torture of mind
  and body, won in the glorious name of duty; the fervent Christian, who hoped
  confidently that the Son of God would support those who endured such dreadful
  torment through faith in his sufferings, and that he would, through these
  torments, work their salvation&mdash;this unwavering hero quailed as at a new
  grief, when h^ saw the wasted form of the beautiful young girl. For the first
  time, since Caesar's message of impossible respite had been brought to him,
  the thought flashed through his brain: Three beasts! could it be hoped for?
  But the flash vanished before it could dazzle him.&mdash;A gladiator's short
  blade and a Gaetulian lion! Verily it was only adding mockery to brutality,
  if Caesar called this mercy!</p>

  <p>Nevertheless the idea had found place in his mind, and though his reason
  rejected it at once and absolutely, it haunted the background of his
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>How greatly must Cornelia love him, if merely out of defiance, merely to
  force him to recant, she could declare her adherence to the doomed sect, whom
  in her heart she scorned. What self-immolation, worthy of the highest crown.
  Or had a ray of that saving light fallen on her heart? Quintus felt it a duty
  to be sure on this point. Now, in the face of death, she could not deny the
  divine truth of the doctrine of Salvation; if she still should do so, well,
  she must and should, at that supreme moment, speak the truth&mdash;deny the
  faith, save her life and learn to believe afterwards perhaps. He did not
  know, that Cornelia was guilty also of attempting Caesar's life; that corrupt
  witnesses had represented this deed, not as a desperate stroke for
  self-defence, but as an act of revenge for her uncle's exile, and that the
  verdict had pronounced it a crime in the first degree.</p>

  <p>When they reached the vaulted cells of the Amphitheatre, the victims were
  relieved of their fetters and well supplied with food and drink, that they
  might not appear too miserable in face of the final catastrophe; some,
  indeed, who refused to eat, were compelled to do so by force. After this they
  were left to themselves. The two exits from the vaults were barred and
  guarded on the outside.</p>

  <p>Then many a heart-rending scene took place in those damp and dimly-
  lighted caverns; in every comer there was a group, whispering, praying,
  weeping.</p>

  <p>On a stone bench near the chief entrance sat our worthy Diphilus, his eyes
  fixed on his young wife, Euterpe, who was kneeling before him, her face
  hidden in his lap.</p>

  <p>"And you forgive me?" she sobbed; "you forgive me for everything? Oh I
  have been very wicked; I have been a miserable sinner, and do not deserve
  that you should call me your wife."</p>

  <p>Her husband gently stroked her hair, but he did not speak; he seemed lost
  in thought. She, however, sobbed incessantly: "Forgive me, oh forgive me!"
  Then clasping her hands, she prayed: "O God! All-merciful Father, do not
  desert us! Have pity on Thy children for Jesus Christ's sake! Almighty God,
  comfort us and have mercy on us!"</p>

  <p>Presently she got up and sat down by the side of her speechless husband;
  she threw her arms round him and kissed him.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she whispered, and she shuddered, "what prayer shall I say in
  the last awful moment, when they are tearing my limbs? But oh! it is
  impossible; God can never leave us to die like this. No, He cannot, He
  cannot. No earthly father would, why then should our Father in Heaven? Say,
  Diphilus, he will send us an angel to bear us away to the land of joy and
  peace? It is only to try us&mdash;say, Diphilus."</p>

  <p>"My poor child," said Diphilus, and he broke into tears.</p>

  <p>And then she began again, chattering in her sweet, silly way, till at
  last, almost while she was speaking, her eyelids closed, and her head sank
  gently on his breast; she was asleep&mdash;and in a few hours her round young
  limbs were to be mangled by beasts of prey.</p>

  <p>There was another couple of senatorial rank there besides Quintus and
  Cornelia: the consul, Flavius Clemens,<a href="#156">156</a> a man of
  blameless character and the highest merit, and with him his noble wife. Both
  in calm and silent resignation had joined a group, that had gathered round a
  girl of eight, who had sunk into a decline in consequence of her long
  imprisonment. Her father, an artisan from the Subura, had carried the poor
  child in his arms from one prison to the other. She was now half sitting and
  leaning against the wall, looking round her with large, ghastly-bright eyes,
  while her father held her hands and listened to her words as though they were
  a revelation from Heaven.</p>

  <p>"Do not cry, father dear," she said coaxingly. "That good angel, that has
  so often come to me, will not have your Cynthia torn by lions. He is coming
  to fetch me away. There&mdash;there&mdash;where the wall is open and you see
  the blue sky through&mdash;he is there in the sunshine."</p>

  <p>A faint smile fleeted across the wasted face, transient and melancholy as
  the last rosy hue of an autumn sunset. She closed her eyes, but opened them
  again at once in rapt ecstasy.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, father," she said with a sigh. "I am going first, up into
  that bright and glorious heaven. When the time comes, and your heart is
  breaking with terror and pain, remember me, father, and do not forget that I
  shall be praying to God. to give you strength and courage to the last. Oh
  father, I thank you too for having loved me so much, and for having taught me
  to know the Saviour, and taken care of me in all your trouble. And I thank
  you too, dear good friends, and I will pray to God for you all as well. What
  a glorious sight! I can see far, far away into the gates of light. Yes, Angel
  of Hope, I am ready to follow you. Kiss me, father, once more, for He has got
  my hand&mdash;He is flying, dragging me up&mdash;up..." her arms fell into
  her lap, and she sighed deeply. Then she lay still, as if she had gone to
  sleep.</p>

  <p>"Cynthia, my child!" cried the father, and with a loud sob he pressed the
  cold, slender hands to his furrowed face.</p>

  <p>"She is dead!" he said. "God's mercy has spared her the worst."</p>

  <p>The by-standers, who had so victoriously lived down their own sufferings,
  stood deeply moved at the sight of the gentle, innocent creature, that had
  been held captive like a criminal, and almost literally tortured to
  death.</p>

  <p>"It is well with her!" said Flavius Clemens, clasping his weeping wife in
  his arms.</p>

  <p>Calmer than all else, as it appeared, was the half-whispered dialogue
  between Quintus and Cornelia. Each was endeavoring to utter what was bursting
  their hearts, but in as indifferent a tone and with as little gesture as
  possible, so as not to attract the attention of their fellow-prisoners.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Cornelia," whispered Quintus, hardly daring to open his lips.
  "You are here solely in the hope of urging me to recant. It is not true, that
  you are really condemned to death?"</p>

  <p>Cornelia looked him in the face with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>"Of urging you to recant?" she repeated slowly. "Alas! if any sufferings
  of mine could have softened your heart, we should never have come to this!
  Why, you would see me torn to pieces ten times over by wild beasts, before
  you would yield a jot of what you call the truth. No, Quintus, it is quite
  true. You did not care to live with your devoted Cornelia&mdash;very good;
  then if you must suffer death, Cornelia dies too. It is as simple as a
  nursery rhyme."</p>

  <p>Quintus shuddered.</p>

  <p>"But could any one condemn you?" he said. "You are not one of the
  sect."</p>

  <p>"I pronounced myself guilty&mdash;and they believed me."</p>

  <p>"Then you deceived your judges. Or has what was untrue become the truth by
  the force of conviction?"</p>

  <p>Cornelia haughtily shook her head.</p>

  <p>"My dearest," said Quintus, hardly able to control his grief, "you are
  destroying my last hope of comfort. Ah Cornelia! if we could but have died
  united in a common faith! But as it is, woe to us both, Cornelia; your death
  is in itself a sin."</p>

  <p>"You alone are guilty of it."</p>

  <p>"I!" cried Quintus, in utter despair; his voice spoke grief too great for
  words, and Cornelia's eyes humbly implored forgiveness.</p>

  <p>"But how can I force my heart to submit?" she said as gently as an ill-
  used child. "Can I wish to live, if you die? Or again, can I believe what my
  reason condemns as a fable? Oh! I am not laughing at it, as I did when I
  first went to see you in prison! I feel now that faith is an invincible
  force, and gives bliss and strength even in the hour of death. And yet it
  seems to me a madness, a delirium of raving fancy. No, I cannot believe,
  however much I may desire it. My faith in Isis made me strong too&mdash;and
  it was all a lie, foul and base treachery. Ah! Quintus, Quintus, you are
  sacrificing your young and promising life for a mere dream, a delusion, a
  shadow&mdash;throwing everything away for an empty bubble!"</p>

  <p>"My poor Cornelia!" said Quintus deeply moved. "The greatest idea, that
  ever dawned in the mind of man, you call a delusion and a dream. It is true,
  perhaps, that many of the aspects under which we shadow forth this great
  conception are petty and childish, for we are but weak and helpless mortals.
  But the essential part, the living principle which lies hidden behind these
  symbols, is true and perfect to all eternity. Poor, hapless Cornelia; how
  will you find courage to look death in the face; you, forsaken, alone,
  without a Saviour&mdash;hopeless&mdash;speechless&mdash;when the Nazarene can
  joyfully murmur the name of Jesus Christ? What prayer, what word of comfort
  can you find to whisper in that awful moment?"</p>

  <p>"Can you ask?" said Cornelia, looking into his eyes. "The last words, that
  my lips will utter, will be your name, my first, last, only love. My god, my
  saviour, is called Quintus Claudius."</p>

  <p>Quintus could control himself no longer; the tears started to his eyes. He
  clasped her in his arms and covered her lips, cheeks and brow with passionate
  kisses.</p>

  <p>Thus they stood for a time in an oblivious embrace. Suddenly they heard
  the roll of drums; a sudden terror fell upon the party of prisoners. This
  drumming was the signal for the fights in the arena to begin. The scattered
  groups drew closer together; the flute-player had sprung up with a scream.
  Some of the men began to bewail themselves and lament loudly, but the consul
  presently succeeded in controlling this outburst of terror. In a firm, loud
  voice, he admonished his fellow-victims to emulate the example of the
  Redeemer, and to remain steadfast through all their torments, so that the
  sight of their unshaken courage might win Him new disciples among the people.
  Then he told them how nobly the servants of the Lord had died under Nero; how
  even when burnt by slow fires, lighted by the hand of Caesar himself, with
  their latest breath they proclaimed the truth in Christ Jesus. The prisoners
  listened with growing devotion to his enthusiastic appeal, and the vault was
  as still as the catacomb used to be, when the little congregation met there
  for their Feast of Love.</p>

  <p>When Flavius Clemens ceased, a strange sound fell on the ear; it was the
  clapping and applause of the spectators, which was heard only as lulled by
  distance, like the tramp of a horse's hoofs over a wooden bridge. The first
  scene of the bloody performance was over&mdash;a fight probably, like that of
  yesterday, between two gladiators. The fatal moment was drawing nearer and
  nearer.</p>

  <p>Twice or thrice was this fearfully suggestive sound repeated, mixed with
  confused shouts and wild laughter; heavy steps were heard in the corridor and
  the principal entrance was unbarred.</p>

  <p>The bravest quailed, paralyzed by terror, and stared with glassy eyes at
  the door, which opened slowly, creaking on its hinges. An armed soldier stood
  on the threshold, and two others were visible on the steps that led up to the
  arena.</p>

  <p>"Diphilus, the carpenter, and Euterpe, his wife!" cried the warden in a
  harsh voice. Diphilus had started up the instant he heard his name called.
  With his head bent forward, he fixed his gaze on the apparition in the
  door-way as though he thought he might be dreaming. Euterpe had crept behind
  him; like a child threatened with punishment, she hid herself behind her
  husband's stalwart form.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" said the man. "Make haste! The people are waiting."</p>

  <p>"We are ready," said the carpenter.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no!" shrieked Euterpe wildly. "I will be hewn in pieces, before I
  go up to that horrible blood-stained place. I cannot, Diphilus&mdash;no, not
  if the Lord himself were to appear and command me."</p>

  <p>"Woman," said the man-at-arms, "give over whimpering and do not keep me
  waiting. There is no help for you now; and besides," he added with a jeer,
  "the beasts will only be all the hungrier."</p>

  <p>"Control yourself and pray to God," whispered Diphilus.</p>

  <p>"I cannot, 1 cannot," sobbed Euterpe falling on her knees. "Why must I
  die&mdash;and I am so young, and this world is a very pleasant one! Mercy,
  for Christ's sake have mercy! No, no, I am not a Christian. I am innocent,
  indeed I am. I was misled&mdash;go and tell Caesar, tell the cruel judges. I
  cannot die, I will repent before the altar of Jupiter&mdash;only let me live,
  and my good honest Diphilus."</p>

  <p>"Miserable, weak creature!" said Flavius Clemens, going up to the
  distracted woman and stroking her hair with a pitiful smile. "God will
  forgive you for what you have said in your terror of death. It does not come
  from your heart, and God is love."</p>

  <p>Then turning to the man he said: "Is it not possible to give her a little
  longer time? If we came first&mdash;I and my wife?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible," said the man.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Diphilus had infused some little courage into the trembling
  Euterpe. She got up, but her knees gave way. He took her up, more dead than
  alive, and bursting into tears, clasped her in his arms.</p>

  <p>The warden signed to his comrades; without saying a word they snatched her
  from him. One of them, a red-haired Sicambrian, lifted up the slender form of
  the weeping woman, as if she were a mere plaything, and carried her up the
  steps. The other two followed with Diphilus, who held himself bravely, and
  waved a farewell to those who remained behind.</p>

  <p>The door fell to with a crash, and no sooner had the footsteps died away,
  than they heard the signal drum. Most of the prisoners fell on their knees at
  the horrible sound and raised their hands in passionate supplication. Flavius
  Clemens, Quintus and Cornelia remained standing.</p>

  <p>There was a breathless, silence; lips moved but spoke not, only a
  suppressed sob now and then broke the deathly stillness. Suddenly a
  convulsive shudder thrilled the worshippers, the dull roar of a lion was
  heard; involuntarily every eye was more fervently raised and hands were
  clasped more tightly. Then there was a fearful shriek, shrill, despairing,
  piercing&mdash;and then again the wild applause, the clapping, shouting and
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"That was Euterpe," whispered Quintus, pressing his face against the
  wall.</p>

  <p>Nearly two hours went by, before the vault was opened again. The interval
  was occupied by a series of combats on horseback in grand classical style;
  and when the man next appeared he hailed twelve of the Christians at
  once.</p>

  <p>It was strange, but the victims were now all calm and composed. The men
  and women, who at the first appearance of the messenger of death had flinched
  and quailed, now only betrayed by their shortened breathing, that the door
  that stood open before them led to death, and not to liberty.</p>

  <p>"The Lord give you strength!" cried Flavius Clemens as the door closed
  upon them, and the remaining handful looked at each other with a sad and
  wistful smile. Their number was greatly diminished; at every moment the end
  drew nearer&mdash;nearer and more certain.</p>

  <p>At noon the noble Flavius was led out to die, and a few minutes later his
  wife followed him. Then the rest, till at last only Quintus and Cornelia were
  left in the subterranean vault.</p>

  <p>"They have reserved us for the last," the girl began after a long and
  painful silence. "The most effective piece to conclude, as the connoisseurs
  say. Oh! Quintus, the disgrace is worse than the dread of death. Tell me, my
  dear love, you will not give the mob the triumph they long for, to see you
  fight like a gladiator? You will obey the voice of pride, which bids us
  rather turn the sword with calm dignity against our own breast?"</p>

  <p>"I shall fight, Cornelia."</p>

  <p>"Miserable man!" she groaned, hiding her face in her hands. "No worthy
  Claudius would say so! Or do you hope to be victorious over the lions?"</p>

  <p>"I hope nothing, for I know that the short dagger is little better than a
  toy. But so long as my arm can wield it, I have no right to drop it out of
  self- conceit. It Providence has so willed, even that puny weapon will avail
  to fell the foe..."</p>

  <p>"You are mad&mdash;or rather, I see now your creed is indeed the creed for
  slaves. It treads the pride of man into the dust."</p>

  <p>"True pride is that, which raises a man above all prejudice&mdash;which
  teaches him to despise scorn and look down on contempt. I know but one
  law&mdash;that of duty. But you, Cornelia, once more I implore you "</p>

  <p>The rattle of the bolts interrupted him; the dreadful moment had come.</p>

  <p>For one second, breathless and with his eyes closed, he leaned against the
  wall. Then he stood calm and defiant. Cornelia flung her arms round his
  neck.</p>

  <p>"Say not another word, my own dearest love," she said, with passionate
  devotion. "I too know the duty of a true and loving heart. I follow you
  joyfully, and my last breath is yours. Now be yourself, all yourself, and
  never think again about me. If I were to be left alone in the
  world&mdash;then indeed I might claim your tears; but, as it is, death cures
  every ill."</p>

  <p>Quintus felt that Cornelia was equally right from her own point of view,
  as he, as a Christian, was from his. He kissed her once more on the white and
  trembling lips, which in happier days had spoken so many a fond and tender
  word, blessed her for her heroic faithfulness, swearing that in that other
  unknown land, where they would presently meet again in glory, he would yet
  save the soul that was one with his own.</p>

  <p>Then he took her hand, and led her up the steps.</p>

  <p>The little gate-way was thrown open, and they slowly stepped out on to the
  arena. Whether it was the intense daylight after the dismal twilight of the
  dungeon, or their own tension of nerve and sense&mdash;they saw nothing;
  neither the endless ranks of seats, the thousands of heads that filled the
  Amphitheatre to the topmost course, nor Caesar in his gold-embroidered
  pulvinar. Everything swam before their eyes in a grey mist, a blank chaos.
  They were alone, together, in the midst of this vast multitude. At their feet
  spread the arena with its yellow sands, like an island in an ocean.</p>

  <p>Cornelia tottered; she would probably have lost consciousness if the hard
  rattle of the drum, and immediately after the loud voice of the master of the
  ceremonies proclaiming the names of the victims, had not startled her into
  life again.</p>

  <p>A servant came up to Quintus, and handed him the short dagger-like
  sword.</p>

  <p>"Be sure to throw it," he whispered stealthily in his ear.</p>

  <p>Quintus, who recovered an unhoped sense of self-protection as soon as he
  felt himself armed, looked enquiringly in the fellow's face.</p>

  <p>"If you value your life," the slave repeated, "throw at him, throw the
  knife." And he withdrew to his place behind the parapet.</p>

  <p>What could he mean? No doubt, if Quintus were close to the lion, even in
  the event of his striking a fatal blow, it might be considered certain that
  in his very death-struggle the beast would mangle him. Still, a stab must be
  surer to hit than a throw; besides which he might be able to stab twice, he
  could not repeat the throw. The suggestion then must be the malicious trap of
  some enemy, or at best the brutal joke of a ruffian.</p>

  <p>The doors at the farther end of the arena were now flung open, and an
  enormous lion, all tawny gold, his wide head loaded with a thick and flowing
  mane, came calmly and majestically out on to the arena. A large black lock of
  hair hung over his eyes.</p>

  <p>Quintus at once recognized that very beast, which had flung itself so
  furiously against the bars of its cage as it stood on the quay at Ostia. He
  clutched the handle of his weapon with a convulsive grip; it suddenly felt so
  small, so ineffectual, that he thought the spectators that sat watching must
  laugh at the absurdity.</p>

  <p>Cornelia was standing a few paces to one side of Quintus, as pale and
  motionless as a marble goddess.</p>

  <p>The lion came deliberately towards them, and Quintus fixed his eye
  steadily on the glaring eye of the foe. Suddenly the brute seemed to
  hesitate. Could he have recognized the face, which had before so roused his
  ferocity? He lashed his flanks with his sweeping tail, and foaming slaver
  dripped from his jaws. The muscles of his huge paws twitched to
  strike&mdash;and now he crouched to spring. Every sinew was strained, and the
  next instant he flung himself straight at Quintus. At the same moment
  Cornelia had thrown herself in the line of the brute's attack, while Quintus
  started aside. The girl's unexpected movement may have startled the beast; he
  sprang short, and fell on the ground very near to Quintus, and as he fell the
  sword pierced his shoulder with such force, that it went up to the hilt.</p>

  <p>What was this? What an unheard-of stroke of skill! The knife had hardly
  hit the lion, when he sank limp and helpless; he shuddered with a tremendous
  convulsion, and then rolled over stark and stiff in the sand.&mdash; He was
  dead.</p>

  <p>Quintus could not believe his eyes&mdash;some demon, he thought, must have
  tricked his excited senses. How was it possible? One of these monstrous
  beasts, in whose side half a dozen of lances would sometimes be broken,
  before their tenacious vitality was spent&mdash;and this sudden death had
  resulted from a single stroke, though, it is true, a shrewd one?</p>

  <p>But the uproarious applause of the crowd gave him no time to meditate upon
  the miracle.</p>

  <p>"Mercy for Quintus Claudius!" was shouted in a thousand voices, and from
  every side.</p>

  <p>"Caesar, release him! Pardon for Quintus Claudius!"</p>

  <p>Pale as death, his lips set, his brows knit, Caesar sat impassible in the
  midst of the storm. Clodianus went up to him and, with a meaning smile,
  whispered something in his ear. Caesar angrily shook his head.<a href=
  "#157">157</a></p>

  <p>"Pardon for Quintus Claudius! Pardon for his betrothed!" rang out
  incessantly, and louder than before, from every part of the Amphitheatre.</p>

  <p>"My lord and husband," said Domitia, bowing with dignified and well-
  feigned indifference to her frowning sovereign, "your clemency will save
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Never!" cried Domitian, rising from his seat.</p>

  <p>He signed to the herald, and the tumult was hushed.</p>

  <p>"Romans!" said Caesar in a voice like distant thunder. "You are demanding
  mercy for a man, who pronounced his own sentence of death. He had his life in
  his own hands. One word, one single word of recantation, and he was free. His
  obstinacy refused to speak the word. Romans, Caesar pardons none but those
  who repent."</p>

  <p>"None but cowards!" shouted a voice from the top seats.</p>

  <p>"Pardon for Quintus Claudius!" the shouting began again&mdash;the building
  seemed to tremble at the terrific uproar.</p>

  <p>"Quintus," murmured Cornelia, closing her eyes, "speak the word, that will
  set you free! You will not escape your fate a second time. Quintus, if ever
  you loved me..."</p>

  <p>A melancholy smile and a look of utter devotion were the only
  response.</p>

  <p>Again Clodianus made some remark, in an undertone, to the wrathful
  sovereign, and once more the herald commanded silence.</p>

  <p>"I am merciful and kind," said Caesar. "I am always glad to fulfil the
  desires of my beloved Romans, so far as it is possible. But here I am bound
  by duty. The utmost I can grant is a reprieve. For this day the criminal is
  respited from carrying on the struggle. He may have time to recover himself
  and collect his strength; then victory may crown his efforts a second and a
  third time. Then, my faithful Romans, your heart's desire will be fulfilled,
  and the object of your sympathy will be free!"</p>

  <p>A murmur of discontent rose from the disappointed people; however, they
  felt that any farther insistence would be useless, if not rash. They had not
  failed to observe that, at the very beginning of the tumult, Domitian had
  beckoned the commander of the body-guard to his side, and when he was in this
  frame of mind some violent measures on the Emperor's part were only too
  probable.<a href="#158">158</a></p>

  <p>"Good counsel prevails over revenge," said the voice from the upper
  circle.</p>

  <p>The master of the ceremonies hastened to lead Quintus and Cornelia away.
  The dead lion, which lay with its long blue-black tongue hanging out of its
  foaming jaws, was dragged off through one of the gates, and the arena hastily
  strewn with fresh sand. A fight between a little girl of thirteen and a
  dwarf<a href="#159">159</a> soon put the incidents of Quintus' struggle out
  of the heads of the spectators, and by the end of the day, when the whole
  arena was flooded with water and a magnificent naval fight was
  performed,<a href="#160">160</a> few indeed remembered the brave youth and
  his pale, beautiful companion.</p>

  <p>Few&mdash;but still some did.</p>

  <p>First of these was Caesar, who swore that he never would consent to save
  the life of a man, whom Cornelia would follow to death rather than enjoy the
  favors of Caesar. All the emptiness and nothingness of his existence had come
  home to his conscience, as he looked on at that life and death fight. He, who
  was only hated and feared, felt at that moment a wild hunger for love and
  constancy; but this impulse, in itself so purely human, at once assumed, in
  his degraded soul, the form of aggravated vindictiveness.</p>

  <p>Then, there was Domitia. Her hatred, which had long been dying out, broke
  down altogether under the impression of what she had just
  witnessed&mdash;even her hatred for Cornelia, her happy and envied rival,
  over whose death in lingering torment the rancorous Empress had so long
  gloated in fancy.</p>

  <p>Shortly after the beginning of the naumachia Domitia quitted the
  amphitheatre and returned to the palace, where her steward met her.</p>

  <p>"Is my Lady and Mistress content?" he inquired in abject tones.</p>

  <p>"Content?" repeated Domitia. "And is it any merit of yours if he won the
  victory in an unequal fight?"</p>

  <p>"Madam," said Stephanus, "the time was short, and every effort to move
  Caesar failed. I used the only means, that lay within my power, or did you
  really suppose, that a Gaetulian lion could be killed like a hare with a nip
  of the hunter's fingers? The dagger was poisoned."</p>

  <p>"Ah! I understand..." She would have said more, but Polycharma rushed
  breathless into the room.</p>

  <p>"I want Stephanus&mdash;a messenger from the amphitheatre..."</p>

  <p>"Bid him come in," said the Empress.</p>

  <p>A young man handed a note to the steward. Stephanus turned pale as he read
  it, and he closed his eyes as if blinded by a flash.</p>

  <p>"Go, it is well," he stammered, and he crushed the letter in his hand.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" asked Domitia.</p>

  <p>"Madam&mdash;the worst that can happen. The master of the ceremonies
  suspects&mdash;the trick is discovered."</p>

  <p>The Empress flushed crimson.</p>

  <p>"Then you no longer have Quintus alone to save, but yourself too,
  Stephanus. Your life is at stake as well as his. Remember, consider the
  reward that awaits you! Let Rome perish if need be, but prevent that last,
  worst..."</p>

  <p>"You command, and I obey."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap20"
     id="chap20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p>Day was dying; the sun sank, blood-red, into the Tyrrhenian sea. The
  Capitol and the arches of the Amphitheatre still glowed in fiery purple, when
  the streets already lay in cool twilight. Then the last glory died away from
  their topmost crests, and the blue darkness stole up the walls; night
  enveloped the pleasure-loving crowd and their martyred victims&mdash;at last
  the people seemed to have had their fill. They poured out of the Amphitheatre
  like an overflowing stream, over the Forum, through the Vicus Cyprius and the
  neighboring streets.</p>

  <p>While Rome was resting and refreshing itself after the exciting pleasures
  of the day, and giving itself up to the sweet influences of the warm spring
  evening, six noble ships were flying before the wind from the island of
  Igilium.<a href="#161">161</a> At about three hours before midnight the
  vessels came to anchor close by Alsium,<a href="#162">162</a> and landed
  their passengers&mdash;three cohorts of picked men&mdash;without let or
  hindrance. The son of the Propraetor of Lugdunensis, was at their head, and
  with him were Caius Aurelius Menapius and the one-armed centurion. The
  Propraetor himself was advancing with the rest of the forces by the main
  north road, the Via Cassia,<a href="#163">163</a> and had already reached
  Clusium,<a href="#164">164</a> while the rest of the conspirators were coming
  round south-eastwards with a smaller following from Luna,<a href=
  "#165">165</a> and Pisae<a href="#166">166</a> to Rusellae<a href=
  "#167">167</a> to join the Propraetor's troops at the Forum Cassii.<a href=
  "#168">168</a></p>

  <p>Domitian knew only of the advance of the Propraetor, and still supposed
  that it was in fulfilment of his own orders. Completely hoodwinked as he was
  by Clodianus, he had himself insisted on reinforcements within the city
  itself The adjutant had indeed here taken advantage of the circumstance, that
  Caesar had received repeated and mysterious warnings that a great conspiracy
  was on foot. The disembarkation at Alsium was the first step towards open
  revolt, and though Clodianus, in collusion with Parthenius, did his utmost to
  prevent this news from reaching the Palatium and the Praetorian Guard, whom
  they could not yet regard as secured&mdash; nay, though he was prepared in
  case of need to account for it by some plausible lie, still they could not
  but expect every instant that the mask would be torn aside. Clodianus and
  Parthenius spent the evening outside the walls of Rome in the adjutant's
  villa, and after midnight they adjourned to the house of a freedman of
  Parthenius's, where they held a momentous conference with Norbanus, the
  prefect of the body-guard. After much parleying and persuasion he was won
  over to the side of the conspirators. Caesar's latest outrages, more
  particularly his monstrous injustice towards the senators and knights who had
  lingered, untried, in prison since the day when they were arrested, struck
  the balance in the upright and honorable soldier's mind. But even then, to
  the great regret of the conspirators, Norbanus could only answer for the
  adhesion of three of the cohorts under his command; the others had been
  freshly recruited at the New Year, and the growing distrust of the Emperor
  had filled every post, particularly those of the officers in command, with
  his own special favorites and creatures. Whatever the result might be, it was
  too late to avail themselves of every resource; the road straight forward was
  the only one now open to them. Still, an attempt was worth making at any
  cost. At the worst the Praetorian Guard could certainly be kept in check for
  two days, and by that time the Propraetor and his forces might have reached
  Rome. Possibly too there might be another solution of the
  difficulty.&mdash;Clodianus was thinking of Stephanus.</p>

  <p>By the time the sickle of the waning moon rose ruddy above the horizon,
  the Propraetor's son and his eager troops had already left half the road
  between Alsium and the capital behind them. Aurelius, accompanied by the
  faithful Herodianus and the Goth, rode by the young leader's side, marking
  with happy anticipation the growing distinctness of a black cloud on the
  southern horizon&mdash;that dark silhouette was Rome. Now, as the moon rose,
  Aurelius fancied he could recognize the buildings on the Janiculum, and
  distinguish to the left the temple on the loftier Quirinal. Between these
  points&mdash; which he saw more in fancy than in fact&mdash;dwelt his
  Claudia&mdash;adored and beautiful, "the only She." What must she not have
  suffered during these last months! Ah, and even now be suffering! This very
  day probably the brother, that she so devotedly loved, had fallen a victim to
  Caesar's hideous mania for persecution. Clodianus had indeed promised to do
  everything, even the impossible, only to postpone the frightful climax; but
  who could tell!</p>

  <p>Aurelius set spurs into his horse, as if he could not bear a moment's
  delay till he dashed through the streets of Rome, tore open the prison doors,
  and clasped his rescued friend in his arms. How could he face Claudia, if he
  came too late to save her brother? Why had the execution of the conspiracy
  been so long postponed? The reasons, it is true, had been
  irresistible&mdash;even Cinna had confessed that; but an aching, longing
  heart ignores every motive of strategy and of state-craft, and the days,
  which had been allowed to slip by in inactivity, had seemed a dreary
  eternity. Well, the immediate future would put an end at any rate to
  suspense, and surely the gods could not so cruelly betray his fervid hopes.
  If he should succeed, if fate had such mercy in store&mdash;what joy for him
  of all men to break the chains, what a triumph over the stern and inexorable
  father, who to uphold the law could not spare his own son!</p>

  <p>Aurelius was half-ashamed to find himself thinking so exclusively of his
  own future, when the next few hours must decide the fate of
  millions&mdash;nay, of the Empire. But of what avail were strength of resolve
  and effort of will? His thoughts would revert to the scene he so fondly
  pictured in his dream, when he should clasp his Claudia in his arms, and
  stand proudly before the high- priest with the words: "<i>I</i> restore you
  your son."</p>

  <p>The road was lonely, the step of the marching men sounded loud in the
  silence. The few passengers and vehicles that they met were allowed to pass
  on; but all who were going towards Rome were, willy-nilly, detained, and only
  allowed to proceed in the midst of the cohorts.</p>

  <p>In spite of these precautions they kept on the alert.</p>

  <p>At about half a mile outside Rome, Clodianus and Parthenius joined the
  force, as had been agreed, and the soldiers halted for a moment. The
  conspirators greeted each other warmly. Still, it was only with a determined
  effort, that Aurelius could find a civil word for the chamberlain, for whom
  he had always felt a deep aversion, and who, even now, impressed him as
  odious and repulsive. The loud bluntness of Clodianus, on the contrary, who
  harangued at some length about freedom and patriotism, he felt had the ring
  of genuine coin.</p>

  <p>"I received your father's last message," said Parthenius to the young
  captain. "Well, I must submit. A woman on the throne of the Caesars seems to
  you dangerous, and still more so Cornelius Cinna's scheme of re-establishing
  the Republic. Your father's arguments have, on the whole, convinced me, so we
  will agree.&mdash;Your candidate is also mine."</p>

  <p>"You have our thanks," replied the Propraetor's son. "Our troops are
  already informed as to the work in hand. Nerva's name has been mentioned in
  the ranks, more than once. You will see, my noble friend, that only a spark
  is needed to fire their faithful heat."</p>

  <p>He turned his horse, and faced the troops.</p>

  <p>"Men," he cried in a voice of thunder: "Your Caesar is Marcus Cocceius
  Nerva!"</p>

  <p>"Nerva!" was shouted by a thousand voices. "Down with Domitian! Long live
  Nerva <i>Imperator!</i>"</p>

  <p>The scattered natives, that dwelt near the high-road, might start from
  their sleep in astonishment at this rolling peal of shouts, and ask
  themselves what such a roar of voices could mean. But seeing presently that
  these were armed cohorts, marching in close order on Rome, they no doubt
  crept back under their coverlets with a shake of the head, and the
  time-honored comment that the soldiery were allowed to do just what they
  pleased,<a href="#169">169</a> even to rouse the peaceful peasant from his
  dreams.</p>

  <p>The cohorts themselves set out again with a will, and soon reached the
  western slope of the Janiculum, where, thanks to Clodianus' cautious
  foresight, no obstacle stood in their way.</p>

  <p>Quintus and Cornelia, meanwhile, were enduring a terrible night. After the
  unhoped-for issue of that first combat, they had been led back into the
  underground vault, and there they were left&mdash;either for convenience
  sake, or for fear lest the populace should give too emphatic expression to
  its sympathy, if the prisoners should be seen on the way back to the
  Mamertine prisons. A few rugs were flung on the stone pavement, and a man at
  arms was posted in the cell, while two more guarded the door outside. No one
  thought of giving the exhausted wretches food or drink, for their being yet
  alive was no part of the programme, and the master of the festival had too
  important business on hand, to trouble himself as to the fate of two
  "postponed" victims.</p>

  <p>Cornelia, utterly crushed by all she had gone through, sat in a comer sunk
  in a heap, and silently wringing her hands. It was certain, quite certain,
  that the tyrant was pitiless; the whole thing was merely a prolongation of
  their misery, a postponement of the inevitable, a slow sipping of the cup of
  agony, which others had been allowed to swallow at a gulp! It was more than
  she could bear.</p>

  <p>Even Quintus, who had at first been elated by the sense of victory, became
  every moment more restless and wretched, Cornelia's cry of despair, when the
  lion made its spring&mdash;a cry of horror and yet ecstatic&mdash;had pierced
  his heart. In that supreme utterance, wrung from her very soul, she had
  expressed all that could never have been said in words: a deep and tender
  reproach, a defiance of all their enemy's worst efforts, and a whole world of
  love, which could only live for him she loved. It was not till they were
  locked within the dungeon again, that Quintus observed that Cornelia was
  wounded; blood was flowing from her left arm&mdash;the brute's claws must
  have touched her there. His feelings as he perceived this were beyond words;
  and then&mdash;when she refused, almost an^y, to let him stanch the blood,
  and at last tore a strip off the hem of her dress, and tied it up just
  "anyhow!" Her whole manner asked with gloomy scorn: "What is the good?" They
  knew, both of them, full well, what the next day must bring forth.</p>

  <p>The minutes dragged along with leaden slowness. The young man's excited
  brain had lost all power to banish the most hideous thoughts; he could
  scarcely pray. He saw himself standing once more in the arena with Cornelia
  at his side, repeating the scene they had just rehearsed&mdash;till the end.
  This time he struck with less skill and success; the roaring beast crouched,
  sprang, he felt its claws in his flesh. He was lying on the earth, bleeding,
  mangled&mdash;yes, it was all true, only he felt no pain, only utter
  exhaustion. And the lion had clutched her too, Cornelia&mdash;beautiful,
  stately.&mdash;Then the monster was scared off from his bleeding prey, back
  into his cage. The servant was coming towards him with the harpoon&mdash;he
  could hear it crunching in the sand.</p>

  <p>He started up, shuddering violently. It was a hideous dream; he had fallen
  asleep after so long being restless. But the crunching and grinding did not
  cease, and now he heard his name called in an eager, loving human voice. The
  grey gloom was bright with the glare of torches. Before him stood Caius
  Aurelius, with eight soldiers of the northern army.</p>

  <p>"Quintus!" he cried, with open arms. "The gods be praised! Rise, noble
  Cornelia. Why do you gaze at me, as if you saw a ghost? I am Aurelius. I have
  brought you freedom."</p>

  <p>"Caius?" stammered Quintus, almost speechless with surprise and new-born
  hopes. "You here&mdash;tell me, what has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Rome is ours. More than half the Praetorian Guard have sworn fidelity to
  Cocceius Nerva. The Palatium was invested an hour ago. You shall hear it all,
  but oh! my senses are reeling...! Forward, men^ make way.&mdash;Oh, Quintus!
  who could have foreseen all this, only last autumn...?"</p>

  <p>Quintus, tottering like a drunken man, went up the steps into the^ sweet
  night air, and Cornelia followed, half carried by their preserver; but when
  she presently drew herself up and walked on in the torch-light, her black
  hair all loose and gently stirred by the wind, her dress torn and stained,
  and so stately in spite of it all, her presence touched the heart even of her
  rough guards.</p>

  <p>In the Forum they found a tremendous uproar. A strong division of the
  troops guarded every entrance to the Palatium; others, and among them many of
  the Praetorian Guard, were being sent to various parts of the city, to defend
  the most important strategic points against any plans of their opponents; at
  the same time the mob came streaming in from every quarter, shouting,
  shrieking and wasting its breath in questions.</p>

  <p>Close by the Arch of Titus, Clodianus sat on horseback in the midst of a
  madly-excited crowd.</p>

  <p>"Yes, citizens," he shouted in stentorian tones, "the tyrant reigns no
  more. Too long indeed have we endured the humiliating yoke, but now we have
  shaken it off. Those, who have acted for you, are grateful to you for your
  unanimous and noble enthusiasm, and Nerva <i>Imperator</i> will show his
  thankfulness by doubling the gifts of corn for the next year."</p>

  <p>"Long live Nerva, the father of his country!" they shouted in chorus. But
  it was not only the capricious proletariat, who joined in; more eager and
  joyful still were the better classes of the citizens, even up to the knights
  and the few senators who, in their uncertainty as to the issue, found courage
  enough to express their opinion.</p>

  <p>"Romans!" Clodianus went on. "Never fear, that the handful of mercenaries,
  who defend the Palatium, can imperil our work this day. The legions of the
  Propraetor of Lugdunensis are already on their way hither, by forced marches
  from Clusium. Before the sun has twice set, they will be before the walls of
  Rome. Go and tell all your friends, who still hesitate, that he himself will
  march in with the Propraetor; Nerva, the choice of the people, the divine
  Emperor."</p>

  <p>"Long live Nerva! long live Clodianus!" shouted a hundred voices at
  once.</p>

  <p>It was with great difficulty, that Aurelius could make a way for the
  released couple through the dense throng.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?" asked Quintus, who had scarcely been able to speak a
  word.</p>

  <p>"To your father's house."</p>

  <p>"Miserable man!" groaned Quintus, bending his face on to his friend's
  shoulder. "What must he not have suffered?"</p>

  <p>And thus they made their way slowly, like a funeral procession, to the
  house of Titus Claudius.</p>

  <p>In the Palatium too there was stir and turmoil&mdash; torches, the clatter
  of arms and confused shouts. At the receipt of the news of the blockade,
  Domitian had almost lost his wits. He sobbed like a woman; he started from
  his bed shrieking and lamenting, and rushed wildly up and down his room, his
  teeth chattering with terror. When he learnt, that the cohorts which were on
  guard in the palace had remained faithful, and would resist every
  encroachment to the death, he recovered himself a little, and called his
  palace officials together for a sort of council of war. For an hour at least
  he listened to their opinions, but rejected almost everything that was
  proposed, as impracticable or useless, and at last, in great wrath, dissolved
  the sitting. Then he himself went the rounds of all the posts, and
  condescended so far as to overwhelm, not the centurions only, but even the
  private soldiers with flattering appeals, and to implore their steadfast
  adherence; besides this, he distributed gifts of money.</p>

  <p>But, in spite of all this, he fancied that the demeanor of the guards was
  less respectful than of yore, and this suspicion filled his mind with
  bitterness and alarm; he swore to himself, that when once the rebellion was
  quelled some, who had especially roused his ire, should be made an example
  of. He was still ignorant, that the larger half of the Praetorian Guard had
  gone over to the enemy. Besides, he was expecting the Propraetor of Gallia
  Lugdunensis who, alone, would be strong enough to turn the balance, and who
  would no doubt hurry on to Rome with double speed, when the news of the
  events in the capital should meet him. In his utter bewilderment it did not
  occur to Caesar, that it was Clodianus who had been in treaty with the
  Propraetor, and that Clodianus was at the head of the revolution.</p>

  <p>When noon had come and passed, and still the Praetorians had not raised
  the siege by expelling the forces under Clodianus, Domitian once more lost
  all self-control. He rushed from room to room in utter despair, now breaking
  out into abuse of Clodianus and Parthenius, both of whom he had raised to
  rank and power; now tearing his hair, now trying to extract some comfort from
  those about him&mdash;particularly from his favorite Jewish slave Phaeton,
  whom he commanded to sing and talk to him and scare away anxious fears.</p>

  <p>Stephanus, who, with Caesar, was blockaded into the Palatium, was not less
  agitated than his sovereign; all night through he had sat in his study,
  devising and rejecting schemes for obeying his mistress' behests. Clodianus
  had indeed made him a party to the conspiracy, and had even intended&mdash;as
  he declared&mdash;that he should play an important part in it. Nevertheless,
  the freedman could not but confess to himself, that the action of the piece
  had begun while he was still behind the scenes; that he had had no idea of
  the extent of the preparations already made, and that events were fast
  getting beyond his ken.</p>

  <p>Nothing had surprised him more than the fact, that Clodianus' intrigues in
  the capital were in connection with the efforts of Cinna and Nerva, and this
  discovery almost overwhelmed him. If the rebellion were to succeed&mdash;as
  seemed most likely&mdash;Cneius Afranius was one of the heroes of the
  situation, and a full disclosure .of all the crimes which Stephanus had,
  until now, so successfully concealed, was a mere question of time. After all
  that the Gaulish lawyer had attempted up to the present date, it seemed more
  than doubtful whether he would pay any heed to the appeal of a moon-struck
  enthusiast like Eurymachus, even supposing that Stephanus could carry into
  effect any scheme in favor of Quintus Claudius. Come what might, one thing
  was certain: in the new order of things, the steward of the deposed Empress
  must fall from his high estate, unless he could prove his connection with the
  conspiracy by some conspicuous service, and so secure beforehand the
  gratitude of the future sovereign.</p>

  <p>By degrees a resolution took form in his terror-stricken mind, which had
  already suggested itself to him several times, though on other
  grounds&mdash;the resolution to murder Domitian.</p>

  <p>The Empress' lust of power and then his fears of the prosecution under a
  law, which Caesar might be planning&mdash;a fable invented by
  Clodianus&mdash;had some time since prompted the idea, which he had always
  set aside because Caesar's excessive suspiciousness had made it seem
  impracticable. Now, however, opportunity was more favorable. The
  extraordinary events of the day made an extraordinary step less startling.
  Besides, he had, as he thought, no choice.</p>

  <p>Soon after sunrise a vague report spread through the Palatium that, late
  the night before, Stephanus had detected a suspicious-looking personage
  wandering about in a strange way, at no great distance from the Caesar's
  residence, that he had collared the man and snatched from him an important
  document, relating to the conspiracy; in the struggle the stranger had given
  him a somewhat deep wound in the left arm.</p>

  <p>In point of fact Stephanus, when he came out of his office in the morning,
  had his arm in a sling,<a href="#170">170</a> and to judge from the blood
  which had stained through the linen, though the bandages were thick, the
  wound must have been a serious one. Anyone, however, who could have watched
  the steward an hour before in the solitude of his chamber, would have seen
  him scratch his skin with his sharp dagger, carefully spot the bandages with
  blood, and then bind the poniard itself dose to his arm like a splint, with
  strips and folds of linen. At the third hour Stephanus craved the favor of an
  audience of Caesar, as he desired to show him a highly-important letter,
  which was intended to meet no eyes but those of the sovereign. Domitian had
  already heard of the steward's misadventure, and he had been on the point of
  commanding his presence, when his petition was laid before him.</p>

  <p>Stephanus came in, pale and excited; any one might suppose he was
  exhausted by loss of blood.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he began, "a discovery of the greatest consequence..."
  Domitian, terrified beyond measure, sent all the slaves, with the exception
  of Phaeton, out of the room and bid Stephanus come closer to him. With
  profound respect the freedman handed him a document, which he himself had
  concocted a few hours previously.</p>

  <p>Caesar turned pale, and hastily glanced through the craftily-composed
  letter.</p>

  <p>This was the instant of which Stephanus took advantage.<a href=
  "#171">171</a> He drew out the dagger like a flash of lightning, and struck
  it to the hilt into Caesar's stomach. Domitian gave a fearful scream, and
  threw himself on the assassin like a wild beast.</p>

  <p>"My sword!" he shouted. "Phaeton, my sword!"</p>

  <p>The boy flew into the next room to fetch it, while Domitian and Stephanus
  struggled desperately. The Emperor tried to wrench the dagger from his foe,
  but only succeeded in clutching the blade and cutting his fingers to the
  bone. With a roar of pain, he tried to force out his adversary's eyes, or to
  set his teeth in his throat. The slaves rushed in, but dared not interfere.
  They thought that Stephanus might be acting under the orders of Clodianus;
  Phaeton alone, who had found the sword, rushed boldly at the victorious
  assassin, and dealt him a deadly blow, at the very instant when Stephanus
  stabbed the Emperor to the heart.</p>

  <p>"Phaeton!... too late<a href="#172">172</a>...!" cried Domitian as he
  fell. "You alone have been faithful..." A dark stream of blood gushed from
  his mouth, and Caesar, who for so many years had trampled the world
  underfoot, was dead.</p>

  <p>Stephanus did not survive him many minutes. Phaeton's stroke had split his
  skull.</p>

  <p>Domitian's death left the Praetorian Guard no reason for resisting the
  revolution; as soon as the news was known, Clodianus sent an envoy to the
  Palatium, who came to an understanding with the tribunes and centurions, and
  they surrendered at once. The rest of the Guard, outside the Palatium, then
  made no farther demur. Thus the victory of Marcus Cocceius Nerva was an
  accomplished fact, and, excepting for the two victims of the struggle within
  the palace, it had been a bloodless one.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, Clodianus at once summoned the
  Senate to a sitting. The very men, who had hitherto grovelled in the dust
  before the despot, now vied with each other in their expressions of hatred
  and contempt for the dead.<a href="#173">173</a> After the election of Marcus
  Cocceius Nerva had been officially ratified, and proclaimed in high-sounding
  phrases to be the happiest event of the century, the assembly passed a
  resolution declaring Domitian to have been a foe and traitor to his country,
  and requiring the Roman people to deface and obliterate every memorial of a
  man accursed. The numerous statues of himself, that Domitian had erected,
  were to be thrown down from their pedestals, and his triumphal arches laid
  level with the ground.<a href="#174">174</a> Certain petty and undignified
  suggestions, which had for their object extended powers of
  denunciation<a href="#175">175</a> such as they had existed under Domitian,
  but with increased severity, and the impeachment of some men of the highest
  character&mdash;as for instance of Titus Claudius&mdash;as adherents of the
  late emperor, were promptly negatived at an unmistakable sign from Clodianus,
  who had been expressly informed by Caius Aurelius, that the new ruler would
  set his face most positively against all the base expedients of the old
  government. On the other hand, the Senate were given full powers to provide
  for the liberation of all prisoners of state, inclusive even of the
  Nazarenes,<a href="#176">176</a> since the decree relating to that Jewish
  sect was to be reconsidered immediately after the Emperor's arrival. In this
  also Clodianus was acting under the direct guidance of Caius Aurelius, who,
  after returning from the house of Titus Claudius, never quitted his side.</p>

  <p>So little were social peace and order disturbed by this revolution in the
  history of the world, that after mid-day the games and combats in the Flavian
  amphitheatre were proceeded with, though it is true they were attended by
  scarcely any but the lowest class, to whom it was a matter of indifference
  whether a god or a demon sat on the throne, so long as they had their
  largesse of corn and their circus games. A few of them complained even that,
  by releasing the Nazarenes, the new Emperor had abridged the programme. But
  when at the close Clodianus indemnified each by a present in money, the last
  dissentient voices were silenced and "Long live Nerva!" rang loudly through
  the Amphitheatre, where two days since Domitian had been no less loudly
  greeted with shouts of "Ave Caesar!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap21"
     id="chap21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p>"Titus Claudius is dying!" the slaves whispered to each other in the
  silent and deserted rooms, where notwithstanding the dignity and gravity of
  the master, so much gay laughter had once been heard, so much young life had
  once been busy and gay.</p>

  <p>"He is dying!" Octavia sighed, as she gazed in despair on the pale,
  altered face lying on the pillow, bathed in cold sweat, and with eyes half
  closed.</p>

  <p>Behind that high, pale forehead dreadful havoc had been made during the
  last few days. All the tortures of martyrdom, to which the barbarous law
  condemned the son, the father had suffered a thousand-fold. In the delirium
  of fever, again and again he was dragged out to the hideous scene, where his
  boy was to be butchered and mangled; the merciful cloud which, at first, had
  darkened his consciousness by degrees had lifted, only to add to his
  sufferings, and his fancy ran riot in sights and images which threatened his
  life. Octavia and Claudia had watched by his bed with infinite patience,
  forced to control their own grief and look on, stricken and inconsolable,
  while the unhappy man wrestled day and night with the demons that possessed
  his mind, and poured out furious curses on himself and his fate.</p>

  <p>Now, after the storm, he had sunk into the calm of lethargy. His strength
  was visibly sinking, and the leeches turned away in helpless silence.</p>

  <p>"He is dying!" was sorrowfully repeated in the remotest rooms of the
  house; for not the lowest of his slaves was so dull or so base, as not to
  mourn for so revered a master from the bottom of his heart. But he is sitting
  up, he is speaking&mdash;listen.</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;you will forgive me," he murmurs hardly audibly. "You will,
  Quintus? You will not curse me? I have always loved you&mdash;oh! loved you
  more than my life! That dreadful decree! Woe, woe is me! he turns away! A
  murderer, he calls me a murderer!" And he sank back on his pillows, gasping
  for breath; his hands clutched convulsively at the quilt.</p>

  <p>"Quintus," he began again, softly, coaxingly&mdash;like a child. "Say one
  kind word to me. Oh! Quintus, can you for a moment imagine, that I am your
  enemy! This hand has so often stroked your cheek, smoothed your hair, your
  beautiful, long, waving hair! Ah! the beasts&mdash;the horrible wild beasts!
  Caesar, this is a hideous crime; mercy, pardon! Let me go down to them, let
  me die, but spare his youth! in vain, in vain&mdash;they have rushed upon
  him, they have seized him&mdash;ye gods! ye gods! have pity on me!"</p>

  <p>A hoarse, dull scream, and then total silence.</p>

  <p>"Father, Father, do you not know me?" said a trembling voice. "It is I,
  your son&mdash;I myself; not a delusion, not a dream.&mdash;And here is
  Cornelia&mdash;and "here is Caius Aurelius, who has snatched us from the jaws
  of death."</p>

  <p>Titus Claudius started up at the sound of this voice. He fixed his glassy
  gaze on the figure of the young man, who was kneeling by his side and
  covering his wasted hands with tears and kisses. Then, suddenly a light
  passed into his face, a shiver thrilled through his enfeebled frame, and with
  a joyful cry of "Quintus! my son!" he fell back senseless. There he lay,
  motionless as the dead. His face grew paler and paler, and his arms hung
  helplessly by the side of the couch. The by-standers were paralyzed with
  dismay; only Claudia had enough presence of mind to fly out of the room and
  call, for assistance. In two minutes she brought back old Palaemon<a href=
  "#177">177</a> a freedman of the household, who was versed in all the
  mysteries of Greek and Roman medicine. He came up to the couch with a look of
  the deepest grief, and laid his hand on the unconscious man*s forehead,
  feeling at the same time his scarcely fluttering pulse. Claudia, always brave
  and calm, told him of what had happened.</p>

  <p>"Give him quiet," said Palaemon, waving them all back with his hand. "This
  moment is decisive."</p>

  <p>The family left the room; O eta via herself in an almost fainting state.
  Leaning on Aurelius, she went to her own apartments. Claudia only, with
  Baucis, remained with the leech to watch the sick man.</p>

  <p>Palaemon forced a few drops of Samian wine,<a href="#178">178</a> between
  the sufferer's livid lips, and then seating himself on a chair at the foot of
  the bed, he kept his eyes fixed on the senseless form.</p>

  <p>"Courage, my child!"<a href="#179">179</a> he said, as he caught sight of
  Claudia's tearful face. "He knew him, and that is everything. That will be
  better medicine, than all the herbs and decoctions known to our art. See, he
  is already breathing more quietly and regularly&mdash;that is not a swoon, it
  is sleep. If he does not sink from mere weakness, this sleep will check the
  violence of the fever and save his life. Open the door, daughter; quite wide,
  that the fresh spring air may come in. Baucis, do you go and fill a bowl with
  snow-water and wet a handkerchief&mdash;I will lay it on his forehead, and
  that will cool him. But make no noise, not a sound&mdash;lest you should wake
  him."</p>

  <p>A delightful breath of roses was wafted into the room, as Claudia softly
  opened the door, and in a few minutes Baucis had brought the cold water. The
  cooling application evidently had a soothing effect on the sleeping man. He
  sighed deeply and turned on his side; his features relaxed, and he slept
  soundly and easily.</p>

  <p>Presently, outside in the colonnade, appeared Caius Aurelius; he glanced
  into the sick-room, asking for a report. Claudia rose and went to meet him,
  smiling through her tears; regardless of Palaemon's presence, she threw her
  arms round her lover and laid her head on his shoulder with a deep sigh of
  relief. "He will live," she whispered, looking up in his face; "only look how
  quietly and peacefully he is sleeping."</p>

  <p>"Jupiter be praised! Oh! my darling, what have we not gone through those
  last few months!"</p>

  <p>"More than we could have borne, if it had not been for our love."</p>

  <p>He kissed her, looked once more at the sick man, and left her.</p>

  <p>The sun sank behind Mons Janiculus, and the worn-out Flamen still lay in
  his death-like sleep. About two hours before midnight he moved and asked for
  Quintus. Claudia, who had not quitted him, bent over him and said gently:</p>

  <p>"He is safe, Father, you know," and her father looked up at her with a
  beatific smile. Then he asked for something to drink, greedily emptied a cup
  of water with fruit syrup, and at once fell asleep again. When day began to
  break, Palaemon, who had taken some hours' rest in the adjoining room, sent
  Claudia to lie down. In all human probability the danger was now over, and
  Claudia obeyed, for she could scarcely hold up her head.</p>

  <p>The sun rose in a cloudless sky&mdash;the first day of freedom in redeemed
  and regenerate Rome. The people set to work on all hands, to prepare a worthy
  welcome for the new Emperor, the gentle and high-souled Nerva, who was
  expected to arrive the following morning. Every arch of triumph, every
  colonnade, every temple was decked with garlands. Rome was like one vast
  festal hall. The Praetorian Guard and the soldiers of the city-garrison
  marched in noisy troops through the streets, to overturn the statues of
  Domitian and to set up hastily- modelled images of Nerva in their stead.</p>

  <p>But all the tumult and noise failed to wake Titus Claudius Mucianus, who
  lay sleeping and gaining strength every hour on the couch in his airy
  cubiculum. It was not till late in the afternoon, that he began to grow
  restless and to toss from side to side. Palaemon called the family, and they
  assembled in the room: Octavia, Claudia, Lucilia, Cornelia, Quintus and Caius
  Aurelius, who, now that the great political revolution was accomplished, felt
  himself quite free and had flown at an early hour to see his Claudia. But
  with them there also came, to the great surprise of the worthy Baucis, a
  stranger, a knight from Rodumna, who to this day had never before crossed the
  Flamen's threshold; our esteemed friend Cneius Afranius, the advocate.
  Lucilia's eyes, which in the midst of her anxiety sparkled with an
  anticipation of imminent happiness, whenever they met those of the man she
  loved, might have explained to the old nurse, that the unexpected guest had
  not come altogether unbidden&mdash;nay, that something must have passed
  between the two young people, which was of the deepest interest to Afranius
  himself, as well as to the girl who&mdash;once so saucy&mdash;now looked up
  at him with an air of maidenly reserve. Cneius Afranius remained modestly in
  the background, as if he was quite satisfied for the present to leave the old
  slave-woman's doubts unsettled.</p>

  <p>Palaemon met them with the smile, that gives new life to the relations of
  a sick man.</p>

  <p>"Only go very gently," he said, as Lucilia and Quintus began to question
  him.</p>

  <p>Presently they heard a deep sigh from Titus Claudius, who was sitting up
  in bed, and gazing at the assembled family with wide and eager eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is you!" he said, trembling with excitement. "You, Quintus, my son, my
  adored son."</p>

  <p>"Father!" was all Quintus could say, and he fell sobbing aloud into those
  trembling, wasted arms.</p>

  <p>"Was it delirium?" asked the high-priest, "or is it true? Was it you,
  Caius Aurelius, who saved my son?"</p>

  <p>"As you say, my lord," replied the Batavian.</p>

  <p>"How did you^do it? Did you procure his pardon? Did you succeed, when we
  had all failed, in touching Caesar's heart?"</p>

  <p>"Domitian is dead," said the Batavian, solemnly. "Before his rule was
  wrenched from him, he died by the hand of an assassin. But Nerva, our new
  Emperor, is innocent of blood; he, mild and just, ordered me to strike off
  the chains of the Nazarenes. We hurried at our utmost speed from the shores
  of Gaul to Rome, and the gods willed it, that I should arrive just in time to
  rescue Quintus and the noble Cornelia. The decree, which pronounced them
  guilty, is abrogated."</p>

  <p>The high-priest had listened to him, motionless and silent; Palaemon went
  forward to interrupt the conversation.</p>

  <p>"Not yet, my good friend," said Titus Claudius with a grateful smile. "You
  need fear nothing for me. New life is dancing in every vein. Suspense alone
  was crushing me to death; the truth will restore me to life. Let our young
  friend tell us what has happened. Domitian dead! Nerva Emperor! The Nazarenes
  released...! I feel as if it were all a dream!"</p>

  <p>Aurelius told his tale, and Titus Claudius listened, clinging to his son's
  hands with both his own. The one feeling that he had been preserved from the
  last, worst horror, without having to reproach himself with any breach of his
  duty as a statesman and an official, triumphed over all the other various
  emotions, that Aurelius' narrative might have roused in him. Again and again
  his eye turned to rest on the radiant face of the son he had believed to be
  lost beyond recall, and whom he now saw and held in the flesh. Every other
  consideration was swept away in the current of a father's love, so long held
  in unnatural check.</p>

  <p>"The gods have willed it so!" he said sadly, when Aurelius ceased
  speaking. "I cannot hold the office, conferred on me by Domitian, under* the
  enemy of the murdered Caesar. But I yield to the force of circumstances; what
  till now was treason is now law. I am but a weak mortal; I do not pretend to
  judge the case. I can but marvel and be silent. Justice is perhaps on the
  side of the stronger conviction, the stronger will and the greater
  vigor&mdash;such mysteries can only be solved by the gods. So the first words
  I address to you, after these days of terror and torment, shall be words of
  conciliation. Caius Aurelius, my daughter's heart is yours&mdash;then she
  shall be your wife. I will not destroy your happiness; you have all suffered
  enough on my account."</p>

  <p>But here Palaemon interfered with all the authority of his office. He
  almost pushed Claudia and the Batavian from the bedside.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me!" he said, "but this will not do. He must have perfect rest. I
  only wanted him to see Quintus, that will conduce to his recovery. He will
  shake hands with his worthy son-in-law quite soon enough." The whole party
  left the room.</p>

  <p>"And we?" asked Lucilia, as Afranius came close by her side.</p>

  <p>"Patience, my queen," said the lawyer; "the fruit that has set is sure to
  ripen. Leave him to get well and think quietly over the past; our hour will
  strike in good time."</p>

  <p>Lucilia nodded assent, and Claudia threw her arms round her, and kissed
  her ardently.</p>

  <p>Quintus was the last to quit the room; his father gazed after him with a
  look of rapture. Then, with an upward glance, he sighed deeply, and once more
  closed his eyes. He was quite exhausted, and presently again dropped asleep.
  His excited brain still worked in fresh and vivid dreams, but now they were
  not demons that hovered round him, but kindly ghosts, and his fancy bore him
  through rose-tinted clouds to the sunny regions of freedom and peace.</p>

  <p>Kindly genii, proclaiming freedom and peace, hovered over Rome, the long-
  suffering city. The next day, two hours after sunrise, Marcus Cocceius Nerva
  made his solemn entrance, amid the enthusiastic shouts of the multitude; and
  before the sun had sunk on the second day, he had accomplished that grand
  change, which altered the course of the world's history, and secured to the
  Roman Empire for many years the benefits of justice and liberty. The
  venerable Emperor, in order not to leave his dominions a prey to fresh
  political convulsions in the event of his death, solemnly adopted the
  Hispanian, Ulpius Trajanus, as his son, before the assembled Senate,<a href=
  "#180">180</a> and with the consent of that illustrious body, appointed him
  his successor on the throne of Rome.</p>

  <p>"I know, my beloved son," so the old Emperor addressed him, "that you will
  accept this gift from your venerable father, and this highest of all honors
  at the hands of the Roman Senate and people with a due sense of gratitude.
  You will not be overbearing in the possession of power, any more than you
  were servile when, at any moment, you might have fallen a victim to the
  miscarriage of a noble cause. You will not let yourself be befooled by
  flatterers, for you yourself have never learnt to flatter. You will
  acknowledge, that all your dignity and power emanate from the sovereign will
  of the people; that you rule only because your country bids you rule; that
  you are not called to be the tyrant, but the servant of the State."</p>

  <p>So spoke Nerva, and Trajan bowed his head with a grave conviction of duty,
  and accepted the responsible honor.&mdash;Trajan, that noble, moderate and
  just man,<a href="#181">181</a> whom the verdict of posterity has, with
  singular unanimity, pronounced to be the best of all the emperors of
  Rome.</p>

  <p>At the same hour, when Marcus Cocceius Nerva was returning with Trajan
  from the heights of the Capitol to their residence in the Palatium, two men,
  each solitary and in the plainest dress, were turning their back on the
  Eternal City.</p>

  <p>One of them, Barbillus, the priest of Isis, stole away, carefully
  disguised, to Antium, where he was met by an accomplice, who had in his
  charge all the treasure he had been able to collect in his haste. From thence
  he purposed to reach Alexandria by sea, and so elude the wrath of Cinna, who
  was now all-powerful and Cocceius Nerva's closest friend. But the ship was
  wrecked, and a week later the body of the great magician was cast on shore
  near Messana.</p>

  <p>The other of the two men was Eurymachus, who took the road to Ostia.
  Lycoris, who had given up all luxury and splendor and had had herself
  baptized, had anticipated all that Quintus had intended to do for him; she
  had bought Eurymachus from the heirs of Stephanus, had set him free and had
  provided him amply for a journey to Gaul. This, after all his trials and
  struggles, he set forth with renewed energies, to be the apostle of the
  Nazarene creed in the remotest frontiers of the Empire.</p><br>

    <dd>Nothing is said by the ancient authors concerning such a farce enacted
    by Domitian; but from all we know of the man's character there is no doubt
    that my imagination does him no injustice. With respect to the incident
    itself, similar ones actually happened, and in A.D. 19 Flavius Josephus
    relates that a Roman knight, Decius Mundus, pursued an aristocratic lady
    called Paulina a long time with offers of love, without obtaining a
    hearing. As she was eagerly devoted to the worship of the goddess Isis,
    Decius Mundus, by the offer of 5,000 denarii, induced the priest to tell
    her that the god Anubis (son of Isis and Osiris) desired a nocturnal
    meeting. Paulina believed this, and Decius Mundus appeared in the
    jackal-headed mask of the god. The cheat was successful, but when the
    emperor Tiberius heard of it, he sent the knight into exile, ordered the
    priests to be crucified, the temple levelled to the ground, and the statue
    of the goddess flung into the water.&mdash;By the way, it may be remarked
    that Domitian, before he was emperor, escaped from the besieged Capitol,
    whither he had fled in the war with Vitellius, in the costume of a priest
    of Isis, and remained concealed until his enemy's defeat.</dd>

       PHIDIAS</a></dt>

    <dd>
      The most renowned, and perhaps most magnificent creation of Greek plastic
      art, was the Pan-Hellenic Zeus at Olympia, a work of Phidias. Everything
      the ancient authors tell us of this colossal statue sounds extremely
      enthusiastic. Thus an epigram runs:<br>
      <br>

      <div style="margin-left:3%">
        <i>"Great Zeus did descend to earth his image to reveal,<br>
        Or, Phidias, to behold the god, Olympus thou did'st scale."</i>
      </div><br>
      Dio Chrysostomus writes: "No one who has seen Phidias' Zeus, is capable
      of forming any other image of the god... A man, whose soul is troubled,
      oppressed by the many cares and griefs life offers, so that he would no
      longer be refreshed by sweet slumber, must I think, while confronting
      this statue, forget everything that is gloomy and terrible. Thus,
      Phidias, hast thou designed and executed thy work. Such light and grace
      animate thy art." Phidias had created his statue of the god according to
      the image of the Homeric verse, where Zeus grants the entreaty of the
      imploring Thetis:<br>
      <br>

      <div style="margin-left:3%">
        <i>"He spoke, and awful bends his sable brows,<br>
        Shakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod.<br>
        The stamp of fate and sanction of the god:<br>
        High heaven with trembling the dread signal took<br>
        And all Olympus to the centre shook."</i>&mdash;POPE.
      </div><br>
      Phidias' Zeus was represented seated on a throne; his left hand held the
      sceptre, his right bore a goddess of victory. Among all the statues of
      Zeus that have been preserved, the bust of Otricoli seems to approach
      most nearly to the ideal of Phidias. There is no absolutely accurate
      copy; but the descriptions given us by the ancient authors, as well as
      two coins from Elis, carefully described by Overbeck and
      Friedl&auml;nder, afford a succession of by no means unimportant
      points.<br>
      The bust in Claudia's boudoir may be imagined a duplicate of Otricoli's
      Jupiter&mdash;only approximating somewhat more closely to the separate
      features of the original.

    <dd>Augustus divided all the provinces of the empire into two classes: the
    imperial and senatorial. The management of the former he undertook himself,
    confiding the latter to the senate. "In one respect, he had selected for
    himself those most difficult to govern, either because the inhabitants were
    not yet at peace, or warlike neighbors threatened an assault: the senate,
    on the contrary, obtained the peaceful ones. Thus the matter looked as if
    he had granted the senate the best and most lucrative, undertaking all care
    and peril himself; but in reality, he made the Senate defenceless,
    retaining the army for his own exclusive use. Only one senatorial province
    (Africa) obtained one, and afterwards two legions. The governors of the
    senatorial provinces were divided into two classes. Africa and Asia,
    according to the decision of the senate, obtained ex-consuls. The other
    senatorial provinces were entrusted to Praetors, who also bore the title of
    proconsul. The governors of the imperial provinces, on the contrary, though
    they might also have been consuls, were called propraetors, to indicate
    that they commanded the army (<i>praeire</i>). These propraetors <i>(legati
    Caesaris pro praet. cons. pot.)</i> were distinguished from the senatorial
    proconsuls in this respect&mdash;that they held office longer than a year,
    in consequence of which the provincials obtained great pecuniary relief."

    moon. An official, in later times the Pontifex Maximus, proclaimed the
    appearance of the new moon from a house (<i>Curia Calabra</i>) specially
    built for the purpose on the Capitoline Hill. The days of the second half
    of the month were reckoned in such a manner that they were mentioned as
    before the calends of the following month; for instance, the 24th of March
    was the 9th day before the calends of April. The day from which, and the

    <dd>"We are most amazed"&mdash;says Friedl&auml;nder&mdash;"at the number
    of animals of one species, as well as the whole number of those belonging
    to different species, gathered at the great Roman spectacles. These numbers
    sound incredible; of course It must not be forgotten, that within two
    thousand years the species of the large animals have sustained a vast,
    scarcely computable diminution. Doubtless Dio's remark, that all such
    numbers are exaggerated, is correct; but even after great reductions, nay,
    even if cut down one half, they remain enormous. The spectacles exhibited
    by Pompey and Caesar, are not only unsurpassed, but unequalled in this
    respect. In the former 17 or 18 elephants, 500 or 600 lions, and 410 other
    African animals were displayed; in the latter 400 lions and 40 elephants.
    Among the historians of the empire, the statement is by no means rare that
    100, 200 and even 300 lions, 300, 400 and 500 bears, an equal number of
    African wild beasts (and still larger numbers of the ordinary kinds of
    animals) were exhibited or hunted at a single spectacle. All the Zoological
    gardens in Europe at the present day could be abundantly supplied with the
    animals gathered in Rome for a single great festival. According to Augustus
    own statement&mdash;he took great pleasure in 'vast numbers of animals and
    unfamiliar wild beasts'&mdash;3,500 African animals alone perished in the
    26 spectacles he gave. At the hundred-day festival given by Titus in the
    year 80 to commemorate the opening of the Flavian amphitheatre, 5,000 wild
    beasts of all kinds were exhibited in a single day, and the whole number of

    If the crime was discovered, Domitian's government treated the culprit more

    each instance. The vestals Ocellata and Varonilla were granted the choice
    of the manner of death, but their betrayers were exiled. In later times,
    however, Domitian ordered the vestal Cornelia to be buried alive, and her
    lovers&mdash;for she had several&mdash;to be flogged to death in the
    comitium. In contradiction to this is the (perhaps incorrect) remark of Dio
    Cassius (LXVII, 3) according to which Domitian, to his credit, ordered that
    vestal virgins convicted of breaking their vows, should not be buried

    was also in general use when persons met or took leave of each other.</dd>

       id="156">156. THE CONSUL FLAVIUS CLEMENS AND HIS NOBLE WIFE</a></dt>

    <dd>The wife of the consul Flavius Clemens was a relative of Domitian.
    According to Dio Cassius (LXVII, 14) she was called Flavia Domitilla.
    According to this historian, she was not condemned to the wild beasts, but
    only to exile at Pandataria. How near Flavius Clemens originally stood to
    the emperor's person, appears from the narrative of Suetonius (<i>Dom.</i>
    15), where it is said, that the emperor publicly designated the two sons of
    his cousin Flavius Clemens, then little boys, to be his successors, and
    therefore gave one the name of Vespasianus and the other that of
    Domitianus, in place of the one hitherto borne. Besides, according to
    Suetonius, the Christianity of Flavius Clemens is not so clearly shown as
    my story supposes. See also Note 137, Vol. I, and Note 131, Vol. II.</dd>

    <dt><a name="157"
       id="157">157. CAESAR ANGRILY SHOOK HIS HEAD</a></dt>

    <dd>Usually the emperors had endeavored to heed the publicly-expressed
    wishes of the people. Only Domitian and a few others were an exception.
    Thus Suetonius (<i>Dom.</i> 13) states that Domitian, when the audience at
    the combats in honor of the Capitoline Jupiter, asked for the reinstatement
    of Palfurius Sura, who had been expelled from the senate and now crowned as
    orator, did not even vouchsafe an answer, but through the mouth of the
    herald unceremoniously ordered silence. The compliance with the demands of
    the audience at the circus, who required the recall of the empress,
    described in this story (Note 148, Vol. I.) does not contradict this trait
    of character, for there the emperor was bound by an express promise.</dd>

    <dd>Dio Cassius, LXVII, 8, gives us a striking example of such violence
    towards the spectators at public games. A terrible storm arose during a
    brilliant performance in the circus. The wind howled, the rain poured in
    torrents, but no one ventured to leave the place, even for the short time
    necessary to get a cloak. The emperor himself, on the contrary, constantly
    changed his upper garment. "Many" writes Dio Cassius, "took cold and
    died."</dd>

    imperial governor in Upper Germany.</dd>

    <dt><a name="181"
       id="181">181. TRAJAN, THAT NOBLE, MODERATE AND JUST MAN</a></dt>

    <dd>See Dio Cass. LXVIII, 5: "His character had not the slightest trace of
    falsity, malice or cruelty; he loved good citizens, treated them with
    respect and distinguished them: about the bad ones he did not
    ask."&mdash;LXVIII, 6: "He was eminent for his love of justice, courage,
    and simplicity of manners He envied no one, barred no one's path to fame;
    he rather honored and exalted all merit. Hence he had no cause to fear any
    man. Slanderers he did not trust. He neither meddled with the property of
    others, nor allowed the innocent to be put to death&mdash;"LXVlII, 16:
    "When he gave the sword to the commander of the Praetorian Guard, he drew
    it from the sheath and held it up, saying: 'Take this sword and use it, if
    I reign well, for me, if I reign ill, against me.'" Even the eulogy of the
    younger Pliny, who was a friend of the new emperor, spite of many
    exaggerated expressions, shows that it is the utterance of sincere
    conviction; certain facts especially speak for themselves; for instance the
    total change in the ceremonies of the court. "Formerly"&mdash;so says
    Pliny&mdash;"the imperial palace was a fortress; under Nerva and Trajan it
    has become a public building. There are no bolts, no degrees of
    humiliation, and when a thousand thresholds have been crossed, we do not
    constantly encounter fresh forms and obstacles. We do not come to Trajan,
    as was the case with former emperors, in confusion and haste, that we may
    not endanger our lives by delay, but with a feeling of security, gladly,
    and just as it suits our convenience. If some pressing business detains us,
    Trajan does not even require a word of apology. When we have saluted him,
    we do not rush hurriedly away. We linger, stroll comfortably about, as if
    the palace belonged to us&mdash;the very palace which but a short time ago
    that abandoned monster (Domitian) surrounded with so many horrors; the very
    palace where the wild-beast shut himself up as if in a den, sometimes
    drinking the blood of his nearest relatives, sometimes rushing out to slay
    the noblest citizens... But vengeance burst the wall of his guards and
    pressed victoriously through the locked doors... How much safer and more
    free from anxiety is this palace, now that it is not protected by the
    guards of tyranny, but of love, not protected by seclusion and bolts, but
    by the citizens passing in and out. You have shown us by experience, that a
    prince's virtue is his best defence." Pliny, <i>Paneg.</i> 65: "Trajan
    convinced us that the sovereign is not above the law&mdash;but the law
    above the sovereign," Pliny <i>Paneg.</i> 67, and "Usually we have taken
    vows of fealty simply for the emperor's welfare; but the expressions in
    which we have sworn faith to our present government deserve to be
    emphasized&mdash;if you will rule the state wisely and for the good of
    all...that is you will only be preserved by the gods, on the condition that
    you rule the state wisely and for the welfare of all."</dd>
