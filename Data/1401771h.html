  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">HIS question so upset me I put down my drink untasted.</p>

  <p>Albert was like that. Upsetting. Years ago I had gone to school with
  Albert. He had been upsetting then&mdash;a sort of experimental liar
  indefatigable in his efforts to plumb the depths of human credulity. Fifteen
  years in the discard that had been. Now fate had returned Albert&mdash;Albert
  Green&mdash;to my side. In a little bar in a little town in the large state
  of Texas we had been celebrating all morning. I now wonder why. In his
  charmingly casual manner Albert had just inquired if I cared to go fox
  hunting. He had added modestly that he lived in this state of Texas together
  with a population composed almost entirely of foxes. The first part of this
  statement might just possibly be true. I'm inclined to believe it is. He
  seemed to be living in Texas. It would take a big, strong state like Texas to
  stand for Albert. He would have upset any normal state just as he upset me.
  At the moment he was more interested in upsetting a lot of foxes.</p>

  <p>I asked him a frank question. "Albert," I asked him, "do I bear on my face
  the stamp of a man consumed with a secret passion for foxes?"</p>

  <p>"Don't have to be passionate about foxes, just to hunt 'em," he replied.
  "In fact, you can hate foxes."</p>

  <p>I stopped to consider exactly where I stood about foxes. It surprised me
  to discover that I had no strong feelings either for or against foxes. Years
  ago I had heard something about a fox mentioned in connection with a bunch of
  grapes. Since that time, however, foxes had gone their way and I had gone
  mine. Our paths never crossed. I saw no reason why they should.</p>

  <p>"We'll waive that part of it," I said with befitting dignity. "What do you
  know about fox-hunting anyway?"</p>

  <p>Albert indulged in a tragic laugh. "Every possible thing," he asserted.
  "Own the finest pack of hounds in Texas. You'd think they were on tracks the
  way they follow foxes. Wonderful dogs. And Henry! What a hound. Man! Man! Ho,
  I know all about foxes. Recognize one at a glance."</p>

  <p>"To recognize a fox is one thing," I told him, "but to chase him over the
  landscape is an elk of another burrow."</p>

  <p>"Come on down to my place and I'll show you," urged Albert. "We'll do more
  than just hunt foxes. Henry'll juggle some for you. It's his way."</p>

  <p>Precocious dogs, like precocious children had always been one of my pet
  aversions, but the picture of a noble hound juggling a number of foxes fired
  my imagination. I accepted Albert's invitation, which goes to prove that one
  should never talk with Albert in a barroom.</p>

  <p>On further consideration I am inclined to believe one should never talk
  with Albert at all.</p><br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">After sleeping through numerous miles of Texas scenery while
  Albert sat alone with his God and his automobile, I found myself gazing
  miserably into the grim but good looking face of Mrs. Albert across the
  sparkling reaches of her luncheon table.</p>

  <p>"The trouble with you boys," she said, "is that you don't drink
  enough."</p>

  <p>Suiting her action to her words she replenished our glasses with what she
  was pleased to call real Texas mule, adding that it was something like hair
  of the dog that had so brutally and recently mutilated us.</p>

  <p>"My dear," remarked Albert, accepting the drink, but ignoring the remark
  that went with it. "I've decided to hold the fox hunt tomorrow&mdash;you
  know, the regular weekly fox hunt."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I added. "He wants to show me Henry in action. I can see him now at
  the head of your splendid pack of hounds."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Albert considered the suggestion. She poured out a drink for herself
  and tossed it off with professional detachment.</p>

  <p>"Can you?" she asked in level tones. "You must have a remarkable
  imagination. Most northerners would not even believe it."</p>

  <p>"My wife is a little touchy about Henry," Albert hastened to explain. "I
  brag so much about him. Might as well hold the hunt tomorrow at the usual
  time."</p>

  <p>"Oh certainly," replied Mrs. Albert. "Why not?" As she rose from the table
  she added, "Did I hear a door slam?"</p>

  <p>"That's difficult to say," said Albert.</p>

  <p>"Correct. It's almost impossible to tell whether a door has slammed or not
  after it's once slammed." Mrs. Albert continued thoughtfully. "It leaves no
  tracks behind."</p>

  <p>"Not like Henry," I said to Albert. "He must fairly scoop up the earth
  when he once gets started."</p>

  <p>I though I saw Albert flinch. "Of course," he agreed quite seriously.
  "Fairly excavates it, that dog."</p>

  <p>"Come, Albert," said his wife. "We must see about that door...and make
  some arrangements for tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"May I stroll out and take a look at the pack?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"I'd hardly advise it," observed Albert. "Not just before the hunt."</p>

  <p>"No, don't do that," put in his wife. "Henry does much better after he's
  been lonely a spell."</p>

  <p>Later that afternoon I inadvertently overheard Mrs. Albert at the
  telephone.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she was saying. "Bring your guests right along. We have an
  alcoholic with us who doesn't know the first thing about fox-hunting. Doubt
  if he knows one end of a horse from the other." She must have suspected my
  presence for she went on in an altered voice, "Oh, yes, he's quite charming,
  this guest of ours. You must meet him. And tell the others not to dress
  formally, you know. Cut out the red coats for a change. He hasn't an outfit
  with him. Neither have your guests, I reckon." When she had hung up she
  turned to me.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No I replied gallantly. "A door slammed. But I gathered I won't be alone
  in my misery."</p>

  <p>"No," said Mrs. Albert. "There will be several other novices."</p>

  <p>That night Albert, weak from the lack of liquor, came in to my room and
  deposited a bundle of clothing on a chair.</p>

  <p>"For tomorrow," he explained, eyeing the garments with disfavor. "The
  hunt, you know."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't care what I look like," I assured the dispirited man. "What
  I'm interested in is what Henry looks like. Does he usually juggle the foxes
  before or after the hunt?"</p>

  <p>"It makes no difference to Henry," said Albert brightening. "Whenever he
  gets a fox. Some call it brutal."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," I replied heartily.</p>

  <p>Albert went away.</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">When I looked out of my window the next morning I received a
  decided shock. For a moment I feared that Albert had gotten himself in some
  trouble. His ancestral home seemed to have become entirely surrounded either
  by bandits or deputies. I was not sure which. Anyway, they were rough looking
  men, most of them carrying shot guns and rifles while others were swinging
  large, ugly looking clubs. There were many women also. They had the rough and
  ready appearance of experienced camp followers.</p>

  <p>"The hunt breakfast," Albert murmured over my shoulder. I gave a slight
  start. He had made his appearance so quietly. "The regular hunt breakfast,"
  he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Why, there's hardly a red coat on the lot," I complained. "Albert, I feel
  cheated."</p>

  <p>"Seldom wear red coats except on formal occasions," said Albert. "Thought
  you knew that."</p>

  <p>"What does it matter?" I said philosophically. "We're chiefly interested
  in foxes, after all."</p>

  <p>"So we are," replied Albert simply. "What's the sense in a lot of red
  coats, anyway? I don't think the dogs like 'em or the foxes either."</p>

  <p>"Don't see why they should," I told him. "But I will ask you this. Do you
  use clubs and rifles and machine guns on your damn Texas foxes?"</p>

  <p>"Not machine guns," said Albert gently. "We use the others for hand to
  hand fighting. Texas foxes are often violent. They don't seem to
  understand."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I, quite," I admitted. "Why don't you bomb the foxes and save
  yourself a lot of trouble?"</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't be sporting," said Albert blandly. "and anyway, we like it.
  Then again, there's Henry to consider. He must have his foxes."</p>

  <p>"That's so, too," I replied. "I guess that great beast would die unless he
  had his foxes."</p>

  <p>"Those clubs and guns are brought along just in case," he informed me.</p>

  <p>"In case of what?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Of wild turkeys," he answered with out cracking a smile.</p>

  <p>When I had finished dressing I was nearly as funny looking as Albert, but
  not quite. However, I was funny looking enough. I was exactly as funny
  looking as an oversized pair of plus fours, a checked flannel shirt, high
  boots and a campaign hat could make me. Albert was a little funnier because
  he was wearing a pair of white duck trousers encased in knee-length leggins.
  His nautical appearance was somewhat nullified by the presence of a large
  floppy straw hat on the back of his head. A corduroy hunting jacket alone
  suggested the general nature of Albert's intentions. There was a colored
  shirt also which I find it pleasanter not to write about.</p>

  <p>"The foxes are going to have the laugh of their lives today," I remarked
  when I had acclimated myself to Albert. "They'll be too weak to run."</p>

  <p>"Come," said Albert with dignity. "The hunt breakfast is on. There is
  drink."</p>

  <p>"Let's abandon this incessant fox hunting," I suggested, "and make
  millions on the stage. We wouldn't have to do much, Albert. One look would
  drive 'em frantic."</p>

  <p>"Later, perhaps," replied Albert a little moodily. "We have to go through
  with this fox hunt first. Come on."</p>

  <p>I was introduced to a series of majors, doctors and judges. All men over
  thirty seemed automatically to come into a title. Whether they were merely
  hunt breakfast titles or not I never learned. There was one rotund colonel,
  authentic in every detail, an upon him was bestowed all the honor and glory
  due to his colorful record of violent and abrupt endings. He was the Colonel.
  Fat was this gentleman, fat, pompous and over-blooded, but a life-loving soul
  withal. In his youth he had been the life of all the local lynching parties,
  and now, in his declining years, he had acquired the reputation of an
  implacable hunter. He was wearing a Prince Albert coat and highly polished
  boots which lent the only touch of distinction to this nondescript
  gathering.</p>

  <p>After being properly introduced to the ladies, all of whom seemed to be
  guarding some shameful secret the full significance of which they failed to
  grasp themselves, I was placed by the side of my hostess, and urged to drink.
  She subjected me to one swift scrutiny, then quickly dropped her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," she said in a strained voice. "I think I heard a door slam."
  The next moment she rose hastily and walked unsteadily toward the house. With
  pained eyes I followed her retreating figure.</p>

  <p>Down the line a lady showing no end of well turned southern legs as she
  sat on the grass was speaking in an excited voice and waiving a cocktail
  glass in the air.</p>

  <p>"What a lark," she proclaimed. "John's never so much as seen a fox and he
  can't stand the sight of horses. They give him a violent rash, do
  horses."</p>

  <p>I turned and regarded my host inquiringly, "Is he one of the initiates
  like myself at this ceremony?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered. "There are several others&mdash;lots of new faces, in
  fact. You won't be alone. Drink up."</p>

  <p>A man on my right leaned confidently over and made helpless, little
  motions with his hands.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," he said incredulously, "but do I understand we are actually
  going fox hunting?"</p>

  <p>I told him that that was about the size of it.</p>

  <p>"Fancy that," he observed musingly. "Of all things, fox hunting. Wonder
  where Mr. Green caught the beast. Haven't seen a fox in years. I'll ask
  him."</p>

  <p>To my great delight he leaned over and made some more motions at
  Albert.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Green," he whispered piercingly. "Where in the world did you get this
  fox?"</p>

  <p>"What fox?" exclaimed Albert in a startled voice, looking quickly about as
  if he feared a fox was creeping up behind him.</p>

  <p>"You know," said the man mysteriously. "This fox we're supposed to
  hunt."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I put in. "The fox Henry's going to juggle with several
  others."</p>

  <p>"Who's Henry?" asked the man innocently.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you know Henry?" I replied with some amazement. "He's the
  greatest foxer in the state of Texas, that dog."</p>

  <p>"Strange," muttered the man. "Don't know him&mdash;but I'm a stranger to
  these parts."</p>

  <p>"We raised many of our foxes in England," Albert explained.</p>

  <p>"And ruin them in Texas," said the stranger.</p>

  <p>Albert's answer was cut short by a sudden shout winging across the lawn
  from the direction of the outhouses. I looked up and saw a negro, running
  with great concentration; coming in our direction. He was leaning so far over
  in his efforts to separate himself from some still unrevealed peril that he
  gave the impression of a six-day bicycle racer. then something happened which
  I am sure must have come upon everybody as a complete surprise to put it
  mildly. Before our astonished eyes the negro was borne down and blotted out
  beneath an onrushing avalanche of dogs. The air was disturbed by eager
  yelpings and churned by innumerable jauntily waiving tails. In another moment
  the hunt breakfast had been reduced to a shambles. One imperishable vision of
  our colonel staunchly defending a chunk of fried chicken was vouchsafed me.
  Then he, too, disappeared, emulating the negro, as the dogs danced giddily
  over his recombent form. After that my impressions became somewhat clouded. I
  remember a large dog neatly removing a sandwich from my fingers and breathing
  appreciatively in my face. Sandwiches seemed to be moving through the air
  like things of life. The once spotless table cloth was leaping weirdly under
  the stress of greedily searching muzzles. Figures of men and women as they
  rolled and struggled on the grass were caught in the most undignified, not to
  say comprimising positions. The element of surprise was all in favor of the
  raiders. The famous hunt breakfast was theirs without a struggle. I remember
  hearing quite distinctly Mrs. albert as if lost to decency, ironically
  cheering the pack on to still greater endeavors. From their utterdisregard of
  all those little niceties of deportment that give life its subtle fragrance I
  decided that it had been many a long day since those dogs had enjoyed a
  square meal.</p>

  <p>Then above the din and the barking, the cries of the insulted and injured
  and&mdash;I regret to say&mdash;the shocking blasphemy of out colonel, my
  host, Albert, who should have been master of this hunt, lifted up his voice
  in command.</p>

  <p>"Grab sticks!" he shouted. "Grab anything and beat them off!"</p>

  <p>Then began a grim struggle, man facing defiant beast, for the honor and
  supremacy of the human race. We fought those dogs bitterly and oftentimes
  unfairly. For example, I saw one gentleman deliberately enticing one of the
  enemy to accept a peace offering of chicken&mdash;a delicious bit it
  looked&mdash;and then when the poor animal had been betrayed by its oen greed
  this man, this southern gentleman, squared off and kicked the dog quite
  severely in the rump. Foot by foot the dogs yeilded and were driven backin
  the direction whence they came. One inspired sportsman accelerated their
  departure by firing off a shotgun. This horrid noise entirely demoralized the
  dogs, all of whom must have been born gun shy. With yelps of nervous alarm
  they sheathed their once valiant tails and deployed in the direction of the
  barn.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Albert was sitting calmly on the grass. Her husband was rushing from
  one guest to another, assuring everyone that everything was all right, and
  begging them not to let this slight interruption mar the pleasure of the
  hunt.</p>

  <p>"Pleasure?" one forthright gentleman&mdash;obviously a
  novice&mdash;demanded indignantly. "How did you get that way? You mean the
  horror of the hunt."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?" Mrs. Albert asked defensively before I had
  opened my lips. "There's nothing unusual about this hunt breakfast. Only last
  week the dogs broke loose and one of the fresh things had the nerve to snatch
  a cocktail right out of my hand. Think of that."</p>

  <p>I did. I looked steadily at Mrs. Albert's innocently turned up face and
  thought of that as well as other things. This made me think of Albert, the
  last person in the world I wanted to think about at that moment.</p><br>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">I was being introduced by Albert to the mount upon which I
  was to pursue foxes for the reminder of the day.</p>

  <p>"This is Molly," he said with Jeffersonian simplicity. "Your horse."</p>

  <p>It had to be my horse because most certainly no one else would have taken
  Molly as a gift. As I studied this disillusioned featuresof this venerable
  wreck I feared that she was going to take advantage of her sex and weep on my
  shoulder. Nevertheless, I mounted to her back and awited with closed eyes the
  inevitable crash. Molly braced herself, quivered along her keel, but managed
  to remain erect.</p>

  <p>The lawn now became the scene of fresh activity. The colonel, still dazed,
  with the help of three strong men was being elevated to the top of his horse,
  an operation in which neither the colonel nor the horse seemed to be the
  least bit interested. Presently the sweating huntsmen were safely if not
  securely installed in their saddles while the women stood about and made
  unhelpful but irritating suggestions, as women always do and always will when
  men are striving to maintain their dignity in the face of overwheling
  odds.</p>

  <p>Once more the pack appeared. Its mood had now shifted from one of famished
  activity to satiated greed. Leisurely the hounds ambled across the lawn and
  slipped past us with many a futive backward glance, as if expecting a sudden
  kick. Their respective rumps were guiltily shrunken. Once safely out of reach
  they broke into a run and speedily absorbed themselves into the landscape,
  severalsecretly amused negroes pretending to pursue them.</p>

  <p>"Are you all ready?" cried Albert, holding up his hand. "If you are, let's
  go."</p>

  <p>"Just a minute now," came the querulous voice of the stranger. "Go where,
  Mr. Green? I've gotten me up on the top of this dumb beast like you said but
  damned if I enjoy the prospect of jouncing all over the countryside on it
  without any idea where I'm going or when I'm coming back."</p>

  <p>In the face of this reasonable question the hunting party fell into a
  depressed silence. Obviously many of its members were asking themselves the
  same thing. Albert rushed gamely into the breach.</p>

  <p>"We go wherever the fox goes," he explained.</p>

  <p>"What fox?" demanded the man.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what fox," said Albert. "Just any fox&mdash;the fox we're
  after."</p>

  <p>"What's this fox gone and done, Albert" another unknown inquired
  mildly.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't done anything," said my host.</p>

  <p>"Then why are we after him?" continued the voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, you can't very well have a fox hunt without some sort of fox, can
  you?" asked Albert bitterly. "It's all very simple. We just sit on our horses
  and go where the fox goes."</p>

  <p>"If you think it's so simple sitting on this animated file,"someone
  indignantly observed, "I'd like you to change places with me and let him
  chafe you for awhile. I'm tow-thirds ruined already and we haven't even
  started yet."</p>

  <p>"Let's hope this old fox goes to bed, then we can all do likewise," the
  weary stranger offered hopefully.</p>

  <p>As the company straggled through the gate, a sudden cry of warning brought
  us to a stop. It seems that our colonel with the aid of a low-hanging limb
  had somehow managed to unhorse himself. Turning quickly, I caught a momentary
  glimpse of that stout gentleman decending earthward with terrific speed where
  he landed in a sitting position and remained as if atrophied. Horses and
  riders alike gazed down at him with concentrated attention as if wondering
  why their colonel had taken it into his head to act in such a peculiar
  manner.</p>

  <p>"What's the meaning of all this?" asked Albert pushing his horse through
  the circle. The colonel regarded him balefully.</p>

  <p>What the hell do you think it means?" he demaned in a high, thin voice.
  "That I'm playing mud pies?" Young man, it means foul play. I was struck from
  behind."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Albert at last, "we can't very well leave him sitting there
  like that all day. Get him back on his horse and we'll make a fresh
  start."</p>

  <p>The colonel accepted a drink and once more allowed himself to be heaved
  into the saddle, where he sat in stunned silence.</p>

  <p>"I say, Mr. Green," a third stranger to Albert cried out, "What are we
  supposed to do with this fox once we catch him?"</p>

  <p>"Which is very doubtful," the first one added.</p>

  <p>Albert laughed with false heartiness. "Have your little joke," he called
  back.</p>

  <p>"It's no joke," said the other earnestly. "Swear to God I wouldn't know
  how to act with a real live fox."</p>

  <p>"Cut off his brush," grated Albert.</p>

  <p>"His what?" came the startled rejoiner in a shocked voice. "Oh, Mr.
  Green."</p>

  <p>"You know as well as I do," replied Albert.</p>

  <p>"Oh," exclaimed the other. "You don't like to talk about it. I think I
  know know." Albert flushed furiously.</p>

  <p>"Say, Mr. Green," asked a rider rather plaintively. "Why are you so mean
  to foxes, anyway? You must certainly hate 'em to do a thing to'em&mdash;you
  know - like you said."</p>

  <p>At this moment I reminded Albert that unless we looked for the dogs we
  might lose them forever, not that I greatly cared. A startled expression
  added to the unhappiness of his features. He held up a hand and listened.</p>

  <p>"Now where do you rekon those dogs could have gotten themselves to?" he
  asked at last.</p>

  <p>"Let's make it a dog hunt instead of a fox hunt," a bright young man
  suggested.</p>

  <p>Albert wineed, then suddenly his face cleared. From far down the road came
  an awful sound. I had begun to doubt the existance of Henry, but now I
  changed my mind.</p>

  <p>"Yonder's Henry!" exclaimed the delighted Albert with as much pride as if
  he were emitting all those terrible sounds himself." "Hear him!"</p>

  <p>We did. Henry had a shocking voice.</p>

  <p>"Glad I'm not a fox," someone piously observed. "I'm scared even to hunt
  with that dog lose."</p>

  <p>"Henry's giving tounge," exclaimed Albert.</p>

  <p>"Giving!" exclaimed the accurate rider. "Henry's doing heaps more than
  that. He's fairly tossing tongue away&mdash;lavishing tongue on the
  countryside."</p>

  <p>When finally we found the dogs they were in various reposeful attitudes
  while they idly watched one of their members trying to get at a negro
  clinging to the topmost limb. This dog was beyond description. Canine
  obscenities gushed from its throat. Its fangs were bared and foam flecked its
  lips. Henry, without a doubt. Upon seeing Albert, the negro in the tree let
  out a yell.</p>

  <p>"Fo' Gawd's sake, Mr. Albert, take dat dawk away or I'sa gone nigger."</p>

  <p>Albert looked up at the negro, then transferred his attention to the
  frantic beast. "Josh," he said at last, "that dog isn't Henry. Where do you
  suppose he came from?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care who the hell he is," one of our little group complained, "if
  he doesn't stop making those awful noises I'll climb one of those trees
  myself.</p>

  <p>"No, suh," responded Josh. "Dat dog sho ain't no Henry. Dat dog's Fanny.
  Mr. Albert, Fanny's by the way of being a bloodhound. We sort of invited her
  over last night just to fancy up the pack a bit."</p>

  <p>"A charming piece of garnishing, Fanny," remarked a gentleman on my
  left.</p>

  <p>"Well, Josh," said Albert wearily, "I reckon you'd better get Fanny home
  or she'll be treeing every damn nigger in the countryside and then we'l never
  get any foxes.</p>

  <p>"Foxes," I quietly inquired.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," shot back Albert. "I said foxes. Henry must be looking for
  some now." The subject was changed by a sudden groan from our colonel.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he announced, "I can stand it no longer. I fear I'm bleeding
  to death." "Where?" demanded Albert, turning to cope with this new
  disaster.</p>

  <p>The colonel seemed reluctant to take us into his confidence concerning the
  exact location of his mortal wound.</p>

  <p>"I must have sat on my flask," he replied after some hesitation. "When I
  fell, you know. I've been sitting on the pieces ever since."</p>

  <p>"My God," breathed Albert. "What next? Help the colonel down, some of you,
  and I'll see what I can do about it."</p>

  <p>Our colonel asked Albert, now assuming the role of glass picker, retired
  among the bushes with old fashioned southern modesty. Presently Albert
  reappeared.</p>

  <p>"I am happy to announce," he said, "that the colonel's injuries were more
  demeaning to a gentleman of his high spirit than serious to his person. He
  has decided to continue with us. Let us hope and pray that this will be the
  last interruption. We must now find Henry, leader of the pack."</p>

  <p>An ironical cheer greeted this fine speech. The colonel was placed
  delicately on his horse. The negro attendants beat the dogs into a reluctant
  state of activity. Once more the hunt was in motion. For an hour or more we
  cantered along the roads pleasantly enough, stopping occasionally to let the
  pack catch up with us. The dogs were friendly, courteous and even playful.
  They seemed to nourish no grudge against us, but it was plain to see that no
  one had taken the trouble to tell them what it was all about. To the pack it
  was an outing&mdash;a casually informal affair.</p>

  <p>"Just wait till they catch up with Henry," Albert kept assuring us. "then
  just watch 'em go."</p>

  <p>We did. From somewhere far down the road the ravings of a mad dog were
  bourne to us. Albert's face became radiant.</p>

  <p>"Yonder's Henry!" he shouted. "Hear him!"</p>

  <p>The dogs, exerting their last ounce of energy, broke into a run and sped
  down the road. Fresh hope returned to our hearts as we thundered after.
  Perhaps there might be something to this fox-hunting business after all. The
  pack was now in full cry. We rounded a curve and saw the dogs streaming
  across an open field in the direction of some woods. A large and elated
  rabbit was cutting insulting capers in their faces. Albert's own face looked
  a trifle dismayed.</p>

  <p>"Shucks," he said, "that fool rabbit just crossed the fox's trail, but he
  won't put Henry off. Follow on."</p>

  <p>Follow on we did, and in short time crashed into the woods. Then
  consternation reigned. Close to my ear a shotgun suddenly exploded. It
  exploded very close to my ear.</p>

  <p>"Moonshiners!" someone shouted, and the effect was electrifying.</p>

  <p>From behind the most innocent looking trees bearded faces appeared. In a
  methodical manner the owners of these faces began to discharge lead into the
  ranks of the disorganized hunt. In an instant, dogs, horses and men were
  fighting democratically together for mere survival. There was a great
  thrashing of branches and a complicated entangling of man and beast. The
  moonshiners seemingly had an inexhaustable supply of ammunition and a
  passionate desire to use it. I now saw the reasonalbeness of our clubs and
  guns, although our party used neither.</p>

  <p>Personally, I sustained no loss other than Molly and a large quantity of
  breath. From the safety of a slight elevation I observed the component parts
  of the hunt break from the woods and dash across the field. Men who had known
  each other for years passed without the slightest recognition, so occupied
  were they with their own thoughts. the field was dotted with horses, dogs and
  men, some of the men in their impatience even pushing horses out of their
  way. I felt that I was look at an old English hunting print suddenly thrown
  into reverse. Some of those dogs, I dare say, are still running.</p>

  <p>The last to withdraw from the woods were our colonel, Albert and my Molly.
  The colonel was leaning on Albert's arm. Molly appeared to be trying to hold
  his other hand. I was joined by this little group and with Albert's help put
  our colonel on to Molly. He sat well forward and practiced soul stirring
  groans. Foxes would have little to fear from our colonel for many days to
  come. Very little was said. There was hardly anything either fit or safe to
  be said unless we talked about the weather. Albert steadily refused to meet
  my eyes.</p>

  <p>After an interminable walk we at last approached the smooth green lawn of
  my host's home. Several members of the hunt were grouped round the rumpled
  tablecloth. They were looking down sadly on a large inert body. Mrs. Albert
  was saying things. We listened.</p>

  <p>"Would you believe it?" she was saying. "Ever since you all got out of
  sight he's been sleeping there just like a lamb. Must have eaten too much
  hunt breakfast. Isn't he sweet?"</p>

  <p>We, too, gazed down at the slumbering figure. The expression in Albert's
  eyes was too terrible for man to behold. I felt inclined to withdraw quietly
  to leave him alone with his sorrow. The figure, as if feeling our eyes upon
  it, feebly attempted to raise its head. Slumber overcame it. A gnawed chicken
  bone slipped from its mouth as it drifted off to sleep. A tail moved with
  propitiatory intentions. A gentle sigh fell upon the evening air.</p>

  <p>The our colonel lifted up his voice.</p>

  <p>"Yonder's Henry!" he howled, and then there was a touch of maddness in his
  eyes. "Hear him!" He paused, squared his shoulders, then confronted
  Albert.</p>

  <p>The rest is silence...</p>
