  <h3>NOTE</h3>

  <p class="intro">This book is a compilation of four monographs by Edward
  Spencer Beesly published in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, which Beesly
  co-founded, between 1865 and 1869. Illustrations have been added to the
  PGA/RGL edition. It is perhaps of bibliographic interest that Beesly's wife,
  Emily, wrote the book <i>Stories from the History of Rome</i> (also available
  at PGA and RGL) for their four childen and that it was published in the same
  year as <i>Catiline, Clodius, and Tiberius</i>&mdash;1878. &mdash;RG.</p>

  <p class="first">IF in the political life of our own time we are too much in
  the habit of judging men with reference to party, in our views of history we
  are equally prone to judge parties with reference to men. There is a natural
  and perhaps laudable prejudice in favour of a political party which numbers
  among its ranks the men who have the reputation of decency, probity, and
  respectability. But is it so clear that such men are likely to be on the
  right side in political struggles? Their virtues, if genuine, are no doubt,
  from a public point of view, valuable; but it is unquestionable that they are
  virtues frequently found in conjunction with narrow minds and timid spirits.
  If this class of men had a preponderating influence, human progress must
  cease. Moreover, ill-natured as it may seem, we cannot avoid observing that
  these virtues are simulated more easily, more naturally, and more
  unconsciously than any others. The citizen who has wealth and a dignified
  position soon learns to pique himself on his exemption from vices to which he
  has no temptation, and poses, not without ostentation, as the "integer vita
  scelerisque purus." The merit he thus affects has also the advantage of being
  simple and obvious. As it May be coupled with the humblest capacity and the
  feeblest character, so it is by ordinary men most easily understood and most
  highly valued. The average mortal feels incapable of judging the aims and
  conduct of a Cesar or a Cromwell. But if you tell him that Catulus was
  veracity itself,* or that, Falkland ingeminated <i>Peace, Peace</i>, he feels
  that here are solid facts on which at all events he can make up his mind. The
  inference of course follows, that the party which received the support of
  such men must have been battling for the right. Capital punishment of
  citizens without appeal to the people, was as illegal at Rome as general
  warrants in England. But Cicero was a more respectable man than Clodius, and
  George Grenville than Wilkes. The systems attacked by Catiline and O'Connell
  may have been full of folly and injustice. But the men themselves have a bad
  name. They had an interest in disorder. They stimulated their followers to
  violence and insurrection. Whereas we know that Cicero and Cato, the Duke and
  Sir Robert Peel, were highly respectable men (whose interests were bound up
  with order), and our sympathies must therefore go with them. Thus it is that
  not a few of the <i>enfants perdus</i> of political progress are more hardly
  judged by posterity, when the abuse they attacked is universally condemned,
  than by their contemporaries, while it is still an open question.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "Hoc verum est; dixit enim Q. Catulus."</p>

  <p>Of all the characters in history Catiline has been painted blackest. He is
  to the historians what Judas Iscariot is to the divines. The name itself has
  a wicked sound to us The very syllables of it seem to connote a monstrous
  depravity. We cannot hear it but there rings in our ears a confused hurtle of
  <i>incendia, coedes, latrocinium, audacia, furor, scelus, parricida,
  sicarius</i>, and other choice missiles from the Ciceronian armoury. We think
  of him not as a man, but as a demon breathing murder, rapine, and
  conflagration, with bloodshot eyes and pallid face, luring on weak and
  depraved young men to the damnation prepared for himself; a horrid portent
  rising from below, without visible cause or warning, like some earthquake or
  volcano, to scorch the fair face of civilisation and convert order into
  chaos.</p>

  <p>In endeavouring to relate the story of Catiline calmly and consistently
  with common sense, I protest, by anticipation, against the supposition that I
  am amusing myself with maintaining a paradox. My sole desire is to do
  something towards the elucidation of a much misunderstood period of Roman
  history. I care nothing about the memory of Catiline, except so far as he was
  the representative, for a time, of the revolution which it is sought to
  blacken through him, just as the French revolution is blackened by
  calumniating Danton and Robespierre.</p>

  <p>Let us first endeavour to get some true conception of what the Roman
  revolution was, and what its course had been before Catiline became a
  prominent actor in it. It did not, like the French revolution, owe its birth
  to the growth of ideas and the progress of speculation. It was purely a
  revolt against intolerable practical evils. No government has been such a
  scourge to the governed, as was that of the Roman oligarchy during the last
  century of its existence. Some few of the emperors, maddened by the
  possession of absolute power, outraged and oppressed families or individuals
  who had become obnoxious to them, and indulged in freaks of cruel tyranny,
  which history has taken care to record. Asiatic despots have not seldom shown
  a sublime indifference to human suffering. Party leaders have been pitiless
  to opponents, and mobs have sometimes waded in blood. But the aggregate of
  suffering caused by such agencies appears trifling when compared with the
  systematic, the methodical torture inflicted by the Roman oligarchy on the
  Roman world. The government was entirely in the hands of the senate. The
  senate was composed of ex-officials. Office was again practically
  unattainable except by "nobiles," men, that is, whose ancestors had filled
  offices. From Marius to Cicero, a period of forty years, there was no
  instance of a "novus homo" obtaining the consulship. Nor did the oligarchy
  choose the most capable men even from its own ranks. Oligarchies are always
  jealous of distinguished merit, and a Scipio or an Aemilius Paullus was only
  called to the helm when repeated disasters had shaken the state and
  discredited the governing class. Vast wealth was to be found among the
  nobility, but also vast indebtedness; for politics was an expensive pursuit,
  and no man could hope to succeed who was not as lavish in flinging away his
  money as he was unscrupulous in getting it. A young man spent all he had and
  all he could borrow in forcing his way to office. If he was known to be
  audacious and unscrupulous he found unlimited credit among the money-lenders,
  for office would be a certain mine of wealth. When his consulship or
  praetorship had expired he was assigned a province, and then he made his
  harvest. In the two or three years of his government he had to amass treasure
  enough to repay his creditors and to place himself in opulence for the
  remainder of his life. Ha had no salary; but his power was practically
  unlimited. He could therefore plunder the wretched provincials at his
  discretion. His operations were generally carried on in the most open and
  shameless manner. The rod, the axe, and the cross were freely employed in the
  quest, for there was a cold pitiless barbarity about a Roman noble unknown in
  modern times, except perhaps among the slave-owners in America. While the
  head brigand swept off the richest prizes, his "cohors" or attachés flew at
  smaller game, and between them they managed, in the course of two years, to
  pick the prey tolerably bare. But this was not the worst. If Verres had been
  governor of Sicily for life, the position of the Sicilians would have been
  comparatively enviable. Pure selfishness would have taught him to give some
  protection to life, some security to property, if he did not wish to dry-up
  the sources of his wealth. Such an arrangement, however, was incompatible
  with the oligarchical system. Turn about is fair play. Verres and his suite
  may gorge for two years or even three; but at the end of that time he must
  give place to some hungry successor just arrived from Rome, he too with debts
  to discharge, friends to gratify, and a fortune to make. Can we be surprised
  that under this blasting system, whole districts went out of cultivation,
  whole towns became uninhabited?</p>

  <p>Alongside the governing class at Rome was a moneyed class whose chief
  field of operation was also in the provinces. As tax-farmers and moneylenders
  they were a scourge hardly less terrible than the officials. When an
  insurrection broke out in a provincial town the first thought of the populace
  invariably was to massacre the "cives Romanos qui negotiandi causa ibi
  constiterant." As in our own country, there was no love lost between the
  business men and the governing class. The noble sneered at the trader and the
  trader snarled at the noble, and sometimes brooded sulkily over his own
  exclusion from a political career. But upon the whole there was a tacit
  understanding between the two classes to divide the spoil. The middle class
  acquiesced in the monopoly of office by the nobles, on condition that the
  tax-farmer and money-lender were backed up in the provinces by official
  authority.</p>

  <p>If the provinces were on the high road to ruin, Italy herself, the home of
  the conquering race, was in little better plight. It was a wise and
  time-honoured principle, established at a time when the gradual incorporation
  of Italy with Rome had not been arrested, that the provinces should furnish
  taxes, not soldiers, and Italy soldiers but not taxes. From fiscal extortion
  and its concomitant evils the Italians were exempt. But the Italians who
  enjoyed the enviable privileges of Roman citizenship were before the
  commencement of the revolution much less than half the inhabitants of the
  peninsula. The rest, men of the same or kindred stock who had done their
  share, and more than their share, in building up the empire, shedding their
  blood on every battlefield from the Tagus to the Halys, were held in
  political bondage, and exposed in their native towns to the brutality and
  caprice of Roman officials. Moreover, throughout the peninsula&mdash;on Roman
  territory still more than on Italian&mdash;the free peasantry and yeomanry
  were being superseded by gangs of slaves, who cultivated the vast estates of
  wealthy proprietors. The free population congregated in the cities,
  particularly in the metropolis, where they formed a mass of pauperism every
  day more appalling to the thoughtful politician.</p>

  <p>The dull people who have for the most part had the writing of history to
  themselves do not seem to have perceived that at the commencement of the
  revolution (B.C. 133) the greatness of Rome was rapidly declining. Industry
  dying out before slavery, commerce languishing, land going out of
  cultivation, population diminishing, frontiers receding, north and east
  menaced by barbarians, armies that could not fight led by generals that could
  not command&mdash;we have all the symptoms that characterised the final break
  up in the fourth and fifth centuries of the Christian era. The new military
  system inaugurated by the revolution, and the improved administration which
  is the glory of the empire, arrested this downward course, and gave the world
  five hundred years more of Roman civilisation. But to Scipio Aemilianus, the
  last hero of the old <i>régime</i>, the end must have seemed not far
  distant.</p>

  <p>Under such a complicated load of evils was the Roman commonwealth
  staggering, evils that clearly portended a fatal issue, evils not springing
  from natural and unavoidable causes, but distinctly traceable to the infamous
  system of government maintained by the nobility for the most selfish and
  sordid ends. This was the system round which the respectable friends of order
  (<i>optimates</i>) rallied, the Catos, the Ciceros, and the Catuli. This was
  the system which the irreverent advocates of reform (<i>populares</i>), the
  Gracchi, the Catilines the Caesars, strove to beat down. The reformers were
  not all pure-minded patriots, not all men of stainless lives. But if we would
  deal them even-handed justice, let us never forget what that thing was that
  they were labouring to destroy and their opponents to keep alive.</p>

  <p>The Roman revolution was inaugurated by the Gracchi. Never had a good
  cause more noble champions. Not even the shameless mendacity of Roman party
  warfare dared to breathe a slander against their private character.* The
  elder, all enthusiasm, sentiment, and generosity, was born to be loved. The
  nobles beat his brains out in the street. The younger was cast in a sterner
  mould, and had the murder of an adored brother to avenge.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* If Cicero had been their contemporary, with his
  theories on "Mendaciuncula," derived from his Greek models, the Gracchi we
  may be sure would have been handed down to us as stained with every vice that
  humanity most shudders at.</p>

  <p>The first really great man that Rome in six centuries had produced,
  imperial in his aims, fearless in his choice of means, he gathered up the
  whole force of the revolution in his single arm and smote the oligarchy with
  a mortal blow&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"Moriens animam abstulit hosti.<br>
  Tum super exanimum sese projecit amicum<br>
  Confossus, placidaque ibi demum morte quievit."</p>

  <p>The next crisis of the revolution was the attempt of Saturninus to make
  Marius chief of the State. The charges of vice and profligacy heaped upon
  Saturninus are, to say the least, unsupported by any trustworthy evidence.
  Cicero, who must have been well acquainted with many both of his supporters
  and opponents, although frequently speaking with detestation of his policy,
  nowhere says a word against his private character. There seems to be no
  reason to question that he was a sincere reformer endeavouring to carry out
  the policy of Caius Gracchus, which was in effect to incorporate the Italians
  with Rome, and to substitute a single ruler responsible directly to the
  people for the sham Republic. No doubt he resorted to violence. But how could
  he do otherwise when the nobility were ever ready to meet constitutional
  action by the bludgeon and the dagger? His scheme, could it have succeeded,
  would certainly have been a blessing to Rome. It failed through the miserable
  political cowardice of Marius. The moneyed men, who had hitherto favoured the
  revolution, now turned against it, and the fall of Saturninus was followed by
  a real <i>terreur blanche</i>.</p>

  <p>Drusus, who headed the revolutionary party in the struggle of 91, is
  allowed to have been a man of the loftiest character. An aristocrat by birth
  and temper, he called on the governing class to prove itself worthy of rule
  by rising superior to selfish greed, and exercising its functions as a duty
  not as a privilege. In particular he called on them to face the Italian
  question which had never slept since it had been stirred by Caius Gracchus.
  He was assassinated. He had fully expected it.</p>

  <p>The next conspicuous leader of the revolution was the orator Sulpicius.
  His character too has been painted very black, without a shadow of evidence.
  It seems clear that he was an enthusiastic man, whose patience was exhausted
  by the cant of the conservatives, eternally prating about order and the laws,
  while they knocked on the head every man who attempted reform by
  constitutional means. They had appealed to the sword, and so would he. But a
  new force was now beginning to make itself felt. For the first time in the
  history of Rome an army intervened in a political question. Sulla marched his
  troops on the city. The revolution was for the moment crushed, and its
  leaders, as usual, massacred. But no sooner had the champion of the senate
  departed for the East, than the irrepressible conflict broke out again. The
  senate was powerless. The constitution was virtually at an end. Cinna, and
  after him Carbo, were chiefs of the state, governing despotically by the will
  of the majority. Unfortunately, they were not fitted, either mentally or
  morally, for so serious a responsibility. The only solid result of their
  government&mdash;and that due more to the force of events than to the
  men&mdash;was the final incorporation of the Italians with Rome.</p>

  <p>Again the political question hung on the shock of contending armies. Sulla
  returned with his veterans, and after two campaigns found himself absolute
  master of the Roman state. Too fond of ease and self-indulgence to care for
  empire, an aristocrat to the finger tips, Sulla re-established the
  oligarchical constitution in its stiffest form, having previously assured its
  duration for at least a few years, by the simple expedient of putting to
  death every one whom he thought at all likely to recalcitrate. But, like
  Herod and Macbeth, with all his precaution, he missed the important
  victim.</p>

  <p>The first serious blows to the Sullan constitution came from an old
  partizan of its founder. The history of the last twenty years had not been
  lost upon Pompeius. Cinna, Carbo, and Sulla had successively ruled Rome with
  absolute power. Pompeius looked on himself as their natural successor; and if
  he never openly asserted his position, it was because his inordinate vanity
  constantly led him to believe that it would come to him gradually without any
  effort of his own. The key to his vacillating career will probably be found
  in the hypothesis, that being a man of no originality and no earnest
  political convictions, his only idea was to repeat the career of Sulla. When
  that chart failed him he lost his reckoning and steered wildly. He wished to
  be the dignified omnipotent patron of the aristocracy, administering
  provinces by his lieutenants, occasionally undertaking some extraordinary
  function, but ordinarily sitting apart in sublime solitude with the Domitii
  and the Metelli kotooing, and the rabble cheering itself hoarse.
  Unfortunately, however, he never succeeded in convincing the nobles of the
  beauty and fitness of this arrangement. He could not persuade them that he
  was a man of Sulla's calibre. They thwarted his schemes. They sneered at his
  vanity. They despised his mushroom nobility. They believed that the
  constitution could stand without his protection, and studied to reduce him
  within the limits of oligarchic equality. Hence his coalitions with Cesar, in
  which he imagined that he was using his great rival as a tool to humble the
  nobles. He played with revolution. Caesar meant it. The time therefore came
  when Pompeius was content to enrol himself with the nobles not as their
  master, but as their servant, though probably not without the secret
  resolution to make a clean sweep of "optimates" and "populares" alike had he
  conquered at Pharsalia.</p>

  <p>If the appointment of Pompeius to carry on the war against Mithridates
  (B.C. 66) had been very unpalatable to the nobles, they had at least the
  opportunity, during his four years' absence, of playing their game without
  being thwarted by his opposition, or humiliated by his patronage. It was
  clear that a storm was impending. The merciless proscriptions of Sulla had
  cut off every man of influence and energy among the revolutionary party. But
  sixteen years had passed away, and with them the traces of that terrible
  depletion. New leaders had sprung up. Old grievances were flourishing rank as
  ever; and the pauperised masses, borrowing courage from despair, were once
  more confronted by the men of privilege, canting, unscrupulous, and ferocious
  as their fathers before them.</p>

  <p>The history of the so-called conspiracy of Catiline, as hitherto written
  is absolutely unintelligible, except on conventional rules of probability,
  which may satisfy us in melodrama, but are out of place as applied to real
  life. Some things in the past of course we cannot hope to clear up. We shall
  never know who the Hermokopids were, or who murdered Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey,
  or how Darnley came by his death; and we may acquiesce, without shame in our
  ignorance, because, important as the effects in these cases accidentally
  were, the facts themselves are no more of a public nature than the Road
  murder. The investigation of them belongs, not to the historian, but to some
  detective, with a literary turn, retired from business. But we may not so
  dismiss the Catilinarian mystery. It is not creditable to the historian to be
  at fault when the evidence and probabilities to be balanced are strictly
  political. The thoughts and actions of individuals may baffle our scrutiny.
  But nations and societies, and even parties, act in obedience to simple
  motives and broad general principles. The footsteps of the solitary traveller
  may be easily lost. But he who would follow the track of an army has only to
  use his eyes.</p>

  <p>If the story of Catiline is unintelligible, it is because the historians
  one and all have run away with the idea that Caesar was at that time the
  leader of the popular party. Mr. Merivale, for instance, prefaces his history
  of the conspiracy by a picture of the popular party, in which he makes Caesar
  the central figure. He "stood forth far more prominently among his own
  associates, and gave more distinct expression to their aims than was the case
  with any one of the chiefs of the opposite faction. To that grand array of
  aristocratic gravity, of military renown, of learning and eloquence, of
  austere and indomitable virtue, were opposed the genius and resources of one
  man," &amp;c. The Emperor Napoleon has not put forward this view more
  strongly than the English historian. Every law that is proposed emanate from
  Caesar. Every prosecution is instigated by Caesar. The idol of the populace
  is Caesar. The very provincials rest their hopes on Caesar. The sole thought
  of the oligarchy sleeping and waking is to parry the blows of Caesar.</p>

  <p>Well, but if this hypothesis be true,&mdash;if the masses follow Caesar,
  and the wealthy classes Cicero and Cato,&mdash;where are we to look for the
  party of Catiline, the party which thought itself strong enough to
  revolutionise the state, and, according to Cicero, was within an ace of doing
  so? This is a question which sensible men are not ashamed to answer by
  maundering about "dissolute youth," "insolvent debtors," and "disbanded
  soldiers." Any explanation must be preferable to such transparent
  nonsense.</p>

  <p>The fact is that the acknowledged leader of the popular party, after the
  departure of Pompeius, was not Caius Julius Caesar, but Lucius Sergius
  Catilina. When Caesar's grand career had closed, and men's eyes were still
  dazzled by the glorious effulgence, they naturally ransacked their own
  memories or the traditions of their elders, if perchance they might glean
  some fragments of information respecting the early life of the hero. They did
  not gather much for Caesar's early years had not greatly impressed his
  contemporaries. What they did gather we may be sure they made the most of.
  Every anecdote was treasured up, and every anecdote is characteristic. Now
  the most characteristic anecdotes of great men are generally the least
  authentic. Perhaps they are not, for that reason, the less valuable, since
  they represent the impression a man has produced on the contemporary or
  succeeding generation. But we must be careful how we arrange them alongside
  of facts, or spin out inferences from them. Suetonius, Plutarch, and Dion
  Cassius, writing long afterwards, were naturally disposed to attribute an
  importance to little facts in Caesar's early career, which in the eyes of
  contemporaries they certainly did not possess.</p>

  <p>That previous to the affair of Catiline, Caesar was by no means a leading
  man in his party may be very clearly proved. Every one knows that by far the
  largest part of our information respecting the period is derived from the
  works of Cicero, particularly from his letters and speeches. Previous to the
  fourth oration against Catiline, which was delivered in reply to a speech of
  Caesar, we have sixteen orations, forming in bulk about half of those extant.
  We have also eleven letters. Now it is a curious fact, and one which, as far
  as I am aware, has not hitherto been noticed, that in those orations and
  letters the name of Caesar does not occur once. Nay, more, I believe it will
  be found that nowhere in his subsequent writings, though continually alluding
  to Caesar, does he give the slightest intimation that before the affair of
  Catiline he was a man of consequence. Our other contemporary authority,
  Sallust, though a great admirer of Caesar, is equally silent about his early
  career. Neither Cicero's fourth oration against Catiline, nor the speech of
  Cato on the same occasion, as reported by Sallust, treat Caesar as the
  spokesman of the great popular party, which they could hardly have failed to
  do had he occupied that position. My own impression is, that the mettle
  Caesar showed in that memorable debate first marked out as the champion of
  the revolution a. man who hitherto had been popular indeed, but had not been
  regarded as a serious politician.</p>

  <p>The man on whom the eyes of the revolutionary party were fixed after the
  departure of Pompeius was, I repeat, Catiline. Sallust tells us so in so many
  words, "Cuncta plebes Catilinae incepta probabat."* Let us once understand
  this clearly, and Catiline's position becomes perfectly simple. He was the
  successor in direct order of the Gracchi, of Saturninus, of Drusus, of
  Sulpicius, and of Cinna, and was recognised as such both by friends and
  enemies. The popular cause, it must be owned, might have been in better
  hands; but it cannot be expected that the men who ride the revolutionary
  storm will always be men of the purest character. The more dangerous the task
  is made, the greater is the probability that none will undertake it but
  fiery, nay, desperate men, whom the passionate sense of wrong has made
  careless of consequences, both to themselves and others. It is fit and proper
  that when a Gracchus or a Drusus is murdered, the murderers should have to
  deal with a Catiline.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* De Conj. Cat. xxxvii. 1.</p>

  <p>Who and what, then, was this man whose deeds and purposes brought upon him
  not merely failure and death, but a martyrdom of nineteen centuries, from
  which even his iron soul must have shrunk, could he have foreseen it?</p>

  <p>L. Sergius Catilina was sprung from one of the most ancient patrician
  families of Rome. His ancestors had been consuls and decemvirs when the
  Metelli and Domitii were clapping their chopped hands and throwing up their
  sweaty nightcaps on the Aventine or Mons Sacer. But the sun of the Sergii had
  long set. No Sergius had been consul since the burning of Rome by the Gauls.
  Catiline himself had, like Pompeius and Crassus, borne arms on the side of
  Sulla. It is, therefore, quite possible that, like them, he may have been
  implicated in the butcheries of the proscription.* But when we remember the
  devotion with which he was followed in after years by the Marian party, we
  shall hesitate to believe that he was guilty of an act so exceptionally
  odious and horrible as the torture and murder, with his own hand, of M.
  Marius Gratidianus, a highly popular man; and a near relation of C. Marius.
  This tale is repeated as a matter of course by every historian; but let us
  see on what foundation it rests.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The cruelties of Pompeius are well known. Crassus,
  without authority, inserted a man's name on the list of the proscribed, that
  he might get his property.</p>

  <p>Quintus Cicero, in a letter to his brother Marcus, at the time when the
  latter was standing for the consulship, tells him that Catiline had murdered
  Gratidianus and also his own brother-in-law, Caecilius. M. Cicero, in an
  oration delivered at the same time against Catiline, who was his competitor,
  and of which some disjointed fragments remain, appears to have advanced the
  charge publicly. This is the only contemporary evidence. What historians in
  later ages wrote, we may be sure they wrote on the authority of Cicero. Of
  the facts they would know no more than we do. Now every one who is acquainted
  with the ancient orators, both Greek and Roman, is aware that they never
  shrunk from the most impudent falsifications of fact when it served their
  turn. At the present day, when contemporary history is recorded in a vast
  printed literature, easily accessible to every one at a moment's notice, a
  speaker is afraid to make assertions which would be proved to be false in all
  the newspapers next morning. But a Greek or Roman orator was under no such
  fear, and his most daring fabrications were commonly introduced by
  <i>"&mu;&epsilon;&mu;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&theta;&epsilon;  &gamma;&alpha;&rho; 
  &delta; &eta;&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;  &omega; 
  &alpha;&nu;&delta;&rho;&epsilon;&sigmaf; 
  '&Alpha;&theta;&eta;&nu;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&iota; ,"</i> or "Ecquis est
  vestrum Quirites qui non meminerit." Cicero's oration, "In Toga Candida," was
  an electioneering speech, in which his object was to paint Catiline as black
  as he could. The stories about Gratidianus and Caecilius he probably got from
  his brother's letter, above alluded to, for he was himself absent from Rome
  during the proscriptions. But, it may be said, Catiline was prosecuted for
  the murder of Gratidianus. True; but when? Not till this very year. The
  murder of Gratidianus had taken place eighteen years before. It was one among
  hundreds of others, resembling it, no doubt, pretty closely in all its
  circumstances. It was now raked up by Cicero to discredit Catiline with his
  Marian supporters. Of the thousands who listened to the unscrupulous orator,
  how many would be able to say how Gratidianus came by his death? When once
  the charge was set afloat during a hotly disputed election, of course it
  would be repeated as an indisputable truth by the partisans of Cicero, and
  Catiline was put on his trial for it.</p>

  <p>We are entitled to point to the fact that he was acquitted. The verdicts
  of Roman juries are not above suspicion. But Catiline himself was very poor,
  and the long purses were on the side of Cicero. An acquittal may not prove a
  man innocent; but still less does a prosecution prove him guilty. Sallust,
  our only other contemporary authority, while raking up everything
  disadvantageous to Catiline, says nothing of his share in the murders of the
  proscription, nor did Cicero himself ever again allude to it in his most
  unsparing invectives. It had served his turn for the moment, which was all he
  thought of.</p>

  <p>The other stories which Cicero and Sallust set afloat, and Plutarch and
  Dion copied, cannot easily be disproved, for the simple reason that they are
  not supported by a tittle of evidence. Catiline has the misfortune to lose
  his wife and only son. Of course, he poisoned them. He has a large circle of
  friends who are never weary of his society. What more easy than to call them
  a gang of debauchees? If you had a political quarrel with a man at Rome, you
  accused him, as a matter of course, of all vices and crimes, natural and
  unnatural. These were the "mendaciuncula," the fibs, with which, as Cicero
  tells us in one of his treatises on rhetoric, a good orator will season his
  speech.* It was so much "common form." You were not liable to be called out,
  or horsewhipped, or indicted for a malicious libel.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* De Oratore, II. 59.</p>

  <p>Even with these wholesome checks we know what queer stories will get about
  in England at an election, and what strong language Fizkin will use to
  Slumkey on the Eatanswill hustings. In England, these libels are soon
  forgotten; but in Rome they were precisely what remained and have been
  preserved, because they are imbedded in the speeches of a great orator. Our
  dull <i>littérateurs</i> have adopted them as serious facts, rather than
  confess how little we really know of ancient history beyond its broad
  features. Sallust admits, in two places; that he had no evidence for these
  scandalous stories, and that in the opinion of many they were trumped up by
  Cicero's friends after the execution of Catiline's partisans, in order to
  relieve the consul from the odium of that illegal act.* Nay, Cicero himself,
  seven years afterwards, confesses that Catiline enjoyed the intimacy of many
  of the best men in Rome, who esteemed him for the eminent virtues (maximae
  virtutes) he <i>appeared</i> to possess.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* De Conj. Cat., xiv. 7; xxii. 3.</p>

  <p>"There was a time," he says, "when he nearly imposed on me, even on me. I
  used to think him a worthy citizen, a man who delighted in the society of the
  good, a firm and faithful friend. His criminal enterprises came upon me
  completely by surprise. I have often since reproached myself with my
  mistake."* What! a man who had commenced his career by horrible cruelties
  committed in the face of Rome, who had notoriously murdered his nearest
  relatives, whose whole life had been passed in the public practice of the
  foulest and most unnatural debauchery, who had been a sort of professor of
  depravity among the most depraved wretches of the day&mdash;this monster
  could enjoy the friendship and respect of the best men in Rome! For my part I
  know what to think.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Pro M. Coelio, 6.</p>

  <p>So much for Catiline's antecedents. There seems to be no reason to doubt
  that he had been of Sulla's party. Beyond this we do not know a single fact
  about him, good or bad. All we know is that he was considered a respectable
  man in the most respectable circles in Rome, and that, as he is admitted on
  all hands to have possessed some very fine and rare qualities, he must have
  been a man of mark and promise.</p>

  <p>Catiline's public life covers the period from B.C. 68, when he was
  praetor, to B.C. 62, when he fell on the field of Pistoria. We have no
  information as to his praetorship. In 67 he went in due course to Africa as
  propraetor. When he returned in 66, Pompeius, hitherto looked on as the
  popular leader, was away in Asia, conducting the war against Mithridates, and
  the popular party was for the moment without a head. The nobles were
  determined to take advantage of his absence to inaugurate a reaction.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "Postquam Cn. Pompeius ad bellum maritimum atque
  Mithridaticum missus est, plebis opes imminutae, paucorum potentia
  crevit."&mdash;<i>Sallust, de Conj.</i> Cat., xxxix. 1.</p>

  <p>The election of consuls for the ensuing year had fallen on Autronius and
  Sulla. The first was perhaps "ignobilis;" at all events, no Autronius had yet
  been consul. The latter, though a nephew of the great Dictator, had used his
  influence with his uncle to save many of the proscribed, and was now on the
  the popular side.* The oligarchy quashed the election on the ground of
  bribery, although for Sulla at least every century had given its vote, and
  declared the defeated candidates, Cotta and Torquatus, consuls for 65&mdash;a
  proceeding as outrageous as that of the House of Commons in 1769, when it
  declared Colonel Luttrell member for Middlesex. To this year belongs what is
  called the first conspiracy of Catiline. Evidently on his return he had
  stepped into the place of popular leader, vacant by the absence of Pompeius.
  He had supported the candidature of Autronius and Sulla, and he is accused of
  having now conspired with them to kill Torquatus and Cotta. The plot, it is
  said, failed through Catiline's not giving the signal at the right moment.
  There is no proof that this charge was seriously and publicly made at the
  time. Later in the year it was arranged that Catiline should stand on the
  popular interest for 64, and to prevent this the notorious Clodius was
  employed by the oligarchy to impeach him for malversation in Africa. Upon
  this trial Clodius brought up the story of the assassination plot. But the
  Consul Torquatus himself pooh-poohed it, and showed that he acquitted
  Catiline, at all events, of any share in it, by coming forward in his
  defence. Doubtless it would never have been heard of again but for the fierce
  passions subsequently excited. It is worthy of remark that Suetonius, upon
  the authority of Bibulus and the elder Curio, attributes this plot to Crassus
  and Caesar, the latter of whom he says made the mistake about the signal.
  Catiline he does not even mention.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Cicero, pro P. Sulla, 26.</p>

  <p>Catiline was acquitted of malversation; but the object of the oligarchy
  was gained. The impeachment had been so timed as to make it impossible for
  him to announce himself as a candidate before the period for giving notice
  had expired. We may imagine how his fierce temper was rising as he saw the
  game the oligarchy were determined to play. However, he at once commenced his
  canvass for 63. Among his competitors were Cicero and Antonius. Cicero was
  anxious to make common cause with Catiline, and to be nominated with him on
  the popular ticket. With this view he was anxious to act as Catiline's
  advocate on his African trial.* But it was determined that Antonius should
  run with Catiline; and Cicero thereupon threw himself upon the nobles, and
  was put forward as their candidate.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* We know all this from a letter of Cicero to Atticus (i.
  2), in which he speaks as if he was already engaged in the case ("Indices
  <i>habemus</i>," etc.). Middleton has the effrontery to say that Catiline
  "had been soliciting Cicero to undertake his defence."</p>

  <p>From this moment dates the furious hostility of Cicero to Catiline. Up to
  this time he had courted the revolutionary party. But he now sold himself to
  the nobles, and began to earn his wages by denouncing revolutionary measures,
  and the leader of the party, Catiline. Among the earliest efforts of his
  venal tongue in this direction were the orations, <i>In Toga Candida, De Lege
  Agraria</i>, and <i>Pro C. Rabirio</i>. It is in the first of them that the
  horrible charges against the early life of Catiline were made, for the first
  time, as far as we know. While accusing Catiline of abetting the cruelties of
  Sulla, Cicero was not ashamed to oppose the bill for restoring the children
  of Sulla's victims to their civil rights.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the efforts of the oligarchy brought in Cicero at the head
  of the poll for the ensuing year, Antonius heading Catiline by a few votes.
  On January 1st, 63, Cicero and Antonius entered on office. Again Catiline
  renewed his candidature, and again the oligarchy concentrated all its efforts
  to defeat the popular champion. To this object Cicero, inflamed by personal
  hatred and the proverbial bitterness of a renegade, devoted the whole period
  of his consulship. Judging from all former precedents, an appeal to force was
  imminent. The nobles were evidently resolved, by fair means or foul, to keep
  Catiline out of office. On the other hand, Catiline was not a man to submit
  tamely either to fraud or violence. Probably those did him no injustice who
  thought him capable of striking the first blow. Most certainly he did not
  mean to be knocked on the head like the Gracchi and Saturninus, whose cases
  Cicero was always quoting as wholesome precedents. If the nobles had their
  armed retainers and the vantage ground of authority and office, he had the
  populace of Rome on his side, and the peasantry throughout Italy, groaning
  under an infamous government, and ripe for revolution. Expecting from day to
  day that a <i>coup d'état</i> would force him into open resistance, he passed
  the word round to be ready for action. If he could obtain the consulship, of
  course there would be no civil war; and that he would obtain it appeared more
  and more likely as the day of election approached. Would the nobles let
  things take their course?</p>

  <p>The moment for the <i>coup d'état</i> seemed to be come. On October 20th,
  Cicero got up in the senate and announced the existence of a plot. This was
  made an excuse for postponing the election, and the next day Cicero called
  Catiline to account before the senate. The popular leader disdainfully
  scouted the idea of a plot. They were welcome to know his plans. The people
  had found its strength, and while he was alive, should not want a leader.
  Having said this, he abruptly left the house, amidst the groans of the
  assembled nobles, to the great disappointment of Cicero, who had hoped that
  he would be murdered on the spot&mdash;as he certainly would have been if
  Cicero had had the nerve of Nasica or Opimius.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "Omnino vivum illinc exire non
  oportuerat."&mdash;<i>Cicero, pro Murena</i>, 25.</p>

  <p>One thing, however, Cicero could do. He could talk; and talk he did. He
  employed the interval before the election in filling Rome with horrible
  stories of a plot. He made men's hair stand on end with his ravings. The
  conspirators had met in the dead of night. They had sworn a fearful oath.
  They had tasted each other's blood. They had killed a child and eaten its
  entrails. They had resolved to plunder and burn the city. Rome was mapped out
  into districts for conflagration.</p>

  <p>Grossly improbable as such charges were, they were sure to damage
  Catiline; and by means of these manoeuvres and a lavish expenditure of money,
  which disgusted even so violent an aristocrat as Cato, the nobility again
  managed to carry their candidates, Silanus and Murena.</p>

  <p>That Catiline may at this time have laid plans against the life of Cicero
  is probable enough. He was not a man whom we could expect to rise superior to
  the manners of his class. The nobility had never shrunk from assassination
  where it served their purpose; and Cicero, though he disliked it as applied
  to himself, could applaud it loudly where a Gracchus or a Caesar was the
  victim. Assassination is a form of crime which has always been especially
  characteristic of oligarchic manners.</p>

  <p>The triumph of the reactionary party was the signal for insurrectionary
  movements in several parts of Italy. We may be sure that Catiline was in
  correspondence with the insurgent leaders, just as in B C. 91 Drusus had been
  in correspondence with Pompaedius Silo. But it is evident that he was very
  reluctant to cast in his lot openly with the insurrection. Drusus, if he had
  not been assassinated, might have been, driven ultimately to take refuge at
  Corfinium. The personal prowess of Catiline, and the devotion of his friends,
  probably saved him from assassination, though Cicero distinctly states that
  he would have had it done if he had thought that his single death would have
  broken up the revolutionary party.* On the other hand, such was still his
  popularity in Rome, that to get up a riot and lynch him and his friends, as
  had been done in the cases of the Gracchi and Saturninus, was too dangerous
  an experiment. Cicero therefore used every effort to drive him into the
  disaffected districts, and when the insurrection broke out in Etruria, on
  October 27th, Catiline's position at Rome became full of danger. Every one
  knew this relations with Manlius, the leader of the insurgents; and many who
  had sympathised with the wrongs and sufferings of an oppressed class, would
  range themselves on the side of authority when it came to civil war. The
  moneyed men particularly took fright at the spectre of communism.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* In L. Catilinam, iv. 12.</p>

  <p>Cicero now saw his opportunity, and summoned the senate for November 8th.
  On that day the Equites&mdash;that is to say, the moneyed men and nobles not
  in the senate&mdash;appeared in arms to overawe the populace, and Cicero,
  emboldened at the sight, delivered his celebrated "Quousque tandem" oration,
  in which he denounced Catiline as a public enemy The popular leader
  endeavoured to reply, asserting his attachment to his country, and appealing
  to his whole life, from his youth up, for the proof of it. But the nobles
  drowned his voice with their clamour; and his patience at length forsaking
  him, he flung out of the senate house, exclaiming that he was being driven to
  ruin by his enemies, but that if he must fall he would not fall alone.
  Returning to his house, he recommended his wife and daughter to Catulus, the
  head of the aristocratic party, in a simple and dignified letter, which, as
  the Emperor Napoleon says, offers a striking contrast to the passion of
  Cicero. His conscience, he says, does not accuse him; he has endeavoured to
  act within the constitution; but he has been crushed by a conspiracy of
  unworthy men. Even while he writes he learns that the assassins are on his
  track; he has now no choice but to put himself at the head of the
  insurrection. The same night he left Rome for Etruria.</p>

  <p>The nobles had thus gained their point. Catiline was a rebel, and an
  outlaw. "Les absents ont toujours tort" was true in a peculiar sense in Roman
  politics. Such was the veneration for Rome, the seat of
  empire&mdash;"Capitoli immobile saxum"&mdash;that in the civil wars the party
  who yielded possession of it were regarded, and regarded themselves, as
  rebels and enemies of the state. The flight of Catiline was followed by a
  proclamation offering large rewards to any one who should give information as
  to the plot. It is remarked as strange by the historians, that no such
  information was obtained. The fact is that there was no plot. . There was a
  large political party, numbered by tens of thousands, and its leaders were in
  correspondence with the insurgents in Etruria. An exact parallel is to be
  found in our own revolution. Pym and Hampden openly headed a powerful party.
  But of course they had their private consultations, and no one doubts that
  they were in correspondence with the Scotch insurgents. That there was an
  organisation in Rome for the purpose of burning, slaying, and plundering is a
  supposition too ridiculous to be seriously discussed.</p>

  <p>The leadership of the Catilinarian party in the city now devolved on P.
  Lentulus, an elderly man, who had been consul eight years before. He was in
  no respect equal to the task, but age and official rank always conferred
  precedence amongst Romans.* The first step of this man, his negotiation with
  the Allobroges, ruined his cause. The sword of Caesar had not yet relieved
  Rome from the constant dread of the Gaulish avalanche impending over Italy.
  Once suspected of inviting the barbarian, the revolutionary leaders were
  fatally discredited. Even the mob, according to Sallust, turned against them.
  The famous debate of December 5th shows that the government felt itself much
  stronger. Even Caesar, while courageously protesting against an illegal
  sentence, did not dare to extenuate the guilt of the criminals. If the nobles
  hung back at first, it was because they hoped that their hireling, Cicero,
  would take the responsibility and odium upon himself. This, however, he was
  determined not to do, and their courage was at length screwed to the
  sticking-place by the cynical frankness of Cato, who told them that if they
  wished to preserve their palaces, villas, and other luxuries, they must take
  their share of the work.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* This is one among many reasons why Caesar could not
  have been an influential leader before the affair of Catiline.</p>

  <p>The execution of Lentulus and his companions was a barefaced and
  deliberate violation of the most solemn article of the Roman constitution,
  which provided that no citizen should be put to death without an appeal to
  the people. It was much as if Charles I. had succeeded in arresting the five
  members, and had gone on to execute them by a vote of the House of Lords or
  the Privy Council.</p>

  <p>The name of Caesar had not been mentioned by the Allobroges. But some of
  the wire-pullers of the aristocratic party, particularly Catulus ("Hoc verum
  est dixit enim Q. Catulus!"), who thought that advantage should be taken of
  the excitement to clear away all undesirable persons, urged Cicero, and even
  offered him money, to make the Allobroges, or some other informer, accuse
  him.* Cicero, however, thinking, no doubt, that he had done a good-day's work
  for his patrons, declined to run himself into more danger.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "Q. Catulus et C. Piso neque pretio neque gratia
  Ciceronem impellere quivere, uti per Allobroges aut per alum indicem C.
  Caesar falso nominaretur."&mdash;Sallust, De Cat. Conj. 49.</p>

  <p>The little army of Catiline died round their leader like the Spartan Three
  Hundred round Leonidas at Thermopylae. Even Sallust cannot withhold his
  admiration, and rises into a genuine enthusiasm as he describes the closing
  scene. "All wounded in front; not a man taken alive; Catiline himself gasping
  out his life ringed round with corpses of his foemen." The world has
  generally a generous word for the memory of a brave man dying for his cause,
  be that cause what it will. But for Catiline none. The execrations of
  nineteen centuries lie piled on the grave of the successor of the Gracchi and
  the forerunner of Caesar. It is not good to make a literary man your
  enemy.</p>

  <p>Catiline and Cicero were not merely political opponents. The natures of
  the two men were thoroughly antipathetic. Cicero thought that society existed
  for the glory of clever writers and eloquent speakers. The strength of
  character and prudence which make the practical statesman were in his eyes
  very vulgar qualities. He shrank with dislike and fear from a resolute man.
  He reverenced constitutional forms as framed in the interest of talkers. His
  idea of good government was a state of things where talkers should always
  have full swing, and be listened to with respect, while rough practical men
  should humbly do their bidding. If he had lived in our time he would have
  written in the <i>Saturday</i>, and had his views about the representation of
  minorities.</p>

  <p>Catiline, on the contrary, was the man of action, who would rather see a
  thing done than hear it talked about. Not deficient in intellect&mdash;far
  from it; but with an intellect of the practical sort, quick, decisive,
  intuitive. He looked on Cicero as a coward and babbler. It made his gorge
  rise to see the complacent orator mount into the rostra and go through his
  feats. And then to think that this windbag, this prating knave, "that never
  set a squadron in the field nor the division of a battle knows, more than a.
  spinster," has talked himself into the first magistracy of a military
  commonwealth, while I, Lucius Catilina, a soldier every inch of me, with
  every masculine quality, with a dauntless heart and a ready hand, with a
  special gift for ruling my fellows, must stand aside, year after year,
  because my family has gone down in the world, and I have no stake in the
  country!</p>

  <p>An unequal struggle. The man of letters has had the ear of the world ever
  since, and has told his story without contradiction. More than that, the
  literary men have stood by one another, as they always do&mdash;like
  game-preservers or Whitechapel thieves; and each in turn has pointed his
  stale moral with the fate of the unlucky wight who dared to beard the
  patriarch of their tribe. <i>&Omicron;&upsilon;&delta;  &alpha;&rho;&alpha; 
  &omicron;&iota;  &tau;&iota;&sigmaf; 
  &alpha;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;&tau;&eta;&tau;&iota;  &gamma;&epsilon; 
  &pi;&alpha;&rho;&epsilon;&sigma;&tau;&eta; .</i> But the true character of
  the Roman revolution and of Roman parties has of late years been much better
  understood. As the greatness and goodness of Caesar were more ungrudgingly
  recognised, the character and aims of his precursors could not fail to meet
  with fairer treatment. The first writer who has thought it necessary to bring
  his account of Catiline into some accordance with common sense and
  probability is, as might have been expected, not a literary man, but a
  practical statesman. But the Emperor Napoleon's determination to make Caesar
  a hero from his cradle has to some extent led him astray in his estimate of
  Catiline. I will not affirm that I have completely succeeded in painting the
  man and the situation as they were, for the attempt to restore a likeness
  from a comparison of caricatures must always be attended with more or less
  uncertainty. But if I have done any injustice, it has not been to the Roman
  oligarchy, but to Catiline.</p>

  <p class="first">GROSS as are the improbabilities in the vulgar account of
  the so-called conspiracy of Catiline, the commonly received narrative of the
  events which followed it, down to the return of Cicero from exile, is even
  more incoherent and insulting to common sense. We are asked to believe that,
  stained with the blood of the popular leaders, Cicero was respected and
  beloved by the vast majority of Roman citizens, and that the troubles which
  subsequently befell him were simply the result of a personal quarrel with
  Clodius. To maintain this paradox&mdash;for a paradox it must appear to any
  one accustomed to reflect on political phenomena&mdash;the <i>ex parte</i>
  statements of the least trustworthy of ancient writers have beén adopted by
  modern historians as sober truth; his carefully cooked narratives have been
  cooked over again till the basis of fact has entirely disappeared; his
  glaring self-contradictions have been harmonised by arbitrary assumptions, or
  glossed over with unmeaning rhetoric; and that most constant and calculable
  of forces, popular sentiment, has been treated as though it were more
  unreasonable, inscrutable, and fortuitous than the whims of a capricious
  individual. The origin of this extraordinary conspiracy to disguise an
  interesting period of history, is partly to be looked for in the credulous
  unphilosophical spirit, the ignorance of practical politics, the conservative
  tone of mind, and the literary <i>esprit de corps</i> too common among
  historians. But it is partly due to another cause. The modern writer,
  accustomed to the voluminous materials from which modern history is drawn,
  frets at the obscure and meagre narratives which have descended to us from
  the ancient world. He is not satisfied unless he can produce a full and vivid
  representation of events, with ample details as to the actors, and warm,
  sensational colouring for his scenes. He has therefore a strong temptation to
  believe the most copious and graphic of his authorities, and to shut his eyes
  to awkward symptoms of mendacity. He cannot make up his mind to confess that
  we know very little about the details of ancient history. Professor Kingsley
  tells him that "history is the history of men and women, and of nothing
  else;" so if portraits of "men and women" cannot be procured, he must make
  shift with caricatures.</p>

  <p>To determine the broad features of ancient history is not difficult to the
  properly trained observer; and more than those broad features the philosopher
  does not desire to know. We might be well content, therefore, to leave the
  trivial details about "men and women" to scholars, gossips, and antiquaries,
  if they could indulge their taste without a serious perversion of such
  important passages in history as the Roman Revolution. There we must resist
  them, and establish the truth, even though in doing so we have to shock an
  amiable spirit of hero-worship. I would be the last to deny that the dead
  have a right to justice at the hands of posterity. "Si l'on ne doit aux morts
  que la vérité, au moins leur doit-on la vérité." The man who would
  consciously libel the memory of a Greek or Roman statesman for the sake of
  strengthening some favourite theory of his own, merits the gravest
  reprobation. Only, in reviewing the past, as in ordering the present, it is
  too often forgotten that masses of men have a claim to justice no less
  well-founded than individuals; and that tirades against the corrupt mob, and
  sneers at a fickle populace, are, if ill-founded, none the less reprehensible
  and offensive because the humble individuals who composed those aggregates
  sleep in forgotten graves. I protest that I have a genuine sympathy for all
  that is amiable and attractive in the character of Cicero. But I cannot
  forget that he took the wrong side in the politics of his country&mdash;nay,
  that he hired himself to do the work of a vile party. To conceal this is to
  do injustice to thousands of men who might not have been able to work a rule
  of three sum for Mr. Clay,* but whose political instinct told them where the
  shoe pinched and how it might be eased.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* A qualification for the franchise proposed when this
  essay was written.</p>

  <p>I propose on the present occasion to show that the lower orders of Rome,
  who had loved and trusted Catiline, exhibited a consistent and determined
  hostility to the man who had hunted their hero to death to please the
  oligarchy; that they seized the first opportunity to visit him with condign
  punishment; that the subsequent reversal of the sentence was carried in the
  teeth of their opposition; and finally that the prime agent in a most just
  retribution was not Clodius, but Cesar.</p>

  <p>The destruction of Catiline had been a triumph for the oligarchy over the
  democracy. It had all the marks of a genuine <i>coup d'état</i> of the old
  sort, such as those which had disposed of the Gracchi and Drusus. The nobles
  had gained it themselves without the detested aid of a great soldier. There
  never yet was an oligarchy, however rotten and tottering, which did not think
  its chances of permanence fair; and the senatorial party, without one able
  politician amongst them, pleased themselves with the belief that they had won
  a victory more satisfactory than even that of Sulla. There was, indeed, a
  great soldier campaigning in the East, at the thought of whose return they
  could not but feel rather nervous. But the hotter spirits were prepared to
  defy even Pompeius. The Senate, they told one another, could hold its own,
  whether against military tyrants or turbulent demagogues; the day for both,
  in fact, was gone by; the wealthy middle class had at last made common cause
  with the aristocracy; the alliance had been sealed in the blood of Lentulus
  and Cethegus; property and respectability must in the long run be too strong
  for the mob. As Victor Hugo says, "C'est une chose étrange, que la facilité
  avec laquelle les coquins croient que le succès leur est dû."</p>

  <p>It was true there were symptoms far from reassuring. The populace was not
  cowed. When Cicero was about to make the usual harangue to the people on
  laying down his office, he was silenced by the tribune Metellus Nepos, a
  recognised agent of Pompeius, on the ground that he had executed citizens
  without a trial. Baulked of his speech, he cried aloud that he had saved his
  country, and he assures us that his exclamation was received with
  sympathising cheers. That the nobles standing round him exerted their lungs
  is probable enough; but as he seems not to have ventured to address a popular
  assembly again, down to the time of his exile, it is reasonable to infer that
  other and less agreeable sounds reached his ears.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* There is only one passage in his correspondence during
  this period which may perhaps imply that he had addressed the people. This
  was on the agrarian law of Flavius in 60, which Cicero supported against the
  will of the Senate to please Pompeius. Ad. Att., i. 19. Taking such a line he
  would perhaps be tolerated.</p>

  <p>I may say here, once for all, that I cannot attach any weight to the
  statements of Greek writers who lived two centuries later, and followed
  Cicero as blindly as his modern biographers. Besides, if Plutarch and Appian
  are quoted in support of the applause, I am entitled to point to Dion, who
  says that <i>the people</i> would not allow Cicero to speak.* From Cicero
  himself what account could we expect? Does he, on any single occasion, admit
  that he was hissed?</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Dion., xxxvii. 38.</p>

  <p>Conscious of the illegality of the punishment inflicted on Catiline's
  friends, the Senate had passed an act of indemnity for all the agents in that
  violent deed, and had resolved that any person impeaching them for it should
  be held as a public enemy&mdash;in other words, served the same. Such a
  resolution was in itself utterly illegal, and Metellus announced his
  intention of proposing to the people a bill for recalling Pompeius with his
  army to restore the violated constitution. But he was not allowed to address
  the people. Cato placed his hand over the tribune's mouth when he tried to
  speak. A riot naturally ensued; the Senate eagerly proclaimed martial law,
  and the consul Murena "took instantly a body of soldiers into the Forum and
  restored order."* The Senate then proceeded to depose Metellus from the
  tribunate and Cesar from the praetorship&mdash;an assumption of power utterly
  unknown to the constitution; upon which Metellus thought it prudent to make
  his escape to his patron, Pompeius. When Pompeius and Caesar are accused of
  violating the constitution, let us remember that it had already been torn to
  shreds by the oligarchy.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Forsyth's "Life of Cicero," i. 136.</p>

  <p>The proceedings above-mentioned belong probably to the first month of the
  year 62. It was on the night of the first of May* that Clodius was caught in
  woman's clothes in the house of Caesar, where the Roman ladies were
  celebrating the rites of the Bona Dea, from which all males were jealously
  excluded.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* This is the date expressly assigned by Ovid (Fasti v.
  147), for the festival of the Bona Dea. No statement to the contrary is to be
  found in any ancient author. Yet the crime of Clodius is placed by all modern
  historians in December, 62. Why? Because no fuss seems to have been made
  about it till the beginning of 61, and the first notice of it is found in a
  letter of Cicero to Atticus (i. 12) of Jan. 1, in that year. Drumann (ii.
  204) says that Cicero there speaks of it as of recent occurrence. But his
  words have not necessarily such a meaning: "P. Clodium, Appii F., credo te
  audisse, cum veste muliebri deprehensum, etc." If the crime had received
  little attention during eight months and was now being raked up for a
  political purpose, it is not unnatural that Cicero should refer to it in such
  terms. It must be remembered that there is no letter to Atticus extant for
  the year 62. Catiline was not prosecuted for the murder of Marius
  Gratidianus, nor Rabirius for that of Saturninus, till much longer periods
  had elapsed.<br>
  <br>
  Of the other passages referred to by Drumann (ad Att. xv. 25; v. 21; vi. 1.),
  the first proves nothing one way or the other, and the last two seem to me
  rather to point to May as the date of the festival. His suggestion that
  Augustus altered it to that month is unsupported by any authority.</p>

  <p>What the political career of Clodius had been up to this time is not
  recorded. He was still a very young man, and had been much absent from Rome
  on service in Asia and Gaul. It seems, however, to be agreed that he was a
  prominent member of the democratic party, nor is there any other way of
  accounting either for the extraordinary <i>acharnement</i> of the nobles, or
  the interest the people took in his cause. Cicero's assertion that he owed
  his popularity to this outrage is a calumny against the Roman democracy, none
  the less disgraceful because it is ridiculous. When Catiline took up arms,
  Clodius left the city for the purpose of joining him, but changed his mind,
  and returned.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Asconius, in Ciceronis Milonianam, 55.</p>

  <p>He afterwards (if Plutarch is to be believed) formed one of Cicero's
  body-guard at the execution of Catiline's friends, probably for the same
  reason that Peter warmed himself at the High Priest's fire. He was an
  impetuous eloquent, and dissolute young man, though probably not more
  dissolute than a hundred other young noblemen who do not happen to have
  offended Cicero. With his peculiar reasons for hating Clodius, it is not
  strange that Cicero, who could touch so playfully on the debaucheries and
  Mohock pranks of his favourite Caelius, should never mention the affair of
  the Bona Dea without a hurricane of strong epithets. But why, in the name of
  all that is genuine and sincere, should learned and reverend gentlemen of the
  present day work themselves into a passion and pump out floods of moral
  indignation, because in the year 62 before Christ a young Roman did not
  believe that he would be struck blind if he peeped at the rites of the Bona
  Dea?</p>

  <p>It seems to me that if Roman manners had allowed Caesar, or any other male
  relation of the ladies compromised, to give the offender a sound
  horsewhipping, the requirements of the case would have been amply satisfied.
  No man of any education and culture believed in these ancient superstitions.
  The most religously inclined were Deists. Undoubtedly there was still much
  superstition among the vulgar, and the nobility tried to work upon it. Still,
  if Clodius had not been politically obnoxious, his affair would never have
  been exalted into a <i>cause célèbre</i>. As it was, no notice was taken of
  it for seven months. It happens that we know nothing about the later half of
  the year 62, owing to a blank in Cicero's correspondence, or we should
  probably find that Clodius had given some fresh offence to the oligarchy.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of 61 the Senate determined to take the matter up, and
  directed the consuls to propose a bill to the people for bringing Clodius to
  trial, not before a jury selected by lot in the ordinary way, but before a
  jury nominated by the Praetor. I do not know that it can be ascertained who
  the Praetor for this year was. But remembering the violent proceedings of the
  year before, we are not surprised to learn that, with the exception of the
  consul Piso and the tribune Fufius, all the magistrates of 61 were in the
  interest of the Senate.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Cicero, Ad. Att., i. 14.</p>

  <p>Here, therefore, was a manifest attempt to crush a political opponent by
  means of a packed jury. The consuls, as directed, proposed the bill, though
  Piso did not conceal his disapproval of it.* The popular feeling, as might
  have been expected, was strongly against it. Cicero says it was opposed by
  the gang of Catiline and the agents of Clodius (grex Catilinae&mdash;operae
  Clodianae), and that voting tickets in the negative alone were furnished. It
  is an old story. Those who like may believe it. There are people to this day
  who assure you that Napoleon III. obtained his throne by tampering with the
  ballot-box.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Piso autem consul lator rogations idem erat
  dissuasor.&mdash;Cicero Ad. Att., i. 14.</p>

  <p>When the nobles saw how things were going, they broke up the assembly,
  apparently by violence;* and the Senate met to deliberate. After an exciting
  debate it was resolved that the consuls should again propose the bill, and
  that no public business should be transacted till it was carried. Such an
  outrageous resolution illustrates the spirit of these Roman Conservatives,
  and proves that they were animated by some stronger motive than a desire to
  punish an offence which for seven months they had not thought worth
  noticing.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Concursu optimatum comitia
  dimittuntur.&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.</p>

  <p>At this point it becomes necessary to lay before the reader the vulgar
  account in order that its irrationality may be clearly understood. I give it
  in the words of the latest biographer of Cicero. "Hortensius, however,
  fearing that the tribune Fufius Calenus would interpose his veto if the bill
  was passed by the people, and so render it a dead letter,* proposed that
  Fufius himself should bring forward a bill declaring, like the other bill,
  that Clodius's offence was sacrilege, but providing that the jury should be
  chosen by <i>lot</i> out of the <i>decuriae</i>.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Observe the coolness of the assumption that the bill
  would have passed. And Mr. Forsyth ought to know that a tribune's veto was
  interposed, not after a bill had passed, but before it was put to the
  vote.</p>

  <p>This was intended as a compromise, for it limited the number of persons
  out of whom the jury could be formed, and so diminished the chances of having
  a needy and corruptible set, and yet preserved at the same time the principle
  of fairness in not selecting the names. But Hortensius felt so confident that
  Clodius must be convicted, that he was indifferent as to what kind of
  tribunal tried him."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Forsyth's "Life of Cicero," i. 151.</p>

  <p>If an historian can explain a difficult, let him do so, and we will thank
  him. If he cannot explain it, let him state the difficulty and leave it, and
  we will also thank him. What I cannot understand is the satisfaction some
  people seem to find in plastering over a difficulty with words, and affecting
  to give a solution which they must be aware is no solution at all. Neither
  Mr. Forsyth nor any one else, as far as I am aware, has given an explanation
  of this trial which a serious inquirer can accept. The statement that the
  bill of Fufius declared Clodius's offence to be sacrilege is not only
  absolutely unsupported by any ancient author, but is, when one comes to think
  of it, unmeaning nonsense. No one disputed that it was sacrilege, or rather
  "incestum." Equally untrue is it that the bill of Fufius introduced any
  novelty whatever into the constitution of the jury. It was the ordinary
  practice "that the jury should be chosen by lot out of the decuriae." I defy
  any one to show that Clodius was not tried exactly like any other
  criminal.</p>

  <p>And yet that there was a compromise is evident. In what did this
  compromise consist? I make bold to say that the historians have hitherto gone
  upon an entirely wrong scent.</p>

  <p>In the early period of the Roman commonwealth there were no permanent
  courts of justice. A criminal was tried before the whole people, acting in
  its legislative capacity, either in the <i>comitia centuriata</i> or
  <i>tributa</i>, the difference being that a consul or praetor presided in the
  former, a tribune in the latter. Each sentence was in fact a <i>law</i> for
  that special occasion. The first modification of this usage was the
  appointment of a committee of the people to try an offender under the
  presidency of a praetor (<i>Quaestio</i>). A further modification was when
  permanent machinery of this kind was provided for trying certain classes of
  crime (<i>Quaestiones perpetuae</i>.) All these <i>Quaestiones perpetuae</i>
  had been appointed by the people assembled in <i>comitia tributa</i>, and
  being regarded as mere committees of that assembly, they could not inflict
  capital punishment, a prerogative of which the <i>comitia tributa</i> had
  been deprived at the time of the Decemviral legislation. The <i>comitia
  centuriata</i> (or a committee of it, had such existed) could sentence to
  death. But during the later period of the commonwealth the <i>centuriata</i>
  had practically become obsolete except for the election of magistrates. All
  important business was transacted in the <i>tributa</i>, of which, as I have
  said, the <i>Quaestiones perpetuae</i> were offshoots.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See the lucid and philosophical treatment of this
  subject in Mr. Maine's Ancient Law, chap. x.</p>

  <p>Now, when the oligarchy wanted to try Clodius, I should be glad to know
  before what court they were to bring him. There might be clear laws against
  <i>incestum</i>. But unless <i>incestum</i> came under one of those classes
  of crime for which <i>Quaestiones</i> had been established, there was no
  means of setting the law in operation. There were <i>Quaestiones perpetuae de
  Repetundis, de Sicariis et Veneficis, de Parricidio</i>, etc., but none <i>de
  Incesto</i>. It was a <i>casus omissus</i>. On such a difficulty arising, the
  ordinary course would have been for a tribune, upon the requisition of the
  Senate, to have proposed the necessary law to the <i>comitia tributa</i> for
  the creation of a new <i>Quaestio de Incesto</i>. When the law was carried,
  the usual number of jurymen (<i>judices</i>), probably seventy or eighty,
  would have been selected by lot from the <i>decurice</i>, and after the usual
  challenges on the part of accuser and defendant (<i>rejectiones</i>), the
  remainder would have been impanelled, under the presidency of the praetor, to
  try the accused.</p>

  <p>Such would have been the ordinary procedure. But I imagine that on this
  occasion the oligarchy, in the spirit of presumptuous violence which they had
  manifested since the <i>coup d'état</i>, were bent on nothing less than
  galvanising the <i>comitia centuriata</i> into a new life for the purpose of
  creating by its instrumentality a <i>Quaestio</i> to try Clodius. They
  promised themselves two advantages from this course: the first was, that in
  creating a new <i>Quaestio</i>, a new method of selecting a jury might be
  introduced; the other was, that a <i>Quaestio</i> emanating from the
  <i>comitia centuriata</i> would have the power of sentencing to death. It is
  astonishing that amidst all the discussion about this celebrated trial, no
  one should have drawn attention to the significant fact that, though all the
  tribunes except Fufius were on their side, the Senate direct the
  <i>consuls</i> to move the bill, and that after one failure it is still the
  <i>consuls</i> whom they require to renew the attempt; and this, though one
  of these magistrates was doing all in his power to defeat the measure which
  he was obliged in his official capacity to introduce. Why was not a tribune
  employed in the usual way? There can be but one answer to the question. A
  tribune could not convoke or set in motion the <i>comitia centuriata</i>, and
  it was by that assembly that the Senate was determined to act. It is true
  neither Cicero nor any other authority mentions that the bill was moved in
  the <i>comitia centuriata</i>. I presume that for a Roman such information
  was not necessary, because to tell him that a bill was moved by a consul was
  equivalent to telling him that it was moved in the <i>comitia centuriata</i>.
  This point being established, I can see no more probable motives for the
  policy of the Senate than those I have suggested above; the desire, namely,
  to pack a jury, and to obtain a sentence of death. There were, it is true,
  features in the organisation of the <i>comitia centuriata</i> which made it
  somewhat less democratic than the <i>tributa</i>; its origin and traditions
  were less offensive to the oligarchy; but I cannot for a moment suppose that
  they would have convulsed Rome for so trifling an advantage.</p>

  <p>After resolving, then, to propose the consular bill a second time, the
  Senate had at the last moment flinched from the dead lock that would have
  ensued if Fufius had met its resolution with the tribunitian veto. Fufius
  undertook to bring in a bill himself in the ordinary way&mdash;that is, in
  the <i>comitia tributa</i>&mdash;for constituting a <i>Quaestio</i> to try
  Clodius. With this compromise the Senate was forced to content itself. The
  attempt to institute a <i>Quaestio</i> emanating from the <i>comitia
  centuriata</i>, the power of packing a jury, the satisfaction of executing
  Clodius&mdash;these much-desired objects it had to forego. But as the facts
  charged against Clodius could not be seriously disputed, as the jury would be
  certain to contain many of his political opponents, as superstitious feelings
  might influence many who were his political supporters, the Senate counted
  almost with certainty upon obtaining a verdict of guilty, and the infliction
  of a serious penalty.</p>

  <p>The court was constituted, and the trial was conducted, I repeat it, by
  the ordinary rules. L. Lentulus for the prosecution, and Curio <i>père</i>
  for the defence, challenged as many jurors as the law allowed. At last a jury
  of fifty-six was impanelled. Clodius set up an alibi, which Cicero was called
  by the prosecution to disprove.* Dio Cassius tells us that he was tried, not
  only for the affair of the Bona Dea, but for mutinous conduct when serving in
  Asia, and for incest with his sister; which evidently only means that the
  accuser, after the usual fashion, raked up all the stories, true or false,
  that were current about him. Eventually he was acquitted by a majority of
  six.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Niebuhr, in his lectures (vol. iii. p. 28 of the
  English edition), says that Clodius "had the impudence to call Cicero as his
  witness," but that Cicero "not only bore witness against Clodius, but gave
  free expression to his indignation, and said things which would necessarily
  have brought about the condemnation of Clodius, had he not purchased his
  acquittal." This is all a pure invention of Niebuhr's. Cicero, writing
  immediately after the trial to Atticus (i. 16), expressly tells him that he
  had said as little as he could: "Contraxi vela, neque dixi quidquam pro
  testimonio nisi quod erat ita notum atque testatum ut non possem
  praeteriree." Niebuhr tells us that he loves Cicero as if he had known him,
  and that he had obtained a thorough insight into his character by studying
  that of Frederic Jacobi. Perhaps he found out what Cicero said on the trial
  in some similar way.</p>

  <p>Cicero, of course, says that the majority were bribed; and, looking at the
  notoriety of the facts charged against Clodius, historians have
  unhesitatingly accepted his statement, even to its most incredible and
  disgusting details. For my part, I see no necessity for such an hypothesis;
  and I need hardly say that in this and similar cases Cicero's assertions are
  worthy of notice just so far they are probable, and no further.</p>

  <p>In an English court of justice every effort is made to narrow down the
  discussion to a simple issue of fact. Every irrelevant allegation on either
  side is jealously excluded by the presiding judge. Usage and public opinion
  prescribe a course to the jury from which they cannot deviate; though even in
  England, on political trials, the animus of jurymen leads them sometimes to
  disregard the evidence. But at Rome, a State trial, though technically
  relating to a specified act, virtually dealt with the whole life of the
  accused. Nor was this all. The jury looked on it as their duty to take into
  consideration other circumstances which we should deem still more foreign to
  the question. Among these notoriously was the political bearing their verdict
  would have. A Roman jury never forgot that it was in some sort a committee of
  the Legislative Assembly. No one can admit more fully than Cicero himself
  that they not only were at liberty, but were bound to let such considerations
  weigh with them. In his oration for Flaccus, he says:&mdash;"Jurymen of good
  sense and high character have always, in giving their verdict, taken into
  consideration what was demanded by the interests of the community, public
  welfare, and the exigencies of State."* Again, in his oration for Murena, he
  calls on the jury to acquit his client of bribery, because a verdict of
  guilty will give encouragement to the partisans of Catiline.**</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Semper graves et sapientes judices in rebus judicandis,
  quid utilitas civitatis, quid communis salus, quid reipublicae tempora
  poscerent, cogitaverunt.&mdash;Pro Flacco, xxxix. Lord Ellenborough, in
  charging the jury on Peltier's trial, had the indecency to tell them that "he
  trusted their verdict would strengthen the relations by which the interests
  of this country were connected with those of France."&mdash;State Trials,
  xxviii. 618.</p>

  <p class="footnote">** Pro Murena, xxxvii.&mdash;xl.</p>

  <p>But there was yet another reason why a Roman jury assumed the right of
  acquitting an accused person, even when the specified charge was proved
  beyond doubt. Their sentence could not be revised or modified. The
  prerogative of mercy, which with us belongs to the crown, at Rome rested with
  the jury. The functions and responsibilities which in England are divided
  between the jury, the judge, and the crown, at Rome devolved on the jury
  alone. This important fact appears to be entirely overlooked by historians,
  who moralise so loftily on the corruption of Roman courts of justice. They
  might much more reasonably assume the depravity of the Home Secretary when he
  reprieves a criminal, after a verdict of guilty has actually been found and
  sentence pronounced.</p>

  <p>Now let us place ourselves for a moment in the position of a citizen of
  the popular party who finds himself designated by lot to serve on the jury of
  Clodius. He feels that this prosecution has been commenced solely with the
  view of ruining one of the prominent champions of his party. He knows, on the
  one hand, that there is not an educated man in Rome who believes in the
  existence of the Bona Dea; and, on the other, that chastity is a very
  uncommon virtue among young patricians. He remembers that this very act was
  for seven months treated as a matter of no consequence. He has looked on
  while every art was tried to take the investigation out of the hands of a
  regular tribunal, and commit it to a jury specially packed by a tool of the
  oligarchy. Two years have not elapsed since he saw his political leaders put
  to death in open contempt of law by the same men who are now availing
  themselves of the forms of law to crush Clodius. The prosecutors, by
  arraigning the whole life of the accused, virtually place this issue before
  him:&mdash;Do you think Clodius so bad and dangerous a citizen that the first
  opportunity ought to be seized for punishing him? To such a question, the
  citizen who had selected Clodius as his political leader could return but one
  answer. As far as I can see, if I had been on that jury, my answer would have
  been the same. I would no more have sacrificed Clodius to that lawless and
  malignant oligarchy, than I would have given the late Lord Campbell an
  opportunity for stretching the meaning of a statute to hang Dr. Bernard.</p>

  <p>The alibi raised by Clodius merely amounted to a plea of not guilty. It
  was not believed, or probably intended to be believed, by anybody. The object
  of calling Cicero, of all men in the world, to disprove it, is evident. It
  was hoped that a sensational scene might be got up by producing him in court.
  In a letter to Atticus, full of the most laughable vanity he asserts that
  there was such a scene, and that the jury were evidently ready to lay down
  their lives for him. Knowing as we do from his own words what the complexion
  of the majority of this jury was, we learn what to think of these
  certificates of popularity which the orator is always transmitting to his
  correspondents. Probably the twenty-five Conservatives were noisily
  demonstrative, thereby not improving the temper of their thirty-one
  Democratic colleagues. Cicero tells Atticus that he lost all interest in the
  matter after the idea of proceeding by a consular bill was abandoned, and
  that on the trial he said as little as he could help, and nothing but what
  had been amply established by other witnesses. This statement has been
  overlooked by Mr. Forsyth, who suggests that Cicero may have been the only
  man in Rome who could disprove the alibi.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Clodius pleaded that he had been at Interamna, fifty
  miles from Rome, at the time of the outrage; whereas he had called on Cicero
  that very morning.</p>

  <p>The fact is, that all the writers who have treated this question are
  possessed with the idea that the evidence given by Cicero on this trial was
  the cause of the ill-will borne to him by Clodius, and that the enmity of
  Clodius was the cause of Cicero's banishment; both of which suppositions are
  entirely untrue. Clodius knew that Cicero had come forward, not to give
  evidence, which was quite superfluous, but from a restless itching to be
  conspicuous, and a desire to please the oligarchy. The incident was no doubt
  irritating to a defendant, but it weighed for very little in the war which
  followed. Cicero nowhere, as far as I know, attributes his troubles to it. In
  fact, though the trial had taken place in the spring of 61, we do not find in
  his correspondence anything to show that he anticipated an attack from
  Clodius till the end of 59. That during all this time a bitter personal
  hostility was growing up between the two orators is of course admitted. But
  it did not result from the trial. It arose from the speeches subsequently
  made by Cicero in the Senate, in which, as he frequently informs Atticus with
  much glee, he has been "smashing" Clodius (Clodium praesentem fregi in
  senatu). When the moment came for the orator himself to be smashed, Clodius
  was naturally ready enough to be the instrument. But Cicero's fall was due to
  causes much more serious and deep-rooted than his feud with Clodius, causes
  which I shall now proceed to explain.</p>

  <p>The <i>coup d'état</i> of 63 had been made possible by the absence of the
  great fighting man in the East, and by the alliance between the governing and
  moneyed classes, for effecting which Cicero takes so much, credit to himself.
  But both these conditions of success soon passed away. Towards the end of 62
  Pompeius returned. Every one felt that the reaction was over when he set foot
  in Italy. That he would resume his old policy of clipping the wings of the
  oligarchy seems to have been looked for as a matter of course. The only doubt
  was whether he would not lead his army straight to Rome, and call the Senate
  to account for the murder of the Catilinarian leaders and the illegal
  deposition of Caesar and Metellus Nepos. But Pompeius was a slow-moving
  politician. His vanity was never disturbed by the fear of a rival. He felt
  himself master of the situation, and rather took a delight in dallying with
  it. We may safely affirm that to have both parties in the State larding him
  with flattery and hanging on every ambiguous word that fell from his lips was
  more exquisitely delicious to a man of his paltry character than the actual
  exercise of government. He avoided giving any decided opinion on the trial of
  Clodius, and during the rest of the year 61, though steadily paying court to
  the populace, and taking care to celebrate his triumph with unprecedented
  splendour, he took no direct part in politics. The consequence v as that the
  nobles, forgetting their first awe, began to hold him rather cheap, and
  showed an indisposition to ratify his acts in the East, or to provide
  allotments of land for his veterans. Before the end of the year he had found
  out his mistake. The nobility were not yet sufficiently humbled for his
  purpose. He would have preferred, if it had been possible, to step serenely
  into a quasi-regal position by the acquiescence of the nobility, rather than
  to storm it indecorously at the head of the mob: But the mountain would not
  come to Mahomet; so there was nothing for it but to ally himself with the
  sworn enemies of the Senate, and revert to the policy of his first
  consulship.</p>

  <p>His colleague in that consulship had been Crassus. They had signalized
  their year of office by upsetting the oligarchic constitution framed by
  Sulla. It was to Crassus he now again looked for support. The influence of
  the celebrated millionaire naturally lay with the moneyed men, and although
  Cicero affected to be the representative and patron of that class we may be
  sure they looked on him much as the hop-growers look on Sir Fitzroy
  Kelly.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* At the time when this essay was first published Sir F.
  Kelly was the parliamentary champion of the hop-growers.</p>

  <p>Their real representative was Crassus. Now it happened that in 61 the
  Senate, stupidly elated by its victory over Catiline, and beginning to
  undervalue Pompeius, had mortally offended the moneyed men, and Cicero was
  moaning over the dissolution of the alliance which he had taken such pains to
  patch up. Crassus had stood by his business friends, and could now depend
  upon them to back him in an assault upon the Senate.</p>

  <p>Cesar was at this time in Spain as pro-Praetor, and in his absence Clodius
  was the most prominent leader of the popular party. Conscious that his
  peculiar vocation was to sway a mob, Clodius had decided to divest himself of
  his rank as a patrician, which prevented him from filling the tribunate; for
  though any one invited by a tribune could address the <i>comitia tributa</i>,
  it was of course much more convenient to wield that assembly with his own
  hand. Exasperated but not materially weakened by the destruction of Catiline,
  recovering its courage when the return of Pompey drew the fangs of the
  reactionists, the popular party was now prepared to renew the assault on the
  senatorial government. Naturally its first wish was to punish the chief
  agents in the <i>coup d'état</i>, particularly Cicero. He was well aware that
  he had sinned past forgiveness. His eternal accounts of the applause which
  greeted his appearances in public have misled the historians into the belief
  that he was really popular in the interval between his consulship and his
  banishment. The thing is utterly incredible. I have no doubt that the father
  of his country was invariably hooted by the mob. It is true he does not
  confess it. But does he ever own to being hissed, or even received with
  coolness, on any single occasion throughout his career? I have already said
  that he seems to have fought shy of the rostra between his consulship and his
  exile, reserving his oratory for the Senate and the courts of law. But
  notwithstanding his careful silence as to the contumely heaped upon him by
  the populace, he betrays the truth by the pleasure with which he describes
  one solitary occasion when he had been spared his usual <i>charivari</i>.
  With respectable people, he tells Atticus, he stands just as he did; with the
  vile mob he is on much better terms than he was; the acquittal of Clodius, in
  spite of his evidence, had put it in better humour; and so his "unpopularity
  had been painlessly let blood."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Noster autem status hic est: apud bonos iidem sumus
  quos reliquisti; apud sordem urbis et faecem multo melius nunc quam
  reliquisti. Nam et illud nobis non obest, videri nostrum testimonium non
  valuisse. Missus est sanguis invidiae sine dolore. (Ad. Att., i. 16.)</p>

  <p>Another reason, he says, was that he was looked on as the bosom friend of
  Pompeius; "and in fact I am so much in his company, that they call him
  <i>Cnaeus Cicero</i>; and so at the games and gladiatorial show I was
  received with wonderful applause without any hissing" (Mirandas 
  &epsilon;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&alpha;&sigmaf;  sine
  ulla pastoricia fistula auferebamus).* How many pair of hands it would take
  to send Cicero home a proud and happy man, every one must judge for himself;
  but it is very evident that the "hissing" of the unwashed had lately formed
  all unpleasant accompaniment to the clapping of the front benches.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* He had associated himself to the Smith, whose motions
  he had watched for the purpose of joining him, for it was Oliver Proudfute's
  opinion that men of action showed to most advantage when beside each other;
  and he was delighted when some wag of the lower class had gravity enough to
  cry out without laughing outright, "There goes the pride of
  Perth,&mdash;there go the slashing craftsmen, the jolly Smith of the Wynd,
  and the bold Bonnet-maker."&mdash;<i>Fair Maid of Perth</i>.</p>

  <p>It was apparent now, even to so dull a reader of the political barometer
  as Cicero throughout his career showed himself to be, that the democratic
  party, backed by Pompeius, would soon be dominant; and to his mortification
  he had discovered that his noble friends, for whom he had incurred so much
  odium, were ready to sacrifice him when the day of retribution should come.
  He had therefore attached himself to Pompeius as the only protector who could
  shield him from popular indignation, and, studiously abstaining from
  politics, devoted himself to his profession of advocate.</p>

  <p>Pompeius had commenced operations after his usual oblique fashion, by
  procuring the election of his creature Afranius to the consulship for the
  year 60. But it was not till the return of Caesar from Spain in the summer of
  that year that the attack was conducted with any vigour. To Caesar no doubt
  is to be ascribed the plan of action resolved on by the three leaders. The
  Senate was to be humbled. The chief agents of the <i>coup d'état</i> were to
  be punished. The acts of Pompeius in the East were to be ratified, and his
  veterans provided with land. Caesar was to be consul, and in that capacity to
  execute the scheme of the coalition. Clodius was to co-operate as mob-orator,
  and the coalition were to promote his adoption into a plebeian house, with a
  view to the tribunate.</p>

  <p>Caesar's election was carried in spite of a profligate expenditure of
  money by the nobility, towards which even the strict Cato contributed his
  share. The first measure of the new Consul on entering office, in January,
  59, was to propose an agrarian law, which triumphed over the fierce
  opposition of the nobles. The other Consul, Bibulus, an obstinate oligarch,
  was unable to show his face in public. Caesar acted as if he was sole Consul.
  Then came the impeachments of Antonius and Flaccus, both of them odious for
  their share in the <i>coup d'état</i>. When the verdict was given against
  Antonius the people dressed Catiline's tomb with flowers.* Cicero knew that
  he was marked out for popular vengeance, but he trusted that his new patron
  Pompeius would protect him.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Cicero, pro Flacco, xxxviii.</p>

  <p>Early in the year, Clodius, by the aid of Cesar, was enrolled a Plebeian.
  Historians uniformly represent him as taking this step for the sole purpose
  of gratifying a blind animosity against Cicero. If there is a childish way of
  explaining a political movement, a literary man will generally adopt it. He
  is irresistibly attracted by what is petty and personal, as he is repelled
  and alarmed by the idea of an orderly evolution of human affairs. It is so
  easy, and to the vulgar mind so agreeable, to attribute the Persian invasion
  of Greece to a curtain lecture of Atossa's, or the English Reformation to the
  pretty face of Anne Boleyn. The fall of Cicero was as much due to the quarrel
  with Clodius about the <i>alibi</i>, as the fall of Strafford to his quarrel
  with Vane about the title of Raby. Cicero's letters to Atticus at this time,
  while repeatedly alluding to the adoption of Clodius, contain no hint that he
  looked on it as having any special reference to himself. Towards the end of
  the year, indeed, he begins to get alarmed. The populace was not satisfied
  with the punishment of subordinates. It demanded justice on the arch-criminal
  himself; and Clodius, irritated by the abuse and obscene jests with which
  Cicero mercilessly pelted him, made no secret of his intention to call him to
  account. In this he was undoubtedly acting in concert with the coalition, and
  especially with Caesar, who, though personally sorry for Cicero, was
  determined that justice should not be baulked. Amnesty for rank and file is
  good; but it would have been the height of weakness to spare a leader so
  guilty and so unrepentant as Cicero. Pompeius acted the basest part
  conceivable. Over and over again he pledged himself to his <i>protégé</i>
  that no harm should befall him. Cicero felt that his patron was playing him
  false, but with characteristic weakness clung to this treacherous support.
  From Crassus, his old foe, nothing but hostility was to be expected.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to read Cicero's correspondence during this year without
  feeling the most profound contempt for him as a political observer. He
  refused to open his eyes to anything he did not want to see. He will have it
  that Pompeius, Caesar, and Crassus, are the most unpopular men in Rome. The
  masses are full of devotion to the Senate. Cato and Bibulus are the
  favourites&mdash;Bibulus who had been driven into his house by popular fury,
  and did not venture outside it again during the rest of his year of office;
  In the theatre hits at Pompeius are the signal for applause. Probably Cicero
  sitting among the senators in the stalls tried to persuade himself that their
  petulance was a sample of popular feeling.* If he did, he was destined to
  learn the truth soon by bitter experience.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* In Paris, during the hottest period of Revolution, the
  reactionists for the most part had it their own way at the theatres.</p>

  <p>Clodius came into office at the close of 59, and lost no time in proposing
  and carrying a series of democratic measures. With strange perversity we are
  asked to believe that "the true design of tall these laws was to introduce
  only with better grace the grand plot of the play&mdash;the banishment of
  Cicero." The punishment of Cicero was a logical and practical necessity of
  the policy of the coalition. Instead of proceeding by the tedious and
  uncertain method of an impeachment, Clodius proposed a law that "whoever had
  put to death a Roman citizen without trial should be banished." Then was seen
  a spectacle that must have been very sweet to all who had suffered or
  trembled at the time of the <i>coup d'état</i>, and who remembered that
  terrible day when Cicero, surrounded by the nobles and moneyed men with their
  drawn swords, had led his prisoners through the Forum to the place of
  execution. Now he might be seen in a squalid dress, followed by a train of
  crest-fallen aristocrats, and pelted with mud and stones while he strove to
  excite the compassion of his fellow-citizens. He tells us that "twenty
  thousand men" (senatus hominumque viginti millia) went into mourning with
  him. Sanguine as he was of obtaining the applause of posterity, he perhaps
  hardly expected that the historians would solemnly one after the other repeat
  his wild exaggeration, as a reliable statistical fact.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Mr. Forsyth says that twenty thousand <i>of the noblest
  youths in Rome</i> testified their attachment, etc. Middleton says that "the
  whole body of the knights and the young nobility to the number of twenty
  thousand <i>perpetually attended him about the city</i>." London is nearly
  ten times as large as Rome in the time of Cicero; but "twenty thousand noble
  youths" would be rather difficult to get together even in the height of the
  season. One would think, too, that to pelt twenty thousand noble youths with
  mud would be hardly safe to the pelters. Perhaps if we cut off a couple of
  figures from 20,000 we shall be near the mark.</p>

  <p>But his humiliation availed him as little as the authority of the Senate.
  "People were mistaken," as Gabinius said, "who thought the Senate was going
  to have its way this time; the moment was come for those who had trembled to
  take vengeance." Cicero was banished to a distance of four hundred miles from
  Rome. If ever a statesman had merited capital punishment it was Cicero; but
  from the fatal defect in the Roman constitution already alluded to, the
  penalty which ought to be reserved for high political crimes could not be
  inflicted, and the populace (ever and everywhere less bloodthirsty and more
  law-abiding than an oligarchy) did not apply to their fallen enemy the
  precedent of violence he had himself established. Caesar, while inflexibly
  carrying out the programme which justice as well as policy prescribed,
  harboured nothing of malice in his open, kindly heart. He was really sorry
  for Cicero, whose amiable qualities he was perhaps singular among his
  contemporaries in liking, and to break his fall he had offered to take him to
  Gaul as his lieutenant. But Cicero flattered himself that his sentence must
  be revoked in a few days, or, at most, weeks. His correspondence paints
  Caesar and Pompeius to the life. The latter he charges, and justly so, with
  hypocrisy, meanness, and treachery. Caesar, on the other hand, is a
  straightforward opponent, hard as steel in what he had determined. Not for a
  moment does it occur to the accused man that there will be any use in
  attempting to work on Caesar's feelings. But there is not an insinuation
  against his candour and good faith. From Cicero such silence is eloquent. It
  was this perfect simplicity of character that carried Caesar, as it carried
  our own Cromwell, to immortality. The representative of all that Cicero most
  dreaded and disliked, he is the only man of that time who has no cause to
  regret that his portrait hangs in the Tullian gallery.</p>

  <p>Cicero's behaviour under adversity is a subject on which I have no wish to
  dwell. My aim is not to persecute the memory of an individual, but to set the
  Roman Revolution in a clear light, and strip off the false colours with which
  the anecdote-mongers have bedaubed it. It is their fault if a rational
  narrative cannot be built up till this or that man's false reputation has
  been demolished. Let us hasten to examine the circumstances under which the
  sentence of banishment was reversed.</p>

  <p>The ups and downs in Cicero's life are a well-known text to stupid sermons
  on popular fickleness. I maintain that "popular fickleness" is a phrase that
  literary men&mdash;particularly the poorest of them, journalists and
  historians&mdash;have invented to hide their own incapacity for tracing the
  orderly evolution of political events. The people are not fickle. Perhaps
  their most striking characteristic, especially under democratic institutions,
  is the staunchness and obstinacy with which they cling to views and beliefs
  once embraced. Let any one think of all the stupid, common-place people he
  knows&mdash;the largest part, that is, of his acquaintance. Do they ever
  change their minds? Or if they do sometimes change, is it not always in
  obedience to "the logic of facts," as the modern phrase is,&mdash;in
  submission, that is to say, to defeat? They are not the men to turn with the
  tide and ride in on the wave of success. No; they drop in, silent and
  unnoticed, when there is no credit to be gained and their adhesion is
  valueless. There is little to be said for their intelligence, but it is a
  shame to rob them of their character. When circumstances favour their
  principles they are noisy and demonstrative. But there comes a time when
  things go against them. Their principles seem to fail in application, and
  they are obliged to hold their tongues. Then the opposite party crow and
  triumph. But where is the fickleness? You might as well charge a meeting of
  the United Kingdom Alliance with fickleness because the room in which they
  are passing decorous resolutions resounded yesterday with the toasts of a
  dinner of licensed victuallers. A small unstable per-centage there may be,
  which is swayed by every gust; but the majority of average men are very slow
  to change.</p>

  <p>I have shown, I trust satisfactorily, that the Roman populace, in
  banishing Cicero, were acting in a natural, consistent way. I am now about to
  show that they persisted steadily in the same sentiments, and that the
  reversal of the sentence was accomplished in defiance of their wishes. Such
  an assertion may startle those who have read of the unanimous vote of the
  <i>comitia</i>, and the triumphal entry of the Father of his Country, borne,
  as he says, upon the shoulders of Italy. What ought to have startled them is
  the gross improbability of the story they have always been asked to
  believe.</p>

  <p>Caesar's consulate had come to a close at the end of 59. Eager to depart
  for his province of Gaul, where he was to enter on his military career, he
  nevertheless lingered outside the walls of Rome with a small armed force
  until he had seen the banishment of Cicero carried into effect. Then at last
  he turned his face northwards. Thrown as he had been into close communication
  with Pompeius during the last year and a half, it is impossible that his
  penetration should not have thoroughly fathomed the feebleness and duplicity
  of him who was still supposed at Rome to be the coming man; and when he left
  to his care the programme of the coalition, it must have been with
  considerable misgivings as to his ability or willingness to carry it out for
  any length of time. But he could hardly have anticipated that the fretful
  incapacity of his ally would spoil everything before the year was out. As
  long as Caesar had been on the spot, Clodius had known his place, and had
  proved a valuable instrument in the hands of the coalition. But no sooner was
  Caesar's back turned than the tribune took the bit in his mouth. Even he had
  found out Pompeius, and to his irreverent spirit there was perhaps something
  amusing in treading on the toes of the solemn impostor. What the points of
  collision were it is unnecessary to mention here. Clodius may have been
  actuated merely by private ambition. But it is at least as likely that he
  suspected Pompeius of betraying the democratic cause. However that may be,
  the man of war, swelling with offended dignity, and forgetting the great game
  he had undertaken to play, in his impatience to crush his antagonist, made
  overtures to the nobility,&mdash;in other words, dissolved the coalition.</p>

  <p>The terms of the nobility of course were the re-establishment of the
  senatorial government and the recall of Cicero. The first condition Pompeius
  might hope to evade; but the second had to be executed in advance; and in
  conjunction with the nobles he paved the way for it by "engineering" the
  elections, as the Americans say, for the year 57. The new consuls were
  Lentulus Spinther, a staunch partisan of the Senate, and Metellus Nepos, long
  known as a tool of Pompeius, who had hitherto made himself conspicuous by
  baiting Cicero, but was now prepared at the bidding of his patron to promote
  the orator's recall. The compact between Pompeius and the senatorial leaders
  was made as early as May, 58, but it was probably kept quite dark till after
  the elections in July.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* There had been a motion in the Senate for Cicero's
  recall in June, which Mr. Forsyth says was made with the approval of
  Pompeius. I know not what authority he has for the statement, and it is
  highly improbable; for we know that Pompeius recommended that nothing should
  be done till the elections were over. Cicero, Ad. Att., iii. 13, 14, 18.</p>

  <p>Cicero had already been apprised of what was in contemplation, and had
  ventured to write to Pompeius, but it does not appear that he got any answer
  from the cautious dissembler. In the meantime Pompeius had written to Caesar
  to obtain his consent. It is clear that the answer must have been
  unfavourable; for, later in the year, Cicero's devoted partizan, Sextius,
  went into Gaul on the same errand.* We may take it as certain that Csar
  steadily refused to stultify himself by giving any consent to this imbecile
  reversal of the policy of the coalition.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Cicero professes not to know what Caesar said to
  Sextius, which is of course absurd. "Quid egerit, quantum profecerit, nihil
  ad causam. Equidem existimo, si ille (ut arbitror) ae quus nobis fuerit nihil
  ab hoc profectum: sin iratior non multum." (Cic. pro Sextio, 33.) I may here
  remark that Cicero uniformly affects ignorance or uncertainty about the
  course Caesar had pursued. Obvious as his motives are for doing so, he has
  effectually thrown the historians on a wrong scent. Mr. Forsyth, for
  instance, speaks of Cicero being "disappointed that Pompey <i>and Caesar</i>
  did net declare themselves more openly in his favour" (i. 213). Even if there
  were a line of Cicero to support such a statement, which there is not, to
  credit it would show a hopeless misapprehension of the situation.</p>

  <p>If Pompeius had shown his hand before July, perhaps not all his influence
  combined with that of the nobles would have carried the elections. But, as it
  was, there were only two tribunes to head the democratic party. On January
  25th, 57, in spite, as it seems, of the veto of the tribune Serranus, the
  Senate caused a bill for the recall of Cicero to be submitted to the people.
  A riot ensued. Serranus and Q. Cicero were both wounded. The tribune Milo (a
  desperate ruffian, who afterwards murdered Clodius with the warm approval of
  Cicero) was besieged by the mob in his house. This time the unconstitutional
  attempt to ignore the tribunitian veto was defeated. Cicero, of course, says
  that Serranus was bribed with the gold of Clodius, and that the assembly was
  broken up by the gladiators of Clodius. We have not got the Clodian version
  of the story. But we may guess it from the fact that Cicero's friend, the
  tribune Sextius, was afterwards prosecuted for having resorted to violence,
  and that Cicero himself, in a work written eleven years afterwards, praises
  Milo for his public spirit in providing gladiators at his own expense on this
  occasion.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Cicero de Officiis, ii. 17.</p>

  <p>I have not wasted much of my space in transcribing the preposterous
  language of the historians, but I cannot deny myself the pleasure of quoting
  Mr. Forsyth's innocent reflections on these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="quote">"All Italy&mdash;the Senate, the two consuls, all the
  tribunes, with one exception, Pompey and Caesar (who was, however, absent),
  the two foremost men of Rome, an overwelming number of the nobility and
  respectable class of citizens, wished for Cicero's return, and yet the wishes
  of all were frustrated and their actions paralysed by the vielence of one
  bold, bad man. But the explanation is easy. Every Roman burgher had the
  franchise, and his vote was as good as that of the wealthiest and most
  pewerful citizen...There was no true balance of power in the constitution. No
  law could be passed witheut an appeal to universal suffrage, and what the
  sovereign people chose to ordain, even when legal formalities were not
  observed, had generally the force of law." (i. 216.)</p>

  <p>Exactly so. Every Roman burgher had the franchise. No law could be passed
  without an appeal to universal suffrage. That is just the reason why I
  decline to accept the lazy hypothesis of "one bold, bad man." That my vote
  should outweigh the votes of twenty people who disagree with me, and whose
  interests are opposed to mine, may possibly be very right and expedient; but
  if it is to be called a true balance of power we may as well shut up the
  English dictionary.</p>

  <p>The sentiment of the people had been unmistakably declared in January. In
  that sentiment they persisted through the spring and summer, in spite of the
  influence of Pompeius, the authority of the Senate, and the gladiators of
  Milo. The Senate at last resolved on desperate measures. The citizens of the
  municipal towns in Italy had the right of voting in the <i>comitia</i> at
  Rome, but practically they never exercised it. Their interest centred in
  their own town, with its assembly, senate, and magistrates. They were no
  longer the independent yeomen who had cheered on the noble brothers, the
  proto-martyrs of the revolution, and sworn to live or die with the beloved
  Drusus.* The industrial population had perished, or found its way to Rome,
  and the government of a <i>municipium</i> virtually lay with the wealthy or
  comfortable slave-owners.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "I swear that these shall be my friends and those shall
  be my foes who are friends or foes to Drusus; also that I will spare neither
  mine own life nor the life of my children, or of my parents, except so fax as
  it is for the good of Drusus." (Oath of the Italians. Mommsen, iii. 232.
  Translation.)</p>

  <p>The political sympathies of these men, so far as they troubled themselves
  with imperial politics, would be with the governing class at Rome&mdash;the
  only class with which officially they came into contact. They neither knew
  nor cared what went on in the Forum or Campus Martius. They had always looked
  on the Senate as the supreme authority in Rome. Their municipal constitution
  had been organised by Sulla in the days of the reaction. They had an idea
  that Pompeius stood in Sulla's shoes, that he was the coming man, and that it
  was the correct as well as the safe thing to back him.</p>

  <p>The Senate determined to employ this class to crush the democratic
  opposition at Rome. Letters were written by the consuls to the authorities in
  the municipal towns that all "qui Rempublicam salvam vellent" (all, that is,
  who could be depended on to support the Senate) should come to Rome to vote
  for the recall of Cicero. Pompeius himself made a progress through many of
  these towns to stimulate their action. The result was that large numbers of
  Italians were collected in Rome on an appointed day, and under cover of these
  bands the Senate passed a resolution that any tribune exercising his
  constitutional right to impede the bill for the recall of Cicero, should be
  treated as a public enemy&mdash;in other words, knocked on the head; and if
  the bill was not passed within the next five days of meeting, the exile
  should return without it.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* There is no possibility, I believe, of fixing the date
  of this first visit of the Italians to Rome. Middleton places it on the 25th
  of May, and Mr. Forsyth gives May without specifying a day.</p>

  <p>The Italians were then thanked for their attendance, and charged to be in.
  Rome again when tho day should come for voting the bill. Accordingly on the
  fourth of August, 57, the city was again filled with Italians pledged to
  support the Senate. The consul Lentulus convoked the centuries. The officers
  whose business it was to distribute the voting-tickets and take charge of the
  ballot-boxes (<i>diribitores et custodes tabularum</i>), were set aside for
  this occasion, and their places filled by noblemen.* After such precautions
  it is superfluous to say that the bill was carried. If it was carried, as Mr.
  Forsyth says, "with hardly a dissentient voice," the farce only appears the
  more absurd.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* If this was merely the statement of a Clodian partisan,
  I should not ask any one to believe it, but it rests on the authority of
  Cicero himself, who mentions it twice. Post Red. in Sen., xi.; In Pisonem,
  xv.</p>

  <p>Cicero enlarges with wonderful superlatives on the triumphal progress
  which he says he made through Italy on his return to Rome in September. That
  the Greek cities in the south may have received him with demonstrations of
  joy I think quite possible, because we read of their welcoming Pompeius with
  similar extravagance seven years afterwards; on which occasion Cicero sneers
  at their enthusiasm as "ineptum sane negotium et Graeculum."* But nothing
  shall make me believe that the acclamations he speaks of in the streets of
  Rome, came from any but the nobles, the followers of the nobles, and the
  Italians who surrounded his carriage. Within three days after his return
  (when his Italian partisans had no doubt gone home) the populace drove the
  Senate out of the Capitol with showers of stones, and Cicero was afraid to
  show his face. In November we find him walking about Rome with a guard of
  armed men to protect him from the mob. His house, which he is rebuilding, is
  pulled down. The house of Milo is assaulted, If Cicero was a favourite with
  the Roman populace, they certainly dissembled their love most
  successfully.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Tusc. Disp., i. 35.</p>

  <p>Beyond this point the scope of the present enquiry does not carry me. I
  have endeavoured to give a rational and consistent account of the events
  which have been distorted so audaciously by Cicero, and so credulously by his
  admirers. It will not be pretended that I have made a hero of Clodius. I
  disclaim all desire to blacken Cicero, for whom it is impossible not to feel
  kindly as a man of warm, open heart, sprightly temper, infinite cleverness,
  and a genuine, though sadly embarrassed, love for virtue; amusing, but never
  offensive, in his vanity; and striving, even in his least justifiable
  actions, to persuade himself that he was working for a good end. But I cannot
  consent that the history of the Roman Revolution should be made more
  incoherent than</p>

  <p class="poem">"A tale<br>
  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br>
  Signifying nothing,"</p>

  <p class="first">in order to force it into harmony with the prepossessions of
  literary men. No one who has thoroughly conceived the rottenness of the
  oligarchical government, the vileness of the Senate itself, the mediocrity of
  its leaders, the misery of the Roman world, incalculable alike in amount and
  intensity, but will draw breath more freely when he enters at last on the
  splendid calm of two centuries, unparalleled hitherto in the history of the
  world, which followed the battle of Actium. The "faex Romuli," the "swinish
  multitude," is entitled to the credit of having steadily pushed forwards to
  this consummation. The highborn, the wealthy, the educated, resisted it with
  sword and halter, bludgeon and knife. "Not many wise, not many noble," wrote
  St. Paul, stating a fact, though he could not explain it. If he had lived in
  our day he would have said that the proletarian class has naturally a breadth
  of view which education, unless positive in its spirit, only tends to
  impair.</p>

  <h3><big>PART I.</big></h3>

  <p>I have to-night to bespeak your patience and impartiality while I
  endeavour to deal fairly and dispassionately with one of the most celebrated
  names of ancient history. I do not under-estimate the overwhelming weight of
  prejudice against which I have to contend. Emperors are not looked on with
  favour in England&mdash;neither modern nor ancient emperors. And of all who
  have borne that unpopular title in ancient or modern times, perhaps not one
  has been regarded with such detestation as the Emperor Tiberius. Most
  educated people have read something about him in their boyhood, and the very
  name calls up to their recollection images of gloomy misanthropy, of
  life-long hypocrisy, of slow but implacable hate, of remorseless cruelty. A
  city crouching in terror through a long reign, the air heavy with an odour of
  the dungeon and the reek of blood, a wearisome monotony of state trials, the
  spy invading the family circle, the executioner ever plying his halter, a
  loathsome old man wallowing in foulest excesses in a secluded island, where
  neither groans nor curses can reach him&mdash;such is the picture transmitted
  to posterity by the most eloquent of historians: a picture how false, how
  contradictory, how insulting to common-sense, I shall endeavour to show you
  to-night. Do not suppose that I take a perverse pleasure in maintaining a
  paradox. I value history too highly to trifle with it; and it is because I
  grieve to see two hundred years of history turned into nonsense that I would
  fain bring the light of common-sense to bear on the character and work of
  some of the leading personages of the Roman Revolution.</p>

  <p>Before dealing with Tiberius himself, it will be proper to give some
  general view of the political and social state of the Roman world in which he
  moved. You are all aware that the Republic (as it is called) was overthrown
  by Julius Cesar; that the murder of that incomparable man was followed by a
  period of civil war and anarchy; that his nephew Augustus at last established
  himself as sole ruler; and that after a long reign Augustus was succeeded by
  his stepson Tiberius. Now I must first ask you to dismiss from your minds all
  those prepossessions in favour of the Republican Government which are derived
  from its name. It was no Republic. It was that worst of all governments, the
  monopoly of power by a privileged class. You know what that means. A single
  man ruling with despotic power must take some thought for the well-being of
  his subjects, or his reign will not last long. But a privileged class with
  immense landed property, with a degraded agricultural population crawling
  below its feet at an immeasurable depth, snarled at and worshipped by the
  moneyed men who hope one day to enter its ranks, wielding its power through
  the agency of a deliberative assembly consisting mainly of noblemen and their
  nominees&mdash;such a class, I say, can perform with security feats of
  injustice and oppression from which a despot would recoil with dismay.
  Wrapping up its arbitrary action in solemn constitutional jargon, evading
  responsibility by dividing it, arrogating a popular origin by the farce of
  popular election, it has not one, but a thousand greedy maws to be filled at
  the public expense, a thousand idle hands ready for any mischief, and (let us
  add) in the day of retribution a thousand necks where the despot has but one.
  Such a class was the Roman aristocracy. Such a deliberative assembly was the
  Roman senate.</p>

  <p>There had been a time when this aristocracy had ruled by the best of all
  titles&mdash;that of merit. But that time had long gone by. The descendants
  of the men who had tamed and organised Italy, who had beaten back the Keltic
  barbarian, who had struck down Carthage and Macedon, had lost every private
  and public virtue that had distinguished those old nobles, retaining nothing
  but their obstinacy and ferocity. Their fathers had conquered the world, and
  they were devouring it. Such a horde of blood-suckers and extortioners never
  before or since fastened on an oppressed people. A groan went up from the
  whole civilised world. When the great nobles had shorn their wretched
  subjects, the moneyed men came and flayed them. The plunder of the world was
  poured into the imperial city, where it was lavished in political corruption
  and vulgar luxury. This state of things could not have lasted long. It was
  not this which Rome had promised to the nations when she incorporated them.
  If Caesar had not risen up and taken this vile oligarchy by the throat, the
  solid fabric built up by six centuries of patient toil and devoted patriotism
  must have collapsed; the barbarians prowling round the frontiers would have
  burst in, and the era of Alaric and Attila would have been anticipated by
  four hundred years.</p>

  <p>Was there, then, no popular party at Rome, you will ask&mdash;was there no
  humbler class there, as in other countries, bestridden by an
  aristocraby&mdash;a class which suffers from bad government, and bears it
  with impatience? There was; and its struggles to pull down the oligarchy
  convulsed Rome during the last century of the Republic. But oligarchies die
  hard. While the people is moved by sentiment, by belief in abstract
  principles, by gusts of passion, a priviledged class keeps one end steadily
  in view the preservation of its privileges. It acts together like one man.
  Its aims are narrow, but they are definite and precise. There is no waste of
  force. Each man is closely and permanently interested in maintaining the
  position. The instinct of self-preservation is a low one; but there is none
  which calls forth such concentrated and sustained energy.</p>

  <p>It is thus that we must explain the protracted resistance of the Roman
  nobility to a democracy apparently so superior in all the elements of
  political force, and (let me observe in passing) possessed of manhood
  suffrage and vote by ballot. When corruption and trickery would not avail,
  these noblemen were always ready to resort to violence. Sometimes the popular
  leaders were secretly assassinated. Sometimes they were openly lynched.
  Sometimes martial law was declared, and the Tiber ran thick with corpses.
  When all other means of resistance were exhausted, Italy was plunged into
  civil war. A great general with a veteran army, after a frightful slaughter
  among the democratic party, re-established the Senatorial Government for the
  last time: But a greater than Sulla was growing up to manhood. In Julius
  Caesar the oppressed people at length found their champion. They had learnt,
  by a long and painful experience, that the so-called Republican Government
  was a sham; that its venerable machinery of popular assemblies and elective
  magistracies, however it might have worked in small communities, such as the
  free cities of Greece, or as Rome herself had been in earlier times, was
  totally unadapted to her present position as the capital of a vast
  empire.</p>

  <p>The old Republican constitution, so far from being a security for liberty,
  was merely a convenient instrument for aristocratic misrule. The people
  carried Julius Caesar to power, in order that he might brush privilege and
  establish something like equality. That was the leading idea of the Imperial
  system as carried out by Julius, Augustus, and Tiberius, its three great
  founders. They were, in fact, tribunes and champions of the people against
  the nobility, and of the provinces against Rome. Only, instead of relying
  upon oratory, and agitation, and street demonstrations, and monster meetings,
  they carried a sharp sword. So, at length, the aristocracy was tamed.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "Cette première phase de la dictature fut dignement
  installée par deux types éminents, qui méritent d'être personnellement
  signalés. Sage héritier du généreux César, Auguste sut noblement surmonter
  les impulsions résultées de ses longues luttes, et gouverna l'Occident avec
  une sollicitude sociocratique, où toutes les classes devaient concourir au
  bien public suivant leurs aptitudes respectives. Ce caractère général fut
  énergiquement développé par Tibère, qui, malgré les turpitudes privées de ses
  dernières années, effacera bientôt, d'après l'ensemble de ses qualités,
  intellectuelles et morales, une flétrissure émanée des rancunes
  aristocratiques."&mdash;Comte, Politique Positive, iii. 394.</p>

  <p>I am going to treat the character of Tiberius biographically, and I will
  tell you at once why I do so. When a man has died at the age of seventy-eight
  years, having passed his whole life as a public man in situations of the
  highest responsibility, surely it is but fair to judge his career as a whole,
  and to interpret one part of it by another. Tiberius was fifty-six years old
  when he became emperor. I would put it to you&mdash;have you in your own
  experience found that men come out in an entirely new character after
  fifty-six? Should you not be surprised if a friend of yours who had lived to
  old age as a brave, hard-working, just man, remarkable beyond others for
  soberness, temperance, and chastity in the midst of a dissolute
  society&mdash;I say, would it not take a great deal to persuade you that such
  a man, when his hair was grey, and the fire of youth was abated, would break
  out into the most abandoned and shameless licentiousness? If you saw it with
  your eyes, would you not think you were dreaming? How then would you receive
  such a tale if it came to you, not only loaded with the grossest
  contradictions and inconsistencies, but vouched for by the authority of an
  informant who had no personal knowledge of the facts, but had evidently
  swallowed, with too willing credulity, the scandals whispered by the personal
  enemies of the accused man? Now I undertake to show you that the case of
  Tiberius is very much what I have supposed. It is to your common sense that I
  shall appeal. You may not all of you be competent to decide complicated or
  obscure problems of history, because you have not been familiar with them.
  But you are familiar with human character, the laws of which are of universal
  application, and are just the same in Bradford to-day as they were in Rome
  nineteen centuries ago.</p>

  <p>Tiberius was four years old when his mother Livia married the future
  emperor. He was eleven when the battle of Actium made his stepfather sole
  master of the Roman world. Augustus was then still in the prime of life, but
  as the eight years of his union with Livia had proved unfruitful, he seems to
  have resigned himself to the prospect of having no male offspring, and had
  therefore married Julia, his daughter by a former wife, to his nephew
  Marcellus, whom he destined to be his successor. Marcellus, however, died
  young, and Julia was then married to the warrior and statesman Agrippa, to
  whom more than any one else Augustus owed his throne. Agrippa was thus marked
  out as the future emperor. He was, it is true, as old as Augustus himself.
  But the health of Augustus at this time seemed failing. By her elderly
  husband Julia had several children. Tiberius at this time, though enjoying
  considerable distinction as the stepson of the emperor, was not supposed to
  have any claim to the succession, which would fall naturally to Agrippa and
  his children, the emperor's grandsons. He was a good deal absent from Rome on
  military service in Spain, in the Tyrol, and in Asia. He is described by
  Suetonius as being tall and well built, with a handsome face and great bodily
  strength, a description which is borne out by statues and busts still
  remaining. He was a grave, silent man, and when he walked always carried his
  head stiffly as if he was on drill. He was strongly attached to the old Roman
  manners, and it is mentioned that though perfectly acquainted with the Greek
  language, he particularly objected to the use of Greek phrases in
  conversation, which was then fashionable.</p>

  <p>Contrary to all expectation, Agrippa died at the age of fifty-one, and
  Julia was again left a widow with her young family. She was still only
  twenty-eight years old, though she had buried two husbands. Augustus doted on
  his little grandsons Caius and Lucius, but he was well aware that it was
  impossible to bequeath his sceptre to a boy. He therefore turned his eye on
  Tiberius, whom he required to divorce his wife Vipsania and marry Julia, and
  so become a father to the lads. This was one of the worst acts of Augustus's
  reign. Tiberius was tenderly attached to Vipsania, by whom he had a son. To
  Julia he had an especial dislike. Her light character was the talk of Rome.
  Every one knew it but her father. During the lifetime of the elderly husband
  whom she had just buried, she had cast Wanton eyes on the handsome young
  Tiberius, who, as might be expected from the austerity of his character, had
  rejected her advances with disgust. This lady he was now obliged to
  marry.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Vipsania was the daughter of Agrippa, and so the
  stepdaughter of Julia. The new marriage, therefore, if not absolutely
  incestuous, had something revolting about it, Julia being the
  stepmother-in-law of Tiberius.</p>

  <p>Vipsania was of humble birth, and perhaps did not shine at court. But the
  atmosphere of a court never suited Tiberius. To him it had been happiness to
  do his duty as a soldier in the summer, and return in the winter to the quiet
  of domestic life. All this was now at an end. His happiness was blighted. A
  dark cloud passed over his life and rested on it. Instead of the quiet gentle
  Vipsania, he saw presiding over his house the fastest lady in Rome, still
  young and beautiful, but with less than half a reputation. Tiberius had
  always been a grave man. From that day we may well believe he became a
  melancholy man; the most melancholy of men, says Pliny&mdash;<i>tristissimus
  hominum</i>. Once, and only once again, did he see his lost Vipsania. It was
  by chance they met, and he gazed after her, says the historian, with such
  strained and bursting eyes (<i>adeo contentis et tumentibus oculis</i>) that
  good care was taken he should never see her again.</p>

  <p>A war in Dalmatia and Croatia afforded him an excuse for leaving his new
  wife immediately after their marriage. During two years of a difficult
  struggle against the stubborn barbarians of that wild country, he exhibited,
  says Mr. Merivale, "admirable activity and skill, and might already be
  esteemed the most consummate captain of his day." While he was thus occupied
  news reached him of the dangerous illness of his younger brother Drusus, who
  was fighting the Germans in Westphalia. He immediately set off, travelled
  night and day, rode through the barbarous district lately traversed by the
  contending armies with no attendant but his guide, and arrived at the camp a
  few hours before his brother's death. He brought the corpse to Rome, walking
  before it the whole way from the Rhine to the Tiber, over Alps and Apennines,
  in the depth of winter. This grave, silent man was not, it seems, without
  deep feelings, which he manifested in his own way. I do not myself consider
  that pedestrianism implies the possession of every virtue. But in these days,
  when a long walk is thought by many people to be a testimony to character
  which should outweigh depositions on oath, the report of a Royal Commission,
  and even the confessions of a criminal himself, perhaps this winter walk of
  Tiberius from Mayence to Rome may dispose some at least, I do not say to
  "take him on trust," but to listen with patience and impartiality to an
  examination of the foul charges which are brought against him.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Shortly before this lecture was delivered, the Rev.
  Charles Kingsley had insisted that the author of the Jamaica atrocities
  should be "taken on trust" because he had walked across Australia.</p>

  <p>During the greater part of the next three years Tiberius was at the head
  of the army of the Rhine, which had been commanded by his deceased brother.
  He experienced no reverses, but, on the other hand, he did not make much
  progress towards the conquest of Germany. It is probable that the resources
  of Gaul, from which the war had to be supported, were exhausted, and that
  Augustus did not furnish him with adequate means. The fact is, that his
  position was becoming most unsatisfactory. When he had been compelled to
  divorce Vipsania and marry Julia, that cruel act had been justified by
  reasons of state. The welfare of the vast empire demanded that the successor
  of Augustus should be, not a child, but a mature man. Although no express
  nomination had been or indeed could be made, the meaning of the arrangement
  had been unmistakable. But the health of Augustus, which had been very weak
  in early life, became stronger as he approached old age. He outlived his
  ailments, and in the latter part of his long reign enjoyed excellent
  health.</p>

  <p>Thus it happened that the two lads, Caius and Lucius, grew up to manhood
  before the throne was vacant; and it was now becoming evident that Augustus
  was drawing back from the understanding with Tiberius, who, after filling the
  place of heir-apparent, was to subside into a private citizen. That Tiberius
  should not feel the injustice most keenly was impossible. Five years had
  elapsed since his home had been broken up because it was so necessary that he
  should succeed Augustus. Since then he had not known what it was to have a
  home. He had been engaged almost incessantly in fighting the battles of his
  country against the rugged barbarians of the Danube and the Rhine, faithfully
  discharging the laborious duties of the station to which he had been called.
  If his private happiness had been crushed, at least he could throw himself
  heart and soul into the business of the state. And now the bitter reality
  dawned upon him. His long services, his glorious achievements, nay, his great
  sorrow, were to be lightly passed over; and a pet grandson of the emperor, an
  inexperienced and presumptuous lad, was to take precedence of him.</p>

  <p>This intention indeed was not openly expressed, for Augustus never assumed
  the right of naming a successor. But it was plain that he meant to place the
  young Agrippa on the steps of the throne, and to keep him before the eyes of
  the people, while Tiberius was banished to distant provinces and the drudgery
  of frontier warfare. When, upon his return from Germany, he was required to
  set off for Armenia, his patience at last gave way. He determined to leave
  Augustus to manage the empire as best he could with the help of his young
  grandsons.</p>

  <p>For himself, he announced his intention of retiring from public life and
  living as a private citizen at Rhodes. He selected Rhodes for his residence
  partly to make it plain that he did not intend to enter on any rivalry with
  the young men, partly to avoid his wife, from whom he had hitherto sought
  refuge in the camp. Augustus, astonished and disconcerted, endeavoured to
  dissuade him from his purpose, and complained bitterly in the senate that he
  should thus be deserted in his old age. Livia also joined her entreaties, but
  Tiberius was immovable. When forbidden to leave Rome, he resolved to put an
  end to his life; and had already gone four days without food, when the
  permission he had demanded was at length accorded to him. He was accompanied
  to the place of embarkation by those who loved or respected him. But not a
  word did he utter, from fear probably of compromising them; and silently
  kissing some of those who had thus testified their regard, he turned his back
  on Italy.</p>

  <p>In Rhodes he remained seven years, living in the simplest manner, in a
  small house, cultivating the acquaintance of the citizens, and finding his
  chief amusement in attending lectures in the university. A few anecdotes are
  preserved of this period of his life, one of which, being characteristic, may
  be mentioned.. He was in the habit all through life of writing down every
  evening what he intended to do next day. On one occasion, while at Rhodes, he
  had thus put down that on the morrow he would visit all the sick in the city,
  intending, we must suppose, to take some days about it. His attendants
  misunderstanding the entry in his <i>agenda</i>, or desiring to save him
  trouble, had all the sick persons carried into the market-place; and when he
  went out next morning, he found them lying there classified neatly according
  to their diseases. He was greatly shocked, and stood for some moments in
  considerable embarrassment; but at length went round and begged the pardon of
  each patient separately&mdash;even the humblest and most unknown, says
  Suetonius.</p>

  <p>In this manner five years passed away. Tiberius considered that he had
  made his intentions sufficiently plain. On the one hand, he would no longer
  be made to occupy a false position; and on the other, he declined all rivalry
  with the young Caius, who was now consul, and beyond dispute heir-apparent.
  He thought, therefore, that the time was come when he might return to Rome,
  and live in quiet as a private citizen, without danger of being
  misunderstood. The other reason for his retirement to Rhodes had also become
  inoperative. Julia was no longer at Rome. Her scandalous life had at last
  come to the ears of her father, and he had banished her. Tiberius, therefore,
  intimated to the emperor that he desired to see his family again. But
  Augustus, either mistrusting his enragedns or enraged at his retirement,
  returned him the freezing answer that, as he had thought proper to leave his
  family, he need not trouble himself any more about it.</p>

  <p>During the next two years the fate of Tiberius trembled in the balance.
  Although he had so pointedly declined all rivalry with the sons of Agrippa,
  they could not but look on him with jealousy. The young Caius had come into
  the East as viceroy, and did not conceal his ill-will. His courtiers were
  encouraged to scoff at the exile of Rhodes, and one of them even offered to
  go and fetch his head, if Caius would only say the word. There was one
  influential person, however, to whom Tiberius was still dear. This was his
  mother, the empress. Trembling for her son's life, she implored her husband
  to consent to his return, and at length succeeded in obtaining it. For two or
  three years after this we hear nothing of Tiberius, except that he lived at
  Rome as a private citizen. Then once more his fortune changed. The two young
  Caesars died, the one in Asia, the other in Spain; and Augustus, for the
  fourth time in his long reign, was obliged to look about him for a
  successor.* His first choice had been his nephew Marcellus, then his old
  friend Agrippa, then Tiberius, then the two young Caesars. But he had buried
  one after another, and now there was nothing for it but to turn once more to
  the ill-used Tiberius. There was indeed another young grandson; but his low
  intellect and depraved tastes put him out of the question. There was also a
  son of Drusus, a promising youth, better know as Germanicus. But he was at
  this time only nineteen years old. Tiberius, therefore, was summoned from his
  retirement, and formally adopted by the emperor. An adopted son among the
  Romans, as among the Hindoos, stood in all respects in the same position as a
  son by blood.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The malicious gossip of Rome accused Livia and Tiberius
  of poisoning them; and Tacitus, with his "mors fato propera vel novercae
  Liviae dolus," has more than half branded them with the crime. Suetonius,
  Florus, and even the credulous Dion, observe a more candid silence, and Pliny
  enumerates among the misfortunes of <i>Augustus</i>, "incusatae liberorum
  mortes." That Caius died of wounds received in Armenia is proved by the
  testimony of Velleius, who was with him, and by an inscription still
  existing. The calumny would not be worth noticing here, but that it shows
  what stuff Tacitus was ready to use. The character of Livia does not fall
  within the scope of the present paper. Let Tacitus and the <i>servum
  pecus</i> of modern writers say what they will of her, every clear judging
  student will recognise in her one of the noblest types of the Roman
  matron.</p>

  <p>He took his new father's name, and the family was supposed to be continued
  just as truly and really as though male offspring had not failed.
  Henceforward Tiberius was the son and heir of Augustus, and his name was
  Tiberius Caesar. Augustus could not name him as his successor, for the
  position he held was not yet supposed to be hereditary, and public opinion
  would have been outraged by treating it as such. But he went as near it as he
  could by adding the words, "This I do for the sake of the state." Tiberius,
  who had only one son, named Drusus, was at the same time required to adopt
  Germanicus. Thus Augustus, as it were, entailed the empire first on Tiberius,
  and after him on Germanicus and Drusus, or the survivor of them; and every
  man in Rome, from the highest to the lowest, knew that no further change
  could now be made. If Tiberius had been young or incapable, it would not have
  been so certain, for some great nobleman would have made a bold push to wrest
  the sceptre from his hand. But his mature age (he was now six-and-forty), his
  high character, his military glory, made him beyond comparison the fittest
  man then living to rule the Roman world, and during the ten years that were
  yet to elapse before the throne became vacant, his superiority was to be
  still more strikingly displayed. The heir to that throne could not waste the
  prime of life in useless idleness, and an unceas ing round of even harmless
  amusement. He was expected to work for his place betimes, to relieve the
  sovereign of the toils of frontier warfare, to inspect the most distant
  provinces of the empire&mdash;in short, to lead a life of incessant activity,
  and so justify his claim to be advanced over the heads of his fellowmen.
  Immediately after his adoption, Tiberius resumed his old post as general of
  the armies of the state.</p>

  <p>Vast as the empire was, there was still one conquest which was necessary,
  not merely to its glory, but to its security. As long as Germany remained
  unsubdued, the civilised world was in perpetual danger. It was not so much
  that the Teutonic barbarians were a formidable foe, for their numbers are
  evidently exaggerated, and in fair fight they were no match for the Romans. A
  glance at the map will show why the conquest was so necessary. If they were
  to remain unsubdued, the frontier must lie along the Rhine and the Danube, a
  length of 2,500 miles. Now Europe outside of Russia is in fact a peninsula,
  of which Poland is the isthmus; and if Germany had been conquered, the
  frontier would have lain across that isthmus, along the line of the Dniester
  and the Vistula, a length of only 800 miles, from the Black Sea to the
  Baltic. To conquer Germany was, therefore, a vital necessity worth any
  expenditure of blood and treasure. We all know that it was not effected. On
  the one hand, the Germans lost the inestimable benefit of incorporation with
  Rome; and on the other hand, the time came when Rome was unable to defend a
  frontier of 2,500 miles. The barbarians burst in, and the spontaneous and
  inevitable change to Feudalism, which would otherwise have taken place
  without much breach of continuity or any serious waste of the social and
  material constructions of Humanity, was turned into a scene of needless
  disorder and uncompensated destruction. This danger was very evident to the
  early emperors, and therefore it was that such efforts were made to conquer
  Germany. They failed because Germany was so barbarous. Julius Caesar had
  thoroughly conquered Gaul in eight campaigns, because Gaul was a
  comparatively rich and civilised country, with towns, roads, bridges,
  agriculture and commerce. But the Germans of the time of Tiberius were still
  nomads and little better than savages. Savages may be gradually conquered or
  exterminated by colonists, but you cannot keep armies in a country where
  there are no towns, and little or no agriculture. This was why the Romans
  failed to conquer Germany.</p>

  <p>It was to this great task that Tiberius now returned. He was at home in
  the camp. There alone was any trace now to be found of the antique virtue,
  the discipline, the serious activity which had once been the distinguishing
  characteristics of Roman life, and to which old-fashioned type Tiberius
  always remained faithful. In Rome very likely he was no favourite, where his
  stiff bearing and austere morality were a perpetual protest against frivolity
  and dissipation. But his soldiers understood him better. Probably, like
  William III., he was more genial in the camp than in the capital. His
  reception by the army of the Rhine, on his return after ten years' absence,
  as described by an eye-witness, reminds one of Napoleon's return from Elba,
  or the arrival of Nelson in the British fleet on the eve of Trafalgar. The
  veterans wept for joy. They pressed round him to grasp his hand. "Do our eyes
  see you once more, general?" "Have we got you back safe amongst us?" "I
  served under you in Armenia, general." "Do you remember me in the Tyrol?"
  "You decorated me in the Bavarian campaign, general," or "in Hungary or in
  Germany."* Such is the scene as described by an eye-witness, the historian
  Velleius, with a freedom and heartiness of style very unusual in a classical
  writer.**</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "Videmus te imperator! Salvum recepimus! ac deinde: ego
  tecum Imperator in Armenia, ego in Rhaetia fui, ego a te in Vindelicis, ego
  in Pannonia, ego in Germania donatus sum! "&mdash;Velleius, ii. 104.</p>

  <p class="footnote">** Of all the readers of this paper who will pooh-pooh
  Velleius as a notorious toady of Tiberius, how many can honestly say that
  they ever read a chapter of his book? Our wretched classical education does
  not even introduce its victims to more than a small fraction of the scanty,
  but precious, remains of ancient history. How do they know that Velleius is a
  toady? Because they are told so by the literary men, who can just see that
  either he or Tacitus must be utterly wrong about Tiberius, and, of course,
  decide for the finest writer. Velleius was not a depraved, spiteful
  aristocrat of the capital; he was a distinguished soldier, who had served all
  over the world, and understood what <i>virtus</i> meant, in the old Roman
  sense of the word. I have never heard Napier called a toady because he speaks
  with enthusiasm of his old commander. Velleius had as much to gain by
  flattering Tiberius as Napier by flattering Wellington, and no more. And it
  is on this pretext, forsooth, that the only witness who speaks of these times
  from his own knowledge is to be put out of court! The work of Velleius was
  clearly not undertaken with the primary object of pleasing contemporaries,
  for it deals with the whole history of Rome, and only a small portion of it
  is devoted to the events of his own time. It is worthy of remark that, like
  Tacitus, he sees the times earlier than his own recollection through the
  delusive mist of pseudo-republican sentimentalism.</p>

  <p>In three campaigns Tiberius carried the Roman arms over all the country
  between the Rhine and the Elbe. Like all great generals, he was indefatigable
  in attending to the comfort of his troops and the formation of magazines, and
  thus he was enabled to continue operations far into the winter. Although this
  is not an occasion for entering into military details, I should not be doing
  justice to Tiberius if I did not bring particularly under your notice the
  third compaign, which, in its conception and execution, was worthy of the
  greatest of modern generals, and, indeed, belongs to an entirely different
  walk of art from the comparatively rude combinations of the generals of the
  Republic. A division of the army with the stores, military engines, and heavy
  baggage was embarked on a flotilla, which sailed to the mouth of the Elbe,
  and by that hitherto unexplored avenue penetrated to the interior of the
  country. Tiberius himself, at the head of the grand army, marched by
  Paderborn and Brunswick to meet the corps so detached, and the junction was
  effected with admirable precision at a given point. Thus the Roman army was
  placed at once in the heart of Germany, with all appliances for a campaign,
  and its subsistence assured. There a great battle was fought and won; and,
  although the army was marched back to Paderborn on the approach of winter, it
  is evident, from subsequent operations, that resistance in North Germany
  between the Rhine and the Elbe was at an end.</p>

  <p>In the following year Tiberius planned a campaign of even greater
  magnitude, and with combinations still more audacious. This was nothing, less
  than an invasion of Bohemia, where, encircled by mountains, lay the strength
  of the South Germans. For this purpose he proposed to place himself at the
  head of the army of Pannonia (a province corresponding to Southern Austria,
  Croatia, and Western Hungary), and to cross the Danube near Vienna, while one
  of his lieutenants led the army of the Rhine through the Black Forest by the
  route so well known since to French armies. A junction was to be effected in
  Bohemia. The execution of this grand plan, the vastest operation ever
  contemplated by a Roman general, had already commenced. Both armies were
  converging on Bohemia, when the whole of Pannonia and Dalmatia burst into a
  blaze of insurrection in the rear of Tiberius. He had conquered this country
  himself seventeen years before, and he believed it to be so thoroughly
  subdued that he had ventured to make it the base of his operations against
  Bohemia. But when the warlike Pannonians saw the Roman legions cross the
  Danube and plunge into Central Germany, the temptation was too great for
  them, and they conceived the hope, not only of cutting off Tiberius, but of
  invading Italy, for they were well aware that there was not a soldier between
  them and Rome. The insurrection spread. Dalmatia and Illyria took fire. The
  crisis was one of awful peril, such, says Suetonius, as Rome had not known
  since the days of Hannibal. Augustus hastily levied troops, and even filled
  their ranks from the slave population, telling the Senate that the Pannonians
  might be before the walls of Rome in ten days. As for Tiberius his position
  was like that of Napoleon at Moscow. Just as a splendid success seemed within
  his grasp he found himself obliged to fight for his own safety and that of
  Italy. And now his consummate generalship shone forth. He drew his army back
  across the Danube without loss, and set himself to commence afresh the
  conquest of the revolted districts.</p>

  <p>For three years did the stubborn contest continue, first in Pannonia,
  afterwards in Dalmatia. The historian Velleius, who served through these
  campaigns, speaks with professional enthusiasm of the skill with which
  Tiberius handled his troops, the care he took for their comfort, and the fine
  example he set of energy and endurance. Roman generals, in these times, had
  got into the lazy habit of being carried in litters. But Tiberius invariably
  made his marches on horseback at the head of his troops. The general's litter
  was appropriated to the use of sick or wounded officers. "I myself," says
  Velleius, "and many others, had the advantage of it." It is related, as
  another instance of his preference for the antique simplicity of manners,
  that, like Cato of Utica, he always sat at his dinner instead of reclining,
  according to the luxurious fashion introduced from Greece. I mention these
  little traits because they come from an eye-witness, and are characteristic
  of the man. His whole life was a protest against what he regarded as the
  degeneracy of his age from the serious disposition, the stiff discipline, and
  the simple habits of ancient Rome.</p>

  <p>Hardly had the Pannonian and Dalmatian war been brought to a prosperous
  conclusion, when news arrived of a terrible disaster in North Germany. Varus,
  whom Augustus had appointed governor of the newly-conquered province between
  the Rhine and the Elbe, was unfortunately a very unfit man for his post. He
  was more of a lawyer than a general, and was chiefly bent on filling his
  pockets. The task before him was not an arduous one; but it demanded honesty,
  diligence, and, above all things, tact. The North Germans had been thoroughly
  beaten, and had no thought of renewing the struggle. Roman merchants were
  penetrating the country, and the natives, like all other Europeans, were
  taking kindly to Roman manners, and enlisting freely in the Roman armies.
  Varus spoilt all. He vexed the half-tamed savages with his pettifogging
  exactions, while by his neglect of all military precautions he tempted them
  to insurrection.</p>

  <p>A young chieftain, called Arminius, who had been admitted to Roman
  citizenship, and had served in the Roman Sahibhe Nana Salïib of his
  day&mdash;decoyed Varus to his ruin. But few escaped to the Rhine to tell the
  tale. The prisoners were put to death with torture. Thus was destroyed an
  army (says Velleius, who had formerly served in it) which for valour,
  discipline, and experience was the finest Rome then possessed. It was a loss
  that could not soon be replaced, for it took a training of many years to make
  a perfect Roman soldier. But the loss of the new province was a more
  irreparable blow. It was like our own disaster in Affghanistan. Vengeance
  might be taken; the stain on military honour might be wiped out; but
  re-occupation had to be indefinitely postponed.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Tiberius could now leave Pannonia and place himself on the
  scene of danger. Anxious above all things that the Roman prestige might be
  re-established, he again led an army into Germany. It is recorded, as marking
  the gravity of the occasion, that he who in all his other wars had been
  accustomed to keep his plans locked in his bosom, and to rely solely upon
  himself, now discussed them freely with his officers. He seems to have
  attributed the late disaster to the luxurious habits which had crept into the
  camp. For we read that when his army was about to cross the Rhine into
  Germany he posted himself on the bridge, and in person examined all the
  baggage to see that the limits prescribed by his regulations were not
  exceeded. Arrived in the enemy's country, he himself set the example of
  endurance and simplicity. He took his meals sitting on the bare ground.
  Though now in his fifty-third year, he gave up his tent and slept in the open
  air. Every night before he lay down to rest he issued his orders for next day
  to all his officers in writing. Any officer who did not understand them was
  enjoined to come to the general himself for explanation at any hour of the
  night. The expedition was successful. That is to say, the Germans were beaten
  wherever they showed themselves. But when the summer was come to an end the
  Roman army was led back across the Rhine, which river, and not the Elbe, was
  henceforth the frontier of the empire. As for the Germans, they relapsed into
  that barbarism of which their country and ours still exhibit many ill
  effects.</p>

  <p>With this campaign the long and brilliant career of Tiberius as a soldier
  closes. Like Wellington, whom as a general he much resembles, he had never
  experienced a defeat. His officer Velleius records with gratitude that he was
  careful of his soldiers' lives, and never allowed his judgment to be
  influenced either by the criminal desire of gathering glory for himself or by
  the clamours and criticisms of the camp, because (says Velleius) he cared
  less for what the world would say than for the approval of his own
  conscience.* Such was Tiberius as a general, and not otherwise did he carry
  himself as a statesman.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "Utilia speciosis praeferens, quodque semper eum
  facientem vidi in omnibus bellis, quae probanda essent, non gum utique
  probarentur seqnens."&mdash;(ii. 113.)<br>
  <br>
  "Ante conscientiae quam fame consultum."&mdash;(ii. 115.)</p>

  <p>Soon after this Augustus died. Up to this time calumny itself has nothing
  to say against Tiberius. Few men have lived to the age of fifty-six in the
  full blaze of a public career, and in the possession of absolute power (for a
  Roman general in the provinces was absolute), with so little to regret and so
  much to remember with honourable pride. At this point commences the narrative
  of Tacitus, and we have henceforth to deal with a tissue of systematic
  detraction, sly insinuation, and open invective unparalleled in political
  biography. Ninety-nine educated men out of a hundred know nothing of Tiberius
  but what Tacitus is pleased to tell them. His previous life is a sealed book.
  But you who have heard what it was, and have already a clear idea of the
  character of the <i>man, you</i> I hope will hold fast by your common sense
  in judging the character of the emperor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a>PART II. *</h2>

  <p class="first">"AN exemplary life and a reputation that stood deservedly
  high,"&mdash;such is the verdict pronounced by Tacitus himself on the first
  fifty-six years of. Tiberius. That in new circumstances and advancing age a
  man who had earned such a character might to some extent deteriorate is
  possible and credible. The mildest temper may be soured by calumny and
  misfortune. The firmest courage may be shaken by a continual sense of
  insecurity. An honourable disposition may be grievously perverted by
  sophisms. But all this within limits.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Considerable additions have been made to this part
  since it was delivered as a lecture.</p>

  <p>The really great criminals of history have been made of other stuff, and
  have not deceived the' penetration of their contemporaries during half a
  century. Nor were the circumstances in which Tiberius now found himself so
  very unlike those which he had already proved. Misfortune had beaten on him
  from his cradle. If as emperor he was haunted by the spectre of
  assassination, as a subject he had known what it was to live for months in
  constant expectation of the death-warrant. He had tasted the bitterness of
  death itself in those four days that preceded his retirement to
  Rhodes&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">Taenarias etiam fauces, alto, ostia Ditis<br>
  Ingressus, Manesque adiit Regemque tremendum.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, an arbitrary, tyrannical or sanguinary temper could not
  but have blazed out during the many years when he had wielded the absolute,
  irresponsible, and often frightfully abused power of a Roman general in his
  province. Here is the moral problem we are called on to solve. It is easy, if
  one is dull, to say that such a life exhibits many virtues and many vices.*
  It is tempting, if one is brilliant, to dispose of it in a cascade of
  epigrams.&dagger; This is to restate the problem, not to solve it. Literary
  men are never disturbed by difficulties and improbabilities so long as their
  periods are neatly rounded.</p>

  can see our way to a probable and consistent theory we shall be satisfied. If
  not, we will confess that all is darkness. But at any rate we will not go on
  repeating a tale that is an insult to plain common-sense.</p>

  <p>Tiberius had been invested with the tribunitian and proconsular powers
  during the lifetime of Augustus, and therefore during the last ten years he
  had been rather his associate in the empire than his heir-apparent.
  Independently of this advantage, there was no one who could for a moment be
  put in comparison with him. Tacitus does indeed labour to produce the
  impression, by insinuation, rather than direct assertion, that the popular
  choice, had it been free, would have fallen on the young Germanicus. No doubt
  the gallant and showy qualities of this young man had made him a general
  favourite. As little doubt that the serious and ascetic manners of Tiberius,
  his shrinking from all idle display, his avowed preference for old Roman
  sobriety and discipline, had made him disliked. But when rulers are to be
  chosen, a people&mdash;or rather, those who in such junctures sway the
  judgment of the people&mdash;will not forget the more solid qualifications
  for government. And it happens that Tiberius did not assume the full powers
  of Augustus at once, as he might have done, but waited until they were urged
  upon him by the Senate. His conduct on this occasion (so hard are some people
  to be pleased) has been generally set down as hypocrisy. The opportunity is
  convenient for saying a few words as to his mental peculiarities. He was not
  a man of thoroughly great and noble mind, like Julius, or Cromwell, or
  Danton. He had not that self-confidence, that sense of superiority, that
  noble carelessness of spirit which cannot be troubled by slander and
  detraction. He was tormented by a perpetual suspicion that he was disliked
  and underrated by his fellow-citizens.</p>

  <p>And yet, on the other hand, he knew that he was an able man. He was
  conscious that he meant well; and he was in a state of chronic indignation
  against his contemporaries because their affections were evidently bestowed
  on less worthy objects. But he was not only a sensitive man: he was a proud
  man. His conscience told him that it was not a noble thing, or a right thing,
  this fretfulness at popular injustice, this eavesdropping, as it were, to
  catch the whisper of vulgar criticism. So he laboured to persuade himself
  that he did not care for it. He started back whenever he found himself doing
  or saying a popular thing. He found comfort in being able to assure himself
  that whatever might be his inner weakness, he had never allowed his action to
  suffer from it. It is recorded of him that a maxim frequently in his mouth
  was, <i>Oderint dum probent</i>&mdash;let them dislike me, provided in their
  hearts they respect me. And even Tacitus drops the remark that he was
  ambitious for the approval of posterity rather than of his contemporaries.
  The words of Velleius, too, will be remembered, that "he cared more for the
  approval of his own conscience than for what the world might say of him."
  These writers, however, only half understood Tiberius. If he had really been
  as indifferent to the opinion of others as they say he was, he would have
  been a greater and happier man. He is not the only man whom a morbid
  sensitiveness has driven to assume a cynical exterior.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The features of Tiberius are well known to us. The
  development of the upper part of the head is truly magnificent. The eyes are,
  as Suetonius says, "praegrandes," but not prominent. The nose is slightly
  aquiline, and there is considerable dissimilarity between the two profiles.
  But what strikes the observer most is the lower part of the face, which
  betrays that deficiency in confidence and resolution which Tiberius was ever
  trying to correct. The mouth is small, and almost as beautiful as that of
  Augustus; the dimpled chin literally insignificant. The face of the fine
  sitting statue in the Vatican has a very marked and, to my mind, pleasing
  expression. In the bust in the British Museum we see the same contrast
  between the upper and lower development, the same peculiar expression, sweet,
  here, almost to feebleness. But it is in the wonderful colossal head at
  Naples that we see the Tiberius of Capre e. I cannot think that it represents
  him in youth. The upper part of course retains its noble proportions. But the
  mouth and chin, originally insignificant, have lost flesh and fallen away.
  There remains a face wasted with misery, on which are written wrongs,
  disappointments, and chagrins.</p>

  <p>Now when Tiberius showed a certain hesitation in accepting the part which
  the Senate pressed upon him, Tacitus is quite right in saying that he desired
  to discover what the principal citizens really thought of it. But the
  suggestion that he was laying a trap for them is as malevolent as it is
  unnecessary. Twenty years before, when he saw his own just claims slighted,
  and the young Agrippas put over his head, he did not stoop to any rivalry
  with them. He proudly flung up office and retired to Rhodes. And after a long
  and careful study of his character, I have little doubt that if the Senate
  had shown any indisposition to trust him with supreme power he would have
  once more retired from public life. I will go further, and take upon me to
  say that any one who believes that in A.D. 14 a <i>coup-d'état</i> was
  possible, and that Tiberius, or any one else, could have stepped into the
  shoes of Augustus in defiance of public opinion, shows a profound ignorance
  of the political situation at that time. It is clear that no one dreamt of
  returning to the so-called republican constitution. The great nobles felt
  towards Augustus and Tiberius as an oligarchy always will feel towards one of
  its members who has overtopped the rest. The grievance was a personal one.
  Each nobleman chafed at the precedence of the chief of the state because he
  coveted it for himself.</p>

  <p>The reigning family came of no royal stock. Their dignity was still green.
  Augustus and Tiberius were both born simple nobles. The English peerage
  submits without soreness to the solitary dignity of our present royal family.
  But if a revolution were to place Lord Russell on the throne, we can
  understand how a Stanley or a Cavendish would feel towards him. That was how
  a Piso or Aemilius felt towards Tiberius. What Tiberius had to dread was not
  any collective action on the part of either people or nobles. The people
  deliberately preferred imperial government. The nobles knew that it was
  inevitable. The real danger was of conspiracy among individual nobles, with a
  view not to overturning the throne, but changing its occupant. Julius had
  fallen under the daggers of such conspirators. The existence of murderous
  plots by nobles of the highest rank against Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, and
  Claudius is beyond dispute. Tiberius, however, had no reason to apprehend
  that a single voice would be publicly raised at Rome against his accession,
  for there was not a single nobleman who could have found a party to support
  him.</p>

  <p>It was indeed possible that the army of the Rhine, which had mutinied for
  increase of pay and other concessions, might proclaim their general,
  Germanicus, emperor if he promised to grant their demands. And it is very
  likely that the lower orders at Rome would have preferred the young prince to
  the old one. But there is not the smallest evidence that the nobility wished
  for Germanicus, and it is intrinsically improbable. If there was one thing of
  which they had a horror, it was military dictation, and they appear to have
  looked anxiously to Tiberius to quell the mutiny. As for Germanicus himself,
  he was well satisfied with his position as adopted son of Tiberius, and could
  not fail to see how necessary it was that the family should stick together.
  The mutiny, therefore, was quelled, and Tiberius was firmly established on
  the throne.*</p>

  <p>Although Tiberius disclaimed all responsibility for the execution of
  Agrippa Postumus&mdash;"the first crime of the new reign," as Tacitus calls
  it&mdash;it was done for his advantage, and whatever blame may attach to it
  he must bear. The story that Augustus ordered the officer who had charge of
  the young man to put him to death as soon as he should hear that the throne
  was vacant, is quite consistent with probability. We know that he regarded
  the existence of his grandson as a public and private calamity. The
  mysterious visit to Planasia of a bed-ridden old man without the knowledge of
  the wife who nursed him we may safely pronounce a ridiculous fiction.</p>

  <p>The remark of Tacitus that Augustus had never had the heart to put to
  death any of his family proves nothing at all. Moreover, that celebrated
  emperor, though of enlightened mind and sweet manners, had not such a thing
  as a heart about him. But from the peculiar language of Tiberius, it seems
  most probable that the order was sent by Livia while her husband still
  breathed, and before the arrival of her son. A more important question is,
  how far it was justifiable. We must remember that an attempt to rescue
  Agrippa and place him at the head of an insurrection was actually in
  progress, and only failed by a few hours. As it was, an impostor who
  personated him caused some commotions. It is often prudent to deal mercifully
  with ordinary rebels. But no Government, whether republican, oligarchical, or
  monarchical, can or ought to pardon any one who advances claims purely
  dynastic. No one worth noticing would now-a-days contend that such claims
  have any validity against a <i>de facto</i> Government; and if they have no
  validity, then to advance them is a heinous crime, for which death is the
  only appropriate penalty.</p>

  <p>Even where there has been much to excite our sympathy, as in the cases of
  Lady Jane Grey and the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, the public welfare
  clearly demanded that the pretender should be put out of the way. The young
  Agrippa bad no title to rule except that he was the nearest male relative of
  the late chief of the state, in a country where hereditary succession had not
  been established, and in fact never was established. The historians are
  unanimous as to his character.*</p>

  <p>In any modern European monarchy, so much have we improved on ancient
  models, this vicious brute would have been recognised as heir-apparent. But
  Augustus established another precedent for Roman Imperialism. When Agrippa
  protested fiercely against the adoption of Tiberius, his grandfather
  disinherited and banished him, and afterwards, as he continued refractory,
  caused him to be condemned by a decree of the Senate to military custody for
  life Those who call his execution a crime had better say at once that
  Tiberius should have yielded the throne to him. It is worthy of remark that
  his sister Agrippina does not appear to have resented or regretted the
  removal of one who was no less formidable a rival to Germanicus than to
  Tiberius.</p>

  <p>The relations of Tiberius with Germanicus have been made by Tacitus the
  chief point of interest during the first five years of the reign. I believe
  the impression produced on most readers is that Germanicus was such a godlike
  young person, and his wife Agrippina such a model of a woman, that a
  melancholy old widower like Tiberius, who had no other claim to govern than a
  life spent in the service of the state, ought to have shuffled himself away
  somewhere, and made room for the brilliant young couple. A more perverse view
  could not be taken.</p>

  <p>Germanicus was, no doubt, a gallant and amiable man, and it is much to his
  credit that he seems to have harboured no treasonable or undutiful thought
  towards his adopted father. But as a general and administmistakee was a
  mistakç. It is easy to see, even from the highly-coloured narrative of
  Tacitus, that his campaigns in Germany were disastrous failures. After the
  defeat of Varus, the wisest course would have been to wait a few years, and
  not resume the attempt to conquer the barbarians until they should have been
  partially civilised by contact with the empire. To harass them with fruitless
  and destructive raids was only to plunge them deeper into barbarism and
  prevent commercial intercourse; and to come off second best in such work as
  Germanicus generally did, was to destroy all respect for the Roman arms.
  Tiberius therefore acted wisely in recalling him and sending him to the East,
  where he could do less mischief. There he died, and his death is attributed
  to Tiberius. As the crime was supposed to have been effected by enchantment
  and sorcery, perhaps I need say no more about it.</p>

  <p>The whole conduct of Tiberius towards Germanicus, as related by Tacitus
  himself, is absolutely faultless; the comments and insinuations are
  unsupported by any facts, and are often demonstrably inconsistent with facts.
  They should, at least, warn the reader betimes of the animus of the author.
  One point is somewhat obscure. Why did Tiberius send Piso to Syria? The Pisos
  were supposed to look with peculiar jealousy on the elevation of the Julian
  and Claudian houses. This Piso was a violent, haughty man scarcely concealing
  his disaffection, who, though he could not deny the noble birth of Tiberius,
  despised the Vipsanian and Pomponian puddle that ran in the veins of his
  son.* He was therefore just the sort of man that Tiberius always avoided
  sending into the provinces. The suggestion that Piso was selected to be a
  thorn in the side of Germanicus is too absurd. It would be an instance of
  cutting off one's nose to spite one's face if ever there was one.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Vix Tiberio concedere; liberos ejus ut multum infra
  despectare.&mdash;Tac. Ann. II 43.</p>

  <p>I would offer an hypothesis, which, whether true or not, at least explains
  the facts. Plancina, the wife of Piso, was, as we know, a special favourite
  of the empress-mother, whose wishes Tiberius never thwarted even when he
  fretted at them. What was more likely than that she insisted on a province
  for Piso? Tiberius, fearing that Piso, once at the head of legions, would
  give trouble, sent Germanicus into the East, with extraordinary powers, to
  keep him in check. Tacitus himself drops the remark that Tiberius thought
  himself safer when the legions were in the hands of Germanicus and Drusus. On
  the death of Germanicus, Piso did actually raise a mutiny in Syria. The
  attitude of Tiberius to Piso on his trial was eminently dignified and just.
  He might have gained applause by crushing him on the ridiculous charge of
  poisoning: he scorned to do so. But the crime of mutiny was clearly proved,
  and he would not overlook it.</p>

  <p>Let me endeavour now to give an idea of the main features of the reign of
  Tiberius. Julius Caesar had overthrown the aristocracy as the champion, first
  of the Roman commonalty, and secondly, of the subject provinces. His
  successors never forgot that these were the principles on which the throne
  rested. Vast as the empire was, equal citizenship, with some trifling
  exceptions, was still confined to the inhabitants of Italy, and did not
  embrace much more than four million adult males. The rest of the Roman world
  was governed by those four millions, and stood to them in just the same
  relation as the nations of India do to you. Under the senatorial government
  they had been plundered and harassed with terrible uniformity. The
  establishment of the empire under Augustus had brought them some relief. To
  these poor provincials it was like stepping out of hell. But many abuses
  still remained. The Roman governors were generally of the noble class, and
  oppression and extortion were still common, though not on such a frightful
  scale as formerly. Those who attentively consider the reign of Tiberius will
  see that a great point, if not the central point, of his policy was the
  promotion of the interests of the provincials.</p>

  <p>The ordinary reader does not notice these things till they are pointed out
  to him. For instance, when he reads that upon the destruction of twelve great
  cities in Asia by earthquake, Tiberius not only remitted the taxes for five
  years, but contributed large sums from his private fortune to help the
  inhabitants, he thinks it a proper but very natural measure. It does not
  occur to him that it was a novelty for a Roman to spend his money on the
  provinces; that Cato or Cicero would have stood aghast at it, and that it was
  doubtless loudly condemned by the citizens of Rome, rich and poor alike, who
  could not understand that provincials existed for anything else than to pour
  their wealth into the metropolis.</p>

  <p>Again, in the days of the republic, governors of provinces used to be
  changed at least every three years. The nobles all wanted their turn of
  plunder. Tiberius made it a practice to retain a governor several years in
  his post. No doubt this innovation was bitterly resented in aristocratic
  circles; and Tacitus does, in fact, set it down as one of the delinquencies
  of Tiberius, and gives malevolent explanations of it. But the provincial
  historian, Josephus, looks at it very differently, and tells us that Tiberius
  pursued this policy avowedly with the object of saving the provinces from the
  keen appetites of new governors.</p>

  <p>We find the cities of Asia voting a temple to Tiberius, because he had
  more than once brought to trial at Rome governors who had been guilty of
  oppression in the East. We find him refusing to drive a harder bargain with
  the farmers of taxes, who were thought to be making too good a thing of it,
  because, he said, they would put the screw on the tax-payers. There were
  certain provinces still administered by the Senate, and we find them
  imploring that they might be administered by the Emperor. Thus we can have no
  doubt that the reign of Tiberius, whatever it was in the metropolis (and to
  that I will come presently), was in all other parts of the empire beneficent
  to an extent hitherto unknown. We get these few glimpses from Tacitus. It
  makes one indignant that when that writer might have left us the inestimable
  historical treasure of a complete picture of Imperial administration
  throughout the Roman world, he should have preferred to fill his pages with
  the grievances of the nobles, who sat grumbling and plotting at Rome. But
  what is the testimony of provincial writers? You have heard the remark I
  quoted from Josephus. More emphatic still is the testimony of Philo, another
  Jew, writing not during the life of Tiberius, when he might be suspected of
  flattery, but shortly after his death. He winds up a long description of the
  general prosperity and happiness under the late reign by declaring that "the
  Saturnian age of the poets might no longer be regarded as a fiction, so
  nearly was it revived in the life of that blessed era."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Quoted at length by Mr. Merivale, v. 382.</p>

  <p>Tacitus envies the old historians who chronicled "discordias consulum
  adversum tribunos, agrarias frumentariasqué leges, plebis et optimatium
  certamina." Whether one in a hundred of his fellow-subjects would have cared
  to return to those fine old times is a question which does not seem to have
  occurred to him. History has always been written (except perhaps in the
  middle ages, when there was a church,) by the rich or their friends. Rulers
  who have displeased that class have suffered accordingly. But how would
  contemporary history look if recorded by an Irish peasant or a Spitalfields
  weaver? Would he see it <i>en beau</i>?</p>

  <p>While careful not to burden his subjects, Tiberius was eminently
  economical in his financial management. For instance, he cut down the
  expenditure on gladiatorial exhibitions, and abstained from encouraging them
  by his presence. This is set down in the catalogue of his offences by
  Tacitus, and probably there was not one of his measures which made him so
  unpopular in Rome. He made it a rule not to give donatives to the armies, a
  pernicious practice pursued by his predecessor and successors. Yet by
  punctual payment of their wages he kept them in discipline and obedience. In
  his own life he continued to set an example of simplicity. While the great
  nobles were squandering their vast revenues in vulgar ostentation and
  debauchery, the Emperor lived in the plainest way, with a small household. He
  economised his private fortune, but, as Tacitus admits, he did not covet that
  of any one else, and even if a legacy was left him he did not accept it
  unless he had been on intimate terms with the testator. But though he
  abhorred wasting money on frivolity, he could be splendidly generous in the
  right place. His munificence to provincial cities has already been mentioned.
  Twice in his reign, when large districts of Rome had been destroyed by fire,
  he contributed enormous sums from his private fortune to repair the damage.*
  But such munifience brought him no credit in the eyes of the nobility, who
  were discontented because they could not live upon the public revengoodas in
  the goôd old times of he republic. We hear of the grandson of the orator
  Hortensias, one of the richest nobles of the republic, coming to the Senate
  and complaining of his poverty, which had been caused by his own dissolute
  life. The Senate wish him to be relieved, but Tiberius reads him a stern
  lecture. Tacitus narrates this as an instance of his unfeeling character, and
  evidently thinks that the money wrung by taxation from the provinces could
  not be better spent than in pensions to needy noblemen.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "Erogandae per honesta pecuniae cupiens; quam virtutem
  diu retinuit quum ceteras exueret."&mdash;Tac. Ann. i. 75. Tacitus never
  mentions anything to the credit of Tiberius without carefully poisoning it.
  The "diu" itself is a <i>suggestio falsi</i>; the most splendid instance of
  the munificence of Tiberius belongs to the last few months of his life.</p>

  <p>We have seen that as a general Tiberius had been indefatigable in
  attention to his duties. He carried this laborious industry from the camp to
  the palace. No slave in Rome worked harder than the Emperor. For several
  years he did not quit Rome, even during the sultry months of autumn, when
  every one who could afford it rushed to the hills or sea-side, but remained
  at his post toiling at state biness, and endeavouring to look after
  everything himself. Indeed, there is no doubt that he carried this too far,
  for a really great ruler shows his ability in nothing so much as in knowing
  how to make other people work for him. Tiberius could not employ the great
  nobles as his ministers. They were disaffected, and, besides, would have
  disdained any functions except the government of provinces. His son Drusus
  (II.) had commanded armies with credit, but seems to have preferred pleasure
  to business.* There was nothing for it, therefore, but to look for a minister
  in a lower rank of society. Such as a minister was Sejanus, whose name,
  perhaps, is even more odious than that of his master.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Never was son more unlike his father. Drusus was not
  <i>méchant</i>, but he was passionate and domineering, and had an ominous
  delight in blood (of gladiators, for instance), which cannot be laid to the
  charge of his father. Tiberius saw these traits in his character, and was
  disturbed by them. "You shall not," he said to him once in the presence of
  several persons, "you shall not break the laws or commit outrages while I am
  alive; and if I find you attempting it, you shall not have the chance of
  doing so when I am dead and gone,"&mdash;a significant threat from such a
  man, which might have more than one meaning.&mdash;Dion,. lvii. 13.</p>

  <p>The charges made against him are, however, very vague, or when they are
  precise, they, for the most part, break down. They amount, in fact, to this,
  that being a middle-class man, he had the audacity to be prime minister, and
  that he was an enemy of the immaculate Agrippina. Agrippina was an ambitious
  woman, with a violent temper, and she made herself the centre of disaffection
  at Rome. She always treated Tiberius as the murderer of her husband, and
  often abused him to his face, in the grossest manner.* He bore her insolence
  very patiently, and so far from harbouring ill-will against her children, he
  treated them as his heirs after the death of his own son Drusus.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The fact is that Agrippina was an intolerable woman.
  During her life she bullied all her contemporaries, and she has bullied
  posterity ever since in the pages of Tacitus. No one can look at her statue
  in the N useum of the Capitol without being satisfied that Germanicus was
  henpecked. The one virtue she is recorded to have possessed is her "pudicitia
  impenetrabilis," surely not such a rare merit in a widow with nine
  children.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that one of the most intimate friends of this paragon of
  propriety, Claudia Pulchra, was a woman of dissolute character, and that her
  children, whom she professed to educate so carefully, turned out abominably.
  The eldest son, Nero, was dissolute and seditious. The second, Drusus (III.),
  is admitted by Tacitus to have been thoroughly bad.* The third was the
  notorious Caligula.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "Atrox Drusi ingenium."&mdash;Ann. iv. 60.</p>

  <p>All the daughters were stained with vice; one of them, the younger
  Agrippina, being the most infamous woman of her time. But the reason why that
  family shines so in the pages of Tacitus, while Tiberius and Sejanus are
  painted so black, is very simple. That younger Agrippina was a very clever
  woman, and she wrote memoirs which we know were in the hands of Tacitus, for
  he quotes them. These memoirs, no doubt, were the main source of the foul
  stream of calumny which has deluged this reign.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "Id ego, a scriptoribus annalium non traditum repperi
  in commentariis Agrippinae filiae, quai Neronis principis mater vitam suam et
  casus suorum poster's memoravit."&mdash;Ann. iv. 53.</p>

  <p>In the twelfth year of his reign Tiberius left Rome, never to return. I
  believe that he had two reasons for doing so. He brooded indignantly over his
  own unpopularity. And just at this time he became aware that in the vile
  gossip of Rome he was accused of horrible licentiousness&mdash;he who during
  a long life had been endeavouring to set an example of stern morality. The
  fact that these scandalous stories were circulating came out by chance during
  a trial at which he was present. He was violently excited. He sprang up and
  claimed to answer such charges on the spot, or to have them investigated by a
  judicial tribunal; and it was with difficulty that his friends could calm
  him.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Tac. Ann. iv. 42. The behaviour of Tiberius on this
  occasion is eminently characteristic. His apparent cynical indifference to
  public opinion was entirely assumed. Conscious of being only too sensitive to
  critics, he tried to steel himself against it. All through life he mistrusted
  his natural impulses in this as in other particulars, and drilled himself on
  a pattern which he considered more noble and manly. The incident at the trial
  of Votienus took him by surprise, and his elaborate calmness forsook him. But
  no doubt this momentary weakness (as he would think it) caused him more
  anguish than the calumnies of Votienus On a subsequent occasion we find him
  insisting with ostentatious indifference that similar filthy libels should be
  recited at length, "patientiam libertatis alien ostentans et contemptor suae
  infamiae," says Tacitus.</p>

  <p>I imagine that this incident filled up the measure of his disgust at his
  fellow-citizens, and decided him to leave their company for ever. His other
  reason was certainly the dread of conspiracies and assassination, for he
  chose Capreaeland of Caprem as his residence, because it had only two
  landing-places, which made police supervision more easy. The military force
  at his disposal in Italy was very small, and we know that he desired to be in
  a place from which he could escape by sea, and reach the army f the Rhine. It
  certainly is painful to see one who had been confronting danger all his life
  reduced to this state of anxiety when approaching the age of threescore and
  ten. But to be surrounded with secret plots, never to know when, how, or from
  whom you may expect the treacherous blow, will at last unnerve the firmest
  courage. Because Tiberius escaped such plots it is assumed that he was in no
  danger; whereas it was probably his precautions which saved him.</p>

  <p>Soon after his departure from Rome, he caused Agrippina and her eldest
  son, Nero, to be arrested. The latter was eventually put to death. Agrippina
  died in prison two or three years afterwards. That they were bitterly hostile
  to Tiberius is admitted. How far they had proceeded in the path of treason it
  is impossible for us now to say, since we have not got Tiberius's version of
  the facts. The persistent assumption of Tacitus that he had a spite against
  that family is sufficiently disproved by the fact that he had marked out Nero
  as his successor, and that he did actually make the third son, Caius, his
  heir, in preference to his own grandson. He wished to put the young men
  through a course of training such as he had undergone himself, that they
  might be fit in time to rule the world. But the odds are heavy against
  Porphyrogeniti. They were already quarrelling for the throne which they had
  done nothing to earn. Nero was the idol of his mother. Drusus (III.) was
  backed by Sejanus. Agrippina, who was burning to be empress-mother,* was
  afraid that Sejanus would induce Tiberius to pass over Nero, and she was
  therefore caballing and intriguing and courting the populace, not, perhaps,
  with any definite design of rebelling against the Emperor&mdash;if he would
  only make haste and die&mdash;but certainly to overthrow the minister.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Aequi impatiens, dominandi avida."&mdash;Tac. Ann. vi.
  25.</p>

  <p>Her offence, putting it at its lightest, was just that of Elizabeth's
  favourite, Essex, whose aim was to destroy his personal enemies, and force
  the queen to recognise James as her successor. Tacitus says that Nero was
  naturally unassuming, but that he was surrounded by men hungry for power, who
  persuaded him that both the army and the populace were only waiting for him
  to declare himself; and he admits that under this bad influence the young man
  used disloyal language. Plans of action were actually discussed, for some of
  the party urged Nero and Agrippina to go to the army of the Rhine, or to
  harangue the crowd in the Forum. Tacitus may say that these advisers were
  agents of Sejanus; but that is because he has nothing else to say. Tiberius
  had tolerated the outrageous calumnies and insults of Agrippina for ten years
  with imperturbable patience, knowing that female politicians had never been
  formidable at Rome. But as soon as there was a young man to deal with, the
  danger became real.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The feelings of Tiberius were exactly those of Queen
  Elizabeth, whose severity to Catherine Grey (certainly not an Agrippina), and
  machinations against James (even when she meant him to be her successor),
  were prompted by her knowledge that to recognise an heir would be to sign her
  own death-warrant. "The like had never been demanded of any prince, to
  declare an heir-presumptive in his lifetime; she was not so foolish as to
  hang a winding-sheet before her eyes."&mdash;(Froude,vii. 373.) "There were
  some among them (a deputation of peers) who had placed their swords at her
  disposal when her sister was on the throne, and had invited her to seize the
  crown; she knew but too well that if she allowed a successor to be named,
  there would be found men who would approach him or her with the same
  encouragement to disturb the peace of the realm."&mdash;viii. 315.</p>

  <p>The arrest of Nero and Agrippina was generally attributed to Sejanus, and
  probably with truth, for Sejanus was now aiming at e throne.* He had married
  a niece of Tiberius, and thought his chance no worse than that of Tiberius
  himself had been under Augustus. But he was too impatient to wait for his
  master's death, and entered into a formidable conspiracy. The old man,
  however, was determined not to be robbed of life or sceptre by any one, for
  which I do not blame him; and he struck down Sejanus, as he had struck down
  Agrippina.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* It was in itself an honourable ambition, though in the
  eyes of the aristocracy unpardonable. The intrigue with Livilla during her
  husband's life, and the murder of Drusus (II.), were probably inventions of
  his divorced wife, Apicata. (Compare Dion, lviii. 11.) In his hostility to
  Agrippina and Nero he was acting in self-defence and in the interest of his
  master, but his dealings with Drusus (III.) seem inexcusable.</p>

  <p>It may perhaps be thought that I have been a long time coming to the main
  charge which has been brought against Tiberius&mdash;that of cruelty. I
  assure you I have no intention of shirking it. But as his accusers themselves
  can only level it at the last few years of his life, I do not know why it
  should occupy more than the last few minutes of this lecture. Tacitus, by
  constantly harping upon it, has managed to make it the most prominent feature
  of his character. In dealing with it I must ask you to remember that we have
  no contemporary historian to guide us, for Velleius appears to have died in
  the middle of the reign, and has left only some brief remarks on it, which,
  so far as they go, are very laudatory, while Josephus and Philo, living in
  the East, trouble themselves little with what was going on at Rome, except so
  far as it affects the Jews. We depend on Tacitus and Suetonius, who both
  lived many years afterwards, and drew their materials from the memoirs of
  Agrippina. If, therefore, I can show you from the pages of Tacitus himself
  that the charge of cruelty, on close examination, shrinks to very small
  dimensions, I think I have a right to protest against the injustice which
  will not allow such a life as I have described to weigh in the balance of
  credibility somewhat heavier than the improbable assertions of studied
  malevolence.</p>

  <p>For this purpose I will divide the reign into two parts. The first
  consists of the twelve years before Tiberius left Rome, during which he was,
  according to Tacitus, more directly responsible for what was done than
  afterwards. Tacitus leaves on his reader the impression that both periods
  were reigns of terror, no man knowing when his turn would come to be
  devoured.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "Non enim Tiberius non adcusatores fatiscebant (seventh
  year of the reign). His tam assiduis tamque maestis modica laetitia
  interjicitur (tenth year). Nos saeva jussa continuas adcusationes fallaces
  amicitias perniciem innocentium et easdem exitu causas conjungimus, obvia
  rerun similitudine et satietate (eleventh year)."</p>

  <p>Everything resembling a state trial is paraded and made the most of.* Now,
  how many such cases do you suppose there were in those twelve years, on the
  showing of Tacitus himself? There were thirty-seven in all. And what sort of
  cases were they? An analysis of them will surprise you. Twelve were for
  offences against the Emperor or his family (of which six were stopped by
  Tiberius, or resulted in acquittal or pardon), six were for extortion or
  oppression in the provinces, seven for adultery or poisoning, four for false
  accusation, three for complicity with foreign enemies, two for libel, one for
  murder, one for corrupt adminstration of justice, one for mutiny.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* That the list of trials given by Tacitus is complete
  (if not something more), is not only fairly to be presumed from the spirit he
  shows but is distinctly stated by himself. "Neque sum ignarus a plerisque
  scriptoribus omissa multorum pericula et poenas, dum copia fatiscunt, aut,
  quae ipsis nimia et moesta fuerant ne pari taedio lectures adficerent,
  verentur. Nobis pleraque digna cognitu obvenere, quamquam ab aliis
  incelebrata."&mdash;Ann. vi. 7.</p>

  <p>And now, what was the fate of these defendants? Prepare to be astonished
  still more. Fourteen were banished, six committed suicide before sentence,
  two were expelled the Senate, of five the prosecution was stopped by Tiberius
  in his capacity as tribune, three were acquitted, one was pardoned; of five
  the punishment is not mentioned, but it was probably banishment; and one,
  just one was executed.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Besides these, there were executed, without trial, the
  two state prisoners left by Augustus&mdash;Agrippa Postumus and Sempronius
  the paramour of Julia. A pseudo-Agrippa and one Curtisius who was heading a
  slave insurrection, were taken in arms and put to death by martial law. A
  decree of the Senate banished all astrologers from Italy, and two of them
  were put to death. Many of the persons whose cases are enumerated above were
  charged with several crimes, "majestas" being one; and it is generally, but
  very unwarrantably, assumed that all these cases are to be regarded as
  political trials. But it had always been the custom at Rome for the accuser
  to dilate, not merely on the offence which was the immediate cause of the
  prosecution, but on every other charge, strong or weak, which there was the
  smallest pretext for urging. "Majestas," which we shortly translate
  "treason," had originally meant any act which damaged the state. A law of
  Saturninus had extended it to outrages on a tribune. Cicero interpreted it to
  include removing a public statue. So vague a charge was, therefore, naturally
  added as a count to every indictment of a public character; but it does not
  follow that either accuser or judges laid serious stress on it. When Tacitus
  writes, "Ancharius Priscus Caesium Cordum proconsulem Crete postulaverat
  repetundis, addito majestatis crimine quid turn omnium accusationum
  complementum erat," it is absurd to treat Cordus as a political offender. In
  "republican" times, indeed, he might have plundered Crete with impunity, and
  in that sense his friends might fairly regard him as a victim of
  Imperialism.</p>

  <p>This man was tried and condemned by the Senate in the absence of Tiberius
  from Rome, and executed immediately. When Tiberius returned he blamed the
  haste of the Senate, praised one senator who had opposed it, and caused a
  decree to be made that in future ten days should intervene between sentence
  and execution. I think it must be admitted that the first twelve years, at
  all events, of this monster, were not only not cruel, but merciful to a
  degree which is unparalleled in any reign, ancient or modern. It is also
  worth noticing that the state offenders of Tiberius were not sent to penal
  servitude, but lived comfortably in their banishment, as we find from a
  provision that they should not take more than twenty slaves with them. The
  fact is that the state trials of Tiberius afford the clearest indication of
  the basis on which his power rested. He crushed a lawless nobility, and
  dragged to justice governors who had been guilty of oppression and outrages
  in the provinces, and who found sympathy among their own class as similar
  criminals do now. But he was not "cerdonibus timendus." He had nothing to
  fear from the great mass of his fellow-citizens. Can the governments of
  modern Europe say as much?</p>

  <p>In the remaining eleven years of the reign we cannot analyse the
  prosecutions with the same exactness, because part of the narrative of
  Tacitus is lost if there was greater severity it was not uncalled for. Those
  who are incredulous as to the treason of Agrippina and Nero will at least not
  dispute that the conspiracy of Sejanus was of a most formidable character.
  Moreover, Tiberius was absent from Rome, and we know that while he had
  remained in the metropolis his influence had been repeatedly, and we may
  almost say steadily, exercised to prevent the law being made an instrument of
  persecution. By whom? it may be asked. It is too commonly forgotten that
  informers and state trials were no new growth of the empire. The system
  sprang up under the republic. Every young man, on entering public life,
  looked about for some one to impeach as a means of bringing himself into
  public notice. The informer did not employ an advocate as with us. He wanted
  an opportunity for airing his eloquence&mdash;the accomplishment to which all
  his education had been directed. Probably there was not a single man of any
  note who had not in his time been a prosecutor or defendant, or both.* A few
  of the prosecutions for treason were no doubt directed or prompted by
  Tiberius; but there is not the smallest evidence that he was in any way
  responsible for the majority of them.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The elder Cato was prosecuted near fifty times, and was
  himself indefatigable in prosecuting others.&mdash;Plutarch, Cato Major, xv.
  The exemption from punishment of a condemned criminal if he turned informer
  was the provision of a law carried by Pompeius.&mdash;Appian, de Bell. Civ.,
  ii. 24.</p>

  <p>The system was a voluntary and self-acting one. The judges were generally
  the Senate. Now, though the great nobles, as a rule, would have seats in the
  Senate, it was chiefly filled with supporters of Imperialism. It was like the
  assembly now sitting in Paris, which, as every one knows, though containing a
  bitter opposition, is more Napoleonist than Napoleon himself. There was,
  therefore, a continual tendency to severity quite independently of Tiberius.
  If it is said that he ought to have checked his partisans, the answer is that
  in the first half of his reign he did repeatedly check them, and that
  instances are not wanting in the last half.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* For discouragement of informers see Tac. Ann. iii. 19,
  37, 51, 56, 70; iv. 36; vi. 30. I may cite Mr. Merivale, who is by no means
  disposed to deal gently with Tiberius: "Certain it is that the records of the
  earlier years of the Tiberian despotism abound in evidence of the Emperor's
  solicitude for the pure administration of justice, and the constant struggle
  in which he was engaged with the reckless spirit of violence and cruelty of
  which accusers and judges equally partook. Ultimately his own, steadfastness
  and constancy gave way. He yielded to the torrent which he was no longer able
  to stem."&mdash;v. 173.</p>

  <p>His efforts in that direction may have been much more frequent and
  energetic than we know of, for Tacitus is not likely to enlarge on them more
  than he can help. After all, the main question is, Were these condemned
  people guilty or not? If no one stops to ask it, it is because all the
  unfavourable criticisms on Tiberius are based on the tacit assumption that he
  had no right to be where he was, and that conspiracy was rather creditable
  than otherwise. But those who believe, as I do, that his government rested on
  the only true basis for any government, namely, the welfare of the community,
  and the consent of the large majority of the governed, will hold that it was
  not only his right, but his duty, to lay a heavy hand on the aristocracy if
  they would not acquiesce.</p>

  <p>During the ten years following the departure of Tiberius from Rome,
  Tacitus records fifty-seven instances of real or supposed offenders against
  the Emperor. Of these, eighteen seem to have been executed, eighteen
  committed suicide, eight were acquitted or spared, three were banished, three
  purchased safety by turning informers, one was expelled the Senate, and of
  six the fate is not mentioned.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Among the fifty-seven cases above mentioned I have
  included four in which the offence is not clearly specified, and possibly was
  not political. On the other hand, it must be remembered that there is a
  hiatus of nearly three years in the narrative of Tacitus.</p>

  <p>Most of them are charged with complicity in the conspiracy of Sejanus. It
  must be remembered that Sejanus was detested by the aristocracy, and when he
  fell they thirsted for vengeance on all his friends. If there was any undue
  severity then it is more fairly chargeable on the Senate than on the
  Emperor.* In addition to the figures given above, Tacitus says that two years
  after the fall of Sejanus all his friends who remained in prison were put to
  death, without trial, in one day; and he describes a scene of carnage like a
  battle-field. Suetonius, evidently alluding to the same occasion, speaks of
  twenty persons being executed in one day. I suspect they were both copying
  from some random writer; for we find a brother and uncle of Sejanus alive
  afterwards, though the former had been guilty of an elaborate insult to
  Tiberius.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The career and fate of Sejanus strikingly resemble
  those of a much better man, Thomas Cromwell. Both had incurred the savage
  hatred of the class into whwhichd above which they had raised themselves.
  When Tiberius and Henry VIII. saw cause to distrust their ministers they had
  only to abandon them to the nobles, who rushed on them like a pack of hounds.
  If, as Tacitus says, the commonalty joined in the hunt, their fury was more
  transient as it is less intelligible than that of the nobility. "Placitum
  posthac ut in reliquos Sejani liberos adverteretur; vanescente quamquam
  plebis ira, ac plerisque per priora subplicia lenitis."&mdash;Tac. Ann. v. 9.
  The word "placitum" fixes this barbarity on the Senate.</p>

  <p>There is another topic which cannot be easily handled here, but which it
  is impossible entirely to pass over. You are probably aware that Tiberius is
  charged with having lapsed in his later years into the foulest
  licentiousness. Now this a sort of charge which from its nature is not
  capable of direct disproof. A writer who falsifies public events generally
  lays himself open to refutation. But when he makes assertions as to matters
  which are essentially of a private and secret character, how are we to meet
  him? We can only appeal to probability. I have shown you what the character
  of Tiberius was through a long life. A more clearly-marked character is not
  to be found in history. I ask you, Is it credible that such a man would break
  out into dissolute habits at the age of sixty-eight? If he did he would be in
  his grave in a few months, if not weeks. But Tiberius lived ten years at
  Capreae. He lived to be seventy-eight, and preserved extraordinary vigour of
  mind and body to the last day of his life. Any medical man will tell you that
  this single fact is a more conclusive refutation of these shameful calumnies
  than a thousand testimonials to character. You may ask me whence these
  calumnies sprung, and how they obtained currency. Whenever a sovereign
  retires from publicity, vile scandals of this kind invariably make their
  appearance. They may be repeated by the popular voice, but it is not the
  people which invents them. They are generated in fashionable society, among
  the idlers and sycophants who hang about courts. On such persons a life of
  domestic virtue imposes no respect. It adds flavour to the scandal. William
  III. was a man of finer character than Tiberius, but he resembled him in his
  unsocial habits and forbidding demeanour, and he did not in his lifetime
  escape the same foul charges which have clung more persistently to the Roman
  emperor. In the vile gossip of Jacobite circles Loo was a Capreae, and Lady
  Orkney less fastidious than Mallonia.* When such tales are improbable in
  themselves, and come to us through suspicious channels, it is but simple
  justice to the defenceless dead to reject them, or at least to hold them not
  proven.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Sueton. Tiberius, 44.</p>

  <p>In concluding this lecture let me say that I hope no one will go away with
  the impression that, because I approve of the government of the Caesars, I am
  therefore enamoured of modern Imperialism. The establishment of the empire at
  Rome was a distinct step in advance. It was the only way in which ancient
  civilization could be kept tog ether. It was an enormous boon to ninety-nine
  out of every hundred of the population. Modern Imperialism is retrograde. It
  prohibits a free press. It refuses the right of public meeting. It fosters
  the military spirit. Lastly, it returns to the hereditary principle, which
  was irrevocably condemned by the immortal French Revolution. It is not so bad
  as the government of a privileged class. That is all that can be said for it.
  But no government can meet the wants of modern society unless, whatever be
  its form, it is in spirit Republican.</p>

  <p class="first">IN the spring of 1787 France was within twenty-four months
  of the Revolution. Great questions, which had been slowly preparing for
  several centuries, and rapidly ripening during fifteen or twenty years, were
  on the point of being summarily decided. Privileges criticised, no doubt, but
  still flourishing in full vigour and activity, tough enough apparently to
  stand against many a rude shock before they should finally succumb, were
  within three short years to be not only dead, but beginning to pass out of
  mind. Ali thinking men had long foreseen the Revolution&mdash;nay, had
  confidently predicted it. Yet, after all, it took them by surprise. It is
  easy to calculate how many days or hours you are from Niagara; but the rapids
  once entered, you may be wrong as to the minutes. And as historical facts
  cannot be soberly measured and judged by the man who has witnessed them or
  lived immediately after them, so is it no less true that the relative
  proportions of coming events are less distinctly apprehended as they approach
  and become of practical interest, than when they are first descried on the
  far horizon by cool speculation.</p>

  <p>France had drifted under the shadow of the Revolution when Louis XVI.
  opened the Assembly of Notables on the 22nd of February, 1787.</p>

  <p>The student who approaches the history of these eventful months, naturally
  seeks to discover their central point of interest. Of all the great questions
  awaiting solution, on which was the battle fought? What was the popular cry?
  Was it in Church or State, in the army or the law, in the tenure of land or
  the regulation of commerce, that men clamoured most loudly for reform?
  Nothing of the sort. The issue raised was infinitely simpler. Shall M. de
  Calonne continue in power, or shall he make way for M. Necker?</p>

    <p class="caption">Portrait of Jacques Necker.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Necker was not an untried man. He had presided over the finances in the
  Maurepas ministry. Maurepas is a character we seem to know. "Nimble old man,
  who for all emergencies has his light jest; and even in the worst confusion
  will emerge, cork-like, unsunk! Small care to him is Perfectibility, Progress
  of the Species, and <i>Astraea Redux</i>; good only that a man of light wit,
  verging towards fourscore can, in the seat of authority, feel himself
  important among men. In courtier dialect he is now named 'the Nestor of
  France,'&mdash;such governing Nestor as France has." Under such a leader an
  earnest politician had an unsatisfactory time of it. Necker was an
  exceedingly clever man, and was possessed of many qualities which win, and
  some that deserve, popularity. He was not a great political economist, like
  Turgot; but he had a wonderful power of mastering financial details, which
  was equalled only by his skill in manipulating, or, as some said, in cooking
  them. The confidence reposed in him by great capitalists was unbounded, and,
  as is frequently the case with that tribe, blind and childish. They took for
  granted that he could work miracles, and he was gratified by their
  superstition. His intellect, not being under the control of a strong and
  simple character, embarrassed him by its very acuteness. "He viewed," says
  one who knew him, "every side of a question so elaborately, his prevision was
  so susceptible and scrupulous, that he could see nothing but difficulties."
  Even his admirer M. Louis Blanc allows that he was ever "hesitating between
  the shame of being useless and the fear of being too bold, undecided and
  perplexed just because he saw further than others."</p>

  <p>Necker's ambition was enormous. Yet it was not exactly that craving for
  power which is felt by born rulers of men; it was rather a passion for fame,
  an ardent desire to shine before his contemporaries, to be blessed as the
  saviour of France. He was earnestly bent on doing good, but not by stealth;
  and his hunger for popularity seriously marred his statesmanship. While the
  austere and noble Turgot, in the depth of his love for the oppressed people,
  was braving its ignorant resentment, Necker was picking up a little applause
  by cavilling at the great economist in the name of economy. Turgot thought
  that public opinion stood in sore need of education, and he wished to educate
  it. Necker worshipped it: "L'un parlait au peuple en législateur, et l'autre
  en courtisan.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Droz, vol., i. p. 110.</p>

  <p>When others were in power he was inconsolable. It seemed to him something
  monstrous and unnatural that any one but M. Necker should flourish like a
  green bay-tree. "Je ne sais trop pourquoi l'opinion publique n'est plus à mes
  yeux ce qu'elle était. Le respect que je lui ai religieusement rendu, s'est
  affaibli quand je l'ai vue soumise aux artifices des méchants." At such
  seasons his appetite for incense was in some imperfect degree stayed by the
  adulation of his domestic circle, where an accomplished and ambitious wife
  "lui vouait une sorte de culte."* But the malicious plots of the court and
  aristocracy to drive him from power did more than anything else to endear him
  to the lower orders. They yearned to recompense him for the chagrin which
  they supposed him to suffer.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Droz, vol. i. p. 79.</p>

  <p>The language of the popular journals became quite ecstatic; for instance:
  "Le coeur se serre en pensant à ce qu'il a souffert, à ce qu'il aurait pu
  souffrir. On cherche dans ses yeux à deviner les mouvements de son âme. C'est
  un père qui revient au milieu de sa famille, qui le chérit; quoiqu'il n'ait
  plus rien à craindre, on s'inquiéte encore, on l'interroge pour savoir s'il
  n'a pas quelque blessure cachée qu'il ne veut pas découvrir de peur
  d'affliger ses enfants."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Journal of Gorsas, quoted by M. Louis Blanc, ii.
  467.</p>

  <p>The truth is that Necker's egregious vanity did him no harm with the
  public. When he talked with dignity about "un homme de mon caractère," when
  he laboured to impress on his chief "quelques unes des grandes idées morales
  dont mon coeur était animé," when he drew a portrait of the statesman whom
  France needed, "a man in whom intelligence is combined with firmness,
  prudence, and virtue," not affecting to conceal that she possessed at least
  one such treasure, the people took him at his own valuation. They greedily
  devoured his incessant appeals to public opinion, the style of which, though
  diffuse and hardly rising to eloquence, was lucid and attractive. He
  occasionally fell into language which some have admired as the genuine
  outburst of a philanthropic heart, and others have denounced as sentimental
  claptrap. One rather famous passage may be quoted as a sample:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">"Almost all civil institutions have been made for the
  possessors of property, One is frightened, on opening the statute-book, at
  being met everywhere by this fact. One would think that a small number of men
  had divided the land between themselves, and then proceeded to make laws to
  unite and guarantee each other against the multitude, as they would make a
  fence in the woods to defend themselves against wild beasts. And yet it must
  be said that when laws of property, justice, and liberty have been
  established, next to nothing has been done for the most numerous class of
  citizens. What do your laws of property matter to us? they may say. We have
  no property. Your laws of justice? We have nothing to defend. Your laws of
  liberty? If we do not work, to-morrow we shall die."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Sur la législation et le commerce des grains.
  Conclusion.</p>

  <p>It is all very well to sneer at outbursts of this sort, or to denounce
  them savagely as unworthy of a statesman, but they tell on the masses. While
  fastidious or cynical politicians receive a warmly expressed sentiment with
  shouts of derision, and think reiterated allusions to it an effective way of
  baiting an opponent, it is being treasured in the hearts of the people. Even
  now there are those who are fascinated by Necker's gushing language. In the
  eyes of M. Louis Blanc he is a thinker who had calmly judged political
  economy and found it wanting, and is therefore to be set above Turgot. But
  Necker was not precisely the man to be in advance of his age. He was far
  enough from any shade of socialism, and even from a sincere relish for
  equality, as his later writings abundantly show. The simple truth is that his
  intellect was rather cabby. Clear-sighted in details, hazy in his conception
  of general principles, he was eager to strike at this or that abuse, but he
  shrank with nervous dread from anything like systematic coherent thought in
  politics. He would assuredly have refused the deductions which seem to M.
  Louis Blanc to follow so obviously from such a passage as that I have quoted.
  "Chez Necker," says the judicious and impartial M. Henri Martin, "il faut
  bien le dire, la protestation en faveur des prolétaires reste à l'état de
  sentiment." In a word, it was soft stuff. When we read it we must remember
  that the great financier had already written plays, and was destined to
  compose not only a "Cours de Morale Religieuse," but a novel with the
  romantic title, "Suites funestes d'une seule faute."</p>

  <p>Necker had resigned in 1781 somewhat hastily, because he found himself
  thwarted by his colleagues. Fully persuaded that he was indispensable, he
  made no doubt that in a few weeks he would come in again on his own terms.
  His retirement, however, lasted longer than he expected, and in the meantime
  things moved so fast that, when he did return, it was to face difficulties
  unprovided for by his counting-house philosophy. France, during the eclipse
  of her Necker, had been under the treatment of Calonne, and steps had been
  taken which, good or bad, were irrevocable.</p>

  <p>"On the morality of Calonne," says M. Martin, "there is but one opinion;
  on his capacity there are two." This is a judgment which would have mortified
  Calonne if he had lived to read it. In the first part of it he would have
  acquiesced with little concern; but in the second he would have recognised
  that he was punished <i>par où il avait péché</i>; for lack of ability was
  certainly not the cause of the evil celebrity he has obtained in history.
  There are statesmen who are too clever by half. In the absence of all
  sincerity and all genuine conviction their counsel is inevitably turned into
  foolishness; therefore posterity, undazzled by the momentary glitter, judging
  and rightly judging them by the ensemble of their policy,&mdash;if a series
  of manoeuvres may be dignified by that name,&mdash;doubts whether they had
  any capacity at all,&mdash;whether they were not mere mountebanks.</p>

  <p>Calonne was a man absolutely free from all prejudice or predilection in
  politics. It was perfectly immaterial to him whether he governed wisely or
  foolishly, on old principles or according to new lights, by the favour of the
  king or by the support of the people. His ambition was not of a lofty kind.
  It amounted merely to a determination to get to the top of the tree, to be
  looked up to by good society, to have the power of dispensing
  favoupersonagestinctions among personages of a more exalted rank than
  himself, and he had no objection to govern well if it conduced to that
  result. To Necker such a position would have given no satisfaction, unless he
  could feel that he was earning the approbation of good men. Calonne cared
  little fir the approbation of any one so long as he could sit in high places.
  With him, the end being base, all means were equally eligible, either
  simultaneously or successively. When he entered on office, he laid down for
  himself the rule, that the first requisite for success was to inspire
  confidence. Necker had been able to raise loan after loan, simply because
  capitalists believed in him. His resignation had been looked on as a public
  calamity, because it was feared that the capitalists would lend to no one
  else. Unless Calonne could conquer their confidence, it was impossible that
  he could remain in office.</p>

  <p>Many an insolvent banker has kept afloat for years, and perhaps ultimately
  saved himself, by showing no signs of distress, when the least appearance of
  economy or retrenchment would have destroyed his credit. Calonne did but
  pursue this familiar method, not altogether despairing of ultimate success,
  but determined, at all events, to hold on as long as he could. No finance
  minister could play this game of brag at the present day, because public
  resources and public incumbrances cannot be materially disguised. But French
  finances under the <i>ancien régime</i> were as absolutely a secret as the
  accounts of a private firm. The publication of Necker's <i>Compte Rendu</i>
  had for the first time thrown some light upon them; but they were still a
  mystery, and the more so that in that celebrated state-paper Necker had
  considerably cooked them.</p>

  <p>The plan of Calonne was therefore not so wild as it seems; the best proof
  of which is that he did restore confidence, and did manage to bleed the
  capitalists to the tune of nineteen millions sterling in three years. But
  further, he saw that all Necker's popularity with the country had not enabled
  him to bear up against the dislike of the court; and he was determined not to
  lose the game for want of support in that quarter. To us it seems a proof of
  infatuation, that within three years of the Revolution a minister should
  still have been counting on court favour as an element of solid strength. It
  is easy to see Calonne's mistake now. But in France, up to that time, court
  favour had been the surest foundation on which power could be built. The
  minister was literally the servant of the king. His promotion was notified to
  him verbally by a simple valet de chambre. "Monsieur So-and-so, the King has
  made you minister." Calonne is not to be set down as a fool because he
  thought such a system might last a few years longer than it did. That
  sweeping reforms must soon come he saw clearly, more clearly than Necker, who
  desired them indeed ardently, but always slavishly overrated the strength of
  the old régime. The confidence of the people and the sovereign once gained,
  Calonne intended to appropriate some of the plans of the reformers, and, in
  his unbounded self-reliance, he flattered himself that his cleverness and
  tact would carry measures which had failed in more awkward hands. He is not
  the only statesman who has been out in his reckoning, from simple incapacity
  to comprehend the value of a decent reputation&mdash;even to an impostor.</p>

  <p>For some time all went well. A knot of serious and earnest men, the
  partisans of Necker, might protest as they pleased against a worship of
  successful effrontery, and fret over the lengthened exclusion of their chief
  from office; but the popularity of the minister was considerable. Money
  poured in from the innocent capitalists, and was lavished on jobs in the
  interest of every one who seemed to be in a position to render support of any
  kind in return.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* "I told our friends at Warrington that there appeared
  to me to have grown up under the present Government a system of what I
  called, in regard to the public expenditure, making things pleasant all
  round. That means going from town to town, granting what this community
  wants, granting what that community wants, granting what the other community
  wants, and leaving out of sight that large public which unfortunately has not
  got the voices and the advocates ready always to defend it against these
  local and particular claims. I told you a story of a case where a candidate
  in the Government interest at this moment goes to a constituency, and
  complains that he could not get a Liberal Government to surrender for £2,500
  a debt due to the Government of £20,000, but that when a Conservative
  Government came in he found there was no difficulty at all in arranging the
  matter. Therefore he says, 'Return me to Parliament, and not a member of the
  Liberal party.'" (<i>Speech of Mr. Gladstone, Times, Oct. 26, 1868.</i>) "It
  is far more easy to work the Parliamentary machine by a lavish expenditure of
  money, than it is to procure, or promote, or insist upon any due system of
  economy. They make things easy by what is called greasing the wheels. I
  recollect only last session speaking to a very eminent member of the
  Conservative side of the House about the policy of the Government, and he
  said that their policy was to make the thing work by giving a little money
  all round."&mdash;(<i>Speech of Mr. Bright, Times, Nov. 11, 1868.</i>)</p>

  <p>It is astonishing how easily people come to look upon the interests of the
  community as identical with their own. We are generally given to understand
  that Calonne's ministry was an undisguised scramble among the courtiers for
  the last plunder of the wreck. But it certainly did not appear in that light
  either to courtiers or people. "I was always certain that man would save
  France," said a great nobleman, with genuine enthusiasm, "but I never thought
  he would do it so soon." The capitalists, as we have seen, were satisfied; If
  there was one province of France where the minister was likely to be
  ill-received it was Brittany: Did he give the Bretons a wide berth? Not a bit
  of it. He made a point of paying them a visit, harangued them with his usual
  bounce, smartness, and well-simulated candour, and left them shouting "Vive
  Calonne!" "A feat," says M. Martin, "truly incredible." All the world saw
  that he was borrowing. But what had Necker done but borrow? Necker's loans
  had amounted to upwards of seventeen millions sterling in five years. Necker
  had been valued just because he could raise loans; and now it appeared that
  Calonne could raise them, if anything, faster.</p>

  <p>For three years was this game carried on. M. Louis Blanc believes that
  Calonne was deliberately making things worse, in order that the privileged
  classes might be driven into a corner and compelled to submit to reform; and
  the fact that, after all, he exaggerated the deficit in his statement to the
  Notables does seem to show that he relied on this means of silencing
  opposition. Whether he was driven to unfold the second part of his scheme
  earlier and more abruptly than he had designed, it is impos Bible to
  determine. The necessity came; the capitalists took fright; no more money was
  to be had; and there was nothing for it but to play his trump card at
  once.</p>

  <p>The first thing to be done was to break the disagreeable news to the king.
  Louis had commenced his reign with a new-fangled eagerness to be a pattern
  sovereign. But the good seed lay on stony ground. His fat soul soon wearied
  of well-doing and settled down to field sports. To this animal Calonne now
  cane with his awkward story. The impending catastrophe, he said, was not of
  his creating; Necker had bequeathed it to him; the famous <i>Compte Rendu</i>
  had been cooked: the deficit had been steadily growing since the days of
  Louis XIV.; there was but one remedy&mdash;retrenchment. He then proceeded to
  sketch out a series of reforms of the most sweeping kind, some of them long
  demanded by enlightened men, others crude, and even whimsical, such as the
  payment of taxes in kind. The king gasped for breath. "Why," said he, "this
  is simply Necker over again." But he had not the manliness to send the
  impudent gambler about his business, and call to his counsels the only man
  who by special aptitude and deliberate conviction was entitled to preside
  over such a policy. Calonne persuaded him that there was no reason why that
  solemn disagreeable Necker should have a monopoly of reform and its credit,
  and obtained a pledge of the royal support.</p>

  <p>The instrument by which the new reforms were to be carried out was worthy
  of the projector. Calonne was one of those statesman who are cursed with
  ingenuity, that most fatal of all gifts in politics, where breadth and
  simplicity can alone avail. The device of an Assembly of Notables seemed to
  him peculiarly happy. It was old. It was new. It was startling, It was safe.
  He could leer with one eye at the ardent champions of reform, while with the
  other he winked at the alarmed defenders of privilege. He would pack this
  Assembly by drawing half of it from that stratum of French society which,
  selfish as it was, had no speculative or sentimental
  prejudices,&mdash;atheist prelates scheming for promotion, and men of
  fashion, who petted Franklin, dined with D'Holbach, and laughed at the
  impudent hits of Beaumarchais. On their votes surely a reforming minister
  might reckon. The other half he would "educate" by assuring them that he was
  but developing the profoundest principles of the monarchy.</p>

  <p>The Notables met, and Calonne hardily addressed himself to his task with
  the air of a man certain of success. His first stroke was as maladroit as it
  was coarse. The opening sentence of his harangue informed the Notables that
  his plans were honoured by the personal approbation of Majesty. Unfortunately
  the sovereign was not venerated as a conclusive authority in politics, and
  even a packed Assembly thinks itself good for something else than registering
  a foregone conclusion. The financial statement was introduced by the minister
  with matchless audacity. He had studied economy; yes, economy; not, it was
  true, the niggardly petty cheese-paring, which some ministers had dignified
  by that name, but a large and liberal economy which consisted&mdash;in short
  which consisted in swelling the expenditure. But the dismay which the
  confession of the deficit excited gave place to a stronger feeling when the
  speaker went on with flippant pomposity to unfold his programme of reform. If
  he had any admirers left in the Assembly, gaping devotees who had believed to
  the last that their great medicine-man had some miraculous shift by which he
  would keep the game alive, here he parted company with them. It was in vain
  that he replied to attacks with infinite cleverness and assurance, and had a
  retort ready for every assailant.</p>

  <p>The Assembly which he had himself devised and summoned into existence,
  turned upon him, and gave him plainly to understand that, whether his plans
  were good or bad, whether he was prepared to govern as a Reformer or a
  Conservative, go he must. Consistent, thoroughgoing partisans of privilege,
  such as Richelieu and Ségur, denounced him as a traitor for having convoked
  the Assembly at all; reformers would hear of no minister but the virtuous
  lecker; the sovereign, of whose personal support he had bragged, threw him
  over; and Calonne reluctantly bade farewell to office, leaving as the one
  substantial result of his administration that old landmarks and barriers had
  been recklessly beaten down by the accredited representative of privilege.
  The impossibility of letting things remain as they were, either, iofficiallyr
  State, had been ofpicially proclaimed. In the struggle for place and
  popularity, all prominent men had recognised reform as a necessity; and
  however they might repent it, thenceforth there was for them no drawing back.
  For the people had heard words spoken which it would never again forget.</p>

  <p>The fall of Calonne did not immediately realise the hopes of Necker. The
  court and the privileged classes were not yet prepared to see France ruled by
  an ex-banker, who did not even prefix the <i>de</i> to his name. Sixteen
  months of Brienne succeeded. Then there was an attempt to induce the great
  financier to coalesce with Brienne; in other words, to sell his talents and,
  what was worth more, his popularity to a clique of official hacks who loathed
  radical reform and would have thwarted him at every step. But it must be said
  for Necker that he had too much spirit for that. Though dying for office, he
  was ready to wait a little longer rather than compromise his independence.
  His native vanity here rose into a proper pride. Laugh at him as we may, the
  man reallyid wish to do good, wished it ardently, and he was determined that
  when next he took office he would not be harnessed with a jibbing team. It
  was destined that he should not fail for want of his chance. The court
  surrendered at discretion, and Necker came into power triumphant, unfettered,
  the idol of the populace, with every qualification for governing except a
  strong character and some knowledge of his own intentions.</p>

  <p>The great question of the day, the first which the new minister was called
  on to determine, was the constitution of the States-General which had been
  promised by the king, and were to meet the next year. Were the
  representatives of the Third Estate to be equal in number to each of the
  other two, or to both of them united'? Were the three orders to sit in
  separate chambers or in one&mdash;to vote by order or by head? For
  simplifying finances, for a discriminating reduction or imposition of taxes,
  for a severe economy, for legislation tending to promote material prosperity,
  Necker was the very man. There he was on his own ground, and could tread
  firmly. But he was now confronted with political difficulties of another
  order, and his defects of mind and character became at once apparent. For his
  own part, he desired&mdash;so far as he knew what he desired&mdash;an
  Assembly which would support Necker. Sometimes he feared that the
  States-General would be too tame, too easily moulded by the privileged
  classes.</p>

  <p>At other times he was filled with nervous apprehension that it would hurry
  him into reforms of a nature and scope which he had never contemplated, and
  to the direction of which he felt himself as incompetent as he was
  disinclined. Being entirely without system in politics, he had no other guide
  for his action than public opinion. An English statesman now-a-days, who is
  similarly unprovided, can get along after a fashion without his nakedness
  being discovered, because a free press, free public meetings, and
  representative institutions afford a constant test of public opinion in all
  its variations. But in France, before the Revolution, public opinion had not
  organised itself; accurate gauges of it did not exist; and if they had
  existed, people were not yet trained to read them. The convocation of the
  States-General was a leap in the dark indeed. Poor lecker, peering around him
  for the straw to show how the wind blew, could think of no better way of
  feeling the public mind than calling together once more the selfish,
  impotent, and ridiculous Assembly devised by Calonne.</p>

  <p>The Notables, as might have been foreseen, voted against the doubling of
  the Third Estate, against vote by head, against redistribution of
  constituencies. A cry of indignation went up from France. Addresses from
  municipalities and other corporate bodies poured in. Necker had got his cue.
  It was with the King in Council that the real decision rested under the old
  régime. In the council, therefore, Necker set himself to calm the forebodings
  of privilege.* "Do not," he said, "be so jealous of this Third Estate; do not
  apprehend such terrible things from it. Look at its enthusiastic loyalty
  towards the present occupant of the throne; it will never think of attacking
  property or privilege&mdash;privilege being a property just as sacred as any
  other. I do not advocate the double representation because I want it to
  overbear the other orders by weight of numbers, which I should think very
  undesirable, but because such a concession to justice will satisfy public
  opinion. Once these inequalities adjusted, you will find that all three
  orders have much the same views about legislation. How should it be otherwise
  when good government is the manifest interest of all classes alike? Remember
  what weight the privileged classes will continue to have by their wealth and
  social prestige; besides there are so many subjects on which the deputies of
  the Third Estate can give us valuable information and advice; but if nothing
  else weighs with you" (and here Necker's loose sentiment bordered on true
  insight) "listen to the inarticulate voice of Europe everywhere joining in on
  the side of justice."</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Rapport fait au Roi dans sun Conseil,&mdash;<i>Oeuvres
  de Necker</i>, vi. 432.</p>

  <p>To publish a Report read at the Council of Ministers was an unheard-of
  proceeding. But with his usual restless itching for compliment, Necker rushed
  into print, and was thus at the pains to put on record for ever predictions
  destined to be so signally falsified by the event. For the moment, however,
  he tasted triumph. MM. de Nivernois, de Fourgueux, de Luzerne, de Saint
  Priest, de Villedeuil, de Montmorin&mdash;of such world-famous personages, in
  addition to Necker and good harmless old Malesherbes, was the Council of the
  King of France composed the year before the Revolution&mdash;were convinced
  or silenced, and the royal decree went forth, conceding the double
  representation of the Third Estate and redistribution of constituencies. As
  for the remaining and still more important question of voting by order or by
  head, Necker characteristically let it alone. He knew, every one knew, that
  it would arise the first day the States met, that it would not settle itself,
  that the King would have to pronounce on it, that it would be wiser to
  pronounce at once than to wait till the orders had quarrelled about it before
  the eyes of France. Necker never moved in earnest till he had the maximum of
  force at his back. Moreover, he thought that the Third Estate had perhaps
  been sufficiently strengthened, for his purpose; if not, he had a weapon in
  reserve. In the meantime he tacitly allowed it to be inferred that he
  sympathised with the most liberal view, and he revelled in the sweets of a
  popularity to which there was no parallel in French history.</p>
