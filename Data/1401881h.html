  <p class="cp"><i>The sea crept with green. It crawled up the shores and
  smothered the hills!</i></p>

  <br>

  <h2>I.</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was the year 2000. America was at war, fighting for her
  very life against the Asiatic Union. And yet the American people&mdash;even
  army officers&mdash;found time for recreation. Recreation was a necessity, to
  take one's mind off the titanic struggle.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Richard Lister, clad in swimming trunks, sat on a beach rug,
  staring moodily out across the Pacific Ocean toward the Seal Rocks and
  beyond, his hands clasped across his tanned knees, his bronzed face
  tense.</p>

  <p>"Let's not talk about the war; let's talk about us!" he exclaimed to Sally
  Amber, who sat beside him.</p>

  <p>The girl turned her strange, dark eyes inquisitively upon him.</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't feel that way, Dick," she said seriously. "Particularly as
  you're in such an important branch of the service. I'm not kidding; I mean
  it. Where would the country be without your Bureau of Military Biology and
  Bacteriology? We'd all be wiped out by the Asiatic Union's germs!"</p>

  <p>"Sure. And if it weren't for their bacteriologists, they'd be wiped out by
  our germs. It's a deadlock, I tell you, like this whole war. Look at Alaska:
  For more than a year now the Khan has been holding that little corner from
  Rocky Point to Cape Espenberg, and we haven't been able to budge his line a
  single inch, nor has he been able to budge ours. Each army is protected by
  one of those impenetrable Beckerley electrical fields.</p>

  <p>"Alaska is the key to the whole situation, with the Khan there in person.
  If we could just get through his Beckerley field, and put an end to him, the
  whole Asiatic Union would crumble. It's only his personality that can hold
  together such naturally hostile groups as the Siberian Russians, the Japs,
  the Chinese, the Tartars, and so forth. Without him, they'd be at each
  other's throats in a few hours!"</p>

  <p>"Well, why doesn't somebody do something about it?" asked Sally,
  impishly.</p>

  <p>"Lord knows we've tried!" Lister exclaimed. "Ten or a dozen brave
  Americans have gotten through the enemy lines, and tried to assassinate him,
  only to be captured, and subjected to horrible torture and death."</p>

  <p>The girl shuddered, and pulled one corner of the beach rug up around her
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose I'd rate as a 'brave American,' " she said.</p>

  <p>"I'd take a chance on your bravery," Lister declared.</p>

  <p>"Why doesn't America land troops in Asia?" Sally asked.</p>

  <p>Lister stared at her sharply.</p>

  <p>"You know as well as I do," he said. "Although America controls the seas
  ever since we annihilated the Khan's fleet off the Marianas six months ago,
  yet he has ten million men under arms in Asia. What good would it do us to
  land our five million against such odds? No, we've got to lick the mad Khan
  in Alaska&mdash;somehow."</p>

  <p>"He isn't mad!" snapped Sally, unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I've&mdash;I've&mdash;well, I've seen him."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you'd ever been in Asia."</p>

  <p>"There are lots of things about me that you don't know," she retorted. "My
  father is dead, and I am quite wealthy. I've traveled a lot. Three years ago
  I was in the eastern capital&mdash;Harbin; and, what's more, I've been in
  Moscow, the western capital, too."</p>

  <p>"So you've seen the mad Khan," mused Lister. "Did you ever see the woman
  they call Princess Stephanie? What's she like? She's supposed to be very
  beautiful."</p>

  <p>Sally shrugged. "Oh, she's all right, if you like that type," she replied
  airily. "She's dark and has Khazar blood in her, and she's about my
  age&mdash;and anyway, why are you questioning me? Go on with your little
  lecture."</p>

  <p>"About us?" he asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>"No." She reached out one slim hand, and gently patted his knee. "About
  the Beckerley electrical fields. What are they? How do they operate?"</p>

  <p>He frowned thoughtfully, trying to phrase his answer in words that a girl
  would understand.</p>

  <p>"It's an application of Morelle's experiment with electrical eddy
  currents," he said. I'm a botanist, not an electrical engineer, but I know
  that the idea involves the refraction of lines of magnetic force.</p>

  <p>"It works like this: Over each army on the Alaskan front the scientists
  have created a dome of electrical tension&mdash;a magnetic field. Any shell
  or drop bomb passing through this magnetic field is instantly heated to white
  heat by the electrical eddy currents induced in it by the field, and is thus
  caused to explode in mid-air.</p>

  <p>"Every city is likewise protected by a Beckerley field. You know how each
  autocopter, on leaving the city limits of San Francisco, has to stop and be
  pushed through an iron-shielded subway until it's beyond the Beckerley field?
  Well, that's because the gasoline in the tank would be heated to the flash
  point by the walls of its container."</p>

  <p>"How about solid shot?" asked Sally.</p>

  <p>"That can pass through a field, of course, but what chance has solid shot
  of doing much damage? Our own copters could down any possible fleet of enemy
  planes long before they could drop enough solid missiles to do appreciable
  harm to a city; and as for the Alaskan front, the most that either side could
  do would be to chip a few rocks in the Yukon Hills.</p>

  <p>"No, the situation's a deadlock; the Khan is swept from the sea, but his
  enormous army prevents our invading Asia, and neither side can advance an
  inch in Alaska because of the Beckerley fields. It can't even become a war of
  attrition, because both the Asiatic Union and the United States are entirely
  self-supporting, and can never be starved into submission."</p>

  <p>"Do you think so?" asked Sally Amber in an odd voice. Suddenly she
  shrugged her smooth, brown shoulders as if to change the subject. "Will
  Admiral Allen be here Saturday?" she asked casually.</p>

  <p>"Why, no, I don't think&mdash;" Lister caught himself abruptly. Allen had
  told him, in the very strictest of confidence, of a proposed attempt to cut
  the Asiatic supply line to Alaska by a concentrated attack on Behring Strait,
  The Pacific fleet, idle since the engagement near the Marianas, was to sail
  secretly before dawn on Saturday.</p>

  <p>He glared. "Why do you ask such a question?" he snapped. "If I knew, I
  shouldn't tell, and you know it."</p>

  <p>Sally laughed. "Silly!" she chided. "It was just that I was considering
  having him and you and that flying detective, Jim Cass, to a little dinner at
  my apartment Saturday. You see, I still haven't met Jim Cass, and you've
  spoken of him so often that I'm curious. After all, if he's a friend of
  yours, Dick&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She smiled very tenderly at him.</p>

  <p>Lister shook his head. "Captain Cass is no friend of mine," he declared.
  "He's just an officer of the military intelligence who breezes into my
  laboratory from time to time, and pokes around looking for clues and trouble.
  He gives me the creeps. I never knew such a cold-blooded man! He'd turn his
  own mother over to a firing squad, if he thought it would help win the
  war."</p>

  <p>"Well, wouldn't you or I do as much for our country?" asked Sally. "And,
  besides, his very coldness intrigues me. I want to meet him."</p>

  <p>"Suit yourself," said Lister. "Have we time for another swim?"</p>

  <p>She puckered her lips disapprovingly. "Oh, no!' she exclaimed decidedly.
  "The water's so full of that horrible green slime that it's no pleasure to
  swim. Let's start back to town."</p>

  <p>"It is bad," he agreed. "It's just a variety of confervae&mdash;what we
  commonly call algae. There have been some complaints of it in the drinking
  water, too. It's harmless, but they ought to chlorinate the city reservoir."
  He rose and stretched. "Let's dress and get started, then."</p>

  <p>It was not quite 2:00 p. m. when they landed Sally's convertible
  helicopter in front of the building near the Presidio that served as the
  office and laboratory of the local unit of the Bureau of Military Biology and
  Bacteriology. Lister stepped reluctantly out of the machine, and turned to
  Sally at the wheel.</p>

  <p>"Tonight?" he asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "Sorry. I have to dine with some family friends."</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow night, then?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you will," he stated positively. "Heaven knows if I'll be stationed
  here long, and I don't want to waste a moment."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked sharply. "Do you expect to be transferred?"</p>

  <p>He bit his tongue. "No, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Needed distraction came. He whirled and saluted a dark, sinister-looking
  army officer descending the steps of the building.</p>

  <p>"Sally, here's Captain Cass at last. I thought he'd be in today! Sir, this
  is the Sally Amber you've heard me talking about so much."</p>

  <p>Jim Cass took the hand Sally extended. "No wonder Dick's been raving," he
  said, staring at her appraisingly with his cold, blue eyes. "I apologize for
  thinking he was nuts. I didn't believe he had the good taste&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His stare changed to a puzzled frown. "Say, haven't we met before?"</p>

  <p>"If we had," said Sally, "I wouldn't have forgotten it."</p>

  <p>But Captain Cass stood staring, long after her copter was
  indistinguishable among the cross currents of traffic.</p>

  <p><br>
  CASS was no closer to the solution when he dropped in on Lister the following
  day. The biologist, in laboratory smock, was busy with the war-time routine
  of checking water samples from half a dozen coastal cities, and had but
  little time to listen to his superior.</p>

  <p>"Oakland," he muttered, "bacterial count seven per c. c.; that's normal.
  Monterey, eleven; that's safe. Vera Cruz&mdash;say, did you ever see so much
  algae in the drinking water? Look at that beaker on the window sill. That's
  after two hours' exposure to sunlight, and it's as green as pea soup already.
  What's more, I saw reports from Chicago that it's just the same there. And
  &mdash;this is queer&mdash;from London as well."</p>

  <p>"What's that fuzz on the trees?" asked Cass thoughtfully, looking idly out
  of the window. "I never saw that here before."</p>

  <p>"Yeah. I noticed that. It's just a tree lichen, something like Spanish
  moss. A cryptogamous plant&mdash;that is, a spore-breeder. It's related
  to&mdash;&mdash;By the Lord! It's confervae, too, just like the alga!"</p>

  <p>"Well? So what?"</p>

  <p>"So nothing, except that whatever has stimulated the algae in the sea and
  in the drinking water, has also stimulated the lichens and the fungi. The
  cryptogamoids are the sort of plants that grew on earth during the
  carboniferous age, the age of coal."</p>

  <p>"Maybe we're in for another age of coal, huh?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly." said Lister, laughing. "There are several theories as to what
  caused the carboniferous age, such as a higher concentration of carbon
  dioxide in the air, or a world-wide tropical climate, or intense sun-spot
  activity, which would induce frequent and violent electrical storms on the
  earth, and hence produce an abnormal amount of ozone in the air. Ozone is a
  particularly dense form of oxygen, and is able to filter out the death
  rays&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Death rays?" exclaimed Cass, pricking up his ears. He had been paying
  very little attention to Lister, but here was something in his own
  line&mdash;something the military intelligence ought to know about. "Death
  rays?"</p>

  <p>Lister laughed again. "Not the kind of death rays the army is interested
  in," he said. "But there are certain invisible rays of sunlight which have a
  fatal effect on living creatures. Ozone filters them out.</p>

  <p>"It's one of the remarkable instances of the balance of nature that there
  is normally just enough ozone in the outer layers of the atmosphere to keep
  out the quantity of that invisible light which would be fatal to human life,
  and yet let in just enough to keep the algae within reasonable bounds. Now
  if&mdash;Say! I wonder!"</p>

  <p>"You wonder what?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing! Nothing at all!"</p>

  <p>"Lister," said Cass pointedly, "you seem to be able to be very close-
  mouthed about some things, and to some people. I wonder how you are with
  women."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Lister, with a guilty premonition.</p>

  <p>"Well, for example, you didn't happen to say anything to Miss Amber about
  the sailing of the fleet, did you?"</p>

  <p>Lister flushed. He hadn't, of course; and yet she might have gathered it
  from some of his remarks. But then, what if she had?</p>

  <p>"Of course not," he growled. "Speaking of the fleet," he added, "I'm going
  over to see Admiral Allen right now."</p>

  <p><br>
  ARRIVED at the admiral's quarters, Lister came directly to the point. "Sir,"
  he said, "I've been thinking about all these algae. At the rate they are
  increasing, you may find your whole fleet stalled in a mass of jelly before
  you get to Behring Strait."</p>

  <p>"I've thought of that," Admiral Allen replied soberly, and yet with a
  twinkle in his eyes which Lister couldn't quite fathom.</p>

  <p>"But have you heard the latest reports, sir?" Lister persisted. "The
  Chicago River is clogged. The stuff is beginning to plug the water mains
  everywhere. I know it's becoming a nuisance here in San Francisco. In Texas,
  the Spanish moss is beginning to collect in masses heavy enough to break tree
  branches.</p>

  <p>"All over the country railroad ties are turning into pulpy beds of
  assorted fungi, puffballs, and a hundred other varieties. The resulting decay
  has even caused derailings. In the moister areas, trains actually have to
  plow their way through vast accumulations of lichens, which have found the
  shaded cuts and half-decayed ties an ideal environment in which to exercise
  their new vitality."</p>

  <p>"It's even worse in Asia," the admiral replied. "They say that on the
  tundras the lichens are growing into heaps like haystacks on the railroads,
  and that the algae have blocked rivers and caused floods. That's why, even at
  the risk of getting our entire fleet stuck in the slime, we must attack the
  Khan while this unexplainable growth of plants is endangering his source of
  supplies."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that," said Lister.</p>

  <p>"Well, keep it under your hat, and don't breathe it to a soul. It is
  secret information that has just come in from the intelligence service. Have
  you any idea as to the reason for all this? I was just going to send for you,
  when you showed up."</p>

  <p>"Something may have caused an abnormal increase in the ozone of the outer
  layers of the atmosphere, and this ozone may be filtering out those wave
  lengths of sunlight which ordinarily hold algae in check."</p>

  <p>But Admiral Allen was one of those practical men who have little patience
  with scientific explanations of anything. So he suggested, "Might it not be
  some new device of Asiatic warfare?"</p>

  <p>"I hardly think so, sir. The Khan wouldn't use this weapon which appears
  to be hurting him even worse than it is us."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>II.</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT evening, when Dick Lister and Sally Amber were seated
  in a restaurant, she again broached the subject of the algae.</p>

  <p>"I hear it's even worse in Asia than in America," she said.</p>

  <p>"How do you happen to know that?" he asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"It's so, then? Oh, everybody isn't so close-mouthed as you, Dick," she
  replied demurely. She raised her lovely dark, innocent eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose it might be an Asiatic weapon? Or perhaps&mdash;since it
  seems to be even worse in Siberia than here&mdash;an American weapon?"</p>

  <p>Embarrassed, he mumbled, "How should I know?"</p>

  <p>"But you do know something about it, don't you?" she shot at him.</p>

  <p>Caught off guard, he stumbled. "Eh ? Oh&mdash;why, yes. The Beckerley
  fields &mdash;" He broke off, frowning in irritation.</p>

  <p>"Sally," he growled, "that curiosity of yours is going to get you into
  trouble one of these days. This is wartime, and feminine curiosity is no
  excuse for pumping officers. I know that you are O. K., but others might not
  trust you. How'd you like to stand court-martial as an Asiatic spy, just
  because you ask too many questions?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am one," said the girl, smiling and raising her delicately
  penciled brows.</p>

  <p>"It's no joking matter, Sally. People have been shot against a wall for
  less than that."</p>

  <p>"I can see," said the girl dryly, "that Captain Cass has been lecturing
  you."</p>

  <p>"How&mdash;" began Lister, then bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"How do I know? Oh, I can read men like a book&mdash;any woman can.
  Captain Cass doesn't like me. And I don't like men who don't like me."</p>

  <p>She pouted prettily.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad he doesn't," declared Lister. "It would suit me if nobody liked
  you, but me."</p>

  <p><br>
  HE recalled this conversation the next evening, when Cass strolled nosily
  into his laboratory, where he was working late over some analyses.</p>

  <p>"Nice mess of algae," Cass observed, squinting at Lister's experimental
  tank. "They say the stuff is clogging the Atlantic harbors."</p>

  <p>"You could damn near walk across the Golden Gate this morning," Lister
  replied, and went on to detail the latest news: train schedules disrupted in
  the northwest, ships stuck in harbors everywhere, even in the open seas,
  particularly the north Pacific.</p>

  <p>But Captain Cass was not listening. He was leaning over Lister's glass-
  topped desk, peering intently at something beneath the glass&mdash;a
  snapshot.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"Just a snap of Sally. Not a very good one; print's blurred."</p>

  <p>"Um!" said Cass. His eyes narrowed. Then he said, irrelevantly, "Have you
  any theory about what's causing all this growth of algae?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Lister admitted, pursing up his lips judiciously. "But I'm not
  going off half-cocked. When I've verified certain points, I shall report to
  Washington&mdash;not to the intelligence service."</p>

  <p>"Well, seeing as you won't tell the intelligence service anything, the
  intelligence service will tell you something&mdash;and for your own good.
  Listen carefully, and don't fly off the handle: I was attached to the Harbin
  legation three years ago, before the war. I got to know a lot about the
  Khan's eastern capital. Maybe you never heard of the woman called Princess
  Stephanie&mdash;or did you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What about her?"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. Stephanie was the daughter of Dmitri Kazarov, the Khan's
  chancellor. He was killed fifteen years ago in the Japanese revolution, and
  the Khan himself took over the raising of Stephanie. It wasn't given much
  publicity, but, in a town like Harbin, people talk, and they were still
  talking when I was there. It seemed the Khan gave her a queer
  education&mdash;a very queer one."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean he raised her to be the greatest spy in history. She was taught
  every important language, and to speak each like a native. She was taught to
  be at ease in every situation and every level of society. She learned
  military science, so as to be able to identify important information. And,
  when it began to be evident that she was going to be a very beautiful girl,
  she was even taught the knowledge of human nature! But above all&mdash;above
  all, I say&mdash;she learned to be cold and heartless, and immune to love.
  She can act the part of a woman in love, but there is no feeling in
  her&mdash;no feeling except the desire to serve Asia!"</p>

  <p>"But I don't see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will. When Stephanie was sixteen&mdash;that was three years ago, when
  I was in Harbin&mdash;the Khan forbade her to appear in public, lest foreign
  residents learn her features and impair her usefulness When she rode
  out-of-doors, no one was permitted within five hundred feet of her, and no
  one save her palace intimates really saw her face.</p>

  <p>"But"&mdash;Cass grinned aggravatingly&mdash;"I happen to have
  extraordinary eyesight, as a copter observer should, and I used to watch her
  from the prescribed distance. Once I even turned a pair of night glasses on
  her. She was a beauty, all right."</p>

  <p>"I begin to suspect, sir," said Lister grimly, "that you're about to say
  something you're going to be sorry for."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. Anyway, since the war began, there have been a lot of rumors
  about a brilliant feminine Asiatic spy&mdash;the Nightshade. It's my opinion
  that the Nightshade is the Princess Stephanie, and as for the rest, I know
  only this&mdash;that Sally Amber looks like Stephanie!"</p>

  <p>"You're utterly insane!" blazed Lister. His voice rose. "It's ridiculous!
  Sally's no Asiatic. Does she look like an Oriental? Her skin is as white as
  marble&mdash;when she isn't sun-tanned, I mean. Her speech is thoroughly
  American. Her eyes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped; suddenly he had visualized Sally Amber's eyes&mdash;dark,
  pure, lovely; but, beyond doubt, with the slightest possible oriental
  cast.</p>

  <p>"Exactly'" declared Cass, in reply to Lister's unspoken thought.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant, how long have you known this girl? Are you sure that her tan
  is tan, and not her natural color? And isn't she about the right age? And
  doesn't she spend a lot of time cultivating the friendship of people like
  you, who possess important military knowledge? Whether she gets anything out
  of you is a different story, but you ought to know whether she tries, whether
  she ever asks leading questions, or anything like that."</p>

  <p>"She doesn't!" snapped Lister, then groaned. He himself had chided the
  girl more than once on her curiosity. "Look here, captain," he said, "if
  Sally is an enemy spy&mdash;it's inconceivable&mdash;but if she is, I say,
  it's America first with me, much as I love her. Lay off of her, will you, and
  let me find out."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so hard-boiled and pitiless as you think."</p>

  <p>"How do you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How do I know what you think of me? Because it's my business, as an
  intelligence officer, to know what people think. But, as I was saying, I'll
  trust you. I'll give you your chance. I'm flying tonight on a certain
  mission, and shall not return for two days. Until then, the case is in your
  hands. But, if you have not solved it by then, I shall take it over."</p>

  <p><br>
  LISTER'S mental turmoil brooked no delay. Despite the fact that, if Sally
  were dining out, she must have already left, he rushed across town to her
  apartment. She&mdash;or some one, at least&mdash;was home, for the library
  lights were glowing. He ignored the slow automatic elevator, and dashed up
  the four flights of steps to her floor.</p>

  <p>He arrived in front of her door breathless and perspiring. There he
  paused, striving to calm himself.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he was aware of voices beyond the door. He listened, but it was
  impossible to distinguish words. He fancied he heard the tones of a man, but
  even that was not a certainty.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell. There was a sudden silence in the room beyond; and then,
  after a considerable interval, the sound of footsteps. Sally herself opened
  the door, her face seeming strained and tense. But she smiled as she
  recognized Lister.</p>

  <p>"Dick!" she exclaimed. "What's the matter? You're breathless!"</p>

  <p>He strode past her. The room was empty of occupants, save for Sally and
  himself. "To whom were you talking?" he asked grimly.</p>

  <p>"I was using the televisiphone. Why?"'</p>

  <p>"I thought I heard a man's voice in the room here."</p>

  <p>"Dick!" she said reprovingly. "I had no idea your jealousy would lead to
  such imaginings." She looked up at him with her dark eyes sober. "You know
  you have no cause to be jealous."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that," he replied miserably. Suddenly he burst out, "Sally, what
  were you doing in Harbin three years ago?"</p>

  <p>If there was a momentary flicker in her eyes, it was almost imperceptible.
  "Why, I was traveling. You know I love to travel."</p>

  <p>"You say you saw the woman Stephanie there," he pursued. "Did any one ever
  tell you that you looked like her?"</p>

  <p>Decidedly her eyes widened now. "Why&mdash;yes. Of course I've heard that.
  But, Dick, you don't think&mdash;" She laughed. "How absurd! You don't think
  that I'm the Nightshade, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Who said anything about the Nightshade?" he snapped. "How did you know
  that Stephanie and the Nightshade are the same person?"</p>

  <p>"Why, everybody hears those rumors, Dick."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you hear everybody's rumors," he returned grimly. "Why are
  you so interested in everything that has to do with the war or the
  service&mdash;everything from fleet sailings to algae? Sally, you're not
  telling me the truth."</p>

  <p>"How ridiculous!" she indignantly declared. Then, suddenly, her mood
  changing, she moved close to him, looking up at him out of innocent, dark
  eyes. "You trust me, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows I want to!"</p>

  <p>Her lovely, provocative lips smiled. "Then kiss me!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>He obeyed, fiercely. As always, her lips burned like soft fire, but,
  suddenly, she threw back her head, and thrust her hands against him, as
  though to push away from his embrace. One of her scarlet finger nails drew a
  sharp gash across his throat. With hurt surprise in his eyes, he released
  her.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;were hurting me," she explained, apologetically. But her eyes
  were watching him like a cat. "I'm sorry I scratched you."</p>

  <p>"It's nothing," he muttered. He felt curiously dizzy&mdash;no wonder, he
  thought, in the grip of such violent and opposing emotions. But abruptly he
  found himself sitting in a chair with his head on his hands, and the room
  seemed to gyrate around him like the cabin of a copter.</p>

  <p>Through a haze of dizziness he heard a man's voice, and then Sally's in
  answer. "No, no," she said. "This was much better. If I'd called you there
  would have been a fight and a disturbance, and see how peacefully he sinks
  into stupor"</p>

  <p>"I bow to you, Kazarovna," said the man. "There is but one Stephanie."</p>

  <p>"I am glad that it turned out as it did," said Sally's voice. "He is the
  one who knows about the algae. And now Asia shall know."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>III.</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN next Lister was aware of a world about him, it was a
  world of a most unstable nature. Minutes passed before he realized that he
  was in a plane, soaring over an apparently endless expanse of brilliant white
  clouds. There was a further interval before he perceived that Sally Amber was
  sitting, calmly smoking, beside the man who piloted the machine, and that he
  himself was handcuffed very effectively to the aluminum arms of his seat. His
  head ached dully. Then, full realization dawned upon him. He was a prisoner
  in the hands of agents of the Khan.</p>

  <p>His movement caught the girl's attention. She rose and made her way to the
  seat facing him.</p>

  <p>"I hope you're not feeling too ill," she said gently. "I'm sorry, Dick.
  Drugging you was necessary."</p>

  <p>"Then it's true!" he groaned. "You are the Nightshade&mdash;a sneaking
  Asiatic spy!"</p>

  <p>"Like a sneaking American spy," she retorted. "Dick, I serve my country in
  the best way I can, just as you and that Cass person and the rest of the
  Americans serve yours."</p>

  <p>She smiled. "He's a clever fellow, that Captain Cass. I'm afraid his
  suspicions will damage my value in America."</p>

  <p>"Well, not until&mdash;" He bit his lip, and hurried on, "Of course he
  will. He'll get those snapshots I have of you, and turn them over to his
  department. You're cooked as a spy from now on, Sally."</p>

  <p>"Oh, not that bad," she said. "You forget that every picture you have of
  me was taken with my camera. My camera is a very queer little mechanism; when
  I use it, it takes sharp, clear pictures, but when my friends use it, somehow
  the prints seem to come out blurred. Or hadn't you noticed that?"</p>

  <p>He had, of course. He asked glumly, "Where are we headed for?"</p>

  <p>"Asia," said Sally.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I thought so, since we're in a plane instead of a copter." Pound
  for pound and horse power for horse power, Lister knew that the planes were
  still more efficient than the copters, and the fact that Sally was using a
  plane meant a long flight.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked, after a moment's silence.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know? Because we have to have certain information from you. I'm
  sure it won't do any good to offer you safety for it, Dick; but I can
  promise, if it makes any difference to you."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't," he responded grimly. "I won't sell my country for my
  personal safety. Anyway, I haven't the least idea what information you think
  I can give you. Your bacteriologists are as good as ours; our epidemics
  haven't been any more successful than yours."</p>

  <p>She shook her soot-black hair. "Not bacteriology nor epidemics,
  Dick&mdash;algae!"</p>

  <p>"Algae! Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because you know the causes of this plague of slime in water, and lichens
  on land. It's an American weapon, and Asia needs the secret. It means
  everything&mdash;everything to us!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" he said guardedly. "Why everything?"</p>

  <p>"Don't act so innocent, Dick. You know quite well what the plague of
  lichens is doing in Siberia. It's clogging the rail lines, and the algae is
  blocking the rivers. You know how important it is to keep our Alaskan
  expeditionary force supplied with coal and oil to power the Beckerley fields,
  and you know that if our fields fail for lack of fuel, the war's over. We're
  licked.</p>

  <p>"You Americans use Alaskan coal, but our coal has to come all the way from
  the Stanovoi Mountains, either by water across the Sea of Okhotsk, or by rail
  up through Dezhnev. And it's becoming impossible to keep the rails open;
  Siberia is being strangled by your accursed lichens."</p>

  <p>"Well, what about the water route?"</p>

  <p>"Water! Ships are stalled all over the seven seas. Look there!"</p>

  <p>He glanced through the floor window at the Pacific, five thousand feet
  below, visible now through a vast opening in the clouds. The sea had a
  curious aspect; it was not blue, but brilliant grass-green. Peering closer,
  he made out two tiny vessels idle on the surface.</p>

  <p>"As bad as that!" he muttered, wondering what was happening to Allen's
  mighty fleet. Would the admiral attempt to cross the choked ocean? To Sally
  he said, "That's fine. The more strangled Siberia gets, the better it suits
  me."</p>

  <p>For the first time in their acquaintance a sign of irritation showed in
  her face. "It won't be for long!" she snapped angrily. "We'll get the secret
  out of you. Make no mistake about that, Dick!"</p>

  <p>"And you," he said thoughtfully, "are sweet little Sally Amber, who said
  that she loved me."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, her face was gentle. "And if I do love you?" she murmured. "If I
  do, would that make a difference to you, Dick?"</p>

  <p>He laughed bitterly. "Do you think I'd believe you now? I know all about
  Princess Stephanie and her education. If you love anybody at all, it's the
  Khan!"</p>

  <p>"Not the Khan, but Asia," she said. "The Khan is nothing to me, except for
  what he means to my country. For he himself, Dick, trained me from childhood
  to be immune to love. And yet &mdash;and yet, Dick&mdash;I have never met a
  man whom I&mdash;like&mdash;as I do you. You mean less to me than Asia, but
  more to me than any human being in the world."</p>

  <p>"And that," he sorrowfully asserted, "is another one of your pretty
  lies."</p>

  <p>For a long moment, she was silent. "No. It isn't a lie," she said at last,
  rising and returning to her place beside the pilot.</p>

  <p><br>
  SHE addressed not another word to Lister until seven hours later, when they
  were soaring over Honshu, and snow-tipped Fujiyama slid beneath. Then she
  returned to the seat facing him, smiled very gently, and said softly, "I am
  terribly unhappy about this, Dick."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" he said. "You ought to be triumphant."</p>

  <p>"But I'm not. Listen to me, Dick. The Khan's intelligence division is not
  gentle. A number of the operatives are Mongols, and their methods of
  extracting information do not include kindness. It hurts me to think of you
  under torture, Dick."</p>

  <p>"You ought to have thought of that last night.''</p>

  <p>"But I can save you from it. If you'll tell me what I want to know about
  the plague of algae and lichens, I'll guarantee your safety. Isn't that the
  best way&mdash;for both of us?"</p>

  <p>"No, Sally. I'm not saying that I have the information you want, but you
  can be sure, that, whether I have it or not, I'll never tell Asia anything
  that might help."</p>

  <p>She sighed and left him, but her glorious, dark eyes were troubled. They
  were still troubled when the great Khingan range loomed on the horizon, and
  the plane slanted down into Harbin. She even seemed to pale when at last a
  slant-eyed guard took the key from her, and released Lister from his seat;
  and she followed the grim parade, as half a dozen men herded him into the
  centuries-old stone fortress that served as a military prison.</p>

  <p>She did not enter the dark stone-walled cell; but, as the door swung shut,
  Lister glimpsed her pale face in the corridor. Her lips formed a silent
  phrase; he could have sworn that it was, "I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>Well, it was too late now for her sorrow to help him, even if he believed
  in its sincerity. And he smiled bitterly, as he thought of the wild mistake
  that had led to his abduction. The algae and the lichens. Asia strangling in
  the grip of a plague that arose from so simple a cause that&mdash;if he
  told&mdash;a schoolboy could see the remedy.</p>

  <p>Luckily for America, the cryptogams flourished most luxuriantly in Asia;
  and, until he told, all advantage lay with the Western continent. Until he
  told! He ceased to smile, and set his jaw grimly. He was not going to tell.
  Torture or none, he had to be strong enough to keep silent.</p>

  <p>Hours passed. He heard conversations in the corridor outside, but they
  were in some Asiatic tongue, and meant nothing to him. Then a chance colloquy
  in lingua franca told him that the Khan was not in Harbin, but was still with
  the troops on the Alaskan front. At last a guard brought him a jug of water,
  slimy-green with algae, and a slab of coarse bread; but this man, a Mongol,
  spoke neither English nor lingua Franca, or at least refused to speak
  them.</p>

  <p>It was deep night when four grim Orientals and a stolid Siberian led him
  from his cell to a chamber that seemed sunk far underground. A single, dim
  electric light illuminated it, and a dozen pairs of cold eyes surveyed
  him&mdash;and one pair that was not cold. Sally Amber sat at the head of the
  narrow table, and she met his gaze with eyes that were wide, troubled, and
  apprehensive.</p>

  <p>Then she addressed him. "Dick," she said softly, "I have told the
  interlocutory committee that you will give them what knowledge you have
  concerning this plague of mosses and algae. They have promised me your safety
  if you tell, and I have assured Comrade Plotkin that you would."</p>

  <p>"Then, as usual, you lied," said Lister grimly.</p>

  <p>Plotkin spoke out of the depths of his beard. "You see, Kazarovna," he
  rumbled, "only one method works with these stubborn American apes. I think it
  best we try that method."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" gasped Sally Amber. "Let me question him first. He'll tell me. I
  can get it from him. Please&mdash;" She broke off suddenly as Plotkin's icy
  eyes surveyed her curiously.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell?" he asked Lister, and then, at the latter's stubborn
  silence, "Very well. The pincers under the arm-pits first, I think. An ounce
  or so of flesh from the proper places can sometimes unblock the stream of
  information."</p>

  <p><br>
  SALLY&mdash;or Stephanie&mdash;choked back a sob and covered her eyes. The
  four Mongol guards forced Lister's arm upward; for a moment, he struggled,
  but realized instantly that it was utterly useless. The stolid Siberian
  seized a glittering little instrument, and the pincers tore a ragged tatter
  of flesh from his armpit. He bit his lip fiercely to suppress the groan of
  pain that sought utterance, but there was no sound in the chamber save
  Sally's stifled sob.</p>

  <p>"Why so unstrung, Kazarevna?" asked Plotkin amiably. "Surely the Princess
  Stephanie has witnessed more extreme measures than this."</p>

  <p>She smiled wanly. "Of course. It's just that I haven't yet recovered from
  my sojourn in America&mdash;a&mdash;a horrible place!" Plotkin nodded and
  turned back to Lister. "Shall we try it again?" He smiled. "Or would you
  prefer a variation?"</p>

  <p>"Neither," said the biologist, "I'll tell." Impassively he met the
  startled, relieved, unbelieving eyes of Sally. If she was acting, he thought,
  it was certainly good acting!</p>

  <p>"Good&mdash;good!" rumbled Plotkin. "You're much wiser&mdash;or at least
  less stubborn&mdash;than some of your country-men whom we have found it
  necessary to question. Now then, let us hear the secret."</p>

  <p>"You'd better take this down carefully," said Lister. "It's rather
  intricate." He waited as Plotkin spoke in Rusian to a man at his side, then
  began: "The plague of algae and lichens," he said slowly, "is due to the
  great increase in numbers of thallogens. If the confervae were checked, the
  trouble would disappear."</p>

  <p>"And what," barked Plotkin, "are thallogens?"</p>

  <p>"Thallogens are the third grand division of the cryptogamia. The group
  consists of the ulvae and fuci, besides the confervae."</p>

  <p>"Can't you put that in understandable language?" snapped Plotkin.</p>

  <p>"I can express scientific information only in the language of science,"
  said Lister, his eyes on Sally's fascinated one. "Your own scientists will
  have to translate it for you."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" asked the Siberian eagerly.</p>

  <p>"That is all. Reduce the confervae, and there will be less thallogens. And
  when there are less thallogens, the algae and lichens will cease to trouble
  you. It's really very simple."</p>

  <p>"Take him back to his cell," rumbled Plotkin. "And this had better be
  true, my friend, unless you crave further treatment."</p>

  <p>"Every word of it is true," Lister asserted. It was still deep night when,
  three hours later, the door of his cell opened, and a slim figure slipped
  stealthily in. For a moment he thought it was a boy; then he recognized
  Sally, wearing the shorts and rolled hose of a copterman. She closed the door
  quietly behind her, then rushed abruptly into his arms.</p>

  <p>"I can't stand it!", she sobbed. "Why did you do it? Plotkin is
  furious&mdash;insane with rage. He'll have you rotted bit by bit with acid!
  He'll&mdash;he'll&mdash;Why did you trick him, Dick?" Lister looked down into
  her white face. "Is this acting, too?" he asked coolly. "After all, the
  Princess Stephanie, the Nightshade, isn't supposed to be able to care what
  happens to a man."</p>

  <p>"But I do! I love you, Dick. I care for nothing except you and Asia, but I
  can't bear to see you killed or tortured even for Asia." She paused,
  suppressing her sobs.</p>

  <p>"Plotkin is wild," she said. "He wired a copy of your statement to the
  university at Tsitsihar, and back came the scornful reply that all that your
  words meant was that the plague of algae is due to an increase in the amount
  of algae." He smiled. "Well? Isn't that true?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but&mdash;Oh, Dick, it's becoming horrible! They've kept the cities
  supplied with water by adding calcium chloride to the supply, but all through
  the country&mdash;all through the world, I guess&mdash;wells are choked and
  rivers smothered, and oceans have become heaving masses of slime. And on land
  the mosses spread like flames of gray fire!" He was still suspicious, though
  he held the girl tightly in his arms. "Is this an attempt to play on my
  sympathies?" he asked. "I warn you, Sally, I'll tell you nothing."</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether you do or not! Don't you understand, Dick? I love
  you!"</p>

  <p>"If you love me, you'll help me escape from here."</p>

  <p>She pushed herself out of his arms, and stared at him with indignation at
  his disbelief. "And why else do you think I came?" she asked in a very low
  voice. "Follow me, quickly, before Plotkin cools down enough to put his mind
  on the details of your torture."</p>

  <p>She stepped to the door, rapping sharply. It opened instantly, and they
  passed into the dim corridor beside a young Russian guard who looked at Sally
  with tragic eyes. She spoke softly; the man extended his bared arm, and the
  girl scratched it hastily with one of her finger nails. Lister watched the
  man as he sank slowly into a limp sprawl on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Thus it will seem like American trickery," she whispered. "But I am
  afraid he will die for treason, none the less."</p>

  <p>"Why did he do it?"</p>

  <p>"Because," she said simply, "he loves me."</p>

  <p><br>
  LISTER followed her up a narrow flight of stone steps, wondering how many of
  the barred doors in the corridor hid American prisoners. At last, she paused.
  "Wait here," she whispered, and moved from his view along a passage.</p>

  <p>He heard a low-voiced conversation in Chinese, and then Sally was at his
  side again. "Come on," she called softly. "I've sent this one with a fake
  message to Plotkin."</p>

  <p>Lister followed her up yet another flight of steps, and emerged suddenly
  into starlight. They had attained the roof of the structure, and he glanced
  apprehensively at the lights of Harbin all around. Sally was slipping toward
  a copter, a tiny, single-man observer.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" she breathed, "get in."</p>

  <p>"Both of us?" He frowned doubtfully at the tiny craft.</p>

  <p>"We must. For I have to show you what to do. This alone would not carry,
  you far."</p>

  <p>He crowded in beside her. The tiny cabin swung like a pendulum as the
  vertical screw whirred and whined, and bored its way heavily aloft. Sally
  flashed her green passage light, waiting anxiously for the reply from the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"There!" she exclaimed in relief. "They've turned off this section of the
  Beckerley field. I have a pass, but if they had discovered your escape they
  might have blocked all passage&mdash;especially mine, I think; for I am sure
  that Plotkin has ceased to trust me."</p>

  <p>The craft whined into darkness. The lights of the city diminished and
  dimmed; and, at last, Sally relaxed, leaning more comfortably against him in
  the close quarters of the cabin.</p>

  <p>"We're beyond searchlights at last," she said. "Now they'll have to wait
  until dawn to pursue us, and by dawn we might be anywhere in this half of
  Asia, for all that they can tell. If this corkscrew only holds
  together&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It did. When the red sunrise flashed up on the sea, they were directly
  over a narrow promontory that struck south into the waters. Lister gasped as
  he saw those waters, for surely this was the most amazing sea ever glimpsed
  by earthly eyes, at least since the plesiosaur looked over the oceans of the
  carboniferous age hundreds of millions of years ago.</p>

  <p>It was a brilliantly smooth, green sea, seeming at first as motionless as
  turf. But, as the copter dropped toward the beach, Lister could distinguish
  motion, a slow heaving of the slime as if the vast expanse were breathing.
  There were no breakers, for the algae had at last tamed storm and wind, and
  the seas permitted the wind to slip as smoothly above them as if the waters
  had been covered with a film of oil. The one thing that sent a tremor of
  disgust through Lister was the sight of sea birds stalking dismally over a
  crust of slime that had dried enough to support them, gobbling up billions of
  flies.</p><a id="pic1"

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">It was sickening&mdash;disgusting&mdash;the slow heaving
    of the slime.</p>
  </div>

  <p><br>
  SALLY wasted not a glance on the scene. "The south cape of Taiwan," she said,
  as the copter grounded on a slimy beach, "or, as you call it, Formosa.
  There's a boat here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A boat? How can we use a boat&mdash;in that?"</p>

  <p>"Listen a moment. In that shed, there's one of the experimental side-
  wheelers, a quick adaptation by our scientists, who had foreseen this
  outcome, if the algae were not checked. Side-wheels can push a light hull
  right over the algae. They don't foul like propellers. This one has a
  dynoline engine, and a range of about a thousand miles."</p>

  <p>"A thousand miles! I can't get anywhere on that!"</p>

  <p>"You can get as far as I want you to get," she retorted with narrowed
  eyes. "You can reach Hongkong&mdash;that's British&mdash;or you can make
  Haiphong in French Indochina. Hongkong is much the closer."</p>

  <p>"But they're neutral! I'll be interned, if I go into a neutral port. I
  want to get back to America and my job."</p>

  <p>"And I," said Sally softly, "want to see to it that you don't. I'm being
  enough of a traitor to Asia now, without letting a dangerous enemy like you
  return to service. All I want is to see you safe, Dick."</p>

  <p>She turned away, and he followed her to the shed she had pointed out.
  There was the boat, true enough, a thirty-foot, open affair with six-foot
  paddle wheels like a miniature old Mississippi side-wheeler.</p>

  <p>"Do you see this?" asked the girl, indicating a curious device of twisted
  glass tubing. "That's a sun-alembic. You put sea water in it, and the
  evaporation creates a partial vacuum in which the sea water can be distilled
  for drinking. The sun does it, just as it does with the rain.</p>

  <p>"Under here is concentrated food for about a month. Can you take care of a
  dynoline engine? If the algae clog the cooling coils, you must stop and clean
  them at once."</p>

  <p>"I know all that, but what about you, Sally? Will you be safe after
  this?"</p>

  <p>"I can take care of myself." Her tone was confident enough, but Lister
  could see that she was under a terrific strain in this struggle between duty
  and desire. "Oh, Dick," she said shakily, "if this war is ever
  over&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It won't be long now. As soon as the Khan's supply of fuel to Alaska
  fails him, he's ended."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but he's laying&mdash;" She caught herself, flushing miserably.</p>

  <p>"Laying a pipe line, eh?" finished Lister. "I rather thought he would.
  He'll power the Beckerley fields with oil, eh?"</p>

  <p>Sally laughed bitterly. "The downfall of the Nightshade!" she declaimed.
  "No wonder they fear love in a spy. Dick, that is the first slip that I've
  ever made, and my one consolation is that long before you can get to any
  place from where you could send that information to America, it will be too
  late. The work will be completed and protected by fields. And
  so&mdash;goodby."</p>

  <p>With the feel of her lips still on his, he watched the copter flutter its
  way into the north; then turned to the craft he was to use, whose only name
  was a Chinese ideograph. It slid easily into the slip; and, without further
  hesitation, he started the engine, engaged the paddles, and was on his
  way.</p><a id="pic2"
        name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1401881h-images/SmotheredSeas-2.png"

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">He started the engine, engaged the paddles, and was on
    his way.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>His progress was a queer species of locomotion. The blades threw up vast
  lumps of green slime that fell behind with sullen, splashless plumps; and the
  light craft, thrust forward by the incredibly powerful dynoline engines, slid
  easily along the surface of the magot-infested slime. It was not unduly slow;
  he judged that the boat made twenty-five knots.</p>

  <p>Formosa was a receding shadow when he passed the first stalled ship. This
  was a Dutch freighter, and the crew &mdash;or what was left of them, since
  many had doubtless been put ashore by copter&mdash;crowded the rail to watch
  his passage. He waved, but there was never a sign of response.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he realized the cause of the grim silence; his craft bore gold
  and purple stripes&mdash;the colors of the Khan &mdash;and the Dutch, with
  Borneo, Celebes, and New Guinea in the very shadow of the vast Asiatic Union,
  had no love for the Khan.</p>

  <p>His coil clogged, and he paused to clean the slime from the screens. It
  was at this moment that the idea struck him; he sat suddenly erect, staring
  eastward where the China Sea met the mighty Pacific. Why did he have to go to
  Hongkong or Haiphong&mdash;or any neutral port, for that matter?</p>

  <p>What other possibilities were there? He glanced at the map of the East
  Indies, affixed to the cowl of the motor. There was Luzon, of course; but the
  Philippines, during their half century of independence, had grown far closer
  to Asia, in sympathy, than to the United States.</p>

  <p>There were the Marianas, where Admiral Allen had all but annihilated the
  Asiatic fleet, and where surely there must be an American garrison, if he
  could but reach them. But the Marianas lay two thousand miles out in the
  Pacific, close to Guam. He had, fuel for half that distance, but&mdash;</p>

  <p><br>
  HE swung the craft about and set it lurching back toward the Dutch freighter.
  The maintenance crew watched him sullenly as he approached. He pulled close
  under the hull and shouted, "Any of you understand English?"</p>

  <p>A man pushed to the rail. "Yes! What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Listen! I'm American, not Asian. Look!"</p>

  <p>He was not in uniform, since the biological branch did not require it, but
  he displayed his identification tag, with its red-white-and-blue shield
  plainly visible.</p>

  <p>There was a stir. "What do you want?" asked the man above him, but in
  friendlier tones.</p>

  <p>"Just some information. I want to know if there's an American or British
  ship stalled between here and Guam. I want to buy some fuel. You been in
  touch with any?"</p>

  <p>There was a long conversation in Netherlands dialect. At last Lister's
  informant spoke again. "De Britisher Resolute&mdash;she stuck&mdash;by
  latitude 21'20" and longitude 135'60"."</p>

  <p>Lister looked at his map, marking the position. It would do; it was almost
  exactly a thousand miles east of his present position, and might be a close
  gamble with his fuel, but it was worth the try. If he reached the Britisher
  and got fuel, he could then certainly make Guam or the Marianas, and give to
  the American army the news that the lichens had blocked the Siberian
  railroads, thus cutting off the fuel supply to the Khan's Alaskan Beckerley
  fields, but that the Khan was frantically laying a pipe line.</p>

  <p>Between the giving out of the Khan's coal supply and the arrival of his
  first oil, there might be a brief gap of time, during which his Beckerley
  fields would be dead. If America only knew this, and could strike then, the
  war would be won. Lister must try to get the information to America in
  time!</p>

  <p>So he set the boat lurching away into the east. Little by little, the
  Dutch ship faded toward the horizon, and Formosa was a dark cloud sinking
  ever lower. At last he was alone on a dead, green sea that barely moved, and
  his passage left no wake save a slightly darker green scraping, that slowly
  closed behind him. No fin cut the slimy surface, and but few birds soared,
  for their slime-bred prey was too abundant to draw them far from land.</p>

  <p>He set his course carefully on a great circle, to conserve his fuel. The
  malodorous slime sickened him with its stench. The perpetual lurching of his
  craft added to his nausea. Day faded into a starry darkness, and darkness
  into day.</p>

  <p>He made it. At the second midnight, with scarcely a pint of dynoline
  remaining in his tank, the lights of the Resolute flashed out of the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>But convincing the captain was almost as difficult a job as the passage
  itself.</p>

  <p>"It's deuced irregular!" That official grunted. We're neutrals." But at
  last, because England had India and Papua and the Malay States, and hated
  Asia and all its component parts by tradition and policy, the British captain
  acceded to Lister's request, and Lister set out again with a full tank.</p>

  <p>He had tried to get the captain to send a code message by radio to America
  for him, but to that the captain had proved adamant.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>IV.</h2>

  <p class="first">EARLY next morning, on glancing back, he spied a plane,
  winging swiftly out of the shadows that still clouded the west and the
  distant China Seas. Soon it arrived, and circled far above him, then slanted
  downward in a wide spiral. The double-headed golden eagle of the Khan's air
  force glittered on its wings.</p>

  <p>The machine swung close. An arm waved vigorously, gesturing in the
  direction of the west. The pilot was ordering him back.</p>

  <p>Lister stared with narrowed eyes, but permitted his boat to jog right
  ahead. He was not going to be turned back so easily as that. All the same, he
  had a feeling anything but comfortable, for he was completely at the mercy of
  the Asiatic aviator, should the latter choose to use bullet or bomb.</p>

  <p>The plane circled again. Suddenly Lister realized with a start of
  amazement that the craft was attempting to land&mdash;to alight on that
  sticky mass of heaving slime! It was impossible!</p>

  <p>But the plane seemed able to achieve the impossible. Its pontoons skipped
  lightly over the treacherous stuff, bounding toward him. It was all but down
  safely, and then&mdash;then the inevitable! Either the plane dipped or the
  sea heaved&mdash;Lister could not tell which&mdash;and the idling propeller
  struck a mass of green slime. Very gently, the plane lifted its tail and
  nosed over, the green corruption spewing from the spinning blades. And the
  pilot&mdash;for a single instant Lister had a clear view of the form that was
  catapulted through the air&mdash;was plunged into the impassive algos. All
  that remained was a quickly filling depression and the sinking plane.</p>

  <p>But he had seen enough. Sally Amber! It was Sally who struggled somewhere
  in the depths of that nauseating sea. And he&mdash;he was as helpless to aid
  her as though he were a thousand miles away.</p>

  <p>He spun the wheel; the boat bounced and jogged toward the spot. As near as
  he could bring it without disturbing the gradually closing dent in the slimy
  surface of the sea, he halted the craft. He seized the twenty-foot rope
  fastened to the bow, and tied one end of the rope firmly around his arm.
  Then, fixing his gaze on the spot, he plunged down into the slime.</p>

  <p>It was like trying to swim in heavy oil. To move his arms at all required
  a great effort, and then he was not sure whether he was going down, or up, or
  sidewise, or was just churning. The stuff clogged his nose, his eyes, his
  ears&mdash;even his mouth, when in an unguarded moment he opened it.</p>

  <p>His hand struck something solid. It was an instant before he realized that
  it was Sally's ankle. He clutched it in a grasp of desperation, and gave a
  yank on the rope tied to his arm. Pulling in on the rope was difficult, as he
  had only one free hand with which to work. Once he lost hold of the rope in
  the slime, and had to start all over again, groping along it from where it
  was tied to his arm.</p>

  <p>He scarcely knew when he reached the surface, so thick was the coating of
  muck he carried with him. He thrust the girl across the gunwale, and then had
  to stop to clear his nose and mouth before he could even breathe. He
  clambered into the boat.</p>

  <p>Sally was not unconscious, but her nausea made her almost as green as the
  algae she clawed out of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Dick," she said, "for the rescue. I'm ashamed that I needed
  it."</p>

  <p>"Why are you here, Sally?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes hardened a bit. "Why are you here, Dick? I told you to make for
  Hongkong or Haiphong."</p>

  <p>"But I didn't promise to, Sally."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not, but do you think I can let you get to an American ship or
  port, with the information you have? It's bad enough that I let it slip, and
  that I helped you to escape, but I will not play traitor to Asia any further
  than that! Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"How'd you find me?"</p>

  <p>"It occurred to me, after I left you, that you might try just what you
  did. I got back to Harbin before Plotkin thought of connecting me with your
  escape&mdash;if he's thought of it yet&mdash;so I was able to get a plane. I
  flew over the China Sea between Taiwan and Hongkong, until I was sure you
  weren't on that route. Then I flew east.</p>

  <p>"For two days, I've been scouring this area. You see, I anticipated that
  you'd head for Guam. But now, Dick, you're going where I say. We're going
  back to Luzon. The Philippines are neutral, but they're friendly to Asia, so
  I can have you interned there, and yet, with a little influence, go free
  myself. Start your engine."</p>

  <p>He did. The boat took up its eastward course.</p>

  <p>"Turn about!" she snapped. When he merely smiled, she reached suddenly
  into the bosom of her aviator's shirt and produced a tiny Japanese automatic,
  one of the diminutive nine-caliber, but deadly with its high-velocity,
  chrome-jacketed bullets. "Put about, Dick!"</p>

  <p>With a movement so casual that she was caught completely off guard, he
  kicked the weapon from her hand, and. it spun off into the slime. "We go my
  way, Sally," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>She sobbed, "I ought to have killed you! But I couldn't, and this is the
  result."</p>

  <p>Abruptly she turned her glorious deep eyes upon him. "Dick, do you know
  what will happen to me, if you take me to Guam? You know what they do to
  spies! Do you want me to be shot against a wall?"</p>

  <p>"Lord!" he muttered. "I didn't think of that. Listen, Sally. The Pelew
  Islands are Japanese, and they're not far off my course. I'm going to land
  you there about midnight, and you're going to be thoroughly bound, and very
  tightly gagged, so you can't rouse any pursuit. After the war is over, maybe
  you will forgive me."</p>

  <p>"I forgive you now, Dick," she said softly, but with a puzzling note in
  her voice. "The Nightshade is dead. I'm no good as a spy when you're
  involved. But I warn you that I shall still try to defeat you!"</p>

  <p>He swung the boat onto its new course. "If you can, Sally."</p>

  <p><br>
  SUDDENLY he noticed something which altered all his plans! Staring out over
  the horrible, slimy sea, he noticed a change. In addition to the green, there
  were now vast patches of brown &mdash;of dying algae!</p>

  <p>For a moment he failed to grasp the significance of this. Then, so
  suddenly that Sally jumped, he shouted, "I see it all now! It has
  happened!"</p>

  <p>"Wh-what?"</p>

  <p>"The Khan's Beckerley fields are off in Alaska! His Siberian railroads are
  blocked at last by the fungi! He's out of fuel! It can't be our fields that
  are off, for our coal mines are too close behind our lines to be cut off in
  this way."</p>

  <p>"How can you know that any Beckerley fields are off?" asked Sally.</p>

  <p>"The&mdash;the&mdash;" He caught himself, then proceeded, "We're not going
  to Pelew Island, after all. We're going to Guam. This information can't wait;
  for, if the American lines know it and advance at once, the war's over. Our
  Beckerley fields are on, and yours are off!"</p>

  <p>"How&mdash;how do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you, for it can't do any harm now. You wanted to know what I
  knew about this plague of algae, didn't you? Well, I'll tell you, Sally. It
  isn't an American weapon; it's an accident!"</p>

  <p>"An&mdash;accident?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, or a by-product. It's the result of the Beckerley fields. I got the
  hunch when I learned that the center of the trouble seemed to be Alaska. Up
  in Alaska there are two enormous fields of force within a few hundred feet of
  each other, ours and yours. Between them is a hundred-mile-long zone of
  terrific electrical strain. What's the result? Ozone! Tons of ozone pouring
  up into the air, until the very envelope of air around the earth was
  affected.</p>

  <p>"The normal ozone content increased, and this layer of ozone around the
  earth cut off the sun's death rays which had been maintaining the balance of
  nature. Relieved from the restraining influence of the death rays, the
  cryptogamia&mdash;the lichen; and fungi and algae&mdash;increased to abnormal
  quantities.</p>

  <p>"But it's over now. Ozone is unstable and goes rapidly back to normal. The
  ozone in the air is decreasing. The death rays are getting through again.</p>

  <p>"How do I know? Because the algae are dying, and that can mean only one
  thing&mdash;that there are no longer two Beckerley fields opposing each other
  in Alaska, pouring ozone into the air. There is only one Beckerley
  field&mdash;ours. The Khan's shield is gone, and all we need do is
  advance!"</p>

  <p>Sally was very pale now. "I wish you hadn't told me this," she whispered.
  "Oh, Dick, don't you see that it means that I just have to stop you? If you
  love me, throw me into the slime of the sea, for I'd rather die than live
  these next few hours trying to kill you!"</p>

  <p>His triumphant face sobered. "Hours?" he echoed. "It will take us three
  days to reach Guam. Sally, when I need sleep, I'm going to tie you up. And I
  hope you don't resist, because Lord knows I don't want to hurt you."</p>

  <p>But she yielded quite submissively when, a few hours later, he twisted the
  painter rope about her wrists and ankles. He remembered her trick of the
  drugged finger nail, and carefully avoided giving her another similar
  opportunity. Then he set and locked the gyro steering compass, and curled up
  on one of the seats to sleep.</p>

  <p>When he awoke, the boat was still slapping along across the slime. Sally
  was still securely tied and apparently in. the same position, but the bottom
  of the boat was wet with some colorless fluid.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" he snapped.</p>

  <p>"It's your fuel," said Sally triumphantly. "I drained the tank."</p><a id=
  "pic3"
        name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">"It's your fuel," she said triumphantly. "I drained the
    tank."</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>He gasped! But in a moment he broke out in a chuckle of relief. "That
  isn't dynoline," he said. "That's the fresh water from the sun-alembic I was
  saving against a cloudy day. The water tank's air-tight, and the algae can't
  get in."</p>

  <p>Sally sagged despondently in her place. "Will you untie me?" she asked
  dully. "I'm very cramped,"</p>

  <p><br>
  HE ventured an attempt to sleep only once more, and this time lying full
  length against the fuel tank, while he bound Sally not only hand and foot,
  but lashed her to the gunwale as well. And when he awakened, she had kicked
  the sun-alembic to bits.</p>

  <p>"Why'd you do that?" he asked angrily. "Although we don't need water for
  the one day that's left to travel, it would be a convenience."</p>

  <p>"I did it so that if we miss Guam we'll be dead before some scouting
  American plane happens to run across us."</p>

  <p>"We won't miss Guam," he promised grimly.</p>

  <p>As the hot, stinking day wore on, the grueling grind began to tell on
  Lister. All about them the algae was turning brown, and the stench was almost
  unbearably nauseating.</p>

  <p>"I'm going bats," he told the girl. "A crazy poem keeps hammering at my
  head. I've got to pass it on, or I shall go bats. Did you ever hear the
  short-short-short story about Algy? All this rotting algae is what suggested
  it to me, I guess."</p>

  <p>Sally turned intent catlike eyes on him, aroused from her lethargy by the
  possibility of his cracking.</p>

  <p>"Go on. Tell it to me," she urged insidiously.</p>

  <p>He laughed harshly, discordantly, gave his head a violent shake, and ran
  the back of his hand across his tired eyes.</p>

  <p>"It goes like this," he said:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Bear met Algy.<br>
  Bear et Algy.<br>
  Bear was bulgy.<br>
  Bulge was Algy."</p>

  <p><br>
  Suddenly, he gave a wild laugh. "That's all wrong this time!" he declared.
  "By Heaven! The bear isn't eating Algy this time. Algae is eating the
  bear&mdash;the Siberian bear. We've got them licked, if we ever reach
  Guam."</p>

  <p>"We never will reach Guam," the girl taunted him.</p>

  <p>"Won't we?" he exclaimed. "Look! A low shore line showed in the darkening
  east. "Guam!" he announced, sober and sane once more.</p>

  <p>Sally was disconsolate. "I've lost, then," she whimpered. "Please, Dick,
  be kind to me, and&mdash;let me kiss you now, in case anything happens."</p>

  <p>He knew what she meant. He had worried enough over the question of what
  would happen to the lovely Nightshade; for, despite his assurance, he knew
  that Captain Cass was aware of Sally's identity. The two days of grace were
  long since up&mdash;Cass would have reported the circumstances of Lister's
  disappearance.</p>

  <p>Cass' description of Sally, together with the blurred photographs in
  Lister's office, would certainly identify the girl. Nothing could save her
  from a wall at sunrise. So he drew her into his arms with a tenderness born
  of despair.</p>

  <p>Just in time he realized her intent. He caught her wrist as she struck
  with her drugged finger nail at his throat.</p>

  <p>"Damn you, Sally!" he blazed. "Now I'm going to give you a dose of your
  own medicine. There's only one way you're safe to have around, and that's
  unconscious!"</p>

  <p>But she read his purpose. Before he could seize her forefinger, she had
  clenched it into a stubborn little fist, and she fought him with a strength
  that was amazing. But at last he saw the way: disregarding her blows against
  his face, he slowly, inexorably, crushed her clenched fist in his hand. She
  cried out in pain as her own finger nails were driven into the flesh of her
  palm, and then, suddenly, her eyes widened, fluttered, and closed, and she
  sank first to her knees, then in a limp heap at his feet.</p>

  <p><br>
  IT was deep night when he carried her up the side of the U.S. cruiser Dallas,
  stalled in the algae off Agana. Thrusting her into the arms of the ship's
  surgeon, he rushed to report to the commanding officer his information: that
  he knew, from the browning of the algae, that the Khan's Alaskan Beckerley
  field was off. The message did not need to wait for coding, for America still
  held the secret of non-interceptible radio.</p>

  <p>Scarcely an hour later came back the news that America had triumphed in
  Alaska.</p>

  <p>Later in the night came the flash that the Khan was dead&mdash;his body
  had been positively identified. America broadcast this news to the world.</p>

  <p>By morning, rioting and dissension had broken out all over Asia. The
  Asiatic Union was disintegrating. It was the beginning of the end.</p>

  <p>There was jubilation aboard the Dallas, but Dick Lister could not share in
  it. True, yes, he had saved America. He was a great national hero. The
  president in person had radioed his thanks.</p>

  <p>So Dick Lister pretended to be elated, to join in the
  celebration&mdash;for, of course, he had to. But, through it all, two faces
  haunted him: the piquant oriental features of the girl he loved, and the
  grim, inexorable, duty-mad features of Captain Cass. Regardless of the fact
  that the war was now over and won, regardless of the part which Lister had
  played in winning it, Cass would never rest until he had brought death to the
  archspy of the late enemy.</p>

  <p>And so, as soon as he could, Lister brake away from the jollification, and
  dragged his leaden feet toward the ship's hospital. There he stood with the
  ship's doctor, looking down on the still unconscious Sally.</p>

  <p>"A very beautiful girl, your fiancee," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Yes. We were kidnaped together by the Khan's spies, and she was really
  more important than I in accomplishing our escape. This is just exhaustion
  &mdash;and, of course, excitement." But he knew that Captain Cass would
  certainly spike that story.</p>

  <p>"Well," observed the doctor, "your coming is almost the first excitement
  I've, had out of this war. I hope you're right about the algae being over,
  for it's been ungodly dull being stuck here in all this slime. One casualty
  is all I've seen, and that one at a distance. A young officer tried to land
  his plane on the algae a week ago, nosed over, and was lost. They never
  recovered his body."</p>

  <p>"It's a difficult thing to do&mdash;find a body in that green muck," said
  Lister reminiscently. "Who was he?"</p>

  <p>"He was&mdash;let's see&mdash;a Captain Jim Cass. We knew who it was,
  'cause we'd been expecting him."</p>

  <p>Captain Jim Cass! A week ago. Then Cass had never returned to America He
  had died before the end of the two days of grace which he had granted Lister.
  And his knowledge of Sally's identity had died with him. Now no one would
  ever know!</p>

  <p>With a sob of joyous relief, Dick Lister dropped to his knees beside the
  sleeping form of the girl he loved.</p>
