<p>Production Notes:</p>
<p>This compilation began life simply as an account of Robert
Sholl's exploration in the Glenelg River Region of Western
Australia. But his expedition took place against an unusual
backdrop: his first year as Government Resident in a growing
region of the state, where a number of pastoral associations were
operating. It has expanded to become a collection of all of
Sholl's published writings for 1865.</p>
<p>All but one of the articles in the body of the
narrative&mdash;as dispatches to the Colonial
secretary&mdash;have been derived from various editions of the
<i>The Perth Gazette and West Australian Times</i> and <i>The
Inquirer and Commercial News</i> from 1865-66, as preserved on
the Internet by Trove (National Library of Australia).</p>
<p>Where Grey in 1841 showed Brecknock Harbour, Admiralty Charts
of the 1860s showed Camden Harbour. While the two names are now
used fairly interchangeably, the settlement at Camden Harbour was
situated in the south-eastern portion of Brecknock Harbour.</p>
<p>Different newspapers have different typographic schemes and
spellings. Some spellings have been made uniform, geographical
names in particular. For example, "Nicol" has been changed to
Nickol; "Gardiner" to Gairdner; "Berckleman" to Berckelman;
"p.c." to P.C.; "Wheatly" to Whately. On the other hand, a few
problems like "depot" vs. "depôt", "harbour" vs. "harbor", etc.,
have not been resolved. Ships' names remain either in italics or
double quotes</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<hr class="tenth">
<p>A newspaper article written more than twenty years after the
event, neatly summarising the state of affairs at Camden Harbour
at the commencement of 1865&mdash;with Robert Sholl's appointment
as Government Resident there&mdash;began thus:</p>
<p class="indent3">"Following close upon the settlement of
Roebuck Bay came that of Camden Harbour, which had been explored
many years before by Sir George Grey, who wrote in raptures of
its capabilities as a pastoral country; while Dr. Martin, who
visited the district in 1863, also described it as the finest
country in Australia.</p>

<p class="indent3">"Acting upon those reports, a Mr. William
Harvey of Melbourne, who possessed an imaginative brain,
conceived the idea of floating a company to colonise the distant
land. Accordingly, pamphlets were issued in the most tempting
form showing the advantages to be gained on joining the Camden
Harbour Pastoral Association&mdash;capital £20,000, in two
hundred shares of £100; and showing how each holder of five
shares should be entitled to a run of 100,000 acres, 200 sheep,
and twelve months' provisions.</p>
<p class="indent3">"The bait was too tempting to be resisted, and
in a short time the shares were taken up and a board of directors
appointed; three vessels were chartered to take stock and
shareholders to the promised land. The company comprised a
strange mixture&mdash;painters, plumbers, slaters, saddlers, and,
I may say that all trades furthest removed from stock raising
were well represented. They had a doctor and clergyman to attend
to the bodily and spiritual wants of the settlers, but not a
shoemaker, blacksmith, or carpenter in the company. The board of
management consisted of the parson, a saddler, a slater, a miner,
and only one man who had any knowledge of stock, and who, in
consequence, held a very unenviable position; and this gentleman,
Mr. T. C. Murray, now of Colac, Victoria, gained the good-will of
the whole community by his exertions for the general welfare.</p>
<p class="indent3">"On the 16th November, 1864, the barque
<i>Stag</i> sailed from Hobson's Bay with the first contingent,
and, after a good passage, reached Camden Harbour on the 13th
December. The bay itself is a fine sheet of water, the entrance
to which is a serpentine passage about half a mile wide, between
high cliffs, with nine fathoms water in the channel. The anchor
was dropped before sunset and shortly afterwards natives were
seen dancing around their fires on Augustus Island. Early next
morning the captain of the barque with several passengers made
for the shore to seek a landing place for stock and to find some
of the many streams of water which they were led to believe
emptied themselves into the bay, but after a fruitless walk of
several hours' duration in a tropical sun the searchers were
obliged to return to the boats in an almost famished
condition.</p>

<br>
<p class="indent3">"The matter now bore a serious aspect for
there were only three tanks of water on board and as the hills
around the harbour had recently been swept by a bush fire there
was no grass to be seen. In this strait a party consisting of E.
T. Hooley, A. McRae, C. Purdue and T. Ellwood volunteered to make
a pedestrian tour inland and search for water, and as time was of
the greatest importance the little band at once started, taking
some ship's biscuit and a gallon of water in a billy&mdash;canvas
water bags had not then been invented. After walking all night
the Glenelg river was sighted at daybreak, but the high hopes
with which the thirsty travellers hastened to its shores were
dashed to the ground by the discovery that the water was salt,
being within the influence of the tides, which here have a rise
of thirty-five feet. After several hours unsuccessful search for
water the little band, weary and foot sore, began their return
journey to the ship, and, after travelling five miles, Mr.
Ellwood cried out that he could go no further, and advised his
companions to leave him to his fate. This of course was out of
the question, so the party remained under the shade of some small
trees until sunset, suffering such pangs of thirst as can only be
experienced in a tropical climate in December, poor Ellwood
occasionally crying out in his agony: "I wish I had Sir George
Grey here or Dr. Martin, wouldn't I wring their necks, etc." With
some difficulty the poor fellow was induced to make another
start, and after walking a quarter of a mile a nice pool of
delicious water was discovered surrounded by drooping palms.
After drinking freely the water was pronounced the finest in the
world.</p>
<p class="indent3">"The return journey to the harbour was then
accomplished without further mishap. Here they learned that Mr.
T. C. Murray had discovered a good spring only half a mile from
the beach, to which the stock was taken. The <i>Helvetia</i>,
another of the company's stock ships, arrived on the 21st, and
the <i>Calliance</i> on the 25th December.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The <i>Calliance</i> got on a reef before entering the harbour
and sprung a leak, which led to her being put on the beach after
discharging cargo. During the process of beaching a hawser parted
and allowed the ship to drift on to some rocks, where she knocked
a large hole in her timbers and became a total
wreck.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class="indent3">"Very few sheep had been lost on the voyage,
but the latter vessel entered the port with her ensign at
half-mast, and it appeared that one of the shareholders had died
that morning in sight of land. As the sheep were landed they were
taken to Murray's spring and from thence to a creek five miles
back where water and some old feed had been discovered, but not
before several hundred sheep had died of poison on the burnt
ground. This poison plant was never discovered&mdash;and is
unknown to the present day.</p>
<p class="indent3">"After a few weeks, heavy rains set in and in
a short time the whole country, which consists of trap rock, was
thickly covered with green grass, but of a hard wiry nature and
destitute of nutriment. Very few natives were seen but on one
occasion three of the blacks attacked four white men and the
former had the best of the encounter. In February 1865 the barque
<i>Tien Tsin</i> arrived, bringing Mr. R. J. Sholl as Resident
Magistrate with a large staff of surveyors, police, pensioners,
etc. By this time most of the company had come to the conclusion
that the country was unsuitable for sheep and had resolved to
leave by the first
opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;."</p>

<h3>FIRST DISPATCH: 17 March, 1865.</h3>
<hr class="tenth">
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;"><i>Government
Resident's Office,<br>
Camden Harbour, March</i> 17, 1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honor to report
the safe arrival of my party at Camden Harbour, on the 17th
ultimo.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* That is, February. Sholl's wide-ranging
instructions on how to administer the post are given in Appendix
1.; <span class="aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>Our voyage from Champion Bay was of longer duration than
anticipated&mdash;owing to light breezes and occasional
calms.</p>
<p>There is little to record respecting the voyage, except that a
sandy island, not laid down in the Admiralty chart, was seen on
the 15th ultimo, in lat.(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), long.,
E.(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),** and which Captain Jarman named
Expedition Island. It is surrounded by reefs. From its eastern to
its western extremity it is about six miles in length, 50 feet
above the level of the water at low tide, and clothed at the
summit with either grass or scrub. At high spring tide, I should
say that very little of the island would be seen. The mortality
among our sheep was, I am sorry to state, very great. We lost 17
during the passage, and several were landed in a very weakly
state. Every care was exercised, and every precaution taken.</p>
<p class="foot">[** That is, lat. 15.32 S., long 123.3 E. See
later in this dispatch; <span class="aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>I attribute this mortality to various causes: 1st&mdash;An
insufficient supply of water; one pint per diem is too small a
quantity within the tropics&mdash;there should not be less than a
quart per sheep per diem. 2nd&mdash;Want of ventilation. They
were stowed forward of the main hatch. Had they been placed on
either side of the hatch, where the hay was stowed, they would
have had a better chance. 3rd&mdash;Under the most favourable
circumstances as regards water and ventilation, they must have
suffered severely, for the heat was more oppressive than I have
felt it on land&mdash;and while I am writing the thermometer
indicates 95½ degrees in a large tent&mdash;and the winds were
often light, and occasionally it was a dead calm. Shortly after
leaving Champion Bay the sheep were taken on deck every morning,
watered separately, and the pens thoroughly cleansed, yet they
still continued to die.</p>
<p>The horses were landed in good condition. There was but one
casualty, a mare of my own dying after we had arrived in Camden
Harbor.</p>
<p>The conduct of the men was generally good throughout the
voyage; but few were reported, and these only for trivial
offences or breaches of discipline. The health of all on board
was, on the whole, good.</p>
<p>The provisions supplied by the ship were good in quality and
ample in quantity.</p>
<p>We stood in for the high land at the entrance of Brecknock
Harbor during the afternoon of the 15th ultimo, and anchored in
the evening in 25 fathoms water, at a distance of about 10 miles
from the entrance. We had scarcely taken in sail when it blew
very strong off the land. During the time the squall lasted it
was very violent, but it did not continue more than
half-an-hour.</p>
<p>On the following day we were obliged to anchor from 11 until
near 1 o'clock, the wind being at first contrary and afterwards
dying away. At the latter hour we had a light fair wind, which
gradually freshened.</p>
<p>The view was magnificent; high lands and islands, at one time
blended together, but as we approached opening distinct from each
other, masses of red brown rock at their base and running far
into the sea, clothed to the summit with grass or herbage of the
most vivid green, bold headlands similarly clad, an extensive
sheet of water, almost surrounded by land of an apparently
fertile description, framed the picture upon which we gazed, and
seemed to realise the descriptions which we had heard or
read.</p>
<p>The Pinnacle Rock, just inside the entrance to Brecknock
Harbor, was eagerly sought for, and immediately recognized. It
is, indeed, a remarkable land-mark. Its appearance was that of a
gigantic native standing at the mouth of the Harbor. On close
approach it seemed, what it was, a detached dark red rock, about
14 feet high at low water, or rather at ebb-tide. At high
spring-tide the greater portion must be covered. We passed close
by this rock as we entered the Southern Channel.</p>
<p>The character of the scenery did not change as we proceeded up
Brecknock Harbor. There was the same elevated land, the same
verdantly-clad islands, the same bold headlands; but the expanse
of water was not so great, and we appeared to be passing through
a moderately-sized river.</p>
<p>As we approached towards Green and Sheep Islands, we saw in
the distance a stranded ship, of large size, which was at once
recognized by some on board, who had before seen the vessel, as
the "Calliance," one of the ships chartered by the Camden Harbour
Association, and of the burden of 800 tons. The daylight would
not permit us to reach the wreck, and we anchored to seaward of
Green Island.</p>
<p>During the night we saw lights on shore, and people moving
about a fire near the wreck, but, although a blue light was burnt
to attract attention, there was no communication with the shore
until next morning at daylight, when a boat came alongside with
some of the Camden Harbor settlers, who had just recovered a boat
at Augustus Island, which had been taken by the natives.</p>
<p>We arrived in Brecknock Harbor in high spirits, having been
highly delighted with what we had seen during the day. The wreck
of a large ship staring us in the face was, to be sure, no lively
object, but still, sure of our own safety, we did not take heed
of the bad omen; the land seemed all that it had been
represented.</p>
<p>The new comers, however, succeeded in damping our hopes.
Everything seemed to have gone wrong with the Association. They
arrived in December, the hottest season of the year, and suffered
severely. Three of their party died from <i>coup de soleil</i>
almost immediately after landing.</p>
<p>To my surprise, I heard that they had experienced great
difficulty in finding water, even for themselves. The spots named
by previous visitors were found to be without water. Several days
elapsed before they could discover sufficient for their stock,
and then it was at a spot at the head of the Harbor, only
approachable through a mangrove creek, and then only at high
tides. They were surrounded by mangroves, and their supply, after
all, was not abundant.</p>
<p>The grass was coarse and parched, the country stony and rocky
to an extraordinary degree, and the heat of the rocks was so
great that the feet of animals feeding in the country became
affected.</p>
<p>Their sheep&mdash;the pure merino breed&mdash;died by
hundreds. Out of 4,500 sheep landed but 1,354 were alive when we
arrived, and the number now must be less than 1,000. The horses
also suffered, but not to the same extent. Of 34 horses landed,
only 26 had survived.</p>
<p>Something else besides climate was answerable for this.</p>
<p>The members of the Association are, on the whole, are a good
class of men. Before they left Victoria they were in trade, or
farming small homesteads, some of them were squatters or
connected with squatting establishments. To be the possessor of
one share a man must have obtained £100, and as most of them had
accumulated not less than this sum, they must to a certain extent
have been thrifty and industrious. As shareholders they were all
equal&mdash;one had no more power than another.</p>
<p>This independence and equality had their attendant evils. All
were masters&mdash;there were no servants. Every man's business
was no man's business; the sheep and other stock were neglected,
allowed to wander, scorched to death by the tropical heats,
chilled to death by the tropical rains, lamed by the sharp
burning stones, starved on the innutritious grass, killed by the
native dogs, or lost for ever in the bush. Hay, bran, biscuit and
bacon were carried away by the high tides, and left rotting on
the seashore.</p>
<p>Necessity eventually taught them to make other arrangements,
but not until they had sustained heavy losses and received much
discouragement.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, they are men more likely to succeed on farms
ready made, or on spots of fertile land which have not to be
sought for, than to explore new country. Still among the number
there were some active and intelligent explorers. These young men
have examined carefully the country near the Glenelg and Gairdner
Rivers, but they have not discovered any large extent of fertile
country, and declare that, with the exception of the river flats,
all the land is stony. The approaches to the Glenelg from Camden
Harbor are described to be rugged in the extreme, and, although
attempts have been made, no pass has been discovered on the
southern side of the Glenelg. The furthest exploration in a
direct line from Camden Harbor does not, I believe, extend
further than 30 miles.</p>
<p>The number of settlers, including women and children, does not
exceed 100 souls. Their conduct has been extremely good. There
have been no breaches of the law&mdash;no attempt at violence,
whatever.</p>
<p>The heat they declared to have been very great. The
thermometer had been as high as 120 in the shade, and was never
lower than 84. They had only experienced three or four days'
rain. During the time I was on board the "Tien Tsin," the highest
range was 103, and on shore I have never found it above 95½ deg.,
and only once so high. It has never been below 80. The nights are
warm; the sea-breeze, however strong, very slightly affects the
thermometer. If I may use the expression, it is a tepid
sea-breeze. I have been congratulated by several members of the
Association for having arrived in the cool season.</p>
<p>Game is described as scarce, the country as scarcely passable
by horses, carts being useless. The natives had not been very
troublesome; in fact, very few of the settlers had seen any, and
there did not appear to be many in the neighbourhood. I may also
observe that none have come near my camp. They have been seen at
night at the huts of the seamen of the "Calliance," and have also
been near the huts of some people who bought the wreck of the
"Calliance." A night or two before we landed they pelted some
people, residing on this spot, with stones. Not more than four or
five were seen on these occasions, and it is worthy of note that
they chose the night-time for their visits. Mr. Assistant
Surveyor Cowle saw one on Augustus Island, who walked away when
discovered. We observe fires at Augustus Island, but no-where
else, and our natives have seen no tracks.</p>
<p>I made particular inquiries with respect to the supply of
provisions belonging to the Association. They have twelve months'
rations for everything except flour, and only enough of that to
last six months. They, however, expected a ship called the
"Jeanie Oswald" from Melbourne, with flour. But if, as they say,
discouraging accounts have been written by the "Stag," one of
their vessels, or carried by the passengers, 20 of whom left
Camden Harbor by that opportunity, there is no reason to expect
that any vessel with flour will arrive; and, judging by the
quantity of stores wasted or destroyed, they cannot have more
than three months' flour on hand, and some of the people will, in
all probability, be dependent upon the Government stores for
support.</p>
<p>The health of the settlers has been generally good,
diarrh&oelig;as and prickly heat being the prevailing complaints,
with one case of intermittent fever. Within the last week some of
them have been ailing, and there is more sickness than usual. My
party has escaped, with one exception, any serious attacks,
slight cases of opthalmia, boils, and sores, being the chief
diseases. The more serious case is that of a Pensioner who struck
his shin with the back of an axe inflicting a trifling wound, but
it festered, his leg swelled to a great size, there were strong
feverish symptoms, and it became necessary to obtain the services
of Dr. Oechme.* One of our men ruptured himself while lifting
some heavy packages during the landing, of the stores. The
slightest cut festers, the limb swells, and sometimes suppuration
takes place.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In a passenger list, Oehme; <span class=
"aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>The settlers did not bring any horned stock or pigs. They have
a few she goats and poultry which do well. Their horse stock
consists of mares. The only stallion they possessed died on the
passage. The horses look well but they are fed with corn in
addition to the natural, herbage. Our horses are looking well. We
have lost twelve sheep, most of whom were sickly when landed but
the remainder have somewhat improved in condition. Some two or
three have died from, it is supposed, eating a poisonous herb. I
examined one. The lung and liver were much inflamed, the heart
enlarged, and the gall bladder distended. It was much swollen, I
have desired the shepherd to bring me some of the alleged poison
plant which I shall send to Perth for examination.</p>
<p>The people at the Association Camp have not been troubled much
by mosquitoes but they complain of the flies. We can tell the
same tale. Explorers say that on the river flats the mosquitoes
are shocking pests.</p>
<p>Of the vegetable productions of the country I hear but little.
Of edible fruits the settlers mention several, the grape, the
currant, the fig, the plum, and a nondescript described to me as
something between a peach and an apple; there is also the wild
cucumber. I have tasted the grape and the currant; they are both
insipid. The former is in appearance like the black cluster, the
latter are of two kinds; one growing on a tree, not yet ripe, and
the others on a broad leaved plant growing close to the
ground.</p>
<p>On the 17th ult. the vessel has anchored in Camden Harbor, to
the southward of Sheep Island. On the 18th accompanied by Mr.
Phelps I went to the place called "Calliance" Camp where the
shipwrecked crew of that vessel are stationed. With respect to
that ship I may state that she struck upon a reef in Lat. 15.32
S., Long. 123.3 E. The reef was not marked on the chart. She was
got off with some difficulty and arrived in Camden Harbor on
Christmas Day, two days after the accident. After discharging
cargo she was brought in towards shore, for, the purpose of
examining whether she had received damage, when she was caught by
a fresh puff and went on the reef where she now lies. I did not
cause any inquiry to be instituted as the Captain and crew
proceed to Fremantle in the "Tien Tsin." I send you an extract
from the official log. After the wreck one of the boats was sent
to Timor where a schooner was engaged to take off the crew, but
she capsized near the Champagny Islands, when a Captain Edwards
was drowned. The boat arrived some days afterwards. She had been
upset in the same squall but was righted. The crew got the body
of Captain Edwards and attempted to bury it on one of the
Champagny Islands, but the natives drove them away and they were
compelled to throw the body overboard. The ship's launch was
dispatched to Timor on the 8th inst. I did not write by that
opportunity expecting the "Tien Tsin" to arrive at Fremantle some
time before those letters could be received.</p>
<p>Our object in visiting Calliance Camp was to select a spot for
a depôt, but we found the landing place rugged in the extreme,
and moreover there was no water, the camp being supplied from
Augustus Island, distant some seven miles, from whence it had to
be boated. This spot is in the position marked as probably a good
place for a townsite in our map, but, independent of lack of
water and bad landing, there is very little level ground, and
there is not enough space between the wells to sink even a survey
post.</p>
<p>From Calliance Camp we went to the old "horse camp" at which
place there were some huts occupied by a few settlers. Here the
stores of the Association were landed and afterwards rafted to
their camp. The landing though not of the best was superior to
the one formerly visited; and here we found water in some holes
about a quarter of a mile to the N.E. There was no water here
when the Association ships discharged cargo. There was a strip of
table land about 50 feet above the sea level well adapted for our
purpose and I determined, if we did not find a better place at
Perseverance Inlet, to select this spot for our encampment.</p>
<p>After leaving this place Mr. Phelps complained of ill health,
and I regret to state that during the stay of the <i>Tien
Tsin</i> in the Harbor, he has been unable to take an active part
in the proceedings. It is also with sincere sorrow, that I have
to inform you of the loss I shall sustain in consequence of that
gentleman's return to head-quarters in the vessel, the climate
not permitting him to remain. His absence will necessarily impose
upon me additional responsibility. Mr. Phelps, though unable to
perform the more active duties of his profession, has not been
unemployed. He has prepared a map of that portion of the harbor
which more particularly interests ourselves, and at my request
has furnished a report, which I forward for His Excellency's
information. He also kindly consented while on board the vessel
to superintend the discharge of cargo.</p>

<p>Our visit to Perseverance Inlet was not successful. We found
neither water nor landing place and the mangrove swamps rendered
it an unhealthy situation. We subsequently discovered that we had
gone to the wrong place, to the north instead of the southward of
Mt. Lookover, the latter spot was afterwards visited and water
found in small quantities. There were too many mangroves to
permit a depôt being formed.</p>
<p>On Monday 2nd ultimo, we commenced landing stock and cargo and
after incessant exertions succeeded in completing our task on the
4th inst., every available man was employed. The work was of the
most laborious character, the heat was occasionally very
oppressive, and during the period we were visited by some heavy
squalls with rain, thunder, and lightning, such as can only occur
in tropical countries. It pained me to see the men toiling up the
rock-strewed bank, staggering under their heavy loads, but the
work had to be done, and was done, well. During the fortnight not
only were the stores, &amp;c., landed in safety, but the tents
were erected, and many of the goods properly housed. None of the
Government stores were injured.</p>
<p>Since that time we have been employed in removing the timber
from the top of the bank where it was first laid and stacking it
in the rear of the tents. The provisions have been housed as well
as the means at our disposal would permit. The tools, implements,
and stores of every description have been arranged in their
proper places; all the refuse a filth which we found on arrival
removed, the place in front of our tents thoroughly cleansed, and
every measure taken which will ensure the health and comfort of
the party. A blacksmith's shed has been erected and the horses
shod, a cooking shed has been put together, a shed for storing
such articles as could not be put into the Commissariat tent has
been constructed, a flag-staff 33 feet above the ground and
formed of quartering has been erected, and the wooden buildings
for stores and offices is now being put together.</p>
<p>I consider the spot we have chosen to present fewer
disadvantages and greater advantages than any other in the place.
It is sufficiently elevated to ensure health, it is tolerably
safe for purposes of defence, and it has by far the best landing
place I have seen. The supply of water is at present plentiful
owing to heavy rains. I have however two men sinking a well in
the rear of the tents, and hope we shall be successful, the
ground is however very hard and the work will be slow. Should we
fail I will deepen the water holes and make tanks. If that will
not do I shall send our stock to the Association encampment and
procure water from Augustus Island. If the boats will not bring
sufficient a raft must be constructed, there are plenty of
barrels lying about the beach from the "Calliance," and I have
plenty of timber. I have no fears on this score. In our position
we have the advantage of the land and sea-breezes. The latter
blows into the doors of our tents, the former, unimpeded by the
gently rising ground in the rear, passes through the openings at
the back of our tents. I should have preferred a situation nearer
to the Association encampment, but it was not to be done with
safety.</p>
<p>As regards the Association, I am sorry to observe that but few
applications for runs have been received. The total number of
acres applied for and approved is 282,500. There have been no
applications for the purchase of land nor likely to be at
present. The settlers generally do not approve of the country and
53 * of them embark on the "Tien Tsin" to-morrow, some for Nickol
Bay and some for Fremantle. The Rev. Mr. Tanner, the Chairman of
the Association, addressed a letter to me,** which I have the
honor to forward, asking among other matters whether the Governor
would permit those who have landed their stock in Camden Harbor
to transfer their right of selection to Nickol Bay. I could not
of course do more in the matter than refer the request to His
Excellency and point out that they have suffered much, many
having lost their all, including the stock they brought into the
country, and have shown themselves to be by their orderly conduct
a desirable class of settlers.</p>
<p class="foot">[* About 20 potential settlers had returned on
the <i>Stag</i> as it left Camden Harbour in December; following
the departure of the <i>Tien Tsin</i>, about twenty members
(including family) of the Association remained; <span class=
"aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Appendix 2 for this letter and Sholl's
on-the-spot reply, which he referred to the Governor;
<span class="aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>Of those who remain most of them have expressed an intention
of leaving by the first opportunity.</p>
<p>I regret that my time has been so fully occupied as to prevent
my giving an opinion of the country from personal observation;
but Mr. Phelps's illness has necessitated my remaining in camp to
see every arrangement made for housing the stores and the people,
and to make every provision for their health and safety. I have
only seen the country in the vicinity of the sea-coast, and to
that extent must confirm the opinions of those who have lived
here. The appearance of the place is very deceptive; and I do not
wonder at the description of former explorers. What seems a
grassy hill&mdash;for we have hills everywhere&mdash;at 50 or
even 30 yards distance, upon close examination becomes a mass of
rocks with grass high enough and thick enough to hide the rocks.
From the top of Mount Lookover I beheld what seemed to be a vast
extent of fertile country, but it consisted mainly of grass
covered stones. I have not been to Augustus Island but am
informed that it is rugged and thinly grassed.</p>
<p>I cannot, however, fancy that the interior is what is
represented, and as soon as the "Tien Tsin" leaves, shall form a
party to proceed to the Glenelg, and strive to find a pass
through the hills in the direction of Roebuck Bay. I presume that
the Governor will not maintain an establishment at a place which
yields no revenue, and therefore, if no ships arrive with
settlers, may expect the party to be removed. Under these
circumstances, I shall merely keep the people employed in
securing the camp from danger, and providing for the health and
comfort of all. Mr. Cowle and myself will attempt to penetrate
the country, and collect all the information we can for the
public good, nor shall we forget to look about for the site of a
town ** in some more happily situated spot than this, which if
not required now may become useful at some future period.</p>
<p class="foot">[** To be called "Elliot". See <a href=
"#Chart_3">Map 2.</a>; <span class="aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>We have all been too busy to examine the natural products of
the country or even to collect specimens at random. I may state
however that, so far as we have seen, it is lightly timbered,
that animal life is scarce, that the flowers and fruits are
neither plentiful or, with few exceptions, remarkable. It is
however a mineral country, iron in an almost pure state is
abundant, indications of copper have been found, and I believe
that richer and purer metals will yet be discovered.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the present scarcity I am convinced that it is
a well watered country, this being an exceptional season, and
that in the ordinary seasons the herbage becomes more capable of
supporting animal life.</p>
<p>The insects, especially butterflies are beautiful, in great
variety and in large numbers.</p>
<p>The harbor teems with fish and the rocks are covered with
oysters of excellent quality.</p>
<p>I have not seen a place suitable for gardening purposes, and
the settlers who have sown seeds of every description have not
obtained any return.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I must express my satisfaction at the general
conduct of those committed to my care.</p>
<p>Of Mr. Cowle I have seen but little, his duties obliging him
to be much with his senior officer, Mr. Phelps, who has remained
on board the "Tien Tsin." Upon the departure of that vessel I
shall nominate Mr. Cowle second in command, until the Governor's
pleasure is known.</p>
<p>Assistant Storekeeper Chamberlain is a very careful and
diligent officer. He took charge of the sheep during the voyage,
and, great as was the mortality, it would have been greater but
for his care and vigilance.</p>
<p>Sergeant Aherne maintains discipline among the pensioners, who
are regular in the performance of their military duties. Daily
parades are held, and a guard is placed every night.</p>
<p>Corporal Benson has been of signal service to me. He has acted
as a kind of foreman of works; keeps, issues, and accounts for
the tools and implements, and is useful in every capacity in
which he is employed. The police under his command have proved
themselves well-conducted and industrious.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding their grievous disappointment, the whole of
the men are cheerful and in good spirits. Knowing that although
from circumstances beyond their control there is no prospect of
the immediate advancement of this district, and consequently of
themselves, the Government of the colony will not be unmindful of
men who perform their duty amidst discomforts, difficulties, and
dangers.</p>

<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;"><i>Government
Resident's Office,<br>
Port Camden</i>,<br>
20th <i>May</i>, 1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honor to inform
you that the <i>Jeanie Oswald</i>, of Melbourne, arrived at this
port on the 10th instant, with 5 cabin passengers, 40 horses, 60
sheep, 2 cows, some dogs, goats, and poultry.</p>
<p>Of the passengers, three proceed to Sourabaya with the vessel,
and all the stock, except one mare.</p>
<p>The vessel will sail, I am informed, to-morrow morning, and by
her I shall forward a small mail.</p>
<p>His Excellency the Governor will be glad to hear that since
the departure of the <i>Tien Tsin</i> on the 20th March, the
general health of the Camp has been good; I, however, regret to
report one death, the native constable Jimba having died from
disease of the lungs on the 17th instant. He was buried at Sheep
Island on the following day. He had been ailing for some time,
and his death was long expected. It appears that he was thrown
from a horse some time ago and received a blow on the left
breast, causing serious injury at the time; subsequently, while a
prisoner at Rottnest, he received a blow in the same part of his
body, and was again very ill. During the early days of our stay
in this place he complained of cough, which was treated with
simple remedies, but the disease assumed a more aggravated form,
and after enduring much agony, he expired. The other members of
our party have had excellent health. We have not had a case of
fever, slight diarrhæa, coughs, and ophthalmia, of a very mild
type, being the only complaints. The festering sores, boils,
&amp;c., of which I took note in my letter of 17th March,
disappeared upon the approach of cooler weather. The case of the
pensioner referred to in my former letter has resulted favorably,
thanks to Mr. Chamberlain's incessant attention. Mortification
took place, and it was necessary to remove a large piece of dead
flesh. The wound is now nearly healed, and the patient able to
move about with the aid of crutches. Taking into consideration
the heat of the climate and the nature of the food we, as a
matter of course, have to consume, the result is as surprising as
satisfactory.</p>
<p>In the Camp occupied by the members of the late Camden Harbor
Association (for it no longer exists, the property having been
equally divided) there has been more sickness, febrile diseases,
as might be expected from the situation, being prevalent. I
regret to state that Mr. Meaden, one of the principal members of
the late Association, yesterday fell a victim to fever of a
typhoid character, after a few days' illness.&mdash;He was buried
at the Association Camp yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., having
died on the morning of the same day, at 6 a.m.</p>
<p>My chief source of anxiety, and my first care, after the
departure of the <i>Tien Tsin</i>, was the supply of water. In my
letter of the 17th March, I stated that we were sinking a well at
the Camp, and that should that fail, I would deepen the
water-holes and form tanks, while, as a <i>dernier</i> resort, a
raft would be constructed, and water brought from Augustus
Island. As early as the 22nd March it became apparent that unless
we had a heavy fall of rain, our water-holes would not supply the
party for more than a fortnight or three weeks. Finding that no
rain had fallen up to the 28th of the month, and that the sinking
of the well through almost solid rock was too slow a process,
with our indifferent boring tools, I had the work suspended,
after the men had got down about 12 feet, and set a party to work
at the base of the hill some 50 yards in the rear of the
water-holes, and where, in the cavity of the rocks, there was
some water apparently supplied by a spring. A very few days' work
convinced me that we should obtain a good supply of water, but in
the mean time casks were collected, and a raft could have been
framed in a few hours. The well, or rather cistern&mdash;for it
was not deeper than 6 feet, and about the same length and
breadth&mdash;was completed on the 13th of April, the last mass
of rock having been blasted on the previous day. Three days
elapsed before it was full, and since that time, though our daily
consumption exceeds 200 gallons&mdash;the stock can get water a
short distance from the camp&mdash;it is overflowing each
morning. The water is of excellent quality. The well has been
roughly roofed over, and a stone wall placed round it to keep
away horses and dogs. Since the arrival of the <i>Jeanie
Oswald</i>, we have supplied her with sufficient water for daily
consumption and she has 26 horses on board. An attempt was made
to water the ship for consumption on her voyage, but the removal
of 800 gallons in one day so reduced our quantity, that I had to
stop the supply and limit the quantity to four hogsheads one day
and two the next. They get the remainder from Augustus
Island.</p>
<p>We have had no intercourse with the natives at our camp, but
they have visited us without our knowledge, and certainly without
consent. On the morning, of the 23rd March, a boat, the property
of Assistant Surveyor Cowle, was reported missing. It was found
that the rope by which she was moored was cut through by
apparently a sharper instrument than we supposed the natives to
possess. We did not suspect them, but thought it was done by some
white man. Every enquiry was made, but no clue could be obtained.
The sentry stated that he thought he heard the clash of oars in
the distance at about 12 or 1 o'clock on that night, and in the
direction of another encampment. The Government boat was sent to
Augustus Island, Mr. T. C. Sholl * being in charge. He was
directed to examine the various inlets and mangrove creeks, in
case the boat might have been concealed in that direction. He
reported, on his return, that he proceeded through Rogers'
Straits, where the current was so strong that, notwithstanding a
fair breeze of moderate strength, and three oars out, it was as
much as they could do to hold their own until the tide changed.
Landing at the watering place on Augustus Island they went up the
ravine through which the stream passes, and halted to light a
fire and make tea. They were disturbed by a large stone crashing
among the trees and which had been thrown from the height above
them. At the same time the natives commenced to cooee in all
directions. They went towards the boat and shouted in reply, when
some eight or nine natives appeared on the crest of the hill; one
of them braver than the rest, came down, a fine looking man about
6 feet high, black as ebony, and with a skin that shone in the
sun. He was armed with a spear and a club. His hair was dressed
differently from the others, and he seemed to be one in
authority. He came forward with friendly tones and gestures. They
were in the boat at this time, and brought it towards the shore,
but when they did this the native retreated, but leisurely, not
in fear. The boat party threw him some odds and ends, which were
in the boat, and also a piece of damper, which he picked up as
the boat put off. Thinking this would be a good opportunity to
open communication with the natives, I proceeded the next day to
the spot. As we came close to the Island and shouted, the natives
responded, but when we landed they would neither answer us, nor
could we see them. After being on shore about an hour, I had a
small looking-glass and other presents tied to the mangroves, and
went away. As we were going off we saw two or three on the top of
the hill (about 100 feet almost precipitous), one of whom was
seated on a rock, as motionless as if he were a bit of carved
marble. We cooeed but they did not reply until we were fairly
off, and then the whole Island seemed alive, shouts near and
distant being heard in all directions. Three times since then
have I attempted to meet with them, but that was the only
opportunity I have had of ever seeing an aboriginal inhabitant of
North West Australia. Some of the settlers, however, saw the
looking-glass in the possession of one of them; so the presents
reached their intended destination.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The author's son, Trevarton Charles ("Trevy")
Sholl; <span class="aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>On the night of the 30th March the sentry woke me, saying that
the Government boat was moving from her moorings, and asked
whether he should fire. At first I refused permission, but seeing
the boat drifting away, and knowing how essential it was to us,
especially at this time when, our supply of water was failing as
it was possible we might have to depend upon it for towing the
water-raft from Augustus Island, I, with regret, gave the order
to fire. Several rounds were fired by the guard; something was
seen to go through the water to a point of land some fifty yards
from where the boat then was, and the boat itself ceased to move.
We attempted to haul in the surf-boat, but this was a work of
time, one of the ropes having been cut, and it was necessary to
swim out to her. I sent Corporal Benson in the surf-boat to
recover the pinnace, and when she was brought back sent Benson to
the Settlers' Camp, while I went to examine the neighboring
creek. Neither party were successful in ascertaining what persons
had attempted the act, nor in what manner they had done so. The
next morning, however, the native constable Billy reported that
he had seen the tracks of many natives round the Camp, and he
showed where two parties had gone along the beach. One towards
the dingy, and the other towards the pinnace. We had nearly lost
both boats, and had the dingy been moored out in the ordinary
manner, she must have gone, but the double rope saved her. This
as well as the chain and anchor of the pinnace, was beyond their
calculation. They had evidently, finding that the chain could not
be cut through, walked under the water, carrying the anchor, and
occasionally rising to the surface to get air, for their tracks
were plain, and the tide was too high to allow of their heads
being above water. The anchor was down when the boat was
recovered, and there was no appearance of any one having got
inside the boat. Everything had been arranged carefully and
noiselessly, and great credit is due to the
sentry&mdash;Dunlop&mdash;for his vigilance on the occasion, as
the night was dark and the movement of the boat could have been
scarcely perceptible.</p>
<p>There could now be no doubt what had become of Mr. Cowle's
boat; so immediately after breakfast I despatched the pinnace on
a three days' cruise among the islands, placing Mr. Cowle in
charge, and sending with him P.C. Gee, the native assistant
Billy, and two hands.</p>
<p>On the night of the 3rd April Mr. Cowle returned with the
missing boat. He had proceeded through Rogers' Straits, out at
the entrance of Port George the Fourth, in again by the heads of
Brecknock Harbor, and it was while coasting along the south shore
of Augustus Island; and while in the strait dividing that island
from Brecknock Island, that he saw and recovered his boat. About
a mile above the watering place he saw a native, who, making
signs that the party must not fire, came to the boat and stood
about twenty yards off. He was unarmed, Billy landed and shook
hands with him, and the native seemed much gratified and amused
with Billy's appearance. He laughed vociferously, took off
Billy's cap, felt his body and limbs, pulled his hair and beard,
and looked into his mouth, carefully examining his teeth. In
reply to signs respecting the missing boat he pointed in the
direction to which they were going, or in the direction of the
camp. Leaving the native, they passed the watering place, and
about a mile to the S.E. saw the boat paddled by natives. They
gave chase and got what they were looking for among some
mangroves, the natives jumping out with such expedition, that
they left their paddles and some headless spears behind them. The
spear-heads&mdash;arrow-shafted, and made of quartz, and
glass&mdash;were not found for some time after. The spears were
clumsy and heavy; the paddles were made of light wood, and,
taking into consideration the tools at the disposal of the
natives, not badly made. The boat was uninjured. They did not
appreciate the value of the rudder, and converted it into another
seat, having <i>nailed</i> it (they had stolen nails among other
articles from the people who landed from the <i>Stag</i>) to two
thwarts. When the party went off with the boat native coo'ees
were heard far and near. During the night of the 21st April a
boat was stolen from a person named Anderson, who is living near
the <i>Calliance</i> wreck. That boat has not yet been recovered.
It was seen by a watering party from the <i>Jeanie Oswald</i> on
the 19th instant near Augustus Island. Some natives were on
board, using paddles. Encumbered by their water casks, the
sailors could not go in chase. Directly I heard the news I
despatched Corporal Benson in the dingy, desiring him to anchor
during the night, and make search at daylight. He returned the
next day, after a fruitless hunt. The owner of the boat went with
him and two other men.</p>
<p>When I last had the honor of addressing you, I stated my
intention, soon after the departure of the <i>Tien Tsin</i>, of
striving to penetrate the country South of the Glenelg and in the
direction of Roebuck Bay. Until I was certain of the safety of
the camp, and satisfied that there would be no failure of the
water supply, I could not leave, but these matters being
satisfactorily settled, I made arrangements for our departure,
and left on the 10th April.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The full journal of this expedition is found
in Appendix 3; <span class="aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>Our party consisted of Mr. Assistant Surveyor Cowle, who
accompanied us for the purpose of defining our position, so that
our course might be laid down correctly on the general maps; P.C.
Jackaman, native constable Billy, Chainer Graham. We had 5 saddle
and 3 pack-horses. Messrs. McRae, Hindhaugh, and Hick, three of
the settlers, accompanied us, with 3 saddle and one pack-horse.
The party were all well armed, and we took provisions for one
month, though it was not my intention to remain out more than
three weeks, unless unforseen delays should occur.</p>
<p>We took a south easterly direction to the Glenelg, which we
reached on the 12th April. About half a mile south of this river
I formed my first depôt, and from thence, with lightly-equipped
parties, we attempted to force our way through the sandstone
ranges. On the 31st we crossed the eastern end of the Whately
Range, and tried all day to get south, but after passing over
some of the roughest country I had ever seen, and following every
valley which appeared practicable, we were unable to make more
than 3 or 4 miles due South, and returned to depôt, satisfied
that nothing could be done in that direction.</p>

<p>On the 14th we started with fresh horses, the others having
received many cuts and bruises among the sandstone, and passed
round the western end of the Whately Range, and after toiling
through country of a description similar to that passed over on
the preceding day, got upon a small tract of sandy table-land and
were able to pursue our course. After an hour's tramp, we came to
a river, flowing towards the Glenelg, with rocky cliffs on either
side. From bank to bank the distance was 82 yards, but the actual
stream of water did not exceed in width 15 or 20 yards. This
river I propose, with His Excellency's permission, to name the
McRae, after one at the gentlemen who accompanied us, and whose
services were of much value to the expedition. One of the horses
not being in a condition to travel, we had to return, not having
got further than four miles direct south of the depôt, but with
every prospect of being able to follow our course. The two days'
journey satisfied us that we were situated on a rocky peninsula,
from which we could not get clear, without recrossing the
Glenelg, except by proceeding to the southward and westward.</p>
<p>Resting on Saturday, the 15th, and Sunday, the 16th April, we
started on the 17th, with three days provisions, and finding an
easier pass through the Whately Range to the westward of a
detached hill at the eastern point, we passed over more
practicable country than before, but one of the horses losing a
shoe, it became necessary to halt at a spot about a quarter of a
mile from our furthest on Friday. The horse was sent back to
depôt and shod, but Billy could not return with it until night;
so we were forced to remain until the 18th.</p>
<p>On this day we steered a course generally to the westward of
south, following up the McRae River, which we crossed and
recrossed several times. This river was rock-bound, and it was to
avoid the hills, some of them precipitous, that we were compelled
to cross so frequently. We camped at night near the source of the
McRae, in Latitude 16 deg. south and about 19 miles from our
depôt. Much of the country passed over was rugged but there were
occasional patches of table-land. I determined to remove my depôt
to within a mile or two of this place, and on the 19th we
retraced our steps, arriving in Camp at sundown.</p>
<p>Rested the horses on the 20th, and on the 21st the whole party
moved on and camped at night on the right bank of the McRae. Our
horses are continually losing their shoes, and our supply of
nails being limited, our travels must soon be at an end. Messrs.
McRae and Hindhaugh, the only shoers in the party, were kept
constantly employed.</p>
<p>On the 22nd we formed depôt No. 2. On the 23rd (Sunday) we
rested. Started on the 24th, and passing our camps of the 18th,
began to descend the range. At the highest point we ascended a
hill, and looking south, saw that there were three ranges in our
course, the highest being about 25 miles distant, and the lowest
5 miles. A hill which we then took to be the Red Conical Hill,
near Doubtful Bay, was seen about 9 miles away, bearing W. by N.;
Mt. Lyell, E. by N. half N., 20 miles; Mt. Double Cone, N.W. by
N., 25 miles. Followed a rivulet trending south for about 2
miles, when our further progress was stopped by impassable rocks.
Mr. Hindhaugh, reported, after going ahead on foot, that the
stream was joined up a larger one, and that the united waters ran
to the westward. We returned towards the depôt, intending to take
a westerly course from that point, and afterwards get southing;
but on our way the last horse-shoe-nail was expended, and as we
were losing on an average a shoe a day, and a shoeless horse in
these ranges being equal to an unserviceable if not a lost horse,
I determined, with much regret, to return to camp. We accordingly
retraced our steps and arrived at Camden Harbor on the 27th,
losing three more shoes <i>en route</i>.</p>
<p>I will forward my journal * by the first opportunity, and you
will be better able to judge of the country passed over by
reading the details of our daily work than from the necessarily
brief account which I now give.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Here Appendix 3; <span class=
"aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>I may state, generally, that from Camden Harbor to the Glenelg
the country, after passing over a few stony hills in the
immediate vicinity of our camp, is undulating, with stony
gravelly, and sometimes rocky soil. On the borders of the
numerous streams there is alluvial land. There is grass
everywhere and of every description, upon the hills, in the
vallies, and even upon the top of the sandstone ranges. I saw
very little spinifex, and then only among the otherwise bare
rocks on the summits of the highest hills south of the Glenelg.
We passed through the Hampton Downs, which are all they have been
represented. Much of the grass in these downs is kangaroo grass,
and it is generally of a great height and a thick sward. There is
no undergrowth of brushwood&mdash;nothing but grass-good, bad or
indifferent&mdash;there it is. I never travelled through so much
grass in Western Australia as I have seen between this place and
the Glenelg.</p>
<p>The whole of the country north or south of the Glenelg is
lightly timbered. None of the trees, except the baobab&mdash;and
they are few and far between&mdash;are of any girth&mdash;the
largest white gums not exceeding 18 inches diameter. The trees
consist principally of eucalyptus (several varieties,) cajeput,
cotton tree, cork tree, banksia (south of the Glenelg,) box, and
among the ranges, several fruit trees, which I cannot now
describe. I can only say that the flavor of most of the fruits
was abominable. We saw a few pines among the sandstones, but they
were of slight girth. There were few trees fitted for any other
purpose than firewood, and most of the timber for building and
even for fencing will have to be imported.</p>
<p>The country was well watered; creeks and rivulets every two or
three miles, and most of them with running water. We had no rain
during the time we were out, and there was consequently a marked
difference between the appearance of the streams on our outward
and homeward journies.</p>
<p>There were no indications of gold on our route, except at a
spot 5 miles from this, where it was remarked that the country
very much resembled Creswick, in Victoria, by two persons who had
been there. It was undulating country, covered with broken quartz
and ironstone gravel.</p>
<p>It was delightfully cool, especially while we were in the
sandstone ranges. Our greatest elevation was about 3,000 feet
above the sea level. From the time we left the Glenelg until we
commenced descending the ranges on the 24th. April, we were going
up hill, though gradually and imperceptibly, on the table land.
We were much troubled by mosquitoes at all our halting places
north of the Glenelg and at our first depôt, but there were none
when we commenced ascending the hills. We were, however, troubled
by kangaroo-ticks in the ranges, which tormented both man and
beast.</p>
<p>Game was very scarce; at least we did not see much, although
there were plenty of tracks, especially of kangaroo and emus. One
kangaroo, seven ducks, and a few cockatoos, were all we procured,
though several of our party went out for the purpose of hunting.
On the Glenelg some fish were caught, but they were tasteless,
and the skin was so tough, that they were named "leather
jackets."</p>
<p>We did not see a native fire or track, or any indication
whatever that they were in the neighborhood, or had been there
recently.</p>
<p>As far as we went there was feed in abundance, as well as
water, and should a fertile plain country be found southward of
the ranges, there is no impediment to the driving of stock
overland. With a little labor a practicable route for carts might
be made to the Glenelg, but south of our first depôt nothing on
wheels could traverse.</p>
<p>Upon my return I was glad to find that every thing had gone on
well at the camp. The wooden storehouse had been finished and
occupied; a small piece of land had been fenced, cleared, and dug
for a garden; seeds of every description had been sown, and many
of them had germinated, the plants looking very healthy; the well
had been completed, and was overflowing; the boats had been
hauled up, repaired and painted; the ovens and fireplaces (made
of basalt, with pug cement) had been commenced, and the bushes
around the camp thoroughly cleared off, and all rubbish which had
been accumulating at the rear removed. I was much satisfied with
the management of the camp and the conduct of all in it during my
absence.</p>

<p>At 10 a.m. on the morning after our return we received a visit
from the Malays. Seven proas * entered the harbor through Rogers'
Straits, and there were about thirty canoes skimming over the
water. They made towards our camp. I knew at once they were
trepang fishers, but having been warned that they occasionally do
a little piracy, robbery, &amp;c., I thought it advisable to make
a demonstration of strength, and at all events be prepared for
any emergency. Every man in the camp was ordered under arms, and
the pensioners posted among the rocks at the landing-place and
well under cover. I sent off the native Billy on horseback with a
note to Mr. Patterson, one of the settlers, telling him to have
the people at Association Camp under arms, and, if necessary,
come to our camp for mutual assistance and protection. He came
during the day, and said it would be inconvenient for them to
move, but they required a few men as a protective force; I,
however, declined to weaken my camp. As the proas approached the
Union Jack was hoisted, and our camp looked gay and bustling.
Five of the proas drew up in line to the N.W., about 5 miles off;
one of the others remained near Sheep Island, and the seventh
anchored opposite the camp. Being anxious to know what they had
on board, and especially to find out if they had any cannon, I
went an board the prao * nearest to us. As we were starting a
canoe came towards shore, with five men; they were unarmed but, I
did not care about allowing them to land and spy out our
weakness, until I had first seen what they had on board. Went off
with my son, P.C. Gee, and Tompkinson, McLeod, and Coffee a
volunteer crew. As we neared the prao I saw a small Dutch flag.
It was placed on a bamboo, and the bamboo stuck into the thatched
deck. We got a rope, after making signs that it was required, and
were hauled astern. Getting alongside was a matter of difficulty,
as bamboos projected in every direction. I went through a hole
like a small window in the quarter, followed by my son and
another, and we found ourselves in a den under the
deck&mdash;overhead there was a thatch made of reeds and here
there were about twenty malays squatted down. The men and cabin
were dirty, and the smell offensive. We seated ourselves like the
malays, and attempted to make ourselves understood by signs, for
none of them spoke English. One, who seemed to be the Captain,
produced from a bamboo case a piece of paper, written, not
printed. It was evidently a clearance in the Dutch language. It
had been signed at three distinct dates, August and December,
1864, and January 1865. It had an official stamp, with
"Maccassar" round the rim. I had not my note-book with me, or I
should have made a copy of the document, and my endeavors to
induce the Captain to come ashore were unavailing. In this den
there were only three old flint musquets, and I did not even see
a knife. My son, while we were engaged in the cabin, went over
the vessel, saw another flint musquet in tolerable order, and two
or three rusty cannon, of small callibre. I was therefore
satisfied, so far as this prao was concerned, that no mischief
could be done. I shook hands with the captain, and pointed to the
boat's ensign, trying to show that we were friends. We gave them
a little tobacco which we had with us, and my son gave the
captain a pen knife, but without the desired effect, for no
sooner had we left the vessel than they lifted the
anchor&mdash;made of wood, with a stone for a sinker, and with a
cane cable,&mdash;and hoisted their sail (a large mat
apparently), and went toward the entrance of the harbor. As I did
not know what the other praos contained, and there were upwards
of 300 men in the canoes and praos, I deemed it prudent during
the time they remained, to have a watch every night; so I divided
the camp into parties of seven and eight, and posted sentries
round the camp. The watches were relieved every two hours, and
every half hour each sentry called his number and "All's well."
This did not continue many nights, for two praos left the
following day, two more on the next day, and on the third day the
remaining three took their departure.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Variously spelled <i>proa, prao, prau,
prahu</i>. The two spellings used are retained here; <span class=
"aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>They did not fish much while they were here, and came to blows
with the natives, who drove them away from the watering place. I
am told they are in the habit of stealing the natives. A Malay
boy on board the <i>Jeanie Oswald</i> has seen several of these
North Australians as slaves among the Islands. Some of the Malays
landed at the Calliance wreck, and bartered cocoanuts for blocks,
rope, &amp;c.</p>
<p>It was my intention to have gone to the Glenelg, but the
arrival of the Malays, followed so closely by that of the
<i>Jeanie Oswald</i>, together, (judging from the Melbourne
papers,) with the possible arrival of a ship or ships on account
of the Denison Plains company, warned me that I must not be away
long from camp. So I shall send my son in charge of a small
party, desiring him to follow the course which we should have
pursued, had we not been compelled to return. Mr. McRae, and
probably other settlers, will accompany the party.</p>
<p>I fear there is not much prospect of settling this place from
seaward, for although the country between this and the Glenelg is
first class, yet the large 100,000 acre blocks absorb the greater
portion, and unless land of the best description is at hand, or
parties are satisfied that there is pastoral land to the
southward of the ranges, I do not expect any one will remain.
Still, in the event of immigration, and in anticipation of the
ultimate settlement of the country by the extension of pastoral
runs from the Southern Settlements, I have fixed upon a spot for
the future town of Elliot.</p>
<p>I made a more careful examination of the country round the
camp of the <i>Calliance</i> seamen than I was able to do when I
visited it with Mr. Phelps. My success in obtaining water at our
own camp made me confident that in the lower land at Calliance
Camp I should have no difficulty. Accordingly, after a very
slight search, I found water in the immediate vicinity, and am
certain at the depth of ten or twelve feet from the surface it
can be obtained anywhere on the proposed townsite. The landing is
not so good as our own, and a ship could not anchor so near
shore, but there the landing is better than any other (except
this), and is not bad, while ships of large tonnage could lie
much nearer than at Fremantle. Some of the ground is fitted for
gardens; there is plenty of stone adapted for building (no
limestone there or in fact anywhere), and an outlet is afforded
to the back country. Near the shore it is rocky, including the
portion I saw with Mr. Phelps, but in a S.E. direction the land
first becomes strong, and afterwards gravelly, with patches of
red loam. The place is open to the prevailing winds, and, in the
direction I have named, free from mangrove swamps. I will have
the outer boundaries defined as soon as possible, leaving its
subdivision into allotments until there is some prospect of a
demand. Mr. Cowle will set about this work as soon as he has
completed the survey of the harbor, upon which work he is at
present engaged.</p>
<p>The boundary of our camp has been marked, and the trees
impeding a look-out seaward have been cut down. The mason is
employed making ovens and fireplaces, and the carpenter in
erecting a shed to work under. The landing place is in course of
improvement, so as to admit of a cart being employed.</p>
<p>Our garden is looking very well, most of the seeds having
yielded plants, which seem healthy, especially the melon
tribe.</p>
<p>Nothing more has been done by the Association people, and
could they have made terms with the master of the <i>Jeanie
Oswald</i>. I have no doubt that the whole of them would have
left Camden Harbor.</p>
<p>We have not had much rain; the weather has been cooler, and
the climate more endurable; but the generally slight difference
of temperature, night and day, is a drawback. The thermometer has
ranged as high as 106 in my tent; once it was as low as 71; the
average for the past month has been about 85. However, whatever
the thermometer may indicate, one thing is certain that we enjoy
good healths Except in the neighbourhood of Mangroves, I believe
every spot is healthy even inland. I saw no tropical vegetation
during my journey, the porous soil and shadeless trees of
Australia are of no small value in a sanitary point of view.</p>
<p>I cannot speak too highly of the general conduct of those
placed under my orders. I have very seldom to censure, and have
only once had to inflict any punishment. Good order and good
discipline prevail and the ground around the camp is kept as trim
as a barrack-yard.</p>
<p>Before I conclude, I may as well state that our few sheep,
though healthy, do not gain flesh, but the contrary. They now run
forty to fifty pounds. The horses are in good condition.</p>
<p>Captain Devine, of the <i>Jeanie Oswald</i>, informs me that
he considers the harbor the finest he has ever visited, and
pronounces the holding ground to be good.</p>

<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;"><i>Government

Camden Harbor, June</i> 2, 1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;I wrote by the <i>Jeanie
Oswald</i>, which vessel sailed for Sourabaya on the 25th
ultimo.</p>
<p>I beg to enclose copy of that letter, and of tabular returns
of receipts and expenditure, were forwarded per <i>Jeanie
Oswald</i>. The necessary vouchers will be sent by a more safe
mode of conveyance than the present&mdash;an open boat from Adam
Bay,* and bound for Fremantle.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Adam Bay is situated about 50km N.E. of Darwin
(N.T.). A settlement was attempted here in 1864 under Col.
Finniss. It was abandoned in 1865; <span class=
"aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>This boat&mdash;The <i>Forlorn Hope</i>&mdash;arrived at
Camden Harbor on the 29th ultimo, having left Adam Bay on the 7th
ult. She is schooner rigged, 24 feet long, 5 feet beam, and a
good sea boat. There were seven passengers: Mr. Stow, (one of the
settlers, brother of the late Attorney-General for South
Australia, and a Magistrate of that Colony,) Messrs. Hamilton and
McMinn, Surveyors, and four laborers. They had a fine passage, so
far as weather was concerned, but got upon the reefs near Cape
Bougainville, when they broke their rudder, but happily did not
otherwise damage the boat. The supply of provisions was
practically exhausted the day before their arrival, for although,
after landing, they discovered two tins of meat in the boat, they
were not previously aware of the fact, and had nothing to eat,
except a little maienza.</p>
<p>I proffered to Mr. Stow and his two companions the rough
accommodation of my tent, which they were good enough to accept,
and ordered the Storekeeper to issue rations to the men during
their stay in harbor.</p>
<p>They were without charts, and I spared copies of such as I
have in duplicate, while Mr. McMinn took tracings of others.</p>
<p>A rudder, to replace that which was broken, a heavier anchor
than the one they brought with them, and a binnacle lamp, were
made in our camp.</p>
<p>I therefore hope they will arrive safely, but at this season
of the year the voyage is as hazardous as it is plucky.</p>
<p>There being no Custom House at Adam Bay, Mr. Stow did not
bring a clearance. He will, however, take one from this
place.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton took some photographic sketches of the camp,
which are very good, taking into consideration all
disadvantageous circumstances. I do not send copies, because I
fear that the mail-bag may become wet during the passage. Mr.
Hamilton will, however, I have no doubt, be willing to furnish
you with copies.</p>
<p>They speak in disparaging terms of the management of the
settlement at Adam Bay and of the choice of site. It is a matter
respecting which I am not qualified, nor am I required to give an
opinion. That these gentlemen are dissatisfied, is proved by
their undertaking so long a passage in an open boat.</p>
<p>His Excellency will be glad to hear that the general health of
this camp is good, and that the conduct of every one in it meets
with my entire approbation.</p>
<p>We celebrated the Queen's Birthday as well as our means would
allow. A small sum was raised, and prizes given for boat racing,
leaping, running, &amp;c. The pensioners were paraded, and
instead of the usual <i>feu de joie</i>&mdash;for we could not
expend powder, gave three cheers for the Queen, and one for His
Excellency the Governor. The settlers from the Association Camp
joined in the sports, and the day passed off very cheerfully.</p>
<p>Mr. Assistant Surveyor Cowle and myself rode to the proposed
townsite, and the former gentleman fixed upon the line which is
to form the western boundary. The site will be defined as soon as
the survey of the harbor is completed, which will be in the
course of a few days.</p>
<p>I stated in my letters of 20th ult. that I should send a small
party south of the Glenelg to explore in a southerly direction
from my second depot. The party will start on Monday, 5th
instant, and consist of Mr. T. C. Sholl, P.C. Gee, John Stainer,
and the native constable Billy. Mr. McRae, a gentleman who
accompanied our former expedition, will be one of the party. He
is a thorough bushman, and will be a valuable addition to the
explorers.</p>
<p>Desiring to have the country explored between Camden Harbor
and Doubtful Bay, I have requested Mr. Cowle to command a lightly
equipped party in that direction.* He will cross the Glenelg at
the lower rapids, and proceed as far as the Red Cone Hill, near
the south-eastern shore of Doubtful Bay. Should he be successful,
we shall have a correct notion of the country between Grey's
eastern track and the sea-coast. Our furthest was rather further
south than Grey's, our position being lat. 16.2, long. 124.55.
The Red Cone Hill is still further south, and if neither of the
parties about to explore do not get something beyond the points
attained by their predecessors, it will prove that the ranges are
difficult to penetrate, to say the least.</p>
<p class="foot">[* If one looks closely at the <a href=
"#sholl">Sholl Expedition map</a>, the limits of Cowle's
explorations can be seen as a dark dashed line ending just S.W.
of the Whately Range; <span class="aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>Mr. Cowle will not start until he has completed his surveys,
or about the 17th inst. The party will consist of himself and
three of the survey men.</p>
<p>The supply of water in the well not being so great as
formerly, I have set some men to work, sinking in the vicinity.
They struck a spring immediately under the surface, and the water
is running in strong. I have no misgivings, and believe we shall
have plenty of water for several months, if not until the end of
the dry season.</p>
<p>Our garden is not flourishing, the continued dry weather
having affected the plants. We have not had rain lor several
weeks, and when I found the water sinking in the well, I would
not allow any to be taken for the garden until the new well was
completed. Pig-melon, pumpkins, and cotton look the most
healthy&mdash;the other melons are dried up; French beans are in
flower but look yellow; potatoes grow up with long thin stalks,
and will not come to perfection.</p>
<p>The carpenters' shop is nearly completed, and the
landing-place has been much improved. The ovens and fire-places
have also been completed.</p>
<p>I have no additional information with respect to the settlers.
There has been one birth (the first in Camden Harbor) since I
wrote to you Mrs. Pascoe, the wife of one of the settlers, having
been delivered of a son on the 29th ult.</p>
<p>The weather has of late been very pleasant, and the nights are
cooler than they have been since our arrival. The following is a
register of temperature since the 20th ult:&mdash;</p>

<p>Where there are blanks the register was not taken; I was

<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">Government
Resident's Office,<br>
Camden Harbour, July 11, 1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;I beg to forward for the
information of His Excellency the Governor the undermentioned
documents, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>Copy of my letter of instructions to Mr. T. C. Sholl * with
respect to the conduct of an expedition southward of the Glenelg,
and</p>
<p>Report from Mr. T. C. Sholl,* of his proceedings and that of
his party on the occasion referred to.</p>
<p>There is also a rough tracing of the course pursued.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* All items are found in Appendix 5;
<span class="aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>It appeared to me that an opening would be found to the
westward of south, Mr. McRae having informed me that the country
seemed likely in that direction; of course the great object was
to make southing, and whether this object was attained by
diverging in the first instance a little to the East or West is
not a matter of moment. This divergence of route was the only
departure from the letter of my instructions, and as success
attended this departure it would seem that the change was
judicious.</p>
<p>You will perceive that owing to an accident&mdash;the straying
of their horses&mdash;Messrs. Sholl and McRae were enabled to
ascend Mount Lyell. I am glad they did so, as there appears to be
some doubt as to which of the hills in the neighbourhood is Mount
Lyell,&mdash;the Mount Lyell of Grey&mdash;they having been
described so variously, but I think this visit decides the
matter, for the description tallies in all important particulars
with that of Sir George Grey. I thought at one time that "the
remarkable pointed hill to the North of the Upper Rapids of the
Glenelg" was Mount Lyell; and it certainly is the highest as well
as the most prominent hill in the country, and it is strange that
it has not been named by Grey and others. From its point the
waters of the Prince Regent's and Glenelg Rivers can be seen,
which is not the case with Mount Lyell, according to the Report
which I now forward, nor according to the testimony of others who
have given me verbal information on the subject.</p>
<p>The expedition started on the 9th from our second depôt, and
must have had easy travelling country, for they proceeded S.S.E.
for a distance of 21 miles, and returned one mile on their tracks
in one day. A river named the Sale was discovered during this
day's march, and to the banks of that River the depôt was
removed.</p>
<p>On the 13th June Messrs. Sholl and McRae pursued a coarse
first E.S.E. for five miles to a hill named Mount Alexander,
thence southerly for 5 miles, when they struck a river 100 yards
wide, flowing in a north-westerly direction, which was named the
Berckelman. They followed the course of this river for 3½ miles,
and striking a N.N.E. course for six miles, arrived in depôt. The
course throughout the day enabled them to travel over and at
several points a tract of superior pastoral country, which Mr.
Sholl named the Panter Downs. The depôt was then removed to the
southern bank of the Berckelman near the junction with the
Sale.</p>
<p>On the 15th June a southerly course of 4 miles to a hill named
Mount Hindhaugh was taken, thence S.W. for 6 miles as far as a
river named the Middleton, whose course was in the direction of
the Berckelman. That course was followed, and the explorers
returned to depôt by a circuitous route.</p>
<p>On the 16th the depôt was removed to the Middleton by a
somewhat straighter route than was pursued on the previous day,
Mount Hindhaugh being left a mile or two to the eastward.</p>
<p>On the 17th a march was made generally in a S.E. direction
over high ranges named the Harding Range. The extreme point of
the explorers was at a peak named Peak Edward, from whence they
saw a large river flowing to the south-westward. Returning to
depôt, they started again on</p>
<p>Monday, 19th June. Followed their tracks of Saturday until
within a short distance of Peak Edward, when they struck at a
distance of 10 miles a large tidal river named the Walcott, a ¼
of a mile wide, with a rise and fall of 15 feet. They returned
some 5 miles on their tracks, and camped for the night at a
stream designated Pigeon Creek. South of the Walcott the course
of another large river was seen.</p>
<p>On the 20th they reached depôt, and, retracing their steps,
arrived in camp, all well, on the 26th of June.</p>
<p>The country passed over was tolerably well grassed,
independent of the rich pastoral lands in "Panter Downs," and
fair feeding lands on the Walcott.</p>
<p>Of the rivers discovered, two&mdash;the Sale and the
Middleton&mdash;were tributaries of the Berckelman, which river
flowed towards the coast in the direction of Secure Bay. The
point of debouchement of the Walcott is conjectured to be Stokes'
Bay.</p>
<p>Future explorers will have to take a more easterly course from
Mount Alexander, so as to be enabled to cross the Walcott.</p>
<p>Awaiting communications from Head Quarters, I do not think it
prudent to send out another party for any lengthened period,
though I am sanguine of the result, and much regret that we
cannot take advantage of this, the best season, for
exploration.</p>
<p>I have, however, determined to send out small parties for a
limited period to explore the country nearer our camp, and on the
10th instant despatched Mr. Cowle, with Jackerman, Paterson, and
Graham, to examine the country between this and the southern
coast of Doubtful Bay. Mr. Cowle was instructed to take 14 days'
provisions, but not to be absent more than 10 days. I intended
that the party should be lightly equipped, and ordered that but
one pack-horse should be taken, deeming that sufficient for four
persons for ten days. Mr. Cowle, however, took two, and I did not
choose to incur the responsibility of appearing to cripple the
party by interfering with this arrangement, but I much fear the
extra baggage will prove an incumbrance rather than an
assistance.</p>
<p>When the "Wild Dayrell" leaves it is my intention, please God
I am spared, to proceed myself to Hanover Bay, and examine the
country in the neighbourhood of the Prince Regent's River during
a more propitious season than when Grey visited that
locality.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I beg to express my approval of the conduct of
the members of the late expedition, and again to bear testimony
in favour of Mr. McRae's services. I trust that what has been
done will meet with the approbation of His Excellency the
Governor.</p>

<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">"Camden
Harbour,<br>
July 18, 1865.</div>
<p>It is now five months since we landed, or rather since the
"Tien Tsin" dropped anchor in Camden Harbour, so I ought to know
something about the place by this time. The life we have led is
not altogether a monotonous one; we have endured no privations,
but few positive discomforts, and have had a fair share of
health. For my part I never experienced better health. I have not
had a day's&mdash;I may say an hour's sickness, and have been
more free from care and anxiety than many who live in civilized
places. I have met with no difficulty which could not have been
easily surmounted by any man possessed of ordinary perseverance.
I have however been singularly fortunate in having for my
assistants men who yield obedience to orders, and yield without
resistance to the discipline of the camp, which is necessarily
strict.</p>
<p>Since the "Tien Tsin" left we have had our little events to
chronicle. The Malays paid us a visit, the "Jeanie Oswald" from
Melbourne came in and remained some three weeks, the "Forlorn
Hope" a boat from Adam Bay, gave us a hail <i>en route</i> for
Fremantle, and, finally, the "Wild Dayrell" from Melbourne
dropped her anchor in our waters, and here she is. We have had
two exploring expeditions South of the Glenelg, and have no end
of talk about sandstone ranges and shoeless horses. Another
exploring party to Doubtful Bay is now out and is expected back
to-morrow or next day, and, please God all goes well, another
will leave for Hanover Bay and the Prince Regent's River as soon
as the "Wild Dayrell" sails for Melbourne; so you see we have
something to do and something to talk about.</p>
<p>Setting aside our really magnificent harbour, there is no
doubt that the country and its capabilities have been unduly
praised. As a necessary consequence a reaction has been the
result, and it is and will be unduly depreciated. That it is
rocky, that the climate is hot, that there are impediments to
locomotion, ought not to have been novelties to
settlers&mdash;yet they were&mdash;for previous explorers do not
conceal the fact that the country is rugged; they could not have
concealed, had they wished, that the climate in lat. 15deg.
30min. was not temperate, and they rather magnified the fact of
the difficulties of travelling. Grey's account is a narrative of
struggles among sandstone rocks, and any one who read the report
of the trial Brown <i>v</i>. Burges, or whoever read Martin's
journal, could never have doubted that rocks abounded as well as
grass. The fault of previous explorers is that they have
over-estimated the amount of good country, and the quality of the
pasture. There is an abundance of grass everywhere. No one can
gainsay this. Upon the hills and in the valleys; upon the ranges
and in the ravines; on table lands and depressed plains; on stony
soil, on sandy soil, on clayey soil, on alluvial soil, on rocks
without apparently a trace of soil, there is grass, grass, and
nothing but grass of some sort. When I say "nothing," I mean that
there is no brushwood, no undergrowth between the trees which are
lightly scattered over the land. From Camden Harbour to the
source of the McRae I travelled through grass. From the source of
the McRae to the banks or the Walcott my son and his party
journeyed through grass&mdash;occasional patches of sterility in
both cases being excepted. I never saw so much grass before, and
most probably never shall again. But there is a great proportion
of it unfitted for any description of stock, some is
reed-like&mdash;juvenile canes in fact, some is sedgy, most of it
hard and innutritious. The whole of it is luxuriant, whether it
be the thick sward rising just above the horses' knees, and
impeding their progress, or the less dense masses which sweep
above the heads of steeds and riders; the growth is magnificent
and rich. By far the greater portion is however, adapted to the
use of large stock, and when fed down or burnt down, a much
larger tract of country may be made available, but I am confident
that it is not adapted for the particular description of stock
mentioned by explorers. It is not fitted for sheep. The mere
mechanical difficulty of getting at it would be sufficient,
independent of its coarseness and the absence of fattening
qualities. The ground is not adapted for sheep to travel over;
the grass on the ground is too high for them to reach, and could
they reach it, it is too rank for them to consume. I say this
irrespective of climatic considerations, for I believe that
continued change of blood will to a great extent neutralize the
effect of climate. Cattle would thrive, but not fatten
sufficiently to be profitable for tallow&mdash;at least so I
think, and I have spoken much on these subjects with persons
competent to give an opinion. This is essentially a horse
country, and I have little doubt but that a large horse breeding
establishment would pay. Our horses have thriven. They seldom
have anything but the natural herbage, and have been pretty well
knocked about among the sandstones, yet they look in good working
order, and perform their journeys like hard-fed, instead of
grass-fed animals. Our sheep&mdash;of which alas! but three
remain&mdash;have not fallen away very much&mdash;perhaps they
may be said to have held their own since they landed&mdash;but
they never got up to the condition they were in when put on board
at Fremantle. We have just none from disease, poison, or the
effects of climate. Some died shortly after landing from the
effects of the voyage, but none since; but then it must be borne
in mind that they were carefully tended, and were a very small
flock, gradually becoming smaller under the butcher's knife, and
therefore easily managed.</p>
<p>July 25.&mdash;The "Mystery" arrived on the 20th, and put a
stop to all private letter-writing, as she is on Government
account until her arrival at Roebuck Bay, and I am naturally very
anxious not to detain her. However I closed all my official
letters this morning, and as she cannot sail till this
afternoon&mdash;it is now 10 a.m.&mdash;I will continue my
letter, but not so leisurely as before as "sharp's" the word, and
I have not written a line to my wife and children.</p>
<p>You will have seen by my despatch per "Jeanie Oswald" the
result of my expedition south of the Glenelg. By this opportunity
I send my Journal. Trevy's report of his travels will also arrive
per "Mystery." He has been fortunate, having penetrated 40 miles
south of my farthest; passed over some good grazing land; crossed
three rivers, and arrived at the banks of a tidal river ¼ of a
mile wide, with a strong current and a rise and fall of tide of
many feet. This was 25 miles inland, and the river must therefore
be of some magnitude. It was not fordable, and will therefore
have to be crossed higher up. They seemed to have descended the
last of the sandstone ranges, and to have arrived at hilly basalt
country, and I have great expectations that we shall be able now
to get a fair coarse for Roebuck Bay. He named a prominent
elevation, rising in Panter Downs, Mount Lochée, after my old
friend. The last range of sandstones was named Harding Range, the
large river the Walcott, and the other rivers, &amp;c, after his
own private friends. I am well satisfied with Trevy's management.
I sent Cowle out in the direction of Red Cone Hill Doubtful Bay,
but have not yet got his report. He tells me that the country is
fearful&mdash;that he could not get within 20 miles of Red Cone
Hill, and that he did not get so far south as our farthest in
April. Success is not the measure of merit, and a man can but try
his best. I believe his difficulties were insurmountable.</p>
<p>Now I ascertain that there is no immediate prospect of
removal, I shall, on the departure of the two ships, send an
expedition to follow up Trevy's track as far as Mount Alexander;
from thence to take an easterly course until the Walcott is
crossed, and then make towards Roebuck Bay.</p>
<p>I am sadly afraid we shall come to blows with the natives, as
they are getting too bold. On Sunday morning, before daylight,
Mr. Cowle's boat was stolen, and has not been recovered. On 2nd
instant, a settler had some spears thrown at him. Their tracks
are seen about our camp. Some of them must be giants&mdash;one
track measured 14 inches 10-12th, or within a shade of 15 inches,
and 5 inches across the toes; another was 13 inches long. I must
try to capture one or two, and hope it may be done without
bloodshed. I shall not hesitate to take vigorous measures, for if
they steal the Government boat, upon which we depend for our
supply of water, we shall be in a pretty fix.</p>
<p>I have had great difficulty in procuring water, but have
overcome it. We now tow water casks from Mount Lookover&mdash;a
distance of about 3¼ miles.</p>
<p>I hope they will not delay sending a vessel until the arrival
of the "Mystery," as our supply of provisions will not last
beyond November, and if any accident should happen to the
succouring ship we shall come to grief. We have very little game,
and let it be ever so plentiful, an establishment like ours could
not be supported on the natural produce of the country.</p>
<p>The Governor is right in supposing that the Camden Harbor
people decided without consideration. They assumed too much, and
did not wait to satisfy themselves of the correctness of their
assumptions. I have examined for myself, and sent others to do so
for me, and have arrived at the conclusion that settlement will
be from the south upwards, and not from seaward. Be this as it
may, the mere fact of there being no settlers and no revenue
ought to determine the question as to the eligibility, of Camden
Harbor for a Government station.</p>
<p>You are right in saying that it is not fitted for Europeans.
It is fitted for tropical produce, raised by Coolie labour; the
same may be said of Roebuck Bay. That place will, I fancy, be
settled also by extension of runs from the southward. If Nickol
Bay yields cereals and other European crops, I can only say that
it is a wonderful place. My belief is that the people there most
depend upon Southern farms for the bread they eat.</p>
<p>From my knowledge of the prowling disposition of the natives
in this place, and their night-wandering propensities, I felt
certain that poor Panter * and his associates were murdered in
their sleep. I first heard the news per "Jeannie Oswald." We have
raised a small subscription&mdash;not much, but something for
Camden Harbor&mdash;for Goldwyer's widow.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Frederick Panter, James Harding and William
Goldwyer were murdered by aborigines at La Grange Bay, south of
Roebuck Bay, in November 1864. Their bodies were later recovered
by an expedition led by Maitland Brown; <span class=
"aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>I still say this is a well-watered country. Though we are
getting water from Mount Lookover, our stock obtain it a mile
from hence, and in abundance. The country is, however, impassable
for carts, and the water cannot be conveyed to our camp.</p>
<p>Dr. Bompas speaks highly of the choice I made, and says that
our encampment is healthily located. I welcome him as a
companion."</p>

<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">Government
Resident's Office,<br>
Camden Harbour, July 24, 1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;I last had the honour of
addressing you on the 2nd June, per "Forlorn Hope," an open boat,
from Adam Bay, and bound for Fremantle, for which port she sailed
on the 3rd ultimo. I enclose copy of that letter.</p>
<p>The "Wild Dayrell," a vessel of 158 tons burden, from
Melbourne 3rd June, arrived on the 2nd instant. She is now in
harbour, loading with stores, &amp;c., saved from the wreck of
the "Calliance," being under charter to the purchasers of that
ship. She will sail on or about the 29th instant.</p>
<p>The "Mystery", arrived on the 20th instant, and brought a
welcome addition to our party in the person of Dr. Bompas. The
stores, &amp;c., brought by that vessel, have been landed. She
will sail to-morrow, by which time I hope to have completed my
letters. By her I shall send the various public accounts
connected with this district, with the exception of those for the
current month. These I shall send by the "Wild Dayrell," together
with such further information as I may have to communicate. She
is a quick sailer, and may probably arrive at Melbourne before
the departure of the August mail. I should not be surprised to
hear that the letters sent by her arrived at as early a date as
those per "Mystery," the latter vessel having to call at Roebuck
Bay, the DeGrey River, and Tien Tsin Bay.</p>
<p>The remaining members of the Association are anxious to leave,
and, if they can make arrangements with the master of the "Wild
Dayrell," the greater portion will do so. At present there is no
perfect understanding in the matter. The "Mystery" will convey
two of them to Nickol Bay, viz., Messrs. McRae and Hindhaugh,
both of whom have been of great service during our explorations,
whose presence I shall miss, and for whose welfare in their new
home many good wishes are uttered.</p>
<p>I am happy to inform His Excellency that the health of
everyone in camp, generally very good, is at present excellent,
and I earnestly hope that it may continue so, now that the doctor
has arrived. There have been, however, two deaths at the
Association Camp since the date of my last letter. Mrs. Pascoe,
the wife of one of the settlers, died on the 4th ultimo, of
fever, a few days after childbirth, and a child of Mr. Paterson's
died from teething, after a prolonged illness, on the 17th
ultimo. They were both buried on Sheep Island. We have not yet
had the slightest symptom of fever in our Camp, and I trust that
our elevated position may be the means of preserving us from this
plague. I am gratified to hear Dr. Bompass express approbation,
on sanitary grounds, of the site chosen for our encampment.</p>
<p>The general conduct of all under my charge still continues
good. Once only have I had to punish any of the party, and then
only to a limited extent, the punishment being partially remitted
upon an expression of sorrow on the part of the offender. The
offence was insubordination.</p>
<p>Mr. Assistant Surveyor Cowle, who has been for some time past
engaged in surveying the harbour, completed his task on the 10th
ultimo. I applied to him for a tracing of the work, but he was
unable to furnish me with one to forward by either of the vessels
in harbour. Since that time he has surveyed and defined the
boundaries of Elliot Town, situated at a spot adjacent to the
Calliance Camp. I have not at this date been furnished with a
tracing showing the position of the townsite. Mr. Cowle reports
very favourably with respect to the suitability of the locality
for the purpose. The work was completed on the 6th instant.</p>
<p>The expedition south of the Glenelg started on the 5th ultimo,
and returned in safety on the 26th ultimo.* It consisted of Mr.
T. C. Sholl (in charge), Mr. McRae, P.C. Gee, John Stainer, and
native constable Billy. I am glad to inform you that the party
penetrated the ranges 40 miles south of depôt No. 2 of the last
expedition, and that the country began to look more promising,
basalt hills taking the place of the sandstone ranges, which have
so impeded our progress. A large tract of superior pastoral land
was discovered, and named by Mr. Sholl the Panter Downs after the
late lamented explorer. These Downs were watered by three rivers,
named respectively the Sale, the Berckelman, and the Middleton;
the Berckelman being the main stream, and flowing in the
direction of Secure Bay. Rising from the Downs were several
basalt hills of considerable elevation, named after private
friends. Mr. Sholl was good enough, at my request, to designate
one prominent hill Mount Lochée, after one of the most worthy of
our colonists. At their extreme southern point the explorers
struck a large tidal river, flowing in the direction of Stokes'
Bay. This river was named the Walcott. It was of considerable
width, with a strong current, and a rise and fall of tide of many
feet. Full particulars of the journey, together with an estimate
of the probable capabilities of the grazing land, will be found
in the reports furnished by Messrs. Sholl and McRae, and which I
have forwarded under another cover. The journal of the gentleman
in command; which appears to be full and explicit, will be
forwarded as soon as a fair copy can be made. There was every
indication of a break in the country to the eastward of Mount
Alexander, and in this direction future explorers will have to
proceed, in order that the Walcott may be crossed higher up. I
was well satisfied with the result of the expedition.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix 5; <span class=
"aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>As soon as Assistant Surveyor Cowle had completed his surveys
of the harbour and townsite, I despatched him in charge of a
small party, consisting of, besides himself, P.C. Jackerman, and
chainers Graham and Paterson, towards the Red Cone Hill, near the
S.E. shore of Doubtful Bay. The party left the Government camp op
the 10th, and returned on the 19th instant. I have not yet
received Mr. Cowle's report, but he informs me that the country
was rocky in the extreme, and that he was unable to proceed
within 20 miles of the Red Cone Hill, or as far south as the No 2
depôt of the April expedition. With difficulty he struck the
McRae, and got on our former tracks. Mr. Cowle visited Mount
Lyell, from the summit of which hill be took such bearings as
would enable him to determine its exact position. In the absence
of Mr. Cowle's report I cannot, of course, give a decisive
opinion, but I have every reason to believe that he made every
effort to follow out his instructions, and that he failed to
reach the Red Cone Hill because the difficulties opposed to him
were insurmountable.</p>
<p>Neither of the exploring parties fell in with natives, but
their tracks were seen by both.</p>
<p>It seems clear that Doubtful Bay does not afford an outlet
available for produce raised in any country to the eastward of
Mr. Cowle's track. As far as our present knowledge extends,
Camden Harbour is the port of the country to the southward and
eastward. I allude, of course, to land carriage, as the Glenelg
is navigable for small craft from the lower rapids to George
Water and Doubtful Bay.</p>
<p>Now that it is certain that we need not expect a vessel for
some time, I shall dispatch another party to continue the
explorations in a south-easterly direction from Mount Alexander.
When the Walcott has been crossed, a southerly course will be
taken, in the direction of Roebuck Bay, and the track to the
eastward, balanced by a corresponding detour to the west. The
party will leave shortly after the departure of the "Wild
Dayrell," and be absent for 3 or 4 weeks.</p>
<p>I have had some difficulty in securing a supply of water for
my camp, but it has happily been overcome. The wells at the rear
of the camp have gradually become dry, as well as another I had
made. Since the date of my letter of 2nd ultimo, I have had my
force principally engaged in sinking wells through the rocks, and
in rafting water. We could not, however, get deep enough in
consequence of the hardness of the rock, and the quality of our
tools. The supply of steel sent per "Mystery" will enable us to
resume operations. On the 21st ultimo, I was convinced that we
should soon have to obtain water from Augustus Island, and I have
a raft made, but being anxious to get water nearer to our camp
than 7 miles, I proceeded to Mount Lookover. Here I observed some
water dripping from the rocks, at the base of the N.W. slope of
that hill It was lost in the sand, or rather fine gravel, of the
beach. Some holes had been sunk by Mr. Anderson's party, but as
the water could not be retained in sufficient quantity, they were
not used. Seeing some clay in the immediate neighbourhood, I sent
a couple of hands to widen the holes, and puddle them with clay.
The water, however, still escaped, and that which remained was
moreover muddied by the clay. I then had a trench cut for some 20
feet up the slope to collect and carry off the drip, purchased a
400 gallon tank, had some wooden spouting made, to connect the
trench with the tank, and have now an abundance of clear water.
The distance from camp is about 3¼ miles. Finding that the raft
did not answer, I discarded it, and have since towed the casks.
As there was water at this place when we arrived in February, I
hope we shall have sufficient until the ship arrives to take us
away; if not, I can still fall back on Augustus Island.</p>
<p>We have had no rain since I last wrote, and the country is now
of a brown hue. We have water for stock about a mile back, over
hills, which are not practicable for carts. In consequence of the
lack of rain, our garden is not in good condition. With the
exception of a pumpkin vine, which presents a respectable
appearance, and the cotton plants, nothing looks healthy, and
most of the vegetables have died off. I gathered, on the 17th
instant, French bean seed, from plants raised from seed sown in
the middle of April; but the return was not equal to the quantity
sown. Had we water for irrigation I have no doubt the result
would have been different, but of course I cannot spare water for
this purpose.</p>
<p>Anticipating removal, I have had some hay cut on the townsite,
but the principal work of the party has been, as I before stated,
confined to seeking for and conveying water. We have, however,
erected the carpenter's shop, a building 12 x 12 or thereabouts,
and the carpenter has also made a head-board and railing for
Jimba's grave. The head board has an inscription, containing
name, calling, and date of death, of late native assistant P.C.
Jimba. It has been placed at his grave at Sheep Island. The
landing-place has been much improved, and we shall be able to
ship our goods at a quicker rate than we landed them. I shall
make every arrangement for our departure, by having the things
not in use, or likely to be required, packed in suitable
boxes.</p>
<p>Until between 3 and 5 o'clock of the morning of the 23rd, the
natives have not troubled us, but yesterday morning Mr. Cowle's
boat was declared to be missing. I despatched the Government
pinnace, in charge of Mr. Cowle, to look for her, but the party
returned at night unsuccessful. Serjeant Aherne marched a party
of 4 pensioners to the end of the peninsula, but could see
nothing of the boat or natives. Some soldiers took the boat of
the "Wild Dayrell" as far as Rogers' Straits, but could gain no
information. Mr. Nairn, a passenger by the "Mystery" kindly
volunteered to assist, and went in that vessel's boat along the
N.W. shore of the harbour, but with no better luck than the
others. On the 2nd instant, Mr. Davey, one of the settlers, came
upon some natives on the top of Mount Lookover. They threw
several spears at him, and I have no doubt but that the affair
would have ended seriously had not Mr. Davey, with great presence
of mind, pointed his telescope at the natives, which had the
effect of dispersing them. Their conflicts with the Malays have
taught them the use and effect of fire-arms.</p>
<p>It would seem that these people are gradually becoming bolder.
From what I have previously stated it must be apparent to you
that the loss of our boat, dependent as we are upon it for our
supply of water, would seriously inconvenience my party&mdash;it
would do more than inconvenience us&mdash;health, and perhaps
life, might be endangered by its loss. Independent of this,
success emboldens the natives, and if they can creep about our
camp with impunity to steal boats, they can do so for worse
purposes. It therefore becomes necessary to take such measures as
will impress upon them the necessity of respecting our property
and our lives. I shall not hesitate to adopt such a course as
will tend to preserve my camp from aggression, and I hope I may
be enabled to capture the guilty parties without resorting to
violence. I shall attempt to do so; but I am determined to punish
the natives who have thrown spears without provocation at one of
the settlers, and have more than once robbed our own camp.</p>
<p>I have been so engaged in preparing letters, &amp;c., for the
"Mystery," not desiring to detain that vessel, that I have not
had sufficient leisure to take an active part in the proceedings,
but when the vessel has sailed will do so. To-day our boat is
employed water-towing, and the men will be too tired for
night-work, but to-morrow I will despatch another party to search
the mangrove creeks, and will not abate my endeavours until the
boat is recovered and the thieves punished.</p>
<p>We have had cool weather during the past and present month,
but still not so cool as to permit one wearing a light coat with
comfort. The lowest indication of the thermometer has been 62½
degrees. The nights are colder&mdash;I should say by some 5 or 6
degrees&mdash;for a rug is acceptable in addition to the usual
covering&mdash;a sheet. I shall forward per "Wild Dayrell" tables
showing the temperature from the date of our arrival until the
present time.</p>
<p>From the tenor of this and preceding letters you cannot
hesitate to arrive at a conclusion with respect to the
suitability of this place for settlement. I observed in my letter
of 17th March&mdash;"I presume that the Governor will not
maintain an establishment at a place which yields no revenue, and
therefore if no ships arrive with settlers, may expect the party
to be removed." I now state emphatically that I do not consider
that this place will be settled from seaward, but that, if
settled at all, it will be by the gradual extension of pastoral
occupation from the southward. I do not believe that it is fitted
for European agriculture or European agriculturists. It certainly
is not fitted at the present time for sheep. I cannot say whether
it would do for cattle, but believe they would not fatten
sufficiently to make the tallow remunerative. Horses would
thrive. Ours hold their own, and do their work well when employed
exploring. We have a splendid harbor, the scenery is magnificent,
the country generally is well watered and well grassed, and with
common prudence in the selection of locality it is as healthy a
country as any in the world, so far far as my experience goes. No
revenue has been received nor is likely to be received, no
settlers have arrived nor are likely to arrive, and those that
have remained will leave as quickly as their opportunities or
means will admit. The "Warrior" has landed her passengers and
stock at Tien Tsin Bay, and at that locality a town will be
formed, although the Government establishment may be elsewhere. I
do not believe that Roebuck Bay will, any more than Camden
Harbor, be settled, except by the dispersion of population from
the southward as grazing lands become over-stocked; and I feel
certain that no Government townsite will attract population to
spots not otherwise suitable. Towns are formed by the
accumulation of population, and population is attracted by the
exploration of new country. Settlement will follow exploration
from the south to the north, and its progress will be gradual and
slow.</p>
<p>I have now, Sir, to bring this letter to a close, and in doing
so to express the very great pleasure that it has given me to
receive your intimation that His Excellency the Governor approved
of the course I had adopted up to the date of the departure of
the "Tien Tsin." I beg to assure His Excellency that every effort
will be made by me to ensure the comfort and safety of those
entrusted to my charge, and I hope, with God's assistance, that
those efforts will be crowned with success.</p>

<h3>SIXTH DISPATCH: 16 September, 1865.</h3>
<hr class="tenth">
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;"><i>Government
Resident's Office.<br>
Port Camden, September</i> 16, 1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;It is with much regret that
I have to report, for the information of His Excellency the
Governor, the loss of the Government pinnace belonging to the
station, together with the death of Michael Quinlan, blacksmith,
attached to my party, who went down in her and was drowned.</p>
<p>In my letters despatched by the <i>Mystery</i> and <i>Wild
Dayrell</i>, I had the honor to inform you that it was my
intention to institute a search after Mr. Cowle's boat as soon as
I possibly could after the departure of those vessels.</p>
<p>The <i>Wild Dayrell</i> sailed on the 16th ult., but a
combination of circumstances, principally the difficulty of
supplying a sufficiency of water during my absence, prevented my
leaving camp until the 4th instant.</p>
<p>On that day I started two parties&mdash;one under Mr.
Assistant Surveyor Cowle in the Association boat (which had been
kindly placed at my disposal by its proprietors); the other under
my command, in the Government pinnace. Mr. Cowle proceeded along
the western shore of the harbor, intending to examine the islands
to the westward. I sailed for Augustus Water and Port George the
Fourth.</p>
<p>Mr. Cowle took with him John Graham, Maurice Enright, Michael
Murphy, the son of a settler named Ross. James Patterson had been
detailed to accompany the party, but just as they were on the
point of starting, he was relieved from duty on medical
certificate, and Ross taken in his place.</p>
<p>I took with me Mr. T. C. Sholl, Thomas Tompkinson, Michael
Quinlan, P.C. W. Gee, and Daniel Coffee.</p>
<p>Before leaving I appointed Mr. C. S. Bompas in charge of camp,
and furnished him with instructions for his guidance. I left, as
I thought, nearly sufficient water for the reduced force at the
camp, and instructed Mr. Bompas to send the dingy across to Mount
Lookover for any additional quantity that might be required.</p>
<p>Both boat parties took seven days' provisions, and every one
was well armed. We were to return on the following Monday, 11th.
inst., and, if possible, communication between the two boats was
to take place on Wednesday, 6th instant at the entrance to Port
George the Fourth.</p>
<p>As regards Mr. Cowle's party I may state that his boat
returned on the Saturday, (9th instant). He had not seen anything
of his boat, or natives, nor had anything transpired calling for
a special report.</p>
<p>The pinnace sailed from the camp at about 2 a.m., on 4th
instant. We proceeded to the watering place at Augustus Island,
and, having filled our beakers, made sail for Augustus Water. We
skirted the shores of this indentation, but saw nothing of the
missing boat. Dining at a point of land at the apex of Camden
Peninsula, we afterwards entered Port George the Fourth dropping
anchor for the night off a sandy shore on the eastern side of the
port.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 5th inst., after partaking of some
slight refreshment, we sailed and pulled along the southern shore
of an inlet or bay in Port George the Fourth. At about 8 or 9
o'clock&mdash;for we had no time-piece with us&mdash;we were
hailed by an unarmed native, who was standing at the apex of a
small rocky peninsula, bounded on one side by a narrow mangrove
creek, and on the other by the waters of the bay. He made signs
for us to approach at a spot he indicated. The boat's sail was
taken down, and we pulled as near as was prudent, but I would not
go where he desired, as other natives had been seen concealed,
and the tops of spears had appeared above the rocks. By signs he
told us that there was water in the creek, but we did not require
water, and I ascertained, by examination, that if we entered the
creek, we would be liable to a volley from either side at close
quarters; I would not therefore go, but put the boat in
sufficiently near to throw the native a piece of bread, which he
devoured ravenously, parting with a portion to some concealed
person.</p>
<p>Observing a flat ledge of rock, where it appeared that we were
secure from surprise, I ordered the boat to be put in, that I
might land and entice the native to come forward with more bread.
I landed, and was joined by Mr. T. C. Sholl, Tompkinson, and
Quinlan. I could not induce the man to come. He sat on a rock,
some forty yards off, and commenced singing and gesticulating.
Our position was apparently safe; we were upon a table of rock
about breast high, and from this we could see a clear space, with
rising ground about 30 yards off. Before this space could be
rushed we should be on our guard, and our weapons were in hand
ready for service. Finding that the man would not come, I ordered
the men into the boat, and followed them.</p>
<p>Mr. Sholl remained behind, making signs to the native. I told
him to come into the boat. Before he did so he looked over the
table rock, and saw some ten or twelve natives rushing towards us
with their spears shipped, and about six yards from him. He
stooped behind a rock, and looking over, pulled the trigger of
his revolver, which missed fire. I was standing in the boat, and,
hearing an exclamation, looked round. The air was darkened by a
cloud of spears, dowaks, and other missiles; I saw before me,
behind the table, a mass of black heads, breasts and arms.
Cocking my revolver, I fired into the mass, about eight yards
from me; Mr. Sholl also again pulled his trigger, and this time
the pistol exploded. The natives at once retired, nor did we get
another shot at close quarters. Had Mr. Sholl's pistol been true
at first, I do not think a spear would have been thrown, so
suddenly did the natives disappear after the two shots were
fired.</p>
<p>We afterwards saw them among the rocks about 30 yards off, and
as soon as any part of their persons were exposed we
fired&mdash;that is Quinlan, Mr. Sholl, and myself. Tompkinson
took a long shot with a revolver at the traitor native, who had
shown his head above a rock, and so did Mr. Sholl, but I do not
think either shot took effect, nor any of the long shots except
one fired by Mr. Sholl from a carbine. He took deliberate aim at
a native who, bolder than the rest, appeared from behind a rock
with his spear shipped. He fell behind the rock, and I have no
doubt was hit. The two shots fired at close quarters could not
have failed to take effect in some part of the bodies of the
natives. Although at the first onset Mr. Sholl's pistol missed
fire, and thus the attack was not prevented, I believe that his
pointing the weapon at the enemy disturbed their aim, which would
otherwise have been more deadly. I am also of opinion that the
two shots fired immediately after attack prevented our having
another volley. Every barrel of Mr. Sholl's pistol, except the
one, failed, and he had to employ the arms of others.</p>
<p>When the attack was beaten off, and the natives ceased to show
from behind the rocks, we found that P.C. Gee had been wounded in
the back of the left shoulder by a blunt spear, which had
penetrated about half an inch, or perhaps more, and struck the
shoulder blade. He saw the spear coming, and turned to evade it,
catching it behind. Mr. Sholl also received a severe contused
wound on the left arm, near the shoulder, inflicted either by a
dowak or club. He received it when he was stooping down at the
rush. The flesh was crushed and bleeding, and the arm black from
the shoulder to the elbow. It was very painful. Gee complained of
great pain, and begged of me to take him home. I accordingly
ordered the boat to be turned in the direction of the camp.</p>
<p>As we left a low mournful wail arose, indicating that all had
not gone well with the enemy. Large signal fires were at once
lighted.</p>
<p>Every one in the boat behaved with coolness and
self-possession. Coffee and Gee were engaged in keeping the boat
ready for our immediate embarkation, and took no part in the
fight.</p>
<p>The tide was now near its full, and it was desirable that we
should arrive at Rogers' Straits, if possible, before the turn,
as the current is there so strong that we might be delayed same
hours. It was distant about ten miles. We had little or no wind,
and had to pull. Gee was, of course, unable to take any part, and
Mr. Sholl was also unable to handle an oar; the pulling was
therefore done by Tompkinson, Quinlan, and Coffee, I from time to
time lending such assistance as I could.</p>
<p>When we got to the Straits the tide had turned, and with four
oars it was as much as we could do to make head-way. Mr. Sholl
proposed to keep near the shore, and hold on to the mangroves,
but Gee begged that he would not do so. He seemed to be in great
agony. We anchored for a few minutes to give us breathing time,
and then resumed our oars, but after pulling hard, found we were
losing ground. We were now abreast of the channel between
Augustus and Brecknock Islands, and again let go the anchor for a
spell. It dragged for a few minutes, and then suddenly held fast.
The bows of the boat were pulled under, she filled, and we were
all in the current, swimming for our lives. Alas! not all. Poor
Quinlan went down in the boat, and never rose again. We were all
swept a mile from the scene of the accident in a very few
minutes. Gee and Tompkinson each got an oar, the former
notwithstanding his wound, striking out manfully. They made for
two separate islands. Mr. Sholl, Coffee, and myself were together
and strove to make one of the islands, but were carried past. We
then attempted to get to the mainland, but while doing this were
sucked in a whirlpool, and nearly lost. Hitherto Coffee had kept
with me at my request, but when we emerged, thoroughly exhausted,
and I thought all hope was gone, I told him to save himself, and
not till then did he leave us. As this fine fellow was swimming
off I spied one of the boat's beakers floating near him and Mr.
Sholl asked him to push it our way, which he did, and offered to
send an oar to us, but was told to keep it himself. He made for
Camden Peninsula. I begged my son to leave me, but he would not;
he said we would die together. Through God's mercy, by aid of the
beaker, but mainly by the assistance of my son, my life was
spared. He could have saved his life at any time. We tried to
make Augustus Island and failed. Finally we determined to make a
continued and vigorous effort to reach the mainland and, after
struggling in the water for upwards of six hours, with varying
success and without hope of ever landing alive, we reached the
sandy beach which we had had left in the morning. The accident
took place at about noon, we landed about an hour after moon
rise. We were now from 8 to 10 miles from the spot where the boat
sank, and two or three miles from where we had the encounter with
the natives. The distance from camp, in a direct line, was about
10 miles, but we had to go round Augustus Water and many mangrove
creeks, and we estimated our travelling distance at three or four
times that measurement.</p>
<p>Thanking Almighty God for our merciful deliverance, and
resting for a brief space, we proceeded along the beach no longer
sandy but rocky, during the remainder of the night constantly
dropping down, sometimes for a few minutes breathing time, and
sometimes for an hour's broken slumber. By daylight of the 6th
instant, we had, after skirting a small bay with mangrove creeks,
arrived on the eastern shore of Augustus Water. This we followed
towards the south, going inland to get round the creeks. At about
noon on that day we got water at the head of a mangrove creek,
the first fresh water we had partaken of since the accident.</p>
<p>Here we rested during the extreme heat of the day, drinking
copious draughts of water. We were wearied with exertion, and
faint from anxiety, toil, and fasting. Our clothes were torn with
travelling; we were unarmed, and without food. My son was
stronger than myself, but he suffered more than I did from
thirst. Having strained one of my legs while swimming, moving
through the long grass, up high hills, and over rough ground, was
a matter of pain and difficulty. We however kept moving night and
day, but our halts became more frequent.</p>
<p>Resuming our course, we found that the creeks at the southern
end of the Water ran considerably to the S.S.E. and extended for
a mile or so inland. As fast as we headed one, another had to be
rounded, and the country was fearfully rugged. Late in the
afternoon we attempted, as the tide was very low, to make a short
cut across the mouth of the creek, but got bogged in the mud, and
had to retrace our steps with much labour, and at an expenditure
of much of our remaining strength. At night we were approaching
the S.W. corner of Augustus Water. We slept for an hour or two,
and then continued travelling round the creek. As near as we
could guess it was 8 o'clock on the morning of the 7th inst.,
that we again got water at the head of a creek about a mile
inland, and situated at the S.W. end of Augustus Water.</p>
<p>We now struck a due west course to clear the mangroves, and
then a point or two to the northward. This shortly brought us to
the track of the Glenelg expedition, which we followed, and soon
came to the baobab described by Dr. Martin. At noon we reached
camp, where we received the most kind and hearty welcome.</p>
<p>My first inquiries were for my companions. I was told that
Tompkinson arrived in camp on the afternoon of the 9th instant.
He had reached an island, and seeing Gee on another, not far off,
had swam to him. He then made for Camden Peninsula, leaving Gee
on the island. During the passage he had lost all his clothes,
except his boots. It was moonlight when he reached the mainland,
and in attempting to steer for the camp he lost his way, not
discovering his error until daylight. Exposed to the sun he was
fearfully scorched and, having no covering for the head, he
wandered somewhat in discourse. He arrived in camp perfectly
naked and thoroughly exhausted. He reported that Coffee, my son,
and myself, were drawn into a whirlpool and drowned.</p>
<p>Succouring parties were sent towards the end of the Peninsula,
who communicated, with Gee by discharging their carbines, and
calling to him. One of these parties fell in with Coffee on the
morning of my arrival. He was much exhausted, and being without
trowsers, was much burnt on the middle and lower parts of his
person. He also reported the deaths of my son and myself. He was
brought in on the evening of the same day.</p>
<p>The surf boat had been sent on the morning of the 7th to
relieve Gee, and he was brought into camp in the evening. His
wound was not so painful, but he suffered much from the
privations he had undergone.</p>
<p>Tompkinson and Coffee are slowly recovering. Poor Gee,
however, is very ill, and Mr. Bompas entertains little or no
hopes of his recovery. He has suffered from extreme shortness of
breath, and has vomited and expectorated blood and salt water. He
is in such agony that he cannot sleep, and any posture is irksome
to him.</p>
<p>So far, we had all been mercifully saved. We have been
preserved from drowning. Sharks, which often abound in the
Straits, and were this day in swarms near the camp, did not come
near us. We were not molested by the natives. As regards my son
and myself, by God's Providence, we did not drift to the place of
encounter with the natives, though at one time we were very near
it. We had also fine moonlight nights, which enabled us to
travel, otherwise I doubt whether we could have reached home. To
journey continually in the heat of the day would have been too
much for us.</p>
<p>The men all behaved well. There was no confusion. Every one
seemed calm and collected. They have since born their sufferings
with cheerful resignation. I cannot find words to express my
sense of Coffee's noble conduct. To my son I am indebted, under
God, that I am now alive to write this letter; but the matter is
of too personal a nature to render its introduction proper in an
official document.</p>
<p>Everything was done in camp which could be done with effect on
this trying occasion. Mr. Bompas informs me that upon hearing of
the accident he consulted with Assistant Storekeeper Chamberlain
and Sergeant Aherne, as to the steps to be taken, and they
devised the measures which proved so effectual. Everyone willing
by and heartily rendered assistance.</p>
<p>At 6 a.m. an Saturday, the 9th inst., Mr. Sholl, having
sufficiently recovered, proceeded to Rogers' Straits in the
surf-boat to see whether there was any possibility of recovering
poor Quinlan's body, or of raising the boat. I regret to state
that he was unsuccessful. Nothing was seen of the body, and the
recovery of a portion of the stern of the boat indicated her
fate. She was lost, and everything in her, including private as
well as public property.</p>
<p>No foresight could, I believe, have prevented the accident.
The place is bare, or nearly so, at low water, and we could not
possibly have anticipated so disastrous a result. Gee suffered so
much that we strained every nerve to bring him into camp for
medical treatment, and our object was to drop the anchor
occasionally, in order that we might renew our strength and pull
through the Straits. A few hundred yards further on would have
brought us clear of the current. Our great apprehension was that
the receding tide would leave us aground, when six hours must
elapse before we could move forward.</p>
<p>I cannot say how deeply I regret this occurrence, involving,
as it has done, the loss of a valuable life.</p>

<h3>SIXTH DISPATCH (continued): 25 October, 1865.</h3>

<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;"><i>Government
Resident's Office.<br>
Camden Harbour, Oct</i>. 25, 1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honor to report
the arrival of the brig <i>Kestrel</i> in Brecknock Harbour on
the 14th. inst. She sailed the next day for Augustus Island to
take in water, and on the 19th inst. anchored in Camden Harbor.
We commenced loading the next day, and still continue to send off
goods. I expect we shall have finished to-day, and will be able
to put the horses on board to-morrow.</p>
<p>Since I last addressed you per <i>Wild Dayrell</i>, which
vessel sailed for Melbourne on the 11th August, our time has been
mainly occupied in procuring a supply of water. At one time I
thought of moving my party to Association Camp, the water at
Mount Lookover getting slack, but happily was able to arrange it
so that I brought water occasionally from that camp This was,
however, a work of time, the casks having to be rolled some
distance. The supply at Mount Lookover is not quite exhausted,
and we draw from both places.</p>
<p>Since the feed has been burnt and the water holes near the
camp have been dried up, the tending of the horses has been
troublesome, and occupied from time to time several men, as I
cannot send people out singly as in a settled country.</p>
<p>In my letter per <i>Mystery</i> I stated that it was my
intention to proceed as soon as possible in search of a boat, the
private property of Mr. J. Cowle, which had been stolen by the
natives. I could not leave before the 4th September, when two
boats were despatched, one in charge of Assistant Surveyor Cowle
and the other under my control. Mr. Cowle returned in the course
of a week without having succeeded in seeing either boat or
natives. I regret to state that we did not all come back in
safety. We were attacked by the natives in Port George the
Fourth, when unfortunately P.C. Gee was wounded and died from the
effects twelve days afterwards. In returning we lost our boat in
Rogers' Straits, when Michael Quinlan, blacksmith, was, I am
grieved to state, drowned. As I have furnished full particulars
of these lamentable events, forwarded under another cover, it is
unnecessary for me to recapitulate.</p>
<p>I abandoned the excavations at the gully well, our progress
being slow, the labour great and the success problematical, It
was fortunate I did so, as during the highest spring tides salt
water rose in the hole, so our labour would have been wasted.</p>
<p>The weather has gradually become warmer, but is not
unpleasant,</p>

<h3>SIXTH DISPATCH (continued): 2 December, 1865.</h3>
<hr class="tenth">
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;"><i>Tien Tsin
Harbor, December</i> 2, 1865.</div>
<p>We embarked all our party on the 27th Oct., but the
<i>Kestrel</i> did not sail from Camden Harbor until the
29th.</p>
<p>I regret to state that we had to leave behind our wooden
buildings and timber, fencing, and shingles, to the value of
£150, besides a tank and several horses, private property. One of
the Government Police horses was also abandoned, but as he was
old and weak I should not have taken him under any
circumstances.</p>
<p>We had a long and unpleasant passage, the winds being adverse
and the sailing capabilities of the ship not remarkable. We
grazed a rock almost immediately after leaving Brecknock Harbor.
It was about 4 miles from the Heads, and opposite the entrance.
At the time we passed over it was covered with some ten feet
water.</p>
<p>I regret to state that shortly after leaving Camden Harbor the
horses (12) were placed on a short allowance of water (3 gallons)
and suffered severely. At no time were they allowed more than 4
gallons, the ordinary supply being in temperate latitudes six,
and in tropical latitudes eight gallons. One horse (belonging to
Mr. Cowle) died before we arrived at Roebuck Bay. She slipped her
foal, but would have recovered had there been sufficient
water.</p>
<p>On the 8th Nov. the supply of water to the passengers was
reduced to 2 quarts per diem, and this continued during our stay
at Cape Villaret.</p>
<p>The ship put into Roebuck Bay, or rather anchored off Cape
Villaret on the 13th inst., and here we remained until the 18th
taking in water. I permitted our people to assist in watering the
ship.</p>
<p>We were kindly received and hospitably entertained at Cape
Villaret by Mr. Logue, the gentleman in charge of the Roebuck Bay
Company's stations. Under his able management there is every
prospect of this little settlement flourishing. The cattle,
horses, and sheep at the home station were looking very well, and
I was surprised that the parched herbage could keep stock in such
condition.</p>
<p>There are four wells at the home station which yield an
abundant supply of excellent water, far superior to any I have
tasted here, and as good if not better than what we obtained at
Camden Harbor.</p>
<p>The natives in the neighborhood of the stations have, thanks
to Mr. Logue's management, become quiet. They now neither molest
the people or stock. They understand that they will not be
interfered with if they are peaceable, and when a whiteman
approaches lay down their spears and allow him to pass. All
attempts to open communication with them have hitherto
failed.</p>
<p>The more distant tribes are, however, still hostile. An
exploring party consisting of Messrs. Logue, McRae, and Vincent,
with P.C. Toovey and a native, were nearly surprised, and shared
the fate of Mr. Panter and his companions. This occurred at
Barlee Springs. The native first discovered that there was an
ambush, and the prowlers were driven off. Freshly cut clubs were
found close to the spot, dropped by them in their retreat. They
were followed up the next morning, and received a lesson which
may possibly have good effect.</p>
<p>This expedition travelled within 20 miles of the Fitzroy, when
it was compelled to return for want of water. The country is
described as good and it was improving at the point of return.
You will, however, receive information on all matters connected
with this exploration from Mr. Logue himself.</p>
<p>While we were anchored off Cape Villaret Mr. Cowle, (who had
kindly taken an interest in the horses, had superintended their
shipping and was of great service on board the vessel) proposed
to take the horses overland, stating his opinion that they would
die if left on board the <i>Kestrel</i>, from want of sufficient
water. I took into consideration the wretched state of the
animals, and the probability, judging from the prevailing winds,
of a protracted passage, and resolved to comply with his request.
Accordingly eight horses were landed, one of them belonging to
Mr. Pascoe, a settler. They were in a wretched plight, and
Messrs. Logue and McRae both expressed an opinion that they could
not survive the voyage. Mr. Cowle was equipped from our
Government stores and provision for six weeks, one fortnight's
rations being for his estimated detention at Cape Villaret. The
party consists, besides Mr. Cowle, of Mr. Pascoe, J. Patterson,
M. Murphy, and J. Stainer. Mr. Logue kindly consented to let him
have one of his natives.</p>
<p>Our necessities may possibly, and I hope will, lead to a
desired result, viz., the establishment of an overland route
between this and Roebuck Bay. The only impediment I apprehend is
want of water, but already there have been partial rains, and
possibly the water-holes may be replenished. There has been no
rain here, but there was heavy rain at the Sherlock some few days
ago. At all events, I desired Mr. Cowle to fall back at once
should he be short of water.</p>
<p>I kept one of the police horses and my pony for service in
Tien Tsin Bay, should they be fortunate enough to survive.</p>
<p>On the 18th ult. we sailed from Cape Villaret, and having more
favorable winds than before, reached our destination on the 24th
November.</p>
<p>I landed at once, and with my son and some of the passengers
set forth on foot in the direction of Mr. Withnall's station on
the Harding, about ten miles from the beach. The day was hot, a
strong burning wind blowing, and, coming from shipboard, we were
not much fit for such exercise, and were obliged to halt about 4
miles from Mr. Withnall's, one man, accompanied by Tommy the
native, going to try and procure us water. Tommy could not travel
all the way, and the man (Schubert, from Roebuck Bay), arrived
alone. We had two Swan River natives with us, but the other
(Johnny), was completely done up.</p>
<p>In the course of two hours Mr. Broadhurst and Mr. Mueller
arrived with a native, bearing a tin-can of water. Mr. Broadhurst
kindly lent me his horse, and I rode to Mr. Withnall's, the
others coming on in a cart. We were kindly received by Mrs.
Withnall, her husband being absent from home at the time.</p>
<p>Acting under the advice of Mr. Broadhurst and others, I
determined to land the horses on the beach, and the stores at the
landing place in Butcher's Inlet, and returned on board.</p>
<p>The horses were landed the next morning, and ever since we
have been discharging cargo. It is slow work, the ship lying
between two and three miles from the spot where the <i>Tien
Tsin</i> discharged, or at the mouth of the inlet, employing but
one of her boats, and taking in water and wool on her own
account. Two days may yet elapse before the ship is cleared of
Government goods. The cargo ought to have been discharged in four
days, for the horses were mostly landed at Roebuck Bay, and much
of the cargo shipped at Camden Harbor was for Perth.</p>
<p>I fixed my quarters on the landing place, leaving Corporal
Benson in charge of stores on board. Although suffering from ill
health, he has continued to make himself very useful, selecting
as far as possible such articles as I require to have landed
speedily. Jackaman is at the Harding, where I intend establishing
my permanent camp. He receives and stores the goods as they
arrive in the carts.</p>
<p>It was my intention to have proceeded at once to Mount Blaze,
having promised Mr. Cowle to meet him there, but I am informed
that for seventy miles between this and the DeGrey there is no
water, so I shall have to wait for rain. Mr. Cowle, if he gets so
far, will be detained at the DeGrey River for the same reason. I
purpose in the mean time visiting the different stations and
making such trips as the water supply will allow.</p>
<p>Our camping ground is on a rising ground above the influence
of the spring tides. I was at one time apprehensive that the
property landed on the banks of the creek about a quarter of a
mile distant, would have been injured by inundation, but Mr. Hall
very kindly made arrangements for carting away to high ground the
perishable articles, and everything is properly secured.</p>
<p>The natives are a fine race of men. Their conduct has, I am
pleased to state, been very good from the first settlement of the
district until the present time. They have been friendly towards
the settlers, and are more willing, as well as able to work than
any natives I have yet met with. For this happy state of affairs
we are indebted to a native named Mullagongh, whose influence is
very great, and who appears to possess a greater share of
intelligence than usually falls to the lot of these men. At Mr.
Hall's request I have granted Mullagongh a passage to Fremantle,
considering that these visits to the more settled parts of the
Colony are calculated to lead to beneficial results.</p>
<p>With the exception of rare and partial showers, this district
has been unvisited by rains for 16 or 18 months, and the supply
of water is less than it has been since the arrival of the
settlers. The flocks are now at a distance from this
neighbourhood, and I have heard fears expressed that it will
become necessary to fall further back. There are, however,
indications of a change. The cattle and horses look in good
condition notwithstanding the parched condition of the
herbage.</p>
<p>The affairs of the Denison Plains Company do not seem to be
more thriving than were those of the Camden Harbor Association,
upon my arrival in February. The shareholders now work on their
own account, and the last of the rations have been divided. There
is, however this difference between the two companies. The stock
of the Camden Harbor people have perished, while the flocks and
herds of the Denison Plains Association are increasing and
thriving. Mr. Broadhurst is I believe, anxiously awaiting the
receipt of more decisive intelligence from Victoria.</p>
<p>When the <i>Kestrel</i> arrived it was reported that the
settlers were short of provisions, and upon enquiry I ascertained
that there was not more than six bags of flour among 105 European
inhabitants. I was asked to relieve their necessities, and should
of course have done all in my power to assist them; but it was
afterwards discovered that there were several tons of flour and
other stores on board the <i>Kestrel</i>, consigned to some of
the settlers, of which, neither they nor myself were aware, and
this, together with provisions purchased from the passengers,
(the savings from the liberal rations furnished by the
Government,) will enable them to get along without borrowing from
us until the arrival of the <i>Mystery</i>, expected some time
next month.</p>
<p>I have found the weather hotter both here and at Cape Villaret
than at Camden Harbor; but the season is advancing and I was not
in Camden Harbor during the height of the summer. The
Thermometrical Returns at Roebuck Bay indicate a generally cooler
temperature than in Camden Harbor.</p>
<p>Not having travelled further than Mr. Withnall's station on
the Harding, I am not in a position to report upon the
capabilities of the country, but hope to do so in my next
communication.</p>
<p>The health of the settlers has been good throughout, and, as
regards my own party, I may state that our health has been, on
the whole, good both at Camden Harbor and this place. Some of the
people were afflicted with trifling ailments at the former
locality, but there were few cases of a serious nature.</p>
<p>I shall be very glad to see police corporal Benson (invalided)
back again. Owing to his illness I had more trouble than usual in
shipping goods at Camden Harbor. I am much, indebted to Mr. Cowle
for the assistance he has rendered me and for his readiness in
volunteering to take charge of the overland party from Roebuck
Bay.</p>
<p>Until I can procure the services of a competent person to keep
and issue the provisions and other stores as well as to keep the
necessary accounts, I shall retain Assistant Storekeeper
Chamberlain, although with our present reduced force so expensive
a public servant is hardly required. The work connected with this
department might at any time have been easily performed by a
quick and intelligent person in two hours daily, taking one day
with another; now it ought not to occupy an hour a-day. Mr.
Chamberlain confines himself entirely to this particular work,
and has been of no assistance to me either in shipping cargo at
Camden Harbor or in landing and storing the goods at this
place.</p>
<p>The conduct of the pensioners, their wives and families, has
been generally good from the time they left Fremantle until I
landed from the <i>Kestrel</i> in Tien Tsin Harbor. They remain
on board that vessel and proceed in her to Fremantle.</p>

<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;The schooner <i>Emma</i>,
.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>It is with sincere pleasure that I inform you of the safe
arrival of Mr. Cowle at the DeGrey. He arrived there on the 3rd
inst., with Mr. Pascoe, Jno. Stainer, and Michael Murphy. He lost
three horses before leaving Roebuck Bay; had to shoot a mare of
his own en route, and another mare, (the property of Mr. Pascoe),
had to be abandoned. His party suffered severely, being several
days without food, and for some time without water. One
man&mdash;Patterson&mdash;was left behind at Roebuck Bay. They
saw four different tribes of natives, who were peaceably
disposed. The country between Roebuck Bay and the DeGrey Mr.
Cowle describes to be well grassed some 15 or 20 miles from the
coast, and he stated that anywhere water could be got by sinking
at a depth of not more than 10 or 12 feet. Thus much I learnt
from Mr. Cowle. Passengers by the <i>Emma</i> state that no river
was discovered; so that between the DeGrey and the Fitzroy there
is no discharge of inland water. I am sorry to hear that Mr.
Cowle was not at all well when the <i>Emma</i> left. As soon as
the party had recovered they were to start for this place, and
may be expected every day. We now know that there is a good
overland route to Roebuck Bay, with available land for pasture;
at all events near the coast. During the wet season it may in all
probability be traversed with facility.</p>
<p>By the <i>Emma</i> will return three men whose time has
expired, P.C. Jackaman (relieved), and Mr. Chamberlain. I shall
require more men for survey and other purposes. As we have now
only one police horse left, I shall want a fresh supply for
police, survey, and general
work.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>

Instructions to the Resident Magistrate of the Northern
District.</span></h3>
<br>
<hr class="tenth">
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">Colonial
Secretary's Office,<br>
Perth January 20,1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have already had the
honor of notifying by my letter of the 30th ult. No. 45-1143,
that His Excellency Governor Hampton had been pleased, subject to
the approval of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the
Colonies, to confer on you the appointment of Government Resident
in the North District of this Colony, and it now becomes my duty,
by the Governor's directions, to lay down for your guidance
general instructions for carrying on the public service in the
very responsible position to which you have been nominated.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;The boundaries of the North District are defined in
the existing Land Regulations, with copies of which you have been
furnished, and settlers have already proceeded to several
localities within its limits; its extent however renders it
impracticable for one Magistrate to exercise jurisdiction over
the whole, and it has been decided you should proceed to Camden
Harbor, to which port several vessels with settlers and stock are
reported to have sailed from the colony of Victoria, and that the
ultimate division of the new country into separate Districts
should be left for further consideration.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;With this view the barquetta <i>Tien Tsin</i> has
been chartered and will be ready to sail on or about the 25th
inst., with the party detailed to accompany you.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;I annex (enclosure No. 1) a nominal list of several
persons who have been directed to proceed with you to your
destination, showing also the rates of salary payable to each
person, and the duties to which they have been specially
appointed; you will distinctly understand that all the persons
named in this list are placed under your authority and control;
that His Excellency looks to you for the enforcement of good
conduct amongst them, and for the efficient discharge of their
respective duties. The necessity of prompt and cheerful obedience
to your wishes and instructions has been carefully impressed upon
them, and it should be your earnest endeavour, by every means in
your power, so to regulate your intercourse with them as to
ensure the existence of those reciprocal friendly feelings,
without which the interests of the public service are sure to
suffer.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;Mr. Assistant Surveyor Phelps has been appointed to
the Commission of the Peace, and, as the person next in rank to
yourself, will, either in the event of any casualty occurring, or
in the case of your illness or absence from Camden Harbor or its
vicinity, assume your duties, reporting his proceedings, with as
little delay as possible, to Head Quarters.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;The men detailed to accompany you have been so
carefully selected that their misconduct is looked upon as a very
improbable event; should, however any misbehaviour or
insubordination unfortunately take place, the Governor looks to
you to take such prompt steps as may at once check such
proceedings, and authorises you to suspend any member of the
party so offending from pay and duly, and to appoint, ponding his
pleasure, such persons as you may find it necessary to engage for
the protection of your party, and the performance of such duties
as you may deem necessary or advisable.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;On board the <i>Tien Tsin</i> your party will be
rationed by the owners of the vessel, in accordance with a scale
and on terms arranged by the Government, and it will form part of
your duty to see that the rations issued are of good quality, in
a proper quantity, and that effective arrangements are provided
for cooking and messing purposes generally. I have already handed
to you a copy of the terms on which the <i>Tien Tsin</i> has been
engaged.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;During the voyage you will issue such instructions as
you may consider to be proper for the comfort and good conduct of
the party under your control, being specially careful that the
rules relating to cleanliness, hours for meals and retiring to
rest, the use of lights, and the non-interference with the crew
of the vessel, are rigidly enforced; and it is desirable you
should instruct your party not to assist in working the vessel,
except at the special request of the Master, and then only under
your instructions.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;You will be furnished with horses for Police and
Survey purposes, and with some sheep, in order that you may have
a supply of fresh meat on landing, and it is, I feel sure
needless to suggest that your special attention should be
directed to the care of the stock during the voyage; regular
watches, day and night, should be appointed; change of food
should be given to the sheep or horses if they appear unwell; and
should they not take to the natural herbage on landing, you will
give them forage, of which an ample supply will be provided.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;Rations for nine months for your whole party will be
placed on board by the Commissariat Department, and will be in
charge of Mr. J. Chamberlain Assistant, Commissariat Storekeeper,
who will issue them, on landing, under your instructions. Each of
the officers and men of your party will be entitled to a free
ration until further orders, but for the rations issued to the
wives and children of Pensioners and Police, a stoppage will be
made at the rate of 6d. per diem for adults, and 3d. per diem for
the children. Considerable supplies other than the daily ration,
will be furnished by the Commissariat, and can be issued under
your orders, but these must all be paid for, at prices to be
previously arranged. A large assortment of medical comforts will
also be placed under your control, to be used in cases of
sickness or emergency.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;Your first duty on arrival at Camden Harbor will be
to land in company with Mr. Assistant Surveyor Phelps, and to
decide on some spot for the location of your party, and the
formation of a depôt. In selecting a locality it is desirable
that a somewhat commanding site should be chosen, not in the
immediate neighbourhood of settlers who may have arrived before
you, nor at so remote a distance as to preclude the rendering
mutual assistance, if necessary; the vicinity of good water
should be a <i>sine quâ non</i>, and if practicable the ground
should be so chosen that a rough fence or stockade could be
erected round it, so as to prevent the possibility of surprise by
sudden attack from the aborigines.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;The first and paramount care will be to see that
your stores of all descriptions are properly housed and
protected, and that a sufficient party are at all times left with
them for their own protection and that of the property entrusted
to them. A wooden house, 30 by 15 feet, and in two compartments,
which can be quickly put together, will be shipped on board the
<i>Tien Tsin</i>, and in addition to a supply of tents for
immediate use, timber for rammed earth quarters for all your
party, with door frames and windows, will be furnished, so that
it is hoped, by exerting all the strength of your party to this
end, it will not be long before you are enabled to report that
the exposure to the sun and rain has not been of long duration. A
due regard to health in the tropics renders this a matter of
primary importance.</p>
<p>13.&mdash;A medical man has not been detailed to accompany the
expedition, because it is understood from a reliable source that
two surgeons have already proceeded thither from Melbourne. In
such case, you are authorised to engage the services of one of
them to attend members of your party on such terms as may appear
to be fair and reasonable. Should it unfortunately prove that no
surgeon is available, His Excellency trusts that the medical
knowledge possessed by you and Mr. Chamberlain, will enable you
to use with judgment and benefit the medicines supplied, which
are in ample quantity and selected by the Principal Medical
Officer, with a due regard to the peculiarities of the climate
and the probable ailments that will be prevalent on the
North-West Coast.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;Prior to conveying the instructions, of His
Excellency the Governor, as to your general proceedings after
your landing has been effected and your stores properly housed, I
am to offer for your guidance, some remarks on the several
official duties of a varied and important nature that will
devolve upon you as the Government Resident of the District.</p>
<p>15.&mdash;You will be provided by the Colonial Treasurer with
a sum of five hundred pounds to meet casual expences, pay wages,
&amp;c., and as the majority of those who accompany you have made
arrangements to draw their salaries in Perth, it is believed this
sum, with the amounts that will probably from time be paid to you
as revenue, will be sufficient for all public purposes for some
considerable period, but in the event of your being pressed for
money to carry on the public service, you are authorised to draw
upon the Colonial Secretary for such an amount as you may
require. It is impassible to issue instructions as to a system of
exchange which can only be regulated by local circumstances, and
it must therefore be left to your judgment and experience. You
must understand that it is considered, advisable that you should
entertain monetary transactions in any form but that of cash
payments, except in the event of your having to draw upon the
Government for money. You will be provided with a secure iron
chest for the safe custody of cash, and though you are at liberty
to oblige others by depositing private monies in it, such
accommodation is only to be afforded at their urgent request, and
in all cases at their own risk. You have already been instructed
to place yourself in communication with the Colonial Treasurer,
who will afford you detailed information as to the mode of
keeping the public accounts, which should have your special care,
and furnish you with the necessary books, forms, &amp;c.</p>
<p>16.&mdash;In the <i>Government Gazette</i> of the 17th
instant, a proclamation appears notifying the declaration of Port
Camden, and this has been done to enable you to carry out the
provisions of the Customs Ordinance of 1860, so far as its
provisions are to be made applicable to the North District. The
boundaries of this Port are extensive, in order that you may have
full scope for determination as to the best places for landing
goods, and for the future erection of bonding storehouses. It
will be your duty to issue notices as to the proper places for
landing goods, and to see that your instructions on this head are
strictly adhered to. It is not proposed at present to levy duties
on imported goods, other than spirits, wines, beer, and tobacco,
on which the usual import duties will be provided such duties
have not previously been paid in the settled Districts, and it is
desirable you should give public notice to this effect, in some
formal manner, as soon as practicable after your arrival. The
Collector of Customs has been instructed to afford to you and to
the Tidewaiter the fullest information on all points connected
with the duties of his Department, and to see that you are
furnished with proper gauging instruments, books, forms, and such
other matters as he may consider to be essential for the due
carrying out of the services to be performed by you.</p>
<p>17.&mdash;The Registration of Births, Deaths, and Marriages,
will not at first prove a duty of a very onerous nature, but it
is advisable you should, at an early date, make yourself
acquainted with the number, sex, ages, and condition of those who
may have arrived at Port Camden, and make the necessity for, and
the mode of registration, generally known. This, and a due
attention to returns of arrivals and departures, will enable you
to compile a correct census of your population at any time with
little trouble, with which it is necessary you should
periodically keep the Registrar-General acquainted. That officer
has been directed to provide you with the customary set of books
and forms, and such information as to the mode of keeping them as
you may require.</p>
<p>18.&mdash;Copies of the Acts of Council, with such books of
legal reference as are likely to be of use to you, will be
supplied, and to enable you summarily to decide cases of debt to
an extent of £50, and thus avoid the spread of litigation or a
reference to the Supreme Court, a Local Court has been
established at the Town of Elliot, in Port Camden, and you have
been appointed the Magistrate thereof. This will probably remain
a dead letter; for some time, but has been inaugurated for the
decision of cases that cannot now be foreseen.</p>
<p>19.&mdash;A sergeant, a corporal, and ten privates of the
Enrolled Pensioner Force have been detailed to accompany the
expedition, and act as a protection to the party, and a guard
over the stores. Definite and precise instructions have been
drawn up by the Honorable the Commandant, showing the duties to
be rendered by them, and the position they hold towards you, and
a copy of these instructions will be handed to you. When not on,
or wanted for, military duty these men can be employed in the
erection of buildings, or such other work as you may decide upon,
and will be paid by you on the spot, at the rates specified in
the instructions adverted to.</p>
<p>20.&mdash;A corporal of Police, with two European and two
native constables, have been placed under orders to proceed in
the <i>Tien Tsin</i> to Camden Harbor, for the performance of the
usual police duties of your District. These men have been
selected not only for their qualities as good bushmen, but as
intelligent, active constables, who will cheerfully carry out
your instructions, not alone as connected with the duties of
their particular department, but in any way you may consider
their services most available. They will be provided with four
horses for riding purposes, with full equipment of saddlery, and
a cart and two draught horses will be shipped for general
service, and can be looked after for the present by the Police,
who will see that a due supply of forage is placed on board the
<i>Tien Tsin</i>. The Superintendent of Police has been directed
to forward for your information a copy of his instructions as to
the departmental duties of these men. The corporal of Police has
also been appointed to act as the Bailiff of the Local Court.</p>
<p>21.&mdash;Mr. T. Sholl, who has been appointed to the office
of Postmaster at Port Camden, in addition to the other duties
that he will assume on arrival thither, has been directed to
report himself to the Postmaster-General, in order to make
himself thoroughly acquainted with the postal duties, and it is
desirable you should see that a proper supply of postage and
official stamps, and other requisites for carrying out the postal
regulations are provided.</p>
<p>22.&mdash;Assistant Surveyors Phelps and Cowle have been
directed to accompany you, with chainers, tents, carts, and four
horses, and will, like all other members of the expedition, be
placed under your orders. I have already informed you that His
Excellency has added the name of Mr. Phelps to the Commission of
the Peace, and that he will assume your duties, in the event of
any casualty or illness disabling you, and the Governor feels
sure that you may depend on receiving the counsel and aid his
experience may enable him to afford, and that on all occasions he
will endeavour to uphold your authority, and assist you in the
discharge of the multifarious and responsible duties devolving on
you. The Honorable the Surveyor General will furnish you with a
copy of the instructions he has issued for the guidance of Mr.
Phelps, in which you will find many valuable hints that will be
of great service to you in the selection of townsites, and in
general routine of your important duties in connection with the
sale and leasing of land, and the location or runs of settlers,
who either have already arrived, or may hereafter arrive, with
stock.</p>
<p>23.&mdash;To assist you in constructing with as little delay
as possible, the necessary buildings for the location of the
members of your party, some laborers and mechanics are to be
hired to accompany you; the nominal list referred to in the
paragraph No. 2, shows the conditions on which they have been
engaged, and the rates at which they are to be paid. These men
are placed entirely under your orders, and it would appear
advisable they should be employed: 1st,&mdash;In assisting in the
temporary location of the party and stores; 2nd,&mdash;In
clearing the bush in the vicinity of the camp; 3rd,&mdash;In
clearing such tracks as may be necessary to and from the camp;
4th,&mdash;In the collecting of material for, and erecting of,
the buildings requisite for housing the party. His Excellency,
however, does not in any way desire to fetter your discretion as
to the manner in which they are to be employed, feeling sure your
good sense and discretion will lead you to put them to the most
advantageous purposes.</p>
<p>24.&mdash;The selection and laying out of a townsite on the
shore of Port Camden or its immediate vicinity, will be one of
the first and most important duties that will devolve upon you,
and in this you will be greatly assisted by Mr. Assistant
Surveyor Phelps, and by the very copious instructions on this
head with which he has been furnished by the Surveyor-General.
Materials for building purposes, means for good drainage, an
ample water supply, adjacent grounds suitable for garden
purposes, and free exposure to the sea breezes, will be matters
not likely to escape your observation when directed to this
object.</p>
<p>25.&mdash;The Regulations for the lease and disposal of land
require your careful attention, as on your arrival you will, in
all probability, be called upon by many persons connected with
the Melbourne Camden Harbour Association to locate them on lands
which they may have selected without reference to the rules
applicable to pastoral lands or to the neighbourhood of proposed
townsites or public reserves. I have handed to you for
presentation to Mr. Meaden, the managing Director of this
Association, a letter addressed to him from my office, enclosing
a copy of a letter to Mr. Harvey, also a Director of the
Association, in which the decision of His Excellency on the
numerous applications received from those gentlemen is clearly
and precisely laid down. A copy of this communication I have also
forwarded for your own guidance in dealing with their
applications. Under, the land regulations, and adhering to the
stipulations laid down in this letter, you are authorized to
approve the applications of persons for free runs of land not
exceeding 100,000 acres for anyone establishment, but, on
consideration of those applications, and prior to their approval,
you will bear in mind, that a preference is to be shown to any
person who may desire to secure land at once by taking in blocks
of 20,000 acres on 8 years' leases, and, with payment at the rate
of five shillings per 1,000 acres. You will be specifically
careful in dealing with applications for free runs from persons
connected with the Camden Harbor Association, to look at them by
the light of the prospectus of that Association. Claims from the
hired servants of that Association cannot be admitted, unless in
each instance a separate establishment is formed. Should there be
conflicting claims for the same run, and in your opinion the
claims of each applicant are equal in every respect, the matter
must be decided by lot. Each applicant for a separate run must
satisfy you that the stock on account of which he claims a run is
<i>bona fide</i> his property. You are further authorised to
approve applications for the purchase of Town, Suburban and
Country lots. Town and Suburban lots are to be sold by public
auction, the former at an upset price of £10 per lot, and the
latter at an upset price of £3 per acre, at periodical times, to
be duly notified by you. Country allotments will be sold during
the first twelve months to the extent of 150,000 acres, at the
rate of 7s. 6d. per acre, under Regulations proclaimed on the
17th instant, and which will be published in the <i>Government
Gazette</i> of the 20th instant, with copies of which you will be
furnished. After twelve months, or within that time, supposing
150,000 acres to have been disposed of, country lands will be
sold at 10s. per acre, under the Regulations of 20th August,
1864. Under the new regulations you will note that, during the
ensuing twelve months, purchasers of country lands to an extent
of 160 acres at 7s. 6d. per acre, will be entitled to one town
allotment at the same rate.</p>
<p>26.&mdash;As a Stipendiary Magistrate, it will be your duty,
assisted when necessary by Mr. Phelps, to administer the law.
Your extensive knowledge of the Acts of Council applicable to
cases of summary jurisdiction renders any remark on this head
unnecessary. Directions have already been issued to supply you
with such numbers of the usual forms applicable to minor Courts,
as you are likely to require for some time.</p>
<p>27.&mdash;The treatment of the aborigines, who are reported to
be troublesome and treacherous, will demand the utmost caution on
your part. The able instructions on this head issued by the South
Australian Government to Colonel Finniss, who has proceeded to
Adam Bay in a somewhat similar capacity to that you are about to
assume, are herewith repeated for your guidance, His Excellency
the Governor feeling that it is impossible better to express the
line of conduct he would wish should be assumed towards the
native inhabitants of the soil you are about to occupy: "Your
duty will be to exercise the greatest caution and forbearance in
communicating with them; to warn your party to studiously avoid
giving them the slightest offence; and should you find them
sufficiently trustworthy to have intercourse with them, or to
enter into any dealings with them, you must insist upon every
transaction being carried out on your part with the most
scrupulous exactness; and, while it may be well to encourage
communication with them, by showing them you are prepared to
trust them, you will take every precaution against their taking
you by surprise, by always being prepared to act upon the
defensive, by keeping regular watch in your camp, and by ordering
your party not to move about the country in small parties, or
unarmed. Above all, you must warn your party to abstain from
anything like hostility towards them, and to avoid the
extremities of a conflict, which must only be had recourse to in
self-defence, and only then from absolute necessity. You will
show them that, while you are anxious to gain their good-will and
confidence by kindness and judicious liberality, you are able to
repel, and, if necessary, punish aggression." As a matter of
precaution, I am directed to impress on you the necessity that,
for some time after your arrival, a line should be drawn around
your camp and distinctly marked, inside of which line no natives
should, on any pretence whatever, be admitted. A large supply of
presents, suitable for the aborigines, has been purchased, and
will be despatched in the <i>Tien Tsin</i>, to be disposed of in
such manner as may seem desirable to you.</p>
<p>28.&mdash;You will not fail to see that Divine Service is
regularly and decently performed, and it will be the duty of all
your party professing the Protestant faith to attend on such
occasions.</p>
<p>29.&mdash;After your party is landed, the <i>Tien Tsin</i>
will return to Fremantle, and it is desirable you should, by that
opportunity, as far as practicable, forward a report containing
your impressions of the coast, the climate and its productions,
the suitability of Port Camden as a resort for shipping, your
general ideas as to the formation of a town, some account of the
proceedings of those who have arrived before you, and any
information of a general nature that may be made available for
intending settlers. You will also not fail to communicate with
head-quarters by every available opportunity, giving a full
account of your proceedings, and of the progress of the
settlement.</p>
<p>30.&mdash;Your correspondence will in all cases be addressed
to the Colonial Secretary, and you will make it known among your
party that no communication that any of them desires to make to
the Government will be acknowledged, unless it be transmitted
through you, in order that you may forward a report thereon for
the information of His Excellency the Governor.</p>
<p>31.&mdash;There is no reason to doubt that on arrival at Port
Camden, you will find a settlement already formed, and from one
to two hundred persons, with a considerable number of stock, in
occupation of the country. It is just possible that exploration
of the coast may have induced them to form a location at some
point not immediately in the neighbourhood of Port Camden, and it
will be for your careful consideration to decide whether it would
be wise to follow the example of those who have preceded you, or
closely to adhere to the instructions to form your Depôt at Port
Camden. On this point it is impossible to issue precise
directions, but His Excellency has full confidence in your
judgment and discretion, feeling assured he may safely leave the
matter in your hands, and that, should you feel it necessary to
deviate from the course laid down, you will be able to afford
good and sufficient reasons for so doing.</p>
<p>32.&mdash;I have endeavoured in the foregoing instructions to
place you fully in possession of the views of His Excellency
Governor Hampton upon the principal points of duty that will
devolve upon you, but their are numerous details into which it is
impossible I should enter, and which, at so great a distance from
head-quarters, can only be decided by yourself. You are to
consider these instructions as for your general guidance; you are
not bound to adhere to them in minute particulars, where
circumstances may occur to justify a departure from them; but
whenever you may decide on any departure from them, you will be
careful to report the cases; and the reasons for such departure,
for the information of His Excellency the Governor. I shall only,
in conclusion, assure you that His Excellency fully relies on
your ability and discretion, and the cheerful obedience of the
members of your party; and while he prays that the blessings of
an All-merciful providence may attend your proceedings, he
commits you to His care, in the firm belief that your expedition
is the first step to the opening of a new and important province
of the Australian Continent, and that you are acting as the
pioneer of future wealth and civilization, beneficial to Western
Australia and the Mother Country.</p>

<br>
<h4>A. Letter from Rev. E. Tanner to R. Sholl.</h4>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">Camden Harbor<br>
February 24, 1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;It is with much pleasure
that I as the Chairman of the Camden Harbor Pastoral Association,
welcome your arrival here with an efficient staff of officers and
servants to carry out the work of the Government of this place.
Inasmuch as it clearly shows the desire of His Excellency the
Governor of Western Australia to promote the interests of the
pioneers of the North Western District of his province; and to
establish amongst us order and good government, principles dear
to every Englishman.</p>
<p>It is however my painful duty to inform you that, after a
residence of upwards of two months in Camden Harbor, I with a
very large majority of the members of the Camden Harbor Pastoral
Association, have arrived at the firm conviction that the country
is unsuitable for the growth of wool; as well in reference to the
ragged natural features of the land, as to the intense heat of
the climate; beside other climatic hindrances.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;In proof of this I beg to observe that 4,500
sheep&mdash;or thereabouts&mdash;were landed here two months
since, and now there are but 1,200 or 1,300 of that number alive.
The deaths have arisen, as I believe, (a), From the intense heat
of the climate, the sheep have not been able to recover from the
fatigues of a sea voyage, (b), The hilly, rocky, and stony
features of the country over which the sheep have to feed, being
beyond their strength, (c), The grasses being of too dry and hard
a nature for them to feed upon, do not contain nourishment
sufficient to keep up, to say nothing of the recovery of their
strength, (d), A large variety of blowflies which are numerous
beyond description, and which deposit their living young upon the
wounds inflicted on the sheep by the native dogs; thereby causing
certain death, (e), In some instances without even a wound, the
backs of the sheep have been discovered to be one mass of living
maggots deposited on the damp wool. Hence the small balance left
are in such a weak and precarious condition, that it is not at
all improbable, numbers of them yet will die, when the heavy
rains set in; being physically unable to contend against the
violent atmospheric phenomena of this climate.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;I have also the honor to inform you that several
parties of explorers have been out looking for country. One party
especially has been out in a direct line as nearly as they can
guess 60 miles. But all have described the country they have seen
as being composed of high rocky ranges of hills, many of them
precipitous, especially in the locality of the Glenelg, and unfit
for occupation. Not but that, here and there, patches of good
country have been seen with grassy flats from 1,000 to 3,000
acres in extent, but they are so situated that even if it were
possible to drive sheep on to them, no stores could be conveyed
up, or wool brought back, because of the peculiar rugged
formation of the land. Moreover these good patches being thus
surrounded by impracticable country, and of themselves being far
too small in extent for a Station, they are thus so far as the
purposes of the Camden Harbor Pastoral Association are concerned
entirely unsuited to their wants. This description will apply in
its general sense to the district of the Gairdner River, the
Glenelg River, the country round about Mount King, and to the
region of Doubtful Bay. Hence, so the whole district of Camden
Harbor.</p>
<p>I must not omit to notice that all the explorers speak of the
very great scarcity of game. Especially the party which have been
furthest out, who say that they saw not a dozen kangaroo, or
turkey during the twelve days they were out. But they shot two
cockatoos and one pigeon, being all or nearly all the game they
saw. Thus by an acknowledged rule of judging the condition of
Bush Lands, 'there being few or no game, the country is not
sufficiently productive of food to support them,' hence it is not
fit for the depasturage of sheep and cattle. With these facts
before us proved by practical observation, it is the fixed
determination of a majority, if not all, of the members of the
Camden Harbor Pastoral Association to abandon the district of
Camden Harbor by the first available opportunity.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;I also further observe that it was upon the
statements set forth in the several pamphlets sent by the Perth
Government to our Association in Melbourne, that the members
thereof resolved to settle at Camden Harbor. They now by actual
observation and practical experience find that the country and
its adaptability for sheep farming are not such as are set forth
in those pamphlets. It is not with the object of complaint that I
make this statement, but to show that I feel we have a just claim
upon the sympathy of the Government of Western Australia in our
present condition. A condition, Sir, entirely induced by the
statements made in the pamphlets set forth by the authority of
the Government of Western Australia.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;It is therefore, Sir, with much respect for your
position here as Government Resident, that I shall trespass a
short time longer upon your time and patience, while I lay before
you the requests I have to make.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;The members of this Association have all been induced
to come here under the conviction that 40 head of sheep landed in
the Northern Territory would represent a claim to a lease of run
of 20,000 acres. A copy of a letter from your Government is now
in possession of Mr. Meadon, one of the members of the Committee
of the Camden Harbor Pastoral Association is the authority on
which we based our conviction. Now the official letter sent by
your Government to our acting secretary, Mr. Meadon, allows only
10,000 acres for 40 sheep per share.</p>
<p>Such being the case, I at once unhesitatingly say that a block
of 10,000 acres is not a sufficient area in extent of land to
constitute a sheep run in the district of Camden Harbor, and must
be abandoned on the principle that "the first loss is the best,"
if the former condition of 20,000 acres be not conceded to us.
Speaking advisedly, I can say that every member of one share
only, will leave the country by the first opportunity. I would,
Sir, be very sorry to write to you in a tone which would give you
the impression that I was holding out a threat to you&mdash;that
if such and such concessions were not made to us, we would act
thus and thus; I trust you will credit me with the truth when I
say I have too great a reverence for properly recognized
authority to do that. But as it is always well to speak well, and
to do so is to speak plainly. May I not therefore suggest with
every respect for the regulations of your Government that each
share of 40 sheep shall represent 20,000 acres.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Such being granted, I have another boon to
ask&mdash;which is, that the right to take up runs of 20,000
acres for 40 sheep landed in the Northern Territory of Western
Australia, that is in Camden Harbor, be transferred to the
district of Nickol Bay, or other portion of the North Western
Territory, upon the application of those members of the Camden
Harbor Pastoral Association who, resolving to leave Camden Harbor
may desire to settle down on a more eligible country. The landing
of the sheep in Camden Harbor to be considered in "bona fide" as
if landed at Nickol Bay or elsewhere.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;In conclusion, allow me to say that the natural
features of Camden Harbor are such that it is adapted neither for
the depasture of sheep and cattle, or for cultivation. For
except, on the <i>water-washed</i> flats of hungry soil composed
mainly of disintegrated quartz, and decomposed sand stone, I have
not seen one square acre of soil in one continuous block in which
the plough could be used. There are however on the banks of the
Gairdner River some rich alluvial flats, but are covered deep at
each flood; and these as well as those on the Glenelg River are
so boggy that they are dangerous for a horseman to venture upon.
Immediately after the first rains in January last, I planted
french beans, peas, melons, cucumbers and other vegetables; none
of them have succeeded. The residue are a few straggling sickly
water melons. This may perhaps be accounted for by its not being
the right season for planting seeds. Banana, Ginger, and pine
apple plants which have been also put into a well and deeply dug
plot of ground have succeeded but very badly. Maize came up and
grew to about 6 inches in height and then died. The soil is not
rich&mdash;it has the appearance and consistency of well burnt
brick earth; nor have been seen any of those exceedingly rich
alluvial flats spoken of in the pamphlets published in Perth,
though the country has been well searched to an area of 12 miles
in extent around the harbor. Time has not allowed us to judge of
the continuance of green grass. When we landed in Dec. the aspect
of the country was that of a dry barren scorched up desert; since
then there have been some rains, and grass has sprung up and
clothed the hill sides with luxuriant verdure, hiding the stones
and small boulders which cover the whole ground as if they had
been ejected from a volcano. This grass is now as high as when we
landed in December last. The conjecture then is, that during the
cool season the grass will keep green, but that from (say) August
to January it is dry and parched up, as we found it last
December, devoid of nourishment, and therefore of no possible use
as feed for sheep to support life with under the heat of the
torrid zone. This however I imagine not to be the natural
condition of the country comprising the Northern Territory, but
the peculiar condition of a district which without exaggeration,
is composed entirely of <i>heaps upon heaps</i> of red vitrified
stones, reflecting with increased ferocity the glare and heat of
a tropical sun.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;Allow me, Sir, to say further, that the desire of the
majority of the members of the Camden Harbor Pastoral
Association, is to settle down "in bona fide" as sheep farmers,
and would therefore far prefer to locate themselves on some
eligible country for that purpose, than to return to Melbourne,
if there is a reasonable prospect of being successful in Western
Australia. They have already in this expedition sunk £20,000,
more or less, as a proof of their sincerity of purpose. Many of
the members represent and belong to large and wealthy squatting
and business firms in Victoria, which are only waiting the
intelligence they may receive from us to forward sheep and all
the requisites for large squatting stations in North West
Australia.</p>
<p>I have, Sir, to apologize to you for the length of this
letter, my only plea is the urgency of the case. As the
recognized head of the Camden Harbor Pastoral Association. I feel
deep sorrow at the failure of its intentions, and earnest desire
to remedy the evil, and to promote as far as I can the interests
of every individual member of the same.</p>

<h4>B. Letter, R. Sholl to Rev. E. Tanner.</h4>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">Camden Harbor<br>
25th February, 1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th Instant, in
which, as Chairmen of the Camden Harbor Pastoral Association,
you, on the part of the Shareholders of that Association, make
certain statements and prefer certain queries which demand
immediate attention on my part.</p>
<p>Before however I discuss the main portion of your letter, I
must express my thanks for the hearty manner with which you have
welcomed my presence and that of my party in the district, and
also to express my gratification at the earnest desire exhibited
for the establishment of order and good Government in this remote
portion of Her Majesty's dominions.</p>
<p>You state truly that the presence of my party in this locality
is evidence of the desire of His Excellency the Governor to
promote the interests of the pioneers of the North Western
District. I can, from my own personal knowledge, assert that the
Governor has invariably evinced a lively interest in the
settlement of this portion of the Colony, and when he received
authentic intelligence of the departure of settlers to Camden
Harbor, as soon as the means of Transport were attainable,
organized and despatched at great cost, the present
expedition.</p>
<p>He will, I am sure, learn with as much surprise and regret,
that you report after a residence of upwards of two months in
Camden Harbor, that the country in its vicinity is not adapted
for the growth of wool, as from the statements of explorers he,
in common with others, had arrived at an opposite conclusion. The
evidence however contained in your letter respecting the fate of
the stock imported by your Association supported as it is by
facts, can leave no doubt either that the present site is not
adapted for the purpose, or that the season has been purely
exceptional and prejudicial.</p>
<p>Since my arrival I have been informed that for several days
after landing you were unable to discover water for your stock,
and I can bear testimony to the difficulty experienced in
discovering a spot containing sufficient water for my party and
the few head of stock belonging to us. Now, we know that all who
have preceded us have found abundance of this essential, and the
heavy rains which have just set in are sufficient to assure us
that, as a general rule, water is easily attainable and abundant.
I believe that future explorers will find ho difficulty on this
score at any season of the year, and that settlers are more
likely to be inconvenienced by an excess than a short supply of
water.</p>
<p>The country on the sea coast I can from my personal
observation state to be utterly unfit for any stock, except
perhaps goats of a very hardy nature. The land is too rocky and
the grass too coarse and innutritious to satisfy animals not
thoroughly acclimatised.</p>
<p>Owing to my own personal superintendence being necessary
during the landing of stores and the location of my party, I have
not been able to give my own experience with respect to the
interior of the country, and regret that the accounts of your
explorers should differ so materially from those of Grey and
other travellers; for if the country is of the nature you
describe it would scarcely be advisable to take up land for
pastoral occupation, or to form any permanent establishment in
the district. It will be my duty when our party is settled to
examine the country and judge from personal observation.</p>
<p>With respect to the erroneous impression conveyed by the
perusal of pamphlets sent by the Government of Western Australia,
I have to observe, that those works were forwarded for the
purpose of giving all the information, at the disposal of the
Government, without any guarantee of their correctness. That the
Government considered the statements therein contained to be
reliable, is evidenced by the presence of a Government Staff in
the district. Had the letter to which I have now the honor to
reply been received by the authorities at Perth, instead of by
myself at Camden Harbor, the prospect of a government
establishment being formed at Camden Harbor would have been very
remote.</p>
<p>With reference to section No. 5 of your letter, where you
state that the members of the Association were led to believe
that 40 head of sheep landed in the Northern Territory would
represent a claim to a lease of 20,000 acres of land, and that
they were led to form this opinion from the tenor of a letter
from the Government of this colony, a copy of which is now in the
possession of Mr. Meadon, I can only state that I have not been
instructed of the dispatch of such letter, and that I cannot
recognize any document at variance with my instructions, and the
letter from our Government forwarded to Mr. Meadon. These letters
and the land regulations of Western Australia will be my guides
in leasing lands in this district.</p>
<p>I am by these empowered to grant licences or leases in
conformity with the regulations relative to the disposal of land
in the north and east districts of the colony, viz.:&mdash;for
100,000 acres of land for every 200 head of small or 100 head of
large stock belonging to one establishment. I am also enabled by
the tenor of the letters of our Colonial Secretary to Mr. Harvey,
to permit the occupation of land to the extent of 10,000 acres of
land for every 40 small or 20 large stock landed; and I can also
grant blocks of 20,000 acres of land on 8 years leases, upon
annual payment at the rate of 5s. per 1,000 acres, together with
a fee of £5 for each lease. I beg you to note that applicants for
such blocks of 20,000 acres will have a preferential claim.</p>
<p>Your request that the right to take up 20,000 acres of land
for every 40 sheep landed at Camden Harbor be transferred to
Nickol Bay, cannot I fear be granted, inasmuch as our Government
do not recognise the "right" to take up runs of 20,000 for that
quantity of stock, but 10,000 acres. Applicants for a less amount
than 100,000 acres stocked in the proportion of 4 sheep for every
1,000 acres, will however, should they desire to have this right
of selection transferred to the Nickol Bay territory, have their
applications forwarded to His Excellency the Governor, who will
deal with them in that liberal spirit which has characterised his
government in all matters connected with the disposal of crown
lands. I shall feel obliged if those applicants will furnish me
with particulars respecting their means of removal to Nickol Bay
with their stock, and of maintaining their establishment at that
place, in order that I may forward the same with the applications
for transfer for the Governor's consideration. I have no power of
myself to grant such request.</p>
<p>I beg to state that your letter will be forwarded to the
Governor of this colony by the first opportunity, accompanied by
such remarks as the matters referred to may render necessary.</p>
<p>I cannot conclude without expressing my deep sympathy with the
members of your Association, who have suffered so severely and
who have borne so patiently.</p>
<p>At the commencement of your letter you were good enough to
welcome the arrival of a Government Staff to establish among you
order and government. Allow me in return, Sir, to express the
gratification I experienced to find that during their sojourn in
this district, order and good government have been so well
maintained by the members of your Association without official
interference. When I consider that all the settlers have been so
grievously disappointed, that many have incurred losses from
which they will take long to recover, and that they have endured
privations of no ordinary nature, I cannot but feel surprised
that good order has been universally the rule. Of such, men any
colony might be proud, and I do most earnestly hope that they may
yet be enabled to occupy land in some portion of North West
Australia.</p>
<p>Believe me that it is from no feeling of unkindness or from
want of courtesy that I have not yet visited your camp. My first
duty is to see our party properly housed and every preparation
made for their comfort and security. You, Sir, and the gentlemen
with whom you are associated having had experience of the nature
of the work in which I am engaged will, I am sure, pardon any
apparent remissness on my part. And I beg to assure you that as
soon as I have landed my stores and housed my people I shall take
the earliest opportunity of visiting those whose disappointments
demand my sympathies and whose conduct demands my esteem.</p>

<p><i>Monday, April</i> 10<i>th</i>. 1865.&mdash;Immediately
after leaving the camp we ascended a hill to the south-east, very
stony and rocky, yet, as usual, clothed with grass; and for about
an hour we travelled over country of a similar description, yet
with hills gradually decreasing in height. The country was
lightly timbered with eucalyptus, cork, and cotton trees, all of
small diameter. The hills we passed over might, I conceive, be
made passable for carts with very little labour. Everywhere we
passed through grass, the country presenting the appearance of a
wheat-field, the grass being generally above the horses' bellies,
and occasionally even above the heads of the riders. From the
summit of the highest hill we had a splendid view of Camden
Harbour, with its islands and headlands to our right and rear,
with Mount King in the distance to our right and front. The
baobab described by Dr. Martin is situated in flat country; and,
indeed, after leaving the hills in rear of our camp, we travelled
over tolerably level country, occasionally undulating with
ironstone gravel, having the appearance of being waterwashed in
heavy floods. The ground was in places very soft, and must be
boggy during the winter season. I do not consider that we have
had a winter, or rather rainy season, this year. About a mile on
our course from the marked baobab we passed over several gullies,
with quartz scattered among the gravel. After leaving this
country we ascended some tolerably elevated ground, from which we
saw Mount Lookover, Port George IV., and Augustus Water, in our
rear; and Mount King to the south-west. Mount Lyell lay to the
south-east of us, and was plainly seen. Passing over the level
country we saw several kangaroos. The land was still lightly
timbered with eucalyptus, what is here named the cork-tree,
cotton-tree, box-tree, and, where the ground was particularly
soft, cabbage-palms.</p>
<p>Shortly before our midday halt we commenced crossing the
Hampton Downs, which, at this particular spot, was not so well
grassed as the country we had previously passed over, but it
gradually improved. We encamped at noon, amidst abundance of
feed, on the bank of a stream which I thought to be a branch or
tributary of the Gairdner River. We had previously passed over a
larger stream, with somewhat boggy approaches, and having on its
banks, where we crossed, a small thicket of palms, an eucalyptus,
with large broad leaves, and other shrubs and trees more vividly
green and throwing more shade than is generally found in Western
Australia. These streams evidently took their rise in the
McDonald range, and ultimately joined the Gairdner. They were
shallow, but during the rainy season these, as well as many dry
stream-beds which we crossed, must contain a large body of water.
The stream upon which we camped was running to the southward. We
bivouacked under what is here called the currant-tree, about 9 or
10 feet high, greyish striated bark, with twisted branches. The
leaf is bright-green, smooth on the upper surface, 5 inches long,
and 1 to 1½ inch broad. The fruit has a pleasant acid
taste&mdash;black when ripe. It is of the size of a very small
currant, and, like most Australian fruits, has more stone than
flesh. It grows in small bunches, the fruit being in different
stages of maturity, green, red, and black. The stone or seed is
of a flat, oval shape. The branches appear to be adapted for
boat-knees, being light and tough. Close by there was another
tree, altogether unlike what I have seen elsewhere. It was a
tall, rough-barked young tree. The branches do not spread, but
take an upward direction, and the leaves spring from the smaller
branches in fours. They were pointed, about 2½ inches long and ¾
inch broad in their widest part, or the centre; they are of a
light-green colour. The tree was about 10 inches diameter at the
butt, or thickest part. There was also near us the everlasting
eucalyptus, with its smooth white stem and branches. The grass at
this place was principally kangaroo-grass. More birds were seen
on our way than we have met with at the camp. They were
principally pigeons, of a brown colour, but not
bronze-winged.</p>
<p>Started at 3 o'clock, by which time the sun was less powerful.
Our party now consisted of eight,* with four packhorses, and we
made a track, going in single file, which will last for some
time. We steered an east course through Hampton Downs&mdash;a
well-watered country: creeks, running in the direction of the
Gairdner, being crossed every half or three-quarters of an hour.
The land was undulating, composed of ironstone, sand, and clay
alternately, and occasionally&mdash;especially near some of the
creeks&mdash;of alluvial soil. Whatever the soil might be, there
was no lack of grass. In crossing some of the streams, the ground
was soft&mdash;almost boggy, and at the chosen fording-place of a
branch of the Gairdner Mr. McRae's horse was so far bogged as to
oblige him to dismount. To the southward of us there was a
prominent hill, which the settlers have named Mount Batten, and
near it was the elevated termination of a piece of high
table-land, looking, until we came closer to it, like a detached
hill. They are conspicuous landmarks. We halted for the night on
the left bank of the Gairdner, a small stream at this season,
with boggy approaches where we crossed it. The banks were fringed
with palms. Our halting-place was about 10 miles distant from the
camp. During the day I saw more grass than I have seen in any
part of Western Australia; most of it kangaroo-grass, and some a
reedlike grass, of a coarse nature. Some of the grasses,
especially those on swampy land, were sedgy. The day was
tolerably cool throughout.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Namely Sholl, Assistant Surveyor James Cowle,
P.C. Jackaman, native constable Billy and Chainer John Graham,
together with Alex. McRae, Jacob Hindhaugh and Daniel Hick of the
Camden Harbour Pastoral Association; <span class=
"aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p><i>April</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at 20 minutes to 6,
and steered an easterly course for about an hour, and then E. by
S. until 9 o'clock, when we again resumed our easterly route to
obtain a pass through the hills. All the country passed over was
well grassed, and the soil not so stony as that travelled over
yesterday. On the banks and in the immediate neighbourhood of the
streams there was rich alluvial soil. About an hour after leaving
our halting-place crossed a stream larger than that near which we
camped last night. We went over some very soft, boggy ground, and
had to pick our way carefully; but these places could be seen
and, to a great extent, avoided. Not so with the "dry bogs", as
they are termed. The ground is apparently firm&mdash;clay, with
ironstone gravel&mdash;but is completely undermined. The horses
plunged continually up to their knees, and no amount of care or
circumspection could prevent this. The "dry bogs" were in patches
over some four or five miles of country in our course. We skirted
Mount Lyell, a two-peaked hill; the distance between either peak
being being about 1 mile. Halted on the banks of a stream at 10
o'clock, Mount Lyell bearing S.S.E., and distant about 2 miles.
We passed through a perfect thicket of reed-grass, growing high
above our heads; but generally the pasture consisted of
kangaroo-grass, very thick and very high. The horses, when camped
in the high grass, generally wandered to feed off less luxuriant
growth. Before this country becomes available to its full extent
for stock, the long grass will have to be burnt or cut down; it
will never be eaten down. It may be trampled down, and allow room
for the young grass to spring; but in its present state the feed
has no attraction&mdash;for horse-stock, at all events. The whole
of the land was lightly timbered with broad-leaved gum-trees,
cotton, cork, and box trees, all of slight girth. At 9 o'clock we
rode up a hill to look at the country. Mount Lyell was to the
south of east, and not far off. We had a good view all round,
embracing the valleys of the Glenelg and Prince Regent rivers.
Our course was through Mr. McRae's run and the Hampton Downs, the
greater portion of which are included in this run. The Hampton
Downs are all they have been described&mdash;well watered and
good feed. The stream upon which we were encamped was running
through the Glenelg. Mr. Cowle stated our position to be lat. 15°
57', long. 124° 59'. Left this place at 3 <span class=
"aa">p.m.</span>, and passed through a splendidly-grassed
country. The land improved very much, there being less stone and
more alluvial. As we neared the Glenelg the trees increased in
girth, but they were still scattered. There was no undergrowth of
scrub, nothing but grass. We had some difficulty in crossing the
numerous watercourses, some of them being very boggy. If we could
have seen our way the impediment would not have been heeded, but
the thick and high sward of grass concealed everything. We camped
for the night on a stream a few miles from the Glenelg, upon a
plain of ironstone gravel and quartz, but with the usual
abundance of feed. We estimate the distance travelled to be 15
miles. Both peaks of Mount Lyell were bare, the reddish-brown
rock alone being visible. Grass appeared on the slopes, and at
the base some light timber. During the day we saw some native
plum-trees; the fruit exactly resembles a small plum, larger than
a sloe. I was told that the fruit was intensely bitter. I could
only secure one plum, and, content with the account given by
others, did not taste it.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Had a sleepless night, the
mosquitoes being on the <i>qui vive</i> until daylight. We
proceeded towards the Glenelg, steering about due south, as
indeed we had done from our halting-place at noon yesterday.
Crossed several streams flowing towards the Glenelg, which were
more difficult to pass than those farther north, the grass being
higher and thicker, and the stream-beds more soft. Mr. McRae,
however, was a first-rate pioneer, and, after some trouble, we
arrived on the banks of the Glenelg, at a spot where it was
divided into two branches; both united lower down, leaving a
small island between the two. This we followed for a about half a
mile, when we came to some rapids; and at this spot the stream we
struck was united to the main branch. The united streams were
about 60 yards wide; but in the rainy season the river must be of
considerable size, as there was abundant evidence of the flow of
a large body of water. The soil on the bank is alluvial, in the
bed of the river sandy and rocky. We crossed at the rapids
without wetting our feet&mdash;the water was not, in fact, above
the horses' knees&mdash;and then proceeded south for about half a
mile, where I determined to form my permanent depôt on the banks
of a stream running into the Glenelg, with abundance of feed,
plenty of firewood, sufficient shade, and, in fact, all that we
require for the purpose. Our small tent was placed facing the
south&mdash;our destined course&mdash;where at the distance of
about a mile rise the Whately Hills. We arrived at this spot at
10 <span class="aa">a.m.</span> The country is generally
gravelly, with occasional outcroppings of rock, and here and
there patches of alluvial soil. There was no difference either in
the character or quantity of the grass, while the trees and
shrubs were of the same description as those we had passed
before, except that at the Glenelg we again met with the baobab,
though not of so large a size as those near our camp. On the
banks of the river were paper-bark trees, lofty but of no great
girth, the thickest not being more than 10 or 12 inches diameter.
The foliage was similar in shape to that of the eucalypti, and
possessed the same aromatic flavour. There were also some trees
of moderate height, more umbrageous than the generality of
Australian trees. They had a rough blackish bark, the leaves were
dark and large, the trees bore a fruit not in shape unlike a
large white-heart strawberry, of a yellow-white colour. The
settlers called it the mulberry-tree, and say the fruit when ripe
is not unpleasant. What I tasted were acrid. Between our
depôt-camp and the Glenelg we started a kangaroo, and on the
banks of the river saw a flock of black cockatoos, apparently
similar to those farther south. At our own depôt the hawks, which
swarm to such an extent at Government Camp, began to collect,
There were a few sand-flies and mosquitoes, but not swarming, as
they did at our bivouac the night before. Cool day.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;At a little before 7
<span class="aa">a.m.</span> Mr. Cowle and myself, accompanied by
Messrs. McRae, Hindhaugh, Hick, and the native Billy, started on
our first exploratory trip in the Ranges. We followed up the
gully on which we were encamped for about an hour and a half, our
course being easterly, with a little southing. The country was
generally rough and occasionally boggy. Crossed the stream-bed
more than once, the fords being boulders of slippery rock, over
which the waters dashed. At its source we finally left the stream
and vainly attempted to make south, but the hills, for the most
part precipitous sandstone elevations, barred our progress. We
dismounted and walked up one of the hills, leaving Billy in
charge of the horses. The hill was of sandstone, with trap or
basalt at the base. From the summit the country looked very
rugged, especially in our course&mdash;south&mdash;the hills
being tumbled together without any regard to arrangement, while
the valleys were as rock-strewn as the hills. On this hill was a
solitary pine&mdash;we had previously seen a few. It was not
large, being from 12 to 15 inches diameter, and of moderate
height. Descending, we tried our best to round the hills, but
were baffled by the fearful country. Following on every occasion
every valley which trended anywhere near our course, we were
continually driven back by insurmountable barriers of rock. The
valleys, in fact, were for the most part ravines, or ended in
ravines; the hills coming down on either side, and allowing but a
few feet of level country, if it can be called level where masses
of rock of every conceivable size, shape, and angle, are strewn
over the narrow path. The poor horses were tumbling, jumping, and
sliding every minute, their legs and feet bleeding from the sharp
rocks. After all this labour, towards midday we found ourselves
not more than 5 miles from depôt, with no prospect of getting
farther south in this direction. Before our noon-halt we tried to
make the Glenelg by starting north and east, but failing,
bivouacked in a small grass-flat surrounded by rocks, with a
streamlet flowing through the centre. We passed along several of
these flats during our morning journey. They were generally well
grassed, and the soil was red loam, but they were all of very
limited extent. Grass as usual was abundant in the most stony
portions, and I only saw spinifex among the crevices of the
otherwise bare blocks of sandstone. Starting at a quarter to 2
<span class="aa">p.m.</span> we pursued a generally north route,
sometimes a little to the east or west, according to the course
of the ravines. We were now gradually descending, having during
the former part of the day been going up-hill&mdash;sometimes
imperceptibly, at others 30 and 40 feet in the course of a
hundred yards. We passed through masses of sandstone, assuming
fantastic shapes and forms, requiring but little effort of the
imagination to give them "a local habitation and a name." One
plot of rock-scattered ground bore a marked resemblance to a
ruined churchyard. The broken headstone, the dilapidated
monument, the shivered pillar and fragments of sepulchral
architecture&mdash;all were there, while some of the blocks were
sharp in outline, and perfect as if they had just left the
stone-cutter's yard. At half-past 2, although we had since our
noontide halt been travelling downwards, we were still on very
high ground, with the River Glenelg some hundred feet below us,
the descent being a perpendicular wall of rock; on the opposite
side were hills of equal height and of equal steepness. Here
there were rapids. The course of the river was north and south,
taking, shortly from the spot where we were stationed, a turn to
the eastward, and afterwards a south-east direction. As there was
no chance of descending to the river at this spot, we followed a
course a little to the eastward of north, and travelling down a
ravine, the most steep, the most rugged, and the most lengthy of
any we had hitherto travelled, and which punished the horses very
severely, we emerged upon the level country south of the Glenelg,
and struck that river about a quarter of a mile above the rapids
which we crossed yesterday, and about two miles below the spot
where its course was from south to north. At these rapids its
direction was westerly. From the rapids we proceeded to the
depôt-camp, which we reached at 5 o'clock. My companions stated
that the country was more rugged than any they had previously
passed over, and they had all more or less had. some experience
of rough land; one of them, indeed, had travelled through the
elevated Gipp's Land territory. If our journey was fatiguing it
was not otherwise unpleasant. The day was fine and cool; we had
abundance of water; the scenery was not only novel, but extremely
picturesque and often magnificent. A good bathe in the depôt
creek soon restored energy and strength, and without being damped
by our non-success, we discussed the probable proceedings of the
morrow. Seeing the impossibility of penetrating the ranges in the
direction we had pursued, we resolved to take a south-westerly
course as far as practicable.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;A fine morning, but the flies,
as usual, very troublesome. We went round the west end of Whately
Range, travelling through more rugged country than even
yesterday, but there was not so much of it. We wandered about for
some little time, striving to penetrate through the hills, and
struck the river, pursuing a course a little to the northward of
east. The Glenelg was here running south. The cliffs came down to
the water's edge on either side, and we had not gone far along
the bank before our way was stopped, We therefore pushed up the
range, following the ravines and valleys, and steering south
wherever we had a chance. The country was in every respect
similar to that which we traversed yesterday, except that the
valleys were not so well grassed, and there was more spinifex.
After clearing the hills we passed over some tolerably level
table-land, sandy, and thinly grassed, and at half-past 11 struck
a large stream, which we took at first for the Glenelg, but, as
it was flowing north, it was evidently a tributary. This stream I
named, subject to the Governor's approval, the McRae, after one
of my companions, a gentleman who had been of signal service to
us throughout the expedition, the river, where we struck it, was
82½ yards wide from bank to bank, but the actual stream of water
did not exceed 20 yards, or, at the furthest, 25 yards. On a
ledge of rock overhanging the river, we bivouacked; the horses
looking at, but not touching, the spinifex. A spring of water
burst from the rock, and formed a small stream, from whence we
got a supply for ourselves and horses. On either side the rocks
lined the river, but the hills were of no very great height.
Among the plants in the neighbourhood I noticed the
hollyhock&mdash;very similar to our own in leaf and flower; and
the honeysuckle, red and white flowers, but scentless. The trees
here, and in fact throughout the ranges where we have been, are
eucalypti, casuarina, acacia, cotton, cork, box, and palms. Also
some trees bearing a fruit resembling in appearance, when ripe, a
russet apple, and, when unripe, a smooth green apple. It was
intensely bitter, and contained a large stone&mdash;in fact, it
was nearly all stone. There were some splendid lilies in the
river, which emitted a perfume like the violet. They were of
different colours&mdash;white, pink, and blue&mdash;the two
latter light tints, as if the original white had been stained
with colour. The river must rise in the ranges which we see to
the southward, and will most probably furnish a pass through
them. We could not, however, proceed in that direction to-day, in
consequence of Mr. Cowle's horse having cut his leg too severely
to travel. In fact, all our horses were more or less maimed. We
started a kangaroo, but with so large a party it is next to
impossible to get near enough to have a shot. On our return route
we took a north-easterly course, following down a brook which we
crossed on our outward trip, and which was descended by our
horses with very great difficulty, owing to the steepness and
rocky nature of its bed. Before arriving at this brook we crossed
the sandy table-land of our outward track, above a mile to the
southward and eastward, and found it thinly clothed with grass.
We passed the Whately Range (by following the before-named brook)
to the westward of a detached hill on the eastern point of the
mountains. We left the McRae at 2 o'clock, and arrived at depôt
camp at half-past 3. All the flat lands over which we have
passed&mdash;and they are not many, and limited in
extent&mdash;possess a soil of either sand or ironstone gravel,
sometimes of both. The great peculiarity here, as well as in the
land to the north of the Glenelg, is the total absence of
undergrowth bushes; between the widely separated thin and short
trees there is nothing but grass and creepers. Let it be thin or
thick, good or bad, tall or short, still it is grass. The trees
were generally of small girth; the largest we have yet seen did
not exceed 15 inches diameter, and trees of this size were very
rare. The baobab-trees of course are exceptions, for they, on the
other hand, are of enormous circumference; but after leaving the
tree named in my first day's journal, we did not see another
until we came to the Glenelg, and then we met with a few. There
is one or two near our depôt camp. They are an unfailing sign of
water&mdash;not necessarily surface water, but of water at a
short distance from the surface. They are more plentiful near the
government camp than I have seen elsewhere. Looking through the
opening at the back of my tent, I see two as I am now writing, of
noble girth, but not so large as others. Between the camp and the
well, and along the now dry bed of the watercourse which supplied
us when we first landed, and until lately, there were several,
and this makes me the more confident that there will be no great
difficulty in obtaining water at the driest season. The palms are
generally indicative of surface water, and grow in soft swampy
land, and upon the margins of rivers and streams. In travelling
along, whenever we saw palms in our course, we prepared to
flounder through soft or boggy ground, and in nine cases out of
ten the ground was either the one or the other. The sandstones in
the ranges have every variety of size, form, and colour. From
blocks weighing hundreds of tons to pieces weighing a few grains;
in shape, columnar, tabular, pyramidal, in pavement blocks, like
gigantic walls, with every line separating each block, as level
and as closely cut as if placed there by human agency, like
ruined castles, with towers and battlements&mdash;half defined
and half defaced, massive boulders, and pebbles of the size of
marbles; lying in every attitude, presenting angles in every
possible position, they seemed like the remains of cities, built
by giants, and scattered abroad in some great convulsion of
nature. The hues of the rock are varied to a degree&mdash;dark
brown, light brown, yellowish brown, yellow, white, red of
different shades; sometimes several colours in the same rock.
Again, while many rocks are clothed with grass, others are quite
bare. We have thus anything but monotony among the ranges. Owing
to the cause before stated, we could not make a good day's work,
and our extreme distance south was not more than three miles, but
the horses were nevertheless much bruised, and cut about the
legs, and seemed to have had enough of it; so I determined to
halt to-morrow (Saturday), and, as a matter of course, on the
succeeding day, and then make a three days' trip, as there
appears at last, to be a chance of making some southing. We had a
tolerably cool day, and in fact when we got among the hills the
change of temperature for the better was invariably marked. Upon
examining the map, it would appear either that we are not on the
rapids named by Grey (at the spot where the river bends to the
southward), or that the Whately Range, or the river itself, is
incorrectly laid down. Our depôt camp is about three-quarters of
a mile south-west of the rapids, and the range faces us about
half a mile, or from that to a mile distant, its position being
east and west. To the eastward, half a mile's travelling brings
us to the eastern end of the small detached hill round which we
passed on our return trip this morning, and by going a mile to
the westward, we came round the western point of the range. From
a mile and three-quarters to two miles is the extent of the range
facing us to the south, neither end of which, east or west, is
distant more than a mile from the River Glenelg. According to the
map, our present position is two miles to the eastward of the
range, or in fact on the opposite bank of the Glenelg. We are on
a peninsula, hemmed in by the river on every side, except south,
with a point or two east or west of south; and such a peninsula!
except the flat upon which we are encamped, which extends back to
the rapids, and up and down the river for a limited extent, the
country is one mass of sandstones, of more or less elevation. Mr.
Cowle informed me that he was not yet perfectly satisfied of our
exact position, but he was inclined to believe that we were not
on the rapids described by Grey. We saw no marked trees, nor any
other sign of Grey's party.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;To-day was the hottest we have
experienced since leaving Camden Harbour, the weather having been
generally cool&mdash;much cooler than I have experienced it at
Government Camp. We have also had some heavy dews at
night&mdash;a very rare occurrence at camp. The festering sores
which afflicted so many in camp are also fast disappearing. Saw
to-day a beautiful water-lily growing in a different part of the
creek upon which we are encamped. It was sweet scented; the
flower was large, white-edged, with a fringe of light blue; and
under the surface was blue, of a darker tint.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Remained in depôt all day.
Hawks swarming about the place in hundreds. Not a thing could be
left for an instant but it was pounced upon, and, if at all
eatable, carried away. Wherever we go, one or two accompany us;
and no sooner are fires lit, and preparations made for meals,
than they come from all quarters. They are brown birds, about the
size of a small fowl. They are fearless, and stand to be shot at,
not moving, though the revolver-bullets strike the branch upon
which they are perched within an inch of their bodies. Bathed in
a pool of water a few hundred yards down our creek&mdash;a
pleasant place, surrounded by palms, the only approach to
tropical vegetation which I have seen.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;We all had a tolerable night's
rest, and started at 20 minutes to 7 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>
on our journey. The party consisted, besides myself, of Mr.
Cowle, who is somewhat better this morning, Mr. McRae, Mr. Hick,
and Billy. We took three days' provisions. The day was fine, but
calm. Found a much better pass to the eastward of the Whately
Range than the one we travelled . on Friday, on our return route,
by following up a creek. At half-past 8 arrived at a spot a
quarter of a mile north of our bivouac on Friday, travelling over
comparatively easy country, tolerably well grassed. From this
place we attempted to get south by following creeks, but did not
make more than half a mile in a direct line by 10 o'clock, when
we were brought up by a creek, with rocks to the water's edge on
either side, and a barrier of rocks in the centre, over and among
which the water tumbled very prettily. A fringe of palms skirting
the stream added to its picturesque appearance. Mr. Hick shot two
white cockatoos, somewhat different from those I had seen at
Camden Harbour. The topknot was white, and the feathers under the
wings light yellow. At Camden Harbour the topknot is
sulphur-coloured. Got, near our halting-place, some berries, not
unlike, in appearance, black currants. They grew on a tree, not
dissimilar in height and appearance to the one described as being
at our noontide halting-place on the 10th instant. The fruit,
however, was different, larger, and growing on stalks&mdash;not
in bunches; the leaves were light-green, smooth, 4 inches long,
and 1½ inch broad. They call it the elder-tree, but there is not
much similitude. Around the camp I marked some smooth-barked
white gum-trees, larger than any we have before seen&mdash;about
18 inches in diameter. Walked out with Messrs. Cowle and McRae to
have a look at the country to the southward and westward. We went
about a mile, and found, with the exception of some rocks near
the camp, that the course, for this country, was fair travelling.
Mr. McRae and myself climbed up two hills, Mr. Cowle being too
unwell to make the attempt. We found the appearance of the
country to the southward promising, but due south the ranges
seemed to bar our progress. The Whately Range was beneath us to
the north, and we could see over it the hills on the other side
of the Glenelg. On one of the hills which we ascended there was a
cave, in which were the remains of a native fire&mdash;apparently
one native. It was recent&mdash;that is to say, about ten days or
a fortnight old&mdash;the ashes not having been either much
disturbed by the wind or intermixed with dust and droppings from
the roof the cave. We saw the McDonald ranges in the distance,
and also Mount Lyell, far away from and beneath us. We estimated
our height above the sea-level at 1,800 feet. On our return
picked up a piece of stone which the natives had been sharpening
for their spears and knives, &amp;c. It is something like
obsidian, but not so highly glazed. The hills which we climbed
were sandstone, with trap or basalt at the bases and in the
valleys. The trap-rock was intersected by veins of quartz, and
there was a peculiar outcropping of that stone in small spiculæ
and large crystals. The ground at the base of the hills was
strewn with the debris of quartz, some of it as fine as sand.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Left camp at half-past 7.
Crossed numerous creeks and streams; this country is beautifully
watered, and, steering S.W., at half-past 8 struck the McRae. At
this spot it consisted of large reaches, bordered by palms and
lofty paperbark trees. The reaches were connected by narrow
channels formed by the hills descending on either side. These
channels were rock-strewn, and the water passed over between the
rocks, either in the form of cascades or rapids, according to the
height. We crossed the McRae at one of the rapids, and followed
it up, the stream running about N.N.E., we of course steering in
an opposite direction. The travelling became very difficult; the
hills were often perpendicular, like walls of masonry, for in
many places even the joints are distinctly marked, always
precipitous. Our course was at the base; and when the ledge of
rocks over which we travelled sloped off to the water's edge, we
had to cross the stream the best way we could, and make our way
along the opposite side until similar impediments compelled us
again to ford the river, which we crossed and recrossed five
times. Some of these fords were difficult, owing to the masses of
rock of all shapes, over whose slippery points and surfaces the
horses stumbled, and sometimes fell, but happily no accident
happened to horse or rider. At one place we were blocked in on
both sides, and had nothing for it but ascending the bank. We
were at the time on the right side of the McRae, and luckily the
hill was not so steep as its neighbours. It was, however, quite
steep enough&mdash;something like Mount Eliza, at the back of my
former residence, but not so high. We dismounted and led our
horses, not going straight up the ascent, but twisting and
turning among the large stones, and thus saving the animals an
additional pull. Halting on the summit of the hill to breathe
ourselves and horses for 10 minutes or so, we pursued our
journey. By the river's side I noticed a peculiar-looking tree,
the only one of the sort that I observed during our journey. It
was larger than its companions, and looked more like an English
forest-tree than any I have seen in Australia. It was richly
clothed with dark foliage, threw out long and spreading branches,
and was a complete shade-giver. The leaves somewhat resemble the
myrtle. The soil of the country over which we passed was sandy
near the river, in patches between the rocks, and reddish brown
upon the hills; but rocks and stones were everywhere, and grass
of course. We have never been without grass&mdash;much of it
coarse and rank, but most of it sweet and good. Saw some
yellow-crested cockatoos near the hill which we had just climbed.
The descent on the other side was not so abrupt, and we had no
occasion to dismount. Passing over some level bare rocks, with
here and there ledges from half a foot to a foot high, we were
again brought to a halt at some rapids, which appeared difficult
to cross, while our progress was barred by a wall of rocks, with
no convenient shelf wide enough for our horses. In some still
water a short distance from the rapids there were beautiful
water-lilies&mdash;white, with edges fringed with filaments like
feathers or down. The flower was five-petaled, small, and
inodorous. With some splashing and slipping, we crossed the
rapids, and, ascending a stony hill of moderate height, came
along some tolerably level country for about a quarter of a mile.
Here I observed for the first time, though it afterwards appeared
that it was&mdash;if not plentiful&mdash;pretty generally
dispersed, a fruit-bearing plant, about 2½ feet high. There are
two stems springing distinct from each other, the shorter one
about one foot long, bearing a leaf which resembles somewhat the
potato-plant; the longer one, 2 feet, bears the fruit in three
pendulous seed-vessels, in shape like the English gooseberry, and
enclosing a large number of striated seeds, enclosed in a
sweetish pulp, the flavour being more grateful than most of the
so-termed edible fruits of the country. The colour of the ripe
seed-vessel is a rich sugar-brown. It exudes saccharine matter,
and is sticky and clammy. I picked a specimen, root, stalks,
leaves, and fruit; and also collected some fruit, which became
crushed, and afterwards fermented in my havresack, but I managed
to save the seed. When I arrived home, my son produced some
specimens he had collected in the immediate neighbourhood of the
camp; so it was no novelty, after all. Almost immediately after
passing these plants, we came to a patch of baobab-trees, the
first I had seen since leaving the Glenelg. Still following the
course of the Glenelg&mdash;we were now on the left bank&mdash;we
crossed again at some rapids, and, ascending a bank of moderate
elevation and steepness, proceeded along some richly-grassed
table-land&mdash;clayey soil, with stones intermixed&mdash;until
gradually nearing the water's edge, the accustomed rocky bar
compelled us once more to cross the river. Travelled over some
bare rocky ground, full of ledges and fissures, and, coming to a
grassy flat, we camped at noon in its midst, among a clump of
short trees, sufficiently close together to throw a grateful
shade. Our halting-ground was about 80 yards from the McRae,
distant from our sleeping-camp 7 miles, and from the depôt (due
south) 9 miles. Our course has been rather to the westward of
south. While at dinner a hawk, more bold than his
companions&mdash;and none of them are too modest&mdash;pounced
down among the trees, and was easily caught by one of the party,
and, after due examination, let go. Messrs. McRae and Hicks
ascended a hill to the westward of our camp, and reported that
the country looked clear in the direction of our course, but said
there was a range running north and south to the eastward. We
left camp at 8 <span class="aa">p.m.</span>, and following up the
river shortly afterwards, passed through a very small patch of
thicket, with climbing-plants crossing from tree to tree,
obliging us to cut our way. The soil was alluvial, and very soft.
Here I saw ferns for the first time&mdash;a delicate
feathery-leaved plant. After emerging from this thicket, we
travelled over undulating country, gradually ascending in our
course, which was now due south. The flat through which we now
passed was bounded east and west by hills rising like walls, with
occasional valleys between, of apparently similar flat land. The
distance between the hills on either side was at first but a few
yards, but this gradually extended, and the average width of the
plain during the miles we went over it was almost, if not quite,
half a mile. It was splendidly grassed, and the herbage was
thinner and less rank than on the north side of the Glenelg, and
more fitted for the immediate use of stock. The soil was
generally gravelly, sometimes sandy, and occasionally rich loam.
Judging by the habits and tastes of our horses, I should prefer
taking up land of this description for stock to the more
densely-grassed country contained in Mr. McRae's run; but this
was comparatively a small patch, although the valleys running at
right angles on either side, as well as many of the hills, seemed
equally well grassed. The McRae had now dwindled into a creek, no
longer broken into wide reaches; and after following it along the
valleys, it branched off, one stream coming from the westward and
the other from the southward. The latter we considered the main
stream, and, as it was in our course, continued to follow it up
through rocky country. After travelling about 3 miles among our
old friends the sandstones, we camped for the night in a narrow
valley, through which the McRae, a small but still running
stream, flowed, and which was fairly grassed. The hills on either
side are not high, and the horses relished the grass, which was
short and sweet. Noticed the banksia-tree on the banks of the
McRae, not having seen it north of the Glenelg. It is short and
scrubby, and seems out of its latitude. It is apparently peculiar
to the McRae. Several kangaroos were started during our day's
march. Mr. Cowle informed me that we were 2,500 feet above the
sea-level. I should not have thought so; but as we have been
ascending, generally gradually, and sometimes abruptly, since we
left the Glenelg, I suppose it must be so. We had now come about
19 miles south of our depôt-camp; and as there is nothing to
prevent the movement of pack-horses, while there is some prospect
of our proceeding still further south, I determined to shift the
depôt-camp, in furtherance of my slow and sure plan of feeling
the way in front, and being able to calculate as nearly as
possible how long it would take to remove the party back on our
tracks through a country which offered no serious impediment, now
that we had discovered passes through the hills, to tired and
jaded horses. Mr. Cowle places our present camp in about latitude
16° S.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Up at 10 minutes past 5, after
a cool and refreshing night, and started at a quarter past 7. We
passed yesterday's shady bivouac at 9. Noticed in the country we
passed over some scrubby stunted cypress, which also grew in the
neighbourhood of Camden Harbour. It is not however plentiful, nor
is it useful for any purpose, being a mere bush. The box-tree and
the cotton-tree very plentiful here and throughout our line of
route, the former a very hard and the latter a very soft wood.
Got to the flat, where we slept, on Monday at 20 minutes past 12.
Left at 3 <span class="aa">p.m.</span> and got back to the depôt
at a quarter past 5, travelling back on our tracks with good
speed. Resolved to rest our horses until Friday, and then move
on.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Did not start until 8 o'clock.
Proceeded to our sleeping-camp of Monday and had to halt, my
horse having twisted off its off hind-shoe in the ranges. Noticed
more particularly at this spot the native apple-trees. They were
loaded with fruit, about the size of a small apple, and which I
have formerly described. The tree is about 30 feet high, the stem
6 inches diameter; bark dark brown, lying in flakes; leaves in
pairs, eight pairs being on one stalk, of a light-green colour,
narrow and pointed at the end, about 2½ inches long and 1 inch
wide in the broadest part; the stalk upon which the leaves are
placed 15 inches long. The shrub called the sand-paper plant is
also here, as well as at Camden Harbour. The leaves are dark
green, with a rough upper surface, like fine sand-paper; they are
dry and crisp, but not brittle or easily broken. The leaves grow
in pairs, upon a stem rising from the ground about 4 feet high.
They are 3½ inches long and 2 inches wide, and nearly oval. There
were trees in our neighbourhood, the stem clothed with brown
stringy bark, the branches white and smooth, like the ordinary
white gum of the country, and the leaves were also precisely
similar. It presented a very strange appearance, but my
companions recognised it as the "Gumtop Stringy-bark" of
Victoria. A graceful-looking tree close by attracted my
attention. It was 40 feet high, the stem 4 inches in diameter,
leaves dark yellowish green, 6 inches long, 2½ inches wide,
thick, and rounded at the apex. Started from this camp at a
quarter past 2, and at 5 o'clock halted on the right bank of the
McRae, in splendid feed of kangaroo-grass up to the horses'
bellies. We were on a small flat containing about 100 acres of
this feed, which grew on clayey soil, and our camp is fixed in a
clump of young trees about 60 or 70 yards from the river's bank.
The river flows from south to north, and here forms the arc of a
bow, which encloses our flat. On the opposite or west side of the
stream the sandstone-hills rise to a great height, sinking lower
towards the south.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;At 9 o'clock this morning we
arrived at our destination, the junction of the two creeks.
Resolved to halt here until noonday, and then push on a flying
party to the southward. We are on a rocky piece of ground, with
the McRae, now a mere brook, running close by. About our camp
lizards of every size and colour sport among the rocks.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;There was a cool breeze from
the southward this morning, but the sun's rays were very
powerful. We have lost mosquitoes, sandflies, and other flies,
but the ticks are very troublesome, crawling about in every
direction, and much annoying the horses. Six or seven are cut out
of our nags at one time. The hawks still accompany us, and one
was caught by hand. When laid down he stretched his legs, shut
his eyes, and was to all appearance&mdash;what he intended us to
believe&mdash;dead. Upon moving a step or two back, he raised his
head, and seeing that simulating death would not do, commenced
pecking at the finger of his captor, who had approached again
towards him. When he saw that there was no one nearer to him than
a few yards, he leisurely flew a short distance off. Bathed in a
narrow reach of the McRae, but without much comfort, the bottom
being composed of sharp-pointed rocks, the water hot, and leeches
in great numbers. Leeches were not met with in the Glenelg, nor
do we hear of their having been seen in the neighbourhood of
Camden Harbour. They seem to be peculiar to the McRae, as far as
my experience goes. Mr. Cowle makes the latitude of our camp 15°
59' 8".</p>
<p><i>April</i> 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at a quarter past 7
upon our exploring trip. We took with us three days' provisions,
intending, unless compelled to return in consequence of losing
shoes, to be away from camp for that period. Arrived at our
halting-place of Tuesday last at 8 <span class="aa">a.m.</span>,
and continuing to ascend the valley for about half a mile farther
on, we reached the summit of the range up which we had been
travelling since we left the Glenelg. Here we dismounted, and
leaving the horses in Billy's charge, climbed up the highest
hill, which had an elevation of about 100 feet above the valley,
and may be considered the highest point of this part of the
range. The view was extensive, and the following bearings were
taken by Mr. Cowle and entered in my note-book at the
time:&mdash;A hill W. by N., distant about 9 miles, apparently
sandy, was supposed at the time to be the Red Cone Hill, near
Doubtful Bay, but this cannot be, as, upon reference to the map,
that hill appears to the southward of our position. The one we
saw is a remarkable hill, and easy of identification; Mount Lyell
N. by W. ½ W.,* about 20 miles; Mount Double Cone N.W. by N., 25
miles; a table hill N. ¾ E., about 35 miles. This we conjectured
to be Mount Waterloo. In our course there were three distinct
ranges of hills, all of which seemed to be much lower than the
one we were on. Their course averaged east and west. The nearest
and smallest range was distant about 5 miles; the second,
somewhat higher, about 10 miles; and the third, the highest,
which looked blue in the distance, not less than 25 miles. The
country between us and the nearest range appeared practicable.
Mr. Cowle considered that we were now 3,000 feet above the level
of the sea. As this is the highest point of the range in this
direction, and the spot is prominent, I give it a name, and
propose, with the Governor's consent, to call the hill Mount
Cowle. Descending the hill, we remounted our horses and proceeded
over the crest of the range. Immediately after leaving the source
of the McRae on one side, flowing north, we struck the head of
another creek on the southern side, and flowing south. This we
followed over very rugged country (the country, by the by, which
looked practicable from the hill-top) for about 2 miles, when we
were stopped by a complete block of rocks before and on either
side of us. We had for some time been driven into the stream,
there being no passage on either side, and had made our way with
difficulty among large boulders of rock. The stream had increased
rapidly in width, depth, and volume, and though so near its
source, was larger than the McRae, at our second depôt. Mr.
Hindhaugh went ahead a short distance on foot to see whether
there was any chance of our getting along by another route, and
on his return reported that the country was impassable for
horses. He had gone down the rivulet for about a quarter of a
mile, when it was joined by a larger stream, and the united
waters flowed towards the westward. It would most probably be
joined by numerous creeks from this and the next parallel range,
and by the time it reached the sea coast have become a river of
some magnitude. I think it not improbable that, in the valley
between either of the ranges which we saw from Mount Cowle, a
stream of more or less magnitude flows towards the sea. We
retraced our steps, leading our horses over the worst portions of
the ravine in which we were confined, and encamped higher up the
creek at 10 minutes to 12. The latitude, by observation, of our
camping-ground, was 16° 2' and some odd seconds, our farthest
south being as nearly as possible 16° 3'. Mr. Cowle made the
longitude of our halting-place 124° 55' E. It was a pretty spot,
overhung by sandstone cliffs, between which the stream rushed
over the rocks. On a ledge of rock some 10 or 12 feet above the
water we boiled the water for tea, the horses feeding higher up
the valley, where there was a diminutive flat. Between the
fissures of the rocks a sufficient number of trees flourished to
throw a grateful shade, some of which I had not noticed before.
There was one light grey-barked tree, with dark-green leaves,
pointed, 3½ inches long by 2 broad, with a fruit somewhat
resembling the seed-vessels of the rose, which, when ripe, were
of a dark-red colour. They were sweet to the taste, and grew upon
a short stalk in clusters of 6 or 8. Mr. Hindhaugh brought in a
sample of a narrow-leaved palm, the leaves diminishing in breadth
from half an inch to the thickness of a thread; they were fine
and tough, and seemed well adapted for the manufacture of hats,
and when prepared, of cordage. I did not see the palm itself, nor
were any more seen by Mr. Hindhaugh, except a few in the locality
where he procured this specimen. I blazed some saplings at this
place, from which exuded a large quantity of white viscid fluid,
which turned dark on exposure to the light, looking not unlike
india-rubber. One of the trees was marked by Mr. Hindhaugh J.H.,
his initials, and these marks may serve to identify the spot at
some future time. The lizards were very plentiful on the rocks,
and they seemed to be of the same colour as the particular mass
of rock on which they sported&mdash;the various shades of brown
and yellow. They were most expert flycatchers. Resumed our
retrograde march at 3 o'clock, it being my determination to
return to depôt, there appearing to be no opening in this
direction, and follow the branch of the McRae, which came from
the westward, hoping to find an outlet to the southward. We had
not gone more than a mile when Mr. Cowle's horse lost a shoe, and
we halted while Mr. Hindhaugh shod the animal. Our last nail was
thus consumed, and, recollecting the nature of the country we had
to pass on our way home, and knowing how utterly useless a
shoeless horse must be in these ranges, I determined to return
back without delay. Before travelling in this country, not only
should the horses be well shod, but each rider should be supplied
with a few spare shoes and plenty of nails. The shoes themselves
are seldom lost. We arrived at the depôt-camp by sundown, when I
gave the order for commencing our homeward march the next
morning. Mr. McRae returned from a pedestrian trip shortly after
my arrival. He had been with Graham up the western branch of the
river, and after getting over some rough-and-tumble country,
which however could be traversed by horses, they gained the
summit of some table-land, which was, for this place, fair
travelling, and extended in the direction we intended to have
gone. He considered the opening at the spot where he turned back,
about 4 miles from camp, of a promising nature. During our trip
to-day there was less grass than usual, spinifex being the
rule.</p>
<p class="foot">[* According to the tracing subsequently
furnished by Mr. Cowle, Mount Lyell is placed a point or two to
the eastward of north from Mount Cowle.&mdash;R.J.S. [<a href=
"#sholl">See map</a>]]</p>
<p><i>April</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Returned on our tracks. Tried
occasionally to get a better crossing-place over the McRae, but
were not successful. These crossings caused some little
excitement, and the leading horsemen generally waited on the
opposite side to see the whole party safely over. The scene thus
viewed was not devoid of interest. Masses of rocky hill, rising
perpendicularly several hundred feet above the water's edge, with
just sufficient ledge at the base to permit the party in single
file to travel along; the river tumbling over immense stones at
the ford; the hills, with their accommodating ledge, on the other
side. We (Mr. McRae and myself) just got across the third ford,
and going a little down the right bank of the river, turn, and
after a few minutes' halt, push through a thicket, which,
although we have broken through it three times before, seems as
impervious as ever. It is formed of stiff thorny trees, or rather
shrubs, which spring up from among the stones; no vestige of
earth to be seen. They are sufficiently high to meet overhead.
What with guiding the horses over the stones, and defending head,
body, and limbs from the thickets, all are well employed. But
this is not all. Showers of green ants descend upon our heads and
shoulders, and it must have been amusing to a looker-on to see
persons at the same time hastily engaged protecting themselves
from ants, thickets, and the rocks at their feet. Happily the
thicket is a small one, and we emerge hot enough, but with
leisure, to destroy the insects which have been persecuting us.
The green-ant is about half an inch long, of a light arsenic
green, and dwells amidst the foliage of trees. Their bite is very
sharp, but beyond the pain at the time, no great inconvenience is
suffered. A small black ant, with a red head, is a more
troublesome insect For some time after being bitten there is much
pain, and the part swells. Their bite, in its effect, is similar
to that of the serjeant-ant. Luckily they are not so plentiful as
the green ant, nor do they reside in trees, otherwise passing
among their habitations would be a task unpleasant, to say the
least. We halted early at the camping-place of Monday week, and
where Mr. McRae had marked the white-gum-trees. Here we remained
for the rest of the day. Two miles south of our present
halting-place we came down a very steep hill, to avoid that which
we had hitherto ascended and descended, and which I described in
a former part of my Journal. We did not gain by the change; it
was quite as steep as the hill we avoided, but somewhat shorter.
Discovered among the rocks of our camping-place a creeping plant,
with leaves and tendrils like those of the cucumber, only much
smaller. The fruit was the size of a small cherry, quite round,
of a bright scarlet colour. The taste is like that of the
cucumber. This is the most uninteresting, as regards situation
and aspect, of our halting-camps among the ranges, and yet there
is a greater variety of trees and vegetable productions than in
any other. Each time that we have visited it I have found
something new. I collect, as well as I can, specimens of fruits
and seeds, but from not having proper receptacles, many of them
get mixed, crushed, and broken. I also collect ripe seeds of
every plant near our camps, although I do not know the nature or
the character of the blossoms&mdash;many of them are creepers.
This has been an extremely hot day. Mr. McRae told me that he had
seen, though not in this part of the North district, a guana
having a hood, which, when the creature is in repose, lies flat
on its shoulders and back, but, when it moves, is spread open,
and when it jumps from tree to tree, appears to act like a wing.
It is of moderate size&mdash;the guana, not the hood. Since my
return my son informs me that he has seen one of these animals.
We saw very few guanas during our journey, and I have not met
with a snake in all my rambles on foot and on horseback: but two
have been seen by our party during this journey&mdash;a small and
a large one&mdash;and three were killed at the Government Camp in
our absence&mdash;one of them upwards of 10 feet long. They
cannot be considered plentiful in this part of Australia. We have
seen numbers of butterflies of endless variety and hue. An
entomologist might spend some months very pleasantly and
profitably here. In fact there is a new field opened for students
of Natural History in every branch.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Did not start until half-past
7. Arrived at depôt No. 1 at 10 minutes past 10, and crossed the
rapids at the Glenelg at 10 minutes to 11. Here we halted. Mr.
Cowle states our latitude to be 15° 44' 28". He is convinced that
these are not the rapids of Grey, which are 2 miles further up
the river. I did intend strolling off to visit the lower rapids,
but some of the horses had swollen backs, and I thought it
advisable to defer this visit to a future time, and bring the
animals home before they got worse. By shifting saddles, padding,
&amp;c., we have hitherto managed to save the horses, who have
only suffered in the feet and legs. In condition they are not
worse&mdash;some of them I think are better&mdash;than when they
left Camden Harbour. Noticed a herb with a grass-like stem, with
seeds like those of wheat, but reversed, lying upon the stem like
the barbs of a spear. We started at a quarter to 3, and after
crossing the divided stream of the Glenelg&mdash;we had been
encamped on the island between the two streams&mdash;struck a
direct course, instead of following back our tracks by the bank
of the Glenelg. The numerous streams which impeded our progress
before therefore passed to the eastward or higher up, and this,
together with the drying up of the water, enabled us to push
along with greater ease and rapidity. We passed over
lightly-timbered and well-grassed country, tolerably level, with
clayey, sandy, and gravelly soil, sometimes one and sometimes the
others, but the same description of herbage and timber on each.
In crossing the stream upon which we camped on the 16th
instant,&mdash;and which we called Mosquito Creek&mdash;but
higher up, my horse got jammed between the banks, and we had some
difficulty in extricating him, the bottom being soft, the banks
steep, and the stream-bed narrow. Shortly after leaving this
place, we came upon our outward track, which was very plain, and
which we followed. Most of the streams which had contained water
when we passed a fortnight since were now dry, and we had to push
on until dusk, when we were fortunate enough to arrive at the
creek known to us as Frying-pan Creek. There was plenty of water
here. We camped on the south bank, and soon found we were in a
mosquito neighbourhood. There was plenty of grass, but the ground
was so stony, that it was a difficult matter to pick out sleeping
ground. However it was not of much consequence, as the mosquitoes
would not let us rest. Mount Lyell bears north-west, about half a
mile distant. This two-peaked hill is connected at the bottom by
rising ground. There is no apparent difference in the height of
the two peaks, looking from our camp at daylight. Both peaks were
composed of bare red rock&mdash;either basalt or trap. After
leaving the Glenelg, and not far from its banks, the ground was
covered with lake-coloured everlastings; further south the
everlastings are dark crimson, and near Camden Harbour pink and
white.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;We were all up before
daylight, but the horses had rambled further than usual, and we
could not start until half-past 8. We crossed the Gairdner at 5
minutes past 2, higher up than on our outward trip, at a gravelly
ford. The stream-beds which we crossed generally contained water,
but not so much as when we passed before; the water was now for
the most part in pools. Camped on the Gairdner. Particularly
noticed Mount Lyell in passing. There are neither trees nor
herbage on either peak, and very little of either on any part of
the hill. At its base there is the usual supply of grass and
scattered timber. On a hill to the north of Mount Lyell we
collected some very large pods of a triangular shape, from a
creeper with a thin stalk. The pods were disproportioned to the
size of the stalk, nearly as much so as a melon is to a
melon-vine. They were not quite ripe, but ripened by keeping,
and, bursting open, exhibited a large quantity of a cotton-like
substance, with which the seeds were enveloped. Encamped at the
Gairdner, under the so-called mulberry-tree, the large dark
leaves of which shaded us from the sun. Some of the ripe fruit
dropped, but they were full of maggots. Left the Gairdner at 20
minutes past 3, and at 5 o'clock halted for the night on a creek
running south, near the largest currant-tree I have seen. It was
loaded with fruit, which we obtained by cutting down large
boughs. We have not seen much game since leaving the Glenelg.
Yesterday we came across two emus, and to-day saw one kangaroo,
and birds called native companions&mdash;a species of heron
apparently. They were large birds, and I took them at first for
turkeys. The creek was very bare of water, which seemed to be
drying up fast. The mosquitoes were very troublesome, as they
have been at every place north of the Glenelg and at our first
depôt south of that river. Some of the people declared they were
three inches long, but this is not the case. The largest may be
half an inch long. There is no doubt but that they are great
pests, and I do not envy the first settlers of this portion of
Western Australia.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;We proceeded homewards by 10
o'clock, and were again among those from whom we parted a short
time ago, and who came around to know all about the new country
we had seen.</p>
<br>
<p>If the result of our journey is not what we hoped, it is not
altogether unsatisfactory. Our knowledge of this portion of the
country has been enlarged, and we have no longer to rely upon the
statements, or to be guided by the opinions, of others. Our
expedition has proved to my satisfaction that the country over
which we travelled, south of the Glenelg, was similar in every
respect to that travelled over by Grey some 15 miles to the
eastward, and the probability is that the intervening country is
of a like nature. Whether it is as rugged and unpromising to the
westward I hope to discover by sending an expedition in that
direction. At the spot where we turned back, which was a few
miles south of Grey's, and some 10 or 12 miles north of
Lushington's farthest, the prospect of advancing in our course,
on horseback, was very poor. There was an opening to the westward
which might possibly lead to an outlet from the ranges in a
southerly direction. This will have to be tried. Should the
attempt fail, then horses must be taken as far as practicable,
and from this point parties on foot must explore the ranges.</p>
<p>Should level and fertile country be discovered south of the
ranges, then the hills over which we travelled will not be
valueless. Not only do they admit of stock being driven over,
supplying abundance of feed and water, but the elevation of the
land will render it well adapted for runs upon which to
depasture, at certain seasons, a portion of the stock which at
other times feed on the plains. The land does not of course yield
so much grass, even in the most fertile spots, as in the plains,
much of the country from its nature being unproductive; yet a
limited number of stock may be kept in good health and condition
in the ranges, which, I am convinced, will become valuable when
the low country on either side is occupied.</p>
<p>I do not consider, nor do those whom I have consulted
consider, that sheep ought to be imported at present. Setting
aside all question of climate, the feed in its present state is
not adapted for sheep, but for large stock only. To bring sheep
into this district would, to say the least, be attended with much
risk. Those that have already been introduced have not done so
well as to encourage the importation of others. I am aware of the
force of the arguments employed to show that the fate of the
sheep landed at Camden Harbour ought not to influence
speculators. It is said that they were too young to withstand the
effects of a sea-voyage and a tropical climate, that they were
not properly tended, that they arrived at an exceptional season,
that they were depastured in the neighbourhood of the sea-coast,
and so on. I allow all this, but, at the same time, I do not see
any reason for not discouraging the importation of sheep <i>for
the present</i>. Whether they will ultimately succeed, when the
feed is cropped down by larger stock, I cannot tell&mdash;time
will show.</p>
<p>For horses, it is the opinion of every one that I have spoken
to on the subject, the country is admirably adapted. The feed is
well fitted for horses, who improve in condition, and they may be
reared in large numbers for markets close at hand.</p>
<p>Whether the feed and climate is adapted for cattle we have had
no opportunity of judging from personal observation, as none have
been imported, but those who have been accustomed to this
description of stock speak highly of the capabilities of the
country for such purpose. One fact appears tolerably
clear&mdash;that there is no poisonous plant calculated to affect
ruminating animals&mdash;or in fact others, horses doing
well&mdash;for none of the sheep have died from the effects of
poison. It was supposed, shortly after we landed, that some of
the Government sheep had died from the effects of poison. I did
not credit it at the time, and I am now convinced that no
vegetable poison exists. I speak of course only of the country
near the sea-coasts, where the sheep have been depastured, but I
may add that I have seen nothing in my travels at all resembling
the poison plant of South-Western Australia. What will be the
value of horned stock reared here will depend upon the progress
of settlement. Without a dense population, it appears to me that
their value must be estimated by that of the tallow, hides, and
horns they yield, less the cost of production.</p>
<p>I do not say much respecting the agricultural capabilities of
the country over which we passed, because our course would
necessarily lead us from the low country. I must confess,
however, that the alluvial land on the banks of rivers and
streams was of less extent than I anticipated. Of its richness
there can be no doubt But were the quantity ever so great, it
would not promote settlement. In this climate no white man could
till the ground, nor would any white man be able long to endure
the attacks of the insect enemies. In most parts of Australia
these nuisances disappear, or at all events become less, as
settlement extends, but here the nature of the crop on low
alluvial river-side lands would encourage, and not disperse, the
mosquitoes.</p>
<p>If coolie labour is to be employed it will be when pastoral
occupations gradually lead to others, and when wealthy
speculators grow articles of commercial value. Rice, cotton,
sugar, indigo, tea, coffee, &amp;c., will not be cultivated by
the class of men who usually emigrate to new countries and form
the bulk of the population. Except in the event of some
extraordinary or exceptional inducement for immigration, such as
gold in large quantities, or other metals which may be easily
worked and transported to the port of shipment, I do not conceive
that the country I have seen will be the home of a large European
population. It is essentially a pastoral country, and will be
permanently settled only by the extension of pastoral occupation
from the southward. It is my conviction of this fact and my
knowledge that establishments have already been formed along the
north-west coast, that make me so anxious to penetrate the
southern barrier which separates this portion of Australia from
the more level country to the southward. We are now but a
comparatively short distance from Roebuck Bay. When once a pass
is found&mdash;it is not more than two weeks' journey from our
furthest depôt, and an opening once made, extension of pastoral
occupation is but a question of time.</p>
<p>Of the natural resources of the country over which we passed,
I am not qualified to give a scientific opinion. There are many
vegetable productions, which may become, which perhaps are,
valuable in connection with arts and manufactures, medicine,
&amp;c., but I cannot state the fact with certainty. Of the
trees, I may safely say that for building, for furniture, or even
for fencing, but very few are available, and those in situations
which would require their being consumed on the spot. Some of the
timber might be valuable for turnery and small ornamental work,
for it is very hard and close-grained, but for all domestic and
field purposes wood will have to be imported, especially for the
coast settlements&mdash;if any.</p>
<p>On the sandstone ranges there are no indications of mineral
deposits, but at the base of the hills and in the lower valleys,
among the basalt and trap, there are evident signs of much
metallic accumulation. Our time did not permit us to make a close
examination; nor do I think the knowledge possessed by any of our
party was sufficient to render the time profitably employed which
was devoted to mineral researches. I have mentioned one spot as
offering a prospect of gold-discovery, and also alluded to the
specimen of copper-ore brought from the Glenelg. I may likewise
state that there was an abundance of iron ores, some of them very
pretty specimens, but otherwise of no value in a new country.</p>
<p>The health of every member of the party, excepting Mr. Cowle,
who had an attack of incipient fever for two or three days, was
excellent. Not only did cuts and sores, brought with us from
Camden Harbour, rapidly heal, but any damage received en route
from stone or wood, also healed in the course of a few days. Men
and horses both looked as well on their return as when they
started. Even the horses' legs looked healthy, considering the
battering they had received. With fine weather, good water, the
absence of all privation, or even annoyance, except the
mosquitoes, a short trip, and good health, it is no wonder that
we were all pleased with our journey. For my part I have seldom
passed a more enjoyable time than that which I spent during our
wanderings among the sandstones.</p>

<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">North District,
2nd May 1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;Having received, orders
from you on the 6th ultimo to prepare for an Expedition which
would last about three weeks, but to take sufficient provisions
for myself and man for one month, I at once set about it, and
finished on the 8th, and on the 10th we started, the party being
composed of yourself, with Police Constable Jackaman, also native
assistant Billy, and myself and Chainer Graham. Starting at 8
o'clock on Monday morning, we proceeded to the head of the inlet,
the appointed place, where the Association people were to meet us
(marked A on tracing), and halted for a time to ascertain if any
of the Association people were coming. The signal was given at
the appointed time (9 o'clock), but it not being answered, we
proceeded on our way, keeping a course (as near as the nature of
the country permitted) south by east, the country being much
easier to travel than that we passed over during the first hour
of our journey. When about five miles from the Camp (Government),
I saw some small patches of country very much resembling some of
the goldfields in Victoria, which I mentioned to you at the time.
Proceeding for another 5 miles, we halted for dinner, and during
our stay there three of the Association people came up, namely,
Messrs. McRae, Hindhaugh, and Hick, who were anxious to see as
much of the country as possible. Shortly after their arrival we
put the packs on the horses, and proceeded on our way again, this
time taking an easterly course, which we kept for about seven
miles, and then camped for the night on the south bank of the
Gairdner. On the 11th we took a south-easterly direction for
about 5 miles, and then an easterly direction again for about 4
miles, passing Mount Lyell. Here we halted for dinner, and I took
an observation and found that we were in latitude south 15deg. 37
min. and longitude about 124 deg 59 min. east, Mount Lyell
bearing. S.S.E., and distant about two miles. Starting again
shortly after dinner, we kept a course S. by E. about 4 miles,
and then halted for the night, much disappointed at not reaching
the Glenelg. We were on the move early again on the 12th, and on
our road, as usual, in the cool of the morning and after about
half an hour's travelling, we came upon the northern bank of the
Glenelg, which we followed up to the fording-place or rapids,
where we crossed, and proceeded about three quarters of a mile,
steering S. by W., and halted at a short distance from the foot
of the Whately Range, where you formed the first depôt (No. 1) on
tracing. After dinner, I went back to the rapids, for the purpose
of taking an observation, but was frustrated by clouds. I threw
my line in the river and caught a few fish, after which we
returned to the depôt.</p>
<p>The country north of the Glenelg, commencing at the western
part of the Hampton Downs along our course down to the river,
and, for a few miles on either side of the said course, contains
good pasture land, producing good though coarse grass in
abundance; it is also well watered during this season of the
year, and is certainly the finest part of the North District that
I have seen, and contains about 60,000 acres of good land. The
vegetation is prolific here; eucalyptus averaging from 3 to 5
niches in diameter; a small species of acacia, cypresses, cork
tree, cotton, tea, baobab, and palm. Greenstone or basalt compose
the peninsula, and between that and the Glenelg sandstone,
ironstone, and, ironstone gravel, with a little quartz in places
that I have already mentioned, appear to be the principal
composition of the country north of the Glenelg. I believe also
that the grass is more succulent and nourishing than that growing
on the peninsula, caused, I think, by the continuous fall of
dews, which every night are very heavy, and do not evaporate by
the heat of the sun till 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning, keeping
the grass moist and soft, instead of being harsh and dry, as in
those places where dew does not fall.</p>
<p>Our depôt was placed in about lat. south 15 deg. 43 min. and
long, east about 124 deg. 59 min. (marked No. 1 on tracing.) On
the 13th we were again on the move, seeking an outlet southwards.
Going around the eastern part of the Whately Range, we found that
we had to keep a little to the eastward, and after travelling for
some time through very broken country, being repeatedly obliged
to turn back, we found that it was impossible to get packhorses
in that direction; so we halted for dinner, after finishing which
we proceeded eastward to avoid a sandstone range which we had
rounded. After about an hour's travelling, over exceedingly rough
country, we came upon the banks of the Glenelg about two miles
from the rapids. The banks were almost perpendicular, and there
were also rapids here. After passing over and down some
exceedingly rocky places, we at last reached the small flat on
which our depôt camp was fixed between the Whately Range and the
river. I have never in any of the Colonies travelled over such a
continuation of rough barren country in one day as I have
travelled over to-day. Sandstone predominates here, having
noticed but two small pieces of quartz during this day.</p>
<p>Gum, pine, and a few honeysuckle trees were all the moderate
sized trees I saw growing, and after leaving the flat where our
camp was, I scarcely saw any grass; spinifex I saw in
abundance.</p>
<p>On the 14th we tried the western part of the Whately Ranges.
The ascent here was more difficult than that of yesterday, and
after rambling about in every direction, we at last came to a
nice sandy flat, along which we proceeded till we came to a
good-sized stream, where we halted for dinner; and you were
pleased to name the said stream the McRae, after one of those who
accompanied us from the Association. In returning to camp, we
kept the eastward of our morning's course, and found a
comparatively easy path for the pack horses. Feeling satisfied
that we had discovered a pass to the southward, we made a halt
during Saturday and Sunday, for the purpose of resting, the
horses, as their feet and legs were very much cut in passing over
the rough, country we had travelled during the last two days.
Sandstone, and very little ironstone, constitute the base of this
part of the country. Eucalyptus of many sorts, acacia, and
banksia, appear to be very common here; gum-trees, like stringy
bark, appear here also. Plenty of reed-like grass grows on the
sandy plains, and on the better soil kangaroo grass. These we
passed on our return round to the depôt.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 17th, we started for the McRae, taking with us
three days' provisions, and having arrived at the point referred
to, we found an opening, which by winding round, we could manage
to proceed very well in the direction required. Just before
halting-time my horse cast a shoe, and it was deemed advisable to
fend him to the depôt, which was done; he was then shod and
brought back. This delayed us half a day, during which time we
went out to see if there was any obstacle further on in our way,
but, happily to say, there was not. Feeling too unwell, I did not
proceed farther than the gully we travelled along the next day;
so I sat down and waited till yourself and Mr. McRae returned,
and we then proceeded to our camp, which was situated in latitude
about 15deg. 50min. south.</p>
<p>18th.&mdash;Crossing the McRae, we again continued our
southerly course along the valley we saw yesterday, and found it
good travelling till we came upon the McRae again, which we had
to cross and recross several times, and near its rise we had (in
some places) to travel up its bed. We halted for dinner in about
latitude south 15deg. 56min. and for the night in about latitude
south 16deg.</p>
<p>The country passed over during the last two days is of the
same description, except that there were a few quartz rises,
containing crystallized quartz. The grasses are also of the same
sort as those described as seen on 14th, except that they are
shorter and more nutritious than those seen on that day, but as
there is no extent of it, I imagine that this particular part of
the country will prove useless in a commercial point of view.</p>
<p>On the 19th we retraced our steps to the depôt camp, for the
purpose of moving it further to the south, which removal occupied
two days, viz:, 21st and 22nd.</p>
<p>24th.&mdash;We were again in our saddles and on our way to the
south, but we were baffled in several places; we managed,
however, to reach latitude about 16deg. 2min. south; we also
ascended a hill on our route, which I believe to be the highest
point on these ranges, and from whence I managed to get a few
bearings, sufficient to give me an estimate of our longitude,
which was about 124deg, 55min. east. My horse having lost another
shoe, all the nails were expended in putting it <i>on</i>, and it
was considered necessary to return to the depôt, and thence to
the Camp (Government) again, in case any other shoes should come
off the feet of our horses.</p>
<p>On the 25th we started for the Government Camp, keeping on our
outward track, and arrived, at our destination without any
accident, more than the loss of a few horse-shoes from one or the
other of the horses.</p>
<p>Mount Lyell is a very conspicuous mountain, and Dr. Martin
could never have been on it, when he says that it is timbered to
its summit. I do not think that the rapids where we crossed are
sketched in their proper position many of the maps, it being more
to the eastward of Mount Lyell than is shown on the maps, and I
only regret not haying sufficient instruments and time to prove
this. Dr. Martin was on a very remarkable hill bearing west by
north, and is clothed to its summit by dense vegetation.</p>
<p>I beg to express my thanks to Mr. T. C. Sholl for his kindness
in keeping the barometrical observations during my absence, as it
would have been impossible, without great delay, to have kept
them while moving about from day to day, as I am obliged to do
when away from the Government Camp.</p>

<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">Government
Resident's Office,<br>
Camden Harbour, May 29, 1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;I intend dispatching a
party to the southward of the Glenelg for the purpose of
continuing the exploration that direction, commencing from the
spot at which I formed my second depot.</p>
<p>To my great regret I find it advisable, on account of the
Public Service, that I remain in camp. You will therefore, take
command of the party, and upon you I shall depend that it is
properly equipped and provisioned.</p>
<p>You will ascertain by personal inspection that the horses are
properly shod, that the saddles and other harness are in good
order, and that the saddles, pack and riding, fit the horses. You
will also take care that at least one set of horse-shoes, and
four sets of horse-shoe nails, are taken.</p>
<p>The expedition will be out three weeks, but, as it is
desirable to provide foe any unforeseen emergency, you will take
with you four weeks' provisions.</p>
<p>The expedition will start on Monday; 5th June, and will
consist of the following persons, besides yourself,
viz.:&mdash;P.C. W. Gee, native assistant Billy, and John
Stainer.* You will ride my pony; the others will be mounted on
Government horses, of which five will be required, three for
saddle, and two for pack.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Also Mr. Alex. McRae; see the end of the
instructions; <span class="aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>The members of the expedition most all be well armed, and a
sufficiency of ammunition must be taken. At least one fowling
piece, and enough ammunition for procuring game must be
taken.</p>
<p>Shoeing tools, an axe for cutting firewood, and a tomahawk
will be necessary.</p>
<p>The object of the expedition is to penetrate the ranges in a
southerly direction, and, if possible, to travel over the flat
country towards Roebuck Bay. As far as I can judge, some westing
will have to be made before a southerly course is followed.
Should you be unable to obtain a southerly course, you will try
to make the sea coast, and ascertain the nature of the country in
the direction of Doubtful Bay, returning by George Water, and
along the left bank of the Glenelg, until a fording place is
found, when a straight course will be made to the Government
Camp.</p>
<p>A depot will be formed in the first instance, at the spot
occupied by the second, depot in the former expedition. From this
depôt the lightly equipped party must never be distant more than
20 miles, or absent more than three days. As soon as a
practicable track for pack-horses is discovered, the depot will
be moved on to a selected spot, and from thence farther
explorations will be made. Never less than two men must be left
behind in depot.</p>
<p>You will keep a journal of your proceedings, stating therein
the course travelled, the nature of the soil, a description of
the vegetation, and of the physical character of the country,
recollecting that nothing connected with a new country is too
minute or trifling for record. You will also give an estimate of
daily distance travelled, being careful not to fall into the
common error of over-estimating the distance. Upon your return
you will prepare a report, based upon your journal, and as full
as possible, addressing the same to me.</p>
<p>As far as practicable you will collect samples of plants,
flowers, and seeds; also mineralogical specimens, and in fact any
thing which will tend to illustrate any description contained in
your journal, or add to our knowledge of the country.</p>
<p>You will be careful not to exceed the allotted time, and in
the event of heavy rains, commence a retrograde movement before
the rivers in your rear are flooded. The extra week's rations are
for the purpose of providing against the probable detention of
the party from flooded rivers, sickness, accident, or other
causes. The extra supply would not justify your moving
onward.</p>
<p>Sunday will be a day of rest, except in cases of extreme
emergency. Watch must be kept every night, from dusk until
sunrise. Your camps and halting places must be well marked, so
that, in the event of the arrival of a ship, and it is necessary
to recall the expedition, the searching party will have no
difficulty in discovering your thereabouts.</p>
<p>Mr. McRae, a gentleman who accompanied the former expedition,
a thorough bushman, and in whose judgment and skill I place great
reliance, has promised to form one of your party. I wish you to
be guided by him in all matters not connected with the management
and control of the Government party, every member of which must
yield implicit obedience to your orders.</p>
<p>I earnestly trust that the expedition will be successful, that
our knowledge of the country south of the Glenelg may be
extended, and, at any rate, that the members of the party will

<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;Having received orders from
you to take command of a small party you intended sending to
continue the exploration south of the Glenelg, to be absent three
weeks, and to start on the 5th June, also that I was to form my
first depot at your farthest or No. 2 depot, and from thence
penetrate the ranges in a southerly direction, keeping to the
westward as far as you could judge before a southerly course
could be made. I beg to state that upon arrival at this depot and
from a view obtained from one of the sandstone hills, I could see
no pass to the westward, but a likely one to the eastward of
south; I therefore departed from this part of your instructions,
going to tho eastward instead of west, as you ordered. Whether I
have done so wisely or not you will judge from the following
report:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the 5th June at ½ past 8 a.m. I left the Government camp,
my party consisting of P.C. Gee, native Billy, and John Stainer,
with 4 saddle and 3 pack-horses. Mr. McRae, a gentleman who was
with the former expedition, also accompanied us. We proceeded
along your old track as far as Mount Lyell, where we camped for
the night.</p>
<p>On the 6th, in consequence of two of the pack-horses straying.
Mr. McRae and myself&mdash;during the time they were sought
for&mdash;ascended Mount Lyell. As there seems to be some
difference of opinion with regard to this mount, I will describe
it as far as I am able from the short time I was on the summit,
as well as add a few bearings taken at the time.</p>
<p>On the N.E. (the side we ascended) about half way up, is a
basalt precipice 20 or 30 feet high, which forms as it were a
ring round the hill, but this precipice is not so high at any
other point. On the N. apex is an irregular pile of basalt upon
which we erected a small heap of stones, and upon which we left
our initials. The side of the hill is thickly clothed with coarse
grass; the summit is lightly grassed. The mount is thinly
timbered to the summit, small gum and cotton being the prevalent
trees. From the north apes ne took the following bearings:&mdash;
The E. end of the McDonald Range bore N.N.E, Mount Batten W.N.W.,
Buff Head in Camden Harbor W.N.W. ½ W., a remarkable pointed hill
to the north of the Upper Rapids of the Glenelg E.S.E. ½ E., what
we supposed to be Mount Stuart S.W., and Mount Eyre W.S.W. We had
a beautiful view of Glenelg to the southward, but could not see
the Prince Regent River, as the day was hazy. To the N. of this
mount is a beautiful grassy level flat about half a mile in
extent, through which runs a clear stream winding around the
mount towards the Glenelg.</p>
<p>We still after leaving Mount Lyell followed the old track as
far as your No. 2 Depôt, where we arrived and formed our No. 1,
on Wednesday, the 7th. Resting here one day I started, on the
9th, accompanied by Mr. McRae and Billy, taking with us three
saddle-horses, and proceeded 21 miles about S.S.E. from depôt. We
then returned about one mile on our tracks and halted for the
night on the banks of a river which I named the Sale. This river
is flowing through a level grassy flat; it has two beds about 300
yard distant from each other. These beds are each about 15 or 20
yards wide; there is now only a small amount of water running
through them; the banks are steep, and there is drift wood in the
trees about 20 feet above the bed of the river, and which, I
believe after heavy rains is overflowing. The whole of our
travelling to-day with the exception of the last mile or two has
been across the Sandstone Range, which in some places, is very
rough; the range is timbered with stringy bark, pine, cotton,
cork, &amp;c. There is grass on the range, but it is coarse and
only in occasional patches. The land about the banks of the Sale
is good and richly grassed. About 3 miles to the N. of this river
our track passed about 5 miles to the westward of Lushington's
farthest in 1838. His farthest from this spot bears about E.N.E.,
distant about 6 miles.</p>
<p>On the 10th we retained on our tracks to depot; rested on
Sunday 11th, and on the 12th moved the depot party to the banks
of the Sale, there forming Depot No. 2.</p>
<p>On the 13th Mr. McRae, myself, and Billy, started from depot
with three saddle-horses, and proceeded about 5 miles E.S.E.,
when we arrived at the foot of a mount which Mr. McRae and myself
ascended, leaving the horses at the foot; this I named Mount
Alexander; it is about 1,600 feet above sea level, thickly
grassed and lightly timbered to the very summit; from this mount
we had a beautiful view of fine level grassy country extending E.
and W.; this good country I named the Panter Downs. Ranges
appeared to surround them. During our journey of the 19th I
noticed a remarkable bluff point, being evidently the same
mentioned by Grey in his account of Lieutenant Lushington's
journey S. of his farthest: this point from here bore about E.
and was distant about 2 miles. On the high ranges about 25 miles
to the eastward there were bush fires. We cut our initials and
the broad at row on a tree on the summit of Mount Alexander and
descended; we then went a course S. 10 degrees W. for about 5
miles, the greater part over a sandstone range, when we struck
the banks of a good-sized river, dividing as it were two large
ranges; where we struck it the banks were so high and rocky that
we could not get down to it. The river was here about 100 yards
wide, with running falls of about 20 feet, and about 200 yards
below this the river had widened to about 200 yards; here were
falls of about 30 feet; on the opposite bank the shore was of
white sand and a gently shelving beach, totally different to the
bank we were now on; there were tracks of natives seen here. This
river I named the Berckelman. After leaving this point we went
about 3½ miles S. 55deg. W. nearly parallel to the bank of the
river, but distant from it in some places nearly a mile, in
others close to the bank; the river was here joined by a
good-sized stream running in from from the E.; this we crossed,
sod leaving the river proceeded for about 6 miles N.N.E., when we
arrived in depot. Since descending the range shortly after
striking the Berckelman we travelled through beautifully grassed
level country, the grass fine and green; on the sandstone range
there was grass, fine pine, stringy bark, gum, small stinkwood,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>On the 14th we removed the depot about 5 miles to the S.W. and
formed Depot No. 3 on the southern bank of the Berckelman near
where the Sale forms a junction with it; here we saw recent
tracks of 8 or 9 natives in the bed of the river, following its
coarse downwards. Leaving the depot party, Mr. McRae, myself, and
Billy continued along the banks of the river for about 3 miles S.
80 W.; the river here seemed to form three branches, distant from
each other not more than 20 yards, two were dry but the third was
a deep river. About 3 miles farther to the westward the
Berckelman appeared to run out between an opening in the range,
but as it was getting late we had not time to go farther, and
returned on our tracks to depot.</p>
<p>On the 15th Mr. McRae, myself, and Billy, left depot, and
proceeded about 4 miles due S. over tolerably level and
well-grassed land, when we arrived at the foot of a hill, about
1,400 feet above sea level, of iron stone and trap formation.
This hill Mr. McRae and myself ascended, leaving Billy at the
foot in charge of the horses. From the top we took the bearing of
a remarkable conical hill, which I named Mount Lochée; it bore
S.W., distant about 2 miles. The river Berckelman appeared to run
out between the ranges to the N.W. The spot where we first struck
it on the 13th bore nearly E., Mount Alexander N. 55deg. E; the
junction of the Berckelman, with a large stream, E., apparent
openings in the ranges to the S. and S.W. We saw good grassed
land all around us, in some places level, in others undulating
and hilly. Before descending this hill, which I named Mount
Hindhaugh, we cut our initials and the broad arrow on a tree on
the summit. This mount is thickly grassed and lightly timbered,
it is not unlike Mount Alexander. After leaving here we proceeded
for about 6 miles S.W., when we struck a small river; at this
point it was very deep, with steep banks, and about from 20 to 30
feet wide; at this place we subsequently caught a great many
fish, some over a foot in length. I here determined to form depot
No. 4. This river I named the Middleton; the sandstone ranges are
about ½ a mile to the S., extending around from S.S.E. to S.W.
From here we followed the course of this river for about 2½ miles
N.W., and about 5 miles N. 30 deg. E. From this point the
Middleton appeared to take a turn and join the Berckelman, about
2 miles distant, bearing, from as near as we could see, N., 10
deg. W. From here we continued about 4½ miles N. 55 deg. E., and
arrived at depot.</p>
<p>On the 16th the whole party left Depôt No. 3, and proceeded
about 5½ miles on a course S. 10deg. W., when we struck our track
of yesterday; we followed this to the banks of the Middleton and
formed Depôt No. 4. We stayed there during the remainder of the
day to rest the horses.</p>
<p>On the 17th Mr. McRae, myself, and Billy again left Depôt, our
object being to try and find a pass through the Ranges, to the
S.; we steered a course S. W. for about 1½ mile over good and
tolerably level grassed land, which terminated in a ragged pass
up the range; after leading, the horses to the summit we
continued a course for about 5½ miles due S. along the table top
of this range, when we found ourselves on a small hill, or I
should say a higher point of this range, from which we had a good
view of the country from N. around by W. to S. There appeared
nothing but ranges and bills, all which seemed well grassed. We
could get no view towards the E. I took the bearing of a very
large and conspicuous hill, distant about 15 miles to the S.W.;
as this is the largest hill I have seen I name it Mount Page.
From here we proceeded for about 4½ miles S.E., when Mr. McRae
and myself dismounted, leaving Billy with the horses; we walked
out upon a narrow peak, about 2,000 feet high, running out a
short distance from the range, almost precipitous; one false step
on this peak would entail great danger; if a person fell he would
fall many hundred feet without being able to recover himself.
This I have named Peak Edward; from here we had a most
magnificent view, apparently at our very feet; though distant
about 5 miles, wound the coarse of a large river flowing around
from E. to S.S.W. The river from here appeared not less than ¼ of
a mile in width with low sandy banks. There were fires all around
us, some native, others bush. The country appeared passable to
the S.E., though hilly; there still appeared to be hills and
ranges in all directions. From here we could see no pass from the
ranges we were on into the plain below. As it was now getting
late we had not time to look for one, but determined to start out
again on Monday. We returned along our outward track to Depot.
The range we passed over to-day is tolerably well grassed and on
the whole easy travelling. Pine, stringy-bark, gum and cotton are
the principal trees. This range I named the Harding.</p>
<p>On Sunday the 18th we rested ourselves and the horses.</p>
<p>On the 19th Mr. McRae, myself, and Billy again started from
depôt, our object being to try and get as far as the large river
seen on the 17th. We followed our old track to within 2½ miles of
our farthest on Saturday, when we struck off and steered a course
due S. for 2 miles; we were then on the brink of the range, the
river, before us. The side of the range at this point was so
precipitous that we debated for some time whether we should
attempt to lead the horses down or try and find a better pass,
but as we had not much time for the latter, and then upon the
chance of not finding one, I determined to do the former; we
therefore commenced the descent, which was no easy matter, but
after leading the horses in a zigzag manner we arrived at the
foot, after being over an hour from the time we left the top
until we were on the level ground. We still continued our S.
course over average grassed land, thickly timbered with plum,
gum, cotton, &amp;c., (the largest cotton trees I have yet seen
were here, they averaged about 1 foot in diameter.) There were
also a great many baobabs both on the level ground and on the
side of the range. We struck the river about 8 miles from where
we commenced descending the range; this was indeed a fine river;
I at once named it the Walcott; at the spot where we struck it it
was at least ¼ of a mile across; it was a tidal river, the tide
being now at its lowest or nearly so. The rise and fall I should
say, judging from the wet muddy banks, would be about 15 feet;
the tide was running out at the rate of about 5 miles per hour;
the shore was lined, with mangroves; the tide in falling had just
left a large sand patch above water about 600 yards from the bank
we were on, between which sand patch and us there was a sweeping
body of water running out from E.N.E. to W.S.W. I believe this
river as tar as this point is navigable; About 1 mile before
reaching the banks we passed mud flats quite hard, but close to
the banks soft and thinly crusted with salt, with many tracks of
alligators; this at spring tide is, under water. No fording place
I am sure could be found either here or below it would have to be
sought for above. I noticed large fires in different directions
at some distance from the river. I had not time to examine the
Walcott more closely, as our absence from Camden Harbour being
limited to three weeks we would have as much as we could do to
arrive home within that period, and we had also to find a
suitable spot for camping for the night. We therefore returned
for about 2 miles on our track, when Mr. McRae and myself cut our
initials and the date, together with the broad arrow, on a large
baobab, the nearest one we saw to the river; it measured 30 feet
in circumference; after leaving this tree we continued along the
homeward track for about 1½ mile when we camped for the night at
a small creek with one water hole, which I believe is the only
fresh water near here, from the fact that a great, number of
birds came to drink, especially pigeons; I called this Pigeon
creek. The land between the foot of the range and the banks of
the Walcott is tolerably well grassed, but not equal to Panter
Downs.</p>
<p>On the 20th, we followed back our tracks to the range, which,
after some difficulty, we ascended all safe, both men and beasts;
at the top where we commenced descending yesterday and finished
ascending to-day, I cut my initials, the date, and the broad
arrow on a small baobab; we had from here another good view of
the Walcott, and the tide being now in it looked much larger than
when we saw it from here yesterday. We also noticed about 20
miles S. of the Walcott evidently the course of another large
river. We returned on the old track to Depot.</p>
<p>On the 21st we rested the horses in depot, so as to have them
fresh for a start homeward to-morrow.</p>
<p>On the 22nd we followed our old track over the Panter Downs to
Depot No. 2, where we halted for the night. The Panter Downs I
may here state as far as I could see, judging from our different
journeys in many parts of them, as also from the views obtained
from the different hills and ranges, averaged 18 miles from E to
W., and at least 12 miles from N. to S., with three distinct
rivers running through and forming a junction towards the western
extremity. A great portion of these downs in the vicinity of the
rivers after very heavy rains I believe to be inundated, judging
from the drift wood seen in the trees, sometimes distant from the
river banks about a quarter of a mile, and then 3 or 4 feet above
the ground. The grass averages about 3 feet in height, a fine
kangaroo grass, at this time very green; the soil is
chocolate-coloured, in some places covered with ironstone gravel,
intermixed with quartz.</p>
<p>With regard to the Rivers Berckelman and Walcott I believe,
from the lay of the country and the course of these rivers, that
the former debouches into the sea at or near Secure Bay, and the
latter at or near Stokes' Bay. The Walcott at its point of
debouchement is evidently a river of some, magnitude, perhaps as
large if not larger than any other in Western Australia.</p>
<p>The weather we had during the whole of our journey was
delightful; the nights were icy cold&mdash;heavy dews nearly
every night. Sometimes during the day we experienced strong N.E.
winds. The timber on the whole was small; on the banks of the
Sale there are some large flooded gum. On the Harding Range there
is as fine pine, stringy bark and other trees, the names of which
I am unacquainted with. On the flat near the river Walcott, plum,
baobab, cotton, and cork, are the principal trees.</p>
<p>The grass on the Panter Dawns is the best I have seen; I think
it superior to the grass on the Hampton Downs, which is much
coarser. All the hills we saw on these Downs were well
grassed.</p>
<p>We were never inconvenienced for want of water; there was
abundance along our track.</p>
<p>We were troubled very little by mosquitoes, the nights were
too cold for them. We saw no natives, but numerous recent tracks
and many fires.</p>
<p>On the whole we saw very little game, on an average from six
to seven kangaroo a day, but they were so wild we could not shoot
one. The only game we could get, and we tried hard, were
cockatoos, pheasants, and pigeons.</p>

<h4>C. A. McRae's Observations on the Expedition to R.
Sholl.</h4>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">Camden
Harbor,<br>
July 21st. 1865.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;As I had the pleasure of
accompanying an expedition under the command of Mr. T C. Sholl,
which left here in June last, having as its object the
exploration of the country south of the Glenelg River, I trust a
few remarks from me upon the district passed over will not be
deemed out of place.</p>
<p>We left Government Camp, Camden Harbor, on the 5th ult.,
steering a course for the rapids on the Glenelg near your No. 1
Depot, which we reached in a day and a half. The country lying
between Camden Harbor and those rapids and through which our
track for the most part lay, is that known as "Hampton Downs,"
and so highly extolled by Mr. Martin and other writers to the
Perth Government, upon the capabilities of this district. Those
Downs are principally chocolate soil, mixed with ironstone
gravel, and intersected with low traprock ridges, at this season
clothed with the most luxuriant kangaroo grass, wild oats,
&amp;c. The timber is principally a stunted gum, of little use
for anything other than firewood; some large white-gums, however,
are found near streams that might be split up for fencing
purposes. Water is found in abundance anywhere; in fact I never
saw a district better watered than Camden Harbor. After all I
have heard said for and against this as a grazing district, I
must say at this season it presents many advantages that would
lead one to suppose it a passable sheep country, but if seen in
the months of November and December, when our misguided
Association landed in it, any one, with the least knowledge of
country suited for sheep-farming, would at once pronounce it
unfit. Horses or cattle however, I am convinced, would do on it,
and for their pasturage about 300,000 acres might be
available.</p>
<p>After leaving the Glenelg, we made for your No. 2 depot, about
18 or 20 miles south of the crossing, which we reached in one
day. Here the first depot party were left until a pass was found
further south. The country between this camp and the river is a
succession of barren sandstone ranges, rising gradually from the
coast and river to an elevation of about [3?],000 feet near the
camp. The principal, grass seen is spinifex, timber&mdash;pine
and black-butt gum. This, like the other side of the river, is
well watered. The McRae River is a fine stream, taking its rise
in the ranges east of depot 2, and flows N.W. until it forms a
junction with the Glenelg a few miles below the rapids. Some rich
grassy flats are found on its banks, but of no extent, the
largest, that near the camp, not being more than a thousand
acres; they would, however, be found, of essential service as
halting places for stock travelling to the interior, should it be
settled.</p>
<p>After a day's rest, Mr. Sholl and myself, accompanied by
Billy, carrying two days' provisions, started in a S.E. direction
to try and find a track farther through the ranges. We travelled
about 12 miles, over some very rough country, of a sandstone
formation, poorly grassed, when we got to a high peak, affording
a good view of the surrounding district. To the south, we saw
what was taken to be the course of a river, running N.E. and S.W.
through low country, and distant about 8 or 10 miles. A high
table-range bounded the view south, which terminated in a
remarkable high bluff, bearing S.S.E. from our position. Leaving
this peak, from which the ranges gradually sloped towards the low
country and keeping a general course S. for about 8 miles, over
broken sandstone, we came upon open flats, and 2 miles farther on
we struck a fine stream running to the west, through a large
tract of low level country, well grassed and lightly wooded. The
main bed of this river, where we struck it, is about 30 yards
wide; besides two other beds, not running. After moving the depot
party on here, we examined the country 7 or 8 miles to the S.E.,
and from a high hill about 1,600 feet above sea level (which Mr.
Sholl proposed calling Mount Alexander) we had a splendid view of
the rich low Downs that surrounded us on all sides, and extending
W. 16 or 18 miles. The country east was more hilly. Another fine
stream was found running through the ranges from the S.E. and
forming a junction with the other 6 or 7 miles below our depot;
it is much the finer stream of the two, and judging from the
height of drift wood in the trees, the low land along its banks
must be flooded to a considerable extent at the wet season. A
third depot was formed on it below the junction, and after being
joined by another large stream (upon which we formed our fourth
and last depot about 10 miles to the south), flowed through the
ranges to the west. The country here is similar to that to the
east&mdash;chocolate flats, thickly grassed. There is about
200,000 acres in those flats, which Mr. Sholl proposed calling
"Panter Downs," well suited for horse or cattle stations. This I
consider to be superior to any land about Camden Harbour; there
is less stone and gravel mixed with the soil, and the grass grows
closer and finer.</p>
<p>"Panter Downs" are bounded on the south by a high table-range
rising abruptly from the plain. This we crossed in a S.
direction. The tableland is well grassed, although of a light
sandy nature. Ten miles from our depot No. 4, we found ourselves
on the edge of a high precipice, running E. and W, 2,000 feet
below us, and extending 7 or 8 miles south lay a low country,
with a large tidal river running through it from E.N.E. to W.S.W.
From the number of native fires and openings through the ranges
across the river to the S.E., I think it likely a good tract of
country will be found to exist there; but the best route to it
would be S.E. from out depot No.2. The pass down to the low land
was made with difficulty even by leading our horses. The flats
are not so good here as "Panter Downs". We crossed about 6 miles
of them, in a southerly direction before coming to the mud and
mangrove flats, which extend 1½ mile from the main river bed. As
the tide was out we had a good opportunity of judging the breadth
of the main channel, which could not have been less than 600
yards, through which its dark muddy water swept at the rate of 5
miles per hour. The rise and fall of tide is 10 to 15 feet, and I
think it must be navigable for ships of considerable tonnage even
further up than where we struck it. This noble river (certainly
the finest I have seen in this territory), Mr. Sholl proposed
calling the Walcott. It will doubtless be of great importance
should the country in its vicinity be settled as affording the
best means for the transmission of provisions &amp;c. from the
coast to the interior, for there seems little probability of a
practicable dray-route being found through the ranges which
stretch along the coast and south bank of the Glenelg. Stock of
course could be driven from Camden Harbor, or some of the ports
to the south. The total extent of country seen by us on or about
those rivers suited for grazing purposes would be about 350,000
acres, and I should say capable of carrying 10,000 horses or
cattle. Our farthest point on the Walcott would be about 50 miles
south of your No. 2 depot. We returned by our outward track to
Camden Harbour on the 26th, after a trip of three weeks, which I
must admit I spent very pleasantly.</p>
