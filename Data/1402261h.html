<p>Production Notes:</p>
<p>This memoir has been given a shorter title than that under
which it appeared in the Perth newspaper, <i>The Inquirer and
Commercial News</i>, between September and mid-October, 1863. Its
name appears in full just before the beginning of section II. A
table of contents has been added, the typographic scheme
simplified, and a map from Trove inserted at the end. An attempt
has been made to make the spelling of place names consistent with
the map at the end. The syllables "oo" and "ee" in English become
"ü" and "ih" in German.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">[Lefroy to The Colonial
Secretary.]</span></h4>
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;"><i>York,
August</i> 1, 1863.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>.&mdash;I have the honor to report
to you for His Excellency's information that the Eastern
exploring expedition, under my charge, reached this town
yesterday after noon, all, with the exception of colonial
prisoner F. Hall, in excellent health, and having suffered no
great privations or fatigue.</p>
<p>The party reached Narimbeen, a part of Mr Smith's station, and
I believe the Mount Welcome of the chart, on the 23rd ultimo, and
having rested there to refresh the horses, which much required
rest, until 27th ultimo, on that evening I despatched the party
in the charge of Mr Robinson to follow Mr Smith's cart track into
York, by easy stages, whilst Kowitch and myself rode round by
Minilyeen (Mount Stirling,) the fine rocks of which locality I
was anxious to examine. Having made this detour I joined the
party at Bunmull yesterday morning.</p>
<p>In the progress of the expedition it has been necessary to
abandon three of the horses, they having become so weak as to be
unable to follow, although carrying no loads but an empty riding
saddle each. I trust however that all three of these will
gradually recover their strength, and at length find their way
back to the settled districts. Several of the other horses have
also during the middle and latter portion of the expedition been
reduced to a very weak state, but have been brought in by easy
stages, and little or no loads to carry.</p>
<p>I have much pleasure In reporting that the whole country
traversed by the expedition, eastward of Mount Welcome, gradually
improves as to both pastoral and agricultural purposes, until at
distance of about 100 miles E.N.E. of that point we reached a
country of an exceedingly promising character, as to both
agricultural and pastoral purposes, but more especially the
former, and perhaps in this respect not surpassed by any district
of equal extent in Australia, as I estimate the rich alluvial
soils to cover more than half the entire surface of the further
portion of this county.</p>
<p>The track of the expedition from Mount Welcome, outwards and
homewards, amounts to about 900 miles, the position of the
furthermost point readied is lat. 30degs. 30mins. S, long.
122degs. 40mins. E, and our whole track is contained within the
parallels of lat. 30degs. 20mins. S and lat. 32degs. S.</p>
<p>It is my intention to pack up and leave in the charge of Mr S.
Parker, the remainder of the equipment of the expedition supplied
by the Colonial Government, to await your directions as to its
disposal, and I hope to be able to leave this on the 4th or 5th,
which will enable me to wait on you in Perth on the 7th inst.</p>
<p>I have the satisfaction to be able to report most favourably
as to the conduct of all the members of the expedition since
leaving York, but as to Mr Robinson, his conduct throughout has
in every respect been such as to have merited my approval, and
gained my esteem in no ordinary measure.</p>
<p>I would most respectfully request, as a well-merited reward
for his services and good conduct throughout the expedition, that
His Excellency will permit me to present to the native Kowitch
the double barrelled carbine which, he has carried during the
expedition, with a written permission to him to hold and retain
the same, as a reward of his good services in it, together with a
portion of the surplus cartridges supplied for our use, and his
clothing and bedding, which may now be considered as worn
out.</p>
<p>Perhaps, also His Excellency may approve that Mr Robinson and
Mr P. Edwards retain, for their personal use, the clothing and
bedding provided for them by the Colonial Government. I have kept
a journal of the incidents of each days travel, and of my
observations on the geology, the fauna, and the meteorology of
the country traversed, a copy of which I shall be able to present
for His Excellency's information, I trust, within a few
weeks.</p>
<p>On the whole I indulge a strong hope that His Excellency, and
the public generally, will, on perusal of my journal, conclude
that the expedition has been successful as to its great
object&mdash;the discovery of extensive tracts of land suitable
to agricultural and pastoral purposes, and that the experience of
the next few years will amply justify such a favourable
opinion.</p>
<p>I have ventured to prepare the subjoined approximate estimate
of the distribution of the surface of the soil of the entire
counter traversed eastward of Smith's station, taken as
<i>one</i> whole, but I should mention that in the western moiety
of this district the inferior descriptions of soil will largely
preponderate, and vice versâ in the eastern moiety.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">I have, the honor to be.

<br>
<h3>[II. <span class="aa">Organisation and
Preparation]</span></h3>
<p>The York Agricultural Society having requested the earnest
attention of the Colonial Government to the expediency of
organizing a party for the purpose of exploring the interior of
this Colony eastward of that District, for the especial purpose
of discovering, if possible, new districts suitable for
sheep-farming, and having requested that any expedition formed
for this purpose might be placed under my leadership, on March
23, in company with Mr Locke Burges, a leading settler and
stock-owner of this Colony, I waited on the Hon. the Colonial
Secretary, at his office, for the purpose of conferring generally
on the subject of the projected expedition, the constitution and
number of the party, the distribution of the expense of it as
between the Colonial Government and the York Agricultural
Society, and the leave of absence from my official duties which
his Excellency might be disposed to grant me, so that I might
undertake the command of it.</p>
<p>The result of this interview was a scheme for the
organization, equipment, place and date of departure, duty, and
field of action of the proposed party, as follows,
namely:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st.&mdash;That the party consist of myself, as leader, of one
or two young settlers, to be nominated by the York Agricultural
Society, of one mounted policeman, of one convict, as my personal
servant, and of one native.</p>
<p>2ndly.&mdash;That His Excellency be respectfully solicited to
grant me leave of absence for three months, on full pay.</p>
<p>3rdly.&mdash;That the York Agricultural Society be requested
to supply 11 horses, (Mr Burges and myself undertaking to furnish
one horse each in addition thereto,) all the provisions, and some
few specified articles of equipment; but that His Excellency be
solicited to authorize the preparation and issue of all such
articles of equipment as might be in the stores of the Imperial
Convict Department established in this Colony, and of any
Department of the Colonial Government, or could be manufactured
within the former Department.</p>
<p>4thly.&mdash;That all stores and horses be collected in York,
and ready tor delivery into my charge, by the 21st of April.</p>
<p>5thly.&mdash;That the party should endeavour to take a final
departure from Narimbeen, the extreme sheep station in that
direction, and the property of Mr Smith, on or about the first
day of May.</p>
<p>Mr Barlee kindly undertook to submit to His Excellency, for
his information and approval, the above plan, and to communicate
without delay with the Secretary of the York Agricultural
Society, suggesting that he should lose no time in summoning an
extraordinary meeting of the members of that Society, to obtain a
formal expression of their views and wishes on the subject
generally, and as to the extent to which they would contribute
towards the excuses and equipment of the Expedition.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 3.&mdash;Rode to Crawley to
confer with Mr Barlee on the steps which it might be desirable to
take to meet the unexpected event of the meeting of the York
Agricultural Society, held on the 1st instant, having passed
resolutions in favour of a considerable extension of the scale of
organization, and period of service, of the proposed party.</p>
<p>Mr Barlee authorised and directed me to proceed vigorously
with all that portion of the equipment which, it had been
determined, was to be prepared at the Convict Establishment,
expressing a hope and assurance that the party would still be
organized mainly on the plan above stated, but intimating that
the latter might be slightly modified to meet partially the more
extensive views of the York settlers.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 10.&mdash;A letter, of which the
following is a copy, was this day addressed to the Secretary of
the York Agricultural Society by the Hon. the Colonial
Secretary:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:10%;">Colonial
Secretary's Office,</div>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">Perth, April 10,
1863.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;In acknowledging your
letter of the 7th instant, stating that a meeting of the members
of the York Agricultural Society has been called for the purpose
of reconsidering the subject of the proposed expedition to the
eastward of York, I am directed by His Excellency the Governor to
state that Messrs. S. E. and L. C. Burges and Mr H. M. Lefroy met
in my office yesterday for the purpose of discussing the
question, and that it was determined to recommend to the York
Agricultural Society that provision be made for an absence of
four months from Mr Smith's station.</p>
<p>If a direct distance of 10 miles per day from this point be
made for one half of this period, and no good country be found,
it would be useless to proceed further, and it would he equally
useless to proceed so far if any quantity of good country be
discovered at a less distance.</p>
<p>To meet the wishes of the settlers, it is proposed to defer
the starting of the expedition from Mr Smith's station until the
10th May.</p>
<p>His Excellency is prepared to sanction this course, and, in
the event of its meeting the concurrence of the settlers, to
provide, at the public expense, such extra pack-saddles, &amp;c.,
as may be required.</p>
<p>In regard to the appointment of some person as second in
command of the expedition, His Excellency will be prepared to
consider any suggestion which may be made by the Society.</p>
<p>Should the above suggestions meet the wishes of the settlers,
it is desirable that the following suggestions should be
considered, and that I should be favoured with a definite reply
to them, namely:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st.&mdash;That a dray be at Perth on or before the 25th
instant, to receive and convey to York the portion of the
equipment of the expedition to be provided by the Government.</p>
<p>2ndly.&mdash;That some farm in the immediate vicinity of York
be appointed for the reception of the horses and equipment of the
party, not later than the 1st day of May.</p>
<p>3rdly.&mdash;That the pork for the party be at once hung up in
a barn or shed to dry as far as possible, as its portability and
utility will be considerably increased thereby.</p>
<p>4thly.&mdash;That one ton of cut hay, barley, &amp;c., and a
three-horse team to carry the same, and a portion of the
equipments of the party, from York to Mr Smith's station, be
supplied; the forage being required for the consumption of the
horses en route to that station.</p>
<p>This seems very necessary, as the party and horses will be
detained a few days on the road from York to Mr Smith's station,
and only after leaving that station will it become possible to
keep the horses on tether.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">I have the honor, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.</div>

<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">Colonial
Secretary.</div>
<p>The Secretary of the York Agricultural Society.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 17.&mdash;I this day addressed
the following letter to the Secretary of the York Agricultural
Society.</p>
<br>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">Fremantle, April
17, 1863.</div>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;Having, through the
kindness of Mr Barlee, been favoured with a copy of resolutions
passed at a meeting of your Society on the 14th instant, I have
the honor to address myself directly to you, very briefly, as the
early departure of the mail leaves me little time, on a few
points of great importance to the contemplated exploring, party,
of which you have done me the honor to approve of the command
being conferred on me.</p>
<p>1st.&mdash;The equipment contributed by the Colonial
Government at Fremantle and Perth will be ready for delivery at
the Police Barracks, at Perth, at 4 p.m. of Saturday, the 25th
instant, it being found impracticable to get it ready by the
earlier date first proposed.</p>
<p>2nd.&mdash;I have amended the list of equipments for the basis
of an absence of 120 days instead of 75 days, as at first
proposed, but retaining still the assumption that the party will
consist of 5 members only.</p>
<p>If the York Agricultural Society still deem it essential that
the party shall consist of 6 members, it will be incumbent on it
to select another person to join it, and to increase their
contribution of provisions, &amp;c., proportionally.</p>
<p>My own opinion, which is concurred in by most experienced
persons whom I have had an opportunity of consulting on the
subject, is that a party of 5 men will be sufficient for
protection against the natives, and is therefore absolutely
preferable to a larger party.</p>
<p>I propose to be in York by mid-day of Wednesday, the 29th
instant, which, if the horses and provisions be all delivered by
that day, will enable the party to leave York on the Monday
following, and to leave Mr Smith's station on the Saturday
following, if fortunately blunders and accidents be avoided.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">I have the honor to be,
Sir,</div>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:10%;">Your obedient
Servant,</div>
<div style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">H. M.
LEFROY.</div>
<br>
<p>P.S.&mdash;In the estimate of the quantity of pork, I have
assumed the weight to be taken, after the extraction of every
bone, and its being thoroughly dried. To the thorough drying of
it I attach great importance.</p>
<br>
<p>By means of the above, and other letters which it does not
appear necessary to quote, of further inter views with Mr Barlee,
to whose prompt and zealous efforts to meet and remove all
obstacles to the realization of the expedition I feel much
indebted, and by the active exertions of the Storekeeper of the
Convict Establishment in pressing forward the preparation of the
equipment of the expedition, the latter was despatched to Perth
on the 26th of April, and at 6 a.m. on the morning of the 28th I
was enabled to leave Fremantle, (my official duties being
transferred to Mr Duval, the Deputy Superintendent of the Convict
Establishment,) and to proceed to York, where my assistance was
requisite to complete the organization and equipment of the
party; there fore, having said adieu to Mr Duval and many of the
officers of the Convict Establishment, who had assembled to see
me start, and having had the pleasure of hearing their many
hearty good wishes for our success and safe return, myself and
the colonial prisoner Frank Hall started for Perth, each riding
one of the two horses which I intended to take with me on the
expedition.</p>
<p>Arrived at Perth, and having taken breakfast at the house of
my kind friend Lieut-Colonel Bruce, I waited on Mr Barlee to
receive any final instructions which he might have to give me,
and to thank him for the courtesy, confidence in me, and
readiness to remove every difficulty which has arisen in the
development of the plan of the expedition, which he has shown.
Thence I proceeded to the Survey Office, where the
Surveyor-General, Mr Roe, delivered to me the chronometer for the
use of the expedition, with much useful advice and information
touching the conduct of the same, and with many kind wishes for
its success, and our safety in it. Proceeding then to the Police
Office, I, with Mr Hogan, the Superintendent of Police, made the
final arrangements as to the pay and travelling expenses of
mounted constable Thomas Edwards, and of the native Kowitch,
namely, that the former would draw his regular police pay during
the term occupied by the expedition, and a travelling allowance
of three shillings per day until the departure of the party from
York; and that the latter would be placed on the list of native
constables, drawing pay at the rate of 50s per month, out of
which 10s per month was to be advanced, from time to time, to his
wife.</p>
<p>Leaving police constable Edwards, now formally transferred to
the staff of the expedition, with orders to accompany to York
that portion of the stores and equipment of the expedition which
had been provided by the Colonial Government, and which was then
collected in the store of the Police Department, awaiting the
arrival of the settlers' dray, by which it was to be conveyed to
that town, and to pick up on the road the horse which Mr Brockman
had offered for the use of the expedition, myself and Frank Hall
left Perth in the early part of the afternoon, and on the evening
of the following day (April 29) reached the farm of my old friend
Mr S. E. Burges, one of the principal supporters of the projected
exploring party.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 30.&mdash;In the forenoon Mr
Burges and myself rode into York for the purpose of attending a
meeting of the Exploration Committee of the York Agricultural
Society, when such progress in the development of the plans and
equipment was made as gave me hope that the party would be
enabled to start from York on the 7th of May.</p>
<p>The heavy rain which fell yesterday and the last two nights
has removed any apprehension which I may have previously
entertained that the date selected for the departure of the
expedition from York might prove too early in the season, and
that obstacles and delay might be encountered in the early
progress of the expedition therefrom.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 2.&mdash;Attended another meeting
of the Exploration Committee, when further detail-arrangements
were discussed and settled. At 11 a.m., the Government portion of
the stores and equipment arrived from Perth, in the dray of Mr
Nairn, and under the escort of constable Edwards.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 3.&mdash;In the Divine Service of
the Church his morning Archdeacon Brown offered a prayer for
God's protection of our party during the contemplated
exploration, and subsequently in his sermon very kindly referred
to it, alleging its claim to be viewed as an undertaking of great
public importance and expressing a fervent hope that the
obligation of keeping holy the Sabbath, and of daily prayer,
would not be forgotten by us,&mdash;a sentiment to which I
cordially responded, and I sincerely intend to act up to the
principle which he inculcated to the utmost of my power.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 4&mdash;Attended a farewell
dinner, very kindly given at Craig's Hotel, in our honor, and as
evidence of their friendly interest in our success, by the
principal supporters of, and contributors to, the expedition;
Captain Newland, R.N., Comptroller-General of Convicts, who
arrived at York yesterday, being also one of the invited guests.
It proved a very pleasant party, gratifying to myself as an
evidence of the kind and friendly feeling of those who were, many
years since, my brother settlers of the York district, and not
proceeding from, or attesting my unreasonable confidence in, our
expedition being crowned with successful results.</p>
<p>As it appears unnecessary to recite in detail the successive
steps of the progress of the completion of the organisation and
equipment of the party, it will suffice to record that, by the
prompt and untiring efforts of the Secretary of the York
Agricultural Society, of the members of the Exploration
Committee, of the Government Resident of York, L. Bayly, Esq.,
and, in fact, of almost every one who had it in his power to aid
us, and by much hard work on the part of all the members of our
small party; and having, on the morning of the 6th instant,
despatched a heavy dray-load of forage and equipment en route to
Mr Smith's station, with orders to leave portions of the forage
at certain specified points of the track to that station, for the
use of the horses on the road, (the distance to the station being
96 miles, and it being ascertained that at this season of the
year no natural food at all sufficient for our horses would be
found near it), at 11 a.m. on the 7th of May, and in the presence
of a large gathering of the population of York and its
neighbourhood, of all ranks, ages and conditions, who gave us
three very hearty cheers, and many warm and gratifying
expressions of their interest in the public objects of the
expedition and hopes for our personal safety and welfare, we were
enabled to make a final departure from the farm of Mr S. Parker,
who had kindly placed his premises and establishment at our
service during the stay of the expedition at York.</p>
<p>The party consists of the following, namely:&mdash;</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%;">H. M. Lefroy, Leader<br>
Edward Robinson, second in command<br>
Thomas Edwards, of the colonial mounted police force<br>
Frank Hall, colonial convict<br>
Kowitch, an aboriginal of the York district.</p>
<p>Of the above, Mr Robinson had accompanied me about three years
since, when I followed the course of the Williams River, through
the Darling Range: to the coast, in which little excursion I had
conceived a very high opinion both of his experience and energy
in the bush, and of his agreeableness as a companion He is a
stepson of a wealthy settler of the York district, and has been
nominated for the expedition by the York Agricultural
Society.</p>
<p>Thomas Edwards had earned a well-established reputation as an
efficient bushman and energetic police constable, by many years
valuable services in the mounted police force of the York
district, and had attended Mr Hargraves, in the capacity of
constable, in his recent inspection of the Colony, with a view to
ascertain the existence or otherwise of auriferous rocks in
it.</p>
<p>Frank Hall is a son of a now deceased but highly respectable
settler of this Colony, and is at present undergoing a sentence
of 15 years transportation for the crime of cattle stealing. His
well-known bush experience, and familiarity with the natives, and
his general cleverness and smartness, had induced me to solicit
His Excellency's permission to take him with me in the capacity
of convict servant, which request His Excellency was pleased to
accede to.</p>
<p>The native Kowitch I had known from his childhood, he having
accompanied Dr. Landor and myself when he was not more than 10
years of age, in a exploring expedition to the south-east of the
York district, made by us in 1842, and having in fact been
brought up principally in Mr Landor's house. Since then he has
served many years as a native policeman and is well known to all
the settlers of the York district as an intelligent, sensible,
courageous, and trustworthy native; an estimate of his character
which my observation and experience in this expedition has fully
confirmed.</p>

<h3>[IV. <span class="aa">Departure]</span></h3>
<p>A large number of settlers of York and its vicinity, for the
most part personal friends of my own, others warmly interested in
the objects of the Expedition, accompanied us many miles of our
first day's journey; in many cases rendering much required
assistance in leading, driving, and re-adjusting the packs and
gear on our 16 horses, of which some were only partially broken
in, all were new to each other, to ourselves, to their work as
pack-horses, and to the new and not always well-fitting gear with
which they were entrapped; whilst we, on our part, were
inexperienced in the proper adjusting of their gear, and the most
convenient distribution of the very bulky and heavy burdens with
which they started; but with their ready and vigorous assistance
in each emergency during the 10 or 12 first miles of our journey
through which they accompanied us, we got on without any disaster
or delay worthy of record, and at about 8 p.m., or two hours
after sunset, reached Ben Coolen, a gully distant from York about
25 miles, at which the driver of our forage had been directed to
leave one night's ration for our horses.</p>
<p>We were annoyed rather than surprised to find the heavily
laden cart, which was to convey to Mr Smith's station a portion
of the equipment and the forage for our horses, had, in two days'
journey, completed only 25 miles; but the heaviness of the load,
together with the soft state of the track after the recent heavy
rains, was a sufficient reason for this result; the settler who
supplied the dray, at a charge of £12 for the journey to Mr
Smith's station, doing much more than he had engaged to do, by
accompanying the dray himself to assist the regular driver, and
by supplying 4 horses instead of 3, as contracted for, and
throughout the journey sparing no exertions of himself or horses
to reach Mr Smith's station as speedily as possible.</p>
<p>The reaching our first night's camping ground so late as 8
p.m., when it happened to be a particularly dark night, and the
saturated state of the ground on which we camped, due to the late
rains, formed an effective but by no means agreeable introduction
to our subsequent bush life and labors; but by virtue of the
fatigue, both mental and bodily, which we had undergone through
this and the seven days of our preparations at York, and cheered
by the agreeable society and ever prompt services of Mr L. Bayly,
the Government Resident of York, we at length got over the not
easy task of unloading and unsaddling, in the dark, so many wild
and frightened horses for the first time; tying them up to
separate trees, so that they could hurt neither themselves nor
each other; giving them their forage, &amp;c., many of them being
so wild and frightened that to get a nosebag secured to the head
of one of these was a labor of no small difficulty, if not of
peril. All this accomplished, we found leisure to eat our supper,
for which we had earned a good appetite, and soon therefore were
sleeping soundly on the wet ground, not using our tents, which we
were too tired to put up.</p>
<p>I may here record that the first, and, as it eventually
proved, nearly the only untoward disaster of our Expedition,
occurred this morning, involving the loss of one of the two
horses which I had supplied for the use of the Expedition. It
happened as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>To prevent as far as possible any unavoidable delay in the
starting of the Expedition this morning, which, from the
untrained and imperfectly broken state of the horses, and from
the hurriedness of our preparations generally, I anticipated
would prove a somewhat troublesome and slow business, I had
directed all the new tether ropes to be attached to the horses'
necks the previous evening. The mare in question was secured to
the stall, not by her tether rope, which was merely coiled round
her neck, and there made fast, but by a headstall. The stiffness
of the new rope, I suppose, galled her neck and caused her to
raise her near hind leg to rub it when her near hind hoof got
entangled in the coils of the rope, so that she could not
withdraw it. She then fell back, breaking her halter, and in her
efforts to release her foot, drew the coils of rope so tightly
round her neck, that, at 4 a.m. this morning, when I left the
house of my friend Dr. McCoy, at which I had slept, and which was
distant from her stable nearly 300 yards, for the purpose of
making all the preparations for our starting, I distinctly heard
her violent snortings and breathings, and when I reached Mr
Parker's yard I found her so nearly suffocated that, although
alive at the hour of our starting from York, she died about noon.
Unfortunately some of Mr Parker's men, who slept in an empty
stall of the same open stable or shed (including the prisoner F.
Hall, who was specially in charge of the horses,) were so
overpowered by the drugged spirits supplied from one of the
public houses in York, which they had too freely imbibed the
preceding evening, under the excitement of our approaching
departure, that all her snortings and struggles did not avail to
wake them from their heavy slumbers. This disagreeable accident
necessitated the purchase of another horse at the eleventh hour,
which however was promptly effected at the expense of the
Exploration Committee.</p>
<br>
<a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>
<h3>[V. <span class="aa">Journal: May]</span></h3>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 8.&mdash;Breakfasted before
sunrise; then devoted hours to re-forming the packing of many of
our packbags, and refitting the gear, particularly the pads of
the packsaddles, which had all been attached to the staves with
the wrong end forward. About 11 a.m. we were able to proceed, and
at 3 p.m. we passed the farm of Mr E. Parker, where Mr Bayly and
myself were hospitably pressed to partake of refreshment. At 6
p.m. reached a gully called Nukomuming, at which we camped.</p>
<p>I may here mention that Mr Parker's farm, of which the native
name is Dangin, is distant from York, by the nearest track, 37
miles, in a direction E. 1½ S. It is the most remote farm in that
direction hitherto established, and Mr Smith's sheep station
(Narimbeen, the Mt. Emu of Roe and Moore's track) distant from it
about 64 miles by the existing track, on an east bearing, is the
only sheep station hitherto formed to the east of the meridian of
Dangin, say longitude 117 d. 15 m. E., with the exception of the
station belonging to Mr Parker at Mount Stirling. Our travelling
distance to-day has been 18 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 9.&mdash;Having devoted about
three more hours this morning to further improvements of our
packing, and to better adjustments of the innumerable traps,
cords, &amp;c., which secure them, and which both want of time
and unceasing interruptions prevented our effecting at York, we
again started about 10 a.m., and proceeding without accident or
delay about 3 p.m. reached Emu Gully (native name Ulonning).
Travelling distance 16 miles. About midway in this day's journey
we reached the western side of a chain of very shallow lakes, or
sandpans, at the present season of the year perfectly dry, but in
the winter receiving the drainage of an extensive tract of
country to the north and east of Mount Stirling, which it passes
on the west side, and hence keeping a S.S.W. course, it reaches
the east branch of the Avon about 10 miles above the Jurakin
Pool, or about 40 miles from York, direct distance on a S.S.E.
bearing. These lakes overflow from one to another only in a very
wet winter, like that of last year; and their overflow then has
caused all the parts of the Avon to be more or less brackish
throughout the past summer; the overflow carrying with it into
the Avon the salt accumulated in the beds of these lakes during
the last 10 or 12 preceding years, in which no overflow has taken
place. I may further mention that any observations during
subsequent parts of this journey convince me that the district,
very imperfectly, as above shown, drained by this chain of
shallow winter lakes, extends little, if at all, to the eastward
of the meridian of 118 d. E., which south of the parallel of 23
d. S. may probably be considered as the extreme eastern limit of
the country having any drainage whatever towards the western
coast; or, as appears most probable in the present state of our
knowledge of it, having a drainage into the ocean at all.</p>
<p>The flat or wide valley which contains these lakes has a width
of 3 or 4 miles, and its inclination in the direction of drainage
must be very slight, since, although last winter a stream of
water of a depth of about 3 feet occupied its whole width, few or
no channels connecting one lake with another have been cut in it,
but the water flowed in a gentle stream, occupying nearly the
whole width of the valley.</p>
<p>The small rounded hills eastward of this chain of lakes, are
generally capped with a thin stratum of in indurated argillaceous
conglomerate, which contains a small quantity of iron in angular
masses, and of a volume sometimes approaching to that of a small
pea. These specks of iron, on fracture, show a very bright
surface.</p>
<p>The present thickness of this rock is seldom so great as 15
feet, and its edges always bear an appearance of having been
exposed to the surges and ripples of a shoal sea; the hills also,
which this rock now caps, have always a well-rounded form.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 10.&mdash;With much regret I found
myself under a strong economic pressure to travel this, the first
Sunday of our journey.</p>
<p>The case is as follows:&mdash;We are still distant from Mr
Smith's station more than 40 miles. I must remain at Mr Smith's
station one whole day, if not more; both to rest the horses, to
get observations for our position, and to repack the bags, so as
to take into them all that portion of our provisions namely,
about 1,100 lbs weight, which is being brought up in the forage
dray; but half the forage is already consumed by the 16 horses of
the Expedition, and Mr Bayly's two in addition; it is well known
that there is no bush feed for horses between this and Mr
Smith's, and probably the sheep will have destroyed all the feed
near Mr Smith's station; so that, in fact, we must depend on our
hay and corn, carried from York, until after leaving the latter
place.</p>
<p>Accordingly, starting at 9 a.m., we travelled on with little
interruption from packs being displaced &amp;c., and, with a very
short halt about 1 p.m. to eat a biscuit each, until 7 p.m., when
we reached Wilyelling, a pretty open grassy plain of about 100
acres extent, and containing a fine spring of good water.
Travelling distance 29 miles. We were all very tired at the end
of this long and very uninteresting day's journey.</p>
<p>Long after midnight Grindal, with the dray and 5 horses, (for
to enable him to reach Smith's station as speedily as possible, I
had lent him to assist his team, one and that the best of our
pack-horses, and a native, to point out the imperfectly marked
track), arrived, showing a zeal for our service, for which I
reward him and his driver with a portion of one a the bottles of
brandy which Mr Craig, mine host of the Castle Hotel at York, had
presented to the Expedition. Both they and their horses were much
fatigued, as will be readily supposed by any one who has tried
the experiment of driving five horses in a line, with a heavily
laden dray, along a scarcely marked track, passing over
sand-plains, gullies, dead timber, and many other obstacles, for
30 miles at a stretch.</p>
<p>Towards the latter part of this day's journey we experienced
much trouble in keeping the horses which were both very tired and
very hungry, from straying off the track to feed, and, from lying
down and rolling in their packs, but after dark, when we expected
most difficulty in this respect, the horses kept to the track,
and we got in without accident.</p>
<p>It is desirable to mention that I should not have made so long
a journey as 30 miles this day, if water for ourselves and horses
could have been obtained at a less distance.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 11.&mdash;At 9 a.m. started on
this our last day's journey to Mr Smith's station.</p>
<p>After accompanying the party about 10 miles of the route, Mr
Bayly and myself rode on alone to select a convenient camping
ground in the vicinity of the station prior to the arrival of the
rest of the party.</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. we reached the station, and were hospitably received
by the man in charge (William Harris), who immediately prepared
some mutton chops for us, which we ate with a good relish, for I
find that the breakfasting at daylight, followed by two hours'
hard work in catching, saddling, and loading the horses, and then
by 5 hours' riding, gives me a real genuine and unmistakeable
appetite for a midday dinner&mdash;such as many a poor fellow
tied to a desk all day, knows neither the sense of, nor the sound
healthful satisfaction which attends and follows the appeasement
of it with any plain wholesome food.</p>
<p>We found in the immediate vicinity of the house, which is
close to a bare rock, of which the native name is Comining, and
distant from the large bald rock Narimbeen, which gives name to
the station, about 3 miles, the latter bearing from the former
about E. by S., plenty of short young grass, the best we had seen
since leaving York, and water in three shallow wells in the field
adjoining the house. Here the remainder of the party, which
arrived about 3 p.m. encamped.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I ascended the rock of Comining, and got a
native of the place, whose name is Mungup, and who has
volunteered to accompany the party in our future journey, to
point out the bearings of York and Dangin, which I found to be W.
by N. and W. ½ S. respectively, by compass.</p>
<p>The distance of Dangin from this station by the existing track
is 61 or 62 miles, and that of Dangin from York, by the nearest
track, 37 miles. In both cases the track is very direct.</p>
<p>Having conducted the reader to this point, which is at
present, by some 40 miles, the most distant sheep-station to the
eastward of the Avon Valley, I shall submit some brief
observations on the physical features, and particularly the
geological structure, of the country intervening between the
western face of the Darling Range, or the meridian of 116 d. 10
m. and that of 118 d. east longitude, and the parallels of 30 d.
and 33d. south latitude, as the geological structure of the
Darling Range is so intimately connected with that of the country
eastward of the Avon, at least as far as the meridian of 118 d.
E., that the geology of the latter district, which alone seems
strictly to come within the scope of this Journal, cannot be
fully discussed without constant reference to that of the Darling
Range and of the Avon Valley.</p>
<p>First as to geological structure.</p>
<p>The geological basis of the whole of this country, and of that
stretching at least 4 degrees further eastward, as our subsequent
journey enabled us to ascertain, is primitive granite, ruptured
or fissured only in a few lines, which will be described below;
nowhere tilted or upheaved, except perhaps very slightly towards
the western face of the Darling Range; nowhere intersected by
eruptive rocks, unless dykes of quartz come within that
definition; very thinly covered with sedimentary rocks, of which
the total mean thickness probably does not exceed 100 feet.</p>
<p>This vast mass of the primitive granitic crust of the earth
has been fractured as follows, namely,&mdash;</p>
<p>First and principally along the line of the western face of
the Darling Range, when the eastern side or lip of the fractured
mass was slightly lifted, but without tilting, so as to form the
barren and elevated tract of country which we call the Darling
Range, having a mean elevation of 1200 or 1400 feet above the
level of the sea; and at the same epoch probably the western side
sunk by a vertical space about equal to that through which the
eastern side was elevated.</p>
<p>Secondly, by numerous fractures subordinate and more or less
perpendicular to the line of the former, and extending through
the upheaved mass to lineal distances of as much as 100 miles, in
the cases of the gorges and valleys of the Avon, the Moore, the
Murray, and their tributaries respectively; and by many smaller
gorges in the western face of the Range, which for the most part
now possess small streams of permanent water.</p>
<p>Through these lines of fracture no eruptive rock such as
basalt, serpentine, or the eruptive granites, has come to the
surface; the superior quality of soil, now found in many
localities of the valleys which these lines of fissures have
formed, being due solely to its derivation, in such cases, from a
portion of the primitive granite originally more deeply bedded
than that from the decomposition of which the soil, in other and
generally higher localities, has been derived, which deeply
bedded granite, by the fractures, accompanied, as they probably
were, by a very slight elevation, has been brought to the
surface.</p>
<p>The upper portions of all primitive granites, as originally
deposited or consolidated from fusion, containing the mineral
elements of agricultural fertility only in very small
proportions, but the lower portions, under like conditions,
generally containing them largely, it is only along lines of deep
fracture of the primitive granite, and near the outlets of
drainage from these lines, that granite soils of great
agricultural fertility are likely to be found, because it is
along such lines only that granite of an original deep bedding,
that is of great specific gravity and abounding in the mineral
elements of agricultural fertility, will have supplied the
materials of the soil.</p>
<p>No other portion of the earth's surface perhaps possesses a
district so extensive as the one under review, in which the
distribution of agricultural fertility can be so directly and
certainly traced to the igneous rocks from which its soil has
been derived.</p>
<p>Secondly, as to the physical features of its surface.</p>
<p>In the Darling Range the numerous subordinate features of the
granitic crust, which attended the great meridional fracture and
subsequent slight elevation which in fact formed the range, are
now exhibited in numerous gorges and valleys, of a which many
possess a steepness of side and a massiveness of exposed granite
which impart a certain grandeur and romantic wildness to them,
but they are generally very deficient in agricultural
fertility&mdash;a fact which probably is due to the shortness of
the lines of fracture, which would tend to prevent the exposure
of any deeply-bedded granite to the surface.</p>
<p>As the above-described lines of fracture extend only very
short distances eastward of the Avon Valley, namely, along the
lower portions of the courses of the Toodyay, the Salt River, the
Mackie, the Dale, &amp;c., the country eastward of the Avon, to
the eastern limit of its drainage basin, which as already stated,
nearly coincides with the meridian of 118 d. 30 m., E., is very
flat, having a general slope of perhaps 2 feet per mile towards
the south-west.</p>
<p>The few low and generally well-rounded hills, and short ranges
of such like hills, scattered over this country, are due to
intumescencies of the primitive granite of a purely topical
character, and referable, I believe, to forces acting during the
original consolidation of the crust, which will be described in a
subsequent part of this Journal.</p>
<p>These low hills are divided from each other by wide shallow
valleys, of which, some appear to possess no outlet of
drainage.</p>
<p>Partially metamorphosed schists and ferruginous conglomerates
have a much greater extension and thickness in the Darling Range
than to the east of the Avon Valley.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a fine-grained hard white sandstone, which
at the extreme east of the country subsequently explored by us,
gradually passes into a very hard marl, immediately underlies the
red surface soils of the entire district eastward of the Avon,
filling up the cavities of the granitic crust. This rock I have
not found in the Darling Range.</p>
<p>In the portion of this country which lies between the Avon
Valley and a line parallel to it, but distant from it 40 miles to
the east, here intumescences of the granite are comparatively
rare, its intumescences being for the most part covered with a
very thin coating of soil, always poor and silicious, but between
the meridians of Mount Stirling and that of Mr Smith's station
numerous and generally most massive projections of bare rock
impart a very peculiar and striking physiognomy to the country,
and, probably from having been more deeply worn down than those
to the westward of them, have given a somewhat better, though
nevertheless still poor and silicious soil to the adjacent
country.</p>
<p>Taking the country intervening between the Avon Valley and the
meridian of Mr Smith's station 118 d. E., as one whole, for
economical purposes I should classify its surface as follows,
namely:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. A light silicious soil, containing a fair quantity of
decaying vegetable matter, which has given it a somewhat dark
colour, bearing a large quantity of jam and sandalwood trees, and
covered with a poor wiry grass. Area, 30 per cent of the
whole.</p>
<p>2nd. Sand-plains of a very poor quartzose soil; so deficient
in herbage as not to be likely to be rented from the Crown in
pastoral leases. Area, 40 per cent.</p>
<p>3rd. Lake bottoms generally of white sand, but of which the
sandy floors are in one or two cases colored red. Area, 1 per
cent.</p>
<p>4th. Stiff brownish yellow colored clays, generally bearing
large quantities of well-grown woorock morrel, and flurted
[<i>sic</i>] gum trees, but of so barren a nature that probably
they will remain, uncultivated until a rural population of
considerable density shall be established in this colony. Area,
28 per cent.</p>
<p>5th. Surfaces of bare rock. Area, 1 per cent.</p>
<p>Of the above-described classes of soils the only one which can
be considered to possess any value for present purposes is that
first described; all of which I think is likely to be embraced in
pastoral leases in the course of a few years.</p>
<p>In the last 3 or 4 miles of the track to Mr Smith's station we
observed a great improvement in the soil and grasses of the
country, in fact, from what I observed of Mr Smith's run, both on
this occasion and subsequently on our return to it, I am inclined
to estimate its agricultural and pastoral capacities as quite
equal to those of the average of the grants in the York or
Toodyay districts.</p>
<p>From comparing notes with Harris the hut keeper here, and from
my observation of the state of the grass, and of the water
contained in the rocks and gullies here, I infer that much more
rain has fallen in this neighbourhood during the months of March
and April than in the York district.</p>
<p>As we have completed the 98 miles of the track from York to
this point in 4½ days travelling, I think we have made very
satisfactory progress, considering the untrained and wild state
of many of our horses at starting, our own inexperience in this
business, and the newness and imperfect finish and fitting of
much cf our gear, which necessitates very frequent readjustments
of packs and loads in the progress of each day's journey.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 12.&mdash;All the party, with
exception of myself, have been very fully occupied the whole of
this day, in repacking and registering the contents of every
bag&mdash;an operation which has been immediately necessitated by
our having to distribute among our 16 horses an additional burden
of 1100 lbs. weight of flour and pork, which Grindall's cart has
brought us so far, and which will increase their loads up to
nearly 200 lbs. each horse.</p>
<p>By Mr Bayly having very kindly undertaken to assist in and
superintend the above operation, I have been enabled to write
sundry letters which the pressing occupations of the last two
months in connection with the organization of this party, and
with the departure of my wife and of four of our children to
England, for which she sailed only on the day before I finally
left Fremantle, namely, the 25th ultimo, had compelled me to
defer till the last moment.</p>
<p>With Harris' aid I succeeded in engaging a native of this
locality, whose name is Muncup, to accompany us as guide for some
few days' journey, which I hope will enable us to avoid many of
the thickets, the great anticipatory obstacle to our future
progress, and which are generally supposed to attain a maximum
development not far to the eastward of this meridian.</p>
<p>Note.&mdash;I may here observe that subsequent experience in
both our outward and homeward tracks has shown that the
conceptions of the extent and impenetrability of these thickets
hitherto entertained, are very exaggerated, unless it be assumed
that they have a far greater development to the north of our
track, than along its line&mdash;an assumption for which at
present we possess no sufficient grounds, in our journey I think
we found no thicket of a width of one mile, or of a larger area
than 5 or 6 square miles, to the best of my judgment; nor did we
find our previous conceptions of the difficulty of penetrating
better founded than our estimates of their extent.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 13.&mdash;Sat down to breakfast at
daylight, nevertheless we could not complete our preparations for
a final start until 10h.30m. a.m.; so much time is still required
for the catching, saddling, and loading so many horses, although
the kind and agreeable companion of our journey so far, Mr Bayly,
and his native servant, rendered us all the assistance in their
power; but at the hour named our party was again fairly in
motion, and having bid adieu to Mr Bayly, whose cheerful and
obliging nature had endeared him to all the party, and whom as he
was about to start forthwith on his return to York, we naturally
looked on as our last link or connexion for a time with civilized
life, and entrusted to his charge our last letters, we commenced
our journey into the <i>terra incognita</i> of South Western
Central Australia.</p>
<p>At three miles, principally through a well-grassed country, we
passed the fine bald rock of Narimbeen, which I subsequently
ascertained to be the Emu Hill of Roe and Moore's track of 1836,
and of which the latitude is 32 d. 4m. S., longitude 118 d. 7m.
E., and which was the farthest point eastward of York reached by
Mr Hargraves in his late Journey through the interior of the
colony for the investigation of the auriferous qualities of its
rocks, which I am afraid are very poor, and at 8 p.m. reached
another large bald hill of which the native name is Kunkoming,
bearing from Narimbeen about 10 miles east. Travelling distance
about 14 miles, our naive guide having taken as around many small
thickets, which we might without much difficulty have gone
through.</p>
<p>At Kumkoming we found a small quantity of good land, with
excellent grass and plenty of water.</p>
<p>We all walked the entire distance to-day, our riding horses
carrying a portion of the flour, brought up by Grindall's cart as
far Mr. Smith's station.</p>
<p>No detention arose in our journey to-day, and the horses now
walk steadily in one track, fol lowing the leading horse, which
is led by Kowitch.</p>
<p>This evening I commenced the practice of reading one chapter
of the Bible and repeating a few short prayers to the party,
before they turn in to rest. I was glad to observe that all
cheerfully and cordially approved my announced intention to
pursue this practice every evening; an intention which I am happy
to say was realized throughout the remainder of the journey.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 14.&mdash;From Kumkoming to
Tampin. Direct distance 6 miles; travelling distance 8 miles;
bearing E. 30 d. S. Hour of starting 2 p.m.</p>
<p>The cause of our having made so late a start to-day is as
follows:&mdash; Charley, the pony supplied by Mr H. Monger for
the use of the Expedition, and a very strong wild, high-spirited
animal, broke the tether rope with which he was left to feed last
night, as he was too wild to be hobbled.</p>
<p>In order to catch him this morning, after spending a whole
forenoon in abortive attempts to effect that purpose, we had to
erect a stockyard, loose and turn out again all the other horses,
and then having allowed a lapse of two or three hours that he
might quietly rejoin them, we drove the whole in a mob into the
stockyard, where, after exercising many precautions to prevent
his escape, we at length succeeded in roping him.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 15&mdash;Rain commenced to fell at
5 a.m. and as it soon poured heavily, and showed little promise
of clearing up in the course of the day, I resolved to halt at
Tampin all day, there being abundant grass for the horses all
round the hill which is very extensive and lofty.</p>
<p>Judging from the large quantity of grass-covered land which I
can see from the summit of this hill, stretching to the east and
south, and from the quality of the soil adjacent to the hill, I
think that a good sheep run might be formed here, of course
assuming that I saw only a small portion of the good land, which
really exists in its vicinity.</p>
<p>This evening the native Tommy, who has accompanied us from
York in the supernumerary capacity of being a friend of
Kowitch's, brought in a small doe kangaroo, being the first
kangaroo shot by any of our party so far, which led us to reflect
that in our whole journey from York to this point, or nearly 130
miles of travelling, the sum total of all the kangaroos seen by
all the members of the party taken collectively is not more than
9 or 10.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 16.&mdash;Yesterday's heavy and
continuous rain ceased about 9 p.m., so that at 9 a.m., this
morning we started on, and at about 4 p.m. reached another, bald
hill, with a grove of mountain oaks around its base, and with
fair feed around it for the horses. Travelling distance 20 miles.
Direct distance 17 miles E. ½ S. The country traversed, except
within a mile of Tampin, very poor; alternately sand-plains and
thickets. All very tired and hungry when our day's march was
concluded.</p>
<p>The country was so soft and boggy, except on the sand-plains,
that the horses constantly sunk in it halfway up to their knees
and hocks; and two or three times I sank over my
boots&mdash;rather high half boots. Of course this was a
consequence of yesterday's heavy rain; but at the same time it
raises formidable apprehensions as to the practicability of
traversing this country in mid winter.</p>
<p>The native Tommy left us this morning with my full consent, as
I don't think that his services are required. He took charge of a
letter to Mr Bayly; and I have omitted to record that Muncup
absconded from our service, doubtless not liking the alternative
of having either to accompany us all through our intended
journey, or deserting us at a greater distance from his own
country, Comining, to run a proportionally greater risk of being
speared on his way home. Our strength therefore is reduced to the
5 members proper of the party.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Sunday, May</span> 17.&mdash;I am induced to
make a short stage to-day, instead of resting through it, as I
should prefer to do, by the following reasons:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. Weather compelled us to rest all Friday. We also rested
all Tuesday, to readjust and register our loads, consequently the
horses do not require rest to-day.</p>
<p>2nd.&mdash;A fine bald hill which I take to be Borayukkin,
spoken of in terms of high commendation by Muncup for the grass
around it, is visible at a distance of 9 or 10 miles E. 25 d.
N.</p>
<p>Accordingly, at 10 a.m., we start, and at lh. 30 m. reach this
hill, at which, to our disappointment, we find only poor feed for
our horses, but plenty of water. Travelling distance 10
miles.</p>
<p>The country traversed to-day consists of an alternation of
sand-plains and thickets of many different sorts, and the soil
for the most part wretchedly poor. In fact the appearance of the
country visible from the top of this bald hill is unpromising in
the extreme.</p>
<p>Both yesterday and to-day we noticed a few isolated
individuals of a species of Mimosa, quite new to me, and an erect
tree-like stem and foliation; also on the sand-plains a thin
sprinkling of a true pine, or fir, of dwarf dimensions, the
height not exceeding 10 feet, but bearing very long spines. They
appear to be as stunted and unthriving as those discovered by
polar navigators on the Arctic shores of America and Asia, but
from physical causes, directly the reverse of those which operate
there: namely, here, intense heat and dryness of summer climate,
and a sterile silicious soil; there, an intensely cold and humid
climate, combined with great richness of soil.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 18.&mdash;Start at 7h.30m. a.m.,
being the earliest start which we have yet effected, although we
always turn out at the first dawn of day, and generally have
finished breakfast before sunrise, and at 11h.30m. a.m. reach a
very hemispherically-shaped bald hill, with plenty of grass about
its base and of water in the cavities of its surface. Travelling
distance 11 miles; direct distance 9½ miles N.E. Of the country
traversed about 4 miles of our track lay through sand-plains,
small thickets, and forest-covered hill-sides, and the remaining
7 miles through a rich looking, red colored alluvial flat,
presenting everywhere unmistakeable indications of having
recently been swept by a violent storm flood, which made the soil
in many places very boggy.</p>
<p>It being too early in the day to stop, and having, in a survey
of the adjacent country from the top of this hill, discovered
another large bald rock, at an estimated distance of about 20
miles N.E., and no other rock being visible to the eastward or
north ward, we proceed on, steering for this rock, and at about 6
p.m., having travelled nearly the entire route through a
continuation of the same rich looking but wearisome and
monotonous flat, which we had traversed in the forenoon, without
finding a drop of water, or any fair grass, as it was getting
dark, and Horses and ourselves were nearly knocked up, we halted,
and tied the horses up short to trees, without unloading them,
whilst Kowitch rode one of them, in the direction which appeared
most likely to lead out of the flat, in which we knew well no
water would be found, to endeavour to find water and grass if
possible; though I entertained little hope of his success.</p>
<p>At the expiration of less than one hour Kowitch returned,
reporting that he had found a small patch of fine grass, but
without water, at a distance of a mile or so out of the valley.
To this we at once proceeded, reaching it about 7 p.m. nearly
exhausted, both ourselves and horses. Travelling distance from
the hemispherical hill 16 miles; direct distance 14 miles;
bearing N.E.</p>
<p>As we could find no water, and had carried none in our water
tins, not anticipating any difficulty from want of it after the
recent heavy rain at Tampin, which evidently had extended for in
this direction, we had to make our supper without tea to wash it
down. None of us however complained of a thirst, as we had all
drunk in the middle of the day at the hemispherical hill, and I
slept as comfortably and soundly as usual.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 19.&mdash;By daylight we were all
up, searching for water, which the discovery over-night of a
hallow gully trending towards the flat, gave us good hope of. In
less than an hour Hall and myself found a hole in the gully
containing some gallons of muddy water, which however was quickly
conveyed into the camp, and in a process of boiling for our
breakfast, for which we had good appetites, as from fear of
thirst we had eaten little the evening before.</p>
<p>Our horses, having been watered at the bald hill which we
passed in the forenoon, did not suffer from thirst, and had
abundance of excellent grass, which grew on a small clear patch
of a red, sticky and crumbly soil, on a hill-side, exactly
similar to the clear patches of fine rich soil to be found in
many localities of the Avon Valley, and which have been ascribed
(as I think, very erroneously,) to a basaltic derivation, but
which, as I do not admit the existence of basalt in that
district, I ascribe to the decomposition of a deeply bedded
granite, brought to the surface in the rupturing of the granitic
crust which formed that valley.</p>
<p>If my theory of the production of the clear patches of rich
soil in the Avon Valley be correct, it is probable that a very
limited rupturing of the crust has taken place in the vicinity of
this patch of grass, and exposed to atmospheric action a small
mass of granite of an original deep bedding.</p>
<p>I may here observe that throughout our entire journey eastward
of Smith's station, this is the only patch of that very peculiar
sort of soil which we observed, which affords to my mind one of
the many indications of an unbroken crust of primitive granite
which this country presents, and which constitutes its great
geological peculiarity.</p>
<p>Start at 9.40 a.m., and at 4.30 p.m. reach another small bald
hill. Travelling distance 18 miles; direct distance 16 miles.
Course, north-east.</p>
<p>Of our track to-day, 14 miles lay through a rich, red colored,
rotten looking alluvial flat, but bearing little grass. Like that
traversed on the previous days, it presented many indications of
having been swept by a recent storm-flood; nevertheless it was
quite destitute of surface water, having no gullies or other
channels in which the surface water could collect and be
retained.</p>
<p>As we did not discover this bald bill until quite close to it,
and both ourselves and horses were well tired, we were well
pleased with our fortune in finding it, and in grateful
recollection of Mr Bayly's agreeable society and kindness in
accompanying us from York to Smith's station, we all concurred in
a wish to call it Mount Bayly.</p>
<p>The position of this bare rock is latitude longitude; and on
our homeward route we learnt from the natives who then
accompanied us, that its native name is.</p>
<p>From the top of Mount Bayly this morning I observed a very
remarkable bald hill, apparently of far greater size and
prominence than any one which we have yet seen, and of a somewhat
square form, with very lofty and steep sides. Its bearing from
Mount Bayly is N. ½ W. by compass.</p>
<p>To this vast mass of rock I respectfully propose to attach the
name of His Excellency Governor Hampton, who has taken a warm
interest in the organization of this Expedition, and has
overruled many difficulties which threatened to obstruct its
realization.</p>
<p>Of this hill&mdash;the Mount Hampton I hope of the future maps
of this colony&mdash;I subsequently ascertained the native name
to be Boogarring. Its latitude is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;
longitude&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>As Mount Hampton bears rather to the west of north&mdash;but
our object is to make both easting and northing&mdash;I selected
for our destination to-night another and much smaller bald hill,
bearing N.N.E. * from the summit of Mount Bayly.</p>
<p>Start at 9.30 a.m.; reach intended bald hill at 2 p.m.;
travelling distance 14 miles; direct distance 13 miles.</p>
<p>Of the country traversed to-day about 10 miles of our track
lay through a similar rich, red colored, alluvial bottom or
valley, to that which we have travelled on many previous days.
Sand plains, thickets and hill tops occupied the rest of the
country traversed.</p>
<p>On the hillside today we picked up several small fragments of
gypsum, consisting of thin, colorless, translucent shiny plates,
adhering face to face.</p>
<p>From the top of this hill the country all round appears to be
covered with grass to a distance of 3 miles, and I think it may
safely be assumed that one flock of sheep may be kept to every 2
bald hills eastward of Mr Smith's station, as there is much grass
on many of the sand-plains, and if the rich alluvial valley
bottoms be covered with grass in the spring and early summer,
this estimate may be largely increased, especially as I
confidently believe that the introduction of stock into this
district will develop a growth of grass on the undoubtedly rich
alluvial soils of the wide valleys corresponding to their evident
fertility of soil.</p>
<p>The scantiness of the existing plant of grass in these valleys
I attribute solely to the absence of any grass eating animals and
I do not doubt that the introduction of these, particularly if it
be accompanied with a small amount of artificial drainage, will
soon develop a rich growth of grass in all the alluvial soils of
this district.</p>
<p>Our horses bogged several times to-day, and it is evident that
heavier and more violent rain has fallen here lately, than
further to the westward, and I suspect on the same day as that on
which it rained at Tampin, from which we are now distant nearly
100 miles north-east. This fact, from which I infer that this
country must be nearly untraversable from bogginess in the depth
of winter, has determined me make more northing, until I approach
the parallel 30d. S., as I think it probable that the winter
climate in South-western Central Australia at that parallel, and
to the north of it, must be much drier than the districts nearer
the coast, and I also suspect that the country further to the
north is more open.</p>
<p>I have endeavored, since leaving Mr Smith's station, to refer
the distribution of the bald masses of granite to some general
lines of geographical direction, such as, according to the now
received theories of the development of mountain systems, they
would have, if their elevation had been due to any deeply seated
elevatory forces; in which case not only, it is probable, the
granitic crust would have been ruptured, of which I could nowhere
discover any satisfactory indications, but the lines of rupture
would have coincided with planes of great circles of the
sphere.</p>
<p>However their distribution appears to be so arbitrary,
generally being isolated, sometimes forming short ranges whose
axes have every variety of bearing, their form is so rounded, the
wide flat valleys which intervene between them have such an
uniform level from which they (the hills) spring up to a very
uniform elevation, that it is equally difficult to ascribe their
elevation to any deeply seated elevatory forces, or to the
dislocations and displacements of level, which might be
incidental to numerous local rupturings of the crust, due to the
vast lateral contractile force developed by the loss of heat, to
which the great fissures, now occupied by Avon and other river
valleys, are undoubtedly attributable, were any evidences of such
subordinate rupturings to be found on a careful examination of
this country. But since, as I have already stated, the whole
contour of the country is at variance with the assumption of such
local rupturings, I must conclude that a true theory of their
elevation must refer them to other forces than those which have
determined the elevation of mountain ranges generally.</p>
<p>But whatever the forces, and whatever the epoch, of elevation
of these singular and magnificent masses above the general
surface of the granitic crust of the district, may have been, the
whole contour of the country strongly suggests this proposition,
namely, that, subsequently to their elevation, the ocean has
covered this country for vast ages, and that its subsequent
emergence from the ocean has been due to no positive elevatory
force of a local or topical character.</p>
<p>As the geological structure and the palaeontology of
South-western Australia generally, have hitherto been so little
investigated, and as I believe the geological structure of the
district which I am now exploring to be so intimately connected
with, that of the Avon valley and of the Darling Range, the
reader will excuse me for recording here the fact that recently
discovered and obtained in an argillaceous shale forming the
subsoil of a field in the Dale district (the Dale being a
tributary of the Avon, and traversing a strongly defined fissure
of the granite springing from the grand fissure occupied by the
Avon valley,) the shale apparently having a bedding conformable
to the slope of the granitic sides of the valley, several well
preserved fossil specimens of a long, jointed seaweed, which
probably had grown <i>in situ</i> when the fissures now occupied
by the Avon valley and its tributaries formed an arm of the sea;
at which epoch, assuming, as there are just reasons for doing,
that the country eastward of 118d. E., and the Avon district had
the same relative levels then as now, the former must have been
covered with a sea, in the chronic shoaling of which these bald
hills gradually reached the surface and formed an archipelago of
numberless rocky islets.</p>
<p>As, from the character of the fossil remains above mentioned,
and from other circumstances, I infer the era of the elevation of
the Avon valley above the sea to be pliocene, on the assumption
made in the preceding paragraph I infer that also to be the era
of the retirement of the ocean from the portion of Western
Australia which I am now exploring.</p>
<p>I hope the reader will not take it amiss if I endeavor to
compensate him for wading through these misty speculations as to
the works of nature in ages so inconceivably remote in the past,
by submitting a suggestion of a very practical nature an
proximate application, with reference to the disposal of these
alluvial bottoms to future agricultural settlers, for whose use
they appear to be so peculiarly adapted.</p>
<p>My suggestion is as follows, namely, that an accurate survey
ought to precede the opening of the soil of any one of these
valleys to freehold or tillage lease occupation, and that in this
survey a strip of at least 2 chains in width, following the axis
of the valley, be marked out as a reserve for the following
purposes of imperative local necessity or utility to its future
occupants, namely, a site for an arterial drain and main district
road.</p>
<p>Artificial arterial drainage will be urgently required in most
or all of these valleys, whenever they shall be occupied by an
agricultural population, as they are either entirely destitute of
natural surface drain age, or that natural drainage is so
imperfect as only to operate once in 10 or 12 years, when the
chain of lakes passing Mount Stirling (Munlyeen) is converted
into a stream of 3 or 4 miles in width, and of a depth of about 3
feet, flowing at a gentle velocity into the Avon, about 35 miles
higher up the valley than York.</p>
<p>It is evident that not one-millionth part of the mean annual
rainfall of this country can be discharged into the ocean by the
natural drainage of the surface; the remainder must be evaporated
by the summer sun, under, we assume, the existence of subtelluric
channels of drainage into the ocean along the face of the granite
crust.</p>
<p>Many specimens of gypsum were picked up to-day, and one
specimen of a shale, approaching in texture to a soft slate, of a
grey color.</p>
<p>We also noticed to-day, for the first time, many of masses of
the solid rock cropping out on hill-sides and valley bottoms,
instead of, as previously, at the summits of the hills. I think
this is evidence of the extreme thinness of the sedimentary rocks
which here cover the granite.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 21.&mdash;Partly in consequence of
the indications of a wet day, which the morning presented, and
partly to recruit our horses on the excellent feed which abounds
about this rock, I have resolved to rest here to-day.</p>
<p>Mr Robinson and Kowitch, immediately after our early
breakfast, which is generally concluded by sunrise, took their
guns in search of game, and at noon returned with one emu, which
Kowitch had shot on Mount Hampton, which bears from us W. by N.,
distance 3 miles.</p>
<p>With reference to the pastoral capacity of the country,
eastward and northward of Mr Smith's station, as far as Mount
Hampton, I should estimate it as equal to feed 1000 sheep per
25,000 acres of its entire surface, a capacity which, however low
and small it may appear in the conception of English farmers, no
large district of this Colony, yet explored, has been found to
possess for its entire surface. But in this estimate I make the
following assumptions, namely, that</p>
<p>1st&mdash;The valley bottoms, which, in spite of their evident
fertility of soil, now carry only a very thin plant of grass,
will from the depasturing of this soon be covered with a thick
grass suited to their soil.</p>
<p>2nd&mdash;That the grass elsewhere, which is generally coarse,
and intermixed with the withered leaves and stalks of two or
three years' growth, will improve much in quality from close
cropping.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 22.&mdash;Started at 9.30 a.m.,
and at 3 p.m. reached camping ground, where we found sufficient
water for ourselves, but not for out horses, in a hole in a thick
stratum of ironstone. Travelling distance, 13½ miles. Direct
distance, 12 miles N.E.½E.</p>
<p>Of this day's route, about 7 miles lay through rich, alluvial
flat land, of a color and texture apparently, rather superior to
any traversed on previous days. Of the remainder, about one-half
was through rich ground, one half over sand-plains. On much of
the sand plains and hilly ground was fair feed for sheep or
horses, and better grass than usual on the flat land, which I
attribute principally to the flat land being drier and apparently
better drained than that traversed on previous days.</p>
<p>The last two miles, previously to reaching the camping ground,
lay through some of the best land we have yet traversed, covered
with splendid grass, and of texture and colour very similar to
that of Grady's meadow, near York.</p>
<p>A small species of cedar grows very abundantly in the flat
land which we traversed the last two days, sometimes in clumps,
sometimes as isolated trees; and from many of the cedar clumps a
few tall woorock or morrel trees project, giving these flats a
diversity and beauty of arboreal scenery which is rare in this
Colony.</p>
<p>We have passed hardly any scrub, deserving the character of a
thicket, to-day; and that which we have passed has been in narrow
strips, of a width seldom exceeding 100 yards.</p>
<p>The horses are feeding on first-rate grass, as in fact they
have been nearly every night since leaving Smith's station;
nevertheless it is evident that we are taking out of them all the
work which they can well go through, although they rested all
yesterday, and the distances which they travel daily do not
appear large. The fact is that their loads are very heavy, nearly
200lbs each, and the ground is very soft and boggy from the late
rain.</p>
<p>I have noticed a considerable change in the color and
constitution of the granite gradually showing itself during the
past week. The color is changing from a pale grey to a pale
yellow, and the quartz is being replaced by feldspar, of which
very large crystals, generally of 2 or more inches in the edge,
are very abundantly exhibited, especially in the thin dykes with
which nearly all these masses are intersected. The crystals of
feldspar also are cemented together with a very red colored
paste.</p>
<p>I may here further record that on the top of the bald hill, at
which we encamped last night, as well as on the tops of many
previously passed, are many vast blocks of detached granite,
generally of a thickness of 6 or 7 feet, always much water-worn,
particularly at their under surfaces in contact with the parent
rock. These I take to be the few surviving fragments of vast
sheaths of granite, which at some vastly remote epoch of the
history of our planet, in the secular progressive cooling of the
granitic crust, peeled of and no doubt simultaneously were
shattered into innumerable vast angular blocks&mdash;a theory
which the examination of the Karkalin rock in the latter part of
the journey has strongly confirmed in my mind.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 23.&mdash;Although we sat down to
breakfast at 5.30 a.m., we did not effect a start before 8.30
a.m., so long a time does it still take to collect, saddle, and
load so many horses. At 4.15 p.m. we reached a fair camping
ground, rather to our surprise, as we did not observe any
indications of rock, and its ever attend ant, grass and water,
until we were within 100 yards of them. Travelling distance 22
miles; direct distance 19 miles E. ½ N.</p>
<p>Both ourselves and horses were well tired when we got in; for
22 miles through a pathless bush, in great part thickly covered
with dead wood, is a day's work sufficient to fatigue both man
and horse, and I may say that we have providentially, if I may so
without presumption, been directed to water and grass, quite late
in the day, three times during the past week, when we all
expected to have to spend the night without either.</p>
<p>The country traversed has been less boggy today in than
heretofore; nevertheless it has every appearance of having been
swept by the same storm of rain which detained us at Tampin on
the 15th instant.</p>
<p>About 3 miles of our route lay through the same rich alluvial
flats as traversed on previous days: about 12 miles through open
sand-plains, the remainder over hills and hill-sides, more or
less covered with brushwood and belts of thicket; the latter
however being not nearly so thick and difficult of passage
through as those further to the westward, and I suspect that we
have now left behind the worst of these. If so, our
preconceptions as to the difficulty of traversing them were very
exaggerated.</p>
<p>As a brief description of the several varieties of thicket
which this country presents may not be uninteresting to the
colonial reader, I will now submit the following classification
and description of all the varieties which we have yet
observed.</p>
<p>1st.&mdash;Tammar, so named from a species of small kangaroo
which abound in them, and which at certain seasons of the year
the natives hunt in combination&mdash;a principle of action
rarely adopted by them.</p>
<p>This thicket is constituted solely of a dwarf species of
eucalyptus, growing in fine rods from underground stems, to an
uniform height of 15 or 20 feet; like copses of ash or hazelwood
in England.</p>
<p>This thicket grows always on high land, of a stiff, poor
nature; and the rods would probably be of great service for
hurdle-making, and other purposes of rural economy.</p>
<p>The rods are so thickly set on the ground that the natives
cannot employ their dogs to hunt the Tammars, consequently the
combined action above spoken of.</p>
<p>2nd.&mdash;Marlock. This is constituted solely of another and
still smaller dwarf species of eucalyptus than the former, as it
seldom attains a height seeding 6 or 7 feet. Its site is
generally the lower at of a hill-side, on a damp and sandy soil.
It is much more difficult of penetration than Tam mar.</p>
<p>3rd.&mdash;Spearwood. Site, valley bottoms and lower parts of
hill-sides; soil, always wet, but of clay or sand
indifferently.</p>
<p>4th.&mdash;Jam. A dwarf species; branching from near the
ground. Sites, a sandy, low, and wet soil.</p>
<p>5th.&mdash;Cedar. A dwarf species; branching from near the
ground; frequently much intermixed with the dwarf jam. Site,
sandy ground, generally wet.</p>
<p>6th.&mdash;Tea-tree. A dwarf species; site, clayey ground, but
with such slope as to prevent the water from stagnating on
it.</p>
<p>As to difficulty of penetration, I think the cedar and
spearwood the worst; nevertheless in our line of route none of
them approached in this respect to what we had anticipated. In
fact, I think they can scarcely be considered to present a
formidable obstacle to an exploring party, much less to the
traversing the country by settlers' drays, stock, &amp;c., and as
to extent, we observed none that appeared to have a length of
more than 7 or 8 miles.</p>
<p>This is the first bright sunshiny day which we have had since
leaving Mr Smith's station, but the cloudy mild weather
previously experienced, is more suitable to our purpose.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Sunday, May</span> 24.&mdash;In the forenoon
Mr Robinson and Kowitch go out with guns to look for game; and
with spyglass and compass to try to discover another bald hill
eastward or northward of us, to which we may steer to-morrow.
Edwards inspects and fresh loads all the firearms, as our present
distance from York makes this precaution necessary. I take
observations for latitude and longitude.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I read the Church Service for the day to all
the party.</p>
<p>Robinson and Kowitch returned without success, both as to game
and the discovery of more bald hills. We have seen neither
kangaroo nor emu since leaving Mount Hampton, and it is evident
that this country is nearly, if not quite, destitute of the
larger species of game.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 25.&mdash;Finished breakfast by
daylight, in hope to make an early start, but on collecting the
horses we found that the horse supplied by Mr Taylor had strayed
back along our track, he being one of which we did not hobble
yesterday, as we thought that they would not leave the rest,
which were hobbled.</p>
<p>This fact being, I despatched Messrs. Robinson and Edwards in
search of him.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Kowitch and myself walked to a conspicuous
hill capped with a thick bed of ironstone, distant about 4½ miles
east, or, as it proved, on inspection, to be, a very fine-grained
crystalline schist, strongly impregnated with iron.</p>
<p>In the crest of the gorge which intervenes between this and
the adjacent hill to the north, a fine dyke of quartz, at least
10 feet wide, broke through the surface, which vein, where
exposed, was evidently much waterworn.</p>
<p>In this walk I observed another gnow's nest, which bad been
freshly scratched out this morning, as those which we have
previously seen mostly have been, for use next season of
laying.</p>
<p>I record this fact, as I think it difficult to account for,
since the hen bird, which continues to use the same nest all her
life, does not commence to deposit eggs until the latter part of
September or early in October, and after this scratching of the
surface of the nest in May, done, as Kowitch tells us, always by
the male bird, he appears not to revisit the nest all through the
winter.</p>
<p>The nests themselves consist of holes in the ground (a
gravelly soil is generally selected) about 2 feet deep, and of
that diameter; which hole is filled with dry sticks, leaves,
grass, &amp;c., in which the female deposits her eggs in layers.
This nest is enclosed in a ring of the excavated soil of 5 or 6
feet in diameter and of a thickness of 18 or 20 inches.</p>
<p>From the ironstone capped hill which we visited this
afternoon, we had the pleasure of discovering, with the aid of a
telescope, the beds of 4 lakes, stretching from north-east to
south-east, and of which one certainly contains water. To this I
shall remove our camp to-morrow.</p>
<p>There is an unusually large native well or water hole, still
full nearly to the fop, at a distance of of one hundred yards
from our camp.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 26.&mdash;Messrs. Robinson and
Edwards did not make their appearance last night. At 11 a.m.
despatched Hall and Kowitch with 12 horses to the lake discovered
by us yesterday; whilst I remain here, awaiting the arrival of
Robinson, Edwards, and the missing horse.</p>
<p>At about 2 p.m. Robinson and Edwards arrive having overtaken
the missing horse at the bald hill at which we encamped on Friday
evening; in fact at two days' journey from our present camp.
After they had rested about an hour, we followed Hall and Kowitch
to the lakes discovered yesterday, where we encamped on poor
feed. Direct distance 6 miles due east.</p>
<p>From the top of the red-colored hill above mentioned to the
nearest lake is about 3 miles, of a apparently rich red wheat
soil, but at present carrying little grass, which I attribute
both to want of drainage and to the absence of any grass eating
fauna.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 27.&mdash;In consequence of the
poor feed the horses strayed so much last night that all of them
were not got in before noon. Started at 0.30 p.m., and reached
our camping ground by the side of a small lake of muddy fresh
water, but again with poor feed around, at 3.30 p.m. Direct
distance 7 miles N.N.E.</p>
<p>Our route to-day has been near the margin of a chain of lakes,
all of which now contain a little water, but not of a greater
depth than 2 or 3 inches.</p>
<p>This chain of lakes, so far as we can judge at present,
appears to trend from the N.E., which appears also to be the
direction from which the country has a slight slope; and I
suspect that this chain of lakes must be a line of drainage from
the interior, if they ever overflow from one into another. Of
which however we could discover no indication.</p>
<p>The width of the valley in which they are placed varies from 3
to 5 miles, of which width perhaps four-fifths are now occupied
by samphire flats, a few inches above the level of the present
water; but the valley is so flat that a maximum depth of 2 feet
of water in the lakes would cover the whole valley to a width of
4 or 5 miles.</p>
<p>The hills slope into this valley with such a gentle descent,
that their sides have no deeply-cut gullies, and in fact most
imperfectly drained.</p>
<p>Their soil is either loam, clay or sand, of a rich red color,
and much apparent mellowness and fertility, and I ascribe the
deficiency of grass on them solely to the want of drainage and of
a grass-eating fauna. I have no doubt that on the introduction of
sheep, grass will rapidly spread over them.</p>
<p>The samphire flats, which now contain a good deal of short
grass, I believe will constitute very good runs for sheep.</p>
<p>We have seen a very few ducks on these lakes, and they were
too wild to allow us to get near them.</p>
<p>Altogether I am very strongly impressed with the opinion that
nature has here supplied the elements of agricultural wealth with
a most liberal hand, but these are attended with such conditions,
climatic and hypsometric, as that science, capital, and labor,
must be applied on a huge scale before she will surrender to the
use of civilized man the treasures of agricultural fertility
which she has placed here.</p>
<p>The subsoil of the samphire flats is everywhere a fine-grained
sand of a dull white color. This is covered with a fine red
alluvial soil of 8 or 10 inches in thickness, evidently derived
from the adjacent hill-sides.</p>
<p>The stratum of fine-grained white sand, which appears to
occupy the whole width of the valley, and appears identical in
constitution with the fine-grained white sandstone which
underlies the red surface soils throughout all this country, I
should refer to an age when the entire surface of this portion of
Australia was a portion of the bed of the ocean, and anterior to
the emergence from the ocean of any of the low hills with which
the country abounds.</p>
<p>The whole contour of the country favors the opinion that its
rate of elevation above the ocean level was extremely slow, and
was uniform over a very large area. The white color of this
sandstone rock alone is a sufficient proof that its deposition
must have preceded the elevation of any portion of this country
into the air; for the oxidation of the iron contained in the
ferruginous shales and schists, of which remnants still cover
some hills, and from which the red surface soils must have been
principally derived, must have commenced when they reached the
surface of the ocean; and the universal bedding of the red soils,
both in lake bottoms and on hill-sides, on the white sandstones,
shews clearly both the order of deposition and the change in the
physical conditions of the surface, which accompanied it.</p>
<p>Both Mr Robinson and F. Hall, of whom each possesses much
colonial experience and knowledge of the comparative value of
sheep-runs, concur in a high opinion of the value of the runs in
this valley, as due to the abundance of samphire.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 28.&mdash;Start at 9.30. a.m. At
about 2 miles from camp we cross a line of lakes extending from
the E.N.E., near its junction with what appears to be the main
line, trending from N. by W. Not being able to decide which is
the main line, we pursue a N.N.E. course between them, hoping to
intersect one or the other of them again in a few miles. We
continue this course up a gently ascending country until 2.30.
p.m., when we camp, with good feed for the horses and just
sufficient water for ourselves. Travelling distance 14 miles;
direct distance 13 miles N.N.E.</p>
<p>About 10 of the 14 miles traversed to-day have been through
mellow, red, loamy soil, with a thin plant of grass. The soil is
still boggy in places, and entirely without natural drainage The
timber is morrel and a small species of woorock, and a small
variety of dwoita, or York gum. Sandalwood, which attains a large
size and was very abundant as far as Smith's Station, declines
both in size and abundance eastward of that point and here is
both small and rare.</p>
<p>The tops of the hills are still capped with a ferruginous and
fine-grained schist, and a conglomerate apparently derived from
it.</p>
<p>We noticed, for the first time, a small green shrub attaining
a height of about 4 feet, made of one main stem with 4 parallel
rows of little branches radiating horizontally from it, and each
little branch similarly set with 4 parallel rows of little leaves
of which the planes were co-axial with the branches&mdash;a form
of foliation which was new to all our party.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 29.&mdash;The horses wandered much
in consequence of want of water last night, but all except 2 were
got in by 9 a.m., and being loaded by 10 a.m., started on in
charge of Edwards, Hall and myself; Robinson and Kowitch being
left to track up and bring on the other two, which they effected
in the forenoon. At about &nbsp;.30. p.m. very unexpectedly came
on a mass of several acres in extent of bare rock, projecting a
little above the soil, but with plenty of water in its cavities
and good grass around it.</p>
<p>The development of this intumescence of granite on the lower
part of the side of a hill, which has no exhibition of granite at
its summit, affords another proof of the extreme thinness of the
sedimentary; rocks which cover the granite; in fact, where we
camped last night no granite was exhibited at the surface, yet on
digging in clear and wet-looking patches of ground to get water,
of which our supply was short, we always found the massive rock
at a depth of 12 or 18 inches.</p>
<p>The granite here, and that observed for the last few days, is
constituted of remarkably large crystals, cemented by a red
paste. The crystals are nearly all parallelopipedons, and their
longest sides have dimensions of two or more inches. They have a
marked tendency to cleavage parallel to their longest sides.
Their color is a dull opaque white, and I take them to be
feldspar; to the gradual substitution of which mineral for quartz
in the granite I attribute entirely the progressive improvement
of soil which is to be observed as you travel to the east or
east-north-east from Smith's station.</p>
<p>In consequence of the bad feed and want of water suffered by
the horses last night, we camped at this hill. Direct distance
made, 7 miles N.N.E.</p>
<p>The view from the top of the hill adjacent to this rock is
dreary and monotonous in the extreme. Towards the east, at a
distance of about 10 miles, is a low wide and apparently flat
strip of land, which I suspect to contain another chain of lakes;
but at this distance, with the trifling elevation which we can
command, it is impossible to distinguish them. On the north of
us, and trending from W.S.W. to E.N.E., are several ranges of low
hills.</p>
<p>I should say that not not one of the hills or bare rocks seen
during the past week attains an elevation of 250 feet above the
floors of the lake of the adjacent lake chains.</p>
<p>I may here record my observation of the extra ordinary
deficiency of animal life which prevails through the country,
eastward of Smith's station, traversed so far by the expedition.
In a travelling distance of 155 miles, only 4 kangaroos and 3
emus have been seen by the whole party taken collectively. No
native has been seen, though on one day a fresh track of one was
seen, and on another a recently-expired camp fire of another was
seen, and their tracks of weeks or months' date have been
observed on two other occasions. Neither gnow nor turkey has been
seen, though the presence of the former bird in the country has
been indicated by freshly scratching of their old nests. On the
many lakes which we have passed up to the present 4 ducks only
have been seen. Neither cockatoo nor parrot has been seen for
some days.</p>
<p>This statement of facts may correct a misapprehension into
which I think the inhabitants of great cities have a tendency to
fall, namely, that uncultivated districts, in proportion as they
are destitute of human population, abound in animal life to a far
greater extent than either highly or partially cultivated
districts; whereas the truth is that the aggregate of animal
life, and more especially of the feathered tribes, increases with
every increase in the agricultural produce of a large district,
to the safe keeping and growing of which produce from innumerable
species of small vermin and insects, of which most possess
wonderful powers of multiplication, and appetites specially
directed to the consumption of particular descriptions of the
varied products of agricultural industry, each species of the
feathered tribes con tributes an invaluable and specific aid,
whilst it requires as wages of its indispensable services, a
portion which is equivalent only to a very small fraction of the
value of that which it has saved from ever impending destruction,
for the use of man.</p>
<p>The <i>rationale</i> of this great development of the smaller
fauna, and of all species of birds, except a few, perhaps, of the
larger ones, always following the introduction of cultivation
into any country heretofore in a state of nature, appears to be
as follows, namely, that, the total annual growth of vegetable
matter on a given surface, in a state of nature, is only a small
fraction of that which the same surface, even under the least
skilful agriculture, produces, annually, and probably is not
equal to one fiftieth part of that which the same surface, under
the action of skilful and capitalised agriculture, annually
yields, not directly and solely for the sustentation and service
of man, but to sustain, both in its growth and its decay, first
and principally God's "mighty hosts," the tribes in numerable of
both the microscopic and the visible entomological systems of
life; again by the bodies of these, and by parts of the increased
annual growth of vegetable matter not destined to be primarily
the food of the insect hosts, to sustain the smaller species of
the fauna and birds; and ultimately and principally with the
bodies of the latter to sustain the larger species of birds and
animals and man, the lord and chief of all.</p>
<p>Thus by the introduction of cultivation into a country
previously left to a state of nature the total number of
individuals of its fauna is always immensely increased, instead
of being diminished as most people in towns, I believe, without
reflection, assume.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 30.&mdash;Start at 9 a.m., and at
2 p.m. reach camping ground&mdash;again a hill-side, where an
intumescence of granite comes to the surface.</p>
<p>The feed for our horses here is very poor, not from defect of
grass, but from the dried and withered state of the grass, of
which each tuft is composed principally of the withered stalks
and leaves of two or three years' growth; and this remark is
applicable, in a greater or smaller degree, to the whole country
eastward of 118 d. E.; but later in the season, when the growth
of the current winter, which is now of small volume and very
watery quality, shall have acquired full growth, I am confident
that there will be splendid feed for horses at every hill at
which we have encamped, and as we have travelled straight through
the country, without a native guide, and not deviating from our
intended course to look for grass or water, I think it may safely
be predicated that in the spring and early summer this country
may safely be traversed in any direction, with little risk of
finding grass and water for every night's use: which is more than
can be said of most other extensive tracts in Australia.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 31, (<span class=
"aa">Sunday</span>.)&mdash;The bad feed at which we encamped last
night rendered it necessary to travel to-day, perhaps not so much
from an expectation of getting better feed by proceeding, at the
present season of the year, as from the fact that, upon this
withered innutritious grass, the horses can make short stages of
10 or 11 miles per day, every day of the week, more easily than
they can make longer journeys for a smaller number of the days of
the week. Moreover the ground now is firm and dry, but from its
constitution and almost level surface, I infer confidently that
it will become almost untraversible from saturation when the
winter's rains, which must now be close at hand, shall really
descend, so that I am unwilling to lose any time at present with
such a prospect of being constantly detained in camp, from
weather and bogginess of surface in a later part of this
journey.</p>
<p>Accordingly start at 8 a.m., and at 10 a.m. to our great
gratification, from the top of an extensive sand-plain, we
suddenly came in view of the chain of lakes, which we lost sight
of three days since, and at a distance of 6 or 8 miles on our
right, as I had expected to find them.</p>
<p>They are still trending very directly from or to E.N.E., and I
should infer, from the width and flatness of the valley in which
they lie, and from the levelness of the whole country, that this
chain must have a great extension in an E.N.E. direction, but
whether these lakes ever overflow from one to another, and thus
form a channel of drainage, and if so, whether that drainage be
from or towards the interior of the country, are points about
which I cannot satisfy myself at present.</p>
<p>In a careful examination of every lake which we have yet
traversed, I have not discovered any water-marks on trees in
their beds or margins which indicate that they have ever
contained water of one foot depth, nor have I discovered any
channels of communication between adjacent lakes, nor indications
of a general direction of current, if they ever do overflow.</p>
<p>At 11.40.a.m. reach camping ground. Travelling distance 11
miles; direct distance 10 miles E. by N.</p>
<p>In the afternoon read to the party the Church Service for this
Sunday.</p>
<br>

<h3>[VI. <span class="aa">Journal: June]</span></h3>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 1.&mdash;Start at 9 a.m., reach
camping ground at 3.15. p.m. Travelling distance 19 miles; direct
distance 16 miles N.E.</p>
<p>Our camp this evening, is fixed at another low, but rather
extensive bald rock, distant about 4 miles north-west from the
axis of the chain of lakes. It has plenty of water in the
cavities of its surface, and fair feed about its margin.</p>
<p>Of our track this day about 5 miles lay along the western
margin of the lake chain, and we crossed some minor chains of
lakes, which appear to run into the main chain on this north-west
side. Here the travelling was very heavy and fatiguing to the
horses, as they sunk in the soft deep sand above their
fetlocks.</p>
<p>In attempting to cross a lake-bottom of one of these minor
chains, which however did not show one particle of water on its
surface, 4 or 5 of the more heavily laden pack-horses were soon
bogged, and we obliged to retrace our steps and go round it. The
remainder of our track up to the camping ground was over a rather
hilly, poor, and thick country.</p>
<p>The chain of lakes on this northern and western side is
everywhere bordered by a margin of samphire plains, of an average
width perhaps of 1½ mile, and attaining an elevation of 9 or 10
feet above the present floors of the lakes, which strongly
suggests the idea that these lakes formerly were far more
extensive than they are at present.</p>
<p>In this part of the valley, I should say that a maximum depth
of 5 feet of water in the lakes would inundate the adjacent
country to a width of 5 miles.</p>
<p>Most of our horses are very tired this evening, and it is
plain that most of them are doing as much work as they can get
through without exhaustion.</p>
<p>The great difficulty which I now anticipate in the future
progress of the Expedition is the necessarily boggy nature of the
country, if and whenever any heavy rains fall. These lake-chains
will then probably be impassable, and I must take the alternative
of going to the north to get into a dry winter climate, or to the
south, to reach a hillier country, which I suspect backs the
shores of the Australian Bight.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 2.&mdash;Start at 9.45 a.m., and
at 1.30 p.m. reached another extensive but not elevated bald rock
on the side of a hill about 3 miles from the western margin of
the lakes. Here again we find plenty of withered grass and water.
Our horses are very tired, although we have travelled only 12
miles. Direct distance 11 miles, E.N.E.</p>
<p>The lake valley continues to trend N.E., carrying a wide
margin of samphire flats.</p>
<p>The bald hills are again increasing in number, though
diminished as to elevation and horizontal section, and now,
instead of projecting from the hill tops, as they do universally
further to the westward, they are more frequently found on the
sides of hills, and are generally so low as not to be visible
through the bush until they are very closely approached.</p>
<p>This bald hill, and in fact several which we have passed in
the last few days, is cut in many directions by dykes of a
coarse-grained feldspathic protogene, composed principally of
very large crystals of feldspar, of masses varying from 10 to 20
cubic inches, and of smaller crystals of talc; and on the flanks
of the hill are fragments of a talcose schist.</p>
<p>Of the 12 miles traversed to-day, at least 11 lay through a
splendid grassy country, superior as to soil to any land of the
York district, for either wheat or grass, albeit that grass at
this present be so withered as to afford little nourishment to
our horses; but we all agreed that when once the dead grass of
former summers shall be burnt or trodden to pieces by sheep, the
surface will soon be covered with a sward of grass surpassing
anything now to be seen in any other district of this colony.</p>
<p>On the southern and eastern side of this valley of lakes, the
bald rocks, or, more correctly speaking, the bare rock, still
shows itself at the summit of many of the hills, and possibly it
may be found that these rocks stretch to the vicinity of the
western shores of the Australian Bight, and will thus afford to
the future occupants of this country easy access to the
sea-side.</p>
<p>Kowitch and myself again to-day carefully examined several
lakes, and the banks which divide one from another, to ascertain
if possible the direction of the stream in cases of overflow, and
also whether an overflow of one into another ever does in fact
take place. The result was that we were satisfied that no
overflow has taken place for many years back probably not for
centuries past, and that the water for many winters past has
never attained a depth of 2 feet.</p>
<p>In fact I believe the valleys of these lakes to be as nearly
horizontal as possible; that they now have no ultimate outlets
into the ocean, but reticulate into each other, at points
innumerable over a vast portion of South-Western Central
Australia.</p>
<p>We have lately noticed a fine bushy species of Cyprus,
scattered in separate trees, over both hill-sides and the
alluvial bottoms, and contributing, with their light bright green
color, to give a very agreeable relief to the sombre monotony of
the dark green foliage of nearly all other species of the
indigenous arboretum, of this country; although its forest
scenery is far more picturesque and pleasing than of any other
district of this colony which I have ever visited, from the fact
of the trees growing much in clumps, and that the clumps of the
larger timber, such as morrel and woorock, are generally set in
an under-growth of a cedar, which, attaining a height of about 20
feet, conceals their butts, and gives an open and varied
appearance to the country.</p>
<p>We passed to-day, for the first time, several elegant small
trees of a species new to us all. These trees attain a height of
12 to 20 feet; have an erect stem, horizontal branches, and their
foliation would present an almost perfectly circular section in a
horizontal plane, and an almost perfectly conical section in
vertical and diaxial plane; the head bends over slightly to one
side, as if under the weight of the ovaries with which they are
now thickly covered: these ovaries grow on racemous stalks, in
bunches of 6 or 8; the leaf is oval, wide towards the lower part,
and of a light silvery color.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 3.&mdash;Started at 9.30 a.m. and
at 4 p.m. reached camping-ground where we had poor feed for our
horses and no water, except some which we had carried for
ourselves. Travelling distance 19 miles: direct distance 15
miles, NE by E. We passed no water at all, and our route lay
principally over poor rocky ground, at a distance of 4 or 5 miles
from the lake chain.</p>
<p>About 11 a.m. observing a native fire at a distance of about a
mile from our track, I despatched to it Messrs Robinson and
Edwards, and Kowitch, in order that we might get an interview
with some natives, if possible, and thereby get information which
might be of use to us, whilst Hall and myself proceeded on with
the horses. In about 2 hours the former overtook us again, having
failed to find the natives, who had deserted their camp before
our party reached it.</p>
<p>We are camped to-night by the side of an isolated dry lake in
a barren stiff clay soil.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 4.&mdash;As five of the horses
have strayed back along our track of yesterday during the night,
owing to the bad feed and want of water, I despatched Messrs.
Robinson and Edwards after them on two of our horses, and at 10
a.m., with the remainder, Kowitch and myself proceeded on, in
search of a better camping ground, leaving Hall to await the
return of Messrs. Robinson and Edwards, and guard the portion of
our stores left for the 5 absconding horses to bring on. After
travelling, generally through a scrubby and thicketty country,
until 4 p.m., we were, somewhat unexpectedly, gratified, by
coming on another very extensive bare rock, surrounded by an
extensive margin of grass; the rock, as usual, containing plenty
of water in the cavities of its surface. Travelling distance 18
miles; direct distance 14 miles N. E.</p>
<p>This day we noticed a flock of 10 black cockatoos; these being
the only birds of this species which have been seen during the
last 10 days.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 5.&mdash;Messrs. Robinson,
Edwards, and Hall, did not make their appearance until 11 a.m.
to-day, and then brought with them only 5 horses, having been
unable to find the other two, and having been without water,
about 30 hours themselves, and their horses about 50 hours. They
and their horses were of course much knocked up, and the task of
going back to find the two missing horses naturally devolved upon
myself and Kowitch.</p>
<p>Accordingly about noon we started back on our yesterday's
track, with 3 of the strayed horses, of which one carried three
days' provisions for us, as it appeared most probable that the
recovery of these horses would now occupy at least 3 days. We
rode pretty quickly back to our old camp, in order to have time
to make a preliminary search of the adjacent country before dark,
and as we reached it, to our great surprise and gratification, we
found the two horses quietly grazing within 100 yards of it,
having evidently returned from a distant and fruitless search for
water. As they were hobbled, we easily caught them.</p>
<p>As it was not yet 4 p.m., we resolved to return to the rest of
the party at the rock, preferring two hours' travel through the
bush in the dark to keeping the two recovered horses any longer
without water by camping here all night; accordingly after
stopping here half an hour to rest our horses and to refresh
ourselves with a smoke, to which bad practice I find that the
bush life of an explorer gives a peculiar proclivity, we start
again for our camp, which I observe that Kowitch always calls
"home," which we reach about 8 p.m., very tired, cold and hungry,
having ridden 36 miles since noon, of which the last 8 were at a
very slow walking place, as otherwise we should have been unable
to keep the track, the night being very dark, and the bush very
thick.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all our care, we lost one of the three horses,
which we drove loose, in one of the thickets, after dark, but we
found, on reaching the camp, that he had come on before us on the
track,&mdash;a fact of which we pretty well assured ourselves
before we gave up the search for him in the thicket.</p>
<p>This straying of a part of our horses, which thus finally
resulted in much less delay and trouble than I had anticipated, I
must frankly attribute to Mr Robinson's overtenderness for his
mare, Rose, whom I cannot persuade him to put hobbles on. The
singular care and tenderness with which most colonial-bred lads
regard their horses, as the chef d'&oelig;uvres of organic
creation, reminds one of the classical affection of the Bedouin
for his steed. I hope, however, that this unselfish and amiable
weakness of Mr Robinson will turn out to the advantage of the
Expedition, in enabling us to carry all our horses with us
throughout it, although 2 or 3 of them, which were in poor
condition when we started, are now showing many indications of
overwork.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 6.&mdash;There being plenty of
water and comparatively good feed here, we determined to rest the
horses here to-day.</p>
<p>This morning, in taking a survey of the surrounding country
from the top of this bald hill, we discovered, at about 2 miles
distance to the southward, another very large bald hill, of
probably nearly 100 acres of surface, and which from its low
elevation we had not seen yesterday, although we must have passed
within a mile or so of it.</p>
<p>I suspect that the opinion which, on general meteorological
principles, I have long formed, namely, that the climate of the
winter season in this inland part of South Western Australia is
comparatively dry, and that a large fraction of the annual
rainfall is delivered in summer thunder-storms, will be shown by
future experience to be correct, as the soil here now is nearly
as parched and dry as at midsummer in the York district, and
there is yet little appearance of a spring-growth in either the
grass or the shrubs.</p>
<p>If this theory be correct, the best season for exploring it
will be from September until January during which period it is
probable that the bald bills will hold plenty of water in the
cavities of their surfaces, and the grass around them will be in
a nutritious and palatable stage of growth.</p>
<p>At 8 a.m., Kowitch and myself start towards some hills distant
from camp about 6 miles south, in the hope of obtaining from them
a view either of the lake valley to the south, or of some more
bald hills to the east. In both respects we were disappointed, as
a higher range of bills intercepted our view to the south, and no
bald hills were, visible towards the east. Reached camp again
before noon, which enabled me to obtain a meridian altitude of
the sun, which showed our latitude to be 31 d. 12 m. S.</p>
<p>As I think it probable that the lake valley has now taken a
permanent bend to the southward, and as the exploration of the
country in the direction of Central Australia, rather than
towards the south coast, is of importance to the colony, I have
resolved to proceed a little to the north of east to-morrow, and
henceforth, so far as water and grass will permit; but as the
water on the bald hills is evidently drying up rather rapidly
under the influence of the bright cold weather which we have had
for some days, it is of course uncertain how far I may be able to
persevere in this direction.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 7.&mdash;At 9 a.m., Messrs.
Robinson, Edwards, and myself, proceed on with 14 horses, leaving
Hall and Kowitch to search for the horse Silver, which, in
consequence of its very low condition, I had directed yesterday
to be left unhobbled, and which had thereby been enabled to stray
during the night. At 4 p.m. halted at some poor feed, without
water for either ourselves or the horses, the very unpromising
appearance of the country ahead of us and the fatigue of the
horses, determining me to halt here without water, rather than
incur the risk of driving them through a thick bush in the dark,
and the certain inconvenience of unloading and camping in the
dark; no hills likely to afford water being visible, except at an
apparent distance of more than 10 or 12 miles.</p>
<p>The water-tins, being left with Hall, to be brought on by
Silver, (who, on account of his weakness, has carried these only,
and them generally empty, for the last fortnight) and not
expecting that Hall would overtake us this evening, and being
tired and hungry, with our 7 hours walking, we ate our supper
without tea to wash it down, and were preparing to go to turn
into our blankets, when at about 8 p.m., to our not small
delight, Hall and Kowitch made their appearance, without Silver,
but themselves bearing the water-tins, which enabled us soon to
get a pannikin of tea each, which we so much required and craved
for.</p>
<p>They had found Silver at some miles back on the track by which
we had approached the bald hill left this morning, had brought
him in, and started forward on our track by about noon; but at
about midway between our present camp and that of last night,
Silver had become so completely knocked up, that he lay down, and
would proceed no further, although relieved even of his
pack-saddle; Hall, therefore, abandoned him there, and knowing
that he was completely worn out; for present purposes, I did not
think it worth while to send back for him.</p>
<p>I think, however, that he will recover his strength and
ultimately work his way back to York.</p>
<p>The majority of the other horses are still looking well, but 2
or 3 more, which were received in a poor condition, I fear, will
knock up, although we give them all the favor possible, as far as
their loads are concerned.</p>
<p>Travelling distance 20 miles; direct distance 19 miles E.
Country travelled, generally poor, with much sand-plain and
thicket.</p>
<p>At 9 p.m. we were obliged to tie up all the horses, as they
were fast making their way back to last night's camp in search of
water, the grass being so dry and withered, that they would not
eat it without water.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 8.&mdash;At 7 a.m. started, and
at 1 mile towards the large hill observed yesterday to the
eastward, we unexpectedly come upon another low but very
extensive exhibition of bare rock, with plenty of water on it and
grass round it. Camp here, not only to rest and feed the horses,
which much require this relief after being tied up all night, but
from an erroneous reckoning that the day is Sunday, an error
which originated in the past week, and was not discovered and
corrected until we returned to Mr Smith's station.</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. read to the party the principal portion of the
Church Service for this Sunday morning.</p>
<p>I omitted to record yesterday that Kowitch shot a gnow, the
first yet killed by any member of the party, and which we ate for
dinner to-day, stewed with slices of pork, and found to be a very
agreeable change on the cold salt pork which, with exception of
one kangaroo and one emu, has been our sole meat since leaving Mr
Smith's station. As we are always on the look out for game, I
think this is a sufficient proof of the extraordinary destitution
of game in this part of Australia; but I hope, when the winter
rains set in, that we shall obtain plenty of ducks, and of their
eggs, in the lakes, which now are nearly all perfectly dry, but
to which I infer that ducks migrate to breed every winter, at
least I was informed by the natives about Mount Stirling
(Munlyeen) last year, that vast numbers of ducks breed in the
lakes of their neighbourhood every winter. I therefore promise
myself and party, who however dissent from my theoretical views
of the economy of nature in this respect, many feasts of ducks
and duck eggs before we finish our journey.</p>
<p>The whole face of this rock is marked with wavy, and
apparently vertical striae, sometimes, but not in all cases, of a
dark color, and radiating from many different centres in the
rock.</p>
<p>Neither myself nor any of the party have noticed this
phenomenon at any rock previously visited.</p>
<p>The Messrs. Dempster having recorded in the journal of the
expedition to the eastward of Northam which they made in the
winter of 1861, that they discovered a dark colored bituminous
liquid exuding from some of the bald hills which they saw, and
speculations as to the probability of this exudation springing
from carboniferous strata having been formed, it may serve to
dissipate erroneous hopes and expectations if I distinctly allege
the impossibility of the existence of carboniferous strata in the
country which we have traversed, and as this includes a portion
of that traversed by the Messrs. Dempster, and from their
description of the formation of the country traversed by them,
and my own observation of the contour of the country to the north
of our track, I infer the continuity of the geological structure
which obtains here to a great distance to the north of our route
and of their route, the solution proposed of the phenomenon by
them appears to me utterly inadmissible.</p>
<p>This exudation has not yet been observed by any of us; but as
we are travelling earlier in the winter season than they did, and
no heavy rains have yet fallen, we may yet hope to observe it
before the conclusion of our journey.</p>
<p>I may also state very positively that on or near the line
which we have traversed, not a particle of basalt, porphyry, or
other eruptive rock, has come to the surface, and that the
primitive granite contains no ruptures or fissures through which
any underlying matter ever could have reached the surface; and
that the (as I estimate) great fertility of a large portion of
the surface soil of this country is due solely to the larger
portion of feldspar contained in it.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 9.&mdash;Start at 7.30 a.m., and
at 11.30 a.m. reach some fine grass in the upper part of a narrow
valley running up into a range of hills. This grass being
unusually good, and there being strong indications of rain this
evening or night, we camp here. Direct distance 12 miles E. by N.
In our journey to-day we observed many indications of a change in
the character of the country; the hill-sides, in many cases,
being cut by gullies 4 or 5 feet deep&mdash;a depth of gully
which we have not noticed previously since leaving Smith's
station. At about 9 miles came into a deeply cut valley, which
terminated in a range of hills, trending from the northward, and
attaining an elevation of about 3 or 400 feet above the plain to
the southward.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I walked to the top of the highest hill in
the neighbourhood of the camp, and found that this range has a
width of 4 or 5 miles, and a broken surface, and that it appears
to be a projection of a higher flat land to the northward.</p>
<p>At an apparent distance of about 20 miles north-east, I
observed what appeared to be a very large hill, just showing
above the horizon, towards which I intend to travel
to-morrow.</p>
<p>We have passed no water to-day, nor is there any at our camp,
but we have brought with us in our tins (which unfortunately both
leak a good deal) a short allowance for our tea to-night and for
our breakfast to-morrow.</p>
<p>These hills are capped with a gneissose schist, which again is
covered with an argillaceous schist, containing a small
percentage of iron. I can discover no trace of eruptive rock
about them, but I think they have resulted from local fissuring,
attended with very slight elevation, and it is probable that a
careful examination of the edge of the very slightly elevated
table land to our north, of which these hills are simply a
projecting extension, may discover a line of fissure determining
the southern limit of that table land, and separating it from the
vast mass of unfissured primitive granite which we have
traversed.</p>
<p>Having observed some tracks of kangaroos about these hills,
being the first observed for the last 200 miles traversed, and
which we assume to have been formed by individuals of the red
species, known to exist in the interior to the northward, all the
party except myself took their guns in pursuit of them this
afternoon. However, no one succeeded in getting a sight of any
kangaroo.</p>
<p>We have observed many new species of trees and shrubs during
the past 3 days. I may enumerate, among these a bushy shrub, of
the family of Conacea, with short erect stem, attaining a height
of 4 or 5 feet&mdash;very long spines, and a cone much like that
of a Scotch fir: a small variety of salt-bush; a very short
stemmed but erect Eucalyptus, growing principally on hill-tops,
with a flower of a beautiful pink color, and hexagonal ovaries
very deeply grooved longitudinally on external surface.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 10.&mdash;Having made an
indifferent supper last night and breakfast this morning on the
scanty allowance of only ¾ pint of tea each, both our water tins
now leaking at such a rate that they will not retain to the end
of a day's march one quarter of the quantity of water which they
hold when filled, at 7.30 a.m. we start for the big hill observed
yesterday and bearing N.N.E. of us. At 0.30 p.m., after
travelling 15 miles, and at a direct distance of 14 miles N.N.E.,
we fortunately and unexpectingly found a native well in a hole of
a ferruginous conglomerate, which extends far down the side of a
low hill, and at the lower edge of which this water-hole
exists.</p>
<p>Our horses, having had no water last night, soon lowered the
water in this hole by more than one half its volume, the dryness
of the grass causing them to drink very largely and require it
frequently.</p>
<p>There is abundance of grass about this well, as in fact over
all the country traversed to-day, and Messrs. Robinson and Hall
express a very high opinion of its value for pastoral purposes,
to the disparagement of the land of bald hills, which we appear
to have left behind us. I however by no means assent to any
disparaging reflections on the latter, for I feel confident that
innumerable first-rate sheep thus will be found or formed in it,
and that a considerable portion of its surface, to wit, the wide
flat alluvial valleys which divide the bald hills from one
another, with artificial drainage, will be proved to possess a
very high degree of agricultural fertility.</p>
<p>In ruminating, as I walked on behind the pack-horses to-day,
on the origin of the bald hills and on their future uses in the
economy of South Western Central Australia, a conception of the
uses to which they would have been applied, if this country had
ever been colonised by a warlike feudal aristocracy, similar to
that of the middle ages in Western Europe, naturally crossed my
mind.</p>
<p>Then many a bald hill would have been the site of a
battlemented fortress, forming both the residence, the wealth,
and the power of a feudal baron; such as it would have delighted
the heart of Sir Walter Scott to paint in glowing words, and many
a smaller hill would have been surmounted by a small fortalice,
in which some family of the chief tenantry of the feudal lord
would have resided; but to my Utopian bent of mind, mental
pictures of the family mansions, replete with every luxury and
refinement of a wealthy and cultivated resident landed
aristocracy, each rising from the summit of one of the larger
bald hills, and of the smaller and less pretentious but still
substantial and comfortable residences of a wealthy yeomanry,
occupying the summits of many of the smaller bald hills, afford a
more pleasing subject of contemplation; and I am sanguine enough
to believe that many a little boy now living in the York
district, and whose apparent prospects are not very bright, will
in mature life be the proprietor of one of these mansions. In
fact, I confidently hold that, how much the best pastoral
districts of Victoria may surpass this district as to pastoral
capacities, the latter is vastly superior, as to both pastoral
and agricultural purposes, to any district of Western Australia
heretofore explored.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Mr Robinson and myself walked to the top of
the fine hill towards which we had I directed our course all day.
We found its distance from the well to be about 4½ miles N. by
E.; that it is an isolated hill rising to a height of about 600
feet above the plain which in fact surrounds it on every side.
The adjacent plain has a gentle slope up the flanks of the hill
to about 300 feet of its elevation, beyond which the hill is very
precipitous.</p>
<p>On the flanks of this hill some deep gullies have been
excavated by the surface drainage, exhibiting general sections of
the dull white sandstone which underlies the surface soils in the
whole country east ward of the Avon, but which in the latter
valley is overlaid by some 20 feet in thickness of estuary clays
and a fluviatile silt. This sandstone is evidently a pelagic
deposit which immediately followed the disruption of the granite
crust in the few lines in which rupture has been developed, as it
fills up its fissures conformably, and preceded the precipitation
from the waters of the ocean of the iron to which the present
general red color of the surface soils is due.</p>
<p>There is no appearance of tilting in the bedding of this hill,
which, as far as I can judge, is quite horizontal; but it has the
appearance of having been relatively raised, in the progressive
contraction of the earth's radius by being based on a small mass
of some material whose rate of contraction, cooling, is slow
relatively to that of the surrounding matter, and which mass must
lie not far below the surface.</p>
<p>The rock itself is primitive granite, covered with a small
thickness of gneiss and ironstone.</p>
<p>In the course of this day we have passed, on the tops of many
small rounded hills, much shale, which as to texture, lamination
and color, close approaches a rotten soft slate.</p>
<p>The country appears to have a very gentle slope from the
north.</p>
<p>In thinking over the names which might be pro posed for the
prominent natural features of this new country, I particularly
regret that we have not yet seen a single native, and therefore
that I am unable to ascertain their native names, which I think
good taste would desire to preserve in every possible case, both
from their philological value as remnants of a natural language,
which must soon disappear, and to prevent the tiresome repetition
of familiar English names of individuals or localities in the
Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 11.&mdash;At about 8 p.m.
yesterday, as we were rolling ourselves in our blankets for the
night, a warm gentle rain began to fall, and continued all night.
True, it soon wetted our blankets through, as we were
sleeping-without our tents, as in fine weather we frequently do,
but it seemed to break the charm of the continued dry cold
weather which we have experienced lately, and will enable a start
of young grass to spring up, and give us greater confidence of
finding water in our future wanderings. Up to yesterday the
surface has been as dry and parched, and the grass as withered,
as they are usually in the York district 2 months earlier in the
season. No doubt, when this country shall be closely fed with
sheep, and the old grass thus consumed or destroyed, the state of
the grass at this season of the year will generally be very
different from what it is now, as the experience on Mr Smith's
run strongly shows, but I am still strongly of the opinion which
I have already recorded in this journal, that the winters of this
country are comparatively dry, though not to the extent of
injuring the growth of grass and corn on cultivated land, all
through it, and that an uncommonly large fraction of the whole
annual rainfall is delivered in thunder storms during the
summer.</p>
<p>Started at 9.45 a.m.; travelled till 2 p.m., about 14 miles,
through one of the richest red colored alluvial flats that I have
seen in any country. Direct distance 13 miles N.E.</p>
<p>This plain is covered with 3 or 4 varieties of salt-bush, with
samphire, a long-jointed grass, still green, of which the horses
are very fond, and with much sweet grass intermixed with the
samphire. The long-jointed grass above mentioned I have no doubt
will be cultivated in future years, from its property in
retaining succulence all through the hot summer, and from the
evident relish with which the horses eat it.</p>
<p>Two species of samphire abound on this plain, of which one has
an erect stem, from which the branches proceed. The varieties of
salt-bush and samphire alone would form excellent pasture for any
sort of stock, but after the country shall have been closely fed
with sheep, I believe that it will soon be over spread with a
thick sward of sweet and nutritious grasses.</p>
<p>In fact, I have no hesitation in expressing my belief that few
finer sheep runs are to be found in Australia than the vast plain
which encircles the fine hill above described, and which, in my
inability to discover and record its native name, I propose to
call by the name of my old and highly-esteemed friend Mr S.
Burges, of Tipperary, near York.</p>
<p>This plain is cut by many shallow surface drains or gutters,
but towards its southern edge, where it runs into the wide lake
valley, of which the surface is some 20 or 30 feet lower than
that of the plain, a few of these gullies attain a depth of
nearly 20 feet, and show the thickness of the rich alluvial soil
there to be about 15 feet.</p>
<p>In traversing this plain, which is very thinly covered with
timber, we obtained many fine views of Mount Burges, rising
grandly and singly from the plain, which in fact completely
encloses it. I think that the elevation of its summit above the
plain, say at a distance of one mile from its base, can differ
but little from that of the summit of Mount Bakewell, above the
Avon, near its base; and from its isolated position in the centre
of a vast plain, which has a most gentle slope from the
northward, it has a much finer effect, as a feature of the
country, than Bakewell has; the latter, in fact, being only a
projection, into a narrow and rather deep valley, occupying an
ancient fissure of the earth's crust, of a slightly dislocated
mass of the original crust.</p>
<p>We are camping near a few gallons of water derived from last
night's rain, and stored in a depression of the clay.</p>
<p>One feature in the climatology of this country, which has
struck me much, is the very small amount of horizontal movement
of the atmosphere which takes place here at this season of the
year. During one only of the 30 days which have elapsed since
leaving Mr Smith's station, have we experienced even a wind of
moderate force. During a few days we have had a rather raw cold
atmosphere, but without sun or wind, but the air has been
generally mild and warm, the sky cloudy, with occasional
outbreaks of the sun, and such I suspect so be the usual winter
climate of this country. On the other hand, the fact that the
woorock, and other species of smooth-barked trees, are festooned
with long narrow streamers or ribbons of bark, suspended from the
topmost branches and sweeping the ground, and that the
paper-barked shrubs of the Casuarina family have their stems and
branches nearly stripped of their natural light thin integuments,
particularly on the north and north-east sides, shows plainly
that this absence of wind through the winter season is quite
compensated by an extraordinary intensity of land wind in the
summer.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 12&mdash;Start at 7.30 a.m., and
at 6.30 p.m. camp by the side of a small lake, on a clay-pan,
having water of about 2 inches maximum depth on it. Travelling
distance 14 miles; direct distance 12 miles east.</p>
<p>Our whole course to-day has been obliquely through a wide,
flat, covered, with lakes, or, more correctly speaking, with vast
shallow sand or clay-pans, which may be presumed to hold more or
less water in ordinary winters, but which at this present are
perfectly waterless, with exception of the one at which we are
encamped, and into which it would appear that a shower of a very
local character had just casually dropped.</p>
<p>This chain of lakes trends from N.E. to S.W., and appears to
have a more considerable descent than any lake-chain which we
have previously seen, as there are channels leading from one lake
to another, of which some are cut 4 or 5 feet deep, and in some
cases floods have cut cliffs, as much as 20 feet in height, out
of their alluvial banks and the stratum of soft white half
disintegrated fine-grained sandstone, on which the alluvial soil
is bedded. This shows that floods (of considerable volume and
velocity), must sometimes pour through this chain, at all events,
whatever may be the case of the other lake chains which we have
passed, and in which we could discover indications of neither
floods nor currents.</p>
<p>As far as I can judge, we passed to-day 3 parallel belts or
chains of lakes, lying close along-side of each other, in the
centre of this wide lake valley. In the belt, on the north-west
side, the subsoil, as above observed, is this fine-grained nearly
rotten sandstone, and the surface soil generally a light red
alluvium; but in the belt on the opposite or south side, the
surface soil is a stiff dark red clay, and the subsoil a
remarkably hard, very dark red-colored clay, containing small
round pebbles, of what rock I omitted to determine, but of the
hardness of the subsoil we had sufficient proof in the digging a
hole, about a foot deep, in the floor of the lake, that the water
might drain into it and settle, and that thereby we might have a
smaller proportion of clay in it than is unavoidably brought up
when the pannikin is dipped into water of about one inch
depth.</p>
<p>In ascending a channel leading from one lake to another, in
the northern belt, I noticed a dyke of quartz, which had
evidently cut through, and tilted to a distance not exceeding 25
or 30 feet on either side of it, a hard fine-grained sandstone or
schist, which underlies the soft rotten sandstone before
mentioned. This phenomenon, which I examined with much care and
attention, appears to throw some valuable light on the geology of
this part of Australia, namely,</p>
<p>1st. That the injection of this quartz-dyke was subsequent to
the deposition and induration of the hard schistose sandstone
tilted, and, as a necessary consequence,</p>
<p>2nd. That it was subsequent to the epoch of this portion of
the country assuming its actual contour.</p>
<p>3rd. That even in a position so favourable to the development
of its thickness, the thickness of the schistose sandstone is
very small otherwise the tilted portion would not have been
limited to a width of 30 feet from the dyke.</p>
<p>4th. It proves the prolongation of the period of the
occasional fissuring of the granite under a contractile force, to
a very late epoch in the progress of the geological development
of this country.</p>
<p>5th. That these fissures are not generally attended with any
change of the relative level of the two sides of the fissure.</p>
<p>In the vicinity of the lakes, on the western side, I observed
fragments of gypsum scattered over hundreds of acres of
surface.</p>
<p>The horses have been fed the whole afternoon, and evening on a
coarse bamboo or cane-like species of long-jointed grass,
perfectly new to all our party. It grows on the clay bottom of
the lake which contains the water.</p>
<p>As the horses ate it greedily, notwithstanding its present dry
and withered state, I infer that they would eat it still more
readily in a green state.</p>
<p>This grass attains a height of 4 or 5 feet, and throws up many
stalks from the same stem. The stalks are bent at each joint.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 13.&mdash;Start at 8.30 a.m., and
travel till 2 p.m., when, the horses showing strong signs of
fatigue and weakness, and having had plenty of water at the lake
last night, and discovering no indications of water ahead of us,
we camp on an open salt-bush plain, which moreover bears a large
quantity of the green long-jointed grass, frequently mentioned
before in this Journal, and of which the horses are very fond,
without water, but having sufficient water for a short allowance
of tea this evening and to morrow morning in our leaky
water-wins. Travelling distance 15 miles;&mdash;direct distance
14 E. by S.</p>
<p>The first 3 miles of our route to-day was over a dark red
stiff alluvial plain, sloping gently towards the lakes, and
apparently first-rate wheat land, Ascending gradually from this,
we reached a hilly country of a poor character, the rounded
hilltops being capped by a stratum of ironstone at the surface,
which is underlaid by a thin stratum of indurated shales, which
again lay on a gneiss of very fine grain and a bright lustre when
broken. Of this also I think the thickness is small.</p>
<p>The latter part of our route again lay through fine alluvial
plains, covered with many varieties of salt-bush, samphire and
grass.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 14.&mdash;A gentle rain lasting
nearly one hour, fell last night, which I hope was of much use to
our horses; still there is no appearance of such rain as would
enable us to proceed with confidence of finding water anywhere
but in the bald hills, which we have evidently left behind, all
the gullies on the steep side of Mount Burges being still as hard
and dry as they could have been in the summer, and I think it not
improbable that we shall be obliged to turn back, to the last
bald hill, which we left on the 10th instant, and wait there for
heavy rain.</p>
<p>Started at 8.45. a.m., and at 2 p.m., camped on a large open
plain, without water, but with excellent feed of salt-bush and
grass. Travelling distance 13 miles; direct distance 12 miles S.
E. Our horses being knocked up, and there not being the slightest
prospect of finding water by proceeding further over this vast
alluvial plain in an easterly direction, determined me to halt
here.</p>
<p>There are now and have been all day heavy vapor-laden clouds
all round the horizon, which elsewhere would be considered a
reliable indication of rain, but here we have frequently observed
them without being followed with rain. If fortunately we get a
heavy rain in the course of the next 24 hours, we shall be able
to proceed on our intended course to the eastward, but all our
horses are now showing evident signs of weakness and knocking up,
which I attribute in part to their having during the last 10 days
been without water for 3 single nights, but principally to the
innutritious state of the grass which they are compelled to eat.
As not one five-hundredth part of the surface of the country was
burnt last summer, and as the fauna of the country contains no
herbiverous species, such as the kangaroo, to crop the grass down
in every tuft of grass is the growth of 2 or 3 summers in which
of course the withered dusty accumulation of dried leaves and
stalks bears enormous ratio to the few little shoots of green
grass which are now making their appearance. To eat this sort of
food horses require frequent water. As far as the nutritiousness
of the natural pastures is concerned undoubtedly we are
traversing this country at the very worst season of the year.</p>
<p>The country traversed to-day has been a red stiff clay plain
with a gentle slope from some low ranges, covered with ironstone
conglomerate, and the plain in places is thickly sprinkled with
very minute black shining pebbles of this. The surface of the
plain generally is as hard and dry as if not a drop of rain had
fallen for 6 months.</p>
<p>This morning we abandoned a second horse, namely, Quiz,
furnished by Mr Hardy. He was not fit for this service, as to
condition, when we received him, and for many days he has been of
little use to us. I hope that both he and Silver will find their
way back to their respective owners near York, when they shall
have recovered their strength.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 15.&mdash;No rain having fallen
last night, and our horses consequently having been 72 hours, and
ourselves 24 hours, without water, and, which was in fact of more
serious import, being 6 days' journey from any water on which we
could rely, namely, from that at the last bald rock which we left
on the morning of the 9th, for we had left only a few gallons of
water in the hole of the ironstone near Mt. Burges, and the
shallow mud and water of the lake at which we camped on the night
of the 12th, would probably be dried op entirely before we could
get back to it, I resolve to return to the bald rock quitted on
the morning of the 10th, making, however, a digression to the
southward, in view of the possibility of finding shallow water in
some one or another of the lake beds, assuming that we should
intersect some of the lake chains in that direction.</p>
<p>With our actual inexperience as whether any heavy rain does
fall here in the winter months, and how soon it is likely to
fall; with a certainty that any water, which may now cover one in
ten or in twenty of the lake-bottoms to the depth of one or two
inches, will speedily sink into the ground or be evaporated,
unless rain falls; with every appearance of an indefinite
extension of this alluvial but now waterless soil to the east and
north-east; with our horses fast knocking up, already 48 hours
without water, and ourselves 24 hours without the same prime
necessary of life; with the only known reliable supply of water 5
days' journey behind us, it would have been rash in the extreme
to push on any farther in this direction.</p>
<p>Started at 9 a.m. Travelled 10 miles W. by N., then 3 miles W.
S. W. then 9 miles W. N. W., when we very unexpectedly find water
about 2 inches deep in a lake, with excellent feed about. Here of
course we camp, both ourselves and horses being much knocked
up.</p>
<p>This water is perfectly sweet, but surcharged with clay, of
which it leaves a thick sediment in every pannikin, and from this
fact, and from that of the lake at which we encamped on the 12th
instant being also perfectly sweet, and from having observed no
deposit of salt in any of the numberless dry lake-beds which we
have passed, I infer that sodium is not an element of the granite
of this country, and consequently that no apprehension of finding
salt water in sinking wells in this country need be
entertained.</p>
<p>Our travelling distance to-day is 22 miles; direct distance 19
miles W. by N.</p>
<p>Our first 12 miles were over a magnificent lightly timbered,
almost level plain, of an apparently rich stiff, dark red
alluvium, such as I should imagine would grow splendid crops of
wheat, and having just sufficient slope for purposes of
artificial drainage. The latter 9 miles were obliquely across
what I suspect to be a north-eastern branch of the great lake
valley, nearly the whole breadth of which may be said to be
occupied with lakes. These lakes are separated one from another
by low banks or terrace, of which the substructure is the
fine-grained rotten sandstone so frequently mentioned, and the
surface is a light alluvial soil of a dark red color, covered
with salt-bush, samphire, and grass. Many of the lake bot toms
now are covered samphire and grass, from which fact I infer that
they are being gradually filled up above the level of the winter
floods whilst perhaps other lines of them are being gradually
deepened so as to draw the floods into them.</p>
<p>Altogether I should think that few districts of Australia
contain more fattening sheep runs for summer feeding than this
valley does; in which opinion, all of us concur; and I may add
that I apprehend that the surface of this valley and that of the
numerous minor lake valleys which run into it from many
directions, will be found, on full exploration of this country,
to occupy a very large portion of its surface. Moreover the
extent of rich alluvial plains sloping gently into the lake
bottoms on either side is very great, so that this district
appears destined to become ultimately one of the richest
agricultural and pastoral districts of Australia.</p>
<p>We noticed much gypsum on the floors of many of the lakes
traversed to-day.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 16.&mdash;No rain or any prospect
of any, which would justify me in proceeding again into the heart
of the rich alluvial plains which surround us north, east, and
south; but there being a sufficiency of muddy water in the lake,
the feed round it being so good, and our horses being so much in
need of rest, I determine to recruit them here a couple of days
before I make back to our last bald-hill camp, from which, after
the horses are sufficiently recruited, to make a push towards the
south coast, as I think it very desirable if possible to
ascertain how far good land extends in that direction; as the
facility of stocking this country from the overstocked runs of
Victoria and South Australia must much depend on its facility of
access to the coast of the Australian Bight. Moreover I wish, if
practicable, to visit the elevated white cliffs laid down by
Flinders in, his survey of the shores of the Australian Bight,
and which are reported by Eyre to be composed of chalk, with
flints, as their constitution cannot fail to throw much light on
the geology of South Central Australia.</p>
<p>After our usual early breakfast, Mr Robinson and myself
examined first several small islands projecting out of the floor
of the lake, near its western margin, and afterwards climbed to
the top of a small round hill, projecting like a peninsula into
the lake valley on its north-west side, and attaining an
elevation of about 200 feet above the lakes. To this hill I
propose to attach the name of my indefatigable and estimable
friend and companion Mr Robinson. It bears from Mount Burges E½
S; distance 18 miles.</p>
<p>On the flanks of this hill a remarkably hard metamorphic
shale, which by exposure to weather acquires a vitreous polish,
crops out. This shale is composed of many wavy laminae of
different colors, and different degrees of induration; as if some
of the laminae were composed of matter of different
heat-conducting power from that of the others.</p>
<p>As to the islands within the margin of this lake, and many of
the small hillocks which form the western shore of the lake, the
fact that the shales which compose these are for the most part
set on their edges, and that these edges tend in all directions,
strongly suggests the idea that they must be ascribed to large
fragments of the shale-covered side of the fissure now filled by
the lake valley having toppled over into the chasm, and being not
yet buried in the alluvial soil of the valley. In fact, I suspect
that a careful examination of the geological structure of this
country will show that this wide lake valley, and perhaps a large
portion of the adjacent alluvial plains, occupy the site of a
vast fissure of the granitic crust, and that the northern and
western side of the fissured crust extends in an unbroken, or
very rarely broken, mass far into the interior of South Western
Central Australia, and certainly that none of the vast fragments
into which it may have been ruptured, have suffered any sensible
tilting or relative elevation.</p>
<p>In sitting by our camp fire of an evening to eat our generally
much-relished supper of damper, pork, and tea, and thereafter to
smoke our equally enjoy able and indispensable pipes, I hear from
my companions, all of whom possess much bush experience, much
knowledge both of the natives and of the indigenous fauna of this
colony, many stories of much interest bearing on these
subjects.</p>
<p>This evening, for instance, two similar and well authenticated
instances of the fallibility of the senses of wild animals, in a
matter as to which I suppose most persons would consider the
judgment of a wild animal absolutely infallible, were narrated,
and I think they are of sufficient interest to be recorded
briefly.</p>
<p>The first case was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Hall and some friends were travelling in the hush some years
ago, and were sitting round a very huge camp-fire one night after
supper, when three mountain-ducks flew down into the fire, which
they had evidently mistaken for water, and were so astonished on
discovering their error, that Hall and his friends caught 2 out
of the 3.</p>
<p>In the second instance, which was narrated by Kowitch and
corroborated by Mr Robinson, in whose neighbourhood the incident
had occurred, as a large party of natives were sitting round a
large camp-fire one night, about 6 years ago, near Beverley, 2
old swans and a brood of gannets dived down into the fire, and
all of them were caught by the natives, and given or sold by them
to a settler in the neighbour hood the next day. Both Robinson
and Kowitch knew most of the natives who were seated round the
fire at the time; and I may add that Kowitch, who is one of the
most intelligent and sensible natives that I ever knew, told me
that this was the only case of this sort that he ever heard of in
his life. I record these cases, as they may serve to correct the
some what exaggerated estimate generally I think entertained of
the infallibility of the senses of wild animals as to the
features of nature.</p>
<p>Hall also on a previous occasion mentioned two facts
illustrative of the habits and feelings of the aborigines of the
coast between Augusta and Albany, which appear to me very
interesting, the one physiologically and the other
physcologically.</p>
<p>The first of these facts is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>The district above defined has a poor gravelly soil covered
with mahogany forests. In this country kangaroos are very scarce,
the natives very poor, and compelled to toil hard for their food.
During the wet season their principal food is the kangaroo, which
they catch thus:&mdash;Three search the bush in company to find a
kangaroo. As soon as they sight one, the most skilful of the
three in the art of tracking follows the track of the kangaroo at
a quick run, the other two natives keeping abreast of him, and at
a distance of 20 or 30 yards from him, one on either side. The
office of these two is to pick up the track at once if the native
in the centre should accidently lose it. They run along the track
at the rate of about 6 miles per hour; whenever they approach the
kangaroo, they shout and drive it on again; they continue the
chase until dark; the next morning they take up the track again,
and follow it up in the same way all day; on the third morning
they return to the chase of the same animal again, which is
always caught by simple exhaustion, during the afternoon of the
third day; Hall assuring me that he had never known an instance
of the kangaroo being killed much before the middle of the third
day, or of its surviving the evening of that day; thereby
illustrating the very important and suggestive truths that the
muscular powers and constitutional strength both of wild animals
and of man in a state of nature, when tested to the death; are
almost uniform throughout each species, and that the wild man
possesses these bodily powers in a measure equal or superior to
that of most wild animals.</p>
<p>The second fact narrated by Hall is of much psychological
interest, and very discordant with our narrow and depreciatory
conceptions of the moral nature of man in the lowest possible
stage of social progress.</p>
<p>In the district above defined, during the summer season of the
year, the natives are forced, by the dearth of all other food, to
live principally on a tuber, called by them mena; of which 4 or 5
grow to one plant.</p>
<p>These tubers are eaten in a roasted state, and have the
following remarkable, and possible valuable qualities:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. They are so laxative in their action on the bowels, that
the natives guard against this effect by eating with them a white
unctuous pipe-clay which is found in many districts of the
colony.</p>
<p>2ndly. These tubers dye the tongue, palate, lips, gums, and
interior surface of cheeks with a bright purple color, which is
so permanent that, in the case of a 'native of this district who
followed Hall from it to the Canning district and remained in his
service in the latter district 3 years, and consequently during
that time never tasted this root, the dye was not perceptibly
faded at the expiration of that time.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Note</span>.&mdash;This dye does not affect
the colour of the teeth.</p>
<p>Now the country above defined is esteemed by all the
neighbouring tribes to be so poor, that to belong to, or reside
in it, is held as a proof of abject and contemptible poverty, for
who would eat clay for a large part of each year; or get his meat
for the remainder of the year, by the toilsome and almost animal
expedient of hunting down the kangaroo by a continuous chase of 3
days, when in all the surrounding country the kangaroo can be
speared in unlimited quantity at one season of the year, and the
vegetable world supplies abundance of wholesome and palatable
food for the remainder, unless he were wanting in courage or in
enterprize; in other words, were a coward or a fool.</p>
<p>Such reasoning expresses the feeling of the wealthier tribes
around, far in the simple and change less forms of Society and
culture which Nature has impressed on man in Australia, the scorn
of there happier and more fortunate fellows which poverty, ever
so bravely and honestly borne, so often incurs, no less than in
the higher forms of civilization which Christianity, science, and
wealth have developed elsewhere, inflicts a keener pain than the
physical privations and muscular toil which merely constitute the
bodily substance and form of poverty.</p>
<p>The mena-eater knows well the contempt with which the
neighbouring tribes regard him. His purple dyed tongue and lips
will, he knows, proclaim to all strangers at every korrobbery
that he belongs to a degraded race. The first word he utters will
disclose his humble rank and status in Society, and perhaps draw
down on him a storm of derision and contempt. He therefore keeps
his mouth shut, and assumes that position and demeanour in the
presence of his wealthier fellows, whether at a great public
festival or at an accidental meeting, which befits his humble and
penurious condition of life. Yet does he love the barren
ironstone-forest-clad hills of his native land, despied by all
others, and ungenerous to him, as he knows them to be, and great
indeed must be the motive which will draw him from them, or, if
away, prevent his speedy return.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 17.&mdash;Started at 9 a.m., and
travelled till past 6 p.m., when darkness compelled us to camp,
without water, but in good feed, about 6 miles short of the well
at Mount Burges. Travelling distance 24 miles; direct distance 22
miles W. by S.</p>
<p>The horses travelled to-day better than I had expected, having
been much recruited by their day's rest at the lake, where the
grass growing between the samphire was unusually green.</p>
<p>Of our course to-day, 5 or 6 miles were over low ranges,
covered with metamorphic shales in angular fragments; about 6
miles over fine alluvial plains of a rich dark red stiff soil;
the remainder was through two lake valleys, both trending to the
south-west, and probably uniting at a few miles to the south of
our track.</p>
<p>The country is still as dry, and the grass as withered, as I
have ever seen it in the month of March in the Avon Valley, and
to-day it was very unpleasant to walk behind the horses, from the
dust blowing in our faces.</p>
<p>Again we had no water for tea to-night, as both from expecting
to reach the well, and also on account of the extreme muddiness
of the water of the lake, I had ordered none to be brought on
with us this morning. Of course we shall have none until we get
to the well to-morrow.</p>
<p>Hall has been very poorly all this afternoon, complaining of
his liver, the bad state of which he attributes to the muddy
water of the hike. Neither Edwards nor myself feel well, I think
from the cause to which Hall attributes his sickness, and we all
feel the privation of water to-night far more than on any former
occasion.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 18.&mdash;Started at 8.45 a.m.,
of course without breakfast, as we are too thirsty to eat without
drink, and about noon reach the well, to our not small relief.
Direct distance 7 miles W. by S.</p>
<p>We found that the water in the well had somewhat shrunk since
we left it on the 11th instant, and we could afford our horses
only 1½ gallons of water each, as we are obliged to carry on
water for our use to-morrow, as it will not be possible to reach
the bald rock, our camp of the 9th instant, to which we arc
falling back under two days, and we know that there is no water
on our track between these points.</p>
<p>To search for water now in the few shallow gullies which exist
is perfectly useless, and my only courses until heavy rain shall
come, is to halt the party at the nearest large bald hill, to
recruit our horses, which are much knocked up, and to wait for
rain; whilst Kowitch and myself endeavour to find a better
watered country to the southward. Towards the eastward and
northward, in which directions the alluvial plains seem to extend
indefinitely, I have no hope of finding water until after very
heavy rain.</p>
<p>This design I had hoped to be able to carry out at and from
the well, as I had entertained a doubtful faith that this well
was fed by a hind drainage, and would be found full on our return
to it; a faith which it will have been seen that our experience
falsified and which therefore I postponed until we should regain
our last bald rock.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 19.&mdash;Although we deepened
the well, by clearing mud, &amp;c., out of its bottom, by about 2
feet last evening, in a feeble hope that water might drain into
it in the night, this morning we did not find more than 2 gallons
of water in it. Our horses, instead of feeding, had been
collected round the well all night, smelling the damp ground, and
trying to reach the little surface of water, which, being more
than 4 feet below the rocky edge of the well, they could not
effect, and consequently they looked miserable indeed this
morning. However at this present moment, 8 a.m., the sky is
overcast with clouds, and if we had not so often been mistaken in
our forecasts of rain from similar dark clouds, I should
confidently reckon that it will fall by noon to-day, and should
remain here to recruit our horses and examine the country north
and south, instead of returning farther west before doing so.</p>
<p>Started at 8.30 a.m., and 2 p.m. reach our camp of the 9th
instant. Direct distance 14 miles S. by W.</p>
<p>A little before noon a steady soaking rain began to descend,
which, although it drenched us well before we reached our
camping-ground, we all hailed with no little pleasure for the
sake of our horses, and the facility of our future movements.
Indeed if rain had not come to-day, I anticipate that we should
have left some of our horses bones at this camp&mdash;a
consummation not to be wondered at, if it be remembered that in
the last 11 days of constant hard travelling, with only one day's
rest, they have once been 4 days and 3 nights without water, and
on three other occasions have been upwards of 30 hours without
the same prime necessary, and that at a season of the year at
which I think the grass, under existing circumstances, is
altogether more withered, dusty, and innutritious, than at any
other season.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 20.&mdash;Start at 9 a.m., and at
1.30 p.m. reach the bald rocks at which we had encamped on the
evening of the 8th instant. Direct distance 12 miles, W. by
S.</p>
<p>About half our route was over ranges of small rounded hills,
capped with metamorphic schists; the remainder was over alluvial
plains and slopes, of apparently rich soil, now covered
principally with salt-bush and a little withered grass in
scattered tufts.</p>
<p>This has been a fine bright day, with no promise of further
rain at hand, and I observe that the strong rain which gave as
such a drenching yesterday has not left a spoonful of surface
water in any of the alluvial plains we have traversed to-day.</p>
<p>The appearance of the withered grass throughout this district,
and the backward state of vegetation, as indicated by the shrubs
and grasses of the country, combined with the appearance of the
sky and the lightness of the very few showers, (except that of
yesterday) which we have experienced, they being in fact rather
mists than, rainfalls, strongly impress on me, an opinion,</p>
<p>1st. That the total annual rainfall here bears a very small
ratio to that of the western slope of the Darling Range, the
actual quantities being probably about 25 and 40 inches
respectively.</p>
<p>2ndly. That of the annual rainfall an unusually large fraction
is delivered in the summer season, when it descends in violent
rain storms, accompanied with much thunder.</p>
<p>3rdly. That the prevailing characteristic of the winter season
here is a cloudy state of sky, with occasional misty showers of
ram, and very little wind.</p>
<p>If it be remembered that the mean annual rainfall at the town
of Bedford, near the centre of England, and in a relatively low
position, is less than one seventh of that received at
Braithwaite, in Cumberland, on very high land close to the
western coast, and is only about one quarter of that received
generally on high hind near the western shores of the United
Kingdom, and yet that the same species of plants constitute the
staple products of agriculture under these very different
hygrometric conditions; again if the remarks of Darwin on the
comparative effects of given quantities of rain in the dry
interior provinces of northern Chili, and in the humid maritime
districts of the southern provinces of the same country, be duly
considered, no apprehension that the small annual rainfall which
I ascribe to this district will prove insufficient to the
purposes of a highly productive agricultural system in future,
and to the wants of countless herds of sheep and cattle in the
present, will be entertained.</p>
<p>As was to be expected, our horses, after there recent long and
frequent privations of water, on arriving near the rock, rushed
to the water holes in an almost frantic way, and gorged
themselves with their contents to a degree more easily conceived
than described.</p>
<p>I was so ill to-day, I believe from the constipating effect of
the clay-saturated water which we were compelled to drink at the
lake, that I could not keep up with the party, and did not arrive
at camping ground until long after they had got in. Hall and
Edwards also have been very poorly for the last two days from the
same cause.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 21.&mdash;All hands employed in
repairing bags and other gear, and in taking account of and
repacking the stores, &amp;c.</p>
<p>It is absolutely necessary to rest here 4 or 5 days to recruit
our horses, after their severe privations and hard work, and even
then, unless heavy rain fall in the mean time, I apprehend that I
must fall back still farther west, as, from the alluvial
character of the country north-east, and south of our present
position, and the absence apparently of bald rocks in these
directions, I cannot expect at present to find water in either of
these directions.</p>
<p>Our total travelling distance from Comining (Mr Smith's
station) is now 546 miles, and as I think that the following
facts will be valuable as records of the distribution of animal
life, and of the aborigines, in this part of the interior of
Australia, prior to the advent of colonists, and may serve to
correct many erroneous conceptions on this subject generally
entertained, I will here record certain facts illustrative of the
subject.</p>
<p>Since leaving Comining on the 11th ultimo, 2 kangaroos and 3
emus only have been seen by all members of the party
collectively. Of these, 1 kangaroo and 1 emu have been shot.
During the same time 1 gnow has been shot, 5 have been seen, and
about 20 gnows' nests.</p>
<p>On the lakes which have contained water, about 30 ducks in all
have been seen, of which none have been shot, although several
attempts to get near them have been made, and at least three of
our party are good shots, but they are as wild as if they had
been fired at daily.</p>
<p>Not one native has yet been seen. Their fires have been seen
on 4 occasions, and their tracks, but generally of many weeks' or
months' date, on 10 or 12 occasions. During the last two days we
have travelled along our old track made 10 days since, but no
native has crossed or followed our track in that time.</p>
<p>All these facts I think indicate a scantiness of life, both,
human and of the larger species of animals, in the interior of
Australia, even where the soil is of great natural fertility,
which throws a valuable light on the distribution of animal life,
prior to the advent of civilized man and of cultivation, in other
countries of similar climatological conditions, for, as I believe
that a great part of the country traversed by the expedition is
endowed with the highest agricultural fertility, the
extraordinary poverty of its larger fauna as to the number of
individuals, must be ascribed solely to climatological
conditions.</p>
<p>In the evening read to the party the Church Service for the
day.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 22.&mdash;This morning Kowitch
and myself, taking 2 riding horses, 1 pack-horse, and 4 days'
rations proceeded towards the southward, to ascertain if bald
hills extended in that direction, and consequently if we could
move our camp that way. We travelled nearly south all day, and
camped at a fine bald hill in the evening. Direct distance 18
miles S.S.W. Country traversed, about one-half good alluvial, the
remainder poor alluvials and sand-plains.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 23.&mdash;Our course to-day has
been principally over clay forest lands and sand-plains. Direct
distance made 20 miles S.S.E. Camp in the evening at some low
bare rocks, with good feed about and plenty of water.</p>
<p>We passed to-day many exhibitions of bare rock, evidently
intumescencies and not dislocated fragments, of the massive
granite crust, in low positions, each as the lower part of hill
sides, or in the valley flats; and in fact have done so on former
occasions which I have not recorded; but I record the fact here,
as an evidence both of the thinness of the sedimentary rocks and
soils with which the granite is covered throughout this country,
and of its necessary corollary, that the slope and form of the
undulation of the granite approximately conform to those of the
actual surface soils&mdash;a fact of some importance in the
physical theory of our planet, and nowhere else perhaps so
extensively and plainly exhibited as in this district;
nevertheless, even here the question how many of the lake valleys
occupy fissures, and how many occupy only depressions or
undulations, which the granite assumed in its primeval
consolidation by cooling, is not of such easy determination; but
I think it may safely be affirmed that the great lake chain
occupies a line of fissures, and that many of the smaller chains
and rich alluvial valleys occupy not lines of fissure, but simply
depressions of the granite crust.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 24.&mdash;Having now ascertained
the extension of bald bills, water, and of a more or less good
country and grass for more than 30 miles due south of the rock at
which I left the remainder of the party, I thought it expedient
not to extend our excursion any farther, as it would probably
necessitate a farther detention of the whole party at the rock,
to recruit the 3 horses which we had taken with us, after our
return to it; this morning, therefore, I resolved to make a
straight course back to the rock, which we reached, after a long
ride, about dark this evening.</p>
<p>Our return route lay altogether to the eastward of our outward
route, and traversed a continuous alluvial plain of a rich mellow
appearance, thinly covered with a short stunted species of
woorock and bushes; with a considerable quantity of salt-bush,
but little grass. The deficiency of grass in this case, as in
other extensive tracts of apparently rich land which have been
traversed by the expedition, I attribute entirely to two causes,
namely,&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. The saturation of the soil during a portion of the rainy
season, resulting from the deficiency of natural drainage.</p>
<p>2ndly. The absence of a grass-eating indigenous fauna.</p>
<p>In fact few countries which I have ever visited appear to me
to disiderate systematic artificial drainage so much as this
fertile district does; and I fear that until artificial drainage
be systematically applied, only a small fraction of its potential
fertility will be available for the purposes of agricultural
industry and commerce.</p>
<p>How far close feeding by sheep and horses will extend the area
of the natural grasses, or rather of some few valuable species of
them, and develop a thick growth of them, experience will prove.
For my part, I anticipate a considerable improvement by these
means.</p>
<p>We found the party all right on our reaching the camp, and
that Messrs. Robinson and Edwards had, agreeably to my request
before leaving them, devoted the 23rd and 24th inst., to making
an excursion to the northward for the purpose of ascertaining if
water was to be found in that direction. They reported that they
had made a distance of about 20 miles N. by W. principally over a
good alluvial soil covered with salt-bush and grass, that they
had found neither bald hills nor water, except less than one
pannikin-full of very muddy water, which they had got out of a
hole on the surface of the clay, which was all they had between
them for tea and breakfast the next morning; that the country to
the north, when they turned back, appeared more broken and hilly
than what they had traversed, and also to rise slightly from the
southward.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 25 and 26.&mdash;The 5 horses
which our two detached parties had taken with them, and which
were of course the strongest of required to rest these two days
to recover the effects of their extra work.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 27.&mdash;I am convinced that it
would be very dangerous, in the present state of our horses, to
attempt again to penetrate to the eastward or north ward of this
rock until the fall of such heavy rain as would certainly leave
surface water on the alluvial soils in those directions, and as
weeks or mouths may elapse before such rain will fall, I have
determined therefore to proceed towards the south coast, in which
direction I think it more likely to find water at this season of
the year than to the northward, and I consider it it very
desirable that the character of the belt of country, about 150
miles in width, intervening between this granite district and the
coast should be ascertained, as the profitable occupation of the
country in which we now are for pastoral purposes must depend on
its facility of access to the shores of the Australian Bight, its
distance from the western coast being too great to admit of its
profitable occupation, under a system of the land transport of
its imports and exports, from and to the latter. Accordingly at
10.30. a.m. we started on a direct course towards the nearest
point of the coast, and travelled until 1.30 p.m., when Hall
being suddenly taken very ill with a dizziness or swimming in the
head, which compelled him to lie down, being unable for a time
even to stand upright, I was compelled to halt at a bald hill
which fortunately happened to be near at hand when this occurred,
and at which, as usual, we found plenty of grass and water.
Direct distance 9 miles S.E.</p>
<p>Our route was generally through a good alluvia soil, but
intermixed occasionally with patches of sand-plain and
thicket.</p>
<p>After dinner, Kowitch having observed from the top of the bald
hill a native fire at a distance of about a mile, being desirous
to get an interview with the natives, with a view to obtain
information as to the country, and possibly to obtain the
services of one of them as a guide, we all, except Hall, whom we
left in charge of the camp, proceeded, well armed, in the
direction of the fire, towards which we approached as stealthily
as possible, to prevent the very possible contingency of the
natives discovering our approach before we should see them, and
bolting from us.</p>
<p>To our disappointment, we found that the fire had been kindled
only by one native woman, who, with her little boy, an infant of
less than 5 years of age, whom she carried on her shoulder, was
digging roots, her husband being at the time away opossum
hunting, as far as we could make out from her signs and
shouts.</p>
<p>The poor woman, of course, was dreadfully frightened at the
sudden apparition of such monsters she evidently took us to be,
and she immediately attempted to escape from us into a thicket,
carrying her little boy on her shoulder, both herself and child
being perfectly naked. However, being very anxious to have a
parley with her, and if possible to get her husband to come to
our tents, with difficulty we got her out of the thicket, and by
means of signs, by occasionally pushing and pulling her by the
arm, whilst Kowitch walked before her, and poured on her an
incessant but I believe perfectly unintelligible harangue,
setting forth our benevolent intentions, we at length got her as
far as our camp fire, by the side of which she immediately
squatted down, and remained a very frightened and involuntary
guest for about an hour.</p>
<p>Here she seemed gradually to recover her self-possession, and
talked very urgently to Kowitch, though little to his
edification, as he was able to understand nothing of what she
intended to express.</p>
<p>We tried in vain many times to make her taste our bread, tea,
sugar, and meat, but she would neither taste them herself nor
allow her child to do so, and when at last we allowed her to go
back to her fire, making her take these things in her hand, as
soon as she got about 100 yards from the hut she flung them all
away.</p>
<p>I think she was even more frightened at the sight of our
horses, near which unintentionally we passed in bringing her to
the tent, than at ourselves, as she shuddered in the most evident
manner when she suddenly saw the first of them within a few
yards, rushing away from it into a thicket, and telling Kowitch
in the most vehement manner that she could not go near such a big
monster.</p>
<p>Our object in compelling her to come to our tents was a hope
that, if we would conciliate her with food, she might bring her
husband to us, and that Kowitch might succeed in getting from him
some information as to the country between this and the coast
which might prove of use to us.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 28.&mdash;Started at 9.30. a.m.,
and at 0.15 p.m. camped at another large bald hill. Direct
distance 8 miles S.E. Country travelled, partly alluvial plains,
partly sand-plains, and thickets.</p>
<p>Although we have travelled to-day only about 9½ miles, yet,
for two hours after our arrival here, some of the horses began to
feed, all preferring to rest; another proof of the weak condition
to which the innutritious withered state of the grass at this
season of the year has reduced them all. In there present state
of condition we shall not be able to travel more than 3 hours per
day, but I hope that, when we get near the south coast, we shall
find the spring of the grass much further advanced and that our
horses will then somewhat recover their lost strength.</p>
<p>In consequence of the 7 days rest which the horses have so
lately had, and of the shortness of the two days' journeys which
they have since made, I thought it necessary to make a short
journey this morning. Accordingly we started at 8.45 a.m. and at
11 a.m., reached a very extensive bald hill, at which we
encamped. Direct distance 7 miles S. E.</p>
<p>Our route lay through thickets and sand-plains for about three
miles, the remainder of it being through light alluvial land on
which however, there is little or no grass.</p>
<p>From the top of this bald hill an extensive view of the
surrounding country can be obtained, showing many bare rocks to
the north and north-west, and a hilly rising country in that
direction, as well as towards the east. From, south-east to
south-west the country is flat and low. No lakes can be seen.
From the top of this hill, but I doubt not that they must lie in
the low country to the southward.</p>
<p><span class="aa">June</span> 30.&mdash;In consequence of the
weak state of the horses, and of the dryness of the country, for
still no drop of water can be found except in cavities on the
surface of the bare rocks, I do not think it prudent to leave the
country in which these are exhibited, and consequently have
altered our course to-day to south by west, in which direction I
expect to shift along their southern margin. Started at 9.20
a.m., and at 2.20 p.m. stopped at another rather extensive
exhibition of bare rock, on a hill side, where we found plenty of
water but very poor feed for the horses, which are nearly knocked
up by their five hours' work. Direct distance 15 miles S. by W.
Country traversed, about 2 miles thicket, 4 or 5 miles
sand-plain, the remainder alluvial soil, generally of a light
texture.</p>
<br>
<a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>
<h3>[VII. <span class="aa">Journal: July]</span></h3>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 1.&mdash;The horses are now so
weak, owing to the withered state of the grass, that I think it
would not be prudent either to make the south coast, or to
attempt to return by a more northern route than our outward
journey, as, in the latter case, we shall, still run much risk of
being without water; I have therefore again altered our course,
and now intend to steer south-west for some days, assuming that
we shall still be within the limits of the bare rock district,
and afterwards to adopt a still more westerly route until we
reach, the limits of the settled country.</p>
<p>No winter climate can be conceived more delightful than the
weather which we have experienced since leaving Tampin; since
which we have only once had a rain which could wet a person
through, either by day or by night; but have had generally warm
cloudy weather, with occasional outbursts of sun shine, and
sometimes, but rarely two or three days of bright sunshine, with
frosty nights.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the very small quantity of rain which has
actually fallen hitherto this winter, I believe any grain crop
would have grown well throughout it, on deeply ploughed land, for
I think that the atmospheric moisture would quite suffice, to
keep any of the cerealia in in a state of vigorous growth on
well-ploughed land, which had been once saturated with a day's
rain, and that the warmth and moisture of the atmosphere, and the
limited quantity of sunshine, would keep any young corn in a
state of vigorous growth.</p>
<p>It still remains to be proved by experience whether this be an
exceptionally dry winter for this district, or merely an average
one; the remainder of the annual rainfall which, on theoretical
grounds, may be anticipated to be very small for the latitude,
being received in violent thunder-storms during the summer.</p>
<p>I am inclined to believe that the latter is the more probable
hypothesis, but nevertheless I do not doubt, that the winter
rainfall, coupled with the general warmth and humidity of the
atmosphere, will be found sufficient for the most successful
cultivation of the cerealia.</p>
<p>As two of the horse's strayed away during the night several
miles on. our track, we did not start until noon; and at 4 p.m.
we camped at another extensive rock, with plenty of water and
grass such as it is. Direct distance 12 miles south-west.</p>
<p>We passed many bare rocks to-day, principally on the north
side of our track, and from the tops of the higher ones we
obtained extensive views of the low flat country to the south and
south-west of us, in which I have no doubt that the chain of
lakes lies. About one-half our route was through alluvial plains,
the remainder was over rocky ground, in the vicinities of the
exposed rocks, and through sand-plains, which generally showed a
good sprinkling of small rounded pebbles of ironstone on their
surface.</p>
<p>My mare Beauty knocked up to-day, and had to be left about 2
miles short of our camping ground. I shall send back for her
to-morrow morning, but I fear that she will he of little service
to us during the remainder of our journey.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 2.&mdash;Again altered our course
to W. S. W., in order both to keep within the margin of the bare
rocks, where alone water is to be found, and to make our way back
to the settled districts as directly as possible, all the horses
being now so weak that I cannot reckon on doing more than 7 or 8
miles per day, at which rate we shall run our provisions very
short before we get in, and apparently we have no prospect of
eking them out with game until we get nearer the settled
districts. Direct distance 14 miles W. S. W.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 3.&mdash;Started at 9 a.m. and at
1.30 p.m. camped at another extensive bare rock with plenty of
water on it, and with the usual complement of withered grass and
rushes around it. Direct distance 11 miles W. S. W.</p>
<p>The horses travelled very badly to-day. Beauty again knocked
up, although carrying only my riding saddle, and after pulling
and driving her with the greatest difficulty for the last hour of
the journey, we were obliged to unsaddle and leave her about one
quarter of a mile short of the camp, from which distance she was
got in late in the afternoon. Three of the other horses also were
driven through with difficulty, being quite knocked up when they
got in. Traversed a good deal of thicket intermixed with alluvial
plains.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 4.&mdash;In consequence of the
horses being so weak, I resolved to rest here all day, which I
hope will somewhat recruit them; also to throw away all the
oilskin covers foe the packs, which so far, from the absence of
rain, have been of little service to us, and judging from the
settled appearance of the sky, I think it not likely that we
shall much require them during our return journey. In fact
Robinson, Edwards, and Hall, all confidently think that the rainy
season in this district is passed, and certainly the weather is
more like that of October or November in the York district than
that of July. More agreeable winter weather could hardly be
conceived. Future experience will show whether this is an
exceptional winter for this country, or, being an average one, at
what season of the year the principal rain-fall usually takes
place.</p>
<p>This agreeable weather, combined with the weak state of our
horses, which compels us to limit our travelling to 3 or 4 miles
per day (in which however all, except one, walk the whole
distance) renders our journey, as far as fatigue and hardship to
ourselves are concerned, very easy work, and as we have not yet
consumed more than half of our rations, and being now on our
direct course to York, which, making a liberal allowance for the
weakness of our horses, I hope to reach in five weeks, we still
enjoy a full supply of provisions.</p>
<p>We still are unable to procure any game whatever, although
constantly on the look out for it. From the top of this rock, at
sunrise this morning, we observed the fog lying in long lines in
many localities from west by north to east; which lines of fog I
take to indicate the lake-valley.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 5.&mdash;This morning, in order
to reduce the loads of our horses as far as possible, and it
being not probable that we shall require them, as their first set
of shoes are still good, and not nearly worn out, we threw away
all the spare horse shoes, the total weight of which was about 70
lbs. Started at 10 am, and at 0.15 p.m. halted in some good feed.
Direct distance 6 miles W. by S.</p>
<p>We passed a great number of bare rocks, generally very little
elevated above the surrounding ground, but some of them covering
perhaps 10 acres; the remainder of our route was pretty equally
divided between alluvial soil, and sand-plains; the country being
still as dry and dusty as before. At about 4 miles from this
morning's camp my mare Beauty again knocked up, lying down on the
road, and refusing to proceed, although carrying only my empty
saddle. As I see that there is no hope of my getting her on into
York, I abandoned her where she lay down the second time. I have
no doubt that with rest she will recover her strength, and I hope
that she will find her way back to York, in the course of a month
or two.</p>
<p>Poppet also, a mare supplied by Messrs. Phillips and Co., was
much knocked up to-day, and I fear that we shall not take her in
with us.</p>
<p>It is now evident that our journeys must be restricted to 6 or
7 miles per day, until we get into much more nutritious feed,
than any which our horses have had for the last month; but, as we
still have provisions sufficient for two months consumption, and
shall probably be able to get kangaroo when we reach 150 miles of
York, our present distance being about 300 miles. I am not at
present under any anxiety, with reference to food; but these very
short distances make the time pass very tediously, the excitement
of novelty and of the vague hopes and expectations which we
indulged at starting, being now exhausted, and as our homeward
track is only some 50 miles to the south of our outward track, we
cannot even expect to see any country materially different from
what we have already seen.</p>
<p>Up to this date we have experienced none of the hardships,
which so frequently fall to the lot of explorers, and upon which,
in proportion as they are painful in the actual, one is apt to
look back in the past, with somewhat of pride and satisfaction,
and unless all our horses should knock up, and have to be
abandoned, I trust we shall get back to York without any great
measure of them. We have the most delightful weather which can be
conceived, an abundant ration, and from the weakness of our
horses, very short hours of travel. I should find the time less
heavy on my hands, my few books and the conversational powers of
my companions being now quite used up, if our daily travelling
distances were doubled.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Kowitch and myself walked back along our
track to where my mare had been left. We found her feeding near
that spot, but so weak that I do not intend to attempt to take
her on with us.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 6.&mdash;In consequence of having
rested one day during the past week, and of having made such very
short journeys during the other days, I thought it necessary to
make a short journey to-day, although Sunday. Accordingly we
started at 11 a.m., and at 2 p.m. camped at another bare rock
where we found better feed than usual. Travelling distance 9
miles, direct distance 8 miles W. by S.</p>
<p>We observed to-day, for the first time during many weeks, a
few fine tall blackboys, (xanthorroeas) on the upper part of a
sand-plain.</p>
<p>We passed many bare rocks with grass about them, and about one
half our route was over alluvial soils.</p>
<p>In the evening read the Church Service for the day.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 7.&mdash;Started at 8.15 a.m.,
and at 0.20 p.m. camped at a bare rock, with water, but very poor
feed about. Direct distance 11 miles W. 1½ S.</p>
<p>The weakness of Spy and Monarch compelled us to halt at this
bare rock, as there appeared to be no prospect that we should
find better feed within any distance that they would be able to
travel. We passed one large dry lake bed, which did not appear to
form a link of any chain of lakes. Our route lay mostly over
sand-plain.</p>
<p>In a gully, cut 5 or 6 feet, and draining the lower side of a
extensive sand-plain, a good section of the geological formation
of the country was exhibited, as the solid granite was shown at
the bottom; on it a fine, hard marl, or sandstone, having a
thickness of 2 or 3 feet and a dull white color; then a gravelly
soil of a light red color, containing pebbles of ironstone, and
having a thickness of about one foot; this being the surface
soil.</p>
<p>The white colored rock in this locality, and generally to the
eastward of this, (which rock I think is more correctly
described, as a marl than as a sandstone,) is no doubt
geologically identical with the dull whitish sandstone which I
have described in former part of this Journal, as a rock of
undoubtedly marine origin, and bedded immediately on the granite
all through the country eastward of the Avon. I have little doubt
that the rock described by Flinders as forming clifts on the
western shores of the Australian Bight, which attain an elevation
of 4 or 500 feet, and which have since been described by Eyre as
a chalk, is only an extension and great vertical development of
this rock.</p>
<p>The fact of its texture here much resembling that of a marl,
whereas near the Avon it is lithologically a common sandstone I
ascribe to the large proportion of feldspar contained in the
granite of this country, and on the assumption that this really
is the rock which forms the white cliffs of the western shores of
the Bight, I conclude that the granite has there dipped far
beneath the surface, and that the existing surface in consequence
has a very poor soil.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 8.&mdash;Start at 8.45 a.m., and
at 1 p.m. camp at another bare rock, with, poor feed about it.
Direct distance 11 miles west.</p>
<p>The greater part of the country traversed to-day is
sand-plain.</p>
<p>Monarch and Spy very nearly knocked up again to-day, and only
with much trouble were they brought on to the camp. I fear that
they will not travel with us many more miles, even without any
load whatever.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 9.&mdash;Started at 9 a.m., and
at 1.30 p.m. reached another bare rock, near a dry lake, with
plenty of samphire in the lake, and excellent grass about the
rock. Direct distance 17 miles W.</p>
<p>The greater part of our route again to-day has been over a
sand-plain, here and there broken by wooded hills, mostly capped
with ironstone. Monarch, who carried only 1 empty riding saddle
knocked up, and was left about 6 miles from the camp, and Spy,
who also carried 2 riding saddles, also knocked up, and was left
one mile from camp&mdash;in both cases being pushed on as far as
it was possible to get them.</p>
<p>We observed several native fires on the north side of our
track to-day, and about 4 p.m. when all of us were very tired,
and apparently had no prospect of getting water or grass
to-night, very fortunately we were accosted by three natives, who
approached within about 300 yards of us, and standing there,
shouted that they were mena men, pronouncing the word 'men' as
distinctly as possible.</p>
<p>I immediately despatched Kowitch alone to them, fearing that
if more of us went towards them, they might be frightened and run
away, and I was very happy to observe that he had not much
difficulty in making himself understood by them.</p>
<p>He soon learnt that one of them had been to Lake Dambling,
near Kojunup, and another had once been to Comining, Mr Smith's
station; that both had seen white men and sheep, and had tasted
damper and tea, and that other black fellows had seen our outward
track. On making known to them that we were searching for water
and grass for our horses to-night, they readily offered to take
us to both which they accomplished in a distance of about 2
miles.</p>
<p>It was very interesting to observe the high spirits into which
this friendly meeting with these three natives put Kowitch, and
the animated and most noisy conversation which he and they
sustained, not only during the short distance they guided us, but
at least up to midnight after arrival at our camp, where they
spent the night.</p>
<p>We of course entertained them most hospitably on tea, damper,
and pork, not so much in payment for the really valuable service
which they rendered in taking us to good water and feed, which we
probably should not have found without them, and at a time when
all our horses are showing signs of knocking up, as with a view
to conciliate their good-will and services to the squatters whom
I hope to see dispersed over this country in the course of the
next 2 or 3 years, and to whom it will be in their power to
render valuable services.</p>
<p>As it may facilitate the finding of these natives to those who
may shortly send their flocks out into this country, I record
their native names, which are as follows: Kumbar, Dandokoert, and
Kiddymurrin.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 10.&mdash;This morning Mr.
Robinson and my self, accompanied by Kiddymurrin and Dandokoert
went back to fetch up Monarch and Spy, which we accomplished
about noon, though, the former, who had wandered about the
greater part of the night on barren hills, quite destitute of
feed, was driven in with much difficulty, but I hope by resting
here all to-day and to-morrow, we may yet be able to get them and
all the other horses back to York with very easy stages, and
driving two or three of the weaker ones without any loads
whatever.</p>
<p>An excellent sheep-station might be formed at this rock, the
native name of which is Kicharring, there being plenty of grass
about it, and plenty of samphire about the lake Moonberry, which,
as far as I can understand the natives, or rather Kowitch can do
so, is one of a chain running from north to south, (but upon this
point it is difficult to make the natives understand the purport
of the question) and not a solitary lake.</p>
<p>The former version is the more probable, and conforms to my
observation of the features of the neighbourhood, and also to my
experience all through this country.</p>
<p>As two of these natives are to go with us as far as Mr Smith's
station, I hope, by dint of patient enquiry and
cross-examination, to obtain from them much useful information
relative to the climate and prominent natural features of this
country, before the conclusion of our journey.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 11.&mdash;After breakfast, myself
and one of the natives started to explore the lakes, and to
ascertain whether they form a chain or not. In a walk of about 3
hours we crossed 6 or 7 lakes, trending to north and north-east
in the ascending direction, and to the southward in the
descending direction.</p>
<p>From a careful examination of the lakes and their margins, I
arrived at the following conclusions, namely:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. Either from a gradual diminution in the mean rainfall, or
from a slow secular uprising of the entire country, or more
probably from both these causes combined; these lakes hold much
less water now than formerly. The conclusion is founded on the
following phenomena, namely:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. Many of these lakes are now overgrown with samphire
through their entire areas.</p>
<p>2nd. Others are overgrown with samphire throughout the central
portions of their areas, leaving between these and their banks a
narrow margin, which is under water in some, but not in all,
winters.</p>
<p>3rd. No one of these lakes contains any water whatever at
present, but their floors are generally a dry, hard, and, where
the soul is light, dusty as at midsummer; and the natives assert
positively that they will not have any water whatever this
winter, the rainy season being over; but that they all contained
water last winter. Although it is impossible to obtain from them
a positive and persistent reply to the questions whether the
lakes being dry throughout the year be an usual or unusual
phenomenon, from the general tenor of their replies, and the
absence of any expression to the effect that this has been an
unusually dry winter, I am inclined to think it has not that
character with them, and consequently that these lakes are
frequently dry the entire year.</p>
<p>4th. Intumescencies of the bare granite rock cross out in many
points on the margins of these lakes, and the faces of these I
found universally to be worn into shallow caves and cavities of
varied forms, by the ripple of the lake waters; but, to enable
such ripples to reach them, the water must formerly have had a
depth of 7 or 6 feet in the central parts of the lakes, whereas
both the distribution of samphire and the testimony of the
natives alike show that the depth of water in them never in any
winter exceeds 8 or 10 inches, under existing conditions.</p>
<p>2nd. The granite crops out, either in the bank or very close
behind the banks, of all these lakes, and in three or four
localities about each lake. The granite, as we have also
elsewhere ever found to be the case* holding water at this season
of the year in the cavities of its surface, and being surrounded
with a larger or smaller margin of grass, and one or more native
wells, holding permanent water, existing in the earth-filled
cavities of each rock.</p>
<p>3rd. My former statement of the dullish white colored
fine-grained sandstone, sometimes approaching, as here, to a marl
in texture, and mechanical character, immediately overlying the
granite and underlying the red colored soils, whether schists or
clays, sands or gravels, derived from them, is fully confirmed by
the sections exhibited in various localities of the cliffs or
banks of these lakes, which I carefully examined, with special
reference to this point. Further, that both the former and the
latter are bedded conformably to the existing undulating surfaces
of the granite.</p>
<p>4th. The entire country has a considerable slope from the
northward, the northern banks of each of these lakes being
invariably the highest, and when exhibiting the granite, that
granite being the most water-worn by the ripples of the former
hike surfaces.</p>
<p>5th. The absence of rivers, gullies, and other natural water
channels, is to be ascribed, not to a want of slope in the
surface of the country, or the porosity of soil, (for the porous
soils here cover a very small fraction of the surface), but
exclusively to the very small rainfall.</p>
<p>Since writing the above, I have ascertained from our three new
native guides, of whom one has been actually to the south coast,
and the other two a considerable portion of the way towards it,
that bare rocks are to be found only for a distance of two days'
journey south of this, and that the country thence to the coast
is sandy, poor, grassless, and lakeless, from which testimony,
combined with the observations of Flinders and Eyre on the cliffs
of the Bight, I infer that the granite gradually dips from this
parallel towards the south, and that the depression has been
filled&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. With a great vertical thickness of the chalky
white-colored marl or sandstone, which was undoubtedly deposited
before any portion of the granite, from which its materials were
derived, had reached the surface of the ocean, and before the
waters of the ocean obtained (from whatever source) those salts
of iron with which the red sedimentary rocks, whether schists and
conglomerates, or soils derived from them, have been colored.</p>
<p>2nd. With these same red-colored schists and conglomerates, or
with a soil derived from them.</p>
<p>The hypothesis of the unbroken granite crust slowly dipping
towards the south is confirmed both by the testimony of these
natives that the bare granite hills extend, and increase in
number, so far as they have any knowledge of the country, to the
north of this, and by the observation of Mr Austin as to their
extension towards the north in the line of country traversed by
the exploring expedition under his command in 1854. The native
name of the lake near which we slept these two nights is</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 12.&mdash;Started at 11 a.m., and
at 2 p.m. camped by the side of another lake, of which the native
name is Wallwalshibby, and on some bare rock, with a fair
quantity of grass about it, and plenty of samphire on the lake.
Direct distance 10 miles. Country traversed, principally
sand-plains, with a considerable quantity of coarse grass on them
We again passed several lakes; all dry, and covered with
samphire.</p>
<p>Started at 9.40 a.m., and at 2 p.m. camped at another very
open hill side, exhibiting many small intumesencies of the
granite, and covered with excellent grass for the horses; the old
grass having been burnt during last summer. The native name of
the hill is Budarding.</p>
<p>Our direct distance made to-day is 10 miles W. The country
traversed is principally sand-plain, with much coarse grass and
other herbage on it, and many lakes in its depressions, of which
two contained water of a depth of 1 or 2 inches; the remainder
were dry, and covered with samphire.</p>
<p>This morning we had for breakfast 2 ducks, which Kowitch shot
last evening, being the first ducks killed by any of the party
since we left York; and we all enjoyed them not a little, as we
are getting rather tared of our unvarying diet of cold salt pork
and damper.</p>
<p>Our horses travelled better to-day than for the last 3 week's,
having evidently benefitted by the many day's rests which they
have latterly had, and I hope that by restricting our journeys to
10 or 11 miles per day, and by putting on the three weakest of
our horses the empty saddles only, we shall be able to take all
in, except the three already abandoned. This is much more than a
fortnight since I expected to accomplish.</p>
<p>This evening read the Church Service for the day to all the
party.</p>
<p>To-day we learnt from the three natives who are accompanying
us to Mr Smith's station, and whose replies to the question were
positive and satisfactory, that the lakes in this neighbourhood
never overflow from one into another; but that each receives, and
retains until evaporated, the drainage of the sur rounding
country; which fact furnishes further evidence of the smallness
of the annual rainfall here; as a depth of 3 feet of water would
generally make any of these lakes overflow info the lake
adjacent; and it cannot he objected that much water may be
received into the lake-basins, and there lost by soakage into the
subsoil, as the floors of many, in fact of most of these lakes
are imporous red or white clays, and the subsoil under these
floors is generally a very hard and compact rock, composed of
small pebbles of granite, bedded in a tenacious dark red clay,
and I apprehend very imporous.</p>
<p>With reference to the very important question of the supply of
sweet and good water to be obtained by well-sinking all through
this singular country, it being evident that, for 8 or 9 months
of every year from the defect of surface water and of all natural
springs, the flocks, which I anticipate will occupy this country
in a few years, must depend entirely on well water, and therefore
that the distribution of water within the soil is a problem of
peculiar interest, I will here briefly record my opinion,
namely,</p>
<p>1st. That good water can be stored up only in those cavities
and rugosities of the buried portion of the long sloping surfaces
of the intumescencies or undulations of the granitic crust, which
form the bills, both soil-covered and bare or bald, of the
country, through which (cavities and rugosities) in every rainy
season, the drainage of both the exposed and soil-covered face of
tha granite flows (<i>into some lower receptacle or
reservoir</i>), which here is a valley containing either a chain
of lakes, or an isolated lake; in the latter case being correctly
termed a basin, and not a valley.</p>
<p>2nd. That all water obtained in these ultimate receptacles of
drainage must be salt; because the subsoils of these must contain
the salt brought down into them annually, for countless ages, by
the drainage from the above-mentioned higher portions of the
granitic surface, as those salts must be left in the soil in each
summer's evaporation of the drainage of the preceding winter.</p>
<p>Now there is no doubt that sodium is a constituent of all
primitive granite, and that the granite of Western Australia
contains this element in comparatively large quantity. Hence, on
the most obvious and substantial theoretical grounds, the
substrata of the undrained valley bottoms of this country would
be inferred to contain much salt, and experience, in the only
case in which the matter was tested by us, fully confirmed such
an inference; for Hall having sunk a hole about 18 inches deep in
the floor of the lake at which we camped on the, and allowed it
to fill by infiltration, hoping thereby to get clear water in
lieu of the liquid mud which covered the lake floor, succeeded
indeed in getting clear water, but it was as salt as the
strongest brine.</p>
<p>In fact here, as everywhere else in this colony, a mass of
soil, of whatever texture, which is so situated as to adjacent
imporous rocks that water will soak into, but cannot drain or
percolate through, it, is sure to abound in salt; and as there is
an annual drainage or percolation into, but no drainage or
percolation through the soil-strata of the wide valleys and lake
chains of this country, it is evident that these strata must
receive and retain all the soluble salts contained in the surface
of the exposed granite annually disintegrated, when the water
itself has been evaporated by the summer sun.</p>
<p>Such being the physical elements of the problem, the future
settlers of this district most limit their search for good water
to the upper portions of the hills, (or intumescencies of the
granite) whether earth covered or bare, and having studied the
contour of the bare portions of the rock, and that of the sloping
ground which conceals the lower portions of every intumescence of
the granite, form the best conjecture which may be passable as to
the position of the concavities and rugosities of the surface of
the granite buried under the soil, and sink his well directly
into the computed centre of one of these.</p>
<p>From my observation of the fact that one or more of the
shallow native wells exists in the vicinity of each rock all
through this country, and from my estimate of the probable
rugosity of the soil-covered portion of every bald hill-side, I
anticipate that a little experience and good common sense will
enable the settlers of this district to find inexhaustible
supplies of water in the margin of every bare rock and at
comparatively trifling expense, both as to first sinking (the
soil in the margin of the rocks being always light and porous),
and as to the subse quent lifting of the water for the use of the
flocks and herds and perhaps experience will show that any little
expense which has to be incurred in these two operations is more
than recouped to the stock owners of this country by the superior
control over their stock, more particularly over all horses and
cattle, and their consequent greater tameness and tractability,
which the absence of all surface water for the greater and hotter
part of every year, will enforce on the latter, by compelling
them to come in to some well, and there receive water from the
hand of man, instead of being able to drink at some part remote
from the habitation and sight of man.</p>
<p>In my opinion there can be no question that the many
advantages and economies incidental to this enforced daily
approach to, and reliance on, man, operating on the extensive
herds of horses and cattle which are likely to be fed in this
country, will much exceed in value the cost of artificial
watering, and I expect that every one who has had the misfortune
to possess large herds of horses or cattle scattered in a
semi-wild state over an extensive country, will readily concur in
this opinion.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 14.&mdash;Started at 8 a.m. and
at 11.50 a.m., camped at a native well, called Churtmony, with
fair feed about it, and several small lakes near it. Direct
distance 11 miles west by north. Our entire route this day was
through a continuation of sand-plains, slightly broken here and
there by lakes and wooded valleys.</p>
<p>Monarch and Spy, although carrying only one riding saddle
each, could with difficulty be kept up in the rear of the train,
and I expect that we must reduce our daily distance to 7 or 8
miles, in order to take them on with us.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 15.&mdash;Started at 8 a.m. and
0.25 p.m. camped at a bare rock, with water and grass, of which
the native name is Northa-nopine. Direct distance 12 miles west.
About 8 miles of our route lay through sand-plains, of a light
yellow colour probably derived from feldspar, and of a texture
which would dispose the soil to lead into a firm road under a
moderate amount of traffic, and carrying, a considerable quantity
of coarse grass and other herbage suitable for sheep and horses.
In fact such is the prevailing character of all the sand-plains
in this country, and I have no doubt that they will prove
valuable as sheep runs. The remainder of our route lay through
fine stiff alluvial land, admirably adapted to wheat growing.</p>
<p>I have omitted to record heretofore that the three natives who
have now accompanied us 4 days as guides to Smith's station, are
perfectly naked, as are all the natives of this country, which
affords a strong proof of the mildness of its winter climate
since, although the country is quite destitute of kangaroos, it
abounds in opossums, dammars, and kangaroo rats from the skins of
which they might easily manufacture cloaks, if the climate were
such as to render them essential to their health or comfort.</p>
<p>Since we have been accompanied by these three natives, I have
been much impressed with a fact, which, having a strong bearing
on the science of philology, and not having observed it recorded
in the journals of other explorers, I here record, for the
consideration of any philologists into whose hands a copy of this
Journal may perchance fall, namely, that whilst the natives
instantly repeat any and every English word, phrase, or short
sentence which may be addressed to them, with most marvellous
correctness of pronunciation and intonation, and apparently with
perfect facility, although without the most remote conception of
the Import of any one of the words, Kowitch our York native, has
very great difficulty in catching, and repeating not only short
sentences, but even single words, such as names of persons,
places; and natural objects, uttered by them, and when I want to
get the name of a place, a tree, or any other object, Kowitch has
to make them repeat the word several times before he can catch it
and then evidently has to modify and amplify its parts not a
little before he can make it comprehensible and analagible to my
ear.</p>
<p>The fact is that these euphonious and well developed names,
whether of persons or places, which appear in our own maps of
this colony, and are adopted by the Europeans generally as the
native names of the same, have as small similitude to the genuine
original native names which they purport to be, as one of the now
thicket-covered hill-sides of this country has to what the same
hill-sides may be one or two hundred years time, when covered
with highly cultivated fields, gardens, vineyards, nurseries
&amp;c., or perhaps more nearly, such as the river Clyde in
Scotland, with its enormous and innumerable ships steamers,
wharfs, and sea-walls of the present day, has to the same river
of two centuries ago, when a cutter of 20 or 30 tons burden could
with difficulty be brought up it. What locking, dredging,
canalizing, embanking, and walling have done to develop into
ample and harmonious proportion many hundreds of streams in
Europe and North America during the last two centuries, that the
alphabet, grammar, and arts of writing and printing, and finally
poetry and literature in general, have done for the current of
human speech in all the nations of mankind which happily have
enjoyed the invaluable advantages. But few of those whose lot has
been cast under these happier auspices can adequately conceive
the vast measure of harmony, distinctness and what, for want of a
better term, I would designate as organic development, by which
their language even in its lowest forms, is separated from the
shapeless utterences of the wild man, whose race for a thousand
generations has possessed neither religion, laws, poetry,
literature, social institutions, nor traditions, and who probably
does not exchange words with fifty individuals beyond his own
wife and family in the course of twelve months.</p>
<p>The fact is that the alphabets of civilized nations ancient
and modern, however defective they all have been, and are, have
still suffice to the great purpose of giving form, harmonious
development, and proportion to human speech; whilst religion
laws, poetry, and political institutions have given a permanency
to the parts of speech, from generation to generation which
cannot exist in the isolated families of wild men, who are
utterly destitute of all those elements of social life, and whose
undeveloped speech consequently undergoes a greater mutation by
the combined action of degradation and capricious
introsusception, within the life-time of one generation, than
that of Greece has done in the twenty-five centuries which have
elapsed since Homer painted, in immortal lines, alike the heroes
who avenged and defended, the seduction of their frail and fair
queen and countrywoman.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 16.&mdash;Started at 8. a.m., and
at 0.30 p.m. camped at another and very extensive bare rock, of
which the native name is Moltthomy. Direct distance 10 miles W.
by S.</p>
<p>This rock is surrounded by a great extent of excellent
pasture, and in our route to day we have passed over three other
bare rocks, each surrounded by grass, about 4 miles of rich
alluvial soil, and as many of the loamy yellow-coloured
sand-plains, which carry a vast quantity of grass and other
herbage suitable to sheep.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 17.&mdash;Started at 8 a.m., and
at 11.45 a.m. camped at a swamp, called Mondagee. Direct distance
10 miles W. S. W.</p>
<p>Our route to-day has been entirely through forest land, of
which rather less than one-half has been a fine sticky stiff
soil, suitable to the cultivation of wheat&mdash;the remainder
has been of a lighter character. The forest consists of woorook,
morrel and cedar.</p>
<p>In consequence of its having rained both last night and the
previous night, we found the ground rather boggy in some places,
particularly in the vicinity of the rock which we quitted this
morning, and probably, if we had been without the guidance of the
natives, who know the country, we should have experienced some
difficulty from the circumstance.</p>
<p>The feed round this swamp is at present poorer than any which
our horses have had for some week's past, but probably there is
good feed on the swamp itself in the summer-time.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 18.&mdash;Started at 9 a.m., and
0.20 p.m. camped on a lofty and extensive hill, called
Nullah-culling, on the top of which a considerable quantity of
bare rock comes to the surface.</p>
<p>This is one of the most picturesque and pleasant looking
camping grounds which we have had during the Expedition, all the
upper portion of the hill being very open, with a thin sprinkling
of fine jam and oak, (casuarina) trees, distributed both in small
groups and singly, and with an excellent bite of grass around
them. It would make a very eligible sheep-station, its distance
from Comining being about miles..</p>
<p>Direct distance made to-day 9 miles W., of which distance 4
lay over an excellent stiff red alluvial soil, the remainder over
sand-plains, which, as usual, contain much grass and herbage
suitable to sheep.</p>
<p>Rain having fallen all yesterday afternoon and last night, the
country has become very boggy, and in consequence, although we
travelled only 3 hours and 20 minutes, both ourselves and horses
were more than usually fatigued when we camped.</p>
<p>As we are now approaching so near the termination of our
exploration, our distance from Comining not exceeding miles, and
since throughout the entire country traversed by the Expedition
we have invariably found grass around the base of every bare
rock, and water in the cavities of its surface I will here
suggest a solution of the phenomenon of the superior quality of
the grass close around the margins of the bare rocks, as compared
with that half-way down the hill-sides, or in the bottoms of the
wide valleys which between the hills&mdash;a problem which was
frequently before my mind.</p>
<p>The proportion of the mineral elements of agricultural
contained in equal masses of granite increases with the depth of
original bedding of each block, or, in other words, the greater
the depth of the bedding of any block of granite in the primeval
foundation of the granite crust, the greater the proportion of
the mineral elements of agricultural fertility which it will
contain; the masses compared being taken in the same vertical
column.</p>
<p>Now it is evident that the existing soil around the margin of
any bald hill must be formed by a more recent disintegration of a
portion of the rock's surface, than the subsoil of the same
margin, or than the surface soil at a greater distance from the
rock.</p>
<p>Therefore it must be formed from the disintegration of a
portion of the rock which originally under lay that, from the
disintegration of which the more distant surface soil and the
adjacent subsoil were derived; that is, from a portion of the
rock originally endowed with a larger proportion of the elements
of agricultural fertility.</p>
<p>But the existing surface soil around the margins of the vast
bare rocks is not, in fact, derived from a richer quality of
granite, than that from its subsoil and the more distant surface
soil were derived, but in the former case less time has been
afforded to the winter rains to wash out of it, and down into the
neighbouring valley bottom, all the soluble salts formed in the
disintegration of the minute fragments of granite which primarily
constituted the soil than in the latter case; therefore both
being compounded of better original materials, and from those
better materials, have been less worn out or expended, the
surface soil around the margin of every bare rock should be, as
our observation shewed us that it universally is, better and
richer than the sample at a considerable distance, say half a
mile from the margin of the same rock.</p>
<p>On the principles herein propounded, it is evident that the
wide alluvial bottoms of the undrained valleys, which have
received and retained perhaps for hundreds of thousands of years
soluble salts washed down into them from the exposed surfaces of
adjacent projections of rock, must be extremely rich in those
elements of fertility, and I feel confident that experience will
prove them to be so.</p>
<p>But in ascribing the fertility of the alluvial soils of the
wide plains and valleys to the cause above defined let me not be
supposed to ascribe to such agency the mechanical formation of
these alluvials. This must be ascribed to oceanic action during
the ages which probably were expended in the slow emergence of
this country from the sea, during which I believe, for, reasons
elsewhere stated, that its contour was very similar to that which
it now possesses.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, the finer particles of matter derived
from the detrition and disintegration of the masses of rock
projections above the general level of the floors of the ocean,
would be held in suspension by the waters of the ocean for a time
and finally deposited at a greater or less distance from their
sites of derivation, there forming fine grained strata of clay,
whilst the coarser particles would form a gravelly soil round the
margin of each such projecting mass of rock.</p>
<p>Viewed under these aspects, the observed distribution of the
soils of this rich district is entirely comformable to the views
which I have in other parts of this Journal ventured to propound
of the geology of the entire country as far as the red-stone face
of the Darling Range, particularly to an opinion which I have
previously expressed that its elevation from beneath the ocean
was due to no topical elevating forces, as these would certainly
have left some evidence of that action in tilted and and
dislocated rocks and strata, but is to be ascribed solely to a
relatively slow rate of contraction of the earth's radius, in
this portion of its surface, as compared with its rate of
contraction in other portions of the sphere, and which would of
course have the same effect of relatively elevating the surface
here, as a positive elevatory force of a topical nature.</p>
<p>When sufficient geological sections of this country to afford
a satisfactory basis for an estimate of the mean thickness of the
sedimentary rocks shall have been obtained&mdash;and, as I have
elsewhere stated, I believe their mean thickness to be singularly
small, and on the actual track of the Expedition to be much less
than 100 feet, increasing to the southward, and diminishing to
the northward,&mdash;this country will probably afford to
geologists more ample and satisfactory data than any other
equally extensive portion of the surface of the earth for the
discussion and approximate solution of a problem of great
interest, specially in geology, but also in physical science
generally, and the theories of the gradual and successive
development of the existing physical conditions of this planet,
namely, the amount of the undulations and prominences of the
granite crust of the earth, at the epoch of its consolidation
from a state of fusion due to heat, because it will be easy to
estimate from such date what must have been the original
elevation of the existing prominancy of rock, over the adjacent
depressions of its surface, which are now filled by sedimentary
rocks and the surface soil.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 19.&mdash;Started at 8 a.m., and
at 4.10 p.m. camped on a rocky piece of ground, with a fair
quantity of grass, but with no water within a mile to which
distance we had to send the natives to fetch water for our tea.
Travelling distance 22 miles, direct distance 16 miles, as the
natives led us by a very circuitous route to avoid thickets.
About one-third of the route traversed was stiff and apparently
rich alluvial soil; the remainder was divided between sand-plains
and thickets.</p>
<p>At about 7 miles from last night's camp, from the highest part
of an extensive sand-plain which we crossed, we observed Mount
Hampton, of which the native name is Boojarring, bearing north
25d. W. by compass, distant 20 miles; it being by far the most
lofty and conspicuous hill which we have observed in the whole
journey, Borayukkin and Tampin bearing from same point W. 7d. S.
and W. 15d. S. at apparent distances of about 18 and 25 miles
respectively.</p>
<p>This has perhaps been the most fatiguing journey which we have
had during the Expedition which is due not only to the distance
travelled but to the stiffness of the ground, which made the
walking very heavy.</p>
<p>At about 12 miles from our camp of last night we came upon our
track made in this sixth day of our outward journey, at a
distance of about 4 miles from our fifth camp.</p>
<p>In discussing this day the question of the cause of the
extreme scarcity of the larger game, such as kangaroos, emus, and
gnows, in this rich and extensive district, we arrived at the
following conclusion, which I here mention, as it may be of
interest to those who study the distribution of animal life on
the surface of the globe, namely, that this scarcity is due
entirely and solely to the absence of water in this country in a
large portion of the year, and to the necessity thereby imposed
on the fauna of the country to come to the native wells to drink,
which gives the natives such facility of destroying them, that
they have completely extirpated the kangaroos, and have reduced
the emus and gnows to a very scanty number.</p>
<p>This theory is confirmed by the observed fact of the abundance
of the kangaroo and emu in every portion of the colony, at the
introduction of the white man and his flocks, where large
surfaces of permanent water exist, and also is negatively
supported by the unquestionable certainty that, if these species
of game had existed ever so abundantly in the district at the
epoch of the first immigration of man, (not the game-law-loving
Anglo Saxon, but wild black men), the latter would infallibly
have reduced them to their present limited numbers, in the course
of a few years, or, at most, of a generation or two, availing
themselves of the facility of destroying them, which the scarcity
of surface water at many seasons of the year would give them.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 20.&mdash;In consequence of there
being no water for our horses, and that for ourselves being at a
distance of a mile from our camp, and very muddy, we were
compelled to move on this morning, adding another to the many
Sundays on which we have been under the necessity of
travelling.</p>
<p>Started at 10 a.m., and at 1.20 p.m. camped at a large bald
rock, called Water-biddin, which we passed on the forenoon of our
fifth day's outward journey. Direct distance&mdash;9 miles
west.</p>
<p>There is an excellent grass on every side of this rock.</p>
<p>I learnt from our guides to-day that the native name of Mount
Bayly is Torlgoring.</p>
<p>From the top of this hill Borayukkin and Tampin bear
respectively W. 12d. S. and W. 43d. S, true, at apparent
distances of 9 miles and 27 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 21.&mdash;Started at 9 a.m., and
at 0.15 p.m. camped at Borayukkin. Direct distance 9 miles W.
12d. S.</p>
<p>Nearly the entire route to-day has been through alluvial soil,
in general thinly covered with timber woorock, and morrel.</p>
<p>In the course of this day's journey we had considerable
difficulty in getting the horses through several boggy places,
and if their loads had not been very light we should have been
obliged to make considerable circuits to avoid such places.</p>
<p>Borayukkin is a very fine massive rock with an excellent sheep
run about it, and the rock on which we camped on our second night
from Tampin, on the outward journey, and of which the native name
is Mullocutty, is about 4 miles from it, bearing E. 40d S. by
compass.</p>
<p>I have carefully examined the surface of this hill, as well as
that of most of the hills (bare rocks,) which we have passed or
encamped at during the past fort night, and have found them all
destitute of those wavy striae which I have elsewhere recorded as
being exhibited on the surface of all the bare rocks 100 miles to
the eastward of this.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 22.&mdash;Started at 9.30 a.m.,
and at 2.10 p.m., camped at a small pond of water in a gum
forest, with grass at a distance of about one half mile.
Travelling distance 14 miles; direct distance 12 miles N.W. by
W.</p>
<p>At about 300 yards from the rock at Borayukkin, on its west
side, we found the remains of a bush-hut erected by the Messrs.
Dempster in their expedition two winters since, and we followed
their track, bearing north-west, about 7 miles, when we left it
to our right, on a clear piece of grassy ground, where the
natives shewed us the spot at which a party of white men had
erected a tent, and remained for two days about 8 or 9 years
ago.</p>
<p>Our route to-day was again principally through alluvial
forest-covered land, and thickets, growing on a good alluvial
soil, as in fact many descriptions of thicket appear always to
grow on.</p>
<p>From this camp, according to the shewing of our native guides,
Tampin bears S.W., Narimbeen W. and Wardering N.W. by W.</p>
<p>The natives tell us that we shall reach Narimbeen (about 3
miles E. by S. from Mr Smith's station, Comining), by a six
hours' journey to-morrow&mdash;a consummation, which, with the
usual impatience of the actual, and craving for a progress
bearing us along to our ends, which marks the weakness of human
nature for any particular enjoyment or occupation, such as rest,
exercise, food, conversation, thought, &amp;c., we all ardently
desire; although we have experienced little of hardships or
fatigue, and have had much enjoyment in this expedition, for
which I trust we shall all be sincerely grateful to a merciful
Providence, which has watched over us; and although we shall
probably, ere long, look back with regret to the conclusion of
this expedition, and earnestly wish to embark in another.</p>
<p>The country has been in places very boggy again to-day, and we
have had more or less gentle rain all day.</p>
<p>From the account of the natives, the Messrs. Dempsters came to
Borayukkin from the northward, and proceeded from it to
Wardering, and thence to Comining.</p>
<p>Whilst the subject is on my mind, I would here respectfully
suggest that areas of 4 or 6 mile, square, of which the centres
shall coincide with the highest point of each bald rock, be
reserved as sites for future towns and suburban allotments about
Borayukkin, Tampin, and Boojarring, to which latter rock, which
is by far the loftiest and most extensive of any which we have
discovered throughout the expedition, I have proposed to attach
the name of his Excellency Governor Hampton, and I would add to
this suggestion that in each case the entire area of bare rock be
reserved for public purposes, the streets of the town being laid
out around the margin of each rock.</p>
<p>Nothing could give a more unique and characteristic appearance
to the future towns of this country which undoubtedly is capable
of maintaining an exceedingly dense agricultural population, and
a wealthy landed aristocracy, than those massive and magnificent
elevations of bare rock, projecting in their respective centres
high above every structure raised by the hand of man, and
doubtless they would contribute no less to the health and
enjoyment of their future populations, than to the beauty of
their appearance.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 23.&mdash;Started at 9 a.m., and
at 4.30 p.m. to the great delight of all the party, reached
Narimbeen. Distance travelled 22 miles, direct distance 16 miles
west, the natives having taken us by a circuitous. route, as they
have a very imperfect knowledge of this country, having only been
at Comining once in their lives, when they came into it from the
north ward.</p>
<p>We were all very tired with our long walk, which, from the
boggy character of many places, was very fatiguing.</p>
<p>Again passed a large proportion of alluvial forest land, but
of a lighter colour, and apparently poorer quality than to the
eastward, the timber being of woorock and morrel; we also passed
two or three small patches of bare rock, with feed around, and
through about 2 miles of thicket and as many of sand-plain, which
again was of a far poorer quality than the sand-plains to the
eastward, and more thickly covered with a coarse gravel of iron
stone.</p>
<p>I observed to-day, for the first time for many weeks, a
sprinkling of fragments of quartz around the upper portion of
same of the low small rounder hills in the alluvial forests.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 24.&mdash;At 8 a.m. Mr Robinson
and myself walked over to Comining, Mr Smith's head station,
distant 3 miles west by north. Here we had the pleasure of
finding Mr W. Smith, and of getting some news as to the events of
the world, during our 81 days' seclusion from it, though Mr
Smith's information as to the topics reached only to the early
part of June, when he came out to this station, but he had one
Illustrated London News, of a later date than those which were
received in the colony prior to our departure, which he most
kindly lent us, and which I enjoyed with no less zest than that
with which we devoured a leg of mutton, which he also kindly
presented to us.</p>
<p>Mr Smith walked back with us to our camp at Narimbeen, and
showed me the figure 7 deeply cut on the stem of York gum,
growing by the side of a gully on the north side of the south,
which is the principal rock at Narimbeen, and distant from the
nearest part of the margin of that rock about 100 yards. He also
told me that the natives had shown him at a spot about 10 miles
W. by S. from Narimbeen another tree similarly marked with a
figure 6. I have no doubt that the figures designate respectively
the 6th and 7th camp from York of Messrs. Roe and Moore in their
expedition into this country made in the year 1836.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Note</span>.&mdash;When on my return to Perth
I brought the subject of the figures on these trees to Mr Roe's
attention, he kindly referred to his manuscript journal of the
expedition of 1836, and found that the spot which they designated
Emu hill was their 7th camp; that they inscribed the figure 7 on
a stem of a large York gum on the north side of that hill, as was
their practice at every camp. Thus there is no doubt that
Narimbeen is the Emu Hill of their designation.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 25.&mdash;After breakfast we
moved the camp on to Comining; there being excellent feed for the
horses about that rock.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we all joined in a game of cricket, which Mr
Smith invited us to, and which, albeit the ball was made the same
morning by Mr Smith out of thongs of kangaroo-skin, and the bat
was also chiselled by him out of a log of stinkwood, (which by
the bye, I think affords a valuable material for such purposes),
we all enjoyed much.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 26.&mdash;At 9 a.m. started with
Kowitch and a native of Comining called Harry, and three horses,
for Mulyeen, after seeing Mr Robinson and the remainder of the
party start on Mr Smith's road track to Dangin, at which place,
or at Bunmal, I am to rejoin them.</p>
<p>Having observed, in the hasty visit to Mulyeen, which I made
about 15 months since, that (for this country), very remarkable
elevation, boldness and fine form of the Mount Stirling Range (of
the highest point of which the native name is Goondering.) and
also been informed by Mr Smith and Kowitch of the existance of
caverns in a large rock called Karkabine a little to the east of
Mulyeen, I resolved to make a slight detour to examine these
objects.</p>
<p>Mr Smith accompanied me about two miles of the route to show
me a large rock, which he thought somewhat remarkable. Here I
found that three large narrow wedgelike portions, pointing
towards the centre and summit of the rock, had slid down a
vertical depth of probably some 50 or 60 feet. I doubt not that
these masses had been cut off from connexion with the remainder
of the rock by vertical fissures, and had thus been enabled to
sink and slide somewhat away from the parent mass. There was some
excellent grass about this rock, as in fact there is all over Mr
Smith's run.</p>
<p>At about 5 p.m. we camped at a bare rock, native name
Yarryarry, with a fine native well, and a fair quantity of grass
about it. Travelling distance 21 miles; direct distance 16 miles
N.W. our native guide having taken us by a circuitous route, on
the plea of avoiding thickets. We passed many fine bare rocks,
and a much greater quantity of grassy land, the grass being of a
more poor and wiry character than I had expected.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 27.&mdash;Started at 8 a.m., and
at 5.30 p.m. camped at another bare patch of rock, distant about
3 miles E. S. E. from the highest point of Mulyeen. Travelling
distance 25 miles; direct distance 23 miles W.</p>
<p>We passed to-day through or along the margin of a dozen lakes,
all very shallow, with the exception of one, as to which our
native guide informed us that its present depth is up to his
chin, and that it always retains water throughout the summer, but
that the water then becomes brackish.</p>
<p>All these lakes have white sand floors, and white sandy
margins, notwithstanding which indications of the barrenness of
the country, I observed a consider able quantity of samphire
about the margin of each.</p>
<p>A bare rock called Kokine, surrounded with a large extent of
poor grassy land, and having on its western side a fine permanent
spring which I should think would supply ample water for one
flock of sheep all the summer, combined with the samphire of the
lake valley, would render this an eligible station for one or two
flocks of sheep.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon we reached Karkabin, which certainly is
one of the most remarkable and interesting rocks which I have
ever seen in Western Australia.</p>
<p>It stands on the western side of a large bare sand-plain and
is distant from the highest point of Mulyeen hill (Mount Stirling
of the map I suppose) about 5 miles E. S. E.</p>
<p>Its most singular and striking features, as a whole, are seen
with great advantage at a distance of a mile, or more, on the
opposite slope of the sand-plain, towards the south east, and are
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. The nearly circular form of its horizontal section as
viewed from the south-east.</p>
<p>2nd. The great enlargement of the horizontal section of the
hill at the height of from 30 to 50 feet above the talus formed
round its margin&mdash;a phenomenon which, I doubt not, marks a
vast pause in the gradual elevation of the rock above the surface
of the ocean, during which the lower part of its periphery was
exposed, for a disproportionably long time, to the wearing action
of the waves and currents of a shoal sea, of which the latter,
from the contour of the adjacent sea floor (which, as elsewhere
observed and on similar grounds, I believe to have been almost
identical with that of the existing surface) must have been very
great.</p>
<p>3rd. The division of the portion of the rock visible above the
enclosing talus, by a nearly horizontal cleaveage, due probably
to difference of rate of cooling, into vast circular trunks of a
thickness varying from 20 to 40 feet.</p>
<p>4th. The prior, or, at least, contemporaneous cleavage of
gigantic scales of the rock from the upper portion of its sides,
and the lower portion of its sloping upper surface, which
overhangs, as above observed, the lower portion of its visible
base.</p>
<p>One of the vast scales of rock, which I do not think was by
any means the largest, but was the most accessible, I roughly
measured with my whip handle, and found its thickness to vary
from four to nine feet, its mean horizontal length to be more
than 20 yards; and its average height to be about 15 yards. It
had slid down a distance of about 63 or 70 yards, a large portion
of its lower edge was imbedded in the surrounding talus; its
upper edges rested against the vertical side of the parent rock,
between which and its interior concave surface was a great cavity
filled with angular blocks of rock of volumes varying from one to
eight or ten cubic yards, probably detached from the scale in the
act of sliding, and which the angular forms attest the fact that,
at the epoch of their deposition in this chasm, the sea had sunk
to a level at which its waves could not reach them.</p>
<p>Whether the long edges of these vast fragmentary sheaths or
scales ever coincide with any of the planes of horizontal
fissuring I had not time to examine, but it would be perfectly
easy to define to inches the portions of the surface from which
many of the scales have been derived, so perfectly do they still
retain, on their interior surfaces, their original form of
concavity. In fact they are both concentric and coaxial with the
mass of the rock.</p>
<p>5th. On the northern side of this hill, which is more
vertical, the upper portion of the rock does not overhang the
lower, but it presents a number of wave-worn cavities, in which
the vertical side of the rock has been eroded to a depth of 10 to
12 feet which erosions, standing at a level of about 40 feet
above the plain of maximum erosion on the eastern face, mark, I
think, another great pause in the progressive retirement of the
ocean from this part of the world.</p>
<p>Altogether a careful study of this very remarkable rock, in
all its features, impressing one so strongly with the idea of a
very limited topical elevatory force, operating very slowly
through a long period of time, and therefore not involving either
upheaving or tilting, has strongly confirmed the conclusion to
which the examination of innumerable other bare rocks in this
expedition had previously conducted me, namely, that we must
ascribe their developement to forces of a most limited topical
character; consequently acting at a comparatively shallow depth
under the surface, such as to the aggregation within, and
immediately under, the granitic crust, of masses of rocks, whose
secular rate of contraction in cooling is much less than that of
the adjacent granite.</p>
<p>It thus appears that to account fully for the existing
contour, and the elevation above the sea of this very singular
and geologically interesting portion of the earth's surface, we
must conceive,</p>
<p>1st. That during the secular transition of the mother granite
from a state of fluidity to its crystalline form, it passed
through a viscous or semi fluid state, in which some of its
mineral constituents being quantitatively in excess over the
remainder of them as to combination in crystallization under the
current conditions of temperature and pressure, the former were
partially aggregated into masses of comparatively limited volume,
different in composition and crystalline combination, from the
great mass of nearly homogeneous granite in which they floated;
and these masses, having either a more rapid rate of cooling than
that of the surrounding mass constituting the crust generally, or
in the cooling, obeying a law of contraction slightly different
from that followed by the crust generally in the chronic process
of contraction, whilst the granite generally was still in a
viscous state, gradually pressed upon, and bulged out, the
stratum of viscous granite floating upon them in numerous
localities, but without at that time rupturing it.</p>
<p>2nd. That, subsequently to this epoch, and probably separated
therefrom by a vast lapse of time, the entire country gradually
emerged from the ocean, not from any positive elevatory force
acting uniformly upon this large segment of the earth's surface;
for that would not probably have left evidences of its action in
tiltings and extended fissures of the crust generally, (and such
are nowhere to be seen); but, as I have already ventured to
suggest, from the more rapid contraction of the earth's radius,
in its secular cooling, in other portions of its mass, which
would of course enable the sea to drain off from this segment of
its surface.</p>
<p>3rd. The fissuring of the masses of these rocks in planes
determined by the distribution of its mineral constituents,
originally horizontal, but supposed, as above, to be drawn out of
the horizontal by these topical aggregations of matter obeying a
law of less rapid contraction in cooling both during the vast
ages in which they were submerged, and during the ages which have
elapsed since their emergence from the ocean.</p>
<p>If the above speculations be well founded, we may safely infer
that this extensive district, stretching from the meridian of 116
deg. E, at least as far as 123d. E., and I am inclined to believe
very much further, has enjoyed a permanence of form, a stability
of contour of surface, such as is probably unequalled by any
other portion of the earth's surface.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 28.&mdash;It raining hard all the
morning, we remained in camp until 3 p.m. when we moved on to a
very romantic and pretty looking little glen, abounding in fine
mountain oaks, close to the south side of the three principal
masses of bare rock which constitute the noble hill of Mulyeen,
Direct distance 2½ miles W.N.W.</p>
<p>Spent the remainder of the afternoon in examining these
splendid masses of primitive granite, and over-looking from the
top of Mulyeen the undulating and comparatively varied surface of
the country stretching to the east and north, dotted with
innumerable round bald rocks, though of small masses in
comparison with that of Mulyeen, and presenting altogether a more
rugose surface, and a more broken and uneven horizon than I have
seen elsewhere in the course of the Expedition.</p>
<p>After sundown, feeling a sort of craving for society&mdash;for
the solitude of the wilderness, like affliction, makes kindred of
us all; and Kowitch so much prefers the society of Harry (who
listens with open month to his well-coloured narrative of the
incidents of our journey, and especially to our gallant adventure
with the native woman, which the former is never tired of
relating) that I get little of his society now, he and I started
to try to find Mr Parker's shepherd. After a walk of 4 or 5 miles
by moonlight, we returned without attaining our object, the flock
being removed to some spot in the neighbourhood which we could
not discover.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 29.&mdash;Started at 10 a.m.,
without our native guide Harry, who, on the plea of being mendic.
(Kowitch told me that he suffered from rheumatic pains in the
feet,) declined to accompany us any further, and at two miles
passed Mr Parker's old sheep-station on the west side of Mulyeen,
and travelling along an old sandalwood track, unintentionally
passed Kubbine on our left, and at 6 p.m. camped at about 6 miles
on the west of that station; travelling distance 28 miles; having
ridden fast the greater part of the afternoon; the country
traversed consisting for the most part of very flat and slightly
inclined valleys abounding in sandalwood and jam trees, the soil
silicious and poor, but covered with a thin poor grass.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 30.&mdash;Started at 10 a.m. and
making across the bush about 6 miles in a S.S.W. direction, came
upon the Kubbine and Bunmull road, which we followed to the
latter place, where I hoped to find Mr Robinson and the remainder
of the party encamped.</p>
<p>Reached Bunmull at 3 p.m. and found that Mr Robinson had not
yet arrived. Travelling distance about 22 miles. It rained pretty
heavily all last night, and in torrents all this day, so that we
got thoroughly drenched, and found the road for miles knee-deep
in water; all the gullies running strongly strongly 2 feet
deep.</p>
<p><span class="aa">July</span> 31.&mdash;Slept in Mr Herbert's
house last night, he most kindly pressing me to do so, and the
saturated state of the ground not inviting us to sleep in the
tents.</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. Messrs. Robinson, Edwards, and Hall with the
horses, came up, having camped about one mile on the east side of
Mr Herbert's farm, and having experienced the same drenching rain
yesterday which Kowitch and myself had suffered. After a short
delay, we proceeded on our way to York, and about 3 p.m. reached
the house of Mr P. Parker in that town, from which, 85 days
before, we had taken our departure on the Expedition now
concluded.</p>
<p>The news of our arrival spread quickly through the small
population of the town, and we were surrounded both with friends
glad to see us back safe and well, and, as many of my friends
assured me individually, looking, stronger, healthier, and fatter
than I have done for 15 years past, and with others anxious to
hear an account of our adventures, and of the country which we
have traversed; and if my account of that has disappointed
extravagant expectations entertained by some, as on the other
hand I know it is too favorable to be fully accepted by others,
who can hope and believe no good thing in store for this colony,
we had the pleasure of meeting a warm and hearty reception from
all, and I have moreover the satisfaction of holding a confident
belief that, well within the life-time of many of the prompters
and members of this Expedition, a stream of wealth will flow into
the town and district of York, derived from the pastoral and
agricultural resources of the country which we have traversed and
of whose very peculiar physical features I have endeavoured to
convey to the reader correct conceptions, sufficient to raise
that town and district to a position inferior to that occupied by
no inland town or district of Australia, of which, as from the
physical causes which I have endeavoured to delineate must ever
be the case of York and of all the country traversed by the
Expedition, the prosperity may be based solely on agricultural
and pastoral resources.</p>

<p class="negindent3"><i>Narrative of an Exploring Expedition
into the Interior of Western Australia, Eastward of the District
of York</i>, Commanded by Henry Maxwell Lefroy, Esq.
(Superintendent of Convicts), from May to July, 1863.</p>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> object of the expedition was to
discover new districts suitable for sheep-farming, the outmost
station at present being Smith's, about three days' journey only
east of York. It was found that primeval granite was the chief
formation for full 6° east of York, occasionally fissured but
nowhere upheaved, except towards the western face of Darling
Range. This is covered in certain spots by sedimentary rocks,
nowhere more than 100 feet in thickness. The general effect of
the scenery consequent upon the (meridional) facture mentioned
above, is imposing, but their agricultural fertility is slight.
From the Avon eastward to the limit of the drainage basin (118°
30' <span class="uu">e</span>.) the country is flat, with
abundance of wide shallow valleys. Leaving Smith's Station the
country improves, the grass being good, with a sprinkling of
trees resembling the mimosa, and a species of dwarf pine. Animal
life is so scarce, that in 155 miles the party only saw four
kangaroos, three emus, and no natives; though they one day came
upon a recent track of a solitary individual. On the numerous
lakes passed, there were noticed only four ducks, and neither
cockatoos, turkeys, nor parrots. As they proceeded inland they
came upon a chain of lakes bordered by samphire plains, at
present 10 feet above the level of the stream, but probably less
in the rainy season. Beyond this a rise of 5 feet in the lake
waters would probably inundate a tract five miles wide. A careful
examination led to the conclusion that there had been no overflow
for many years, possibly for centuries, and that for several
winters the average depth of the water had not reached 2 feet.
Some fine cypresses were visible here. If grazed closely by
sheep, the young grass would be of the most nutritious quality,
the depth of the rich alluvial soil being 15 feet, as evidenced
by numerous natural surface-drains. Little or no wind was
experienced throughout.</p>

<p class="quote">The <span class="aa">President</span> said the
Paper had been curtailed with reference to the geological
phenomena of the region in question, which, as a geologist, he
almost regretted. The idea of the author seemed to be, that there
was a mass of granite here, the nucleus, as it were, of the
original formation of the globe, which had remained undisturbed
for many ages. It was a phenomenon which ought to be discussed in
the Geological Society. The Paper was one of merit, written by a
gentleman who had passed a period of twenty years in the colony,
and who had no doubt made accurate observations upon the country.
He had also brought forward clear proofs that there were in this
<span class="pagenum"><u>{Page 46}</u></span> region large tracts
of valuable alluvial land, which might be cultivated with great
profit to the colony.</p>
<p class="quote">General <span class="aa">Lefroy</span> said,
when his brother told us, with the experience of a settler of
more than twenty years in West Australia, that the region he had
been the first to explore contained an extent of valuable
agricultural and sheep-farming country unequalled in the colony,
it opened up some good news to those who were well-disposed
towards that unfortunate colony. His brother dwelt very strongly
upon this point, particularly upon the extraordinary richness of
the granite in those felspars which were the element of
agricultural fertility, wherever they were found. There was also
great interest in the view which he announced as to the
possibility of our having in this portion of the Australian
continent access to the primeval nucleus of our planet, the
primeval granite over which there has never been any great depth
of sedimentary deposit, which has never been disturbed by
fissures or disrupted by intrusive rocks, and which is nearly in
the condition in which our globe would have been originally if it
had been a granite sphere cooling gradually. Mr. Lefroy was
deeply impressed with the evidence presented in many directions
of the extreme antiquity of this region. We find in the
vegetation of Australia the living representatives of the most
ancient vegetation of the globe. It is the same with a portion of
its animal kingdom, and also with its representatives of the
human race. For example, the only native Australians met with by
the expedition was one female and her child, both in a state of
absolute nudity. The extraordinary sparseness of the human race,
and the very peculiar conditions under which they exist there,
point to a degree of primitive simplicity and antiquity which he
thought would be found of considerable interest hereafter..
Houseless through three-quarters of the year, perfectly naked in
all weathers, and distributed over the country at a rate probably
not exceeding one family to forty or fifty square miles, it is
difficult to conceive of human beings in a deeper state of
degradation. "Man," says Mr. Lefroy, in one of his letters, "is
here only another species of the mammalian fauna who has the
singular property of being both carnivorous and graminivorous,
and is as unconscious of traditions, laws, moral principles, and
social institutions as the scanty kangaroos or emus who share the
country with him." The language of this female was unintelligible
to the native from York who accompanied the party. No kindness
could overcome her terror, or induce her to accept what they
offered her. Having no personal acquaintance with Western
Australia, General Lefroy could not venture to say how far his
brother's anticipations of a beneficial change in the vegetation
of those great plains, to be brought about by cattle-feeding,
would be realized; but it would appear that a moderate
expenditure of labour would remove the curse of aridity by saving
the abundant water which is sent by heaven, but, in the singular
conformation of the surface, finds no valleys to drain it off, no
basins to collect it, and no depth of soil into which it can
subside. It seems to evaporate with the minimum of benefit to the
earth. The expedition had suffered much, both from the want of
this necessary and from the muddiness of what they could collect.
On one occasion they were 36 hours without it; but,
notwithstanding this, he was glad to say they lost only two or
three horses, and returned themselves all the better for their
hardships.</p>
