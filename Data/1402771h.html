<p>Production Notes:</p>
<p>Edgeworth David's account&mdash;a book within a book, namely
Chapters VI-XIII of Volume II of Ernest Shackleton's "Heart of
the Antarctic" [also in Project Gutenberg Australia]&mdash;is
here given an independent existence. The map is from the
<i>Geographical Journal</i> of the Royal Geographic Society.<br>
<br>
David, Deputy Leader of the British Antarctic Expedition of
1907-09, led the party which not only attained the Magnetic Pole
but also first ascended Mt Erebus. David gave no account of the
Erebus ascent, so no mention is made here. Several appendices,
co-authored by David or written by Mawson, are included to throw
light on the scientific roles of the exploration party
members.<br>
<br>
Although all the exploration recorded in "Heart" was carried out
under the auspices of the British Antarctic Expedition (1907-09),
the successes of David's party must have played a significant
part in initiating Australia's continuing role in the Antarctic,
from 1911 to the present, with Douglas Mawson as a parent.</p>

<p class="foot">[* To "Heart of the Antarctic" by E. H.
Shackleton, 1909; 2 vols.]</p>
<p><b>THE</b> scientific results of the expedition* cannot be
stated in detail in this book. The expert members in each branch
have contributed to the appendices articles which summarise what
has been done in the domains of geology, biology, magnetism,
meteorology, physics, &amp;c. I will simply indicate here some of
the more important features of the geographical work.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The British Antarctic Expedition of
1907-09.&mdash;<span class="aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>We passed the winter of 1908 in McMurdo Sound, twenty miles
north of the <i>Discovery</i> winter quarters. In the autumn a
party** ascended Mount Erebus and surveyed its various craters.
In the spring and summer of 1908-9 three sledging-parties left
winter quarters; one went south and attained the most southerly
latitude ever reached by man, another reached the South Magnetic
Pole** for the first time, and a third surveyed the mountain
ranges west of McMurdo Sound.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The same party of three, viz. David, Mackay
and Mawson. In the Erebus ascent, they were supported by Adams,
Marshall and Brocklehurst.&mdash;<span class="aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>The southern sledge-journey planted the Union Jack in latitude
88° 23' South, within one hundred geographical miles of the South
Pole. This party of four ascertained that a great chain of
mountains extends from the 82nd parallel, south of McMurdo Sound,
to the 86th parallel, trending in a south-easterly direction;
that other great mountain ranges continue to the south and
south-west, and that between them flows one of the largest
glaciers in the world, leading to an inland plateau, the height
of which, at latitude 88° South, is over 11,000 ft. above
sea-level. This plateau presumably continues beyond the
geographical South Pole, and extends from Cape Adare to the Pole.
The bearings and angles of the new southern mountains and of the
great glacier are shown on the chart, and are as nearly correct
as can be expected in view of the somewhat rough methods
necessarily employed in making the survey.</p>
<p>The mystery of the Great Ice Barrier has not been solved, and
it would seem that the question of its formation and extent
cannot be determined definitely until an expedition traces the
line of the mountains round its southerly edge. A certain amount
of light has been thrown on the construction of the Barrier, in
that we were able, from observations and measurements, to
conclude provisionally that it is composed mainly of snow. The
disappearance of Balloon Bight, owing to the breaking away of a
section of the Great Ice Barrier, shows that the Barrier still
continues its recession, which has been observed since the voyage
of Sir James Ross in 1842. There certainly appears to be a high
snow-covered land on the 163rd meridian, where we saw slopes and
peaks, entirely snow-covered, rising to a height of 800 ft., but
we did not see any bare rocks, and did not have an opportunity to
take soundings at this spot. We could not arrive at any definite
conclusion on the point.</p>
<p>The journey made by the Northern Party* resulted in the
attainment of the South Magnetic Pole, the position of which was
fixed, by observations made on the spot and in the neighbourhood,
at latitude 72° 25' South, longitude 155° 16' East. The first
part of this journey was made along the coastline of Victoria
Land, and many new peaks, glaciers and ice-tongues were
discovered, in addition to a couple of small islands. The whole
of the coast traversed was carefully triangulated, and the
existing map was corrected in several respects.</p>
<p class="foot">[* David, Mackay and Mawson are referred to
throughout "Heart" as "The Northern Party".&mdash;<span class=
"aa">Ed</span>.]</p>
<p>The survey of the western mountains by the Western Party added
to the information of the topographical details of that part of
Victoria Land, and threw some new light on its geology.</p>
<p>The discovery of forty-five miles of new coastline extending
from Cape North, first in a south-westerly and then in a westerly
direction, was another important piece of geographical work.</p>
<p>During the homeward voyage of the <i>Nimrod</i> a careful
search strengthened that prevalent idea that Emerald Island, the
Nimrod Islands and Dougherty Island do not exist, but I would not
advise their removal from the chart without further
investigation. There is a remote possibility that they lie at
some point in the neighbourhood of their charted positions, and
it is safer to have them charted until their non-existence has
been proved absolutely.</p>
<p>I should like to tender my warmest thanks to those generous
people who supported the expedition in its early days. Miss
Dawson Lambton and Miss E. Dawson Lambton made possible the first
steps towards the organisation of the expedition, and assisted
afterwards in every way that lay in their power. Mr. William
Beardmore (Parkhead, Glasgow), Mr. G. A. McLean Buckley (New
Zealand), Mr. Campbell McKellar (London), Mr. Sydney Lysaght
(Somerset), Mr. A. M. Fry (Bristol), Colonel Alexander Davis
(London), Mr. William Bell (Pendell Court, Surrey), Mr. H. H.
Bartlett (London), and other friends contributed liberally
towards the cost of the expedition. I wish also to thank the
people who guaranteed a large part of the necessary expenditure,
and the Imperial Government for the grant of £20,000, which
enabled me to redeem these guarantees. Sir James Mills, managing
director of the Union Steam Shipping Company of New Zealand, gave
very valuable assistance. The kindness and generosity of the
Governments and people of Australia and New Zealand will remain
one of the happiest memories of the expedition.</p>
<p>I am also indebted to the firms which presented supplies of
various sorts, and to the manufacturers who so readily assisted
in the matter of ensuring the highest quality and purity in our
foods.</p>
<p>As regards the production of this book, I am indebted to Dr.
Hugh Robert Mill for the introduction which he has written; to
Mr. Edward Saunders, of New Zealand, who not only acted as my
secretary in the writing of the book, but bore a great deal of
the labour, advised me on literary points and gave general
assistance that was invaluable; and to my publisher, Mr. William
Heinemann, for much help and many kindnesses.</p>
<p>I have to thank the members of the expedition who have
provided the scientific appendices. I should like to make special
mention of Professor T. W. Edgeworth David, who has told the
story of the Northern Journey, and Mr. George Marston, the artist
of the expedition, represented in this volume by the colour
plates, sketches and some diagrams.</p>
<p>I have drawn on the diaries of various members of the
expedition to supply information regarding events that occurred
while I was absent on journeys. The photographs with which these
volumes are illustrated have been selected from some thousands
taken by Brocklehurst, David, Davis, Day, Dunlop, Harbord, Joyce,
Mackintosh, Marshall, Mawson, Murray and Wild, secured often
under circumstances of exceptional difficulty.</p>
<p>In regard to the management of the affairs of the expedition
during my absence in the Antarctic, I would like to acknowledge
the work done for me by my brother-in-law, Mr. Herbert Dorman, of
London; by Mr. J. J. Kinsey, of Christchurch, New Zealand; and by
Mr. Alfred Reid, the manager of the expedition, whose work
throughout has been as arduous as it has been efficient.</p>
<p>Finally, let me say that to the members of the expedition,
whose work and enthusiasm have been the means of securing the
measure of success recorded in these pages, I owe a debt of
gratitude that I can hardly find words to express. I realise very
fully that without their faithful service and loyal co-operation
under conditions of extreme difficulty success in any branch of
our work would have been impossible.</p>

<br>
<p><b>ON</b> September 19, 1908, Lieutenant Shackleton gave me
his final instructions for the journey of the Northern Party to
the Magnetic Pole. These he read over to me in the presence of
Mawson and Dr. Mackay. The instructions were as follows:</p>
<p align="right"><small>"<span class="aa">British Antarctic
Expedition</span>, 1907.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
"<span class="aa">Cape Royds</span>, <i>September</i> 19,
1908.</small></p>
<h5><span class="aa">Instructions for Northern Sledge-party
under<br>
Command of Professor E. David</span>.</h5>
<p>"<span class="aa">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The sledge-party
which you have charge of consists of yourself, Douglas Mawson and
Alistair Mackay.</p>
<p>"You will leave winter quarters on or about October 1, 1908.
The main objects of your journey are to be as follows:</p>
<p>"(1) To take magnetic observations at every suitable point
with a view of determining the dip and the position of the
Magnetic Pole. If time permits, and your equipment and supplies
are sufficient, you will try and reach the Magnetic Pole.</p>
<p>"(2) To make a general geological survey of the coast of
Victoria Land. In connection with this work you will not
sacrifice the time that might be used to carry out the work noted
in paragraph (1). It is unnecessary for me to describe or
instruct you as to details <i>re</i> this work, as you know so
much better than I do what is requisite.</p>
<p>"(3) I particularly wish you to be able to work at the geology
of the Western Mountains, and for Mawson to spend at least one
fortnight at Dry Valley to prospect for minerals of economic
value on your return from the north, and for this work to be
carried out satisfactorily you should return to Dry Valley not
later than the first week of January. I do not wish to limit you
to an exact date for return to Dry Valley if you think that by
lengthening your stay up north you can reach the Magnetic Pole,
but you must not delay, if time is short, on your way south again
to do geological work. I consider that the <i>thorough</i>
investigation of Dry Valley is of supreme importance.</p>
<p>"(4) The <i>Nimrod</i> is expected in the Sound about January
15, 1909. It is quite possible you may see her from the west. If
so, you should try to attract attention by heliograph to winter
quarters. You should choose the hours noon to 1 <span class=
"uu"><span class="uu">p.m.</span></span> to flash your signal,
and if seen at winter quarters the return signal will be flashed
to you, and the <i>Nimrod</i> will steam across as far as
possible to meet you and wait at the ice-edge. If the ship is not
in, and if she is and your signals are not seen, you will take
into account your supply of provisions and proceed either to
Glacier Tongue or Hut Point to replenish if there is not a
sufficient amount of provision at Butter Point for you.</p>
<p>"(5) <i>Re</i> Butter Point. I will have a depôt of at least
fourteen days' food and oil cached there for you. If there is not
enough in that supply you ought to return as mentioned in
paragraph (4).</p>
<p>"(6) I shall leave instructions for the master of the
<i>Nimrod</i> to proceed to the most accessible point at the west
coast and there ship all your specimens. But before doing this,
he must ship all the stores that are lying at winter quarters,
and also keep in touch with the fast ice to the south on the
lookout for the Southern Sledge-party. The Southern Party will
not be expected before February 1, so if the ship arrives in good
time you may have all your work done before our arrival from the
south.</p>
<p>"(7) If by February 1 after the arrival of the <i>Nimrod</i>,
there is no evidence that your party has returned, the
<i>Nimrod</i> all proceed north along the coast, keeping as close
to the land as possible, on the lookout for a signal from you
flashed by heliograph. The vessel will proceed very slowly. The
ship will not go north of Cape Washington. This is a safeguard in
event of any accident occurring to your party.</p>
<p>"(8) I have acquainted both Mawson and Mackay with the main
facts of the proposed journey. In the event of any accident
happening to you, Mawson is to be in charge of the party.</p>
<p>"(9) Trusting that you will have a successful journey and a
safe return.</p>

Magnetic Pole, you will hoist the Union Jack on the spot, and
take possession of it on behalf of the above expedition for the
British nation.</p>
<p>"When you are in the Western Mountains, please do the same at
one place, taking possession of Victoria Land as part of the
British Empire.</p>
<p>"If economic minerals are found, take possession of the area
in the same way on my behalf as Commander of this expedition.</p>

<p>We had a farewell dinner that night, given in honour of the
Southern Depôt Party who were about to start to lay out a depôt
one hundred miles southerly from our winter quarters.</p>
<p>The following day, September 20, a strong south-easterly
blizzard was blowing. In the afternoon the wind somewhat
moderated, and there was less drift. Mackay had been making a
sail for our journey to the Magnetic Pole, and we now tried the
sail on two sledges lashed together on the ice at Backdoor Bay.
We used the tent poles of one of the sledging-tents as a mast.
The wind was blowing very strongly and carried off the two
sledges with a weight on them of 300 lb., in addition to the
weights of Mackay and myself, who were sitting on the sledges. We
considered this a successful experiment.</p>
<p>The weather continued bad till the night of the 24th.</p>
<p>On September 25 we were up at 5.30 <span class=
"uu"><span class="uu">a.m.</span></span>, and found that the
blizzard had subsided. Priestley, Day and I started in the
motor-car, dragging behind us two sledges over the sea ice. One
sledge, weighing altogether 606 lb. with its load, contained five
of our fortnightly food-bags, six large tins of biscuits, and 60
lb. of oil. The other sledge, which with its load weighed about
250 lb., carried personal gear which we might have to use on the
depôt laying trip in the event of being surprised by a blizzard.
At first Day travelled on his first gear; he then found that the
engine became heated, and we had to stop for it to cool down. He
discovered while we were waiting that one of the cylinders was
not firing. This he soon fixed up all right. He then remounted
the car and he put her on to the second gear. With the increased
power given by the repaired cylinder we now sped over the
floe-ice at fourteen miles an hour, much to the admiration of the
seals and penguins. When, however, we had travelled about ten
miles from winter quarters, and were some five miles westerly
from Tent Island, we encountered numerous sastrugi of softish
snow, the car continually sticking fast in the ridges. A little
low drift was flying over the ice surface, brought up by a gentle
blizzard. We left the heavy sledge ten miles out, and then with
only the light sledge to draw behind us, Day found that he was
able to travel on his third gear at eighteen miles an hour. At
this speed the sledge, whenever it took one of the snow sastrugi
at right angles, leapt into the air like a flying fish and came
down with a bump on the surface of the ice. As we had
occasionally to make sharp turns in order to avoid sastrugi and
lumps of ice, our sledge had one or two capsizes. Meanwhile, the
blizzard was freshening, and we tore along in hopes of reaching
our winter quarters before it became very violent. We had just
reached Flagstaff Point, and were taking a turn in towards the
shore opposite the penguin rookery when the blizzard wind caught
the side of the sledge nearly broadside on, and capsized it
heavily. So violent was the shock that the aluminium cooking
apparatus was knocked out of its straps, and the blizzard wind
immediately started trundling this metal cylinder over the smooth
ice. Day stopped his car as soon as possible, Priestley and I
jumped off, and immediately gave chase to the runaway cooker.
Meanwhile, the cooker had fallen to pieces so to speak; the tray
part came away from the big circular cover; the melter and the
supports for the cooking-pot and for the main outer covering also
came adrift as well as the cooking-pot itself. The lid of the
last-mentioned fell off, and immediately dumped on to the ice the
three pannikins and our three spoons. These articles raced one
another over the smooth ice-surface in the direction of the open
water of Ross Sea. The spoons were easily captured, as also were
the pannikins, which, being conical in shape, could not be bowled
by the wind in a straight line, but described arcs of circles.
Priestley and I recovered also the cooking-pot, and with
Brocklehurst's help (for he had run down to meet us) the
aluminium supports, but the large snow melter, the main outer
casing, and the tray kept revolving in front of us at a speed
which was just sufficient to outclass our own most desperate
efforts. Finally, when we were nearly upon them, they took a
joyous leap over the low cliff of floe-ice and disappeared one
after another most exasperatingly in the black waters of the Ross
Sea.</p>
<p>This was a shrewd loss, as aluminium cookers were, of course,
very scarce. Priestley and I returned disconsolate, and very much
winded after our mile's run in vain.</p>
<p>The following day we had intended laying out our second depôt,
but as some of the piston rings of the motor-car needed repair,
we decided to postpone the departure until the day after. That
afternoon, after the repairs had been completed, Day and Armytage
went out for a little tobogganing before dinner. Late in the
evening Armytage returned dragging slowly and painfully a sledge
bearing the recumbent, though not inanimate form of Day. We
crowded round to inquire what was the matter, and found that just
when Armytage and Day were urging their wild career down a steep
snow slope Day's foot had struck an unyielding block of kenyte
lava, and the consequence had been very awkward for the foot. It
was severely staved, so that he was quite unable to walk without
assistance. As no one but Day could be trusted to drive the
motor-car, this accident necessitated a further postponement of
the laying of our second depôt.</p>
<p>On September 28 it was blowing. On the 29th the day was fairly
fine, but Day's foot was not well enough for him to start in the
motor-car.</p>
<p>On September 30 a mild blizzard commenced blowing, and on
October 1, the day on which Lieutenant Shackleton had intended
that we should start, it was still raging with increased force.
That day was spent chiefly in nailing strips of tin, painted
blue, on all the geological specimen boxes, and double-labelling
them.</p>
<p>On October 2 the weather was still bad, so that we were unable
to start. On October 3, the weather having cleared. Day,
Priestley, Mackay and I started with two sledges to lay our
second depôt. All went well for about eight miles out, then the
carburetter played up. Possibly there was some dirt in the
nozzle. Day took it all to pieces in the cold wind, and spent
three-quarters of an hour in fixing it up. We then started off
again gaily in good style. We crossed a large crack in the sea
ice where there were numbers of seals and Emperor penguins. On
the other side of this crack our wheels stuck fast in snow
sastrugi. All hands got on to the spokes and started swinging the
car backwards and forwards; when we got a good swing on, Day
would suddenly snatch on the power and over we would
go&mdash;that is, over one of the sastrugi&mdash;only to find,
often, that we had just floundered into another one ahead. In
performing one of these evolutions Priestley, who as usual, was
working like a Trojan, got his hand rather badly damaged through
its being jammed between the spokes of the car wheel and the
framework. Almost immediately afterwards one of my fingers was
nearly broken, through the same cause, the flesh being torn off
one of my knuckles; and then Mackay seriously damaged his wrist
in manipulating what Joyce called the "thumb-breaking" starter.
Still we went floundering along over the sastrugi and ice cracks,
Day every now and then getting out to lighten the car and limping
alongside. At last we succeeded in reaching a spot amongst the
snow sastrugi on the sea ice, fifteen miles distant from our
winter quarters. Here we dumped the load intended for the
Northern Party, and then Day had a hard struggle to extricate the
car from the tangle of sastrugi and ice-cracks. At last, after
two capsizes of the sledges, we got back into camp at 10
<span class="uu"><span class="uu">p.m.</span></span>, all
thoroughly exhausted, all wounded and bandaged. Brocklehurst
carried Day on his back for about a quarter of a mile from where
we left the car up to our winter quarters. So thoroughly
exhausted were we, that we had to take a day's rest on October 4,
before making our final start.</p>

<p>October 4 was a Sunday, and after the morning service we took
the ponies out for exercise. In the evening the gramophone
discoursed appropriate music, such as "We parted on the Shore",
"I and my true love will never meet again by the bonnie, bonnie
banks of Loch Lomond", concluding with the universal favourite,
"Lead, Kindly Light".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mackay had his damaged wrist attended to, and I put
the question to him as to whether or not he was prepared to
undertake the long journey to the Magnetic Pole under the
circumstances. He said that he was quite ready, provided Mawson
and I did not object to his going with his wrist damaged and in a
sling. We raised no objection, and so the matter was settled. All
that night Mawson and I were occupied in writing final letters,
and packing little odds and ends.</p>
<p>The following morning, October 5, after an early breakfast, we
prepared for the final start. It was quite wonderful what a lot
of things had been forgotten until this last moment. The sledges
were dragged down, from our hut to the edge of the sea ice at the
Penguin Rookery, a distance of a little over a quarter of a mile.
Day was there with the motor-car, ready for the start. Every now
and then some one of the pilgrims would remember that he had left
something very important behind at the hut, and would go running
back for it. These odd belongings had to be tied with bits of
string on to the second sledge which we were going to take with
us on our northern journey, consequently, by degrees, this sledge
became hung over with boots, crampons, and all sorts of what Day
called "gadgets". Murray, Brocklehurst and Armytage came down on
the ice to bid us a final farewell. Brocklehurst took a
photograph of us just before we started, then Day, Priestley,
Roberts, Mackay, Mawson and I got aboard, some on the motor-car,
some on the sledges. Those remaining behind gave us three cheers,
Day turned on the power and away we went. A light wind was
blowing from the south-east at the time of our start, bringing a
little snow with it and another blizzard seemed impending.</p>
<p>After travelling a little over two miles, just beyond Cape
Barne, the snow had become so thick that the coastline was almost
entirely hidden from our view. Under these circumstances I did
not think it prudent to take the motor-car further, so Mackay,
Mawson and I bid adieu to our good friends. Strapping on our
harness we toggled on to the sledge rope, and with a one, two,
three, and away, pulled off into the thick falling snow, which in
a few minutes blotted out all view of the motor-car in our rear.
As we slowly trudged along the signs of an approaching blizzard
became more pronounced and we bore somewhat to our left so as to
have Inaccessible Island as a lee under which to run for shelter,
but after a time, as the threatened blizzard did not come up, we
slewed our sledge more to the right, away from Inaccessible
Island, heading up for our ten-mile depôt. At last, towards
evening Mackay sighted the black flag over the depôt about a mile
distant.</p>
<p>We reached the depôt about 7 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> and
got up our tent. A fairly strong wind was still blowing from the
south-east, raising low drift. We slept that night on the
floe-ice, with about three hundred fathoms of water under our
pillow.</p>
<p>The following morning, October 6, we started our relay work.
We dragged the Christmas Tree sledge on first, as we were
specially liable to lose parcels off it, for a distance of from
one-third to half a mile. Then we returned and fetched up what we
called the Plum Duff sledge, chiefly laden with our provisions.
The light was dull, and a certain amount of soft, newly-fallen
snow made the sledging heavy. The weather may be described as
thick, with snow falling at intervals. During the afternoon it
cleared somewhat and the Western Mountains came into view at
about 2 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> This was fortunate for us,
as it enabled us later on to sight the flag over our fifteen-mile
depôt. We camped that night amongst screw pack-ice within less
than a mile of this depôt.</p>
<p>The following day, October 7, was beautifully fine and calm.
We started about 9 <span class="uu"><span class=
"uu">a.m.</span></span> and sledged over pressure ice ridges and
snow sastrugi, reaching our fifteen-mile depôt in three-quarters
of an hour. Here we camped and repacked our sledges. We took the
wholemeal plasmon biscuits out of two of the biscuit tins and
packed them into canvas bags. This saved us a weight of about 8
lb.</p>
<p>We started again in the afternoon, relaying with the two
sledges. The sledging again was heavy on account of the fresh,
soft snow, and small sastrugi. We had a glorious view of the
Western Mountains, crimsoned in the light of the setting sun. We
camped that night close to a seal hole which belonged to a fine
specimen of Weddell seal. We were somewhat disturbed that night
by the snorting and whistling of the seals as they came up for
their blows. Evidently this seal hole was a syndicate affair. The
sounds at times seemed right under our tent.</p>
<p>October 8 was a fine, clear day, with a beautiful sunset, and
a magnificent mirage, in the direction of Beaufort Island. To the
north of us, the curious hills, called by Captain Scott the
"Stranded Moraines", were now beginning to show out very plainly
in the direction in which we were travelling.</p>
<p>On the morning of October 9 we got under way soon after eight
o'clock. It was a lovely, calm day but cold, the thermometer
registering 30 Fahr. at 8 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> The
surface was fairly good for sledging, but in places we came on
patches of soft snow, and a small, lumpy structure of the
ice-surface, resembling a newly raked garden bed, evidently due
to the thawing down and refreezing of "ice flowers". This made
travelling very heavy. The "Stranded Moraines" now showed up very
clearly, and Butter Point itself became visible.</p>
<p>The following day, Saturday, October 10, we were awakened by
the chatter of some Emperor penguins who had marched down on our
tent during the night to investigate us. The sounds may be
described as something between the cackle of a goose and the
chortle of a kookaburra. On peeping out of the Burberry spout of
our tent I saw four standing by the sledges. They were much
interested at the sight of me, and the conversation between them
became lively. They evidently took us for penguins of an inferior
type, and the tent for our nest. They watched, and took careful
note of all our doings, and gave us a good send-off when we
started about 8.30 <span class="uu"><span class=
"uu">a.m.</span></span></p>
<p>On our journey that morning we passed close by a large bull
seal of the Weddell species. A little further on we noticed a
curious dark object on the ice in the distance, and on coming up
to it found that it was a dead Weddell seal with its head, neck,
and shoulders firmly frozen into the ice. Evidently it had stuck
fast in a seal hole in the ice in trying to get down to the
sea-water.</p>

<p>The sky was overcast, and light snow began to fall in the
afternoon. A little later a mild blizzard sprang up from the
south-east; we thought this a favourable opportunity for testing
the sailing qualities of our sledges, and so made sail on the
Plum Duff sledge. As Mackay put it, we "brought her to try with
main course". As the strength of the blizzard increased, we found
that we could draw both sledges simultaneously, which was, of
course, a great saving in labour. We were tempted to carry on in
the increasing strength of the blizzard rather longer than was
wise, and consequently, when at last we decided that we must
camp, had great difficulty in getting the tent up. We slipped the
tent over the poles placed close to the ground in the lee of a
sledge. While two of us raised the poles, the third shovelled
snow on to the skirt of the tent, which we pulled out little by
little, until it was finally spread to its full dimensions. We
were glad to turn in and escape from the biting blast and
drifting snow.</p>
<p>The following day, Sunday, October 11, a violent blizzard was
still blowing, and we lay in our sleeping-bag until past noon, by
which time the snow had drifted high upon the door side of our
tent. As this drift was pressing heavily on our feet and cramping
us, I got up and dug it away. The cooker and Primus were then
brought in and we all got up and had some hoosh and tea. The
temperature, as usually happens in a blizzard, had now risen
considerably, being 8.5° Fahr. at 1.30 <span class=
"uu">p.m.</span> The copper wire on our sledges was polished and
burnished by the prolonged blast against it of tiny ice crystals,
and the surface of the sea ice was also brightly polished in
places. As it was still blowing we remained in our sleeping-bag
for the rest of that day as well as the succeeding night.</p>
<p>When we rose at about 2 <span class="uu"><span class=
"uu">a.m.</span></span> on Monday, October 12, the blizzard was
over. We found very heavy snowdrifts on the lee side of our
sledges, and it took us a considerable time to dig these away and
get the hard snow raked out of all the chinks and crannies among
the packages on the sledges. We made a start about 4 <span class=
"uu"><span class="uu">a.m.</span></span>, and all that day
meandered amongst broken pack-ice. It was evident that the
south-east blizzards drive large belts of broken floe-ice in this
direction across McMurdo Sound to the western shore. The
fractured masses of sea ice, inclined at all angles to the
horizontal, are frozen in later, as the cold of winter becomes
more intense, and of course, constitute a very difficult surface
for sledging.</p>
<p>In order to make up for the time we had lost in our
sleeping-bags during the blizzard, we travelled altogether
fourteen hours, and succeeded in doing about six statute miles,
that is, eighteen miles of relay work, and all felt much
exhausted when we turned in that evening. As a result of this we
did not wake until after 8 a.m next morning.</p>
<p>We were now only about two miles from Butter Point. We got
under way at 10 <span class="uu"><span class=
"uu">a.m.</span></span>, and a few hours later camped at the foot
of a low ice cliff, about 600 yards south-south-east of Butter
Point. Butter Point is merely an angle in this low ice cliff near
the junction of the Ferrar Glacier valley with the main shore of
Victoria Land. This cliff was from fifteen to twenty feet in
height, and formed of crevassed glacier ice. It was covered by a
hard snow crust, which every now and then gave away and let one
down for a foot or so. This glacier ice was not part of the main
Ferrar Glacier, but appeared to be simply a local piedmont
glacier stretching along for some considerable distance between
the base of the coast range and the sea ice, past the "Stranded
Moraines", until still further south it became confluent with
that Mr. H. G. Ferrar has described as the "pinnacled ice". It
was evident that this piedmont ice was firmly attached to the
land, as it was separated from the sea ice, by a well-marked
tide-crack. With the help of our ice axes we crossed over this
crack and got up the little ice cliff on to the glacier ice, and
selected there a suitable spot for our depôt.</p>
<p>According to arrangements with Lieutenant Shackleton we were
to leave a depôt flag at Butter Point with a letter giving an
account of our doings, and stating approximately by what date we
hoped to return there. But the progress of our journey had been
so much slower than we had originally anticipated that we decided
before reaching Butter Point that it would be imperatively
necessary, in order to make the Magnetic Pole in the time
available, to lighten the load on our sledges by leaving a
portion of our equipment and food.</p>
<p>During the latter part of this day Mawson and Mackay were busy
making a mast and boom for the second sledge, it being our
intention to use the tent floorcloth as a sail. Meanwhile I
sorted out the material to be left at the depôt.</p>
<p>The following day, Wednesday, October 14, we spent the morning
in resorting the loads on our sledges. We depôted two tins of
wholemeal plasmon biscuits, each weighing about 27 lb., also
Mackay's mountaineering nail boots, and my spare headgear
material and mits. Altogether we lightened the load by about 70
lb. We sunk the two full tins of biscuits and a tin containing
boots, &amp;c., a short distance in the glacier ice to prevent
the blizzards blowing them away. We then lashed to the tins a
short bamboo flagpole, carrying one of our black depôt flags, and
securely fastened to its base one of our empty airtight milk
tins, in which we])laced our letters. In these letters for
Lieutenant Shackleton and R. E. Priestley, respectively, I stated
that in consequence of our late start from Cape Royds, and also
on account of the comparative slowness of our progress thence to
Butter Point, it was obvious that we could not return to Butter
Point until January 12, at the earliest, instead of the first
week of January, as was originally anticipated. We ascertained
months later that this little depôt survived the blizzards, and
that Armytage, Priestley and Brocklehurst had no difficulty in
finding it, and that they read our letters.</p>
<p>Leaving the depôt about 9 <span class="uu"><span class=
"uu">a.m.</span></span> on October 14, we started sledging across
New Harbour in the direction of Cape Bernacchi. In the afternoon
a light southerly wind sprang up bringing a little snow with it,
the fall lasting from about 12.30 to 2.30 <span class=
"uu">p.m.</span> We steered in the direction of what appeared to
us to be an uncharted island. On arriving at it, however, we
discovered that it was a time iceberg, formed of hard blue
glacier ice with a conspicuous black band near its summit formed
of fine dark gravel. The iceberg was about a quarter of a mile in
length, and thirty to forty feet high. In addition to the coarser
bands of gravel there was a great quantity of dust, and fine dust
bands, near the surface of the berg. This dust absorbing the heat
of the sun had thawed its way deep down into the berg, thus
forming numerous dust wells and dust grooves. There were several
large cracks in the sea ice in the neighbourhood of this iceberg,
and having taken the bearing of the trend of these by a compass
they helped us to keep direction when the air was thick 'with
falling snow.</p>
<p>The following day, October 15, was beautifully fine and calm;
the sky was slightly cloudy with long belts of cirrus-stratus and
alto-stratus. Erebus, now over fifty miles distant, was cloud
capped. We had a glorious view up the magnificent valley of the
Ferrar Glacier; the spurless hills on either side of the valley,
strongly faceted in a direction parallel to each side of the
valley, spoke eloquently of intense abrasive glacial action in
the immediate geological past. The hills in the foreground,
formed of gneissic granite, were of a rich chocolate brown to
warm sepia hue, fading in the distance to exquisite tints of
reddish purple and violet. Towards evening we had a wonderful
vision of several large icebergs close ahead of us; it seemed as
though they were only a mile or so distant, as one could see
clearly the re-entering angles and bright reflected sides of the
bergs lit up in the rays of the setting sun. Suddenly, as if by
magic, they all vanished. They had been momentarily conjured up
to our view by a wonderful mirage. In the departing rays of the
setting sun Mount Erebus and Mount Bird glowed with a glorious
golden light. This was one of the most beautiful days we
experienced during the whole of our journey. The cold was now
less severe than it had been, the temperature being 9.5° Fahr. at
8 <span class="uu">p.m.</span></p>

<br>
<p><b>ON</b> October 16 we were up at 3.30 <span class=
"uu"><span class="uu">a.m.</span></span>, and got under way at
5.30. A cold wind was blowing from the south, and after some
trouble we set sail on both sledges, using the green floorcloth
on the Christmas Tree sledge, and Mackay's sail on the Plum Duff
sledge. A short time after we set sail it fell nearly calm; thick
clouds gathered; a light wind sprang up from the south-east,
veering to east-north-cast, then back again to south-east in the
afternoon. Fine snow fell for about three hours, forming a layer
nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness. Towards evening we
reached one of the bergs that had been miraged up the night
before. It was four hundred yards long, and eighty yards wide,
and was a true iceberg formed of glacier ice; Mackay, Mawson and
I explored this. Like the previous iceberg its surface was pitted
with numerous deep dust wells. It was wonderful to see what a
very small amount of dust sufficed to dig these wells to a depth
of several feet. The cliff of the berg which faced towards the
north-west was deeply grooved, the appearance in the distance
reminding one of a number of large parallel stalactites. Climbing
up one of these deep grooves I found numbers of small angular
rock pebbles, up to one and a half inches in diameter, adhering
to the bottom of the groove, and it seemed as though these
grooves, like the dust wells, were formed by the warmth of these
small fragments of rock which, as the process of thawing of the
ice cliff progressed, gradually settled down into long rows or
strings as they crept gradually downwards under the influence of
gravitation to the level of the sea ice below. As the shore was
high and rocky, and seemed not more than half a mile distant, I
went over towards it after our evening meal. It proved to be
somewhat further than it appeared.</p>
<p>On the way, for the first time, I met with a structure in the
sea ice known as pancake ice. The surface of the ice showed a
rounded polygonal structure something like the tops of a number
of large weathered basaltic columns. The edges of these polygons
were slightly raised, but sufficiently rounded off by thawing or
ablation to afford an easy surface for the runners of our sledge.
Later on, in the autumn of the following year, we noticed this
pancake ice in process of formation. If, as was often the case,
there was any wind when the sea began to freeze over, the water
at first commenced to look soupy; little by little the small ice
particles which caused this appearance aggregated and formed
myriads of small structures which may be likened to small open
jam tarts. These would then coalesce in groups at their edges and
form pancake ice. These pancakes were from one foot up to about
three feet in diameter. Later, the pancakes would cohere and so a
continuous hard ice crust would be formed over the sea surface;
later freezing simply had the effect of strengthening and
thickening this ice-sheet from below. Close in shore the pancake
ice was traversed by deep tidal cracks. After climbing over these
I reached the shore, which was composed of a well-marked terrace
of coarse gravel and large and small erratic boulders. The
smaller rock fragments were from three to six inches in diameter,
the boulders being as much as five feet in diameter. The lower
terrace was about twenty yards wide and as many feet in height
above the sea; then followed a belt of coarsely crystalline white
marble traversed by bands of grey gneiss and blackish rock.
Capping this belt of ancient crystalline rocks was a terrace of
angular gravel, from eighty to one hundred feet above sea-level,
formed of small rock fragments from one to two inches in
diameter. The belts of coarse marble, gneiss, &amp;c., were
stained green and reddish to ochreous brown in places, and
appeared to have been much mineralised. The whole area seemed to
promise well for economic minerals. One curious boulder specially
attracted my attention; its large pinkish crystals were peppered
over with small black crystals, the whole being enclosed in a
greenish black base. A specimen of this boulder which we brought
back with us will be described in detail in the geological
notes.</p>
<p>On Saturday, October 17, Mawson, Mackay and I landed at Cape
Bernacchi, a little over a mile north of our previous camp. Here
we hoisted the Union Jack just before 10 <span class=
"uu"><span class="uu">a.m.</span></span> and took possession of
Victoria Land for the British Empire. Cape Bernacchi is a low
rocky promontory, the geology of which is extremely interesting.
The dominant type of rock is a pure white coarsely crystalline
marble; this has been broken through by granite rocks, the latter
in places containing small red garnets. The marble or talc schist
contains graphite disseminated through it in small scales. A
great deal of tourmaline and epidote are developed in the granite
at its point of contact with the calcareous schists. It appeared
that the granite had intruded the black tourmaline rocks.</p>

<p>After taking possession we resumed our sledging, finding the
surface of pancake ice very good. The day being calm and clear
and free from either falling or drifting snow, we were able, for
the first time, to turn our sleeping-bag inside out and air it in
the sun. Previous to this the reindeer fur inside the bag had
become much encrusted with ice, chiefly the result of the
freezing of our breath. Although the heat of the sun was
insufficient to actually thaw the ice it evaporated it to a
considerable extent, and we found the bag that night much more
comfortable to sleep in than it had been for many nights
previous.</p>
<p>The following day, one and a quarter miles north of our
preceding camp, we reached an interesting rocky headland. Here we
found a mother seal with a newly born baby seal, the latter about
three and a half feet in length. The mother seal at short
intervals made a sound like "Wa-a-a". After a close inspection
the mother and baby were left undisturbed, and we turned our
attention to the rocks. These were most interesting, bearing a
general resemblance to those at Cape Bernacchi. Some of the
quartz veins traversing this point Mawson thought very favourable
for gold.</p>
<p>When we left this point the wind had considerably freshened.
We had previously hoisted sail on both sledges, and the wind was
now sufficiently strong to admit of our pulling both sledges
together. The total distance travelled was seven statute miles.
This was the most favourable wind we experienced during the whole
of our journey to and from the Magnetic Pole.</p>
<p>Shortly after leaving Baby Seal Point we encountered heavy
belts of screw pack-ice with high sastrugi between. The Christmas
Tree sledge capsized badly when being dragged over one of these
high snow ridges. We were much exhausted when we camped that
night and had suffered somewhat from the cold wind, the
temperature being about 10° Fahr.</p>
<p>That night I experienced a rather bad attack of
snow-blindness, through neglecting to wear my snow goggles
regularly. Finding that my eyes were no better next morning, and
my sight being dim, I asked Mawson to take my place at the end of
the long rope, the foremost position in the team. Mawson proved
himself on this occasion and afterwards so remarkably efficient
at picking out the best track for our sledges, and steering a
good course that by my request he occupied this position
throughout the rest of the journey.</p>
<p>The next two days were uneventful, except for the fact that we
occasionally had extremely heavy sledging over screw pack-ice and
high and long sastrugi. The latter were from two to three feet
high, bounded frequently by almost perpendicular sides, and as
they trended from west to east and our course was from south to
north they proved formidable obstacles to our progress, and
capsizes of the sledges were frequent.</p>
<p>On the night of October 20, we camped on the sea ice about
three-quarters of a mile off shore. To the north-east of us was
an outward curve of the shoreline, shown as a promontory on the
existing chart. Early the next morning I walked over to the shore
to geologise, and found the rocky headland composed of curious
gneissic granite veined with quartz. On ascending this headland I
noticed to my surprise that what had been previously supposed to
be a promontory was really an island separated by a narrow strait
from the mainland. It was clear that by going through this strait
we would save several miles. Accordingly, after breakfast we
sledged into the strait. The western side of the strait was
formed of glacier ice terminating eastward in an almost
precipitous slope. Here and there masses of gneissic granite
showed from beneath the ice. The eastern side of the strait was
formed of terraced moraine gravels with large erratics embedded
in the gravel of the top terrace, eighty feet above
sea-level.</p>
<p>While Mawson determined the position of this island by taking
a round of angles with the theodolite, Mackay and I crossed the
strait and explored the island, pacing and taking levels. The
rocks of which the erratics and boulder-bearing gravels were
formed were almost without exception of igneous origin. One very
interesting exception was a block of weathered clayey limestone.
This was soft and yellowish grey externally but hard and blue on
the freshly fractured surfaces inside. It contained traces of
small fossils which appeared to be seeds of plants. Specimens of
these were taken by us and were depôted later at another small
island, which we called Depôt Island. It is much to be regretted
that we were unable later to reach this depôt on account of dense
belts of pack-ice, and so these very interesting specimens were
lost. Two chips, however, of this rock were fortunately
preserved, sufficient for chemical analysis and microscopic
examination. There could be little doubt that this clayey
limestone has been derived from the great sedimentary formation,
named by H. T. Ferrar, the Beacon Sandstone.</p>
<p>The island which we had been exploring we named provisionally
Terrace Island. It was approximately triangular in shape, and the
side facing the strait, down which we travelled, measured one
mile 1200 yards in length.</p>
<p>The following day, October 22, we sighted the first skua gull
we had seen that season. Snow fell in the afternoon between 2.30
and 5 <span class="uu">p.m.</span>, forming a layer
three-quarters of an inch deep. The temperature rose to plus 6.5°
Fahr. at 7 <span class="uu">p.m.</span>, and a blizzard seemed
impending.</p>
<p>The following day October 23, we held a serious council as to
the future of our journey towards the Magnetic Pole, It was quite
obvious that at our present rate of travelling, about four
statute miles daily by the relay method, we could not get to the
Pole and return to Butter Point early in January. I suggested
that the most likely means of getting to the Pole and back in the
time specified by Lieutenant Shackleton would be to travel on
half rations, depôting the remainder of our provisions at an
early opportunity. They both agreed, after some discussion, to
try this expedient, and we decided to think the matter over for a
few days and then make our depôt.</p>
<p>We found, as the result of the fall of snow on the preceding
day, that the runners of our sledge clogged, making it difficult
to start the sledge after each halt. The temperature at 5
<span class="uu">p.m.</span> was now as high as plus 5° Fahr.
There were numerous seals, mostly mother seals with young ones,
on the ice near the course of our sledge, as many as seventeen
seals being sometimes visible simultaneously.</p>
<p>The previous day we had observed a mother seal with twin baby
seals. Mackay took up one of these in his arms and stroked it
while it was nuzzling round. It somewhat resembled a large
lizard. The mother snorted at him indignantly, meanwhile, but
made no attempt to attack him.</p>
<p>We encountered some large cracks in the sea ice. The sea water
between the opposite walls had been only recently frozen over so
that the ice was not more than a few inches in thickness. One of
these was eighteen feet wide, and we found that the ice bent
under our weight when we tested it primarily. Mackay called it
"The Bridge of the Beresina." We rushed the sledges over at a
good speed, and although the ice bent under their weight it
fortunately held. At about 3 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> the
weather grew very thick and it began to snow; a mild blizzard
developing later, we hoisted sail on both sledges.</p>
<p>The next day, October 24, we found it very warm in the
sleeping-bag, the sky being thickly overcast with dense stratus
cloud. A strong water sky showed up to the east of us, while over
the mountains to the west it was moderately clear. The presence
of this water sky, indicating open sea, warned us that it was
unsafe to stand out far from the land. We reached that evening a
long rocky point of gneissic granite, which we called Gneiss
Point. After our evening hoosh we walked across to the point and
collected a number of interesting geological specimens, including
blocks of kenyte lava.</p>
<p>The following day, October 25, proved a very heavy day for
sledging, as we had to drag the sledges over new snow from three
to four inches deep. In places it had a tough top crust which we
would break through up to our ankles. We met also several
obstacles in the way of wide cracks in the sea ice, from six to
ten feet in width, and several miles in length. The sea water
between the walls of the cracks had only recently been frozen
over, so that the ice was only just thick enough to bear the
sledges. The vicinity of these great ice-cracks were perfect baby
farms for young seals. It was a pretty sight to see one of these
baby seals playing with its mother, whom it kept gently flicking
over the nose with its small flippers, the mother every now and
then gently boxing the baby's ear with one of her large flippers.
One of these mothers charged down on Mackay, who was making an
inspection of her baby at too close quarters to suit her fancy.
Another mother was moaning in great distress over her baby, which
had just died. Evidently the mother seal's affection for her
young is very strong.</p>
<p>In pursuing our north-westerly course we were now crossing a
magnificent bay which trended westwards some five or six miles
away from the course we were steering. On either side of this bay
were majestic ranges of rocky mountains parted from one another
at the head of the bay by an immense glacier with steep ice
falls. On examining these mountains with a field-glass it was
evident that in their lower portions they were formed of granites
and gneiss, producing reddish brown soils. At the higher levels,
further inland, there were distinct traces of rocks showing
horizontal stratification. The highest rock of all was black in
colour, and evidently very hard, apparently some three hundred
feet in thickness. Below this was some softer stratified
formation, approximately one thousand feet in thickness. We
concluded that the hard top layer was composed of igneous rock,
possibly a lava, while the horizontal stratified formation
belonged in all probability to the Beacon Sandstone formation.
Some fine nunataks of dark rock rose from the south-east side of
the great glacier. On either side of this glacier were high
terraces of rock reaching back for several miles from a modern
valley edge to the foot of still higher ranges. It was obvious
that these terraces marked the position of the floor of the old
valley at a time when the glacier ice was several thousand feet
higher than it is now, and some ten miles wider than at present.
The glacier trended inland in a general south-westerly
direction.</p>
<p>We longed to turn our sledges shorewards and explore these
inland rocks, but this would have involved a delay of several
days&mdash;probably a week at least&mdash;and we could not afford
the time. Mawson took a series of horizontal and vertical angles
with the theodolite to all the upper peaks in these ranges. We
were much puzzled to determine on what part of the charted coast
this wide bay and great glacier valley was situated. We
speculated as to whether it was Granite Harbour, but decided that
it could not be in view of the distance recorded by our sledge
meter, for, according to this, we must still be some twenty miles
south of Granite Harbour proper. We were to find out much later
that the point opposite which we had now arrived was in reality
Granite Harbour, and that its position was not shown correctly on
the chart. Of course in pioneering work occasional mistakes such
as these are inevitable.</p>
<p>The following day the sledge still proved very heavy on
account of the soft snow&mdash;two to four inches
deep&mdash;which was continually clogging the runners of our
sledges. It was also difficult to steer a good course amongst the
hummocky pack-ice on account of the day being dull and overcast.
There was much low stratus cloud, and a light south-easterly
wind.</p>
<p>The weather of October 27 was beautifully clear and sunshiny,
and we had a glorious view of the great mountain ranges on either
side of Granite Harbour. The rich colouring of warm sepia brown
and terra cotta in these rocky hills was quite a relief to the
eye. Wind springing up in the south-east we made sail on both
sledges, and this helped us a good deal over the soft snow and
occasional patches of sharp-edged brash ice. Occasionally the
runners of our sledge would catch on one of these sharp
fragments, and there would be a harsh rasping sound as a shaving
was peeled off the runner. We feared that the wind would develop
into a true blizzard, but it proved to be only what Joyce used to
call a "carpet sweeper", driving along the newly fallen snow in
white gossamer-like films over the sea ice.</p>
<p>Towards evening we fetched up against some high ice-pressure
cracks with the ice ridged up six to eight feet high in huge
tumbled blocks. We seemed to have got into a labyrinth of these
pressure ridges from which there was no outlet. At last, after
several capsizes of the sledges and some chopping through the ice
ridges by Mackay, we got the sledges through, and camped on a
level piece of ice. We were much helped in crossing the ridges by
the long steep sastrugi of hardened snow. In places these ran
like ramps up to the top of the pressure ridges, and were just
wide enough and strong enough to bear our sledges. Mawson and I
at this time were still wearing finnesko, while Mackay had taken
to ski boots.</p>
<p>The following day, October 28, the sledging was again very
heavy over sticky soft snow alternating with hard sastrugi and
patches of consolidated brash ice. Shavings of wood were being
constantly rasped off the runners of our sledges. Mackay lost one
of his finnesko off the sledge, but walked back a couple of miles
in the evening and recovered it. Our course had taken us past a
number of snowbergs; these were mostly about forty feet in height
and from a quarter to half a mile in length. They were rigidly
embedded in the sea ice. Occasionally we met with a true iceberg
of blue ice amongst the snowbergs.</p>
<p>After our evening hoosh, Mawson and I went over to the shore,
rather more than half a mile distant, in order to study the
rocks. These we found were composed of coarse red granite; the
top of the granite was much smoothed by glacier ice, and strewn
with large erratic blocks. In places the granite was intersected
by black dykes of basic rocks. One could see that the glacier
ice, about a quarter of a mile inland from this rocky shore, had
only recently retreated and laid bare the glaciated rocky
surface. We found a little moss here amongst the crevices in the
granite rock.</p>
<p>October 29 was beautifully fine, though a keen and fresh wind,
rather unpleasantly cold, was blowing from off the high mountain
plateau to our west. It blew from a direction west by south and
caused a little low drift in the loose snow on the surface of the
sea ice. There was still a great deal of deep, soft snow
alternating with hard sastrugi and small patches of consolidated
brash ice, so that the sledging was very heavy.</p>
<p>We were all thoroughly done up at night after completing our
four miles of relay work. That evening we discussed the important
question of whether it would be possible to eke out our
food-supplies with seal meat so as to avoid putting ourselves on
half rations, and we all agreed that this should be done. We made
up our minds that at the first convenient spot we would make a
depôt of any articles of equipment, geological specimens,
&amp;c., in order to lighten our sledges, and would at the same
time, if the spot was suitable, make some experiments with seal
meat. The chief problem in connection with the latter was how to
cook it without the aid of paraffin oil. We could not afford more
paraffin for this purpose, as we estimated that even with the
utmost care the supply for our Primus, which we used for brewing
tea, cocoa and hoosh, would become exhausted before we could hope
to reach the Magnetic Pole, unless some kind of substitute for
paraffin could be found.</p>
<p>The following day, October 30, was full of interest for us, as
well as hard work. In the early morning, between 2.30
<span class="uu"><span class="uu">a.m.</span></span> and 6.30
<span class="uu"><span class="uu">a.m.</span></span>, a mild
blizzard was blowing. We got under way a little later and camped
at about 10.30 <span class="uu"><span class=
"uu">a.m.</span></span> for lunch alongside a very interesting
rocky point. Mawson got a good set of theodolite angles from the
top of this point. The point was formed of coarse porphyritic
grey gneiss, traversed by black dykes of rock, apparently
tinguaite, and another variety containing an abundance of
sparkling black crystals of hornblende, which may be termed
provisionally a hornblende lamprophyre.</p>
<p>After lunch we passed close by a mother seal and her baby. The
mother charged us and we had to skid along quick and lively past
her with the sledges. That day was the first occasion that we
tried the experiment of strengthening the brew of the tea by
using the old tea-leaves of a previous meal mixed with the new
ones. This was Mackay's idea, and Mawson and I at the time did
not appreciate the experiment. Later on, however, we were very
glad to adopt it.</p>
<p>The sledging that afternoon was about the heaviest we had
experienced up to date. The weather was now daily becoming warmer
and the saline snow on the sea ice became sticky in consequence.
It gripped the runners of the sledges like glue, and we were only
able with our greatest efforts to drag the sledges over this at a
snail's pace. We were all thoroughly exhausted that evening when
we camped at the base of a rocky promontory about 180 ft. high.
This cliff was formed of coarse gneiss, with numerous dark
streaks, and enclosures of huge masses of greenish-grey
quartzite.</p>
<p>After our evening hoosh we walked over to a very interesting
small island about three-quarters of a mile distant. It was truly
a most wonderful place geologically, and was a perfect elysium
for the mineralogist. The island, which we afterwards called
Depôt Island, was accessible on the shoreward side, but rose
perpendicularly to a height of 200 ft. above sea-level on the
other three sides. There was very little snow or ice upon it, the
surface being almost entirely formed of gneissic granite. This
granite, as shown in the photograph, was full of dark enclosures
of basic rocks, rich in black mica and huge crystals of
hornblende. It was in these enclosures that Mawson discovered a
translucent brown mineral, which he believed to be monazite, but
which has since proved to be titanium mineral. Patches of a
crystalline, milky-white mineral were to be seen amongst the
large platy crystals of dark green hornblende. These white
crystals we thought might be scapolite. We returned to camp and
slept soundly after the severe work of the day.</p>

<p>We were up at 6 <span class="uu"><span class=
"uu">a.m.</span></span> next morning, and after breakfast Mackay
and Mawson went in pursuit of some seals which we had sighted
further back on the previous day, while I climbed up an adjacent
granite slope with the field-glasses, watching for a signal from
them, if they were successful in their hunting, to bring up an
empty sledge. They were, however, unsuccessful in their quest,
and after some time returned to camp.</p>
<p>We packed up and made for the island at 9.30 <span class=
"uu"><span class="uu">a.m.</span></span> The sledging was
extremely heavy and we fell into a tide-crack on the way, but the
sledge was got over safely. Mackay sighted a seal about six
hundred yards distant from the site of our new camp near the
island, and just then we noticed that another seal had bobbed up
in the tide-crack close to our old camp. Mackay and Mawson at
once started off in the direction where the first seal had been
sighted. It proved to be a bull seal in very good condition, and
they killed it by knocking it on the head with an ice-axe.
Meanwhile, I unpacked the Duff sledge and took it out to them.
Returning to the site of our camp I put up the tent, and on going
back to Mawson and Mackay found that they had finished fletching
the seal. We loaded up the empty sledge with seal blubber,
resembling bars of soap in its now frozen condition, steak and
liver, and returned to camp for lunch.</p>
<p>After lunch we took some blubber and seal meat on to the
island, intending to try the experiment of making a blubber fire
in order to cook the meat. We worked our way a short distance up
a steep, rocky gulley, and there built a fireplace out of
magnificent specimens of hornblende rock. It seemed a base use
for such magnificent mineralogical specimens, but necessity knows
no laws. We had brought with us our Primus lamp in order to start
the fire. We put blubber on our iron shovel, warmed this
underneath by means of the heat of the Primus lamp so as to
render down the oil from it, and then lit the oil. The experiment
was not altogether successful. Mawson cooked for about three
hours, closely and anxiously watched by Mackay and myself.
Occasionally he allowed us to taste small snacks of the partly
cooked seal meat, which Mere pronounced to be delicious.</p>
<p>While the experiment was at its most critical stage, at about
6 <span class="uu">p.m.</span>, we observed sudden swirls of
snowdrift high up on the western mountains, coming rapidly down
to lower levels. For a few minutes we did not think seriously of
the phenomenon, but as the drift came nearer we saw that
something serious was in the air. Mackay and I rushed down to our
tent, the skirt of which was only temporarily secured with light
blocks of snow. We reached it just as it was struck by the sudden
blizzard which had descended from the western mountains. There
was no time to dig further blocks of snow, all we could do was to
seize the heavy food-bags on our sledges, weighing sixty pounds
each, and rush them on to the skirt of the tent. The blizzard
struck our kitchen on the island simultaneously with our tent,
and temporarily Mawson lost his mits and most of the tit-bits of
seal meat, but these were quickly recovered, and he came rushing
down to join us in securing the tent. While Mawson in frantic
haste chopped out blocks of snow and dumped them on to the skirt
of the tent, Mackay, no less frantically, struggled with our
sleeping-bag, which had been turned inside-out to air, and which
by this time was covered with drift snow. He quickly had it
turned right side in again, and dashed it inside the tent. At
last everything was secured, and we found ourselves safe and
sound inside the tent. The Primus was quickly got going, and soon
we had some hot cocoa and hot seal pottage, together with some
small pieces of charred but delicious seal blubber. The blizzard
continued until past our bedtime. We turned in with a
determination of making further experiments on the cooking of
seal meat on the following morning.</p>
<p>The following day, November 1, we breakfasted off a mixture of
our ordinary hoosh and seal meat. After some discussion we
decided that our only hope of reaching the Magnetic Pole lay in
our travelling on half rations from our present camp to the point
on the coast at the Drygalski Glacier, where we might for the
first time hope to be able to turn inland with reasonable
prospect of reaching the Magnetic Pole. Mawson was emphatic that
we must conserve six weeks of full rations for our inland journey
to and from the Pole. This necessitated our going on half rations
from this island to the far side of the Drygalski Glacier, a
distance of about one hundred statute miles. In order to
supplement the regular half rations we intended to take seal
meat.</p>
<p>While I was busy in calculating the times and distances for
the remainder of our journey, and proportioning the food rations
to suit our new programme, Mawson and Mackay conducted further
experiments on the cooking of seal meat with blubber. While at
our whiter quarters, Mackay had made some experiments on the use
of blubber as a fuel. He had constructed a blubber lamp, the wick
of which kept alight for several hours at a time, feeding itself
on the seal oil, he had tried the experiment of heating up water
over this blubber lamp, and was partly successful at the time
when we left winter quarters for our present sledging journey.
But his experiments at the time were not taken very seriously,
and the blubber lamp was left behind, a fact which we now much
regretted. An effective cooking-stove was, however, evolved, as
the result of a series of experiments this day, out of one of our
large empty biscuit tins. The lid of this was perforated with a
number of circular holes for the reception of wicks. Its edges
were bent down, so as to form supports to keep the wick-holder
about half an inch above the bottom of the biscuit tin. The
wick-holder was put in place; wicks were made of pieces of old
calico food-bags rolled in seal blubber, or with thin slices of
seal blubber enfolded in them, the calico being done up in little
rolls for the purpose of making wicks, as one rolls a cigarette,
the seal blubber taking the place of the tobacco in this case.
Lumps of blubber were laid round the wick-holder. Then, after
some difficulty, the wicks were lighted. They burned feebly at
first, as seal blubber has a good deal of water in it. After some
minutes of fitful spluttering, the wicks got fairly alight, and
as soon as the lower part of the biscuit tin was raised to a high
temperature, the big lumps of blubber at the side commenced to
have the water boiled out of them and the oil rendered down. This
oil ran under the wick-holder and supplied the wicks at their
base. The wicks, now fed with warm, pure seal oil, started to
burn brightly, and even fiercely, so that it became necessary
occasionally to damp them down with chips of fresh blubber. We
tried the experiment of using lumps of salt as wicks, and found
this fairly successful. We also tried small pieces of our brown
rope for the same purpose, using the separated strands of these
cut in pieces of about one and a half inches long. These made
excellent wicks, but we could not spare much rope. We also tried
the lamp-wick that we had brought with us for binding on our
finnesko, but in this case also rigid economy was an absolute
necessity. We decided to rely for wicks chiefly on our empty
food-bags, and thought possibly that if these ran out we might
have recourse to moss. But the empty food-bags supplied
sufficient wick for our need.</p>
<p>That day, by means of galvanised iron wires, we slung the
inner pot from our aluminium cooker over the lighted wicks of our
blubber cooker, thawed down snow in it, added chips of seal meat
and made a delicious bouillon. This had a rich red colour and
seemed very nutritious, but to me was indigestible. While Mawson
was still engaged on further cooking experiments, Mackay and I
ascended to the highest point of the island, selected a spot for
a cairn to mark our depôt, and Mackay commenced building the
cairn. Meanwhile, I returned to camp and wrote a number of
letters, including one to the commander of the <i>Nimrod</i>. The
latter was accompanied by a sketch plan taken from the Admiralty
chart to show the proper position of our final depôt before we
were to turn inland "on the low sloping shore" to the north-west
of the Drygalski Glacier. The other letters were to Lieutenant
Shackleton and to my family.</p>
<p>The letter to the commander of the <i>Nimrod</i> contained the
following statement of our plans:</p>
<p style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">
<small>"<span class="aa">Camp, Granite
Harbour</span>.</small>*</p>
<p>"<small><span class="aa">Dear Sir</span></small>,&mdash;I beg
to inform you that we intend leaving here to-morrow in
continuation of our journey towards the Magnetic Pole. We have to
work our two sledges by relays, which, of course, means slow
progress&mdash;only about four miles per day. At this rate we
hope to reach the north side of the Drygalski Ice Barrier at the
front where 'low sloping shore' is marked on the Admiralty Chart
of the Antarctic Sheet III. (please see sketch on opposite page),
by about December 15. We propose to make a depôt there marked by
a black flag similar to the one we are leaving here at the island
at south side of entrance to Granite Harbour. We propose to
travel inland from the 'low sloping shore', and if possible reach
the Magnetic Pole and return to depôt. We estimate that this may
take six weeks, so that we may not return to the coast at the low
sloping shore depôt until about January 25. We propose to wait
there until the <i>Nimrod</i> calls for us at the beginning of
February."</p>
<p class="foot">[* At this time we were under the impression that
this island was on the south side of Granite Harbour. We did not
know that we had already left Granite Harbour about twelve miles
to the south of us.]</p>
<p>The letter concluded with detailed instructions regarding the
course to be pursued in searching for the party.</p>

<p><b>IT</b> had, of course, become clear to us before this
letter was written, in view of our experience of the already
cracking sea ice near the true Granite Harbour, as well as in
view of our comparatively slow progress by relay, that our
retreat back to camp from the direction of the Magnetic Pole
would in all probability be entirely cut off through the breaking
up of the sea ice. Under these circumstances we determined to
take the risk of the <i>Nimrod</i> arriving safely on her return
voyage at Cape Royds, where she would receive the instructions to
search for us along the western coast, and also the risk of her
not being able to find our depôt and ourselves at the low sloping
shore. We knew that there was a certain amount of danger in
adopting this course, but we felt that we had got on so far with
the work entrusted to us by our Commander, that we could not
honourably now turn back. Under these circumstances we each wrote
farewell letters to those who were nearest and dearest, and the
following morning, November 2, we were up at 4.30 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span> After putting all the letters into one of our
empty dried-milk tins, and fitting on the air-tight lid, I walked
with it to the island and climbed up to the cairn. Here, after
carefully depôting several bags of geological specimens at the
base of the flagstaff, I lashed the little post office by means
of cord and copper wire securely to the flagstaff, and then
carried some large slabs of exfoliated granite to the cairn, and
built them up on the leeward side of it in order to strengthen it
against the southerly blizzards. A keen wind was blowing, as was
usual in the early morning, off the high plateau, and one's hands
got frequently frost-bitten in the work of securing the tin to
the flagstaff. The cairn was at the seaward end of a sheer cliff
two hundred feet high.</p>
<p>On returning to camp I put some chopped seal meat into the
cooking-pot on our blubber stove, which Mawson had meanwhile
lighted, and about three-quarters of an hour later we partook of
some nourishing, but no less indigestible seal bouillon. It was
later than usual when we started our sledges, and the pulling
proved extremely heavy. The sun's heat was thawing the snow
surface and making it extremely sticky. Our progress was so
painfully slow that we decided, after, with great efforts, doing
two miles, to camp, have our hoosh, and then turn in for six
hours, having meanwhile started the blubber lamp. At the
expiration of that time we intended to get out of our
sleeping-bag, breakfast, and start sledging about midnight. We
hoped that by adopting nocturnal habits of travelling, we would
avoid the sticky ice-surface which by daytime formed such an
obstacle to our progress.</p>
<p>We carried out this programme on the evening of November 2,
and the morning of November 3. We found the experiment fairly
successful, as at midnight and for a few hours afterwards, the
temperature remained sufficiently low to keep the surface of the
snow on the sea ice moderately crisp.</p>

<p>On November 3 and 4 the weather was fine, and we made fair
progress. At noon Mawson cleaned out the refuse from our blubber
lamp. Amongst this were a few dainty bits; Mackay was what he
called "playing the skua", picking these over, when he
accidentally transferred to his mouth and swallowed one of the
salt wicks which we had been using in the blubber lamp. Mawson
and I were unaware of this episode at the time. Later on, towards
evening, he complained much of thirst, and proferred a gentle
request, when the snow was being thawed down preparatory to
making hoosh, that he might be allowed to drink some of the water
before the hoosh was put into it; at the same time he gave us the
plausible explanation above mentioned as the cause of his
exceeding thirst. After debating the matter at some length, it
was decided, in view of the special circumstances surrounding the
case, and without creating a precedent&mdash;which otherwise
might become a dangerous one&mdash;that he might be allowed on
this occasion to take a drink. Mackay, however, considered that
this water gift was given grudgingly, and of necessity, and
accordingly he sternly refused to accept it. Just then, the whole
discussion was abruptly terminated through the pot being
accidentally capsized when being lifted off the blubber lamp, and
the whole of the water was lost.</p>
<p>On the following day, November 5, we were opposite a very
interesting coastal panorama, which we thought belonged to
Granite Harbour, but which was really over twenty miles to the
north of it.]Magnificent ranges of mountains, steep slopes free
from snow and ice, stretched far to the north and far to the
south of us, and finished away inland, towards the heads of long
glacier cut valleys, in a vast upland snow plateau. The rocks
which were exposed to view in the lower part of these ranges were
mostly of warm sepia brown to terra cotta lint, and were
evidently built up of a continuation of the gneissic rocks and
red granites which we had previously seen. Above these
crystalline rocks came a belt of greenish-grey rock, apparently
belonging to some stratified formation and possibly many hundreds
of feet in thickness; the latter was capped with a black rock
that seemed to be either a basic plateau lava, or a huge sill. In
the direction of the glacier valleys, the plateau was broken up
into a vast number of conical hills of various shapes and
heights, all showing evidence of intense glacial action in the
past. The hills were here separated from the coast-line by a
continuous belt of piedmont glacier ice. This last terminated
where it joined the sea ice in a steep slope, or low cliff, and
in places was very much crevassed. Mawson at our noon halts for
lunch, continued taking the angles of all these ranges and
valleys with our theodolite.</p>
<p>The temperature was now rising, being as high as 22° Fahr. at
noon on November 5. We had a very heavy sledging surface that
day, there being much consolidated brash ice, sastrugi, pie-crust
snow, and numerous cracks in the sea ice. As an offset to these
troubles we had that night, for the first time, the use of our
new frying-pan, constructed by Mawson out of one of our empty
paraffin tins. This tin had been cut in half down the middle
parallel to its broad surfaces, and loops of iron wire being
added, it was possible to suspend it inside the empty biscuit tin
above the wicks of our blubber lamp. We found that in this
frying-pan we could rapidly render down the seal blubber into
oil, and as soon as the oil boiled we dropped into the pan small
slices of seal liver or seal meat. The liver took about ten
minutes to cook in the boiling oil, the seal meat about twenty
minutes. These facts were ascertained by the empirical method.
Mawson discovered by the same method that the nicely browned and
crisp residue from the seal blubber, after the oil in it had
become rendered down, was good eating, and had a fine nutty
flavour. We also found, as the result of later experiments, that
dropping a little seal's blood into the boiling oil produced
eventually a gravy of very fine flavour. If the seal blood was
poured in rapidly into the boiling oil, it made a kind of gravy
pancake, which we also considered very good as a variety.</p>
<p>We had a magnificent view this day of fresh ranges of
mountains to the north of Depôt Island. At the foot of these was
an extensive terrace of glacier ice, a curious type of piedmont
glacier. Its surface was strongly convex near where it terminated
seawards in a steep slope or low cliff. In places this ice was
heavily crevassed. At a distance of several miles inland it
reached the spurs of an immense coastal range, while in the wide
gaps in this range the ice trended inland as far as the eye could
see until it blended in the far distance with the skyline high up
on the great inland plateau.</p>
<p>A little before 9 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> on November 5
we left our sleeping-bag, and found snow falling, with a fresh
and chilly breeze from the south. The blubber lamp, which we had
lighted before we had turned in, had got blown out. We built a
chubby house for it of snow blocks to keep off the wind, and
relighted it, and then turned into the sleeping-bag again while
we waited for the snow and chips of seal meat in our cooking-pot
to become converted into a hot bouillon; the latter was ready
after an interval of about one hour and a half. Just before
midnight we brought the cooker alight into the tent in order to
protect it from the blizzard which was now blowing and bringing
much falling snow with it. Mawson's cooking experiments continued
to be highly successful and entirely satisfactory to the
party.</p>
<p>We waited for the falling snow to clear sufficiently to enable
us to see a short distance ahead, and then started again, the
blizzard still blowing with a little low drift. After doing a
stage of pulling on both sledges to keep ourselves warm in the
blizzard we set sail&mdash;always a chilly business&mdash;and the
wind was a distinct assistance to us. We encountered a good deal
of brash ice that day, and noticed that this type of ice surface
was most common in the vicinity of icebergs, which just here were
very numerous. The brash ice is probably formed by the icebergs
surging to and fro in heavy weather like a lot of gigantic
Yermaks, and crunching up the sea ice in their vicinity. The
latter, of course, re-freezes, producing a surface covered with
jagged edges and points.</p>
<p>We were now reduced to one plasmon biscuit each for breakfast
and one for the evening meal, and we were unanimous in the
opinion that we had never before fully realised how very nice
these plasmon biscuits were. We became exceedingly careful even
over the crumbs. As some biscuits were thicker than others, the
cook for the week would select three biscuits, place them on the
outer cover of our aluminium cooker, and get one of his mates to
look in an opposite direction while the messman pointed to a
biscuit and said, "Whose?" The mate with averted face, or shut
eyes, would then state the owner, and the biscuit was ear-marked
for him, and so with the other two biscuits. Grievous was the
disappointment of the man to whose lot the thinnest of the three
biscuits had fallen. Originally, on this sledge journey, when
biscuits were more plentiful, we used to eat them regardless of
the loss of crumbs, munching them boldly, with the result that
occasional crumbs fell on the floorcloth. Not so now. Each man
broke his biscuit over his own pannikin of hoosh, so that any
crumbs produced in the process of fracture fell into the
pannikin. Then, in order to make sure that there were no loose
fragments adhering to the morsel we were about to transfer to our
mouths, we tapped the broken chip, as well as the biscuit from
which it had been broken, on the sides of the pannikin, so as to
shake into it any loose crumbs. Then, and then only, was it safe
to devour the precious morsel. Mackay, who adopted this practice
in common with the rest of us, said it reminded him of the old
days when the sailors tapped each piece of broken biscuit before
eating it in order to shake out the weevils.</p>
<p>Mawson and I now wore our ski-boots instead of finnesko, the
weather being warmer, and the ski-boot giving one a better grip
on the snow surface of the sea ice. The rough leather took the
skin off my right heel, but Mackay fixed it up later in the
evening, that is, my heel, with some "Newskin". As we found the
sharp iron spikes of the ski-boots made holes in our waterproof
floorcloth we made a practice of always changing into our
finnesko before entering the tent.</p>
<p>We sledged on uneventfully for the remainder of November 6,
and during the 7th, and on November 8 it came on to blow again
with fresh-falling snow. The blizzard was still blowing when the
time came for us to pitch our tent. We had a severe struggle to
get the tent up in the high wind and thick falling snow. At last
the work was accomplished, and we were all able to turn into our
sleeping-bag, pretty tired, at about 12.30 <span class=
"uu">p.m.</span></p>
<p>The weather was still bad the following day, November 9. After
breakfast off seal's liver, and digging out the sledges from the
snow drift, we started in the blizzard, the snow still falling.
After a little while we made sail on both sledges. The light was
very bad on account of the thick falling snow, and we were
constantly falling up to our knees in the cracks in the sea ice.
It seemed miraculous that in spite of these very numerous
accidents we never sprained an ankle.</p>
<p>That day we saw a snow petrel, and three skua gulls visited
our camp. At last the snow stopped falling and the wind fell
light, and we were much cheered by a fine, though distant view of
the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier to the north of us. We were all
extremely anxious to ascertain what sort of a surface for
sledging we should meet with on this great glacier. According to
the Admiralty chart, prepared from observations by the Discovery
expedition, this glacier was between twenty-four and thirty miles
wide, and projected over twenty miles from the rocky shore into
the sea. We hoped that we might be able to cross it without
following a circuitous route along its seaward margins.</p>
<p>We started off on November 10, amongst very heavy sastrugi and
ridges of broken pack-ice. Cracks in the sea ice were extremely
numerous. The morning was somewhat cloudy, but as the midnight
sun got higher in the heavens, the clouds dispersed and the
weather become comparatively warm, the temperature being up to
plus 3° Fahr. at 8 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> That day when we
pitched camp we were within half a mile of the southern edge of
the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier.</p>
<p>The following day, November 11, as Mawson wished to get an
accurate magnetic determination with the Lloyd-Creak dip circle,
we decided to camp, Mackay and I exploring the glacier surface to
select a suitable track for our sledges while Mawson took his
observations. After breakfast we removed everything containing
iron several hundred yards away from the tent, leaving Mawson
alone inside it in company with the dip circle. We found that the
ascent from the sea ice to the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier was a
comparatively easy one. The surface was formed chiefly of hard
snow glazed in places, partly through thawing and re-freezing,
partly through the polishing of this windward surface by
particles of fresh snow driven over it by the blizzards. Hummocky
masses, apparently of the nature of large sastrugi, projected
here and there to a height of six feet above the general level.
The latter were something like elongated white ants' nests. In
places the snow surface showed pie-crust structure, a bad surface
for sledging. On the whole this Barrier was fairly free from
crevasses, although Mackay and I crossed a few in our short
pioneering excursion.</p>
<p>The surface ascended gradually to a little over one hundred
feet above the level of the sea ice, passing into a wide
undulating plain which stretched away to the north as far as the
eye could see.</p>
<p>We returned to Mawson with the good news that the Nordenskjold
Ice Barrier was quite practicable for sledging, and would
probably afford us a much more easy surface than the sea ice over
which we had previously been passing. Mawson informed us, as the
result of his observations with the dip circle, that the Magnetic
Pole was probably about forty miles further inland than the
theoretical mean position calculated for it from the magnetic
observations of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition seven years
ago.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of November 12 we packed up, and started
to cross the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier. We noticed here that there
were two well-marked sets of sastrugi, one set, nearly due north
and south, formed by the strong southerly blizzards, the other
set, crossing nearly at right angles, coming from the west and
formed by the cold land winds blowing off the high plateau at
night on to the sea.</p>
<p>We were surprised to observe that this ice barrier was almost
completely isolated from the shore by deep inlets, and for a time
we speculated as to whether after all it might not be a gigantic
tabular iceberg run aground In view, however, of what we observed
later there can be little doubt that it is of the nature of a
large piedmont glacier, afloat at its seaward end and central
portions. It is now practically inert, having no forward movement
from the land towards the sea. It is just the vanishing remnant
of what at one time was no doubt a large active glacier,
vigorously pushed out seaward, the overflow ice from the vast
snowfields of the inland plateau. The supply, however, of ice
near the coast has dwindled so enormously that there is no longer
sufficient pressure to move this ice barrier.</p>
<p>This day, November 12, was an important one in the history of
Mawson's triangulation of the coast, for he was able in the
morning to sight simultaneously Mount Erebus and Mount Melbourne,
as well as Mount Lister. We were fortunate in having a very
bright and clear day on this occasion, and the round of angles
obtained by Mawson with the theodolite were in every way
satisfactory.</p>
<p>The following day, November 13, we were still on the
Nordenskjold Ice Barrier. The temperature in the early morning,
about 3 <span class="uu">a.m.</span>, was minus 13° Fahr. Mawson
had provided an excellent dish for breakfast consisting of
crumbed seal meat and seal's blood, which proved delicious. We
got under way about 2 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> It was a
beautiful sunshiny day with a gentle cold breeze off the western
plateau. When we had sledged for about one thousand yards Mawson
suddenly exclaimed that he could see the end of the barrier where
it terminated in a white cliff only about six hundred yards
ahead. We halted the sledge, and while Mawson took some more
theodolite angles Mackay and I reconnoitred ahead, but could find
no way down the cliff. We returned to the sledge and all pulled
on for another quarter of a mile. Once more we reconnoitred, and
this time both Mawson and I found some steep slopes formed by
drifted snow which were just practicable for a light sledge
lowered by an Alpine rope. We chose what seemed to be the best of
these; Mackay tied the Alpine rope around his body, and taking
his ice-axe descended the slope cautiously, Mawson and I holding
on to the rope meanwhile. The snow slope proved fairly soft,
giving good foothold, and he was soon at the bottom without
having needed any support from the Alpine rope. He then returned
to the top of the slope, and we all set to work unpacking the
sledges. We made fast one of the sledges to the Alpine rope, and
after loading it lightly lowered it little by little down the
slope, one of us guiding the sledge while the other two slacked
out the Alpine rope above. The man who went down the sledge to
the bottom would unload it there on the sea ice and then climb up
the slope, the other two meanwhile pulling up the empty sledge.
This manoeuvre was repeated a number of times until eventually
the whole of our food and equipment, including two sledges, were
safely down on the sea ice below.</p>
<p>We were all much elated at having got across the Nordenskjold
Ice Barrier so easily and so quickly. We were also fortunate in
securing a seal; Mackay went off and killed this, bringing back
seal steak, liver and a considerable quantity of seal blood. From
the last Mackay said he intended to manufacture a black pudding.
Usually, I believe, a black pudding is manufactured from the part
of the blood which does not contain the fibrin, but on this
occasion the black pudding was wholly formed of fibrin, so that
it may be described as a negative rather than a positive black
pudding. This fibrin was boiled up in seal oil, and though rather
tasteless was at all events nourishing, and was certainly
filling.</p>
<p>While Mackay had been in pursuit of the seal meat Mawson had
taken a meridian altitude while I kept the time for him. After
our hoosh we packed the sledges, and Mawson took a photograph
showing the cliff forming the northern boundary of the
Nordenskjold Ice Barrier. This cliff was about forty feet in
height. We had some discussion as to whether or not there was a
true tidal crack separating the sea ice from this ice barrier.
Certainly, on the south side there was no evidence of the
presence of any such crack, but on the north side there were
small local cracks; yet it could hardly be said that these were
of sufficient importance to be termed true tide-cracks. In one of
these cracks most beautiful filagree ice crystals, fully one inch
across, lined the sides of the walls of the crack in the sea ice.
There can be little doubt, I think, that the greater part of this
Nordenskjold Ice Barrier is afloat.</p>
<p>The sun was so warm this day that I was tempted before turning
in to the sleeping-bag to take off my ski-boots and socks and
give my feet a snow bath, which was very refreshing.</p>
<p>The following day, November 14, we were naturally anxious to
be sure of our exact position on the chart, in view of the fact
that we had come to the end of the ice barrier some eighteen
miles quicker than the chart led us to anticipate we should.
Mawson accordingly worked up his meridian altitude, and I plotted
out the angular distances he had found, respectively, for Mount
Erebus, Mount Lister and Mount Melbourne. As the result of the
application of our calculations to the chart it became evident
that we had actually crossed the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier of
Captain Scott's survey, and were now opposite what on his chart
was termed Charcot Bay. This was good news and cheered us up very
much, as it meant that we were nearly twenty miles further north
than we previously thought we were.</p>

<p>The day was calm and fine, and the surface of the sea ice was
covered with patches of soft snow and nearly bare ice between,
and the sledging was not quite as heavy as usual. In the evening
two skua gulls went for our seal meat during the interval that we
were returning for the second sledge after pulling on the first
sledge. It was wonderful how quickly these gulls made their
appearance from distant parts of the horizon as soon as any fresh
meat was available. The previous day one of them had actually
attempted to eat the seal meat out of our frying-pan when the
meat was being cooked in boiling oil. We could see as we came up
from a distance that the heat of the savoury dish puzzled him a
good deal, as each time he dipped his beak into our hot mince he
jerked it out again very suddenly and seemed a very surprised
bird.</p>
<p>We had a magnificent view of the rocky coastline, which is
here most impressive. The sea ice stretched away to the west of
us for several miles up to a low cliff and slope of piedmont
glacier ice, with occasional black masses of rock showing at its
edge. Several miles further inland the piedmont glacier ice
terminated abruptly against a magnificent range of mountains,
tabular for the most part but deeply intersected. In the wide
gaps between this coast range were vast glaciers fairly heavily
crevassed, descending by steep slopes from an inland plateau to
the sea.</p>
<p>On November 15, there was a fresh wind from the
west-south-west. The weather was overcast, and a few flakes of
snow were falling. We killed two young seals to replenish our
food-supply. Mackay took over the blubber cooking apparatus so as
to set Mawson free for his theodolite observations. The sky was
dull and leaden for most of the day, with occasional glimpses of
light over the western mountains. On the whole it looked as if a
blizzard were approaching.</p>
<p>We were still doing our travelling by night and sleeping
during the afternoon. When we arose from our sleeping-bag at 8
<span class="uu">p.m.</span> on the night of November 15, we
found that the signs of the blizzard had more or less passed
away. There was a beautifully perfect "Noah's Ark" in the sky;
the belts of cirrus-stratus composing the ark stretched from
south-south-west to north-north-east, converging towards the
horizon in each of these directions. Fleecy sheets of frost smoke
arose from over the open water on Ross Sea, and formed dense
cumulus clouds. This, of course, was a certain indication to us
that open water was not far distant, and impressed upon us the
necessity of making every possible speed if we hoped to reach our
projected point of departure on the coast for the Magnetic Pole
before the sea ice entirely broke up.</p>
<p>This had been a truly glorious day, bright and sunny, and as
this was the end of a food week and the messman for the week had
kept a little food up his sleeve, so to speak, we fared
sumptuously. The cocoa was extra strong, milky and sweet.
Mackay's opinion was that such cocoa much reminded him of better
days, and was absolutely uplifting.</p>
<p>The following day, November 17, after a very heavy sledging
over loose powdery snow six inches deep we reached a low glacier
and ice cliff. We were able to get some really fresh snow from
this barrier or glacier, the cliffs of which were from thirty to
forty feet high. It was a great treat to get fresh water at last,
as since we had left the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier the only snow
available for cooking purposes had been brackish.</p>
<p>The following day was also bright and sunny, but the sledging
was terribly heavy. The sun had thawed the surface of the saline
snow and our sledge runners had become saturated with soft water.
We were so wearied with the great effort necessary to keep the
sledges moving that at the end of each halt we fell sound asleep
for five minutes or so at a time across the sledges. On such
occasions one of the party would wake the others up, and we would
continue our journey. We were even more utterly exhausted than
usual at the end of this day.</p>
<p>By this time, however, we were in sight of a rocky headland
which we took to be Cape Irizar, and we knew that this cape was
not very far to the south of the Drygalski Glacier. Indeed,
already, a long line was showing on the horizon which could be no
other than the eastward extension of this famous and, as it
afterwards proved, formidable glacier.</p>
<p>On November 19, we had another heavy day's sledging, ankle
deep in the soft snow with occasional thin patches of sludgy
saline ice from which ice flowers had recently disappeared
through thawing, We only did two miles of relay work this day and
yet were quite exhausted at the end of it.</p>
<p>The following day, November 20, being short of meat we killed
a seal calf and cow, and so replenished our larder. At the end of
the day's sledging I walked over about two miles to a cliff face,
about six miles south of Cape Irizar. The rocks all along this
part of the shore were formed of coarse gneissic granite, of
which I was able to collect some specimens. The cliff was about
one hundred feet high where it was formed of the gneiss, and
above this rose a capping of from seventy to eighty feet in
thickness of heavily crevassed blue glacier ice. There were here
wide tide-cracks between the sea ice and the foot of the sea
cliff. These were so wide that it was difficult to cross them.
The whole shore line was literally alive with seals and seal
calves; there were over fifty of them in a stretch of about three
hundred yards. At a distance of two miles our tent was, of
course, quite out of sight, and one had to be guided back, on
this as on other similar occasions, chiefly by one's
footprints.</p>
<p>The following day, November 21, the sledging was painfully
heavy over thawing saline snow surface, and sticky sea ice. We
were only able to do two and two-thirds miles.</p>
<p>On November 22, on rounding the point of the low ice barrier,
thirty to forty feet high, we obtained a good view of Cape
Irizar, and also of the Drygalski Ice Barrier.</p>
<p>On November 23 we found that a mild blizzard was blowing, but
we travelled on through it as Me could not afford to lose any
time. The blizzard died down altogether about 3 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span>, and was succeeded by a gentle westerly wind off
the plateau. That evening, after our tent had been put up and we
had finished the day's meal, I walked over a mile to the shore.
The prevailing rock was still gneissic granite with large whitish
veins of aplitic granite. A little bright green moss was growing
on tiny patches of sand and gravel, and in some of the cracks in
the granite. The top of the cliff was capped by blue glacier ice.
With the help of steps cut by my ice-axe I climbed some distance
up this in order to try and get some fresh ice for cooking
purposes, but close to the top of the slope I accidentally
slipped and glissaded most unwillingly some distance down before
I was able to check myself by means of the chisel edge of the
ice-axe. My hands were somewhat cut and bruised, but otherwise no
damage was done. The whole of this ice was slightly bitter; no
doubt sea spray in heavy weather when the sea was open during
summer time, had dashed over the headland, and so flavoured the
ice with sea salts. At last I obtained some fairly fresh ice in
the form of large ice stalactites depending from an overhanging
cliff of glacier ice. With these and my geological specimens I
trudged back to the camp.</p>
<p>On November 24, a strong keen wind was blowing off the plateau
from the west-south-west. This died down later on in the morning
at about 2 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> and the temperature at 9
<span class="uu">a.m.</span> rose as high as plus 20° Fahr. We
were all suffering somewhat from want of sleep, and although the
snow surface was better than it had been for some little time we
still found the work of sledging very fatiguing. A three-man
sleeping-bag, where you are wedged in more or less tightly
against your mates, where all snore and shin one another and each
feels on waking that he is more sinned against than shinning, is
not conducive to real rest; and we rued the day that we chose the
three-man bag in preference to the one-man bags. That afternoon
and evening we slept a little longer than usual, and felt much
refreshed on the early morning of November 25.</p>
<p>It was interesting to watch at lunch time the anxious face of
the messman for the week as he sat with his nose close to the
outer cover of the aluminium cooker in order to catch the first
whiff of the delicious aroma which told that the tea in the water
of the inner cooking-pot had been just brought to the boil. With
the first sniff of the aroma the messman would immediately
unscrew the brass valve of the Primus, so as to let the air in
and the Primus lamp down, with a view to saving paraffin oil.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a><span class="aa">Chapter
Four</span></h2>
<br>
<p><b>ON</b> the following day, November 26, we saw on looking
back that the rocky headland, where I had collected the specimens
of granite and moss, was not part of the mainland, but a small
island. This day was rather a memorable one in our journey, as we
reached a large rocky promontory, which we supposed at the time
to be Cape Irizar. Subsequent observations, however, proved that
we must already have passed Cape Irizar, which was in all
probability the small island just referred to.</p>
<p>We had some good sledging here over pancake ice nearly free
from snow and travelled fast. While Mackay secured some seal meat
Mawson and I ascended the rocky promontory, climbing at first
over rock, then over glacier ice, to a height of about six
hundred feet above the sea. The rock was a pretty red granite
traversed by large dykes of black rocks, apparently of an
alkaline character, belonging to the phonolites or
tinguaites.</p>
<p>From the top of the headland to the north we had a magnificent
view across the level surface of sea ice far below us. We saw
that at a few miles from the shore an enormous iceberg, frozen
into the floe, lay right across the path which we had intended to
travel in our northerly course on the morrow. To the north-west
of us was Geikie Inlet and beyond that stretching as far as the
eye could follow was the great Drygalski Glacier. Beyond the
Drygalski Glacier were a series of rocky hills. One of these was
identified as probably being Mount Neumaer. Several mountains
could be seen further to the north of this, but the far distance
was obscured from view by cloud and mist so that we were unable
to make out the outline of Mount Nansen. It was evident that the
Drygalski Glacier was bounded landwards on the north by a steep
cliff of dark, highly jointed rock, and we were not a little
concerned to observe with our field-glasses that the surface of
the Drygalski Glacier was wholly different to that of the
Nordenskjold Ice Barrier. It was clear that the surface of the
Drygalski Glacier was formed of jagged surfaces of ice very
heavily crevassed, and projecting in the form of immense séracs
separated from one another by deep undulations or chasms. It at
once suggested to my mind some scaly dragon-like monster and
recalled the lines of Milton quoted at the beginning of this
chapter. The "Scaly horror of his folded tail" did not seem
enchanting even at this distance of ten to fifteen miles. We
could see that much of this glacier was absolutely impossible for
sledging, but it appeared that further eastward the inequalities
of the ice-surface became less pronounced, and at the extreme
eastward extension, at a distance of some twenty-five to thirty
miles from where we stood, the surface appeared fairly smooth.
After taking these observations from our point of vantage we
retraced our steps. Mawson, in his spiked ski-boots, got down the
sloping ice-surface with comparative ease, but as I had finnesko
on I found it necessary to cut steps with my ice-axe all the way
down the glacier ice.</p>
<p>It was obvious from what we had seen looking out to sea to the
east of our camp that there were large bodies of open water
trending shorewards in the form of long lanes at no great
distance. The lanes of water were only partly frozen over, and
some of these were interposed between us and the Drygalski
Glacier. Clearly not a moment was to be lost if we were to reach
the Drygalski Glacier before the sea ice broke up. A single
strong blizzard would now have converted the whole of the sea ice
between us and the Drygalski Glacier into a mass of drifting
pack. We obtained from this rocky promontory a fine collection of
geological specimens, and here, as elsewhere, got abundant
evidence of former much greater extension of the inland ice
sheet.</p>
<p>The following day, November 27, we decided to run our sledges
to the east of the large berg, which we had observed on the
previous day, and this course apparently would enable us to avoid
a wide and ugly looking tide-crack extending northwards from the
rocky point at our previous camp. The temperature was now as high
as from plus 26° to plus 28° Fahr. at mid-day, consequently, the
saline snow and ice were all day more or less sticky and slushy.
We camped near the large berg.</p>
<p>On the morning of November 28 a mother seal with a well-grown
baby came up to our tent and sniffed and snorted around its
skirt. It seemed about to enter the tent when I hunted it off,
and mother and baby, meanwhile, made tracks, in every sense of
the word, for the open water. Then we packed up and started our
sledges, and pulled them over a treacherous slushy tide-crack,
and then headed them round an open lead of water in the sea ice.
At 3 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> we had lunch near the east end
of the big berg. Near here Mackay and Mawson succeeded in
catching and killing an Emperor penguin, and took the breast and
liver. This bird was caught close to a lane of open water in the
sea ice. We found that in the direction of the berg this was
thinly frozen over, and for some time it seemed as though our
progress further north was completely blocked. Eventually we
found a place where the ice might just bear our sledges. We
strengthened this spot by laying down on it slabs of sea ice and
shovelfuls of snow, and when the causeway was completed&mdash;not
without Mackay breaking through the ice in one place and very
nearly getting a ducking&mdash;we rushed our sledges over safely,
although the ice was so thin that it bent under their weight. We
were thankful to get them both safely to the other side.</p>
<p>We now found ourselves amongst some very high sastrugi and
hard tough snow. We had to drag the sledges over a great number
of these, which were nearly at right angles to our course. This
work proved extremely fatiguing. The sastrugi were from five to
six feet in height. As we were having dinner at the end of our
day's sledging we heard a loud report which we considered to be
due to the opening of a new crack in the sea ice. We thought it
was possible that this crack was caused by some movement of the
great active Drygalski Glacier, now only about four miles ahead
of us to the north.</p>
<p>We got out of our sleeping-bag soon after 8 <span class=
"uu">p.m.</span> on the evening of the 28th, and started just
before midnight. The ice-surface over which we were sledging this
day had a curious appearance resembling rippling stalagmites, or
what may be termed ice marble. This opacity appeared to be due to
a surface enamel of partly thawed snow. This surface kept
continually cracking as we passed over it with a noise like that
of a whip being cracked. It was evidently in a state of tension,
being contracted by the cold which attained its maximum soon
after midnight, for, although of course we had for many weeks
past been having the midnight sun it was still so low in the
heavens towards midnight that there was an appreciable difference
in the temperature between midnight and the afternoon. This
difference in our case was further accentuated by the cold
nocturnal wind from the high plateau to our west. This wind was
of the nature of a land breeze on a large scale.</p>
<p>There were here two sets of sastrugi, the principal set
parallel to the plateau wind and trending here from nearly
north-west to south-east; the other set, caused by the blizzard
winds, trended from south to north. We were now getting very
short of biscuits, and as a consequence were seized with food
obsessions, being unable to talk about anything but cereal foods,
chiefly cakes of various kinds and fruits. Whenever we halted for
a short rest we could discuss nothing but the different dishes
with which we had been regaled in our former lifetime at various
famous restaurants and hotels.</p>
<p>The plateau wind blew keenly and strongly all day on November
29. As we advanced further to the north the ice-surface became
more and more undulatory, rising against us in great waves like
waves of the sea. Evidently these waves were due to the forward
movement, and consequent pressure of the Drygalski Glacier. We
had a fine view from the top of one of these ridges over the
surface of the Drygalski Glacier to the edge of the inland
plateau. Far inland, perhaps forty or fifty miles away, we could
see the great névé fields, which fed the Drygalski Glacier,
descending in conspicuous ice falls, and beyond these loomed dim
mountains. At the end of this day we hardly knew whether we were
on the edge of the sea ice or on the thin edge of the Drygalski
Glacier. Probably, I think, we were on very old sea ice, perhaps
representing the accumulations of several successive seasons.</p>
<p>It fell calm at about 9 <span class="uu">p.m.</span>, but just
before midnight, November 29-30, the plateau wind returned,
blowing stronger than ever. As the sun during the afternoon had
now considerable heating power we tried the experiment of putting
snow into our aluminium cooking-pot, the exterior of which by
this time was permanently coated with greasy lamp-black from the
blubber lamp, and leaving the pot exposed in the evening to the
direct rays of the sun. The lamp-black, of course, formed an
excellent absorbent of the sun's heat-rays. On getting out of the
sleeping-bag at 9 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> on November 29 I
found that about half the snow I had put into the cooking-pot had
been thawed down by the sun's heat. This, of course, saved both
paraffin and blubber. It takes, of course, as much energy to thaw
ice or snow at a temperature of 32° Fahr. to form a given volume
of water as it does to raise that water from 32° Fahr. up to
boiling-point. As our snow and ice used for domestic purposes
frequently had a temperature of many degrees below zero, the heat
energy necessary to thaw it was greater than that required to
raise the water from freezing-point to boiling-point.</p>
<p>As we advanced with our sledge on the early morning of
November 30, the ice ridges fronting us became higher and
steeper, and we had much ado straining with all our might on the
steep ice slopes to get the sledges to move, and they skidded a
good deal as we dragged them obliquely up the slopes. The plateau
wind, too, had freshened, and was now blowing on our port bow at
from fifteen to twenty miles an hour, bringing with it a good
deal of low drift. At last, about 10 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span>, the plateau wind dropped and with it the drift,
and the weather became warm and sunny.</p>
<p>The glacier now spread before us as a great billowy sea of
pale green ice, with here and there high embankments of
marble-like névé resembling railway embankments. Unfortunately
for our progress, the trend of the latter was nearly at right
angles to our course. As we advanced still further north the
undulations became more and more pronounced, the embankments
higher and steeper. These embankments were now bounded by cliffs
from forty to fifty feet in height, with overhanging cornices of
tough snow. The cliffs faced northwards. The deep chasms which
they produced formed a very serious obstacle to our advance, and
we had to make some long <i>détours</i> in order to head them
off. On studying one of these chasms it seemed to me that their
mode of origin was somewhat as follows: In the first place the
surface of the ice had become strongly ridged through forward
movement of the glacier, with perhaps differential frictional
resistance; the latter causing a series of undulations, the top
of each ice undulation would then be further raised by an
accumulation of snow partly carried by the west-north-west
plateau wind, partly by the southerly blizzard wind. These two
force components produced these overhanging cliffs facing the
north. For some reason the snow would not lie at the bottoms of
the troughs between the undulations. Probably they were swept
bare by the plateau wind. It was hardly to be wondered at that we
were unable to advance our sledges more than about one mile and a
half that day.</p>
<p>The next day, December 1, the hauling of our sledges became
much more laborious. For half a day we struggled over high
sastrugi, hummocky ice ridges, steep undulations of bare blue ice
with frequent chasms impassible for a sledge, unless it was
unloaded and lowered by Alpine rope. After struggling on for a
little over half a mile we decided to camp, and while Mawson took
magnetic observations and theodolite angles, Mackay and I
reconnoitred ahead for between two and three miles to see if
there was any way at all practicable for the sledge out of these
mazes of chasms, undulations and séracs. Mackay and I were roped
together for this exploratory work, and fell into about a score
of crevasses before we returned to camp, though in this case we
never actually fell with our head and shoulders below the lids of
the crevasses, as they were mostly filled at the surface with
tough snow. We had left a black signal flag on top of a
conspicuous ice mound as a guide to us as to the whereabouts of
the camp, and we found this a welcome beacon when we started to
return, as it was by no means an easy task finding one's way
across this storm-tossed ice sea, even when one was only a mile
or two from the camp. On our return we found that Mawson was just
completing his observations. He found that the dip of the needle
here was 2½° off the vertical. We brought the tent down from
where he had been taking magnetic observations, and treading
warily, because of crevasses, set it up again close to our
sledge, and had lunch.</p>
<p>We noticed in the case of the snow lids over crevasses that
they were covered by a very pretty moss-like growth of pointed
ice crystals. This growth was apparently due to a slow upward
steaming of moist air from the spaces between the walls of the
crevasses below. Possibly during the day the air beneath the snow
lids may become slightly warmed, and as the temperature falls at
night, particularly under the influence of the plateau wind, a
slow percolation of the warm air through the snow lid may take
place, and the small amount of moisture in it is deposited on the
surface of the lid on coming in contact with the colder air
outside. This process, continued from day to day, gradually
builds up these moss-like crystals.</p>
<p>That afternoon we discussed the situation at some length. It
appeared that the Drygalski Glacier must be at least twenty miles
in width. If we were to cross it along the course which we were
now following at the rate of half a mile every half day it would
obviously take at least twenty days to get to the other side, and
this estimate did not allow for those unforeseen delays which
experience by this time had taught us were sure to occur. The
view which Mackay and I had obtained of the glacier ice ahead of
us showed that our difficulties, for a considerable distance,
would materially increase. Under these circumstances we were
reluctantly forced to the conclusion that our only hope of
ultimate success lay in retreat. We accordingly determined to
drag the sledges back off the glacier on to the sea ice by the
way along which we had come.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of December 2 the retreat began. Just
before midnight it had been clear and sunny, but as midnight
approached a thick fog suddenly came up and obscured everything.
Consequently we had great difficulty in picking up our old sledge
tracks as we retreated over the glacier ice. The weather was
still very thick and foggy at 3 <span class="uu">a.m.</span>, but
a little before 6 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> the fog cleared
off and the sun shone through. We had now reached the southern
edge of the glacier, and were back on the old undulating sea ice.
We turned our sledges eastwards following parallel with the
glacier edge. Immediately on our left rose large rounded hummocky
masses of ice belonging to the Drygalski Glacier, and from fifty
to sixty feet in height. The sky, meanwhile, had become again
overcast with dense cumulus which drifted across rapidly from a
south-easterly direction.</p>
<p>The following day we still travelled eastwards parallel to the
southern edge of the Drygalski Glacier. The sledging was chiefly
over soft snow, ankle deep, with occasional high snow sastrugi,
and here and there a patch of rippled sea ice. There could be no
doubt about it being sea ice this time because in one place, at
the foot of one of these steep snow ridges, we noticed a pool of
water only thinly frozen over, and on breaking the ice I tasted
the water and found it was very salt.</p>
<p>Towards the end of this day's sledging we passed a long inlet
trending north-westerly. This inlet was floored with sea ice, and
made a long, deep indentation in the glacier ice. After our
hoosh, and before turning into the sleeping-bag, Mawson and I
went on to the north over some high hummocky ridges of the
Drygalski Glacier to look ahead. Mawson, after a while, returned
to camp, while I turned north-westwards to explore the inlet.
After falling into a few crevasses which traversed the great
billowy hummocks of blue glacier ice in all directions, I got
down into the inlet, and on following it north-westwards, found
that it gradually passed into a definite glacial river channel,
and became quite unpracticable for sledging. It was quite clear
from the steep banks of this channel, cut out of the hard snow
névé and glacier ice, that during the few weeks of thaw in this
part of the Antarctic, great volumes of thaw water must rush down
off the higher parts of the glacier towards the sea, and in their
passage they tear out deep canyon-like channels in the glacier
ice and névé. This channel trended at first exactly in the
direction in which we wished to make, but it was obvious that it
was an impossible route for the sledges.</p>

<p align="center"><small>47. <span class="aa">Skua Gulls at the

<p>We decided on December 4 that we had better go on an extended
reconnoitring expedition before we again risked landing our
sledge in a labyrinth of pressure ridges and crevasses. After
hauling our sledges for a little less than a mile, and meeting
with steep slopes of snow dunes, we halted. While Mackay sewed
one of the tent-poles, which had become loosened, back into its
place in the canvas crown which held the tops of the tent-poles
together, Mawson and I climbed on to some hummocks a little north
of the camp to see which route would be best to follow on our
reconnoitring journey. After lunch we all three started with our
ice-axes and the Alpine rope. We travelled up a broad bottomed
snow valley for about two miles trending in the direction of
Mount Larsen. Then for a little over a mile beyond it trended
more to the right in the direction of Mount Nansen. Here we got
into difficult country, the snow surface being succeeded by
steep-sided hummocks, rolls and ridges of blue glacier ice, with
occasional deep chasms and very numerous crevasses. We fell into
numbers of the latter up to our thighs, but the snow lids as yet
were just strong enough to stop us going deeper. Mawson opened up
one of these snow lids with his ice-axe, and we noticed that the
lid was from one to one and a half feet thick, while the crevasse
was thirty feet wide and of vast depth. Much of the ground over
which we were travelling rang hollow, and was evidently only
roofed over by a thin layer of tough snow. Altogether we
travelled about four miles to the north of our camp, but could
see no sign from there of any sea to the north of us. Meanwhile,
Mackay diverged somewhat to the west, climbed on the top of a
high ice pyramid, but was unable to see any trace of the sea
beyond. We now returned at a smart pace back to camp, arriving
about 9 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> We were all pretty tired,
and, as usual before entering the tent, we took off our spiked
ski-boots so as to avoid puncturing the waterproof floorcloth,
and put on finnesko. Hoosh was prepared, and we had a good meal
of it, as well as of fried seal meat with blubber and seal
oil.</p>
<p>It was evident now that even if we were to succeed in crossing
the Drygalski Glacier, the passage would occupy a good many days,
even under the most favourable circumstances, and our provisions
were running very short. After we finished our hoosh, Mawson,
with the field-glasses, sighted a seal near to the big berg to
the south of us, which we had passed some five days previously.
We decided that we would go after this seal the next day;
meanwhile, the seal disappeared. Fearing that a blizzard might
spring up on the following day, I proposed to go that evening out
to the berg in search of seals, but Mackay kindly volunteered
instead and started off with his rucksack and ice-axe and a small
allowance of provisions, consisting of some cooked seal meat,
biscuits and chocolate. He had a long journey before him. While
he was gone I was chiefly occupied in dividing up our rations
into half-ration lots. At 5 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> I was
attracted by the notes of a penguin behind an ice mound at no
great distance. Rousing Mawson, we both went in pursuit and after
a long and severe chase, captured an Adelie penguin.</p>
<p>At about midnight, December 4-5, Mackay returned to camp after
his fourteen miles' tramp over the sea ice. He brought back with
him a most welcome addition to our larder in the shape of over
thirty pounds of seal meat, liver and seal blubber. He reported
that he had had great difficulty in crossing the large ice-crack
where we had constructed the causeway for our sledge some five
days previously, and he said that it would now have been
impossible to have got the sledge over it. Mackay had been up
over seventeen hours, and had been sledging, travelling over
heavy ice, and carrying his heavy load of seal meat with only
short intervals for meals. He had travelled a distance of about
twenty-four miles, and of course under the circumstances was much
exhausted and badly in need of a long rest. By securing the so
much needed additional food supply, he had rendered us an
extremely important service. It now, of course, became necessary
to give him the needed rest on the following day. Accordingly,
the earlier part of December 6 we spent in the sleeping-bag.</p>
<p>Soon after midnight, December 5-6, we left our camp on the
south side of the Drygalski Glacier, and struck across the high
ridges of blue ice into the small valley in the glacier which we
had prospected two days previously. As usual a keen wind was
blowing off the plateau at this time of the morning, but the
temperature soon rose to plus 23° Fahr. at 7.15 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span> The sky was overcast with heavy stratus and
cumulus clouds, especially in the direction of Cape Washington.
We passed over a considerable number of crevasses without any
serious accident. The day's sledging was heavy on account of the
strongly undulating surface of the ice and the quantity of soft
snow in the ice valley on the surface of the Drygalski
Glacier.</p>
<p>The following day, December 7, was also dull and lowering,
with very dense cumulus clouds over Cape Washington and Mounts
Melbourne and Nansen. We inferred that this dense cumulus was due
to the presence of open water between the Drygalski Glacier and
Cape Washington, and were not a little anxious as to whether, in
the event of the sea ice having all drifted out on the north side
of the Drygalski Glacier, it would be possible for us to travel
shorewards on the surface of the glacier itself, when we got to
the other side. We encountered many precipitous slopes from
thirty to forty feet deep, often with overhanging cornices,
barring our northward progress like those already met with in the
part of the glacier from which Me had retreated. These
overhanging cliffs, however, were not quite as serious as those
which we had left behind, and by making considerable
<i>détours</i> we managed to circumvent them. At last we seemed
to have got amongst an impassable belt of high crevassed ice
ridges with precipitous chasms between. After a good deal of
reconnoitring ahead a clue out of the labyrinth was discovered in
the form of a series of high snow ridges which led backwards and
forwards, in and out, amongst the high-pressure ridges, and
eventually enabled us to land our sledges in a broad crevassed
valley on the glacier surface.</p>
<p>After the hoosh at the end of our day's sledging, Mawson and I
walked about two miles, looking out for a track for the next
morning. The outlook was by no means encouraging, as the surface
still bristled with huge ice undulations as far as the eye could
reach. It was just as though a stormy sea had suddenly been
frozen solid, with the troughs between its large waves here and
there partly filled with snow, while the crests of the waves were
raised by hard ridges of drift snow, terminating in overhanging
cliffs, facing the north. It was obvious, too, that the glacier
ice over which we would have to travel, was still very heavily
crevassed. As we returned, a mild blizzard sprang up from the
south-south-west, bringing low drift with it. The blizzard
cleared off in about an hour and a half, and the sun came out
strong and hot, and rapidly thawed the snow on our tent and on
the food-bags stored on our sledges.</p>
<p>The following day, December 8, we dug away the drift snow
piled by the blizzard against our sledges, and were pleased to
find that the day was beautifully fine and sunny with a light
breeze from the west-south-west. The sledging was very heavy up
and down steep ice slopes with much soft snow between.</p>
<p>Mawson had a slight attack of snow blindness on December 9.
The day was so warm that we even felt it oppressive, the
temperature at midnight being as high as plus 19° Fahr. The
glacier ice kept cracking from time to time with sharp reports.
Possibly this may have been due to the expansion of the ice under
the influence of the hot sun. At one spot the sledges had to be
dragged up a grade of 1 in 3 over smooth blue glacier ice. This
was exceedingly heavy work. At last, when we were near to our
time for camping, Mackay, on going on a short distance ahead to
reconnoitre with the field-glasses, sighted open water on the
northern edge of the Drygalski Ice Barrier, about three to four
miles distant. He announced his discovery with shouts of
<i><small>&Theta;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&tau;&tau;&alpha;</small></i>,&nbsp;<i><small>&Theta;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&tau;&tau;&alpha;</small></i>,
which thrilled us now as of old they thrilled the Ten Thousand.
It was no sparkling waters of the Euxine that had met his gaze,
but a Black Sea nevertheless, for so it appeared as its inky
waves heaved under the leaden sky. But what a joy to have reached
once more that friendly water world that went up by many a creek
and river to our homes. It was now clear to us that we could not
hope for sea ice over which to sledge westwards to the shore,
where we proposed to make our final depôt before attempting the
ascent of the great inland plateau in order to reach the Magnetic
Pole.</p>
<p>During the day we were cheered by a visit from several snow
petrels, which flew around our camp, as well as from three skua
gulls. Mawson managed to snare one of the skuas with a
fishing-line, but it got away when he was hauling in the line.
Our sledging that day was not quite so heavy; the ice undulations
were less formidable, and the belts of snow between became wider
and firmer. Just after lunch a beautiful Wilson's petrel flew
around us.</p>
<p>December 10 saw us still struggling to cross the Drygalski
Glacier. We could see that we were now on a pretty high ridge,
but the highest part of the glacier now lay to the south and
therefore behind us. We were much rejoiced towards the end of the
day's sledging to find ourselves at last off the true glacier
type of surface, and on to what may be described as an undulating
barrier type. This improvement of the surface to our west enabled
us to do what we had been longing to do for the last six days,
turn our sledge westwards. At first we had to incline somewhat to
the north-west in order to skirt round some high ice ridges.
Then, after making some northing, we were able to go nearly due
west. The snow surface was largely of the pie-crust type; our
ski-boots broke through it at every step and we sank in up to our
ankles. At intervals we still crossed low ridges of solid glacier
ice, traversed by crevasses. All the crevasses were more or less
roofed over with tough snow lids. These lids sometimes were
slightly in relief, or sometimes showed slight depressions in the
general surface. In such areas the snow lids rung hollow as the
sledges travelled over them. We found the snow lids always most
treacherous close to either wall of the crevasse, and we
frequently fell partially through at such spots, but had no very
bad falls in this part of the glacier.</p>
<p>The following day. December 11, we had a fine view of "Terra
Nova" Bay, and as far as could be judged the edge of the
Drygalski Ice Barrier on the north was now scarcely a mile
distant. We were much surprised at the general appearance of the
outline of the Ice Barrier coastal ice and coast-line ahead of
us. It did not agree, as far as we could judge, with the shape of
this region as shown on the Admiralty chart, and we could see no
certain indication whatever of what was called, on the chart,
"the low, sloping shore". Accordingly we halted a little earlier
than usual in order to reconnoitre. There was a conspicuous ice
mound about half a mile to the north-west of this camp. Mackay
started off with the field-glasses for a general look round from
this point of vantage. Mawson started changing his plates in the
sleeping-bag, while I prepared to go out with my sketch-book and
get an outline panoramic view of the grand coast ranges now in
sight. Crevasses of late had been so few and far between that I
thought it was an unnecessary precaution to take my ice-axe with
me, but I had scarcely gone more than six yards from the tent,
when the lid of a crevasse suddenly collapsed under me at a point
where there was absolutely no outward or visible sign of its
existence, and let me down suddenly nearly up to my shoulders. I
only saved myself from going right down by throwing my arms out
and staying myself on the snow lid on either side. The lid was so
rotten that I dared not make any move to extricate myself, or I
might have been precipitated into the abyss. Fortunately Mawson
was close at hand, and on my calling to him, he came out of our
sleeping-bag, and bringing an ice-axe, chipped a hole in the firm
ice on the edge of the crevasse nearest to me. He then inserted
the chisel edge of the ice-axe in the hole and holding on to the
pick point, swung the handle towards me: grasping this, I was
able to extricate myself and climbed out on to the solid ice.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day, the coast-line showing up very finely,
and I was able to get from the ice mound a sketch of the
mountains. Mawson also took three photographs, making a panoramic
view of this part of the coast. He was able, also, to get a
valuable series of angles with the theodolite, which showed that
the shape of the coast-line here necessitated serious
modification of the existing chart.</p>

<p><b>FAR</b> beyond the golden mountains to the north and west
lay our goal, but as yet we knew not whether we were destined to
fail or succeed. Meanwhile no time was to be lost in hurrying on
and preparing for a dash on to the plateau, if we were to deserve
success.</p>
<p>The following day, December 12, we sledged on for half a mile
until we were a little to the west of the conspicuous ice mound
previously described. We concluded that as this ice mound
commanded such a general view of the surrounding country, it must
itself be a conspicuous object to any one approaching the
Drygalski Glacier by sea from the north; and so we decided that
as there was still no trace of the "low, sloping shore" of the
chart, and that as the spot at which we had now arrived was very
near to the area so named on the chart, we would make our depôt
here. We intended to leave at this depôt one of our sledges with
any spare equipment, a little food, and all our geological
specimens, and proceed thence shorewards and inland with one
sledge only. We estimated that we still had fully 220 miles to
travel from this depôt on the Drygalski Glacier to the Magnetic
Pole. It was, therefore, necessary now to make preparations for a
journey there and back of at least 440 miles. We thought that
with <i>détours</i> the journey might possibly amount to 500
miles.</p>
<p>We could see, even from our distance of from twenty to thirty
miles from the shoreline, that we had no light task before us in
order to win a way on to the high inland plateau. Before we knew
that the whole of the sea ice had gone out between us and Mount
Melbourne, we had contemplated the possibility of travelling
further northwards along the coast on sea ice, down to a spot
marked on the chart as Gerlache Inlet. This inlet we now saw was
situated amongst a wilderness of high sharp jagged mountain peaks
rising to heights of from 6000 to 8000 ft. above sea-level, and
as it could now be approached only from the land, it was now
practically inaccessible. Nearer to us, and to the north-west of
our position on the Drygalski Ice Barrier, was the giant form of
Mount Nansen, one of the grandest and most imposing of all the
mountains seen by us in the Antarctic. Further to the left and
nearly due west of us was another fine dark mountain massif,
Mount Larsen. Between Mount Larsen and Mount Nansen was a vast
glacier with a rugged surface, steep ice falls and large
crevasses. About midway between Mounts Larsen and Nansen was a
huge nunatak of black rock, rising abruptly from the ice surface
at a point several miles inland from the shore-line. Further to
the left of Mount Larsen was another glacier less formidable in
appearance and smaller in size than the Mount Nansen Glacier.
This terminated near the coast in rather a steep slope, and
gradually became confluent with the Drygalski Glacier. To the
south of this glacier, which may be termed the Mount Larsen
Glacier, was another great mountain massif with Mount
Bellingshausen on the north and Mount Neumaer on the south. The
foothils of Mount Neumaer terminated in steep precipices forming
the northern wall of the Drygalski Glacier.</p>
<p>Our first business was to lay in a stock of provisions
sufficient to last us for our 500 miles of further journeying.
Mackay started for a small inlet about a mile and a half distant
from our camp, where he found a number of seals and Emperor and
Adelie penguins. He killed some seals and Emperor penguins, and
loaded a good supply of seal steak, blubber, liver and penguin
steak and liver on to the sledge. In the course of his hunting,
he fell through an ice bridge, at a tide-crack, up to his waist
in the water. Mawson and I went out to meet him when the sledge
was loaded, and helped to drag it back to camp. We found it very
hot in the tent, the weather being fine and sunny. It was
delightful to be able at last to rest our weary limbs after the
many weeks of painful toil over the sea ice and the Drygalski
Glacier.</p>
<p>We started cooking our meat for the sledging trip on the
following day, December 13, our intention being to take with us
provisions for seven weeks, in addition to equipment, including
scientific instruments, &amp;c. We estimated that the total
weight would amount to about 670 lb. We were doubtful, in our
then stale and weakened condition, whether we should be able to
pull such a load over the deep loose snow ahead of us, and then
drag it up the steep ice slopes of the great glaciers which
guarded the route to the plateau.</p>
<p>The sun was so hot that it started melting the fat out of our
pemmican bags, so that the fat actually oozed through not only
the canvas of the bags themselves, but also through the thick
brown canvas of the large fortnightly food-bags, which formed a
sort of tank for containing the pemmican bags, and we found it
necessary at once to shade the food-bags from the sun by piling
our Burberry garments over them. Leather straps, tar rope, tins,
sledge harness, lamp-black off the blubber cooker, warmed by the
rays of the sun, all commenced to sink themselves more or less
rapidly into the névé.</p>
<p>We unpacked and examined both sledges, and found that of the
two, the runners of the Duff sledge were the less damaged. As the
result of the rough treatment to which it had recently been
subjected, one of the iron brackets of this sledge was broken,
but we replaced it with a sound one from the discarded Christmas
Tree sledge.</p>
<p>The following day, December 14, we were still busy preparing
for the great trek on the morrow. Mackay was busy cooking Emperor
penguin and seal meat for the plateau journey; Mawson was
employed in transferring the scientific instrument boxes and the
Venesta boxes in which our Primus lamp and other light gear were
packed from the Christmas Tree sledge on to the Duff sledge. He
also scraped the runners of the sledge with pieces of broken
glass in order to make their surfaces as smooth as possible. I
was busy fixing up depôt flags, writing letters to the Commander
of the <i>Nimrod</i>, Lieutenant Shackleton, and my family, and
fixing up a milk tin to serve as a post office on to the depôt
flag-pole. When all our preparations were completed we drew the
Christmas Tree sledge with some of our spare clothing, our
blubber cooker, a biscuit tin with a few broken biscuits, and all
our geological specimens to the top of the ice mound, about a
quarter of a mile distant. On reaching the top of the mound we
cut trenches with our ice-axes in which to embed the runners of
the sledge, fixed the runners in these grooves, piled the chipped
ice on top, then lashed to the sledge, very carefully, the
flag-pole about six feet high, with the black flag displayed on
the top of it. The wind blew keenly off the plateau before our
labours were completed. We all felt quite sorry and downcast at
parting with this sledge, which by this time seemed to us like a
bit of home. We then returned to camp. Just previous to depôting
this sledge, Mackay fixed another small depôt flag close to the
open sea a few yards back from the edge of the ice cliff.</p>
<p>Soon after we had turned into our sleeping-bag, a gentle
blizzard started to blow from west by south. This continued all
night, increasing in intensity in the morning. We were able to
see great whale-backed clouds, very much like those with which we
had been familiar over Mount Erebus, forming over Mount Nansen.
As this blizzard wind was blowing partly against us, we decided
that we would wait until it had either slackened off or decreased
in force.</p>
<p>The whole of the next day, unfortunately, the blizzard
continued. The sun was very hot, and as the result of its heat we
were to-day for the first time subject to a new trouble. The
blizzard, of course, drifted snow all over our tent; and a strong
thaw set in on the side of it which faced the sun. The wind,
flapping the canvas of the tent against the tent-poles, brought
the thaw water through on to the poles facing the sun. Inside the
tent, however, the temperature was just below freezing-point, and
as the water started to trickle down the poles it froze. With the
flapping of the tent backwards and forwards against the
tent-poles, the small ridge of ice on the upper surface of each
tent-pole became drawn out into sharp, saw-like teeth, and these
started cutting through the canvas. All through this day,
consequently, we had to be continually getting out of the
sleeping-bag and running our hands down the tent-poles so as to
rub off the ice teeth.</p>
<p>The blizzard continued till midnight of December 15-16, when
its force markedly decreased. We breakfasted accordingly just
after midnight. I dug out the sledge from the snow which had
drifted over it, and Mackay cached some seal meat in an adjoining
ice mouth. At last, about 7 <span class="uu">a.m.</span>, we made
a start and were delighted to find that, chiefly as the result of
the three days' rest in camp, we were able to pull our
sledge&mdash;weighing about 670 lb.&mdash;with comparative ease.
The snow, though soft, had become crusted over the surface
through the thaw brought on by the blizzard, followed by freezing
during the succeeding cold night. The sledging was certainly
heavy, but not nearly so distressing as that which we had
recently experienced in crossing the Drygalski Glacier. The
"tablecloth was being laid on the top of Mount Nansen in the form
of a remarkable flattish thin white fleecy cloud. It looked as
though a high-level blizzard was blowing over the summit. We
steered towards the great black nunatak midway between Mount
Nansen and Mount Larsen, as Mawson and Mackay both considered
that in this direction lay our chief hope of finding a practical
route to the high plateau.</p>
<p>On December 17 we had a very interesting day. The sledging was
rather heavy, being chiefly over soft snow and pie-crust snow. It
was difficult to decide sometimes whether we were on fresh-water
ice or on sea ice. Here and there we crossed ice ridges,
evidently pressure ridges of some kind. These would be traversed
by crevasses which showed the ice in such places to be at least
thirty to forty feet in thickness. Close to our final
camping-ground for the day was a long shallow valley or barranca;
it was from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty
yards in width. The near side was steep, though not too steep for
us to have let our sledge down; but the far side was precipitous,
being bounded by an overhanging cliff from twenty to thirty feet
high. The floor of this valley was deeply and heavily crevassed.
This sunken valley, therefore, formed a serious obstacle to our
advance.</p>
<p>While Mackay was preparing the hoosh Mawson travelled to the
right, and I to the left along this valley seeking for a possible
crossing place. At last Mawson found a narrow spot where there
had been an ice bridge over the valley, but this had become
cracked through at the centre. It was nevertheless strong enough
to bear our sledge. Near this ice bridge Mawson stated that he
noticed muddy material containing what appeared to be
foraminifera, squeezed up from below. The day had been calm and
clear, and we were able to get detailed sketches of this part of
the coast range.</p>
<p>The following day we made for the ice bridge with our sledge,
and found that the crack crossing it had opened to a width of
eighteen inches during the night. The far side had become too,
somewhat higher than the near side. We had little difficulty in
getting the sledge over, and after crossing several other cracks
in the ice and névé without mishap reached once more a fairly
level surface. A light plateau wind was now blowing from off the
Mount Nansen glacier. The hard snow surface was furrowed by two
very definite sets of sastrugi, one set coming from a
south-westerly direction, and apparently caused by blizzard wind,
the other from nearly north-west. The latter were evidently due
to strong rushes of cold air from the high plateau down the broad
valley occupied by the Mount Nansen glacier. That day we passed
over a series of pressure ridges with their steeper sides
directed towards the north-west. At the bottom of these steep
slopes the ice was often crevassed, and sometimes we had some
little difficulty in crossing them. They were probably due to
pressure from the Drygalski Glacier.</p>
<p>At lunch time, soon after midnight, we reached some very
interesting glacial moraines in the form of large to small
blocks, mostly of eruptive rock, embedded in the ice. It was
probable, from their general distribution, that they formed part
of an old moraine of Mount Nansen, though now about fifteen miles
in advance of the present glacier front. A conspicuous rock
amongst the boulders was a greenish-grey to greenish-black
diorite, very rich in sphene. The brown crystals of sphene were
frequently intercrystallised with the felspars, and gave the rock
a very pretty appearance. Small fragments of sandstone and clay
shale were also represented in these moraines. The larger blocks
were up to seven feet in diameter, and formed chiefly of reddish
porphyritic granite. We collected a number of specimens from this
moraine.</p>
<p>Fine rolls of cumulus clouds were gathering to our north-east.
The day was calm with occasional gleams of sunshine. After the
plateau wind had died down about 2 <span class="uu">p.m.</span>
it commenced to snow a little, the snow coming from between
south-west and west-south-west.</p>
<p>At midnight on December 19 we started sledging in the falling
snow, guided partly by the direction of the wind, partly by that
of the pressure ridges and crevasses, occasionally taking compass
bearings. Before we had gone far we reached a tide-crack with
open water three to four feet wide. There was also a width of
about eighteen feet of recently formed thin ice at this
tide-crack. We tasted the water in this crack and found that it
was distinctly salt. It was clear then that at this part of our
journey we were travelling over sea ice. About half a mile
further on we reached another open tide-crack, and had to make a
considerable <i>détour</i> in order to get over it. The surface
of the ice was now thawing, and we trudged through a good deal of
slushy snow, with here and there shallow pools of water as blue
as the Blue Grotto of Capri. On the far side of this second
tide-crack, and beyond the blue pools, we reached a large
pressure ridge forming a high and steep scarped slope barring our
progress. Its height was about eighty feet. There was nothing for
it, if we were to go forward, but to drag our heavy sledge up
this steep slope. It was extremely exhausting work, and we were
forced to halt a few times, and had to take the sledge
occasionally somewhat obliquely up the slope where it was very
steep. In such cases the sledge frequently skidded. Our troubles
were increased by the fact that this ice slope was traversed by
numerous crevasses, which became longer and wider the further we
advanced in this direction.</p>
<p>At last we got to the slope, only to see in the dim light that
there were a succession of similar slopes ahead of us, becoming
continually higher and steeper. The ice, too, became a perfect
network of crevasses, some of which were partly open, but most of
them covered over with snow lids. Suddenly, when crossing one of
these snow lids, just as he was about to reach the firm ice on
the other side, there was a slight crash and Mawson instantly
disappeared from sight. Fortunately the toggle at the end of his
sledge rope held, and he was left swinging in the empty space
between the walls of the crevasse, being suspended by his harness
attached to the sledge rope. Mackay and I hung on to the rope in
case it should part at the toggle, where it was somewhat worn.
Meanwhile, Mawson called out from below to pass him down the
Alpine rope. Leaving Mackay to keep hold of the toggle end of
Mawson's harness rope, I hurried back to the sledge, which was
about ten feet behind, and just as I was trying to disengage a
coil of rope Mawson called out that he felt he was going. I ran
back and helped Mackay to keep a strain on Mawson's harness rope.
Mawson then said that he was all right. Probably at the time he
felt he was going the rope had suddenly cut back through the lid
of the crevasse and let him down for a distance of about a couple
of feet. Altogether he was about eight feet down below the level
of the snow lid. While I now held on to Mawson's harness rope
Mackay hurried back to the sledge, and with his Swedish knife cut
the lashing around the Alpine rope, and started uncoiling it,
making a bowline at the end in which Mawson could put his foot.
Meanwhile Mawson secured some ice crystals from the side of the
crevasse, and threw them up for examination. The Alpine rope
having been lowered, Mawson put his foot into the bowline and got
Mackay to haul his leg up as high as his bent knee would allow it
to go, then, calling to him to hold tight the rope, Mawson,
throwing the whole weight of his body on to it, raised himself
about eighteen inches by means of his arms so as to be able to
straighten his right leg. Meanwhile, I took in the slack of his
harness rope. He then called to me to hold tight the harness
rope, as he was going to rest his whole weight on that, so as to
take the strain off the Alpine rope. Mackay then was able to pull
the Alpine rope up about eighteen inches, which had the effect of
bending up Mawson's right leg as before. Mackay then held fast
the Alpine rope, and Mawson again straightened himself up on it,
resting his whole weight on that rope. Thus little by little he
was hoisted up to the under surface of the snow lid, but as his
harness rope had cut back a narrow groove in this snow lid
several feet from where the snow gave away under him Mawson now
found his head and shoulders pressing against the under side of
the snow lid, and had some difficulty in breaking through this in
order to get his head out. At last the top of his head emerged, a
sight for which Mackay and I were truly thankful, and presently
he was able to get his arms up, and soon his body followed, and
he got safely out on the near side of the crevasse. After this
episode we were extra cautious in crossing the crevasses, but the
ice was simply seamed with them. Twice when our sledge was being
dragged up ice-pressure ridges it rolled over sideways with one
runner in a crevasse, and once the whole sledge all but
disappeared into a crevasse, the snow lid of which had partly
collapsed under its weight. Had it gone down completely it would
certainly have dragged the three of us down with it, as it
weighed nearly one-third of a ton. It was clear that these
high-pressure ridges and numerous crevasses were caused now, not
by the Drygalski, but by the Nansen Glacier.</p>
<p>It was now somewhat foggy, but occasionally the fog and mist
lifted, and in the distance one caught glimpses of magnificent
cliffs of reddish brown granite, with wisps and wreathes of white
mist hanging around the summits. The view reminded me of the
Grampians in Scotland near Ossian's Cave at the Pass of Glencoe.
Later on in the day we saw in the dim light that we had before us
a long steep descent into an ice valley, which appeared to be
heavily crevassed at the bottom. As we were uncertain whether we
could get across it at this spot we left our tent and sledge, and
reconnoitred ahead, taking with us the Alpine rope and our
ice-axes. We found a way of crossing this valley, but could see
that the ice-surface ahead of us was apparently worse than ever.
We returned to our tent and sledge, and put up the tent, and
chopped lumps of ice off the glacier with which to load the
skirt, as no snow was available at the time. It was just
commencing to snow, and wind was freshening from the south-west.
We were now in a perfect labyrinth of crevasses and pressure
ridges. Snow continued falling heavily accompanied by a blizzard
wind for the rest of that day and the whole of the succeeding
night. Inside the tent we experienced some discomfort through the
dripping of water caused by the thawing snow. As usual during a
blizzard the temperature rose, and although the sun's heat rays
were partly intercepted by the falling snow quite sufficient
warmth reached the side of the tent nearest the sun to produce
this thaw. Pools of water lodged on the foot of our sleeping-bag,
but we were able to keep the head of it fairly dry by fixing up
our Burberry blouses and trousers across the poles on the inside
of the tent so as to make a temporary waterproof lining just
above our heads. We were all thoroughly exhausted, and slept
until about 7 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> the following day,
December 20. By that time the snow cleared off.</p>
<p>About six inches of snow had fallen, and was lying deeply
drifted in places. We dug away the drift snow from around the
sledges, and after the morning hoosh held a council of war. The
question was whether we should continue pulling on in the
direction of the nunatak rising from the Mount Nansen Glacier, or
whether we should retreat and try some other way which might lead
us to the plateau. Mackay was in favour of hauling ahead over the
Mount Nansen Glacier, while Mawson and I favoured retreat, and
trying a passage in some other direction.</p>
<p>At last we decided to retreat. Our fortunes now, so far as the
possibility of reaching the Magnetic Pole were concerned, seemed
at a low ebb. It was already December 20, and we knew that we had
to be back at our depôt on the Drygalski Glacier not later than
February 1 or 2, if there was to be a reasonable chance of our
being picked up by the <i>Nimrod</i>. We had not yet climbed more
than 100 ft. or so above sea-level, and even this little altitude
was due to our having climbed ice-pressure ridges, which from
time to time dipped down again to sea-level. We knew that we had
to travel at least 480 to 500 miles before we could hope to get
to the Magnetic Pole and back to our depôt, and there remained
only six weeks in which to accomplish this journey, and at the
same time we would have yet to pioneer a road up to the high
plateau. Now that everything was buried under soft snow it was
clear that sledging would be far slower and more laborious than
ever. We soon proved that this was the case, for after starting
the sledge it gathered masses of soft snow around it and under it
as it went, and at the end of 200 yards we had to halt for a
temporary rest, hoist the sledge up on one side and knock away
the masses of clogged snow from underneath it. This had to be
repeated every few hundred yards, and after we had gone half a
mile we decided to leave the sledge and go ahead with ice-axes
and Alpine rope to reconnoitre.</p>
<p>We started off in a south-westerly direction with the
intention of seeing whether the Mount Bellingshausen Glacier
slope would be more practicable for our sledges than the Mount
Nansen Glacier. We trudged through soft thawing snow with here
and there shallow pools of water on the surface of the ice. This,
of course, saturated our socks, which froze as the temperature
fell during the night. After proceeding about two and a half
miles we observed with the field-glasses that the foot of the
Mount Bellingshausen Glacier was not only steep but broken and
rugged. We decided to examine what appeared to be a narrow
stretch of snow mantling around the base of a granite mountain,
one of the offshoots from the Mount Larsen massif. After crossing
a good deal of pressure ice and crevasses, and floundering
amongst the boulders of old moraines we reached some shallow
lakes of thawed snow near the junction between the sea ice and
the foot of the snow slope for which we had been steering. In the
neighbourhood of the moraines, which here consisted of great
blocks of eruptive rock partly or wholly imbedded in ice, the
blocks became so warmed up by the sun's heat that they partially
thawed the ice around, and in some cases above them: and so when
one stepped near one of these blocks, or over a concealed block,
the ice gave way with a crash letting one down a depth of from
one to three feet. At one place, before reaching the shallow
lakes, we found quite a strong stream of water flowing just under
the surface of the ice. This was evidently supplied from thaw
water from the slopes near the shore-line.</p>
<p>After paddling, unwillingly, in the shallow lakes we reached
the foot of what proved now to be not a snow slope but a small
branch glacier. This was covered with a considerable depth of
soft newly drifted snow, and we found the ascent in consequence
very tiring as we sunk at each step in the soft snow over our
knees. At last we attained an altitude of 1200 ft. above
sea-level, and were then high enough to see that the upper part
of this branch glacier joined the Mount Bellingshausen Glacier at
about 800 ft. higher and some half mile further on. We were well
pleased with this discovery, but as the glacier front ascended
about 1500 ft. in less than a mile we did not look forward to the
task of getting our heavy sledge up this steep slope, encumbered
as it was with soft deep thawing snow.</p>

<p>On our return to the shore-line down the glacier slope we
discovered that it was slightly crevassed in places, though not
heavily so. At the foot of the glacier, and a short distance
towards our camp, we found a moraine gravel. This was intermixed
with a dark marine clay containing numerous remains of serpulæ,
pecten shells, bryozoa, foraminifera, &amp;c. Mackay also found a
perfect specimen of a solitary coral, allied to Delto-cyathus,
and also a Waldheimia. All these specimens were carefully
preserved and brought into camp. While we were collecting these
specimens we could hear the roar of many mountain torrents
descending the steep granite slopes of the great mountain mass to
the south of our branch glacier. Occasionally, too, we heard the
boom and crash of an avalanche descending from the high mountain
top. Such sounds were strange to our ears, accustomed so long to
the almost perfect solitude and silence of the Antarctic,
hitherto broken only by the bleating of baby seals and the call
of the penguins.</p>
<p>Mawson discovered in another part of the moraine, nearer to
our camp, a bright green mineral forming thin crusts on a very
pretty quartz and felspar porphyry. These we decided to examine
more carefully on the morrow. We were all thoroughly exhausted
after the day's work, and Mackay had a rather bad attack of
snow-blindness. For some time after we got into the sleeping-bag,
and before we dozed off, we could still hear the intermittent
roar of avalanches like the booming of distant artillery.</p>
<p>The following day, December 22, we picked our way with our
sledge cautiously amongst the crevasses and over the pressure
mounds, the traversing of which gave us some trouble in places,
and eventually reached a fairly good track along the ice parallel
to the moraine from which we had been collecting the day
previous. We found a large pool of thaw water on the surface of
the ice. This was fed by a sub-glacial stream coming from an old
rock moraine. We could hear this stream rolling the pebbles along
in its channel. At another point the moraine showed a remarkable
cone, which at first sight we took for a typical esker, but a
nearer examination revealed the fact that the whole cone, with
the exception of the exterior, was formed of solid ice with only
an outer coating of sand, mud and gravel associated with abundant
marine organisms similar to those collected by us the previous
day. We halted when we arrived opposite the green mineral
observed by Mawson the previous day. We collected a good deal of
this. At first sight we thought it was the common mineral
epidote, but its hardness and the fact that it had turned yellow,
where it was weathered, made this hypothesis untenable. The green
crusts formed by it were about one fourteenth to one-sixteenth of
an inch in thickness, and it was evidently fairly widely
distributed in that locality, as numerous large joint faces of
the quartz and felspar porphyry were completely coated with it. A
little further on we came upon an enormous silicious sponge,
eighteen inches by two feet in diameter, adhering firmly to one
of the moraine boulders. We secured specimens of this.</p>
<p>Altogether the locality was most fascinating, and we longed to
have been able to spend more time there. Amongst other
interesting problems was the question as to how the material of
the sea floor came to be uplifted here to a height of twenty to
thirty feet or more above sea-level, and as to how the marine
sediments came to be resting on an old conical surface of dense
ice. We tested the latter to see whether it was of salt-or of
fresh-water origin; it was not distinctly saline, though slightly
so&mdash;much as glacier ice would be if it were sprayed by the
sea. None of us could account for this curious phenomenon. It
seemed as though the marine muds had been subjected to
considerable pressure, as numbers of the fossils in it were
triturated and shattered. It is of course just possible that in
the forward movement of the Mount Nansen Glacier it may have
pushed up some of the sea bottom above sea-level, and still there
remains the question as to how masses of ice came to find their
way under the moraine sediments. It is possible that after an
extensive glaciation of this region the glacier ice from inland
spread over the spot where this moraine is now situated, but on
the retreat of the ice inland, while still a small thickness of
ice was left in this bay, a submergence ensued, and during that
submergence a marine mud was deposited over the ice together with
the larger organisms found in association with the mud. Then
there was an advance of the ice once more, and moraines of large
blocks of rock were laid down over the top of the moraine muds
and the relics of the ancient glacier ice. Then once more the ice
retreated to its present position leaving the moraine blocks and
moraine muds of the old ice in the relative situations
mentioned.</p>
<p>As we skirted the foot of the small branch glacier we noticed
several small puffs of snow near the top angle of the snow slope
which we proposed to escalade. Just as we were pulling our sledge
to the foot of this slope the puff of wind with drift snow
developed suddenly into a strong blizzard. We pulled in against
this with great difficulty for half an hour, then camped at the
foot of the slope. The blizzard with its heavy drift snow and the
occasional gleams of warm sunshine cast much drift over our tent
with accompanying thaw. Consequently inside the tent water
dripped heavily all over our clothing and sleeping-bag.
Fortunately we were just above the level of the thaw water of the
small lakes, but we could hear water trickling close underneath
our tent amongst the granite boulders of the moraines just under
the ice.</p>
<p>We were able now to economise fuel, as we could bale the water
out of these rock pools and streams for making our hoosh, tea and
cocoa. All that night the blizzard raged, and we thought any
moment that the tent would be ripped up from top to bottom. It
was getting very thin by this time and had already been
frequently repaired by Mackay and Mawson. On this occasion
several new rents started from near the top of the tent and
spread downwards. Moreover, the canvas cap of our tent was broken
by the force of the wind and the pressure of the drift snow.</p>
<p>The following day, about 7 <span class="uu">a.m.</span>, I got
up and dug away the drift snow from the lee side of the tent,
which was cramping our feet and legs, and found that it was still
snowing heavily outside, and blowing hard as well. In the
afternoon the blizzard slacked off somewhat, and the drift nearly
ceased. We got up accordingly and had a meal. We halved our
sledge load, repacked the sledge, and by dint of great exertions
dragged it up the steep snow and ice slope to a height of 800 ft.
above the sea. This was done in the teeth of a mild but
freshening blizzard. The blizzard at last got too strong for us,
so that we left the load at the altitude mentioned and returned
back to our tent with the empty sledge.</p>
<p>We had been pleased to find that the blizzard, although it had
delayed us and damaged our tent, had proved a blessing in
disguise. It had not brought with it much fresh snow, but had
blown away most of the loose snow left by the preceding blizzard,
leaving behind it now a fairly hard snow surface suitable for
sledging.</p>
<p>Mackay's eyes, still suffering from the effects of
snow-blindness, were treated with a solution of thin tabloids
(laminæ) of sulphate of zinc and cocaine, with the result that
his eyes were much better the following day, December 25. This
day there was still a strong breeze coming off the plateau, and
sweeping over our tent. A little later in the morning the weather
became calm, and a glorious sunny day smiled upon us. Mawson and
Mackay repaired the rents in the tent, while I saw to repacking
of the sledge with the remaining half load, and collected some
geological specimens.</p>
<p>We started shortly before noon and commenced dragging up the
second part of our load to the accompaniment of the music of
murmuring streams. During our interval for lunch, Mawson was able
to get some theodolite angles. We had the great satisfaction,
when we turned in at 10 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> on Christmas
Eve, to find that we were above the uncomfortable zone of thaw,
and everything around us was once more crisp and dry, though
cold. Our spirits, too, mounted with the altitude. We were now
over 1200 ft. above sea-level.</p>

<br>
<p><b>THE</b> following day, December 25, was Christmas Day. When
I awoke, I noticed a pile of snow on top of the sleeping-bag
close to my head. At first, before I was fully awake, I imagined
that it was the moisture condensed from Mawson's breath. Then I
heard the gentle patter of snow-flakes, and, on turning my head
ill the direction in which the rustling proceeded, saw that the
wind had undermined the skirt of our tent, and was blowing the
snow in through a small opening it had made. Accordingly, I
slipped out and snowed up the skirt again, trampling the snow
down firmly. A plateau wind was now blowing with almost blizzard
force.</p>
<p>About two hours later we got up, and, after some trouble with
the Primus lamp on account of the wind, had our breakfast, but,
as the wind was blowing dead against us, we turned into the
sleeping-bag for a short time. It was nearly noon before the wind
died down, and we started off with our sledge, still relaying
with half loads, the day being now beautifully clear and sunny.
At the 1,300 ft. level we started our sledge meter again, having
lifted it off the ice while we were going up the steep slope. A
little further on we were able to put the whole of our load again
on to the sledge and so dispense with further relay work. This,
too, was a great blessing.</p>
<p>When we arrived at our spot for camping that night we had the
satisfaction of finding that we were over 2000 ft. above
sea-level, and that we had, in addition to the climbing,
travelled that day about four miles. The plateau wind had almost
gone, and once more we revelled in being not only high, but dry.
Having no other kind of Christmas gift to offer, Mawson and I
presented Mackay with some sennegrass for his pipe, his tobacco
having long ago given out. We slept soundly that Christmas
night.</p>
<p>On December 26 we observed dense dark snow clouds to the
north-east, and a little light snow commenced to fall, but
fortunately the weather cleared towards the afternoon. Mawson
lost one of his blue sweaters off the sledge, but he and Mackay
went back some distance and recovered it. Towards the afternoon
we found it necessary to cross a number of fairly large
crevasses. These were completed snowed over, and although we
frequently fell through up to our knees, we had no serious
trouble from them on this occasion. Some of them were from twenty
to thirty feet in width, and it was fortunate for us that the
snow lids were strong enough to carry safely the sledge and
ourselves. Mackay suggested, for greater security, fastening the
Alpine rope around Mawson, who was in the lead, and securing the
other end of it to the sledge. The rope was left just slack
enough to admit of the strain of hauling being taken by the
harness rope, hence Mawson had two strings to his bow in case of
being suddenly precipitated into a crevasse. This was a good
system, which we always adopted afterwards in crossing heavily
crevassed ice.</p>
<p>The following day, December 27, we decided to make a small
depôt of our ski-boots (as by this time it appeared we were
getting off the glacier ice on to hard snow and névé where we
should not require them) and also of all our geological
specimens, and about one day's food-supply, together with a small
quantity of oil&mdash;a supply for about two days in one of our
oil-cans. The following is a list of the provisions:</p>
<p class="margin2">Powdered cheese (enough for two meals).<br>
Tea (for four meals).<br>
Twenty-five lumps of sugar.<br>
Hoosh for one meal.<br>
Chocolate (for one and a half meals).<br>
Twelve biscuits.<br>
<br></p>
<p>We also left an empty biscuit tin into which we crammed our
ski-boots, and our three ice-axes, using one of them stuck
upright as a staff for a small blue flag to mark the depôt.
Mawson took some good bearings with the prismatic compass, and we
then proceeded on our way. This depôt we called the Larsen Depôt,
as it was close to one of the southern spurs of Mount Larsen.</p>
<p>All eyes were now strained, as we advanced with our sledge, to
see whether there was still any formidable range of mountains
ahead of us barring our path to the plateau. At one time it
seemed as though there was a high range in the dim distance, but
a careful examination and the field-glasses showed that this
appearance was due only to clouds. Our joy and thankfulness was
unbounded when we at last realised that apparently there was now
a fairly easy ascent of hard névé and snow on to the plateau.
That day we sledged a little over ten miles. During the night
there was a very strong radiant in the sky from about south-west
to north-east, with a movement of alto-stratus cloud from
north-west to south-east. Therefore, probably, this radiant was
due to formation of great rolls of cloud curled over by the
anti-trade wind as it pressed forward in a south-easterly
direction. The rolls of clouds were distinctly curved convexly
towards the south-east.</p>
<p>The following day, December 28, we travelled on
north-westwards in thick cloudy weather, at first quite calm. At
about 10 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> a breeze set in from the
sea, spreading westwards over the top of Mount Nansen over 8000
ft. above sea-level. Above Nansen it met the upper current wind
and was obviously deflected by it in a south-easterly direction.
Meanwhile, in the direction of the coast the sky was very dark
and lowering, and probably snow was falling there. Remarkable
pillars of cloud formed over the Mount Larsen group. These were
photographed by Mawson. We passed over occasional patches of
nearly bare glacier ice, alternating with stretches of hard névé.
When we camped that evening we had sledged a little over ten
miles, and a keen, cold wind was blowing gently off the high
plateau to our west.</p>
<p>The following day, December 29, was clear, calm and cold. At
noon a pretty strong wind was blowing off the plateau. The
surface of the snow was fairly strongly ridged with sastrugi. One
set was made by winds coming from between west-south-west and
west by north, the other by winds nearly north-westerly, or
between west-30°-north and west-40°-north. As this latter bearing
was not far off the direction in which we were travelling, we
were able from time to time to follow these minor sastrugi, which
were thus of considerable help to us in bringing over the
sastrugi more oblique to the direction in which we were
travelling.</p>
<p>The following day, December 30, Mounts Larsen and
Bellingshausen were disappearing below the horizon, and several
mountains were showing up clearly and sharply to the north of us,
the principal peaks of which were at first identified by us as
Mount New Zealand and Mount Queensland of Captain Scott's chart.
Later Mawson concluded that the western of the two at any rate
was new and unnamed.</p>
<p>There was still a strong plateau wind. We were now at an
altitude of about 4500 ft. Once more, as in winter time, our
breath froze into lumps of ice, cementing our Burberry helmets to
our beards and moustaches. In putting up the tent for lunch in
the strong plateau wind, it became badly torn near the cap piece.
This wind had started before midnight on the previous night, and
was blowing strongly until the afternoon, at from twelve to about
fifteen miles an hour. It carried along with it a little low
drift. The plateau wind did not die down until the evening. Our
distance travelled was eleven miles, and we were still travelling
on an up grade, being now nearly 5000 ft. above sea-level.</p>
<p>December 31 passed off without any special event other than
that after Mackay had repaired the tent in the morning it became
torn again at lunch-time when we were fitting it over the
tent-poles. Mawson took a fresh set of magnetic observations. We
camped for this purpose at the bottom of a wide undulation in the
névé surface. We were disappointed at his announcement that he
made out that the Magnetic Pole was further inland than had been
originally estimated. What with the observations with the
Lloyd-Creak dip circle, and the time occupied in repairing the
rents in the tent, we ran ourselves somewhat short of time for
our sledging that day, and did not camp until a little before
midnight. We were still dragging the sledge on an up grade; the
surface was softer and more powdery than before, and the sastrugi
heavier. Also since the previous Tuesday we had been obliged to
put ourselves on somewhat shorter rations than before, as we had
to take one-eighth of our rations out in order to form an
emergency food-supply in the event of our journey to and from the
Magnetic Pole proving longer than we originally anticipated.</p>
<p>That night, about a mile before reaching camp, we sighted to
the west of us, much to our surprise, some distinct ice falls.
This showed us that the snow desert over which we were travelling
had still some kind of creeping movement in it. A skua gull came
to visit us this New Year's Eve. He had been following us up for
some time in the distance, mistaking us, perhaps, for seals
crawling inland to die, as is not infrequently the habit of these
animals. We were now about eighty miles inland from the nearest
open water. Being disappointed of his high hopes, he left us
after that day and we saw him again no more. The run for the day
was about ten miles. We felt very much exhausted when we turned
into our sleeping-bag that night.</p>
<p>January 1, 1909 (New Year's Day), was a beautiful calm day
with a very light gentle plateau wind, with fairly high
temperature. The sky was festooned in the direction of Mount
Nansen with delicate wispy cirrus clouds converging in a
north-east direction. Later on, towards the evening, it was
evident that these cirrus clouds were strongly bent round from
south-west in a northerly direction. Possibly this bending with
the concave side to the west-north-west was due to the pressure
at a high level of the anti-trade wind blowing towards the
east-south-east. Mawson took observations for latitude and for
magnetic deviation at noon. He made our latitude at noon to be
74° 18'. That night Mawson gave us a grand hoosh and a rich pot
of cocoa in celebration of New Year's Day. We all thoroughly
enjoyed this meal after our exhausting march.</p>
<p>On January 2 we noticed that the sastrugi were gradually
swinging round into a direction a little north of west. The snow
was frequently soft in large patches, which made sledging very
heavy. We ascended altogether about 290 ft., but we crossed a
large number of broad undulations, the troughs of which were from
thirty to forty feet below their crests. These undulations
considerably increased the work of sledging, and the loose
patches of snow were so very soft and powdery that the runners of
our sledge sunk deeply into them, so that it was only with our
utmost efforts that we were able that day to finish our usual ten
miles. Again we were much exhausted when the time came for
camping. We were beginning to suffer, too, from hunger, and would
have liked more to drink if we could have afforded it. We talked
of what we would have drunk if we had had the chance. Mackay said
he would have liked to drink a gallon of buttermilk straight off;
Mawson would have preferred a big basin of cream; while I would
have chosen several pots of the best coffee with plenty of hot
milk.</p>
<p>We were still climbing on January 3, having ascended another
500 ft. It proved the heaviest day's sledging since we reached
the plateau. The snow was still softer than on the previous day,
and the surface was more undulating than ever, the troughs of the
undulations being about fifty feet below the crests. The sastrugi
themselves were from two to three feet in height. The crests of
the large undulations were usually formed of hard snow, the
strong winds having blow any loose material off them. This loose
material had accumulated to some depth in the troughs, and hence
made the wide patches of soft snow which made our sledge drag so
heavily as we crossed them. By dint of great efforts we managed
to finish our ten miles for that day.</p>
<p>The next day, January 4, we were pleased to find that there
was less up grade than on the previous day. We were now at an
altitude of over 6000 ft., and found respiration in the cold,
rarified air distinctly trying. It was not that we suffered
definitely from mountain sickness, but we felt weaker than usual
as the result, no doubt, of the altitude combined with the cold.
Towards evening, large clouds developed, much like the whale-back
clouds which we had often observed forming over Erebus about the
time of blizzards. Great rolls of cumulus spread rapidly from the
north-west towards the south-east, and we feared that a blizzard
was impending. On the whole the sledging was a little easier
to-day than the preceding day, and again we managed to do our ten
miles.</p>
<p>On the morning of January 5 we found the sky thickly overcast,
except to the south and the south-east, where clear strips of
blue were showing. We thought that snow was coming. The weather
was perfectly calm, comparatively warm, but the light dull. We
could still see the new inland mountain and Mount New Zealand
distinctly. The sun was so oppressively hot when it peeped out
from behind the clouds that one could feel it burning the skin on
one's hands.</p>
<p>The surface was more marked by sastrugi than ever, but on the
whole firm. We sledged ten miles. I will quote from my diary the
notes regarding some succeeding days.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 6.&mdash;To-day the weather was gloriously
fine. Bright, warm sunshine with a crisp, cold air in the early
morning and the weather almost calm. The pulling was rather heavy
during the afternoon; possibly the hot sun may have somewhat
softened the surface of the snow. This morning I left off my
crampons and put on a new pair of finnesko. These latter proved
somewhat slippery, and in falling heavily this afternoon over one
of the sastrugi I slightly strained some muscles on the inner
side of my left leg, just below the knee. This gave me a
considerable amount of pain for the rest of the journey. Mackay
lost all his stockings and socks off the bamboo pole of the
sledge, but was fortunate enough to recover them after walking
back over a mile on our tracks.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 7.&mdash;We were up at 5 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span>, when the temperature was minus 13° Fahr. We
were anxious to arrive at the end of our first five miles in good
time for Mawson to get a meridian altitude, and take theodolite
angles to the new mountain and Mount New Zealand, which were now
almost disappearing from view below the horizon. Mawson made our
latitude to-day 73° 43'. This was one of the coldest days we had
as yet experienced on the plateau, the wind blowing from west by
north. We all felt the pulling very much to-day, possibly because
it was still slightly uphill, and probably partly on account of
mountain lassitude. The distance travelled was ten miles.</p>
<p><i>Friday, January</i> 8.&mdash;To-day, also, was bitterly
cold. The wind blew very fresh for some little time before noon
from a direction of about west by north, raising much low drift.
Our hands were frost-bitten several times when packing up the
sledge. The cold blizzard continued for the whole day. At lunch
time we had great difficulty in getting up the tent, which became
again seriously torn in the process. Our beards were frozen to
our Burberry helmets and Balaclavas, and we had to tear away our
hair by the roots in order to get them off. We continued
travelling in the blizzard after lunch. Mawson's right cheek was
frost-bitten, and also the tip of my nose. The wind was blowing
all the time at an angle of about 45° on the port bow of our
sledge. We just managed to do our ten miles and were very
thankful when the time came for camping.</p>
<p>The following day, January 9, a very cold plateau wind was
still blowing, the horizon being hazy with low drift. We were now
completely out of sight of any mountain ranges, and were toiling
up and down amongst the huge billows of a snow sea. The silence
and solitude were most impressive. About 10.30 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span> a well-marked parhelion, or mock sun, due to
floating ice crystals in the air, made its appearance. It had the
form of a wide halo with two mock suns at either extremity of the
equator of the halo parallel to the horizon and passing through
the real sun. Mawson was able to make his magnetic deviation
observation with more comfort, as towards noon the wind slackened
and the day became gloriously bright and clear. In the afternoon
it fell calm.</p>
<p>We were feeling the pinch of hunger somewhat, and as usual our
talk, under these circumstances, turned chiefly on restaurants,
and the wonderfully elaborate dinners we would have when we
returned to civilisation. Again we accomplished our ten miles,
and were now at an altitude of over 7000 ft.</p>
<p>January 10 was also a lovely day, warm and clear; the snow
surface was good and we travelled quickly. There was a strong
"Noah's Ark" structure in the high-level cirrus clouds, there
being a strong radiant point respectively in the north-west and
south-east, and this made us somewhat apprehensive that we were
in for another blizzard. These cirrus clouds were also strongly
curved with the concave side of the curve facing the north-east.
We thought this curve was, perhaps, due to the anti-trade wind
bending round in a direction following that of the curve in the
wisps of cirrus.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 11.&mdash;We were up about 7 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span>, the temperature at that time being minus 12°
Fahr. It was a cold day to-day, and we had a light wind nearly
southerly. At first it blew from between south and
south-south-east; this gradually freshened at lunch time and
veered towards the west. It then returned again more towards the
south-south-east. Mawson had a touch of snow-blindness in his
right eye. Both he and Mackay suffered much through the skin of
their lips peeling off, leaving the raw flesh exposed. Mawson,
particularly, experienced great difficulty every morning in
getting his mouth opened, as his lips were firmly glued together
by congealed blood.</p>
<p>That day we did eleven miles, the surface being fairly firm,
and there being no appreciable general up grade now, but only
long-ridged undulations, with sastrugi. We noticed that these
sastrugi had now changed direction, and instead of trending from
nearly west, or north of west, eastwards, now came more from the
south-east directed towards the north-west. This warned us that
we might anticipate possibly strong head winds on our return
journey, as our course at the time was being directed almost
north-west, following from time to time the exact bearing of the
horizontal magnetic compass. The compass was now very sluggish,
in fact the theodolite compass would scarcely work at all. This
pleased us a good deal, and at first we all wished more power to
it; then amended the sentiment and wished less power to it. The
sky was clear, and Mawson got good magnetic meridian observations
by means of his very delicately balanced horizontal moving needle
in his Brunton transit instrument.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 12.&mdash;The sky to-day was overcast, the
night having been calm and cloudy. A few snowflakes and fine ice
crystals were falling. The sun was very hot and it somewhat
softened the snow surface, thereby increasing of course the
difficulty of sledging. We sledged to-day ten and three-quarter
miles.</p>
<p>The evening, after hoosh, Mawson, on carefully analysing the
results set forth in the advance copy of the <i>Discovery</i>
Expedition Magnetic Report, decided that although the matter was
not expressly so stated, the Magnetic Pole, instead of moving
easterly, as it had done in the interval between Sabine's
observations in 1841 and the time of the Discovery expedition in
1902. was likely now to be travelling somewhat to the north-west.
The results of dip readings taken at intervals earlier in the
journey also agreed with this decision. It would be necessary
therefore to travel further in that direction than we had
anticipated in order to reach our goal. This was extremely
disquieting news, for all of us as we had come almost to the
limit of our provisions, after making allowance for enough to
take us back on short rations to the coast. In spite of the
anxiety of the situation extreme weariness after sledging enabled
us to catch some sleep.</p>
<p>The following morning, January 13, we were up about 6
<span class="uu">a.m.</span> A light snow was falling, and fine
ice crystals made the sky hazy. There was a light wind blowing
from about south-south-east. About 8 <span class="uu">a.m.</span>
the sun peeped through with promise of a fine day. We had had
much discussion during and after breakfast as to our future
movements. The change in the position of the Pole necessitated of
course a change in our plans. Mawson carefully reviewed his
observations as to the position of the Magnetic Pole, and decided
that in order to reach it we would need to travel for another
four days. The horizontally moving needle had now almost ceased
to work. We decided to go on for another four days and started
our sledging. It was a cold day with a light wind. The
temperature at about 10.30 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> being
minus 6° Fahr. At noon Mawson took a magnetic reading with the
Lloyd-Creak dip circle, which was now fifty minutes off the
vertical, that is, 89° 10'. At noon the latitude was just about
73° South. The sastrugi were now longer and higher than usual,
and there were two distinct sets. The strongest sastrugi trended
from south to north; a subordinate set from south-east to
north-west. That day we sledged thirteen miles.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 14.&mdash;The day was gloriously clear and
bright with a warm sun. A gentle wind was blowing from about
south-south-east, and there was a little cumulus cloud far ahead
of us over the horizon. The surface of the snow over which we
were sledging was sparkling with large reconstructed ice
crystals, about half an inch in width and one-sixteenth of an
inch in thickness. These crystals form on this plateau during
warm days when the sun's heat leads to a gentle upward streaming
of the cold air with a small amount of moisture in it from
beneath. Under these influences combined with the thawing of the
surface snow, these large and beautiful ice crystals form rapidly
in a single day. We observe that after every still sunny day a
crop of these crystals develops on the surface of the névé, and
remains there until the next wind blows them off. They form a
layer about half an inch in thickness over the top of the névé.
In the bright sunlight the névé, covered with these sheets of
bright reflecting ice crystals, glittered like a sea of diamonds.
The heavy runners of our sledge rustled gently as they crushed
the crystals by the thousand. It seemed a sacrilege. The sastrugi
were large and high, and our sledge bumped very heavily over them
with a prodigious rattling of our aluminium cooking-gear. It was
clear that the blizzard winds blow over this part of the plateau
at times with great violence. Apparently all the winds in this
quarter, strong enough to form sastrugi, blow from south or west
of south or from the south-east. Our run to-day was twelve miles
one hundred and fifty yards.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 15.&mdash;We were up to-day at 6 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span> and found a cold southerly breeze blowing, the
temperature being minus 19° Fahr. at 6.30 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span> Mawson got a good latitude determination to-day,
72° 42'.</p>
<p>At about twenty minutes before true noon Mawson took magnetic
observations with the dip circle, and found the angle now only
fifteen minutes off the vertical, the dip being 89° 45'. We were
very much rejoiced to find that we were now so close to the
Magnetic Pole. The observations made by Bernacchi, during the two
years of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition's sojourn at their
winter quarters on Ross Island, showed that the amplitude of
daily swing of the magnet was sometimes considerable. The
compass, at a distance from the Pole, pointing in a slightly
varying direction at different times of the day, indicates that
the polar centre executes a daily round of wanderings about its
mean position. Mawson considered that we were now practically at
the Magnetic Pole, and that if we were to wait for twenty-four
hours taking constant observations at this spot the Pole would,
probably, during that time, come vertically beneath us. We
decided, however, to go on to the spot where he concluded the
approximate mean position of the Magnetic Pole would lie. That
evening the dip was 89° 48'. The run for the day was fourteen
miles.</p>
<p>From the rapid rate at which the dip had been increasing
recently, as well as from a comparison of Bernacchi's magnetic
observations, Mawson estimated that we were now about thirteen
miles distant from the probable mean position of the South
Magnetic Pole. He stated that in order to accurately locate the
mean position possibly a month of continuous observation would be
needed, but that the position he indicated was now as close as we
could locate it. We decided accordingly, after discussing the
matter fully that night, to make a forced march of thirteen miles
to the approximate mean position of the Pole on the following
day, put up the flag there, and return eleven miles back on our
tracks the same day. Our method of procedure on this journey of
twenty-four miles is described in the journal of the following
day.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, January</i> 16.&mdash;We were up at about 6
<span class="uu">a.m.</span> and after breakfast we pulled on our
sledge for two miles. We then depôted all our heavy gear and
equipment with the exception of the tent, sleeping-bag, Primus
stove and cooker, and a small quantity of food, all of which we
placed on the sledge together with the legs of the dip circle and
those of the theodolite to serve as marks. We pulled on for two
miles and fixed up the legs of the dip circle to guide us back on
our track, the compass moving in a horizontal plane being now
useless for keeping us on our course. At two miles further we
fixed up the legs of the theodolite, and two miles further put up
our tent, and had a light lunch. We then walked five miles in the
direction of the Magnetic Pole so as to place us in the mean
position calculated for it by Mawson, 72° 25' South latitude,
155° 16' East longitude. Mawson placed his camera so as to focus
the whole group, and arranged a trigger which would be released
by means of a string held in our hands so as to make the exposure
by means of the focal plane shutter. Meanwhile, Mackay and I
fixed up the flag-pole. We then bared our heads and hoisted the
Union Jack at 3.30 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> with the words
uttered by myself in conformity with Lieutenant Shackleton's
instructions, "I hereby take possession of this area now
containing the Magnetic Pole for the British Empire." At the same
time I fired the trigger of the camera by pulling the string.
Thus the group were photographed in the manner shown on the
plate. The blurred line connected with my right hand represents
the part of the string in focus blown from side to side by the
wind. Then we gave three cheers for his Majesty the King.</p>

<p>There was a pretty sky at the time to the north of us with low
cumulus clouds, and we speculated at the time as to whether it
was possible that an arm of the sea, such as would produce the
moisture to form the cumulus, might not be very far distant. In
view of our subsequent discovery of a deep indent in the
coast-line in a southerly direction beyond Cape North, it is
possible that the sea at this point is at no very considerable
distance.</p>
<p>The temperature at the time we hoisted the flag was exactly 0°
Fahr. It was an intense satisfaction and relief to all of us to
feel that at last after so many days of toil, hardship and danger
we had been able to carry out our leader's instructions, and to
fulfil the wish of Sir James Clarke Ross that the South Magnetic
Pole should be actually reached, as he had already in 1831
reached the North Magnetic Pole. At the same time we were too
utterly weary to be capable of any great amount of exultation. I
am sure the feeling the was uppermost in all of us was one of
devout and heartfelt thankfulness to the kind Providence which
had so far guided our footsteps in safety to that goal. With a
fervent "Thank God" we all did a right-about turn, and as quick a
march as tired limbs would allow back in the direction of our
little green tent in the wilderness of snow.</p>
<p>It was a weary tramp back over the hard and high sastrugi and
we were very thankful when at last we saw a small dark cone,
which we knew was our tent, rising from above the distant snow
ridges. On reaching the tent we each had a little cocoa, a
biscuit and a small lump of chocolate. We then sledged slowly and
wearily back, picking up first the legs of the theodolite, then
those of the dip circle, and finally reached our depôt a little
before 10 <span class="uu">p.m.</span></p>
<p>In honour of the event we treated ourselves that night to a
hoosh, which though modest was larger in volume than usual, and
was immensely enjoyed. Mawson repacked the sledge after hoosh
time, and we turned into the sleeping-bag faint and weary, but
happy with the great load of apprehension of possible failure,
that had been hanging over us for so many weeks, at last removed
from our minds. We all slept soundly after twenty-four miles of
travel.</p>

<p><b>I CALLED</b> the camp at a little before 10 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span> the following morning. We now discussed the
situation and our chances of catching the <i>Nimrod</i>, if she
came in search of us along the coast in the direction of our
depôt on the Drygalski Glacier. We had agreed, before we decided
to do the extra four days' march to the shifted position of the
Magnetic Pole, that on our return journey we would do not less
than thirteen miles a day. At the Magnetic Pole we were fully 260
statute miles distant, as the skua flies, from our depôt on the
Drygalski Glacier. As we had returned eleven of these miles on
the day previous we still had 249 miles to cover. It was now
January 17, and the <i>Nimrod</i> was due to start to search for
us on February 1. As there was of course plenty of sunlight day
and night, we thought it quite possible that she might be up to
the Drygalski Glacier on February 2&mdash;possibly on the morning
of that day. We accordingly decided to try and make back to our
Drygalski depôt by February 1. This gave us fifteen days.
Consequently we would have to average sixteen and two-thirds
miles a day in order to reach the coast in the time specified.
This of course did not allow of any delay on account of
blizzards, and we had seen from the evidence of the large
sastrugi that blizzards of great violence must occasionally blow
in these quarters, and from the direction of the sastrugi during
our last few days' march it was clear that the dominant direction
of the blizzard would be exactly in our teeth. The prospect,
therefore, of reaching our depôt in the specified time did not
appear bright. Providentially we had most beautiful and glorious
weather for our start on January 17. It remained fine for the
whole day, and we were greatly favoured by a light wind which now
blew from between north-west and west-north-west&mdash;a
perfectly fair wind for our journey. In fact the wind changed
direction with us. It had helped us by blowing from the
south-east, just before we reached the Magnetic Pole, and now it
was blowing in the opposite direction, helping us home. That day,
in spite of the late start, we sledged sixteen miles.</p>
<p>On January 18 the weather again was fine, and we had a hard
day's sledging. Unfortunately Mawson's left leg became very lame
and pained him a good deal. There was a strong radiant in the
clouds towards the north-west, and we were a little apprehensive
of the wind in consequence. Our run for the day was sixteen miles
two hundred yards. This was the end of my week's cooking, and we
were able to indulge that night in a fairly abundant hoosh, also
in very milky and sweet cocoa, and Mackay admitted that he
actually felt moderately full after it for the first time since
we had left the Drygalski Depôt.</p>
<p>The following day, January 19, we boiled the hypsometer at our
camp, and found the level to be about 7350 ft. above the sea. The
boiling-point was 196.75° Fahr. There was a cold fresh wind
blowing from the south-east, a head wind for us, the temperature
at the time being minus 11° Fahr. There were still low cumulus
clouds to the north of us. The wind freshened in the afternoon to
a mild blizzard, and we found pulling against it very severe
work. That morning we had quite an unusual diversion. Mawson, who
is a bold culinary experimenter, being messman for the week,
tried the experiment of surreptitiously introducing a lump of
sugar into the pemmican. Mackay detected an unusual flavour in
the hoosh, and cross-questioned Mawson severely on the subject.
Mawson admitted a lump of sugar. Mackay was thereupon roused to a
high pitch of indignation, and stated that this awful state of
affairs was the result of going out sledging with "two
foreigners". This mild blizzard partly obliterated our old sledge
tracks by piling over them new sastrugi of fine hard snow. We had
a great struggle that day to make our sixteen miles, but
fortunately the blizzard slackened off towards 9 <span class=
"uu">p.m.</span>, and we just managed it.</p>
<p>Owing to some miscalculation, for which I was responsible, we
discovered that we had no tea for this week, our sixth week out,
unless we took it out of the tea-bag for the seventh week.
Accordingly we halved the tea in the seventh week bag, and
determined to collect our old tea-bags at each of our old camps
as we passed them, and boil these bags together with the small
pittance of fresh tea. And here I may mention the tastes of the
party in the matter of tea somewhat differed. Mackay liked his
tea thoroughly well and long boiled, whereas Mawson and I liked
it made by just bringing the water to the boil; as soon as we
smelt the aroma of tea coming from underneath the outer lid of
the cooker we used to shut off the Primus lamp immediately and
decant the tea into the pannikins. Mackay had always objected to
this procedure when we were sledging along the sea ice where
water boils at about 212° Fahr.; now, however, he had a strong
scientific argument in his favour for keeping the pot boiling for
a few minutes after the tea had been put in. He pointed out that
at our present altitude water boiled at just over 196° Fahr., a
temperature which he maintained was insufficient to extract the
proper juices and flavour from the tea, unless the boiling was
very much prolonged. Mawson, however, averred&mdash;on chemical
and physical grounds&mdash;that with the diminished atmospheric
pressure certain virtuous constituents of the tea could be
extracted at a lower temperature. The discussion was highly
scientific and exhilarating, though not very finite. It was
agreed as a compromise to allow the boiling to continue for three
or four minutes after the water had come to the boil before the
tea was poured out. As in our progress coastwards we were
continually coming upon more old tea-bags at our old camps, and
always collected these and did not throw away any that had been
used before we soon had quite an imposing collection of muslin
bags with old tea leaves, and with the thorough boiling that they
now got there was a strong flavour of muslin superadded to that
of old tea. Nevertheless this drink was nectar.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 20.&mdash;We were still able to-day to follow
our sledge tracks, which was a great blessing, the magnetic
needle being of so little use to us. We had the wind slightly
against us bringing up a little low drift. Again we made our
sixteen-mile run, though with great difficulty, for the wind had
been blowing freshly all day on our starboard bow.</p>
<p>In view of the good progress that we had made, and after
carefully calculating out the provisions left over, Mawson, who
was at this time messman, proposed that we should return to
nearly full rations, as we were becoming much exhausted through
insufficient food. This proposal was, of course, hailed with
delight.</p>
<p>On <i>January</i> 21 there was a light wind with low
temperature, clear sky and hot sun, which combined to consolidate
the surface over which we were sledging. By this time Mackay and
Mawson's raw lips, which had been cracked and bleeding for about
a fortnight previously, were now much better. Mawson's lame leg
had also improved. Again we did our sixteen-mile run.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 22.&mdash;We were up soon after 7 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span> It was a clear day with bright sunshine. The
wind started soon after 5 <span class="uu">a.m.</span>,
constantly freshening, as it usually did in this part of the
plateau, till about 3 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> Then it
gradually died down by about 10 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> The
temperature at 7.15 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> was minus 20°
Fahr., and at this altitude we found the wind at this temperature
very trying. To-day we had to sledge over a great deal of
pie-crust snow, which was very fatiguing. Again we did sixteen
miles. We had since the day before yesterday lost our old sledge
tracks. Mackay earned a pound of tobacco, to be given him when we
returned to civilisation, by being the first to make the "land
fall"&mdash;new mountain, west of Mount New Zealand&mdash;which
showed out now in the far distance very faintly a little to the
left of our course. It was a welcome sight to all of us. To-day
we sledged fifteen miles.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 23.&mdash;The weather was bright and cold with
a light southerly wind. This day was very fatiguing, the sledging
being over patches of soft snow and pie-crust snow. At the same
time we were conscious now that although we were sledging up and
down wide undulations we were on the whole going down hill, and
the new mountain was already showing up as an impressive massif.
The air was cold and piercing. Mawson's right leg was still
painful. That night we were all very much exhausted, and were
obliged to allow ourselves fully eight hours sleep. Our run was
sixteen miles.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 24.&mdash;To-day we had more heavy sledging
over a lot of pie-crust snow and soft snow. The wind was blowing
somewhat against us at about twelve miles an hour, the
temperature being minus 4 Fahr. in the afternoon. A low drift was
sweeping in waves over the snow desert; it was a desolate scene.
Later in the day we were cheered by the sight of Mount
Baxter.</p>
<p>Towards evening we had some discussion as to whether we were
following approximately our old outgoing tracks. Mackay thought
we were nearer to the new mountain than before, I thought we were
further to the south-west, Mawson, who was leading, contended
that we were pretty well on our old course. Just then I
discovered that we were actually on our old sledge tracks, which
showed up plainly for a short distance between the newly formed
sastrugi. This spoke volumes for Mawson's skill as a navigator.
Distance sledged sixteen miles.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 25.&mdash;It was blowing a mild blizzard. We
estimated at lunch time that we were about eighty and a half
miles distant now from our Mount Larsen Depôt. The temperature
during the afternoon was minus 3° Fahr. We all felt, as usual,
much fatigued after the day's sledging. For the past four or five
days we each took an Easton syrup tabloid for the last stage but
one before reaching camp, and this certainly helped to keep us
going. This evening the blizzard died down about 8 <span class=
"uu">p.m.</span>, and Mount Nansen was sighted just before we
camped.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 26.&mdash;We lost our old sledge tracks again
to-day. The weather turned cloudy in the afternoon, and the light
was very bad. We now reached a surface of hard marble-like névé,
which descended by short steep slopes. We did not at first
realise that we were about to descend what we had termed the Ice
Falls on the outward journey. Every now and then the sledge would
take charge and rush down this marble staircase, bumping very
heavily over the steps. Mawson and I frequently came heavy
croppers. Mawson put on crampons outside his finnesko to enable
him to get a grip of the slippery surface, but my crampons were
frozen so hard and so out of shape that I was unable to get them
on, so I followed behind and steadied the sledge as it continued
bumping its way down the marble steps. At last we reached once
more a flattened surface and camped. Our run for the day was
fourteen and a half miles.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 27.&mdash;This morning we all felt very slack
after the night spent in the closely covered sleeping bag, the
sky at the time being cloudy. Under these circumstances, as we
now had come down from our highest altitude by about 4000 ft.,
and the temperature of course, had somewhat risen, we felt
stifled and depressed. During the morning fine snow fell and the
weather was quite thick to the south and east of us. Mawson
steered us by the trend of the sastrugi. As the day wore on, the
weather cleared up and we had a good view of the new mountain,
Mount New Zealand, and Mount Baxter. The pulling at first was
very hard work, being up-hill, but later we had a good run down
hill to the spot where we camped for lunch. After lunch we
sledged down a still steeper slope, the sledge occasionally take
charge. At this spot Mackay partially fell into a crevasse.
To-day we were much cheered by the sight at last of Mount Larsen.
By the time we reached the spot where we camped that night we had
a good clear view of Larsen. The distance travelled was sixteen
miles. We were now only about forty miles from our Mount Larsen
Depôt.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 28.&mdash;We turned out of the sleeping-bag
to-day at about 6.30 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> A blizzard was
blowing, and after breakfast we had much difficulty in the cold
wind in getting up the mast and sail. Mackay, who usually did the
greater part of this work, got his hands rather badly
frost-bitten before our preparations were completed. We used the
thick green canvas floorcloth as a sail; the tent-poles served us
for a mast, and a piece of bamboo did duty as a yard.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing at, perhaps, about twenty-five miles an
hour, and as soon as we started the sledge, it began to travel at
such a hot pace that Mackay and Mawson, with their long legs,
were kept walking at the top of their speed, while I, with my
shorter ones, was kept on a jog trot. Occasionally, in an extra
strong puff of wind, the sledge took charge. On one of these
occasions it suddenly charged into me from behind, knocked my
legs from under me, and nearly juggernauted me. I was quickly
rescued from this undignified position under the sledge runners
by Mawson and Mackay. We had now arrived at a part of the plateau
where the monotonous level or gently undulating surface gave
place to sharp descents. It was necessary in these cases for one
of us to untoggle from the front of the sledge and to toggle on
behind, so as to steer and steady it. About noon, when we were in
full career, the bow of the sledge struck one of the high
sastrugi obliquely and the sledge was capsized heavily, but
fortunately nothing was broken. After righting the sledge we
camped for lunch.</p>
<p>At lunch, with a faint hope of softening the stern heart of
our messman for the week&mdash;Mackay&mdash;and inducing him to
give us an extra ration of food, I mildly informed him that it
was my birthday. He took the hint and we all fared sumptuously at
lunch and dinner that day. The day's run was twenty miles. It had
been one of the most fatiguing days that we had as yet
experienced, and we were all utterly exhausted when we turned
into our sleeping-bag at 8.30 <span class="uu">p.m.</span></p>
<p><i>January</i> 29.&mdash;We were up at about 8 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span>, and found that the plateau wind was still
blowing at a speed of about fifteen miles an hour. After our
experience of the preceding day we decided that we would not make
sail on the sledge, and as a matter of fact, found that pulling
the sledge in the ordinary way was far less wearing than the
sailing had proved the preceding day. We pulled on steadily hour
after hour, and Mounts Nansen and Larsen grew every moment
clearer and larger, and we began to hope that we might be able to
reach our depôt at Mount Larsen that night. After we had sledged
about ten miles, descending at a gentle grade all the way, we
found that there was a slight up grade in the snow surface
towards the foot of Mount Larsen, but it was not steep enough to
cause us any trouble. But later in the day Mawson's sprained leg
caused him a good deal of pain, and we had almost decided to camp
at a point nearly twenty miles from our preceding camp, when
Mackay's sharp eyes sighted, at a distance of about a mile, our
little blue flag, tied to the ice-axe at our depôt. We soon
reached the depôt, fixed up the tent, had a good hoosh, and
turned into the sleeping-bag past midnight.</p>
<p>We were up at 9 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> on January 30.
The day was sunny, but ominous clouds were gathering overhead as
well as to the south. After breakfast we collected the material
at our depôt, chiefly ski-boots, ice-axes, oil, a little food,
and geological specimens, and loaded these on to our sledge. We
found that, owing to the alternate thawing and freezing of the
snow at our depôt, our ski-boots were almost filled with solid
ice. The work of chipping out this ice proved a slow and tedious
job, and we did not get started until about 11 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span> Soon after we got going we found ourselves for a
time in a meshwork of crevasses. These were from a foot up to
about twenty feet in width. Nearly all of them were roofed over
with a hard layer of snow. The only visible evidence of the
existence of a crevasse was a slight depression in the snow
surface at the inner edges of the two walls bounding the
crevasses, the whole of the snow roof or lid being slightly
counter-sunk below the general level of the surrounding snow
surface.</p>
<p>This, however, was not always the case, and crevasses not
infrequently existed entirely concealed from view under a
perfectly smooth hard snow surface. On account of the fact, as
already explained, that the snow lids were thinner next to the
walls of the crevasse, and thicker towards a position central
between the walls, we always used to take care, if we could see
the little depression in the snow surface&mdash;a sure indication
of a crevasse&mdash;not to put our foot down near the edge of the
depression, but to alight on the snow lid some feet away from the
crevasse wall.</p>
<p>On stepping out on to one of these snow lids a large piece
suddenly gave way under me, and I was instantly precipitated into
the chasm below, but fortunately caught the Alpine rope under my
arm as I was falling; this broke the force of the jerk on my
sledge harness. I was down about six feet below the snow lid, and
Mawson and Mackay holding on to the harness and Alpine ropes
which were supporting me, I was able to climb out quickly, and we
resumed our journey. Shortly after this, and after crossing a
number of other crevasses, we discovered that the wheel of our
sledge meter had disappeared. Probably it had got into one of the
crevasses, and gone to the bottom. As we were now so close to the
end of our journey, the loss of this, which earlier in our
travels would have been a serious disaster, was not of much
importance. We had run about eight miles before this lunch,
previous to the loss of our sledge meter wheel. At lunch-time
Mawson compounded a wonderful new hoosh made out of seal liver,
pounded up with a geological hammer, and mixed with crushed
biscuit.</p>
<p>We had some discussion as to whether it would be better to
descend on to the sea ice by the old track up which we had come,
which we termed Backstairs Passage, or make down the main Larsen
Glacier to the point where it junctioned with the Drygalski
Glacier. Mackay was in favour of the former, Mawson and I of the
latter. Mackay thought the devil one knew was better than the
devil one didn't know, while Mawson and I feared that during the
thaw, which was rapidly breaking up the sea ice at the time when
we were ascending the plateau, the ice might have gone away from
the base of Backstairs Passage right up to the steep granite
cliffs of the coast. Had this been the case, and had we descended
by our old route, we should have had to retrace our steps and
become involved in a very arduous uphill piece of sledging
necessitating an ascent of at least 1000 to 1500 ft. in a
distance of a little over a mile. As subsequent events proved,
Mackay was right and we were wrong.</p>
<p>We held on down the main glacier with the imposing cliffs and
slopes of dark-red granite and blackish eruptive rock intermixed
with it close on our left. Mawson's leg was now so bad that it
was only with considerable pain and difficulty that he could
proceed, and both Mackay's and my eyes were affected a good deal
by snow-blindness and were painful. We found as we advanced that
at about six miles easterly from our lunch camp, the surface of
the Mount Larsen Glacier descended at a very steep angle.
Somewhat ahead to the right it was clear that, where it
junctioned with the Drygalski Glacier, it was seamed by enormous
crevasses and traversed by strong pressure ridges. We held on
with our sledge on a course which took us close to the north side
of the glacier. At last the descent became so steep that it was
with the utmost difficulty that we could hold the sledge back and
prevent its charging down the slope. We halted here and Mackay
went ahead to reconnoitre. Presently he came back and said that
the narrow strip of snow covering the glacier ice, near its
contact with the rocky cliffs on our left, was continuous right
down to the bottom of the slope, and he thought it was
practicable, if we made rope brakes for the runners on our
sledge, to lower it down this steep slope in safety. He fixed on
some brakes of brown tarred rope by just twisting the rope
spirally around the sledge runners. We then cautiously started
the sledge down the steepest bit of the slope, all of us ready to
let go in case the sledge took charge. The rope brake worked
wonders, and it was even necessary to put a slight pull on the
sledge in places in order to get it down the steep snow surface.
We had left the great crevasses and ice falls near the junction
of the Mount Larsen and Drygalski Glaciers a little to our
right.</p>
<p>We now found ourselves on an ice-surface quite unlike anything
which we had hitherto experienced. In the foreground were some
small frozen lakes close to the foot of the granite hills; on the
far side of the lakes were beautiful glacial moraines. All around
the lakes, and for a considerable distance up the ice slopes
descending towards them, the surface of the ice was formed of a
series of large thin anastomosing curved plates of ice. These
were pieced together in such a way as to form a pattern on a
large scale resembling the cups of some of the recent compound
corals, or the ancient extinct form known to geologists as
<i>Alveolites</i>. These curved ice plates or tiles sloped at an
angle of about 45°, and formed, of course, an immense obstruction
to sledging, as their sharp edges caught and held our sledge
runners. We found, too, that it was very distressing travelling
over this extraordinary surface, which, from a scenic point of
view, was exquisitely beautiful. As we stepped forwards, out feet
usually crashed through the ice tiles, and our legs were imbedded
in the formation up to our knees. Frequently, under these
circumstances, we would stumble forwards, and had some difficulty
in dragging our legs out. It was like sledging over a wilderness
of glass cucumber-frames set up at an angle of 45°. Another
moment one would find the tiles thick enough and strong enough to
support one, but their surfaces being at an angle of 45° to the
horizontal, our feet would slip down them sideways and we ran an
imminent risk of spraining our ankles. At every step we took we
did not know until after the event which of the above two
experiences would follow.</p>
<p>After sledging for a short distance over surfaces of this
kind, sloping somewhat steeply to the small lakes, we decided to
camp on the pale green ice of one of these lakes. Mawson tested
this ice and found that it was strong enough to hold, though
evidently of no great thickness. We sledged along this lake for a
few hundred yards to its north-east end. There was a little snow
here which would do for loading the skirt of our tent. By this
time the sky was thickly overcast. We fixed up the tent, chopping
little holes in the surface of the smooth ice, in which to socket
the ends of the tent-poles, and while Mackay cooked, Mawson and I
snowed the skirt. This was subsequent to a little reconnoitring
which we each did. It was 2 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> before
we camped on the lake ice, and 4 <span class="uu">a.m.</span>
before we turned into our sleeping-bag.</p>
<p>Close to our tent was the most beautiful lateral moraine which
we had yet discovered. It was formed of blocks of bright red
granite, together with quartz porphyries with much rusty stain
due to oxidation of iron pyrites, and masses of dark brown rocks,
more basic, perhaps of an intermediate character between granite
and diorite. We found that immediately to the right of us, in an
easterly direction&mdash;that is, directly between us and our
depôt on the Drygalski Glacier&mdash;were great pressure ridges
of ice, and a vast entanglement of crevasses. In fact, in that
direction the glacier seemed impassable. The only possible outlet
for us with our sledge appeared to be close alongside of the
lateral moraine at the point where the glacier ice joined it.
Even this route was obviously a very difficult one, and we
decided before we turned in that on the morrow we should have to
unload our sledge and make a portage, or a plurality of portages.
The ice on the small lake on which we were camped was only
between two and three inches thick, and had obviously formed
quite recently after the thaw. It commenced to thaw now under the
influence of the warmth of our sleeping-bag, as we lay in it, and
we found shallow pools of water all around us when we awoke the
next morning.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 31.&mdash;We were up about 11 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span>, having slept soundly after the very exhausting
work of our previous day's sledging. During the night it had
snowed heavily, there being fully from three to four inches of
newly fallen snow covering everything around us, and it was still
snowing while we were having breakfast. After breakfast the snow
nearly ceased, and we took half the load off our sledge and
started with the remainder to try and work a passage out of the
ice-pressure ridges of the combined Drygalski and Larsen Glaciers
on to the smoother sea ice, and eventually on to the Drygalski
Ice Barrier. While Mawson and Mackay pulled, I steadied the
sledge on the lower side in rounding the steep sidelings. We were
still sledging over the leafy or tile ice, which mostly crunched
underfoot with a sharp tinkling sound. We skirted the lateral
moraine for a distance of over half a mile, following a
depression in the ice-surface apparently produced by a stream,
the outlet of the waters of the small lakes. At one spot Mawson
crashed right through into the water beneath, and got wet up to
his thighs. In spite of my efforts to keep it on even keel, the
sledge frequently capsized on these steep sidelings. At last,
after struggling up and down heavy slopes, and over low-lying
areas of rotten ice, which every here and there let us through
into the water beneath, we arrived at the foot of an immense
ice-pressure ridge. It was a romantic-looking spot, though at the
time we did not exactly appreciate its beauties. To our left was
a huge cliff of massive granite rising up steeply to heights of
about 2000 ft. The combined pressure of the Drygalski and Mount
Larsen Glaciers had forced the glacier ice up into great ridges,
trending somewhat obliquely to the coast cliff.</p>
<p>We went back to the tent where we got some hot tea, of which
Mawson, particularly, was very glad, as he was somewhat cooled
down as the result of his wetting. Then we packed up the
remainder of our belongings on the sledge and dragged it down to
where we had dumped the half load on the near side of the
pressure ridge. Mackay reconnoitred ahead, and found that the
large-pressure ridge, which appeared to bar our progress towards
our depôt, gradually came nearer and nearer in to the granite
cliff, until it pressed hard against the cliff face. Obviously,
then, we were impounded by this huge pressure ridge, and would
have to devise some mean of getting over it. Taking our ice-axes
we smoothed a passage across part of the ridge. This proved a
very tough piece of work. We then unloaded the sledge and passed
each one of our packages over by hand. Finally we dragged the
sledge up and hoisted it over and lowered it down safely on the
other side. After this we reloaded the sledge and dragged it for
some considerable distance over more of the leafy ice-surface
alternating with flattish depressions of rotten ice and snow,
with water just beneath. We were now troubled, not only by the
tile-ice surface, but also by small channels with steep banks,
apparently eroded by glacial streams which had been flowing as
the result of the thaw while we were on the Magnetic Pole
plateau. We were also worried from time to time as to how to get
over the vast number of intersecting crevasses which lay in our
path.</p>
<p>Little by little the surface improved as we sledged towards
our depôt. The platy structure on the ice became less and less
pronounced, giving place to a surface like that of innumerable
frozen wavelets with sharp crests. By lunch-time we arrived at a
grand old glacial moraine. Amongst its boulders was a handsome
coarsely crystalline red granite of which Mackay secured a good
specimen. Numbers of boulders projected a few feet above the
surface of the ice, but most of them were wholly encased in ice.
After lunch, the sledging surface, though still heavy, owing to
the newly fallen snow, improved a little, but we soon found our
progress barred by what may be termed an ice donga, apparently an
old channel formed by a river of thaw water. We encountered three
such dongas that afternoon. They were from a few feet up to fifty
or a hundred feet or more in width, and from ten to twenty feet
deep, and bounded by precipitous or overhanging sides.</p>
<p>After a considerable amount of reconnoitring by Mackay and
Mawson, and often making considerable <i>détours</i> with our
sledge, we managed to cross them. Our difficulties were increased
by the innumerable crevasses and steep ice ridges. Some of these
crevasses were open, while others were roofed over with tough
snow. We fell into these crevasses from time to time, and on one
occasion, Mackay and I fell into the same crevasse
simultaneously, he up to his shoulders and I up to my waist.
Fortunately we were able, by throwing out our arms, to prevent
ourselves from falling right through the snow lid. While we were
sledging on through the night amongst this network of crevasses,
the sky became heavily overcast, and it commenced to snow. At
last we succeeded in getting within less than a mile of the
moraine containing the boulders of remarkable sphene-diorite,
specimens of which we had collected at that spot on our outward
journey. Here we camped and turned into our sleeping-bag at 7
<span class="uu">a.m.</span> on February 1.</p>
<p>It continued snowing heavily during the day, the fall being
about six inches in depth. The snow on the side of the tent
facing the sun thawed rapidly, and the thaw water dripped through
and formed pools on top of our sleeping-bag. Mawson's sprained
leg pained him a great deal. We estimated that we were now only
about sixteen miles, as the skua flies, from our depôt on the
Drygalski Glacier, but as we had only two days' food left, it
became imperative to push on without delay. We started sledging
in the thick driving snow on the evening of February 1. The
surface was covered with a layer of soft snow, nine inches in
thickness, but in the drifts it was, of course, deeper. The work
of sledging under these circumstances was excessively laborious
and exhausting, and besides it was impossible to keep our proper
course while the blizzard lasted. Accordingly, we camped at 8
<span class="uu">p.m.</span>, and after our evening meal we
rolled into our sleeping-bag and slid into the dreamless sleep
that comes to the worn and weary wanderer.</p>
<p>At 8 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> on February 2 we were
rejoiced to find the sun shining in a clear sky. We intended
making a desperate attempt this day to reach our depôt, as we
knew that the <i>Nimrod</i> would be due&mdash;perhaps
overdue&mdash;by the night. We saw as we looked back that our
track of yesterday was about as straight as a corkscrew. Once
more we pulled out over the soft snow, and although refreshed
somewhat by our good sleep we found the work extremely trying and
toilsome. We crossed an ice donga, and about four miles out
reached the edge of a second donga. Here we decided to leave
everything but our sledge, tent, sleeping-bag, cooking-apparatus,
oil and food, and make a forced march right on to the Drygalski
Depôt. Accordingly we camped, had tea and two biscuits each, and
fixed up our depôt, including the Lloyd-Creak dip circle,
theodolite and legs, geological collections, &amp;c., and marked
the spot with a little blue flag tied on to an ice-axe.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic052" id="pic052"></a><img alt=""
src="1402771h-images/pic052.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>52. <span class="aa">Watching for Seals
at the Ice-edge</span></small></p>
<p>We now found the sledge, thus lightened, distinctly easier to
pull, and after making a slight <i>détour</i>, crossed the donga
by a snow bridge. Soon we reached another donga, and successfully
crossed it. At three and a half miles further at 8 <span class=
"uu">p.m.</span> we camped again and had a little cheese and
biscuit. After this short halt we pulled on again, steering
north-8°-east magnetic. Mawson occasionally swept the horizon
with our excellent field-glasses in hopes of sighting our depôt.
Suddenly he exclaimed that he saw the depôt flag distinctly on
its ice mound, apparently about seven miles distant, but it was
well round on the starboard bow of our sledge on a bearing of
south-38°-west magnetic. Mackay and I were much excited at
Mawson's discovery. Mackay seized the field-glasses as soon as
Mawson put them down and directed them to the spot indicated, but
could see no trace of the flag; then I looked through the glasses
with equally negative results. Mawson opined that we must both be
snow-blind. Then he looked through them again, and at once
exclaimed that he could see no trace of the flag now. The horizon
seemed to be walloping up and down, just as though it was
boiling, evidently the result of a mirage. Mawson, however, was
so confident that he had seen the flag when he first looked, that
we altered course to south-38°-west magnetic, and after we had
gone a little over a mile, and reached the top of a slight
eminence in the ice-surface, we were rejoiced to hear the
announcement that he could now see the depôt flag distinctly. We
kept on sledging for several miles further. At midnight, when the
temperature had fallen to zero, I felt that the big toe of my
right foot was getting frost-bitten. My ski-boots had all day
been filled with the soft snow and the warmth of my foot had
thawed the snow, so that my socks were wet through; and now,
since the springing up of the wind and the sudden fall in
temperature, the water in the socks had turned to ice. So we
halted, got up the tent, started the Primus and prepared for a
midnight meal, while, with Mawson's assistance, I got off my
frozen ski-boots and socks and restored the circulation in my
toe, and put on some socks less icy than those I had just taken
off.</p>
<p>We were much refreshed by our supper, and then started off
again, thinking that at last we should reach our depôt, or at all
events, the small inlet a little over a mile distant from it, but
"the best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley". There was
an ominous white streak ahead of us with a dark streak just
behind it, and we soon saw that this was due to a ravine or
barranca in the snow-and ice-surface interposing itself between
ourselves and our depôt. We soon reached the near cliff of the
barranca.</p>
<p>The barranca was about two hundred yards in width, and from
thirty to forty feet deep. It was bounded by a vertical cliff or
very steeply inclined slope on the near side, the north-west
side, and by an overhanging cliff festooned with stalactites on
the south-east side. To the north-east a strip of dark sea-water
was visible between the walls of the barranca, which evidently
communicated by a long narrow channel with the ocean outside,
some three miles distant. Inland, the barranca extended for many
miles as far as the eye could reach. The bottom of the barranca
immediately beneath us was floored with sea ice covered with a
few inches of snow. This ice was traversed by large tide-cracks,
and we were much excited to see that there were a number of seals
and Emperor penguins dotted over the ice floor. We determined to
try and cross the barranca. We looked up and down the near cliff
for a practicable spot where we could let down our sledge, and
soon found a suitable slope, a little to the north-east of us,
formed by a steep snow drift. We sledged on to this spot, and
making fast the Alpine rope to the bow of the sledge, lowered it
cautiously, stern first, to the bottom. The oil-cans in the rear
of the sledge were rattled up somewhat when it struck bottom, but
no harm was done. At the bottom we had some trouble in getting
the sledge over the gaping tide-cracks, some ten to fifteen feet
deep and three to five feet wide.</p>
<p>Arrived at the middle of the floor of the barranca, Mackay
killed two Emperor penguins, and took their breasts and livers to
replenish our exhausted larder. Meanwhile, Mawson crossed to the
far side of the floor of the barranca on the look-out for a
possible spot where we might swarm up. I joined him a few minutes
later, and as I was feeling much exhausted after the continuous
forced marches back from the Magnetic Pole, asked him to take
over the leadership of the expedition. I considered that under
the circumstances I was justified in taking this step. We had
accomplished the work assigned to us by our leader, having
reached the Magnetic Pole. We were within two or three miles of
our Drygalski Depôt, and although the only food left there was
two days' supply of broken biscuits with a little cheese, we had
a good prospect of meat-supply, as the barranca abounded in seals
and penguins, so that for the present we had no reason to
apprehend the danger of starvation. On the other hand, as regards
our ultimate personal safety, our position was somewhat critical.
We were not even certain that the <i>Nimrod</i> had arrived at
all in Ross Sea that season, though we thought it, of course,
very probable that she had. In the next case, on the assumption
that she had arrived, it was very possible that in view of the
great difficulties of making a thorough search along the two
hundred miles of coast, at any part of which we might have been
camped&mdash;difficulties arising from heavy belts of pack-ice
and icebergs, as well as from the deeply indented character of
that bold and rugged coast&mdash;it was quite possible that the
<i>Nimrod</i> would miss sighting our depôt flags altogether. In
the event of the <i>Nimrod</i> not appearing within a few days,
it would be necessary to take immediate and strenuous action with
a view either to wintering at the spot, or with a view to an
attempt to sledge back around the great mountain massifs and over
the many steeply crevassed glaciers for over two hundred miles to
our winter quarters at Cape Royds. Even now, in the event of some
immediate strenuous action being necessary, if the <i>Nimrod</i>
were to suddenly appear at some point along the coast, I thought
it would be best for Mawson, who was less physically exhausted
than myself, to be in charge. He had, throughout the whole
journey, shown excellent capacity for leadership, fully
justifying the opinion held of him by Lieutenant Shackleton when
providing in my instructions that in the event of anything
happening to myself Mawson was to assume the leadership. When I
spoke to him on the subject, he at first demurred, but finally
said that he would act for a time, and would think the matter
over at his leisure before definitely deciding to become
permanently the leader. I offered to give him authority in
writing as leader, but this he declined to receive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the examination of the cliff face on the south-east
side of the barranca showed that there was one very difficult but
apparently possible means of ascent. We returned to where we had
left Mackay, and then we three dragged the sledge around to the
edge of a rather formidable tide-crack, behind which lay the
mound of snow up which we hoped to climb; our idea being to
unpack our sledge, drag it to the top of this steep mound, and
rearing it on end at the top of the mound, use it as a ladder for
scaling the overhanging cliff above. Mackay managed to cross the
tide-crack, using the bamboo poles of our tent as a bridge, and
after some difficulty, reached the top of the snow mound under
the overhanging cliff. Much to our disappointment, however, he
discovered that the mound was formed of very soft snow, his
ice-axe sinking in to the whole depth of the handle directly he
placed it on top of the mound. It was obvious that as our sledge
would sink in to at least an equal depth, the top of it would
then be too short to enable any of us to scale the overhanging
cliff by its means. We were, therefore, reluctantly compelled to
drag our sledge back again over the tide-cracks to the north-west
side of the barranca down which we had previously lowered our
sledge. We then discovered that, as in classical times, while the
descent to Avernus was easy, it was difficult and toilsome to
retrace one's steps. With Mawson ahead with the ice-axe and
towing rope, and Mackay and I on either side of the sledge in the
rear, we managed by puffing and pushing together to force the
sledge up a few inches at a time. At each short halt, Mawson
would stick in the ice-axe, take a turn of the leading rope
around it, and support the sledge in this way for a brief
interval while we all got our breath. At last the forty feet of
steep slope was successfully negotiated, and we found ourselves
once more on the level plain at the top of the barranca, but of
course, on the wrong side in reference to our depôt. As we were
within three miles of the open sea we thought it would be safe to
camp here, as had the <i>Nimrod</i> sighted our depôt flag and
stood in to the coast, we could easily have hurried down to the
entrance of the inlet and made signals to her.</p>
<p>We had now been up since 8 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> on the
previous day, and were very thankful to be able to enter our
tent, and have a meal off a stew of minced penguin liver. We then
turned into the sleeping-bag at about 7 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span> Just about a quarter of an hour after we had
turned in, as we learnt later, the <i>Nimrod</i> must have
passed, bound north towards Mount Melbourne, within three miles
of the ice cliff on which our tent was now situated. Owing,
however, to a light wind with snow drift she was unable to sight
either our depôt flag or tent.</p>

<br>
<p><b>FEBRUARY 3</b>.&mdash;After sleeping in the bag from 7
<span class="uu">a.m.</span> until 11 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span> we got up and had breakfast, packed our sledge,
and started along the north bank of the snow cañon. The snow and
ice at the bottom were dotted with basking seals and moulting
Emperor penguins. Fully a hundred seals could be counted in
places in a distance of as many yards along the cañon. At about
one mile from the camp we reached a small branch cañon, which we
had to head off by turning to our right. We now proceeded about
one and a half miles further along the edge of the main cañon,
and in our then tired and weak state were much dispirited to find
that it still trended inland for a considerable distance. We now
halted by the sledge while Mackay went ahead to try and find a
crossing, and presently Mawson and I were rejoiced to hear him
shout that he had discovered a snow bridge across the cañon.
Presently he rejoined us, and together we pulled the sledge to
the head of the snow bridge. It was a romantic spot. A large
slice of the snow or névé cliff had fallen obliquely across the
cañon, and its surface had then been raised and partially
levelled up with soft drift snow. There was a crevasse at both
the near and far ends of the bridge, and the middle was sunk a
good deal below the abutments. Stepping over the crevasse at the
near end we launched the sledge with a run down to the centre of
the bridge, then struggled up the steep slope facing us, Mackay
steadying the sledge from falling off the narrow causeway, while
we all three pulled for all we were worth. In another minute or
two we were safely across with our sledge, thankful that we had
now surmounted the last obstacle that intervened between us and
our depôt.</p>
<p>While heading for the depôt we sighted an Emperor penguin
close to our track. Mackay quickly slew him, and took his flesh
and liver for our cooking-pot. Two miles further on we camped.
Mawson minced the Emperor's flesh and liver, and after adding a
little snow, I boiled it over our Primus so as to make one and a
half pots of soupy mincemeat for each of us. This was the most
satisfying meal we had had for many a long day. After lunch we
sledged on for over one and a half miles further towards the
depôt, and at about 10.30 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> reached an
ice mound on the south side of the inlet in which the snow cañon
terminated seawards. This camping spot was a little over a mile
distant from our depôt. We were now all thoroughly exhausted and
decided to camp. The spot we had selected seemed specially
suitable, as from the adjacent ice mound we could get a good view
of the ocean beyond the Drygalski Barrier. While Mawson and I got
up the tent, Mackay went to kill a seal at the shore of the
inlet. He soon returned with plenty of seal meat and liver. He
said that he had found two young seals, and had killed one of
them; that they had both behaved in a most unusual manner,
scuttling away quickly and actively at his approach, instead of
waiting without moving, as did most of the Weddell seals of which
we had hitherto had experience. We discovered later that these
two seals belonged to the comparatively rare variety known as
Ross seal. After a delicious meal of seal blubber, blood and oil,
with fried meat and liver, cooked by Mawson. Mawson and I turned
into the sleeping-bag, leaving Mackay to take the first of our
four hour watches on the look-out for the <i>Nimrod</i>. During
his watch he walked up to our depôt and dug out our biscuit tin,
which had served us as a blubber lamp and cooker, together with
the cut-down paraffin tin which we had used as a frying-pan. Both
these he carried down to our tent. There he lit the blubber lamp
just outside the tent and cooked some penguin meat, regaling
himself at intervals during his four hour's watch with dainty
morsels from the savoury dish. When he called me up at 4
<span class="uu">a.m.</span> I found that he had thoughtfully put
into the frying-pan a junk of Emperor's breast, weighing about
two pounds, for me to toy with during my watch. A chilly wind was
blowing off the plateau, and I was truly thankful for an
occasional nibble at the hot penguin meat. After cooking some
more penguin meat I called up Mawson soon after 8 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span> on February 4, and immediately afterwards turned
into the bag, and at once dropped off sound asleep.</p>

<p align="center"><small>53. <span class="aa"><i>Nimrod</i>

Barrier</span></small></p>
<p>Mawson did not call Mackay and myself until after 2
<span class="uu">p.m.</span> We at once rolled up the
sleeping-bag, and Mawson cooked a generous meal of seal and
penguin meat and blubber, while Mackay made a thin soupy broth on
the Primus. Meanwhile, I went on to the ice mound with the
field-glasses, but could see nothing in the way of a ship to
seaward and returned to the tent. We all thoroughly enjoyed our
liberal repast, and particularly relished the seal's blood, gravy
and seal oil.</p>
<p>After the meal we discussed our future plans. We decided that
we had better move the tent that afternoon up to our old depôt,
where it would be a conspicuous object from the sea, and where,
too, we could command a more extensive view of the ocean. We also
talked over what we had best do in the event of the <i>Nimrod</i>
not turning up, and decided that we ought to attempt to sledge
overland to Hut Point, keeping ourselves alive on the way, as
best we might, with seal meat. It must be admitted that the
prospect of tackling two hundr-ed miles of coast, formed largely
of steep rocky foreshores, alternating with heavily crevassed
glacier ice, was not a very bright one. We also discussed the
date at which we ought to start trekking southwards. Mackay
thought we ought to commence making our preparations at once, and
that unless the <i>Nimrod</i> arrived within a few days we ought
to start down the coast with our sledge, tent, sleeping-bag,
cooker and seal meat, leaving a note at the depôt for the
<i>Nimrod</i> in case she should arrive later asking her to look
out for us along the coast, and if she couldn't sight us, to lay
depôts of food and oil for us at certain specified spots. He
considered that by this method we could make sure of beginning
the long journey in a sound state of health, and, if fortunate,
might reach Hut Point before the beginning of the equinoctial
gales in March. Mawson and I, on the other hand, thought that we
ought to wait on at our present camp until late in February.</p>
<p>From whatever point of view we looked at it, our present lot
was not a happy one. The possibility of a long wait in the gloomy
region of the Drygalski Glacier, with its frequent heavy snows at
this season of the year, and leaden sky vaulted over the dark
sea, was not pleasing to contemplate. Still less cheerful was the
prospect of a long, tedious and dangerous sledge journey towards
Hut Point. Even the diet of seal and penguin, just for the moment
so nice, largely because novel, would soon savour of <i>toujours
perdrix</i>.</p>
<p>Dispirited by forebodings of much toil and trouble, we were
just preparing to set our weary limbs in motion to pack up our
belongings for the short trek up to the depôt, when Bang! went
something, seemingly close to the door of our tent; the sound
thrilled us; in another instant the air reverberated with a big
boom! much louder than the first sound. Mawson gave tongue first,
roaring out, "A gun from the ship!" and dived for the tent door.
As the latter was narrow and funnel-shaped there was for the
moment some congestion of traffic. I dashed my head forwards to
where I saw a small opening, only in time to receive a few kicks
from the departing Mawson. Just as I was recovering my
equilibrium, Mackay made a wild charge, rode me down and trampled
over my prostrate body. When at length I struggled to my feet,
Mawson had got a lead of a hundred yards, and Mackay of about
fifty. "Bring something to wave", shouted Mawson, and I rushed
back to the tent and seized Mackay's rucksack. As I ran forward
this time, what a sight met my gaze. There was the dear old
<i>Nimrod</i>, not a quarter of a mile away, steaming straight
towards us up the inlet, her bows just rounding the entrance. At
the sight of the three of us running frantically to meet the
ship, hearty ringing cheers burst forth from all on board. How
those cheers stirred every fibre of one's being! It would be
hard, indeed, for any one, not situated as we had been, to
realise the sudden revulsion of our feelings. In a moment, as
dramatic as it was heavenly, we seemed to have passed from death
into life. My first feelings were of intense relief and joy; then
of fervent gratitude to the kind Providence which had so
mercifully led our friends to our deliverance.</p>
<p>A sudden shout from Mackay called me back to earth, "Mawson's
fallen into a deep crevasse. Look out, it's just in front of
you!" I then saw that Mackay was kneeling on the snow near the
edge of a small oblong sapphire-blue hole in the névé. "Are you
all right, Mawson?" he sang out, and from the depth, came up the
welcome word, "Yes". Mackay then told me that Mawson was about
twenty feet down the crevasse. We decided to try and pull him up
with the sledge harness, and hurried back to the sledge,
untoggled the harness, ran back with it to the crevasse, and let
one end down to Mawson. We found, however, that our combined
strength was insufficient to pull him up, and that there was a
risk, too, of the snow lid at the surface falling in on Mawson,
if weight was put upon it, unless it was strengthened with some
planking. Accordingly, we gave up the attempt to haul Mawson up,
and while I remained at the crevasse holding one end of the
sledge harness Mackay hurried off for help to the <i>Nimrod</i>,
which was now berthing alongside of the south wall of the inlet,
about two hundred yards distant. Mackay shouted to those on
board, "Mawson has fallen down a crevasse, and we got to the
Magnetic Pole." The accident had taken place so suddenly that
those on board had not realised in the least what had happened. A
clear, firm, cheery voice, that was strange to me, was now heard
issuing prompt orders for a rescue party. Almost in less time
than it takes to write it, officers and sailors were swarming
over the bows of the <i>Nimrod</i>, and dropping on to the ice
barrier beneath. I called down to Mawson that help was at hand.
He said that he was quite comfortable at present; that there was
sea water at the bottom of the crevasse, but that he had been
able to sustain himself a couple of feet above it on the small
ledge that had arrested his fall. Meanwhile, the rescue party,
headed by the first officer of the <i>Nimrod</i> J. K. Davis, had
arrived on the scene. The crevasse was bridged with a suitable
piece of sawn timber, and Davis, with that spirit of thoroughness
which characterises all his work, promptly had himself lowered
down the crevasse. On reaching the bottom he transferred the rope
by which he had been lowered to Mawson, and with a long pull and
a strong pull and a pull altogether, the company of the
<i>Nimrod</i> soon had Mawson safe on top, none the worse for the
accident with the exception that his back was slightly bruised.
As soon as the rope was cast free from Mawson, it was let down
again for Davis, and presently he, too, was safely on top.</p>
<p>And now we had a moment of leisure to see who constituted the
rescue party. There were the dear old faces so well known on our
voyage together the previous year, and interspersed with them
were a few new faces. Here were our old comrades Armytage and
Brocklehurst, Dr. Michell, Harbord (the officer who&mdash;as we
learned later&mdash;had sighted our depôt flag), our good
stewards Ansell and Ellis, the genial boatswain Cheetham, Paton,
and a number of others. What a joyous grasping of hands and
hearty all-round welcoming followed. Foremost among them all to
welcome us was Captain Evans, who had commanded the S.S.
<i>Koonya</i>, which towed the <i>Nimrod</i> from Lyttelton to
beyond the Antarctic Circle, and it goes without saying that the
fact that the <i>Nimrod</i> was now in command of a master of
such experience, so well and favourably known in the shipping
world of New Zealand and Australia, gave us the greatest
satisfaction. He hastened to assure me of the safety and good
health of my wife and family. While willing hands packed up our
sledge, tent and other belongings, Captain Evans walked with us
to the rope ladder hanging over the bows of the
<i>Nimrod</i>.</p>
<p>Quickly as all this had taken place, Mackay had already found
time to secure a pipe and some tobacco from one of our crew, and
was now puffing away to his heart's content. We were soon all on
the deck of the <i>Nimrod</i> once more, and were immediately
stood up in a row to be photographed. As soon as the cameras had
worked their wicked will upon us, for we were a sorry sight, our
friends hurried us off for afternoon tea. After our one hundred
and twenty-two days of hard toil over the sea ice of the coast
and the great snow desert of the hinterland, the little ship
seemed to us as luxurious as an ocean liner. To find oneself
seated once more in a comfortable chair, and to be served with
new-made bread, fresh butter, cake and tea, was Elysium.</p>
<p>We heard of the narrow escape of Armytage, Priestley and
Brocklehurst, when they were being carried out to sea, with only
two days' provisions, on a small ice-floe surrounded by Killer
whales; and how, just after the momentary grounding of the floe,
they were all just able to leap ashore at a spot where they were
picked up later by the <i>Nimrod</i>. We also heard of the
extraordinary adventures and escapes of Mackintosh and McGillan
in their forced march overland, without tent or sleeping-bag,
from Mount Bird to Cape Royds; of the departure of the
supporting-party to meet the Southern Party; and, in short, of
all the doings at Cape Royds and on the <i>Nimrod</i> since we
had last heard any news. Pleasantly the buzz of our friends'
voices blended itself with the gentle fizzing of steam from the
<i>Nimrod</i>'s boiler, and surely since the days of John Gilpin
"were never folk so glad" as were we three.</p>

<p>Here it may not perhaps be out of place to quote from Captain
Evans' private log in reference to the relief of our Northern
Party by the <i>Nimrod</i>. After hearing from the Western Party
under Armitage that we were long overdue at Butter Point, and
after consulting with Murray at Cape Royds, he decided to
commence to search for us, as suggested in Lieutenant
Shackleton's instructions on February 1. He left accordingly at
that date, and after looking for us in vain at the Butter Point
depôt, and at Granite Harbour he sailed northwards for the
Drygalski Ice Barrier Tongue, and when about three miles off our
depôt island had sighted our little flag and cairn, but was not
certain that it was a depôt. Nearer approach was precluded at the
time by the pack-ice.</p>
<p>Captain Evans' private log reads as follows:</p>
<p>"<i>February</i> 3, 1.30 <span class=
"uu">a.m.</span>&mdash;Cleared belt of pack&mdash;proceeded
westward along Drygalski Barrier edge. Moderate to strong
south-west wind, force four to eight with snow drift; 7.30
<span class="uu">a.m.</span> to 9.30 <span class="uu">a.m.</span>
off Barrier. (At this time the <i>Nimrod</i> must have passed
within about three miles of the spot where we were at our last
camp before reaching the inlet, and had it not been for a little
falling snow our flag and tent would probably have been sighted
on this occasion); 10 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> to 2.15
<span class="uu">p.m.</span>: coasted along the beach at
distances of from one-fifth of a mile to three-quarters of a mile
in water from ten to fifty fathoms; 1 <span class=
"uu">p.m.</span> wind dropped to calm; 2.15 <span class=
"uu">p.m.</span> bearing true north-20°-east, distant twenty-four
miles Mount Melbourne. Came to top of bight (Gerlache Inlet) full
of pack; sounded in sixty-four fathoms; took bearings and stood
eastward to search Cape Washington; 3.30 <span class=
"uu">p.m.</span> entered the pack-ice.</p>
<p>Midnight: rounded Cape Washington at a distance of one and a
half cables in eleven to twenty fathoms, both sides of the cape
quite inaccessible&mdash;awful-looking ice cliffs northern
side&mdash;crevassed ice slopes south side. Fresh
south-south-west wind, force 5-5. . . . No sign of party or
record anywhere.</p>
<p>February 4, 1909, 10 <span class=

Fresh southerly wind, force 6&mdash;clear and fine, barometer
28.86, thermometer 17°. . . . Proceeding again along Drygalski
Barrier; 3 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> sighted two flags on
Barrier edge and a little back of it&mdash;small inlet
developing. (The third officer, Mr. A. Harbord, first sighted
these flags, and came to the captain and said, 'I think, sir, I
see a flag', and then Armytage, bringing his powerful
deer-stalking telescope to bear on the object, said to the
captain, 'It's a dead sitter, sir.' T.W.E.D.) 3.40 <span class=
"uu">p.m.</span> arrived at upper end of inlet&mdash;picked up
Professor David, Mawson and Mackay, just arrived back from

<span class="uu">p.m.</span> great elation. . . . At 3.30
<span class="uu">p.m.</span>, upon sighting the top of the
Northern Party's tent, we fire a distress double detonator. Upon
hearing this in the tent we learn that they all jumped up, and
upset each other, and everything, including the tin of seal
blubber and blood which they were drinking, and which Professor
David pronounces good when you get used to it, and rushed out,
Mawson first, who almost immediately went down a crevasse, from
which Mr. Davis and a party from the ship soon pulled him up. A
great meeting&mdash;a tremendous relief."</p>
<p>After afternoon tea came the joy of reading the home letters,
and finding that the news was good. Later we all three had a
novel experience, the first real wash for over four months. After
much diligent work with hot water, soap and towel some of the
outer casing of dirt was removed, and bits of our real selves
began to show through the covering of seal oil and soot. Dinner
followed at 6 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> and it is scarcely
necessary to add that with our raging appetites, and all the new
types of dainty food around us we over-ate ourselves. This did
not prevent us from partaking liberally of hot cocoa and
gingerbread biscuits before turning in at 10 <span class=
"uu">p.m.</span> None but those whose bed for months has been on
snow and ice can realise the luxury of a real bunk, blankets and
pillow in a snug little cabin. A few minutes' happy reverie
preceded sound sleep. At last our toilsome march was over, the
work that had been given us to do was done, and done just in the
nick of time; the safety of those nearest and dearest to us was
assured, and we could now lay down our weary limbs to rest.</p>
<p>Under Providence one felt one owed one's life to the patient
and thorough search, sound judgment and fine seamanship of
Captain Evans, and the devotion to duty of his officers and crew
and no pen can describe how that night one's heart overflowed
with thankfulness for all the blessings of that day. One's last
thought in the twilight that comes between wakefulness and sleep
is expressed in the words of our favourite record on the
gramophone, the hymn so grandly sung by Evan Williams:</p>
<p style="font-size:90%; margin-left:15%; text-indent:-10%;">"So
long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still will lead me on."</p>
<p>If one may be permitted to take a brief retrospect of our
journey the following considerations present themselves: The
total distance travelled from Cape Royds to the Magnetic Pole and
back to our depôt on the Drygalski Glacier was about 1260 miles.
Of this, 740 miles was relay work, and we dragged a weight of, at
first, a little over half a ton, and finally somewhat under half
a ton for the whole of this distance. For the remaining 520 miles
from the Drygalski Depôt to the Magnetic Pole and back we dragged
a weight at first, of 670 lb., but this finally became reduced to
about 450 lb., owing to consumption of food and oil, by the time
that we returned to our depôt.</p>
<p>We were absent on our sledge journey for one hundred and
twenty-two days, of which five days were spent in our tent during
heavy blizzards, and five days partly in experimenting in cooking
with blubber and partly in preparing supplies of seal meat for
the journey from the sea ice over the high plateau, and three
days in addition were taken up in reconnoitring, taking magnetic
observations, &amp;c. We therefore covered this distance of 1260
miles in 109 travelling days, an average of about eleven and a
half miles a day.</p>
<p>We had laid two depôts before our final start, but as these
were distant only ten miles and fifteen miles respectively, from
our winter quarters they did not materially help us. We had no
supporting-party, and with the exception of help from the
motor-car in laying out these short depôts we pulled the sledges
for the whole distance without assistance except, on rare
occasions, from the wind.</p>
<p>The travelling over the sea ice was at first pretty good, but
from Cape Bernacchi to the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier we were much
hampered by screwed pack-ice with accompanying high and hard snow
ridges. Towards the latter part of October and during November
and part of December the thawing surface of saline snow, clogging
and otherwise impeding our runners, made the work of sledging
extremely laborious. Moreover, on the sea ice&mdash;especially
towards the last part of our journey over it&mdash;we had ever
present the risk of a blizzard breaking the ice up suddenly all
around us, and drifting us out to sea. There can be no doubt, in
view of the wide lanes of open water in the sea ice on the south
side of the Drygalski Glacier, when we reached it on November 30,
that we got to glades fir ma only in the nick of time.</p>
<p>Then there was the formidable obstacle of the Drygalski
Glacier, with its wide and deep chasms, its steep ridges and
crevasses, the passage of this glacier proving so difficult that
although only a little over twenty miles in width it took us a
fortnight to get across. On the far side of the Drygalski was the
open sea forcing us to travel shorewards over the glacier
surface. Then had come the difficult task of pioneering a way up
to the high plateau&mdash;the attempt to force a passage up the
Mount Nansen Glacier&mdash;our narrow escapes from having our
sledge engulfed in crevasses&mdash;the heavy blizzard with deep
new fallen snow and then our retreat from that region of
high-pressure ridges and crevasse entanglements&mdash;our
abandonment of the proposed route up the snout of the
Bellingshausen Glacier, and finally our successful ascent up the
small tributary glacier, the "backstairs passage", to the south
of Mount Larsen.</p>
<p>On the high plateau was the difficulty of respiration, biting
winds with low temperatures, difficult sledging&mdash;sometimes
against blizzards&mdash;over broad undulations and high sastrugi,
the cracking of our lips, fingers and feet, exhaustion from
insufficient rations, disappointment at finding that the Magnetic
Pole had shifted further inland than the position previously
assigned to it. Then, after we had just succeeded by dint of
great efforts in reaching the Pole of verticity, came the
necessity for forced marches, with our sledge, of from sixteen to
twenty miles a day in order to reach the coast with any
reasonable prospect of our being picked up by the
<i>Nimrod</i>.</p>
<p>Then came our choice of the difficult route down the snout of
the Bellingshausen Glacier, and our consequent difficulties in
surmounting the ice-pressure ridges; then the difficulty of
sledging over the "tile-ice" surface, the opposing ice barrancas
formed by the thaw water while we were on the high plateau; the
final heavy snow blizzard; our loss of direction when sledging in
bad light and falling snow, and finally our arrest by the deep
barranca of what afterwards was known as Relief Inlet.</p>
<p>But ours were not the only, nor the greatest, difficulties
connected with our journey. There were many disappointments,
dangers and hardships for the captain, officers and crew of the
<i>Nimrod</i> in their search for us along that two hundred miles
of desolate and, for a great part, inaccessible coast-line. How
often black spots ashore, proving on nearer view to be seals or
penguins, had been mistaken for depôt flags; how often the glint
of sunlight off brightly reflecting facets of ice had been
thought to be "helios", only the disappointed ones can tell; how
often, too, the ship was all but aground, at other times all but
beset in the ice-pack in the efforts to get a clearer view of the
shore-line in order to discover our depôt! This is a tale that
the brave men who risked their lives to save ours will scorn to
tell, but is nevertheless true.</p>
<p>As the result of our journey to the Magnetic Pole and back,
Mawson was able to join up in his continuous triangulation
survey, Mount Erebus with Mount Melbourne, and to show with
approximate accuracy the outline of the coast-line, and the
position and height of several new mountains. He and I obtained
geological collections, sketches and notes&mdash;especially on
glacial geology&mdash;along the coast-line, and he also took a
series of photographs; while Mackay determined our altitudes on
the plateau by means of the hypsometer. Mawson also made magnetic
determinations, and I was able to gather some meteorological
information. A summary of this work is given in the Scientific
Appendix, and details will be supplied later in the Scientific
Memoirs of the expedition.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the time available during our journey was too
short for detailed magnetic, geological or meteorological
observations. Nevertheless, we trust that the information
obtained has justified the journey. At all events we have
pioneered a route to the Magnetic Pole, and we hope that the path
thus found will prove of use to future observers.</p>
<p>It is easy, of course, to be wise after the event, but there
is no doubt that had we known that there was going to be an
abundance of seals all along the coast, and had we had an
efficient team of dogs we could have accomplished our journey in
probably half the time that it actually occupied. Future
expeditions to the South Magnetic Pole would probably do well to
land a strong and well-equipped party, either at Relief Inlet, or
better, as near to "Backstairs Passage" as the ship can be taken,
and as early in December as the state of the sea ice makes
navigation possible. A party of three, with a supporting-party
also of three, with good dog teams and plenty of fresh seal meat,
could travel together for about seventy miles inland; then the
supporting-party might diverge and ascend Mount Nansen from its
inland extremity. The other party, meanwhile, might proceed to
the Magnetic Pole at not less than fifteen miles a day. This
should admit of their spending from a week to a fortnight at the
Pole, and they should then be able to return to the coast early
in February. Meanwhile, there would be plenty of scope for a
third party to explore the foothills of Mount Larsen and Mount
Nansen, search and map their wonderful moraines, and examine the
deeply indented rocky coastline from Nansen to the as yet untrod
volcano Mount Melbourne.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><span class="aa">Introductory</span>.<br></p>
<p><b>THE</b> conclusions provisionally adopted in these notes
are based on the geological collections and observations obtained
by the Southern Party, the Western Party, and the Northern Party
of our expedition as well as by the whole party, when in winter
quarters at Cape Royds.</p>
<p>The only determinable fossil as yet found in the great Beacon
sandstone formation of Antarctica, the piece of coniferous wood,
figured in these notes, was obtained from the collection made by
the Southern Party.</p>
<p>As a result of the explorations, chiefly by Nordenskjold,
Larsen, Gunnar Andersson, Bruce, Charcot and Arçtowski, we now
know the following about the portion of Antarctica south of
America.</p>
<p>In parts of Graham Land there must be a foundation platform of
gneiss and gneissic granite, as boulders of these rocks, several
metres in diameter, are found deposited on the plateau of Seymour
Island, to the east of Graham Land, as recorded by Gunnar
Andersson.</p>
<p>In 1903 the French Antarctic expedition, under the command of
Dr. Charcot, landed on the South Shetland Islands, and after
exploring Palmer Archipelago and Gerlache Strait wintered at
Wandel Island. An interesting and detailed account of the
geological specimens collected has been given by Dr. E. Gourdon.*
Amongst the rocks described are hornblende granites, quartz
diorites, uralitic gabbros, trachyandesites with hornblende and
mica, dacites and andesites with associated tuffs, labradorite
rocks, diabase basalts, micro-granites with pyroxene and
soda-hornblende. He also describes crystalline schists,
quartzites and quartz veins.</p>

Paris.]</p>
<p>Dr. Gourdon concludes that these rocks are part of the
eruptive series of the chain of the Andes. Nordenskjold is of the
same opinion in regard to the eruptives of Graham Land.</p>
<p>In the South Orkneys fossil graptolites, associated with
radiolarian jaspers, were discovered by Bruce's expedition. These
prove the existence there of older Palæozoic rocks, considered to
be of Ordovician age. As far as we can learn there is as yet no
evidence of the presence, in that region, of rocks older than
Ordovician, unless some of the crystalline rocks of south-western
Graham Land, such as those of Borchgrevink Nunatak, &amp;c.,
antedate that period.</p>
<p>The abundant fossil plants discovered by Nordenskjold's
expedition at Hope Bay, at the north-eastern end of Graham Land,
show that in that region, now continuously covered with ice and
snow, there existed in Jurassic times a rich and diversified
flora embracing ferns, cycads and conifers. Amongst the plants
found at Hope Bay the genera <i>Sagenopteris</i>,
<i>Thinfeldia</i>, <i>Cladophlebis</i>, <i>Pterophyllum</i>, and
<i>Otozamites</i> have been recorded as well from the Trias-Jura
rocks of Eastern Australia and India, some of the forms being
found also in South Africa and in the Argentine Republic. The
distribution is shown on the following table:</p>

<p>So far no trace has been found in this flora of any
representatives of the <i>Glossopteris</i> Flora of Gondwana
Land, such as the <i>Phyllotheca</i> discovered by Gunnar
Andersson in the Falkland Islands. Evidently in Jurassic time a
mild and a moist climate prevailed in Antarctica.</p>
<p>The abundance of Cretaceous <i>Ammonites</i> collected by the
Nordenskjold expedition at Snow Hill Island, to the east of
Graham Land, points to a continuance of mild conditions into
cretaceous time. The fossil Araucaria, Beech, &amp;c., unearthed
by the Nordenskjold expedition at Seymour Island, adjoining Snow
Hill Island on the north-east, prove that these mild conditions
were further prolonged into some part of Tertiary time.</p>
<p>In marine strata, also of Tertiary age, and considered by
Wilckens** to belong to Upper Oligocene or Lower Miocene, the
Nordenskjold expedition found numerous bird bones since referred
to five new genera, of penguins*** besides two vertebra? of a big
mammal, referred to the genus <i>Zeuglodon</i>. The marine
fossils associated with these remains enabled Wilckens to come to
the above decision as to the geological age of the formation.</p>

Institution of the University of Upsala. Vol. vii., 1904-5, No.

<p>At Cockburn Island, to the north of Seymour Island, Gunnar
Andersson describes a Pecten conglomerate 160 metres above
sea-level. This marine formation he considers to be probably of
Pliocene age, and the equivalent of the Parana beds of the north
of the Argentine Republic or of the Cape Fairweather beds of
Southern Patagonia.</p>
<p>Nordenskjold's expedition proved that during the maximum
glaciation, in late Geological time, the inland ice rose 300
metres higher than it does at present, in the neighbourhood of
Borchgrevink Nunatak, at the south-east end of Graham Land. This
was proved by the maximum height of erratic boulders found on the
slopes of the nunatak, above the present level of the surface of
the inland ice sheet. Gunnar Andersson mentions the occurrence of
raised beaches at Cockburn Island and also at Sidney Herbert
Sound.</p>
<p>These pieces of evidence prove an emergence of the land, since
the maximum glaciation, to the extent at all events of a few
metres, possibly as much as forty metres.</p>
<p>In the portion of the Antarctic visited by the German
expedition, 1902, under the leadership of Professor E. von
Drygalski, the following information has been obtained:</p>
<p>In latitude 66° 48' South, longitude 89° 30' East, there rises
at the edge of the inland ice a ridge-shaped remnant of a
volcanic cone, the Gaussberg. This attains a height of 366 metres
above the sea, and is formed of leucite-basalt tuff and
leucite-basalt rich in olivine, lumps up to the size of one's
fist being found in the lava. The top and slopes of the
Gaussberg, as recorded by Dr. Philippi, are strewn with
erratics.* These are formed of whitish garnet-bearing gneiss, a
darker biotite-gneiss, mica-schist, fragments of red quartzite,
&amp;c. The crystalline rocks are considered to be probably of
Archæan age.</p>

<p>In the Victoria Land region of the Antarctic the researches of
Ross, Borchgrevink, and above all of Captain R. F. Scott and the
geologist of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, H. T. Ferrar, prove
that there is developed in that region an ancient complex of
gneisses and gneissic granites, with mica-schists, calc-schists
and quartzites, and that these rocks are capped for a great
distance by a formation almost horizontally bedded, called by
Ferrar the "Beacon sandstone". A little argillaceous limestone
was observed by him associated with this sandstone. Ferrar found
plant remains in the sandstone, but in such an altered condition
that they could not be determined. Ferrar has given a detailed
and very valuable description of the geology of Victoria Land and
Ross Island explored by him on this expedition. The petrology of
the rocks collected has been worked out by G. T. Prior.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** National Antarctic Expedition, I901-1904,
Natural History, Vol. i.. Geology. British Museum, 1902.]</p>
<p>Amongst volcanic rocks are comprised hornblende-basalts,
olivine-basalts, dolerites, basalt tuffs, kenytes, phonolitic
trachytes and phonolites. Amongst the foundation rocks of South
Victoria Land, Prior records crystalline limestones with
chondrodite, gneiss, granites, diorites, camptonites, kersantites
and banakite. Amongst the sedimentary rocks he refers to
sandstones, somewhat carbonaceous, as well as black shaly to
slaty rocks.</p>
<p>The volcanic rocks, as pointed out by Prior, are closely
allied in chemical composition and mineral constitution to the
volcanic series described by Dr. P. Marshall, from the
neighbourhood of Dunedin, New Zealand. It may be noted that these
volcanic rocks are developed partly along the coastline of
Victoria Land, partly in islands arranged in lines subparallel to
this coastline.</p>
<p>It is worthy of comment that the volcanic zones of Victoria
Land were not definitely traced by Mr. Shackleton in the ranges
reached by him in his furthest south journey this year. No trace
whatever of volcanic rocks was noticed by him, either <i>in
situ</i> or in the moraines of the vast coast range which bounds
the Great Ice Barrier on its south-west side, near the latitude
of 84° to 86° South.</p>
<p align="center"><span class="aa">Physical
Geography</span><br></p>
<p>These observations relate wholly to the region between the
meridians of 170° East and 150° West. The shoreline in this
region of the Antarctic continent is deeply indented by the Ross
Sea. This commences just south of the parallel of 70°, and
extends to the parallel of 78° South. Ross Sea is bounded at its
east side by dense belts of pack-ice and low snowbergs, which
prevent any view of the coast-line being obtained excepting near
the extreme south-east corner of Ross Sea; there. Captain Scott,
in the <i>Discovery</i>, found a new range of mountains rising
from a land afterwards known as King Edward VII Land. Southwards
Ross Sea is bounded by the cliff of the Great Ice Barrier, which
has an extent of about 470 miles in an east and west direction.
This cliff averages about 150 ft. in height. In places it sinks
to nearly sea-level in low gullies. The surface beyond this Great
Barrier, except for certain broad shallow undulations and small
snow ridges (sastrugi). is practically level. Mr. Shackleton, on
his southern journey, proved that it extends southward for at
least 350 miles. Westwards the Great Barrier cliff terminates in
high-pressure ridges against Cape Crozier, the easternmost point
of Ross Island.</p>
<p>Ross Island with its towering volcanic cones rises like some
vast castle at the end of this huge white wall. It is formed of
four large volcanic cones, Mounts Terror, Terra Nova, Erebus and
Bird. The three first volcanoes appear to be situated on an east
and west line of fracture. Another fracture line probably passes
in a southerly direction from Mount Bird through Mount Erebus.
Thus, Erebus may be said to be at the junction of two important
systems of earth fracture. Still further south several smaller
craters are situated on what may be termed the Erebus Fracture
Zone, including that of Crater Hill, near Hut Point, the winter
quarters of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition. Still further south
are the volcanic islands. White Island and Black Island, and
somewhat to the south-south-west Mount Discovery with the long
volcanic promontory trending from it to the east-south-east,
known as Minna Bluff.</p>
<p>In the gaps between these islands and promontories the mass of
the Great Barrier moves slowly, but surely, seawards towards the
narrow south-westerly prolongation of Ross Sea known as McMurdo
Sound. Pressure ridges of ice in this part of the Great Barrier,
as well as actual measurements taken, prove that this part of the
Barrier is moving seawards, both to the west and to the east of
Ross Island.</p>

<p>McMurdo Sound is bounded on the south by the low terminal
cliff of the Great Barrier only a few feet in height. This low
ice cliff extends westwards across McMurdo Sound, for a distance
of about thirty miles, to the magnificent coast range of Victoria
Land. Majestic peaks of gneiss, granite, sandstone and limestone
capped by eruptive rocks rise almost sheer from the coast to
altitudes of from 8000 up to 12,000 ft. Throughout its entire
length from Cape North and the mountains recently discovered by
our expedition further west, down to the parallel of 86° South, a
distance of about 1100 miles, the ranges form a slightly elevated
border to an inland plateau. The continuity of these plateau
ranges is interrupted at intervals by wide valley-like
depressions, occupied by vast glaciers. These glaciers slope
steeply to the sea, or to the surface of the Great Barrier, and
are heavily crevassed. Further inland they ascend by gentle
slopes, interrupted occasionally by ice-falls, to the névé fields
of the plateau.</p>
<p>As one traces the coast-line northwards, from opposite Ross
Island in the direction in which the Northern Party travelled to
the South Magnetic Pole, one encounters some very remarkable
features which materially modify the form of the coast-line. The
first of these is called on the chart of the Antarctic Ocean,
prepared from observations under the direction of Captain R. F.
Scott, the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier Tongue. It is about six miles
in width, and projects twenty miles or more seawards from the
coast-line. There is reason to suppose that this Barrier, as well
as the one just to be described, is floating at its seaward
extremity.</p>
<p>North of the Nordenskjold Barrier is the Drygalski Barrier or
Ice Tongue. This is a huge glacier actively moving forwards into
the sea. It is a true glacier at its landward end, with immense
séracs, ridges and crevasses. The portion which projects seawards
beyond the coast is about twenty miles in width, and thirty miles
in length. Towards its seaward end, and also on its northern
side, where it receives the bulk of the snow drifted by southerly
blizzards, it partakes rather of a flat-topped barrier type than
of the glacier type with its characteristic rugged surface.</p>
<p>Just inland to the north of the Drygalski Ice Barrier Tongue
is a fine bay, Terra Nova Bay, inland from which, near its
northern end, rises the majestic Mount Nansen. This is a
flat-topped mountain, obviously capped by sedimentary rocks, and
as a matter of fact, it has shed lumps of limestone and sandstone
into the moraines beneath it.</p>
<p>Still further north the beautifully symmetrical volcanic cone
of Mount Melbourne attains a height of 8337 ft. The volcanic
rocks with which it is associated trend sharply to the
south-west, terminating in the high rugged cliffs of Cape
Washington.</p>
<p>To the north-east of Mount Melbourne is the deep indentation
known as Wood Bay, and thence the coast bends abruptly to the
east. It would seem indeed as though Mount Melbourne is probably
situated on some east and west line of earth fractures, like
Mounts Terror and Terra Nova. The coast-line then trends nearly
north again, forming the west boundary of Lady Newnes Bay. Then
it trends once more east to Cape Jones, an extinct volcano. Just
off Cape Jones lies the large volcanic island, Coulman Island.
From here the coast again trends chiefly northerly to Cape Adare.
Volcanic rocks are extensively developed at this cape, but the
ranges inland are formed of older rocks, such as granite, gneiss,
schist, slate, &amp;c., apparently still capped by the "Beacon
sandstone" formation. The island known as Possession
Island&mdash;also volcanic&mdash;lies to the south-south-east of
Cape Adare. This long cape, where the Southern Cross expedition,
under Borchgrevink, wintered, forms the north-east side of
Robertson's Bay. From this bay the coast trends at first
north-westwards for about 120 miles to Cape North. Near here,
some hills, a little distance back from the coast, give one a
strong impression of their being of volcanic origin, though it is
possible that they are merely out-lying sugar-loaf hills, relics
of a dissected plateau.</p>
<p>It was clear from the sight which we obtained of the part of
the coast, beyond Cape North on March 8, 1909, that the hills
were high, having an altitude of from 6000 to 7000 ft., as
measured by sextant, and that they formed the abrupt termination
seawards of a deeply denuded high plateau. This plateau is
undoubtedly a northern prolongation of the one travelled over by
the Northern Party of our expedition on their journey to the
South Magnetic Pole. It is also certainly continuous with the
plateau traversed by Captain R. F. Scott in his western journey,
in 1903, and it is proved now that it is part of the same plateau
to which Lieutenant Shackleton led the Southern Party, and over
which they travelled to an altitude of 10,000 ft. when they
reached their furthest point 88° 23' South.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole of this magnificent coastal range the
evidence of past ice action is extremely clear. Most of the
valleys are wide, but a few, like the Ferrar Glacier Valley, are
narrow. But whether wide or narrow, their rocky sides show most
impressively the abrasive work of the great ice plough, indeed
the rocky slopes bounding these glaciers are almost as even as
the banks of a deep railway cutting. One is at once struck with
the entire absence of those re-entering spurs and angles so
characteristic of river-worn valleys.</p>
<p>A curious feature, already mentioned by Ferrar, is the
development of an extensive coastal shelf, for at any rate about
150 miles northwards of the latitude of Cape Royds. This coastal
shelf may be possibly ascribed to step faulting, but it is also
possible that it may be due to an over-riding of the foothills of
the coast range, and a ploughing of them out by the former great
ice sheet of the Ice Barrier, at a time when its surface was
fully 1000 ft. higher than it is at present, and when it spread
northwards into the Ross Sea, probably at least 100 to 200 miles
north of its present seaward termination.</p>
<p>As regards the reason for the plateau of Victoria Land
terminating in such steep mountain slopes eastwards, it is of
course possible, as Ferrar suggests, that this is due to a heavy
fault or series of faults running parallel to the shore-line.
Certainly the scenery, particularly in the neighbourhood of Mount
Nansen, and between that and Mount Melbourne, suggests a
comparatively recent change of base, down to which the base level
forces have recently been working. In fact, these glacier-cut
valleys appear to us to be distinctly young in their origin. The
soundings in Ross Sea off this coast have some interest as
bearing on this question, as also the presence of raised beaches
in several places along the coast, and on Ross Island. McMurdo
Sound, from Ross Island to the coast of Victoria Land, is only
thirty miles wide, and yet the sea is nearly 500 fathoms in depth
within a few miles of the coast. As evidence of crust movements
raised beaches may be quoted. On Ross Island they were traced by
us up to altitudes of 160 ft., and organisms were found in these
beaches such as are found now living in the coastal waters, so
that they probably indicate an uplift since the deposition of
these organisms of a good deal more than 160 ft. At the Ferrar
Glacier on the mainland, raised beaches extended up to at least
50 ft. above sea-level, and they reached apparently to an
altitude of 20 to 30 ft. on the coast south-east of Mount Larsen,
200 miles further north. It is possible that the latter may be
due to upthrust of the marine sediments by glacier ice. These
changes in the level of the shore-line have taken place in quite
recent geological time. It is, of course, possible that such
changes might occur without being due to geological faulting.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D01. <span class="aa">Section showing
Former Thickness of West<br>
Branch of Great Ice Barrier when it filled Mcmurdo<br>
Sound at Maximum of Recent Glaciation</span></small></p>
<p>The sectional drawing shows the state of Ross Sea, and of
McMurdo Sound during the maximum recent glaciation. It indicates
that the ice attained a maximum thickness formerly of nearly 4000
ft. in parts of McMurdo Sound from which it has now entirely
retreated. Since the voyage of Ross, in 1841, the front of the
Great Ice Barrier has retreated southwards in McMurdo Sound to
the extent of about thirty-five miles, as determined by Captain
Scott. Signs of waning glaciation are conspicuous all the way
from Mount Nansen to the furthest south mountains examined by the
Southern Party of this expedition in latitude 85° 15' South. For
example, the summit of Mount Hope, discovered by the Southern
Party in latitude 83° 33' South, was strewn with erratics, at an
altitude of fully 2000 ft. above the general level of the
adjacent surface of the glacier ice.</p>
<p align="center">GLACIOLOGY<br></p>
<p>The glacial phenomena of the region examined by us are due to
the action either (a) of Water substance in the form of (1)sea
ice, and ice-foot or shore ice; (2)glacier ice; (3)barrier snow
and ice-fields; (4)inland ice and névé fields; (5)icebergs;
(6)pack-ice; (7)thaw water forming surface lakes, and surface,
englacial or subglacial streams; or (b) to the action of wind; or
(c) to that of seasonal or diurnal changes of temperature.</p>
<p align="center">(a) <span class="aa">Action Of Water
Substance</span><br></p>
<p>(1) <span class="aa">Sea Ice</span>.&mdash;We made a series of
observations, by cutting holes from time to time through the sea
ice, to ascertain its maximum thickness throughout the area, and
also its methods of freezing. The maximum thickness measured by
us amounted to about 7 ft., in the case of ice formed, in a
sheltered position at Backdoor Bay near our winter quarters,
between the middle of March and middle of September 1908. Ice had
formed over the same area, a little earlier in March, to the
depth of a few inches, but this was cracked up, and drifted away
by the blizzards. This thickness of 7 ft. of ice was no doubt
increased between the middle of September and early in

<p>Ferrar states that the maximum thickness of sea ice which
formed during the year 1903 at Hut Point, McMurdo Sound, was 8
ft. 5¾ in. We observed that in places the sea ice was fractured,
through pressure of wind and tidal currents, and the broken slabs
were forced over one another forming pressure ridges, from 10 to
20 ft. in height.</p>
<p>It was interesting to note the effect on the sea ice of a
sudden fall of temperature. The contraction following on such a
fall would put the sea ice, especially at its surface, into a
high state of tension, and from time to time the surface would
crack open with a loud report. These contraction cracks gaped to
a width of 3 to 6 ft., and the sea water between the walls of the
crack, of course, began to freeze over. Frequently after ice had
formed to the thickness of a few inches a rise of temperature
would expand the ice. This expansion would tend to expend itself
on all weak spots, especially on the planks of thin ice formed
between the walls of the contraction cracks. These would be
buckled into small overfolds, until at last they became cracked
through excess of thrusting, and overthrust faults resulted. In
many of these cracks this process was frequently repeated.</p>
<p>Another feature worth noting in the sea ice is, that owing to
the great difference between the temperature of the sea water
below the ice and that of the air above it, as soon as a
contraction crack opened, the sea water appeared to be steaming.
A wall of thick vapour would rise along the whole length of each
crack. To this the term of frost-smoke is sometimes applied. The
water vapour, as it rose, was being constantly condensed and
deposited on the walls of the narrow cracks, so that gradually
the interspace became filled with ice, and not infrequently a
ridge of soft ice would be built up along the line of the old
crack, to a height of 6 in. or so above the general level of the
surrounding ice. As the ice was often traversed by a perfect
network of these cracks, the resulting ridges gave the
ice-surface the appearance of Indian paddy-fields, with their
dividing "bunds", or mud walls.</p>
<p>The sea ice was usually separated from the shore-ice, or
ice-foot, by one or more well-marked tide-cracks. In McMurdo
Sound, near our winter quarters, the tidal range of from 2 ft. to
3 ft. was quite sufficient to fracture the ice in contact with
the land. The seals took advantage of these tide-cracks, and used
them as blow-holes.</p>
<p>The chief geological work done by the sea ice, as far as we
could ascertain, was the transport seawards of windblown rock
detritus lodged on the shore-ice and ice-foot, in the manner
about to be described.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Ice-foot or Shore-ice</span>.&mdash;On first
arriving on the shores of the Antarctic after the breaking up of
sea ice, towards the end of the summer, one is puzzled to account
for the low cliff, part snow, part ice, which almost everywhere
fringes the coast and so makes landing from a boat difficult.
This fringe is seen to be made up partly of ice at its base,
resembling somewhat the stalagmites of limestone caves, partly of
layers of compressed snow, in some cases alternating with bands
of sand and gravel. The ice-foot generally rises to a height of 6
to 10 ft. above sea-level. It is usually in the form of a flat
narrow terrace from 20 to 100 ft, wide, sometimes in that of a
sheer cliff, occasionally as much as 80 ft. to over 100 ft. in
height, the summit of which ascends inland in a more or less
steep snow slope. At its base, in summer, the ice-foot is almost
invariably undercut by the sea, and from the overhanging roof
thus produced there depend vast numbers of beautiful icicles.
These icicles have, of course, been formed from the wash of the
waves, and the sea water in the process of being frozen has
extruded its brine, the salinity of which is such that the
solution cannot freeze at a temperature above zero Fahr. These
icicles are generally moist, and the moisture, in the form of
concentrated brine, works downwards, under the influence of
gravity, to the tips of the icicles, which thus become sticky.
Hence when a blizzard springs up and drives snowflakes against
them, the flakes stick on chiefly at the tips and gradually build
out those foot-like structures which we have termed
foot-stalactites, and which are illustrated.</p>
<p>During the winter of 1908 and the succeeding spring and
summer, we were able to see clearly the mode of growth of the
ice-foot. After the sea surface had been frozen over snow carried
by the wind from the land, or from the surface of the Great Ice
Barrier formed drifts of greater or less thickness over the sea
ice close inshore. These, at their shoreward end where the cliffs
are 80 or 100 ft. in height, may form drifts of equal thickness
with the height of the cliff. These drifts, of course, thin out
seawards. They are stratified and contain numerous dark bands
formed of chips of rock, broken crystals of felspar, &amp;c.
When, during the summer, strong blizzards disrupt the sea ice,
large rafts of ice are dislodged from near the shore, and these
carry away on their surfaces portions of the old snow-drifts. As
the work of destruction proceeds even the thick landward portions
of the snow-drifts are cracked off in large slices, and float
seawards, and thus in summer time is formed that almost universal
low cliff known as the ice-foot. During heavy weather when the
sea is open the waves wash over the lower portions of the
ice-foot, with the result that it is being constantly bathed in
salt water, which freezes in successive layers on its surface.
Thus, when the temperature is low the old masses of snow-drift,
of which the upper part of the ice-foot is formed, become cased
over with ice much in the same way as snow bergs become encased
as the result of their being splashed by sea spray.</p>
<p>(2) <span class="aa">Glacier Ice and Névé</span>.&mdash;The
glacier ice of the portion of the Antarctic area examined by us
either terminates inland in glaciers, some of which are hanging
glaciers, and some piedmont glaciers, or ice-slabs, or it comes
down to the sea where it is broken off from time to time to form
true icebergs, close to the shore-line; or&mdash;and this is a
feature emphasised already by Mr. H. T. Ferrar&mdash;the ice may
advance for a considerable distance from the shore-line into the
sea. in some cases from 20 to 30 miles, probably far more in the
case of the Great Ice Barrier, and thus discharge icebergs from
its sides as well as its snout. Such glaciers were described by
Ferrar as piedmonts-afloat, and we propose to retain this term
for them.</p>

<p align="center"><small>109. <span class="aa">Two Erratic
Boulders of Granite on the Slopes of Erebus</span></small></p>
<p><span class="aa">Glaciers</span>.&mdash;A good example of this
type was to be seen a little over two miles southerly from our
winter quarters, just south of Cape Barne. The glacier there,
called by us the Cape Barne Glacier, terminates seawards in a
cliff about 100 ft. in height, and some three miles in length. It
has its source in the névé fields of the western slope of Mount
Erebus. These are fed, not only by new falling snow, but also by
large quantities of drift snow swept over by the south-east
blizzards on to this, the lee side, of Erebus. The glacier was
considerably crevassed at its seaward extremity, and passed up
gradually, at a distance of some four or five miles inland, into
the névé field. This glacier was not moving actively, as we never
observed any trace of buckling or crushing of the sea ice, where
it abutted against the foot of the glacier cliff. Had there been
any appreciable forward movement it could not have failed to
ridge up or crush the opposing sheets of continuous sea ice. At
the same time the crevassed state of this glacier ice proved that
movement was still in progress.</p>
<p>A glacier of a Greenland type, also on a large scale, is the
Mount Nansen Glacier, occupying the wide depression between
Mounts Nansen and Larsen. This great glacier is from 12 to 20
miles in width, and 60 to 70 miles in length. It is very heavily
crevassed, and its surface is extremely irregular towards its
seaward end. Where the surface falls steeply, it has raised
immense pressure ridges in the sea ice along the shore, and
bristles with hummocks and séracs. So difficult was this surface
for sledging that we were forced to abandon it, after attempting
to take our sledge by way of this glacier on to the Magnetic Pole
plateau.</p>
<p>On striking the upper end of this glacier, some 60 miles
inland, we found that there was still a little ice present here
and there underneath the wide névé field. This névé field spread
out into a wide plain, and for a considerable distance before
reaching the Magnetic Pole, the latter being over 220 miles
inland at right angles to the coast-line&mdash;our horizon on all
sides was bounded by these same vast névé fields. It is obvious
that the Mount Nansen Glacier is moving steadily seawards, as
shown by the great pressure ridges which it has raised in the sea
ice opposing its advance. It must, therefore, still form an
outlet for the névé-formed ice of the inland plateau.</p>
<p>The interesting question here suggests itself, Is there
sufficient snowfall annually, on the area of the névé fields
drained by this glacier, to compensate for the ice which is lost
by ablation, or by being discharged as icebergs into the sea?
Until more data are available no accurate quantitative answer can
be given to this question. At the same time it may be remarked
that there is a tolerably heavy snowfall along this part of the
coast, and for a distance of at least 50 miles inland. Portions
of the high plateau, at a greater distance inland from the shore
than 50 miles at present probably receive only a very small snow
supply. It may be doubted whether the surface of this névé field
far inland is not on the whole being reduced in level through the
snow being drifted off it by the wind, or removed by the slow
process of ablation.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in front of the termination of
the Mount Nansen Glacier there is an immense old moraine of the
nature apparently of a medial moraine. We could trace this for
fully 23 miles in advance of the present glacier snout. It
follows that in comparatively recent geological time the Mount
Nansen Glacier has retreated by at least the amount quoted
above.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Piedmont Glaciers on Land</span>.&mdash;A
curious feature observed along the greater part of the coast-line
of Victoria Land, from near Mount Discovery up to the Drygalski
Ice Barrier Tongue, is the development, on the great coastal
shelf, at an altitude of about 1000 ft. above sea-level, of a
massive covering of blue glacier ice. This, in some cases,
reaches the sea and breaks off to form bergs. In other cases the
sheets do not reach the sea, and, therefore, are probably on the
wane. For the latter Ferrar suggests the appropriate name of
ice-slabs.</p>
<p>Several theories might be advanced to account for them. They
may represent actual relics of the old Barrier ice sheet, which
once filled McMurdo Sound and Ross Sea for probably fully 100
miles north of Ross Island. Another view is that they may be
local developments of ice resulting from a coalescing of a number
of small névé fields developed in the cirques among the foothills
of the plateau ranges. These foot-hills are frequently as much as
10 to 20 miles back from the edge of the coastline.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Piedmont Glaciers Afloat</span>.&mdash;Three
well-marked examples of this type of glacier came under our
notice. The first was Glacier Tongue, between our winter quarters
and the old winter quarters of the <i>Discovery</i> at Hut Point.
Glacier Tongue, as shown on the Admiralty Charts and the Reports
of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, is an elongated mass of ice
stretching from the shore-line into the sea for a distance of
about five miles. It has a width of about half a mile near its
seaward end, and about a mile where it rests against the land.
Both on its north and south side the Tongue is deeply indented
with a number of bays. Its height above sea-level varies from
about 40 ft. up to nearly 100 ft. While the <i>Nimrod</i> was
lying alongside this remarkable piedmont in February 1908,
Captain England took soundings at about a mile east of its
seaward end, and got a depth of 157 fathoms. As the maximum
height of the glacier above sea-level does not here exceed about
40 ft., and the sea is 940 ft. deep, if the ice were aground it
would have only one twenty-third of its volume above water, which
of course is physically impossible. We must, therefore, conclude
that this part of Glacier Tongue is afloat. At the same time it
should be mentioned that alongside of this glacier there are
traces of cracks, which some observers have considered to be
tide-cracks. There may be true tide-cracks near the shoreward end
of the glacier, but we were not satisfied that the cracks noticed
near its seaward end were really of the nature of tide-cracks.
While waiting for the arrival of the Southern Party, the
<i>Nimrod</i> lay in a snug natural dock, formed by one of the
bays on the north side of this glacier tongue, at about a mile
from its seaward end. We carefully watched for any evidence of
rise and fall of the tide in relation to the shore-line of the
glacier, but were unable to observe any. We concluded from this
circumstance that the glacier must be rising and falling in
unison with the tide. The sounding-tube of our Lucas
sounding-machine brought up a quantity of serpulæ and sponge
spicules from the sea bottom beneath the edge of the glacier
where our ship was moored.</p>
<p>The second piedmont-afloat is the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier
Tongue. This Ice Barrier Tongue is about 20 miles in length, and
5 to 6 miles in width. Its southern edge is formed of ice and
polished névé. Fierce blizzards have swept any loose snow off
this southern edge of the Barrier. The northern edge was formed
largely of snow, being chiefly of the nature of snow-drift, from
40 to 50 ft. in thickness. The latter terminates in a vertical
cliff with overhanging snow cornices. Obviously this cliff was
the combined result of the blizzard winds driving snow northwards
to the lee side of this piedmont-afloat, and to the breaking away
in summer time of the sea ice supporting the northernmost
portions of this snow-drift. Slices are thus removed from time to
time from the northern edges of the drifts, and so the cliff of
the portion left behind becomes higher in proportion as the
thicker ends of the wedges of snow-drift become broken away.
Certainly no true tide-crack was visible on the south side of
this Barrier, and only a small crack was seen on its north side.
Strange to say, this big mass of ice and consolidated snow, which
rises at its centre a little over 100 ft. above sea-level, does
not appear to communicate directly with a névé field at its
inland end. Apparently then the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier is not
now being directly fed from the inland névé fields. It appears to
represent an old piedmont-afloat, which is in the act of
dwindling away from want of supplies of ice from the
interior.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Drygalski Ice Barrier Tongue is also of the
nature of a piedmont-afloat. It is probably floating for at least
three-quarters of the distance of 30 miles to which it projects
from the shore into the sea. The surface of this glacier, where
it leaves the shore-line, is extremely rough and rugged, being
traversed, as stated in the narrative, by an immense number of
chasms, pressure ridges and crevasses. On the south side, where
the ice was still unbroken when we reached the glacier on
November 30, 1908, the old sea ice was forced up into strong
pressure ridges. The whole appearance suggested to us that this
glacier is moving actively from inland seawards. We could see
with our field-glasses that at a distance of about 50 miles
inland it descended by steep ice-falls from a high plateau
beyond. At the point where we crossed it, the glacier rose to an
altitude at its centre of about 200 ft. above sea-level. It was
here 12 miles in width. Further eastwards and therefore seawards,
the glacier ice was more and more levelled up with snow, until
eventually it passed into a true barrier type with a
comparatively smooth surface.</p>
<p>Captain Evans, after he brought the <i>Nimrod</i> into "Relief
Inlet", where he picked up the Northern Party just returned from
the Magnetic Pole, sounded alongside of the Drygalski Glacier and
found a depth of 655 to 668 fathoms, at a distance of only about
18 miles from the rocky shore-line.</p>
<p>As the Barrier here rises to a height not exceeding 50 ft.
above sea-level it must surely be afloat.</p>
<p>During the few weeks of thaw, in December and January,
torrents of water must rush off from this glacier in the form of
englacial or subglacial streams. These in some cases cut deep
open valleys with more or less precipitous sides; in other cases
they tunnel channels for themselves under the covering of hard
snow and ice, and the roofs of these tunnels collapsing through
want of support produce rugged ravines, very difficult to cross
with sledges.</p>
<p>This Drygalski Ice Barrier, on its northern side, contained in
places a considerable amount of moraine material. It was evident
that at the time when the glaciation of this region was at its
maximum it must have been continuous with the Mount Nansen
glacier. These two glaciers, when united, doubtless formed a huge
piedmont-afloat.</p>
<p>(3) <span class="aa">Barrier Snow- and
Ice-fields</span>.&mdash;The structure of the Nordenskjold and
Drygalski Barriers throws considerable light on one of the most
difficult problems of the Antarctic&mdash;the origin of the Great
Ice Barrier. To ascertain the amount of annual snowfall on this
Great Barrier is of very great importance, but we found this a
hard problem, chiefly on account of the difficulty of
distinguishing between true newly fallen snow and old snow which
has been drifted along by blizzards. We tried, during our
observations in Antarctica, to eliminate the drift snow from the
true snowfall, and our general conclusion now is, that at Cape
Royds the annual snowfall is equal to about 9½ in. of rain. On
the journey of the southern depôt party under Joyce, when laying
a depôt for the relief of the returning Southern Party in
January-1909, the fortunate discovery was made of Captain Scott's
old Depot A. The sharp eyes of Day discerned, at a distance of
several miles, the top of the depôt bamboo pole with just a wisp
of the old black flag still attached to it. Knowing the
importance, from a scientific point of view of estimating the
extent and direction of movement of this depôt, in the six years
four months and a half that had elapsed since Captain Scott left
it there, the party visited it and Mackintosh took a series of
angles and measurements, which enabled him to determine that the
depôt had moved bodily to the east-north-east at the rate of a
little over 500 yards a year for the past six years and six
months. The party also dug down through the hard snow to a depth
of 8 ft. 2 in. when they came upon the original snow-surface on
which the depôt was formed. They were thus able to show that,
during the above period, October 1, 1902, to February 15, 1909,
on the average about 13 in. per year of hard snow had
accumulated. In order to determine the density of this snow they
melted down a considerable quantity of it, and measured the
volume of the thaw-water resulting. This showed that the annual
accumulation of snow on this part of the Great Ice Barrier is
equal to about 7½ in. of rain.</p>
<p>This depôt is in the latitude of Minna Bluff, about 78° 40'
South. Further north, as, for example, in the neighbourhood of
Mount Nansen, the snowfall appeared to be considerably heavier,
and it seemed to be heavier still nearer to the Antarctic Circle.
As 7½ in. of rain is equal to 7½ ft. of snow it is obvious that
the accumulation of snow, even as far south as between latitude
78° and 79° is not inconsiderable, but on account of its great
density this compressed snow, near Minna Bluff, formed a layer
annually 13½ in. thick, instead of 7½ ft. thick.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity it may be assumed that the rate of
accumulation over the Great Barrier generally is about 1 ft.
annually. Now it has been proved that the Great Barrier extends
inland for fully 300 miles in places. From the observations at
Minna Bluff, and the rate of movement of Captain Scott's Depot A,
as measured by Captain Scott and again by Joyce, it may be
inferred that the Great Barrier there is travelling seawards at
the rate of about one-third of a mile per year. From this it may
be argued that a snowfall on any part of the Barrier 300 miles
inland would take 900 years to reach the edge of the Great Ice
Barrier, where bergs are discharged into the sea. At this rate,
if 1 ft. of snow is added to the Barrier every year a layer of
snow, formed 300 miles inland, 900 years ago, if it reaches the
Great Barrier cliffs at the present day will be covered by a
thickness of 900 ft. of snow. Obviously this theory gives a vast
thickness of snow to form the seaward end of the Great Barrier.
Theoretically then as the result of the calculations from the
observations of the southern depôt party, it might be argued that
a considerable thickness of the berg material derived from the
Great Ice Barrier was formed of consolidated snow and névé rather
than of true glacier ice. Practical proof of this was afforded us
by another series of observations. At the end of the breaking up
of the sea ice in the summer of 1907-8, three bergs drifted into
McMurdo Sound, and grounded between our winter quarters and Cape
Barne. During the following winter the sea was frozen over around
these bergs, and we were able to go over to them and study them.
Fortunately they were much tunnelled by sea-worn caves. This
enabled us to see their internal structure. We found that all
around the edge, particularly along the line of the wave-worn
groove which surrounds all bergs, a good deal of ice was
developed. This ice resulted evidently from the freezing of sea
water as the waves washed and dashed against the foot of the berg
cliff. In heavy weather a large quantity of spray would be flung
high up against the cliff faces of the berg, and the spray
freezing would encrust the exterior of the berg with ice. There
was no evidence, however, of the existence of any solid ice
inside the berg, this portion of it being formed purely of
compressed snow.</p>
<p>From this fact we were led to speculate as to whether the
whole of the berg might not be formed of hard snow, its submerged
portion saturated, but only superficially, with sea water. That
this was actually the case was proved later by Captain F. P.
Evans. He saw in these bergs an excellent shelter for his ship
from the blizzards, and moored the <i>Nimrod</i> to one of the
larger bergs. While here he took soundings around the most
typical of these tabular bergs, and found that whereas its cliff
face rose to a height of 80 ft. above sea-level, the berg was
aground in only thirteen fathoms of water; that is, the berg was
submerged to a depth of 78 ft., so that practically half of it
was out of the water and half immersed. This direct observation
is obviously of great importance as bearing on the mode of origin
and structure of the so-called icebergs of the Antarctic. There
can, we think, now be little doubt that a great proportion, in
some cases the whole, of the material of typical Antarctic bergs
is formed of consolidated snow rather than ice. These
observations may now be considered in their bearing on the origin
of the Great Ice Barrier. Captain Scott has shown that the Great
Ice Barrier for the greater part of its length, probably for 400
miles at least along its edge, is afloat. Wherever we got near to
the cliff face of the Barrier, and we were at times very close to
it, we were unable to see anything of the nature of true glacier
ice, even in eases where the cliff rose to a height of over 150
ft. above sea-level. On the other hand, there was every
appearance of the Barrier being formed of numbers of superimposed
layers of snow. On the line of argument previously given it is
not improbable that a thickness of 900 ft. of snow, or
thereabouts, may accumulate on a large proportion of the Barrier
near its terminal cliff, so that obviously, a great part of the
thickness of the Great Ice Barrier is probably due to this
compressed snow.</p>
<p>The question still remains, as to what becomes of the glacier
ice which undoubtedly does feed the Barrier at many spots along
its western and southern boundaries. For example, the great
glacier, 50 miles wide, up which the Southern Party travelled
from the spot where they were compelled to diverge from the
Barrier, latitude 83° South, must be discharging vast quantities
of ice into the Barrier. This same glacier had raised pressure
ridges on the Barrier surface for 20 miles out from its junction
with the Barrier. It is clear, too, from the fact established
both by the <i>Discovery</i> expedition and our own, that the
Great Ice Barrier is moving seawards. The propelling force can be
no other than that of glacier ice. This glacier ice descending
from the inland plateau must also move seawards, but as it gets
nearer to the Great Barrier ice cliff it becomes weighted down
with a vast thickness of superincumbent snow, and it is quite
possible that under these conditions a great deal of it may be
thawed off from below by the sea water.</p>
<p>The question here suggests itself, does the water circulating
beneath the Great Ice Barrier ever have a temperature high enough
to thaw fresh water ice? It does, of course, thaw the sea ice
quite rapidly.</p>

<p>(4) <span class="aa">Inland Ice and Névé
Fields</span>.&mdash;Reference has already been made to this type
of ice under the head of "Glaciers", in the description of the
Mount Nansen Glacier. The great glacier discovered by the
Southern Party between 83° 33' South and 85° South, over 100
miles in length and 50 miles in width descended about 6000 ft. in
that distance from a vast inland snow plateau. This plateau is
identical with that traversed by Captain Scott's party of the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition, on their western journey in 1903. It
is identical also with the plateau travelled by the Northern
Party of our expedition in their journey inland to the South
Magnetic Pole, as well as with the new land discovered by our
expedition to the west of Cape North. This vast plateau
extending, it is practically certain, for over 1200 miles from
north to south, and over 200 miles from east to west, 7000 ft.
high at its northern end, and at least 10,000 ft. at its
southern, is formed superficially of névé. Doubtless beneath the
névé is glacier ice. The névé is possibly of no very great
thickness, for the horizontally bedded or gently inclined plateau
rocks of the Beacon sandstone formation rise to heights of 8000
to 10,000 ft. above sea-level along the eastern border of the
plateau.</p>
<p>This structure of the plateau is illustrated on the diagram
(D02).</p>
<p>(5) Icebergs have already been described under the heading
"Barrier Snow-and Ice-fields".</p>
<p>(6) Pack-ice has also been referred to under the heading "Sea
Ice". It may be noted that in the Ross Sea the bulk of the
pack-ice, formed chiefly of fractured masses of sea ice, partly
of small snowbergs and icebergs, impelled by the south-easterly
winds drifts past Cape Adare to the part of the Antarctic Ocean
which hes between Cape North and the Balleny Islands. This region
appears to be permanently beset with very old pack-ice and
icebergs. As most of the blocks of sea ice have been twisted and
piled on one another, this pack may be described as "screwed
pack".</p>
<p>(7) <span class="aa">Thaw-water forming Surface Lakes, and
Surface, Englacial or Subglacial Streams</span>.&mdash;Some of
the streams formed by thaw-water have already been described
under the head of glaciers, in the case of the Drygalski Glacier.
In the latitude of this glacier in 75° South, the thaw set in
about December 10 and lasted to about the third week in
January.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Lakes and Lake Ice</span>.&mdash;We found it
difficult during the short period of our stay in the Antarctic to
ascertain to what thickness this ice formed during a single
season. The difficulty arose from the fact that in the summer of
1908-1909 the fresh water ice of these lakes did not entirely
thaw.</p>
<p>Some of the lakes were slightly saline, and some of these,
such as Green Lake and Coast Lake, thawed completely during the
summer and during the winter the ice froze over them from top to
bottom until, in the case of Green Lake, in August 1908, only a
very little saline water, a few inches in depth, remained
unfrozen, below a thickness of 5 ft. of ice. At the same time of
year the water of "Coast Lake", also somewhat saline, was frozen
solid, the lake being a little under 5 ft. deep.</p>
<p>In the case of the fresh-water lake, known as Clear Lake, it
was noticed that during the summer the ice thawed chiefly on the
south side of the lake, where it was in contact with the black
rock, and where that rock was specially warmed by the sun's rays.
The sun being highest when it is due north, has its greatest
heating effect on southern slopes. The ice towards the middle and
north side of the lake did not wholly thaw. The same remark is
true of the ice of the Blue Lake near our winter quarters.</p>
<p>In the case of the Blue Lake we found, as the result of the
shafts sunk, that in the south-west division of this lake the ice
was at least 15 ft. in thickness, while in the north-western
division Brocklehurst sunk a shaft to 21 ft., but in his case a
little water was found beneath the ice, whereas in the first case
the ice was solid down to the bed rock. We are of opinion that
this Blue Lake ice had not been thawed for probably at least
three seasons.</p>
<p>As many of these small lakes were enriched by steep banks of
hard rock, the ice, expanding as it formed, was forced to curve
itself upwards in order to make room for itself, as it could not
burst the sides of the rock basin. Thus its surface was
frequently convex upwards. In this process of upward bulging of
the ice towards the lake's centre each successive fresh layer of
ice as it froze beneath the older and overlying layers, would
buckle them and bend them. The latter would at last crack open,
and so in the final stage of freezing of a small shallow lake, by
the time that the whole of the water had frozen from top to
bottom, the basin would be occupied by a biconvex cracked lens of
ice, the cracks being widest at the top and tapering away to
nothing below.</p>
<p>A curious feature which we observed in the lake ice was the
presence of what we termed "snow tabloids". We found that in some
cases these were merely empty bubble-like spaces in the ice
filled with air. In other cases, however, where the bubbles were
larger, 3 to 6 in. in width, they were occupied by snow. In some
cases patches of thin rippled snow were inter-stratified in this
lake ice.</p>
<p>Most of this fresh-water lake ice exhibited at its surface a
very beautiful structure, which we termed coralloidal
structure.</p>
<p>The mode of origin of this curious structure will be discussed
in the Scientific Memoirs of this Expedition.</p>

<p align="center">(b) <span class="aa">Action of Wind in Relation
to Antarctic Glacial Phenomena</span><br></p>
<p>An explanation has already been given of how vast quantities
of finely divided rock material, chiefly in the form of sand, are
constantly being blown on to the sea ice by the wind. For some
distance seawards from the shore such wind-blown material must
form an appreciable amount of the sediments now forming on the
sea floor. Ferrar has already commented on the great importance
of the wind in these regions as a destructive agent.</p>
<p>By accelerating evaporation of snow and ice, and by its
mechanical erosive force on the surfaces of snowfields, the
blizzards are important contributors to the present deglaciation
of Antarctica. The amount of snow annually blown out to sea must
be very great, inasmuch as during blizzards, often of several
days duration, the air is frequently so thick with fine particles
of snow that one cannot see more than a few yards in front of
one. We observed that sledge tracks and footprints on the snows
of the coastal areas, or of the inland plateau, were nearly
always, after the expiry of a few weeks, left in relief. This
suggests that, at present, in many parts of Antarctica the
general surface of the snow and ice is being continually lowered
by ablation and wind drift.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">(c) <span class="aa">Changes of
Temperature</span><br></p>
<p>During spring and autumn when sunrise and sunset replace the
perpetual sunlight of summer, and the perpetual darkness of
winter, the range of temperature between noon and midnight is
most marked. On March 10, 1908, when at an altitude of about 9000
ft., on Mount Erebus, and with the thermometer at about 10°
Fahr., we observed that snow in contact with black lumps of
kenyte lava exposed to the sun's rays thawed rapidly, so that we
were able to get water to drink by laying a lump of snow in
saucer-shaped hollows on the surface of this lava. At night these
same rocks became very cold. There was no question here of the
survival of any original volcanic heat in the lava, as there was
no thaw whatever of the snow where it touched the lava in spots
shaded from the sun's heat. This absorption of heat by black
rocks partly explains the survival of lichens high up on the
slopes of Erebus. It also has the effect of prolonging a
superficial local thaw from summer far into spring, on the one
hand, and autumn on the other. Such a great diurnal range of
temperature, combined with the effects of summer thaw followed by
the severe frosts of winter, exerts a powerful disrupting force
upon the rocks, and accounts for the extensive rubble banks and
sheets and patches of loose and broken felspar crystals, which
are spread over such a large area of country near Mount Erebus,
&amp;c. At our winter quarters at Cape Royds we at first mistook
these for beds of volcanic tuff.</p>
<p align="center"><span class="aa">Volcanic Rocks</span><br></p>
<p><span class="aa">Ross Island</span>.&mdash;As the chief
varieties of volcanic rocks met with in Ross Island have already
been described by Messrs. Ferrar and Prior, a brief description
of these will suffice.</p>
<p>At Ross Island we particularly studied the relations to one
another of the three principal types of rock there developed,
viz., kenyte, trachyte and basalt. We are now in a position to
say that, on the whole, the trachytes appear to have been the
oldest rocks, the kenytes to be of intermediate age, and the
basalts the newest. The evidence for this is as follows:</p>
<p>On the western slopes of Mount Erebus, above our winter
quarters, specimens were not infrequently found of what at first
sight appeared to be fragments of sandstone enclosed in kenyte
lava. A closer inspection of these showed that they were in
reality varieties of trachyte. Similar specimens were met with in
the kenytes near Cape Barne. It would seem from this that the
oldest lavas in this area were trachytes, and that later kenyte
eruptions followed, which partly destroyed the trachytes, and
thus the disrupted trachyte fragments subsequently became
embedded in the kenyte lava. In the next place we found that at
Cape Barne the kenyte had been very powerfully intruded by the
basalt. Large fragments of kenyte were frequently found entangled
in the basalt of the comparatively recent volcanic cone at Cape
Barne, and on a line trending inland in a south-easterly
direction. In the case also of the long spur which extends from
Mount Erebus to the old winter quarters of the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition at Hut Point it is clear that the latest volcanic
products of that locality are scoriaceous basalts. These basalts
are obviously newer than the trachytes of Observation Hill; they
are even newer than the olivine basalts of Sulphur Hill in the
same area. In our ascent of Erebus we found that not only were
there old kenyte lavas developed on its flanks, but that at
intervals on the way up the rock was still kenyte, becoming of
newer and newer age until the modern active crater was reached.
This crater was partly filled with molten lava from June to
September 1908. It is evident from this that some of the kenyte
is amongst the newest of all the volcanic products of Ross
Island. The following table shows the probable chronological
relations of these lavas in descending order:</p>
<table summary="pxxx" align="center" width="100%">
<colgroup>
<col width="60%">
<col width="40%"></colgroup>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top;">Kenyte of modern crater.</td>

&nbsp;</td>
<td style="text-align:right; vertical-align:bottom;">
Trachyte.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><span class="aa">East Coast of Victoria Land.</span>&mdash;The
succession, therefore, on the whole has been from trachyte
through kenyte to olivine-basalt. There can be no doubt that the
whole of the trachytic eruptions, the pre-basaltic kenyte, and
the olivine basalts antedate the epoch of greatest recent
glaciation.</p>
<p>The occurrence of large blocks of kenyte at Gneiss Point, a
few miles to the east-south-east of Granite Harbour, suggests the
possibility that some of the dark sheets of rock near the highest
portions of the plateau may perhaps be formed in part of kenyte.
At the same time it is possible that these kenyte boulders of
Gneiss Point have been drifted northwards from Ross Island
amongst the moraine material of the western branch of the former
gigantic Great Ice Barrier, when it occupied the whole of McMurdo
Sound. Dykes of dark rocks, resembling tinguaites, were not
uncommon from Granite Harbour northwards to near Geikie Inlet,
south of the Drygalski Glacier. We also observed dyke rocks full
of small black bright prismatic crystals of hornblende. These
appear to be of the nature of hornblende lamprophyres. Small
pieces of scoriaceous volcanic rocks were found by us as far
north as Cape Irizar. These fragments may have come from the
mountains of the western plateau.</p>
<p align="center"><span class="aa">Foundation
Rocks</span><br></p>
<p>The oldest rocks seen by us in the Antarctic belong to the
series already described by Ferrar and Prior, and consist of
banded gneiss, gneissic granite granodiorite and diorite rich in
sphene. In some spots, as at Cape Bernacchi, masses of very
coarse white crystalline marble are interspersed in the
gneiss.</p>
<p>These foundation rocks have their planes of foliation sharply
folded in places, as is the case at Depôt Island, the axis of
folding there being approximately parallel to the trend of the
coast-line. Near the same spot huge enclosures can be seen in the
gnessic-granite. These are partly greenish grey quartzites in
masses ten to twenty feet in diameter, partly large lumps of
blackish green coarsely crystalline hornblende rock, with much
sphene and a white mineral, apparently either saussuritised
felspar, or scapolite. In other places, as at Cape Bernacchi,
black tourmaline schists with epidote were frequently
interspersed through the gneiss, and the gneiss was also
traversed by veins of white aplite, with small crystals of
garnet. The coarsely crystalline belt of marble in the gneiss at
Cape Bernacchi contained abundant graphite in the form of small
flakes. It appears to us that the marble and the quartzite
represent an old sedimentary formation, and the large enclosures
of hornblende-and-sphene rock an old amphibolite or gabbro, both
the former and the latter types of rock disrupted by the
intrusive gneissic granites.</p>
<p>Ferrar was of opinion that in the neighbourhood of the hill
marked (<i>d</i>) on his map showing the valley of the Ferrar
Glacier, the grey granite of these hills is older than the
dolerite which rests upon its even upper surface, but that the
pink granite of (<i>d</i>) is intrusive and later than the
dolerite.* This is an important observation. We did not see this
spot, but in other areas, as near Granite Harbour, the dolerite
appeared to be newer than the granites.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Nat. Ant. Exped. Nat. Hist., Vol. i., Geology,

<p align="center"><span class="aa">Older (?)Palæozoic Sedimentary
Rocks</span><br></p>
<p>Apart from the large enclosures of quartzites, &amp;c., in
gneissic granite, already referred to, the next oldest
sedimentary rocks appear to be greenish grey slates brought back
by the Southern Party from the surface of the great glacier up
which they were travelling between Mount Hope and "The
Cloudmaker", in approximately latitude 84° South. These
fragments, as Lieutenant Shackleton informs us, were blown on to
the surface of the ice from what appeared to be mountains of
slate further west. The approximate relative position of these
slate hills and of the granite hill of Mount Hope, and the
nunatak of coal-bearing Beacon sandstone further south is shown
in the photograph.</p>
<p>At Cape Royds we found occasionally, but sparingly, erratics
of radiolarian chert. The radiolaria appear to be of older
Palæozoic type, but we were unable to discover any rock like it
<i>in situ</i>. Obviously at Cape Royds the erratics have
travelled from some spot to the south and west. It is possible
that these black and grey cherts belong to the limestone series
discovered by the Southern Party in 85° 15' South. This limestone
varies in colour from pink to dark grey. The pink limestone is
banded with some dull green earthy mineral; it contains numerous
obscure casts resembling those of radiolaria. The dark bluish
grey portion of this limestone does not show any trace of
organisms. Apparently it has been too much metamorphosed to
retain the outlines of any of its original fossils. It is
traversed in all directions by veins of white calcite. The
limestones appear to be almost horizontally bedded, and are
several hundreds of feet in thickness. The Southern Party were
unable to determine the relation of this massive limestone to the
adjacent Beacon sandstone, as unfortunately there was a break in
the continuity of the section which prevented the junction of
these two formations being seen. This limestone, 7000 ft. above
sea-level, is higher geographically than the Beacon sandstone
formation, but as the latter dips away from it towards the
north-east, the limestone may be stratigraphically below the
Beacon sandstone. The Southern Party discovered large blocks of
limestone breccia in the moraines near "The Cloudmaker". The
fragments in the morainic breccias near this mountain are formed
of limestones, not unlike those of the great nunatak, but whether
these breccias belong to the basal beds of the Beacon sandstone
formation, or to the base of the massive limestones, or to crush
breccia zones in the massive limestones is not as yet apparent.
It is even possible that they may be stratigraphically above the
Beacon sandstone, but this is improbable. Fragments of old
limestones were observed by us in the ancient moraines of the
Mount Nansen Glacier. These were associated with pieces of
sandstone and fragments of grey clay shale with obscure
impressions of fossil roots. This limestone appears to have been
derived from the Beacon sandstone formation. It is very much
altered through recrystallisation, and we have been unable to
recognise in it any fossils.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that when journeying to the South Magnetic
Pole at a spot about twenty miles south-east of Granite Harbour
we found on a small island, Terrace Island, a large fragment of
argillaceous limestone. This had evidently been derived from the
Beacon sandstone formation in the adjacent hills. When broken
open it was found to contain small oval bodies, pointed at one
end, and about one-third of an inch in length resembling seeds of
fossil plants, possibly coniferous seeds.</p>
<p>This specimen was subsequently left at "Depôt Island", and has
not since been recovered.</p>
<p>The Beacon sandstone formation has now been proved to extend
from at least as far as Mount Nansen in the north to latitude 85°
South, where it was explored <i>in situ</i> by the Southern
Party, a distance of fully seven hundred miles. As described by
Ferrar its thickness in the Ferrar Glacier Valley amounts to
fully two thousand feet, and even then the base of the formation
was not seen.</p>
<p>The following is a generalised section of the Beacon sandstone
formation in 85° South, in descending order, from information
supplied by Mr. Shackleton and F. Wild of the Southern party:</p>
<p>500 ft. sandstone.</p>
<p>300 ft. sandstone with bands of shale, and about seven seams
of coal, or seams formed of black shale alternating with laminæ
of bright coal. In this belt the following seams were seen <i>in
situ</i>:</p>
<p class="margin2">1 ft. to 1½ ft. coal seam.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strata.<br>
7 ft. coal seam with bands of grey shale.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strata.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strata.<br>
3 ft. (about) coal seam.</p>
<p>Seven-hundred-foot sandstones with numerous water-worn quartz
pebbles in the lower beds. These pebbles are from one to two
inches in diameter. Total 1500 ft.</p>
<p>In the medial moraine, below the great nunatak in 85° South,
the Southern Party obtained, amongst several specimens of
sandstone with much mother-of-coal, or mineral charcoal, one
specimen of special interest. It was a fragment of fine grained
hard sandstone, evidently derived from the Beacon sandstone
formation higher up, showing a black band one-quarter of an inch
thick running through it. Micro-slides of this examined at the
University prove that it is a coniferous wood. The following
description of it has been written by Mr. E. J. Goddard, B.Sc.,
Macleay Research Fellow of the Linnæan Society, New South
Wales:</p>
<p align="center"><span class="aa">Specimens from Medial Moraine,
December</span> 11, 1908 (No. 101)<br></p>
<p>"Longitudinal sections of the included dark masses give a
homogeneous banded appearance of a distinctly organic nature. The
banded appearance is due to the vascular nature of the organic
elements composing the mass. The whole structure recalls to one's
mind the appearance given by longitudinal sections of the xylem
portion of the vascular area of a gymnosperm, such as
<i>Pinus</i>. Only the xylem area is represented in the specimen,
no traces of medullary, cortical, or phloem tissue being visible.
Medullary rays are present as shown in the micro-photograph.</p>
<p>"The xylem itself is composed of a homogeneous mass of
vessels, tracheidal in nature, no differentiation as regards the
vascular elements being present. In places one may readily make
out in longitudinal sections dark opaque bands of much greater
size individually than the tracheides. These in all probability
represent resin passages belonging to the xylem. It would seem,
further, that these masses might be considered as being nothing
more than an aggregation of material similar in nature to that of
the walls, and due to changes under the process of petrifaction.
This, however, is opposed by the fact that they occur even in
these small sections fairly commonly, and at the same time are
all of exactly the same size as regards width. At all events they
represent some definite structure, and in all probability resin
passages.</p>
<p>"The walls of the tracheids themselves seen under the high
power of the microscope appear to be pitted, but the preservation
is by no means good enough to warrant any remarks on this beyond
that in the common wall of adjacent tracheides occur clear spaces
of the same relative importance as the bordered pits of such a
gymnosperm as <i>Pinus</i>. These clear spaces occur regularly
along the length of the tracheides, and stand out strongly
against the dark colour of the walls in their preserved
condition.</p>
<p>"The nature of the xylem itself leads to the conclusion that
it is a portion of a gymnospermous plant, resembling strongly in
nature the same portion of a coniferous plant."</p>
<p>If the conclusion as to the coniferous character of the wood
is correct, and there seems little reason to doubt its
correctness, the lower limit of the age of the Beacon sandstone
is perhaps Lower Carboniferous or Upper Devonian, unless conifers
in the Antarctic had a deeper range in geological time than
elsewhere.</p>
<p>The plate shows the general appearance under the microscope of
this fossil wood. The medullary rays are fairly distinct.</p>
<p>This is the first determinable fossil plant that has been
obtained from the Victoria Land portion of the Antarctic.</p>
<p>Although a date not older than Carboniferous or Devonian is
suggested by the presence of this coniferous wood, it is of
course possible that the Beacon sandstone is of higher geological
antiquity, and if the radiolarian rocks, already referred to, are
conformable with the Beacon sandstone, it may even go far down
into the older Palæozoic.</p>
<p>The degree of induration of these unfolded plateau sandstones
and the general absence of fossils from the limestones is
suggestive of a high geological antiquity.</p>

<p align="center"><span class="aa">Raised Beaches</span><br></p>
<p>Raised beaches were observed at two distinct localities on the
western slopes of Ross Island, also near the mouth of the Ferrar
Glacier, as well as to the south-east of Mount Larsen.</p>
<p>The first locality on Ross Island was discovered by Armytage;
the second locality by one of us; the raised beaches near the
Ferrar Glacier also by one of us; while the Mount Larsen raised
beaches were observed by the Northern Party on their journey to
the South Magnetic Pole. These four localities may be referred to
as:</p>
<p class="margin2">(1) Back Door Bay deposit.<br>
(2) Cape Barne deposit.<br>
(3) Ferrar Glacier deposit.<br>
(4) Mount Larsen deposit.</p>
<p>Deposit (1) lies at a height of 160 ft. above sea-level. It
was found at the bottom of a shallow flat-bottomed gulley sloping
down eastwards into a small arm of McMurdo's Sound, called by us
Back Door Bay. The area of the deposit was only a few square
yards. It consisted of a brownish earthy material with abundant
remains of crushed tubes of serpulæ. Diatoms were fairly abundant
in it. We were at first in some doubt as to whether this serpula
deposit was a genuine raised beach, or merely a mass of sandy
material from the sea floor pushed up by the ploughing action of
the old McMurdo Sound ice sheet. There has, of course, been a
similar question raised in regard to the so-called raised beaches
of Moel Tryfaen in North Wales. The subsequent discovery by one
of us of an extensive raised beach at an altitude of about 180
ft. near Cape Barne (deposit 2) is confirmatory evidence as to
the genuine raised beach character of the first-mentioned
deposit. At this Cape Barne deposit the material is largely
formed of spicules of siliceous sponges and molluscan shells, as
well as the remains of serpulæ. The nature of the organisms there
present is such as to render it probable that the deposit was
formed in water of some depth. It may therefore indicate an
elevation of this part of the coast near Cape Barne, not merely
of 180 ft., but perhaps of double that amount.</p>
<p>Deposit (3) near the entrance of the Ferrar Glacier Valley.
These deposits chiefly consist of brownish sands with very
numerous shells of a large species of pectens. They were
discovered by one of us, and traced to altitudes of from 50 to 60
ft. Further north at Cape Bernacchi there are strongly marked
terraces suggestive of raised beaches, which were observed by the
Northern Party to extend up to altitudes of 100 ft. At Terrace
Island, about twenty miles to the north of Cape Bernacchi we
observed well-marked terraces, ranging up to about 80 to 85 ft.
above sea-level. These had every appearance of having been laid
down by the action of the sea, though no sea-shells were found
amongst the sands and coarse gravel constituting this
deposit.</p>
<p>Deposit (4) south-east of Mount Larsen. A very curious type of
what may be termed a raised beach or possibly an upthrust area,
was observed by us on our journey from the sea ice near the
Drygalski Glacier to the foot of the small branch glacier at what
we called Backstairs Passage. This moraine deposit consisted of
greenish grey muds underlying coarse moraines of granite blocks
and quartz and felspar porphyry. Beneath the grey muds was ice;
the ice was just very sightly saline in places. These muds
contained remains of serpulæ in great quantity, an enormous
number of shells of that well-known Arctic type amongst the
foraminifera, <i>Biloculina</i>, numerous representatives of
horny polyzoa, siliceous sponges, and a perfect form of solitary
coral allied to a perfect shell of lyothyrina, &amp;c.,
dentalium, chiton, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The height of this deposit above sea-level could not be
definitely ascertained by us. It was at least 20 ft., possibly as
much as 30 ft., above the sea.</p>
<p>The evidence generally of these raised beaches is very
interesting, as showing the probability that when the ice, in
recent geological time, had its maximum extension in this region,
there was probably a subsidence, possibly due to the load, on
this part of the earth's crust, of such a vast extra thickness of
ice, and that after the subsidence, which probably lagged behind
the epoch of maximum glaciation, there has been a gradual
re-emergence to the amount of 150 to 200 ft. The brachiopod and
polyzoon in the raised marine mud from the Larsen area have
kindly been identified for us by Mr. C. Hedley and Mr. E. F.
Hallman respectively, of the Australian Museum.</p>
<p align="center"><span class="aa">Peat Deposits</span><br></p>
<p>Amongst formations of recent origin may be mentioned peat. A
deposit of peat was discovered by one of us formed on the bottom
of the lake called Coast Lake.</p>
<p>This peat is formed from the remains of a large fungoid plant,
which grows in profusion in the water of these coastal lakes when
the ice thaws in midsummer.</p>
<p>A deposit of mirabilite was discovered by one of us at the
spot shown on the map near Cape Barne, after the summer thaw had
set in. The white colour of the salt during winter rendered it
indistinguishable from the surrounding snow, but after the thaw
the difference of course was noticeable between this white salt
and the edges of the dark volcanic rock.</p>
<p>Apparently this mirabilite forms one of the products of
evaporation of an old lake. Numbers of these dried lake basins
were noticed by us amongst the glacial moraines on these western
slopes of Erebus near Cape Barne and our winter quarters.</p>
<p>In regard to the important theoretical question as to whether
the west coast of Victoria Land is of an Atlantic or of a Pacific
type, the following considerations present themselves.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="dia03" id="dia03"></a><img alt="" src=
"1402771h-images/dia03.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>D03. <span class="aa">Fungus&mdash;Peat
And Ice Deposits</span></small></p>
<p>As pointed out by H. T. Ferrar, the massive Beacon sandstone
formation terminates in steep, and in places precipitous, slopes
along the whole line of coast from beyond Cape North southerly to
Mount Discovery. From there to where Mr. Shackleton and his
Southern Party, after ascending the granite and slate mountains
of this coastal range in latitude 83° 33', longitude 170° East,
reached 85° South at an altitude of 6000 ft. sedimentary rocks
were found to cap the ranges. They were disposed in gently
dipping or nearly horizontal strata, and extended south-easterly
to at least 86° South.</p>
<p>At the Great Nunatak in latitude 85° South, longitude 165°
East, the sandstone beds containing the seven seams of coal dip
in a north-easterly direction at an angle of about 6° to 8°.
There was no evidence there, nor as far northwards as our
explorations extended, that is, to Mount Nansen, of any folding
in the Beacon sandstone formation.</p>
<p>At Depôt Island, to the north of Granite Harbour, the ancient
gneiss platform is there folded parallel with the coast-line, but
this structure appeared to be the exception rather than the
rule.</p>
<p>The Beacon sandstone, for reasons already given, is perhaps as
old as Palæozoic, possibly older Palæozoic. So, if the above
conclusions are correct, there has been no appreciable folding in
the part of Victoria Land examined by us since Palæozoic
time.</p>
<p>The coastline is, therefore, in our opinion, of the Atlantic
rather than of the Pacific type, and probably owes its trend and
position to a powerful fault or zone of faults, with a down-throw
to the east. The volcanoes Mount Melbourne, Mount Erebus, Mount
Discovery, &amp;c., are probably on this fracture, or zone of
fractures. If this view as to the Atlantic type of this part of
the coast is correct, what has become of the great Andean folds
developed on the west side of Graham Land?</p>
<p>Possibly as Wilckens has suggested, west of Alexander I Land
the Cordillera is submerged through faulting.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Centralblatt für Min. Geol. und Pal., 1906,
No. 6, p. 179.]</p>
<p>In this case the Ross Sea subsidence area (if such it be)
would have approximately the same relation to the Andean
trend-lines in the Antarctic that the Gulf of Mexico and the
Antillean and West Indian fracture zones bear to the trend-lines
of the tropical Andes. It must, nevertheless, be admitted that
the Great South Polar Shield of ancient and practically
incompressible crystalline rock, intensely folded in the past,
would be incapable of being further folded now, and if the Andean
zone of disturbance traversed this shield it would be likely to
traverse it as a zone of fractures with local lava effusions,
rather than as a fold range of the Pacific type. This important
matter will be discussed by us in detail in the Geological Memoir
of this Expedition.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Summary</span>.&mdash;The following
inferences are tentatively suggested in regard to the geology of
Antarctica:</p>
<p>(1) The majority of the tabular bergs of this region are
largely, in some cases wholly, snowbergs, not icebergs.</p>
<p>(2) True icebergs are also found.</p>
<p>(3) Glaciers in the Antarctic push out in some cases thirty
miles from the coast, and must be afloat, as argued by Ferrar,
for the greater part of this length.</p>
<p>(4) The Great Ice Barrier is formed of true glacier ice at its
sides and inland extremity, but the centre and seaward portion is
formed, in its upper part, chiefly of snow. We agree with Captain
Scott's conclusions that the Great Barrier except at its edges
and perhaps at some distance inland must be afloat. At its
eastern side it has been moving seawards at the average rate of
about five hundred yards a year for the past seven years.</p>
<p>(5) Throughout the whole of the region of Antarctica examined
by us, for 16° of latitude, there is evidence of a recent great
diminution in the glaciation. In McMurdo Sound this arm of the
sea now free from land ice was formerly filled by a branch of the
Great Ice Barrier, whose surface rose fully 1000 ft. above
sea-level, and the Barrier ice in this sound, in areas from which
the ice has retreated, was formerly about 4000 ft. in
thickness.</p>
<p>(6) The snowfall at Cape Royds from February 1908 to February
1909 was equal to about 9½ in. of rain.</p>
<p>(7) The névé-fields of Antarctica are probably of no great
thickness.</p>
<p>(8) The southern and western sides of the sector of Antarctica
south of Australia is a plateau from 7000 to 10,000 ft. high,
which may possibly extend across the South Pole to Coat's Land
and Graham Land.</p>
<p>(9) Ross Sea is probably a great subsidence area.</p>
<p>(10) The Beacon sandstone formation which extends for at least
1100 miles from north to south in Antarctica contains coniferous
wood associated with coal seams. It is probably of Palæozoic
age.</p>
<p>(11) Limestones, pisolitic in places, in 85° 15' South, and
7000 ft, above sea-level contain obscure casts of radiolaria.</p>
<p>Radiolaria, in a fair state of preservation, occur in black
cherts amongst the erratics at Cape Royds. They appear to belong
to the same formation as the limestone. These radiolaria appear
to be of older Palæozoic age.</p>
<p>(12) The succession of lavas at Erebus appears to have been
first trachytes, then kenytes, then olivine basalts. Erebus is,
however, still erupting kenyte.</p>
<p>(13) Peat deposits, formed of fungus, are now forming on the
bottoms of some of the Antarctic glacial lakes near 77° and 78°
South.</p>
<p>(14) Raised beaches of recent origin extend at Ross Island to
a height of at least 160 ft. above sea-level.</p>

EREBUS</h4>

DAVID<br>
<span class="aa">and</span> RAYMOND PRIESTLEY</h4>
<p align="center"><span class="aa">Volcanic
Eruptions</span><br></p>
<p><b>WE</b> observed that the eruptions of Erebus, like those of
Stromboli, were most frequent during a low barometer. The
following is a description of the chief eruption of Erebus
witnessed by us on June 14, 1908:</p>
<p>This morning, about 8.45 <span class="uu">a.m.</span>, as the
small blizzard of the preceding night was subsiding we noticed
that Erebus was more than usually active; the steam cloud over
its summit was broader and taller than usual; and there were
frequent outbursts of steam.</p>
<p>At 11.30 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> it was noticed that an
eruption of altogether unprecedented vigour, as far as our
experience of Erebus went, was in progress. Immense masses of
steam rushed upwards to at least 2000 ft. above the summit in
about half a minute, and spread out to form a vast
mushroom-shaped cloud. This rapidly became asymmetrical; while
the main steam column was bent over to the left (northerly) by
the return air current from the Pole, the higher ascending
portion, at about 2500 to 3000 ft. was carried by the upper
current in a southerly, or more probably south-easterly
direction. At about 2.30 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> there was a
specially grand outburst of steam. It rushed upwards nearly
vertically, just a trifle bent to the north, and dashed its head
with great violence through the mushroom-shaped cloud or canopy,
emerged on the other side, and must have ascended there from 1000
to 2000 ft. higher; in all about 5000 ft. above the summit of the
mountain.</p>

<p align="center"><small>115. <span class="aa">Erebus Eruption of
June 14, 1908, showing Upper Air Currents</span></small></p>
<p>At 3.15 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> a bright glow was seen on
Erebus by Messrs. Priestley, Murray and Mackay. It illuminated
the whole steam column to the base of the mushroom. We observed
that the top of this column then spread out gradually, first into
a club-headed lump, then into a mushroom-like form.</p>
<p>At 3.25 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> a remarkably bright glow
suddenly lit up all the lower part of the steam column above the
crater. This was seen by Shackleton, Priestley and Day.</p>
<p>By 3.45 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> the steam cloud had
spread out much more and had besides risen higher, and the first
formed portions of the cloud trailed away in long streamers to
the south with one extensive branch going first north by east,
then north-westerly.</p>
<p>At 3.50 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> there was another bright
glow. As regards the uprushes of steam the interval may not have
been constant, but it seemed to be about four to five
minutes.</p>
<p>Towards 6 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> the bend over the steam
column to the north-north-west or north-west was more strongly
marked, and the asymmetry of the steam cloud was due to a
preponderating amount of steam gathering to the north-west side
of Erebus. By this time the older part of the steam cloud had
formed a species of thin cirrus cloud, about 20,000 ft. to 30,000
ft. above sea-level.</p>
<p>At 6.40 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> Shackleton observed a
very bright glow on the steam cloud.</p>
<p>By 8 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> the eruption appeared to be
subsiding, and the steam cloud meanwhile stretched across the
sky, now in a direction from east-south-east to west-north-west
(the surface wind was at the time about north-north-east), and
appeared to be passing almost over Sandy Beach and Horseshoe Bay.
It was now delicately draped in the form of sinuous thin folds
like a thin muslin skirt. Evidently the wind direction had
changed at the summit level to about east-south-east to
west-north-west.</p>
<p>That night there was a full moon. The sky a lovely deep blue
near the zenith, paler towards the horizon. When the moon came
over the great steam cloud of Erebus (22½° of arc) the scene was
sublime. Its light was brightly reflected from the small glaciers
at the south-west foot of the cone of Erebus; all the rest of the
west and north-west slope was in deep shadow. In middle distance
below the base of the cone soft white mist swathed the mountain.
Near Backdoor Bay and Cape Royds brightly moonlit patches of snow
showed up the black and dark brown patches of rock; our hut and
stable in the middle of the foreground with the dazzling white
surface of our little lake with its winding bays and coves.</p>
<p>On June 17, at 8 <span class="uu">p.m.</span>, we noticed
remarkable white cloud-like dense white cumulus to
north-north-east over the ridge at the back of our hut and
towards Horseshoe Bay.</p>
<p>At 11 <span class="uu">p.m.</span> (about) Mawson came running
down from Anemometer ridge to say that an eruption had broken out
from a new quarter. We rushed out and witnessed a distinct
eruption amongst the huge masses of steam hanging in the air to
the north-north-east. The new mass of steam, of great volume,
rolled up rapidly, starting at perhaps 2000 ft. above sea-level,
to probably at least 5000 ft. above the sea. A photograph was
taken of it, and afterwards more distinct steam eruptions were
witnessed.</p>
<p>The eruption appeared to have its origin on the southerly and
south-south-west slope of Mount Bird, at perhaps about 2000 ft.
above the sea-level. The steam cloud appeared to ascend to a
height of about 5000 ft. above sea-level in an incredibly short
space of time. These fumaroles or intermittent geysers must be
among the most powerful known. They appear to be developed near
the meridional earth crack which extends from Mount Bird
southerly through Mount Erebus.</p>
<p>A description of the craters of Erebus has already been given
in the narrative of this work, and the fact is emphasized that
the interior of the old crater is largely filled with layers of
large felspar crystals and pumice, alternating with beds of snow.
Five of these felspar crystals are figured on the accompanying
plate.</p>

<h4><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>II.1: ICE AND SNOW</h4>
<h4><span class="aa">Notes by</span> DOUGLAS MAWSON, B.Sc.,
B.E.</h4>
<p><b>THE</b> most interesting results were obtained in a study
of ice in all its forms, the temperature conditions in such a
climate producing phenomena hardly to be realized by the student
of more temperate regions. At temperatures even far below
freezing-point, snow is able to compact itself and become quite
hard by a slow process of vaporisation and recrystallisation. The
tendency is for the smaller snow particles to disappear and the
larger to be added to at their expense, and when other conditions
are suitable well-formed crystals are built up in this way. Thus
well-developed hexagonal barrel-shaped crystals of ice were found
developed on a seal's liver, which had been buried during the
winter.</p>
<p>Variations in atmospheric temperatures were always accompanied
by phenomena such as this; for example, at times of falling
temperature, no matter through what limits, a development of
spicular ice formed over all exposed objects. This accompanied a
fall of even, say, from 50° Fahr. to 60° Fahr. below
freezing-point. Serious interference with spectroscopic work was
thus introduced on account of the camera lens becoming thickly
coated with ice. A similar phenomenon was continually produced in
a small laboratory built as an adjunct to the hut. This opened
indirectly by the outer passage to the interior of the hut. Moist
air from the living-quarters, kept at a mean temperature just
above freezing-point, circulated through the cracks around the
door and entered the laboratory, which for the most of the time
maintained a mean temperature of 40° Fahr. to 50° Fahr. below
freezing-point; there the water vapour crystallised out, coating
the walls and passages with a thick formation of ice blades. The
result was exquisitely beautiful, but most undesirable, finally
making it necessary to abandon the room for everything but ice
work.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic119" id="pic119"></a><img alt=""

<p align="center"><small>119. <span class="aa">Ice Crystals on

src="1402771h-images/pic120.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>120. <span class="aa">Ice
Formations</span></small></p>
<p>In the same way ice formations appeared on the colder portions
of the interior of the hut. In crevasses beautifully formed
crystals up to four inches in length were found developed on the
walls from circulating vapour. Along cracks in the sea ice during
winter such formations were abundantly produced. In such
situations the seawater actually "smokes", an effect due to the
freezing out of abundant water vapour present in the warmer air
ascending from it. This condensation produces beautiful fern-like
crystal formations, not only on the sides of the cracks but also
on the frozen sea surface itself; these ice flowers are best
developed when the surface waters freeze most rapidly.</p>
<p>During the formation of the surface ice some of the sea salts
are squeezed upward through capillary cracks to the surface and
there in the form of concentrated brine eventually freeze as
cryo-hydrates and form nuclei for additions from atmospheric
water vapour. The net result is the production of little
rosette-shaped aggregates of radiating crystal blades, which were
met with up to two inches in height.</p>
<p>As a rule, however, the moisture is precipitated from the
atmosphere in the form of snow. Rain is quite unknown in South
Victoria Land. Many varieties of snow were observed. When
precipitation occurred near freezing-point the snow fell as large
six-rayed feathery flakes. It appeared that even at the same
temperature, if the chilling of the vapour-laden air was more
rapid, the snow fell as tiny felted spheres, one-tenth of an inch
and more in diameter. This we referred to as sago, or tapioca
snow, according to the coarseness of the grain. Snow falling in
colder conditions, appears as tiny compact six-rayed crystals. At
times when low temperatures prevailed, the air was filled with
tiny crystals of ice about one-hundredth of an inch in diameter
descending from a cloudless sky.</p>
<p>Recently fallen snow is quite soft, but soon compacts itself.
This may take place in summer-time within a few hours should a
cold period succeed a warmer one. A piecrust-like surface is
produced in this way where a superficial hardening of the soft
snow has preceded, though not sufficiently strong to support a
heavily laden sledge. Very soon, however, the snow becomes more
firmly bound together, and the usual smooth-sledging type of
winter snow-ice surface is produced. What is known as barrier ice
in the Antarctic is an immensely thick formation of this
compacted snow horizontally stratified. This is what one sees in
the face of the Ross Barrier and numerous other small barriers
along the coast. Its characteristic horizontal surface, vertical
fractures, and dazzling whiteness distinguish it from other
varieties of ice even at a great distance. Nearer at hand, the
stratification lines, appearing every few inches apart, are
readily noticeable. Such barrier ice is really a snowfield afloat
and may be expected in tongue-like forms jutting out into the sea
at the debouchure of glaciers, or forming the cliffs along the
sea-fronts of piedmont glacier-slopes. The granules increase in
size and are more intimately interlocked in the lower portions of
such formations. The tabular icebergs typical of the Antarctic
which have originated by breaking off from the barriers, are,
owing to the nature of their formation, less dense and far more
buoyant than the transparent glacier-icebergs of the Arctic. The
plateau ice, existing under conditions of great cold, sparse
snowfall, and continuous strong winds, is predominantly hard. At
a short distance below the surface it is still finely granular,
but very compact. This is seen where the blizzards have abraded
the superficial softer formation and exposed the deeper ice in
channelled sastrugi; it then resembles polished Carrara marble.
The more typical glacier-ice consists of interlocking crystals an
inch or more in diameter.</p>
<p>In the vicinity of Cape Royds there are a number of small
lakes occupying rocky basins. The smaller of these thaw out each
year during summer, others are only partly thawed, or not at all.
In these, refrigeration during the autumn proceeds under tranquil
conditions. As a result the ice appears prismatic with the longer
axes of the prisms parallel and vertical. Winter snow, falling on
this surface, slowly consolidates, building at the same time
similarly oriented additions to the surface ends of the lake ice
prisms. Should several years succeed without thawing, a most
interesting structure is produced, the nature of which is made
evident by the subsequent removal by blizzards of the
unconsolidated snow. It then presents a smooth, polished surface
exhibiting a mosaic appearance, produced by clear ice prisms
separated by lines of white ice containing air cavities.</p>
<p>As refrigeration goes on in the lakes, the saline contents are
gradually concentrated in the residual liquid and a continuously
increasing cold is required to freeze each succeeding separation.
Ultimately a meshwork of ice and cryo-hydrate crystals is formed
at the bottom of the lakes. As some of the lakes are very saline,
this cryo-hydrate often bulks large. Some of it freezes at as low
a temperature as 50° Fahr. below freezing-point.</p>
<p>In the case of sea-ice the first stages differ somewhat from
those of lake-ice. On account of the wave movements, the regular
growth of vertical prisms is seldom possible in the initial
stages. Instead, delicate glancing scale-like crystals of ice
form on the surface and are seen floating about, even at the
depth of several feet. The single scales are but an inch or less
in diameter, but they soon unite to form freely floating
rosettes. Eventually, as these become more abundant, a complete
felt-work is produced. In this stage the ice, only one to three
inches in thickness, is partially transparent and appears dark,
as the colour of the sea shows through it. This ice is peculiarly
flexible. Unless a heavy swell intervenes the ice is now
sufficiently strong to hold together and to aid in maintaining
the sea in a tranquil state. If, however, the swell increases,
the ice is broken into pieces of a foot or more in diameter,
depending on its thickness at the time. These fragments, jostling
each other continuously, become rounded and develop a turned-up
rim. This is called pancake ice. Eventually, with the advent of
calmer conditions, the pancake ice may be firmly frozen together.
Crystallisation now proceeds by additions from below. Thus,
vertical prismatic ice similar to that found in the lakes is
produced. These prisms may be half an inch in diameter, and many
inches in length. A few hours of still, cold weather goes far to
freeze over the sea. If, however, the air temperature rises, the
active formation of ice is suspended, to be resumed when the
temperature again falls. By a succession of such variations in
temperature a horizontal banded appearance is produced in the
sea-ice; each band representing a separate period of
refrigeration. The lake-ice often showed a banded appearance
resembling this, and the greater or lesser abundance of air
bubbles set free from the frozen water and included in the ice is
due to a similar cause. The banding in the sea-ice is due to an
alteration of more and less opaque layers of ice, of half an inch
to several inches in thickness. The sea salt mechanically
separates from the ice as the latter forms and is partially
forced out into the sea water below, and partially included in
white vertical tracts between the ice prisms. When the unfrozen
sea surface is agitated by winds at very low temperatures, the
spray is apt to freeze as it scuds through the air and it falls
back as ice. In this way the whole surface of the sea may assume
a pea-soup-like consistency. Strong winds, producing a swell, may
break up the solid sea-ice and drive it along as a field of
separate floating masses. This is termed pack-ice, and may
eventually become frozen together as an irregular surface field
of ice. In cases of this kind huge icebergs are not infrequently
found frozen in amongst the smaller ice. Where the wind drives
floe ice before it, pressure ridges may be formed by the mounting
of some of the ice upon that in front; fragments may be piled up
to many feet in height, an operation usually accompanied by a
great crunching and grinding noise.</p>

<p>During the autumn, sea spray, dashing on the coast, remains
behind as ice. Thus a huge ice-foot develops along the coast.
Grottoes are not uncommon in this ice-foot, resembling limestone
eaves of remarkable beauty, filled with stalactites (up to
several feet in length), and stalagmites of ice. These owe their
origin largely to the fact that the more saline residual water
dripping from the roof is further chilled by exposure, and thus
continual additions are made to the formations from which the
drip has taken place. The water is highly saline and stalagmites
are produced only at very low temperatures, when they may consist
entirely of cryo-hydrate.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>II.2: MINERALS AND
CHEMISTRY</h3>
<h4><span class="aa">Notes by</span> DOUGLAS MAWSON, B.Sc.,
B.E.</h4>
<p>A large variety of minerals, chiefly rock-forming types, were
met with by the expedition. The minerals included felspar,
pyroxenes, amphiboles, micas, garnet, &amp;c. Among the most
notable features was the occurrence of idiomorphic felspar
crystals a couple of inches in length, found abundantly scattered
about the old crater of Erebus. These had apparently been
expelled by the explosive force of steam from the molten lava in
which they occurred.</p>
<p>Epidote, actinolite, tourmaline and calcite in the form of
marble, were abundantly developed in the vicinity of Cape
Bernacchi. In the marble cubes of graphite and iron pyrites,
together with some tetrahedra of copper pyrites, were observed.
In a moraine in this vicinity also a boulder of reef quartz
containing iron pyrites was observed. Natrolite was found in
seams in boulders of basic lava in a moraine near Mount Larsen.
Titanium minerals appeared to be abundant in the eruptive rocks
and schists met with between Granite Harbour and Mount
Larsen.</p>
<p>An important occurrence of mirabilite near Cape Barne was
noted by Priestley. This he found in rough masses several pounds
in weight piled up at the northern end of one of the lakes. It is
at a situation some height above the present lake level, but no
doubt owes its origin to salts originally contained in the lake
water. Gypsum was found by Joyce in fissures amongst the kenyte
at the Penguin Rookery, Cape Royds. Mixtures of magnesium and and
sodium sulphates, apparently originally derived from the sea, are
to be found under most of the loose stones in the neighbourhood
of Cape Royds. Sea spray and blown saline snow has no doubt
carried these salts to their present resting-place.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a>II.3: METEOROLOGICAL
OPTICS</h3>
<h4><span class="aa">Notes by</span> DOUGLAS MAWSON, B.Sc.,
B.E.</h4>
<p align="center"><small>MIRAGE.</small><br></p>
<p>Wonderful exhibitions of mirage were of daily occurrence,
especially in the early morning hours. In summer time, travelling
over the sea-ice on the Magnetic Pole journey, it was usually
impossible to make theodolite observations between the hours of 1
<span class="uu">a.m.</span> and 6 <span class="uu">a.m.</span>
on account of the extreme distortion of distant objects due to
mirage effects. This was attributable to the fact that, at about
this hour, a large body of cold dense air descends from the great
plateau of South Victoria Land, flowing down the glacier valleys
and mingling with the warmer air over the sea-ice. For the same
reason the western mountains observed from Cape Royds, always
loomed larger in the early morning. Distant capes viewed over the
open water often appeared to be hung up in the sky.</p>
<p>The type of illusion known as <i>Fata Morgana</i> was of very
frequent occurrence in the case of distant floating ice rafts;
the warmer stratum of the air in proximity to the sea causing the
slight irregularities on the ice surface to appear as lofty
pinnacles.</p>
<p align="center"><small>RINGS AND CROSSES ROUND THE SUN AND
MOON</small><br></p>
<p>These phenomena, proceeding from the refraction of the light
of the sun and moon, were numerous and varied. Both large and
small rings were observed. Usually only those portions of the
ring appeared which neighboured on the horizontal line through
the sun or moon, normal to the line of sight. Parhelia and
parselene of this kind were of common occurrence.</p>
<p>In summer-time on the plateau we observed the most complicated
and gorgeous phenomena of this kind. These were always best seen
through coloured glasses.</p>
<p>During the winter a fine example of a parselene appeared
between us and Mount Erebus. The image must have been formed
within a mile or two of us.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="colpicD" id="colpicD"></a><img alt=""
src="1402771h-images/colpicD.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>A. <span class="aa">A
Parselene</span></small></p>
<p>In winter when the atmosphere was cold, clear and still,
similar rings could be artificially formed near the face by
breathing towards the moon. The moisture in the breath freezes
instantly on leaving the body, and the optical effect is produced
in the cloud of tiny floating ice particles.</p>
<p>Rings, coloured like the rainbow, closely investing the moon,
were of frequent occurrence during the winter night. On one
occasion a magnificent exhibition of this kind appeared as a
series of three coloured rings; that nearest the moon showed the
colours of the first order in Newton's scale; the second and
third rings showed the second and third orders respectively. The
effect was similar to that seen when viewing a uniaxial crystal
in convergent polarised light along the principal axis.</p>
<p align="center"><small>OTHER COLOUR EFFECTS</small><br></p>
<p>At certain periods of the year certain clouds are seen very
brightly coloured. This colouring is strong, and all the colours
of Newton's scale are seen as in the rainbow. This succession of
colours increases in a direction away from the sun. The orders of
colour increase successively with a corresponding reduction in
distinctiveness, until too faint for observation. An isolated
patch of cloud illuminated in this way resembles a fragment of a
mineral like olivine viewed through an analyser under polarised
light. This phenomenon was strongly shown only for the few days
preceding the departure and the arrival of the sun respectively
before and after the winter night.</p>
<p>Especially at the intermediate seasons of the year the advent
and departure of the sun each day was accompanied by prismatic
sunset and sunrise effects. Mount Erebus was often bathed in a
delicate pink light.</p>
<p>Purple lights are apt to be produced on snow surfaces when
obliquely lighted.</p>
<p>Cavities in snow formations appear of a wonderful azure blue
colour. Those in ice, on the other hand, appear bluish-green, or
greenish.</p>
<p align="center"><small>EARTH SHADOWS</small><br></p>
<p>The earth shadows, or dark shadow bands crossing the sky, seen
when the sun is very low on the horizon, were observed in a
variety of forms. Some of these certainly bore a relation to the
relative positions of Mount Erebus and the sun. When on top of
Mount Erebus we remarked the great conical shadow it threw at
sunrise over McMurdo Sound and even as far as the western
mountains. It was noted later on that a relationship existed
between some of the earth shadows seen in the sky from Cape Royds
and this conical shadow of Erebus.</p>
<p>Other forms of the shadows are not so easily explained. On one
occasion when the sun was low on the northern horizon near noon,
just after its return, we observed the sky overhead crossed by
six parallel earth shadow beams, directed from the sun supplying
a Noah's Ark appearance.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-24" id="ch-24"></a>II.4: MAGNETIC
OBSERVATIONS<br>
<br>
THE MAGNETIC POLE AND THE AURORA</h3>
<h4><small>NOTES BY</small> DOUGLAS MAWSON, B.Sc., B.E.</h4>
<p>There are two* localities where the lines of magnetic force
stand perpendicular to the earth's surface. One of these is
situated in the Northern Hemisphere to the north-west of Hudson
Bay and is called the North Magnetic Pole; the other, in the
Southern Hemisphere, in the northern part of South Victoria Land,
is known as the South Magnetic Pole.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Observations of dip in the Northern Hemisphere
indicate the existence of two magnetic poles of unequal strength.
The stronger of these is regarded as the North Magnetic Pole, the
other is situated in Siberia and is generally referred to as the
Asiatic focus.]</p>
<p>The lines of magnetic force are imaginary lines passing
through any place in the direction along which a freely suspended
magnet will align itself. In the vicinity of the magnetic poles
such a magnet stands vertically and at intermediate positions
assumes an angle intermediate between a vertical and a horizontal
position. The south-seeking end of the magnet dips downwards and
is attracted towards the South Magnetic Pole in the Southern
Hemisphere, whilst in the Northern Hemisphere it is the
north-seeking end of the magnet which dips.</p>
<p>Magnets mounted as compasses are balanced on a vertical pivot
and consequently they are free to swing in a horizontal circle
only. They are controlled by the horizontal components of the
earth's magnetic force at the spot where any observations is made
and consequently, if used at the magnetic poles, where the whole
of the magnetic force is vertical, they are unaffected and
useless. The dip circle is the instrument used for measuring the
vertical component of magnetic force, and consequently it is a
very important instrument in the polar regions. It consists of a
magnetised needle swinging on a horizontal axis, and the readings
are taken in degrees from the vertical.</p>
<p>The magnetic poles, or ends of the magnetic axis of the earth,
do not bear any necessary relation to the geographical poles,
which are the extremities of the rotation axis of the earth. They
are not diametral, but are unsymmetrically placed. In this
connection one authority says: "In natural magnets the points at
which attraction takes place, otherwise called poles, are
generally unsymmetrically placed and depend entirely on the
internal structure of the magnet as well as on the irregularities
of its surface."</p>
<p>The magnetic poles are not fixed spots but are constantly
travelling onward, executing an unknown path and apparently
completing a cycle in a period of many hundreds of years. Besides
this onward movement of a few miles per year, there is a lesser
daily oscillation. The North Magnetic Pole was reached in 1831 by
Sir James Clark Ross, who afterwards visited the Antarctic in the
hope of securing the double event, but he was successful only in
locating the South Magnetic Pole by observations made on his ship
at a distance. In the interval between 1841, when these
observations were made, and 1902, when the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition again located the South Magnetic Pole, it had moved
about two hundred geographical miles to the eastward.</p>
<p>Observations of magnetic declination and dip were taken at
intervals along the route to the South Magnetic Pole. Those taken
on the coast, when compared with values determined by the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition, indicate that the magnetic pole has,
in the interval, moved in a northerly and westerly direction.
This fact was further ascertained by actually sledging inland
from the Drygalski Barrier, following as nearly as possible the
magnetic meridian, until the dip readings showed approximate
verticality. Here the flag was hoisted. The determination of the
exact centre of the magnetic polar area could not be made on the
spot, as it would involve a large number of readings taken at
positions surrounding the Pole. The execution of such
observations under conditions of such low temperature and
prevalent high winds is a matter of very great difficulty, and
when it is borne in mind that many days would be necessary for
the operations, the impossibility of such a course for
sledging-parties such as ours is obvious.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE AURORA AUSTRALIS</small><br></p>
<p>The aurora was first observed during the evening of March 26,
1908. Earlier in the season the daylight overpowered the light of
the aurora, and therefore observations were not possible. After
October 4, 1908, likewise, observations were not possible on
account of the continuous daylight. Nevertheless, the aurora was
probably in the heavens during the summer-time, as observations
made by the ship's party in lower latitudes showed. As the
<i>Nimrod</i> travelled north into regions where dark nights
prevailed, auroral displays were observed both in the latter part
of February 1908 and early in March 1909. Between the dates of
March 26 and October 4 scarcely twenty-four hours passed without
some display. At times the auroral lights were present in the
heavens for many days together, though of course at full moon the
brilliancy of the light obscured the more delicate auroral
effects. Certain hours of the day were attended by greater
displays than others. About half-past seven in the evening a
brilliant display was to be expected and this continued with
little reduction in intensity throughout the evening hours. The
effect increased in brilliancy at about four o'clock in the
morning, and died away towards 7 <span class="uu">a.m.</span> At
one period of the year we experienced bright auroræ frequently
about three o'clock in the afternoon. Very little colour was
observed in connection with these auroræ other than the usual
yellowish-green tints, but at some times the luminosity showed
yellower than at others. In some of the most brilliant displays
the curtains were bordered below by a narrow zone of deep crimson
colour. The displays were usually in the form of arches, which
showed minor convolutions and appeared as beautifully draped
curtains. These were sharply defined below but merged insensibly
into the heavens above; their depth appears to have been many
thousands of feet. Besides the curtain auroræ, diffused nebulous
lights were frequently observed, often in connection with clouds.
On still cold evenings a faintly luminous mist enveloped Ross
Island, and this seemed to have some connection with the nebulous
auroræ. In fact, very early in the winter a nebulous type of
aurora was seen on one occasion to descend between us and the
slopes of Erebus, apparently only about five or six thousand feet
in height above us.</p>
<p>When at their greatest brilliancy the displays were powerful
enough to throw shadows but were yet insufficiently strong to
allow of their being photographed. We obtained impressions on
photographic plates after about ten minutes' exposure, but as the
curtains had altered their shape during the interval, the result
was of little value. With regard to the curtain auroræ, when once
outlined in the sky they experienced spasmodic kindling, the
waves of light travelling usually in one definite direction. This
has the effect of producing to the eye the appearance of ripples
of luminescence traversing the curtain at a very rapid rate. The
curtains, as a whole, slowly drift in a determined direction,
generally towards the magnetic pole. The displays, however, were
very seldom observed in that part of the heavens situated towards
the magnetic pole; they usually appeared in the north, through
east to south. The arches sometimes travelled towards us from the
south-east. Observations of electric potential showed nothing
remarkable during displays of the aurora.</p>
<p>I am informed by the Chief of the Telegraph Department of
South Australia that during September 12, 1908, the telegraph
lines, both north and south and east and west across Australia,
were much affected by earth currents. At the same time we
experienced considerable auroral displays. Since then, on May 14
and 15, 1909, the same authority reports further disturbed earth
currents, and it is interesting to note that brilliant auroral
displays were observed in the Southern Indian Ocean by a passing
steamer.</p>

<h3>III.1: A SUMMARY OF RESULTS</h3>
<h4><span class="aa">By Professor</span> T. W. EDGEWORTH DAVID,
B.A., F.R.S.,<br>
<small>AND</small><br>
<span class="aa">Lieutenant</span> ADAMS, R.N.R.,<br>
<span class="aa">Meteorologist to the Expedition</span>,
1907-1909</h4>
<p><b>SYSTEMATIC</b> meteorological observations were kept on the
voyage of the <i>Nimrod</i>, commencing on January 1, 1908, from
Port Lyttelton down to winter quarters at Cape Royds. These
observations were taken hourly. On the return voyage from Ross
Island to Port Lyttelton observations were taken during every
watch. On the return voyage of the <i>Nimrod</i> from Lyttelton
to Ross Island, on her cruises in the Antarctic, and the return
voyage to Lyttelton, meteorological observations were taken at
intervals of four hours.</p>
<p>At winter quarters, Cape Royds, systematic observations were
taken by one of us (Lieutenant Adams) during the day from March
to October 1908, observations at night being taken by whoever
happened at the time to be night watchman. These observations
were two hourly. From October 1908 till February 1909, the
biologist, J. Murray, who had previous experience of
meteorological work, was in charge of the meteorological
observations and records.</p>
<p>Attempts were made to ascertain the amount of annual snowfall
in the Antarctic in the neighbourhood of Ross Island. This task
was, of course, beset with the same difficulty which the
meteorologists of all other Antarctic expeditions experienced,
viz., that of distinguishing between fresh falling snow and old
snow drifted through the air by blizzards. We did our best to
make this discrimination, but the results can only be set down as
empirical and provisional. Our general conclusion is, that at
Cape Royds the snowfall from February 1908 to February 1909 was
equal to about 9½ in. of rain.</p>
<p>Mackintosh, when on the Southern Supporting-party's
expedition, in charge of Joyce, in January 1909, found as the
result of excavations made at the old Depot A of the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition near Minna Bluff, that the snowfall
there for the past six years had been equal to an annual rainfall
of 7½ in.</p>
<p>During the whole time of our residence in the Antarctic, from
February 1908, till this beginning of March 1909, no rain
whatever fell. The snow usually came with a blizzard. These
blizzards blew from a general southerly direction; at Cape Royds
they were mostly from the south-east. It is clear that the snow
brought by the blizzards is in part drift snow, in part new
falling snow. On several occasions we noticed that, whereas in
the earlier part of the blizzard the snow was largely
redistributed old snow in the form of drift, towards the end of a
blizzard fresh new falling snow would be deposited. As, at the
time of the blizzard, the wind was travelling very rapidly from
the south at the rate of perhaps sixty to seventy miles an hour,
we argued that this new falling snow was probably produced by
moisture carried by the upper currents. The temperature of the
atmosphere invariably increased considerably from the beginning
of a blizzard towards its end. This rise was very marked, for
whereas the initial temperature, at the beginning of a blizzard,
would be perhaps minus 30° Fahr., at the end of a blizzard, after
a lapse of possibly twenty-four to thirty hours, the temperature
would have risen to plus 12° or plus 15° Fahr.</p>
<p>This rise in temperature may have been due to causes of which
the more important are: First, the usual föhn effect, the
temperature of the air being raised through compression as the
air descends from higher levels to lower. This compression effect
ought theoretically to make itself strongly felt at the
atmospheric South Polar vortex. Secondly, the latent heat set
free when aqueous vapour in the atmosphere is passing into the
form of snow which, of course, tends to raise the atmospheric
temperature. It might also be suggested that as the atmospheric
circulation during a blizzard is immensely accelerated, probably
the upper winds under these conditions may transfer relatively
warm air from tropical regions polewards. If this be so, it is
quite possible that some of the snow which falls towards the
close of a blizzard was formed out of the moisture generated in
warmer climates.</p>
<p>The Southern Party specially studied the question of whether
much snow fell far south, and the Northern Party, who went to the
South Magnetic Pole, also paid special attention to this point of
whether the snowfall increased in proportion as one receded from
the South Pole. As the result of the observations of the Southern
Party it was clear that within ninety-seven geographical miles of
the South Pole there were still very strong south-south-east
winds, bringing with them a quantity of snow. During the time the
Southern Party were on the plateau no falls of fresh snow were
observed; but there was nothing to suggest that the annual
snowfall was less than at winter quarters.</p>
<p><span class="uu">Temperature</span>.&mdash;The lowest
temperature we experienced was minus 57° Fahr., near White Island
on the Great Ice Barrier, on August 14, 1908. We may refer to Mr.
Murray's notes for a comparison of the temperatures observed by
us and by other Antarctic expeditions.</p>

<p align="center"><small>131. <span class="aa">Cloud Spirals in
Upper Currents of Air near Erebus</span></small></p>
<p><span class="uu">Winds</span>.&mdash;These may be divided into
surface winds and high-level winds.</p>
<p>As regards surface winds, we found in Ross Sea that these were
controlled to a great extent by the presence or absence of ice
over Ross Sea. Once McMurdo Sound and the Ross Sea to the north
of it became firmly frozen over, we found that we enjoyed calmer
weather conditions than we did when the sea was open. Evidently
the presence of a large surface of comparatively warm water at
plus 28° Fahr. acts as a disturbing factor in the local
atmospheric circulation. The surface winds at our winter quarters
were either gentle northerly winds, whose speed seldom exceeded
twelve miles an hour, or gentle winds from the south-south-east
or south-east. If these latter winds become strongly developed
they pass over into a definite blizzard. One of the rarest winds
at Cape Royds was a north-westerly.</p>
<p>On the southern journey it was noted that south-south-east
winds predominated on the surface of the Great Barrier. These
sometimes swing round to between south-south-west and
west-south-west. The Southern Party experienced a violent
south-south-east blizzard at a point just beyond latitude 88°
South. At the furthest point south attained by them, latitude 88°
23', the sastrugi were large and high, and trended from
south-south-east to north-north-west. There was much soft snow on
this part of the plateau at an altitude of over 10,000 ft.</p>
<p>On the journey of the Northern Party to the South Magnetic
Pole it was found that the chief winds on the coast, as well as
on the high plateau, are from south-south-west to west, with
occasional blizzard winds from the south-south-east and
south-east. Both the Northern and Southern Party kept specially
careful records of the direction of the dominant sastrugi. Maps
of these will be published in the Meteorological Memoir. It is
certain that a good deal of the westerly wind experienced by the
Northern Party in their journey along the sea-ice near the coast
was practically a land breeze. It used to spring up soon after
midnight, and keep on blowing pretty freshly until about 10
<span class="uu">a.m.</span> on the following day. It was
observed that occasionally in the neighbourhood of Mount Nansen a
breeze would spring up from the north-east off Ross Sea, carrying
dense cumulus clouds inland.</p>
<p><span class="uu">High-level Atmospheric
Currents</span>.&mdash;On January 14, 1908, Messrs. Leo. Cotton,
Douglas Mawson and T. W. Edgeworth David were able to get some
observations of the direction and rate of movement and height of
the upper wind current, in latitude 69° 53' South, longitude 179°
47' west. We estimated that the mean height of the mackerel sky
which seemed to be formed at the base of the anti-trade wind was
on this occasion between 13,000 and 14,000 ft., and we determined
that the rate of movement of the mackerel clouds was about
twenty-miles per hour in a south-easterly direction. This does
not mean necessarily, of course, that the upper wind was not
moving at a still more rapid rate, but the figure may be looked
upon as the minimum speed for that current.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic132" id="pic132"></a><img alt=""
src="1402771h-images/pic132.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>132. <span class="aa">Dumb-bell Cloud
above Erebus</span></small></p>
<p>At Mount Erebus our winter quarters were situated in an
exceptionally favoured position for observing the upper currents
of the atmosphere. Not only had we the great cone of Erebus to
serve as a graduated scale against which we could read off the
heights of the various air currents as portrayed by the movements
of the clouds belonging to them, but we also had the magnificent
steam column in the mountain itself, which by its swaying from
side to side indicated exactly the direction of movement of the
higher atmosphere. Moreover, during violent eruptions Uke that of
June 14, 1908, the steam column rose to an altitude of over
20,000 ft. above sea-level. Under these circumstances it
penetrated far above the level of a current of air from the pole
northwards, so that its summit came well within the sweep of the
higher wind blowing in a southerly direction, the result being
that the steam-cloud in this region was dragged over powerfully
towards the south-east. On such occasions one usually saw
evidence of two high-level currents, the one coming from a
northerly direction, its under limit being about 15,000 ft. above
sea-level; and the other, or middle current from a southerly
quarter, usually blowing towards the east-north-east, meeting its
upper limit at 15,000 ft. normally while its lower limit was
between 6000 and 7000 ft. above sea-level. While these two
currents were blowing strongly, there would frequently be a
surface current blowing gently from the north. This would bring
up very dense masses of cumulus cloud from off Ross Sea. The
cumulus would drift up to the 6000 or 7000 ft. level on the
north-west slopes of Erebus, and then the tops of the cumulus
would be cut off by the lower edge of the northward flowing
middle current. Wisps of fleecy cloud would be swept along to the
east-north-east torn from the tops of these cumulus clouds by the
middle current. The whole appearance is illustrated in the
accompanying diagram.</p>
<p>It is of especial interest to note the effects of blizzards on
the direction of movement of the high-level currents, as well as
on their altitude. As the result of our ascent of Erebus we
ascertained that the whole of the snowfall lying within the rim
of the second great crater, at an altitude of from 11,500 to over
12,000 ft., is strongly ridged with sastrugi, which trend from
about west-south-west to east-north-east in the direction of the
prevalent middle-air current. The sharp points of these sastrugi
are directed towards the west-south-west, the quarter from which
of course the prevalent wind blows.</p>
<p>Our actual experience of a heavy blizzard, at a level of over
5000 ft. on Erebus, as well as our subsequent observations of the
height to which the blizzard wind extended, showed that during
blizzards the whole atmosphere from sea-level up to at least
11,000 ft. moves, near Cape Royds, from south-east to north-west,
and the speed of movement is from forty up to over sixty miles an
hour. The day that we reached the summit of Erebus, March 10,
1908, we found ourselves at the level of over 13,000 ft. within
the lower limit of the upper wind. Subsequent observations by us
of the point in the steam-cloud over Erebus, where the bend took
place at the junction of the lower limit of this current, with
the top limit of the middle current, showed that after and during
the blizzard the middle-air current, normally blowing from the
west-south-west, is temporarily abolished, being absorbed by the
immense outrushing air stream of the south-east blizzard. We
noticed that usually in winter time, especially when a blizzard
was impending, strong cloud radiants were developed towards the
north-west. These radiants were produced by the apparent
convergence, due to perspective, of long belts of cirro-stratus
clouds; they could be observed swinging round for several hours
from north-west to true north, and even east of north. When this
was the case a blizzard was certain to be impending.
Unfortunately, during a blizzard, the air was generally so thick
with snow that we were unable to see the top of Erebus. At the
end of a blizzard the air current over Erebus became suddenly
reversed, the steam-cloud swinging round from the south to the
north. After a time, following on the conclusion of a blizzard, a
high-level current was seen to be floating the cirrus clouds from
the south-east towards the north-west, and the steam of Erebus
would stream out towards the north-west. We could not account for
this high-level south-easterly current. It looked like a reversal
of the usual upper wind, and it appears to be a fact new to
meteorological science.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D27. <span class="aa">The Curve of
Atmospheric Temperature from<br>
Cape Royds to Summit of Erebus</span></small></p>
<p>As regards the sequence of events during a blizzard, they
would seem to be as follows: First, there would be gentle
northerly winds at Cape Royds for perhaps one or two days;
temperatures would be low, and it would appear as though the air
flowing south was coming to supply the void which otherwise would
be caused by the contraction of the atmosphere near the pole.
Then would follow two or three days of absolute calm, the
temperature meanwhile continually falling. We may suggest
hypothetically this meant that a great mass of air near the pole
was constantly becoming heavier and denser as the result of the
increasing cold. Sooner or later, perhaps a week after the
northerly wind ceased to blow, this heavy mass of cold air would
seem to force a passage for itself equatorwards. It would
commence rushing out as a south-easterly blizzard, and as soon as
this rapid current was started, and even before it had got to the
latitude of Cape Royds, 77° 32' South, an acceleration of the
upper current above it had already set in. This led to the
curving of the upper current into a direction more or less
parallel to meridians as it rushed in to take the place of the
cold wind escaping from the neighbourhood of the pole. The
increased speed of circulation of the upper current increased the
normal föhn effect at the pole, and this, combined with the more
rapid transfer of warm air from the north to the south by the
medium of the upper current, together with the latent heat from
the snow formed combined to raise the polar atmospheric
temperature, and so temporarily, to make that region a region of
relatively low pressure instead of relatively high, that is,
relatively, as compared with the normal atmospheric pressure
there. As soon, however, as this warming of the polar air had
become general conditions for a blizzard wind ceased, and a
period of calm supervened. At the moment of the cessation of the
wind, conceivably, a species of hydraulic ram effect made itself
felt in the suddenly checked anti-trade wind current above, which
led to the stoppage of that great air stream temporarily, and its
resurging back equatorwards, thus producing a curious high-level
current frequently seen by us after a blizzard in the
neighbourhood of Erebus.</p>
<p>To return from this theoretical digression to observed facts,
an occasional precursor of the cessation of a blizzard was the
veering of the wind from south-east through east-south-east to
east.</p>
<p>That these blizzard winds occasionally blow right across the
Antarctic Circle, and reach the shores of Australasia, is
indicated by the experience of the <i>Nimrod</i>. When she left
Cape Royds on February 23, 1908, she left us in a light
south-easterly wind, the survival of a previous blizzard, and the
following four days it was still blowing a blizzard. Then, after
a partial cessation of the wind for two days more, the blizzard
freshened again on March 1, continuing to blow on March 2. The
<i>Nimrod</i> experienced these south-easterly winds all the way
back, from Cape Royds to Port Lyttelton in New Zealand, arriving
at the latter port within twelve and a half days after she left
Cape Royds.</p>

<p>It is, of course, premature as yet to generalise on the result
of these observations. It is hoped that when the Meteorological
Memoir is completed that the observations, especially on the
movements of the higher atmosphere, will contribute to our
knowledge of meteorological conditions and the laws which control
them in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<h3>NOTE ON THE EXPLORATION PARTY *]</h3>
<p class="foot">[* This appendix is extracted from Chapter II of
Volume. I ("The Staff") of "Heart of the Antarctic."]</p>
<p>. . . . After the expedition had reached New Zealand and the
generous assistance of the Australian and New Zealand Governments
had relieved me from some financial anxiety, I was able to add to
the strength of the staff. I engaged Douglas Mawson, lecturer of
mineralogy and petrology at the Adelaide University, as
physicist, and Bertram Armytage as a member of the expedition for
general work. Professor Edgeworth David, F.R.S., of Sydney
University, consented to accompany us as far as the winter
quarters, with the idea of returning in the <i>Nimrod</i>, but I
persuaded him eventually to stay in the Antarctic, and his
assistance in connection with the scientific work, and
particularly the geology, was invaluable. Leo Cotton, a young
Australian, arranged to come south with us and help with the
preliminary work before the <i>Nimrod</i> returned to New
Zealand, and at the last moment George Buckley, residing in New
Zealand, accompanied us on the voyage south, returning in the
steamer that towed the <i>Nimrod</i>. . . .</p>
