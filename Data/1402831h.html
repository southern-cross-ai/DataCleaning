<h2><a name="ch00" id="ch00"></a>FOREWORD&mdash;THE BECKONING
TRACK: A LITTLE ANTHOLOGY OF AUSTRALIAN LANDSCAPE</h2>

<p class="pin30">"The way's one and the end's one,<br>
and it's far to the ends of the Earth."</p>

<p>Every man to his taste! If I could fall in with a jolly young
god in creative mood, just about to open a branch of the Paternal
business, what a world we could make for walkers! He would seat me
on Kosciusko and give me vision, and I would select the purple
patches from our Australian landscape which he would bring together
as a mechanic assembles the parts of a machine. It might be only a
baby world which would result, but how choice a child!</p>

<p>Seas there would be, of course; enough ocean to give colour and
movement, changing blues and greens and purples and flashes of
foaming white, which contrast and combine so finely with the
skyline when seen from a long curved strip of cool grey sand.
Always and ever must a lady swell lift the live water into waves of
jade or ultramarine. With what irresistible might they advance; how
tremendous is the thunder of their ruin! From the crash and roar a
fury of hissing bubbles runs to your feet, and slides back smoothly
as the next comber curls over in mile-long confusion.</p>

<p>Mountains, too, there must be, and lesser hills by the score,
each distinguished in its appropriate way, a river or two, many
creeks, creeping shyly through a tangle of green or racing like
children down steep places, at least one lake, and a little
snow-plain that is hidden high on a peak in Victoria.</p>

<p>How hard it is to choose as the moving pictures of memory show
on the mental screen. One sage has said, "It is all good when
you're out in it." Even the "perishes" he has done seem pleasant to
the walker in retrospect. I find myself handing to the god for
inclusion that long stretch of soft sand from Cape Everard to the
mouth of the Snowy River, remembering only the joy of conquest and
not the salt rivers, the thirst, the shrieking angry gale, the
flying sand, the weight of the swag. "You never know what pleasure
is until you've tasted woe!" The tiny spring that joins the sea</p>

<p class="pin10">...where the lobster spawns<br>
In cool Cape Conran's weed,"</p>

<p>most obviously had been spilt by Hebe as she served her nectar
to the immortals, and the parched and weary swagmen made suitable
oblation.</p>

<p>Of the choice things of heaven and earth the first to be taken
must be the view from Sublime Point, above the Bulli Pass. Keep the
top road, only interesting because of its flora, turn down the
narrow forest way with no hint of the wonder to come, and as that
panorama of perfection takes your sight you will want to remove
your shoes, as one standing on holy ground, or to disrobe like the
worshipper in Klinger's To the Beautiful in Nature. No detail may
be omitted: the sheer rocky drop to the tropical jungle, the massed
growths of palm and fig and turpentine tree and supple-jack and the
rest, the dolls' houses that form the settlements, curving sands
and jutting headlands, and, holding all together, the restless blue
of the sea, cunningly relieved by its snowy edging of surf.</p>

<p>A few national parks may be added. New South Wales shall yield
the pattern of her delicious combination of wild woodland and
well-ordered ways, Victoria, the greater part of her secluded
sanctuary known as Wilson's Promontory. Particularly would I rape
the Promontory of its Oberon Bay, where assuredly the sponsor
watched fairy revels in the moonlight, of its forest of banksias at
South West Corner, of that cheeriest of torrents, Roaring Meg, and,
above all, of the proud, stern rock which holds aloft the
lighthouse and vainly seeks to glimpse again its lost Tasmania.</p>

<p>I have said there must be mountains, and mountains there shall
be. Kosciusko because he dominates all; Sydney's Blue Mountains
because there is nothing else like them; the mighty Bogong standing
savagely aloof from all others; Wellington the benign guardian of
Hobart; Cobbler the Hunchback, for the outlook his strange
semi-detached peak affords and the frantic waterfall which issues
from his worn sides; that range of fantasy, the Grampians of
Victoria, made up, it would seem, of the frames of monsters who
lived in the nightmare days before the Flood and from whose
decomposition has sprung a unique flora; the Buffalo because it is
the Buffalo. They compel admiration, these giants, without caring
whether that crawling insect, Man, regards them or not. It is the
smaller hills who are friendly&mdash;</p>

<p class="pin10">The high hills are haughty,<br>
They stand against the blue<br>
An count themselves a cut above<br>
The likes of me and you.<br>
But the little hills lean down to us<br>
And pass the time o' day,<br>
An tell the gossip of the tracks<br>
And give their views away.</p>

<p>There is Mount Lofty, for instance, and its range of sister
hills at the back of Adelaide, full of an intimate, pleasant charm,
with no disturbing grandeur. Even the railway which has climbed up
from the Murray level shall be included&mdash;this in gratitude for
those morning peeps down terraced slopes to deep valleys and the
sea beyond which the Melbourne express connives at. And Arthur's
Seat must not be missed, if only for the charm of its Wonga
Paddock, any more than its humbler neighbour, Mount Martha. Both
have missions to fulfil: no one who has climbed their slopes will
ever again malign Port Phillip Bay.</p>

<p>Port Phillip Bay!&mdash;yes, it is down for reproduction no less
than Port Jackson, the harbour of Auckland, and those attractive
waters which wash the feet of Wellington at Hobart. To one the
charm of wide expanses lifted like a shield, edged with
indescribable tones of pink and green, to another the glory of a
mountain background, to a third the surprises of winding channels
searching into a rocky coast, a never-closing feast of detail.
Ecclesiastes has noted that "all the rivers run into the sea, yet
the sea is not full." I would have those river mouths, whether
sweet to the very high-water mark, or losing themselves in the salt
long before, or sheltered behind bars of sand which only now and
then they get strength to break. Seldom is a river's final stage,
that point at which it "runs somewhere safe to sea," without
interest. That the walker may have to devise ways and means to get
across these mouths but adds interest to a journey. And good as
they may be in exit, all rivers should improve as one tramps nearer
to their source until it stands revealed in a nook of the ranges. A
river or two, did I say? I could name a score whose claims may not
be denied. Water is the Great Essential of the swagman: let them
all go in.</p>

<p>But it is creeks, baby rivers, that intrigue me most. Little
Dinner Creek in Croajingolong, tiniest and most grateful of running
streams; numberless Stockyard and Stony and Sandy Creeks, even a
Dry Creek, libellously so-called,&mdash;I would miss none. Some for
their names, if for no other virtue, shall sing through the scheme
as a scarlet thread shines in a green fabric. Araluen, full of soft
lights and tender tones; the Dandongadale, like a peal of bells;
and how many more that chime in the chambers of the mind. The
wooded ranges with their towering timber and alluring pads that
glance back invitingly as they vanish into the green shade, the
fern and musk and beech gullies which nurse the springs of these
creeks, the fish and all creatures which use the
waters&mdash;nothing must be lost.</p>

<p>The greater lakes I would class with caves; they do not hold me.
A lake, like a jewel, requires a setting. That is what makes the
charm of Tarli Karngo Nigothuruk, the hidden tarn of Mount
Wellington in Gippsland. Climb 5,000 feet and you stand on the edge
of the basin, slip down 2,000 feet on the inside and you reach the
margin of the waters. Solitude abides there; it is the home of
ancient Peace. Swim in its quiet depths and you shall feel the
Bunyip stir beneath you; sleep on its tiny beach and all the fairy
tales of your youth become true. Not that lake only, but that lake
certainly, shall be part of my new world.</p>

<p>But so much has been missed. Well, that can be made good.
Eternity knows no haste, and the time of a god is eternity. Rest
assured that all shall be as the walker would have it. There shall
be wood and water and the wherewithal to fill the body with
strength and the soul with content. And night shall come and the
underleaves of the gums shall light up in the glow of the
camp-fire; and stars shall be hung in the tops, and a cricket shall
call and a mopoke moan as you snuggle your tired limbs into your
bed of leaves. What more would you have?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>EASTWARD! (1911)</h2>

<p class="pin30">"The Swag and the Billy again&mdash;<br>
Here's how!"<br>
<br>
&mdash;Kipling.</p>

<p>"One thing," remarked the surveyor, "you'll get plenty of
crayfish at Cape Conran." He mouthed Brady's lines:</p>

<p class="pin10">"Come south'ard where the lobster spawns<br>
In cool Cape Conran's weed."</p>

<p>"You can pull them out with your hands," he declared.</p>

<p>None of us had heard of Conran till he pointed on the map to
where its blunt projection breaks the sweep of the Ninety Mile
Beach extension. It was Cape Everard we were after, the Everard
that was Captain Cook's "Point Hicks" up to the time when a
generation that cared nothing for tradition renamed it in honour of
some local celebrity. A lighthouse stands guard there now, the last
before you come to Cape Howe and turn the corner for Sydney. An
ex-keeper of that light had extolled the charms of the spot, its
isolation and its beauty, until we were keen to pay it a visit. He
knew no better place anywhere. "Push a quarter of a mile inland and
you'd swear you were the first man to get there. It's the loneliest
shore light on the Victorian coast. Ships keep too far out for
signals, and it's nearly a hundred miles to the nearest telegraph
wire. If a wreck happened we'd have had to ride the old horse
thirty miles to the Cann River and another fifty to Orbost before
Melbourne could know. Yes, it was quiet all right!...If you want to
see animals in their native state, take a walk there. Dingoes? Any
number!...And snakes," he added, thoughtfully, "the place is
crawling with them!"</p>

<p>Snakes are no particular draw, but the rest was attractive. So
we sought the surveyor. He knew exactly how to go and how to
return, as did an astonishing number of other people, we
discovered. Eventually we found ourselves setting out from
Cunninghame one evening on foot, each with a sleeping bag and a
load of food, and the leader armed with a map marked by the
surveyor with such useful directions as "water here," "tucker
here," and "turn-off to the palms." It was "a wonderful clear night
of stars," but under the tall green timber the darkness lay so
dense upon the land that the road became a thing of touch only and
not of sight. Bungah Creek, spreading across the track, brought a
halt till the abbreviated footbridge, both ends overlapped by the
waters, was reached by wading and left by the same means. Then from
a rise we looked suddenly on to stars beneath us&mdash;we had
reached Lake Tyers and it was midnight.</p>

<p>Sand makes a bed that induces sound sleep even though the
resident fox come and blow in your ear to find out if you are as
dead as you look. He chose the botanist for his experiment and
there is no evidence that the scared beast is not still
running.</p>

<p>Orbost and its Snowy River flats, wealthy with pigs and maize,
were the reward of the next day's march along the forest
road&mdash;Orbost on Christmas eve, alive with people filling
stockings in the name of Santa Claus. They're a kindly folk in this
capital of the east. We learnt a new way to "the palms," and
gathered much that was fresh concerning our route. "Don't miss Cape
Conran on your way back," was insisted on. "That is, if you care
for crayfish." The Cape, it appeared, is Orbost's picnic spot, a
land of all delights where even oysters grow, and crayfish are the
commonplace. "One party brought home twenty dozen last Christmas,"
we heard. Carrying a roast leg of mutton (described in retrospect
as "large as veal and tender as lamb ") and many other appropriate
gifts and purchases, we made for some good trees out of the
township, dug hip-holes in the tough soil, and soon slept the sleep
of the tired. Presently a bird began to sing, and then another.
That was how the botanist described it to the scared camp, but
there was some difference of opinion. To most of the listeners the
sounds suggested a musical evening in the final summer resort of
the wicked. Mr. Donald Macdonald has published many notes from bush
folk inquiring the origin of these very noises, and he has sheeted
the offence home to Ninox Strenua&mdash;the Eagle Owl. The
terrifying duet came from directly overhead&mdash;harsh grating
groans that seemed to tear the soul in their passage, shrieks of
torture, screams of deadly fear, moans as of a passing spirit. With
the sun shining, some of that may be discounted, but as truth lies
not in exactitude of detail so much as in correctness of
impression, it will serve. One of the more widely travelled of the
party made it clear that the song of Ninox Strenua could not
possibly be mistaken for that of the nightingale.</p>

<p>Gippsland ends at Orbost, despite the geographies. Thereafter,
eastward, it is Croajingolong, familiarly shortened to 'Jingolong
(the first 'g' as in bring). The only palms that grow "wild" in
Victoria are in 'Jingolong, and they are all in one patch on
Cabbage Tree Creek. They are the Illawarra or Cabbage Tree Palm so
common over the border. Patriotic Victorians have been known to
speculate as to how so many specimens could have reached New South
Wales. Scientists (with less parochial leanings) confess themselves
puzzled to account for this Victorian community, completely
isolated as it is from all its relatives. That brave old botanist,
Baron von Mueller, who was better entitled to the name of explorer
than many of the more widely advertised claimants to the title,
made two trips to Cabbage Tree Creek as far back as 1854. Blacks
drove him out the first time, but he was back twelve months later.
When we reached the spot, as a side excursion of six miles, no
natives could have been visible even if they had still held
possession, for after a wrong turning and adventures with a swamp,
we arrived in the velvet gloom of a cloudy night. Nothing was
distinguishable; it was as pitchy dark as the Chaos of Hans Sachs,
where even the cats ran against each other. Morning showed a
tropical tangle on the banks of a blackfish creek, out of which
rose the graceful stems of the palms with their feathery tops.
Several looked about one hundred feet high. They stand in what is
now a Government reserve, and are guarded by a tribe of the most
pointed mosquitoes in the State.</p>

<p>Bush hotels have an unenviable reputation. Half a day beyond the
Cabbage Tree a little hostelry gives the lie to the general belief.
Its very name is attractive "The Bell Bird," and as it nestled in a
curve of the road with for background the mass of vegetation that
hides the creek, it looked what it was: the comfortable house of
kindly people. Oddly, this was one of the few creeks where there
was no sound of the bell-bird, that charming olive-green creature
whose prosaic and sole occupation appeared to be the picking of a
white scale off the gum leaves, with pauses for the utterance of
the single note, "tink!" which is his contribution to the family
chorus. We soon learnt that one might find water without a
bell-bird, but never a bell-bird without water.</p>

<p>The great enveloping forests of hardwood are relieved at every
creek by growths of Lilli Pilli and Kanooka, and some glorious
trees of the Victorian Waratah, twenty feet high, flourish at the
Bell Bird. Who shall say that the scientist is not also, at times,
poet? Who ever named the Waratah Telopea ("seen afar off") and
added Oreades to distinguish the Victorian variety, was no
dry-as-dust. Milton's nymphs of the mountains, the Oreads, are
fittingly associated with these lovely shrubs. Almost as beautiful
as the gleaming red of the waratah blooms were here the young
leaves of the gums. "Silver-top" the settlers call the prevailing
rough-barked eucalypt; aptly, for its higher branches show white
and clean. Whole hillsides burned with the glory of its leafage as
with "woodland altar flames." 'Jingolong's one highway cuts through
the green growth; little else has been done by man to destroy
Nature's work. Only an occasional clearing was seen before the Bemm
River crossed the track.</p>

<p>Not so many years ago one of the rare settlers then beyond the
Bemm River met with an accident. The few neighbours started out
with him for Bairnsdale&mdash;a ninety mile ride. The Bemm barred
the way, dark and forbidding, and at that time deep. Such an
obstacle might have turned townsmen, but not the resourceful bush
folk. Giant trees tower above the stream, one of these was felled
to reach the opposite bank, adzed flat for foothold, and the
helpless man was safely carried across. The makeshift still stands,
near the site of the bridge that now conducts the main Genoa Road
over the stream. This is a new well-graded track that cost many
thousands of pounds. The pity is there are not more cleared ways
for the men and women who, lionhearted, are hewing a living out of
the wilderness.</p>

<p>Further down the Bemm is a ford, mostly usable. It was a bitter
winter morning when one of the keepers from Everard had his first
experience of crossing here. He had spent the night at a house near
by, but had made no inquiries regarding the river. All the others
he had had to swim: this he took for granted. The white frost
crackled underfoot as he rode to the bank. Black and threatening
ran the water and it was only by noting the tracks that he could be
sure of the crossing place. Shivering, he stripped to the buff,
remounted, and drove the horse in. "It pains a man at times to miss
his pain" so the poet sings; the rider's emotions were badly mixed
when he found the water nowhere more than a couple of feet deep!
And as he dressed in haste he was aware of the joy of his host of
the night before, who had witnessed the sight from afar.</p>

<p>Our camp was pitched in a snaky clearing of the sword-grass.
Overhead the solemn eucalypts swayed together whispering and
watching, and a lovelorn boobook, lured by the botanist, moaned us
to sleep.</p>

<p>"Croajingolong" is synonymous with "forest." Nowhere was the
great procession of the trees better than at this point. After a
week of bush walking one felt he was a spectator at an unending
march of giants holding aloft green banners. How many kinds of
timbers were present only the botanist knew, but all were aware
that at the Cann River another was added to the list in the blue
gum (globulus).</p>

<p>While the Bemm is a morose-looking stream, sullen and dark, its
neighbour the Cann, sixteen miles away, is sandy-bottomed and
bright. But the Cann can be as cruel as the Bemm looks. Floods made
the rich flats that now produce the golden crops of maize, and a
river, like a man, is hard to break of old habits. In the winter
the whole country is often awash. The lighthouse keeper on one
occasion had a horse drowned as he rode for the mail. When the
waters went down the carcass was found high and dry on a tree, and
the man had a stiff climb to recover his mackintosh still on the
animal's neck.</p>

<p>The character of the country changes as the main road is left at
the Cann for the track that turns off for Everard. It twists
through the gums and banksias, gradually getting fainter until
sharp eyes are required to follow it. Reedy Creek is five miles
out, and, at nine miles, dainty little Dinner Creek intersects the
way. Surely there is no smaller creek in active operation! Two feet
wide by as many deep, it is crossed in a stride and might easily be
passed unnoticed. But its tiny bed was full of sweet, cool,
sparkling water&mdash;particularly welcome on that hot day, and
gratefully remembered as the best water of a journey on which water
was often the scarcest of essentials. It was the last, too, before
the lighthouse, a sweltering stretch of twenty miles to, and along,
the beach. Grass-tree flats, swamps, wooded hillocks, and a steady
increase in the number of coastal growths marked the approach to
the ocean. A final climb over steep hummocks showed a sea as empty
as the sky, a desolate beach relieved only by a huge dead seal,
and, seven miles away, the top of the lighthouse tower.</p>

<p>Cape Everard would hardly be dignified by a name elsewhere than
on that great stretch of sand that edges smoothly almost the whole
of the eastern coast from Port Albert to Mallacoota. It is imposing
only on the principle that amongst the blind the one-eyed is king.
The light stands well above the triangle of reef on which the
Southern Ocean beats unceasingly. Towards the sunrise lies an
endless line of baylets broken by low headlands, amongst them the
"remarkable point" mentioned in Cook's Journal of April 19th, 1770,
"which rises to a round hillock very much like the Ramhead going
into Plymouth Sound, on which account I called it by the same
name." Westward the sandy beaches extend for long miles without
interruption. Stone quarters shelter the lightkeepers and their
households&mdash;three families in all&mdash;and stone walls keep
back the greedy sand that is ever on the move where the native
shrubs and grasses have been destroyed. The hummocks further back
are crowned with growths of pittosporum and banksia, the latter a
carnival of "blue mountain" lorikeets in the flowering time. Some
nice soil, enriched by goat droppings, and kept moist by a spring,
maintains a vegetable garden that is amazingly prolific. Two
hundred goats leave the near-by enclosure each morning to wander
miles in search of choice feeding, making tiny pads through the
scrub, dinting the beaches with their sharp hooves, and returning
at night to the protection of the fold. They mean milk, butter,
fresh meat, mats, and numberless other things to their owners.</p>

<p>It is truly a lonely place. The nearest settlement is thirty
miles away; only twice a year does the Government steamer look in
with provisions. Snakes crawl out of the undergrowth, warm
themselves on the walls, and drink at the drip of the pump. Dingoes
wail in the bush or prowl on the beach for ancient fish and other
toothsome morsels. Yet the station is popular with the staff. The
traffic passes afar off, wrecks are unlikely, officialdom, in the
absence of a wire, cannot worry often, and living is cheap and
good. As at all far-out lights and remote places, a stranger is
given the welcome of a prodigal son. The fatted kid is killed, and
everything done to make him sorry to leave.</p>

<p>This was our turning point. Five miles further are "the two
rivers" (the Thurra and the Mueller) to which a flying visit was
paid. They deserve an article to themselves. We saw the New Year in
with our kindly hosts to the jangle of kerosene tins and cowbells
strung from the lighthouse tower, and six hours later the level sun
was projecting our shadows before us as we headed westward on the
return journey.</p>

<p>As a foil to the shadowed week in the forest it was to be a
beach walk all the way back, a scheme which looked not only
possible but easy. There appeared to be no particular obstacles,
and the vital question of water seemed answered by the fairly
frequent creeks that are marked on the map. Here let it be said,
however, that this is one of the worst beaches on the Victorian
coast for the walker. The sand is soft and breaks at every step,
and there is hardly a level piece in a hundred miles. For a few
miles the angle is not uncomfortable, but a day's march leaves the
feeling that one leg is longer than the other. It is a dangerous
looking beach; the sea makes fierce snatching rushes up and down
its slopes; instead of a comfort the rivers are a menace. If they
are running into the sea, they may be uncrossable, and if they are
bar-bound, they are salt. In that event fresh water must be hunted
for, and sometimes carried a whole day.</p>

<p>A head wind sprang up early on that first of January. It rose
rapidly to a gale and then to a hurricane which never slackened for
twenty-four hours. At face level the air was full of the stinging
particles or fine sand which form the surface of the beach; our
legs took the ceaseless fusillade of the heavier grains. Under this
sandblast the blackened billies renewed their youth and by
afternoon shone as new. The living weight of the wind, the want of
water, the shelving beach, and, worst of all, the breaking sand,
made the day's journey a sixteen miles to remember. Tamboon Inlet,
the first of the rivers, came as a relief halfway with its shelter
from the wind, but there was no fresh water and a long return trip
had to be made to the last spring noticed. Bar-bound, it formed a
fine lake and there was abundance of fish. The river-mouths
generally were very attractive to an angler and their seclusion
should keep them so for many years.</p>

<p>Towards sunset three men suddenly appeared on the skyline. They
were at the edge of Sydenham Inlet, the largest of the Lakes that
pit this coast. With its system of marshes it covers an area of
about twelve miles by six. It is the home of wild fowl. Ducks,
swans, pelicans cormorants and other expert swimmers, cover the
waters, and the shallows are alive with waders. The fishing is
particularly good. Commanding all is Morgan's comfortable little
hotel, on the north bank, near where the Bemm River enters, for
this is where the Bemm reaches the sea. The strangers were from
Morgan's. They had a yacht on the lake and were waiting for the
wind to drop. Billies were filled from the freshwater spring hidden
in the hummocks and soon a fire roared in a sheltered hollow and
camp was made. From their sleeping bags the walkers admired the
philosophic bushmen, who, having no blankets or other night gear,
threw together a screen of branches, and lay contented between it
and the blaze. Long before daylight it was "all aboard" and the
boat was jumping as she headed up the channel.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours at Sydenham, the final kindness from the
Morgans of a ferry across to the west shore of the lake, and a tiny
cattle-pad was found that wandered in the right direction through a
scrub that was often tea-tree, often banksia, and sometimes
pittosporum and gums. Little flocks of the funereal cockatoo made
the way noisy. It led to Stockyard Creek, fifty yards long from its
source behind the hummocks to its point of disappearance in the
sand, an oasis fringed with trees and alive with tits and
honeyeaters. Then over the sand-ridge to find the slaty nose of
Pearl Point in view and three dingoes coming full-trot down the
wind. A sturdy dog led, followed by a half-starved wife and a
three-quarter-grown pup. At sixty yards the leader saw us,
stiffened for a second, and was in full flight the next. There were
oysters on the Point and indications of crayfish that whetted the
appetite for Cape Conran, now only a few miles away. Dock Inlet,
another of the sea-creeks that hide in the coastal sand, was three
miles on, and in four more the high bank of Yerung Creek showed. A
lovely sheet of water, to whose placid bosom was given the final
touch of peace by the presence of a swan and her cygnet, floating
"double, swan and shadow."</p>

<p>Again fresh water was lacking and it was a dry party which set
out next morning for Conran, now only four miles away. In addition
to crayfish, Cape Conran has a reputation for "plenty of good
water." We had pictured a cape with a definite headland and were
dismayed to find a sea-front of some two miles of wave-worn
granite. One of the tiny springs was at last located and a mid-day
breakfast prepared and enjoyed. Then it was hey, for the crayfish!
There was a cheer as the leader produced a carefully treasured
bottle of vinegar from his swag. "Here's a claw!" said somebody,
and all hands scattered to the pleasant task of getting the
lobsters. We spent the day at Conran and the result is best summed
up in the words of the doctor of science: "It's a splendid place
<i>for</i> crayfish; what a pity there's none there!"</p>

<p>Maybe the recent camps, of which there was abundant evidence,
accounted for the shortage. Certain it is that every artifice
failed to raise a "cray."</p>

<p>It is grass-tree country in to Marlo, a township that must
easily hold the Australian record for density of mosquito
population. The Snowy is here a wide and handsome river but it,
too, often suffers from the common Gippsland ailment of a bar.
Still was the sand difficult to walk on, so difficult under a hot
sun that the sliding hummocks were climbed and a track found on the
land side. Separated from the sea by just the width of the hummocks
run the twenty miles of Ewing's Marsh, skirted by clumps of
tea-tree and eucalypts. It is at present a pasture for cattle in
its drier parts, but surely someday to be drained and dotted with
farms. The day was close and drowsy and fresh water hard to find,
but the edge of the marsh was firm turf and, stimulated by threat
of storm, the party swung along at four miles an hour. Night came
and the rain fell in torrents. The road turned to a creek. The swag
under the all-enveloping rubber sheeting, gave each walker a
ludicrous resemblance to an organ grinder. "Da monk'" was the only
essential missing.</p>

<p>Ahead lay Lake Tyers and the completion of our circuit of some
two hundred and fifty miles. Civilization was close at hand: happy
thought, we would seek a lodging for that evening. Everyone warmed
to the idea. The outdoor life had been enjoyed to the
full&mdash;the "bed in the bush with stars to see," the camp by
running creek or restless ocean, the freedom from the
conventional&mdash;but indoors had its charm on such a night.
"Civilized" baths and meals and beds suddenly appealed to all. "A
good hot dinner with vegetables" soliloquized someone in
pleasurable anticipation. "And a decent pudding!" added another.
"What price a pillow!" came joyfully from a walker who had never
taken kindly to rock substitutes. A light shone wetly from a window
and was reflected in the dancing pools of the roadway. A dog
stormed from a kennel. We stamped on to a verandah, full of
pleasing expectation. A lady appeared with a lamp. "Good evening,"
we chorused genially. She looked at us critically and her eye was
cold. "We don't serve liquor here!" she remarked, and closed the
door again.</p>

<p>Then was it borne home to seven city men that not a University
degree, a legal practice, a house in "the lane," nor a post in the
Civil Service, is proof against sixteen days of "back to Nature."
They realized that they were unshaven, down at heel, travel-stained
and tattered; the mark of the tramp was upon them, and they were
judged accordingly. It was the price of liberty, and not one of
them grudged the payment for such a glorious feast.</p>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>BEDS IN THE BUSH</h2>

<p class="pin30">"Bed in the bush with stars to see."<br>
<br>
&mdash;R.L.S.</p>

<p>A bed in the tree-tops sounds absurd, outside of Peter Pan. And
even Barrie's genius cannot carry it off to grown-ups; they
tolerate it with a smile as a pretty fancy and evade the sharp
questions of youth. But I for one have known it, and it was in no
Land of Make Believe, but in this sober State of Victoria.</p>

<p>He who travels much with the swag knows strange beds. And as the
specialist greatly develops by use the particular sense he most
requires, so the swagman gains the camp eye. With the day drawing
to a close he is constantly on the watch for the suitable
sleeping-place, so constantly that the effort becomes
sub-conscious. Water is the first essential of a camp; given that,
he looks for a few feet of level for his blankets or sleeping-bag,
and a bit of shelter if weather threatens. On this evening we had
come across an old well in the tea-trees which bordered the long
beach, and we had filled the billies in passing. Sand hummocks rose
high on our left with every now and then a gully opening through as
though a creek had once run there to the sea.</p>

<p>Up one of these we tried. Its sides were soft drift, of the kind
that feels so comfortable in the hand, and becomes so hard when you
sleep on it. We knew it well, and admired it not at all. Moreover,
the angle was too great; by morning we should have been feet lower
than where we started. On the crest of the rise was too breezy, at
the bottom was a certain dampness. Then came the vision. Half-way
up were the broad, leafy heads of a group of tea-trees, buried to
their necks in the shifty hummock. No trunks appeared, only some
three feet of the topmost branches. It was easy to step off the
higher slopes of the sand on to these natural mattresses, so
tightly packed as to be almost solid, and there, under a wonderful
sky of stars, we spread our beds and slept more softly than on any
couch the bush had yielded to that date or has yielded since.</p>

<p>Not that the swagman is, in modern parlance, "fussy" as a
general thing about where he sleeps. I speak of the amateur
swagman, of course. The fresh air of the open, the relaxing muscles
after a long day's tramp, the soothing murmur of a near-by
creek&mdash;these induce sleep, however hard the bones of Mother
Earth may be beneath him. But he grows cunning with experience, and
it is not long before he sleeps, because, maybe, of those other
things, but also because he is comfortable. He learns the value of
the judicious hip-hole and how to line it to advantage; he finds
that ten minutes' cutting of bracken will yield a more satisfactory
return than the most elaborate bed of such trash as dogwood. He
will learn, too, that gum-tops spell peace and sweet slumbers,
while the wattles generally are better left to decorate the spring.
On the coast the elastic scrub known as cushion-bush will be always
chosen after one experience. With cushion-bush beneath him, a low
break-wind on the right quarter, a clear night and a singing sea,
the swag-man, like Emerson, "envies not the luxury of kings."</p>

<p>Untoward happenings occur at times, as when a dingo (or a fox,
it was hard to tell which by the tracks he left), put an
inquisitive nose into the hood of a sleeping-bag while the owner
slept the sleep of the first night out, on the delta of a Gippsland
river. But that was unusual, and the number of night disturbances,
other than those occasioned by such small deer as mosquitoes or
fleas, suffered in the camps incidental to over z,000 miles of
tramping in Victoria during the past fifteen years, could be
counted on the fingers of one hand. Snakes are a bogey, and, just
like bogies, they are rarely seen. More rarely still is a reptile
met with at night. Only one really effective snake scare have I had
after dark. It was near the Bringenbrong Bridge, on the Murray, and
as we sat round the camp-fire under the drooping willows a frog
shrieked near by in an unusual and tragic sort of way. "Snake!"
said Charlie, the guide, and the talk at once turned to that topic,
which has been popular with mankind ever since the expulsion from
Eden. Each story was more "creepy" than the last. Then we went to
our beds, spread out on the high bank above the water. How long
afterwards it was no one knows, but two horrific yells, the yell of
genuine fright, came out of the darkness, "A snake! A snake!" and
as one man the camp sat up and demanded matches. Through the babel
rose a sudden sound of beating; a cautious camper was whacking the
ground all round him with a fern frond. "Hullo, here's a frog!"
called another, and the original disturber of the peace began to
realize what had really happened. He had been lying in the warm
night with his chest bare, and a wandering frog had leaped plump on
to his naked throat. A frog is a cold and clammy thing; the snake
stories had done the rest.</p>

<p>Only when you lie on unyielding substances do you realize what
an awkward shape man possesses. To repose on your side with any
ease means that two outstanding protuberances, the shoulder and the
hip, must be conciliated. A high pillow (usually a log or a stone
covered with some article of clothing) will ease the strain on the
shoulder, and a small hole to fit the hip will keep the other from
troubling. But on the floor of a lighthouse where once I slept, or
on rocky surfaces, the hiphole is impossible. The veteran will then
lie on his back, but even he will feel the pressure on his bony
frame. It is recorded of a party of lads that they camped in an old
hut for two nights to escape some rough weather. The floor was of
boards, which had been put down when green. Their edges had turned
up, and proved sharp enough to mark the youngsters' bodies through
their thin blankets. It was hard to find ease in any position. "The
first night," said the chronicler, "we lay north and south, the
second we tried east and west, the third day we played draughts on
one another!"</p>

<p>Two nights out of doors I recall because of their bitter cold.
They were clear and almost windless. One was spent on the beach at
Dromana, the other on the flat crest of Mount Howitt's 5,700 feet.
Each was at Christmas-time, and in both cases the usually
comfortable enough swag was found ridiculously inadequate. Of the
two, the seaside cold was the more searching, mainly because it had
not been properly provided against. On Howitt we knew no liberties
could be taken, so boughs of that poorly foliaged tree the
snow-gum, the only growth available at that height, were put under
and over the sleeping-bag, and a waterproof sheet covered all. In
the morning a layer of ice made the sheet look like glass, and just
like glass it crackled and broke as it was lifted. A night on
Freeze-out, near Mount St. Bernard, was also rather more than
"fresh." It suggested indeed that Freeze-out was well named. But
for sheer discomfort, however, a recent camp on Kosciusko must take
the palm. Rain, fog, wind, and a sodden scrub were bad enough, but
we were also above the timber line, with all that that implies in
the way of temperature, and not a stick could be had that would
hold up a shelter. Wet all night, with an outlook limited by the
mists to a few yards even in the daylight, can it be wondered that
we gave three hearty cheers for the sun when he struggled through
next morning. Camp Misery, we named that unhallowed spot.</p>

<p>Against those failures (not really failures, any of them, in
retrospect, whatever they seemed at the time) stands the record of
numberless golden nights in which it was good to be alive, in which
nothing could go wrong, and one felt that civilization is a
stupidity and man a degenerate since those days</p>

<p class="pin10">"When wild in woods the noble savage ran."</p>

<p>We lean too much towards softness and the stale air of bedrooms.
A glowing camp-fire in the open, a bed of bracken, stars tangled in
the tops of the tall green timber that towers above you, a mopoke
far enough away for his melancholy vespers to be wholly soothing, a
mate close by sucking his pipe, and saying just those things that
fit such a time and place, the happy crooning of a creek in the
ferns at the foot of the rise&mdash;what better things are there in
life? If these cannot content you, you must keep to the cities: the
bush is not for you.</p>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>TO THE BOGONG HIGH PLAINS</h2>

<h3>(a) THE FAINTER TRACK (1915)</h3>

<p class="pin30">"And higher yet and higher<br>
I want to climb, until<br>
The trees give place to bushes<br>
Wind-shorn, and struggling still<br>
For foot-hold on the corrie<br>
Steep-sloping to the sky;<br>
I want to reach the summit<br>
And watch the clouds race by."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Dorothea Mackellar.</p>

<p>Climb a mountain, and you naturally expect to arrive at a
definite point or ridge. Climb the Victorian Alps, and as likely as
not you find yourself on a plain, and a plain of no mean acreage.
The newcomer is bewildered as his head rises above the edge, and he
sees level miles of pasturage, generally dotted with cattle, where
he expected the common rocks and mixed angles of an ordinary hill
top. Such a plain is deep in snow-grass, stippled with violets, and
large mauve and white daisies, and in some places bright with a
particularly handsome dwarf prostanthera, the tiny foliage of which
is almost hidden by its profusion of flowers. That is a summer
view, when the air is of a clearness rarely known to lower levels,
and the many tiny streams and pools (the headwaters of the rivers
"downstairs") shine like bits of fallen sky. Winter is another
story. All is smooth white "far as you can look or listen," save
where the snowpoles raise ghostly heads. You understand then why
the trees have failed to climb this far, or at best, have
established only a few furtive colonies in sheltered hollows. The
snow-gum is a sturdy creature, as it needs must be to survive the
winter storms of these heights. Its growth is largely horizontal,
for the weight it bears in the cold season turns the branches
outwards. A fine old specimen near Mount Cope, on the Bogong High
Plains, is about thirty feet high with thrice that spread. Its
smooth, fat, green stems curve and twist in such Rackham-like lines
that you look sharply at its roots to catch the possible fairy.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a name="image-3" id=

</p>

<p class="caption">The Bogong High Plains in Winter</p>

<p>These "high places" are attracting attention as tourist resorts.
The present generation may not, perhaps, see residential
accommodation in such generally inaccessible parts, but there is no
reason (save possibly a financial one) why the tourist should not
view this country even now. The old mining tracks, to-day the pads
of the cattlemen, are often in good condition, and they could be
improved at a very small expenditure. Mostly they are not difficult
to trace. Some still show the ancient blazes of the men who opened
them out, old axe-marks that the trees have almost absorbed. If the
signs are no longer conspicuous to guide, they serve other purposes
well; from one scar, sunk well back into the tree, peered a nesting
robin. A few rough houses, weather-proof, with some wooden bunks,
could be placed at intervals for night shelters, or arrangements
might be made to improve and utilise the musterers' huts (as for
instance, Tawonga Hut or Wallace's on the Bogong Plateau), which
exist wherever there are cattle, and are only occasionally
occupied.</p>

<p>The views are noble and spacious, as well might be expected from
such rare altitudes. There is but little higher country in
Victoria, and all around are tall peaks and deep valleys. The
plains of Mount Howitt are some 5,700 feet above sea-level, the
Dargo High Plains cannot be much lower, and those that stretch from
Mount Fainter (whose twin peaks rise 6,160 feet) are well over
5,000 feet. If one cannot actually "survey mankind from China to
Peru," the outlook is yet sufficiently impressive. From Fainter (so
little known even by name, yet the fourth highest peak in the
State) there is an enthralling spectacle. Its cairn stands on the
edge of a gulf at the bottom of which, somewhere, must run a branch
of the Kiewa River. But it is far out of sight. The opposing wall
is formed by Mount Feathertop, 6,306 feet. Bogong, greatest of our
mountains, towers 6,500 feet on the other side. Everywhere is a
huddle of hills, most of them well over 5,000 feet, coloured in
every shade of blue, fashioned in every shape, sitting "like giants
at a hunting." Faint and far, on an horizon that is seventy miles
away, the regal form of Kosciusko shows like a dream mountain.</p>

<p>And how to get to the high plains? It is possible to ride, as a
Parliamentary party recently did, and the stockmen do invariably;
or to walk, as a very few parties of nature lovers have done.
Vehicular conveyance is impossible. Whether the tourist trust to
his feet or to the legs of a horse, he will find a pack animal
useful. It is indispensable on the longer trips, for all food and
bedding must be carried. Take, for example, an actual tour of the
Bogong plains, recently done on foot.</p>

<p>The ascent was begun from Tawonga, a village lying like a tiny
stone at the bottom of a majestic bowl whose sides are mountains.
To reach it had involved a nineteen miles walk from Bright. There
is no store but provisions had been ordered for delivery there, and
packhorses and a driver were waiting. Three miles up the Kiewa
Valley, with its comfortable farms, the eager, rather shallow river
was forded, and a narrow track discovered that takes the first spur
in a breathless rush very disconcerting to town legs. It left
little leisure to admire the two dollar-birds that, disturbed,
rolled gloriously down the sky, but the stunted gums were noted
because of the shade they afforded. From the ridge Mount Bogong
showed across the valley, huge and beautiful, clothed generally in
timber, but with a few bare bluffs forming precipices high up.
There is a track over Bogong, but it is said to be overgrown at
present. Probably the best way to reach the head of this mountain
king is from Granite Flat (otherwise Snowy Creek) in the Mitta
Valley, forty-five miles by coach or motor from Tallangatta. That
in itself would make a fine tour, and variety could be added by
pushing on another nine miles to Lightning Creek, where a little
hostelry, known as the Austral Alps Hotel, sits picturesquely on
the bank of one of the best-stocked trout streams in Victoria.</p>

<p>The crest of the ridge did not mean level going. Steadily rose
the path, well-defined and wide enough for a loaded packhorse, but
often the surface was bad for man and beast. Decent foothold
alternated with stretches of loose stones and baby boulders; the
gradient, generally pretty fair, became at times worse than bad.
These conditions lasted for a day and a half, for it took the
walkers that time to cover the fifteen miles (estimated distance by
track) from Tawonga to the top of Mount Fainter. That could, of
course, be reduced greatly by using horses for riding as well as
for packing. All the way was charged with interest.</p>

<p>Bogong, as it changed with the varying points of view, was an
unending delight, and the valleys were full of seductive mystery.
Overhead would float that mighty bird, the great Australian
eagle&mdash;Audax, the bold,&mdash;with, perhaps, his mate, no less
noble in her majestic stretch of wing. At about twelve miles a
natural clearing in the snowgums gave unsurpassable views of the
Buffalo&mdash;that day a fairy range made up of cobalt and lapis
lazuli and ultramarine, and every blue from the faintest to the
deepest. The charm of that outlook could not be overstated. Three
miles more and the high plain begins. The first view gives no blow
to the eye like the sight of the great flat on the top of Mount
Howitt, which is so astonishing to the climber from the Howqua
because it is so suddenly seen in almost its entirety. The last
half-mile to the cairn on Mount Fainter is a gradual slope, free of
timber, permitting an outlook across undulating country that dips
to the east, and is banked on the south by a ridge that ends in
Fainter's second peak. This provides a fair hint of what is to
follow, for the general character of the plains is well indicated.
Water (that first essential in all bush travelling) had been
neither plentiful nor particularly good up to this point. At eight
miles there is a spring, and at ten miles another trickle rises on
a saddle marked by an old cattle-yard, and the remains of a hut.
The latter place is known to cattlemen as "The Springs." Both
require notice boards if they are to be of use to tourists. In one
hollow, between the points of Fainter, is good water near a
straggling group of snow-gums. Thereafter, the streams are
numerous.</p>

<p>The track passes half a mile from the cairn, and perhaps 200
feet below it. Over the ridge ahead winds a long procession of what
look like abbreviated telegraph posts&mdash;the snowpoles that
point the way where trees are absent, and tracks overgrown for want
of use. Several belts of timber occur; and continually the outlook
varies, constant only in its charm, until a curve to the left and a
drop of some hundreds of feet bring Tawonga Hut to view. It is used
only when the cattle are to be brought away at the beginning of the
winter, and when they are returned for summer pasturage. A good
stream drops in cascades near by.</p>

<p>Now the plains commence in earnest. Long, rolling downs stretch
to an invisible edge, beyond which show the tops of detached peaks
and ranges. In such a summer as that of 1914-15 the place is alive
with sheep and crows; the sheep making up on the good feed which
they had lost on their native lowlands (sometimes as far away as
Hay, in New South Wales), the crows attending to the burial of the
dead. On a natural rise sits the shepherd with his dogs, steeped in
sunshine and ease, watching his sheep nibble down the near slope
and up the opposite side, idle, save when it is necessary to send
the dog to keep his charges from going quite out of sight, or when
they are returned to the yards in the evening&mdash;for the sheep
are "folded" for safety every night.</p>

<p>From the edges one looks down into "the Pretty Valley," lying
smooth and placid, threaded with watercourses, bounded by high
hills, a harmony in tender greens; or into "the Rocky
Valley"&mdash;"a bonzer place," said the guide,&mdash;"like a
cemetery;" or down the wooded gorges of many rivers. Mount Jim,
nearly 6,000 feet above the sea, but only too feet higher than the
track, and Mount Cope, 6,015 feet, are passed. From the latter is
obtained what is probably the most extensive of all the views, and
to get it involves no more than 350 feet of an easy climb. By the
aid of the map and the compass many of the countless peaks are
identifiable.</p>

<p>Ten miles from Tawonga Hut is Wallace's Hut, and six miles
further is Fitzgerald's. Given good weather, this is the choicest
portion of the plains, as it is the last of them. For the track now
dips into a snowgum forest, then sharply downward through some
magnificent woolly-butts (Eucalyptus Delegatensis), and finally
emerges at the Big River bridge on the road from Glen Wills to Omeo
near Glen Valley. Here is civilization, and the return may be made
via Omeo and Bairnsdale; or by way of Glen Wills, the quaint old
village of Sunnyside, Lightning Creek, Mitta Mitta and
Tallangatta&mdash;a route that gives inspection of the fine river
flats of the Mitta, and may be travelled by coach most of the
way.</p>

<h3>(b)&mdash;DUNGEY'S TRACK (1929)</h3>

<p class="pin40">The way is one, the end is one,<br>
And still the track keeps running on<br>
From change to further change.<br>
No haste there is, no haste at all,<br>
Forever loveliness shall call,<br>
Blue stand the distant range.<br>
<br>
&mdash;R. H. C.</p>

<p>To me a finger-post, unexpectedly seen in an out-of-the-way
place, has an irresistible appeal. It has much the same effect as a
map had upon Robert Louis Stevenson. If the track to which it
invites be not followed, the pointer stands forever in the mind
like an indicator, saying: "This way, and no other, leads to the
Land of Heart's Desire;" and the mists of years make its imagined
passage seem ever more desirable.</p>

<p>There was a sign which greeted us in the Wonnangatta Valley, at
the foot of Mount Howitt, where a notice might as reasonably have
been expected as a creekbed in Collins Street. One crossbar
mentioned that downstream was "Wonnangatta 2 miles," the other
pointed at the great mountains from which the stream emerged and
mocked us with the tantalising statement, "Harrietville, 60
miles"&mdash;tantalising because only a well-equipped party, stout
of heart, and with more time at its disposal than we possessed,
could have hoped to tackle successfully the crossing and the
traversing of that little-known Barry Range which stands like a
wall at the head of the valley. That track remains terra incognita;
every day it gains allurement in my mind.</p>

<p>Another board which beckoned insistently was noticed long ago in
the Ovens Valley. It bore the legend "Dungey's Track," and it set
us wondering what kind of country it would have us travel. It stood
some three or four miles from Bright on the Alpine road to Omeo.
Later another post with that name on it was observed, but this,
still on the Alpine road, was about forty miles farther on. What
had the pad been doing in the miles between? What winding creeks
had it traced? What hillsides climbed or "sidled?" What adventures
had it survived as it explored the unknown? Always I meant to find
out, but not until recently did the opportunity come.</p>

<p>The cattle-men will tell you that this horse-pad to the high
plains was named after Detective Dungey, who, it is said, used to
roam the ranges looking for the elusive cattle-duffer and other
offenders. Whoever originated it showed rare taste and
discrimination; its ways are ways of pleasantness and its variety
is endless. In the beginning its lines were determined by utility,
the natural fall of the country here presenting the easiest
gradients, but by fortunate chance they embrace also some of the
most picturesque views in a locality famous for its scenic
features. The upper reaches of the Kiewa River are like the
Irishman's famous stream, "shtiff wid trout." I know no Victorian
river with quite so many of these sporting fish. Two of my
companions caught nineteen before breakfast the first morning
out.</p>

<p>Unobtrusively the track dodges off the coach road a mile past
Germantown. Snowy Creek joins the Ovens near by, and it is up the
valley of that creek that you must go for a good many miles.
Incidentally, how many Snowy Creeks are there in Victoria? In the
Alpine country the name is used almost as much as are Stony Creek,
Sandy Creek, and Stockyard Creek in other parts. Steadily height is
gained, one of the advantages of this way to the now popular Bogong
High Plains being the ease of its gradients. Little creeks come
running in, the narrow valley closes, and there is more than a hint
of tall peaks in the steepness of the sides. If I had the naming of
sections of the track I would call one "The Path of the Painted
Trees," and another "The Lane of Lost Leaves." Gayer than anything
that art dare attempt, a smooth-boled gum, sometimes as a single
tree, more often in groups, colours the bush with splashes and
stripes of brightest crimson, soft creams and bewildering greens,
painted up and down the shapely stem. Young bluegums stand like
illuminations, so bright are their leaves of clouded silver. Where
these globulus or maidenii have grown they have dropped huge adult
leaves upon the ground in scores, some as much as twenty inches
long, some extraordinarily broad.</p>

<p>At seven miles from Germantown, and ten miles from Bright, the
track rises to Symond's Gap, a saddle commanding views of Bogong
the Mighty, our greatest Victorian Peak. Here begins a long siding
across steep hillsides, which feed the Kiewa. Very fine was the
native Veronica, a Pimelia flowered profusely, and the slopes were
gay with many other blooms. The river ran swiftly far below, and
gradually the track dropped to meet it at a little hut known as
Lawler's. "Started one morning and slept in that night," was the
builder's history of this hut when we met him on the plains.</p>

<p>Interest grew as the march was resumed. The valley was still
narrow. Engaging glimpses were obtained of Mount Fainter, looking
in on the one hand, and Feather-top on the other, while all the
time the Kiewa hurried in and out of attractive pools in full sight
below. Hut Creek was a reminder that here was once a crushing
battery, and presently was seen the Machinery Spur, down which,
incredibly, the plant was brought from Baldy (Mount Hotham) to this
difficult position. The full tale is an epic yet to be written.
Some river flats afforded a change of going, a tall, thin waterfall
shone and shouted on the left, the Diamantina River was crossed,
and Blair's hut, a well-built, roomy structure, was reached as
evening fell. A mile or two before Blair's the original Dungey's
track had left us. It passes on by way of Dibbin's hut, on the
Cobungra, to rejoin the main road at Rundell's.</p>

<p>Next day provided the finest views. It was the last of the
upward stretch, and it gave the most climbing. From above Blair's
hut, where the Kiewa was finally left, the outlook was superb.
Feathertop, aquiline and stern, the most impressive mountain in
Victoria, stood in imposing grandeur just across the valley, its
great stature fully revealed; the famous Razorback looked its best
as it stretched back to meet Mount Hotham; and Mount Loch, facing
the far-away Omeo road, showed as the crest of an immense spur
rising to the left.</p>

<p>Belts of woollybutts, those eucalypts of the high places, were
passed, and the smooth, green, twisted stems of the snowgums took
their place. The air became subtly changed, and the clear spaces
between the gums were carpeted with snow grass, much of it bearing
a delicately toned heliotrope flower head. A tiny tarn, set in a
frame of lush green weed and black basalt, was noted at the base of
a cliff; the path wriggled past some rocks, and our feet were on
the Bogong High Plains, with their long lines of snowpoles setting
the direction.</p>

<p>Years ago, I prophesied that these spacious uplands, well
watered, full of charm, with an average elevation of well over
5,000 feet, would some day form a health resort and recreation
ground for Victoria. Their popularity has grown, and in the last
vacation numerous parties made holiday there. The cattlemen's
huts&mdash;there are at least six&mdash;form convenient centres,
the use of which may readily be obtained from the owners. Soon a
public shelter, erected at the expense of the tourist committee,
the ski club, and the Melbourne Walking Club, will be available. It
should help to make winter excursions almost as popular as the
summer excursions deserve to be.</p>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>BATHS IN THE BUSH</h2>

<p class="pin30">"Let a fellow sing o' the little things he cares
about..."</p>

<p>Many are the quaint baths we have come across, and used, in
wandering with the swag off the beaten track. Most of them have
been open air, but some, as at Mount Lookout, were under cover, and
none the less remarkable for that. It had rained all day as we
climbed to Aberfeldy, on Lookout, and a change of clothes in the
hotel, perched on the almost-deserted summit, was most grateful.
But first we found the bathroom. I stood in the bath itself under
an innocent-looking sprinkler affair, and my mate, unnoticed by me,
pulled a cord. If a pile-driver had been released the result could
hardly have been more astonishing. A whole creek fell upon me from
the reservoir overhead. Its weight and strength were overwhelming;
it paralysed sensation; for a few moments I comprehended what it
was like to drown. Then the puller let go, the torrent ceased as
abruptly as it had begun, and I gasped my way to a towel, feeling
as if I had been skinned. But the very vigour of it was a tonic;
the dinner that we ate that night witnessed to its virtue.</p>

<p>Much more wonderful were a couple of baths in the Dandongadale
River, one just before it pours over the top of Mount Cobbler, the
other well down the side of that nobby peak. The setting alone
would mark them out from other bathing places. In the first place
they were some 5,000 feet above sea level. There the baby stream
has cut deep pools in the conglomerate, and slips from one to the
other over rock made smooth as glass by long years of water
polishing. The game was to swim to the lower lip of a pool, and
from it slide full length and head first down the slippery slope to
the next basin. Friction was reduced considerably by the thin skin
of water that went with you along the channel connecting the pools.
It was an undignified proceeding, but in that rarefied atmosphere
everything seemed jolly. A little farther on, and the stream
tumbled over the mountain's edge in a leap estimated to be 500
feet. Two of our party climbed down with cameras to where the
prodigious fall ended. Being hot, and finding a patch of level
ground, they stripped and had the impudence to use this great
natural wonder as a showerbath. The slightest movement of the air
thinned the long ribbon of water hanging above them to the fineness
of a gossamer. It wavered out of existence altogether at times, but
it would gather again and thunder down with power. Then it was a
case of arms up to guard the head, and a hurried retreat to get
breath.</p>

<p>The sunlight sparkled there and nothing was concealed, but a
certain dip at Toolangi was invested with all the mystery that
black night under thick foliage can afford. It was a long, dusty
fourteen miles from Yarra Glen before we reached the Yea River,
libellously known there as the Muddy. Hurriedly we kindled a fire
and placed the billy in it before seeking a wash. Beyond the circle
of firelight the shadows stood like a wall. Once unclad, we groped
over sticks and stones to the edge of the stream. A low bank seemed
to dam up the current. Quite by accident we had stumbled on a small
weir. Halfway out on this we crawled and stopped. Original chaos
could not have been blacker. Then beneath us we saw faint stabbings
of light, and realized they were star reflections in still water.
How deep was the pool and what might it not contain? Holding hard
to the barrier, each set his teeth and slid feet first into the
inky mirror. I, for one, have seldom felt greater relief than when
I found it had a bottom. A slimy, oozy bottom it was, too, but the
depth was not more than four feet. A quick splash in the icy fluid
and we were out again, garrulous with relief, and raising the
choruses of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas to an offended bush as
we dried and dressed, and prepared our meal.</p>

<p>It was on the south side of the same Divide that we shared a
swim with some scores of leeches. It ended with a group suggestive,
according to the point of view, of living statuary or a scene in
the Zoo, for we formed a circle and picked one another clean of the
hungry bloodsuckers. German Creek, between Bright and Tawonga, was
another watercourse where these animals swarmed to an extent
sufficient to ruin the bathing. But the greatest blood-letting our
walking party every had was at the mouths of the gully leeches of
the Tangil Valley last Easter. Rain provided the bath; we were wet
through, and the trees and the scrub were blurred masses of
moisture. From leaf and twig and grass-blade, and every point of
vantage waved leeches, seeking for something living to attach
themselves to, and taking instant advantage of the passerby.
Visitors are rare in that secluded part, cattle seldom pass that
way, animal life generally is scarce&mdash;what they live on from
year to year is hard to surmise. They had evidently been fasting a
long time when we came into their lives. Never have I seen anything
so ravenous. We pulled them off, not in dozens, but in hundreds; we
bled from a score of wounds, and we took undiscovered specimens to
bed with us, to waken in the night and deal with them.</p>

<p>Of pleasant waters I like to remember the Buchan River, where
the weeping willows made green tents under which we lay in our
sleeping-bags at night, and the dappled sunlight turned the water
into a place of magic as we took our many dips in the warm daytime.
There we had swimming with us the "Gippsland crocodile," otherwise
water lizard, otherwise physignathus, a mild-eyed replica of the
goanna, but with apparently none of that reptile's rapacity and
suspicious outlook on life. Physignathus seems easily tamed.
Sitting at the riverside I have fed him with beetles within a few
minutes of a first acquaintance. One all but ate out of my hand.
That was a well-grown specimen, but the little fellow we caught
again and again in the Macallister (he did not want to leave us,
seemingly) was quite a baby, and I still regret that we did not
bring him along to the Melbourne Zoo. An interesting point about
this "crocodile" is that he swims altogether by tail action, much
as a man propels a boat by an oar over the stern of it. The front
legs are pressed close to the sides, the hind legs trail in line
with the body.</p>

<p>Pleasant, too, are memories of cool plunges in the waters of the
Howqua River, draining the slopes of Mount Howitt, of the
Wonnangatta, on the far side of that mount, and of many another
delightful inland stream; of dips deep down toward the seaweed
gardens waving on the floors of rock pools on our outer coast; of
souses in the rousing surf of the long Gippsland beaches. Hardly
less grateful to a hot and tired body has been the billyful poured
over us by a friendly hand when the stream, sometimes a mere
trickle down a rock face, has proved too small to yield a wash in
any other way.</p>

<p>Their special circumstances have made two bush baths etch
themselves indelibly upon my mind. The first was in the Otway
Forest. We had heavy swags, and when the temperature ran up to 108
degrees, we took refuge in the Clarey River. Thick scrub, tall
timber, and high banks shaded a shallow pool, and we stripped and
dwelt in its freshness, coming out only to eat a meal. The north
wind roared overhead but troubled us not, and the final touch of
peace was given to the scene by the presence of a white-shafted
fantail brooding serenely on her wine-glass nest and regarding us
with untroubled eyes. Not till evening had cooled the parched air
did we leave our liquid home. We had spent practically a whole day
in the stream.</p>

<p>The second contrasted strongly with that bath of peace. Tramping
one Easter along the coast near Hastings, we walked into the
artillery practice of a camp of gunners. They were some miles
inland, and were shelling the shore. In a pause, while we judged
they were changing position, we attempted to pass across the danger
zone. Half way over and all seemed well. Then phe-e-w! something
whistled overhead and hit the sea with a phut and a splash. They
had begun again and were sending over solid stuff to find the
range. "Run!" said a war veteran with us, and we ran. The day was
hot, the sand was soft, the packs weighed us down. There was nearly
a mile to go. As we ran I noticed the soil was pitted with bullets.
"Phe-e-w!" Over came another, much closer this time. I did not
think I could run any faster, but at that I managed to squeeze out
a bit more pace. A little farther on and we could see the danger
flag marking the edge of safety. By it stood a sentry. I shall not
readily forget his amazed face as he became aware of the handicap
coming charging down on him. "How on earth!" he began, and at that
moment, to a rattle of distant poppings, the battery opened behind
us and the headland and the beach we had just passed went up in
dust under a rain of shrapnel. With lungs bursting, our faces
flaming with heat and excitement, our clothes sodden with
perspiration, we solemnly undressed and walked into the ocean.
That, I think, was the most grateful bath I ever had.</p>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>THE HOMING PACKHORSE</h2>

<h3>A CREATURE OF MOODS</h3>

<p class="pin30">"The Commissariat cam-uel, when<br>
all is said an' done,<br>
Is an idiot and an ostrich and<br>
an orphan child in one."</p>

<p>"Tankle-tonk, tonk, tonk!" That is the sweetest sound, better
than a bird-call even, that a tramper can hear when he wakes in the
early morning on some lonely hilltop, miles away from everywhere.
It means that his packhorse, that beast of moods, has not left for
parts unknown, under cover of the dark. For a long tour on foot the
packhorse is invaluable, but his price is that of
liberty&mdash;eternal vigilance. He makes possible the long trail
on which no food can be bought, his sturdy back carrying weights
which no human being can carry, but he is as true a homer as any
pigeon. "With each remove he drags a lengthening chain." He takes
every opportunity, covert and open, to return to his native
stable.</p>

<p>Mahomet was truly a wise man. He said: "Trust in God; but tie
your camel's leg."</p>

<p>As you make camp at the end of a day's march, he stands patient.
One by one you loosen and drop the long surcingles and the
miscellanies which make up his load. Finally the pack saddle is
dumped. He shakes himself vigorously to ease his muscles, and at
once reaches out for the nearest mouthful of grass. Where are the
hobbles? You find them, fix a pair on his front feet, hang a
tankling horsebell on his patient neck, and turn to other jobs.
Invariably he begins to feed, with a "tonk, tonk, tonk" as his head
moves rhythmically for each mouthful, and an occasional
"tankle-tankle-tonk" as he shakes the flies from his face, or lifts
clumsily his manacled feet over a log. If he is old at-this game he
edges all the time toward the way he came, making a flying start,
so to speak, for a break-away at night. He is helped by the fact
that while at first you are acutely conscious of his bell-ringing,
it presently becomes a commonplace, and you can no more say when it
ceases than you can name the hour at which the birds cease singing
as the daylight dies. You settle down to the camp-fire and the
pleasures of a smoke and a yarn till bed calls. Then it's: "Anybody
heard the horses lately?" and a dead silence while all listen. An
owl wakes and utters the melancholy "Mopoke!" which he conceives to
be singing, but no bell sounds. "Heard him a while ago," says
someone. "He might be lying down," suggests the optimist. Saying
appropriate things, you start out in the velvet black toward where
the beast was last seen. Logs trip you, you find the entrance to a
wombat pit, and finally you stumble over an uncertain white blotch
which rises with a groan and clanks a bell in your face. He was
lying down, after all. Relieved, you bless him and retreat, to
find, in the morning, possibly, that Cossack, despite his manacles,
is nowhere to be heard or seen. You trail him, no difficult matter
with his tied feet making deep prints in the earth, and with luck
you find him, and are back to camp again by midday. Incredible are
the distances hobbled horses can travel in a night. On Lake
Mountain it took a mounted man till mid-afternoon to find and
retrieve three of them; from Oberon Bay, at Wilson's Promontory, a
pair crossed long, sandy beaches, the double indentation of the
plunging feet marked deeply in the shingle, waded rivers, broke
down a barrier laid across the track to stop them, and climbed
ridges of unbelievable steepness before the pursuer overtook them.
Always after such an escapade the animals behave with exemplary
resignation, and as they travel farther from home, in altogether
strange country, the attempts to break away usually become
fewer.</p>

<p>Packhorses are as varied as human beings in temperament and
makeup. I have had some which, like Henry Lawson's, "would follow
like a dog;" some, like the flea-bitten grey Cossack, which were so
wise that they could judge to a hair whether the load would or
would not go between a pair of close-growing trees or past a
projecting rock; some which would blunder at anything and show
about as much intelligence as a sheep. An old brown crock to whose
halter I was attached as we made the long ascent of Mount Bogong
used to keep going as in a dream. If I stopped to look at the view
he kept right on and squeezed me between his pack and anything
handy, a tree or a siding, as he tried to push past. Along the
interminable switchbacks which lead to the summit of Cobbler, my
"commissariat cam-uel" pulled back hard on every upgrade, almost
hauling the leading-rope out of my hand, and on the downward slopes
he came well forward, trod on my heels, and leaned his hairy chin
on my shoulder while he blew on oaty breath past my ear. His strong
suit was becoming jammed between timber; if he had been a camel he
would certainly have tried the eye of a needle. Where he stuck, he
stayed. Twice have I seen packhorses bolt. The first time was on
the last 500 feet of Bogong, going up from the Little Snowy Creek
side. With the certainty that they could not go far wrong on the
big whaleback summit, the horses were turned loose ahead of us.
From admiring a snowfield we turned just in time to see the team
silhouetted on the skyline and to witness a remarkably fine
exhibition of kicking. A pack on one of the beasts had slipped
going up the steep grade and had worked down under its middle. It
was engaged getting rid of the irritant. Unidentifiable objects
rose and fell against the sky like the stock-in-trade of a juggler
practising a new trick. With one final buck the straps parted and
the animal, relieved, "passed in music out of sight." A second
occasion was on the level road near the junction of the
Dandongadale and Buffalo rivers. The three horses were in frisky
mood. They trotted ahead of us and all went well till one
apparently challenged the other two. From a trot to a canter was a
quick transition; the next stage was a gallop with packs swaying in
ludicrous fashion. The swags began to fly and the sporting members
of the party were offering odds about who would lose his swag last
and so have the shortest carry. That bolt went a couple of miles
before it arrested itself, the heavily-laden horses whose packs
refused to budge pulling up from exhaustion, the other for
companionship.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the packhorse's desire for home; the other side
of the picture is when he feels lonely and will not leave the camp.
He seems to sleep very little. Sometimes between the midnight and
the dawn he wakes, shakes himself vigorously, and proceeds to feed
as close to you as he can reasonably get. Lying on the ground, with
no more protection than a sleeping-bag, his trampling sound,
alarmingly near, and his never-ending bell, would waken the
deafest. I picture such a camp on the Moroka, just below that Mount
Wellington, lately brought into much prominence by the Governor's
visit. We lay about the ground, and between our beds and round
about us went the horse with the bell, threading in and out like a
lancer doing a fancy figure to music. Everyone shammed sleep in the
hope that someone other than himself would rise and deal faithfully
with the nuisance. How long we lay I cannot say. Suddenly, with a
remark which for comprehensiveness I have never heard equalled, a
weary form arose, a stick was hurled, there was a leap from the
horse and a crash, while everyone shrank up small, and peace was
again at her ancient business of soothing the world, our camp
included.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>THE BUNGALOW ON FEATHERTOP</h2>

<h3>PACKHORSE AND DOG</h3>

<p>Picture a bungalow set like a swallow's nest on a ledge some
5,000 feet above the common level of our world. On all sides are
snow-gums, many of them bleached by death to a skeleton whiteness.
In front the land drops with startling suddenness; from the windows
you see nothing but ranges of high mountains across a gulf many
miles in width. At the back the view is of ridges rising higher and
ever higher to where Mount Feathertop holds a proud head clear of
all such trivialities as timber.</p>

<p>It is an astonishing place, this bungalow. The stranger has
probably walked the seven miles&mdash;the steadily ascending seven
miles&mdash;that climb out of Harrietville, or he may possibly have
come by way of that fascinating ridge known, with some
justification, as the Razorback&mdash;nine miles on the thin edge
of things! It doesn't matter; all tracks lead more certainly to
this solitary house than ever roads did to Rome.</p>

<p>A spring burbles near by. It was probably the determining factor
in fixing the site of the dwelling.</p>

<p>No snow is showing just now, but everywhere are signs that snow
sets the keynote of the general life, and that winter is recognized
as the true king of these regions. A toboggan leans against a shed
wall; inside are so many skis that the facetious visitor may be
forgiven who suggested that the place might appropriately be
renamed The Harem.</p>

<p>Without, the views are superb. Within, to the tired traveller
anyway, the scene may be still more entrancing. A dining room
facing the sunset, spacious fireplaces, twenty-four beds with
spring mattresses and unlimited blankets, an amazingly
well-equipped kitchen, and, miracle of miracles! a hot water system
supplying two bathrooms.</p>

<p>The winds may howl on Feathertop, and the storm may threaten;
they hold no terrors for the tramper who has reached this
haven.</p>

<p>He must bring his own food; that is all that is asked of him,
plus the ability to cook it. A caretaker is in charge in these
summer months. He sees that order is maintained and he collects the
small fee charged for a bed. Otherwise the temporary lodger may
easily deem himself the owner.</p>

<p>But how does the caretaker live, perched on this lonely height,
his nearest neighbour in the valley five thousand feet beneath
him?</p>

<p>That is where Bill and the packhorse come in.</p>

<p>Bill is a spotted dog. He looks to an unprofessional eye, a
mixture of the known kinds of dog, with perhaps fox-terrier
predominating. The packhorse is what the schoolboy called his
collar; a "pale black." For the purposes of this act the two
animals may be regarded as one, for Bill does not move without his
equine mate, and the horse is lost without Bill.</p>

<p>The caretaker runs out of supplies. He walks down to
Harrietville, picks up the daily papers and a stock of food; the
packhorse is loaded up, and the three start up the winding path to
the bungalow. The man leads, the horse walks soberly behind,
grabbing an occasional mouthful as he goes. The dog investigates
the bush after the manner of his kind.</p>

<p>Duly the procession arrives. The horse stands to be unloaded;
Bill has a doze. "Home, Bill!" says the caretaker, and tosses a
pebble at the pair of them. Bill looks up at his cobber. "Woof!"
says he, and off they go down the long slopes unattended, alone,
apparently as happy as the proverbial Larry.</p>

<p>Two hours or so later Bill is going about his lawful occasions
in the street of his native village, and the old packhorse, tail
busy with the flies, is waiting outside the store to have his gear
removed. A perfect partnership. Year in, year out, they go and come
together, always together, equally reliable, whether
man-accompanied or not.</p>

<p>I wonder what they yarn about when there are no bothering humans
with them! And I wonder still more what is going to happen when one
of the two has to take that long long final trail that each and all
must travel alone!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>SWITZERLAND WITHIN OUR GATES</h2>

<h3>HOLIDAY HAUNTS WHERE THE SNOW LIES DEEP</h3>

<p>Amongst the earliest things I can remember in print are some old
woodcuts showing St. Bernard dogs rescuing travellers in the snow.
Big, shaggy fellows the dogs were, each with a flask of creature
comforts or a rug bound to his neck, and we marvelled, as children,
at the wonderful instinct, or as wonderful training, which led
these kind-faced beasts to do their deeds of mercy.</p>

<p>The snow was always deep, the wayfarer always in the last stages
of exhaustion, the dog always just in the nick of time. A wave of
emotion fixed for ever the sentiment that the good monks of the
great St. Bernard and their dogs stood for all that was amiable and
self-sacrificing in life.</p>

<p>It is an iconoclastic age. I have had to jettison the belief
that the St. Bernard dog is invariably a noble animal, inspired in
every one of his works by a blind devotion to the service of man. A
friend showed me scars on both his arms as the result of an
introduction to one of my canine heroes&mdash;an entirely
unprovoked attack, by the way!</p>

<p>There survives, however, the tradition of St. Bernard Hospice as
a place of refuge for the snowbound pilgrim, and, despite my
maltreated friend, the records show a truly remarkable number of
rescues effected by the dogs of the old monastery, built so many
hundreds of years ago on that dangerous mountain pass between Italy
and Switzerland.</p>

<p>More than half seriously I suggest that we may soon need the St.
Bernard breed here in Victoria. I have just revisited our own St.
Bernard, and everywhere about that great huddle of ranges, of which
the Hospice is so convenient a centre, are signs that our so
long-neglected snowfields are surely coming to their own. Ski-ing
and other winter sports are steadily growing in popularity, and the
motor car makes it possible even for city people to reach the big
hills, or at least come within striking distance of them, with a
minimum expenditure of time and the maximum of comfort.</p>

<p>Accommodation is the great trouble. The demands on the Hospice
last year far exceeded its resources, and the indications are that
the requirements will be much greater this coming winter. It is
easy to visualise a great chalet standing on the spot, a plateau
carved out just below the crown of the mount, where the old
building for so many years known as Boustead's, now cuddles in
against the cliff wall. Snow lies here for many months, and even
this warm Christmas time it was showing as collars or as splashes
on the not far distant points, some of them the highest in the
State, of Bogong, Feathertop, Hotham, Loch, Wills and others.</p>

<p>At present the Hospice on St. Bernard is the nearest shelter,
actually in the deep snow, which the tourist can reach by road from
any of our bigger cities under the winter conditions. His car may
not be able to go quite the whole way in the season, but from the
point where the drifts become impassable he may be conveyed by
means more appropriate to Alpine conditions.</p>

<p>Once at the top he finds himself in a country "clothed in white
samite, mystic, wonderful." The high road to Omeo, along which he
has travelled, has become as a rumour, blurred and indistinct, its
cuttings mere rounded mounds, its levels merged into the universal
vagueness. Vegetation generally is represented by irregularities of
surface or lovely stalactites drooping like fringy
shawls&mdash;they hang from the tops of the stunted gums. The
telephone wire gathers incredible masses of the powdery stuff and
sometimes breaks under the strain. The great peaks are dazzling in
their purity as they stand solemnly about.</p>

<p>Unlimited are the fields for Alpine sports. The summit of Mount
Hotham, smooth and treeless, with fascinating slopes and gradients
of every degree, is only six miles away, following the curves of
the road. Nothing could be better for the skieur. Immediately
beneath the crest there issues the Diamantina spring, one of the
headwaters of the Kiewa, and from here may be attempted what must
be a truly wonderful run, the tracing of the far-famed
Razorback.</p>

<p>This leads to Feathertop's fine slopes, from which may be had,
across the gulf of the Kiewa's western branch, a perfect view of
another great ski-ing ground to be&mdash;the Bogong High Plains.
Closer to the Hospice are several "nursery runs" and other
clearings prepared specially for snow games. At the Diamantina
there is now a strong, well built hut for the convenience of
travellers who find themselves benighted or weather-bound on these
exposed heights. It was erected by the Country Roads Board, whose
thoughtfulness in this matter deserves public acknowledgment. All
reasonable conveniences have been supplied, and a box of emergency
rations, to be used in case of need only, rests on the table.</p>

<p>In a sheltered nook nearer the top of Hotham stands another
Roads Board house&mdash;a substantial dwelling of many rooms and
many beds, where temporary board and lodging may be obtained in
special circumstances as at an ordinary guest house. Ten miles
further on Rundell's accommodation house is also open, so there are
no long stages without shelter.</p>

<p>Great is the traffic over this elevated thoroughfare in the
summer time. Every year its charm is becoming better known, and
motorists, cyclists and walkers pass in procession whenever a
vacation is long enough to permit of the excursion.</p>

<p>An exceedingly popular tour with the tramper is the round from
Harrietville over Feathertop and the Razorback to the Diamantina,
and down again via St. Bernard. The stages are easy&mdash;a seven
miles' climb to the Bungalow on the ridge of Feathertop, an
approximate nine miles along the Razorback to the hut at the
Diamantina, five miles of main road to the St. Bernard Hospice and
thirteen, all down hill, back to Harrietville.</p>

<p>The city man can take train to Bright, and a car service will
make the sixteen miles along the Ovens Valley to Harrietville, a
matter of no more than another half hour. The walking trip may, of
course, be done in reverse order. In either case the tourist may
leave Melbourne in the morning and be on a mountain summit that
evening.</p>

<p>St. Bernard is the mother of rivers. A hundred feet below the
Hospice gush out the cool waters which become the Ovens, flowing
away to help feed the Murray; at the back are the beginnings of
those two fine watercourses, the Dargo and the Wungungarra, both
destined to reach the Gippsland lakes. The Buckland, too,
originates close by, and, not so far away, but owing more to Hotham
than to St. Bernard, is one at least of the several springs which,
united, form the west branch of that well-stocked and well-fished
trout stream, the Kiewa.</p>

<p>Standing on the ledge at the Hospice the main view is along the
valley cut by the Ovens over a period of countless ages. Deep,
deep, it is, and the eye falls down the steep wooded slopes to rise
again gratefully as it is arrested by the delicious blue of the
Buffalo. I find it hard to be moderate in expressing admiration of
the Buffalo plateau as seen from any point along this range. Its
skylines have a distinction all their own in Victorian scenery; it
stands aloof and bold, clear of the other great mountains; its blue
is constant, yet varies in tone with every change of light; when a
white mist lingers about its crags and gullies it becomes a realm
of magic, resting quiet for the moment on our gross earth before
floating on again into space.</p>

<p>Quite intimate with St. Bernard, just across the road in fact,
is Mount Smythe, and within easy walking distance, say a couple of
miles or so, the double peak of The Twins lifts clear of the timber
and furnishes a full panorama of views. A road, slowly being
resumed by the wild, leaves the main thoroughfare nearby for Dargo
and the old deserted goldfield of Grant, once a town of many
thousands of inhabitants, now without one.</p>

<p>In the eaves of the Hospice there are robins brooding in
skilfully hidden nests, a pardalote has burrowed into the bank at
the rear of the dwelling, pipits run to and fro across the cleared
upland. Summer or winter this is a good place&mdash;it is easy to
be at peace with the world in such a spot.</p>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>BLAZES</h2>

<h3>THE LAMPS OF THE BUSH</h3>

<p class="pin40">"Ever the blazed trail beckons,<br>
And ever the way is new."</p>

<p>Blazes are the lamps of the timbered country. Stand at night at
a tramway junction in a Melbourne suburb, particularly one on a
height, and you will see before you an almost perfect image, in
fire, of those long successions of axe cuts which run through our
forests from end to end. The rows of lights which loop and curve,
rise and fall, twist and turn, defining faithfully the windings and
contours of the streets they serve&mdash;those lights mark the way
of the traveller from the inner congestion of the city to the less
thickly peopled parts, and lead him back again. In just such
fashion do the blazes dip to the streams, skirmish round the
hillsides, mount to the heights, and trace the ridges, serving the
same end, but with greater seriousness, for they may be the sole
lines of communication between settlement and settlement.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a name="image-4" id=
"image-4"></a><img alt="" src="1402831h-images/AlongTheTrack-4.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">A Woolybutt Ridge</p>

<p>A difference is notable. The one is a guide by night, the other
by day. Blazes belie the apparent meaning of their name; they do
not shine or glow, or sparkle. None the less they are obvious, and
generally at a glance, to those who have grown to rely upon them.
The walker, the rider, who must keep in touch with these markings
over long distances, becomes wonderfully expert at picking them up.
He develops a blaze eye. To the city walker who would see the back
country, the blazed trails are invaluable. He cannot always be
steering by compass in mountainous parts which may involve him in
desperate passes; nor can he always find actual tracks; they are
soon overgrown when out of use. Once a beaten path existed from
Observation Spur, beyond Marysville, along the ridge to Lake
Mountain. As we looked for signs of where it joined the main
highway we met a roadmender. "You'll find the track on a map if
you've got one," said he. "It's the only place where you will find
it!" Had that track been blazed we would not have spent as much
time in the next few days picking a way through thick undergrowth.
"I am told there are people who do not care for maps," wrote Robert
Louis Stevenson. "And," he added, "I find it hard to believe." Maps
certainly are fascinating things; they tempt you to dwell
reminiscently upon the parts you have already made your own, and
they invite you to speculate what lies hidden in the territory you
have not yet touched. I know no finer time-waster than a map. One
of the most provocative of local publications of the kind is that
entitled "Map of the Eastern Portion of the State of Victoria,
showing mining tracks cut by the Department of Mines." It was
issued in 1909. Red lines zigzag across it in such profusion as to
lead one to suppose that it is easy to penetrate any part of that
wild country, that even the inaccessible is accessible. But the
plan is now really a record of blazes rather than of open ways, and
even the blazes are vanishing. Nature is never idle at her age-old
job of restoration.</p>

<h3>RELICS OF THE GOLDSEEKERS</h3>

<p>In forty years the Mines Department spent 80,000 on the
surveying and cutting of these tracks. They are numbered well into
the hundreds. All of them were designed to help the seeker after
Victoria's now departed asset&mdash;gold. The work was
systematically done. As a preliminary measure a surveyor went out,
seeking the easy gradients, the low saddles, the simplest means of
crossing the streams, the route which presented the fewest natural
difficulties. He probably returned by another course in his
endeavour to select the most direct line, and yet avoid obstacles.
He blazed as he went, and he noted all details necessary. Then a
contract was let. The specifications generally provided for
"blazing, clearing, side-cutting, crossings, corduroy, culverts,
bridges, approaches, finger-boards, and all other necessary work,"
and the tenderer was told that he would know the route by a large
triangular blaze, the letters M.D., and the number of the track,
all of which were cut into the sapwood of trees at the terminal
points. He would further have to guide him rough bark blazes on
adjoining trees, single stakes put in every quarter of a mile, and
double stakes at every mile. His contract was to clear the scrub
and timber away in "straight reaches of as great a length as is
consistent with adherence to the blazed line," and it is
astonishing to learn, when one remembers the thick forests, that
"every tree within three feet of either side of the clearing" had
to be marked with "two large triangular blazes." These were to be
cut, bark deep, at least five feet above the ground, and to "face
in the direction of the track."</p>

<p>Finger boards, not smaller than eighteen inches by twelve
inches, of three-quarter inch planed timber, painted white, and
with the required legend neatly written on them in three inch
letters, had to be erected by nailing, not less than ten feet above
the ground, to a suitable tree or a post, wherever necessary. I
shall not readily forget the shock which a signboard of this kind
gave us, a party of walkers, as we emerged into the Wonnangatta
valley after crossing Mount Howitt. It was the first we had seen,
and it stood in that wilderness looking as much out of place as a
swag and billy would on the Saturday morning "block" in Collins
Street. The official blaze, it will be noted, is cut in the shape
of a triangle. But it does not keep that shape. The weather
distorts it, the tree grows and twists it about, the living bark
will sometimes almost completely cover it, given time enough. So a
blazed and cleared trail, after the lapse of years, may be no more
open than any other part of the forest, and the old axe-cuts may be
represented by scarcely discernible dimples on occasional trees.
Sometimes the cut has eaten into the timber, and a hollow has
formed which has eventually extended to the ground. Occasionally a
blaze was lettered. A "T" which can still be seen on a portion of
the horse-pad from Warburton to the Baw Baws indicates that this
was in early days the Tanjil track.</p>

<h3>BUFFALO'S BACK DOOR</h3>

<p>Most of the old pads, as has been said, are being lost from
disuse. The principal reason for maintaining them has vanished now
that the gold has gone. Those which exist are in the main kept open
by the cattlemen who follow their windings taking stock from
far-back stations to market or moving the beasts to the high plains
in the spring, and back again to the valleys in autumn. The map of
the mining tracks is spread before me as I write. Which route would
I take if I had</p>

<p class="pin10">"...liberty<br>
Withal, as large-a charter as the wind,<br>
To blow on whom I please?"</p>

<p>The Alps call loudest. What of the Buffalo, that alluring
tableland, the summer attractions of which are not half well enough
known? It is true there is no crimson line to follow there&mdash;a
motor road is the evident way&mdash;but the adventurous may still
find a thrill by entering at the back door, the means being a
couple of little-used pads which rise out of the Buffalo River
valley, and wind through country rough enough to suit the most
ardent admirer of the wild. Or the paths may be preferred which
creep along the ridges of St. Bernard and Hotham, and give access
to the crest of picturesque old Feathertop. But I think that of
them all I would most gladly be on the winding way which traces
back the Howqua (that finest of our mountain streams) to the foot
of Mount Howitt's huge bulk. From the thickly timbered valley the
track twists and curls, ever climbing, until it breaks over the
edge of the Howitt plain, green with snowgrass just now, and
stippled with alpine flowers. The altitude is nearly 6,000 feet:
the air has a quality almost intoxicating. Around stand sister
peaks, no less great: between them are blue depths, wonderful to
see.</p>

<p>No blazes are on this upland, for the timber has been left
behind. Snowpoles take their place, short standards which look like
the skeleton of a telegraph line. Over the far edge plunges the
track and down the villainously short zigzags&mdash;"they sometimes
zag before they zig," said a distressed walker&mdash;which lead to
Basalt Creek and the Wonnangatta Valley. There it is possible to
see a house again (on an average of one in twenty miles), but never
a bridge, so it is a case of wading every time the river has to be
crossed. Blazes are again the guide. Where the Moroka comes in from
Mount Wellington they beckon upstream, but they soon prove hard to
follow. This is the ancient Tamboritha track; as it crosses
Arbuckle it branches to Wellington, most varied of all Victorian
mountains with its long grassy plain, its mighty outcrops of rock
and its hidden lake.</p>

<p>But the invitation of the Moroka may be disregarded. Then will
come more wadings, a high ridge or two to climb, a tiny settlement
to wonder at, and the comparative civilization of Dargo is reached
with its motor road connecting with the distant railway. "And so
home," as Mr. Pepys would say, only to see the blazes beckoning
again whenever a map is touched, and to feel a call which it is
hard to disregard.</p>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>CHRISTMAS BY THE WAY</h2>

<p>The townsman who would see the outback country cannot afford to
neglect the week or ten days' break from business which forms the
Christmas-New Year holiday for so many. Thus it has happened that a
party of half-a-dozen ardent walkers has consistently missed the
usual home festivities of that season for the last fifteen years.
How much longer the members can keep it up no one knows, for the
family demand grows louder and more insistent each year. Meanwhile
these nomads are still gathering experience, as they have done for
so long, of Christmas out of doors. Incidentally, they have learned
what the festival means to the lonely homestead sitting far removed
in its little clearing, from even the outposts of civilization, to
the still lonelier lighthouse, to the stockman and the hatter, and
generally to the dweller at the back of beyond. Christmas dinners
have been eaten in all kinds of circumstances and have been
composed of all kinds of materials, and the New Year has been
welcomed from beds pitched in most unlikely places.</p>

<p>Food to some extent distinguishes Christmas for the amateur
swagman as to his stay-at-home brother, though of course not to the
same degree. Both have a liking for plum pudding, and both know it
as a heavy diet. Only the tramper, however, who has one in his
nosebag, really knows how heavy it can be. Even the packhorse (when
we have been lucky enough to possess one) has seemed relieved when
that fine old relic of the past is done with. The pudding is always
eaten at the first excuse that presents itself. We have devoured
solid plum duff of the most approved pattern&mdash;cold, of
course,&mdash;lying on the bottom of a pitching boat as she fought
a way across Corner Inlet to the Promontory, we have served it as a
second course to newly caught crayfish on the Otway coast, we have
had it in a midnight train making heavy weather into Tallangatta,
we have quarrelled for it with the flies on mountain tops and river
banks from Mallacoota to Albury, and we have blessed its succulence
on the slopes of Kosciusko. Cheerfulness has usually been its only
sauce, and very good the combination is.</p>

<p>The pudding is about the only luxury the walker cares to burden
himself with, and then mainly because of sentiment. Every ounce
tells when you are "waltzing Matilda," and, after all, plain food
is best. Meat and bread, some bacon, some butter, rice, oatmeal,
and the inevitable tea, sugar, and condensed milk&mdash;these are
what count in the long run. The wayside onion, potato or berry
(blackberries are often plentiful at the end of December), are
always adopted if they are unattached, and many little odds and
ends that would be despised at home help to give welcome variety to
the menu when on the track. Woe betide the bearing fruit tree
encountered after a week's enforced abstention from vegetable
foods. I have seen a party of Melbourne citizens competing with a
farmer's pigs in Croajingolong for the ripe cherryplums he
obligingly knocked down from his trees. And if the porkers won the
race in three cases out of five, it was not for want of trying on
the part of the humans!</p>

<p>It may sound odd to some city dwellers to hear of snow porridge,
but more than once we have found ourselves, during the holiday
period too, with snow all about our camp, and no running water
handy. So the billies have been filled with the powdery whiteness
and refilled and again filled as the mass has kept melting. There
is some difficulty in judging how much snow is required to produce
a full billy of water. It was my turn to prepare the first meal on
one such occasion, and I fear I overdid it, for later that
afternoon a walker was heard to remark that the only decent drink
he had had that day was the porridge for breakfast!</p>

<p>A Christmas meal remembered gratefully was marked by an
extravagant stew. Some fresh meat (a piece cut from some
undetermined portion of the beast) had been secured that day in
passing through a tiny township. It was sliced into fair sized
pieces and supplemented with the final fragments of a round of
corned beef which had lasted the party for about a week. Some
onions and potatoes (also gathered at the little village), a bagful
of broken biscuits, half a pound of stale bread, a bottle of
bovril, a lump of bacon, salt, pepper, and several scraps of other
food, a little oatmeal, and a half cup of rice, all these went into
the big billy. Everything that could be fairly used was sought, and
the camp agreed that nothing seemed to have been left out except
the candle ends. It was a good stew, a bush bouillabaisse. There
was perhaps a thought too much water. Not until after the third
helping was there any criticism, however, and it went no further
than a suggestion that a sponge would have been a help in the
eating of it.</p>

<p>Bush hospitality is famous. It increases in quality as the
distance from the city lengthens. At this season it is at its
height. I have seen an old lady on the Wonnangatta welcome a crew
of unshaven strangers as though they were all prodigal sons, and
she their scriptural father. We have entered a remote Gippsland
lighthouse at midnight, the "nosebag" down to the last ration, and
have been received with every comfort the station could muster.
That is the common habit of those kindest of all people, the
back-country folk, and here and now I should like to bear testimony
to their unexampled generosity. The hotel-keepers, whose business
it is popularly supposed to be to let no traveller pass without
unfairly lightening his pocket, discover themselves human in the
little towns off the beaten track. At the hotel of one such, after
a good meal indoors (for we had come far and were short of food),
the New Year commenced remarkably enough at eleven p.m. instead of
the usually accepted hour of midnight.</p>

<p>We sat in the big kitchen with its homely chairs and sofas, and
told the city stories our hosts were avid to hear, and we listened
with interest to their chronicles of the district. We decided to
see the New Year in. But tired Nature, tired by the long, long
tramp that day and soothed by the processes of digestion,
prohibited our sitting up. She would have us lie down and sleep.
One by one we dozed off, till a hardy spirit rose and suggested
that for the purposes of this act the New Year should arrive at
eleven o'clock. It was then eleven. The suggestion was received
with applause, and the premature birth was celebrated with due and
proper ceremony.</p>

<p>We have witnessed the dawn of a new year from the edge of a
plain, set up like a table 6,000 feet above the common level of the
world; we have called the appropriate greeting from sleeping-bags
stretched at the edges of snowfields (how few seem to know that
most Christmases, there is an abundance of snow within a day's
train journey of Melbourne) that gleamed like diamonds in the early
morning sunlight; we have wakened to the roar of breakers on the
lonely dingo-trodden stretches of the Ninety-mile Beach; and once
we thought we were still in a bad old year, very bad indeed, when
we discovered that our hastily chosen stopping place, selected in
the dark, was the "tip" of a small country town.</p>

<p>Great is the power of the wonderful season. Leading a packhorse
into Glen Wills (it was skewbald, by the way, and we were naturally
hailed as the advance guard of a circus), I heard the thin tinny
bleat of a toy trumpet, and, turning a corner, discovered a group
of four little bush children. Father Christmas had come to them,
even as he comes to all good city boys and girls. And everywhere we
have been we have seen the pleasant signs that mark the time of
peace and good will.</p>

<p>Christmas is a great institution, and I feel moved to add,
especially out of doors.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>THE ENCHANTED GORGE</h2>

<p class="pin30">"The searching feet of change<br>
Have never found it out."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Kendall.</p>

<p>Surely enchantment guards the spot. It sits, at this moment of
writing, cool and green and inviting, a veritable haunt of ancient
peace, in the heart of a countryside wholly disfigured by bush
fires. Logs are crackling or reduced to ash, the tall trees stand
as pillars of cloud by day and of flame by night, where the autumn
grass should be yellowing, the landscape is a desolate blackness,
and the distances are lost in a blue haze of smoke. No more
striking contrast could be pictured than that between the tortured
outer world and the repose of this water-worn, tree-lined gorge.
Yet the distance separating the two is but a matter of a few
vertical yards.</p>

<p>The place boasts the impossible name of Dead Cock Creek. Just
about fifty years ago Dr. A. W. Howitt (those two great public
servants, Howitt and Von Mueller, between them left very few of the
out-of-the-way parts of Victoria unvisited), came to it in the
course of a journey by bark canoe down the Mitchell River. He has
hidden a most readable account of the trip in an old geological
report. Then, as now, the fires devastated the surrounding hills;
then, as now, they failed to penetrate to the creek beds. On the
evidence of the timber, I should say a fire has not at any time, or
say, for a hundred years, obtained a hold there. Geologically
speaking, I understand the gorge is young (I use the term with due
respect to science), but the trees appear to be nearly as old as
such trees may be.</p>

<p>As Howitt entered it from the river level to work inland, he
could escape by no other means than climbing, and it was only after
felling a tree to help him over a barrier of rock (across which the
water flowed), and continuing for some distance up the creek
bottom, that he succeeded in finding a place from which he managed
to reach the general level of the surrounding land. Our approach
was made from the maize flats of Lindenow, and we found ourselves,
at twelve miles, gazing down to the tops of the gorge timber on the
one hand and into the Mitchell River, far below, on the other. We
stood on the rubbly point just above "where the brook and river
meet," and, like the maiden of that poem, we, too, had "reluctant
feet," for the drop before us was steep and the path rough. The
swags we carried (for we meant to camp for some days) were anything
but a comfort at this stage.</p>

<p>Directly we left the hilltop a new world was discovered. The
track at once dives through and under vegetation quite unlike
anything "upstairs." The outposts and sentinels are currajong
trees, holding perilous footing on the very edge of where the
unscalable rock wall drops sheer for a hundred feet and more. A
little lower also are many giants of this family, leaning out at
easy angles from the slope, and sending wonderful columns aloft.
The live timber generally gives an impression of great, but healthy
age. How old the biggest of the trees are could not be guessed. One
mighty currajong towered up (we calculated) some seventy-five
feet.</p>

<p>A line run round his smooth trunk, just clear of the ground,
gave a circumference of fifteen feet four inches. His first
branches, up about forty feet, could not have been less than five
feet round. With what noble serenity he took the air, standing
above his neighbours in the assured calm of greatness.</p>

<p>But we were to see too many large trees to "marry them all with
a tape measure," in Wendell Holmes's phrase. "I call all trees mine
that I have put my wedding ring on," was his remark, "and I have as
many tree-wives as Brigham Young has human ones." Here he would
have altogether worn out his tape line. Working down in a shade
through which the sun wove dappled patterns, the most remarkable
trees were the white-flowering pittosporum (undulatum) of our
garden hedges, now covered with its resinous pods of gold, glossy
green lilly pillys (Eugenias), and kanookas, but there were many
other growths also, most of them of a wonderful size, and all bound
together and hung with long coils and spirals of five distinct
species of climbing vines. Finally came the flat, rock bottom of
the creek, dry save where a sheltered hole or two still retained a
little water.</p>

<p>The view here was unusual. On either hand rose the gorge walls,
not more than sixty feet apart, in part clothed with vegetation,
and in part composed of a brilliant red rock. From the sides sprang
trees whose upper branches mingled, giving an effect of long arches
and the most delightful vistas. To look down stream was to have the
picture completed by the high cliff on the other bank of the
Mitchell; up-stream, the eye was led on and on by ever-diminishing
openings, until the green lattice-work barred all further
vision.</p>

<p>It was a thirsty day, and we turned to the river. The going was
good underfoot, for we walked on broad rocks laid down like tables,
often with pebbles inset&mdash;a veritable "pudding-stone." They
were piled in confusion at the water's edge, and helped to dam back
a great pool, more than a hundred yards long, and of considerable
depth, which mirrored to the last least detail the green-clothed
hill at whose foot the river ran. While our billy boiled and a
"salamander," or "Gippsland crocodile" (known to science as
Physignathus), eyed us curiously from a sandbank, we swam amongst
the reflections and shattered them into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>Then it was: Where to camp? The sand, under a close canopy of
bushes, tempted us, but a cave was known to be somewhere up the
creek, so up the creek bed we wandered. A four-foot black snake,
doubtless driven down by the fires of the higher places, gave us
"furiously to think" as he poured his handsome body, glistening
black with red edges, into a safe cavity between two rocks. He may
be there yet, for we saw no more of him. In Bull Creek, however,
which empties into the Mitchell some 300 yards away, we killed his
replica, and within twenty yards another reptile still bigger. The
last was the most beautiful thing of its kind I have seen. That was
our full tally of snakes.</p>

<p>A tinkling of bell-birds suggested water, and, sure enough,
well-shaded by overhanging growths, we found some isolated pools,
from which eventually we were to draw a meal of mountain trout and
a fine eel. Above the second pool a rock barrier, thirty feet high,
stretched from wall to wall, and apparently, forbade all further
passage. It must make an attractive waterfall when the stream runs.
On the right the water has undercut the cliff to a depth of about
forty feet and for a length of 150 feet, forming a habitable cave,
dry, and practically waterproof. In this ngrung a narguna (home of
the stone devil) as the natives named it to Howitt, we lived for
five days, and a comfortable home it proved. Blocks of stone fallen
from the roof provided seats and tables, ledges of the back wall
seemed made for storing provisions, and the easterly aspect of the
opening allowed the glorious moon for last Easter to flood it with
light every evening.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a name="image-5" id=
"image-5"></a><img alt="" src="1402831h-images/AlongTheTrack-5.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">The Cave of the <i>Ngrung A Narguna</i></p>

<p>It was a place of mystery by night, and of constantly changing
beauty by day. We climbed the cliff by a wallaby track, and pursued
the watercourse for another mile, to where a cave of stalactites
and stalagmites, some so old that they have come together from roof
and floor, completely barred the way. We admired the extraordinary
growths of pittosporum, sixty feet high, and umbrageous to an
amazing degree; the kanookas that pushed eager heads 100 feet
towards the sky (great creatures girthed like giants); shady
myrtles of an unbelievable bigness; and the swings of creepers
which began in the earth, climbed to the treetops, came down in
long loops like ships' cables, and ascended again out of sight. And
we had a vision, now dimly through thick timber, now clearly in
more open spaces, of high, stark cliffs, golden-red in the level
sunlight, towering over all. It was good and new and wonderful, but
ever we came back to our cave, lured by its unfailing charm and
entertained by its domestic happenings.</p>

<p>Three graceful young trees rose beside it at the foot of the
waterfall, and one stood in the edge of the pool. In these and the
gums high up was a constant traffic of bell miners. Such pugnacious
little birds they proved, and with many a note other than the
metallic "tink! tink!" which has given them their name. They seem
strictly gregarious; feeding they were always together, and when
they came to drink or bathe, as they so frequently did, they came
in rollicking, noisy groups that behaved just as children would in
such circumstances. It was a delightful sight to see a dozen or
more of these olive-green sprites in a row at the water's brink,
dipping and raising their beaks in unison. No matter how occupied
they were, or how remote from the pool, they always had leisure to
devote to a visitor, and we saw birds as large as the red lory and
the bower bird attacked so vigorously as to be glad to seek for
water elsewhere. The only creatures left unchallenged were the
three "salamanders"&mdash;father, mother, and baby&mdash;who lived
close by, and shared the pool with them.</p>

<p>Martins twittered in the holes of our ceiling; the diamond
sparrow's "witti-chew" came faintly from the tall timber far above
us; bower birds uttered their throaty calls and sometimes showed
themselves for a moment; once a heron came down the length of the
gorge with the wind behind her, looking like a bolt from a
cross-bow; three eagles soared high overhead; wonga pigeons beat
their hollow drums; king parrots and the red-wattle bird vied with
one another in noise; a stray butcher bird made melody like a
woodland flute; gangangs and black cockatoos dropped stealthily
bitten pods as we passed, or grated harshly as they flew; and a
lyre bird saw to it that all the music of the bush was
"broadcasted." Those were not the whole of the birds we noted. Two
absentees must be mentioned&mdash;there was never a magpie's song,
and we heard no</p>

<p class="pin10">"Boobooks moan lone vespers in the dusk."</p>

<p>Despite the dreams that should have come in such a place, we saw
nothing of the original owner, the nargun, described as "all stone,
but his breast and his arms and his hands," who lurked in caves to
devour people, and against whom all weapons were useless. But one
night we woke to a dreadful scream, which drove all sleep away.
Near at hand in the gorge followed a blow as though a blunt axe had
struck hollow timber. "Hough! hough! hough!" went the flail-like
beat until a dozen or more had been struck. Then all was
silence.</p>

<p>In the morning we saw no sign of the mysterious visitor. The sun
shone, the birds sang and disported; the evil spirit had been
exorcised.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>FOOD&mdash;AFTER A FASHION!</h2>

<h3>A TRAMPER'S MEMORIES</h3>

<p>An old proverb has it that "God sends the meat, the devil sends
the cooks." Sometimes the back-blocks tramper, living on what he
can gather as he goes, questions the complete wisdom of that
saying. Being usually his own chef, he agrees willingly enough with
the second part, but he has more than a passing doubt about the
other; the food "sent" to him is often far from hinting a celestial
origin.</p>

<p>It was surely anything but a heavenly influence that suggested
to two of us, boys in the Strathbogie ranges, that the native
porcupine was good to eat. I recalled that somebody had said "it
tastes like duck," and Jim suddenly remembered that he had been
told the correct way to slay and bleed the poor beast. In that
unhappy hour we came upon a fine specimen shuffling his harmless
way through the leaves and grass, and straightway we pounced upon
him. If the earth had been soft, so accomplished a digger might
even then have beaten us, but it held, and so did the ant eater,
for it took vigorous work with a couple of sticks to turn him over.
That exposed his Achilles heel&mdash;otherwise, his long, soft
nose. Boys are savages. I am ashamed now to recall that we killed
him. We were both truly curious about the flavour of his meat. But
I personally don't know to this day what Echidna tastes like, for,
after carrying the prickly carcass a good many miles and blessing
it all the way, neither of us would tackle the job of skinning
it.</p>

<p>Porcupines aside, the swagman is well advised who does not
attempt to live on native game, but carries what he needs, and
renews it as the bush township or settlement affords opportunity.
If he is his own pack horse, his cooking outfit is usually a couple
of billies and nothing more, except when he'll press a piece of
twisted fencing wire into service as a gridiron. The billy can be
used for most purposes, from porridge to stews. Which reminds me of
our cook's Waterloo on one trip when he found dried apples in the
pack.</p>

<p>He was a remarkable cook in many ways. One of his weaknesses was
verse writing, and he usually had a manuscript or two about him
which we had to read. It proved quite a good means of keeping us
away from his cooking fire. "Fritters to-night, boys!" was his
announcement, as he opened up the apples. He didn't know that they
swell when wet, and he filled the billy to the brim. An hour later,
when we returned from a dip in the creek, the camp seemed covered
with apples. Half cooked, still warm, the little flat circles
stippled all the immediate landscape, and the billy on the fire
looked like part of a conjuring trick as seemingly endless billows
of good food rose out of its interior to topple hissing into the
blaze beneath. The fritters were all right when they did arrive,
but it is still unsafe to mention dried apples to that cook.</p>

<p>Foraging as an art is rendered easy in the back country by the
unstinted hospitality of the settlers. They are often
embarrassingly kind, loading up the traveller with the best they
have, and looking hurt when payment is offered. I recall a cattle
station well up the Macallister River, where five of us walked in
from the wilderness to try to buy some food. "Where are your
horses?" asked the squatter, as he poured out drinks. "We're
walking!" I can see his astonished face yet. "Walking!" he cried.
"What a (something) game!" When we left him we had mutton, both raw
and cooked, bread, butter, jam, milk and sugar, and he rode after
us later with potatoes. No charge, of course.</p>

<p>In such circumstances it is not merely the influence of the
Christmas season; the generosity is native to the soil.</p>

<p>Of one good forager we used to declare that he never drew a
blank. So uniformly successful was he, even under the most
difficult conditions, that legend (always too good to be true)
records that on one occasion, when he had been sent to a nearby
farmhouse with a billy and sixpence, he returned with a quart of
milk, a dozen eggs, a pound of butter and half-a-crown change!</p>

<p>One of the real gains of back-country tramping is the philosophy
it induces. If food is plentiful, you live well; when it is scarce
you learn to do with the little that is going and to joke about it.
A couple of well-known city men, a solicitor and a prosperous
contractor, find pleasure in telling of the dish of cold boiled
rice to which they were reduced towards the end of a long coastal
tramp. They were on the outskirts of civilization again when they
sat down, in the shade of a hedge, to eat the not-too-appetising
mess. Behind the hedge stood a cottage, and from it presently
appeared a benevolent-featured old lady. She gazed upon them
sitting there, she marked their only food, and then, to their
fearful joy, she came forth and handed them a shilling.</p>

<p>Commonly the amateur swagman lives well, and he needs to, for
the appetite he develops is beyond all town experience. Who would
eat a whole crayfish "to his own cheek," in the city? But I have
seen five walkers sit down to five crayfish they had newly caught
and freshly cooked, and the edible remainder would not have fed a
healthy cat. In town, too, the bread must be fresh; commonly the
staff of life on a long trip is carried through from the
jumping-off place, and may be ten days old before it is finished.
Appetite usually overcomes any tendency to criticise. On a tramp
which lasted three weeks the bread ran out altogether, and two
loaves found in an abandoned camp at Cape Conran were adopted with
enthusiasm. They were old enough to suggest the prehistoric; they
were hard enough for anvils; but they were eaten and, moreover,
enjoyed.</p>

<p>Up on the side of a Victorian mountain, far removed from
habitation, there is a pudding mine. We had eaten an alleged cake
with some gusto, cheerfully chopping off the cindered parts, but
when the cook, who had been engaged in secret rites for a night and
a day, produced three plum puddings he had made in the cattleman's
hut by our camp and had cooked in a kerosene tin, it was hard, for
once, to look pleased. They were pallid, evil-looking balls,
suffering badly from anaemia. Clammy beads of perspiration bedewed
their slimy faces, and hunger left us as we looked. But how to
dodge eating them without offending the cook? He was proud of them.
He said they were Christmas puddings. We temporised and carried
them on to be eaten "to-morrow." That night, when the cook slept, a
burial party went forth bearing burdens, and came back
empty-handed. The cook watched us darkly for the next few days. He
thought we had had a secret feast from which he had been excluded.
Then he broke into speech: "You're a funny lot o' coves," he said.
"You must be blooming money boxes. I put four threepenny-bits in
each of those puddings!"</p>

<p>"I can eat crow; but I don't hanker arter it!" remarked the
American. There are many things in the bush which could be eaten,
and which were approved as edible by our black brothers, but which
the white man's palate rejects. Snakes, for example, and the
suety-looking wattle grub, and those repulsive (in the mass) moths
known as the Bogongs. By the way, hunters who have lived
exclusively on kangaroo and wallaby meat (when trade was permitted
in those furs) have told me that they used invariably to suffer
from skin troubles, but that, I fancy, must have been due, not so
much to any quality inherent in the marsupials' flesh, as to lack
of vegetable foods. Fish, there are, of course, in practically
every stream, but at the end of a long day's march the swagman is
little inclined for the generally difficult job of first finding
bait before wetting a line.</p>

<p>No, it is more profitable for the tramper to carry what he needs
than to trust to what he can catch of the denizens of our wilds.
Shooting is out of the question, for a gun is too heavy to form
part of a swag, and the nature lover, in any case, cannot reconcile
himself to using an instrument which frightens all living things so
that they hide from his sight. All our creatures, anyway, are
better alive than turned into food.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>THE CARAVAN: WOMEN ON THE OPEN
ROAD</h2>

<p>The irreverent youth christened it the Suffragette Circus. It
certainly bore a colourable resemblance to the chariot of an
advance agent for some be-tented Aggregation of Marvels. There was
a rusty tone about the van that was shared by the pair of
depressed-looking horses, Ginger and Darkie. The former had some
spirit and despite his appearance he discovered himself in the
course of the journey to be a grafter, but Darkie betrayed no
interest in the outing, and only pulled when he must. No van was
ever so packed as this one when the eatables, the beds and their
six owners were aboard. The driver (the sole male) looked aghast at
the monumental pile, but he got it in&mdash;somehow.</p>

<p>"Now, all you want in the way of home comforts," said the
irreverent one, "is a few pot plants and a deck chair or two." That
was his parting shot as the caravan rolled away, buckets and
billies dangling from below, four lamps hanging on the side
bracket, and parcels oozing from every pore.</p>

<p>It was Eastward ho! That evening, the party wrestled with tents
in the dark at Lilydale, and settled down to the uneasy sleep of
the first night out. The flippant youth would have been gratified
had he overheard the comments of two residents who passed the
camp&mdash;"By gum! Here's a circus!" And at Launching Place next
day an inhabitant sought to know when they were "opening."</p>

<p>Leaving town had attracted some attention. Half-adozen girls
perched at precarious angles in such a vehicle took the popular
eye. "It will be all right in the country," was the consoling
reflection. The driver hoped so, but seemed apprehensive as he
listened to the chatter of hilly roads and creeks to cross. He was
a city man, and knew better what his horses could do in Chapel
Street than on "the Divide," or up Frenchman's Hill. His gloom was
deepened when further on Eileen and her parcels were added to the
load. Eileen is twelve stone, and her luggage included the bread
for three days. However, by all talking together the packs were
readjusted and the trip was resumed.</p>

<p>Several of the girls were justly proud of their walking powers.
Two had been on foot from Warrnambool to Queenscliff, from Bright
to Bairnsdale, and on many another lengthy tramp. "The long white
road" from Lilydale was as their native heath, and thereafter there
was ever (save at meal and bed time) a division of the party into
walkers and resters in the van. Three boasted at the end that they
had walked 220 of the total 260 miles of this pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Little Joe was gazing in his wonted benignity upon Warburton as
they passed through. The Yarra is always beautiful here, for it is
yet young and in its green-edged bed it has no thought of the
polluting city that awaits it further down. Rushing, hill-born
tributaries feed it from either side, including that sturdy stream,
the O'Shannassy, now being diverted to augment Melbourne's Water
supply.</p>

<p>The dust of the road turned Darkie to the same shade as Ginger,
and the fine powder settled impartially on all. Grateful was the
camp opposite M'Mahon's, and more than grateful the dip in the
river. Sleep was still a coy thing to be wooed by the more timid.
"What's that?" would whisper one of the two bedded in the van.
Cautious investigation possibly revealed a grazing cow, and a
subdued duet of relief invariably followed. "Oh, go to sleep, you
people," would come from one of the two tents, and peace would
spread her wings and brood upon the camp.</p>

<p>"Early to rise," was the motto. When dawn was standing tiptoe to
see over the hills there was often someone moving. The cooking pots
went on the reviving fire, the driver saw to his horses, and there
was a merry stir and a gay tumult in the quiet bush. The business
of the day had begun. Half-an-hour before the caravan started the
walkers were well on their way. When they were overtaken they gave
instructions where to stop for lunch, and they followed behind to
retrieve the belongings that the van shed generously under the
stimulus of the ruts and fallen trees that enlivened the road. A
renegade frying pan tried hard to escape. In one day it was
retrieved no fewer than three times.</p>

<p>Beyond M'Veigh's (Walsh's Creek) the track to the top of the
Divide was blocked repeatedly by logs, and the walkers easily
gained on the chariot. Bush fires had marred temporarily the beauty
of all this country. No water was found for nineteen miles, and
then it was livid of hue and rank of taste. The remains of the
lovely forests compelled admiration here, and from Matlock into
Wood's Point. The decayed and almost vanished village of Matlock,
said to be the highest in Victoria, clings to the top of the range
and commands a view of mountain and valley that is lovely indeed.
With the advent of seven strangers, the population increased by
over fifty per cent. Night fell with heavy rain, and from the
shelter of a deserted schoolroom, "high on a lonely hill," they saw
the clouds far below them, and heard the thunder shouting beneath
their feet. It was "the windy morn of Matlock," when they woke, but
the sky was clear and the day pleasant as the downward path was
taken that leads into quaint little, worn-out Wood's Point, full of
reminiscences of diggings and "the good old days." Crushing
batteries marked the onward way, and tiny cottages with gardens of
geraniums and other homely flowers showed occasionally by the
lightning flashes, for another storm broke before Gaffney's Creek
provided shelter. Indoors the clash of the elements took on a very
different sound, and only added to the comfort of the snug
Commercial Hotel.</p>

<p>In the morning, the party, as experts in "washing," supervised
for a while the work at the Rose of Denmark mine, and entered the
tunnel, but the road beckoned and Ten Mile was made that night. All
this side of the Divide looked well. Jamieson and the other tiny
settlements gave a picturesque note to the landscape. Darlingford
came in time for camping, and an empty schoolroom saved the usual
pitching of tents. Annette, proof against all weather, slumbered
outside as usual. With the blessed gift of ability to sleep well in
any circumstances, she recked nothing that Ginger shook off his
moorings in the night and cruised about her. The others heard his
trampling, his sighings, and his inquiring sniffs at her recumbent
form and pictured her lying there in dread. "Oh, how awful the
horse was last night," was the chorus that greeted her in the
morning. "The horse?" said Annette, blankly. "What horse?"</p>

<p>An old man, long-bearded, white-hatted, casting seed with his
right hand from a bowl under his left arm, suggested strongly a
well-known Biblical parable. No one was surprised to find that one
of his names was Joseph, and that the creek by which he lived is
known as Jerusalem. Altogether charming were the old men of this
district. It was another who responded to a request for fruit with
"Come inside, you pretty girls," and refused to accept payment for
the quinces and walnuts he showered upon them. He was a Scotchman,
he said "born in Belfast," he added, with a twinkle. Everywhere the
country folk were glad to talk, and many were the questions as to
the object of such a trip. "Are you going on a pickernick?" was the
inquiry of a small child who was given a lift to school. Another
asked where they were going. "To Melbourne," she was told. "What!
You going to Melbourne in that cage!"</p>

<p>The Goulburn's grey-green mirror had been followed for many
miles, but it was sadly blurred with earth brought down by recent
rains. Where it is spanned by the Eildon-bridge a beautiful camp
was formed on the night of 30th March.</p>

<p>Twice the Acheron was crossed next day on the route to
Marysville, via Taggerty and Buxton, the Cathedral Peak the most
conspicuous object much of the time. Both horses had felt the
climbing and the rough roads severely, and at the pretty township
of Marysville they were outspanned for twenty-four hours. With
unabated vigour the walkers took the opportunity to visit some of
the "lions" of the place, including the picturesque Steavenson
Falls.</p>

<p>That night the timid pair in the van woke clutching each other.
They had grown accustomed to the melancholy moan of the boobook,
the chump-chump of feeding horses, the sough of wind in the tall
timber, the thousand and one noises of the night in the bush. This
was something new. "Oh! Oh! What is it?" wailed Winsome, as an
invisible thing clawed up the inside of the cover of the van.
"O-oh!" chorused both, as it fell from the roof on to their bed. A
hurriedly lit match showed a possum departing hastily by the front
door.</p>

<p>Leaving Marysville, the homeward track was fairly entered upon.
Narbethong marked a lunching place, and Fernshaw provided a spot
for afternoon tea. Fires had been busy across the Blacks' Spur,
with somewhat curious results. Most of the vegetation of the
uplands had been swept away, and their loveliness destroyed. But
this opening out had given clear views of unsuspected gullies,
whose lush growths have resisted the flame and remain things of
beauty. A night was to have been spent under canvas just outside
Healesville, but, for the last time, rain forbade the pitching of
the tents, and a boarding house was found not too fastidious to
take in the somewhat bedraggled caravanners. The horses were
quickened by the homing instinct next day, and made light of the
thirty-nine miles to town. Just a fortnight after the start the
travellers disembarked, sunburnt and rather dishevelled, but well,
and stored with memorie of stream and mountain, forest and open
country, that they will not willingly let die.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>"FROM OBERON IN FAIRYLAND"</h2>

<p>What the bishop said of the strawberry may be fitly applied to
this delightful nook, so snugly tucked in on the western side of
Wilson's Promontory. Doubtless, God could have made a more
attractive bay, but doubtless He never did. Beauty and romance
combine in its title, for it bears the name of that Oberon, king of
the Little People, who wrought such powerful magic on a certain
Midsummer Night of which the whole world has heard, and beauty and
romance unite in its shape and position. Appropriately enough there
is a Titania Creek not far away. Behind the bay lie a hundred
thousand acres of brown moorland and craggy hills, shaded valleys
and tidal or freshwater creeks, the whole (let us be thankful)
reserved for all time for the enjoyment of the people of this
State. The first glimpse of the shining waters of Oberon Bay is
full of charm. You have come from the Darby River by way of Leonard
Bay, its singing sands responding with a sharp cry to each impact
of the foot, you have waded the Tidal River, pausing long enough to
admire the endless procession of the fish as they come skirmishing
in from the sea and back again; you have traced the smooth curve of
Norman Bay, itself an appetising spectacle, and you have struggled
up the vertical 900 feet of the Bad Saddle (well named), which is
really a shoulder of Mount Oberon. There you have paused, one good
reason being the views, the other that a spell is grateful after
the villainous gradient of the water-worn gutter which masquerades
as a track on the side of the Saddle. Through the timber to the
south shines blue water laced with white foam where it breaks into
Little Oberon Bay, and just beyond, so bright that the sun seems to
be always shining on them, sparkle the broad beaches of Oberon
itself.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a name="image-6" id=
"image-6"></a><img alt="" src="1402831h-images/AlongTheTrack-6.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">Oberon Bay</p>

<p>Bent like a bow from headland to headland runs a full mile of
gleaming strand. So gentle is the slope that at the ebb it is
probably 300 paces from the high-water line to where one could
paddle. No safer bathing could be imagined, yet the rollers coming
in are the full-grown offspring of the Southern Ocean. Out at sea
several islands help to give distinction to the view, but what
really stamp this secluded sanctuary with character are the two
peaks which stand sentinel-wise at the ends. Norgate, to the south,
some 1,400 feet, is thickly clothed in tea-tree, honeysuckle, and
other coastal growths, and its slopes carry many beautiful wild
flowers. At Christmas time the ridge was stippled with a pattern of
scarlet heath, blended with fringed lilies, yellow and white
everlastings, bluebells, and most noticeable of all, great beds of
pin-cushions (Brunonia), surely the most charming blue the bush
affords. The view seaward and along the broken coastline is of the
kind that one would hope to have always hanging on the walls of
memory. I know nothing quite like it elsewhere. In the halfmoon
bays, with their definite horns, there is a suggestion of the south
coast of New South Wales, but the islands provide a fresh note.
From Shellback, the first that greeted you as you came down the
long sands of Shallow Inlet from Foster or Fish Creek, the eye
wanders to Norman Island, the Glennies and the Anser group, resting
finally, from this vantage point, on the striking cone of Rodondo,
well away to the south and east.</p>

<p>Mount Oberon, the northern sentinel, is higher than Norgate. Its
sides look steeper, and some remarkable rocks, projecting at
perilous angles near the crest, break the clean lines
threateningly. It, too, is well clothed in shrubs. The blackening
of its base by a recent fire throws up into lovely relief a fresh
output of small flowers, the clean azure of the Wahlenbergias in
particular shining like a jewel in the sombre setting. Close
against the foot of the mount is the creek known, astonishingly, as
Growler's, and rather more than halfway along the beach from here
towards Norgate comes in Fraser's Creek, spreading flatly across
the sands after breaking through some high hummocks. There is
abundant choice in camp sites. If sand is objected to, a move
inland of less than a mile will give the shelter of honeysuckle and
tea-tree, with the Fraser close at hand, and access to long
stretches of irregular, open country, criss-crossed with tracks
leading away to the lighthouse, to Sealer's Cove, and, by
many-branching paths, to Lilly Pilly Gully and the Darby.</p>

<p>But the charm of Oberon Bay does not end with its shape and
colour, its matchless beach, its position and outlook. It is
charged with the magic of the unexpected. Exploration never ends,
for there is always something fresh to investigate. A current must
set in from the strait to the bay, for never was such a foreshore
for flotsam and jetsam. Every tide adds to the amazing variety of
objects washed up. Bottles and boxes are in the
majority&mdash;bottles of every shape and use, from a marking-ink
container to a fanciful creation which may still hold a faint odour
of the liqueur it once knew; boxes exotic and local, dropped
apparently from every liner and every tramp in the Seven Seas. A
whole thirty-foot boat lies all but hidden near high-water mark, no
more than a foot of her gunwale showing as an outline, her hold
choked to the top with firm-packed sand, and her long-silent
engines (if they still remain) well buried in the drift. What a
joyous task youngsters would make of digging her out&mdash;a
Penelope-like task, for each tide would probably fill the
excavations again! In the farthest little creek is driftwood enough
to build a ship, some of it a hundred yards and more from the sea
edge.</p>

<p>Round the corner are remains of at least two more wrecks, some
of the fragments so huge, yet thrown so high upon the rocks, as to
make one marvel at the strength of ancient Ocean. The softer banks
of the bay are remarkable for the way in which they break into
sudden pot-holes and rise as quaint towers, the latter often
fretted into sharp points and projecting ledges. The scrub from
inland is fighting desperately for foothold, and there are signs
that it is winning. Meanwhile it gives shelter to much small life.
Doubtless, from its recesses the fox, and possibly the dingo, look
out upon you as you pass, for the wind-smoothed sand shows
dog-tracks a-plenty. Two sets of antlers found here suggest that
deer wander this way at times, and the cloven spoor of goats is
common. Bird tracks, the dainty toe-marks of lizards, the smudgy
blurs made by snakes, and the unmistakable footprints of wallabies
are all impressed on this virgin sheet. Good shells are not rare,
and kitchen middens, marking where the black man feasted, "when
wild in woods the noble savage ran," are plentiful and still worth
prospecting, for the tools and weapons, the flakes and flints of an
age of stone.</p>

<p>All through the tea-tree and honeysuckles the wattle-birds shout
and squabble and build their homes; funereal cockatoos, in little
flocks flap their brilliant wings across the valleys, and make the
air discordant with their grating cries; bronze-wing pigeons feed
upon the Styphelia peaches; the coachwhip bird and his wife utter
their arresting calls; white-shafted fantails hover and flutter,
their happy gush of song breaking out between whiles; from every
patch of bracken comes the music of that "superb warbler" the blue
wren; black-faced cuckoo shrikes call softly "karrak-karrak,
karrakkarrak;" and both here and at the Darby mouth the English
blackbird has established himself, and nightly sends the sun below
the ocean's edge to the melody of his flute.</p>

<p>Oberon Bay will some day be better known.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>SOME WAYS TO WELLINGTON</h2>

<p class="pin40">The stars are bright on Wellington...<br>
I sit within my city walls,<br>
And, dreaming, hear a voice that calls,<br>
That calls me back to Wellington.<br>
<br>
&mdash;R. H. C.</p>

<p>Mount Wellington shows on the map of Victoria like an ear-drop
hanging from the main Gippsland mountain system. The blank spaces
round it suggest that there is still something to learn about the
locality, despite its use to-day by the cattle-man and its earlier
exploration by the gold-seeker. As a matter of fact, settlement
hardly touches it. I walked that way recently and in eight days of
tramping saw no human being other than the members of my party.
Legend has it that a wild man, an unfortunate of doubtful
mentality, lurks about the tops, showing himself only to an
occasional stockman and bolting for a hiding-place as soon as seen.
It may be so, but we discovered no trace of him. Only a dingo stood
to gaze at us curiously (he and his clan serenaded us that night),
three long-tailed brumbies pranced away from the far edge of the
big upland plain, and grazing cattle, brought from the lowlands for
the summer feed, completed our tally of the larger animal life.</p>

<p>How little Wellington is known, even in its own State! Speak to
a Victorian about this fine mountain, 5,363 feet in height, and he
will assume, as a matter of course, that you refer to the much
smaller hill which overhangs Hobart. It is all a matter of
accessibility. You are at the foot of the Tasmanian peak as you
alight from the steamer or the train; to reach the Victorian
mountain calls for quite a journey on foot or horseback after the
conveyance from the city drops you at the nearest point, say,
Maffra or Tinamba. It has many attractions, including that rare
enough thing even on our highest peaks&mdash;a clear view right
round the horizon, and that greater phenomenon&mdash;a lake held up
like a cup 3,00o feet above sea level, yet still some 2,000 below
where the crags tower up to form the highest point.</p>

<p>"Not the quarry, but the chase; not the laurel, but the race"
sang the poet, glorifying the true sporting spirit. So with
Wellington; the getting there is even better than the being there.
Several routes offer; none is easy. You may trace back the Avon
River (which farther down passes by Stratford town), crossing and
recrossing the stony fords that link up the deep pools, until
beautiful little Stockyard Creek, murmuring under tall white gums
and groves of Christmas bush, becomes the guide and leads to the
foot of the long, long rise which lands you, panting, amongst the
arrogant outcrops of the Gable End. Or you may take the wetter way
of the Macallister, wading and again wading that stream until you
accept soaked boots as the correct thing, and you stride into
running water as naturally as do the "salamanders" or "Gippsland
crocodiles," which are so plentiful in that countryside. One
January a party of walkers, coming down stream from the lake end of
Wellington, waded this river forty-five times in two and a half
days, before reaching the highroad at Licola. Only once, however,
was the crossing a deep one. Then it was found advisable to strip
and carry our clothes over on our heads. Custom made the watery
going seem easy after a time; frequently a man would stop, with the
river swirling around his knees, to have a drink, and once I saw a
member of the party, moved by the beauty of the scene, pause in
mid-stream to declaim an appropriate verse of poetry. From the top
reaches of the river a spur lifts this track along a dry stretch to
the final altitude.</p>

<p>Still a third way, perhaps the most difficult of all to find and
follow, demands that you shall first of all sample that remarkable
motor road which connects Dargo with the railway at Stratford. We
were told on a recent trip that its fifty miles cost £21,000, and
that an allowance of £1,200 a year is provided for its maintenance.
I do not know whether the result has justified the expenditure from
the point of view of utility; from that of scenery and "thrill" the
road is a great success. The motorist finds himself, soon after
leaving Briagolong, running round a series of ledges, much as an
ant might, and enjoying (more or less enjoying) the prospect below.
It consists mainly of a precipitous descent to the Freestone Creek,
whose pools mirror the steep, tree-clad hills which close the view.
There is no room, save in a few places, to pass another vehicle,
and as the car swings round the narrow, sharp-angled corners it is
well to sound the horn briskly and trust that your luck will hold.
We took a char-a-banc through there last Christmas. In those wilds
it looked like a town hall which had broken loose, so utterly
foreign was it to its surroundings. On one of the descents a
bushman was met with cattle. As he and his horse disappeared over
the edge of the siding to recover his scattered beasts, we called:
"A Merry Christmas!" Across his shoulder he flung a grim: "Thanks!
Any more of these damn things on the road?"</p>

<p>By long gradients, ever climbing, the summit of a range is
reached and crossed and a tired chauffeur relaxes before setting
the car's bonnet on the downward slope, which ends in the one
street of Dargo. Dargo is a township of walnuts. One tree, planted
forty years ago, is of fabulous proportions, and yields nearly
enough annually to entitle it to an income tax assessment. Others,
notably a group near the hotel, are also huge things, covered, just
now, with the green-cased nuts. "How on earth do you get them
down?" was a natural query as we gazed at the towering stems. "We
don't," said the local authority, "the green coverings split on the
tree when ripe and the nuts fall out. They stay on the ground until
we're ready to gather them."</p>

<p>But the thrills of the journey are only beginning. Have a good
lunch to steady you for a dozen miles of probably the most
picturesque nerve-test in Victoria. You retrace your road for six
miles. At that point stands a shed labelled by some humorist "The
London Stores," and known the countryside round, without a smile,
by that name. There our leviathan nosed a cautious way into and
along a twelve-mile thoroughfare which, as the showmen used to say,
has to be seen to be appreciated. At present it ends at Spaulls' on
the Wonnangatta, but it is eventually to reach Talbotville on the
Crooked River, and, possibly, some day, even far-off Harrietville.
Once committed to it, there was no withdrawing. It was much too
narrow for turning, or for passing another conveyance, and fresh in
our memories was Dargo's prediction: "You'll never get round the
corners."</p>

<p>We did; but there was no margin. Confidence in our driver meant
much when we found ourselves, as at Gibraltar, the loftiest point,
looking over the edge of the car almost straight down for nearly a
thousand feet to where the river hurried along its shingly bed. At
the inner edge we could touch the rock face by stretching out a
hand; the "flower in the crannied wall" swept our hats as we
passed, and we had to stoop to escape the pendant branches of the
gums. Beautiful and picturesque and wild was the outlook. A
clearing or two smiled up at us from the river flats; otherwise all
seemed primeval forest. On the far side</p>

<p class="pin10">"The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay<br>
Chin upon hand,"</p>

<p>while over their crowns, at certain favoured spots, looked in
the big mountains.</p>

<p>The surface is good as far as Spaulls'; in a few months the good
going will be extended another wonderful mile or two; later it will
touch Talbotville, nine miles ahead, where now no wheeled vehicle
can go.</p>

<p>At Spaulls', if you are for Wellington, you mount your horse or
pick up your swag and start off on foot. It is worth while calling
at Talbotville. The population is seven, all told, and the
storekeeper, who has seen the mining-fields of the district fall
away to nothing, claims with truth that he owns two townships. A
ridge between the Crooked River and the Wongungarra prepares you
for sterner things. The next ridge, separating the Wongungarra from
the Wonnangatta, rises interminably, but over it, too, you must
pass, for your route is up part of that blazed trail which hugs the
latter river for twenty miles before ascending the zigzags of Mount
Howitt to reach Mansfield.</p>

<p>Now you are on the very outskirts of settlement. Eaglevale
Station, deserted years ago, and at present standing in a yellow
field of that "greatest landowner in the north-east," St. John's
wort, is about to be experimented with by a returned soldier. A
couple of miles farther up is the home of Mr. Harry Smith, who has
lived there for forty years, and after that&mdash;the wilderness.
At six or seven miles the Moroka brings its load of waters in from
Wellington to swell the Wonnangatta, and, as we reached the
junction, a leatherhead, sitting on a tall tree, seemed to call,
"Moroka! Moroka!" The route up the tributary is shown on the old
mining maps as the Tamboritha track; rather less than twenty miles
of its up-grade brings you to an obscure turn to the left along a
thickly timbered ridge. Here is real trouble, for the trail
vanishes. With a guide we passed safely, lunched on Knock Up,
crossed Pretty Boy (a little snow-plain) and came out on top of
Wellington, some five miles from Miller's hut (which is used only
when mustering the cattle), and at the far end from the famous
lake.</p>

<p>On top, as I have said, there is much to see; spare at least
three days for it, and, if you would know solitude, spend a night
by the edge of the mountain tarn Tarli Karng. The way is hard to
all these out of the way places, but the reward is great if one of
them is Wellington.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>THE SECRET LAKE</h2>

<p>The black men called it Tarli Karngo Nigothuruka&mdash;the
little lake of Nigothuruk. Even to them it was a creature of
mystery, so seldom seen that few of the generation which greeted
the coming of the European knew it as other than legend. So high
does it hang in the encompassing hills that it may be likened to a
cup of jade in the hands of a giant, but no helpless young thing of
the wild was ever hidden by its anxious mother with more jealous
care. It is Nature's love-child, secretly conceived and cunningly
concealed that none save the shy bush creatures should ever
discover it.</p>

<p>To this end the Great Gippsland forests stretch their dense
masses on every side of the parent hill, now known as Mount
Wellington, and break in green waves against its huge buttresses
and rocky walls. They pour over the top, and cover each sheltered
portion of the wide, undulating tableland, their trees growing tall
and strong, and standing close-ranked where the springs of the
uplands have cut protective valleys, and dwindling to stunted
growths and solitary bushes where the winds get free play, and the
winter snows lie deep. To this end were devised the mighty
watercourses which compass the mount as a moat protects its castle,
their active streams still digging the thousand feet gorges deeper
and ever deeper. And to this end was Tarli Karng placed 3,000 feet
above the plains, and 2,000 feet below the levels of the
summit.</p>

<p>From that summit the views are noble and expansive. Wellington
stands like a sentinel at the outpost, marking the end of the
alpine system of Victoria. Beneath, on the one hand, stretch the
flat lands, stippled with townships&mdash;Maffra, and many more.
Beyond them the eye travels to the distant beaches of Lake
Wellington, its wide expanse faintly blue on a sunny day. On the
other sides are mountains, and still more mountains, huge bulks of
varied shape, out of which spring the beautiful rivers which water
Gippsland before joining the great series of lakes. All Victoria
seems placed under observation; only does the mountain's own quiet
pool escape notice. From but a few points is it possible to catch a
glimpse of the waters, and one may picture the incredulity of the
first man, hunting down an ordinary gully, and stumbling on this
wonder.</p>

<p>There is no royal road from the habitable lands to where Tarli
Karng rests in the bosom of the hills as a child on the breast of
its mother. The winding and elusive cattle-pad follows an Avon
River the like of which Shakespeare never dreamed, and, gaining
altitude in its passage over Ben Cruachan, wanders along high
ridges until it attacks the steep slopes of the Gable End, a rocky
scarp of Wellington. Up this it pushes in a breathless zig-zag to
end on a grassy flat that is the top. It is nectar to drink of the
little creek which is so busy just there, and very heaven to
stretch out, close to the sky, and gaze like a god upon the common
earth spread far beneath. The summit is a large irregular plateau
rising to the pinnacle on which that industrious person the
scientist has set a cairn of stones nearly 6,000 feet above sea
level, and, falling in the very heart of the hill, the 2,000 feet
to the surface of the lake.</p>

<p>The walls of its basin are steep and shingly, and they slide
sharply down and down until they vanish in the deeps. A tiny trout,
peculiar to this water, moves in schools in what should be the
shallows, and snakes guard every yard of the rocky edge and show
little fear of man. The slopes are wooded all the way, except where
a practically unceasing landslide a few yards wide prevents every
growth. Dancing and sparkling with more elan than ever the waters
possessed at Lodore, a healthy creek comes hurrying out of a gully
at one end, the only restless thing in all that abode of Peace. In
what far-off age did the monstrous barrier at the other end fall
into place? Did the white feet of a glacier steal down the slope
the while she dropped slowly, but with Nature's infinite patience,
her load of stones across the waterway? Or did there come a night
when there was a noise like the clash of worlds, and the
overhanging cliff fell in thunder from its place and choked the
valley for ever? Before this barrier the gathered waters are 150
feet deep; behind it drops the original creek bed, with a stream
which is the leakage of the rocky bar, set about with "fragments of
an earlier world." In times of heavy rain the surface of the
barrier must be awash, but this has not been so often as to prevent
the silver wattle from covering it with dense thickets, or to
despoil it of the slowly gathered soil in which they stand
rooted.</p>

<p>To swim in that twenty acres of reflections is to discover new
sensations. So must a mite feel floating in a stately jar of
crystal. To gaze upward is to know oneself suspended in mid-air; to
think downwards is to feel some spawn of the Kraken, some forgotten
monster of the past, reaching blindly up to draw the intruder for
ever from the dear light of day.</p>

<p>Night and mystery come to the valley hand in hand. The sun is
early lost, and the dusk falls soon. Outside the shifting radius of
light given out by a camp-fire flickering on the liliputian delta
of a baby stream, the dark mass of the hillside showed fitfully,
stepping forward with menace when the blaze brightened up, retiring
as the blaze fell, but ever seeming to oppose retreat. In front
gleamed the water, full of stars, full of glamour, a faery lake
from which an arm might brandish Excalibur, or the dread bunyip
arise. The Cross rested like a decoration upon the shoulder of the
opposing cliff, and was doubled on the bosom of the lake; overhead
strode Orion, coming from the east on his eternal quest of the
Pleiades, Sirius burned with unexampled brilliancy in his wake. The
peace was not of earth; never a sound broke the quiet, until, in
perfect keeping with the spirit of that lonely place, a boobook
raised his melancholy voice, and none answered him. Sleep came
"dropping slow" on such a night, but at last the edge of wonder was
dulled and the drugged eyes closed. The guardians did not slumber.
At the darkest hour a harsh call came from overhead. "Ah-ah,
ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah!" it said, and all was still again.</p>

<p>Morning was a different tale. No finer bird chorus ever greeted
the day than is heard from the trees and shrubs round Tarli Karng.
And when the sun showed, round and jolly, in the cleft of the
eastern valley, and a little breeze ran trailing its toes across
the water to the sound of a gentle lapping, nothing remained but a
sense of the joy of living and of living in this holy spot.</p>

<p class="pin10">"The world forgetting, by the world forgot."</p>

<h3>ABORIGINAL LEGEND OF THE ORIGIN OF LAKE TARLI KARNG.</h3>

<p class="cp">[I am indebted to Mr. W. F. Waters for the
following.]</p>

<p>"Many, many moons ago, so many that they could not be counted on
the fingers and toes of all the Warrigals in Gippsland, a hunting
party from the Bundaurut Tribe, whose territory lay in the
watershed of the Macallister and its tributaries, were hunting on
the slopes of Nap Nap Marra (Mount Wellington), when they found in
a gully near the source of the waters, a lump of yellow stone which
they highly prized, and which we know as gold. This valued stone up
till then had been found only in pieces ranging in size from that
of the tip joint of a possum's tail to lumps as large as the foot
of a big wombat. It was customary to hammer these lumps into a
disk, then to pierce a hole in the middle, and by hammering to
enlarge the hole until a man's hand could be slipped through it and
the circlet or bangle of gold worn on the arm. These bangles were
highly prized, as in exchange for one of them, a man could obtain
four plain looking gins, two good looking ones or one real beauty.
Sentiment was seldom allowed to stand in the way of a good
bargain.</p>

<p>"The joy of the tribe at finding this huge lump of the precious
stone therefore knew no bounds. At a gathering of the tribesmen to
discuss the removal of the stone, some feared to carry it off lest
the vengeance of the 'Debbil Debbil' should fall on them, but other
counsels prevailed, and it was eventually decided to carry it off
at all costs.</p>

<p>"Winter had set in, and the ranges were covered with a mantle of
snow, so nothing could be done for a time, but when the suns had
melted the snows on Nap Nap Marra, and the floods in Nigothoruk had
abated, camp was secretly shifted to within half a day's journey of
the stone.</p>

<p>"On the night before the stone was to be carried off, a great
corroboree was held and at dawn next day the joyous tribe set out
with the intention of bringing in the stone to the camp.</p>

<p>"It was so heavy that seven men had great difficulty in carrying
it. It was not large enough for more men to help in the carrying,
but all helped in turn.</p>

<p>"Progress was slow, and it became evident that camp would not be
reached that night, and when the rumblings of distant thunder gave
warning of a stormy night, the old men, the women and the children
were sent on to the camp to the shelter of their wurleys, the
able-bodied men deciding to camp with the stone in the valley where
night found them, and to reach the camp of the tribe next day.</p>

<p>"Night brought with it torrents of rain, accompanied by thunder
and lightning, and as the hours passed, the storm became worse.
Never in the memory of the oldest man in the tribe had there ever
been such a storm.</p>

<p>"At times above the howl of the wind and the crash of falling
trees, the wails of the frightened women and children could be
heard declaring that the Debbil Debbil was angry and was about to
punish them.</p>

<p>"At the height of the storm, a vivid flash of lightning struck
the camp. It was followed by deep rumbling sounds, and the earth
quivered.</p>

<p>"Only three young gins survived, and when the first streaks of
dawn revealed the desolate camp and their dead companions, they
fled to find the men camped with the stone to tell them the news of
the disaster to their tribe.</p>

<p>"When they reached a high point overlooking the place in the
valley where the men had been camped the night before, they saw to
their horror that part of the mountain's top had slid into the
creek, and had buried men and stone together under a mighty mass of
rocks.</p>

<p>"In their flight from the dreaded mountain, fear lent wings to
their feet. They lived only long enough to bear the tale to a
neighbouring tribe, and so the vengeance of the Debbil Debbil was
complete.</p>

<p>"The members of that tribe immediately cast away all their gold
ornaments, fearful lest the vengeance of the Debbil Debbil should
fall on them, also, for they could see that the yellow stone was
the Debbil Debbil's own, and would carry bad luck with it. From
that time, the Bundaurut never again wore gold ornaments."</p>

<p>Thus the legend, and underneath that barrier lie the remains of
the unfortunate tribesmen, with possibly the largest nugget of gold
the world has ever seen.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>THE WAY THE MURRAY GOES</h2>

<h3>AT HOME ON THE RUBY</h3>

<p class="pin30">"Great steamers, white and gold,<br>
Go rolling down to Rio,<br>
(Roll down&mdash;roll down to Rio!);<br>
And I'd like to roll to Rio<br>
Some day before I'm old!"<br>
<br>
&mdash;Kipling.</p>

<p>The Murray has no deep-sea chanties sung by brown sailormen
along its waterways, nor has it any steamers such as "roll down,
roll down to Rio," but there is little need to apologise for it on
either count. People wise in these things tell us that the
system&mdash;the Murray and its two main tributaries&mdash;has a
total navigable length of 3,212 miles, which would make a
respectable journey even on an ocean liner, and that record is
beaten by only three other river systems in the world&mdash;the
Nile, the Amazon, and the Mississippi. As for steamers, who, once
knowing them, would exchange the homely charm, the friendliness, of
the Ruby, or the Marion, for all the gilt and glitter, the pomp and
circumstance, of those pretentious palaces which float like towns
across the seas? On them one may feel as lost and lonely as a
wanderer in a strange city; on a Murray steamer one is sure within
two days that one is part-owner. So much a partner do you feel that
you are interested in every happening, however small, however
great. You lend your moral support to the ticklish action of
steering the vessel through the narrows of a lock, and you may take
a place in the queue as the firewood for the engine is passed by
hand from the river bank to the deck.</p>

<p>Many men, many minds. It is possible to obtain a score of
individual statements of the nature of the Murray, all of them
different, all of them right. The truth is that in its long
wanderings the river suffers many changes. Go some day to Tom
Groggins, just below the high peaks and rocky gorges of the
Kosciusko range, and see what a fierce mountain torrent it can be
in its youth, obliterating its fords in sudden impetuous floodings,
cutting its way through the mountains as a saw cuts through timber.
View it later where its more even flow winds across level plains
that quiver under hot suns; watch it dive into deep forests or
spread in shallow swamps and billabongs peopled by water-birds and
lovely in their untroubled calm; feast your eye upon its occasional
cliffs of amber and old gold and red ochre and brown and white,
cliffs with often a trembling tree perched perilously upon their
sides to add still another note to the many-hued picture. Know all
these, and the much more that there is to admire and wonder about,
and you must agree that the Murray possesses a full measure of that
"continuity and change" which Stevenson declared every good river
should "labour to combine." Gone certainly is a great deal of the
wildness Sturt knew on that adventurous trip of his some ninety-six
years ago, the first excursion down the Murrumbidgee, and so to the
Murray mouth. Civilization has stepped in, with the customary
consequence that the native has stepped out. To-day much of Sturt's
journey may be accomplished by the curious in comfortable vessels,
well-found, which trade up and down for many hundreds of miles.</p>

<h3>FROM SWAN HILL TO MORGAN</h3>

<p>A favourite winter and spring trip is that from Swan Hill, in
Victoria, to Morgan, in South Australia, nearly 700 miles by river.
No more restful experience could be imagined, yet the observant eye
has always something new to engage its attention. When the merits
of this outing are fully recognized by the nerve-strained city folk
a new fleet will have to be provided. On a certain Tuesday morning
we left Melbourne shivering under a cold cloud, and joined the Ruby
where she lay by the Swan Hill bridge. In that short journey of
nine hours we found summer. The pallid cuckoo called, willows were
in leaf, the sun had power. As we sat at dinner that evening in the
saloon, with its many windows commanding or reflecting river views,
we were aware of the crew hard at work, as busy as ants, loading
goods of many kinds, wire netting for this settler, sawn timber for
that, food supplies for another, articles of every shape and kind,
all to be dropped at little settlements and lonely camps, at
wharves and sidings, somewhere in the long miles of twisting
waterfronts that lay before us. The loading continued till
midnight; at dawn we gazed from our bunks at a seemingly limitless
procession of river bank that slid past like the film of a moving
picture.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a name="image-7" id=
"image-7"></a><img alt="" src="1402831h-images/AlongTheTrack-7.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">A Red-Gum Depôt on the Murray</p>

<p>Trees! There was surely no end to them. Tall trees, squat trees,
straight trees, trees holding their branches high as if wading and
frightened to get their dresses wet, trees that leaned over till
their leaves were spread on the current&mdash;everywhere trees!
Bright waterlanes shone between the mottled trunks, for the usual
winter overflow had left placid lakes wherever the banks were low.
Hardy redgums stood knee-deep in the shallows, filling the pools
with their reflections. They floated "double, tree and shadow." One
bold fellow crowned a low bluff round which the stream swilled
strongly. He looked like a challenging sentry. We took the
challenge! The two steersmen, sweating at the great six feet wheel
on the top deck, failed to pull the boat round, and, crash! We took
aboard a big limb that smashed the iron railing round our
promenade, and bored a three-foot gap in the planking. No one was
much alarmed; the damage was high above the water line; only the
romantic could discuss shipwreck with land so close. We emerged
from the tangle with the galley chimney twisted "nor'-nor'-east by
west by south," as a keen observer remarked, and a new topic for
discussion. But settlements began to appear, higher land showed
cultivation, sheep and cattle grazed on grassy paddocks, and a
small house was passed, from which emerged a friendly family, the
children in their nightshirts, to wave to us. We tied up to the
bank, and added two goats and their kids (going all the way to
Adelaide) to our very mixed cargo. Later we pulled in to drop some
goods, again to pick up wool. Shearing was in full swing, and bales
of that rich harvest which is to bring £50,000,000 to the
Commonwealth this year were seen stacked at points of vantage in
increasing numbers. Now we wanted wood for our engines, and all
hands went ashore to play a game of "passings." A line was formed,
a log was lifted by the end man on the bank, and was passed from
hand to hand along the gangway until the last man dropped it into
place on the deck. We travelled by night as by day, our powerful
headlights fashioning a fairyland as they disclosed the sleeping
trees and their soft reflections.</p>

<h3>MILDURA AND WENTWORTH</h3>

<p>Mildura! Here we stayed for a day, and ate oranges and wondered
at this remarkable triumph of man over wild nature. Renmark later
was to be admired for the same causes, a city founded in a
wilderness. A number of other towns, smaller but thriving, were
also visited. We had long passed the point at which the
Murrumbidgee added its great body of water to the main stream. Now
we welcomed the Darling, with its load gathered as far back as
Queensland, and turned up to Wentworth to discharge most of our
cargo. Wool again, and a shearing shed in operation, where we saw
some of the 25,000 sheep being shorn. We timed one shearer&mdash;an
even four minutes from catching the sheep to turning it out
completely undressed and shivering in the fresh air. On again, the
hold now full of wool. "And still the wonder grows, how one small
boat can hold the lot she stows," in other words, where the Ruby
managed to hide the 299 bales she has aboard, to say nothing of the
miscellaneous goods and the fuel. The four goats are perched,
seemingly quite happy, on top of a pile of the cargo. Once more to
the bank, this time by an orange grove. These "golden apples of the
Hesperides" glow like lanterns among the glossy green of the
leaves. The owner was hospitable; we rejoined the ship laden with
trophies. So the record runs. Sunshine and good company, healthy
appetites and the means to satisfy them, open air and changing
scene, and a wonderful river to admire and to rejoice over, for it
waters a land which is our own.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>THREE CITY STROLLS</h2>

<h3>(a) THROUGH THE PARK</h3>

<p class="pin30">"The parks march east, the parks march west,<br>
The parks march up and down,<br>
They look like country cousins who<br>
Have newly come to town."<br>
<br>
&mdash;R. H. C.</p>

<p>It is known on the maps as Yarra Park, and if you cancel out the
Richmond embankment you can easily see why. Its main slope is to
our "ever running" river, and, slight as that slope is, I can
recall the Yarra, on a famous morning many years ago, stretching an
inquisitive arm of flood waters northward as far as the railway
bridge which spans Punt Road.</p>

<p>But it is not that lower, southern side which attracts though a
time is coming when it too will become a place of beauty. "Take the
high ground in manoeuvrin', Terence," said the sagacious Mulvaney
in Kipling's tale, and I counsel him who would see the best of this
delightful way of reaching Melbourne on foot to leave his suburban
train at the Richmond station, cross the road which at one time,
its name denotes, led to a punt, step over the stony ridge which
marches with the railway fence, skirt the Richmond Cricket Ground,
and embark on the rising track which heads for the enclosure of the
Melbourne Cricket Club.</p>

<p>But don't hurry. Just outside the Richmond Ground, peaceful
where many thousands throng, there are several residences, well
worth observing. Gums, elms, and a few oaks, sweet-flowering
pittosporum at their knees, flourish on every spot here save one
(the dry mudpuddle near Punt Road), and in these trees, last
season, I acted as spy upon no fewer than four mudlarks' nests, a
magpie's, and a wagtail's. Young mudlarks duly appeared, sitting,
absurd balls of almost shapeless fluff, perched in a row on a sunny
limb while their parents perspired (if birds can perspire these
birds did!) in their efforts to fill the ever-gaping bills. One
mudlark suggested that there was good reason for his naturally
plaintive call: he had only one leg. But he looked plump
enough.</p>

<p>The wagtail's nest was torn down one morning just as the babies
appeared. The birds are there again this year and evidently have a
nest, as yet undiscovered, for Father Wagtail chivvied (there's no
other word for it) a ludicrously unconcerned terrier as he trotted
along the path a few mornings ago. Hover, peck, chatter! Hover,
peck, chatter! went the little pugilist, seeming to ride on the
dog's back most of the time. At the end of his beat he flew back
home, probably with a fine tale to tell his wife!</p>

<p>The magpies, too, were aggressive. Foolishly, they advertised
their location by swooping at every youngster who passed. Feeding
with them for months was a solitary white cockatoo. He betrayed his
escape from the chain gang by a decided limp. The trio seemed
excellent friends. Here, too, a baby kingfisher (the sacred
kingfisher) sat high on a branch and wailed in shrill tones for
more sustenance.</p>

<p>A mixed avenue carries on past the municipal nursery garden. It
is what the country calls a "sidling" track. Above rises a soft
green hillside, well-planted, mainly with gums and wattles, though
a few Moreton Bay figs and Bunya Bunyas have crept in. One old
redgum, near the east gate of the Melbourne ground, had a limb
shorn off by lightning last year and still bears a long thin scar
circling its trunk diagonally to the ground.</p>

<p>Here is a joining of five paths. One follows round the high
embattlements of the Melbourne Cricket Ground to the pavilion
entrance, the pavilion at present giving a realistic imitation of a
war-shattered village. Another, the most seductive, so naturally to
be selected, was until lately a wholly unauthorised vagabond track,
which under official recognition is being made respectable by an
edging of stones&mdash;lumps of concrete broken out of the old
cable tram track in Wellington parade. It has no asphalt, however,
so still keeps something of its old free and easy character. It
edges off from the trim-avenued way which marches decorously under
the elms to Joli-mont station. Leaving that on the right, our path
makes for a sort of Druidical temple of ironbarks which every year
break into pale pink blossom. Every year, too, they are the haunt,
for a few months from about May onwards, of the red-wattle bird,
that hoarse, quarrelsome, but shapely bird. His voice is no
advertisement for the honey he is always feeding on!</p>

<p>Beyond these lovely gums, black-stemmed, soft-foliaged, is
another elm path. Cross it and pursue the uphill track. At the top
is one of the best groves of lemon-scented gums in the metropolitan
area. They are just now at that spotty stage which gave them their
earlier name of Maculata, but presently each will shed that spoilt
garment of bark and stand arrayed in silver. Surely no vegetable
form so closely suggests the human anatomy as do the limbs of these
Citriodoras. Wherever they junction or bend are swellings and
curves singularly like the muscles of a man's arm. The group
flourishes on the side nearest to that little island settlement,
Jolimont, so snugly tucked in, so completely cut off from any
liaison with other suburbs or even its parent city.</p>

<p>Here is the parting of the ways. The Heidelberg Railway runs
below the bridge upon which you emerge to reach Wellington Parade.
One corner across the Parade is occupied by the mansion built by
Sir W. J. Clarke, whose memorial statue by Mackennal, adorns the
north-west entrance to the Treasury Gardens half a mile further
on.</p>

<p>But the ideal way of completing this little journey is by taking
one of the many tracks of the Fitzroy Gardens, whose unfenced lawns
and avenues of elms, flower-beds gay as brocaded silks,
heaven-aspiring poplars and fascinating vistas beckon
irresistibly.</p>

<p>They are too full of varied interest, these gardens, to pass by
in a paragraph. I have dealt with them in another place (see page 6
of my preceding book, "The Open Road in Victoria.")</p>

<h3>(b) THE LEAFY WAY</h3>

<p class="pin10">"O brothers of the wind and sun,<br>
With robes of dappled light about you,<br>
Your benison's for everyone&mdash;<br>
What would the city be without you!"<br>
<br>
&mdash;R. H. C.</p>

<p>I should like some day to see a census taken of the trees of our
city. The result should be astonishing. The Alexandra Avenue alone
is a treasury of the gracious growths. Melburnians are lucky indeed
to have this in such proximity to their offices and warehouses, so
close indeed that it may serve for an after-lunch stroll.</p>

<p>Either way is good, but to gain perhaps the finest results one
should start at the Richmond end, say at the Anderson Street
bridge, for walking down-stream there is always the city ahead to
be glimpsed whenever a break in the timber allows a view. A pause
at the bridge a few mornings ago (it was certainly early, about
eight o'clock) revealed the phenomenon of a perfectly blue river,
over which hovered the finest whisp of filmy white mist.</p>

<p>Looking southward from the bridge the whole scene is enchanting.
Well in the water, at the foot of the sloping bank, a bed of
whispering reeds provides shelter for the reed warbler, a migrant
who comes here to build each spring. His note suggests the song of
the English thrush, but has a vibrant quality peculiarly its own.
Above are soft-foliaged gums, and a few of their scarlet-flowering
brethren splash colour upon the general green.</p>

<p>Move over towards Gate A of the Botanic Gardens. If the day is
warm cross the footpath way by the water, the asphalt speedway
where far too many motors are in far too great a hurry, and turn
into the covered coolness of the tan track. The horse is an animal
fast qualifying for museum purposes; you will not meet many of him
on this, his own particular path. Planes, elms, and gums in long
ordered rows tempt you back to the river-edge, but here is a tunnel
of shade formed by elms and poplars and divided from the wonders of
the Gardens by no more than the thickness of a pittosporum hedge,
through which glimpses may be gained of many lovely things.
"Brek-kek-ker-ek, Brek-kek-ker-ek," sing the small frogs in the
lawn-edged ponds, and "Co-ak, co-ak, co-o-o-ak!" comes the deep
response from the elders of the tribe.</p>

<p>Particularly do I like here the way trees lean out of the
Gardens to look up and down the Avenue and seemingly gossip with
the poplars.</p>

<p>Just where these are at their biggest, the land begins to pile
up on your left, rising, a mass of verdure, to Government House, on
the ultimate crest. Here Gate H says "Come in" with such
earnestness that none can possibly resist it. You may be stronger
than I am; at this point I find myself inside and climbing the
seductive steps, winding up and up to that delightful Temple of the
Winds which, if I remember rightly, was erected in honour of the
great landscape gardener, Guilfoyle. The only danger about doing
this is that you may want to stay for ever in this abode of ancient
quiet.</p>

<p>Be resolute, enjoy the outlook from the Temple, ranging as it
does from the Dandenongs, blue on the Eastern horizon, to the
church spires in Collins Street, and pursue your stroll. Down an
acacia-edged way, as easy, and as pleasant, as the descent to
Avernus, you come (all too soon) to Gate G, letting you out to the
bush-trail which one time ended at Brander's Ferry. (Who was
Brander, by the way, and when did he settle here?) The lindens,
which strike a new note in the avenue at this point, may be a
memory of him.</p>

<p>Orderly indeed the river bank now becomes, for close by is the
gravelled mooring spot for the houseboats of Henley, and, just
beyond the Rowing Association's War Memorial is the palm-studded
Henley lawn. You may diverge here and, by keeping the right hand
road, walk past the front of the boatsheds, but better is it to go
up the knoll to the left on which stands the singularly
unattractive memorial to Queen Victoria. With it behind you all is
well. Green slopes race down to a lily pond starred with
many-coloured blooms, and all about are charming vistas. The city
skyline from here, with St. Paul's mounting spires just across the
handsome span of Prince's Bridge, is full of interest.</p>

<p>Now to the roadway again: cross the avenue and descend to the
sunken garden which graces the spot where, just a handful of years
ago, a disorderly swamp sheltered a few wildfowl. Built-up banks,
crowned with fine trees, hide the boatsheds, and the changing
seasons are reflected in the flower beds blooming on every side.
Montfort's Peter Pan has found a happy home here.</p>

<p>And so back to the tide of traffic on St. Kilda road and again
to the world of business. What the oasis is to the Arab, this
easily accessible avenue should be to every citizen of Melbourne
who can find half an hour for the things that really matter in
life.</p>

<h3>(c) ACROSS THE TOP</h3>

<p>Oh, Melbourne town is fair to see,<br>
Go look her up and down.<br>
God made the country, certainly,<br>
But He sometimes made a town.<br>
<br>
&mdash;R. H. C.</p>

<p>Melbourne, like Rome, is scattered over a group of hills. Cut
down, built upon, altered in a thousand ways, they look to-day of
low stature,&mdash;much lower surely than they could have seemed to
those pioneers whose first view of them was from the Yarra.</p>

<p>It must be a puzzle to the new student of our City's topography
to fix the exact position of Batman's Hill, for instance. He has
plenty of evidence that it was at the west end, but he cannot know,
without research, that it was removed to make way for the Spencer
Street railway yards.</p>

<p>But coming to modern times, anyone desiring a stroll which will
give a fair idea of Melbourne's contours could not do better than
climb to the ridge called Spring Street and walk along this, the
City's topmost boundary: From Flinders Street the ascent is notable
to Collins Street. A glance down there more than hints of the fall
from Russell Street. Pass on, leaving Stanford's memorial fountain
in its green reserve on your right and immediately Peter Kerr's
great Parliament House rises up nobly above you.</p>

<p>Wasn't it Richard Steele who so gallantly said that to know his
wife was a liberal education? Well, to know the outlook from the
topmost of these great flights of steps is a liberal education in
Melbourne's foremost business thoroughfare, Bourke Street. It looks
a plain drab street compared with its parallel neighbour, Collins
Street of the Beautiful Trees, but it is interesting for other
reasons, and from this vantage point may be noted how often the
roadway rises and falls before it tops the Queen Street hill, to
slope away to Spencer Street. There is a great sense of elevation
here and the view down the terraces to the common level is
impressive. This Home of Legislation will be a striking building
indeed when the dome is added.</p>

<p>The road to which you descend splits as it goes north. At the
dividing point stands the massive bronze of Burke and Wills, those
tragic figures, whose failure made so deep an impression upon the
public mind. What does Burke see as he stands there gazing over the
busy street?&mdash;Spinifex, sand, desolation, death!</p>

<p>Keep to the left and look for a moment down the long, long
canyon of Little Bourke Street, a name forever associated with
Chinese, before reaching the head of Lonsdale Street, the best
street in Melbourne for sun on a winter's day. A row of planes
beautifies this end but ceases before the street passes down to the
hospital and the noisy trams. Spring Street is due for rebuilding
here. Small houses on the west are balanced by the ancient and
weatherworn shabbiness of the Girls' High School on the right.
Latrobe Street and Victoria Street come in, joining, and ahead is
the Exhibition building standing in good park-gardens which have
lately been improved by removal of the boundary fences. The
Exhibition dome always strikes me as too tall for its
circumference; at this near view it becomes as long and narrow as
Barbara Allen's grave in the old ballad.</p>

<p>The surroundings are charming. Plane avenues are the strong
suit, and they flourish exceedingly. One splendid individual
specimen in the eastern section would be notable anywhere.</p>

<p>Here in the pleasant shade meets daily the Al Fresco Club, one
of Melbourne's most firmly rooted institutions. Who is the oldest
member it would be hard to say; so many are very old. Every fine
day they meet to talk, like Omar, "about it and about," and
doubtless, like him, come out of the same opinion still. A group is
playing chess, another cards, yet another draughts. Each has its
ring of spectators, smoking and critically observant. Pause beside
this game of draughts. A rapid move by the thin man has resulted in
the loss by him of two pieces. He is sensitive to the mutter of the
criticism which ripples round the ring. "Bet you a deener I
couldn't!" he raps out in reply to some statement. "Haven't got a
deener, or I'd take you," comes from the critic. "But, mate,"
breaks in a long-faced, serious man, with great earnestness, "that
was a wrong move..." The retort is swift: "Bet you a bob you
couldn't have done any better!" "Huh, how many bobs have you got?"
This from the original interjector. "Two, if you want to know," is
snapped back, and silence falls again as the play proceeds.</p>

<p>Birds are numerous, and bolder than anywhere else I know. They
are so little interfered with, so accustomed to these quiet old
men, that sparrows actually hop between one's feet.</p>

<p>Move on now (slowly, slowly, for the shade is good) to the
fountain which recalls the great Exhibition. It is an elaborate
structure held up by three groaning Tritons and decorated with
figures of children, water animals (including the platypus) and
ferns.</p>

<p>Many other beautiful paths wander about this place and the
children's playground at the north end is worth a special visit. On
no account must the three fine pepper-trees on the west front be
missed as you go round to see the youngsters at play.</p>

<p>But Melbourne has many more walks to offer the stroller with
half-an-hour or half-a-day to spare. Those described here may be
taken merely as samples.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>THREE ONE-DAY WALKS</h2>

<h3>(a) RINGWOOD&mdash;BURWOOD</h3>

<p class="pin40">Or let Autumn fall on me,<br>
Where afield I linger,<br>
Silencing the bird on tree,<br>
Biting the blue finger.<br>
White as meal the frosty field,<br>
Warm the fireside haven,<br>
Not to Autumn will I yield,<br>
Not to Winter even.<br>
<br>
&mdash;R. L. S.</p>

<p>Melbourne folk are fortunate that there is so much fine material
for outings within the suburban radius, or just on its borders. The
eastern suburbs are especially favoured; the hilly country on which
they are built, and which rolls on in waves for many miles, yields
much variety of view, and provides roads which even wet weather
cannot ruin for pedestrians. It is the thoroughfare along the fiat
which becomes impassable when the siding or the road down the slope
is in good order. Drainage means all the difference. There are
numerous pleasant excursions possible on a Saturday afternoon or a
Sunday, excursions which involve no more than an hour's train
journey and a walk of two or three hours, lengthened indeed to
whatever the walker may wish, for one is never completely out of
touch with means of transit at any point.</p>

<p class="cpb">A BUSH ROAD</p>

<p>Leave the train at Ringwood, turn back along its main street
towards Melbourne, and follow the first road to the left. It dives
under the railway line, and reappears as a bush road, which
obviously can be sticky under the provocation of winter. The
pedestrian, however, can often pick a satisfactory way where wheels
would be at fault. It is at once a bush road, only partially marked
by traffic, and wearing openly little "buttonholes" of heath,
invariably white, and the pale yellow flowers of the correa or
native fuchsia. The clearings around the occasional houses are
usually backed by the bush from which they were carved. Vegetables
and fruit are grown, but most of the land is still under its
original timber. The ranges from Mount Dandenong to One Tree Hill
look very close on the left.</p>

<p>At a mile and a half Canterbury Road is crossed, here a secluded
by-way running between hedges of native trees, so different from
the bustling street of the inner suburbs that one may imagine that
it has grown old in coming so far. In another half mile of your
bush road you reach one of the many branches of the Dandenong
Creek, with more water in it than one usually associates with this
quiet stream.</p>

<p class="cpb">ALONG THE CREEK</p>

<p>To follow the course of a creek may be generally regarded as a
summer pastime. But, with the reservation made above, it may be
carried out generally with never a wet foot to show for it if your
boots are proof against the ordinary moisture of grass. There is a
track that turns down stream on the right-hand bank, that is before
you cross the bridge you make in through the fence. I do not know
if the owners of land along this creek frontage possess the soil
right down into the stream, but the fences touch the water in many
places, and their barbed wire hinders progress. There are a few
places on the Yarra where access to the river is barred by private
rights, and there are at least two portions of the shore of Port
Phillip where the beach has been sold by the Crown down to
low-water mark and where, consequently, you are a trespasser should
you attempt to pass along the sand. It is a good law which reserves
to the people a strip of land along all watercourses and beaches.
The pity is it was not made retrospective so that to-day every
stream might be "free of officious hedge or fence." This must be a
great bird haunt when warm days set the singers chanting. Quite a
number of native birds may be seen and heard, and there are flocks
of starlings feeding in the open spaces and some blackbirds
scolding in the thickets. On the road down to the creek Cootamundra
wattles may be in bloom, and at the water's edge the silver wattle
grows freely. The tea-tree's flowers are perfectly beautiful
creations whether viewed from afar or subjected to the most
searching scrutiny. Native cherry trees have green fruit hanging
among their yellow-green leaves, each little "cherry" with its
"stone" placed thoughtfully outside. Christ-mas bush, strongly
flavoured of mint, and bursaria and other shrubs are rattling their
empty seed cases and altogether there is a fine display of plant
life.</p>

<p>Here and there are tiny flats with white gums shading lush
grass. Passing higher along the hillside to avoid a chicken farm,
you emerge on the L.L. Road, about a mile to the south-east of
Vermont.</p>

<p>You may make acquaintance with some more good stretches of the
creek by going down the L.L. Road, to the bridge, crossing it, and
following along the left bank. The track is narrow and ill-defined,
but as your way is that of the water, there can be no doubt of the
direction. The banks are covered with scrub and trees, and edged
with thick fringes of maidenhair fern. Presently you reach the
Burwood Road, a hilly road which may be trying in hot weather, but
is exceedingly attractive on a fresh winter day. Each slope to the
east, as you climb it, opens out views of the big blue hills that
are worth turning round to see; each western outlook embraces a
wide stretch from the Bay past Macedon to the ranges behind
Whittlesea. A parallel ridge to the south has for its easterly end
the well-known Wheeler's Hill. On the north are some well-wooded
rises, which stand in the nearer middle-distance.</p>

<p>From the last hill but one you catch a glimpse of Burwood. The
road leads the eye down a long gradual slope to a green valley,
crossed first by Station Street and then by a branch of Gardiner's
Creek. From the bridge over the latter the way is through a cutting
with a church above it, the whole forming a picturesque scene. A
few hundred yards ahead is the terminus of the electric tram, and
you are once more within touch of the city, after an enjoyable
tramp of about nine miles.</p>

<h3>(b) BOX HILL&mdash;TALLY HO&mdash;MITCHAM</h3>

<p class="pin30">"A bird sings something in my ear,<br>
The wind sings in my blood a song<br>
'Tis good at times for a man to hear;<br>
The road winds onward, white and long,<br>
And the best of earth is here."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Arthur Symons.</p>

<p>Autumn is often "like spring returned to us won from her
girlishness," and winter likewise may reveal no terrors, at least
at week-ends, to keep a sturdy pedestrian from venturing out.
Unusually fine conditions are reflected in the behaviour of the
plants and animals. More than once in June I have seen parent birds
feeding young ones, and once in July I gathered a handful of ripe
raspberries in a hillside garden at South Sassafras. Here is a walk
for one of the short days.</p>

<p class="cpb">A LONG ROAD</p>

<p>Station Street crosses the railway line at Box Hill Station. Its
northerly career, to Doncaster and beyond, has already been
described in "The Open Road in Victoria." Southward it runs for
many a mile, with a little side-stepping and an occasional kink,
until it merges into the old Dandenong Road. It is undulating
country, with greater hills on the skyline in several directions
and its variety is endless. Half a day would serve to sample its
charms, but a full day is more than twice as good.</p>

<p>Start then on this long road, facing south. As soon as the
township thins out, and that is fairly quickly, you must admire the
easterly prospect of, first, open land, then wooded rises, backed
by the blue of the Dandenongs. The first main highway to be crossed
is the Canterbury Road on its way from the city through Vermont to
the mountains. It seems to pour down from the high hills at Mont
Albert. On the horizon ahead may be seen an elevation with a
clearing on its side, and what appears to be a dense forest on top.
It looks to be slightly to the east of your general direction. Make
that your immediate objective if you would enjoy a charming series
of views.</p>

<p class="cpb">THE HILL</p>

<p>Keep to the road. The houses become fewer and the holdings
larger. Fruit and vegetable growing appear to be the main
occupations, but there is a large acreage either being grazed or
still under timber. You come to what seems at first glance to be a
dead end, but turn sharply to the left and follow a curve to the
right and the way is clear again. It is here you may witness the
metamorphosis of Riversdale Road. Few who know that highly
respectable suburban street, with its villas and electric trams,
would recognize the road which at this point sheds its metal as a
man takes off his coat, skips down a grassy slope, runs through a
gate, dodges in and out of the bushes on a green flat and is last
seen disappearing as a careless bridle track in a grove of
pines.</p>

<p>Round the curve there is a particularly good patch of the
soft-foliaged swamp tea-tree. Due west is Wattle Park, a mass of
timber, and further to the left a glimpse may be caught of Burwood.
The various watercourses here are tributary to Gardiner's Creek,
which joins the Yarra not far from Heyington. Cross Burwood road
and continue for less than half a mile, and you are in Boundary
Road, not the north and south road of that name which runs from
Surrey Hills to Oakleigh, but an east and west namesake. It is well
up the slope of the hill you mean to climb.</p>

<p>Go two hundred yards east and enter the paddock to the right
just after crossing a fenced culvert. The first portion is cleared,
the grove of trees is on the summit. The owners, who live close by,
have had possession for forty years, and take so much pleasure from
it that it seems safe for at least another decade. There is no
scrub to break the vistas between the trunks, but the trees are
close enough together to have littered the soil with the bark and
leaves of generations and the dryness of the natural carpet, even
in Winter, is astonishing. It says much for the shelter
provided.</p>

<p class="cpb">WIDE OUTLOOK</p>

<p>But the view's the thing! From the shadows of the trees you look
out, on the one side, across a smiling landscape, to where the Bay
sparkles in the sun, the pyramids of the You Yangs standing
sentinel on the further shore. Slightly to the north the main city
buildings, dominated by those on the Eastern Hill&mdash;the
Exhibition, the Houses of Parliament, St. Patrick's
Cathedral&mdash;form a frieze of striking pattern. Further round,
Macedon salutes the eye, and as you turn you take in the whole
system of ranges from Whittlesea to Warburton, until your gaze
rests at last upon the nearer Dandenongs. Orderly fields of
vegetables; orchards showing in the mass a warm tone, despite their
want of foliage, or the distinctive yellow-green of lemon groves;
paddocks of native timber or scrub; banks of pines with houses
peeping through; roads laid down like ribbons; the clustering
houses of little hamlets; all these form part of the foreground and
middle distance. But "the wonders we know, when we put them into
words, the words seem as little like them as blackberries are like
the moon and sun."</p>

<p class="cpb">EASTWARD</p>

<p>When you decide to leave the hill (which, by the way, is about
two and a half miles from Box Hill) make east through a hedge, and
skirt a vegetable garden until it ends in bush. Drop down through
the trees and scrub, and you will find an infant creek, with a bed
of much charm. The hillside forms one bank; the other is also well
defined, and clothed with a wealth of green shrubs. Its seclusion
is that of the far back country. Follow it up to a road, cross it
and a paddock, and you emerge on the Boundary Road again. Looking
back you may view the sea; forward the outlook ends with a sight of
blue hills standing right across the way. An hotel, a post office,
and a store at a cross road indicate that you are passing Tally Ho,
and presently you will notice the red roofs of the Central Mission
Boys' Home. It stands on the brow of a hill, at the foot of which
is Springvale Road. By turning along that road to the left you may
reach Tunstall Station in three miles, so completing a very
agreeable eight and a half or nine miles for the outing. Should you
feel inclined to venture through the cutting and trace Boundary
Road still further, you will find it ends at the Dandenong Creek,
where a gate on a bridge invites you to beware of the bull. The
creek is very attractive at this point. Never have I seen such
luxuriant fringes of the delicate maidenhair fern as are growing on
its edges.</p>

<p class="cpb">ALTERNATIVE ROUTES</p>

<p>Burwood Road is the next parallel road on the north side. To
reach it from here you must break across the paddocks. Then it
turns on time and inclination as to which way you move for home. An
eccentric road, all angles, makes for Vermont, and so to Mitcham,
or you may follow the Burwood Road up past Wantirna to a junction,
where you may choose a branch to Bayswater, or another to Ringwood,
or a third to Mitcham. They are all attractive highways, cut
through the bush, and with much of its original glamour still
remaining. All through this country the skylarks are numerous,
compelling the walker to stop frequently and admire. Magpies and
butcher-birds are also plentiful, while the scarlet breasts of
robins make brave notes of colour.</p>

<h3>(c) EVELYN TO CROYDON</h3>

<p class="pin20">"Who hath desired the Sea&mdash;the sight of
salt-water unbounded?<br>
The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber
wind-hounded?<br>
Stark calm on the lap of the Line&mdash;or the crazy-eyed hurricane
blowing.<br>
His Sea in no showing the same&mdash;his Sea and the same 'neath
all showing&mdash;<br>
His Sea that his being fulfils?<br>
So and no otherwise&mdash;so and no otherwise<br>
Hill-men desire their Hills!"<br>
<br>
&mdash;Kipling.</p>

<p>I must confess to an extreme liking for the Dandenongs, that
beautiful range which breaks the horizon with its blue masses as we
look east from Melbourne. It is inverting the metaphor&mdash;but if
anyone knows of "a better 'ole" within the same distance of
Melbourne I shall be grateful to be introduced to it. Whether you
approach the Dandenongs from the Warburton line, from Lilydale,
Mooroolbark, or Croydon, from Bayswater, Ferntree Gully, or one of
the stations on the way to Gembrook, there is a varied charm which
persists through the whole year and never stales. The train yields
its first really good view of them from Mitcham, where the
elevation is sufficient to command a wide prospect, but for sheer
beauty, on the proper day, it is hard to eclipse the picture they
present from a siding near Croydon, with orchards in the foreground
and a glimpse of the higher peaks of St. Leonard, Monda, Juliet,
and Donna Buang showing to the left. A conspicuous feature of Mount
Dandenong some years ago was the landslip. It could be picked out
even from Melbourne. Now it is a mere handful of red, well up the
hillside and observable when between Mooroolbark and Lilydale and
from very few other places. Nature has almost healed the wound.</p>

<p class="cpb">VARIED GOING</p>

<p>A pleasant change from the generally accepted routes may be
found by starting from Evelyn, the first station past Lilydale on
the Warburton Line. Assume that you arrive there at noon, you can
ascend the mount and be in Croydon, Ringwood or Bayswater in ample
time for the evening train back to the city, and that without
hurrying. The train climbs 400 feet to take you from Lilydale to
Evelyn, and in doing so seems to describe a half-circle, so much do
you see of the first-named township. Looking south from Evelyn's
altitude of 738 feet, the land dips sharply through close timber,
and rises again to good effect as portion of the Mount. The range
is seen very much foreshortened, but for some reason, possibly
because this face may be more abrupt than the others, it always
seems to me higher than from any other point of view.</p>

<p>Take the road alongside the line. In a couple of hundred yards
it will lead you past a store. Turn to your right downhill; the
road makes good walking. Just above you is the O'Shannassy Channel,
with the water apparently running the wrong way in an effort to get
round the head of the valley. The scar visible on a hilltop is one
of the reservoirs of the system. A fire ran through this country in
recent enough days to have left the tree trunks and branches still
a rich black but sufficiently long ago to permit of a fresh young
growth of gum leaves. The contrast is striking and attractive.</p>

<p class="cpb">MISTLETOE BEND</p>

<p>That effect is lost when you near Olinda Creek at the bottom of
the descent. There the vegetation is lush and green, first swamp
grasses, tea-tree and dogwood, then wattles, mintbush and ferns.
Right on the creek, guarding a glade known as Mistletoe Bend, are
some tall white gums and some other big eucalypts, either messmate
or stringybark. They are almost rivalled by a few silver wattles of
exceptional growth. A prepared fireplace under the trees, and near
the running water, naturally suggests the ever-welcome subject of
lunch. It may be a bit early for a meal, for you have come little
more than a mile from the station, but the surroundings are very
pleasant, so bring for once</p>

<p class="pin10">"...the time and the place<br>
And the loved one all together!"</p>

<p>As you eat you will notice how numerous and tame the birds are.
The white-shafted fantail performs aerial gymnastics almost within
reach, resting only long enough to utter his fresh little trill of
song; not one but many yellow robins will attend to any edible
scraps that you let fall; red oriess are plentiful; blue wrens,
with their perky little wives, dart about in the crass; thrushes,
magpies and jackasses call; a breathless tree-creeper makes you
wonder how long he can keep it up; from the edge of the clearing
comes the distinctive whistle of the spinebill honeyeater; and,
dominating all, the butcher-bird blows his lovely autumn flute.</p>

<p class="cpb">"EXCELSIOR!"</p>

<p>You will leave the creek reluctantly. Cross the bridge, and take
the road along the foot of the hill for about 100 yards. If you
continued to keep it the road would convey you, pleasantly enough,
into Montrose, but that way you would miss the Mount. Follow,
rather, a bridle track which goes off to the left just past a baby
creek (practically a gutter) that crosses the road. At once you
begin to rise. There is a patch of tea-tree, but mainly the timber
is young messmate. Pink and red heath are in profusion here in
Autumn and Winter. You are on a siding with the major portion of
the hill on your right. Presently a saddle is reached, and then a
deserted house. Keep it to the right, and climb the ridge directly
behind it. There is a suggestion of a track through the heath and
trees, but in any case the going is fairly easy. Bear slightly to
the left and, shortly after crossing a dray track, and as the
outlook changes to the north-east, an old buggy road will be found
coming up the hillside. It has taken you about half an hour to
reach here from your lunching place.</p>

<p>Still the way is upward, but the character of the country has
changed. A beautiful forest of big trees decorates the slopes and
through it may be caught glimpses of distant ranges, while
treeferns strike a bright colour note not far below. The new motor
road which has been created in the locality, leads on to Five Ways
or Kalorama. Soon a fence is seen; then the highway' now a
well-used road, doubles back at a greater elevation.</p>

<p class="cpb">THE DOWNWARD PATH</p>

<p>A choice of ways is presently presented. If you take the high
road (to the left) you will join the Devil's Elbow in a very short
distance, and from there it is an easy stroll to the summit with
its "observatory" (as it is fashionable to call the old trig
station) and its really fine outlook. Less known is the righthand
way, almost a private thoroughfare in its seclusion and quiet. It
drops rapidly, but comfortably enough, until it reaches the main
Mount Dandenong Road less than a mile from Montrose, fairly at the
foot of the hill. A very fine view of Corhanwarabul (the old title
of the mount) is obtained from the store corner. There, by the way,
I noted the first Indian mynah that I have seen out of the city. It
was very much at home. Montrose is remarkable for a row of
Cootamundra wattles, which some public-spirited person has planted
along the roadside.</p>

<p class="cpb">A CHOICE OF ROUTES</p>

<p>You may walk from here to Mooroolbark in about three miles or to
Croydon, through Kilsyth, in a little over four. Or you may extend
the trip (there is plenty of time) by tracing the Norwich Road,
which runs a little south of west, until at four and a half miles
it crosses the Croydon Road. The way is pleasant, more particularly
on the flat, where fields of tasselled maize have for background
the blue hills. At Croydon Road a turn to the right will bring you
to the Croydon Railway Station after three miles of fair going; an
adherence to the original route will, after many twists and bends,
deposit you at Ringwood, a distance of two and a half miles; or
Bayswater Station may be reached in a mile by turning sharply to
the left.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>SWAGGING IT: THE WAY AND THE
WALKER</h2>

<p class="pin10">"I have often wished that Cervantes had written a
tale of his wanderings on the sunlit roads of Spain, or that
Goldsmith had told in matchless English of the days when he played
a flute for bread, or blind old Homer had left a few pages about
tramping the roads of Greece."<br>
<br>
&mdash;Beggars of Life.</p>

<p>"Romance is dead!" But not for him who woos Matilda. She leads
him along pathways of glamour, with ever a gleam shining at the far
end, and enchanting curves that call him to look round that corner
at least; she offers him tales of simple lives and lawless doings,
of how men shape their destinies who must make their own rules of
conduct; she shows him tall mountains beckoning from the blue, the
frosty sparkle of river waters glancing through green timber, seas
of amethyst that break in lazy swells of opal and silver, long grey
sands stretching to infinity.</p>

<p>Link up with her, and she will divorce you from the comforts of
home, to know the hard beds of the bush track, the moving airs of
that open bedroom whose ceiling is the sky, the plain meal cooked
at the camp-fire, the burden of swag and billy and nosebag.</p>

<p>Her lure, and your reward, is liberty, health, and a memory in
whose halls are hung imperishable pictures past the skill of man to
paint.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * * * *</p>

<p class="pin40">"Lift up your swag and follow me."</p>

<p>Up the long track we toiled, no more than inch high in the scale
of these huge hills. Everywhere they towered, Magdala and the
Square Gin Face, Tamboritha, Wellington, Kent, and the Snowy Bluff,
and as we slowly rose to the heights, the land fell away on either
side to deeps of wonder. A riot of blue ranged from the delicate
hint conveyed by frosted metal to the amazing azure of a wren's
bosom. Rarer grew the air and scarcer the timber; the flowers
changed to the long-stemmed violets, the white and purple asters,
the quaint grevilleas and golden everlastings of the uplands, but
the crest of this sheer-sided Howitt which we were climbing looked
as remote as ever.</p>

<p>Swags can be weighty though the way be very heaven, and we
carried both swag and nosebag. Pauses became more frequent, the
pace grew slower, but, one by one, at last we topped the final rise
and stood at gaze, too astonished to speak.</p>

<p>When you climb a mountain you expect to reach an outstanding
point or pinnacle. Here was something new. We had risen some six
thousand feet above the sea level, only to find a flatter world
than the one which we had left. An ant which had crawled
expectantly up a table leg might have much the same feelings on
reaching the top. Before us lay the characteristic plain of the
Victorian Alps, green in the sober tones of snowgrass, undulating,
watered by youthful streams which would shortly plunge over the
edges to dash down to the great rivers of the lowlands. Cattle
raised inquiring heads or grazed peacefully. The scene might have
been matched in numberless places but for two strange features.
Across the pasture ran a line of snow-poles, indicating the track;
over the edges of the plain, like the heads of giants seated round
a table, rose the tops of mountains, and yet more mountains.</p>

<p>The darkness came early, for the sun is soon lost among these
tall peaks. Every valley was exalted with purple mists stealing up
to welcome the night. Stars came blazing out, and the thin wind of
the heights stole abroad, searching to rob us of vitality.</p>

<p>In a hollow, where a patch of snow gums stood above a spring,
our camp-fire was soon glowing, a sword of light challenging the
dark, but what a pitiful weapon it seemed in that continent of
enveloping gloom. Daylight came in loveliness, the world was
steeped in the purity of dew, there seemed no blemish on the earth,
but near by lay Terrible Hollow, where the second act of a grim
tragedy had been played but a few years before.</p>

<p>The sweep of Howitt on the far side is to the Wonnangatta River,
a lonely stream at its upper end, visited only by the cattlemen who
lease the heights. Standing solitary in the valley is the homestead
of the station named after the river. For a generation and a half
one family lived there, lived patriarchally, tending its flocks and
herds much as was the fashion in the days of Job. A self-contained
life, knowing little contact with the world of affairs, mending its
own boots, making its own entertainment, burying its dead. The tiny
cemetery lies, pine-shadowed, not far from the house. Who could
dream of such utter seclusion, such loneliness, in our Victoria I
When food stocks ran low, the pack teams were sent out, usually
twice a year. Everything came in on the back of an animal,
everything went out on the hoof, for never a bridge spanned the
rivers. To this day no wheeled vehicle has entered that retired
domain. When the settler brought his family to their future home,
the very children were packed 'like goods, swaying in gin cases one
on each side of a steady old mare, as she picked her way over the
scrubby flats, waded the swift-flowing creeks and trod carefully
the shingly edges of the sidings.</p>

<p>But the patriarch died, his wife followed him to the tiny
God's-acre up the valley, and the station was sold. Then came the
tragedy.</p>

<p>The old home was suddenly emptied of the life and stir of a
large family, and it knew, instead, the quiet ways of a solitary
man who took possession as manager, and presently brought there
another man, as cook. A day came when both were missing.</p>

<p>What actually happened remains one of the mysteries of crime.
The nearest neighbour (twenty miles away) happened to call. His
bushman's eye picked up a strange track, and at the end of it lay
the body of his friend the manager, hidden in the brush. All too
evidently he had been killed by a gunshot at close quarters. The
cook had vanished, and so had one of the riding horses. Winter,
always early in those hills, was already powdering them with snow,
and soon all tracks were lost. Suspicion centred in the cook, and
he was searched for as a marked man. But when the snows that lie
deep and long on Mount Howitt had melted in the Spring sun, and the
pads were rideable again, they found him on the mountain top, also
shot, lying with arms outstretched near the brink of The
Hollow.</p>

<p>From the crown of Howitt, sparkling with frost even on summer
mornings, the way leads along the pads by which the Wonnangatta
station cattle are still brought to the heights each Spring, and
down which the restless lowing mob returns, after the Autumn
mustering, with the stockmen's whips cracking behind.</p>

<p>Woe betide the cattle which escape the final mustering. There is
a patch of sturdy snowgums on the Bogong High Plains (where
Victorians shall some day see a great health resort) and in it
hang, or hung when last I passed that way, the desiccated remains
of a bullock which had perished on the deep snow covering the
little sheltered grove. When the white drifts melted, the carcass
was held in the tough branches to be food for the crows, and to be
wondered at by the rare passer-by.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * * * *</p>

<p class="pin40">"Take up your swag and follow me."</p>

<p>Blazes mark the way of the walker on many of his long bush
tramps, often the blazes cut to guide the miner in the "roaring
'fifties or 'sixties," when towns of ten, twenty, or thirty
thousand people were created, seemingly in a moment, by uttering
the magic word "Gold." Those were the "rushes" of which we hear
nothing now. But the wanderers from beaten paths, and the men who
cannot resist</p>

<p class="pin10">"The little vagrant woodland way,<br>
Grey-ribboned through the green,"</p>

<p>find to-day, miles from any habitation, a strange clearing here
and there, with gooseberry bushes struggling through the bracken,
spears of foxgloves shining amongst the scrub, saplings of twenty
years' growth hiding the mouths of old shafts, and, maybe, a row of
ruined houses, mere empty shells that once were filled with
life.</p>

<p>Take the township of Grant. Its name still lingers on all the
maps of Victoria. In the 'sixties it boasted more hotels than a
Melbourne suburb of to-day. Now, not one human being resides where
all the busy thousands toiled so feverishly, the many to dig yellow
gold from the earth, the others to take it from them. Grant lies on
the edge of the High Plains that reach down to Dargo and join up
with the Alpine system above Harrietville. Two houses remain. One
is used as a storeroom by the shopkeeper at Talbotville, a
settlement of nine inhabitants some seven miles further in, for
here at Grant the vehicular road ends, and sleds or the packhorse
must be used for the rest of the journey. The other was once a
substantial hotel.</p>

<p>Coming from the Wonnangatta some ten years ago, some walkers
found a solitary woman holding a roadside licence and keeping this
ancient hostelry open. She was the entire township; not another
soul lived within seven miles. Her hope lay in the mine which was
then being worked on the Crooked River, for the miners coming in
and out must pass her door. There was a choice of two
drinks&mdash;bottled beer and raspberry vinegar.</p>

<p>"Try them mixed!" was the landlady's advice. She was
postmistress, too, hanging precariously to that job, for it
entailed the handling of a certain number of letters each month to
keep the office open. Naïvely, she confessed to writing most of
them herself. The party helped that month's mail to the extent of
one postcard, all it possessed, which was posted six times, once
for each member, down the tin funnel used as a letter slot. The
winter there is stern and hard. Snows lie deep and long on those
high plains, and the passers-by must have been about as common as
the bullock dray in Bourke Street. In late Autumn she would fill
one of the rooms with wood, lay in a stock of provisions, and
hibernate almost completely.</p>

<p>The walkers marvelled as they left her, standing all alone in
the old doorway, a miracle of contentment, another of those
astonishing variations from the normal which the tramper in the
remote bush is ever discovering.</p>

<p>The back country is full of "hatters," though it is not often
that one meets a woman qualified for that title. Nowhere are these
quaint old figures&mdash;they are always old and frequently
odd&mdash;so numerous as on the edges of the abandoned goldfields.
Human flotsam, most of them, left on the beach when the tide of
prosperity receded. Some are men who have known the culture of
great schools and universities, the life of towns, the love of art
and letters. What do they dream of now, as the days march past and
the night shadows compass them round. It needs a well-balanced mind
to live like this, apart from one's kind, and retain complete
sanity. In speech or idea or habit they betray, often enough, that
the solitude has had its effect.</p>

<p>Most of these men are, at the worst, no more than a trifle
eccentric, and hospitality, within their means, is a matter of
course with them. Two city youths drifted in on one old chap in the
hills just at lunch-time. They rather upset the regularity of his
habits. Every Sunday he made a big plum duff to last him the week.
The visitors called on a Tuesday; the duff was excellent; they had
eaten it up to Friday before they left!</p>

<p>The old-age pension has been a gift of the gods to the
"hatters." With that, a weather-proof hut, a little garden of
vegetables and a few goats, they are secure against want. They make
their regular trips to the township for tea and sugar and flour and
a bit of tobacco, and to collect the pension, and perhaps have "one
at eleven." Then it happens that a month comes when the familiar
old figure fails to appear, and the postmaster, or the storekeeper,
sends word to the trooper at the bigger township&mdash;some twenty
miles further away&mdash;and he rides out and brings in for burial
all that remains of a man, whether prince or pensioner, after Death
has been busy with him.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * * * *</p>

<p class="pin40">"Take up your swag and follow me."</p>

<p>"It's a long while ago," said the old bushman. He shook his head
thoughtfully. "A long while ago," he repeated. With hands as hard
as iron he rolled a pipeful of tobacco, then pressed it home with
expert finger. Eighty-five, he said he was, but still he was
upright in walking, and veritably part of a horse when mounted. As
he leaned forward, the firelight showed a grizzled beard and
longish grey hair straggling from under his ancient hat. He picked
up a burning stick and held it to his pipe. The flame rose and fell
as he pulled at the smouldering briar. Carefully he laid his
"bushman's match" down again in the fireplace where its end would
just keep alight.</p>

<p>Behind him trooped the shadows, stealing from the back of the
hut when the flame fell, darting to cover as a fresh log caught,
dancing on the rough walls and the rude beams of the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Forty-five years since I come here, and I was over at the Point
before that. There was some gold gettin' in Woods' Point in them
days. I see a paddock of alluvial cleaned up once; it was a bit o'
ground, say fourteen by thirty by twenty-six on the B.B. Creek, and
it turned out 260 ounces. An' gold was worth four pounds an ounce.
I was at Matlock when they got a nugget 155 ounces and another 105.
Bill the Smelter made a lot o' money there. He went to the old
country about 1865, for a twelvemonth, and when he come back he
told me he was £25,000 better off through his shares in them mines.
Why, in the 'sixties there was fifty-one companies working in
Woods' Point. The <i>Morning Star</i> paid about £120,000 in
dividends in my time. They used to say that over a million pounds'
worth o' gold come out of that <i>Morning Star</i> hill.</p>

<p>"No, there's blamed little doing there now. I did hear that
there's not more'n a hundred and fifty people left in Woods' Point
and about a dozen in Matlock.</p>

<p>"An' look at Walhalla. It was quite a big place once. We called
it Stringer's Creek in them days, after Ned Stringer. He died in
'63. The rush come mainly from the Point and the Jordan an'
Donnelly's. Nobody at all now at Donnelly's, an' precious few I
believe at the Jordan. There's Toombon, too, as empty as if nobody
had never been there, and they tell me the battery and the houses
are still standing, and the furniture all laying about. It's safe
enough; nobody's goin' to pack the stuff out from a place like
that, and there ain't any other way.</p>

<p>"But I been on cattle for most o' my time...Lonely? No! I had a
neighbour down at the Two Mile once. He cleared out about twenty
years ago...Yes, I been to Melbourne. I was born there. But I ain't
been back much since...Y'll have a mug o' tea before you
go?...Well, so long!"</p>

<p>And the old back straightens as we file out into the darkness,
and he turns to his solitary bed.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * * * *</p>

<p class="pin40">"Hark to the Bush a-calling!"</p>

<p>The swagman's way is the bird's way and the wind's way. He may
go where he will, where no vehicle, no horse even, may follow. He
can know all the joy, amounting to that of a discoverer, of
following lost trails and penetrating secret places. "The tracks
run east, the tracks run west, the tracks run every way." They scar
the sides of wild hills, or wind across their wooded tops, dipping
to rivers with never a bridge in a hundred miles, or climbing so
high that the sole guide is the line of ancient, moss-covered
snow-poles. They are the only routes through much of the back
country, and they are kept open by the passage of the cattle and
the stockmen. Along the coast, too, they wind, crossing
river-mouths bar-bound for nine months in the year, twisting in
through tea-tree and honeysuckle and manna gums, to end in some
solitary lighthouse or long-abandoned selection.</p>

<p>Take the long track to Everard, that Cape Everard which was the
first piece of Australia seen by Captain Cook. It boasts a
lighthouse more lonely than most. It is the last before you come to
Cape Howe, and so pass out from Victoria. Thirty bad bush miles
from the nearest house, with no telegraph wire nearer than a
station ninety miles away, it held, a few years ago, a reputation
for absolute peace that made it not unpopular with the men of the
service. Ships that pass in the night do so too far out for
signals..."there's nothing to be done after dark," said the keeper
comfortably.</p>

<p>With swags up, a party attacked Everard from Lakes Entrance.
Dingoes might be seen, someone had remarked. First night out the
botanist woke to the consciousness of a warm breath sweeping his
cheek, then reposing in the hood of his sleeping bag. A dog of some
sort, probably dingo or fox, as the tracks next morning showed.</p>

<p>"Seeing Jingolong?" called a woman, riding astride in a pair of
old trousers, tucked into men's stockings. At a glance she had
classified the party as city swagmen. The rabbit-trapper's wife
bade the trampers welcome to her hut, and discovered herself a
Malaprop. "No, mister," she declared, throwing some wheat to the
fowls which shared the living-room, "none of my chickens will ever
die for want of neglect!" Her clock was, like Mark Twain's,
obviously several days slow. "Don't take any notice of that old
thing," she urged earnestly. "Our good one's at the blacksmith's
gettin' mended. He's 'ad it for months. Said he'd forgot about it
the last time Steve went in. Me 'usband's too soft. Wait till I see
the blacksmith; I'll jog 'is memory!" Under the tall green timber,
in whose tangled tops the stars shone, the walkers learnt one night
that the bush is haunted. It was a bird singing, not a nightingale,
nor the mopoke, but <i>ninox strenua</i>, the eagle owl. He began
with an imitation of what might be a wool sale in Hell or
pencillers calling the odds at the Tophet Cup. When his wife joined
in, she supplied the shrieks of torment that might be supposed to
rise from the eternally damned. The duet was appalling&mdash;to be
laughed over in daylight, but hair-raising to men newly wakened
from sleep. Two other weird calls had stirred imagination&mdash;the
scream of a petulant Koala in the dusk, and the long-drawn wail of
a stone-plover which suddenly rose at close quarters after night
had fallen&mdash;but neither knew that shrilling agony which
vibrated in the voice of the great owl.</p>

<p>The way was through great forests of mahogany gums. Every river
crossing was a wonderful display of plant life. Old man's beard
hung in silver masses from the clematis vines, and the glorious
scarlet of the Victorian Waratah burned against a dark-green
background. Bell birds rehearsed the anvil chorus everywhere there
was water. A horseman, one of the keepers from the far-off
lighthouse, paused to tell the gossip of the tracks, and cheerfully
joined in a laugh against himself. He had had to strip and swim,
hanging to his steed, every river up to the Bemm. There he had
piled his clothes on the horse, mounted as nude as Lady Godiva, and
ridden into the stream. It looked black and deep, but it didn't
rise higher than a couple of feet on the horse's legs. The morning
was cold and frosty: he said he would test the next stream before
undressing.</p>

<p>At Everard lighthouse was the welcome of the way-back. There is
nothing better in the world. A kid was slain from the flock of
goats, scones were baked, high carnival was held by the three
families who shared this outpost. The arrival of strangers meant
much to them in their seclusion. But it was <i>ave atque vale</i>,
which has been translated as "tip and run." The return was
commenced within thirty-six hours, a return which was a liberal
education in sandy beaches, bar-bound river mouths, coastal scrubs
and rocky headlands. Dingoes were met face to face on the sea edge;
oysters, even better than "Sydney rocks," were discovered in the
pools; crayfish were enticed from their crevices into billies, to
reappear, hot and blushing, at tea-time.</p>

<p>Lean, brown, fit, the swagmen caught the boat at Lakes Entrance
for Sale. And, as they swung up the street of that pleasant little
town, a farmer, driving past, pulled up his team with a jerk. "Want
a job?" he yelled, and seemed disappointed at the reply.</p>

<p>Would you become acquainted with the equine mind and learn to
respect the packhorse, to appreciate his wisdom when he is wise,
and practise control when he insists upon jamming his load between
trees, hanging back on the upgrade, treading on your heels on the

ecstatic note of the lyre bird dancing on his mound, to gaze with
wonder upon the million millions of the Bogong moth in its evening
