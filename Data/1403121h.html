<h2><a id="I" name="I"></a>I. THE ANGEL CHILD</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>ALTHOUGH Whilomville was in no sense a summer resort, the advent
of the warm season meant much to it, for then came visitors from
the city&mdash;people of considerable confidence&mdash;alighting
upon their country cousins. Moreover, many citizens who could
afford to do so escaped at this time to the sea-side. The town,
with the commercial life quite taken out of it, drawled and drowsed
through long months, during which nothing was worse than the white
dust which arose behind every vehicle at blinding noon, and nothing
was finer than the cool sheen of the hose sprays over the cropped
lawns under the many maples in the twilight.</p>

<p>One summer the Trescotts had a visitation. Mrs. Trescott owned a
cousin who was a painter of high degree. I had almost said that he
was of national reputation, but, come to think of it, it is better
to say that almost everybody in the United States who knew about
art and its travail knew about him. He had picked out a wife, and
naturally, looking at him, one wondered how he had done it. She was
quick, beautiful, imperious, while he was quiet, slow, and misty.
She was a veritable queen of health, while he, apparently, was of a
most brittle constitution. When he played tennis, particularly, he
looked every minute as if he were going to break.</p>

<p>They lived in New York, in awesome apartments wherein Japan and
Persia, and indeed all the world, confounded the observer. At the
end was a cathedral-like studio. They had one child. Perhaps it
would be better to say that they had one CHILD. It was a girl. When
she came to Whilomville with her parents, it was patent that she
had an inexhaustible store of white frocks, and that her voice was
high and commanding. These things the town knew quickly. Other
things it was doomed to discover by a process.</p>

<p>Her effect upon the children of the Trescott neighborhood was
singular. They at first feared, then admired, then embraced. In two
days she was a Begum. All day long her voice could be heard
directing, drilling, and compelling those free-born children; and
to say that they felt oppression would be wrong, for they really
fought for records of loyal obedience.</p>

<p>All went well until one day was her birthday.</p>

<p>On the morning of this day she walked out into the Trescott
garden and said to her father, confidently, "Papa, give me some
money, because this is my birthday."</p>

<p>He looked dreamily up from his easel. "Your birthday?" he
murmured. Her envisioned father was never energetic enough to be
irritable unless some one broke through into that place where he
lived with the desires of his life. But neither wife nor child ever
heeded or even understood the temperamental values, and so some
part of him had grown hardened to their inroads. "Money?" he said.
"Here." He handed her a five-dollar bill. It was that he did not at
all understand the nature of a five-dollar bill. He was deaf to it.
He had it; he gave it; that was all.</p>

<p>She sallied forth to a waiting people&mdash;Jimmie Trescott, Dan
Earl, Ella Earl, the Margate twins, the three Phelps children, and
others. "I've got some pennies now," she cried, waving the bill,
"and I am going to buy some candy." They were deeply stirred by
this announcement. Most children are penniless three hundred days
in the year, and to another possessing five pennies they pay
deference. To little Cora waving a bright green note these children
paid heathenish homage. In some disorder they thronged after her to
a small shop on Bridge Street hill. First of all came ice-cream.
Seated in the comic little back parlor, they clamored shrilly over
plates of various flavors, and the shopkeeper marvelled that cream
could vanish so quickly down throats that seemed wide open, always,
for the making of excited screams.</p>

<p>These children represented the families of most excellent
people. They were all born in whatever purple there was to be had
in the vicinity of Whilomville. The Margate twins, for example,
were out-and-out prize-winners. With their long golden curls and
their countenances of similar vacuity, they shone upon the front
bench of all Sunday-school functions, hand in hand, while their
uplifted mother felt about her the envy of a hundred other parents,
and less heavenly children scoffed from near the door.</p>

<p>Then there was little Dan Earl, probably the nicest boy in the
world, gentle, fine-grained, obedient to the point where he obeyed
anybody. Jimmie Trescott himself was, indeed, the only child who
was at all versed in villany, but in these particular days he was
on his very good behavior. As a matter of fact, he was in love. The
beauty of his regal little cousin had stolen his manly heart.</p>

<p>Yes, they were all most excellent children, but, loosened upon
this candy-shop with five dollars, they resembled, in a tiny way,
drunken revelling soldiers within the walls of a stormed city. Upon
the heels of ice-cream and cake came chocolate mice, butter-scotch,
"everlastings," chocolate cigars, taffy-on-a-stick,
taffy-on-a-slate-pencil, and many semi-transparent devices
resembling lions, tigers, elephants, horses, cats, dogs, cows,
sheep, tables, chairs, engines (both railway and for the fighting
of fire), soldiers, fine ladies, odd-looking men, clocks, watches,
revolvers, rabbits, and bedsteads. A cent was the price of a single
wonder.</p>

<p>Some of the children, going quite daft, soon had thought to make
fight over the spoils, but their queen ruled with an iron grip. Her
first inspiration was to satisfy her own fancies, but as soon as
that was done she mingled prodigality with a fine justice,
dividing, balancing, bestowing, and sometimes taking away from
somebody even that which he had.</p>

<p>It was an orgy. In thirty-five minutes those respectable
children looked as if they had been dragged at the tail of a
chariot. The sacred Margate twins, blinking and grunting, wished to
take seat upon the floor, and even the most durable Jimmie Trescott
found occasion to lean against the counter, wearing at the time a
solemn and abstracted air, as if he expected something to happen to
him shortly.</p>

<p>Of course their belief had been in an unlimited capacity, but
they found there was an end. The shopkeeper handed the queen her
change.</p>

<p>"Two seventy-three from five leaves two twenty-seven, Miss
Cora," he said, looking upon her with admiration.</p>

<p>She turned swiftly to her clan. "O-oh!" she cried, in amazement.
"Look how much I have left!" They gazed at the coins in her palm.
They knew then that it was not their capacities which were endless;
it was the five dollars.</p>

<p>The queen led the way to the street. "We must think up some way
of spending more money," she said, frowning. They stood in silence,
awaiting her further speech.</p>

<p>Suddenly she clapped her hands and screamed with delight. "Come
on!" she cried. "I know what let's do." Now behold, she had
discovered the red and white pole in front of the shop of one
William Neeltje, a barber by trade.</p>

<p>It becomes necessary to say a few words concerning Neeltje. He
was new to the town. He had come and opened a dusty little shop on
dusty Bridge Street hill, and although the neighborhood knew from
the courier winds that his diet was mainly cabbage, they were
satisfied with that meagre data. Of course Riefsnyder came to
investigate him for the local Barbers' Union, but he found in him
only sweetness and light, with a willingness to charge any price at
all for a shave or a haircut. In fact, the advent of Neeltje would
have made barely a ripple upon the placid bosom of Whilomville if
it were not that his name was Neeltje.</p>

<p>At first the people looked at his sign-board out of the eye
corner, and wondered lazily why any one should bear the name of
Neeltje; but as time went on, men spoke to other men, saying, "How
do you pronounce the name of that barber up there on Bridge Street
hill?" And then, before any could prevent it, the best minds of the
town were splintering their lances against William Neeltje's
sign-board. If a man had a mental superior, he guided him
seductively to this name, and watched with glee his wrecking. The
clergy of the town even entered the lists. There was one among them
who had taken a collegiate prize in Syriac, as well as in several
less opaque languages, and the other clergymen&mdash;at one of
their weekly meetings&mdash;sought to betray him into this ambush.
He pronounced the name correctly, but that mattered little, since
none of them knew whether he did or did not; and so they took
triumph according to their ignorance. Under these arduous
circumstances it was certain that the town should look for a
nickname, and at this time the nickname was in process of
formation. So William Neeltje lived on with his secret, smiling
foolishly towards the world.</p>

<p>"Come on," cried little Cora. "Let's all get our hair cut.
That's what let's do. Let's all get our hair cut! Come on! Come on!
Come on!" The others were carried off their feet by the fury of
this assault. To get their hair cut! What joy! Little did they know
if this were fun; they only knew that their small leader said it
was fun. Chocolate-stained but confident, the band marched into
William Neeltje's barber shop.</p>

<p>"We wish to get our hair cut," said little Cora, haughtily.</p>

<p>Neeltje, in his shirt-sleeves, stood looking at them with his
half-idiot smile.</p>

<p>"Hurry, now!" commanded the queen. A dray-horse toiled step by
step, step by step, up Bridge Street hill; a far woman's voice
arose; there could be heard the ceaseless hammers of shingling
carpenters; all was summer peace. "Come on, now. Who's goin' first?
Come on, Ella; you go first. Gettin' our hair cut! Oh what
fun!"</p>

<p>Little Ella Earl would not, however, be first in the chair. She
was drawn towards it by a singular fascination, but at the same
time she was afraid of it, and so she hung back, saying: "No! You
go first! No! You go first!" The question was precipitated by the
twins and one of the Phelps children. They made simultaneous rush
for the chair, and screamed and kicked, each pair preventing the
third child. The queen entered this m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, and decided
in favor of the Phelps boy. He ascended the chair. Thereat an awed
silence fell upon the band. And always William Neeltje smiled
fatuously.</p>

<p>He tucked a cloth in the neck of the Phelps boy, and taking
scissors, began to cut his hair. The group of children came closer
and closer. Even the queen was deeply moved. "Does it hurt any?"
she asked, in a wee voice.</p>

<p>"Naw," said the Phelps boy, with dignity. "Anyhow, I've had m'
hair cut afore."</p>

<p>When he appeared to them looking very soldierly with his cropped
little head, there was a tumult over the chair. The Margate twins
howled; Jimmie Trescott was kicking them on the shins. It was a
fight.</p>

<p>But the twins could not prevail, being the smallest of all the
children. The queen herself took the chair, and ordered Neeltje as
if he were a lady's-maid. To the floor there fell proud ringlets,
blazing even there in their humiliation with a full fine bronze
light. Then Jimmie Trescott, then Ella Earl (two long ash-colored
plaits), then a Phelps girl, then another Phelps girl; and so on
from head to head. The ceremony received unexpected check when the
turn came to Dan Earl. This lad, usually docile to any rein, had
suddenly grown mulishly obstinate. No, he would not, he would not.
He himself did not seem to know why he refused to have his hair
cut, but, despite the shrill derision of the company, he remained
obdurate. Anyhow, the twins, long held in check, and now feverishly
eager, were already struggling for the chair.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">"THE QUEEN HERSELF TOOK THE CHAIR"</p>

<p>And so to the floor at last came the golden Margate curls, the
heart treasure and glory of a mother, three aunts, and some
feminine cousins.</p>

<p>All having been finished, the children, highly elate, thronged
out into the street. They crowed and cackled with pride and joy,
anon turning to scorn the cowardly Dan Earl.</p>

<p>Ella Earl was an exception. She had been pensive for some time,
and now the shorn little maiden began vaguely to weep. In the door
of his shop William Neeltje stood watching them, upon his face a
grin of almost inhuman idiocy.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It now becomes the duty of the unfortunate writer to exhibit
these children to their fond parents. "Come on, Jimmie," cried
little Cora, "let's go show mamma." And they hurried off, these
happy children, to show mamma.</p>

<p>The Trescotts and their guests were assembled indolently
awaiting the luncheon-bell. Jimmie and the angel child burst in
upon them. "Oh, mamma," shrieked little Cora, "see how fine I am!
I've had my hair cut! Isn't it splendid? And Jimmie too!"</p>

<p>The wretched mother took one sight, emitted one yell, and fell
into a chair. Mrs. Trescott dropped a large lady's journal and made
a nerveless mechanical clutch at it. The painter gripped the arms
of his chair and leaned forward, staring until his eyes were like
two little clock faces. Dr. Trescott did not move or speak.</p>

<p>To the children the next moments were chaotic. There was a
loudly wailing mother, and a pale-faced, aghast mother; a
stammering father, and a grim and terrible father. The angel child
did not understand anything of it save the voice of calamity, and
in a moment all her little imperialism went to the winds. She ran
sobbing to her mother. "Oh, mamma! mamma! mamma!"</p>

<p>The desolate Jimmie heard out of this inexplicable situation a
voice which he knew well, a sort of colonel's voice, and he obeyed
like any good soldier. "Jimmie!"</p>

<p>He stepped three paces to the front. "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How did this&mdash;how did this happen?" said Trescott.</p>

<p>Now Jimmie could have explained how had happened anything which
had happened, but he did not know what had happened, so he said,
"I&mdash;I&mdash;nothin'."</p>

<p>"And, oh, look at her frock!" said Mrs. Trescott, brokenly.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i024" src="1403121h-images/i024.jpg" width=
"400" height="302" alt="" name="i024">
</p>

<p class="caption">"'LOOK!' SHE DECLAIMED"</p>

<p>The words turned the mind of the mother of the angel child. She
looked up, her eyes blazing. "Frock!" she repeated. "Frock! What do
I care for her frock? Frock!" she choked out again from the depths
of her bitterness. Then she arose suddenly, and whirled tragically
upon her husband. "Look!" she declaimed. "All&mdash;her
lovely&mdash;hair&mdash;all her lovely hair&mdash;gone&mdash;gone!"
The painter was apparently in a fit; his jaw was set, his eyes were
glazed, his body was stiff and straight. "All
gone&mdash;all&mdash;her lovely hair&mdash;all gone&mdash;my poor
little darlin'&mdash;my&mdash;poor&mdash;little&mdash;darlin'!" And
the angel child added her heart-broken voice to her mother's wail
as they fled into each other's arms.</p>

<p>In the mean time Trescott was patiently unravelling some skeins
of Jimmie's tangled intellect. "And then you went to this barber's
on the hill. Yes. And where did you get the money? Yes. I see. And
who besides you and Cora had their hair cut? The Margate
twi&mdash;Oh, lord!"</p>

<p>Over at the Margate place old Eldridge Margate, the grandfather
of the twins, was in the back garden picking pease and smoking
ruminatively to himself. Suddenly he heard from the house great
noises. Doors slammed, women rushed up-stairs and down-stairs
calling to each other in voices of agony. And then full and mellow
upon the still air arose the roar of the twins in pain.</p>

<p>Old Eldridge stepped out of the pea-patch and moved towards the
house, puzzled, staring, not yet having decided that it was his
duty to rush forward. Then around the corner of the house shot his
daughter Mollie, her face pale with horror.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, father," she gasped, "the children! They&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then around the corner of the house came the twins, howling at
the top of their power, their faces flowing with tears. They were
still hand in hand, the ruling passion being strong even in this
suffering. At sight of them old Eldridge took his pipe hastily out
of his mouth. "Good God!" he said.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>And now what befell one William Neeltje, a barber by trade? And
what was said by angry parents of the mother of such an angel
child? And what was the fate of the angel child herself?</p>

<p>There was surely a tempest. With the exception of the Margate
twins, the boys could well be eliminated from the affair. Of course
it didn't matter if their hair was cut. Also the two little Phelps
girls had had very short hair, anyhow, and their parents were not
too greatly incensed. In the case of Ella Earl, it was mainly the
pathos of the little girl's own grieving; but her mother played a
most generous part, and called upon Mrs. Trescott, and condoled
with the mother of the angel child over their equivalent losses.
But the Margate contingent! They simply screeched.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">"AROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE CAME THE
TWINS"</p>

<p>Trescott, composed and cool-blooded, was in the middle of a
giddy whirl. He was not going to allow the mobbing of his wife's
cousins, nor was he going to pretend that the spoliation of the
Margate twins was a virtuous and beautiful act. He was elected,
gratuitously, to the position of a buffer.</p>

<p>But, curiously enough, the one who achieved the bulk of the
misery was old Eldridge Margate, who had been picking pease at the
time. The feminine Margates stormed his position as individuals, in
pairs, in teams, and <i>en masse</i>. In two days they may have
aged him seven years. He must destroy the utter Neeltje. He must
midnightly massacre the angel child and her mother. He must dip his
arms in blood to the elbows.</p>

<p>Trescott took the first opportunity to express to him his
concern over the affair, but when the subject of the disaster was
mentioned, old Eldridge, to the doctor's great surprise, actually
chuckled long and deeply. "Oh, well, look-a-here," he said. "I
never was so much in love with them there damn curls. The curls was
purty&mdash;yes&mdash;but then I'd a darn sight rather see boys
look more like boys than like two little wax figgers. An', ye know,
the little cusses like it themselves. <i>They</i> never took no
stock in all this washin' an' combin' an' fixin' an' goin' to
church an' paradin' an' showin' off. They stood it because they
were told to. That's all. Of course this here Neel-te-gee, er
whatever his name is, is a plumb dumb ijit, but I don't see what's
to be done, now that the kids is full well cropped. I might go and
burn his shop over his head, but that wouldn't bring no hair back
onto the kids. They're even kicking on sashes now, and that's all
right, 'cause what fer does a boy want a sash?"</p>

<p>Whereupon Trescott perceived that the old man wore his brains
above his shoulders, and Trescott departed from him rejoicing
greatly that it was only women who could not know that there was
finality to most disasters, and that when a thing was fully done,
no amount of door-slammings, rushing up-stairs and down-stairs,
calls, lamentations, tears, could bring back a single hair to the
heads of twins.</p>

<p class="caption">AT THE RAILWAY STATION</p>

<p>But the rains came and the winds blew in the most biblical way
when a certain fact came to light in the Trescott household. Little
Cora, corroborated by Jimmie, innocently remarked that five dollars
had been given her by her father on her birthday, and with this
money the evil had been wrought. Trescott had known it, but
he&mdash;thoughtful man&mdash;had said nothing. For her part, the
mother of the angel child had up to that moment never reflected
that the consummation of the wickedness must have cost a small sum
of money. But now it was all clear to her. He was the guilty
one&mdash;he! "My angel child!"</p>

<p>The scene which ensued was inspiriting. A few days later,
loungers at the railway station saw a lady leading a shorn and
still undaunted lamb. Attached to them was a husband and father,
who was plainly bewildered, but still more plainly vexed, as if he
would be saying: "Damn 'em! Why can't they leave me alone?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="II" name="II"></a>II. LYNX-HUNTING</h2>

<p>JIMMIE lounged about the dining-room and watched his mother with
large, serious eyes. Suddenly he said, "Ma&mdash;now&mdash;can I
borrow pa's gun?"</p>

<p>She was overcome with the feminine horror which is able to
mistake preliminary words for the full accomplishment of the dread
thing. "Why, Jimmie!" she cried. "Of al-l wonders! Your father's
gun! No indeed you can't!"</p>

<p>He was fairly well crushed, but he managed to mutter, sullenly,
"Well, Willie Dalzel, he's got a gun." In reality his heart had
previously been beating with such tumult&mdash;he had himself been
so impressed with the daring and sin of his request&mdash;that he
was glad that all was over now, and his mother could do very little
further harm to his sensibilities. He had been influenced into the
venture by the larger boys.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i036" src="1403121h-images/i036.jpg" width=
"400" height="275" alt="" name="i036">
</p>

<p class="caption">"'MA&mdash;NOW&mdash;CAN I BORROW PA'S
GUN?'"</p>

<p>"Huh!" the Dalzel urchin had said; "your father's got a gun,
hasn't he? Well, why don't you bring that?"</p>

<p>Puffing himself, Jimmie had replied, "Well, I can, if I want
to." It was a black lie, but really the Dalzel boy was too
outrageous with his eternal bill-posting about the gun which a
beaming uncle had intrusted to him. Its possession made him
superior in manfulness to most boys in the neighborhood&mdash;or at
least they enviously conceded him such position&mdash;but he was so
overbearing, and stuffed the fact of his treasure so relentlessly
down their throats, that on this occasion the miserable Jimmie had
lied as naturally as most animals swim.</p>

<p>Willie Dalzel had not been checkmated, for he had instantly
retorted, "Why don't you get it, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can, if I want to."</p>

<p>"Well, get it, then!"</p>

<p>"Well, I can, if I want to."</p>

<p>Thereupon Jimmie had paced away with great airs of surety as far
as the door of his home, where his manner changed to one of
tremulous misgiving as it came upon him to address his mother in
the dining-room. There had happened that which had happened.</p>

<p>When Jimmie returned to his two distinguished companions he was
blown out with a singular pomposity. He spoke these noble words:
"Oh, well, I guess I don't want to take the gun out to-day."</p>

<p>They had been watching him with gleaming ferret eyes, and they
detected his falsity at once. They challenged him with shouted
gibes, but it was not in the rules for the conduct of boys that one
should admit anything whatsoever, and so Jimmie, backed into an
ethical corner, lied as stupidly, as desperately, as hopelessly as
ever lone savage fights when surrounded at last in his jungle.</p>

<p>Such accusations were never known to come to any point, for the
reason that the number and kind of denials always equalled or
exceeded the number of accusations, and no boy was ever brought
really to book for these misdeeds.</p>

<p>In the end they went off together, Willie Dalzel with his gun
being a trifle in advance and discoursing upon his various works.
They passed along a maple-lined avenue, a highway common to boys
bound for that free land of hills and woods in which they lived in
some part their romance of the moment, whether it was of Indians,
miners, smugglers, soldiers, or outlaws. The paths were their
paths, and much was known to them of the secrets of the dark green
hemlock thickets, the wastes of sweet-fern and huckleberry, the
cliffs of gaunt bluestone with the sumach burning red at their
feet. Each boy had, I am sure, a conviction that some day the
wilderness was to give forth to him a marvellous secret. They felt
that the hills and the forest knew much, and they heard a voice of
it in the silence. It was vague, thrilling, fearful, and altogether
fabulous. The grown folk seemed to regard these wastes merely as so
much distance between one place and another place, or as a
rabbit-cover, or as a district to be judged according to the value
of the timber; but to the boys it spoke some great inspiring word,
which they knew even as those who pace the shore know the enigmatic
speech of the surf. In the mean time they lived there, in season,
lives of ringing adventure&mdash;by dint of imagination.</p>

<p>The boys left the avenue, skirted hastily through some private
grounds, climbed a fence, and entered the thickets. It happened
that at school the previous day Willie Dalzel had been forced to
read and acquire in some part a solemn description of a lynx. The
meagre information thrust upon him had caused him grimaces of
suffering, but now he said, suddenly, "I'm goin' to shoot a
lynx."</p>

<p>The other boys admired this statement, but they were silent for
a time. Finally Jimmie said, meekly, "What's a lynx?" He had
endured his ignorance as long as he was able.</p>

<p>The Dalzel boy mocked him. "Why, don't you know what a lynx is?
A lynx? Why, a lynx is a animal somethin' like a cat, an' it's got
great big green eyes, and it sits on the limb of a tree an' jus'
glares at you. It's a pretty bad animal, I tell you. Why, when
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Huh!" said the third boy. "Where'd you ever see a lynx?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've seen 'em&mdash;plenty of 'em. I bet you'd be scared if
you seen one once."</p>

<p>Jimmie and the other boy each demanded, "How do you know I
would?"</p>

<p>They penetrated deeper into the wood. They climbed a rocky
zigzag path which led them at times where with their hands they
could almost touch the tops of giant pines. The gray cliffs sprang
sheer towards the sky. Willie Dalzel babbled about his impossible
lynx, and they stalked the mountain-side like chamois-hunters,
although no noise of bird or beast broke the stillness of the
hills. Below them Whilomville was spread out somewhat like the
cheap green and black lithograph of the time&mdash;"A Bird's-eye
View of Whilomville, N. Y."</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i042" src="1403121h-images/i042.jpg" width=

</p>

<p class="caption">THE DALZEL BOY TAKING THE PART OF A BANDIT
CHIEF</p>

<p>In the end the boys reached the top of the mountain and scouted
off among wild and desolate ridges. They were burning with the
desire to slay large animals. They thought continually of
elephants, lions, tigers, crocodiles. They discoursed upon their
immaculate conduct in case such monsters confronted them, and they
all lied carefully about their courage.</p>

<p>The breeze was heavy with the smell of sweet-fern. The pines and
hemlocks sighed as they waved their branches. In the hollows the
leaves of the laurels were lacquered where the sunlight found them.
No matter the weather, it would be impossible to long continue an
expedition of this kind without a fire, and presently they built
one, snapping down for fuel the brittle under-branches of the
pines. About this fire they were willed to conduct a sort of play,
the Dalzel boy taking the part of a bandit chief, and the other
boys being his trusty lieutenants. They stalked to and fro,
long-strided, stern yet devil-may-care, three terrible little
figures.</p>

<p>Jimmie had an uncle who made game of him whenever he caught him
in this kind of play, and often this uncle quoted derisively the
following classic: "Once aboard the lugger, Bill, and the girl is
mine. Now to burn the ch&acirc;teau and destroy all evidence of our
crime. But, hark'e, Bill, no wiolence." Wheeling abruptly, he
addressed these dramatic words to his comrades. They were
impressed; they decided at once to be smugglers, and in the most
ribald fashion they talked about carrying off young women.</p>

<p>At last they continued their march through the woods. The
smuggling <i>motif</i> was now grafted fantastically upon the
original lynx idea, which Willie Dalzel refused to abandon at any
price.</p>

<p>Once they came upon an innocent bird who happened to be looking
another way at the time. After a great deal of man&oelig;vering and
big words, Willie Dalzel reared his fowling-piece and blew this
poor thing into a mere rag of wet feathers, of which he was
proud.</p>

<p>Afterwards the other big boy had a turn at another bird. Then it
was plainly Jimmie's chance. The two others had, of course, some
thought of cheating him out of this chance, but of a truth he was
timid to explode such a thunderous weapon, and as soon as they
detected this fear they simply overbore him, and made it clearly
understood that if he refused to shoot he would lose his caste, his
scalp-lock, his girdle, his honor.</p>

<p>They had reached the old death-colored snake-fence which marked
the limits of the upper pasture of the Fleming farm. Under some
hickory-trees the path ran parallel to the fence. Behold! a small
priestly chipmonk came to a rail, and folding his hands on his
abdomen, addressed them in his own tongue. It was Jimmie's shot.
Adjured by the others, he took the gun. His face was stiff with
apprehension. The Dalzel boy was giving forth fine words. "Go
ahead. Aw, don't be afraid. It's nothin' to do. Why, I've done it a
million times. Don't shut both your eyes, now. Jus' keep one open
and shut the other one. He'll get away if you don't watch out. Now
you're all right. Why don't you let'er go? Go ahead."</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i046" src="1403121h-images/i046.jpg" width=
"400" height="593" alt="" name="i046">
</p>

<p class="caption">"THERE WAS A FRIGHTFUL ROAR"</p>

<p>Jimmie, with his legs braced apart, was in the centre of the
path. His back was greatly bent, owing to the mechanics of
supporting the heavy gun. His companions were screeching in the
rear. There was a wait.</p>

<p>Then he pulled trigger. To him there was a frightful roar, his
cheek and his shoulder took a stunning blow, his face felt a hot
flush of fire, and opening his two eyes, he found that he was still
alive. He was not too dazed to instantly adopt a becoming egotism.
It had been the first shot of his life.</p>

<p>But directly after the well-mannered celebration of this victory
a certain cow, which had been grazing in the line of fire, was seen
to break wildly across the pasture, bellowing and bucking. The
three smugglers and lynx-hunters looked at each other out of
blanched faces. Jimmie had hit the cow. The first evidence of his
comprehension of this fact was in the celerity with which he
returned the discharged gun to Willie Dalzel.</p>

<p>They turned to flee. The land was black, as if it had been
overshadowed suddenly with thick storm-clouds, and even as they
fled in their horror a gigantic Swedish farm-hand came from the
heavens and fell upon them, shrieking in eerie triumph. In a
twinkle they were clouted prostrate. The Swede was elate and
ferocious in a foreign and fulsome way. He continued to beat them
and yell.</p>

<p>From the ground they raised their dismal appeal. "Oh, please,
mister, we didn't do it! He did it! I didn't do it! We didn't do
it! We didn't mean to do it! Oh, please, mister!"</p>

<p>In these moments of childish terror little lads go half-blind,
and it is possible that few moments of their after-life made them
suffer as they did when the Swede flung them over the fence and
marched them towards the farm-house. They begged like cowards on
the scaffold, and each one was for himself. "Oh, please let me go,
mister! I didn't do it, mister! He did it! Oh, p-l-ease let me go,
mister!"</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i050" src="1403121h-images/i050.jpg" width=

</p>

<p class="caption">"'I THOUGHT SHE WAS A LYNX'"</p>

<p>The boyish view belongs to boys alone, and if this tall and
knotted laborer was needlessly without charity, none of the three
lads questioned it. Usually when they were punished they decided
that they deserved it, and the more they were punished the more
they were convinced that they were criminals of a most subterranean
type. As to the hitting of the cow being a pure accident, and
therefore not of necessity a criminal matter, such reading never
entered their heads. When things happened and they were caught,
they commonly paid dire consequences, and they were accustomed to
measure the probabilities of woe utterly by the damage done, and
not in any way by the culpability. The shooting of the cow was
plainly heinous, and undoubtedly their dungeons would be knee-deep
in water.</p>

<p>"He did it, mister!" This was a general outcry. Jimmie used it
as often as did the others. As for them, it is certain that they
had no direct thought of betraying their comrade for their own
salvation. They thought themselves guilty because they were caught;
when boys were not caught they might possibly be innocent. But
captured boys were guilty. When they cried out that Jimmie was the
culprit, it was principally a simple expression of terror.</p>

<p>Old Henry Fleming, the owner of the farm, strode across the
pasture towards them. He had in his hand a most cruel whip. This
whip he flourished. At his approach the boys suffered the agonies
of the fire regions. And yet anybody with half an eye could see
that the whip in his hand was a mere accident, and that he was a
kind old man&mdash;when he cared.</p>

<p>When he had come near he spoke crisply. "What you boys ben doin'
to my cow?" The tone had deep threat in it. They all answered by
saying that none of them had shot the cow. Their denials were
tearful and clamorous, and they crawled knee by knee. The vision of
it was like three martyrs being dragged towards the stake. Old
Fleming stood there, grim, tight-lipped. After a time he said,
"Which boy done it?"</p>

<p>There was some confusion, and then Jimmie spake. "I done it,
mister."</p>

<p>Fleming looked at him. Then he asked, "Well, what did you shoot
'er fer?"</p>

<p>Jimmie thought, hesitated, decided, faltered, and then
formulated this: "I thought she was a lynx."</p>

<p>Old Fleming and his Swede at once lay down in the grass and
laughed themselves helpless.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="III" name="III"></a>III. THE LOVER AND THE TELLTALE</h2>

<p>WHEN the angel child returned with her parents to New York, the
fond heart of Jimmie Trescott felt its bruise greatly. For two days
he simply moped, becoming a stranger to all former joys. When his
old comrades yelled invitation, as they swept off on some
interesting quest, he replied with mournful gestures of
disillusion.</p>

<p>He thought often of writing to her, but of course the shame of
it made him pause. Write a letter to a girl? The mere enormity of
the idea caused him shudders. Persons of his quality never wrote
letters to girls. Such was the occupation of mollycoddles and
snivellers. He knew that if his acquaintances and friends found in
him evidences of such weakness and general milkiness, they would
fling themselves upon him like so many wolves, and bait him beyond
the borders of sanity.</p>

<p>However, one day at school, in that time of the morning session
when children of his age were allowed fifteen minutes of play in
the school-grounds, he did not as usual rush forth ferociously to
his games. Commonly he was of the worst hoodlums, preying upon his
weaker brethren with all the cruel disregard of a grown man. On
this particular morning he stayed in the school-room, and with his
tongue stuck from the corner of his mouth, and his head twisting in
a painful way, he wrote to little Cora, pouring out to her all the
poetry of his hungry soul, as follows: "My dear Cora I love thee
with all my hart oh come bac again, bac, bac gain for I love thee
best of all oh come bac again When the spring come again we'l fly
and we'l fly like a brid."</p>

<p>As for the last word, he knew under normal circumstances
perfectly well how to spell "bird," but in this case he had
transposed two of the letters through excitement, supreme
agitation.</p>

<p>Nor had this letter been composed without fear and furtive
glancing. There was always a number of children who, for the time,
cared more for the quiet of the school-room than for the tempest of
the play-ground, and there was always that dismal company who were
being forcibly deprived of their recess&mdash;who were being "kept
in." More than one curious eye was turned upon the desperate and
lawless Jimmie Trescott suddenly taken to ways of peace, and as he
felt these eyes he flushed guiltily, with felonious glances from
side to side.</p>

<p>It happened that a certain vigilant little girl had a seat
directly across the aisle from Jimmie's seat, and she had remained
in the room during the intermission, because of her interest in
some absurd domestic details concerning her desk. Parenthetically
it might be stated that she was in the habit of imagining this desk
to be a house, and at this time, with an important little frown,
indicative of a proper matron, she was engaged in dramatizing her
ideas of a household.</p>

<p>But this small Rose Goldege happened to be of a family which
numbered few males. It was, in fact, one of those curious
middle-class families that hold much of their ground, retain most
of their position, after all their visible means of support have
been dropped in the grave. It contained now only a collection of
women who existed submissively, defiantly, securely, mysteriously,
in a pretentious and often exasperating virtue. It was often too
triumphantly clear that they were free of bad habits. However, bad
habits is a term here used in a commoner meaning, because it is
certainly true that the principal and indeed solitary joy which
entered their lonely lives was the joy of talking wickedly and
busily about their neighbors. It was all done without dream of its
being of the vulgarity of the alleys. Indeed it was simply a
constitutional but not incredible chastity and honesty expressing
itself in its ordinary superior way of the whirling circles of
life, and the vehemence of the criticism was not lessened by a
further infusion of an acid of worldly defeat, worldly suffering,
and worldly hopelessness.</p>

<p>Out of this family circle had sprung the typical little girl who
discovered Jimmie Trescott agonizingly writing a letter to his
sweetheart. Of course all the children were the most abandoned
gossips, but she was peculiarly adapted to the purpose of making
Jimmie miserable over this particular point. It was her life to sit
of evenings about the stove and hearken to her mother and a lot of
spinsters talk of many things. During these evenings she was never
licensed to utter an opinion either one way or the other way. She
was then simply a very little girl sitting open-eyed in the gloom,
and listening to many things which she often interpreted wrongly.
They on their part kept up a kind of a smug-faced pretence of
concealing from her information in detail of the widespread crime,
which pretence may have been more elaborately dangerous than no
pretence at all. Thus all her home-teaching fitted her to recognize
at once in Jimmie Trescott's manner that he was concealing
something that would properly interest the world. She set up a
scream. "Oh! Oh! Oh! Jimmie Trescott's writing to his girl! Oh!
Oh!"</p>

<p>Jimmie cast a miserable glance upon her&mdash;a glance in which
hatred mingled with despair. Through the open window he could hear
the boisterous cries of his friends&mdash;his hoodlum
friends&mdash;who would no more understand the utter poetry of his
position than they would understand an ancient tribal
sign-language. His face was set in a truer expression of horror
than any of the romances describe upon the features of a man flung
into a moat, a man shot in the breast with an arrow, a man cleft in
the neck with a battle-axe. He was suppedaneous of the fullest
power of childish pain. His one course was to rush upon her and
attempt, by an impossible means of strangulation, to keep her
important news from the public.</p>

<p>The teacher, a thoughtful young woman at her desk upon the
platform, saw a little scuffle which informed her that two of her
scholars were larking. She called out sharply. The command
penetrated to the middle of an early world struggle. In Jimmie's
age there was no particular scruple in the minds of the male sex
against laying warrior hands upon their weaker sisters. But, of
course, this voice from the throne hindered Jimmie in what might
have been a berserk attack.</p>

<p>Even the little girl was retarded by the voice, but, without
being unlawful, she managed soon to shy through the door and out
upon the play-ground, yelling, "Oh, Jimmie Trescott's been writing
to his girl!"</p>

<p>The unhappy Jimmie was following as closely as he was allowed by
his knowledge of the decencies to be preserved under the eye of the
teacher.</p>

<p>Jimmie himself was mainly responsible for the scene which ensued
on the play-ground. It is possible that the little girl might have
run, shrieking his infamy, without exciting more than a general but
unmilitant interest. These barbarians were excited only by the
actual appearance of human woe; in that event they cheered and
danced. Jimmie made the strategic mistake of pursuing little Rose,
and thus exposed his thin skin to the whole school. He had in his
cowering mind a vision of a hundred children turning from their
play under the maple-trees and speeding towards him over the gravel
with sudden wild taunts. Upon him drove a yelping demoniac mob, to
which his words were futile. He saw in this mob boys that he dimly
knew, and his deadly enemies, and his retainers, and his most
intimate friends. The virulence of his deadly enemy was no greater
than the virulence of his intimate friend. From the outskirts the
little informer could be heard still screaming the news, like a toy
parrot with clock-work inside of it. It broke up all sorts of
games, not so much because of the mere fact of the letter-writing,
as because the children knew that some sufferer was at the last
point, and, like little blood-fanged wolves, they thronged to the
scene of his destruction. They galloped about him shrilly chanting
insults. He turned from one to another, only to meet with howls. He
was baited.</p>

<p>Then, in one instant, he changed all this with a blow. Bang! The
most pitiless of the boys near him received a punch, fairly and
skilfully, which made him bellow out like a walrus, and then Jimmie
laid desperately into the whole world, striking out frenziedly in
all directions. Boys who could handily whip him, and knew it,
backed away from this onslaught. Here was intention&mdash;serious
intention. They themselves were not in frenzy, and their cooler
judgment respected Jimmie's efforts when he ran amuck. They saw
that it really was none of their affair. In the mean time the
wretched little girl who had caused the bloody riot was away, by
the fence, weeping because boys were fighting.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i062" src="1403121h-images/i062.jpg" width=

</p>

<p class="caption">"THEY GALLOPED ABOUT HIM, SHRILLY CHANTING
INSULTS."</p>

<p>Jimmie several times hit the wrong boy&mdash;that is to say, he
several times hit a wrong boy hard enough to arouse also in him a
spirit of strife. Jimmie wore a little shirt-waist. It was passing
now rapidly into oblivion. He was sobbing, and there was one blood
stain upon his cheek. The school-ground sounded like a pinetree
when a hundred crows roost in it at night.</p>

<p>Then upon the situation there pealed a brazen bell. It was a
bell that these children obeyed, even as older nations obey the
formal law which is printed in calf-skin. It smote them into some
sort of inaction; even Jimmie was influenced by its potency,
although, as a finale, he kicked out lustily into the legs of an
intimate friend who had been one of the foremost in the
torture.</p>

<p>When they came to form into line for the march into the
school-room it was curious that Jimmie had many admirers. It was
not his prowess; it was the soul he had infused into his
gymnastics; and he, still panting, looked about him with a stern
and challenging glare.</p>

<p>And yet when the long tramping line had entered the school-room
his status had again changed. The other children then began to
regard him as a boy in disrepair, and boys in disrepair were always
accosted ominously from the throne. Jimmie's march towards his seat
was a feat. It was composed partly of a most slinking attempt to
dodge the perception of the teacher and partly of pure braggadocio
erected for the benefit of his observant fellow-men.</p>

<p>The teacher looked carefully down at him. "Jimmie Trescott," she
said.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," he answered, with businesslike briskness, which really
spelled out falsity in all its letters.</p>

<p>"Come up to the desk."</p>

<p>He rose amid the awe of the entire school-room. When he arrived
she said,</p>

<p>"Jimmie, you've been fighting."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," he answered. This was not so much an admission of the
fact as it was a concessional answer to anything she might say.</p>

<p>"Who have you been fighting?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I dunno', 'm."</p>

<p>Whereupon the empress blazed out in wrath. "You don't know who
you've been fighting?"</p>

<p>Jimmie looked at her gloomily. "No, 'm."</p>

<p>She seemed about to disintegrate to mere flaming fagots of
anger. "You don't know who you've been fighting?" she demanded,
blazing. "Well, you stay in after school until you find out."</p>

<p>As he returned to his place all the children knew by his
vanquished air that sorrow had fallen upon the house of Trescott.
When he took his seat he saw gloating upon him the satanic black
eyes of the little Goldege girl.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="IV" name="IV"></a>IV. "SHOWIN' OFF"</h2>

<p>JIMMIE TRESCOTT'S new velocipede had the largest front wheel of
any velocipede in Whilomville. When it first arrived from New York
he wished to sacrifice school, food, and sleep to it. Evidently he
wished to become a sort of a perpetual velocipede-rider. But the
powers of the family laid a number of judicious embargoes upon him,
and he was prevented from becoming a fanatic. Of course this caused
him to retain a fondness for the three-wheeled thing much longer
than if he had been allowed to debauch himself for a span of days.
But in the end it was an immaterial machine to him. For long
periods he left it idle in the stable.</p>

<p>One day he loitered from school towards home by a very
circuitous route. He was accompanied by only one of his retainers.
The object of this d&eacute;tour was the wooing of a little girl in
a red hood. He had been in love with her for some three weeks. His
desk was near her desk in school, but he had never spoken to her.
He had been afraid to take such a radical step. It was not
customary to speak to girls. Even boys who had school-going sisters
seldom addressed them during that part of a day which was devoted
to education.</p>

<p>The reasons for this conduct were very plain. First, the more
robust boys considered talking with girls an unmanly occupation;
second, the greater part of the boys were afraid; third, they had
no idea of what to say, because they esteemed the proper sentences
should be supernaturally incisive and eloquent. In consequence, a
small contingent of blue-eyed weaklings were the sole intimates of
the frail sex, and for it they were boisterously and disdainfully
called "girl-boys."</p>

<p>But this situation did not prevent serious and ardent wooing.
For instance, Jimmie and the little girl who wore the red hood must
have exchanged glances at least two hundred times in every
school-hour, and this exchange of glances accomplished everything.
In them the two children renewed their curious inarticulate
vows.</p>

<p>Jimmie had developed a devotion to school which was the
admiration of his father and mother. In the mornings he was so
impatient to have it made known to him that no misfortune had
befallen his romance during the night that he was actually detected
at times feverishly listening for the "first bell." Dr. Trescott
was exceedingly complacent of the change, and as for Mrs. Trescott,
she had ecstatic visions of a white-haired Jimmie leading the
nations in knowledge, comprehending all from bugs to comets. It was
merely the doing of the little girl in the red hood.</p>

<p>When Jimmie made up his mind to follow his sweetheart home from
school, the project seemed such an arbitrary and shameless
innovation that he hastily lied to himself about it. No, he was not
following Abbie. He was merely making his way homeward through the
new and rather longer route of Bryant Street and Oakland Park. It
had nothing at all to do with a girl. It was a mere eccentric
notion.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Jimmie, gruffly, to his retainer. "Let's go home
this way."</p>

<p>"What fer?" demanded the retainer.</p>

<p>"Oh, b'cause."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's more fun&mdash;goin' this way."</p>

<p>The retainer was bored and loath, but that mattered very little.
He did not know how to disobey his chief. Together they followed
the trail of red-hooded Abbie and another small girl. These latter
at once understood the object of the chase, and looking back
giggling, they pretended to quicken their pace. But they were
always looking back. Jimmie now began his courtship in earnest. The
first thing to do was to prove his strength in battle. This was
transacted by means of the retainer. He took that devoted boy and
flung him heavily to the ground, meanwhile mouthing a preposterous
ferocity.</p>

<p>The retainer accepted this behavior with a sort of bland
resignation. After his overthrow he raised himself, coolly brushed
some dust and dead leaves from his clothes, and then seemed to
forget the incident.</p>

<p>"I can jump farther'n you can," said Jimmie, in a loud
voice.</p>

<p>"I know it," responded the retainer, simply.</p>

<p>But this would not do. There must be a contest.</p>

<p>"Come on," shouted Jimmie, imperiously. "Let's see you
jump."</p>

<p>The retainer selected a footing on the curb, balanced and
calculated a moment, and jumped without enthusiasm. Jimmie's leap
of course was longer.</p>

<p>"There!" he cried, blowing out his lips. "I beat you, didn't I?
Easy. I beat you." He made a great hubbub, as if the affair was
unprecedented.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted the other, emotionless.</p>

<p>Later, Jimmie forced his retainer to run a race with him, held
more jumping matches, flung him twice to earth, and generally
behaved as if a retainer was indestructible. If the retainer had
been in the plot, it is conceivable that he would have endured this
treatment with mere whispered, half-laughing protests. But he was
not in the plot at all, and so he became enigmatic. One cannot
often sound the profound well in which lie the meanings of
boyhood.</p>

<p>Following the two little girls, Jimmie eventually passed into
that suburb of Whilomville which is called Oakland Park. At his
heels came a badly battered retainer. Oakland Park was a somewhat
strange country to the boys. They were dubious of the manners and
customs, and of course they would have to meet the local
chieftains, who might look askance upon this invasion.</p>

<p>Jimmie's girl departed into her home with a last backward glance
that almost blinded the thrilling boy. On this pretext and that
pretext, he kept his retainer in play before the house. He had
hopes that she would emerge as soon as she had deposited her
school-bag.</p>

<p>A boy came along the walk. Jimmie knew him at school. He was
Tommie Semple, one of the weaklings who made friends with the fair
sex. "Hello, Tom," said Jimmie. "You live round here?"</p>

<p>"Yeh," said Tom, with composed pride. At school he was afraid of
Jimmie, but he did not evince any of this fear as he strolled well
inside his own frontiers. Jimmie and his retainer had not expected
this boy to display the manners of a minor chief, and they
contemplated him attentively. There was a silence. Finally Jimmie
said:</p>

<p>"I can put you down." He moved forward briskly. "Can't I?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>The challenged boy backed away. "I know you can," he declared,
frankly and promptly.</p>

<p>The little girl in the red hood had come out with a hoop. She
looked at Jimmie with an air of insolent surprise in the fact that
he still existed, and began to trundle her hoop off towards some
other little girls who were shrilly playing near a nurse-maid and a
perambulator.</p>

<p>Jimmie adroitly shifted his position until he too was playing
near the perambulator, pretentiously making mince-meat out of his
retainer and Tommie Semple.</p>

<p>Of course little Abbie had defined the meaning of Jimmie's
appearance in Oakland Park. Despite this nonchalance and grand air
of accident, nothing could have been more plain. Whereupon she of
course became insufferably vain in manner, and whenever Jimmie came
near her she tossed her head and turned away her face, and daintily
swished her skirts as if he were contagion itself. But Jimmie was
happy. His soul was satisfied with the mere presence of the beloved
object so long as he could feel that she furtively gazed upon him
from time to time and noted his extraordinary prowess, which he was
proving upon the persons of his retainer and Tommie Semple. And he
was making an impression. There could be no doubt of it. He had
many times caught her eye fixed admiringly upon him as he mauled
the retainer. Indeed, all the little girls gave attention to his
deeds, and he was the hero of the hour.</p>

<p>Presently a boy on a velocipede was seen to be tooling down
towards them. "Who's this comin'?" said Jimmie, bluntly, to the
Semple boy.</p>

<p>"That's Horace Glenn," said Tommie, "an' he's got a new
velocipede, an' he can ride it like anything."</p>

<p>"Can you lick him?" asked Jimmie.</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;I never fought with 'im," answered the other. He
bravely tried to appear as a man of respectable achievement, but
with Horace coming towards them the risk was too great. However, he
added, "<i>Maybe</i> I could."</p>

<p>The advent of Horace on his new velocipede created a sensation
which he haughtily accepted as a familiar thing. Only Jimmie and
his retainer remained silent and impassive. Horace eyed the two
invaders.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jimmie!"</p>

<p>"Hello, Horace!"</p>

<p>After the typical silence Jimmie said, pompously, "I got a
velocipede."</p>

<p>"Have you?" asked Horace, anxiously. He did not wish anybody in
the world but himself to possess a velocipede.</p>

<p>"Yes," sang Jimmie. "An' it's a bigger one than that, too! A
good deal bigger! An' it's a better one, too!"</p>

<p>"Huh!" retorted Horace, sceptically.</p>

<p>"'Ain't I, Clarence? 'Ain't I? 'Ain't I got one bigger'n
that?"</p>

<p>The retainer answered with alacrity:</p>

<p>"Yes, he has! A good deal bigger! An' it's a dindy, too!"</p>

<p>This corroboration rather disconcerted Horace, but he continued
to scoff at any statement that Jimmie also owned a velocipede. As
for the contention that this supposed velocipede could be larger
than his own, he simply wouldn't hear of it.</p>

<p>Jimmie had been a very gallant figure before the coming of
Horace, but the new velocipede had relegated him to a squalid
secondary position. So he affected to look with contempt upon it.
Voluminously he bragged of the velocipede in the stable at home. He
painted its virtues and beauty in loud and extravagant words,
flaming words. And the retainer stood by, glibly endorsing
everything.</p>

<p>The little company heeded him, and he passed on vociferously
from extravagance to utter impossibility. Horace was very sick of
it. His defence was reduced to a mere mechanical grumbling: "Don't
believe you got one 'tall. Don't believe you got one 'tall."</p>

<p>Jimmie turned upon him suddenly. "How fast can you go? How fast
can you go?" he demanded. "Let's see. I bet you can't go fast."</p>

<p>Horace lifted his spirits and answered with proper defiance.
"Can't I?" he mocked. "Can't I?"</p>

<p>"No, you can't," said Jimmie. "You can't go fast."</p>

<p>Horace cried: "Well, you see me now! I'll show you! I'll show
you if I can't go fast!" Taking a firm seat on his vermilion
machine, he pedalled furiously up the walk, turned, and pedalled
back again. "There, now!" he shouted, triumphantly. "Ain't that
fast? There, now!" There was a low murmur of appreciation from the
little girls. Jimmie saw with pain that even his divinity was
smiling upon his rival. "There! Ain't that fast? Ain't that fast?"
He strove to pin Jimmie down to an admission. He was exuberant with
victory.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a feeling of discomfiture, Jimmie did not lose a
moment of time. "Why," he yelled, "that ain't goin' fast 'tall!
That ain't goin' fast 'tall! Why, I can go almost <i>twice</i> as
fast as that! Almost <i>twice</i> as fast! Can't I, Clarence?"</p>

<p>The royal retainer nodded solemnly at the wide-eyed group.
"Course you can!"</p>

<p>"Why," spouted Jimmie, "you just ought to see me ride once! You
just ought to see me! Why, I can go like the wind! Can't I,
Clarence? And I can ride far, too&mdash;oh, awful far! Can't I,
Clarence? Why, I wouldn't have that one! 'Tain't any good! You just
ought to see mine once!"</p>

<p>The overwhelmed Horace attempted to reconstruct his battered
glories. "I can ride right over the curb-stone&mdash;at some of the
crossin's," he announced, brightly.</p>

<p>Jimmie's derision was a splendid sight. "<i>'Right over the
curb-stone!</i>' Why, that wouldn't be <i>nothin'</i> for me to do!
I've rode mine down Bridge Street hill. Yessir! 'Ain't I, Clarence?
Why, it ain't nothin' to ride over a curb-stone&mdash;not for
<i>me</i>! Is it, Clarence?"</p>

<p>"Down Bridge Street hill? You never!" said Horace,
hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Well, didn't I, Clarence? Didn't I, now?"</p>

<p>The faithful retainer again nodded solemnly at the
assemblage.</p>

<p>At last Horace, having fallen as low as was possible, began to
display a spirit for climbing up again. "Oh, you can do wonders!"
he said, laughing. "You can do wonders! I s'pose you could ride
down that bank there?" he asked, with art. He had indicated a
grassy terrace some six feet in height which bounded one side of
the walk. At the bottom was a small ravine in which the reckless
had flung ashes and tins. "I s'pose you could ride down that
bank?"</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i078" src="1403121h-images/i078.jpg" width=
"400" height="587" alt="" name="i078">
</p>

<p class="caption">"'I&mdash;' HE BEGAN. THEN HE VANISHED FROM THE
EDGE OF THE WALK."</p>

<p>All eyes now turned upon Jimmie to detect a sign of his
weakening, but he instantly and sublimely arose to the occasion.
"That bank?" he asked, scornfully. "Why, I've ridden down banks
like that many a time. 'Ain't I, Clarence?"</p>

<p>This was too much for the company. A sound like the wind in the
leaves arose; it was the song of incredulity and ridicule.
"O&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;o!" And on the outskirts a little
girl suddenly shrieked out, "Story-teller!"</p>

<p>Horace had certainly won a skirmish. He was gleeful. "Oh, you
can do wonders!" he gurgled. "You can do wonders!" The
neighborhood's superficial hostility to foreigners arose like magic
under the influence of his sudden success, and Horace had the
delight of seeing Jimmie persecuted in that manner known only to
children and insects.</p>

<p>Jimmie called angrily to the boy on the velocipede, "If you'll
lend me yours, I'll show you whether I can or not."</p>

<p>Horace turned his superior nose in the air. "Oh no! I don't ever
lend it." Then he thought of a blow which would make Jimmie's
humiliation complete. "Besides," he said, airily, "'tain't really
anything hard to do. I could do it&mdash;easy&mdash;if I wanted
to."</p>

<p>But his supposed adherents, instead of receiving this boast with
cheers, looked upon him in a sudden blank silence. Jimmie and his
retainer pounced like cats upon their advantage.</p>

<p>"Oh," they yelled, "you <i>could</i>, eh? Well, let's see you do
it, then! Let's see you do it! Let's see you do it! Now!" In a
moment the crew of little spectators were gibing at Horace.</p>

<p>The blow that would make Jimmie's humiliation complete! Instead,
it had boomeranged Horace into the mud. He kept up a sullen
muttering:</p>

<p>"'Tain't really anything! I could if I wanted to!"</p>

<p>"Dare you to!" screeched Jimmie and his partisans. "Dare you to!
Dare you to! Dare you to!"</p>

<p>There were two things to be done&mdash;to make gallant effort or
to retreat. Somewhat to their amazement, the children at last found
Horace moving through their clamor to the edge of the bank. Sitting
on the velocipede, he looked at the ravine, and then, with gloomy
pride, at the other children. A hush came upon them, for it was
seen that he was intending to make some kind of an ante-mortem
statement.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" he began. Then he vanished from the edge of the walk.
The start had been unintentional&mdash;an accident.</p>

<p>The stupefied Jimmie saw the calamity through a haze. His first
clear vision was when Horace, with a face as red as a red flag,
arose bawling from his tangled velocipede. He and his retainer
exchanged a glance of horror and fled the neighborhood. They did
not look back until they had reached the top of the hill near the
lake. They could see Horace walking slowly under the maples towards
his home, pushing his shattered velocipede before him. His chin was
thrown high, and the breeze bore them the sound of his howls.</p>

<h2><a id="V" name="V"></a>V. MAKING AN ORATOR</h2>

<p>IN the school at Whilomville it was the habit, when children had
progressed to a certain class, to have them devote Friday afternoon
to what was called elocution. This was in the piteously ignorant
belief that orators were thus made. By process of school law,
unfortunate boys and girls were dragged up to address their
fellow-scholars in the literature of the mid-century. Probably the
children who were most capable of expressing themselves, the
children who were most sensitive to the power of speech, suffered
the most wrong. Little blockheads who could learn eight lines of
conventional poetry, and could get up and spin it rapidly at their
classmates, did not undergo a single pang. The plan operated mainly
to agonize many children permanently against arising to speak their
thought to fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>Jimmie Trescott had an idea that by exhibition of undue
ignorance he could escape from being promoted into the first class
room which exacted such penalty from its inmates. He preferred to
dwell in a less classic shade rather than venture into a domain
where he was obliged to perform a certain duty which struck him as
being worse than death. However, willy-nilly, he was somehow sent
ahead into the place of torture.</p>

<p>Every Friday at least ten of the little children had to mount
the stage beside the teacher's desk and babble something which none
of them understood. This was to make them orators. If it had been
ordered that they should croak like frogs, it would have advanced
most of them just as far towards oratory.</p>

<p>Alphabetically Jimmie Trescott was near the end of the list of
victims, but his time was none the less inevitable. "Tanner,
Timmens, Trass, Trescott&mdash;" He saw his downfall
approaching.</p>

<p>He was passive to the teacher while she drove into his mind the
incomprehensible lines of "The Charge of the Light Brigade":</p>

<p class="poem">Half a league, half a league,<br>
Half a league onward&mdash;</p>

<p>He had no conception of a league. If in the ordinary course of
life somebody had told him that he was half a league from home, he
might have been frightened that half a league was fifty miles; but
he struggled manfully with the valley of death and a mystic six
hundred, who were performing something there which was very fine,
he had been told. He learned all the verses.</p>

<p>But as his own Friday afternoon approached he was moved to make
known to his family that a dreadful disease was upon him, and was
likely at any time to prevent him from going to his beloved
school.</p>

<p>On the great Friday when the children of his initials were to
speak their pieces Dr. Trescott was away from home, and the mother
of the boy was alarmed beyond measure at Jimmie's curious illness,
which caused him to lie on the rug in front of the fire and groan
cavernously.</p>

<p>She bathed his feet in hot mustard water until they were
lobster-red. She also placed a mustard plaster on his chest.</p>

<p>He announced that these remedies did him no good at all&mdash;no
good at all. With an air of martyrdom he endured a perfect downpour
of motherly attention all that day. Thus the first Friday was
passed in safety.</p>

<p>With singular patience he sat before the fire in the dining-room
and looked at picture-books, only complaining of pain when he
suspected his mother of thinking that he was getting better.</p>

<p>The next day being Saturday and a holiday, he was miraculously
delivered from the arms of disease, and went forth to play, a
blatantly healthy boy.</p>

<p>He had no further attack until Thursday night of the next week,
when he announced that he felt very, very poorly. The mother was
already chronically alarmed over the condition of her son, but Dr.
Trescott asked him questions which denoted some incredulity. On the
third Friday Jimmie was dropped at the door of the school from the
doctor's buggy. The other children, notably those who had already
passed over the mountain of distress, looked at him with glee,
seeing in him another lamb brought to butchery. Seated at his desk
in the school-room, Jimmie sometimes remembered with dreadful
distinctness every line of "The Charge of the Light Brigade," and
at other times his mind was utterly empty of it. Geography,
arithmetic, and spelling&mdash;usually great tasks&mdash;quite
rolled off him. His mind was dwelling with terror upon the time
when his name should be called and he was obliged to go up to the
platform, turn, bow, and recite his message to his fellow-men.</p>

<p>Desperate expedients for delay came to him. If he could have
engaged the services of a real pain, he would have been glad. But
steadily, inexorably, the minutes marched on towards his great
crisis, and all his plans for escape blended into a mere panic
fear.</p>

<p>The maples outside were defeating the weakening rays of the
afternoon sun, and in the shadowed school-room had come a
stillness, in which, nevertheless, one could feel the complacence
of the little pupils who had already passed through the flames.
They were calmly prepared to recognize as a spectacle the torture
of others.</p>

<p>Little Johnnie Tanner opened the ceremony. He stamped heavily up
to the platform, and bowed in such a manner that he almost fell
down. He blurted out that it would ill befit him to sit silent
while the name of his fair Ireland was being reproached, and he
appealed to the gallant soldier before him if every British
battle-field was not sown with the bones of sons of the Emerald
Isle. He was also heard to say that he had listened with deepening
surprise and scorn to the insinuation of the honorable member from
North Glenmorganshire that the loyalty of the Irish regiments in
her Majesty's service could be questioned. To what purpose, then,
he asked, had the blood of Irishmen flowed on a hundred fields? To
what purpose had Irishmen gone to their death with bravery and
devotion in every part of the world where the victorious flag of
England had been carried? If the honorable member for North
Glenmorganshire insisted upon construing a mere pothouse row
between soldiers in Dublin into a grand treachery to the colors and
to her Majesty's uniform, then it was time for Ireland to think
bitterly of her dead sons, whose graves now marked every step of
England's progress, and yet who could have their honors stripped
from them so easily by the honorable member for North
Glenmorganshire. Furthermore, the honorable member for North
Glenmorganshire&mdash;</p>

<p>It is needless to say that little Johnnie Tanner's language made
it exceedingly hot for the honorable member for North
Glenmorganshire. But Johnnie was not angry. He was only in haste.
He finished the honorable member for North Glenmorganshire in what
might be called a gallop.</p>

<p>Susie Timmens then went to the platform, and with a face as pale
as death whisperingly reiterated that she would be Queen of the
May. The child represented there a perfect picture of unnecessary
suffering. Her small lips were quite blue, and her eyes, opened
wide, stared with a look of horror at nothing.</p>

<p>The phlegmatic Trass boy, with his moon face only expressing
peasant parentage, calmly spoke some undeniably true words
concerning destiny.</p>

<p>In his seat Jimmie Trescott was going half blind with fear of
his approaching doom. He wished that the Trass boy would talk
forever about destiny. If the school-house had taken fire he
thought that he would have felt simply relief. Anything was better.
Death amid the flames was preferable to a recital of "The Charge of
the Light Brigade."</p>

<p>But the Trass boy finished his remarks about destiny in a very
short time. Jimmie heard the teacher call his name, and he felt the
whole world look at him. He did not know how he made his way to the
stage. Parts of him seemed to be of lead, and at the same time
parts of him seemed to be light as air, detached. His face had gone
as pale as had been the face of Susie Timmens. He was simply a
child in torment; that is all there is to be said specifically
about it; and to intelligent people the exhibition would have been
not more edifying than a dog-fight.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i090" src="1403121h-images/i090.jpg" width=

</p>

<p class="caption">"AND THEN HE SUDDENLY SAID, 'HALF A
LEG&mdash;'"</p>

<p>He bowed precariously, choked, made an inarticulate sound, and
then he suddenly said,</p>

<p class="poem">"Half a leg&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>League</i>," said the teacher, coolly.</p>

<p class="poem">"Half a leg&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>League</i>," said the teacher.</p>

<p>"<i>League</i>," repeated Jimmie, wildly.</p>

<p>"Half a league, half a league, half a league onward."</p>

<p>He paused here and looked wretchedly at the teacher.</p>

<p>"Half a league," he muttered&mdash;"half a league&mdash;"</p>

<p>He seemed likely to keep continuing this phrase indefinitely, so
after a time the teacher said, "Well, go on."</p>

<p>"Half a league," responded Jimmie.</p>

<p>The teacher had the opened book before her, and she read from
it:</p>

<p class="poem">"'All in the valley of Death<br>
Rode the&mdash;'</p>

<p>Go on," she concluded.</p>

<p>Jimmie said,</p>

<p class="poem">"All in the valley of Death<br>
Rode the&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

<p>He cast a glance of supreme appeal upon the teacher, and
breathlessly whispered, "Rode the what?"</p>

<p>The young woman flushed with indignation to the roots of her
hair.</p>

<p class="poem">"Rode the six hundred,"</p>

<p>she snapped at him.</p>

<p>The class was arustle with delight at this cruel display. They
were no better than a Roman populace in Nero's time.</p>

<p>Jimmie started off again:</p>

<p class="poem">"Half a leg&mdash;league, half a league, half a
league onward.<br>
All in the valley of death rode the six hundred.<br>
Forward&mdash;forward&mdash;forward&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Light Brigade," suggested the teacher, sharply.</p>

<p>"The Light Brigade," said Jimmie. He was about to die of the
ignoble pain of his position.</p>

<p>As for Tennyson's lines, they had all gone grandly out of his
mind, leaving it a whited wall.</p>

<p>The teacher's indignation was still rampant. She looked at the
miserable wretch before her with an angry stare.</p>

<p>"You stay in after school and learn that all over again," she
commanded. "And be prepared to speak it next Friday. I am
astonished at you, Jimmie. Go to your seat."</p>

<p>If she had suddenly and magically made a spirit of him and left
him free to soar high above all the travail of our earthly lives
she could not have overjoyed him more. He fled back to his seat
without hearing the low-toned gibes of his schoolmates. He gave no
thought to the terrors of the next Friday. The evils of the day had
been sufficient, and to a childish mind a week is a great space of
time.</p>

<p>With the delightful inconsistency of his age he sat in blissful
calm, and watched the sufferings of an unfortunate boy named
Zimmerman, who was the next victim of education. Jimmie, of course,
did not know that on this day there had been laid for him the
foundation of a finished incapacity for public speaking which would
be his until he died.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="VI" name="VI"></a>VI. SHAME</h2>

<p>DON'T come in here botherin' me," said the cook, intolerantly.
"What with your mother bein' away on a visit, an' your father
comin' home soon to lunch, I have enough on my mind&mdash;and that
without bein' bothered with <i>you</i>. The kitchen is no place for
little boys, anyhow. Run away, and don't be interferin' with my
work." She frowned and made a grand pretence of being deep in
herculean labors; but Jimmie did not run away.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;they're goin' to have a picnic," he said, half
audibly.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;they're goin' to have a picnic."</p>

<p>"Who's goin' to have a picnic?" demanded the cook, loudly. Her
accent could have led one to suppose that if the projectors did not
turn out to be the proper parties, she immediately would forbid
this picnic.</p>

<p>Jimmie looked at her with more hopefulness. After twenty minutes
of futile skirmishing, he had at least succeeded in introducing the
subject. To her question he answered, eagerly:</p>

<p>"Oh, everybody! Lots and lots of boys and girls. Everybody."</p>

<p>"Who's everybody?"</p>

<p>According to custom, Jimmie began to singsong through his nose
in a quite indescribable fashion an enumeration of the prospective
picnickers: "Willie Dalzel an' Dan Earl an' Ella Earl an' Wolcott
Margate an' Reeves Margate an' Walter Phelps an' Homer Phelps an'
Minnie Phelps an'&mdash;oh&mdash;lots more girls
an'&mdash;everybody. An' their mothers an' big sisters too." Then
he announced a new bit of information: "They're goin' to have a
picnic."</p>

<p>"Well, let them," said the cook, blandly.</p>

<p>Jimmie fidgeted for a time in silence. At last he murmured,
"I&mdash;now&mdash;I thought maybe you'd let me go."</p>

<p>The cook turned from her work with an air of irritation and
amazement that Jimmie should still be in the kitchen. "Who's
stoppin' you?" she asked, sharply. "I ain't stoppin' you, am
I?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted Jimmie, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you go, then? Nobody's stoppin' you."</p>

<p>"But," said Jimmie, "I&mdash;you&mdash;now&mdash;each fellow has
got to take somethin' to eat with 'm."</p>

<p>"Oh ho!" cried the cook, triumphantly. "So that's it, is it? So
that's what you've been shyin' round here fer, eh? Well, you may as
well take yourself off without more words. What with your mother
bein' away on a visit, an' your father comin' home soon to his
lunch, I have enough on my mind&mdash;an' that without being
bothered with <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>Jimmie made no reply, but moved in grief towards the door. The
cook continued: "Some people in this house seem to think there's
'bout a thousand cooks in this kitchen. Where I used to work
b'fore, there was some reason in 'em. I ain't a horse. A
picnic!"</p>

<p>Jimmie said nothing, but he loitered.</p>

<p>"Seems as if I had enough to do, without havin' <i>you</i> come
round talkin' about picnics. Nobody ever seems to think of the work
I have to do. Nobody ever seems to think of it. Then they come and
talk to me about picnics! What do I care about picnics?"</p>

<p>Jimmie loitered.</p>

<p>"Where I used to work b'fore, there was some reason in 'em. I
never heard tell of no picnics right on top of your mother bein'
away on a visit an' your father comin' home soon to his lunch. It's
all foolishness."</p>

<p>Little Jimmie leaned his head flat against the wall and began to
weep. She stared at him scornfully. "Cryin', eh? Cryin'? What are
you cryin' fer?"</p>

<p>"N-n-nothin'," sobbed Jimmie.</p>

<p>There was a silence, save for Jimmie's convulsive breathing. At
length the cook said: "Stop that blubberin', now. Stop it! This
kitchen ain't no place fer it. Stop it!...Very well! If you don't
stop, I won't give you nothin' to go to the picnic
with&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>For the moment he could not end his tears. "You never said," he
sputtered&mdash;"you never said you'd give me anything."</p>

<p>"An' why would I?" she cried, angrily. "Why would I&mdash;with
you in here a-cryin' an' a-blubberin' an' a-bleatin' round? Enough
to drive a woman crazy! I don't see how you could expect me to! The
idea!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Jimmie announced: "I've stopped cryin'. I ain't goin'
to cry no more 'tall."</p>

<p>"Well, then," grumbled the cook&mdash;"well, then, stop it. I've
got enough on my mind." It chanced that she was making for luncheon
some salmon croquettes. A tin still half full of pinky prepared
fish was beside her on the table. Still grumbling, she seized a
loaf of bread and, wielding a knife, she cut from this loaf four
slices, each of which was as big as a six-shilling novel. She
profligately spread them with butter, and jabbing the point of her
knife into the salmon-tin, she brought up bits of salmon, which she
flung and flattened upon the bread. Then she crashed the pieces of
bread together in pairs, much as one would clash cymbals. There was
no doubt in her own mind but that she had created two
sandwiches.</p>

<p>"There," she cried. "That'll do you all right. Lemme see. What
'll I put 'em in? There&mdash;I've got it." She thrust the
sandwiches into a small pail and jammed on the lid. Jimmie was
ready for the picnic. "Oh, thank you, Mary!" he cried, joyfully,
and in a moment he was off, running swiftly.</p>

<p>The picnickers had started nearly half an hour earlier, owing to
his inability to quickly attack and subdue the cook, but he knew
that the rendezvous was in the grove of tall, pillarlike hemlocks
and pines that grew on a rocky knoll at the lake shore. His heart
was very light as he sped, swinging his pail. But a few minutes
previously his soul had been gloomed in despair; now he was happy.
He was going to the picnic, where privilege of participation was to
be bought by the contents of the little tin pail.</p>

<p>When he arrived in the outskirts of the grove he heard a merry
clamor, and when he reached the top of the knoll he looked down the
slope upon a scene which almost made his little breast burst with
joy. They actually had two camp-fires! Two camp-fires! At one of
them Mrs. Earl was making something&mdash;chocolate, no
doubt&mdash;and at the other a young lady in white duck and a
sailor hat was dropping eggs into boiling water. Other grown-up
people had spread a white cloth and were laying upon it things from
baskets. In the deep cool shadow of the trees the children
scurried, laughing. Jimmie hastened forward to join his
friends.</p>

<p>Homer Phelps caught first sight of him. "Ho!" he shouted; "here
comes Jimmie Trescott! Come on, Jimmie; you be on our side!" The
children had divided themselves into two bands for some purpose of
play. The others of Homer Phelps's party loudly endorsed his plan.
"Yes, Jimmie, you be on <i>our</i> side." Then arose the usual
dispute. "Well, we got the weakest side."</p>

<p>"'Tain't any weaker'n ours."</p>

<p>Homer Phelps suddenly started, and looking hard, said, "What you
got in the pail, Jim?"</p>

<p>Jimmie answered, somewhat uneasily, "Got m' lunch in it."</p>

<p>Instantly that brat of a Minnie Phelps simply tore down the sky
with her shrieks of derision. "Got his <i>lunch</i> in it! In a
<i>pail</i>!" She ran screaming to her mother. "Oh, mamma! Oh,
mamma! Jimmie Trescott's got his picnic in a pail!"</p>

<p>Now there was nothing in the nature of this fact to particularly
move the others&mdash;notably the boys, who were not competent to
care if he had brought his luncheon in a coal-bin; but such is the
instinct of childish society that they all immediately moved away
from him. In a moment he had been made a social leper. All old
intimacies were flung into the lake, so to speak. They dared not
compromise themselves. At safe distances the boys shouted,
scornfully: "Huh! Got his picnic in a pail!" Never again during
that picnic did the little girls speak of him as Jimmie Trescott.
His name now was Him.</p>

<p>His mind was dark with pain as he stood, the hangdog, kicking
the gravel, and muttering as defiantly as he was able, "Well, I can
have it in a pail if I want to." This statement of freedom was of
no importance, and he knew it, but it was the only idea in his
head.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i102" src="1403121h-images/i102.jpg" width=

</p>

<p class="caption">"'JIMMY TRESCOTT'S GOT HIS PICNIC IN A
PAIL!'"</p>

<p>He had been baited at school for being detected in writing a
letter to little Cora, the angel child, and he had known how to
defend himself, but this situation was in no way similar. This was
a social affair, with grown people on all sides. It would be sweet
to catch the Margate twins, for instance, and hammer them into a
state of bleating respect for his pail; but that was a matter for
the jungles of childhood, where grown folk seldom penetrated. He
could only glower.</p>

<p>The amiable voice of Mrs. Earl suddenly called: "Come, children!
Everything's ready!" They scampered away, glancing back for one
last gloat at Jimmie standing there with his pail.</p>

<p>He did not know what to do. He knew that the grown folk expected
him at the spread, but if he approached he would be greeted by a
shameful chorus from the children&mdash;more especially from some
of those damnable little girls. Still, luxuries beyond all dreaming
were heaped on that cloth. One could not forget them. Perhaps if he
crept up modestly, and was very gentle and very nice to the little
girls, they would allow him peace. Of course it had been dreadful
to come with a pail to such a grand picnic, but they might forgive
him.</p>

<p>Oh no, they would not! He knew them better. And then suddenly he
remembered with what delightful expectations he had raced to this
grove, and self-pity overwhelmed him, and he thought he wanted to
die and make every one feel sorry.</p>

<p>The young lady in white duck and a sailor hat looked at him, and
then spoke to her sister, Mrs. Earl. "Who's that hovering in the
distance, Emily?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Earl peered. "Why, it's Jimmie Trescott! Jimmie, come to
the picnic! Why don't you come to the picnic, Jimmie?" He began to
sidle towards the cloth.</p>

<p>But at Mrs. Earl's call there was another outburst from many of
the children. "He's got his picnic in a pail! In a <i>pail</i>! Got
it in a pail!"</p>

<p>Minnie Phelps was a shrill fiend. "Oh, mamma, he's got it in
that pail! See! Isn't it funny? Isn't it dreadful funny?"</p>

<p>"What ghastly prigs children are, Emily!" said the young lady.
"They are spoiling that boy's whole day, breaking his heart, the
little cats! I think I'll go over and talk to him."</p>

<p>"Maybe you had better not," answered Mrs. Earl, dubiously.
"Somehow these things arrange themselves. If you interfere, you are
likely to prolong everything."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll try, at least," said the young lady.</p>

<p>At the second outburst against him Jimmie had crouched down by a
tree, half hiding behind it, half pretending that he was not hiding
behind it. He turned his sad gaze towards the lake. The bit of
water seen through the shadows seemed perpendicular, a
slate-colored wall. He heard a noise near him, and turning, he
perceived the young lady looking down at him. In her hand she held
plates. "May I sit near you?" she asked, coolly.</p>

<p>Jimmie could hardly believe his ears. After disposing herself
and the plates upon the pine needles, she made brief explanation.
"They're rather crowded, you see, over there. I don't like to be
crowded at a picnic, so I thought I'd come here. I hope you don't
mind."</p>

<p>Jimmie made haste to find his tongue. "Oh, I don't mind! I
<i>like</i> to have you here." The ingenuous emphasis made it
appear that the fact of his liking to have her there was in the
nature of a law-dispelling phenomenon, but she did not smile.</p>

<p>"How large is that lake?" she asked.</p>

<p>Jimmie, falling into the snare, at once began to talk in the
manner of a proprietor of the lake. "Oh, it's almost twenty miles
long, an' in one place it's almost four miles wide! an' it's
<i>deep</i> too&mdash;awful deep&mdash;an' it's got real steamboats
on it, an'&mdash;oh&mdash;lots of other boats,
an'&mdash;an'&mdash;an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you go out on it sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, lots of times! My father's got a boat," he said, eying her
to note the effect of his words.</p>

<p>She was correctly pleased and struck with wonder. "Oh, has he?"
she cried, as if she never before had heard of a man owning a
boat.</p>

<p>Jimmie continued: "Yes, an' it's a grea' big boat, too, with
sails, real sails; an' sometimes he takes me out in her, too; an'
once he took me fishin', an' we had sandwiches, plenty of 'em, an'
my father he drank beer right out of the bottle&mdash;<i>right out
of the bottle</i>!"</p>

<p>The young lady was properly overwhelmed by this amazing
intelligence. Jimmie saw the impression he had created, and he
enthusiastically resumed his narrative: "An' after, he let me throw
the bottles in the water, and I throwed 'em 'way, 'way, 'way out.
An' they sank, an'&mdash;never comed up," he concluded,
dramatically.</p>

<p>His face was glorified; he had forgotten all about the pail; he
was absorbed in this communion with a beautiful lady who was so
interested in what he had to say.</p>

<p>She indicated one of the plates, and said, indifferently:
"Perhaps you would like some of those sandwiches. I made them. Do
you like olives? And there's a deviled egg. I made that also."</p>

<p>"Did you really?" said Jimmie, politely. His face gloomed for a
moment because the pail was recalled to his mind, but he timidly
possessed himself of a sandwich.</p>

<p>"Hope you are not going to scorn my deviled egg," said his
goddess. "I am very proud of it." He did not; he scorned little
that was on the plate.</p>

<p>Their gentle intimacy was ineffable to the boy. He thought he
had a friend, a beautiful lady, who liked him more than she did
anybody at the picnic, to say the least. This was proved by the
fact that she had flung aside the luxuries of the spread cloth to
sit with him, the exile. Thus early did he fall a victim to woman's
wiles.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" he asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, a long way from here! In New York."</p>

<p>His next question was put very bluntly. "Are you married?"</p>

<p>"Oh no!" she answered, gravely.</p>

<p>Jimmie was silent for a time, during which he glanced shyly and
furtively up at her face. It was evident that he was somewhat
embarrassed. Finally he said, "When I grow up to be a
man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is some time yet!" said the beautiful lady.</p>

<p>"But when I <i>do</i>, I&mdash;I should like to marry you."</p>

<p>"Well, I will remember it," she answered; "but don't talk of it
now, because it's such a long time; and&mdash;I wouldn't wish you
to consider yourself bound." She smiled at him.</p>

<p>He began to brag. "When I grow up to be a man, I'm goin' to have
lots an' lots of money, an' I'm goin' to have a grea' big house,
an' a horse an' a shot-gun, an' lots an' lots of books 'bout
elephants an' tigers, an' lots an' lots of ice-cream an' pie
an'&mdash;caramels." As before, she was impressed; he could see it.
"An' I'm goin' to have lots an' lots of children&mdash;'bout three
hundred, I guess&mdash;an' there won't none of 'em be girls.
They'll all be boys&mdash;like me."</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" she said.</p>

<p>His garment of shame was gone from him. The pail was dead and
well buried. It seemed to him that months elapsed as he dwelt in
happiness near the beautiful lady and trumpeted his vanity.</p>

<p>At last there was a shout. "Come on! we're going home." The
picnickers trooped out of the grove. The children wished to resume
their jeering, for Jimmie still gripped his pail, but they were
restrained by the circumstances. He was walking at the side of the
beautiful lady.</p>

<p>During this journey he abandoned many of his habits. For
instance, he never travelled without skipping gracefully from crack
to crack between the stones, or without pretending that he was a
train of cars, or without some mumming device of childhood. But now
he behaved with dignity. He made no more noise than a little mouse.
He escorted the beautiful lady to the gate of the Earl home, where
he awkwardly, solemnly, and wistfully shook hands in good-by. He
watched her go up the walk; the door clanged.</p>

<p>On his way home he dreamed. One of these dreams was fascinating.
Supposing the beautiful lady was his teacher in school! Oh, my!
wouldn't he be a good boy, sitting like a statuette all day long,
and knowing every lesson to perfection, and&mdash;everything. And
then supposing that a boy should sass her. Jimmie painted himself
waylaying that boy on the homeward road, and the fate of the boy
was a thing to make strong men cover their eyes with their hands.
And she would like him more and more&mdash;more and more. And
he&mdash;he would be a little god.</p>

<p>But as he was entering his father's grounds an appalling
recollection came to him. He was returning with the
bread-and-butter and the salmon untouched in the pail! He could
imagine the cook, nine feet tall, waving her fist. "An' so that's
what I took trouble for, is it? So's you could bring it back? So's
you could bring it back?" He skulked towards the house like a
marauding bushranger. When he neared the kitchen door he made a
desperate rush past it, aiming to gain the stables and there
secrete his guilt. He was nearing them, when a thunderous voice
hailed him from the rear:</p>

<p>"Jimmie Trescott, where you goin' with that pail?"</p>

<p>It was the cook. He made no reply, but plunged into the shelter
of the stables. He whirled the lid from the pail and dashed its
contents beneath a heap of blankets. Then he stood panting, his
eyes on the door. The cook did not pursue, but she was bawling:</p>

<p>"Jimmie Trescott, what you doin' with that pail?"</p>

<p>He came forth, swinging it. "Nothin'," he said, in virtuous
protest.</p>

<p>"I know better," she said, sharply, as she relieved him of his
curse.</p>

<p>In the morning Jimmie was playing near the stable, when he heard
a shout from Peter Washington, who attended Dr. Trescott's
horse:</p>

<p>"Jim! Oh, Jim!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Come yah."</p>

<p>Jimmie went reluctantly to the door of the stable, and Peter
Washington asked:</p>

<p>"Wut's dish yere fish an' brade doin' unner dese yer
blankups?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I didn't have nothin' to do with it," answered
Jimmie, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Don' tell <i>me</i>!" cried Peter Washington, as he flung it
all away&mdash;"don' tell <i>me</i>! When I fin' fish an' brade
unner dese yer blankups, I don' go an' think dese yer ho'ses er yer
pop's put 'em. I <i>know</i>. An' if I caitch enny more dish yer
fish an' brade in dish yer stable, <i>I'll</i> tell yer pop."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="VII" name="VII"></a>VII. THE CARRIAGE-LAMPS</h2>

<p>IT was the fault of a small nickel-plated revolver, a most
incompetent weapon, which, wherever one aimed, would fling the
bullet as the devil willed, and no man, when about to use it, could
tell exactly what was in store for the surrounding country. This
treasure had been acquired by Jimmie Trescott after arduous
bargaining with another small boy. Jimmie wended homeward, patting
his hip pocket at every three paces.</p>

<p>Peter Washington, working in the carriage-house, looked out upon
him with a shrewd eye. "Oh, Jim," he called, "wut you got in yer
hind pocket?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," said Jimmie, feeling carefully under his jacket to
make sure that the revolver wouldn't fall out.</p>

<p>Peter chuckled. "S'more foolishness, I raikon. You gwine be hung
one day, Jim, you keep up all dish yer nonsense."</p>

<p>Jimmie made no reply, but went into the back garden, where he
hid the revolver in a box under a lilac-bush. Then he returned to
the vicinity of Peter, and began to cruise to and fro in the
offing, showing all the signals of one wishing to open treaty.
"Pete," he said, "how much does a box of cartridges cost?"</p>

<p>Peter raised himself violently, holding in one hand a piece of
harness, and in the other an old rag. "Ca'tridgers!
<i>Ca'tridgers!</i> Lan'sake! wut the kid want with ca'tridgers?
Knew it! Knew it! Come home er-holdin' on to his hind pocket like
he got money in it. An' now he want ca'tridgers."</p>

<p>Jimmie, after viewing with dismay the excitement caused by his
question, began to move warily out of the reach of a possible
hostile movement.</p>

<p>"Ca'tridgers!" continued Peter, in scorn and horror. "Kid like
you! No bigger'n er minute! Look yah, Jim, you done been swappin'
round, an' you done got hol' of er pistol!" The charge was
dramatic.</p>

<p>The wind was almost knocked out of Jimmie by this display of
Peter's terrible miraculous power, and as he backed away his feeble
denials were more convincing than a confession.</p>

<p>"I'll tell yer pop!" cried Peter, in virtuous grandeur. "I'll
tell yer pop!"</p>

<p>In the distance Jimmie stood appalled. He knew not what to do.
The dread adult wisdom of Peter Washington had laid bare the sin,
and disgrace stared at Jimmie.</p>

<p>There was a whirl of wheels, and a high, lean trotting-mare spun
Doctor Trescott's buggy towards Peter, who ran forward busily. As
the doctor climbed out, Peter, holding the mare's head, began his
denunciation:</p>

<p>"Docteh, I gwine tell on Jim. He come home er-holdin' on to his
hind pocket, an' proud like he won a tuhkey-raffle, an' I sure know
what he been up to, an' I done challenge him, an' he nev' say he
didn't."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" said the doctor. "What's this,
Jimmie?"</p>

<p>The boy came forward, glaring wrathfully at Peter. In fact, he
suddenly was so filled with rage at Peter that he forgot all
precautions. "It's about a pistol," he said, bluntly. "I've got a
pistol. I swapped for it."</p>

<p>"I done tol' 'im his pop wouldn' stand no fiah-awms, an' him a
kid like he is. I done tol' 'im. Lan' sake! he strut like he was a
soldier! Come in yere proud, an' er-holdin' on to his hind pocket.
He think he was Jesse James, I raikon. But I done tol' 'im his pop
stan' no sech foolishness. First thing&mdash;<i>blam</i>&mdash;he
shoot his haid off. No, seh, he too tinety t' come in yere
er-struttin' like he jest bought Main Street. I tol' 'im. I done
tol' 'im&mdash;shawp. I don' wanter be loafin' round dis yer stable
if Jim he gwine go shootin' round an' shootin'
round&mdash;<i>blim&mdash;blam&mdash;blim&mdash;blam</i>! No, seh.
I retiahs. I retiahs. It's all right if er grown man got er gun,
but ain't no kids come foolishin' round <i>me</i> with fiah-awms.
No, seh. I retiahs."</p>

<p>"Oh, be quiet, Peter!" said the doctor. "Where is this thing,
Jimmie?"</p>

<p>The boy went sulkily to the box under the lilac-bush and
returned with the revolver. "Here 'tis," he said, with a glare over
his shoulder at Peter. The doctor looked at the silly weapon in
critical contempt.</p>

<p>"It's not much of a thing, Jimmie, but I don't think you are
quite old enough for it yet. I'll keep it for you in one of the
drawers of my desk."</p>

<p>Peter Washington burst out proudly: "I done tol' 'im th' docteh
wouldn' stan' no traffickin' round yere with fiah-awms. I done tol'
'im."</p>

<p>Jimmie and his father went together into the house, and as Peter
unharnessed the mare he continued his comments on the boy and the
revolver. He was not cast down by the absence of hearers. In fact,
he usually talked better when there was no one to listen save the
horses. But now his observations bore small resemblance to his
earlier and public statements. Admiration and the keen family pride
of a Southern negro who has been long in one place were now in his
tone.</p>

<p>"That boy! He's er devil! When he get to be er man&mdash;wow!
He'll jes take an' make things whirl round yere. Raikon we'll all
take er back seat when he come erlong er-raisin' Cain."</p>

<p>He had unharnessed the mare, and with his back bent was pushing
the buggy into the carriage-house.</p>

<p>"Er pistol! An' him no bigger than er minute!"</p>

<p>A small stone whizzed past Peter's head and clattered on the
stable. He hastily dropped all occupation and struck a curious
attitude. His right knee was almost up to his chin, and his arms
were wreathed protectingly about his head. He had not looked in the
direction from which the stone had come, but he had begun
immediately to yell:</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i118" src="1403121h-images/i118.jpg" width=
"400" height="588" alt="" name="i118">
</p>

<p class="caption">"'YOU JIM! QUIT! QUIT, I TELL YER!'"</p>

<p>"You Jim! Quit! Quit, I tell yer, Jim! Watch out! You gwine
break somethin', Jim!"</p>

<p>"Yah!" taunted the boy, as with the speed and ease of a
light-cavalryman he man&oelig;uvred in the distance. "Yah! Told on
me, did you! Told on me, hey! There! How do you like that?" The
missiles resounded against the stable.</p>

<p>"Watch out, Jim! You gwine break something, Jim, I tell yer!
Quit yer foolishness, Jim! Ow! Watch out, boy! I&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a crash. With diabolic ingenuity, one of Jimmie's
pebbles had entered the carriage-house and had landed among a row
of carriage-lamps on a shelf, creating havoc which was apparently
beyond all reason of physical law. It seemed to Jimmie that the
racket of falling glass could have been heard in an adjacent
county.</p>

<p>Peter was a prophet who after persecution was suffered to recall
everything to the mind of the persecutor. "<i>There!</i> Knew it!
Knew it! <i>Now</i> I raikon you'll quit. Hi! jes look ut dese yer
lamps! Fer lan' sake! Oh, now yer pop jes break ev'ry bone in yer
body!"</p>

<p>In the doorway of the kitchen the cook appeared with a startled
face. Jimmie's father and mother came suddenly out on the front
veranda. "What was that noise?" called the the doctor.</p>

<p>Peter went forward to explain. "Jim he was er-heavin' rocks at
me, docteh, an' erlong come one rock an' go <i>blam</i> inter all
th' lamps an' jes skitter 'em t' bits. I declayah&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jimmie, half blinded with emotion, was nevertheless aware of a
lightning glance from his father, a glance which cowed and
frightened him to the ends of his toes. He heard the steady but
deadly tones of his father in a fury: "Go into the house and wait
until I come."</p>

<p>Bowed in anguish, the boy moved across the lawn and up the
steps. His mother was standing on the veranda still gazing towards
the stable. He loitered in the faint hope that she might take some
small pity on his state. But she could have heeded him no less if
he had been invisible. He entered the house.</p>

<p>When the doctor returned from his investigation of the harm done
by Jimmie's hand, Mrs. Trescott looked at him anxiously, for she
knew that he was concealing some volcanic impulses. "Well?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"It isn't the lamps," he said at first. He seated himself on the
rail. "I don't know what we are going to do with that boy. It isn't
so much the lamps as it is the other thing. He was throwing stones
at Peter because Peter told me about the revolver. What are we
going to do with him?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," replied the mother. "We've tried almost
everything. Of course much of it is pure animal spirits. Jimmie is
not naturally vicious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," interrupted the doctor, impatiently. "Do you
suppose, when the stones were singing about Peter's ears, he cared
whether they were flung by a boy who was naturally vicious or a boy
who was not? The question might interest him afterward, but at the
time he was mainly occupied in dodging these effects of pure animal
spirits."</p>

<p>"Don't be too hard on the boy, Ned. There's lots of time yet.
He's so young yet, and&mdash;I believe he gets most of his
naughtiness from that wretched Dalzel boy. That Dalzel
boy&mdash;well, he's simply awful!" Then, with true motherly
instinct to shift blame from her own boy's shoulders, she proceeded
to sketch the character of the Dalzel boy in lines that would have
made that talented young vagabond stare. It was not admittedly her
feeling that the doctor's attention should be diverted from the
main issue and his indignation divided among the camps, but
presently the doctor felt himself burn with wrath for the Dalzel
boy.</p>

<p>"Why don't you keep Jimmie away from him?" he demanded. "Jimmie
has no business consorting with abandoned little predestined
jail-birds like him. If I catch him on the place I'll box his
ears."</p>

<p>"It is simply impossible, unless we kept Jimmie shut up all the
time," said Mrs. Trescott. "I can't watch him every minute of the
day, and the moment my back is turned, he's off."</p>

<p>"I should think those Dalzel people would hire somebody to bring
up their child for them," said the doctor. "They don't seem to know
how to do it themselves."</p>

<p>Presently you would have thought from the talk that one Willie
Dalzel had been throwing stones at Peter Washington because Peter
Washington had told Doctor Trescott that Willie Dalzel had come
into possession of a revolver.</p>

<p>In the mean time Jimmie had gone into the house to await the
coming of his father. He was in a rebellious mood. He had not
intended to destroy the carriage-lamps. He had been merely hurling
stones at a creature whose perfidy deserved such action, and the
hitting of the lamps had been merely another move of the great
conspirator Fate to force one Jimmie Trescott into dark and
troublous ways. The boy was beginning to find the world a bitter
place. He couldn't win appreciation for a single virtue; he could
only achieve quick, rigorous punishment for his misdemeanors.
Everything was an enemy. Now there were those silly old
lamps&mdash;what were they doing up on that shelf, anyhow? It would
have been just as easy for them at the time to have been in some
other place. But no; there they had been, like the crowd that is
passing under the wall when the mason for the first time in twenty
years lets fall a brick. Furthermore, the flight of that stone had
been perfectly unreasonable. It had been a sort of freak in
physical law. Jimmie understood that he might have thrown stones
from the same fatal spot for an hour without hurting a single lamp.
He was a victim&mdash;that was it. Fate had conspired with the
detail of his environment to simply hound him into a grave or into
a cell.</p>

<p>But who would understand? Who would understand? And here the boy
turned his mental glance in every direction, and found nothing but
what was to him the black of cruel ignorance. Very well; some day
they would&mdash;</p>

<p>From somewhere out in the street he heard a peculiar whistle of
two notes. It was the common signal of the boys in the
neighborhood, and judging from the direction of the sound, it was
apparently intended to summon him. He moved immediately to one of
the windows of the sitting-room. It opened upon a part of the
grounds remote from the stables and cut off from the veranda by a
wing. He perceived Willie Dalzel loitering in the street. Jimmie
whistled the signal after having pushed up the window-sash some
inches. He saw the Dalzel boy turn and regard him, and then call
several other boys. They stood in a group and gestured. These
gestures plainly said: "Come out. We've got something on hand."
Jimmie sadly shook his head.</p>

<p>But they did not go away. They held a long consultation.
Presently Jimmie saw the intrepid Dalzel boy climb the fence and
begin to creep among the shrubbery, in elaborate imitation of an
Indian scout. In time he arrived under Jimmie's window, and raised
his face to whisper: "Come on out! We're going on a bear-hunt."</p>

<p>A bear-hunt! Of course Jimmie knew that it would not be a real
bear-hunt, but would be a sort of carouse of pretension and big
talking and preposterous lying and valor, wherein each boy would
strive to have himself called Kit Carson by the others. He was
profoundly affected. However, the parental word was upon him, and
he could not move. "No," he answered, "I can't. I've got to stay
in."</p>

<p>"Are you a prisoner?" demanded the Dalzel boy, eagerly.</p>

<p>"No-o&mdash;yes&mdash;I s'pose I am."</p>

<p>The other lad became much excited, but he did not lose his
wariness. "Don't you want to be rescued?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no&mdash;I dun'no'," replied Jimmie, dubiously.</p>

<p>Willie Dalzel was indignant. "Why, of course you want to be
rescued! We'll rescue you. I'll go and get my men." And thinking
this a good sentence, he repeated, pompously, "I'll go and get my
men." He began to crawl away, but when he was distant some ten
paces he turned to say: "Keep up a stout heart. Remember that you
have friends who will be faithful unto death. The time is not now
far off when you will again view the blessed sunlight."</p>

<p>The poetry of these remarks filled Jimmie with ecstasy, and he
watched eagerly for the coming of the friends who would be faithful
unto death. They delayed some time, for the reason that Willie
Dalzel was making a speech.</p>

<p>"Now, men," he said, "our comrade is a prisoner in yon&mdash;in
yond&mdash;in that there fortress. We must to the rescue. Who
volunteers to go with me?" He fixed them with a stern eye.</p>

<p>There was a silence, and then one of the smaller boys
remarked,</p>

<p>"If Doc Trescott ketches us trackin' over his lawn&mdash;"</p>

<p>Willie Dalzel pounced upon the speaker and took him by the
throat. The two presented a sort of a burlesque of the wood-cut on
the cover of a dime novel which Willie had just been
reading&mdash;<i>The Red Captain: A Tale of the Pirates of the
Spanish Main</i>.</p>

<p>"You are a coward!" said Willie, through his clinched teeth.</p>

<p>"No, I ain't, Willie," piped the other, as best he could.</p>

<p>"I say you are," cried the great chieftain, indignantly. "Don't
tell <i>me</i> I'm a liar." He relinquished his hold upon the
coward and resumed his speech. "You know me, men. Many of you have
been my followers for long years. You saw me slay Six-handed Dick
with my own hand. You know I never falter. Our comrade is a
prisoner in the cruel hands of our enemies. Aw, Pete Washington? He
dassent. My pa says if Pete ever troubles me he'll brain 'im. Come
on! To the rescue! Who will go with me to the rescue? Aw, come on!
What are you afraid of?"</p>

<p class="caption">"HE TURNED TO SAY: 'KEEP UP A STOUT HEART'"</p>

<p>It was another instance of the power of eloquence upon the human
mind. There was only one boy who was not thrilled by this oration,
and he was a boy whose favorite reading had been of the road-agents
and gun-fighters of the great West, and he thought the whole thing
should be conducted in the Deadwood Dick manner. This talk of a
"comrade" was silly; "pard" was the proper word. He resolved that
he would make a show of being a pirate, and keep secret the fact
that he really was Hold-up Harry, the Terror of the Sierras.</p>

<p>But the others were knit close in piratical bonds. One by one
they climbed the fence at a point hidden from the house by tall
shrubs. With many a low-breathed caution they went upon their
perilous adventure.</p>

<p>Jimmie was grown tired of waiting for his friends who would be
faithful unto death. Finally he decided that he would rescue
himself. It would be a gross breach of rule, but he couldn't sit
there all the rest of the day waiting for his faithful-unto-death
friends. The window was only five feet from the ground. He softly
raised the sash and threw one leg over the sill. But at the same
time he perceived his friends snaking among the bushes. He withdrew
his leg and waited, seeing that he was now to be rescued in an
orthodox way. The brave pirates came nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Jimmie heard a noise of a closing door, and turning, he saw his
father in the room looking at him and the open window in angry
surprise. Boys never faint, but Jimmie probably came as near to it
as may the average boy.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" asked the doctor, staring. Involuntarily
Jimmie glanced over his shoulder through the window. His father saw
the creeping figures. "What are those boys doing?" he said,
sharply, and he knit his brows.</p>

<p>"Nothin'."</p>

<p>"Nothing! Don't tell me that. Are they coming here to the
window?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s, sir."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To&mdash;to see me."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"About&mdash;about nothin'."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>Jimmie knew that he could conceal nothing.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">"THE BOY TURNED AGAIN TO HIS FRIEND"</p>

<p>He said, "They're comin' to&mdash;to&mdash;to rescue me." He
began to whimper.</p>

<p>The doctor sat down heavily.</p>

<p>"What? To rescue you?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Y-yes, sir."</p>

<p>The doctor's eyes began to twinkle. "Very well," he said
presently. "I will sit here and observe this rescue. And on no
account do you warn them that I am here. Understand?"</p>

<p>Of course Jimmie understood. He had been mad to warn his
friends, but his father's mere presence had frightened him from
doing it. He stood trembling at the window, while the doctor
stretched in an easy-chair near at hand. They waited. The doctor
could tell by his son's increasing agitation that the great moment
was near. Suddenly he heard Willie Dalzel's voice hiss out a word:
"S-s-silence!" Then the same voice addressed Jimmie at the window:
"Good cheer, my comrade. The time is now at hand. I have come.
Never did the Red Captain turn his back on a friend. One minute
more and you will be free. Once aboard my gallant craft and you can
bid defiance to your haughty enemies. Why don't you hurry up? What
are you standin' there lookin' like a cow for?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;now&mdash;you&mdash;" stammered Jimmie.</p>

<p>Here Hold-up Harry, the Terror of the Sierras, evidently
concluded that Willie Dalzel had had enough of the premier part, so
he said:</p>

<p>"Brace up, pard. Don't ye turn white-livered now, fer ye know
that Hold-up Harry, the Terrar of the Sarahs, ain't the man
ter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, stop it!" said Willie Dalzel. "He won't understand that,
you know. He's a pirate. Now, Jimmie, come on. Be of light heart,
my comrade. Soon you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I 'low arter all this here long time in jail ye thought ye had
no friends mebbe, but I tell ye Hold-up Harry, the Terrar of the
Sarahs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A boat is waitin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have ready a trusty horse&mdash;"</p>

<p>Willie Dalzel could endure his rival no longer.</p>

<p>"Look here, Henry, you're spoilin' the whole thing. We're all
pirates, don't you see, and you're a pirate too."</p>

<p>"I ain't a pirate. I'm Hold-up Harry, the Terrar of the
Sarahs."</p>

<p>"You ain't, I say," said Willie, in despair. "You're spoilin'
everything, you are. All right, now. You wait. I'll fix you for
this, see if I don't! Oh, come on, Jimmie. A boat awaits us at the
foot of the rocks. In one short hour you'll be free forever from
your ex&mdash;exewable enemies, and their vile plots. Hasten, for
the dawn approaches."</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">"THEY WHIRLED AND SCAMPERED AWAY LIKE DEER"</p>

<p>The suffering Jimmie looked at his father, and was surprised at
what he saw. The doctor was doubled up like a man with the colic.
He was breathing heavily. The boy turned again to his friends.
"I&mdash;now&mdash;look here," he began, stumbling among the words.
"You&mdash;I&mdash;I don't think I'll be rescued to-day."</p>

<p>The pirates were scandalized. "What?" they whispered, angrily.
"Ain't you goin' to be rescued? Well, all right for you, Jimmie
Trescott. That's a nice way to act, that is!" Their upturned eyes
glowered at Jimmie.</p>

<p>Suddenly Doctor Trescott appeared at the window with Jimmie.
"Oh, go home, boys!" he gasped, but they did not hear him. Upon the
instant they had whirled and scampered away like deer. The first
lad to reach the fence was the Red Captain, but Hold-up Harry, the
Terror of the Sierras, was so close that there was little to choose
between them.</p>

<p>Doctor Trescott lowered the window, and then spoke to his son in
his usual quiet way. "Jimmie, I wish you would go and tell Peter to
have the buggy ready at seven o'clock."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Jimmie, and he swaggered out to the stables.
"Pete, father wants the buggy ready at seven o'clock."</p>

<p>Peter paid no heed to this order, but with the tender sympathy
of a true friend he inquired, "Hu't?"</p>

<p>"Hurt? Did what hurt?"</p>

<p>"Yer trouncin'."</p>

<p>"Trouncin'!" said Jimmie, contemptuously. "I didn't get any
trouncin'."</p>

<p>"No?" said Peter. He gave Jimmie a quick shrewd glance, and saw
that he was telling the truth. He began to mutter and mumble over
his work. "Ump! Ump! Dese yer white folks act like they think er
boy's made er glass. No trouncin'! Ump!" He was consumed with
curiosity to learn why Jimmie had not felt a heavy parental hand,
but he did not care to lower his dignity by asking questions about
it. At last, however, he reached the limits of his endurance, and
in a voice pretentiously careless he asked, "Didn' yer pop take on
like mad er-bout dese yer cay'ge-lamps?"</p>

<p>"Carriage-lamps?" inquired Jimmie.</p>

<p>"Ump."</p>

<p>"No, he didn't say anything about carriage-lamps&mdash;not that
I remember. Maybe he did, though. Lemme see...No, he never
mentioned 'em."</p>

<h2><a id="VIII" name="VIII"></a>VIII. THE KNIFE</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>SI BRYANT'S place was on the shore of the lake, and his
garden-patch, shielded from the north by a bold little promontory
and a higher ridge inland, was accounted the most successful and
surprising in all Whilomville township. One afternoon Si was
working in the garden-patch, when Doctor Trescott's man, Peter
Washington, came trudging slowly along the road, observing nature.
He scanned the white man's fine agricultural results. "Take your
eye off them there mellons, you rascal," said Si, placidly.</p>

<p>The negro's face widened in a grin of delight. "Well, Mist'
Bryant, I raikon I ain't on'y make m'se'f covertous er-lookin' at
dem yere mellums, sure 'nough. Dey suhtainly is grand."</p>

<p>"That's all right," responded Si, with affected bitterness of
spirit. "That's all right. Just don't you admire 'em too much,
that's all." Peter chuckled and chuckled. "Ma Lode! Mist' Bryant,
y-y-you don' think I'm gwine come prowlin' in dish yer gawden?"</p>

<p>"No, I know you hain't," said Si, with solemnity. "B'cause, if
you did, I'd shoot you so full of holes you couldn't tell yourself
from a sponge."</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;no, seh! No, seh! I don' raikon you'll get chance at
Pete, Mist' Bryant. No, seh. I'll take an' run 'long an' rob er
bank 'fore I'll come foolishin' 'round <i>your</i> gawden, Mist'
Bryant."</p>

<p>Bryant, gnarled and strong as an old tree, leaned on his hoe,
and laughed a Yankee laugh. His mouth remained tightly closed, but
the sinister lines which ran from the sides of his nose to the
meetings of his lips developed to form a comic oval, and he emitted
a series of grunts, while his eyes gleamed merrily and his
shoulders shook. Pete, on the contrary, threw back his head and
guffawed thunderously. The effete joke in regard to an American
negro's fondness for watermelons was still an admirable pleasantry
to them, and this was not the first time they had engaged in
badinage over it. In fact, this venerable survival had formed
between them a friendship of casual roadside quality.</p>

<p>Afterwards Peter went on up the road. He continued to chuckle
until he was far away. He was going to pay a visit to old Alek
Williams, a negro who lived with a large family in a hut clinging
to the side of a mountain. The scattered colony of negroes which
hovered near Whilomville was of interesting origin, being the
result of some contrabands who had drifted as far north as
Whilomville during the great civil war. The descendants of these
adventurers were mainly conspicuous for their bewildering number,
and the facility which they possessed for adding even to this
number. Speaking, for example, of the Jacksons&mdash;one couldn't
hurl a stone into the hills about Whilomville without having it
land on the roof of a hut full of Jacksons. The town reaped little
in labor from these curious suburbs. There were a few men who came
in regularly to work in gardens, to drive teams, to care for
horses, and there were a few women who came in to cook or to wash.
These latter had usually drunken husbands. In the main the colony
loafed in high spirits, and the industrious minority gained no
direct honor from their fellows, unless they spent their earnings
on raiment, in which case they were naturally treated with
distinction. On the whole, the hardships of these people were the
wind, the rain, the snow, and any other physical difficulties which
they could cultivate. About twice a year the lady philanthropists
of Whilomville went up against them, and came away poorer in goods
but rich in complacence. After one of these attacks the colony
would preserve a comic air of rectitude for two days, and then
relapse again to the genial irresponsibility of a crew of
monkeys.</p>

<p>Peter Washington was one of the industrious class who occupied a
position of distinction, for he surely spent his money on personal
decoration. On occasion he could dress better than the Mayor of
Whilomville himself, or at least in more colors, which was the main
thing to the minds of his admirers. His ideal had been the late
gallant Henry Johnson, whose conquests in Watermelon Alley, as well
as in the hill shanties, had proved him the equal if not the
superior of any Pullman-car porter in the country. Perhaps Peter
had too much Virginia laziness and humor in him to be a wholly
adequate successor to the fastidious Henry Johnson, but, at any
rate, he admired his memory so attentively as to be openly termed a
dude by envious people.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i144" src="1403121h-images/i144.jpg" width=
"400" height="318" alt="" name="i144">
</p>

<p class="caption">"HE HEAVED ONE OF HIS EIGHT-OUNCE ROCKS"</p>

<p>On this afternoon he was going to call on old Alek Williams
because Alek's eldest girl was just turned seventeen, and, to
Peter's mind, was a triumph of beauty. He was not wearing his best
clothes, because on his last visit Alek's half-breed hound Susie
had taken occasion to forcefully extract a quite large and valuable
part of the visitor's trousers. When Peter arrived at the end of
the rocky field which contained old Alek's shanty he stooped and
provided himself with several large stones, weighing them carefully
in his hand, and finally continuing his journey with three stones
of about eight ounces each. When he was near the house, three gaunt
hounds, Rover and Carlo and Susie, came sweeping down upon him. His
impression was that they were going to climb him as if he were a
tree, but at the critical moment they swerved and went growling and
snapping around him, their heads low, their eyes malignant. The
afternoon caller waited until Susie presented her side to him, then
he heaved one of his eight-ounce rocks. When it landed, her hollow
ribs gave forth a drumlike sound, and she was knocked sprawling,
her legs in the air. The other hounds at once fled in horror, and
she followed as soon as she was able, yelping at the top of her
lungs. The afternoon caller resumed his march.</p>

<p>At the wild expressions of Susie's anguish old Alek had flung
open the door and come hastily into the sunshine. "Yah, you Suse,
come erlong outa dat now. What fer you&mdash;Oh, how do, how do,
Mist' Wash'ton&mdash;how do?"</p>

<p>"How do, Mist' Willums? I done foun' it necessa'y fer ter
damnearkill dish yer dawg a yourn, Mist' Willums."</p>

<p>"Come in, come in, Mist' Wash'ton. Dawg no 'count, Mist'
Wash'ton." Then he turned to address the unfortunate animal. "Hu't,
did it? Hu't? 'Pears like you gwine dun some saince by time
somebody brek yer back. 'Pears like I gwine club yer inter er
frazzle 'fore you fin' out some saince. Gw'on 'way f'm yah!"</p>

<p>As the old man and his guest entered the shanty a body of black
children spread out in crescent-shape formation and observed Peter
with awe. Fat old Mrs. Williams greeted him turbulently, while the
eldest girl, Mollie, lurked in a corner and giggled with finished
imbecility, gazing at the visitor with eyes that were shy and bold
by turns. She seemed at times absurdly over-confident, at times
foolishly afraid; but her giggle consistently endured. It was a
giggle on which an irascible but right-minded judge would have
ordered her forthwith to be buried alive.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i148" src="1403121h-images/i148.jpg" width=
"300" height="569" alt="" name="i148">
</p>

<p class="caption">"MOLLIE LURKED IN A CORNER AND GIGGLED"</p>

<p>Amid a great deal of hospitable gabbling, Peter was conducted to
the best chair out of the three that the house contained. Enthroned
therein, he made himself charming in talk to the old people, who
beamed upon him joyously. As for Mollie, he affected to be unaware
of her existence. This may have been a method for entrapping the
sentimental interest of that young gazelle, or it may be that the
giggle had worked upon him.</p>

<p>He was absolutely fascinating to the old people. They could talk
like rotary snow-ploughs, and he gave them every chance, while his
face was illumined with appreciation. They pressed him to stay for
supper, and he consented, after a glance at the pot on the stove
which was too furtive to be noted.</p>

<p>During the meal old Alek recounted the high state of Judge
Oglethorpe's kitchen-garden, which Alek said was due to his
unremitting industry and fine intelligence. Alek was a gardener,
whenever impending starvation forced him to cease temporarily from
being a lily of the field.</p>

<p>"Mist' Bryant he suhtainly got er grand gawden," observed
Peter.</p>

<p>"Dat so, dat so, Mist' Wash'ton," assented Alek. "He got fine
gawden."</p>

<p>"Seems like I nev' <i>did</i> see sech mellums, big as er bar'l,
layin' dere. I don't raikon an'body in dish yer county kin hol' it
with Mist' Bryant when comes ter mellums."</p>

<p>"Dat so, Mist' Wash'ton."</p>

<p>They did not talk of watermelons until their heads held nothing
else, as the phrase goes. But they talked of watermelons until,
when Peter started for home that night over a lonely road, they
held a certain dominant position in his mind. Alek had come with
him as far as the fence, in order to protect him from a possible
attack by the mongrels. There they had cheerfully parted, two
honest men.</p>

<p>The night was dark, and heavy with moisture. Peter found it
uncomfortable to walk rapidly. He merely loitered on the road. When
opposite Si Bryant's place he paused and looked over the fence into
the garden. He imagined he could see the form of a huge melon lying
in dim stateliness not ten yards away. He looked at the Bryant
house. Two windows, down-stairs, were lighted. The Bryants kept no
dog, old Si's favorite child having once been bitten by a dog, and
having since died, within that year, of pneumonia.</p>

<p>Peering over the fence, Peter fancied that if any low-minded
night-prowler should happen to note the melon, he would not find it
difficult to possess himself of it. This person would merely wait
until the lights were out in the house, and the people presumably
asleep. Then he would climb the fence, reach the melon in a few
strides, sever the stem with his ready knife, and in a trice be
back in the road with his prize. There need be no noise, and, after
all, the house was some distance.</p>

<p>Selecting a smooth bit of turf, Peter took a seat by the
road-side. From time to time he glanced at the lighted window.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>When Peter and Alek had said good-bye, the old man turned back
in the rocky field and shaped a slow course towards that high dim
light which marked the little window of his shanty. It would be
incorrect to say that Alek could think of nothing but watermelons.
But it was true that Si Bryant's watermelon-patch occupied a
certain conspicuous position in his thoughts.</p>

<p>He sighed; he almost wished that he was again a conscienceless
pickaninny, instead of being one of the most ornate, solemn, and
look-at-me-sinner deacons that ever graced the handle of a
collection-basket. At this time it made him quite sad to reflect
upon his granite integrity. A weaker man might perhaps bow his
moral head to the temptation, but for him such a fall was
impossible. He was a prince of the church, and if he had been nine
princes of the church he could not have been more proud. In fact,
religion was to the old man a sort of personal dignity. And he was
on Sundays so obtrusively good that you could see his sanctity
through a door. He forced it on you until you would have felt its
influence even in a forecastle.</p>

<p>It was clear in his mind that he must put watermelon thoughts
from him, and after a moment he told himself, with much
ostentation, that he had done so. But it was cooler under the sky
than in the shanty, and as he was not sleepy, he decided to take a
stroll down to Si Bryant's place and look at the melons from a
pinnacle of spotless innocence. Reaching the road, he paused to
listen. It would not do to let Peter hear him, because that
graceless rapscallion would probably misunderstand him. But,
assuring himself that Peter was well on his way, he set out,
walking briskly until he was within four hundred yards of Bryant's
place. Here he went to the side of the road, and walked thereafter
on the damp, yielding turf. He made no sound.</p>

<p>He did not go on to that point in the main road which was
directly opposite the water-melon-patch. He did not wish to have
his ascetic contemplation disturbed by some chance wayfarer. He
turned off along a short lane which led to Si Bryant's barn. Here
he reached a place where he could see, over the fence, the faint
shapes of the melons.</p>

<p>Alek was affected. The house was some distance away, there was
no dog, and doubtless the Bryants would soon extinguish their
lights and go to bed. Then some poor lost lamb of sin might come
and scale the fence, reach a melon in a moment, sever the stem with
his ready knife, and in a trice be back in the road with his prize.
And this poor lost lamb of sin might even be a bishop, but no one
would ever know it. Alek singled out with his eye a very large
melon, and thought that the lamb would prove his judgment if he
took that one.</p>

<p>He found a soft place in the grass, and arranged himself
comfortably. He watched the lights in the windows.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It seemed to Peter Washington that the Bryants absolutely
consulted their own wishes in regard to the time for retiring; but
at last he saw the lighted windows fade briskly from left to right,
and after a moment a window on the second floor blazed out against
the darkness. Si was going to bed. In five minutes this window
abruptly vanished, and all the world was night.</p>

<p>Peter spent the ensuing quarter-hour in no mental debate. His
mind was fixed. He was here, and the melon was there. He would have
it. But an idea of being caught appalled him. He thought of his
position. He was the beau of his community, honored right and left.
He pictured the consternation of his friends and the cheers of his
enemies if the hands of the redoubtable Si Bryant should grip him
in his shame.</p>

<p>He arose, and going to the fence, listened. No sound broke the
stillness, save the rhythmical incessant clicking of myriad
insects, and the guttural chanting of the frogs in the reeds at the
lake-side. Moved by sudden decision, he climbed the fence and crept
silently and swiftly down upon the melon. His open knife was in his
hand. There was the melon, cool, fair to see, as pompous in its
fatness as the cook in a monastery.</p>

<p>Peter put out a hand to steady it while he cut the stem. But at
the instant he was aware that a black form had dropped over the
fence lining the lane in front of him and was coming stealthily
towards him. In a palsy of terror he dropped flat upon the ground,
not having strength enough to run away. The next moment he was
looking into the amazed and agonized face of old Alek Williams.</p>

<p>There was a moment of loaded silence, and then Peter was
overcome by a mad inspiration. He suddenly dropped his knife and
leaped upon Alek. "I got che!" he hissed. "I got che! I got che!"
The old man sank down as limp as rags. "I got che! I got che! Steal
Mist' Bryant's mellums, hey?"</p>

<p>Alek, in a low voice, began to beg. "Oh, Mist' Peter Wash'ton,
don' go fer ter be too ha'd on er ole man! I nev' come yere fer ter
steal 'em. 'Deed I didn't, Mist' Wash'ton! I come yere jes fer ter
<i>feel</i> 'em. Oh, please, Mist' Wash'ton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come erlong outa yere, you ol' rip," said Peter, "an' don'
trumple on dese yer baids. I gwine put you wah you won' ketch
col'."</p>

<p>Without difficulty he tumbled the whining Alek over the fence to
the roadway, and followed him with sheriff-like expedition! He took
him by the scruff. "Come erlong, deacon. I raikon I gwine put you
wah you kin pray, deacon. Come erlong, deacon."</p>

<p>The emphasis and reiteration of his layman's title in the church
produced a deadly effect upon Alek. He felt to his marrow the
heinous crime into which this treacherous night had betrayed him.
As Peter marched his prisoner up the road towards the mouth of the
lane, he continued his remarks: "Come erlong, deacon. Nev' see er
man so anxious like erbout er mellum-paitch, deacon. Seem like you
jes must see'em er-growin' an' <i>feel</i> 'em, deacon. Mist'
Bryant he'll be s'prised, deacon, findin' out you come fer ter
<i>feel</i> his mellums. Come erlong, deacon. Mist' Bryant he
expectin' some ole rip like you come soon."</p>

<p>They had almost reached the lane when Alek's cur Susie, who had
followed her master, approached in the silence which attends
dangerous dogs; and seeing indications of what she took to be war,
she appended herself swiftly but firmly to the calf of Peter's left
leg. The m&ecirc;l&eacute;e was short, but spirited. Alek had no
wish to have his dog complicate his already serious misfortunes,
and went manfully to the defence of his captor. He procured a large
stone, and by beating this with both hands down upon the resounding
skull of the animal, he induced her to quit her grip. Breathing
heavily, Peter dropped into the long grass at the road-side. He
said nothing.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">"THE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS LOOKING INTO THE AMAZED
AND AGONIZED FACE OF OLD ALEK"</p>

<p>"Mist' Wash'ton," said Alek at last, in a quavering voice, "I
raikon I gwine wait yere see what you gwine do ter me."</p>

<p>Whereupon Peter passed into a spasmodic state, in which he
rolled to and fro and shook.</p>

<p>"Mist' Wash'ton, I hope dish yer dog 'ain't gone an' give you
fitses?"</p>

<p>Peter sat up suddenly. "No, she 'ain't," he answered; "but she
gin me er big skeer; an' fer yer 'sistance with er cobblestone,
Mist' Willums, I tell you what I gwine do&mdash;I tell you what I
gwine do." He waited an impressive moment. "I gwine 'lease
you!"</p>

<p>Old Alek trembled like a little bush in a wind. "Mist'
Wash'ton?"</p>

<p>Quoth Peter, deliberately, "I gwine 'lease you."</p>

<p>The old man was filled with a desire to negotiate this statement
at once, but he felt the necessity of carrying off the event
without an appearance of haste. "Yes, seh; thank 'e, seh; thank 'e,
Mist' Wash'ton. I raikon I ramble home pressenly." He waited an
interval, and then dubiously said, "Good-evenin', Mist'
Wash'ton."</p>

<p>"Good-evenin', deacon. Don' come foolin' roun' <i>feelin'</i> no
mellums, and I say troof. Good-evenin', deacon."</p>

<p>Alek took off his hat and made three profound bows. "Thank 'e,
seh. Thank 'e, seh. Thank 'e, seh."</p>

<p>Peter underwent another severe spasm, but the old man walked off
towards his home with a humble and contrite heart.</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>The next morning Alek proceeded from his shanty under the
complete but customary illusion that he was going to work. He
trudged manfully along until he reached the vicinity of Si Bryant's
place. Then, by stages, he relapsed into a slink. He was passing
the garden-patch under full steam, when, at some distance ahead of
him, he saw Si Bryant leaning casually on the garden fence.</p>

<p>"Good-mornin', Alek."</p>

<p>"Good-mawnin', Mist' Bryant," answered Alek, with a new
deference. He was marching on, when he was halted by a
word&mdash;"Alek!"</p>

<p>He stopped. "Yes, seh."</p>

<p>"I found a knife this mornin' in th' road," drawled Si, "an' I
thought maybe it was yourn."</p>

<p>Improved in mind by this divergence from the direct line of
attack, Alek stepped up easily to look at the knife. "No, seh," he
said, scanning it as it lay in Si's palm, while the cold steel-blue
eyes of the white man looked down into his stomach, "'tain't no
knife er mine." But he knew the knife. He knew it as if it had been
his mother. And at the same moment a spark flashed through his head
and made wise his understanding. He knew everything. "'Tain't much
of er knife, Mist' Bryant," he said, deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"'Tain't much of a knife, I know that," cried Si, in sudden
heat, "but I found it this mornin' in my
watermelon-patch&mdash;hear?"</p>

<p>"Watahmellum-paitch?" yelled Alek, not astounded.</p>

<p>"Yes, in my watermelon-patch," sneered Si, "an' I think you know
something about it, too!"</p>

<p>"Me?" cried Alek. "Me?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you!" said Si, with icy ferocity. "Yes&mdash;you!" He
had become convinced that Alek was not in any way guilty, but he
was certain that the old man knew the owner of the knife, and so he
pressed him at first on criminal lines. "Alek, you might as well
own up now. You've been meddlin' with my watermelons!"</p>

<p>"Me?" cried Alek again. "Yah's <i>ma</i> knife. I done cah'e it
foh yeahs."</p>

<p>Bryant changed his ways. "Look here, Alek," he said,
confidentially: "I know you and you know me, and there ain't no use
in any more skirmishin'. <i>I</i> know that <i>you</i> know whose
knife that is. Now whose is it?"</p>

<p>This challenge was so formidable in character that Alek
temporarily quailed and began to stammer. "Er&mdash;now&mdash;Mist'
Bryant&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;frien' er mine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know I'm a friend of yours, but," said Bryant, inexorably,
"who owns this knife?"</p>

<p>Alek gathered unto himself some remnants of dignity and spoke
with reproach: "Mist' Bryant, dish yer knife ain' mine."</p>

<p>"No," said Bryant, "it ain't. But you know who it belongs to,
an' I want you to tell me&mdash;quick."</p>

<p>"Well, Mist' Bryant," answered Alek, scratching his wool, "I
won't say 's I <i>do</i> know who b'longs ter dish yer knife, an' I
won't say 's I <i>don't</i>."</p>

<p>Bryant again laughed his Yankee laugh, but this time there was
little humor in it. It was dangerous.</p>

<p>Alek, seeing that he had gotten himself into hot water by the
fine diplomacy of his last sentence, immediately began to flounder
and totally submerge himself. "No, Mist' Bryant," he repeated, "I
won't say 's I <i>do</i> know who b'longs ter dish yer knife, an' I
won't say 's I <i>don't</i>." And he began to parrot this fatal
sentence again and again. It seemed wound about his tongue. He
could not rid himself of it. Its very power to make trouble for him
seemed to originate the mysterious Afric reason for its
repetition.</p>

<p>"Is he a very close friend of yourn?" said Bryant, softly.</p>

<p>"F-frien'?" stuttered Alek. He appeared to weigh this question
with much care. "Well, seems like he <i>was</i> er frien', an' then
agin, it seems like he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It seems like he <i>wasn't</i>?" asked Bryant.</p>

<p>"Yes, seh, jest so, jest so," cried Alek. "Sometimes it seems
like he <i>wasn't</i>. Then agin&mdash;" He stopped for profound
meditation.</p>

<p>The patience of the white man seemed inexhaustible. At length
his low and oily voice broke the stillness. "Oh, well, of course if
he's a friend of yourn, Alek! You know I wouldn't want to make no
trouble for a friend of yourn."</p>

<p>"Yes, seh," cried the negro at once. "He's er frien' er mine. He
is dat."</p>

<p>"Well, then, it seems as if about the only thing to do is for
you to tell me his name so's I can send him his knife, and that's
all there is to it."</p>

<p>Alek took off his hat, and in perplexity ran his hand over his
wool. He studied the ground. But several times he raised his eyes
to take a sly peep at the imperturbable visage of the white man.
"Y&mdash;y&mdash;yes, Mist' Bryant...I raikon dat's erbout all what
kin be done. I gwine tell you who b'longs ter dish yer knife."</p>

<p>"Of course," said the smooth Bryant, "it ain't a very nice thing
to have to do, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, seh," cried Alek, brightly; "I'm gwine tell you, Mist'
Bryant. I gwine tell you erbout dat knife. Mist' Bryant," he asked,
solemnly, "does you know who b'longs ter dat knife?"</p>

<p>"No, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I gwine tell. I gwine tell who, Mr Bryant&mdash;" The old
man drew himself to a stately pose and held forth his arm. "I gwine
tell who, Mist' Bryant, <i>dish yer knife b'longs ter Sam
Jackson</i>!"</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">"THE OLD MAN DREW HIMSELF TO A STATELY POSE"</p>

<p>Bryant was startled into indignation. "Who in hell is Sam
Jackson?" he growled.</p>

<p>"He's a nigger," said Alek, impressively, "and he wuks in er
lumber-yawd up yere in Hoswego."</p>

<h2><a id="IX" name="IX"></a>IX. THE STOVE</h2>

<p>THEY'LL bring her," said Mrs. Trescott, dubiously. Her cousin,
the painter, the bewildered father of the angel child, had written
to say that if they were asked, he and his wife would come to the
Trescotts for the Christmas holidays. But he had not officially
stated that the angel child would form part of the expedition. "But
of course they'll bring her," said Mrs. Trescott to her
husband.</p>

<p>The doctor assented. "Yes, they'll have to bring her. They
wouldn't dare leave New York at her mercy."</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Mrs. Trescott, after a pause, "the neighbors will
be pleased. When they see her they'll immediately lock up their
children for safety."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," said Trescott, "the devastation of the Margate twins
was complete. She can't do that particular thing again. I shall be
interested to note what form her energy will take this time."</p>

<p>"Oh yes! that's it!" cried the wife. "You'll be
<i>interested</i>. You've hit it exactly. You'll be interested to
note what form her energy will take this time. And then, when the
real crisis comes, you'll put on your hat and walk out of the house
and leave <i>me</i> to straighten things out. This is not a
scientific question; this is a practical matter."</p>

<p>"Well, as a practical man, I advocate chaining her out in the
stable," answered the doctor.</p>

<p>When Jimmie Trescott was told that his old flame was again to
appear, he remained calm. In fact, time had so mended his youthful
heart that it was a regular apple of oblivion and peace. Her image
in his thought was as the track of a bird on deep snow&mdash;it was
an impression, but it did not concern the depths. However, he did
what befitted his state. He went out and bragged in the street: "My
cousin is comin' next week f'om New York."..."My cousin is comin'
to-morrow f'om New York."</p>

<p>"Girl or boy?" said the populace, bluntly; but, when
enlightened, they speedily cried, "Oh, we remember <i>her</i>!"
They were charmed, for they thought of her as an outlaw, and they
surmised that she could lead them into a very ecstasy of sin. They
thought of her as a brave bandit, because they had been whipped for
various pranks into which she had led them. When Jimmie made his
declaration, they fell into a state of pleased and shuddering
expectancy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trescott pronounced her point of view: "The child is a nice
child, if only Caroline had some sense. But she hasn't. And Willis
is like a wax figure. I don't see what can be done,
unless&mdash;unless you simply go to Willis and put the whole thing
right at him." Then, for purposes of indication, she improvised a
speech: "Look here, Willis, you've got a little daughter, haven't
you? But, confound it, man, she is not the only girl child ever
brought into the sunlight. There are a lot of children. Children
are an ordinary phenomenon. In China they drown girl babies. If you
wish to submit to this frightful impostor and tyrant, that is all
very well, but why in the name of humanity do you make us submit to
it?"</p>

<p>Doctor Trescott laughed. "I wouldn't dare say it to him."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," said Mrs. Trescott, determinedly, "that is what you
<i>should</i> say to him."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do the slightest good. It would only make him very
angry, and I would lay myself perfectly open to a suggestion that I
had better attend to my own affairs with more rigor."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you are right," Mrs. Trescott again said.</p>

<p>"Why don't you speak to Caroline?" asked the doctor,
humorously.</p>

<p>"Speak to Caroline! Why, I wouldn't for the <i>world</i>! She'd
fly through the roof. She'd snap my head off! Speak to Caroline!
You must be mad!"</p>

<p>One afternoon the doctor went to await his visitors on the
platform of the railway station. He was thoughtfully smiling. For
some quaint reason he was convinced that he was to be treated to a
quick manifestation of little Cora's peculiar and interesting
powers. And yet, when the train paused at the station, there
appeared to him only a pretty little girl in a fur-lined hood, and
with her nose reddening from the sudden cold, and&mdash;attended
respectfully by her parents. He smiled again, reflecting that he
had comically exaggerated the dangers of dear little Cora. It
amused his philosophy to note that he had really been
perturbed.</p>

<p>As the big sleigh sped homeward there was a sudden shrill outcry
from the angel child: "Oh, mamma! mamma! They've forgotten my
stove!"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear; hush!" said the mother. "It's all right."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, mamma, they've forgotten my stove!"</p>

<p>The doctor thrust his chin suddenly out of his top-coat collar.
"Stove?" he said. "Stove? What stove?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just a toy of the child's," explained the mother. "She's
grown so fond of it, she loves it so, that if we didn't take it
everywhere with her she'd suffer dreadfully. So we always bring
it."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the doctor. He pictured a little tin trinket. But
when the stove was really unmasked, it turned out to be an affair
of cast iron, as big as a portmanteau, and, as the stage people
say, practicable. There was some trouble that evening when came the
hour of children's bedtime. Little Cora burst into a wild
declaration that she could not retire for the night unless the
stove was carried up-stairs and placed, at her bedside. While the
mother was trying to dissuade the child, the Trescott's held their
peace and gazed with awe. The incident closed when the lamb-eyed
father gathered the stove in his arms and preceded the angel child
to her chamber.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i174" src="1403121h-images/i174.jpg" width=
"400" height="634" alt="" name="i174">
</p>

<p class="caption">"THE LAMB-EYED FATHER PRECEDED THE ANGEL CHILD
TO HER CHAMBER"</p>

<p>In the morning, Trescott was standing with his back to the
dining room fire, awaiting breakfast, when he heard a noise of
descending guests. Presently the door opened, and the party entered
in regular order. First came the angel child, then the cooing
mother, and last the great painter with his arm full of the stove.
He deposited it gently in a corner, and sighed. Trescott wore a
wide grin.</p>

<p>"What are you carting that thing all over the house for?" he
said, brutally. "Why don't you put it some place where she can play
with it, and leave it there?"</p>

<p>The mother rebuked him with a look. "Well, if it gives her
pleasure, Ned?" she expostulated, softly. "If it makes the child
happy to have the stove with her, why shouldn't she have it?"</p>

<p>"Just so," said the doctor, with calmness.</p>

<p>Jimmie's idea was the roaring fireplace in the cabin of the lone
mountaineer. At first he was not able to admire a girl's stove
built on well-known domestic lines. He eyed it and thought it was
very pretty, but it did not move him immediately. But a certain
respect grew to an interest, and he became the angel child's
accomplice. And even if he had not had an interest grow upon him,
he was certain to have been implicated sooner or later, because of
the imperious way of little Cora, who made a serf of him in a few
swift sentences. Together they carried the stove out into the
desolate garden and squatted it in the snow. Jimmie's snug little
muscles had been pitted against the sheer nervous vigor of this
little golden-haired girl, and he had not won great honors. When
the mind blazed inside the small body, the angel child was pure
force. She began to speak: "Now, Jim, get some paper. Get some
wood-little sticks at first. Now we want a match. You got a match?
Well, go get a match. Get some more wood. Hurry up, now! No.
<i>No!</i> I'll light it my own self. You get some more wood.
There! Isn't that splendid? You get a whole lot of wood an' pile it
up here by the stove. An' now what'll we cook? We must have
somethin' to cook, you know, else it ain't like the real."</p>

<p>"Potatoes," said Jimmie, at once.</p>

<p>The day was clear, cold, bright. An icy wind sped from over the
waters of the lake. A grown person would hardly have been abroad
save on compulsion of a kind, and yet, when they were called to
luncheon, the two little simpletons protested with great cries.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The ladies of Whilomville were somewhat given to the pagan habit
of tea parties. When a tea party was to befall a certain house one
could read it in the manner of the prospective hostess, who for
some previous days would go about twitching this and twisting that,
and dusting here and polishing there; the ordinary habits of the
household began then to disagree with her, and her unfortunate
husband and children fled to the lengths of their tethers. Then
there was a hush. Then there was a tea party. On the fatal
afternoon a small picked company of latent enemies would meet.
There would be a fanfare of affectionate greetings, during which
everybody would measure to an inch the importance of what everybody
else was wearing. Those who wore old dresses would wish then that
they had not come; and those who saw that, in the company, they
were well clad, would be pleased or exalted, or filled with the
joys of cruelty. Then they had tea, which was a habit and a delight
with none of them, their usual beverage being coffee with milk.</p>

<p>Usually the party jerked horribly in the beginning, while the
hostess strove and pulled and pushed to make its progress smooth.
Then suddenly it would be off like the wind, eight, fifteen, or
twenty-five tongues clattering, with a noise like a cotton-mill
combined with the noise of a few penny whistles. Then the hostess
had nothing to do but to look glad, and see that everybody had
enough tea and cake. When the door was closed behind the last
guest, the hostess would usually drop into a chair and say: "Thank
Heaven! They're gone!" There would be no malice in this expression.
It simply would be that, womanlike, she had flung herself headlong
at the accomplishment of a pleasure which she could not even
define, and at the end she felt only weariness.</p>

<p>The value and beauty, or oddity, of the tea-cups was another
element which entered largely into the spirit of these terrible
enterprises. The quality of the tea was an element which did not
enter at all. Uniformly it was rather bad. But the cups! Some of
the more ambitious people aspired to have cups each of a different
pattern, possessing, in fact, the sole similarity that with their
odd curves and dips of form they each resembled anything but a
teacup. Others of the more ambitious aspired to a quite severe and
godly "set," which, when viewed, appalled one with its austere and
rigid family resemblances, and made one desire to ask the hostess
if the teapot was not the father of all the little cups, and at the
same time protesting gallantly that such a young and charming
cream-jug surely could not be their mother.</p>

<p>But of course the serious part is that these collections so
differed in style and the obvious amount paid for them that nobody
could be happy. The poorer ones envied; the richer ones feared; the
poorer ones continually striving to overtake the leaders; the
leaders always with their heads turned back to hear overtaking
footsteps. And none of these things here written did they know.
Instead of seeing that they were very stupid, they thought they
were very fine. And they gave and took heart-bruises&mdash;fierce,
deep heart-bruises&mdash;under the clear impression that of such
kind of rubbish was the kingdom of nice people. The characteristics
of outsiders of course emerged in shreds from these tea parties,
and it is doubtful if the characteristics of insiders escaped
entirely. In fact, these tea parties were in the large way the
result of a conspiracy of certain unenlightened people to make life
still more uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trescott was in the circle of tea-fighters largely through
a sort of artificial necessity&mdash;a necessity, in short, which
she had herself created in a spirit of femininity.</p>

<p>When the painter and his family came for the holidays, Mrs.
Trescott had for some time been feeling that it was her turn to
give a tea party, and she was resolved upon it now that she was
reinforced by the beautiful wife of the painter, whose charms would
make all the other women feel badly. And Mrs. Trescott further
resolved that the affair should be notable in more than one way.
The painter's wife suggested that, as an innovation, they give the
people good tea; but Mrs. Trescott shook her head; she was quite
sure they would not like it.</p>

<p>It was an impressive gathering. A few came to see if they could
not find out the faults of the painter's wife, and these, added to
those who would have attended even without that attractive
prospect, swelled the company to a number quite large for
Whilomville. There were the usual preliminary jolts, and then
suddenly the tea party was in full swing, and looked like an
unprecedented success.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trescott exchanged a glance with the painter's wife. They
felt proud and superior. This tea party was almost perfection.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Jimmie and the angel child, after being oppressed by innumerable
admonitions to behave correctly during the afternoon, succeeded in
reaching the garden, where the stove awaited them. They were
enjoying themselves grandly, when snow began to fall so heavily
that it gradually dampened their ardor as well as extinguished the
fire in the stove. They stood ruefully until the angel child
devised the plan of carrying the stove into the stable, and there,
safe from the storm, to continue the festivities. But they were met
at the door of the stable by Peter Washington.</p>

<p>"What you 'bout, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;it's snowin' so hard, we thought we'd take the stove
into the stable."</p>

<p>"An' have er fiah in it? No, seh! G'w'on 'way f'm
heh!&mdash;g'w'on! Don' 'low no sech foolishin' round yer. No,
seh!"</p>

<p>"Well, we ain't goin' to hurt your old stable, are we?" asked
Jimmie, ironically.</p>

<p>"Dat you ain't, Jim! Not so long's I keep my two eyes right
plumb squaah pinted at ol' Jim. No, seh!" Peter began to chuckle in
derision.</p>

<p>The two vagabonds stood before him while he informed them of
their iniquities as well as their absurdities, and further made
clear his own masterly grasp of the spirit of their devices.
Nothing affects children so much as rhetoric. It may not involve
any definite presentation of common-sense, but if it is picturesque
they surrender decently to its influence. Peter was by all means a
rhetorician, and it was not long before the two children had
dismally succumbed to him. They went away.</p>

<p>Depositing the stove in the snow, they straightened to look at
each other. It did not enter either head to relinquish the idea of
continuing the game. But the situation seemed invulnerable.</p>

<p>The angel child went on a scouting tour. Presently she returned,
flying. "I know! Let's have it in the cellar! In the cellar! Oh,
it'll be lovely!"</p>

<p>The outer door of the cellar was open, and they proceeded down
some steps with their treasure. There was plenty of light; the
cellar was high-walled, warm, and dry. They named it an ideal
place. Two huge cylindrical furnaces were humming away, one at
either end. Overhead the beams detonated with the different
emotions which agitated the tea party.</p>

<p>Jimmie worked like a stoker, and soon there was a fine bright
fire in the stove. The fuel was of small brittle sticks which did
not make a great deal of smoke.</p>

<p>"Now what'll we cook?" cried little Cora. "What'll we cook, Jim?
We must have something to cook, you know."</p>

<p>"Potatoes?" said Jimmie.</p>

<p>But the angel child made a scornful gesture. "No. I've cooked
'bout a million potatoes, I guess. Potatoes aren't nice any
more."</p>

<p>Jimmie's mind was all said and done when the question of
potatoes had been passed, and he looked weakly at his
companion.</p>

<p>"Haven't you got any turnips in your house?" she inquired,
contemptuously. "In <i>my</i> house we have <i>turnips</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, turnips!" exclaimed Jimmie, immensely relieved to find that
the honor of his family was safe. "Turnips? Oh, bushels an' bushels
an' bushels! Out in the shed."</p>

<p>"Well, go an' get a whole lot," commanded the angel child. "Go
an' get a whole lot. Grea' big ones. <i>We</i> always have grea'
big ones."</p>

<p>Jimmie went to the shed and kicked gently at a company of
turnips which the frost had amalgamated. He made three journeys to
and from the cellar, carrying always the very largest types from
his father's store. Four of them filled the oven of little Cora's
stove. This fact did not please her, so they placed three rows of
turnips on the hot top. Then the angel child, profoundly moved by
an inspiration, suddenly cried out,</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmie, let's play we're keepin' a hotel, an' have got to
cook for 'bout a thousand people, an' those two furnaces will be
the ovens, an' I'll be the chief cook&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; I want to be chief cook some of the time," interrupted
Jimmie.</p>

<p>"No; I'll be chief cook my own self. You must be my 'sistant.
Now I'll prepare 'em&mdash;see? An' then you put 'em in the ovens.
Get the shovel. We'll play that's the pan. I'll fix 'em, an' then
you put 'em in the oven. Hold it still now."</p>

<p>Jim held the coal-shovel while little Cora, with a frown of
importance, arranged turnips in rows upon it. She patted each one
daintily, and then backed away to view it, with her head critically
sideways.</p>

<p>"There!" she shouted at last. "That'll do, I guess. Put 'em in
the oven."</p>

<p>Jimmie marched with his shovelful of turnips to one of the
furnaces. The door was already open, and he slid the shovel in upon
the red coals.</p>

<p>"Come on," cried little Cora. "I've got another batch nearly
ready."</p>

<p>"But what am I goin' to do with these?" asked Jimmie. "There
ain't only one shovel."</p>

<p>"Leave 'm in there," retorted the girl, passionately. "Leave 'm
in there, an' then play you're comin' with another pan. 'Tain't
right to stand there an' <i>hold</i> the pan, you goose."</p>

<p>So Jimmie expelled all his turnips from his shovel out upon the
furnace fire, and returned obediently for another batch.</p>

<p>"These are puddings," yelled the angel child, gleefully. "Dozens
an' dozens of puddings for the thousand people at our grea' big
hotel."</p>

<p>IV</p>

<p>At the first alarm the painter had fled to the doctor's office,
where he hid his face behind a book and pretended that he did not
hear the noise of feminine revelling. When the doctor came from a
round of calls, he too retreated upon the office, and the men
consoled each other as well as they were able. Once Mrs. Trescott
dashed in to say delightedly that her tea party was not only the
success of the season, but it was probably the very nicest tea
party that had ever been held in Whilomville. After vainly
beseeching them to return with her, she dashed away again, her face
bright with happiness.</p>

<p>The doctor and the painter remained for a long time in silence,
Trescott tapping reflectively upon the window-pane. Finally he
turned to the painter, and sniffing, said: "What is that, Willis?
Don't you smell something?"</p>

<p>The painter also sniffed. "Why, yes! It's like&mdash;it's like
turnips."</p>

<p>"Turnips? No; it can't be.</p>

<p>"Well, it's very much like it."</p>

<p>The puzzled doctor opened the door into the hall, and at first
it appeared that he was going to give back two paces. A result of
frizzling turnips, which was almost as tangible as mist, had blown
in upon his face and made him gasp. "Good God! Willis, what can
this be?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Whee!" said the painter. "It's awful, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The doctor made his way hurriedly to his wife, but before he
could speak with her he had to endure the business of greeting a
score of women. Then he whispered, "Out in the hall there's an
awful&mdash;"</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">"THE SOLEMN ODOR OF BURNING TURNIPS ROLLED IN
LIKE A SEA-FOG"</p>

<p>But at that moment it came to them on the wings of a sudden
draught. The solemn odor of burning turnips rolled in like a
sea-fog, and fell upon that dainty, perfumed tea party. It was
almost a personality; if some unbidden and extremely odious guest
had entered the room, the effect would have been much the same. The
sprightly talk stopped with a jolt, and people looked at each
other. Then a few brave and considerate persons made the usual
attempt to talk away as if nothing had happened. They all looked at
their hostess, who wore an air of stupefaction.</p>

<p>The odor of burning turnips grew and grew. To Trescott it seemed
to make a noise. He thought he could hear the dull roar of this
outrage. Under some circumstances he might have been able to take
the situation from a point of view of comedy, but the agony of his
wife was too acute, and, for him, too visible. She was saying:
"Yes, we saw the play the last time we were in New York. I liked it
very much. That scene in the second act&mdash;the gloomy church,
you know, and all that&mdash;and the organ playing&mdash;and then
when the four singing little girls came in&mdash;" But Trescott
comprehended that she did not know if she was talking of a play or
a parachute.</p>

<p>He had not been in the room twenty seconds before his brow
suddenly flushed with an angry inspiration. He left the room
hastily, leaving behind him an incoherent phrase of apology, and
charged upon his office, where he found the painter somnolent.</p>

<p>"Willis!" he cried, sternly, "come with me. It's that damn kid
of yours!"</p>

<p>The painter was immediately agitated. He always seemed to feel
more than any one else in the world the peculiar ability of his
child to create resounding excitement, but he seemed always to
exhibit his feelings very late. He arose hastily, and hurried after
Trescott to the top of the inside cellar stairway. Trescott
motioned him to pause, and for an instant they listened.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, Jim," cried the busy little Cora. "Here's another
whole batch of lovely puddings. Hurry up now, an' put 'em in the
oven."</p>

<p>Trescott looked at the painter; the painter groaned. Then they
appeared violently in the middle of the great kitchen of the hotel
with a thousand people in it. "Jimmie, go up-stairs!" said
Trescott, and then he turned to watch the painter deal with the
angel child.</p>

<p>With some imitation of wrath, the painter stalked to his
daughter's side and grasped her by the arm.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i192" src="1403121h-images/i192.jpg" width=
"400" height="297" alt="" name="i192">
</p>

<p class="caption">"'HERE'S ANOTHER BATCH OF LOVELY PUDDINGS'"</p>

<p>"Oh, papa! papa!" she screamed. "You're pinching me! You're
pinching me! You're pinching me, papa!"</p>

<p>At first the painter had seemed resolved to keep his grip, but
suddenly he let go her arm in a panic. "I've hurt her," he said,
turning to Trescott.</p>

<p>Trescott had swiftly done much towards the obliteration of the
hotel kitchen, but he looked up now and spoke, after a short period
of reflection. "You've hurt her, have you? Well, hurt her again.
Spank her!" he cried, enthusiastically. "Spank her, confound you,
man! She needs it. Here's your chance. Spank her, and spank her
good. Spank her!"</p>

<p>The painter naturally wavered over this incendiary proposition,
but at last, in one supreme burst of daring, he shut his eyes and
again grabbed his precious offspring.</p>

<p>The spanking was lamentably the work of a perfect bungler. It
couldn't have hurt at all; but the angel child raised to heaven a
loud, clear soprano howl that expressed the last word in even
medi&aelig;val anguish. Soon the painter was aghast. "Stop it,
darling! I didn't mean&mdash;I didn't mean to&mdash;to hurt you so
much, you know." He danced nervously. Trescott sat on a box, and
devilishly smiled.</p>

<p>But the pasture call of suffering motherhood came down to them,
and a moment later a splendid apparition appeared on the cellar
stairs. She understood the scene at a glance. "Willis! What have
you been doing?"</p>

<p>Trescott sat on his box, the painter guiltily moved from foot to
foot, and the angel child advanced to her mother with arms
outstretched, making a piteous wail of amazed and pained pride that
would have moved Peter the Great. Regardless of her frock, the
panting mother knelt on the stone floor and took her child to her
bosom, and looked, then, bitterly, scornfully, at the cowering
father and husband.</p>

<p>The painter, for his part, at once looked reproachfully at
Trescott, as if to say: "There! You see?"</p>

<p>Trescott arose and extended his hands in a quiet but magnificent
gesture of despair and weariness. He seemed about to say something
classic, and, quite instinctively, they waited. The stillness was
deep, and the wait was longer than a moment. "Well," he said, "we
can't live in the cellar. Let's go up-stairs."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="X" name="X"></a>X. THE TRIAL, EXECUTION, AND BURIAL OF
HOMER PHELPS</h2>

<p>FROM time to time an enwearied pine bough let fall to the earth
its load of melting snow, and the branch swung back glistening in
the faint wintry sunlight. Down the gulch a brook clattered amid
its ice with the sound of a perpetual breaking of glass. All the
forest looked drenched and forlorn.</p>

<p>The sky-line was a ragged enclosure of gray cliffs and hemlocks
and pines. If one had been miraculously set down in this gulch one
could have imagined easily that the nearest human habitation was
hundreds of miles away, if it were not for an old half-discernible
wood-road that led towards the brook.</p>

<p>"Halt! Who's there?"</p>

<p>This low and gruff cry suddenly dispelled the stillness which
lay upon the lonely gulch, but the hush which followed it seemed
even more profound. The hush endured for some seconds, and then the
voice of the challenger was again raised, this time with a
distinctly querulous note in it.</p>

<p>"Halt! Who's there? Why don't you answer when I holler? Don't
you know you're likely to get shot?"</p>

<p>A second voice answered, "Oh, you knew who I was easy
enough."</p>

<p>"That don't make no diff'rence." One of the Margate twins
stepped from a thicket and confronted Homer Phelps on the old
wood-road. The majestic scowl of official wrath was upon the brow
of Reeves Margate, a long stick was held in the hollow of his arm
as one would hold a rifle, and he strode grimly to the other boy.
"That don't make no diff'rence. You've got to answer when I holler,
anyhow. Willie says so."</p>

<p>At the mention of the dread chieftain's name the Phelps boy
daunted a trifle, but he still sulkily murmured, "Well, you knew it
was me."</p>

<p>He started on his way through the snow, but the twin sturdily
blocked the path. "You can't pass less'n you give the
countersign."</p>

<p>"Huh?" said the Phelps boy. "Countersign?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;countersign," sneered the twin, strong in his sense
of virtue.</p>

<p>But the Phelps boy became very angry. "Can't I, hey? Can't I,
hey? I'll show you whether I can or not! I'll show you, Reeves
Margate!"</p>

<p>There was a short scuffle, and then arose the anguished clamor
of the sentry: "Hey, fellers! Here's a man tryin' to run a-past the
guard. Hey, fellers! Hey!"</p>

<p>There was a great noise in the adjacent underbrush. The voice of
Willie could be heard exhorting his followers to charge swiftly and
bravely. Then they appeared&mdash;Willie Dalzel, Jimmie Trescott,
the other Margate twin, and Dan Earl. The chieftain's face was dark
with wrath. "What's the matter? Can't you play it right? 'Ain't you
got any sense?" he asked the Phelps boy.</p>

<p>The sentry was yelling out his grievance. "Now&mdash;he came
along an' I hollered at 'im, an' he didn't pay no 'tention, an'
when I ast 'im for the countersign, he wouldn't say nothin'. That
ain't no way."</p>

<p>"Can't you play it right?" asked the chief again, with gloomy
scorn.</p>

<p>"He knew it was me easy enough," said the Phelps boy.</p>

<p>"That 'ain't got nothin' to do with it," cried the chief,
furiously. "That 'ain't got nothin' to do with it. If you're goin'
to play, you've got to play it right. It ain't no fun if you go
spoilin' the whole thing this way. Can't you play it right?"</p>

<p>"I forgot the countersign," lied the culprit, weakly.</p>

<p>Whereupon the remainder of the band yelled out, with one
triumphant voice: "War to the knife! War to the knife! I remember
it, Willie. Don't I, Willie?"</p>

<p>The leader was puzzled. Evidently he was trying to develop in
his mind a plan for dealing correctly with this unusual incident.
He felt, no doubt, that he must proceed according to the books, but
unfortunately the books did not cover the point precisely. However,
he finally said to Homer Phelps, "You are under arrest." Then with
a stentorian voice he shouted, "Seize him!"</p>

<p>His loyal followers looked startled for a brief moment, but
directly they began to move upon the Phelps boy. The latter clearly
did not intend to be seized. He backed away, expostulating wildly.
He even seemed somewhat frightened. "No, no; don't you touch me, I
tell you; don't you dare touch me."</p>

<p>The others did not seem anxious to engage. They moved slowly,
watching the desperate light in his eyes. The chieftain stood with
folded arms, his face growing darker and darker with impatience. At
length he burst out: "Oh, seize him, I tell you! Why don't you
seize him? Grab him by the leg, Dannie! Hurry up, all of you! Seize
him, I keep a-say-in'!"</p>

<p>Thus adjured, the Margate twins and Dan Earl made another pained
effort, while Jimmie Trescott man&oelig;uvred to cut off a retreat.
But, to tell the truth, there was a boyish law which held them back
from laying hands of violence upon little Phelps under these
conditions. Perhaps it was because they were only playing, whereas
he was now undeniably serious. At any rate, they looked very sick
of their occupation.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare!" snarled the Phelps boy, facing first one and
then the other; he was almost in tears&mdash;"don't you dare touch
me!"</p>

<p>The chieftain was now hopping with exasperation. "Oh, seize him,
can't you? You're no good at all!" Then he loosed his wrath upon
the Phelps boy: "Stand still, Homer, can't you? You've got to be
seized, you know. That ain't the way. It ain't any fun if you keep
a-dodgin' that way. Stand still, can't you! You've got to be
seized."</p>

<p>"I don't <i>want</i> to be seized," retorted the Phelps boy,
obstinate and bitter.</p>

<p>"But you've <i>got</i> to be seized!" yelled the maddened chief.
"Don't you see? That's the way to play it."</p>

<p>The Phelps boy answered, promptly, "But I don't want to play
that way."</p>

<p>"But that's the <i>right</i> way to play it. Don't you see?
You've got to play it the right way. You've got to be seized, an'
then we'll hold a trial on you, an'&mdash;an' all sorts of
things."</p>

<p>But this prospect held no illusions for the Phelps boy. He
continued doggedly to repeat, "I don't want to play that way!"</p>

<p>Of course in the end the chief stooped to beg and beseech this
unreasonable lad. "Oh, come on, Homer! Don't be so mean. You're
a-spoilin' everything. We won't hurt you any. Not the tintiest bit.
It's all just playin'. What's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>The different tone of the leader made an immediate impression
upon the other. He showed some signs of the beginning of weakness.
"Well," he asked, "what you goin' to do?"</p>

<p>"Why, first we're goin' to put you in a dungeon, or tie you to a
stake, or something like that&mdash;just pertend, you know," added
the chief, hurriedly, "an' then we'll hold a trial, awful solemn,
but there won't be anything what'll hurt you. Not a thing."</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i202" src="1403121h-images/i202.jpg" width=

</p>

<p class="caption">"FROM THIS BOOT HE EMPTIED ABOUT A QUART OF
SNOW"</p>

<p>And so the game was readjusted. The Phelps boy was marched off
between Dan Earl and a Margate twin. The party proceeded to their
camp, which was hidden some hundred feet back in the thickets.
There was a miserable little hut with a pine-bark roof, which so
frankly and constantly leaked that existence in the open air was
always preferable. At present it was noisily dripping melted snow
into the black mouldy interior. In front of this hut a feeble fire
was flickering through its unhappy career. Underfoot, the watery
snow was of the color of lead.</p>

<p>The party having arrived at the camp, the chief leaned against a
tree, and balancing on one foot, drew off a rubber boot. From this
boot he emptied about a quart of snow. He squeezed his stocking,
which had a hole from which protruded a lobster-red toe. He resumed
his boot. "Bring up the prisoner," said he. They did it. "Guilty or
not guilty?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Huh?" said the Phelps boy.</p>

<p>"Guilty or not guilty?" demanded the chief, peremptorily.
"Guilty or not guilty? Don't you understand?"</p>

<p>Homer Phelps looked profoundly puzzled. "Guilty or not guilty?"
he asked, slowly and weakly.</p>

<p>The chief made a swift gesture, and turned in despair to the
others. "Oh, he don't do it right! He does it all wrong!" He again
faced the prisoner with an air of making a last attempt, "Now
look-a-here, Homer, when I say, 'Guilty or not guilty?' you want to
up an' say, 'Not Guilty.' Don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Not guilty," said Homer, at once.</p>

<p>"No, no, no. Wait till I ask you. Now wait." He called out,
pompously, "Pards, if this prisoner before us is guilty, what shall
be his fate?"</p>

<p>All those well-trained little infants with one voice sung out,
"<i>Death!</i>"</p>

<p>"Prisoner," continued the chief, "are you guilty or not
guilty?"</p>

<p>"But look-a-here," argued Homer, "you said it wouldn't be
nothin' that would hurt. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thunder an' lightnin'!" roared the wretched chief. "Keep your
mouth shut, can't ye? What in the mischief&mdash;"</p>

<p>But there was an interruption from Jimmie Trescott, who
shouldered a twin aside and stepped to the front. "Here," he said,
very contemptuously, "let me be the prisoner. I'll show 'im how to
do it."</p>

<p>"All right, Jim," cried the chief, delighted; "you be the
prisoner, then. Now all you fellers with guns stand there in a row!
Get out of the way, Homer!" He cleared his throat, and addressed
Jimmie. "Prisoner, are you guilty or not guilty?"</p>

<p>"Not guilty," answered Jimmie, firmly. Standing there before his
judge&mdash;unarmed, slim, quiet, modest&mdash;he was ideal.</p>

<p>The chief beamed upon him, and looked aside to cast a triumphant
and withering glance upon Homer Phelps. He said: "There! That's the
way to do it."</p>

<p>The twins and Dan Earl also much admired Jimmie.</p>

<p>"That's all right so far, anyhow," said the satisfied chief.
"An' now we'll&mdash;now we'll&mdash;we'll perceed with the
execution."</p>

<p>"That ain't right," said the new prisoner, suddenly. "That ain't
the next thing. You've got to have a trial first. You've got to
fetch up a lot of people first who'll say I done it."</p>

<p>"That's so," said the chief. "I didn't think. Here, Reeves, you
be first witness. Did the prisoner do it?"</p>

<p>The twin gulped for a moment in his anxiety to make the proper
reply. He was at the point where the roads forked. Finally he
hazarded, "Yes."</p>

<p>"There," said the chief, "that's one of 'em. Now, Dan, you be a
witness. Did he do it?"</p>

<p>Dan Earl, having before him the twin's example, did not
hesitate. "Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, then, pards, what shall be his fate?"</p>

<p>Again came the ringing answer, "<i>Death</i>!"</p>

<p>With Jimmie in the principal r&ocirc;le, this drama, hidden deep
in the hemlock thicket neared a kind of perfection. "You must
blind-fold me," cried the condemned lad, briskly, "an' then I'll go
off an' stand, an' you must all get in a row an' shoot me."</p>

<p>The chief gave this plan his urbane countenance, and the twins
and Dan Earl were greatly pleased. They blindfolded Jimmie under
his careful directions. He waded a few paces into snow, and then
turned and stood with quiet dignity, awaiting his fate. The chief
marshalled the twins and Dan Earl in line with their sticks. He
gave the necessary commands: "Load! Ready! Aim! Fire!" At the last
command the firing party all together yelled, "Bang!"</p>

<p>Jimmie threw his hands high, tottered in agony for a moment, and
then crashed full length into the snow&mdash;into, one would think,
a serious case of pneumonia. It was beautiful.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i208" src="1403121h-images/i208.jpg" width=
"400" height="542" alt="" name="i208">
</p>

<p class="caption">THE EXECUTION</p>

<p>He arose almost immediately and came back to them, wondrously
pleased with himself. They acclaimed him joyously.</p>

<p>The chief was particularly grateful. He was always trying to
bring off these little romantic affairs, and it seemed, after all,
that the only boy who could ever really help him was Jimmie
Trescott. "There," he said to the others, "that's the way it ought
to be done."</p>

<p>They were touched to the heart by the whole thing, and they
looked at Jimmie with big, smiling eyes. Jimmie, blown out like a
balloon-fish with pride of his performance, swaggered to the fire
and took seat on some wet hemlock boughs. "Fetch some more wood,
one of you kids," he murmured, negligently. One of the twins came
fortunately upon a small cedar-tree the lower branches of which
were dead and dry. An armful of these branches flung upon the sick
fire soon made a high, ruddy, warm blaze, which was like an
illumination in honor of Jimmie's success.</p>

<p>The boys sprawled about the fire and talked the regular language
of the game. "Waal, pards," remarked the chief, "it's many a night
we've had together here in the Rockies among the b'ars an' the
Indyuns, hey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, pard," replied Jimmie Trescott, "I reckon you're right.
Our wild, free life is&mdash;there ain't nothin' to compare with
our wild, free life."</p>

<p>Whereupon the two lads arose and magnificently shook hands,
while the others watched them in an ecstasy. "I'll allus stick by
ye, pard," said Jimmie, earnestly. "When yer in trouble, don't
forgit that Lightnin' Lou is at yer back."</p>

<p>"Thanky, pard," quoth Willie Dalzel, deeply affected. "I'll not
forgit it, pard. An' don't you forgit, either, that Dead-shot
Demon, the leader of the Red Raiders, never forgits a friend."</p>

<p>But Homer Phelps was having none of this great fun. Since his
disgraceful refusal to be seized and executed he had been hovering
unheeded on the outskirts of the band. He seemed very sorry; he
cast a wistful eye at the romantic scene. He knew too well that if
he went near at that particular time he would be certain to
encounter a pitiless snubbing. So he vacillated modestly in the
background.</p>

<p>At last the moment came when he dared venture near enough to the
fire to gain some warmth, for he was now bitterly suffering with
the cold. He sidled close to Willie Dalzel. No one heeded him.
Eventually he looked at his chief, and with a bright face said,</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;if I was seized now to be executed, I could do it as
well as Jimmie Trescott, I could."</p>

<p>The chief gave a crow of scorn, in which he was followed by the
other'boys. "Ho!" he cried, "why didn't you do it, then? Why didn't
you do it?" Homer Phelps felt upon him many pairs of disdainful
eyes. He wagged his shoulders in misery.</p>

<p>"You're dead," said the chief, frankly. "That's what you are. We
executed you, we did."</p>

<p>"When?" demanded the Phelps boy, with some spirit.</p>

<p>"Just a little while ago. Didn't we, fellers? Hey, fellers,
didn't we?"</p>

<p>The trained chorus cried: "Yes, of course we did. You're dead,
Homer. You can't play any more. You're dead."</p>

<p>"That wasn't me. It was Jimmie Trescott," he said, in a low and
bitter voice, his eyes on the ground. He would have given the world
if he could have retracted his mad refusals of the early part of
the drama.</p>

<p>"No," said the chief, "it was you. We're playin' it was you, an'
it <i>was</i> you. You're dead, you are." And seeing the cruel
effect of his words, he did not refrain from administering some
advice: "The next time, don't be such a chuckle-head."</p>

<p>Presently the camp imagined that it was attacked by Indians, and
the boys dodged behind trees with their stick-rifles, shouting out,
"Bang!" and encouraging each other to resist until the last. In the
mean time the dead lad hovered near the fire, looking moodily at
the gay and exciting scene. After the fight the gallant defenders
returned one by one to the fire, where they grandly clasped hands,
calling each other "old pard," and boasting of their deeds.</p>

<p>Parenthetically, one of the twins had an unfortunate
inspiration. "I killed the Indy-un chief, fellers. Did you see me
kill the Indy-un chief?"</p>

<p>But Willie Dalzel, his own chief, turned upon him wrathfully:
"<i>You</i> didn't kill no chief. <i>I</i> killed 'im with me own
hand."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the twin, apologetically, at once. "It must have been
some other Indy-un."</p>

<p>"Who's wounded?" cried Willie Dalzel. "Ain't anybody wounded?"
The party professed themselves well and sound. The roving and
inventive eye of the chief chanced upon Homer Phelps. "Ho! Here's a
dead man! Come on, fellers, here's a dead man! We've got to bury
him, you know." And at his bidding they pounced upon the dead
Phelps lad. The unhappy boy saw clearly his road to rehabilitation,
but mind and body revolted at the idea of burial, even as they had
revolted at the thought of execution. "No!" he said, stubbornly.
"No! I don't want to be buried! I don't want to be buried!"</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i214" src="1403121h-images/i214.jpg" width=
"400" height="274" alt="" name="i214">
</p>

<p class="caption">THE FUNERAL ORATION</p>

<p>"You've <i>got</i> to be buried!" yelled the chief,
passionately. "'Tain't goin' to hurt ye, is it? Think you're made
of glass? Come on, fellers, get the grave ready!"</p>

<p>They scattered hemlock boughs upon the snow in the form of a
rectangle, and piled other boughs near at hand. The victim surveyed
these preparations with a glassy eye. When all was ready, the chief
turned determinedly to him: "Come on now, Homer. We've got to carry
you to the grave. Get him by the legs, Jim!"</p>

<p>Little Phelps had now passed into that state which may be
described as a curious and temporary childish fatalism. He still
objected, but it was only feeble muttering, as if he did not know
what he spoke. In some confusion they carried him to the rectangle
of hemlock boughs and dropped him. Then they piled other boughs
upon him until he was not to be seen. The chief stepped forward to
make a short address, but before proceeding with it he thought it
expedient, from certain indications, to speak to the grave itself.
"Lie still, can't ye? Lie still until I get through." There was a
faint movement of the boughs, and then a perfect silence.</p>

<p>The chief took off his hat. Those who watched him could see that
his face was harrowed with emotion. "Pards," he began,
brokenly&mdash;"pards, we've got one more debt to pay them
murderin' red-skins. Bowie-knife Joe was a brave man an' a good
pard, but&mdash;he's gone now&mdash;gone." He paused for a moment,
overcome, and the stillness was only broken by the deep manly grief
of Jimmie Trescott.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="XI" name="XI"></a>XI. THE FIGHT</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>THE child life of the neighborhood was sometimes moved in its
deeps at the sight of wagon-loads of furniture arriving in front of
some house which, with closed blinds and barred doors, had been for
a time a mystery, or even a fear. The boys often expressed this
fear by stamping bravely and noisily on the porch of the house, and
then suddenly darting away with screams of nervous laughter, as if
they expected to be pursued by something uncanny. There was a group
who held that the cellar of a vacant house was certainly the abode
of robbers, smugglers, assassins, mysterious masked men in council
about the dim rays of a candle, and possessing skulls, emblematic
bloody daggers, and owls. Then, near the first of April, would come
along a wagon-load of furniture, and children would assemble on the
walk by the gate and make serious examination of everything that
passed into the house, and taking no thought whatever of masked
men.</p>

<p>One day it was announced in the neighborhood that a family was
actually moving into the Hannigan house, next door to Dr.
Trescott's. Jimmie was one of the first to be informed, and by the
time some of his friends came dashing up he was versed in much.</p>

<p>"Any boys?" they demanded, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Jimmie, proudly. "One's a little feller, and
one's most as big as me. I saw 'em, I did."</p>

<p>"Where are they?" asked Willie Dalzel, as if under the
circumstances he could not take Jimmie's word, but must have the
evidence of his senses.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're in there," said Jimmie, carelessly. It was evident
he owned these new boys.</p>

<p>Willie Dalzel resented Jimmie's proprietary way.</p>

<p>"Ho!" he cried, scornfully. "Why don't they come out, then? Why
don't they come out?"</p>

<p>"How d' I know?" said Jimmie.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i220" src="1403121h-images/i220.jpg" width=

</p>

<p class="caption">"STAMPING BRAVELY AND NOISILY ON THE PORCH"</p>

<p>"Well," retorted Willie Dalzel, "you seemed to know so
thundering much about 'em."</p>

<p>At the moment a boy came strolling down the gravel walk which
led from the front door to the gate. He was about the height and
age of Jimmie Trescott, but he was thick through the chest and had
fat legs. His face was round and rosy and plump, but his hair was
curly black, and his brows were naturally darkling, so that he
resembled both a pudding and a young bull.</p>

<p>He approached slowly the group of older inhabitants, and they
had grown profoundly silent. They looked him over; he looked them
over. They might have been savages observing the first white man,
or white men observing the first savage. The silence held
steady.</p>

<p>As he neared the gate the strange boy wandered off to the left
in a definite way, which proved his instinct to make a circular
voyage when in doubt. The motionless group stared at him. In time
this unsmiling scrutiny worked upon him somewhat, and he leaned
against the fence and fastidiously examined one shoe.</p>

<p>In the end Willie Dalzel authoritatively broke the stillness.
"What's your name?" said he, gruffly.</p>

<p>"Johnnie Hedge 'tis," answered the new boy. Then came another
great silence while Whilomville pondered this intelligence.</p>

<p>Again came the voice of authority&mdash;"Where'd you live
b'fore?"</p>

<p>"Jersey City."</p>

<p>These two sentences completed the first section of the formal
code. The second section concerned itself with the establishment of
the new-comer's exact position in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"I kin lick you," announced Willie Dalzel, and awaited the
answer.</p>

<p>The Hedge boy had stared at Willie Dalzel, but he stared at him
again. After a pause he said, "I know you kin."</p>

<p>"Well," demanded Willie, "kin <i>he</i> lick you?" And he
indicated Jimmie Trescott with a sweep which announced plainly that
Jimmie was the next in prowess.</p>

<p>Whereupon the new boy looked at Jimmie respectfully but
carefully, and at length said, "I dun'no'."</p>

<p>This was the signal for an outburst of shrill screaming, and
everybody pushed Jimmie forward. He knew what he had to say, and,
as befitted the occasion, he said it fiercely: "Kin you lick
me?"</p>

<p>The new boy also understood what he had to say, and, despite his
unhappy and lonely state, he said it bravely: "Yes."</p>

<p>"Well," retorted Jimmie, bluntly, "come out and do it, then!
Jest come out and do it!" And these words were greeted with cheers.
These little rascals yelled that there should be a fight at once.
They were in bliss over the prospect. "Go on, Jim! Make 'im come
out. He said he could lick you. Aw-aw-aw! He said he could lick
you!" There probably never was a fight among this class in
Whilomville which was not the result of the goading and guying of
two proud lads by a populace of urchins who simply wished to see a
show.</p>

<p>Willie Dalzel was very busy. He turned first to the one and then
to the other. "You said you could lick him. Well, why don't you
come out and do it, then? You said you could lick him, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the new boy, dogged and dubious.</p>

<p>Willie tried to drag Jimmie by the arm. "Aw, go on, Jimmie! You
ain't afraid, are you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jimmie.</p>

<p>The two victims opened wide eyes at each other. The fence
separated them, and so it was impossible for them to immediately
engage; but they seemed to understand that they were ultimately to
be sacrificed to the ferocious aspirations of the other boys, and
each scanned the other to learn something of his spirit. They were
not angry at all. They were merely two little gladiators who were
being clamorously told to hurt each other. Each displayed
hesitation and doubt without displaying fear. They did not exactly
understand what were their feelings, and they moodily kicked the
ground and made low and sullen answers to Willie Dalzel, who worked
like a circus-manager.</p>

<p>"Aw, go on, Jim! What's the matter with you? You ain't afraid,
are you? Well, then, say something." This sentiment received more
cheering from the abandoned little wretches who wished to be
entertained, and in this cheering there could be heard notes of
derision of Jimmie Trescott. The latter had a position to sustain;
he was well known; he often bragged of his willingness and ability
to thrash other boys; well, then, here was a boy of his size who
said that he could not thrash him. What was he going to do about
it? The crowd made these arguments very clear, and repeated them
again and again.</p>

<p>Finally Jimmie, driven to aggression, walked close to the fence
and said to the new boy, "The first time I catch you out of your
own yard I'll lam the head off'n you!" This was received with wild
plaudits by the Whilomville urchins.</p>

<p>But the new boy stepped back from the fence. He was awed by
Jimmie's formidable mien. But he managed to get out a semi-defiant
sentence. "Maybe you will, and maybe you won't," said he.</p>

<p>However, his short retreat was taken as a practical victory for
Jimmie, and the boys hooted him bitterly. He remained inside the
fence, swinging one foot and scowling, while Jimmie was escorted
off down the street amid acclamations. The new boy turned and
walked back towards the house, his face gloomy, lined deep with
discouragement, as if he felt that the new environment's antagonism
and palpable cruelty were sure to prove too much for him.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The mother of Johnnie Hedge was a widow, and the chief theory of
her life was that her boy should be in school on the greatest
possible number of days. He himself had no sympathy with this
ambition, but she detected the truth of his diseases with an
unerring eye, and he was required to be really ill before he could
win the right to disregard the first bell, morning and noon. The
chicken-pox and the mumps had given him vacations&mdash;vacations
of misery, wherein he nearly died between pain and nursing. But bad
colds in the head did nothing for him, and he was not able to
invent a satisfactory hacking cough. His mother was not
consistently a tartar. In most things he swayed her to his will. He
was allowed to have more jam, pickles, and pie than most boys; she
respected his profound loathing of Sunday-school; on summer
evenings he could remain out-of-doors until 8.30; but in this
matter of school she was inexorable. This single point in her
character was of steel.</p>

<p>The Hedges arrived in Whilomville on a Saturday, and on the
following Monday Johnnie wended his way to school with a note to
the principal and his Jersey City school-books. He knew perfectly
well that he would be told to buy new and different books, but in
those days mothers always had an idea that old books would "do,"
and they invariably sent boys off to a new school with books which
would not meet the selected and unchangeable views of the new
administration. The old books never would "do." Then the boys
brought them home to annoyed mothers and asked for ninety cents or
sixty cents or eighty-five cents or some number of cents for
another outfit. In the garret of every house holding a large family
there was a collection of effete school-books, with mother
rebellious because James could not inherit his books from Paul, who
should properly be Peter's heir, while Peter should be a
beneficiary under Henry's will.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i228" src="1403121h-images/i228.jpg" width=
"400" height="364" alt="" name="i228">
</p>

<p class="caption">"'THE FIRST TIME I CATCH YOU I'LL LAM THE HEAD
OFF'N YOU'"</p>

<p>But the matter of the books was not the measure of Johnnie
Hedge's unhappiness. This whole business of changing schools was a
complete torture. Alone he had to go among a new people, a new
tribe, and he apprehended his serious time. There were only two
fates for him. One meant victory. One meant a kind of serfdom in
which he would subscribe to every word of some superior boy and
support his every word. It was not anything like an English system
of fagging, because boys invariably drifted into the figurative
service of other boys whom they devotedly admired, and if they were
obliged to subscribe to everything, it is true that they would have
done so freely in any case. One means to suggest that Johnnie Hedge
had to find his place. Willie Dalzel was a type of the little
chieftain, and Willie was a master, but he was not a bully in a
special physical sense. He did not drag little boys by the ears
until they cried, nor make them tearfully fetch and carry for him.
They fetched and carried, but it was because of their worship of
his prowess and genius. And so all through the strata of boy life
were chieftains and subchieftains and assistant subchieftains.
There was no question of little Hedge being towed about by the
nose; it was, as one has said, that he had to find his place in a
new school. And this in itself was a problem which awed his boyish
heart. He was a stranger cast away upon the moon. None knew him,
understood him, felt for him. He would be surrounded for this
initiative time by a horde of jackal creatures who might turn out
in the end to be little boys like himself, but this last point his
philosophy could not understand in its fulness.</p>

<p>He came to a white meeting-house sort of a place, in the squat
tower of which a great bell was clanging impressively. He passed
through an iron gate into a play-ground worn bare as the bed of a
mountain brook by the endless runnings and scufflings of little
children. There was still a half-hour before the final clangor in
the squat tower, but the play-ground held a number of frolicsome
imps. A loitering boy espied Johnnie Hedge, and he howled: "Oh! oh!
Here's a new feller! Here's a new feller!" He advanced upon the
strange arrival. "What's your name?" he demanded, belligerently,
like a particularly offensive custom-house officer.</p>

<p>"Johnnie Hedge," responded the new-comer, shyly.</p>

<p>This name struck the other boy as being very comic. All new
names strike boys as being comic. He laughed noisily.</p>

<p>"Oh, fellers, he says his name is Johnnie Hedge! Haw! haw!
haw!"</p>

<p>The new boy felt that his name was the most disgraceful thing
which had ever been attached to a human being.</p>

<p>"Johnnie Hedge! Haw! haw! What room you in?" said the other
lad.</p>

<p>"I dun'no'," said Johnnie. In the mean time a small flock of
interested vultures had gathered about him. The main thing was his
absolute strangeness. He even would have welcomed the sight of his
tormentors of Saturday; he had seen them before at least. These
creatures were only so many incomprehensible problems. He
diffidently began to make his way towards the main door of the
school, and the other boys followed him. They demanded
information.</p>

<p>"Are you through subtraction yet? We study jogerfre&mdash;did
you, ever? You live here now? You goin' to school here now?"</p>

<p>To many questions he made answer as well as the clamor would
permit, and at length he reached the main door and went quaking
unto his new kings. As befitted them, the rabble stopped at the
door. A teacher strolling along a corridor found a small boy
holding in his hand a note. The boy palpably did not know what to
do with the note, but the teacher knew, and took it. Thereafter
this little boy was in harness.</p>

<p>A splendid lady in gorgeous robes gave him a seat at a double
desk, at the end of which sat a hoodlum with grimy finger-nails,
who eyed the inauguration with an extreme and personal curiosity.
The other desks were gradually occupied by children, who first were
told of the new boy, and then turned upon him a speculative and
somewhat derisive eye. The school opened; little classes went
forward to a position in front of the teacher's platform and tried
to explain that they knew something. The new boy was not
requisitioned a great deal; he was allowed to lie dormant until he
became used to the scenes and until the teacher found,
approximately, his mental position. In the mean time he suffered a
shower of stares and whispers and giggles, as if he were a man-ape,
whereas he was precisely like other children. From time to time he
made funny and pathetic little overtures to other boys, but these
overtures could not yet be received; he was not known; he was a
foreigner. The village school was like a nation. It was tight. Its
amiability or friendship must be won in certain ways.</p>

<p>At recess he hovered in the school-room around the weak lights
of society and around the teacher, in the hope that somebody might
be good to him, but none considered him save as some sort of a
specimen. The teacher of course had a secondary interest in the
fact that he was an additional one to a class of sixty-three.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock, when the ordered files of boys and girls
marched towards the door, he exhibited&mdash;to no eye&mdash;the
tremblings of a coward in a charge. He exaggerated the lawlessness
of the play-ground and the street.</p>

<p>But the reality was hard enough. A shout greeted him:</p>

<p>"Oh, here's the new feller! Here's the new feller!"</p>

<p>Small and utterly obscure boys teased him. He had a hard time of
it to get to the gate. There never was any actual hurt, but
everything was competent to smite the lad with shame. It was a
curious, groundless shame, but nevertheless it was shame. He was a
new-comer, and he definitely felt the disgrace of the fact. In the
street he was seen and recognized by some lads who had formed part
of the group of Saturday. They shouted:</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmie! Jimmie! Here he is! Here's that new feller!"</p>

<p>Jimmie Trescott was going virtuously towards his luncheon when
he heard these cries behind him. He pretended not to hear, and in
this deception he was assisted by the fact that he was engaged at
the time in a furious argument with a friend over the relative
merits of two "Uncle Tom's Cabin" companies. It appeared that one
company had only two bloodhounds, while the other had ten. On the
other hand, the first company had two Topsys and two Uncle Toms,
while the second had only one Topsy and one Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>But the shouting little boys were hard after him. Finally they
were even pulling at his arms.</p>

<p>"Jimmie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" he demanded, turning with a snarl. "What d'you want?
Leggo my arm!"</p>

<p>"Here he is! Here's the new feller! Here's the new feller!
Now!"</p>

<p>"I don't care if he is," said Jimmie, with grand impatience. He
tilted his chin. "I don't care if he is."</p>

<p>Then they reviled him. "Thought you was goin' to lick him first
time you caught him! Yah! You're a 'fraid-cat!" They began to sing
"'Fraid-cat! 'Fraidcat! 'Fraid-cat!" He expostulated hotly, turning
from one to the other, but they would not listen. In the mean time
the Hedge boy slunk on his way, looking with deep anxiety upon this
attempt to send Jimmie against him. But Jimmie would have none of
the plan.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>When the children met again on the play-ground, Jimmie was
openly challenged with cowardice. He had made a big threat in the
hearing of comrades, and when invited by them to take advantage of
an opportunity, he had refused. They had been fairly sure of their
amusement, and they were indignant. Jimmie was finally driven to
declare that as soon as school was out for the day, he would thrash
the Hedge boy.</p>

<p>When finally the children came rushing out of the iron gate,
filled with the delights of freedom, a hundred boys surrounded
Jimmie in high spirits, for he had said that he was determined.
They waited for the lone lad from Jersey City. When he appeared,
Jimmie wasted no time. He walked straight to him and said, "Did you
say you kin lick me?"</p>

<p>Johnnie Hedge was cowed, shrinking, affrighted, and the roars of
a hundred boys thundered in his ears, but again he knew what he had
to say. "Yes," he gasped, in anguish.</p>

<p>"Then," said Jimmie, resolutely, "you've got to fight." There
was a joyous clamor by the mob. The beleaguered lad looked this way
and that way for succor, as Willie Dalzel and other officious
youngsters policed an irregular circle in the crowd. He saw Jimmie
facing him; there was no help for it; he dropped his
books&mdash;the old books which would not "do."</p>

<p>Now it was the fashion among tiny Whilomville belligerents to
fight much in the manner of little bear cubs. Two boys would rush
upon each other, immediately grapple, and&mdash;the best boy having
probably succeeded in getting the coveted "under hold"&mdash;there
would presently be a crash to the earth of the inferior boy, and he
would probably be mopped around in the dust, or the mud, or the
snow, or whatever the material happened to be, until the engagement
was over. Whatever havoc was dealt out to him was ordinarily the
result of his wild endeavors to throw off his opponent and arise.
Both infants wept during the fight, as a common thing, and if they
wept very hard, the fight was a harder fight. The result was never
very bloody, but the complete dishevelment of both victor and
vanquished was extraordinary. As for the spectacle, it more
resembled a collision of boys in a fog than it did the manly art of
hammering another human being into speechless inability.</p>

<p>The fight began when Jimmie made a mad, bear-cub rush at the new
boy, amid savage cries of encouragement. Willie Dalzel, for
instance, almost howled his head off. Very timid boys on the
outskirts of the throng felt their hearts leap to their throats. It
was a time when certain natures were impressed that only man is
vile.</p>

<p>But it appeared that bear-cub rushing was no part of the
instruction received by boys in Jersey City. Boys in Jersey City
were apparently schooled curiously. Upon the onslaught of Jimmie,
the stranger had gone wild with rage&mdash;boylike. Some spark had
touched his fighting-blood, and in a moment he was a cornered,
desperate, fire-eyed little man. He began to swing his arms, to
revolve them so swiftly that one might have considered him a small,
working model of an extra-fine patented windmill which was caught
in a gale. For a moment this defence surprised Jimmie more than it
damaged him, but two moments later a small, knotty fist caught him
squarely in the eye, and with a shriek he went down in defeat. He
lay on the ground so stunned that he could not even cry; but if he
had been able to cry, he would have cried over his
prestige&mdash;or something&mdash;not over his eye.</p>

<p>There was a dreadful tumult. The boys cast glances of amazement
and terror upon the victor, and thronged upon the beaten Jimmie
Trescott. It was a moment of excitement so intense that one cannot
say what happened. Never before had Whilomville seen such a
thing&mdash;not the little tots. They were aghast, dumfounded, and
they glanced often over their shoulders at the new boy, who stood
alone, his clinched fists at his side, his face crimson, his lips
still working with the fury of battle.</p>

<p>But there was another surprise for Whilomville. It might have
been seen that the little victor was silently debating against an
impulse.</p>

<p class="cp"><img id="i240" src="1403121h-images/i240.jpg" width=
"400" height="551" alt="" name="i240">
</p>

<p class="caption">"NO TIME FOR ACADEMICS&mdash;HE RAN"</p>

<p>But the impulse won, for the lone lad from Jersey City suddenly
wheeled, sprang like a demon, and struck another boy.</p>

<p>A curtain should be drawn before this deed. A knowledge of it is
really too much for the heart to bear. The other boy was Willie
Dalzel. The lone lad from Jersey City had smitten him full
sore.</p>

<p>There is little to say of it. It must have been that a feeling
worked gradually to the top of the little stranger's wrath that
Jimmie Trescott had been a mere tool, that the front and centre of
his persecutors had been Willie Dalzel, and being rendered
temporarily lawless by his fighting-blood, he raised his hand and
smote for revenge.</p>

<p>Willie Dalzel had been in the middle of a vandal's cry, which
screeched out over the voices of everybody. The new boy's fist cut
it in half, so to say. And then arose the howl of an amazed and
terrorized walrus.</p>

<p>One wishes to draw a second curtain. Without discussion or
inquiry or brief retort, Willie Dalzel ran away. He ran like a hare
straight for home, this redoubtable chieftain. Following him at a
heavy and slow pace ran the impassioned new boy. The scene was long
remembered.</p>

<p>Willie Dalzel was no coward; he had been panic-stricken into
running away from a new thing. He ran as a man might run from the
sudden appearance of a vampire or a ghoul or a gorilla. This was no
time for academics&mdash;he ran.</p>

<p>Jimmie slowly gathered himself and came to his feet. "Where's
Willie?" said he, first of all. The crowd sniggered. "Where's
Willie?" said Jimmie again.</p>

<p>"Why, he licked him <i>too</i>!" answered a boy suddenly.</p>

<p>"He did?" said Jimmie. He sat weakly down on the roadway. "He
did?" After allowing a moment for the fact to sink into him, he
looked up at the crowd with his one good eye and his one bunged
eye, and smiled cheerfully.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="XII" name="XII"></a>XII. THE CITY URCHIN AND THE CHASTE
VILLAGERS</h2>

<p>AFTER the brief encounters between the Hedge boy and Jimmie
Trescott and the Hedge boy and Willie Dalzel, the neighborhood
which contained the homes of the boys was, as far as child life is
concerned, in a state resembling anarchy. This was owing to the
signal overthrow and shameful retreat of the boy who had for
several years led a certain little clan by the nose. The adherence
of the little community did not go necessarily to the boy who could
whip all the others, but it certainly could not go to a boy who had
run away in a manner that made his shame patent to the whole world.
Willie Dalzel found himself in a painful position. This tiny tribe
which had followed him with such unwavering faith was now largely
engaged in whistling and catcalling and hooting. He chased a number
of them into the sanctity of their own yards, but from these coigns
they continued to ridicule him.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that the fickle tribe went over in a
body to the new light. They did nothing of the sort. They occupied
themselves with avenging all which they had endured&mdash;gladly
enough, too&mdash;for many months. As for the Hedge boy, he
maintained a curious timid reserve, minding his own business with
extreme care, and going to school with that deadly punctuality of
which his mother was the genius. Jimmie Trescott suffered no
adverse criticism from his fellows. He was entitled to be beaten by
a boy who had made Willie Dalzel bellow like a bull-calf and run
away. Indeed, he received some honors. He had confronted a very
superior boy and received a bang in the eye which for a time was
the wonder of the children, and he had not bellowed like a
bull-calf. As a matter of fact, he was often invited to tell how it
had felt, and this he did with some pride, claiming arrogantly that
he had been superior to any particular pain.</p>

<p>Early in the episode he and the Hedge boy had patched up a
treaty. Living next door to each other, they could not fail to have
each other often in sight. One afternoon they wandered together in
the strange indefinite diplomacy of boyhood. As they drew close the
new boy suddenly said, "Napple?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jimmie, and the new boy bestowed upon him an apple.
It was one of those green-coated winter-apples which lie for many
months in safe and dry places, and can at any time be brought forth
for the persecution of the unwary and inexperienced. An older age
would have fled from this apple, but to the unguided youth of
Jimmie Trescott it was a thing to be possessed and cherished.
Wherefore this apple was the emblem of something more than a truce,
despite the fact that it tasted like wet Indian meal; and Jimmie
looked at the Hedge boy out of one good eye and one bunged eye. The
long-drawn animosities of men have no place in the life of a boy.
The boy's mind is flexible; he readjusts his position with an ease
which is derived from the fact&mdash;simply&mdash;that he is not
yet a man.</p>

<p>But there were other and more important matters. Johnnie Hedge's
exploits had brought him into such prominence among the school-boys
that it was necessary to settle a number of points once and for
all. There was the usual number of boys in the school who were
popularly known to be champions in their various classes. Among
these Johnnie Hedge now had to thread his way, every boy taking it
upon himself to feel anxious that Johnnie's exact position should
be soon established. His fame as a fighter had gone forth to the
world, but there were other boys who had fame as fighters, and the
world was extremely anxious to know where to place the new-comer.
Various heroes were urged to attempt this classification. Usually
it was not accounted a matter of supreme importance, but in this
boy life it was essential.</p>

<p>In all cases the heroes were backward enough. It was their
followings who agitated the question. And so Johnnie Hedge was more
or less beset.</p>

<p>He maintained his bashfulness. He backed away from altercation.
It was plain that to bring matters to a point he must be forced
into a quarrel. It was also plain that the proper person for the
business was some boy who could whip Willie Dalzel, and these
formidable warriors were distinctly averse to undertaking the new
contract. It is a kind of a law in boy life that a quiet, decent,
peace-loving lad is able to thrash a wide-mouthed talker. And so it
had transpired that by a peculiar system of elimination most of the
real chiefs were quiet, decent, peace-loving boys, and they had no
desire to engage in a fight with a boy on the sole grounds that it
was not known who could whip. Johnnie Hedge attended his affairs,
they attended their affairs, and around them waged this discussion
of relative merit. Jimmie Trescott took a prominent part in these
arguments. He contended that Johnnie Hedge could thrash any boy in
the world. He was certain of it, and to any one who opposed him he
said, "You just get one of those smashes in the eye, and then
you'll see." In the mean time there was a grand and impressive
silence in the direction of Willie Dalzel. He had gathered remnants
of his clan, but the main parts of his sovereignty were scattered
to the winds. He was an enemy.</p>

<p>Owing to the circumspect behavior of the new boy, the commotions
on the school grounds came to nothing. He was often asked, "Kin you
lick him?" And he invariably replied, "I dun'no'." This idea of
waging battle with the entire world appalled him.</p>

<p>A war for complete supremacy of the tribe which had been headed
by Willie Dalzel was fought out in the country of the tribe. It
came to pass that a certain half-dime blood-and-thunder pamphlet
had a great vogue in the tribe at this particular time. This story
relates the experience of a lad who began his career as cabin-boy
on a pirate ship. Throughout the first fifteen chapters he was
rope's-ended from one end of the ship to the other end, and very
often he was felled to the deck by a heavy fist. He lived through
enough hardships to have killed a battalion of Turkish soldiers,
but in the end he rose upon them. Yes, he rose upon them. Hordes of
pirates fell before his intrepid arm, and in the last chapters of
the book he is seen jauntily careering on his own hook as one of
the most gallous pirate captains that ever sailed the seas.</p>

<p>Naturally, when this tale was thoroughly understood by the
tribe, they had to dramatize it, although it was a dramatization
that would gain no royalties for the author. Now it was plain that
the urchin who was cast for the cabin-boy's part would lead a life
throughout the first fifteen chapters which would attract few
actors. Willie Dalzel developed a scheme by which some small lad
would play cabin-boy during this period of misfortune and abuse,
and then, when the cabin-boy came to the part where he slew all his
enemies and reached his zenith, that he, Willie Dalzel, should take
the part.</p>

<p>This fugitive and disconnected rendering of a great play opened
in Jimmie Trescott's back garden. The path between the two lines of
gooseberry-bushes was elected unanimously to be the ship. Then
Willie Dalzel insisted that Homer Phelps should be the cabin-boy.
Homer tried the position for a time, and then elected that he would
resign in favor of some other victim. There was no other applicant
to succeed him, whereupon it became necessary to press some boy.
Jimmie Trescott was a great actor, as is well known, but he
steadfastly refused to engage for the part. Ultimately they seized
upon little Dan Earl, whose disposition was so milky and docile
that he would do whatever anybody asked of him. But Dan Earl made
the one firm revolt of his life after trying existence as cabin-boy
for some ten minutes. Willie Dalzel was in despair. Then he
suddenly sighted the little brother of Johnnie Hedge, who had come
into the garden, and in a poor-little-stranger sort of fashion was
looking wistfully at the play. When he was invited to become the
cabin-boy he accepted joyfully, thinking that it was his initiation
into the tribe. Then they proceeded to give him the rope's end and
to punch him with a realism which was not altogether painless.
Directly he began to cry out. They exhorted him not to cry out, not
to mind it, but still they continued to hurt him.</p>

<p>There was a commotion among the gooseberry-bushes, two branches
were swept aside, and Johnnie Hedge walked down upon them. Every
boy stopped in his tracks. Johnnie was boiling with rage.</p>

<p>"Who hurt him?" he said, ferociously. "Did <i>you</i>?" He had
looked at Willie Dalzel.</p>

<p>Willie Dalzel began to mumble: "We was on'y playin'. Wasn't
nothin' fer him to cry fer."</p>

<p>The new boy had at his command some big phrases, and he used
them. "I am goin' to whip you within an inch of your life. I am
goin' to tan the hide off'n you." And immediately there was a
mixture&mdash;an infusion of two boys which looked as if it had
been done by a chemist. The other children stood back, stricken
with horror. But out of this whirl they presently perceived the
figure of Willie Dalzel seated upon the chest of the Hedge boy.</p>

<p>"Got enough?" asked Willie, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"No," choked out the Hedge boy. Then there was another flapping
and floundering, and finally another calm.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">"'WHO HURT HIM?' HE SAID FEROCIOUSLY"</p>

<p>"Got enough?" asked Willie.</p>

<p>"No," said the Hedge boy. A sort of war-cloud again puzzled the
sight of the observers. Both combatants were breathless, bloodless
in their faces, and very weak.</p>

<p>"Got enough?" said Willie.</p>

<p>"No," said the Hedge boy. The carnage was again renewed. All the
spectators were silent but Johnnie Hedge's little brother, who
shrilly exhorted him to continue the struggle. But it was not plain
that the Hedge boy needed any encouragement, for he was crying
bitterly, and it has been explained that when a boy cried it was a
bad time to hope for peace. He had managed to wriggle over upon his
hands and knees. But Willie Dalzel was tenaciously gripping him
from the back, and it seemed that his strength would spend itself
in futility. The bear cub seemed to have the advantage of the
working model of the windmill. They heaved, uttered strange words,
wept, and the sun looked down upon them with steady, unwinking
eye.</p>

<p>Peter Washington came out of the stable and observed this
tragedy of the back garden. He stood transfixed for a moment, and
then ran towards it, shouting: "Hi! What's all dish yere? Hi!
Stopper dat, stopper dat, you two! For lan' sake, what's all dish
yere?" He grabbed the struggling boys and pulled them apart. He was
stormy and fine in his indignation. "For lan' sake! You two kids
act like you gwine mad dogs. Stopper dat!" The whitened, tearful,
soiled combatants, their clothing all awry, glared fiercely at each
other as Peter stood between them, lecturing. They made several
futile attempts to circumvent him and again come to battle. As he
fended them off with his open hands he delivered his reproaches at
Jimmie. "I's s'prised at <i>you</i>! I suhtainly is!"</p>

<p>"Why?" said Jimmie. "I 'ain't done nothin'. What have I
done?"</p>

<p>"Y-y-you done 'courage dese yere kids ter scrap," said Peter,
virtuously.</p>

<p>"Me?" cried Jimmie. "I 'ain't had nothin' to do with it."</p>

<p>"I raikon you 'ain't," retorted Peter, with heavy sarcasm. "I
raikon you been er-prayin', 'ain't you?" Turning to Willie Dalzel,
he said, "You jest take an' run erlong outer dish yere or I'll jest
nachually take an' damnearkill you." Willie Dalzel went. To the new
boy Peter said: "You look like you had some saince, but I raikon
you don't know no more'n er rabbit. You jest take an' trot erlong
off home, an' don' lemme caitch you round yere er-fightin' or I'll
break yer back." The Hedge boy moved away with dignity, followed by
his little brother. The latter, when he had placed a sufficient
distance between himself and Peter, played his fingers at his nose
and called out:</p>

<p class="caption">"'NIG-GER-R-R! NIG-GER-R-R!'"</p>

<p>"Nig-ger-r-r! Nig-ger-r-r!"</p>

<p>Peter Washington's resentment poured out upon Jimmie.</p>

<p>"'Pears like you never would understan' you ain't reg'lar common
trash. You take an' 'sociate with an'body what done come
erlong."</p>

<p>"Aw, go on," retorted Jimmie, profanely. "Go soak your head,
Pete."</p>

<p>The remaining boys retired to the street, whereupon they
perceived Willie Dalzel in the distance. He ran to them.</p>

<p>"I licked him!" he shouted, exultantly. "I licked him! Didn't I,
now?"</p>

<p>From the Whilomville point of view he was entitled to a
favorable answer. They made it. "Yes," they said, "you did."</p>

<p>"I run in," cried Willie, "an' I grabbed 'im, an' afore he knew
what it was I throwed 'im. An' then it was easy." He puffed out his
chest and smiled like an English recruiting-sergeant. "An' now,"
said he, suddenly facing Jimmie Trescott, "whose side were you
on?"</p>

<p>The question was direct and startling. Jimmie gave back two
paces. "He licked you once," he explained, haltingly.</p>

<p>"He never saw the day when he could lick one side of me. I could
lick him with my left hand tied behind me. Why, I could lick him
when I was asleep." Willie Dalzel was magnificent.</p>

<p>A gate clicked, and Johnnie Hedge was seen to be strolling
towards them.</p>

<p>"You said," he remarked, coldly, "you licked me, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>Willie Dalzel stood his ground. "Yes," he said, stoutly.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a liar," said the Hedge boy.</p>

<p>"You're another," retorted Willie.</p>

<p>"No, I ain't, either, but <i>you're</i> a liar."</p>

<p>"You're another," retorted Willie.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare tell <i>me</i> I'm a liar, or I'll smack your
mouth for you," said the Hedge boy.</p>

<p>"Well, I did, didn't I?" barked Willie. "An' whatche goin' to do
about it?"</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to lam you," said the Hedge boy.</p>

<p>He approached to attack warily, and the other boys held their
breaths. Willie Dalzel winced back a pace. "Hol' on a minute," he
cried, raising his palm. "I'm not&mdash;"</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">"ONE APPROACHING FROM BEHIND LAID HOLD OF HIS
EAR"</p>

<p>But the comic windmill was again in motion, and between gasps
from his exertions Johnnie Hedge remarked, "I'll
show&mdash;you&mdash;whether&mdash;you kin&mdash;lick me&mdash;or
not."</p>

<p>The first blows did not reach home on Willie, for he backed away
with expedition, keeping up his futile cry, "Hol' on a minute."
Soon enough a swinging fist landed on his cheek. It did not knock
him down, but it hurt him a little and frightened him a great deal.
He suddenly opened his mouth to an amazing and startling extent,
tilted back his head, and howled, while his eyes, glittering with
tears, were fixed upon this scowling butcher of a Johnnie Hedge.
The latter was making slow and vicious circles, evidently intending
to renew the massacre.</p>

<p>But the spectators really had been desolated and shocked by the
terrible thing which had happened to Willie Dalzel. They now cried
out: "No, no; don't hit 'im any more! Don't hit 'im any more!"</p>

<p>Jimmie Trescott, in a panic of bravery, yelled, "We'll all jump
on you if you do."</p>

<p>The Hedge boy paused, at bay. He breathed angrily, and flashed
his glance from lad to lad. They still protested: "No, no; don't
hit 'im any more. Don't hit 'im no more."</p>

<p>"I'll hammer him until he can't stand up," said Johnnie,
observing that they all feared him. "I'll fix him so he won't know
hisself, an' if any of you kids bother with <i>me</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly he ceased, he trembled, he collapsed. The hand of one
approaching from behind had laid hold upon his ear, and it was the
hand of one whom he knew.</p>

<p>The other lads heard a loud, iron-filing voice say, "Caught ye
at it again, ye brat, ye." They saw a dreadful woman with gray
hair, with a sharp red nose, with bare arms, with spectacles of
such magnifying quality that her eyes shone through them like two
fierce white moons. She was Johnnie Hedge's mother. Still holding
Johnnie by the ear, she swung out swiftly and dexterously, and
succeeded in boxing the ears of two boys before the crowd regained
its presence of mind and stampeded. Yes, the war for supremacy was
over, and the question was never again disputed. The supreme power
was Mrs. Hedge.</p>

<h2><a id="XIII" name="XIII"></a>XIII. A LITTLE PILGRIMAGE</h2>

<p>ONE November it became clear to childish minds in certain parts
of Whilomville that the Sunday-school of the Presbyterian church
would not have for the children the usual tree on Christmas eve.
The funds free for that ancient festival would be used for the
relief of suffering among the victims of the Charleston
earthquake.</p>

<p>The plan had been born in the generous head of the
superintendent of the Sunday-school, and during one session he had
made a strong plea that the children should forego the vain
pleasures of a tree and, in glorious application of the Golden
Rule, refuse a local use of the fund, and will that it be sent
where dire pain might be alleviated. At the end of a tearfully
eloquent speech the question was put fairly to a vote, and the
children in a burst of virtuous abandon carried the question for
Charleston. Many of the teachers had been careful to preserve a
finely neutral attitude, but even if they had cautioned the
children against being too impetuous they could not have checked
the wild impulses.</p>

<p>But this was a long time before Christmas.</p>

<p>Very early, boys held important speech together. "Huh! you ain't
goin' to have no Christmas tree at the Presbyterian
Sunday-school."</p>

<p>Sullenly the victim answered, "No, we ain't."</p>

<p>"Huh!" scoffed the other denomination, "we are goin' to have the
all-firedest biggest tree that you ever saw in the world."</p>

<p>The little Presbyterians were greatly downcast.</p>

<p>It happened that Jimmie Trescott had regularly attended the
Presbyterian Sunday-school. The Trescotts were consistently
undenominational, but they had sent their lad on Sundays to one of
the places where they thought he would receive benefits. However,
on one day in December, Jimmie appeared before his father and made
a strong spiritual appeal to be forthwith attached to the
Sunday-school of the Big Progressive church. Doctor Trescott mused
this question considerably. "Well, Jim," he said, "why do you
conclude that the Big Progressive Sunday-school is better for you
than the Presbyterian Sunday-school?"</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;it's nicer," answered Jimmie, looking at his father
with an anxious eye.</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;now&mdash;some of the boys what go to the
Presbyterian place, they ain't very nice," explained the flagrant
Jimmie.</p>

<p>Trescott mused the question considerably once more. In the end
he said: "Well, you may change if you wish, this one time, but you
must not be changing to and fro. You decide now, and then you must
abide by your decision."</p>

<p>"Yessir," said Jimmie, brightly. "Big Progressive."</p>

<p>"All right," said the father. "But remember what I've told
you."</p>

<p>On the following Sunday morning Jimmie presented himself at the
door of the basement of the Big Progressive church. He was
conspicuously washed, notably raimented, prominently polished. And,
incidentally, he was very uncomfortable because of all these
virtues.</p>

<p>A number of acquaintances greeted him contemptuously. "Hello,
Jimmie! What you doin' here? Thought you was a Presbyterian?"</p>

<p>Jimmie cast down his eyes and made no reply. He was too cowed by
the change. However, Homer Phelps, who was a regular patron of the
Big Progressive Sunday-school, suddenly appeared and said, "Hello,
Jim!" Jimmie seized upon him. Homer Phelps was amenable to Trescott
laws, tribal if you like, but iron-bound, almost compulsory.</p>

<p>"Hello, Homer!" said Jimmie, and his manner was so good that
Homer felt a great thrill in being able to show his superior a new
condition of life.</p>

<p>"You 'ain't never come here afore, have you?" he demanded, with
a new arrogance.</p>

<p>"No, I 'ain't," said Jimmie. Then they stared at each other and
man&oelig;uvred.</p>

<p>"You don't know <i>my</i> teacher," said Homer.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know <i>her</i>" admitted Jimmie, but in a way
which contended, modestly, that he knew countless other
Sunday-school teachers.</p>

<p>"Better join our class," said Homer, sagely. "She wears
spectacles; don't see very well. Sometimes we do almost what we
like."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jimmie, glad to place himself in the hands of
his friends. In due time they entered the Sunday-school room, where
a man with benevolent whiskers stood on a platform and said, "We
will now sing No. 33&mdash;'Pull for the Shore, Sailor, Pull for
the Shore.'" And as the obedient throng burst into melody the man
on the platform indicated the time with a fat, white, and graceful
hand. He was an ideal Sunday-school superintendent&mdash;one who
had never felt hunger or thirst or the wound of the challenge of
dishonor; a man, indeed, with beautiful flat hands who waved them
in greasy victorious beneficence over a crowd of children.</p>

<p>Jimmie, walking carefully on his toes, followed Homer Phelps. He
felt that the kingly superintendent might cry out and blast him to
ashes before he could reach a chair. It was a desperate journey.
But at last he heard Homer muttering to a young lady, who looked at
him through glasses which greatly magnified her eyes. "A new boy,"
she said, in an oily and deeply religious voice.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Jimmie, trembling. The five other boys of the
class scanned him keenly and derided his condition.</p>

<p>"We will proceed to the lesson," said the young lady. Then she
cried sternly, like a sergeant, "The seventh chapter of
Jeremiah!"</p>

<p>There was a swift fluttering of leaflets. Then the name of
Jeremiah, a wise man, towered over the feelings of these boys.
Homer Phelps was doomed to read the fourth verse. He took a deep
breath, he puffed out his lips, he gathered his strength for a
great effort. His beginning was childishly explosive. He hurriedly
said:</p>

<p>"<i>Trust ye not in lying words, saying The temple of the Lord,
the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are these.</i>"</p>

<p>"Now," said the teacher, "Johnnie Scanlan, tell us what these
words mean." The Scanlan boy shamefacedly muttered that he did not
know. The teacher's countenance saddened. Her heart was in her
work; she wanted to make a success of this Sunday-school class.
"Perhaps Homer Phelps can tell us," she remarked.</p>

<p>Homer gulped; he looked at Jimmie. Through the great room hummed
a steady hum. A little circle, very near, was being told about
Daniel in the lion's den. They were deeply moved. At the moment
they liked Sunday-school.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;now&mdash;it means," said Homer, with a grand
pomposity born of a sense of hopeless ignorance&mdash;"it
means&mdash;why it means that they were in the wrong place."</p>

<p>"No," said the teacher, profoundly; "it means that we should be
good, very good indeed. That is what it means. It means that we
should love the Lord and be good. Love the Lord and be good. That
is what it means."</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">"THE PROFESSIONAL BRIGHT BOY OF THE CLASS
SUDDENLY AWOKE"</p>

<p>The little boys suddenly had a sense of black wickedness as
their teacher looked austerely upon them. They gazed at her with
the wide-open eyes of simplicity. They were stirred again. This
thing of being good&mdash;this great business of
life&mdash;apparently it was always successful. They knew from the
fairy tales. But it was difficult, wasn't it? It was said to be the
most heart-breaking task to be generous, wasn't it? One had to pay
the price of one's eyes in order to be pacific, didn't one? As for
patience, it was tortured martyrdom to be patient, wasn't it? Sin
was simple, wasn't it? But virtue was so difficult that it could
only be practised by heavenly beings, wasn't it?</p>

<p>And the angels, the Sunday-school superintendent, and the
teacher swam in the high visions of the little boys as beings so
good that if a boy scratched his shin in the same room he was a
profane and sentenced devil.</p>

<p>"And," said the teacher, "'The temple of the Lord'&mdash;what
does that mean? I'll ask the new boy. What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"I dun'no'," said Jimmie, blankly.</p>

<p>But here the professional bright boy of the class suddenly awoke
to his obligations. "Teacher," he cried, "it means church, same as
this."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the teacher, deeply satisfied with this reply.
"You know your lesson well, Clarence. I am much pleased."</p>

<p>The other boys, instead of being envious, looked with admiration
upon Clarence, while he adopted an air of being habituated to
perform such feats every day of his life. Still, he was not much of
a boy. He had the virtue of being able to walk on very high stilts,
but when the season of stilts had passed he possessed no rank save
this Sunday-school rank, this clever-little-Clarence business of
knowing the Bible and the lesson better than the other boys. The
other boys, sometimes looking at him meditatively, did not actually
decide to thrash him as soon as he cleared the portals of the
church, but they certainly decided to molest him in such ways as
would re-establish their self-respect. Back of the superintendent's
chair hung a lithograph of the martyrdom of St. Stephen.</p>

<p>Jimmie, feeling stiff and encased in his best clothes, waited
for the ordeal to end. A bell pealed: the fat hand of the
superintendent had tapped a bell. Slowly the rustling and murmuring
dwindled to silence. The benevolent man faced the school. "I have
to announce," he began, waving his body from side to side in the
conventional bows of his kind, "that&mdash;" Bang went the bell.
"Give me your attention, please, children. I have to announce that
the Board has decided that this year there will be no Christmas
tree, but the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Instantly the room buzzed with the subdued clamor of the
children. Jimmie was speechless. He stood morosely during the
singing of the closing hymn. He passed out into the street with the
others, pushing no more than was required.</p>

<p>Speedily the whole idea left him. If he remembered Sunday-school
at all, it was to remember that he did not like it.</p>
