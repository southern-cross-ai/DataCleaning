<hr><h2><a name="ch0"></a>PRELUDE. AN ENGLISH YEAR</h2>

<p>Letters from foreign countries arrive in the afternoon. Each
envelope advertises a break in the monotony of days; each reveals
on penetration only one more facet of a standard world. But
latterly another kind has come, strangely addressed, stranger still
within. "We learn," runs one, "that you are safely returned to your
own glorious country and are already in the midst of your dearest
ones, enjoying the best of health...PS.&mdash;We have experienced
no cold this year hitherto." "I am proud," says another, "that the
all-bountiful God has allowed us to see you again...May he guard
you from all evil, world without end. Send me from England ten
metres of black stuff that I may make a gown." As the unfamiliar
hieroglyphics resolve, memory evokes the senders, their fellows,
and the weeks of their company. Till the whole excursion into their
impalpable world stands defined as the limits of a sleep. But the
experience, being personal, is framed in a larger retrospect. The
colour of their environment lives by contrast with my own. Without
that measure, its romance fades away.</p>

<p>Conveniently, as it happens, the period previous to this
particular adventure from the earth falls within a year. It is
precisely a period; because September witnessed my departure from a
latitude whither, in the August following, I was to return. On the
home journey we travelled from Constantinople; up the Black Sea by
Rumanian boat to Constanza; from there to Bucharest; and on to
Vienna, where an industrial exhibition, housed in three buildings
each larger than the Albert Hall, consisted wholly of saucepans.
There followed a few days in Paris. And so back to England, to a
garden of Michaelmas daisies; with the bracken turning to gold, and
thin blue columns of smoke filling the air with the scent of
burning leaves. Cubbing had begun, disclosing those unknown hours
when the dew sparkles thick in the hazy light and the trees and
plants are twice alive. Ultimately the middle of November brought
an upper floor in London, connected, despite the proximity of the
Marylebone Road, with that zenith of residential snobbery, the
Mayfair telephone exchange.</p>

<p>The house in which body and soul were now enshrouded was kept by
Mrs. Byrne, an Irish Catholic. The upper floor had formerly been
tenanted by a dotard, to whose tappings and ravings came responses
in kind from an incurable ex-officer next door. But his death had
coincided with my return to England. And, needing a room, I was
immediately ensconced upon the bed which for six years had quaked
beneath the struggles of the demented.</p>

<p>The other tenants, as they arrived, proved not less distinctive
than he who had departed. Above, the Misses Jimmie led lives of
mouse-like though sinister seclusion. While below, a Mademoiselle
P&eacute;ron, having a pale face and flamboyant hair, spent such
hours as could be spared from the drama, in pacing the hall,
sparsely wrapped in soiled cretonne. Her pom was the permanent
inmate of this oil-clothed passage, where the air hung thick with
kitchen whiffs and the odour of collected dust. To the intermediate
and "drawing-room" floor she introduced a tenant of her own, an
attach&eacute; at one of the Balkan legations. The common staircase
thus became a channel of turbulent domesticity which spared its
other patrons no embarrassment.</p>

<p>Outside, the fogs rolled up to stay and the organ-grinders
gathered. Through the former only the blurred yellow stars of
answering electric lights proclaimed the street's other wall. Of
the latter there were often two, equidistant, mingling crises of
discord with their own intrinsic melancholy. On alternate
afternoons came an old man with bowler hat and concertina, whose
r&eacute;pertoire, constant through nine months, started with a
Highland jig, and, continuing with "The Lakes of Killarney" and
"The British Grenadiers," ended on "God Save the King." Meals,
other than a greasy breakfast, were to be had near by at a
pleasant, economical restaurant, frequented, as I discovered, by
people who did not wish to be seen. Since I myself, being
inevitably tired and dishevelled, was in a like case, the annoyance
was mutual. Later on, the clientele became uncomfortably swollen
owing to the misadventure of one of the waiters' wives, whose
dismembered person was discovered in a trunk. She had already
forsaken her husband; in which example I had followed her on
account of his persistence in speaking Italian. It was noticeable
that the queue of cars outside the doors of the establishment was
transformed by this circumstance from the &pound;400 to the
&pound;800 class.</p>

<p>Christmas set in early. The small shops sported tinsel and
stockings; the large, elaborate tableaux, ugly fancy dresses, and
bazaars in cotton wool grottoes. In the country, hunt balls began.
Staying in a house for one of them, I found myself alone at
breakfast with a man whom I had previously insulted in print under
the impression he was someone else. I explained this, and then,
since the rest of the party elected to remain in bed till lunch, we
discussed the army and Parliament as alternative careers. Being a
soldier, he maintained that the former offered wider scope. At home
we enjoyed our own ebullient function, attended by flutterings on
behalf of the master's wife, whose official patronage had not been
requested. Apart from the peculiar pasts of those who control them,
the local packs of hounds are distinguished for hunting over
country which contains a larger percentage of wire than any known
area outside New Zealand. This, however, does not save them from
focusing to themselves those latent social aspirations and
malignities which are investing English country life with an
artificiality comparable to that of London, and less excusable. It
seems there are only a few who still comprehend the spirit of the
countryside and the unconscious details that compose it: the trees
and hedges closing to eternal forest in the blue distance; the
whistle of a train down the wind; shadows of clouds running atilt
the fields; the riders on the crest of a hill where a clump of
beeches and a tussocky rampart of prehistory stand between them and
the sky; the stripes of a new-ploughed field glinting in the leaden
dusk of winter sunsets; the reins slipping through sodden gloves;
and at last that elusive shiver, common to all countries, of the
arriving night. The perception of such, of the happiness they give,
is waning. It is the point-to-point that clamours on the morrow.
Bookmakers and fish and chips; snuffling tents; champagne picnics;
tweed skirt and plus four; shooting-stick and glasses; the altitude
of behaviour in a cutting wind. Better take a walk up the back
drive.</p>

<p>In London again, the New Year opened. Resentfully its first
nondescript months allowed the days to lengthen. Birds twittered in
the adjoining square. A dozen daffodils stood above the gas-stove.
It was imperative to seek the country.</p>

<p>Having in past years reached Ireland from Holyhead, the call of
the unknown and the saving of 4s. 6d. now involved a night journey
to Fishguard. The sea was calm; the train beyond, ramshackle and
unreal, empty. Slowly we wound up the coast, the gulls crying
unhappily over the sedges and sad, peaty hills stretching
mysteriously inland. The fields, uneven and gorse-grown, seemed
shrunk between their banks. A salt wind blew cold through the
window. To one released from the turbid interiors of London these
details obtruded themselves. At length the station was reached; a
drive, a bath, and breakfast.</p>

<p>The sun shone, and all varieties of rhododendrons&mdash;huge
clumps, single bushes, and cone-shaped, broad-leaved trees from the
Himalayas&mdash;blazed their permutations of red, white, and
purple. Tree ferns drooped; aloes poised grey armouries above the
lawns; butterflies embarked on tentative flights. The house, of
fabricated stone, sparkled like a porcupine of Gothic quills within
its wooded cup. Beneath the trees, anemones and violets fought the
moss. Primroses were on the banks; wild strawberry flowers between
the brambles in the clearings. The sun lay hot on the face of the
hill, calling the scents of the earth and its buds. Below, the
tree-tops fell down to a river, which reappeared on the horizon to
meet the sea. Here lay the town, Catholic cupola and Protestant
spire distinguishable, with a many-arched bridge at the mouth and
ships at anchor within the mole. Sometimes we motored; but to such
objectives as a spit of sand, or a mountain where gold was found.
At the foot of the latter the chauffeur uttered warning that those
who ascended never returned. Throughout the afternoon we persisted,
plodding from each promised summit to its superior, till there lay
beneath us an enormous tract of land, turbulent and irregular,
without habitation or cultivation, where five years ago the rebels
killed any man who ventured. In the distance the hills rose to
mountains again. Over them a storm was in progress. The colour of
the land, of the sodden heather and soft brown virgin turf, had
risen to the sky. There was a brown in the clouds; a brown in the
gold of the misty rays that pierced them; a brown in the battle of
the wind. Might the chauffeur, perhaps, have been right?</p>

<p>From here, after a day of poignant gloom in Dublin, I travelled
west. The first house had been historically an abbey, displaying
the form of such in every crocket of its eighteenth century
exterior. The second was no less a castle. In the back parts the
marks of Cromwell's cannon balls might still be seen. The
nineteenth century, however, had witnessed a reversion to more
chivalrous methods of defence. Each bedroom had been slitted anew
with openings for the cross-bow; each archway punctured for the
engulfing of unwanted guests in boiling oil. The garden, too, was
peculiar in that not only was it extensively and emotionally
romantic, but was impregnated in addition with the excited phantasy
of the early Victorian engineer. The lake, instead of nestling, as
lakes are wont, in a hollow, hung suspended on a platform. Separate
streams, whose mingling waters might have been the delight of
poets, were carried one above the other. A miniature suspension
bridge, long-previous prototype of Menai and Clifton, spanned
elsewhere the pellucid brook, riven immediately beneath to spume
and roar in imitation of the lately discovered Zambezi. Fringed by
bamboo, narcissi and grape hyacinths flowered in the grass.</p>

<p>It was now my intention to proceed to the north of Scotland. Yet
another valued fraction of life's little day was mouldered in the
Free State capital.[*] At six o'clock I boarded a steamer lying
forlornly in the Liffey. And, after a strange meal of tongue and
khaki pickles, at which the other passengers drank tea, I slept in
solitary peace till awakened by the steward's announcing the banks
of the Clyde. Only he whose reason has survived it, can grasp the
implication of a Glasgow Sunday. To obtain a glass of beer it was
necessary to affirm on paper my bona fides as a traveller and order
a hot omelette. Late in the afternoon of the following day I
arrived in the Highlands, having taken sixty hours to accomplish a
single journey in the British Isles.</p>

<blockquote>[* Travellers are advised to take consolation in a pink
wax bust of Queen Victoria, with tow hair and glass teeth,
exhibited on the ground floor of the Art Gallery.]</blockquote>

<p>The colour of Scotland was the antithesis of Ireland, a liquid
silvery light deepening the purple mountains to damson and the cold
green of pines and firs to an equal tone. Snow lay still along the
summit of the Cairngorms. Over the heather the curlews wailed and
the grouse called, "Go back, go back." On top of the hills, blue
hares scurried in and out of the clouds. A pink granite obelisk
commemorating King Edward's coronation also emerged, strangely
urban at the height of 3,000 feet. At times we fished, struggling
waist-deep in a current that was taking daily toll of similar
invaders. To those who have not previously wielded a salmon rod in
a gale, the experience is a memorable one. Only, however, when a
third suit had been torn from my back by the flies' preference of
tweed to fish, did I retire indoors, to spend the remaining days in
a dinner-jacket.</p>

<p>Once more I returned to London&mdash;to find my sitting-room
transformed, in the exuberance of Mrs. Byrne's good heart, from
dull mustardy yellow to vociferous canary. With May and the coming
of summer a new complexion overspread the routine of days. Pansies
and bachelor's buttons twinkled in shallow boxes outside the
greengrocer's shop on the way to the restaurant. Sunbeams crashed
into the lumber-rooms of the dealers, bringing new life to
furnishings not old enough to be antique. The paving-stones were
hot; the shop-fronts let down sunblinds; from the road came the
smell of basking tar and the fumes of exhausts. And when, having
worked till half-past seven, the hour called to chase the gossamers
of organised pleasure, there was a new thrill in thrusting the
naked bosom of a stiff shirt upon the undarkened summer evening.
The days, aided by the Government, had succeeded after all. Pale
green feathered the tree-tops in the square. Railings and front
doors bore the laconic boards of decorators. Enormous cars bowled
through the streets. It was the Season, unanimously acclaimed, with
the eternal optimism of the Press, as the most brilliant since the
war. D&eacute;butantes were photographed; their idiosyncrasies, pet
lizards and back hairs, noted. In the provinces, tired huzzifs
consumed the details of their waistlines. In London they seemed
frousled and uncouth, either speechless or prisoned in the opposite
extreme of chatter.</p>

<p>An analysis of those metropolitan activities which provide the
newspapers' dessert must infringe the moral copyright of too large
a body of publicists to be attempted. To me, successive evenings
seemed each a compartment; band of ballroom, gramophone of attic;
each a dungeon of stereotyped outlook; one and all attuned to the
quality of the buffet. A face, a charm, might salve the wreckage of
the night; both probably were otherwise employed. Sometimes the
compartments opened into one another, and the party succeeded and
became an entertainment. Old ladies found vodka in the lemon
squash, young ones men whose knowledge of the fox was hatred.
Princesses ate free food that others might honour them with ribbons
and stars. The joined of God came together, though the judge had
put them asunder. Such occasions were rare. But each reinforced
hope eternal of the next. At the brink of all yawned that festal
pit, the night-club. Formerly, in those sparse hours snatched from
the cold years of education, what ecstasy had filled these temples
of illicit bibbing. Now, crouched over the spine of an
eighteen-shilling kipper, the glamour had departed. And there was
the morning to be faced, punctual and sane. Truly, my sympathies
are with the law. Why, then, break it?</p>

<p>At each week-end, each attainment of a garden, the plants had
jumped; some were out, others were dead; there was none of the
customary imperceptible procession. From home I brought boughs of
light green beech, which caught the children's eyes to the taxi
roof, and embowered the room from floor to ceiling with the
freshness of a summer rain. Later came rhododendron and azalea. So
the days lengthened and began to shrink again, till the eve of that
incalculable moment, the eclipse.</p>

<p>My imagination had been fired. People whispered of a great black
shadow that should come rushing over land and sea, trillions of
miles to the minute. It was, they said, a sight that Englishmen had
not witnessed for two centuries, and would not for another one. We
should tell our grandchildren. Determining to tell mine, I
telephoned to the owner of a car. At half-past seven in the evening
we left London for the north.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock when we reached Stamford. Stopping at the
hotel for a slice of ham, we encountered an inebriate cleric, who,
being a guest and therefore able to obtain it after hours, stood us
a whisky each. More, he regaled our meal with tales of his youth;
informed us, &acirc; propos his prowess at the butts, that he had
been a "bogshootah at Caembridge in the year umptah"; and made much
of the fact that in <i>his</i> parish the public-house was kept by
the sacristan's sister, whose respect for the Church permitted her
to take liberties with the law&mdash;one advantage at least of his
profession. He, also, then decided to accompany us to the eclipse;
but became disengaged from the dashboard where he was travelling,
half-way down the High Street. Cheered by this jovial offspring of
a sombre calling, we proceeded to Doncaster. There, in the small
hours of the morning, we fell in behind the rest of England.</p>

<p>It was as though the Germans had landed in the South. Through
the night, headlight to tail, a continuous queue of cars rushed
feverishly towards the Orkneys; cheap cars, sports cars,
limousines; bicycles, motor and push; every variety of wheeled
automaton, directed by every variety of human being, blazing
searchlights, flickering wicks, came tearing in pursuit of this
astronomical phenomenon. By the road meals were cooking, bodies
sleeping, tents encamped, motors overturned. Haggard policemen
waved at corners. In the Yorkshire villages, the cottagers stood at
lighted doors; hotel-keepers beckoned; garage proprietors thanked
God. Viewed from a hill-top, the stream hummed back into the dark,
mile upon mile, like a vast illuminated snake. The first glimmer
filtered up from the Antipodes. We had motored from day to day.
Then the lights of Richmond twinkled in the void. With the rest of
the world, we took to our feet.</p>

<p>Lit by gas flares, we bore with the crowd to the appointed wold.
Only Epsom has witnessed such a scene; and that by day. Beshawled
matrons sold rasping tea with sandwiches that no mouth could
encompass. Boys make jokes. Flappers shrieked. Hawkers bawled the
menace of the <i>corona</i> and the efficacy of smoked celluloid to
preserve the sight. Over the cold, sopping grass we trudged. A
girls' school chattered hysterically on a wall; a widow stood
apart, tense with the weaving of a mystic spell. It was light. Out
of space hailed a friend who had motored with aged mother since
tea-time yesterday, and was this moment arrived. It was lighter. We
waited. We talked. Then the minute of the eclipse began. Half the
hour passed in hopeless commonplace. At length a kind of scenic
effect was set in motion. With a series of jerks the visibility
changed. The cows galloped hither and thither in troubled herds.
The crowd breathed, hallooed, and was silent. The jerks became
quicker; women gulped; parsons expired. Till suddenly a deep blue
veil swept over the country and slowly lifted.</p>

<p>Hurrying down, we breakfasted at York and continued, stupid with
sleep, to a neighbouring house for lunch. There my companion
collapsed. I returned by train.</p>

<p>It was July. Parties had become freakish. Night upon night Mrs.
Byrne stitched me into a new variation on the theme of a pirate
king. Nor was there any symptom of cessation. None the less, nerves
frayed and bank impatient, I decided to exchange the husks of the
swine for more solid comfort. The rooms were re-let. I packed my
chattels into boxes and trunks, suit-cases, cloths, and crates.
And, with nineteen shillings' extra luggage crowded on the taxi, I
bade Mrs. Byrne good-bye as she barred the egress of Mademoiselle
P&eacute;ron's pom upon the doorstep. There followed a month of
peace at home amid the sweet soporific of phloxes, peace such that
no single event has remained to chart it. Till the last days of
preparation and purchase were come.</p>

<p>For through all this English year, a varied complement of days
but coloured with the thread of a discontent, the sunlit image of a
mountain had shone like the star to the wise men. It was arranged,
throughout, that I should return; that I should assume, if only
temporarily, my own enterprise in a world of arid sequences. In
dejection the image had called hope. In presumption, rapture. Now
it was at hand. Content stretched illimitable.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch1"></a>Chapter I. THE LEVANT</h2>

<p>The sun, admitted at eight o'clock, struck the doors of the
cupboard opposite with a meaning that sent a tremor through the
nerves and a ball of air into the pit of the body. Over the bed the
fringes danced response to a quickened heartbeat. For the day of
departure had dawned; day, in another sense, of return.</p>

<p>That afternoon I proceeded to London, and arose next morning to
shop. The manager of that imperial institution, Fortnum and
Mason's, improvised poems on the contents of the saddle-bags. Six
pound tins of chocolate, two of chutney, a syphon brooding like a
hen over its sparklets in a wooden box, pills, toilet requisites
and stationery gradually accrued, together with the ink in a tin
case from which these magic words pour. But to devise chemical
armour against the insects which await with hideous patience the
infrequent tenants of those musty guest-rooms, defied the ingenuity
of every pharmacist from W.2 to E.C.4. I am fortunate, however, in
possessing some revolting physical attribute, which prevents me,
though not impervious to tickling, from being bitten.</p>

<p>At 10.51 on Friday, August 12th, I left Victoria, surrounded by
suit-case, kit-bag, saddle-bags, hat-box (harbouring, besides a
panama, towels and pillow-cases), syphon-box, and a smug
despatch-case that contained a lesser known Edgar Wallace and
credentials to every grade of foreign dignitary, from the Customs
to the higher clergy. Only as the train started did I discover the
loss of the keys to these receptacles. Fortunately the carpenter of
the Channel boat was able to provide substitutes for all but the
suit-case. Meanwhile, troubles fell away as the pages of perhaps
the greatest master of English fiction disclosed the appalling
misdemeanours of Harry Alford, 18th Earl of Chelford. These were
tempered with the items of the <i>Central European Observer</i>, a
periodical new to my journalistic appetite, whose title had peeped
like a succulent strawberry from a cabbage-bed of Liberal weeklies
and Conservative quarterlies.</p>

<p>The Channel was rough; but with the undoing of the luggage, the
plying of the carpenter with beer, and the delightful spectacle of
an arrogant humanity draped about the seats in green and helpless
confusion, the passage passed unnoticed. Happiness untrammelled was
restored at the sight of the rotund coaches of the <i>Train
Bleu</i>. For itinerant comfort, the palm must ever remain with
this serpentine palace. Curled against the garter-blue velvet of a
single compartment, the French afternoon whirred past me in
comatose delight. At length came Paris, the clumped ova of the
Sacr&eacute; Coeur standing high and white against copper
storm-clouds. Slowly we shunted round the <i>ceinture</i> amid
those intimacies of slum-life presented by the main line traverse
of any great city: hopeless figures gazing in immobile despondency
through the importance of the train at their own troubles; children
roving the open spaces on tenement balconies; garments sexless,
patched, one inevitably Tartan, listless on their lines; healthy
plants and flowers rendered pathetic by environment; the whole
gamut of man's misery, so it seems to the looker. At the Gare de
Lyons the train doubled itself, gathered up its passengers, and
started for the south.</p>

<p>Dinner was epic. Sleep cradled in the clouds. Morning broke with
Avignon. And the sun rose over a barber's chair at Marseilles.</p>

<p>It remained to open the still fastened suit-case. Up a
neighbouring street a locksmith of stupendous proportions and his
shrewish wife set about to make a key for it. At the end of an hour
their patience was exhausted and the upper catch was loosened from
the lid by a drill. Now opened, it needed a strap to close it
again, in search of which, to the speechless indignation of the
shrewish wife, the locksmith and I left the shop. With the advent
of the "zip-bag," rational instruments of cohesion seemed to have
become extinct. We hurried from street to street, the locksmith
scorning my idea of taking a taxi&mdash;he <i>never</i>
did&mdash;and pausing now and again to direct my attention to a
bevy of nude nymphs clinging by some process of stomachic suction
to the boulders of a municipal fountain. Our quest fulfilled, I
piled body and baggage into a diminutive motor, and, telegraphing
to herald my arrival in Athens, descended to the docks.</p>

<p>The <i>Patris II</i> lay silent and empty. I was shown my cabin,
then left to explore its dark recesses. It was morning; the
stewards were hardly aboard; and it was with difficulty that as
much as beer and a sandwich were persuaded from the bar. But as the
afternoon advanced, peace dispersed. Crowds on deck waved to crowds
on shore, serried against the endless vista of warehouse brick. Two
women fiddlers and a male harpist scraped discords to the hot air.
Ten yards away, the faded rhythm of "Valencia" quavered from a
ragged couple, haunted with memories of last year to which I was
returning. A fat woman, the hazel of her bare arms emerging
inharmoniously from petunia silk, began to cry. As the tea-gong
thrummed we moved from the quay-side, threaded the enormous
harbour, rounded the outer mole, turned, and sailed east.</p>

<p>The <i>Patris II,</i> a white boat, decorated by Waring &amp;
Gillow and sanitated by Shanks, is the pride of her line, which
bears the same name as myself. First-class accommodation boasts a
ladies' room in dyed sycamore and pink brocade, a lounge in
mahogany, a smoking-room, and a bar. The passengers were mainly
Greeks, attired in the crest of fashion, and each endowed with
sufficient clothes to last them without reappearance through the
sixteen odd meals of the voyage. White trouser and mauve plus four
flashed above parti-coloured shoe; new tie was child of new shirt;
jewels glittered; gowns clung; lips reddened; and all continued to
ring the changes in face of the increasing heat; while I lay about,
cool and contemptible, in one shirt and a pair of trousers. Music
was unceasing. Two pianos and a gramophone ministered to "fox
trrott" and "Sharl&eacute;stoun." While below, in the bows, the
incantation of strings impelled the steerage passengers to lose
their small-moustached, black-coated selves in a more reserved
syncopation. Something inexplicably haphazard pervades Greek
dancing: the slowly moving ring of peasants on the sky-line; the
inspired solo of an Athenian wine-shop; the applauded
<i>pas-de-trois,</i> kicking up the dust of a caf&eacute; circle at
a wayside station, with a great trans-European express caught up in
amazement; many scenes were hailed from oblivion by the sad rhythm.
Till the blare of jazz brought back the West.</p>

<p>First-class society resolved into groups. Seated at meals on the
captain's right was Madame Venizelos, uttering words of patronage
and comfort to such loose infants as toddled within her orbit.
Paying court, on one side, was an ancient scion of the Athenian
house of M&eacute;las, a retired naval captain, bearing the
magnificent appearance of an English duke of the 'forties, white
beard and moustachios a-cock; on the other Sir Frederick Halliday,
instrument of that permanent obstruction of the Athens streets,
"Freddie's Police." The second stratum centred round a number of
young men from the Greek colony in Paris, attired at all moments of
the day for every variety of sport. At night there was dancing on
the upper deck, which resembled a steeply pitched roof covered in
treacle. Overhead, the southern moon hung like a huge gold lantern
affixed to the mast, casting romance into the souls of the couples
and a path of rippling light over the sea beneath.</p>

<p>The meals were served in the temperature of a blast-furnace,
stirred to its whitest by the vibrations of electric fans. One and
all were impregnated with the taste of candle-flame, the
outstanding feature of that terrifying menace to the palate, "Greek
food"&mdash;though to me familiar as the smell of a cedar wardrobe
to a boy home from school. At my side, thoughtfully placed by the
head steward, sat a compatriot, who, after thirty-six hours'
unbroken silence, opened conversation with the words: "Do you
perspaire much?" Himself, he said, he was resigned to a dripping
forehead. Some people, on the other hand, exuded even from their
palms. Throughout the voyage we kept our table animated with
discussion of the absorbent merits of respective underwears.</p>

<p>The ship was timed to arrive at Piraeus on Tuesday afternoon.
Though we had left Marseilles punctually, it was not until the
evening of that day that even the western coast of Greece appeared,
a shadowy outline. Gradually the mountain gates of the Gulf of
Corinth, giant cliff and weathered obelisk, stood softly from the
rippled sea, each face a rosy grey, and a luminous blue lurking in
the shadow of each easterly cleft. A white blur on the shore
bespoke Patras. A three-masted sailing-boat rode by. Astern, the
sun lay poised on an indigo hill, like a fairy tinsel flower on a
Christmas-tree. A last glimmer trickled down the waves; then only a
glow in the sky remained, deepening the hills and giving life to a
star in the green opposite. Themistocles, the barman, jangling gin
and vermouth, rooted the emotion in the senses. Darkness grew. The
dinner-gong rang and rang again. At length it ceased, leaving its
hearers filled with that spice of devil-may-care which only
extended defiance of a ship's mealtime can induce.</p>

<p>The last evening on board was devoted to what the most
sartorially sporting of the Greek youth termed <i>jeux de
soci&eacute;t&eacute;.</i> Starting with a species of multi-lingual
clumps and a system of forfeits which necessitated the demanding in
marriage of the lady opposite, the night was finally launched on an
orgy of hide and seek that was only cut short at one in the morning
by the advent of the Corinth Canal. Towed by a small tug, the
<i>Patris</i> slid slowly into this narrow, electric-lit groove. On
either side rose walls of cleft rock as high again as the summit of
her topmost mast. Great blasts of heat, conserved from the broiling
day, fell down upon the passengers. Gradually, however, as we
reached the middle and the bridge over which I had formerly motored
to my first view of the Aegean, the novelty waned; and, of the
crowd of passengers on the bridge, most were asleep before the
passage was completed.</p>

<p>Piraeus next morning presented the picture of webbed and
inextricable confusion that large ports always do. Already, before
the sun was up, an ominous shimmer, a kind of film, overlay the
brown slopes and white houses enclosing the harbour. I was dressing
leisurely when there irrupted Nicola, the unscrupulous henchman of
an absent friend, shaved, freshly hatted, and leading by the hand a
naval officer of inimitable smartness whom I had observed with awe
arrive at the side of the ship in a launch. Having packed and
breakfasted, I marched in sedate procession through the assembled
passengers, already gnashing at the prospect of an hour's wait for
doctor's and passport formalities, and descended by the gangway to
the boat. Thus was the humble and meek exalted, to the envy of
those who had despised him The hands of the <i>douanier</i> were
manacled by <i>a laissez-passer</i> from the Greek Minister in
London. And in a few minutes we were making fifty miles an hour up
the Syngros Avenue, the finest road in the world, as broad as
Whitehall from the twin pillars of the temple of Zeus in Athens
itself, to the sea two miles away.</p>

<p>The myriad blocks of the town, with the Acropolis perched on its
untidy pedestal over to the left and the twisted, wooded spike of
Lycabettus dominating its midst, vibrated a mirage of eggshell and
white in the quickening heat. We reached the flat destined for my
reception. In the absence of the owner, it had apparently become
Nicola's perquisite; and a plethora of razor-blades, cake-crumbs,
and permanganate of potash testified to his activities as a
house-agent. For the moment, a bare-footed old demi-rep was
preparing a bedroom, every pouch of her voluminous body quivering
with resentment. But, appalled by the garbage of the kitchen, I
decided to seek the advice of Lennox Howe, another resident friend.
Between the splashings of his bath he offered me two rooms of his
own apartment, uttering curdling tales of Nicola's nocturnal
parties held in the very teeth of previous lessees. Thither,
therefore, to the street of the little female fox the baggage was
removed. And Nicola, who had broken, he said, an island holiday to
meet me, was free to return to it, richer by 300 drachmas.</p>

<p>Howe's flat, situate in a basement, was cool even in the days
that followed&mdash;the August tail of the hottest summer within
living memory. At first I lay prostrate in the breeze of a fan,
unable to move till the evening. At the back, a vine-covered
courtyard gave access to numerous other households, whose washing
and common idiot enlivened the scene. Lurked also, in its recesses,
a tribe of lean and tawny cats, who came speeding day and night
through the open doors and windows in horrible battle. Heedless of
ground glass, arsenic, and entanglements of electric wires, their
objective was the kitchen, where platters, cups, and lids of
casseroles were flung remorselessly to the floor in their efforts
to disinter the few provisions we could afford. Such was the
savagery of their onslaughts that every night we stealthily
deposited the more decomposed, and therefore magnetic, of the day's
refuse in a near-by street. To these enemies were added gigantic
insects, an inch and a half long, and clad in orange armour, that
emerged from every crack in the plaster, rendering each doze and
bath a period of suspense. Suggestion was immediately telegraphed
to Messrs. Duckworth that the public must necessarily be attracted
to a work bearing the stirring title:</p>

<blockquote>'TWIXT CAT AND COCKROACH:<br>
<i>A Fight for the Union Jack in an Athenian Slum.</i></blockquote>

<p>But, in view of the less exciting though more protracted events
which have since occurred, the idea was not adopted.</p>

<p>For the greater part of 1926, between visits to Turkey and
Byzantine monuments of Greece, Athens had been my home. There were
calls to pay, acquaintances to cement, friendships to renew. At His
Britannic Majesty's Legation the personnel had changed. But the
Minister was on leave, and his mice were at play. Every evening we
gathered on the Zappeion, the Hyde Park of the town, where the less
exclusive population dines and drinks to the crash of bands among
the trees and the harangues of professional orators. As the clock
moved into the morning, and tired waiters piled the tin tables for
the morrow, still the destiny of man waited our decision. The
mainspring of argument was the first secretary, a Scot, struggling
between the rationalistic cynicism of his generation and
instinctive hope. One of his remarks remains in my mind: "It is
only since they ceased to exist that God and Royalty have been
genuinely revered."</p>

<p>The pivot of the morning was the English club, where ham
sandwiches, gin fizz, and a variety of periodicals, from the
<i>Pink 'Un</i> up, made it possible to recover from the dripping
exhaustion of a hundred yards' walk. Thence, on the first day, I
visited General Phrantzes, the master of the President's military
household, to thank him, to whom I was indebted, for my reception
at Piraeus. He was installed in the old palace of King Constantine,
a spacious, marble-cooled house, having Empire furniture and
upholstered with a wealth of original Victorian chintz. Later I
proceeded to the Foreign Office, to find George M&eacute;las,
formerly attach&eacute; in London. We lunched till five o'clock,
drinking cr&egrave;me de menthe in deference to a sentimental past
(despite the temperature of 105 degrees in the shade) and probing
the ideals of Venizelism.</p>

<p>The grades of Athenian social life offer an intricate field for
the anxious climber such as myself. In the eyes of the English
colony the Legation is Mecca. But the present anti-social tradition
of the British Foreign Office renders this an isolated goal rather
than a posting-house to greater vantages. For, while winter brings
the ordinary round of parties which form a Season and which even
our diplomats cannot avoid, the summer is marked by a shifting of
social gravities to the golf-club. It is this wired enclosure on
the seashore, some five miles outside the town, that would claim
the attention, if there were such a thing, of the <i>Tatler</i>
foreign correspondent. There he might snap the Turkish Minister,
dusky Falstaff, floating playfully among the <i>Americaines</i>
after his nine-hole round; monocled counts from the Baltic States
arriving in large motors; the Hellenic cosmopolis ignoring one
another; and finally Phyllis, rock among quicksands, convoying her
new princess or millionaire into a basket chair. In her other
moments Phyllis dragoons a shedful of destitute refugees into
weaving artistic tweeds, which she sells to her enemies. Gossip
circulates, swells, grows titanic. From Oslo to Teheran the
scandals of the old world are culled and digested, liaisons woven,
marriages unpicked, as the sun falls over aegina and the huge grey
ridge of Hymettus assumes that virulent, blinding petunia which
poets have so often mistaken for violet.</p>

<p>Stricken with the weight of unrequited hospitality, I decided,
conjointly with Howe, to give a <i>masticha</i>&mdash;a form of
entertainment peculiar to the Levant, and lately emulated by the
Anglo-Saxon world in its cocktail-parties. Our establishment was
set in activity, the unwilling labours of Augustina, the servant,
being supplemented by the hands of sympathising friends. Wines from
Crete and Samos, <i>ouzo</i> the national ap&eacute;ritif, gin,
whisky, and vermouth, were ranged upon our tables; the folding
doors thrown back; and our smiles extended to the reception of some
thirty guests. The triumph of the party was the gin, regarded by
Greek d&eacute;butantes as a dilutant, to the excitation of their
good humour. Everyone, having arrived at half-past six, remained
till a quarter past nine, though it had been hinted in the
invitations that the party would end at eight. What greater
compliment could we have hoped?</p>

<p>With regret I saw my short stay in Athens drawing to a close. To
me the town is a home&mdash;that squared modern town reviled of the
cultured itinerant. There may I find refuge from the Anglo-Saxon
canon. No need to be a gentleman or a good fellow any more. I
become a person among persons, instead of a unit in a thousand
teams. I can remain English without showing it. A world of friends
displaced one of potential enemies. So it is all over the Levant.
But Athens, though I am ill three days in seven, stands by herself,
the changeless city of dust and politicians, fortress through
millennia of the split straw, ill-watered, uncomfortable, but the
city of individuals, where the pall of the West has not descended.
Cursorily it seems a western town enough, conceived in the days of
Otho, the Wittelsbach king of the thirties, when Queen Amalia sat
in her Gothic grange upon a Gothic chair, the court wore national
dress, and the Duchesse de Plaisance brought social convenances to
the families that had led the Revolution and the merchants who had
profited from it. Or the political observer may call it Balkan,
riddled with intrigue. Yet what draught of happiness to encounter,
straight from England, the exiled Dodecanesian leader Zervos, with
the tale of his morning's adventure bubbling on his lips.[*] Here
is history woven with the days, not years. But when other races
fret and curse, the Greek smiles, soaring on a contempt for the
rest of humanity so profound that even the taxi-driver, plainly
directed, will take the unhappy passenger elsewhere, convinced that
he knows best. And in the narrow Athenian streets, every doorstep
and lintel of Pentelic marble, every cornice serrated with the
acroteria that have descended uninterrupted from before Christ to
the meanest hovel of the twentieth century, where is Europe? Before
the sun is up the vendors are about, uttering the "cries of Athens"
in the piercing semi-tones of a people who, like the Jews, are of
no continent:</p>

<blockquote>[* He had gone to bathe before breakfast; and had
found, on plunging in, the whole bottom of the sea covered with
broken glass, placed there by the calculated animosity of the
Italian Legation.]</blockquote>

<p>"Figs, fresh figs!"</p>

<p>"Pots and casseroles!"</p>

<p>"I buy old boo-oots!"</p>

<p>"Chairs to mend!"</p>

<p>"Lovely lace one drachma an ell!"</p>

<p>"Ice! I-ice!"</p>

<p>Every morning at eight o'clock the iceman delivered his block.
And, as he put it in the chest, still, almost beneath his breath,
he wailed the chant, <i>"Ice! I-ice!"</i> as though mesmerised with
the beauty of his calling.</p>

<p>It is curious fact that, participating as we do in a system of
education largely based on Greek literature, no attempt should ever
be made to comprehend Greek psychology. The professional pedagogue,
ranging himself in opposition to common sense observation and the
whole science of anthropology, affirms, with one snap of his
bitten, ink-stained fingers, that the modern Greek is related
neither in language, body, nor mind to the ancient. Further, though
the average reader of the classics experience no difficulty in
reading a modern Greek newspaper, the pronunciation which he has
been taught is one that not only no Greek can understand, but which
denies, in addition, that very poetry of sound which Greek
literature professes to reveal. Not, however, content with this
purposeful obscurantism, the Anglo-Saxon professor, with the
nauseating self-sufficiency of his kind, must even blame the native
for pronouncing his language in the manner it demands. And while
aware, if pretending to culture, that a cursive hand has existed
for 1,000 years and more, he still forces his unhappy pupils to
conduct their exercises in disjointed and uncouth hieroglyphics,
thus wasting five minutes in every ten so devoted. A gentleman
writes politely to <i>The Times</i>. And he receives in reply the
ponderous sneer that the headmaster of Eton does not teach Greek in
order that his pupils may enjoy the hypothetical advantage of
reading the Greek Press in the vernacular. The humanities, in fact,
will be enshrined for ever in as cumbersome and repellent a guise
as the ignorance of the sixteenth century could devise. They will.
But a scrutiny may be cast in passing, and not without relevance,
upon the forces of their kingdom.</p>

<p>It is the privilege of the educated, immersed in contemporary
duties, to fortify themselves upon the inspiration of the past. The
majority has looked hitherto to that chaos of stone photography and
sententious inquest on the nature of being, known as Antiquity. We,
however, possessors of the twentieth century, have taken a step
outside this limitation of spirit. We march hand in hand with
science, the Benjamin of Victorian rationalism and now discarding
its parent. The palings of the Mediterranean back garden are down.
We have the earth instead. "Am I? Am I not?" ponders the secondhand
philosopher, head bowed to the cabbages. "What matter?" comes the
answer from astride the globe. "We run now with the soul, with the
spirit that has escaped you, cobwebbed old man, paid instrument of
enormous stagnation." But whither do we run? As I search, I too
need my past. And I find it, now and perhaps for ever, in the
Levant after all.</p>

<p>When, in A.D. 330, the year of the foundation of Constantinople,
the Greeks took over the lease of the Roman Empire, the Christian
religion had at length put them in pursuit of Reality. To analyse
the affinity between the Byzantine civilisation that evolved, and
our own requires more than this ultimate paragraph. But if, in the
following pages, too great a hint of it obtrudes, let it be
pardoned in the light of personal inspiration. For, while the
classical continues to suckle half the world on a voice of letters
and stones, one fragment, one living, articulate community of my
chosen past, has been preserved, by a fabulous compound of
circumstance, into the present time. Thither I travel, physically
by land and water, instead of down the pages of a book or the
corridors of a museum. Of the Byzantine Empire, whose life has left
its impress on the Levant and whose coins were once current from
London to Pekin, alone, impregnable, the Holy Mountain Athos
conserves both the form and the spirit. Scholar and archaeologist
have gone before, will come after. Mine is the picture recorded. If
patches are purpled with a tedious enthusiasm, or watered with
excessive reference to the past, let the reader recall his own
schoolroom and discover the excuse.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch2"></a>Chapter II. TRANSLATION</h2>

<p>Aided by my Greek tutor, I had contrived earlier in the summer
to address a letter to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople,
head of the Orthodox Church, to whom I was personally known.
Couched in the phraseology of centuries, myself remaining his "Most
Divine All-Holiness' faithful child in Christ," it was despatched,
for fear of the inquisitorial Turkish post office, by diplomatic
bag. The answer had preceded me, by the same means, to our Legation
in Athens. It ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Basil, by the grace of God Archbishop of
Constantinople, New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch.

<p>"To the Most Honourable Mr. Robert Byron, the grace and peace of
God and of our Saviour Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
"Having gladly issued, we transmit to your Honour enclosed
herewith, our Patriarchal letter of introduction to the Synod of
the Holy Mountain, for which you asked in your letter of the 20th
ultimo.<br>
<br>
"We pray for you all success in your scientific research, and all
good fortune from God, from whom also may your years be of the
fullest, healthy and joyful.<br>
<br>
"1927, July 26.<br>
<br>
[Signed]<br>
<br>
"Of Constantinople.<br>
<i>"Ardent suppliant of God."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Save for the last phrase, written in the Patriarch's own shaky
hand, and the two logogriphs in facsimile, the letter was type
written in Greek. Of the same character was that addressed to the
Synod.</p>

<blockquote>"Basil, by the grace of God, Archbishop of
Constantinople, New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch.<br>
<br>
"Most holy <i>Epistatai</i> and <i>Antiprosopoi</i> of the Synod of
the Holy Mountain, beloved children in the Lord of our Mediocrity,
may the grace and peace of God be to your Holiness.<br>
<br>
"He who formerly visited your holy place, the learned Englishman
Mr. Robert Byron, anxious there to pursue his researches in
Byzantine art, comes thither for this purpose, intending
particularly to photograph the frescoes of the leading
churches.<br>
<br>
"We, therefore, gladly urge, through this our Patriarchal letter of
introduction to your Holiness, that by your prompt solicitude there
be afforded him everywhere a courteous reception and treatment, and
simultaneously every facility for the photographing of the said
frescoes, and generally throughout his scientific researches
there.<br>
<br>
"May also God's grace and his immense mercy be with your
Holiness.<br>
<br>
"1927, July 26.<br>
<br>
[Signed]<br>
<br>
"Of Constantinople.<br>
<i>"Ardent suppliant of God."</i></blockquote>

<p>The soul of possibly the most insignificant participant in the
British Commonwealth of Nations drank deep of these eulogies.
Further, a cloud was lifted. For the Patriarch had sponsored the
practical object of the expedition, to which another member of the
party was devoting time and money on my assurance of its
feasibility. A more forcible recommendation to the secretive and
independent monks than this, from the very pivot of Christendom,
human insistence could not have obtained. A second letter was
furnished by the Greek Foreign Office; and a third, to vouch for my
companions, by the Metropolitan of Athens. Such a packet, surely,
must substantiate our worth with every shade of monastic
opinion.</p>

<p>To scraps of paper were added more material comforts: cans of an
effective flea-deterrent; five dozen quarter-plate films of six
pictures each for landscape; the works of Elinor Glyn in the
Tauchnitz edition; and a small phrase-book, externally resembling a
Bible, to bridge the gaps in my knowledge of the language. Saturday
afternoon came. The suit-case, the kit-bag, the saddlebags, the
syphon-box, and the despatch-case were thrust through a window of
the Prague express. And we steamed from the Larissa station at
half-past six, my cabin-mate being an obese Greek who had brought
his dinner in a bag and had already impregnated the entire coach
with the fumes of resin-tainted wine. I was glad, therefore, to
seek refuge in that of an American named Marten, whom I had been
unsuccessfully trying to disabuse of a belief in the infallibility
of Periclean art during a short acquaintance of three days.</p>

<p>After dinner&mdash;a parody of a meal&mdash;the obese Greek,
whose liquor had now transformed the atmosphere of the compartment
into that of a public operating-theatre, hoisted his rotund form
into that lower berth which had cost me a quarter of an hour's
rhetoric on the previous day to reserve for myself. I produced my
ticket; the usurper was impelled up the carpet steps to a higher;
and the attendant, tripping over the saddle-bags in the struggle to
change the linen, became so enveloped in the sheets as to resemble
a new-risen Lazarus. I slept, thereafter, with increased zest.</p>

<p>Dawn broke over the marshes and downlands of Macedonia, dotted
here and there with the red-roofed boxes of refugee villages.
Salonica was reached at eight o'clock. The London train was moving
out. Marten and I spurred a two-horse cab to the harbour-front,
where there stood, waving from the steps of the Mediterranean
Palace Hotel, three figures. The long-planned rendezvous held good.
Behold, bobbing on a surf of greeting, the party.</p>

<p>Foremost, like some mythical denizen of the seas twisted back in
satisfaction upon the prow of an ancient galleon, was David, body
akimbo, visage benign&mdash;a David of the font, and not to be
confused with the pseudonym of a companion on a former adventure;
on one side Reinecker, sparse and sallow, stifling a flow of
eternal depreciation; on the other, Mark, in plus fours, a waft of
artificial heather in an arid land. In company with Marten, struck
dumb by the babble of union, we sank to breakfast, while the
concierge enquired our fathers' Christian names, and the porter,
recognising me from last year, poured his blessings on "Mr.
Robert."</p>

<p>Eggs materialised in metal pans. As we ate, Marten studied the
party; and, summoning a similar detachment, I followed his cue.
First sat Reinecker, separate from us in some degree: hardly
English, intellectual, and student of art in that aspect;
financially independent; and emanating from a large house of his
own in Kensington filled with rare and austerely disposed Oriental
potteries. In absolute contrast was David, one of life's familiar
pillars from the days of battle at a public school; smoking in the
bathing-place, drinking beer among the aspidistras of the adjacent
pub; bawling at small boys in boats through a megaphone;
rearranging a rather jejune collection of Egyptian figurines in a
corner cupboard; and later at Oxford: studious and anthropological,
buried in books, or snorting through the town in a motor that
looked as if it had been made to transport a Boer family up
country; sober always, even in insobriety; now, on the threshold of
archaeological distinction, unearthing clay fragments at Kish and
Constantinople; or at home, flying the walls of the Heythrop
country like a sedate heron; cenotaph of competence; monolith of
equanimity. Third was Mark, another of school's mercies: of a
frivolous nature, tempered with purpose; proud of Scotland, lover
of the moors and all things Scottish; naturalist by descent, artist
by choice; solitary by temperament; yet beacon-light of parties;
careful of appearance; practising economy without stinginess; and,
but for a visit to Spitzbergen and a month in the
<i>ch&acirc;teau</i> of a French marquise, where there were
caterpillars in the salad, untravelled. To him, after four days in
the Orient express, the Near East came as a surprise.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Mark and I proceeded to St. Sophia, the finest
of the town's churches, to see the eighth-century mosaic of the
chocolate-robed Virgin unattended in her vault of dull glowing
gold. But we were not alone. For a vast concourse had gathered in
homage to those who had fallen in the wars that Greece fought
between 1912 and 1922. A service was in progress, and we were
ushered, unwitting, to a railed and carpeted enclosure. There we
remained for an hour in a poultice of humanity, while the
Metropolitan, crowned and enthroned, led the service, and a
civilian dignitary spoke interminable commemoration.</p>

<p>Salonica, despised of soldiers, is as curious a town as Europe
can show. Achieving immortality with St. Paul, the outstanding
event in its subsequent history was the immigration of an enormous
band of Jews, driven from Spain with the Moriscoes at the beginning
of the seventeenth century, to the ruin of that country's
industries. And still the Jewish women, their red pig-tails knotted
in and out of coloured ribbons, trail their full green skirts up
the steps of trams and buses; still they utter imprecations which
sound to the modern Spaniard as Shakespeare's jauntier passages to
us: "Marry come up, sir conductor, thinkee this be a rightful
recompense from two drachmas? 'D's teeth, 'd's wounds, sirrah! am I
a pullet for the plucking?" etc. Still every variety of Hebrew
jostles in the modern streets, from the Whitechapel vendor, with
his bowler hat ingeniously shaped to accentuate the nasal curve, to
the Elizabethan rabbi, fur-hatted, and gowned in a purple caftan
surmounted by a high fur collar. Since the recovery of the town by
the Greeks in 1912, it has regained something of that commercial
importance which blazed the fame of its fair throughout the
mediaeval world. At the time of our visit preparations were being
made to revive this institution. The municipality was engaged in
raising the harbour-front. And, needless to say, the work reached
the portico of the hotel simultaneously with ourselves. An
unceasing train of carts jangled beneath our windows, crashes,
oaths, and the ring of shovels intermingling. A strong wind was
blowing. And throughout the hotel every vacant inch was coated with
desiccated refuse. Mark, snoozing at midday through the noise of a
stage battle, wished himself in the Highlands.</p>

<p>There arrived in the afternoon a resident acquaintance to visit
us. It was to him, last year, that I had been indebted for my
single venture into Salonica society. Though in no way connected
with the Far East, he had lately engineered himself into the post
of Japanese Consul; and, as he drove us out to inspect the British
war-cemetery, the Rising Sun floated over the motor like a pennant
at a tourney. Later we attended a dinner-party on the roof of the
hotel, where a Tzigane band, passionately conducted by an ancient
Russian, was playing jazz.</p>

<p>"Are there," I asked in a fevered impetus of conversation,
"still many Jews here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "there's me&mdash;also Count Morpourgo
across the table."</p>

<p>The evening, thus happily inaugurated, progressed upon the safer
topic of American motors. Till at length a junction was effected
between our table and that of the Governor of Macedonia, Monsieur
Bouboulis. His Excellency was accompanied by two ladies: his
sister-in-law, Madame Kotzias, who, having spent her most
impressionable years at a girls' school near Woking, detested
Britain to the point of inarticulacy; and an Alexandrine lady on
whose fingers diamonds proportionate to her figure, were balancing
like pigeons' eggs. The latter and I took the floor, or, rather,
the plumbing, hoisting one another alternately from the gullies and
ravines with which the roof was drained. At midnight we removed to
the country, where we trotted over tiles; and then still farther
inland; for the Governor made a habit of never retiring till 6 a.m.
Next day we drank tea with Madame Kotzias at the Residency, where
George I had been staying when he was murdered. This year, we
learnt, she was divorced.</p>

<p>Roused early next day by the din of road-mending, I went
creeping amid the tattered booths of the refugee town up the hill
in search of antiques. It was here that I had noted, skew-eyed on a
plush couch, a small painting of the Virgin, with jewels set in her
celestial lights, that has since, after reproduction in <i>The
Burlington Magazine,</i> passed into the possession of a curator of
the Victoria and Albert Museum at a profit of 566.6 per cent. For
the moment there seemed little to be found. Set about by an
incoherent Levantine who announced his name as Haig, I penetrated
in vain the kitchen of the Turk and the back-bedroom of the
Armenian. Later in the morning, however, David, under the same
guidance, purchased with infinite secrecy and at great cost a
platter of almost prehistoric majolica, together with what appeared
to comprise the only entire pieces of Byzantine pottery in
existence. Having unearthed numerous fragments of this ware in the
Hippodrome at Constantinople, David purposes to become its sole
authority. Hence a paean of triumph on his return to the hotel.
Meanwhile, after having the greater part of my hair removed, I on
my side had acquired a pair of sandals, a store of cigarettes, and
a tin-opener. After lunch, and a comatose afternoon, we announced
the moment of departure.</p>

<p>Then followed uproar with the concierge.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said he to David, incensed at the pile of
newspapered crocks that had been dumped in the hall, "that I have
known your antique agent for two years, and that he is a
swindler?"</p>

<p>"Do you know," replied David to him, "that I have known you for
two days, and dislike you intensely?"</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>Eventually the luggage was piled formidably upon a hand-cart,
and the last stage of a protracted journey was in train. Overhead
the sky was black, the ships at the road's edge dancing up and down
in a chill wind, and large drops of water deliberately and
impertinently falling on our panamas. Far down the quay the famous
White Tower stood out, the colour of its name against an inky
firmament; while over it, from the sullen horizon of water to the
raisin-coloured inland peaks, glittered the arch of a rainbow.
Ultimately all was safe on board. And at half-past seven, in a
stormy glow that cast searchlights of miraculous colour on the
encircling hills and the now enormous town surmounted by its
castle, we sailed out of the harbour, seated on smutty coils of
ropes in the stern of the <i>Nausica.</i></p>

<p>The steward, anxious for the comfort of his only first-class
passengers, enumerated the intended dinner, imitating the
wing-movements of a chicken in explanation of the word [<i>Greek
characters</i>]. He also pointed with pride to a peregrine falcon
which he had shot in Cephalonia and which now stood, wings
outspread, upon a lichen-covered loglet, the glory of the central
table.</p>

<p>And so, after a year's plan and counter-plan, the last hours
were reached. That we were still on earth was recalled by the
sudden stoppage of the <i>Nausica's</i> engines, leaving us in
mid-sea for an hour at the mercy of the fortunately inactive
elements. Over a last bottle of beer we said good-bye to this last
tossing straw of our world. We slept. Till, when barely light,
there appeared, framed in the cold circle of the porthole, the dark
outline of a long finger of land, twisted by imperceptibly darker
shadows into deep ravines and curving bays. At its end, cut in
terraced silhouette against the frigid gleams of the lower sky,
reared a vast steeple from the livid grey sea. As the sun, risen a
fiery ball above the rim of the world, warmed the cold light,
silhouette gave place to hazy pink. Here and there twinkled the
white blur of a monastery down at the water's edge or perched up
among the woods. The Holy Mountain! And ourselves the pilgrims.</p>

<p>As the <i>Nausica</i> drew in, the peak disappeared behind the
towering semi-circle of a small bay. At its inmost point, dwarfed
almost to invisibility by the tree-covered surroundings, stood a
few buildings. This was the port of Daphni. Two boats appeared, in
one of which was a Greek police officer, who demanded our
passports. He made some hint that these must precede us to Caryes,
the capital of the Mountain, while we waited here below. But the
letter from the Foreign Office silenced him. His whole obtrusion
was an innovation, the price of the Greek Government's having
ratified the autonomy of the community and its constitution, the
oldest in Europe. Finally, with a wrench which was, to me who knew,
more vivid than to the others, we descended the gangway with our
possessions and rowed to land. Last year a welcome had awaited us
in the person of Father Boniface, deputed keeper of the port by his
monastery of Xeropotamou, to which it belongs. Now, however, he had
been recalled.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the policeman, it remained to transport
ourselves immediately to Caryes, the village-metropolis, situated
two and a half hours' ride away over the other side of the ridge:
that ridge, forty miles long, which is the northernmost of the
three fingers that jut like a mutilated hand from the north-east
angle of the Grecian coastline. For it was there that we must
present the Government of the Mountain with our letters of
recommendation, to receive in return another, without which no
monastery could admit us to its hospitality. Tethered beneath a
tree we espied two mules, of which their owner, an Albanian in a
plate-shaped straw hat, informed us that we could only have one. It
transpired, after infinite argument, that there was, in fact, no
actual obstacle to our having both. They were led to the miniature
wooden warehouse at the end of the jetty, and loaded.</p>

<p>Mark and I went on ahead; he hunter of the minutiae of creation,
pouncing upon strange butterflies, leaf insects, and dung-flies; I,
gazing at the olive-leaves glinting like sheaves of silver
spear-heads against the blue of the sea beneath. The sun shone
powerfully as the large white cobbles of which all the Athonite
paths are made wound up through the olive-groves and woods of
maples and Spanish chestnuts; over shady bridges spanning
non-existent rivers; past stray shrines and marble basins catching
ice-cold mountain streams for the delectation of the traveller; one
and all emblazoned with a cross or the legend of a saint. After
three-quarters of an hour's climb we halted, panting, at the
pillared entrance of Xeropotamou, a large monastery to which as yet
we possessed no right of entry. But the porter, a twinkling old
monk, produced, in answer to our request for water, <i>ouzo</i> in
addition.</p>

<p>"Ah! delicious!" I said. "Much better than at Salonica."</p>

<p>"Tchah! the <i>ouzo</i> of Salonica is lemonade."</p>

<p>Reluctantly we continued; and, reaching the top of the ridge,
3,000 feet up, amid pines and firs, caught our first view of Caryes
on a gardened plateau beneath, with the sea in the distance. As we
entered the narrow streets half an hour later, an air of activity,
almost gaiety, seemed to prevail. Shops were open; tiny restaurants
crowded with black figures, gowned and bearded, munching at wooden
tables. In the streets, multi-coloured blankets, fruit and
vegetables, saddle-cloths and saddle-bags, were focusing knots of
haggling monks arrayed in every variety of surtout, from the ragged
garment of the stage beggar to the <i>soign&eacute;</i> silken
gowns of stately old men, owners of authority in their monasteries
or the capital. It was market day. And the town presented a far
different appearance from its ordinary. Formerly, scarcely the sun
itself might shine, as we found ourselves within the twisting,
vine-hung thoroughfares, where no wheel had ever bowled, and here
and there a sombre trailing figure turned wide eyes to the clatter
of hoofs. Even now no women gossiped, no children played, nor
animals disported. Only perhaps a cat stole by, or far off, a hen,
muffled in shamed seclusion, heralded an egg.</p>

<p>The luggage was unloosed upon the floor of the single inn, where
several parties of monks, in from the country, sat at their midday
meal. While Mark and Reinecker inspected the stew-pans of the
kitchen, containing meat unappetising enough to gladden a militant
vegetarian, David and I walked next door to make the acquaintance
of the civil governor, Monsieur Lelis, to whom General Phrantzes
had given me a letter. We found a small, kindly man, an official of
the Foreign Office, who three months ago had been diverted from a
special mission to Paris to fill this lonely post. He seemed to
enjoy conversation, and we discoursed upon the health of the
outside world, the fate of Sacco and Vanzetti, and the waning
dominion of the Charleston. For the first month, he told us, he had
enjoyed his stay here. Thenceforth the lack of rational converse
had affected his nerves. He had lately taken a trip to the summit,
which he had failed to reach, owing to a buzzing in the ears and a
bleeding at the nose, due to the height. He then invented for our
apprehension, a legend of wholly imaginary precipices, representing
the last 7,000 feet as a dangerous glissade on which one false step
meant death. As it is impossible to roll a yard without being
hooked up on the jagged, vertical strata, his tale left me
unmoved.</p>

<p>We returned to lunch, which was helped, after all, by yet one
more bottle of beer. And then lay down to sleep, spreading our
overcoats upon a balcony festooned with orange-trumpeted creepers
and overlooking a panorama of olives and cypresses. The sea was
visible below, and in the distance the summit, remote grey white
above the highest point of the ridge, twirling and casting loose
every vagrant cloud in an elsewhere cloudless sky. As we dozed, a
cat, bearing in its mouth a mangled entrail with a tenderness
eloquent of a determination to save it for another time, trailed
over our feet with a malformed kitten at her heels. At four we
rose, extracted some letters from the post office, where the star
and crescent of the Ottoman Empire still blazoned every
pigeon-hole, and betook ourselves to the police station. Primarily
mystified by the double surnames of Mark and David, the officer
almost collapsed under the strain of discovering our professions. I
informed him that we had none. This is my usual policy, as often it
is inadvisable to admit the wielding of a pen. The occasion
reminded me of an incident at Smyrna, when for half an hour I
blocked a ship-load of impatient passengers by refusing, as there,
of all places, was necessary, to divulge my share in the world's
work. The calm of the Turk rivalling my own, matters were brought
to a complete <i>impasse.</i> A solution was only found by an
exasperated Frenchman's rushing forward and exclaiming in a voice
of loathing and contempt, <i>"Rentier? Vous &ecirc;tes
rentier</i>?" To which I admitted that my parents enjoyed an
exiguous income sufficient to keep the wolf from the door and a
servant to open it.</p>

<p>A similar situation threatened to arise at present.</p>

<p>"We have no professions," I said, "but write down what you
like."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Although we have no professions, you can, if you wish, invent
some."</p>

<p>"Electricians, painters, taxi-drivers, soldiers, bank clerks,
clergymen, caf&eacute;-keepers, archaeologists&mdash;" I
suggested.</p>

<p>"Are you <i>all</i> archaeologists?"</p>

<p>"ALL."</p>

<p>And he wrote:</p>

<p>"Archaeologist.</p>

<p>"Archaeologist.</p>

<p>"Archaeologist.</p>

<p>"Archaeologist."</p>

<p>With a straightening of ties we approached the Synod house. The
moment for me, who was responsible to David for the success of a
prospective publication, was one of crisis. The seat of government
was contained in a broad-eaved house of two stories, washed
raspberry colour, and set, amid beds of hollyhocks and harpaliums,
between two courtyards. These were connected by a mews-entrance
passage that ran underneath it. Mounting a flight of wooden stairs,
I handed our letters to a member of the Synod guard, who was
attired in the old national dress of white tights and pleated linen
kilt, embroidered jacket, flowing linen sleeves, and a red cap
adorned with the silver eagles of the Orthodox Church and the
letters A.O., for [<i>Greek characters</i>] which means Holy
Mountain. After a short interval, we were ushered into an oblong
room. Opposite the door, against a wall pierced by three windows,
sat the black-gowned secretary at his desk. And near him, on a
brown wooden throne, the <i>Protepistates,</i> the elected head of
the entire community, who this year was Father Daniel of Iviron,
dignified, silent, and bespectacled. Broad Turkish divans ran round
the walls. The majority of the Synod, which, containing a
representative from each of the ruling monasteries, numbers twenty,
was absent, the places of some being marked by piles of letters.
Coffee and Turkish delight were handed us as we sat, myself
maintaining a desultory conversation with a monk whom I remembered,
but could not name. At length, fired with an inspiration, I
enquired if they had seen the portfolio of Professor Millet. No,
they complained, though for months at a time he had enjoyed their
hospitality, no copy had reached them. He was waiting, I suggested,
till the whole series was completed.</p>

<p>"I will fetch it."</p>

<p>"We will go together," said Daniel the <i>Protepistates</i>,
rising. Taking his silver-topped wand in his hand, and followed by
a tiny Rip van Winkle of the Synod Guard, he led the way. As we
processed through the streets, monks squatting at their wares
sprang to their feet. Returning with the heavy tome, we handed it
round, while the secretary produced the synodical letter which he
had inscribed on paper printed with the eagles of the Byzantine
emperors. I humbly begged that our desire to photograph the
frescoes, seconded by his All-Holiness the Patriarch, might be
mentioned for the persuasion of the individual monasteries. It was,
he said, already. The four members of the <i>Epistasia</i>, the
executive committee of the parliament, drew from inner wallets the
four quarters of the seal of the community, struck anew in 1912,
when, after 482 years' Mahommedan suzerainty, the Mountain had
returned once more to the Christian governance. The secretary
joined the pieces to a stem, stamped the letter, powdered the
impression with gold, and folded the whole in an envelope, which he
handed us. With bows and varied thanks, we filed out.</p>

<p>The Albanian muleteer, according to instructions, was waiting
outside, and had been waiting, moreover, for an hour. In the teeth
of his imprecations, we proceeded again to the Governor. And he
also, with that palsied deliberation which characterises the
clerical operations of the Levant, wrote us a circular letter.
Meanwhile the muleteer was shouting outside: the luggage was
loaded. Pausing yet again to buy two gaily striped saddle-bags in
which to convey the syphon and numerous loose books, we at last
descended from the town by a path leading in the direction of the
sea. Five minutes brought us to an old balconied house which was
surrounded by a fenced garden, and approached beneath a spreading
mallow-tree covered with the flowers of its familiar field
counter-part.</p>

<p>This was the Lavra <i>konak</i>; the Lavra being a monastery,
and a <i>konak</i> signifying, in Athonite parlance, the residence
of a monastery's representative on the governing body. In this case
it was Father Evlogios, who had shown me much kindness last year. I
had written to him from Athens announcing our arrival, for which he
had prepared both the Governor and the Synod, besides despatching
the two mules to meet us at Daphni. <i>Ouzo</i>, coffee, cold
water, and <i>glyco</i>&mdash;that inestimable preserve of cherry,
grape, or orange, too rare to deserve the appellation
jam&mdash;were handed on a tray, to the confusion of the others,
who were unacquainted with the attendant ritual. But our host's
congratulations on my acquisition of Greek were shattered by the
irruption of the muleteer, whose patience was now beyond control.
Regretfully we departed, promising to meet again. Mounting each a
mule, we rode for two hours downhill among the trees and shrubs.
Above us the summit, free of the clouds that had encircled it,
stood into the sky, a pinnacle of naked fiery rock deepening from
rosy gold to red-hot purple as the evening drew on. Eventually the
monastery of Iviron appeared beneath us at the edge of the sea,
backing its balconied faces of yellow and chocolate against the
wooded cleft down which we came.</p>

<p>As we arrived, darkness fell suddenly. In the confusion of
unloading, the muleteer inadvertently handed David seventy-five
drachmas too much change, which the excess of his charges enabled
us to keep without scruple. I, meanwhile, had been called inside by
the advent of a white-bearded <i>epitropos</i> in rustling silken
cr&ecirc;pe and tall cylindrical hat&mdash;worn at every appearance
in public by every monk above his knotted, uncut hair&mdash;to whom
I made conversation on a window-settee. The room in which we found
ourselves, lit by a hanging lamp in the centre, was hung with
weird, cracked portraits of foreign royalties, mostly the later
Russians, but including, besides one in peruke and tricorn, the
Kaiser and Edward VII. At length, in the middle of a story about an
English aeroplane that had landed during the war on the park-like
strip of grass between the monastery and the sea, dinner was
announced. The food was good, and the wine, the guestmaster warned
us, would go to our heads if we drank too much. Mark made signs to
him that it had already gone to mine: with the result that, for the
rest of the evening, my glass was only partially filled. Retiring
to our bedroom, we settled ourselves with pillows and sheets upon
two iron bedsteads and a range of spacious divans. The day had been
tiring. Conscious all over, of a strangeness, we fell into our
first sleep on the Holy Mountain, to the twittering of frogs and
the flutters of singed and drunken moths.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch3"></a>Chapter III. GOVERNMENT IN THE FOURTH DIMENSION</h2>

<p>The earth is behind us. Prostrate in the guest-room at Iviron,
we lie upon another plane of existence, back in that mysterious,
immaterial <i>regnum</i> from which the mind cast loose with the
Renaissance. It is a world peopled in physical truth with the
bodies ascribed to El Greco's astigmatism; where the ghosts of the
departed flit wireless-like among the woods and the marble
troughs&mdash;sun-spotted, happy ghosts perching on cruciform
signposts nailed to trees, shooting out of caves, sentinels on
gaunt crags, contained even, in the very aged, within human bounds.
How comes it that this fragment of a life which once held sway over
all the Greek seaboard endures unaltered since its foundation, the
most remarkable testimony to Europe's evolution on the face of a
Europeanised globe? Who will say but that this talk of a theocracy
at our very door is not some antiquarian figment, sprung from a
technicality of word rather than fact? Its continuity must be
demonstrable, together with a proof of independent administration
in the present. Nor will the sceptic, whose thesis is the
exaltation of living, be content with either, till accompanied by a
showing of those mystic emotions which call flesh and sense to a
profession of their own denial. At the hazard of tedium, let the
eye inspect this interim. The rest is the stucco of a day. Here is
the concrete.[*]</p>

<blockquote>[* There is no up-to-date bibliography of Athos. The
most accessible is that of F. W. Hasluck's <i>Athos and Its
Monasteries,</i> compiled in 1912.]</blockquote>

<p>In the earliest Christian times, the Mountain was already, for
appearance and security, the chosen of hermits. Legends survive of
this period, beginning with that of the visit of the Virgin
herself. History opens in the ninth century with the arrival of
Peter the Athonite, a substantial person who after fifty years'
battling with wild beasts, both of mind and forest, was discovered
by a hunter. He was followed by St. Euthymius of Salonica, who,
having forsworn the world at the age of eighteen (leaving a
daughter, Euphrosyne, to carry on his family), at first moved on
all fours and ate grass. He then retired to a cell, whence his
companion was driven out by the vermin, but which he only exchanged
after three years for a position on a pillar. Soon after, a friend
of his named John Colobos founded a monastery at the northern and
mainland end of the peninsula, receiving a chrysobul from the
Emperor Basil I the Macedonian, which appointed him and his
foundation protectors of the Mountain and its hermits, as against
the inhabitants of the neighbouring town of Erissos. This document
is known to have been dated prior to the year 881. A portion of it
was formerly in the library of the monastery of Philotheou, whence
it is thought to have been transported to Leningrad. Its importance
lies in its constituting the first official recognition of the holy
men's title to the proprietorship of land.</p>

<p>But dispute ensued on this very ground: Which holy men? The
hermits or the monks? And in so doing symbolised the basic issue of
the ecclesiastical problems of the time. Hitherto the profession of
monasticism had demanded simply individual retirement and the
practice of such ascetics as the spirit moved. The common rule of
life initiated by St. Basil in the fourth century, while
strengthened in western Europe by the ordinances of St. Benedict,
had fallen into desuetude in the East before the Hellenic instinct
for private self-assertion. But in the eighth century Theodore of
Studium had attempted the reintroduction of a coherent form of
communal living among the numerous bodies of hermits within the
jurisdiction of the Orthodox Patriarchates. Between the new
monastery of Colobou and the solitaries of the southern end and
actual peak a controversy now arose that symbolised this deeper
issue in the question of the actual proprietorship of the land. It
was settled in favour of the hermits in a second chrysobul granted
by the Emperor Leo VI the Philosopher, who reigned between 886 and
911. That they were already possessed of a central organisation at
this time is proved by the title of First Quietist, attached to the
representative whom they sent to Constantinople to conduct their
appeal. Henceforth this head of the community was known as the
<i>Protos,</i> or First. From him, by bureaucratic descent, springs
the <i>Protepistates</i> of to-day. Thus, though there were yet on
the Mountain proper no actual monasteries, the middle of the tenth
century found it under the legal proprietorship of holy men, and
administered by a central authority resident in Caryes. There, in
the Synod's archives, the documents of the Byzantine emperors which
were to give meaning to Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin in 1878,
are still preserved.</p>

<p>But the system of ordered monasticism, as visualised by
Theodore, was to triumph in the end. The piety of the brothers Leo
and Nicephorus Phocas, prominent functionaries at the Byzantine
Court, had been attracted to the Mountain, and the project
conceived that their boyhood's friend, Athanasius, should found a
community at their expense. In 961, Leo visited Caryes, and
financially assisted the enlargement of the Protaton, which was
then, as now, the central church of the Athonite community. Two
years later Nicephorus became Emperor. Athanasius, having
calculated to receive him as a brother, was indignant. But he was
persuaded to undertake the foundation which the Emperor not only
endowed, but rendered independent of all but imperial control. Thus
the seed of autonomous administration was legalised. Following the
analogy of the previous century, a rivalry immediately arose
between the Lavra&mdash;as Athanasius' foundation was
called&mdash;and the scattered inhabitants of the rest of the
Mountain. This was carried in 972 to Constantinople, where the
Emperor John I Tzimisces, murderer and successor of Nicephorus,
handed it to the judgment of a Studite monk. In accordance with the
Studite ideals laid down by Theodore, the position of the monastery
was confirmed, its emoluments being increased by the new Emperor.
Simultaneously, the powers of the <i>Protos,</i> and the assembly
of hermit-leaders that was already holding regular sessions in
Caryes, were defined. But with this reinforcement of the Lavra the
predominance of loosely scattered groups of cells was doomed.
Before Athanasius' death, at the close of the first millennium
after Christ&mdash;due to the collapse of a dome which he was
helping to build&mdash;three more monasteries proper were in being.
Of the twenty that survive to-day, eight followed in the eleventh
century; two in the twelfth; one in the thirteenth; four in the
fourteenth; and one in the sixteenth. By the typicon of the Emperor
Constantine IX Monomach, issued in 1046, the cells of the hermits
were finally subordinated to their present state of dependence on
the larger foundations. Hence the term "Ruling Monasteries."</p>

<p>From now till the sack of Constantinople by the Latin Crusaders
in 1204, the history of the Mountain is illumined by a single
incident. Towards the end of the eleventh century, Vlach shepherds,
who had obtained leave to supply the monks with milk and wool, were
discovered to be purveying their wives and daughters in addition.
Uproar followed; the Patriarch's signature was forged to restore
discipline; and half the monks deserted their monasteries in
company with the shepherds. The stricter fathers then demanded the
suppression of the beardless, as well as the female element. And,
to preserve the Mountain from total desertion, the Emperor Alexius
I Comnenus, asking if he were Herod that he should murder children,
stifled the enthusiasm of the reformers by threatening to cut off
their noses. Then came the sudden tragedy that wrecked the
complicated and magnificent civilisation of the mediaeval Greeks.
In the division of their empire that followed the Latin conquest,
Athos fell, with the "Kingdom of Thessalonica," to Boniface of
Montferrat. It was placed by Benedict, papal legate to that
transient conceit, within the jurisdiction of the Bishop of
Sebaste, who built himself a castle on the promontory as a base for
systematic plunder. But, in deference to the representations of the
Latin Emperor, Henry of Flanders, Pope Innocent III restored the
ancient status of dependence on none but the head of the state,
accompanying his edict by sententious comments on the Mountain's
arid soil but spiritual fecundity. Such the position remained till
the recapture of Constantinople by the Greeks in 1261.</p>

<p>The following century witnessed the partial subversion of the
old rule of Athanasius enjoining upon the monks a community of
property, in favour of one under which private wealth was
permitted. The difference has since become known as that between
the cenobitic and the idiorhythmic way of life. The chief
implication of the latter is that the occupants of a monastery,
being some rich and others poor, necessarily lose their footing of
equality. But that wealth must necessarily offer more scope for
useful activity to the intelligent is in this context often
forgotten. To contemporaries, in whose eyes monachism was not
designed for useful activity, the idiorhythmic system gave offence.
In 1394 a strong protest was despatched from the Patriarch Nicias
against the possession of property, the maintenance of private
kitchens, and protracted absences in the outer world. At this time
also were regulated the contributions due from each monastery to
the upkeep of the machinery of government in Caryes and the central
church of the Protaton. Ten years later, however, the new mode of
life was finally and categorically condoned in a chrysobul of the
Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus, that enterprising monarch who
travelled in the West and spent Christmas at Eltham with Henry IV.
In return for this concession, the Emperor rewarded himself with
the revenues of the monastic estates. In 1430 the Turks took
Salonica; and the monks, by hurried submission, were able to retain
their autonomy intact. Eight years later, representatives of the
Mountain were found at the Council of Florence in active opposition
to the proposed union of the Greek and Latin Churches.
Constantinople fell in 1453. And, with the extinction of the
Byzantine autocrats, Athos was placed, like the rest of their
unhappy world, within the temporal jurisdiction of the Ecumenical
Patriarch, who was, in his turn, responsible to the Sultan for the
government of all the Greeks within the Ottoman dominions. Thus the
community remained, its administrative independence unimpaired,
till November 2nd, 1912.</p>

<p>From the fifteenth to the end of the eighteenth century there is
little to record. In 1574 the Patriarch Jeremiah sought to remedy
the financial plight of the monasteries by calling upon the
Constantinople Trade Union of Furriers to audit their accounts. It
was now that the number of ruling houses was fixed at twenty. In
the seventeenth century a Turkish governor, corresponding to a
French <i>sous-pr&eacute;fet,</i> made appearance as adviser to the
monastic authorities. In the eighteenth came the great revival of
wealth and letters throughout the Greek world that led to the
Revolution. This was preceded in 1783 by the typicon of the
Patriarch Gabriel, defining the powers of the <i>Epistasia,</i> the
executive committee of four, as opposed to those of the whole
deliberative assembly. But the nineteenth century had not entered
its second quarter before the Mountain was subjected to ruinous
penalties by the abortive rising of 2,000 monks in sympathy with
their compatriots on the mainland. Legend has it that a cross of
light appeared on the summit, bearing, as to Constantine 1,500
years before, the words: "by this conquer." A crushing indemnity
was extracted by the Turks; a garrison of 3,000 soldiers quartered
in the monasteries; and the community reduced to such straits that,
of the seven thousands of monks formerly in residence, only one
remained. Gradually, however, the financial position improved.
Though it received a blow in 1861, when the Rumanian Government, at
their wits' end to infuse life into a still-born state, confiscated
lands of the Athonite monasteries worth &pound;120,000 a year. This
action, though legally indefensible, did not lack the precedent of
the Greek Government itself, which had pursued a similar policy
under Count Capo d'Istria in 1834. But on that occasion so much of
Greece was still Turkey that the Athonite monasteries suffered
comparatively little, their estates being mainly in the north.
Then, in 1878, the Holy Mountain entered on a new stage of its
history, when, for the first time, its autonomy was recognised by
international treaty at Berlin.</p>

<p>The latter vicissitudes of Athos, and their ultimate and
satisfactory conclusion, have been so interwoven with the
Mediterranean policy of Tsarist Russia that their tale is reserved
for Chapter XI. After the Great War, which closed for Greece in
catastrophe, the Hellenic Government, faced with the problem of
supporting a million and a half destitute refugees, confiscated all
the landed property in the kingdom. With the rest of the
proprietors, among them British subjects, the Athonite monasteries
suffered. But the extent of the measure hangs in the balance,
reasonable compensation having been promised by the Greek
Government in 1926&mdash;though not yet paid. At length in 1927,
the constitution of the Mountain, based on nine centuries of
precedent, obtained the ratification of the Hellenic sovereignty.
It is possible, therefore, to give an account of the Mountain's
administrative machinery which bears the stamp of finality.</p>

<p>The rule, or, more exactly, precept, of life enjoined by
Athanasius in 969, and adopted by subsequent foundations on the
Mountain, was not original, sixteen of the clauses being identical
with those laid down by Theodore, Abbot of St. John of Studium in
Constantinople in the first years of the ninth century. Theodore's
ideal was tinged with the Latin concept of usefulness. Under his
aegis, it is thought, was systematised the cursive handwriting
which supplanted uncial, and which had, proportionately as
far-reaching an effect on the distribution of books as the
invention of printing. Hence it was that the practice of
calligraphy and painting was early pressed upon the Athonite monks.
The prohibition of slaves, of private property, of grand clothes
and elaborate food, of caf&eacute;s and houses of ill-fame, was
common to both. The two latter indicate the enormous size to which,
even within the crowded precincts of the capital, the monastic
foundations of the time were apt to swell. In the paragraphs
dealing with slavery, there is nothing of humanitarianism. A
superfluity of domestics was deprecated solely as a luxury.</p>

<p>It is interesting, also, to note that as early as Theodore there
was prescribed that absolute exclusion of the female sex which,
surviving in the twentieth century, has afforded the Mountain its
greatest publicity. "Have no animal," Theodore wrote, and
Athanasius echoed in less explanatory terms, "of the female sex in
domestic use, seeing that you have renounced the female sex
altogether, whether in house or field, since none of the holy
fathers had such, nor does nature require them. Be not driven by
horses or mules without necessity, but go on foot, in imitation of
Christ. But, if there is need, let your beasts be the foal of an
ass." Hard words&mdash;to deliver the fathers and their friends to
the mule for ever. But Theodore scarcely foresaw, nor Athanasius
after him, that they would be applied with the preposterous
inconsequence of later Byzantine Christianity, to a fertile 120
square miles. By the middle of the eleventh century complaint was
already launched against the herds of cows on the Mountain; on the
ground, mainly, that Caryes threatened to develop into a commercial
centre. Regulations were therefore established for a weekly market
only.</p>

<p>Tradition assigns the female rule to another source. The Empress
Pulcheria, it is said, having founded the monastery of Vatopedi,
was summarily bidden remove herself by the Virgin, jealous, after
the fleshly manner of Greek deities, of this encroachment on her
preserve. It is on record that Stephen Dushan, King of Serbia,
brought his Queen on a pilgrimage to Athos. But the rule was
scrupulously observed by the Turkish governor of later days, whose
harem remained forlornly in Constantinople till the two years'
tenure of his office were over. It remained for an Englishwoman,
Lady Stratford de Redcliffe, to achieve the first historical
infringement. As an official of the Constantinople embassy wrote
later, she ought to have known better.</p>

<p>With the coming of the idiorhythmic system and private property,
the path to God of unadulterated mysticism was complicated by works
and ethics. And it was the idiorhythmic monasteries that
contributed to the intellectual revival&mdash;the founding of a
school and printing-press&mdash;which marked the eighteenth
century. To-day, from the point of view of cleanliness and order
they are often the better managed, and have been, when their
resources allowed, the most active in works of assistance. Iviron,
beneath whose roof we lay, maintained until the end of the
nineteenth century, when it ceased to be necessary, a hospital for
lepers. And it was this monastery which, in 1880, presented the
Patriarchate with the large and valuable site of the enormous
red-brick Greek school which dominates the more crowded quarter of
Stamboul. To the building itself another Athonite monastery,
Vatopedi, contributed &pound;3,636.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century the change was marked by the abolition
of the office of abbot in favour of two trustees, known as
<i>epitropoi,</i> aided by a council of elders. Even in those
monasteries that retained the older cenobitic rule, the power of
the abbot was now subject to limitation at the hands of a similar
body; although, in matters spiritual, it was emphasised. These
conditions prevail to-day. The tenure of the abbot is for life. His
advisory council is chosen in some monasteries by himself, in
others by the fathers in corporate session. In the idiorhythmic
houses, the monks are divided into two grades, and it is only from
the higher that the elders are elected. These frequently maintain
in their cells pupils whom they train to step into their shoes when
they die. But in each monastery the system varies.</p>

<p>The outstanding distinction, however, between the cenobitic and
the idiorhythmic lies in their methods of finance. In the former,
before the confiscations, it was the custom to send monks as
overseers, who might ensure the arrival of the revenues from the
various farms and plantations owned by the monastery on the
mainland. These then found their way into the common purse. In the
latter the estates were put up to yearly auction among the elders;
and the highest bidders, having paid a lump sum into the treasury,
could often, with the aid of cheap Albanian labour, make for
themselves 100 per cent profit on their outlay. The younger monks
of these foundations and those of the lower grade, receive a small
payment for their services toward the upkeep of the monastery, and
are given wine, two pounds of bread weekly, and occasional
vegetables. Clothes, books, and extra food they must buy
themselves. It is plain that the system, though pleasant in
prosperity, is not adapted to communal economy. And in times of
stress it has always happened that many of the idiorhythmic
monasteries have been obliged to reconstitute themselves cenobitic.
The position is exemplified at present by the monastery of
Stavronikita, which, although it formally announced in 1926 that it
intended to close down, contains instead of one kitchen, fifteen,
and as many comparatively wealthy elders.</p>

<p>The generosity of the Greek Government, however, allows the
Athonite community privileges which to some extent ameliorate a
financial condition by no means desperate, though unsatisfactory in
comparison with the prosperity of the years before the war. The
monasteries are exempt from death-duties. And all exports and
imports are free of duty. The latter alone are calculated at
seventy million drachmas annually&mdash;approximately
&pound;194,500&mdash;the customary taxes on which must necessarily
deprive the budget of a country containing scarcely seven million
inhabitants of an important sum. On the exports from their estates
on the Mountain, together with the income from previous
investments, the monasteries are now dependent. To quote two random
figures: In 1925, 268 tons of nuts were exported, in addition to
wine, oil, wood, and charcoal. And it is calculated that the Lavra
alone derives an annual revenue of &pound;2,750 from its forests.
Scientific planting is considered superfluous. In light of which,
it may be noted that an Austrian expert, on a recent tour of
inspection, expressed the opinion that the afforestation was as
good as any in Europe. The total yearly expenditure of any single
monastery is hard to gauge. That of Iviron was assessed, before the
war, at between &pound;6,000 and &pound;7,000. But it is now, as
the <i>epitropos</i> was at pains to inform us next morning,
considerably less. The Russian Monastery computes to-day that
containing as it does, 600 monks, &pound;13,700 is the minimum to
which annual expenditure can be reduced.</p>

<p>Leaving aside the somewhat complicated regulations which bind
the smaller communities of cells known as <i>skitai</i> and
<i>kellia</i> to the Ruling Monasteries, there remains to give some
account of the central administration at Caryes, the origins of
which, as has been shown, date back to pre-Athanasian times. On May
10th, 1924, the Holy Synod of the Mountain, following an
extraordinary session, submitted to the Greek Foreign
Office&mdash;the department is significant&mdash;a final draft of
the Athonite constitution, as it has come down to them. This has
now received the ratification of the Hellenic state, and is
incorporated in the letter of the Hellenic constitution. The
following most important sections may serve to illustrate the
fundamentals of the cratic government in our time:</p>

<blockquote><i>None but the twenty Ruling Monasteries may possess
property on the Mountain.<br>
<br>
No increase in the number nor change in the status of the
monasteries is permitted.<br>
<br>
All who embrace the monastic profession on the Mountain are deemed
Greek subjects.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>These clauses have relation to the three foreign monasteries,
Russian, Serbian, and Bulgarian. But their full import will only be
understood after reading Chapter XI.</p>

<blockquote><i>Justice is dispensed by the authorities of the
monasteries, save in penal cases, which are referred to the civil
courts in Salonica.<br>
<br>
The representative of the Greek state on Athos must uphold the
orders of the Holy Synod, provided these accord with the present
constitution.<br>
<br>
Every decision of the Synod that does not run counter to the
constitution is obligatory on the monasteries.<br>
<br>
The administration of the properties of the monasteries is
consigned to the fraternity of each individual one.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>The actual government of the Mountain, which has functioned
uninterrupted over a longer course of years than any in existence,
is divided, like others, into the legislature, or Holy Synod, and
the executive, or Holy <i>Epistasia.</i> With the latter we were
already acquainted.</p>

<p>The Holy Synod numbers twenty members, each monastery sending a
representative on the 1st of January to sit for twelve months.
These reside in the different <i>konakia</i> maintained by the
monasteries in Caryes, one of which, it will be recalled, had been
the scene of our visit to Evlogios. It is responsible for the
security of the monasteries and the maintenance of order; has the
right to investigate all who disembark on the Mountain; and to
expel those whom it considers undesirable. In the event of a
criminal act, the civil authority cannot intervene without its
consent. It must sanction the election of, and invest with office,
all abbots and <i>epitropoi.</i> Finally, its interference in the
domestic affairs of a monastery, though irresistible when invoked,
is permitted only in the most exceptional cases.</p>

<p>The decisions of the Synod are enforced by the <i>Epistasia</i>,
the origin of which is to be found in the chrysobul of Constantine
IX Monomach, dating from 1046. Its full organisation was completed
in 1779, during the term of Patriarch Paisios. The twenty Ruling
Monasteries are divided into five groups of four. These groups are
chosen in annual rotation, each of the monasteries which they
contain sending a deputy chosen for his "experience, education, and
powers of oratory." Save in the case of the <i>Protepistates,</i>
he may, if it is desired, represent his monastery on the Synod in
addition. These four possess the four quarters of the composite
seal of the community, with which they must impress all the
correspondence of the Synod. Their chairman is the
<i>Protepistates,</i> who is the chief monk of the community, but
can only be a member of the leading monastery of each group. They
enjoy also a kind of mayoral dignity, being responsible for the
cleanliness and lighting of the Caryes streets. They possess a
general medical authority, regulate food prices, forbid the opening
of shops during vespers, or on Sundays and official holidays, and
cast a stern eye upon the preparation of non-ascetic foods on
Wednesdays, Fridays, and other fast days. They must maintain a
proper decorum, suppressing all songs, plays, barrel-organs,
smoking, improprieties, and drunkenness. Nor, as we were later to
discover, are these duties a sinecure. In case of need, the
<i>Epistasia</i> acts through the Synod Guard, employing in the
last resort, the state police, of whom there is a small resident
force commanded by one bored officer. These latter possess a tiny
prison in Caryes, tenanted from time to time by holy smugglers.</p>

<p>There exist on the promontory some 5,000 monks. This figure may
be compared with those available at previous dates. By 1489, the
monasteries alone, exclusive of dependent cells, contained 2,246.
This, at the end of the seventeenth century, had increased to
approximately 4,000. Following the Revolution, there remained but
1,450. In 1849 there were 3,000; in 1903, 3,260; though the whole
monastic population of the Mountain, including those outside the
monasteries, by then numbered 7,432. In 1913 the total within the
monasteries rose to 3,742; while, including those without, it fell
to 6,345. To-day, at 5,000 all told, the depletion is due mainly to
the Russians, who have decreased since the war by over 1,000. The
variations of the figures of the Lavra will testify to the
vicissitudes of an individual monastery. Starting under Athanasius
with eighty, it was immediately increased, upon the fresh endowment
of the Emperor John I Tzimisces, to 120. In 1046 it held 700; in
1489, 300; while in 1677 and 1678 there appears a discrepancy
between 600 and 450. With the Revolution the inmates sunk to 60. In
1903 they rose to 165. And they have now returned to their original
quota, in the neighbourhood of 100. Novices are recruited by the
Mountain as a whole at the rate of from 100 to 150 a year,
exclusive of 40 or 50 Russians.</p>

<p>It will be seen from these statistics that the Mountain is no
mere coccyx on the body politic of Europe, but an organism in which
the germs of life are as vigorous as when first implanted. And it
may be enquired, Of what nature is the attraction offered by the
cloister to the man of the twentieth century? The cynic, the
materialist, and he who boasts his common sense, will reply:
Indolence and shelter. Nor will they be wholly at fault. But their
perception is not acute. Institutions are not borne flourishing
through a thousand years on such ideals alone.</p>

<p>In the composition of man there is body, there is reason; so
with the animals. And there is something further, which the animals
do not share. This, the essence of all true satisfaction, takes the
form of a quest. In some its impulse is negligible. In others it
dictates the whole course of existence. Of the latter there are, in
the main, two sorts. There are the humanists, who hold to the
fullness of living, whose faith rests implicit in the virtue of the
earth to set the seal to their desires. For them their Absolute is
inseparable from that alliance of the physical and transcendental
which the language terms Beauty. And, secondly, there are those for
whom no physical interpretation, no channel other than the direct,
can suffice. These are the religious whose goal takes form in God.
The borderline between the two is ill-defined. But they constitute,
none the less, cardinal classifications of human temperament.</p>

<p>It is clear that for the first, the humanists, religion will
frequently mean nothing; and that in no circumstance will it
conjure in them the fundament of emotion that it does in the
second. But it is the tragedy of contemporary transition that for
the second, the instinctively religious aimed towards an Absolute
external to the earth, there exists, in many cases, no religion
adequate to the direction of their imaginings. Thus it happens that
in both&mdash;in the inspired of earth and likewise of
heaven&mdash;there has arisen no mere negative distaste for
Christianity, but an active detestation. This is born, for the
humanist, of the belief that religion of any kind degrades man by
directing himself from himself; for the religious, of the canting
phrase and withered fable, beneath which, as memory tells him, the
emotions of childhood were stifled and unpicked.</p>

<p>To approach those humorous and kindly men, the monks of Mount
Athos, in a temper of psychological understanding, it is necessary
to forswear, if only temporarily, the sting of these prejudices.
Let the humanist realise, atheist though he be, that the religious
seeks, after all, only the same as himself by other roads. And let
the religious who is agnostic visualise to himself another
Christianity, far different from that which has been extended and
distorted through four centuries of uncongenial logic; a
Christianity not yet moulded by Latin materialism to the
convenience of an institution; not wrung by civil wars, combed with
the burrowings of sectarians, and balanced between the parties of
the state like a boulder on a needle; but a single path of
exploration, unclouded by doubtful ethics and hieratic blackmail,
toward the eternal El Dorado. Such was the Christianity that
conquered, and such, on the Holy Mountain, it has remained.</p>

<p>This inflexibility of approach, passion "to be one with the
nature of God," takes, in its most intense manifestations, the form
of mysticism. And on Athos it is the mystic that has left his
imprint, has invested the very air with his outgivings. For him, to
pure contemplation is added a coadjutor, such as the humanists find
in beauty: "Refusing to be deluded by the pleasures of the sense
world, he accepts instead of avoiding pain, and becomes an ascetic;
a puzzling type for the convinced naturalist, who, falling back
upon contempt&mdash;that favourite resource of frustrated
reason&mdash;can only regard him as diseased."[*] To some the
virtue of pain, the divinity of human suffering, is apparent, to
others not. But analogy may be pointed in the opposite sphere; for
few will deny that the world's greatest artists have been those
that have experienced it.</p>

<blockquote>[* Evelyn Underhill: <i>Mysticism.</i>]</blockquote>

<p>In the mystic, all the senses are fused in the impetus of one
inconceivable voyage. "I heard flowers that sounded, and saw notes
that shone"&mdash;a literal testimony of the past (eighteenth
century), and an epitome, for all the reader knew, of the trend of
modern science. It is the forces of the mystics with which the
visitor to Athos, unwittingly perhaps, finds himself in contact.
Only once has the Mountain, in this respect, attracted the
attention of contemporaries. In the fourteenth century, the
Hezychasts, as they were called, claimed to envision, through
perpetual contemplation, the light of the Transfiguration. This
appeared owing to the accident of their sitting with heads bowed,
in their navels, a fact which has brought them the contempt of
posterity. In the controversy that followed they were championed by
Nicolas Cabasilas, Archbishop of Salonica, a sincere literary
exponent of the maligned phenomena which reason was already
discrediting. And it so happens that there survives in the church
of the Protaton in Caryes a contemporary portrait of
this&mdash;almost the only mystic of the later Byzantine Church
whose name has descended to history. In this face, painted as
though by a French impressionist, the mute history of the Mountain
may be read through a thousand years.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch4"></a>Chapter IV. SEAT OF ANGELS</h2>

<p>On the last day of August we issued from the commonplace of
sleep, to discover with surprise that the barrier between ourselves
and the accustomed had emerged from myth of yesterday into
disconcerting reality. Trooping down to the shore, we stood poised
on one edge of the sea, with the sun, opposite, on the other. An
ecstatic calm, smoother than pearls, overspread the water, broken
by the black figure of a shrimping monk, gown tucked above his
knees. Behind, above a broad field scattered park-like with
occasional trees, reared the monastery, topped here and there with
little leaded domes and resembling a great country house. The beach
was stony, and sank with exasperating sloth. Once out, it seemed
impossible ever to come in. We floated, as the Mediterranean
allows, vertically, standing at attention and peering down to the
rocks beneath the water for the octopi and dogfish with whose tales
the monks seek to deter the visitor from these rash excursions.
Ultimately, we returned to coffee and ablutions, the latter
performed at a corner sink in the passage. The <i>epitropos,</i>
full of kindly attentions, assured us of a boat to the Lavra.
Before it could be ready there was half an hour in which to examine
the monastery.</p>

<p>In so short a time we could see no more than the buildings.
Though the third oldest foundation on the Mountain, dating from
about 980, only the original church remains, the rest being mainly
a decorative bastard classical, in particular one enormous tower,
resembling a malformity of a Wren steeple and bearing on its
topmost tier a coloured clock-face attended by a life-size figure
to strike the hours. In every corner of the spacious court, flagged
and grass-grown, stood oleanders clothed in flowers both pink and
white, and orange-trees dripping little green fruits. The
monastery, as its name [<i>Greek characters</i>], implies, was
founded by Georgians, with money granted to Thornic by the Emperor
Basil II Bulgaroctonos in return for his aid in suppressing the
rebellion of Bardas Sclerus. The second abbot was Thomic's nephew,
Euthymius, who wrote the first translation of the Bible in Georgian
language. This manuscript, together with numberless others of
unrivalled importance for the study of Georgian history, was
conserved until 1913, when, according to <i>The Times</i> of
September 13th, the Greek monks, at the height of their anti-Slav
agitation, burnt the whole collection. Whether this was so, we had
no time to verify; nor to inspect such as may remain of the forty
crosses seen by Dr. Covel in 1677, "all studyed and set out with
diamonds, pearles, etc., some of very great bignesse and value."
The monastery was formerly rich, having received a donation of
house property in Moscow from the Tsar Alexis in 1654, whose health
had been restored by an <i>eicon</i> specially prepared by the
monks for the purpose. An electric plant had been installed, to
which the fittings bore witness. But whether it ever worked is not
recorded.</p>

<p>The moment of departure arrived.</p>

<p>"Everything is changed; we have no men," apologised the
<i>epitropos.</i></p>

<p>"What matter?" said I. "We can carry the luggage ourselves."</p>

<p>Feeling that, in fact, it did matter considerably in such heat,
we transported the luggage to the portico, where it was roped to
mules and led down to the arsenal, as the monastic ports, fortified
against pirates, are termed. A boat scarcely larger than a child's
canoe was awaiting us. After some delay another was substituted.
And, propelled by two men, we launched out to sea, sped by a
concert of good-byes.</p>

<p>The water was unrippled, the sun blazed, as gradually bay after
bay, point after point, stretching down from the backbone of the
ridge, hove into view and passed. All the land was furred with
trees and shrubs, thick and ceaseless, stopping short of the water
in white-veined cliffs of grey and green marble, which in their
turn continued into the fathoms, every crevice of their submarine
world revealed by the sun as an aquarium by an arc lamp. As we
moved along, buildings stood at distant intervals: the monasteries
of Philotheou and Caracallou turreted above the water; Mylopotamou,
standing out to sea upon a rock, delectable retreat of exiled
patriarchs, where hermits recuperate from the rigours of their
process; and, inland among the woods, the lonely tower of the
Amalfitans, reminiscent of the Italian venturers who sought the
trade of the East and prayed in their spare hours with the rest of
the mediaeval world. Slowly the ridge rose higher to the summit,
Athos itself, with its gaunt hinder precipices brooding and
imminent, and the pin-point peak flitting in and out the clouds. At
intervals in return for ginger-nuts and cigarettes, the oarsmen
gave us to drink from water kept miraculously cold in an earthen
amphora beneath the seat.</p>

<p>It was three hours, and one o'clock, before we rounded the
southern end of the peninsula and beheld the arsenal tower of the
Lavra dominating a harbour enclosed within an artificial
castellated mole. A monk, resident in a house attached, informed us
that his fellows in the monastery above were now asleep, but that
he would telephone at three o'clock. We decided, meanwhile, to
lunch off our own provisions. The dishes, spread upon a suit-case
and manipulated with a damascened clasp-knife belonging to David,
consisted of the following:</p>

<blockquote><i>P&acirc;t&eacute; de saumon aux truffes<br>
Galantine de poulet et de jambon<br>
Biscuits petit beurre<br>
P&acirc;t&eacute; de foie gras<br>
Noisettes de gingembre<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
VINS<br>
<br>
Eau de siphon &agrave; la maison,</i>
</blockquote>

<p>the latter deriving from a canopied fountain a little way up the
hill. This inimitable meal was followed by a siesta within the
shade of a mulberry-tree, whence both myself and the "Honourable
Robert Curzon, Junr." in the forties, had previously eaten. Below
us, the arsenal tower, approached only by a rickety footbridge,
gleamed white against the deep blue sea. This idyll, pillowed among
black ants and every genus of dried prickle, was interrupted by the
news that the telephone was broken. David and I therefore set off
up the hill to present our letters of recommendation and beg mules
for the transport of the luggage.</p>

<p>The monastery entrance was approached by an enormous domed
portico inset with panes of early nineteenth century coloured
glass, and sheltering a sugary <i>Panaghia</i>[*] of the same date.
As we sat talking to the porter, a crowd of young monks appeared,
among them the guest-master who had attended our wants last
year&mdash;a man of extraordinary resemblance, both in feature and
expression, to the well-known bust of Pericles. These were
followed, creeping round the corner like an ancient musk-rat, by
Father Nicodemus.</p>

<blockquote>[* Virgin.]</blockquote>

<p>"Hail, my father, how are you?" said I. "Do you remember
me?"</p>

<p>He did; and, stretching his wicked face, tufted with pallid red
hairs, to a smile, he took the letters which the Governor and the
Synod had written us. A monk then led us across the courtyard and
up to a large room, apparently already tenanted. Awaiting coffee,
we sat outside on a balcony. Last year, at this the chiefest
monastery, the circumstance of my name and the political parentage
of a companion had brought us a magnificent reception. The
<i>Synodico</i>, reserved for great officials of the church, and
lavishly furnished with carpets, cruets, and clocks under domes,
was placed at our disposal. The Union Jack, blazoned on a red
ensign, was hoisted from the balcony. And a carillon of bells was
pealed as I walked with stately tread by the side of Nicodemus, in
veil and orders. More, I was presented with an address, in which
the last paragraph affirmed that though "to-day you quit our
monastery, you leave indelible memorial upon its history. We who
have had the good fortune to entertain you shall pray always that
the Great Pilot of the Universe, God, may fortify your powers and
prolong your years to the welfare of your nation." It was upon such
assurances as these that David and I had planned our enterprise. We
were now upon the threshold of three of the most important cycles
of frescoes on the Mountain. What if the doors should be closed
against us?</p>

<p>There emerged from the guest-rooms, as the afternoon wore on, a
noted Athenian professor of sacred iconography, unshaven,
collarless, and wearing a black bombazine coat; two Germans in
khaki Norfolk jackets, whose clothes exemplified their national
genius for counteracting the shape of the body; a very old man in
frock coat and evening collar, attached to the Patriarchate in
Constantinople; and finally a monk, not of the Mountain, tall and
well groomed, whose bun of hair behind must have been the envy of
the smartest horse-woman. These were followed by Father Procopius,
the guest-master, a monk of long, ascetic face, speaking like a
rusty gate and clothed in a faded purple cassock patched in
black.</p>

<p>"It is impossible," I said, "for us to share a room with these
others."</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he replied, almost with tears, "you will be alone.
They are all going."</p>

<p>David and I then descended to the refectory, that he might gain
some idea of the work to come. There issued from the buttery a
French-speaking monk. In him we confided our hope of permission to
photograph the paintings.</p>

<p>"You should go and see the doctor," he answered, "the Doctor
Spyridon. He will do everything. He is more even than the
<i>epitropoi."</i></p>

<p>I recalled him as the foremost of our previous hosts. Hurrying
back to the guest-house, we unloosed the parcel of sacred books
which David had purchased as potential bribes from an
Anglo-Catholic Woolworth's in the Oxford High Street; dedicated an
illustrated manual of <i>Cathedral Architecture</i> to Nicodemus,
and another on <i>Anglican Vestments</i> to the doctor, and went
rushing down the courtyard, where we encountered Nicodemus on a
bench. He received the gift with polite suspicion. The doctor lived
up an outside flight of wooden steps, that rose from beside a bed
of blood-red tobacco-flowers. We found him in undress, white beard
awry, greasy white locks trailing on his shoulders, and hands
folded on a pumpkin paunch. He was seated on a semi-roofed balcony
jutting from the outer walls of the monastery, high over the
olive-groves and, as it seemed, the sea. Flowers and clumps of
basil, in round tins washed blue, stood about him, red, yellow, and
green against the different blue of the far-off water. His
sitting-room was decorated with photographs of prominent
ecclesiastics and occasional pieces of embroidery, to one of which
were pinned the white wings of a dove. Peaches, coffee, and
<i>ouzo</i> were handed by a lesser monk. The following
conversation then ensued:</p>

<p>"Hail, my father, how are you?"</p>

<p>"Hail! How do you do? It is good to see you again."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to be once more on the Holy Mountain."</p>

<p>"It is lovely here, is it not?"&mdash;waving his hand out to
sea.</p>

<p>"Very lovely. Do you know, my father, that we are writing a
book?"</p>

<p>"A book?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The English public ignores the very existence of Byzantine
art. We will show them."</p>

<p>"You will show them?"</p>

<p>"We are writing about the frescoes. The finest frescoes in the
world are on Mount Athos, and the finest frescoes on Mount Athos
are at the holy monastery of the Most Great Lavra. We want to
photograph them."</p>

<p>"Ah! Photograph them! Those in the refectory?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but those in the church as well."</p>

<p>"In the church? Why not the refectory?"</p>

<p>"Those in the church are better. We want England and the entire
world to talk of the frescoes at the Lavra. Those in the refectory
are interesting but not beautiful. We have come all the way from
England to photograph those in the church."</p>

<p>"All the way from England," he echoed reflectively.</p>

<p>"Tell us, my father, will there be difficulties?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. I will ask the <i>epitropoi.</i> Come round
to-morrow morning and have coffee with me early."</p>

<p>"Early? At what time?"</p>

<p>"Oh, early, as the sun rises."</p>

<p>"But at what hour?"</p>

<p>"At eleven by Byzantine time."</p>

<p>"That is seven by Frankish?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. We will hope for news in the morning. Good
night, my father."</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p>Fevered still with uncertainty, we returned to the guest-house
as it grew dark. Dinner arrived; and with it all the raw
hideousness of the true Athonite meal burst upon the uninitiates.
Is it that our palates have changed? For in previous centuries
travellers spoke of these unchanging dishes with relish and
appreciation. Thus notes Dr. Covel of his experience at the Lavra
in 1677: "...the best monkish fare that could be gotten was
provided, excellent fish (severall ways), oyl, salet, beanes,
hortechokes, beets, chees, onions, garlick, olives, caveor, Pyes of
herbs, [<i>Greek characters</i>], pepper, salt and saffron in all.
At last conserved little oranges, most exquisite, good wine (a sort
of small claret) and we alwayes drank most plentifully...He is no
Greek that cannot drink twenty or thirty plump glasses at a
setting." A more accurate analysis of the Mountain's resources at
the present time cannot be penned. Though in the word [<i>Greek
characters</i>] not everyone perhaps has sensed the awful threat of
octopus. Belon, writing over a century earlier&mdash;in
1553&mdash;corroborates these details, and adds one more of
profound and unswerving truth: <i>"Ces Caloieeres</i> (monks)
<i>commencent tousiours leur repas par oignons avec des Aux."</i>
Even the Virgin, we suspect, during her mortal visit, started her
meals with <i>hors d'oeuvre</i> of chopped onion and garlic.</p>

<p>Even during our state visit the food at the Lavra had been
nasty. The others, who had sneered at my warnings over the
comparative normality of dinner at Iviron, now paled before the
grime of cloth and napkins; spoons, knives and forks slimed with
grease; the inevitable <i>hors d' oeuvre;</i> soup of haricot
beans; those unmentionable vegetables, resembling large cut nails
and filled with pips tasting of stale pharmaceutical peppermint;
and an omelette of whipped oil. The Germans told a story that
lasted three-quarters of an hour by a Turkish grandfather clock in
the corner that had hailed from Croydon in the eighteenth century;
at which David, who speaks German, grew more and more morose; while
Mark, who does not, emitted peals of glazed and meaningless
laughter. At last we retired, two to a small room of which we had
extracted the key from Father Procopius; the others to keep company
the Germans. On approaching the beds, flocks of red bugs might be
seen frolicking over the striped holland of cement mattresses.
Fountains of blood&mdash;we wondered whose&mdash;squirted from
their bodies as we pressed them flat like gooseberry skins. Indeed,
it has become our intention to add yet another to those charming
publications which reveal the intimacies of nature and God's hand
to the little ones. A new generation of children, instead of being
shown the seashore, shall "Ramble Mid Maneaters on the Mountain."
In the case of those still hidden, our Athenian deterrent proved
efficacious.</p>

<p>Next morning we went, as arranged, to the doctor's. But the
confusion entailed by translating our own time into one which
varies daily with the rising of the sun, made us late, and he was
already gone to the monastery council, to plead, we hoped, our
cause. At eleven we returned, to find that he had succeeded. He led
us to the council house, where an <i>epitropos</i> rang an outside
bell. Another monk appeared, to whom he gave orders, which were
communicated to the sacristan. The key was fetched; the doors
opened. But as David, loaded with tripod and plates, was about to
enter, a diminutive and bespectacled fanatic shot into the doorway,
where he remained, arms outstretched, making passes with his fist
at the camera. His fellows were less impressed than we, and hustled
him away. Thus at last our objective was reached and concern
dispelled.</p>

<p>That day the other guests departed. Henceforth, for five more,
the two rooms were ours alone. So also, after a few jokes and
presents of cigarettes, were Father Procopius and his underling,
Father Bartholomew. The food changed; we provided butter instead of
oil; and we insisted on its being served hot. The "small claret"
flowed, diluted in the midday heat from the syphon. Occasional
Greek guests, coming and going, were forbidden our privacy.</p>

<p>The form and atmosphere of each individual monastery present a
varying study, according to whether it is idiorhythmic or
cenobitic, to its traditions, and to the personal characteristics
of its elders, abbot, or <i>epitropoi.</i> But all have certain
features in common. And to describe the Lavra is to describe the
prototype of them all.</p>

<p>To picture the foundation of Athanasius as it stands and has
stood for all but 1,000 years, towers and storehouses, church and
chapels, refectory, library, treasury, and guest-house, fountains,
shrines, trees, flower-beds, and endless rows of cells, all grouped
within a fortified enclosure&mdash;imagine the stupendous peak
risen 6,500 feet from the water; and on a spur, where it splays out
to stabilise the impact with this other element, a sloping platform
still a steep 500 feet above the shore, planted with gardens. This
is the site. Look down from above, where the salad-green vines drop
their clusters of cold blue grapes against the red earth; where
peaches, figs, and walnuts flourish by a mountain stream, dammed in
a reservoir to work a mill; there appears, amid an ocean of olives
spired with the dark points of cypresses, a small embattled town.
Come near, to the four-pillared portico, where the crimson
oleanders fringe a broad-roofed verandah buttressed out of the
hill, to shelter the monks at evening. Enter the double doors,
clamped with plate upon plate of blue-washed iron. Salute the
porter in his lodge, round which variety of necessaries, tasselled
rosaries, black monkish slippers, bread-moulds chip-carved into the
eagles of the Church, and Canadian salmon, are for sale. Twist a
corner up a narrow slope. Penetrate yet another plated door through
the inner wall. And here is the courtyard, a thin rectangle, some
400 feet by 150.</p>

<p>At the back, white against an overhanging scrub-grown hump,
itself a mountain fastening all the clouds that pass, the square
serrated tower of the Emperor John Tzimisces stands from the wall,
approached by a labyrinth of wooden stairs and eremitic balconies.
Viewed from the top, the plan of the buildings is revealed,
enclosed between the long irregular lines of cells tiled with stone
slabs that gleam silver in the sun as they convolute away. In the
centre stands the refectory, cruciform and bellying with age, its
lichen-covered roofs reaching almost to the ground. Tradition
ascribes to its site an ancient temple of Minerva, to which a few
worn and inappropriate capitals give evidence upon its loggia.
Within, the walls are adorned with horrifying martyrdoms, together
with more familiar scenes: the Last Judgment, hell mouthing flames
in rivers; the Last Supper, serene within the apse; and, upon the
opposing end walls of the transept, a tree of Jesse, and the death
of St. Athanasius&mdash;the latter Giottesque in its dignity and
feeling. The prevailing colours are reds and greys upon an indigo
background, all overlaid with the darkening haze of candle-smoke.
The monastery being idiorhythmic, however, many centuries have
passed since the monks have habitually dined in common at the
horseshoe marble slabs grooved for gravy, which stand in a double
row on thick, squat bases surrounded by seats of solid stone topped
with board. The ceiling, of painted planks, is slightly coved, and
adorned with coloured baskets of fruit in the Turkish classical
manner.</p>

<p>Over the entrance presides the Virgin, hard and austere, set in
an aura of cubiform grey on a gentian ground. Between her and the
church opposite stand the two cypresses, giant bushy cones planted
one by St. Athanasius, the other by his coadjutor, Euthymius of
Daphni. These spring each from a stone ring, three feet high and
one thick, which is washed in the ubiquitous Greek blue, colour
between bluebells and a pastel sky. In the centre is the phiale, a
deep leaden dome upheld by an open ring of pillars with Turkish
capitals, which are balustraded at the bottom with ancient panels
of Byzantine relief. With the exception of the latter, this
structure, "the handiwork of Mercury and Atzali," dates from 1635;
as also the painting within the dome, which, though presumably
restored, since it is open to the air, carries the symbolic
anti-naturalism of the monastic artist to a fabulous pitch. The
subject is the baptism of Christ. From a circular composition of
the company of angels in the centre, golden doors open to emit a
tongue of geometric flame, bearing a dove to the head of Christ,
enrivered in the Jordan. In the circular frieze that continues
round the lower part, formalised vermilion horses prance against
mountains alternately of bright orange and deep purple. The whole
is made doubly brilliant by the violence of the white
high-lights.</p>

<p>Underneath this dome is its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre,</i> the
fountain, in this case&mdash;for all the monasteries possess
phiales of one kind or another&mdash;one of the most remarkable
objects on the Mountain. From the centre of an enormous monolith
basin, some eight feet in diameter and of extreme antiquity, rises
a bronze tube bearing circular tiers of expectorating beasts, and
surmounted by a horned eagle, wings outstretched. The whole
character of this conduit, which has in all, twenty-eight jets, is
strongly reminiscent of the Iranian and Sarmatian wrought metal
ornaments unearthed in South Russia and the Caucasus, the finest
animal representations in existence. Indeed, the traditions that
the Athonite fountains embody is one of extraordinary interest. The
idea of water-healing originated in the fourth century; and, with
the rebuilding of St. Sophia by Justinian, a huge fountain was
erected outside, whence the population of Constantinople used to
collect the water for the cure of their maladies on Epiphany Eve. A
survival of this was the famous ceremony of the blessing of the
waters conducted at the Russian court on the same date. Later it
was at such phiales as the Lavra's that the Byzantine Emperors were
wont to receive the rival teams of the Hippodrome before the races.
A detail of one of them, in the precincts of the imperial palace,
bears a curious likeness to the present; "On the cornice which
surrounded the phiale stood cocks, goats, and rams of bronze,
vomiting water into the bottom of the basin."[*] That of the Lavra
is painted primrose yellow. As if to add to the babel of
motives&mdash;Turkish, Byzantine, and Iranian&mdash;two ancient
marble dogs, seated beneath, smile and twist their flat-nosed faces
in a manner which can only be described as early Chinese.</p>

<blockquote>[* J. Ebersolt: <i>Le grand palais de
Constantinople.</i>]</blockquote>

<p>Behind the phiale and the two cypresses stands the church, built
by St. Athanasius and later repaired at the cost of his life. From
the centre rises a broad, shallow cupola, flanked by two
subsidiaries, each bearing leaded, shell-like domes, and surmounted
by elaborate wire crosses. The building is washed the colour of a
dying crimson-tinted wallflower, the cupolas being picked out in
white, as also the splayed stone foundation which runs like a bench
round the bottom. Entrance is effected opposite the phiale. But the
old <i>narthex</i> (vestibule), where formerly the visitor was
shown the cell and library of St. Athanasius himself, was
demolished in 1814, and the present conservatory of coloured glass
substituted. This is supported on a white marble base, sparsely
carved by an Armenian with mystic symbols. Horribly frescoed
within, it conceals a pair of magnificent Turkish baroque wooden
doors, deeply undercut to represent the eagles of the Orthodox
Church, below which the church that they adorn is transformed into
the semblance of a triple-towered pagoda. These are painted gold,
brown, mustard, orange, and deep blue, on a background of white.
They give entrance to the church proper, and it was here that David
encountered the fanatic.</p>

<p>Inside, the paintings, dated from 1535 and very restrained in
colour, occupy, as the rule prescribed, every inch of the walls.
But the general effect is spoiled by the high grey marble
<i>eiconostasis,</i> picked out with gold, which divides the apse
from the nave. To the right and left are two chapels. In the
former, delicately sprung from four pillars of deeply marked pink
marble, lies the tomb of St. Athanasius of Athos, covered with a
modern silver sheath and hung about with trinkets. Opposite is the
chapel of St. Nicolas, containing its old seventeenth-century
screen of carved and gilded wood, and frescoed by the "hand of the
most good-for-nothing Frangos Catellanos of Thebes in
Boeotia"&mdash;so he signed himself in 1560. The nave is supported
on four pillars, above the two foremost of which stand portraits of
the two great soldier-Emperors of Constantinople, who were the
monastery's original benefactors&mdash;Nicephorus II Phocas and
John I Tzimisces&mdash;each crowned and invested with the imperial
robes: the former with long hair flowing upon his shoulders, lover,
fighter, mystic, the very quintessence of the mysterious Byzantine
character; the latter bearing in his hands the church, from which
may be seen the <i>narthex</i> as it originally looked, and the
habitation above of its sainted architect. Frequently repainted,
though probably with that extreme accuracy which characterised the
monkish restorers, it is possible that these were, in their
original versions, almost contemporary portraits. As such, their
interest for the historian is enormous.</p>

<p>It is difficult, without a long study of the subject, to give an
account of the numberless <i>eicons</i> which adorn the churches
and chapels of the Athonite monasteries. Alone in the world, the
Holy Mountain bears adequate witness to the magnificence of
technique and colouring which this lesser province of the Byzantine
Renaissance attained. Of those at the Lavra, the two great pictures
of Christ Pantocrator and the Virgin on either side of the
<i>eiconostasis'</i> central doors are sheeted round the figures
with silver gilt, wrought in a filigree of such intricacy as to
produce a texture rather than a design, and studded with plaques of
Byzantine enamel gleaming like a kingfisher from its depths.
Similarly ornamented, though smaller, is the picture in the back of
the bishop's throne, a tall canopied erection of carved and gilded
wood dating from 1635. The majority, however, are unmetalled. And
it is these which, as paintings, attract the greater interest. One
in particular, behind the altar, is noticeable for a Latin
scutcheon represented as attached to the cross below the feet of
Christ crucified.</p>

<p>Our rooms lay on the left, near the entrance, leading off an
arcaded verandah on the first floor, which possessed at one end the
inevitable marble sink. The building was old, having been built as
a hospital in 1580. But five years later&mdash;on Friday, the 15th
of July, 1585&mdash;"there was a great and most terrible
earthquake, which destroyed the dome of the Lavra and the cupola of
the hospital (now guest-house)...The sea was so disturbed that the
water in the harbour retired without to its mouth." To this
circumstance, perhaps, was due the subsequent transformation.</p>

<p>Its decorations were of a singularly modern fashion. Round the
verandah ran a dado painted to resemble black and pink marble
bordered with porphyry. The ceiling was of boards alternately
chocolate and dull yellow, which were interrupted by a
diamond-shaped panel of blue powdered with brighter yellow stars.
Realism was enhanced by a clock of one dimension near the door,
whose hands stood everlastingly at thirteen minutes past eleven.
The large, low room within, furnished with an L of broad divans,
and having five windows in the farther wall overlooking all the sea
to Thasos, was divided at the near end by a row of three pillars,
whence sprang coved ceilings decorated with borders and arabesques
of mulberry-red and brown. The pillars were boldly marbled in grey
and black, and bound with primrose bands in lieu of brass, the
bases and capitals prominent with fictitious reliefs. Around the
walls hung matchless prints of the Hellenic history in the
nineteenth century: George I mid plush and palms of frightful
prominence; Queen Olga rigid in coronet and bustle; the granting of
the constitution; and the raising of the standard of Independence.
In the middle two tables, draped and fringed, groaned beneath a
permanent cruet and our own transitory comforts.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch5"></a>Chapter V. VISITING</h2>

<p>The habits of frivolous children of the world were powerless
against the traditions of half the Christian era. And our days
assumed a complexion of monastic regularity, both in the ordering
of their hours and the sobriety with which we set each to his
avocations. The morning opened as a rule with myself, a small
sleeper. At half-past six, assuming a dressing-gown of green silk
for the benefit of passing monks, I paddle along the verandah to
the kitchen; there to find Fathers Procopius and Bartholomew
presiding over an enormous wood-burning range, the chimney of which
protrudes from the wall in the form of a black canopy.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Father Procopius!"</p>

<p>"Ah/Ah," he replies on two different notes, "good morning. Have
you slept well?"</p>

<p>"Very, thank you. Can I have some hot water?"</p>

<p>"Hot water?! Ah/Ah"; and with never-failing surprise he twists
the tap of a sooted cauldron to emit a thin boiling stream into a
pewter plate, hand-beaten and marked on the rim with a criss-cross
pattern. Thus fashioned are all the utensils of the Athonite
kitchen, stewpans, ewers, and basins; likewise even the
drinking-cups attached to the roadside fountains. The less
pretentious vessels are of pottery, roughly glazed and decorated at
intervals with large eyes of colour. Though wholly modern, they
differ in no respect from those which David had lately disinterred
from Constantinople Hippodrome. While it might equally be supposed,
out of their context, that they had been designed by Picasso.
Holding the plate by means of one of a row of kettle-holders ranged
neatly on a shelf, I return to the sink which projects from the
balcony, offering a fine view to the courtyard. The tap, fixed in a
backing of carved marble, shoots Niagara into the pit of the
stomach. From the plate I shave. And monks beneath slacken their
footsteps to gaze upon this curious operation.</p>

<p>At length we all dress, and return to the kitchen bearing a box
of ginger-nuts; in response to which Father Procopius leads us to
his inner cabinet, "the housekeeper's room." As the insistence of
our needs became irresistible, he conceived a devotion for us,
after the manner of a good-hearted fowl&mdash;dour perhaps in
appearance, and appalled by the eruption of a brood of unmanageable
ducklings, but determined to do her duty by them. Eventually, with
the sly look of the true housekeeper, he goes to a cupboard.
<i>Ouzo</i> is fetched from a shelf, the distillation of his
heart.</p>

<p>"Your health, father!" Or, as it is literally said, "Your
hygiene!"</p>

<p>"Your health!"</p>

<p>Bartholomew then appears, bearing coffee; his gait and beard are
those of Henry VIII, his speech faster and more indistinct than
that of a Frenchman in a railway accident. After a discussion of
the sea and the weather, and a council on lunch, we return to our
occupations.</p>

<p>David, in any case, must betake himself with camera to the
church. Its keeper, dubious at first, became more reconciled to our
unhooking of lamps and balancing on the elbows of stalls after I
had surreptitiously presented him with a packet of cigarettes
enclosed within the sheep's clothing of a medicine-box. It happened
that we remained over Saturday, when the church is cleaned in
preparation for the morrow. This the sacristan and his myrmidons
were doing by spreading damp sawdust over the floor to suck up the
dirt, then sweeping it away again. Could we wait a quarter of an
hour, till it was finished? David, whose temper had been deranged
by the food and the refusal to allow him to penetrate the
<i>eiconostasis</i> to photograph an Ascension, brushed them aside.
Stumping over the sawdust, he launched out upon the portion of the
floor already swept, trailing clouds of the adhesive cleanser in
his wake. But the monks, instead of annoyance, exhibited only mirth
at so ridiculous a sight. Diving for his feet, they pinioned him
till every trace of the offending dust was removed. The work of
both parties then continued. A monk was always at hand to guard us
from stealing the objects without price contained in the church. In
this capacity even the fanatic reappeared, seemingly penitent for
his outburst, and deeply interested in the lens of the camera,
while we stood ready to fasten his arms in case of assault. It
appeared, indeed, that our having obtained permission to photograph
in the church caused some sensation, as I was perpetually hearing
snatches of conversation in the courtyard linking my name with this
unholy work. Meanwhile Mark and Reinecker were sketching; and
myself, if not assisting David, noting the colour and form of the
paintings upon which he was engaged. Lunch was usually at
11.30&mdash;a late hour for the monks, who like to be asleep by
then, and a concession to our barbarous inconsequence. Afterwards
we also slept till the close of the afternoon service at four. From
then till dark the work continued again.</p>

<p>Our friend the doctor had gone to Caryes on business. But a
frequent visitor was his Elisha, Father Dorotheos Benardos, a vain
youth of twenty, who was now in sole charge of the doctor's little
house and balcony. He arrived one day bearing in gift a quartet of
books on the Athonite constitution; and proceeded to stay, two gold
front teeth gleaming like a lighthouse from his bearded lips and a
smell of stale garlic exuding from his person. At length, too tired
to concoct further conversation, I prevailed on Mark to draw him,
and translated the intention. His demeanour was immediately that of
an embarrassed typist apprised of her success in a beauty
competition.</p>

<p>"Oh, good gracious! Do my portrait? And without a veil? I've
only got my old hat on. And no gown. Can you lend me one? No, of
course not...I forgot. Shall I sign it when it's done? Where would
you like me to sit?"</p>

<p>Swishing about the room, he came to rest on a Windsor chair,
profile to the window. He straightened his cassock; he arranged his
feet. And finally, removing his cap, he loosed upon his shoulders a
flood of black frizzy hair.</p>

<p>Earlier that morning, on my visiting the doctor and finding him
gone, Dorotheos Benardos had opened his soul to me on the balcony.
He had lived, he said, in Piraeus, and had been on the Mountain
four years. But he had not forgotten Athens. And then, as if to
prove it, he started a recital of the town's pleasure
resorts&mdash;Phaleron, the Zappeion, and Kephissia&mdash;as an
exile in the colonies might sigh over the lost days of Earl's Court
exhibitions and the river at Maidenhead. A silence fell between us
at this painful juncture.</p>

<p>Then he turned to me and said:</p>

<p>"[<i>Greek characters</i>],&mdash;I am a man of the world."</p>

<p>A day or two later he began again:</p>

<p>"A few years ago a man died here who had a number of English
medals." (Greeks frequently obtained them in the war.)</p>

<p>"Medals?" I replied, not wholly understanding the word.</p>

<p>"Yes, medals," he repeated, drawing imaginary ribbons on his
chest. "When you return to England, will you send me some?"</p>

<p>"Send you medals? But how, and for what reason?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Can't you go to the Foreign Office in London, and have
them sent to me?"</p>

<p>"But why? You have done nothing."</p>

<p>"No, but I will. I will do great things. I love England."</p>

<p>"You must do them first. Besides, the Foreign Office does not
distribute medals."</p>

<p>"The Foreign Office does not distribute medals? Who does?"</p>

<p>"The King."</p>

<p>"Have you visited the King?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I visited our Kings three times." Pause. "But when you get
back, you will send me those medals?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Silence. Each gazes at the sea, breathing hard.</p>

<p>"What can I do to be famous? I do want to be famous."<br>
<br></p>

<p>Thus sped the days. But towards evening, the sun having fallen
preternaturally early owing to the imminence of the hill behind,
the personalities of the party, sharpened by fatigue and the
prospect of food, assumed a prominence of which the overpowering
background was apt to deprive them. For the first half of our stay
the great expanse of sea overlooked by our five windows was
unruffled, assuming as the westerly night surged up, a solid and
unearthly calm, flecked only by currents acres in extent. And once,
caught on Thasos, three puffy clouds, pink with the reflected
sunset behind us, sent three definite reflections forty miles over
the sea to the shore beneath&mdash;an uncanny spectacle, as though
this giant space was but a mirror. Then, swiftly, darkness comes;
the solitary hanging lamp is lit; another wheedled out of Father
Procopius for a nail in the wall. And the party is alone with
itself.</p>

<p>Mark, a cheeping chorister of our schooldays, has retained,
despite the blottery tenor that has displaced his treble, a habit
of uttering with the suddenness of a ship's siren, the less
interesting of Schubert's ditties. To David, spasmodically musical,
each burst is of greater variation from the author's prescription
than he can endure. Seeking retaliation, he hits upon those
emunctory sounds that frequently result from a surfeit of radishes.
And Father Procopius, tottering through the door, finds himself,
often as not, deafened between an exhibition of competitive
street-singing and the echoes of a vomitorium. There follows food,
to which the saddle-bags contribute biscuits, chutney, and tinned
appetisers, more delicate than sustaining. During the meal argument
arises. Reinecker betrays the trust in rational thought that
characterises the war generation. I, incapable of logic, take
refuge in insult. David, mistaking the two or three months'
schedule of our present venture for a life based on consciously
reasoned motive, hurls the accusation of such upon me. Receiving a
blow in return, he decides to leave for England next day. Then goes
snorting to the smaller bedroom to develop the day's plates. This
occupies an hour. Mark, chippy with sleep, gyrates to and fro, till
the plates are heard washing in the sink outside. He then picks his
way through a garbage of broken glass and scrumpled paper, cursing
to bed.</p>

<p>As the work in the church progressed satisfactorily, we fixed
our departure for Monday. The Saturday previous, day of David's
misadventure with the sawdust, Mark and I decided to occupy that
odious period the afternoon, as is customary, by walking over to
tea with a neighbour. The latter in this case was the Rumanian
<i>skiti</i> of the Prodrome, or Forerunner, as the Orthodox Church
calls St. John the Baptist, situated an hour away. It was extremely
hot as we climbed upward from the monastery, shoes torn and feet
bruised by the irregular white cobbles of this most typically
Athonite road. Enquiring the way of a passing muleteer, we
eventually turned off to the left towards the sea again, guided
thither by a cross stuck on a tree revealing the monogram of the
Saviour and the objectives of the confluent paths. At a long
trough, shaded within a wood of ilexes, we drank and bathed our
faces. There then appeared a white quadrangle of buildings, having
over its gateway a high tower. Vespers were in progress. But a monk
with a broad flat face wholly unlike that of a Greek, beckoned us
within the church, where we remained for an hour, unwilling
listeners to the nasal Balkan chanting. The building was erected in
1857, and contains only one feature of interest&mdash;a
wonder-working <i>eicon,</i> painted by the Angels in 1860.</p>

<p>We were entertained, when the service was over, by a
Greek-speaking monk, shrunken and ill, who said he had asthma and
needed a doctor. We suggested Spyridon. But he had already visited
him. We then discussed his foundation. The first Rumanians came
here in 1820. There were now about fifty; which was, he pointed
out, very few, considering that in Turkish times nearly all the
Athonite monasteries had been re-endowed by the generosity of the
trans-Danubian Voivodes and Hospodas, the only Christian princess
who preserved their old Byzantine status of semi-independence under
the Ottoman dominion. Indeed, since the Balkan wars it has been a
grievance against Greece, and one that has lately come to a head in
an official interchange of notes, that Rumania should remain
distinct from the other Balkan states in not sending recruits to
one of the Ruling Monasteries. It is desired that the present
<i>skiti</i> should be advanced to such a status. This request,
however, neither the ecclesiastical nor lay authorities can
grant.</p>

<p>Our asthmatic friend begged us to stay the night. It would have
pleased us to do so. The rooms seemed clean, that in which we sat
being adorned with a print of the massacre of Smyrna in 1922, in
which the martyrs of the twentieth century were depicted falling
into the sea with haloes affixed to their bowler hats. But the
others were expecting our return. And after visiting the monks at
supper in the refectory&mdash;for the <i>skiti</i> is
cenobitic&mdash;we took our leave, fearful of the shutting of the
Lavra doors. "Lock-up" takes place in every monastery at twelve
o'clock by Byzantine time&mdash;that is, between seven and eight.
Oppressed with the setting of the sun, we quickened our tread,
barging into bushes and tripping over stones, like two Aberdonians
on a comic postcard. On return, we discovered David and Reinecker
had struck up a friendship with the gardener. Having eaten
themselves into the initial stages of dropsy, they had brought away
for us a tray of grapes, figs, peaches, and even a melon. Their
intention had been to bathe; but, finding themselves anointed with
the sewage of the arsenal, they had retired in disgust and
encountered their benefactor half way up the hill. He talked to us
all, next day&mdash;an old man with white beard and a sunburnt
pippin face rendered wholly different by contact with the soil from
the inhuman visages of his fellows, always in the clouds.</p>

<p>That evening a storm broke, lightning flashed, the building
creaked, and the windows threatened to blow from their frames.
Sunday dawned overcast, rain dropping. And it seemed as though the
<i>damnosa hereditas</i> of the English race, the English Sabbath,
had followed us even here. Oppressed with this feeling, we changed
our clothes instinctively for better. Without, the wind howled and
the sea, a deeper blue, rolled white horses. In the afternoon we
went to church, having first watched the ceremony of its
announcement; a monk in a pleated gown marching round the church
beating a metallic savage rhythm on the <i>semandron</i>, a piece
of hardened wood six feet long and carried on the shoulder. As the
rhythm gathered, other monks assembled, hurriedly slipping into
gowns and veils as they arrived, like undergraduates late for
chapel. With them we entered; endured the service more for
politeness' than religion's sake; and, after it, proceeded to the
farther end of the courtyard, to be shown the books and treasures.
These were kept in three separate compartments, guarded by iron
doors.</p>

<p>In the inspection of manuscripts, my enthusiasm, subverted by
ignorance, flags. The library of the Lavra, however, contains none
of importance, though a late Byzantine <i>herbarium,</i> profusely
illustrated, offered a certain entertainment. But in the treasury,
opened by two keys in the keeping of separate persons, our
attention was alert. There was an excitement in the handling of a
chrysobul with golden seal and actual scarlet signature of
"Andronicus faithful in Christ King and Emperor of the Romans the
Palaeologus," complete. Many book-covers, reliquaries, patriarchal
crowns, patens, chalices, and crosses were exposed to view in
glass-fronted cupboards&mdash;some indifferent, some of pre-Turkish
times. But one object alone preoccupied us: the Nicephorus Phocas
Bible. The far-famed stole said to have been worn by the Emperor,
is scarcely earlier than the eighteenth century. But of this book,
and of its companion reliquary, the royal deed of gift, dated 970,
is still preserved at Caryes to attest the authenticity.</p>

<p>Of the reliquary we were unfortunately ignorant, and there is, I
believe, no recorded instance of a visitor's having seen it during
the present century. Description, however, is extant, and may be
quoted, as relative to a world masterpiece, beside which the great
Bible, now, by permission of Nicodemus, actually within our hands,
ranks only second. The case, which encloses a piece of the Cross
seven inches long, is of silver gilt, approximately a foot and a
half by a foot and opening on top with folded doors like a
triptych. These are set with enormous <i>cabouchon</i>
jewels&mdash;diamonds, emeralds, and rubies, as well as pearls,
which alternate with medallions of saints in enamel. There are
twelve rows of eight each; and the two largest pearls measure over
an inch and a half across. With the exception of the loot stolen
from Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, and now in the
treasury of St. Mark's, such objects are unknown in the West. And
even those cannot compare, either in age or workmanship, with the
ones at present under review.</p>

<p>The cover of Nicephorus Phocas' Bible, measuring about twelve
inches by nine, forms one side of a contemporary manuscript of the
Gospels, to the front of which have been added three or four pages
in uncials that would seem to date, at the latest, from the eighth
century. It is curious that these alone did not attract the
attention of those earlier travellers, to whom anything in the
nature of Byzantine art appeared "ugly" or "in bad taste," and who
have passed the book without mention. The metal itself is of that
exquisite colour, a pale, sour gold, which silver gilt achieves
with age. The stones inset include, beside the more precious
varieties mentioned above, cornelian, amethyst, garnet, lapis, and
beryl. At the corners are four huge crystals, beneath which are
visible the sacred monograms of Christ and the Virgin. Below the
feet of the Christ is a cushion, patterned in dark grey on white
enamel, similar to that upon the open pages of the book held in the
left hand. At the shoulders, on either side, are the half-lengths
of two saints in brighter enamels. The halo is composed of two rows
of small grey pearls.</p>

<p>But, apart from the intrinsic beauty of material and
workmanship, the gorgeous austerity of the relief itself
constitutes the real aesthetic value. It is hard to analyse, this
supreme mastery of semi-sculpture possessed by the mediaeval
Greeks, so unlike, so superior to the glucose formulae of their
ancestors. It would seem to lie in the combination of a supreme
purity of design with an extraordinary manipulation of surfaces,
the infinitesimal angularisation of every contour. In this province
the Byzantine craftsman is distinguished from his fellows of all
ages.</p>

<p>We lingered over the examination. For it seemed as though it
were possible, in handling this memorial to that compound of
sophistication and the supernatural which invested the capital of
the Eastern Empire, to imbibe, personally, something of its spirit.
At length it was returned to its cupboard, and, crossing the
courtyard to where we espied Nicodemus on his bench, we thanked him
for the monastery's hospitality and requested mules for the
continuation of our journey. The malignity of his countenance was
dispersed in smiles; and, enquiring, after the work, he beckoned us
within the council-house, complete with telephone and monkish
secretary, where the pealing of the bell brought us the usual tray
of restoratives. Having retrieved our letters of recommendation, we
repeated our thanks and returned to dinner.</p>

<p>A feeling of sadness now overcame us, and Father Procopius too.
Ap&eacute;ritifs came in dozens, followed by an omelette into which
Bartholomew had cooked his very soul. The evening ended with
ineffectual vows to pack at once against an early start. Outside,
the wind was still howling, sending flickers down the lamp-chimneys
with each gust. What hope for the morrow, with all dependent on the
weather?</p>

</p>

<p><i>&mdash;"THE BUKE OP JOHN MANDEUILL,"<br>
First circulated about 1360.</i>
</p>

<p>Nicodemus had arranged that we should start at dawn; and the
fear that we might not wake was eliminated by a violent chanting
which began at 3 a.m. in a chapel on the verandah, the doors of
which, at our very ear, we had formerly conceived to denote another
guest-room. The very irritation of being thus woken now precluded
our arising. And the muleteer, arriving for the luggage, found us
still in bed. But as the volume of the service grew, each larynx
stretched to burst, we were obliged to shave, half-clothed,
scarcely ten yards off the open doors of the chapel. Meanwhile the
muleteer stood by in readiness for each of our thirteen pieces of
luggage as it shut. A present of 1,000 drachmas, average of half a
crown each nightly, was pressed into Father Procopius' hand,
accompanied by the formal utterance of "a present for the church."
And he, overwhelmed with the aggregate of what was not in fact a
large rate of donation, rose to his private cupboard and filled a
bottle with his personal <i>ouzo</i>, to keep us warm during the
coming day and night. He was now torn with remorse to recall the
food he had provided, and enumerated its horrors in a litany of
penitence, with which we could only concur. It came to us that, had
we been able to deposit our offering at the beginning instead of
the end of our stay, things might have been different. But there
lies the charm of the Mountain: there is no distinction between
rich and poor. All are equal suppliants of a hospitality, the
nature of which no external authority can dictate. It is this, let
us hope, that may preserve it from the track of the globe-trotter.
He will shrink from difficulty of the language, the nauseating
victuals, the inhabitants of the beds, the indescribable
sanitation, and the absence of wheeled locomotion. And from his
wife, at least, usually the worst of him, Athos is safe.</p>

<p>The muleteer was counting the luggage.</p>

<p>"You must have another animal," he said, blenching. "Go and ask
Nicodemus. He is below at the council-house."</p>

<p>"Come with me."</p>

<p>He came and made the request. Nicodemus uttered refusal. To
which I, a little annoyed, replied:</p>

<p>"If the holy monastery of the Most Great Lavra is unable, or
does not wish, to give us the necessary mules, are there any here
for which we can pay?"</p>

<p>He was stung to apology.</p>

<p>"But we do wish. Only they are busy, getting in the wood."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he gave us another.</p>

<p>A minute later, as we were loading, a young monk of sparse beard
and tattered gown ran up and shook me by the hand.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Kyrie Vyron?"</p>

<p>"Is it possible? Andreas?"</p>

<p>Here was good fortune. Andreas, occupant of the dependency of
the Lavra named Kerasia, situated abut 2,500 feet above the sea,
for which we were bound, had guided us to the summit last year.
Would he do so again? Certainly. He had with him a friend, a monk
with Kaiserish moustachios, who hailed from the monastery of
Gregoriou and also recognised me. He too was living at Kerasia.
They had come down to the Ruling Monastery on business, and would
start back with us at once. With a last good-bye to Father
Procopius, we clattered out through the low fortified gateways.</p>

<p>Since there were only five mules, and two were needed for the
luggage, I walked on in front with Andreas, discussing trees,
snakes, and birds, as in turn they obstructed or fled from our
path. Myrtles, dwarf oaks, rock holly, and various shrubs to which
I could put no name, gradually gave place, as we moved higher, to
groves of ilexes, gnarled and shady, varied here and there with
oaks that might have been the envy of an English park. Andreas said
that he had been on the Mountain eight years, having been brought
here by his uncle. Did he like it? <i>"Etsi ketsi"</i>&mdash;so-so.
He would go away when he was tired. Formerly he had been attached
to the English consulate. The consul was a fine man. Did I know
him?</p>

<p>It happened that I did; and the fact awoke in me a reminiscence.
Finding, during a stay in Athens, that I needed a new passport, I
had applied to the consulate for one, which was inadvertently
issued without being stamped. The result was that, on returning to
Constantinople, whither I had removed a fortnight later, after a
visit to Broussa, I found myself in imminent danger of arrest for
being in possession of British credentials under false pretences.
Relief from the predicament seemed to lie with the British
consulate in Constantinople. But the state of this proved worse
than the last. Our boat to Constanza, with &pound;60 worth of
railway tickets across Europe depending on it, was timed to leave
at eleven o'clock. The staff arrived in driblets from half an hour
to an hour late, the man we needed last. Then he who had the keys
refused to surrender the passports to the man upstairs who had the
stamps. We, meanwhile, tempers beyond control, ran swearing from
basement to attic of the highest building in P&eacute;ra. At length
the man upstairs resorted to the telephone, which the man below
approached with a stream of oaths. The man above then wished, he
said, to know who was master in this office. If he was not, he'd
know why not. No more! Have the goodness to send those passports up
in double quick time...</p>

<p>Thus do Englishmen, white men all through, assume the
characteristics of the Orientals around them. Nor even now were our
troubles at an end. Arriving at the Customs, with a quarter of an
hour in which to board the boat and nine pieces of luggage, we
found three officials in glass cases, each approached by a queue of
twenty people, stamping passports with that febrile sloth which the
Turkish race shares with the hour-hands of watches. Desperate, we
exhibited handfuls of Turkish pounds, advertising in four languages
that whoever should succeed im placing our passports to an
official's nose should receive them. The result was magical; but
the effect upon the already exasperated crowd of Albanian
<i>hodjas</i>, Balkan mothers, and mackintoshed English misses, was
explosive. Rising as a man, they shattered the glass cases about
the heads of the officials, sending a hail of broken glass across
their necks and ears and the enormous documents over which their
hands were creeping. And what, in this ruthless cruel East, lain
low beneath the shadow of a drunken tyrant&mdash;what happened? Not
one of the officials even raised his eyes, far less diverted his
nib, from the paper on which he was engaged.</p>

<p>As the path rose to a rocky gate cut in the spine of a huge spur
that went curveting up to its own peak before dropping to the sea,
Andreas and I stopped. From here we could look along both sides of
the triangle in which the promontory ends; back east to where the
Lavra had now disappeared; and west along a series of giant
glissades of white stones waiting to precipitate themselves upon
the sea, where its blue edge encircled every cape and inlet with
the graduations of a peacock's tail. Round us blew a cooling wind
in great gusts. After ten minutes the others caught us up. And
another two hours' ride along what has been described as a mere
cornice brought us to Kerasia.</p>

<p>Two fat old monks, toothless greybeards, gowns and caps green
with age, rushed out on to the little balcony beaming greetings
upon me whom they remembered. And we sat as before, beneath the
same bottle-gourd hanging from the same shady creeper, eating a
delicious <i>glyco</i> of green oranges. This year, it being a
month later, the grapes were ripe; and a great bowl of them,
tasting, though no one will believe it, of wild strawberries, was
placed before us. The others were charmed at this hospitality. But
I, mindful of a former bill, ate with two minds. The outlying
communities are not bound to hospitality, as in the case of the
Ruling Monasteries. Hence our relations were now commercial.</p>

<p>Below us shone the green domes of an elaborate building, relic
of the Russian attempt to overpopulate the peninsula, now
containing only ten occupants; "and those," said the Greek monks
gleefully, "with no food." Further still, down a woody cleft bound
in with white crags, stretched sky and sea a blue sheet, horizon
the stitching of a join. How precipitous and how far the descent
was only borne upon us by the appearance of a passing steamer, no
larger than a boat of pins and matches in a child's bath.</p>

<p>The question was now of mules. Andreas had said they abounded.
But it appeared, once we had arrived, that those of the Holy
Apostles&mdash;the name of this particular cell, which was one of a
group&mdash;were out at work.</p>

<p>"Listen," I said. "We start in two hours' time. If there are
four mules, we will take them. If there are not, we will go on our
feet. But one we must have to carry our coats and food. Find
it."</p>

<p>Delivered of this injunction in the tones of a bull, we
proceeded to lunch&mdash;an excellent meal of tinned <i>hors
d'oeuvre</i> and bottled breasts of chicken. The red wine of
Kerasia is the best on the Mountain, very strong and made from the
strawberry-tasting grapes. The greater part is sold to the
monasteries, the Lavra alone buying 20,000 okes, the equivalent of
5,680 gallons, annually. The manufacture being actually in process,
the earthen floor of the kitchen was guttered with red wine, which
oozed from a vat ten feet high. Garlic was presented us, in the
form of tulip bulbs, non-odoriferous and, judging from the donor's
face, of Elysian delicacy. We therefore ate it, to our future
regret. After half an hour's sleep on carpeted divans in a room of
odious squalor, though adorned with yet another English
eighteenth-century clock, we rose to announce departure. Andreas,
it is unnecessary to say, had chosen the hour fixed to go in search
of the mule. But a display of artificial temper sent his friend
running down after him. Together they returned, successful.
Overcoats, saddle-bags, and the despatch-case were affixed, and,
accompanied by the two monks, we cavalcaded down the garden and out
into the woods.</p>

<p>It was one o'clock, and the sun was at its height. The path
wound steeply up what appeared from below a titanic white wall
stretching into the sky, with the tall trees along its upper edge
dwarfed by distance to the semblance of an imperceptible scrub. The
mule's legs being, after the nature of Athonite quadrupeds,
prehensile, it had the advantage of us, as we fastened upon roots
and boulders with every device of human composition. I had
previously ascended in the dark. It had been cool. And the
invisible obstacles seemed negligible after the priming draughts of
Kerasia wine. But now, at the very solstice of the day, its fumes
only served to retard us. Bodies, fat with spurious luxury and
clerkly inaction, poured frigid streams of perspiration from spine
and forehead, experiencing acute discomfort at the unwonted effort.
Gradually we separated, David and myself first, then Mark, lastly
Reinecker.</p>

<p>As we rose, the trees grew bigger and more buttressed against
the incessant storms; conifers appeared among them; and, as in a
German fairy-book, symptoms of charcoal-burners&mdash;great tripods
of branches and black heaps shaped like hives, ten feet at the
apex. Despite the sun, it became cooler. And as we emerged from the
trees that topped the precipice upon a further slope of rock and
scrub, the vegetation assumed an autumnal complexion: bracken
brown; hips and haws ripening on unfamiliar thorn-trees; and
everywhere patches of giant autumn crocuses, mauve and spotted.
Behind and below, vast peaks that had formerly towered above us
were shrunk to a mere pattern of two dimensions. The horizon was
half-way up the firmament; and, as we moved, rose with us.</p>

<p>We had climbed more than two hours, monks and mule following,
when we reached the <i>Panaghia</i>, church and hospice combined, a
squat grey building grown from the rock, with an imperceptible dome
humped out of its stone-tiled roof. The land beyond the doorway
seemed to slope down again, since no more could be seen. But it was
surprising, on stepping casually to the edge, to find the rim of
the sea five and a half thousand feet immediately beneath. The door
stood open. Running inside, I unearthed from a cupboard a long
cylindrical pot on the end of a rope, which, thrust down a well in
the floor, provided us with much-needed water, flavoured with
refuse and hairs though it was. After five minutes' rest, David and
I, accompanied by Andreas' friend, started on the last thousand
feet.</p>

<p>"The highe pique or Peer thereof," wrote Sir Paul Rycaut of the
Mountain in 1679, "is...as uneven, craggy, and horrid as Caucasus;
but somewhat beneath it is covered with trees, shrubs, and
boscage..." The latter, with the exception of a last zone of gaunt
jagged pines, we now forsook. Then even these were below us. Only
the naked ivory shoulders of Athos gleamed sheer and white against
the bold blue sky, tipped like a glittering minuscule of sugar with
the little beehive church of the Transfiguration. Above us eagles,
their under-wings spotted in the manner of aeroplanes, circled and
hung, uttering soulless cries in the cold azure. A game-bird
whirred from our feet. The crocuses, larger and brighter, starred
the ground in purple groups sprung from between the myriad teeth of
the marble.</p>

<p>The monk, in silent boast, sped like a mountain goat caparisoned
in cr&ecirc;pe, up the twisting vestiges of path. David and I,
debilitated by the rarity of air&mdash;"<i>les aviateurs prennent
leur pr&eacute;cautions &agrave; deux mille m&egrave;tres"</i> had
been the Governor's remark&mdash;plodded unhappily behind, panting
as we had not panted since we shared the same game of football. I
suggested a rest. But David, eyeing the monk two corkscrews above,
said: "I have a certain pride in these things." So we struggled
break-neck up the sun-kissed marble, vaguely shadowed with leafless
prickly vegetation in its crevices; and still the church receded
beyond the range of hope and vision. A peculiar trembling overtook
the legs. We felt we should now be reduced to locomotion on the
stumps of our knees. "Shall we stop a minute?" said David. And,
with a call to the monk, we subsided.</p>

<p>Thus proceeding at intervals of a quarter of an hour; with the
slopes beneath become vertiginous in their enormity, falling, as it
seemed, unbroken by a single foothold to the peacock blue rim; with
spates of perspiration suddenly escaping from our hats to deluge
neck and ears; with the sun, sinking behind the pendent brow,
leaving ambushed blasts of frozen air in the shadows; with the
<i>Panaghia</i> scarcely visible, a mere grey excrescence on its
ledge&mdash;we reached a point where church and summit were no
longer within sight. Ten more minutes, said the monk. Five. And
then, defiling up between great rocks, their further faces dripping
liquid gold, there rose before us a straight white wall and tiny
dome.</p>

<p>Beyond, a void.</p>

<p>In 1926 we had ascended, as we thought, to see the dawn.
Andreas, incensed at being woken by forcible shaking from his icy
board in the <i>Panaghia</i>, had run his fastest. It was dark;
and, imagining each twist to be flanked by a precipice of unholy
depth, we had rushed with him, sick with the effort, until the
motionless silhouette of goats, grouped Mappin-terrace-like against
the exiguous light that now filtered through the black, proclaimed
the top. The cold was ghastly. Andreas, rending some portion of the
church furniture indistinguishable in the half-light, lit a fire in
an angle of the building, at which we crouched disconsolate. This
was in contrast to the procedure of Athelstan Riley in the
Anglo-Catholic 'eighties, who, finding himself "in a cloud, and it
being very chilly...lighted the lamps of the <i>eiconostasis</i>
and sang the Magnificat"! Despite his example, we remained outside,
an hour and yet another hour, as slowly, imperceptibly, the day
lightened. To quote from the recorded impression of the time: "The
clouds seemed in a turmoil, tearing and swirling on, disclosing and
shutting the tantalising vision of a sun beyond. In a final agony
the great black bank was rent. And for one half-minute there lay
beneath us the whole sea, and the other two of the three fingers of
land; the wooded Athos twisting like a furry serpent back to the
mainland; the bay of Salonica and the Macedonian hills; Greece;
Europe; and all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them.
The sun shone, and the golden morning seemed to penetrate the brain
and suffuse the whole body. Half a minute&mdash;then with a rush of
cold wind the curtain fell. And, picking up our sticks, we started
downward through the dead grey mists, to breakfast at the
<i>Panaghia</i>, 1,000 feet below."</p>

<p>What wonder, then, that I must see the view again, remaining, if
necessary for ever, till the clouds disperse? The others, sceptical
of the effort entailed, had croaked prognostications of the
weather. But God was with us; and the rainy canopies which had
overshadowed the whole southern end of the peninsula for the last
forty-eight hours had dissolved even as we climbed. David and I,
turning the corner of the church, gasped as we looked down the
Mountain's back.</p>

<p>Reared a mile and a quarter off the globe, we might, had we
wished, have put out a hand to pluck the sky, have palmed away a
cup of blue. For that broad illimitable space was now reality,
possessing an interesting and unsuspected texture. Its scope had
shrunk. All around the horizon of land and sea had risen to
three-quarters up the range of vision, and in so doing, assumed new
character, as when a face, seen only in profile, is turned to the
front. To the east, whence we had climbed, tiny contours uttered
Lemnos and the Asia Minor coast: the plains of Troy, whence Tozer
saw this platform of ours "towering up from the horizon, like a
vast spirit of the waters, when the rest of the peninsula is
concealed below." In the north, all the coastline of Thrace,
Cavalla, and Dedeagatch wound away to the junction of the
Dardanelles, with Turkey's remnant hovering in soft uncertainty. In
the west, battling for definition athwart the cadent sun, the other
two fingers of Chalcidice, Longos and Cassandra lay one above the
other in the sea; and over them Olympus and the line of Greece.
While, farther south, another transient shape proclaimed Euboea and
the satellite Sciathos, which means, in Greek, "Shadow of Athos."
Thither, in the morning, the shadow stretches. Had it been the dawn
we witnessed, instead of hazy sunset, we should also have seen, as
all the Orthodox world knows, Constantinople, the great capital. We
looked; but the flat dome of St. Sophia rose only in the mind.
Christ saw the town, no doubt, the old Byzantium. For the Orthodox
world knows, too, that it was here the devil led him.</p>

<p>Below the church, distance galloped down the gilded crags to
peaks beneath, where tattered breaths of cloud hung forgotten to
their spurs. Until, infinitely far, the tree-clad spine of the
peninsula began, twisting its serpentine course up the vertical
panorama; land meeting water with cape and cleft, a warm glow to
each face; the monasteries clinging pale and diminutive to their
sides. As the forty miles stretch out, only a shadow in the haze
remains, outlined in the silver gleams of the farther sea;
spreading then to a farther shadow&mdash;the mainland.</p>

<p>Wedged in a niche of rock, I sat agaze, an arctic wind
shrivelling the clothes, numbing the hands, and rushing up the
legs. The others had arrived, even now scarcely reconciled to their
exertions: Mark busied with some Alpine weed, Reinecker remarking
upon the merits of the romantic landscape. Gradually the cold,
hitherto spasmodic, became universal and intense. A darkness was
present in the sky. David and Reinecker first, then Mark, monks,
and mules, turned and went. I could not.</p>

<p>But it was necessary. With a glimpse at the church, built in
this version by the Patriarch Joachim III the Magnificent to the
glory of God, and at our names, which we had pencilled last year in
an indiscoverable corner as monument to our first pilgrimage so
long as we should still have strength to return&mdash;and which,
despite the experience of Sir John Maundeville's philosophers, had
survived&mdash;I too turned my face east. I turned to go. But
stood, rooted. For there, out upon the water, moving with an
impetus almost visible up toward the cold lowering horizon, lay a
grey elongated cone. The shadow: which "rechez unto Lempny, the
whilk is therfra nere lxxvii myle." Slowly it was dissolved in the
approaching night. A film crept over the peacock rim. Rigid with
cold, I threw myself in the wake of the others, reaching the tree
zone as the darkness really fell; and stopping with them to drag
down the rest of the slope limbs of battered pine in preparation
for the night.</p>

<p>We discovered, on reaching the <i>Panaghia</i>, that Georgi, the
goat-herd, had not returned. On arriving last year at midnight, a
giant figure, axe aloft, had hurled itself upon us from the door,
accompanied by the hot snarls of dogs. But on enquiry if he was a
brigand, he had subsided. We had met him to-day on the way to
Kerasia: a Viking of a man, with auburn moustaches and streaks of
gold in a brown beard. He had a new coat. Formerly his clothing had
consisted of a woollen garment so ragged that, but for the adhesive
qualities of his largely visible body, it must have dropped in a
thousand shreds upon the floor.</p>

<p>"What is that?" he said in greeting, noticing the top of Father
Procopius' bottle sticking from my pocket.</p>

<p><i>"Ouzo."</i>
</p>

<p>"Indeed."</p>

<p>And, without further word, he pulled it out, smelt it, took a
swig, and put it back. He might or might not be back, he said, a
little worried lest our wants should remain unsatisfied without
him. This, however, was not the case.</p>

<p>Hauling in the pine-branches, some of them so large as to need
our assistance, Andreas and his friend lit a fire beneath an arched
stone chimney at the end of the upper room&mdash;upper by reason of
its position on the hill. It was an enormous fire, casting a
readable light throughout, and so hot as to be unapproachable.
Despite the chimney, the room was filled with clouds of smoke,
which gathered in a pendent layer eighteen inches thick under the
ceiling. A store of branches was got into the room beneath; water
drawn from its well; and the wooden windows tightly closed with
chunks of rock against the cold. We settled down to dinner.</p>

<p>It was a curious scene, this long, low room: the roaring bonfire
leading the shadows in perpetual dance; dying now to a red glow;
leaping up to light the edges of faces, arms, and shoulders; the
ceiling hidden by a cloud, mobile with compression of arriving
smoke; the floor occupied by two enormous platforms, two feet high
and twelve across, with between them from door to hearth an aisle
of the same width; all of thick, rough-hewn planks, dark and worn,
those of the platforms mounted on peeled logs shiny with age. And
ourselves, spread apostle-like over these strange furnishings amid
overcoats and saddle-bags: David, broad and complacent, efficiently
opening a tin of Wiltshire ham; Mark nibbling frivolously at a
truffle; Reinecker delving in the biscuits; myself apportioning
chocolate for the "pudding." And in a separate corner the monks,
hair loosed on their shoulders: Andreas balancing cloak-wise a
khaki coat with collar and cuffs of frayed cinnamon velvet; his
friend huddled in a rug, red within, outwardly printed with the
spots of the leopard. All through a thickening haze. The smoke pall
falling lower. And the cold from without penetrating those parts of
the body farthest from the fire.</p>

<p>Pulling on an extra pair of trousers and a jumper, I looked
outside. The moon, in medium phase, cleft a trench of light down
the sea to the very base of the Mountain, thus clearly defined in
its titanic remoteness. Above rose the summit, colour of the
embedding stars, with the gaunt black trees straggling
ineffectually over its beginnings. And from the demure cabin of
man, distinguished only by the one horizontal line of roof in a
world of verticality, a sudden stream of sparks, fiery red among
the cold lights as though from a railway engine on a frosty night,
blew from the chimney, and, passing over the precipice, lost
itself.</p>

<p>The night passed, if not in peace, in warmth; for, whenever the
fire died down, a monk arose, returned with half a tree, and heaped
it on to the embers. Sleep was evanescent. For myself, a pillow was
forthcoming in the despatch-case; and with grisly irony a
pillow-case, provided by the afterthought of fond parent, had
inadvertently accompanied it. Head ensconced on this travesty, it
remained to settle the body. To lie on a bare board in an overcoat
that can be doubled at the supporting hip is not in itself an
insupportable hardship. But when, at every point where flesh,
armoured no matter how, touches the wood, a ravening multitude of
fleas rises to the attack, slumber is necessarily spasmodic.</p>

<p>With the first glimmers of morning we rose, to find the sun
beneath us down the precipice, fighting its way above black billows
of cloud that came curling at our feet. Our faces, ghastly in the
dawn, were rendered more horrible by a grey coating of wood smoke.
The monks were impatient to start. Having eaten some biscuits, we
thrust things into their bags with the unseeing inertia that
follows a broken night, folded the pillow-case, and set off down.
On the way I suddenly remembered that my mother, incensed, after
hearing my accounts, that in a genderless age she should still be
prohibited from this last stronghold of decency, had implored me to
bring her some plant, "something living of the Mountain." It seemed
that the crocuses, envied of botanists and growing at an altitude
whose rigours must be comparable even to those of the English
winter, were crying for the purpose. Grasping pseudo-trowels of
living marble, we gouged a dozen sepulchred bulbs into a
biscuit-tin. Planted in a special bed, their leaves at least have
risen to the spring. But whether they will flower awaits the
autumn.</p>

<p>On reaching Kerasia, there emerged from a row of French beans
Father Basil, a crafty, auburn-bearded monk the genuineness of
whose greeting reconciled me to the memory of how formerly he had
sought to turn us from the door till assured of our financial
worth. The morning was spent in writing letters; since David, being
on the point of arranging his marriage, had resolved to send
Andreas' friend, at the cost of 7s. 6d., on a mission to the Caryes
post-office. These finished, we lunched. Last year, appalled by the
unkemptness of the kitchen, we had taken spade, dug onions and
potatoes straight from the ground, and fried them ourselves. Behold
now the same in the hands of Basil. "An English dish, gentlemen,"
There was also an English knife, which a fair-haired monklet of
fourteen informed us had been with them thirty years.</p>

<p>At three o'clock, five mules, over the price of which a small
monk in a white sweater had worsted us, were loaded with the
luggage and ourselves. The bill was paid, Basil uttering not a
whisper of dissent as the fictitious items were removed. And we
embarked on a ride of such hair-stiffening precipitousness as still
to take away the breath at the memory of it, of the thumbscrews of
agitation induced by the sight of camera and plates slithering
across vertical torrent beds, each clutching hoof sending cascades
of shale falling half a mile to the sea beneath. We were too tired
to walk, and suffered ourselves to be hiccupped over these tortuous
ledges, new and marvellous views revealing themselves at each turn,
the wooden saddles digging spine or stomach according to the up or
down, and the three monks, Basil, Andreas' friend, and the little
Crab-apple in the white sweater, shouting directions to each other
with weird inversions of normal intonation.</p>

<p>At one point, negotiating a lesser version of the Khyber Pass,
David and I dismounted to compose an art-view of David, poised
pilgrim-like upon a walking-stick, gazing out to sea. This
elaborate and beautiful process occupied a certain time, during
which the mules, spurred by the malice of their masters, redoubled
their pace. Wishing to come up with them, costing, as they were,
4s. 9d. apiece, we hurried and we shouted, to no purpose; till at
last we bawled with open mouths, bringing pieces of the Mountain
crashing about our heads, trees from their roots, clouds from their
moorings. Like Egyptian acrobats on the pyramids, we hurtled from
boulder to boulder, retrieving in our course a mackintosh and
overcoat fallen from the mules' backs. They had stopped. Did we
pay, I cannonaded, for mules in order to walk? Was he a thief? Had
he no eyes with which to attend the coats? In answer to which Basil
smiled gently through his auburn beard. Whereat, like the doomed
Moriarty high up on a mountain-ledge, I forced him backward to the
very lip of eternity, fingers twitching for his beard, simulating
the lust that overtakes a Turkish soldier at the plucking of a
hirsute prelate. Certainly, he said, he would take care of our
possessions during the remainder of the ride. He had not really
understood before. Mark, meanwhile, unfamiliar with the modes of
the Levant, sought agitatedly to pinion my arms against an earnest
homicide.</p>

<p>We topped the <i>skiti</i> of St. Anne, where formerly we had
slept the night in the roof of the church. It is here that the left
foot of the grandmother of God is preserved, "a most miraculous and
odoriferous relic." And, after a two hours' ride, we came in view
of St. Paul's. No sight on the Mountain can compare with the first
vision of this monastery from the path to Kerasia. Even Reinecker
let escape a tribute to its bewildering beauty. Tucked in an angle
of stupendous cliffs, the massive foundations rise imperceptibly
convergent to square blocks of cells, backed by a curving, serrated
wall which fits to the rock behind. While from it a square and
slender tower, colour of pink putty, like all the other stone,
aspires to help the landscape in its composition. For this is but
the pivot of the scene. Below runs a river-bed, strewn with
Leviathans of the ice-age, dry now, but tearing cataclysmic to a
group of boat-houses and the sea, twenty minutes away. And above,
whence the river comes, rears the whole peak of Athos, snowy,
luminous grey against the blue, falling in darkening, gashed
escarpment to the building and the cypresses about it. The monks
put on their gowns, changed their soft caps to hard, and tightened
their belts. I gave them cigarettes, and thus made peace. Crossing
the river-bed, we approached the monastery.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch7"></a>Chapter VII. TO METHODIUS</h2>

<p>Seated on a bench above the path sat a fat monk with a white
beard, shaded by a mulberry-tree. As we approached, he descended in
welcome.</p>

<p>"Whence are you?" he asked. "French, Germans, or Americans?"</p>

<p>"We are English."</p>

<p>He then espied the luggage. "So that is how they travel in
England," he remarked. And conducted us forthwith to a high
guest-room smelling of a disused nursery. Here we awaited, with
more than usual expectation, the reviving tray. Over the door hung
a fine early eighteenth century <i>eicon</i> of the
<i>Panaghia,</i> her dress of rose-colour shaded in chocolate, and
enclosed in a light wood Gothic frame crossed at the corners,
redolent of the nursery Landseer. A series of windows opposite the
door, draped as though pertaining to a romantic bedchamber of the
Second Empire, permitted the full glare of the falling sun.
Outside, a balcony poised us above the slim green cones of
cypress-trees, themselves balanced only on a ledge of rock and
fostered by the monastic sewage that poured at intervals down a
wooden shoot. Doves were fluttering from branch to wall. Rapt in
contemplation of the arsenal tower on the shore, it was only
David's elephantine tread which brought to our notice the fact that
the balcony was threatening to part company with the wall.</p>

<p>Within the room, a series of prints so typical as to merit
description, told the great incidents of Greek history. There was
the series of ironclads such as the <i>Averof,</i> named after
their millionaire donors; a mythological matron, in a classical
helmet, uttering a tear at a rustic cross bound in blue and white
ribbons and inscribed TO THE FALLEN&mdash;1912, a souvenir of the
First Balkan War; Kolokotronis, also in a classical helmet
(specially manufactured in England and brought out by Byron),
leading his Klephts on horseback in the War of Independence;
Kanaris, the admiral, gorgeously moustached; Germanos, Archbishop
of Patras, raising the standard of revolt in 1821, at the
hill-bound monastery near Calavryta; the scene outside the Royal
Palace at the deposition of 1861, linen-kilted warriors prancing in
exaltation, with the departing Otho and Amalia vignetted in one
corner, the arriving George and Olga in another; and the great
Patriarch of Constantinople, Joachim III, entitled, although a king
had reigned in Athens eighty years, <i>"Le Grand Chef de la
Nation."</i></p>

<p>The guest-master, Father Methodius, a young man of weak
disjointed body and smiling face, brought us at length refreshment.
The <i>ouzo,</i> distilled, he said, from figs, was such that only
a hurried draught of water prevented its permanently scalding the
roots of the tongue. There is a sinister reticence in the
appearance of Greek drinks. It happened one June afternoon that I
was led to pay my respects to His Beatitude Meletios, ex-Patriarch
of Constantinople, Patriarch-elect of Alexandria. A natural
timidity was not dispelled by his appearance: enormous corkscrew
moustachios of silver descending over a beard that reached his
pectoral cross; voice deeper than human; and the stature of a
giant, which alone had saved him in 1923 from the hands of the
Turkish mob, when he clung to each successive baluster from the top
to the bottom of the Patriarchate, while the dragoman telephoned
for the allied police. The usual tray was handed. Seated shyly on
the edge of a chair, I perceived a thimbleful of orange sediment
which seemed to denote one of those innocuous and sticky fluids
dispensed in temperance canteens. Unheeding, I swallowed. And, to
the Patriarch's surprise, in place of the abstruse political
problems which he was expecting to discuss, I rose from the chair
and rushed weeping about the room till the agonies of what I had
thought to be my last drink on earth subsided.</p>

<p>Our rooms were clean and airy, being furnished with blinds,
proper beds, elaborate gilt mirrors, cupboards, and even
clothes-brushes and combs. This was the Ritz itself after our
latter experiences. Mark, besotted with the sudden luxury,
displayed a housewife's pettiness over the possession of large and
small drawers, access to the mirror, proprietorship of the
window-ledge, and proximity of the spittoon&mdash;a brazier-like
vessel containing white powder and a kind of basting-spoon to inter
contributions. These are to be found in all decently appointed
guest-rooms and churches, adding, in the latter case, much to the
poetry of the Orthodox service.</p>

<p>We then decided to bathe.</p>

<p>"You have only one hour," said the gatekeeper, a severe old man.
"The gate shuts punctually at twelve"&mdash;this meaning seven. "It
takes twenty minutes to the sea." Hurrying down the hill, we
plunged into the water&mdash;a sheet of apricot with a boat and two
monks, tall-hatted and upright at the oars, silhouetted against the
sunset. I swam to a cave I knew and sat in it upon the cool green
stones beneath the water, as though in a beryl. Having dressed, we
realised that the hour was gone, and set off back at a run. But our
progress was impeded, as we approached the monastery, by the sudden
conversion of the path into a river by the unlocking of some upper
sluice, in order to wash away the numerous droppings of the mules
with which the day's work had coated it. Taking to the vineyard
walls in the manner of suburban cats, we were in time to find a
wicket still open, framing the black figure of the porter, watch in
hand. But our exhausted appearance extracted a smile of indulgence.
Rising to our rooms leading off a long, stone-flagged corridor, we
found Methodius scouring the crannies to announce our dinner.</p>

<p>It may be, even at this early stage of our sojourn, that that
hypothetical entity, the reader, is already stirred to nausea by
incessant reference to the palate. It may be but all the more shall
he forgive, as buoyed on the content of a normal meal, the port
burning on his gums, he turns these lugubrious pages of rancid fish
and heathen vegetables. He shall more than forgive; every fibre of
his emotions shall respond to ours. And when, with no trace of
hesitancy, we award the crown of gastronomy and the very mantle of
Mrs. Becton to Father Methodius, a thrill shall course the marrow
of his bones. As Clarendon to Falkland, the author to Methodius of
St. Paul's erects this obelisk of prosody.</p>

<p>Dinner began with tomato soup containing clouds of macaroni
stars; continued with potatoes fried in paprika sauce; onions
fried; potatoes baked; and ended with cheese, grapes, peaches, and
coffee. Next morning we were wakened early to be shown the relics
while the priest was still at hand after the morning service. The
first of these was a piece of the Cross, encased in magnificent
gold filigree studded with coral and dating from the year of Queen
Victoria's accession. This was followed by a piece of the gold
offered by the magi; together with a substantial portion of the
myrrh, which is reported by the Jesuit Braconnier, in the opening
decade of the eighteenth century, to have been presented to the
monastery by the Princess Maco, daughter of the Serbian despot
Ghika and wife of the Sultan Mahommet the Conqueror. Last came an
<i>eicon</i> of the Virgin, almost indistinguishable with age,
which had refused to ignite when Theophilus, the iconoclast Emperor
of the ninth century, made holocaust of its fellows. And in the
fullness of time it had arrived at that sanctuary of maltreated
pictures, the Holy Mountain. Though whether of its own volition,
riding on the waves, as they usually did, or by the hand of man, we
did not discover.</p>

<p>Each monastery exhales its own atmosphere. Even in the forties,
St. Paul's was noticed for its cleanliness. After the haphazard
squalor of the Lavra, its ordered passages, their shadow lifted
only by an occasional stripe from an open door or uncurtained
skylight, were a tribute to the cenobitic rule. The main buildings,
despite the singular beauty of their grouping in the dark angle of
the Mountain, date from no earlier than 1902, the older having in
that year been destroyed by fire. Tall and plain, they are
supported within, up to the first floor, on blue iron pillars to
form a kind of cloister. The church, ornamented inside with grey
mottled Athonite marble, was built in 1844 at the expense of
Sophronius Calligas, a wealthy Constantinopolitan. It is large and,
in view of the date, fortunately unfrescoed. Without, it carries
unbroken the Byzantine tradition of fluted cupolas and leaded
domes. Some of the buildings were still in process of
reconstruction. And this activity, noticeable elsewhere, was in
outstanding contrast to last year. Then all had been complaint;
there was neither money nor labour; no one knew what the government
might do next. Now the position was regulated, and would continue,
after all, as before.</p>

<p>It remained to enquire about the photographing. Behind the
monastery rises the old hinder wall of ochreous pink stone, with
each of its narrow crenellations surmounted by a queer tile of
sliced stone resembling a pecking bird. And on it sits the tiny
barrel-vaulted chapel of St. George, scarcely twelve feet high and
twenty long, where hang in ruinous disorder, the finest frescoes on
the Mountain. Thus placed, right beneath the summit, with every
winter storm crashing down upon its roof, it will admit, say the
monks, of no further repair. Yet the paintings on the inner side of
the roof are already gone, rotted by the damp. The others remain
insecurely fixed, with great cracks rending the plaster, ready, it
seems, to fall with the next thunderclap. Will nothing ever be done
to save them?</p>

<p>Let him who still conceives of Byzantine painting as a hieratic
degradation, imagine a Giotto unsweetened, as Giotto already was,
by Italianate naturalism, painting in the luminous colours of El
Greco&mdash;those cold blues and clarets, olive-shadowed yellows,
and pure, clear greens of under the sea; lit with angry brilliance;
geometric in form; yet in austerity sympathetic, in power gentle.
It is these, the very flower of the Byzantine Renaissance&mdash;not
only the link between European art and the East, final explication
of El Greco, but in themselves divorced from history, masterpieces
for the world&mdash;that are threatened. Americans are expending
&pound;1,000,000 to convert the most picturesque quarter of old
Athens into a pillared playground for cats, that they may unearth
yet another shoal of those inert stone bodies which already debar
persons of artistic sensibility from entering half the museums in
Europe. And here, for the want of a few hundreds, paintings which
historically throw an entirely novel light on the origins of
European painting since the Renaissance, and aesthetically exhibit
an astonishing and moving affinity with the goals of modern art,
must perish.</p>

<p>Methodius assured us that the photographing presented no
difficulties. The chapel was always open. He would conduct us to it
himself. This he did, by a series of buildings and staircases, each
floor of which was distinguishable in our subsequent journeys
unguided, by the absence or proximity of its sanitary arrangements.
Indeed, during the remainder of our stay we came to rely more and
more upon the nose as an instrument of exploration.</p>

<p>David settled, I approached the tower, erected, according to a
Slav inscription over the door, in 1522, and enjoying on Athos the
prestige of Magdalen's in Oxford. By the lintel of the entrance
hung a hornet's nest, the occupants of which seemed peaceful,
though they emerged in such numbers as to drive me hurriedly
inside. A series of steep, straight flights of steps, enclosed at
one side between the outer and an inner wall, led from floor to
floor. These had formerly been tenanted; but the rooms were now in
an alarming state of disrepair, their floors creaking and trembling
like a mystery-house at a circus. The roof proved a steep
four-sided cone, on which I picked my way as remote as possible
from the gaping gutter-holes in the battlements. It had been my
intention, wedged in a crenellation, to attempt a downward
photograph. But the looseness of a coping-stone upset my nerve. I
descended, to find lunch, at 10.30, on the table.</p>

<p>As we slept during the afternoon, Andreas' friend arrived from
Caryes bearing letters and a wholly unintelligible telegram for
David, unsigned, with no clue as to its place of origin. Among
others, a screed of panting indignation was addressed me from a
friend whose projected stay in a Lundy Island lighthouse had been
made impossible by his parents' learning, from the gossip-column of
the Secretary of State for India's daughter, that while the party
was in residence the licensing laws would not be enforced.</p>

<p>As we read, the monk waited for his money, seating his uncleanly
draperies on Mark's pillow. We had agreed that he should receive
160 drachmas, half of which had already been paid to Basil as a
guarantee. We now gave him 110, thus including 30 extra as a
tip.</p>

<p>"But," he answered, "remember what you said."</p>

<p>This supposed dictum was the outcome of an incident of the day
before. On the way down from the summit, the mule, which he was
leading, had stopped to drink at a trough which owed its
construction, according to an inscription, to the activity of such
and such a monk by means of a [<i>Greek characters</i>].</p>

<p>"What does [<i>Greek characters</i>] mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A [<i>Greek characters</i>]," he replied, "is when someone goes
from one person to another demanding and receiving money for a
purpose. It is what you are going to do among your friends for me,
is it not, so that I can buy some new clothes? As you see, these
are all torn. I have been here four years now, without new ones. In
the war I fought in Asia Minor, and escaped to the coast by Broussa
in 1922."</p>

<p>To which pronouncement my sole words had been: "When so many
were killed, you were very fortunate."</p>

<p>I now turned on him, pointed out that he had already received
more than he bargained for, and threatened, if he did not cease, to
take it away again. Accepting the offer of some cigarettes, he
retired.</p>

<p>There arrived in the evening two more guests: a Greek occupying
some professional status in Salonica, of which we could not fathom
the meaning; and a tall Czech, adorned with a raw shaven head,
whose beard and moustache were trimmed with nice precision to a
seventh of an inch all over.</p>

<p><i>"Ach!"</i> he shouted excitedly, meeting Reinecker, who looks
foreign, in the passage. <i>"Sind Sie ein Deutscher?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Nein,"</i> was the reply. <i>"Ich bin
Engl&auml;nder."</i></p>

<p><i>"Ach so? Von London?"</i>
</p>

<p><i>"Ja."</i>
</p>

<p><i>"Sind Sie auf lange hier?"</i>
</p>

<p><i>"Zwei Wochen&mdash;die anderen sechs oder Sieben."</i>
</p>

<p><i>"Also, haben Sie Bekannte hier? Was treiben Sie? Studieren
Sie?..."</i>
</p>

<p>And so on. Five minutes later, David, Mark, and I, unaware of
his advent, met him at the dinner-table. Reinecker mumbled a
formula of introduction, whereupon, observing his mode of
hairdressing, we opened conversation with such German as we could
summon.</p>

<p><i>"Ah, monsieur, pardon!"</i> he replied, with stumbling
deliberation. <i>"Je ne parle pas l'allemand. Je suis
Czecho-Slovaque."</i></p>

<p>This sudden decision relieved us of the embarrassment of his
conversation. For his French was of an incompetence which prevented
his uttering unless addressed. Later, meeting him at the sink, I
twitted him on not speaking German from patriotic motives, to which
he replied that he had never learned it, colouring to the lie. I
was tempted to ask if his Czech was as bad as his French, but
refrained.</p>

<p>Next day, finding him in the passage as Methodius was calling us
to lunch, I accidentally translated the summons, since he spoke no
Greek, into German. Upon which he bowed stiffly.</p>

<p>During dinner that night we were entertained by Methodius, who
told us the story of basil, the sweet herb; how the Empress Helena
discovered this little plant sprung from the blood of Christ on the
site of the Cross, and brought it back with her to Constantinople,
since when it has flourished on window-sill and balcony through all
the Greek lands.</p>

<p>Our fellow-guest from Salonica exhibited a facetious good
humour, comparing me to Mangas, a kind of mythical Hellenic naughty
boy whose peculiar attributes of comicality I could not recall. As
the meal continued, his voice grew louder, his disquisitions more
dogmatic. He was a typical Greek of the middle class, enthralled by
politics, religious believer in the Hellenic destiny. Anglophil,
anxious to be of assistance, boundlessly conceited, yet, save when
enlarging on a favourite subject, unobtrusive. During a
conversation, I mistook the meaning of a word for another outside
the context in which he had used it. This led him to a new
field.</p>

<p>"Every word in Greek," he said, "has ten meanings, and every
meaning ten words. You need to know each one. Greek is the most
beautiful of all languages. The Bible and all the holy works were
written in it."</p>

<p>"The Gospels, for instance," I interpolated, wishing to seem
intelligent.</p>

<p>"Yes, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John the Theologian all used it.
Yet they were not Greeks. But the Holy Ghost descended with the
gift of tongues&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! Of course, the <i>Holy Ghost</i> was Greek."</p>

<p>Whereat Father Methodius, handing a dish of stuffed tomatoes,
exploded into giggles; and the guest, his peroration marred,
groaned, protesting and reiterative, that this was not the case. I
recount the anecdote with pride, as it is not easy to hoist a Greek
neatly on his own petard.</p>

<p>Another curious figure at this monastery was Father Zenobios,
tiny and wizened, of great age, and speaking English in a pathetic,
shrill voice. The other monks used to push him about, regarding him
as not wholly in possession of his faculties, and, though lovable,
tiresome. Born over three-quarters of a century ago in Cephalonia,
when the Union Jack was still floating over the Ionian Islands, he
had remained a British subject. His career in the world had started
as a stoker on a ship of the Union Castle Line. After fourteen
years of this, he became a stevedore, working at Gravesend and
Greenhithe. He knew London, had driven something in the nature of
an engine at Newcastle, and visited India, Australia, and South
Africa, his journeys in the latter including both Kimberley and
Bulawayo. For the last twenty-five years he had enjoyed the peace
of Athos.</p>

<p>"I love England," he told us. "I pray for her night and
morning."</p>

<p>It eventually transpired that the photographing on which David
was engaged was strictly forbidden, owing to the distaste
experienced by the abbot on a former occasion, when some of the
<i>eicons</i> in the church had been reproduced in a newspaper. As,
however, he was away, there was nothing to prevent our continuing
the work. He was returning on the morrow in company with the
governor. And it became plain to us that Methodius was anxious to
know the date of our departure, as we were occupying the best rooms
and he wished to have them ready cleaned for the reception of a
more distinguished guest. His attitude of apology for this seeming
inhospitality was so genuine that he could hardly frame the words
of enquiry. Could we not return after three or four days? In his
agitation he served lunch at half-past nine.</p>

<p>But we had already decided to leave that evening. And, writing a
note which he should deliver to the Governor, we pressed Methodius'
hand with profound gratitude for this respite of comfort. We had
been actually very tired on arrival. Now, restored, we could face
further obstacles bravely. The luggage was being loaded in the
courtyard under the superintendence of the steward. With a last
promise to return, if not now, next year, we clattered out of the
gateway and down the road to the sea.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch8"></a>Chapter VIII. DISCIPLINE</h2>

<p>It is noticeable, as the visitor's boat is impelled up and down
the waves by some jocund octogenarian whose peaked shade against
the glare of the sun on the water resembles the helmet of a Spanish
trooper, that the promontory of Athos is composed of marble. Both
cliffs above, and rocks below the surface, fluted and pillared in
fantastic diagonals, are inlaid with white veins, whose petty
twists interrupt the grandiose conformations of the waves' battery.
The marble is both green and grey. And from the stone jetty of St.
Paul's arsenal, where the end had fallen into the mouth of the tiny
harbour as though to ambuscade the lobsters, there could be seen,
as we swam about, a dull green cape jutting from the "boscage" of
the slope above, not a quarter of an hour away. Beyond it the
coast-line continued unbroken. Conceive, therefore, our
astonishment when there materialised, on rounding this corner, a
large bay. And in its farthest recess, shouldered on a shrub-grown,
overhanging cliff a hundred feet above the sea, the high wall and
fantastic jutting balconies of Dionysiou.</p>

<p>As an adjunct to the English home a wholesome discredit attaches
to the balcony. The architectural phantasmagorias of outer
London&mdash;Belmont, Bellevue, and Bellavista&mdash;rise in the
imagination, protruding their banistered platforms to the tune of
dormered roof and Rhenish tower; or, in the earlier phase, when
architecture was "free" like last year's poetry, and Ruskin held
the torch of taste, arcaded in Venetian Gothic, Torquay marble
pillarette and passion-flower capital sustaining cloister to the
bathroom window. Nor may utility be permitted to compensate
aesthetic doubt. In both inner and outer London, from the hooped
embrasures of Mayfair and the stuccoed balustrades of Kensington to
the last row of latter-day Morden, it is <i>vulgar</i> to sit upon
a balcony. The City holds the same canon. What blithe advocate has
yet dared sniff the morning sun from the turrets of the Law Courts;
what hapless clerk from the Assyrian crow's-nests of Adelaide
House? Nor are provincial towns less squeamish. And in the country
the balcony is superfluous, Either the sun shines, when we rush
into the garden to see it. Or else it does not, when we stay
indoors. The balcony, in fact, remains the instrument only of
suicides. Each one is a lasting memorial to the postman who met his
death in Northumberland Avenue through impact with a lady in search
of her Maker.</p>

<p>But in southern climates it is different. And on the Holy
Mountain, more particularly in such monasteries as Dionysiou, that
are cramped for space, there is no domestic function that the
balcony does not fill. It has swollen to the dimensions of rooms
and wings, windowed and roofed, but no less balconied for that,
strutted out on slender wooden brackets. It is often the habitual
means of communication between one quarter of the monastery and the
other. It supports the household offices, that their refuse may
descend unhindered to the rocks or sea below. And for the
individual monk it is, above all, his home and his castle. Here,
when his position in the monastery admits his possession of one,
grow his pots of basil and his flowers. Here he sits on summer
evenings, with only the sea between him and eternity&mdash;a
schooner sailing gently by, a steamer on the horizon heading for
the sunset and the world. Here he thinks of the past, of the
continents he visited and the wars he fought, of Greece and the
Greek world, Constantinople and the forsaken coast of Asia Minor.
Here he holds converse with his cronies over the affairs of the
monastery, the elections of the abbot, the elders, or the
<i>epitropoi.</i> Here, if the community be idiorhythmic, he eats
and drinks. The sun, tottering on the rim of the sea, falls. A
green pallor overspreads the sky, encroaches on the orange glow,
swallows the black outline of Longos. Stars light the sky; a rising
moon, the earth. He goes to bed, to rise at three for the church,
where the golden points of candles cast only shadows, no light.
Slowly the dawn encroaches, bloodless through the windows, bringing
shape to the pillars, damping the flames. <i>"Glory to Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, now and forever, through the aeons of the
aeons."</i> And, sung to God, another day begins.</p>

<p>Finally the balcony forms an integral feature of that remarkable
and distinct phenomenon, Athonite architecture. But, marvel that
Dionysiou is, better will follow. Till then it must rest on the
laurels of domesticity alone.</p>

<p>Despite its position directly above the water, the climb to the
monastery occupied a quarter of an hour, the road leading straight
for the heart of the hills in the opposite direction, before it
finally curved back in a level stretch to the gate. A portly
guest-master, beetle-bearded like an Assyrian king, received us
without enthusiasm. And a lesser minion handed the expected tray as
we gazed from the windows on to the port and boat-houses
immediately beneath, the black conical heaps of charcoal, yellow
stacks of wood, spheroid trees of bright green, and vermilion-tiled
roofs, all resembling an aerial map. Ignoring our preoccupation,
the guest-master hinted that our attendance in the church might be
appreciated. Much loth, we descended and stood through the hour,
supported on the crutch-like arms of the pews and craning at the
frescoes which we hoped to photograph.</p>

<p>The service over, the monks began to assemble before the
refectory door in a low cloister adorned with sixteenth century
scenes from the Apocalypse. Among them, leaning white and bent upon
his staff of office, was the abbot, to whom we bowed our
salutations. The monks, however, waved us away. "To the gate," they
said, "to the gate." But, wishing to fetch some object from the
guest-room, I turned the angle of the church in that direction, to
find myself once more admonished, "To the gate, the gate!" So to
the gate we went, and sat there beneath a vinery, talking to other
monks with us and watching mules eat hay in an open stable on the
terrace.</p>

<p>Dinner, a meal of acrid insufficiency, was shared by Father
Gabriel, deputed to entertain us&mdash;an unusual type, with sad
brown eyes and chestnut hair. His voice was soft and deliberative,
reluctant of inflexion, as unlike as possible to that of the
ordinary Greek. At first, conversation progressed slowly. But a
casual remark led us to Byzantine history, in which he was
proficient. On learning that David was not only an "Oxford
professor," but had lately conducted the excavations at
Constantinople, he warmed towards us. We broached the frescoes. He
would make enquiries in the morning. He then continued with the
history of the monastery, the youngest but one on the Mountain and
founded in 1375 by the Emperor Alexius III Comnenus of
Trebizond.</p>

<p>"The imperial chrysobul still exists," he said, "in the abbot's
keeping. It has pictures of the emperor, the empress, and their
children."</p>

<p>The Trapezuntine Empire, negligible in area and void of
political achievement, occupies a singular position in the tale of
that uncircumscribed world between Europe and Asia whence the West
has drawn its soul. It rounds the pattern of history to completion.
The fall of Constantinople, the most gorgeous and dramatic funeral
act which a nation ever achieved to fire the chroniclers of
posterity, has been sung. But shall the epilogue stop short on this
crescendo, this blast of pathos, conscious even in the players? Not
yet; the minor theme is heard another eight years. Till 1461 the
echoes call over the Black Sea from Trebizond. Only then, with the
advance of Mahommet's army against the last Christian emperor of
the East and the last of Greek independence, opens the silence.</p>

<p>The span of a human life seldom outlasts a century. This
imperial diadem, which Constantine completed with a cross, saw the
twelfth of its age begin. History shows no parallel in heroism to
that of this institution. And those to whom history, like music and
the other arts, offers port in the eternal quest, have run to the
scrutiny of this ultimate phase; just as others, inspired by the
characters of individuals, have searched the records of their
deaths for last fragmentary words. But in the case of Trebizond,
beyond the recital of battles and the court's intrigues, small
evidence has survived. An English embassy to Tamerlane at the end
of the fourteenth century wore its shoe-leather to ruin on the
cobbled streets. And Bessarion, the Greek cardinal, whose house in
Rome was the focus of the refugees, has left a description of his
native place: churches, libraries, palaces, and gardens grouped
above the sea. But the mosaic portraits of the Trapezuntine
sovereigns, that endured till the middle of the nineteenth century,
are gone. And the collections of Greek manuscripts are barren.
Gabriel's words, therefore, set our minds afire. When might we see
this document in the tail-piece of our romance?</p>

<p>See it? This aspect of the question had not, apparently,
occurred to Gabriel. It would be difficult. He himself, an elder,
had never seen it. The well-known Professor Millet, who stayed in
the monastery a month, had begged and begged; but he had never seen
it. The Governor had seen it. But he had come in company with the
exiled Archbishop of Trebizond, whom it was impossible to refuse.
He had also, he afterwards told us, brought a wooden cylinder on
which it might be rolled. For hitherto it had been folded, to the
detriment of its illuminations. Our excitement was so marked that
Gabriel consented to attempt permission for us in the morning.</p>

<p>But we failed. Anxious not to seem too insistent till the main
business of the photographing was accomplished, I waited till the
last evening before addressing a letter of supplication, in as
elegant Greek as I could devise, to his honoured sanctity, the
abbot. This had a certain effect, but for the moment not
sufficient. Having been shown in the church an <i>eicon</i> of the
Emperor Alexius III copied from the chrysobul, I returned again to
the charge on the last afternoon. It seemed there was still hope.
Gabriel left the church, only to return five minutes later with the
news that it was impossible.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The abbot has read your letter," Gabriel replied, "and he is
willing. But the other two are not."</p>

<p>"Who are the other two?"</p>

<p>"A <i>cenobion</i> is ruled by an abbot and two
<i>epitropoi.</i> It is they who have decided that you cannot see
it. Why, I do not know. I have never seen it. No one ever has. But
I tell you this&mdash;as well as the abbot and the
<i>epitropoi,</i> there is the <i>synaxis,</i> a council of ten. Of
that council, which meets on Mondays, I am the leading member. And,
when it does meet, we can overrule the two <i>epitropoi.</i> If you
were to return after a week or a fortnight, it would be easy."</p>

<p>"We will," I said, "after a fortnight. We will write to
you."</p>

<p>But it was far more than two weeks before we were ready. And we
learned, as we were about to start back, that Gabriel had been
called on a journey to the mainland.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that had we known the nature of the
document for which we were enquiring, we should not have desisted
in our persuasions so easily. We should at least have returned the
Monday after. For it was unlikely that we should ever revisit the
Mountain with such credentials as we had brought with us on the
present occasion from the Ecumenical Patriarch, the Greek Foreign
Office, and the Metropolitan of Athens, all of which were set forth
in our letter of recommendation from the Synod. And it appears that
this charter of Dionysiou&mdash;a monastery noted half a century
ago for its secretive tendencies&mdash;is perhaps the finest later
mediaeval manuscript in existence. The description given by Finlay,
based on that of Fallmerayer, who published the text without
illustrations in the Transactions of the Academy of Munich in 1843,
justifies the superlative.</p>

<p>The roll itself is "a foot and a half broad and fifteen feet
long, surrounded by a rich border of arabesques. The imperial
titles are set forth in capitals about three inches high,
emblazoned in gold and ultramarine; and the word Majesty, wherever
it occurs in the document, is always written like the emperor's
signature, with the imperial red ink...At its head, under a
half-length figure of our Saviour with hands extended to bless the
imperial figures," stand the "two full-length portraits of the
Emperor Alexius and the Empress Theodora, sixteen inches high." It
is curious that the children, mentioned by Gabriel, are not
enumerated. Below the portraits hang the "two golden bullae, each
the size of a crown piece, bearing the respective effigies and
titles of the two sovereigns." These are attached with clasps of
gold.</p>

<p>Such is the treasure which we failed to record, and which awaits
the death of the two <i>epitropoi</i> to gladden the sight of
future travellers.</p>

<p>The atmosphere during our stay at Dionysiou disclosed a strange
mixture of hospitality and severity, the latter resulting from a
stricter observance of ascetic practices than is usual on the
Mountain. A cigarette lit while working in the refectory cloister
was denounced with angry brow. In which there was a certain irony;
since, from the time of leaving school, where tobacco was a
convention, I had never once smoked till my arrival on the
Mountain, when I found it necessary in order to tide the gaps in
social intercourse. But any peculiarity in the monks' behaviour was
surpassed by the spectacular eccentricity of the monastery's actual
appearance. It is here that the mind of the monkish renovator has
found its most fantastic outlet. Pressed about by overhanging
hills, the quadrilateral of forbidding grey stone walls rises to a
roofing of grey stone tiles. And in their midst, occupying, by
reason of the smallness of the rocky pedestal, almost the whole of
the courtyard, rears a large church painted from roof to pavement a
roaring pillar-box vermilion, which is kept perennially brilliant
with fresh coats. The effect was such, as we looked between our
balcony upon these mottled scarlet walls scarcely four feet away
and framed in a sky of complementary blue, that Reinecker painfully
rubbed his eyes and expressed the opinion that the monks must be
colour-blind. Each morning a fresh shock lay in store, as, emerging
unthinking from the bedroom, there beat upon the retina these
leaded scarlet cylinders, gigantic in their proximity. Round the
corner, as if further to astonish, rose a balconied and gabled
clock-tower that looked as though it had been built in Nuremberg
and bodily exported, with a clock face in Turkish numerals ready
attached.</p>

<p>We had worked all the morning in the refectory. And, on
enquiring once more when we might engage upon the church, there was
unloosed a flood of suspicion upon David as the photographer. One
of the obstinate <i>epitropoi</i> was ushered to our rooms,
accompanied by Father Chrysostom, who spoke German and was the
holder of two diplomas in philosophy at Leipzig University. Bearing
in his hand the letter which Monsieur Lelis had written us, and
which we had delivered, with that of the Synod, to the porter, the
<i>epitropos</i> asked David, through Chrysostom:</p>

<p>"How did you get this?"</p>

<p>"The Governor gave it us."</p>

<p>"Did you ask him for it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why did he give it you?"</p>

<p>"We had a letter to him from a friend of his in Athens."</p>

<p>"Oh." This seemed to clear the air.</p>

<p>The <i>epitropos</i> then turned to me:</p>

<p>"Was it you who visited the monastery in the company of the
Governor last year?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But you came here last year?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In what month?"</p>

<p>"August."</p>

<p>"Good. The church will be open in an hour's time."</p>

<p>Thankful to have negotiated in safety this alarming exhibition
of dislike for the civil representative, we decided for the future
to conceal the Governor's letter. The church was very tall and
high, the frescoes being the work of a Cretan of Venetian
extraction named Zorzi. His attempted infusion of later Italian
grace into the strict iconography of the Orthodox Church was not
altogether happy. Later the others bathed; while I, health
disturbed by the food, picked my way to an isolated rock in the sea
and sketched the monastery from immediately below, with an eye to
the balconies: not, let it be said, in the expectation of creating
a work of art; but in order to restore my peace of mind. I had no
sooner folded my legs on this islet than Aeolus blew and Poseidon
lashed. Drops of rain clattered on the page. Darkness hid the
monastery. Triumphing over the inclemency of nature, I persevered
till seven o'clock. When, feeling that in this of all monasteries
the gates would not be reopened to the delinquent, I stumbled up
the hill as the night, which had lifted, fell again.</p>

<p>The day was Friday, observed as a fast by the guest-master with
malignant pleasure. Lunch we could not eat. Dinner consisted of a
piece of brown bread and a slice of aubergine. Even the water had
stopped running in the taps. So that David, to wash the plates, had
recourse to the fire hydrant on the floor below. The fire engine
lay padlocked in a wooden cage to one side, a strange machine
resembling a small gasometer fitted to the chassis of a Roman
chariot.</p>

<p>It had been arranged by Gabriel that on the following morning we
should visit the library. This contains one of the finest
collections of illuminated manuscripts on the Mountain. The books
in the majority of Athonite libraries have been catalogued by
Lambros, at the expense of the University of Cambridge, which hoped
to discover lost classics, but, fortunately for an overstocked
world, was foiled in its attempt. Each library possesses a printed
copy of its own section, so that those who are interested, yet
ignorant, may discover the approximate date and other details of
any particular volume. Though conscious of the sacrilege involved
in comment on the historic rather than the aesthetic value of a
work of art, I could not but note the extraordinary elaboration of
Byzantine furnishings exhibited in the traditional portraits of the
evangelists in a copy of the Gospels. Each of the writers was
seated at a desk of light wood inlaid with dark, after the manner
of the seventeenth century; some containing books on shelves; while
that of St. Luke was fitted with a series of glass pharmacy jars
such as those which advertise a chemist. On each desk, a smaller
reading-desk was supporting the manuscript in progress. While
below, such was the variety of office fittings that one looked
instinctively for the telephone; pens, paper-knives, clasp-knives,
compasses, and ink-pots containing red and blue ink, lay neatly to
the writer's convenience. One of the evangelists was seated in a
huge basket chair with a hood, such as may still be found in the
halls of larget London houses.</p>

<p>Another and bigger Gospels, brought reverently from a drawer and
laid on a piece of brocade spread for the purpose, was encased in a
cover of sixteenth century Rumanian silver gilt, on which much of
the enamel surrounding the heads of the martyrs and evangelists in
the border was still in place. It would be difficult to discover a
more apt illustration of the cultural ruin that overtook the
Balkans after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 than the
comparison between this and that of Nicephorus Phocas at the Lavra.
The latter breathes the splendour, the restraint, and the
sophistication of an imperial capital; the former, though in itself
beautiful, a poverty of composition and folky incoherence of
motives which tells of a people already a century debarred from the
source of their incipient civilisation. The book was presented to
the monastery by the "Voivode John Mirtchea and the Hospojda
Kniejna and his daughter Stana and his son Peter." So runs the
inscription between the portraits of the family. John Mirtchea was
Voivode of Wallachia between 1541 and 1559. The metal, though not
exactly coarse, possesses a texture that can only be described as
"frosted."</p>

<p>The librarian, Father Haralambos, then requested our signatures
for the visitors' book. It was with shame that we discovered those
of last year, attached to a frivolous superscription concerning the
excellence of the monastery's jam, ill placed among the poems and
laudations of weighty doctors from Munich and Upsala. On this
occasion we made amends with a testimony in cursive Greek to the
monastery's kindness. Haralambos then descended with us to the
guest-room, where Mark conveyed him to paper in terms of black silk
and astrakhan.</p>

<p>The guest-master was now genuinely troubled at our inability to
touch his food, and, on my becoming dizzy for want of it during the
afternoon's work, hurried to my side with restoratives. Later we
were conducted to the church to see the holy treasures. A large
candle was lit; a board placed upon two stools and covered with a
cloth; the priest invested with his stole. And with much ceremony
the incomparable reliquary of St. Niphon was placed before the
doors of the altar for our inspection. Of all products of the North
Balkan, that cultural no-man's-land between east and west Europe,
this object is perhaps the most extraordinary and the most
beautiful. Niphon was the successor of Gennadius, the first
Ecumenical Patriarch after the fall of Constantinople. But at some
unknown date, wearying of public life, he had retired incognito to
Dionysiou, where he served the rest of his life as a muleteer. On
his death in 1515, his identity was discovered. And his bones, with
the exception of his head and right hand, which are now said to be
in Hungary, were encased in this coffer, sent from Wallachia by the
Voivode Neagno&euml;, whose confessor and godfather the Patriarch
had been.</p>

<p>A dedicatory inscription, presumed to be contemporary with the
occasion of the Patriarch's consignment to the coffer, describes it
as a "venerable and holy urn." If, therefore, it was already in
existence before being converted to its present purpose, the
discrepancy between its superb craftsmanship and the ill-balanced
hammering of the book-cover described above, which hailed from the
same region only thirty years later, is explained. Two feet high,
one foot eleven inches long, and one broad, it takes the shape of a
cruciform church, bearing five typically Byzantine cupolas
glittering as of gold, though in reality they are probably of
silver gilt. Around all four sides of this edifice, below the roof,
runs a double frieze of saints in enamel. It is noticeable how the
quality and colouring of the latter has deteriorated from the true
Byzantine. But the outstanding and astonishing feature of the whole
is the magnificently wrought tracery which, together with the
numerous pinnacles of the cornice, is entirely Gothic. Thus it is
shown how, with the destruction of the Eastern Empire, western
forms began to permeate the strongholds whence all mediaeval
culture had originally sprung.</p>

<p>The priest also submitted to our curiosity one of St.
Christopher's tusks. St. Christopher, it will be remembered, was
born with a dog's face, which was only transformed to human after
his embracing Christianity. His personal beauty then was such that
he converted 48,000 persons, including the courtesans sent to
seduce him. But most historically interesting was a small cross
engraved with the following words: "Dedicated by Helen
Palaeologina, Princess of the Romans, wife of King Manuel
Palaeologus, daughter of the Draga, Lord of Serbia." This
inscription refers to Helen, mother of the Emperor Constantine XI
Dragases, last of that unbroken succession of sovereigns who ruled
the East for 1,123 years&mdash;he who fell fighting the Turks on
the walls of Constantinople. This cross, we felt, was something in
the nature of a personal relic of him. For, beyond a doubtfully
accredited sword in the Constantinople museum and the stone eagle
marking the site of his coronation at Mistra, there are none.
Helen, whose father drew his title from a principality in
Macedonia, predeceased her son by three years, dying on March 13th,
1450.</p>

<p>Having pressed upon the priest, whom we had kept nearly an hour,
an offering for the church, and on Gabriel an elegant little tome
dealing with some province of Anglican ecclesiastics, we sought the
guest-master. So poignant was his remorse for his <i>cuisine</i>
that he could hardly be persuaded to accept our donation. The
luggage was taken on mules to the sea. And we unloosed in a small
boat dangerously weighted in view of a threatening storm. As we
coasted warily along the cliffs, there assailed us a violent smell;
and, dropping our eyes to the bottom of the boat, we perceived that
our overcoats had descended with a thud on to the matter whence it
was exuding. The holy boatman was so convulsed with merriment at
this discovery that he was obliged to drop his oars&mdash;an
alarming action in so rough a sea. But he was induced to resume
them by the sudden advent of another boat which threatened to run
us down as we passed between the promontory round which it had come
and an evil black rock. To warn us, its occupants blew a long blast
on a horn, which echoed weirdly over the grey sea and up the
cliffs.</p>

<p>Thus we reached Gregoriou.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch9"></a>Chapter IX. SOCIETY</h2>

<p>Like Dionysiou, Gregoriou also stands on a rock above the water,
but presents a domestic and less spectacular appearance. The
buildings ramble unpretentiously round two courtyards: the outer,
large and square, dating from the early nineteenth century; the
inner containing an old stone campanile ornamented with double
stripes of tiling, and an unassuming church washed primrose yellow.
Our guest suite had a classical flavour, each door being surmounted
by a broken pediment. But the coloured stencillings on the walls,
and the round table transfixed upon a pillar stretching from floor
to ceiling of the reception-room, betrayed a later taste. On the
table, which was deeply fringed, sat various albums and a small
globe.</p>

<p>The guest-master's assistant, whose inordinately tall Byzantine
body ended in the face of a girl of seventeen, snub nose and liquid
eyes mooning from his beard, eyed us with a drop-jawed contempt
that led us to doubt his sanity.</p>

<p>"Is Father Stephen here?" I asked.</p>

<p>In reply he left the room. But returned to demand our
credentials. These evoked not Father Stephen, but Father Barlaam, a
twinkling monk with an authoritative walk, short ragged beard, and
turned-back cuffs. He was interested in our work, and was a man of
much intelligence, having catalogued both the history and treasures
of his monastery in an illustrated book which he showed us lying on
the table. The subject of certain Byzantine professors arose, upon
whom he exercised an unholy sarcasm more reminiscent of the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> than a "simple monk." In doing so, he
echoed the tone of the monastery. Let those who think to leave the
conversational graces at home beware when they arrive here.</p>

<p>It was late. And with the darkness, dinner was immediately
announced. We were invited, as I had expected, to dine with the
abbot and the elders. Having attempted a certain spruceness of
appearance, we were lined up for grace in a small refectory, when
Father Stephen appeared.</p>

<p>Last year, reaching Gregoriou from the other direction, we had
encountered the abbot of Castamonitou, who was returning from
conducting a service in the church of the Transfiguration on the
summit. A ceremonial banquet was laid in a larger room than the
present, to which we were bidden as now. Thanks were given God,
calls for cocktails mingling with the repeated <i>Kyrie
eleison.</i> All were then seated, the guests being so disposed as
to separate as far as possible members of the respective parties.
Being ignorant at that time of all but the travelling essentials of
the language, conversation seemed for me impossible. Nor could the
food&mdash;cold octopus in an oily salad&mdash;be expected wholly
to occupy the attention. My only recourse was the decanter,
provided, as is customary, one to each person. Gripped by a vinous
pentecost, I launched into speech:</p>

<p>"We bathe every day, Father Stephen. Are there sharks here?"</p>

<p>"Sharks? They abound."</p>

<p>"Have you seen them?"</p>

<p>"I? No, I haven't seen them. But there are quantities."</p>

<p>"But if you haven't seen them, how do you know?"</p>

<p>"How do I know? They ate a deacon two hundred and fifty years
ago. A lamb was set as a bait; they caught the shark, and there he
was inside."</p>

<p>Having long arranged, in case of natural and accessible death,
to be buried in a mackintosh and manure the garden, I was appalled
by this prospect of leaving my vile body, not even digested, in the
stomach of a fish. And resolved, in the contemplative silence that
followed, never to bathe again. Next morning, however, we were all
swimming about the bay as usual. And would have been, had the teeth
of the monsters been snapping at the actual steps of the jetty. It
needs more than the prospect of death and hell to forgo the waters
of Athos.</p>

<p>Father Stephen was the most remarkable personality we met. His
age was expressed in his short, snow-white beard. But he was tall
and upright, exhaling as he walked, that conceit, hairsbreadth from
a swagger, which marks a peer who has won the Derby. In
conversation dry and witty, he was versed in current affairs;
historically, his outlook was based on a broad appreciation of
national temperaments. In his youth, he had been imprisoned by the
Turks in Salonica for maintaining that the Ecumenical Patriarch was
the head of all the Greeks. His theories with regard to the Near
East were interesting. With Napoleon's expedition to Egypt, he
said, the whole Levant had been Gallicised. And after that came the
German King Otho and his Bavarians. It was only lately that the
Greeks had adopted the English as their model in the West.</p>

<p>On the morning after the banquet, Father Stephen had taken us to
the church, helped us to photograph an <i>eicon,</i> and also stood
for us himself. We had promised to send him copies. But, as neither
shot succeeded, we were unable. He was now, as he took his place at
the head of the table, reproachful.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Kyrie Vyron? How are you? Well? You never sent
me those photographs last year."</p>

<p>"I did not forget, Father Stephen. But they were not
successful."</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" He was incredulous.</p>

<p>"It is the truth. I knew nothing about a camera then. The light
got in. This year I will send you lots."</p>

<p>He appeared to doubt it, and changed the subject.</p>

<p>"I see that the Prince of Wales is doing well in Canada. And the
Foreign Minister with him."</p>

<p>"No," I said. "It is the Prime Minister."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Baldwin. And what do people think of Lloyd George now?
And the Socialists, Macdonald and Thomas? There are Bolshevists in
England, are there not? You really must cut off their heads. Here
we have none. If we had, that is how we should treat them."</p>

<p>This singular knowledge of British affairs is common enough on
the mainland, where strangers in trains will frequently put the
casual Englishman to shame by enquiring the rights of some abstruse
incident in the early career of Mr. Clynes. In the monasteries it
is not. We met a number of monks who, enquiring tenderly after our
political state as though of the health of a friend, were anxious
to know if we were engaged in any war. While one and all spoke with
vague affection of Lloyd George as "the friend of Greece"&mdash;a
generous tribute, considering the proportions of the catastrophe
which his policy engendered for them. At the same time, the above
extracts of conversation show that, to apply the hackneyed epithets
of ignorance and stupidity to the whole of the Athonite community
is to deflect their mark only to the writer. Nor is this merely a
happy condition of the present. Tozer remarked in the 'sixties upon
the monks' solicitude as to "whether the queen had recovered her
health; and they were quite ready," he continues, "to talk on such
subjects as Victor Emmanuel and the state of Italy, the war in
America and the Atlantic telegraph, the Leviathan&mdash;as they
called the <i>Great Eastern</i>&mdash;the Suez Canal, and similar
topics of the day." This, moreover, was in one of the smaller and
poorer monasteries.</p>

<p>Grace completed, we sat down. The abbot took the head of the
table opposite Father Stephen. On his left was myself, followed by
Mark and David; on his right an <i>epitropos</i> and Father
Barlaam, between whom were placed a priest from the mainland and a
layman, plump and moustached. The assistant guest-master, towering
over the table with eyes lifted in eternal protestation, waited.
The light was localised by two lamps, one warm and incompetent, the
other cold and bright, which cast the farther side of the room into
total blackness.</p>

<p>A certain stiffness pervaded the meal. The abbot, though human
and pleasantly inclined, was none the less an abbot. Each dish was
placed before him first, with a bow. Once in five minutes he
addressed a remark to the company. After an attempt to initiate
conversation by remarking, in the voice of a practised
<i>raconteur,</i> that we had been to the top, I thought it better
to wait till I was spoken to. The layman attempted to fill the gap.
But, having learnt his English in the United States, was troubled
by our inability to understand it.</p>

<p>"You pronounce different," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, we do."</p>

<p>"I ran over Canada once. Friend mine had lill mo'-cycle. Fine
place. Now do business here&mdash;buy wood from monks. Make no
money in Greece"; and he shrugged his shoulders and jerked down the
corners of his mouth as Greeks do to denote disgust. He was a
pleasant example of a type which, being compounded of the most
conceited mentality and the most democratic manners on earth, is as
repulsive as anything that humanity has yet achieved.</p>

<p>Though loth to revert to the details of our food, it is
impossible to pass in silence the disintegrated and nameless fish
with which the meal opened; the cod that followed, salted after it
had rotted in the summer sun; the macaroni, embalmed in the juice
of goats' udders curdled to a shrill sourness; water-melon, ghastly
pink like some spongy segment of a body delved from the intestines
of a dog-fish; and accompanying all, like a rasping bassoon in a
band of village oboes, thick resinated wine tasting of pine-needles
and reducing the human mouth to the texture of a cat's. The abbot
continued to heap my plate. And the others ate greedily.
Nevertheless, at the end of the meal we were thankful for this
profuse hospitality, since having starved at Dionysiou, we were in
need of food.</p>

<p>Later, we drank coffee in the reception-room of the guest suite
and looked through a book of paintings of the War of Independence
by that Teutonic Delacroix, Von Hess, which were reproduced in
colour. The monks and priest left early, as it was the eve of the
feast of St. John the Prodrome, and there was to be an
<i>agrypnia</i>&mdash;an all-night service.</p>

<p>"This is our work," said Father Stephen, with assumed
bitterness. "Good night to you."</p>

<p>On returning to our rooms, we found that all the luggage had
arrived from the harbour with the exception of my suit-case. I
descended with anxious query to the kitchen. The guest-master
looked surprised. But a monk was found who, after much
prevarication, admitted that, owing to its weight, they had locked
it up in a boathouse.</p>

<p>"But I must have it."</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I shall stay here till it comes."</p>

<p>He departed. There was a full moon. Framed in the supports of
the balcony outside, it lit the olive-grown slopes of the Mountain,
casting a small round shadow beneath each evanescent tree. Below,
the sea came washing silver-spittled down the jagged black line of
cliffs. The clustered domes and chimneys of the monastery stood
silhouetted in the foreground. And from a faintly glowing window in
the depths beneath came the sour melancholies and sudden halts of
chanting: "our work." Then clouds came up, taking the light; the
sea went dull as silver breathed on; the olives lost themselves in
the earth.</p>

<p>And the bag arrived.</p>

<p>We had intended, as there were no frescoes of importance, to
spend only one night at Gregoriou. But so great was the relief,
both of David and myself, at being quit of the photographing, that
we consented to the monks' importunities and stayed another. The
anxiety of obtaining permission for our labours has been described.
To the operator and the interested spectator the actual process was
not less harassing. A monk was always with us. Sometimes he was all
assistance, an actual hindrance in his wish to be of use; at
others, a lynx-eyed religious guarding the Lord's treasures from
the heathen; barring the doors of the <i>eiconostasis,</i> frowning
on the manipulation of the sacred luminaries, lamps, candelabras,
and candle-holding crosses which obscured the camera's view; and
closing the church at the first possible excuse; all from plainly
comprehensible motives, but not the less irritating for the feeling
that, in his place, we should probably have acted likewise.</p>

<p>But, even with every facility granted&mdash;ladders thrust upon
us, feet urged to the very altar&mdash;the hair-raising feats of
equilibrium demanded, destroyed all peace of mind. Anxious to
reassure David in the importance of all the frescoes which, being
my choice, he naturally likes least, I enter the church. He has
disappeared. Only the monk is asleep in a stall. Suddenly the
sacred fane trembles with the oath of a Heliogabalus, and he
materialises: clinging apelike to the ridge of the
<i>eiconostasis;</i> balancing on a step-ladder four feet across
the bottom, four inches at the top; vainly digging the points of
the tripod into the marble inlay; hurling psalter and Bible from
his path; elbowing concealed sacraments. Crash! Two plates hurtle
to the ground; a colour-filter twitters into fragments; or the
camera itself collapses like a spread balloon, the tripod becoming
more and more, as time went on, a thing of string rather than
wood.</p>

<p>At length the first half-dozen plates are used (or broken) and
must be changed. This needs darkness. Sometimes a convenient
cupboard offers; in which David performs the operation, his ears
contorted between his knees, while we, spreadeagled over a
counterpane to block the cracks, are entertained by muffled
rattles, half paper, half human. When the doors are opened, the
blast of a furnace rushes into the room, and David goes to change
his clothes. If there is no cupboard, it is necessary to drape a
small table with the bed-clothes and form a little house such as
used to enliven the nursery on wet afternoons. The merriment of
dignified fathers at this shorn and muscular Venus emerging from
its linen foam at their feet, was painful to the ear. Ultimately
David returns to the church, to find the monk imprinting his own
eye upon the plate in the middle of an exposure, by looking down
the lens.</p>

<p>Thus freed on this particular Sunday morning, from an onerous
duty, we lay idly abed. Till the sun, creeping round the corner of
the bay, called us to the water. I had swum across to right beneath
the monastery windows, rousing the inmates with cries of "Sharks!";
and, having returned, had wheedled a mug of boiling water from the
kitchen; when Reinecker, face blanched and lips incoherent with the
pressure of words, rushed upon me to say that the American Greek
had told him there was no boat to-morrow night but one to-night
which he must catch owing to the connection on Tuesday night at
Salonica and his journey at Munich he definitely had to be in Paris
by the fifteenth and everything would be all right if it wasn't for
his beastly passport which he knew all along we ought to have got
out of that man in Caryes all his life he had never liked to be
without it now what was he to do?</p>

<p>Frozen by this spate, I covered the mug with a handkerchief and
approached Father Stephen, at the end of the balcony outside the
window to our room.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said. "How much did this clock of yours cost?
It's a nice thing."</p>

<p>"I don't know. It was a present."</p>

<p>"Who from?"</p>

<p>"My&mdash;" The word for aunt escaped me. "My father's sister";
though, in fact, it was my mother's. My father's sisters dislike me
too much to speak to me, far from placating me with gifts.
Reinecker's teeth were grinding.</p>

<p>"But tell me," continued Father Stephen, "how much would such a
clock cost in England?"</p>

<p>"I suppose about 1,500 drachmas." And, before he could interrupt
again, I broached Reinecker's dilemma.</p>

<p>"There's one of our boats leaving for Daphni this moment," said
Father Stephen, pointing down to the sea beneath. "He must catch
it."</p>

<p>I translated. Demoniac, he rushed to pack, while Father Stephen
yelled to the boat to wait and I devised letters to the police.
Snatching them up, Reinecker tore from the building with a
strangled good-bye. We last saw him rounding a cliff in a tiny
cockle, which, for some unexplained reason, was filled with open
umbrellas.</p>

<p>It seemed, after a lunch off cold red octopus tasting between
rabbit and oil-cloth, our duty to attend vespers. This perpetual
church-going on hot afternoons is the least enjoyable incident in
the sequence of Athonite life. At first the service interests; for
the Orthodox ritual possesses an impersonal beauty lacking in the
West, where pomp of priest or humility of parson inevitably
obtrudes. Instrumental music is forbidden; and the singing, at
first unintelligible to the western ear, is taken up alternately on
different sides of the church. The central moment is the opening of
the <i>eiconostasis</i> doors at the elevation of the sacrament,
when the monks remove their veils and the whole congregation and
all the <i>eicons</i> are censed individually. The Athonite
churches too, however modern, are not, with the exception of the
Russian, ugly. Those like that of St. Paul's, which, being
comparatively modern, are not frescoed, but bare white, provide
perhaps the better setting for the holy pictures of an older date
that now hang about the walls and pillars. But the majority are
covered, and wholly covered, as tradition demands, with scenes from
the life of the Virgin and her son, each occasion being divided
from its neighbours by narrow bands of red and white. From the
fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries, artistically valuable or
not, their effect is invariably decorative.</p>

<p>Imprisoned in a narrow stall; fearing for etiquette's sake to
rest wholly on the narrow ledge provided by the upturned seat; half
stupefied with the heat, the incense, and the midday meal; the
beholder develops an unconscious familiarity with the different
cycles of iconography that prevail upon the Mountain: the alert ass
of the Passion in this arch; the oxen lowing to the new-born Christ
in that; in the south transept, geometric rays of Christ
transfigured, distorting to the curve of the terminal vault;
opposite, in the north, Christ treading delicately the grave-tops
of purgatory; over the entrance-door, the Virgin stretched in the
rigid pallor of her assumption, Christ gathering to himself her
soul in the guise of a little child; behind the painted wooden
crucifix that surmounts the <i>eiconostasis,</i> itself so deeply
and minutely carved as to resemble some giant creepered wall
petrified to gold, glimpses of Pentecost and the Ascension; they
all become imprinted on the mind; till, with any change, the
attention, hitherto subconscious, is suddenly aroused. Wearily the
seconds join the minutes, and the minutes form an hour. At last the
monks, kissing and prostrating at their chosen <i>eicons,</i> file
out. And we are left to ask if we may see the treasures, while the
priest&mdash;for only a few of the monks are priests&mdash;is here
to show them.</p>

<p>In the present church of Gregoriou our interest centred round
the paintings. The first was a head of St. Nicolas, a piece of
fresco saved from the old church and converted into an <i>eicon</i>
by an inharmonious casing of modern silver. Only the face was
visible, a fine example of Byzantine formalism; though of what
date, no record of the previous buildings has survived to tell. The
other was a seventeenth or early eighteenth century picture of the
Virgin, a life-size head and shoulders, set in an original carved
gilt frame and designated the <i>Panaghia
Galactotrophousa</i>&mdash;the Milk-Feeding All-Holy. This must be
one of the most notable of later Greek paintings in existence.
While departing in some degree from the austerity of the earlier
Byzantine, it has nevertheless kept clear of the Italian influence
that was gradually permeating such flickers of culture as the
Balkans still could boast. The face, more rounded, more gently
shadowed, more filled with sympathy than is familiar, has yet lost
none of that abstraction and detachment that characterised
Byzantine art in its heyday before the Latin conquest and in the
later Renaissance under the Palaeologi. The drapery of head and
mantle are of flowered scarlet silk. The child sucks a pear-shaped
breast, dark in tone as the face. And punctured and engraved on the
gilded jesso background is a halo, interrupted by a high painted
crown.</p>

<p>But as we looked, our admiration was tempered with horror. For,
in addition to the ancient silver hands, there had been
superimposed upon the old crown since my previous view a new one of
shining silver, set with glass jewels. Here at least it is
impossible not to wish that the Greek Government had not renounced
the power to forbid the desecration of recognised works of art with
these metal sheathings. Yet the history of this actual
<i>eicon,</i> together with a large company of others that adorn
the church, renders the Hellenic authorities forfeit of sympathy.
The pictures had, until 1916, formed part of the church furnishings
of a farm near Salonica belonging to the monastery. In that year
the monk overseeing the estate had delivered them, persuaded by the
possibility of invasion, into the custody of the newly founded
Byzantine Museum. And it was not until 1921 that the monastery was
able to regain possession of them by the ultimate despatch of
Barlaam to Athens, where his tongue no doubt caused consternation
among those on whom it was loosed. Items in the correspondence with
which the incident began and ended were quoted in Barlaam's book; a
copy of which, accompanied by a fine plate of the <i>Panaghia</i>,
which is here reproduced, he gave me next morning as a farewell
present.</p>

<p>In preparation for arrival at Daphni and its post-office next
day, we wrote letters during the evening, amongst others one to the
Ecumenical Patriarch to thank him for his recommendations. This was
an illiterate screed, in no way comparable to the flower of prose
penned several months before with the aid of a tutor in the yellow
attic off the Marylebone Road.</p>

<p>At dinner Father Barlaam alone entertained us, referring once
more to the original orientation of modern Greece towards things
French.</p>

<p>"Now we follow England alone!"</p>

<p>This remark was succeeded by a series of compliments so
embarrassing in their sincerity that I pretended not to understand
them.</p>

<p>"I should like to be an English subject," he said.</p>

<p>"When I am an old man," I replied, "we will exchange. You shall
become one; and I will be a monk on Mount Athos."</p>

<p>"Why not now?"</p>

<p>"I have things to do first.</p>

<p>"What do you think," I continued, "of the new constitution and
the new governor?"</p>

<p>"We shall see how it works in a few years."</p>

<p>"There always used to be a Turkish <i>kaimakam</i> in Caryes,
did there not?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But he had no work to do."</p>

<p>"Has this one?"</p>

<p>"No, but he thinks he has. Another time, Kyrie Vyron, when you
know Greek better, we will discuss many things."</p>

<p>Exhausted after his last night's vigil in the church, Father
Barlaam forsook us immediately after dinner.</p>

<p>Seated round the albums, the conversation turned on national
dress.</p>

<p>"Everyone knows," said David and I, "that Prince Albert invented
the kilt."</p>

<p>Whereat Mark also retired, embittered.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch10"></a>Chapter X. REJECTION OF GRAVITY</h2>

<p>It is possible, for those who are old or young enough to have
escaped the latter age of rationalism, to define the human
itinerary as the quest of Reality; and by the assertion that the
infant conceived in the twentieth century is nearer that goal than
his ancestors the anthropoid and the lung-fish, to suggest, despite
the flavour of moribund Liberalism that attaches, a theory of
progress. To the attainment of this Reality, frequently termed,
with the perversion of common speech, Abstract, all sincere
self-expression is directed. Thus it might seem that those who have
moved farthest up the line are the religious. But theirs is only a
pavement, and one on which, in the present state of human
mentality, the majority is not content to walk. It is the road,
laborious with traffic, that carries the race&mdash;the road to
which every province of human activity contributes the laying. The
real motive-power derives not from the transient soaring of
individuals, but the daily toil of millions.</p>

<p>This fact the Middle Ages, when religion was paramount,
recognised, seeking to inculcate the Christian precept into the
smallest details of existence. And in the degree of their attempt
lies the fundamental distinction between the Byzantine and his
contemporary of the Latin West. For in the West the ways of men
were divided. Either they sought the cloister, there to focus every
particle of their beings on the significance of religion. Or else,
bearing the heat of those hard days when people scarcely outlived
their forties, they were free to leave the business of salvation to
that enormous and efficient proxy, the Roman Church. In the East,
on the contrary, there was no such machinery. The world and the
Church were one, dovetailed with each others' capacities, moving
level. Men and women gave themselves to God as to-day they sign
hotel registers. The world was a monastery, and its convents
therefore not isolated, but of that world. It was a great
experiment: to reconcile in human life the opposing aims of
spiritual and material welfare for the individualist&mdash;that
Greek individualist who can be loyal, but not led. If a thousand
years, a greater span than any European polity achieved before or
since, be success, it succeeded. When it failed, it was in face of
odds before which middle Europe also crumpled as a rotten tree. But
the psychological difference remains. In the mediaeval West there
were two means: there was the path to be followed; or else there
was its postman, the Church. In the East every man was his own
postman. And the way, lighted by neither ethic nor logic, was
shrouded in mystery. To the understanding of all they both created
this distinction holds the key.</p>

<p>Enter a Gothic cathedral. The eye is swept to heaven with a
brute impetus, magnificent in purpose and aspiration, like the
Catholic hierarchy that built it. Turn, in contrast, to St. Sophia.
Here is no definition of journey. The lines of construction and
means of support are invisible. The shadowless, misty interior
seems not to rise from the earth, but to swim, poised above it.
Gothic reaches to the firmament. This has recreated it.</p>

<p>But it was not alone into their temples of the spirit that the
Byzantine infused the element of great inspiration. When Gothic
turned utilitarian, it was mean: witness Oxford and Cambridge.
Little of Byzantine domestic building has survived. But it is
possible on the Holy Mountain to study almost the exact
counterparts, both in date and plan, of the English university
colleges. Fortress through the centuries of a vanished temperament,
Athos has achieved that which the architects of our new industrial
world are also seeking: the impregnation of the utilitarian, of the
walls that house life's chores, with a sense of something other
than the present. Such, too, was the function of Byzantine
religion. While it was these, the Sunday and the week-day, that the
Latin Church strove to separate.</p>

<p>In analysing the architecture of the twentieth century, the new
architecture which is assailing cycle upon cycle of imitative
pedantry, it is possible to term its underlying motive "movement in
mass." This has been achieved hitherto by neither the Gothic nor
the classical; the former being mean, or degenerating, as in the
case of the Houses of Parliament, into lifeless textural ornament;
the latter being wholly stationary. To-day the new spirit may be
observed in such diverse buildings as the later skyscrapers of New
York, Liverpool Cathedral, the town hall at Stockholm, and the
large block known as Adelaide House at the north end of London
Bridge. To this companionship may be added St. Sophia, the outside
of which, viewed dispassionately and without the minarets that do
not belong to it, resembles some modern German laboratory
characterised in the daily Press as the "last word in the
revolutionary construction of the steel age." What, then, have all
these in common? By what means is this movement in mass attained?
The secret lies in uninterrupted stretches of flat perpendicular
surface; in the avoidance of cornice, architrave, or any ornament
that can disturb the sweep of the walls; and in the manipulation of
perpendicular lines so that in fact or in appearance they are made
to converge.</p>

<p>Hence, therefore, the novelty of twentieth century building. But
there exist, none the less, two localities where a precedent style
of architecture has developed and where the same abstract vigour
informs buildings other than places of worship. These are
contained, as if to confirm the other-worldliness of modern
dynamics, within the two monastic dominions that the earth still
possesses: the Byzantine community of Athos; and that little
explored and little understood tableland above the Himalayas,
Thibet. Here in post-mediaeval times have the holy men in their
seclusion erected buildings to which only the London and New York
of the last ten years can offer parallel.</p>

<p>But the affinity between these two monastic republics is more
than one of mere distinction politically from the rest of the
world. The actual similarity in the form and colour of their
buildings is due to more than coincidence. And, though one is
Christian and the other Buddhist, it is plain that the
contemplative life, untrammelled by the western doctrine of
justification by works, is productive, no matter what its religion,
of grand conception and grand execution when its devotees are
engaged on material creation. None but the most inspired genius
could have produced the two buildings which in each stand out above
all others&mdash;the monastery of Simopetra on Athos and the Potala
at Lhassa. And none but the same genius could have produced
buildings so similar. Further, it must be remembered that these
two, the tableland and the mountain, are not merely isolated
communities of a few hundred such as we know in the West, but
worlds within a world, capable of individual cultural
development.</p>

<p>How far early Christian and early Buddhist monasticism were
related is a question that has not been satisfactorily determined.
There is no doubt that while the Buddhist theocracy in Thibet was
actually taking shape, Nestorian Christianity, which had spread
even to Pekin, had many flourishing communities adjacent. Some
influence, it is supposed, must have been exercised by the already
established religion in the formulating of a rule of life for those
of the neighbouring creed who wished to give themselves to the
eternal mysteries.</p>

<p>Apart, however, from the historical consanguinity&mdash;if such,
indeed, exists&mdash;of the two systems, a more important common
factor has contributed to the moulding of their supporters'
temperaments. The psychological relation between landscape and art
is admitted: what country but that which contains Kent, could have
produced Reynolds? And how much more must the eternal panorama cast
its spell over the soul of a monk who day in, day out, contemplates
nothing else? In these God-governed states, the grandeur of the
earth is unique. Of Thibet, even from photographs, it is possible
to conceive the gigantic scale on which the land is cast, the
enormous valleys stretching deeper and farther than the eye has
ever seen, and the hills rising in vast sweeping tiers, one after
the other, in the distance. While to anyone who has sojourned
beneath the Holy Mountain; who has watched its peak, 6,000 feet
sheer from the sea, white against the blue summer sky or magnet of
fierce winter storms; has travelled the wooded ridges and sailed
beneath the marble cliffs; who has gazed on the dim shapes of the
horizon, Lemnos, Longos, and Thasos, colouring and paling to the
time of day; and who has lived in sight of that inexorable sea:
gleaming smooth all colours of a pearl, or silvery blue roughed by
some haphazard puff of air; green turquoise, spitting up white
horses in the clear windy air; leaden grey, pouring over its own
troughs, clanging the shore in ear-filling monotony&mdash;to anyone
who has experienced this whole combination of man-made and God-made
individuality, there cannot but have come an intensification of his
impulse to indefinable, unanalysable emotion.</p>

<p>The quality of "movement in mass" is exhibited in some part or
other by most Athonite monasteries, usually on that side facing the
sea where they are buttressed from a falling face of rock. St.
Paul's and Dionysiou we have seen. There are others, But preeminent
stands Simopetra.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The journey from Gregoriou to Simopetra's arsenal occupied
twenty minutes, the boatman boasting his knowledge of Africa, where
he had peddled unspecified wares also in Bulawayo. He told us that
the Greek for prickly pear, which we saw growing on the shore, was
"Frankish fig"&mdash;a poor compliment to the other side of our
continent. Arrived, we disembarked at a little quay, to be greeted
by a monk of immeasurable girth, who ushered us to his house and
fed us with grapes taut and sweet as himself. These we ate upon the
verandah over which they grew, perched on struts above the water
like a Samoan village in an instructional film. The heat was
intense. Anxious to forget the climb that lay ahead, we sat in
motionless content beneath the vine. And our host was enquiring
after the others in whose company I had first met him, when a fleet
of mules clattered past a door visible at the other end of the
passage. He hailed them. And, loth to lose this chance of a ride,
we gained the muleteer's approval with a present of cigarettes, and
mounted. Our luggage remained below.</p>

<p>To portray a building whose dissimilarity from its fellows on
this globe robs metaphor of its natural function is best left to
other means than words. Yet, in the case of this building, the
action of its changing aspects is invisible to the stationary
beholder. A film might suffice. Unfortunately, this is a book.</p>

<p>Approaching, hypothetically winged, from the southern point of
Longos, there is disclosed, as the promontory resolves into detail,
a plain white mark high upon the ridge. Other patches, scattered
along the shore, proclaim by their innumerable roofs and walls
other monasteries: Gregoriou, Russico, Docheiariou. This, on
proximity, consists, unlike them, of three tall blocks, towering
backward on a crag, white against a mountain slope half as high
again as the distance beneath. Their brilliance is accented by a
deep shadow, cast westwards in the morning light from wall and rock
alike. Far below, at the water's edge, a tower and house, white
specks, denote the monastery's port.</p>

<p>The hills close round, shutting out the summit, and the other
valleys and other monasteries, till they form a shallow bay. The
tower at the edge reveals a new dignity in reflection. Above, the
building, risen, now that we are underneath, to the skyline,
thrusts its triple clump aloft, each incredible fa&ccedil;ade
exaggerating its own perspective to the call of some invisible
scene-shifter behind the imminent caerulian canvas. Trenched inward
from the contour of the bay and the spreading hills, a wooded
ravine of perpetual shadow rises perpendicular some 900 feet.
Until, from its womb, leaps to the light a pedestal of twisted,
golden rock; and from it, gathering to itself the shadowed,
shrub-grown ledges, Simopetra, the monastery, "Rock of Simon."</p>

<p>The path, topping the tower, twists up one side of the
indentation, among precarious olive-groves. At first the building
is invisible; until, upon a corner, it reappears, expanded,
astounding. With every zigzag of the road it swells; new planes
revealed, new lines composed. For the three blocks, each built back
one behind the other as the rock demands, are not set square. The
middle meets the foremost at a greater than a right-angle, the
hinder the middle at a lesser. From no two positions, therefore, is
the building consistent with its former self. As the blocks rise,
unadorned save for the encircling stripes of wooden balconies, they
narrow. Or, more accurately, the foundations diverge, that of the
most prominent resting on a gigantic buttress sloping down the rock
to a terraced foothold. And below it, from the curving beds of
beans and tomatoes hanging nervously fifteen feet above each other,
dark cypresses also engage in the festivity of line, urge up and
on, till the human eye, unused to these dynamic harmonies, must
slip its socket. With their perpetual variation and impatience of
gravity, the three striped torsos resemble a group of footballers
in that instant before the ball descends. Thus, petrified in
colour, feet hidden in the cleft, knees of golden rock, white linen
shorts and striped jerseys, they stand everlasting.</p>

<p>And the ball does not descend.</p>

<p>We dismounted at the long, upward-sloping tunnel that gives
entrance to the monastery. And, reaching a courtyard, picked our
way to the guest quarters along a balcony disclosing broad fissures
of eternity between its creaking boards. The guest-master said that
lunch would be ready in an hour. David lay down to read. Mark and I
launched into the heat.</p>

<p>He walked up to the back to sketch. I, casting about for a
vantage-point that might admit a level camera, noticed a platform
of rock forty feet immediately above my head. Descending to a small
chapel on the left of the path, which contained in its crypt the
skulls of deceased fathers disinterred after three years and neatly
docketed on shelves, I leapt down a bank of marrows; and, rounding
a corner, came upon a gully that seemed to lead whither I had
hoped. The ascent at first was easy: a mere creeping underneath the
roots of bushes. But suddenly it took a right-angle&mdash;not to
one side or the other, but in point of gradient. Perpendicular, it
was not a gully, but a pipe. The sun was at its highest; the shaft
in which I was imprisoned airless. All the view was the sea,
awaiting the corpse that should come hurtling to its bosom. The
stream, dry since May, trickled again, but red from lacerated
flesh. Movement became fainter and fainter. Had not the sky
reappeared, I should have remembered no more. Writhing like an
Iroquois after a scalp upon the pinnacle of my desire, I poised the
camera. Behold the result. And weep my life's blood.</p>

<p>Lunch, despite a protracted benediction, was welcome. Finished,
we set out again, walking this time in the other direction, where
the monastery is joined to the hill by a double-tiered aqueduct.
From here its aspect changes. The pedestal of rock rises at the
back of the monastery to within three stories of the roof, instead
of, if the foundation walls of the front were windowed,
approximately twenty. The domes of the church within the courtyard
are visible. And the whole assumes an air of fantasy, like a
Rhineland castle perched at the brink of an unscaleable crag, but
made safe by the net of stone that hooks it to the hill behind.
Below the scenic-railway entrance, the shadowy outline of ironbound
double doors was visible, leading into the bowels of the rock. Our
curiosity was aroused. But their objective remained an enigma. It
was presumably an older entrance, dating from before that ghastly
fire, still recorded, when the entrapped monks could only hurl
themselves down the precipices of the front to escape the flames.
This was in 1625. A sketch of the building as it later appeared was
appended by Robert Curzon to his <i>Monasteries of the Levant</i>,
published in 1849. But, as the foreground of this is entirely
imaginary, it is impossible to rely on the accuracy of his
depiction. He makes it more whimsical in form than appears to-day,
like a windmill on the scale of the Eiffel Tower. The present group
dates from another fire of 1893, thus carrying the climax of
Byzantine domestic architecture to the birthday of the twentieth
century. For the monks built and designed unaided.</p>

<p>Those who have lived in Athens, and lunched, as Athens does, at
Costi's, will recall the lovely Madame Kogevinas. Her husband, an
artist, is the author of an etching which shows Simopetra from a
peculiar angle, rising its most precipitous into the sky. This view
I also had in mind to see. Searching the landscape for whence it
might be possible, I espied a small brown patch among the trees on
the farther side of the ravine. It was necessary to approach from
the back. On a bridge over which the path was carried stood a
number of mules, who double their near hind-legs in readiness for
my ribs. But, alarmed at the unfamiliar imprecations which greeted
this movement, they thought better and galloped off into the
mountains. Their master, hearing the noise, emerged upon a balcony
to vent his anger upon both them and me.</p>

<p>By means of a track scarcely a foot wide, coated with dry
slippery leaves and tunnelling among the undergrowth at an angle
that necessitated sitting, the brown patch was reached. And
perseverance was rewarded. Far above, a huge tilted box, creamy
gold, and striped with the shadowed silver of oaken struts and
planks, was rocketed into the blazing turquoise sky. It lived; like
the flowers of the mystic, it sang; insensate; irresistible;
inexplicable.</p>

<p>Seated on a rock, I sketched. My pencil, prone to be romantic,
fled over the page in ecstasy, exaggerating the tone of the sky to
the ferocity of a thunderstorm. But the others were waiting. The
progress of the ascent, owing to my sandals slipping two paces for
every one they took, was dependent on the arms. The heat was
insupportable; the handkerchief that might have solaced, plucked
from its pocket by the barbed vegetation; and the last thorn added
to my crown when I was confronted, after twenty minutes' climb, by
an impregnable cliff. Returning to the bottom, I found another
track. My mouth was so parched that, on entering the guest-room, it
would not utter, and the others feared for my reason.</p>

<p>Bidding the guest-master good-bye, we started the descent to the
sea. It was my misfortune, when at school, to suffer from weakness
of the ankles: a welcome safeguard against compulsory athletics;
but one which jeopardised the hopes entertained by my house of my
winning cups for its dining-room table&mdash;which I never did.
Massage, therefore, was the remedy, applied by the Misses Dempster,
ladies of frightening intelligence, who would invite me to consider
the claim of a landscape "permeated," as they said, "with spires,"
to superiority over one which was not; or to analyse the
composition of the uneasiest of Sargent's charcoal portraits,
reproduced and presented them by Lord Spencer. Their house, indeed,
was an illustrated Debrett, comparable only to the portraits of the
<i>Almanach de Gotha</i> displayed on the walls of Madame Sacher's
bar in Vienna. Massage finished, the ankles were tightly bound,
and, thus reinforced, would gradually regain their strength. The
morning of our visit to Simopetra, the muscles, long quiescent, had
uttered a minatory twinge. Unwinding from a chintz bag some lengths
of bandage provided by a parent who had envisaged the dangers of
glacier and crevasse, I performed the remembered operations. But in
vain. And now, emerging from the monastery, I could scarcely walk.
Nor were there mules.</p>

<p>The debility arising, as in the case of running-shoes, from my
sandals having no heels, relief was only gained by remaining poised
on the toes. Thus I set off, hopping from rock to rock like an
inebriate ballerina. But the pace, in such heat, was not to be
borne. And, the feet being comfortable in any position but their
natural, I turned and went backward. Physically this was
perfection; but the mental strain, owing to the precipitous twists
of the path, was insupportable. Eventually I fell on David's arm
and dragged behind him like a rag doll. We reached the shore; and,
despite the presence of a small sword-fish, flung ourselves from
the jetty. To tired, hot, and aching bodies never was bathe so
delicious. Eyes shut; rocking on the ripples of a breeze, shaking
the water to drink the fullness of its cold; eardrums vibrating to
its tinny throbbing; we lay entranced, almost asleep; confronted,
when the eyes opened, by the wide doors of the boat-house at the
head of a causeway of logs; the monk's house, balconied and
vine-shaded; the white arsenal tower; the hills around, full of
large shadows; the black gulch; and at the top, alight with the
sun, the great building, falling back into the sky, ready to kick
its foundations down the trees and crush us in the water at the
foot.</p>

<p>The fat monk opened his spare room to our toilet&mdash;a sunny
apartment, and for that purpose chosen to contain a string of
drying haddocks in the smell of which, festooned with blue-bottles,
lay the secret of many of our meals. After an hour's journey in a
boat, during which we slept, we arrived at Daphni.</p>

<p>There, while the boatman waited, we hurried ashore, excited at
regaining this Sybaris of luxury. But our feelings were damped by
the discovery that we could obtain neither a glass of beer nor a
clean pocket handkerchief. A box of plates, and a kit-bag hitherto
filled with food and unused films, were deposited with the
shopkeeper. With a dozen fresh tins of sardines in our saddle-bags,
we again set sail&mdash;this time literally, as a breeze had
risen.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, striking hidden fire in the purple hills.
While the water, as if in protest, turned a shivering glass-green.
Schooners, vermilion and orange, lay at anchor. Another in full
sail rode by, with a red gold on its bellying canvas. Then the wind
dropped, and we took to the oars again. The sun was gone, and the
twilight deepening, before the barracks of the Russian monastery of
St. Panteleimon loomed above us.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch11"></a>Chapter XI. WHITE RUSSIANS</h2>

<p>The jetty was desolate, the night imminent, and the monastery
gate a quarter of a mile away. Leaving Mark, David, boatman, and
luggage a black heap on the farther side of the large artificial
harbour, I set off to find it. Coarse, booted figures, rolling
downward, stared. At the entrance was a group who spoke Greek. One
of them led me over a tree-dotted space to a large detached block.
Here we descended to a passage below ground, stone-flagged, without
end. And hither, in response to calls delivered down yet deeper
stairs, came the guest-master.</p>

<p>The environment was now as Slav as it had formerly been Greek.
The fineness, the delicacy of Hellenism had given place to
something more remote, less coherent. Flat-nosed Mongols and giant
blonds passed by, <i>"shck"</i> and <i>"kck"</i> issuing from their
lips in place of the familiar liquids. The figures, high wrinkled
boots creaking beneath their cassocks, seemed either to lurch,
hurling their bodies in movement above legs astride; or else to
drag themselves along with a kind of abysmal inertia, each step
falling deeper into the slough of their own inactivity. Of the
latter was the guest-master, tall and bent as a poplar in the wind,
with soft white moustaches floating from his nostrils above a
spreading beard. His eyes gazed beadily into another universe. His
hands, hanging as though on strings from the forward arch of his
shoulders, could not cease their wringing.</p>

<p>Our luggage? On the quay? At this hour? Out of a boat? In the
dark? Characters of Chekhov, Turgeniev, Dostoievsky! the whole
gamut of their joint procrastination, the indecision that has
wrecked half two continents, fought my appeals. We argued. When
down the passage came a crowd of boys, sailors and scouts on a
visit from Salonica; and, surging round, must needs put in practice
the English lessons of their schoolrooms. My knowledge of Greek is
by no means complete. But to be assisted in conversation by persons
who know neither my language nor that of him addressed, reduces me
to a mental disorder which precludes even sound, far from words,
leaving my mouth. It was now quite dark. Bending with the volume of
noise, eyes ahead of time itself, the monk maintained a despairing
obstinacy. But the ring of boys suddenly parted; and there appeared
Mark, David, and the boatman, bearing the first instalment of the
luggage.</p>

<p>So vast a problem settled, the weight of Atlas suspended from
his shoulders, the guest-master brightened, his eyes came to earth,
and to the question of food he affirmed hope. David, meanwhile,
having lately affianced himself to a lovely refugee whose tales of
escape have long whitened the roots of all our hairs, bethought
himself of her tongue.</p>

<p><i>"Me otchen golodny ee oustali Otietz. Skoro li boudet
obied?"</i>
</p>

<p>An ecstasy lit the dim departing face.</p>

<p><i>"On seitchass boudet gotov."</i>
</p>

<p><i>"Ato horoscho. A gdie nam mojno spat?"</i>
</p>

<p>Of his best we should have, rooms and food. Keys jangled, doors
flew open. And David, wheedling his three dozen words into choking
permutations, obtained for us three separate rooms, large and airy,
supplied each with a green-shaded reading-lamp, and hung with a
variety of pictures: oleographs of bloom-spattered grapes
surrounding apples peeled to the waist; ghastly scenes of wolves
tushing at sledge-borne damsels, snowflakes flying, moons caught up
in firs behind, drivers peppering their horses' hindquarters with
blunderbusses; and everywhere the interminable Russian royalties;
the Empress Marie, chignon and throat dripping pearls; Alexander II
saved from an exploded train, surrounded by small daughters in
buttoned boots against a background of telescoped rolling-stock,
Cossacks foraging in the wreckage for the malefactors, the Virgin
and other celestial beings making their bow in the sky to the
invisible public, grateful for their timely intervention; and
finally, last victims of a throne that from time immemorial has
crushed "average men," the sad-lipped Alexandra Feodorovna, radiant
even through these crude colours, and her husband Nicolas II.
Chekhov, Turgeniev, Dostoievsky: their characters have made history
as well as novels. Russia...a cherry orchard.</p>

<p>We went to bed early. I was too tired to sleep. The Elinor
Glyns, Cupid's Baedekers of the Edwardian errant, were finished.
And I had perforce to blow out the light and lie awake, ankles
throbbing; the white faces and mountain paths of Simopetra stabbing
out of the darkness; from the passage the noise of boy-scout good
nights like the faint echo of a swimming-bath; and outside the
windows the sea, arriving and receding with that just sufficient
effort to whisper in the shingle of days and nights ahead, unbroken
in the calm that now possessed it.</p>

<p>Next morning, in prospect of a day of idleness, we slept long
and late. It was nine o'clock, and we were drinking tea in pyjamas,
when the door opened with a jerk, to disclose the jovial bowing
form of Father Mitrophanes, the abbot's secretary.</p>

<p>Last year, having arrived at a more reasonable hour, we had
slept within the actual precincts of the monastery. Our dinner had
consisted mainly of bortsch and tea. But what it lacked in
substance was compensated in spirit by the company of Father
Mitrophanes. Speaking fluent and witty French; an old stuff cap
squashed like an inverted castle pudding on one ear; the fine
strands of his beard falling to a paunch as broad as his smile;
cheeks like door-knobs; his whole sparkling being cried query to
his vocation. But, despite the evident joy of life, there were
clouds.</p>

<p>"We get letters and newspapers from Russia. But there are no
visitors, no pilgrims. We cannot return to our own country.
Everywhere are financial difficulties. Our property in Russia is
confiscated. Similarly our estates in Greece. On that point we
appealed to Lord Curzon in 1923.[*] But it had no effect."</p>

<blockquote>[* A second appeal was forwarded to the League of
Nations in 1928, to which the Greek Government replied with a
definite promise of compensation. The appeal also contained a claim
for war damages to the value of &pound;285,626 4s. on account of
the billeting of Greek troops and the requisitions of both German
and Allied forces.]</blockquote>

<p>Had Mitrophanes read what that acute political observer wrote of
the Russian monastery after a visit to the Mountain in 1891 he
would not have been surprised.</p>

<p>"Not even the dainties...with which we were regaled could blind
our eyes to the character of the whole institution; and, in taking
leave of it, I could not help wondering whether the Russian
monastery might not be heard of again in the drama of European
statecraft." As usual, Lord Curzon was right.</p>

<p>"To think," Mitrophanes continued, "what has happened in the
last ten years. Rasputin, you know, stayed here in 1913."</p>

<p>"He was remarkable to look at, was he not?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, a man of very ordinary appearance!"</p>

<p>He entertained us till ten o'clock, when he rose and rolled
vigorously from the room.</p>

<p>And now here he was again. Leaping from my bed, I introduced
Mark and David. After much conversation, he departed in a whirlwind
of bows. And we had resumed our breakfast when there entered Father
Valentine.</p>

<p>A greater contrast to his precursor could not be imagined. Still
young, his face remains indelible in the memory of one who has seen
it. Of a waxen, ivory complexion; moulded in unearthly perfection,
nose and mouth Praxitelean in their straight drop and double curve;
framed, chin and cheeks, in silken chestnut ringlets; surmounted by
a black cap set sideways in jaunty reminiscence of the past;
emitting gentle faultless English, soft and musical, yet inhumanly
devoid of either expression or cadence&mdash;his whole demeanour
was so interwoven with tragedy that his presence was an event, a
phenomenon. There was a wall between him and other human beings;
the ordinary pleasantries of intercourse were too petty. His manner
was that of a servant; his personality of one born to rule. Faint
terror consumed me at this second meeting. But it seemed to me that
Father Valentine had become, with this his second year in the
monastery, in the faintest degree more reconciled to his lot.</p>

<p>He had arrived, he said, to show us round. We attracted his
notice to our pyjamas. He therefore sat down on a bench outside.
And we, knowing that no more nails could be added to his cross,
shaved out of the tea-pot.</p>

<p>The buildings of Russico, as the Russian monastery is known, are
enormous, modern, and wholly out of harmony with their environment.
Tier upon tier of windows rise at the back of the courtyard above
the church, with its green domes surmounted by gold balls and wired
crosses lit with chunks of stained glass. To one side is the
campanile, where gigantic bells, taller than a man, are seen
hanging from its lower stages. And behind it is the refectory, big
as Westminster Hall and slavered with the frescoings of a
nineteenth century Perugino. By the entrance-porch the buildings
are smaller, covered with wistaria and corniced with traditionally
Athonite balconies. But it is outside that the horror is revealed.
Block after block of huge tenements that would disfigure a
Clydeside slum, balconies rusting, windows broken, stretch down to
the sea, six or seven stories high. There, a harbour, formed by an
L-shaped mole for the reception of steamers, embraces two
fishing-boats. Over all, more squalid than romantic, broods an air
of disuse. For the monastery once contained close on 1,500 monks.
Now there are 600. There used to come yearly, ship-loads of
pilgrims on their way to or from Jerusalem. Now there come
none.</p>

<p>There is pathos, almost tragedy, in this deflation, in this
remnant of a once overflowing community debarred from country and
traditions&mdash;an outpost of old Russia in the Aegean. And there
is also history, wherein the fate of the Holy Mountain, sanctuary
inviolate of Byzantinism, wavered in the balance as it had not
since the Latin conquest of the thirteenth century. It was computed
in 1903 that the aggregate of Slav monks on the Mountain, Russian,
Rumanian, Bulgar, Serb, and Georgian, already numbered 4,156, as
opposed to 3,276 counted by the Greeks. This showed a preponderance
of nearly 1,000. And even earlier, in 1901, Professor Charles
Diehl, experienced student of the Near East, committed himself to
the following prophecy:[*]</p>

<blockquote>[* <i>En M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e.</i>]</blockquote>

<p>"The Hellenic element resists these encroachments with all the
strength of its acquired rights, its ancient traditions, and the
numerical superiority which it still possesses. None the less, it
is possible to foresee what must henceforth be the outcome of this
unequal contest. On their side the Russians have industry, energy,
money, and perhaps, also, intellectual superiority; in the end they
will have numbers. Thus, in the long run, despite the resistance of
despair, the defeat of the Greeks is inevitable. And the day will
come when to them also shall be said, as in Moli&egrave;re: <i>'La
maison est &agrave; moi; c'est &agrave; vous d'en sortir</i>.'"</p>

<p>These prognostics of the days when Russia was an active
participant in the concert of the Powers, and a Turkish
deputy-governor dreamed of his harem in Caryes, have not been
fulfilled. Nor will they be. But the whole latter history of the
Mountain, and the whole tenor of its present status, have been so
largely the result of the Russian <i>Drang nach S&uuml;den</i> in
the Levant, that the tale is worth telling.</p>

<p>From the twelfth century there has always existed on Athos a
monastery ascribed either in fact or politeness to the Russians.
After various vicissitudes, its numbers, at the beginning of the
eighteenth century, were reduced to four. Re-endowed a century
later by a family of Greek Phanariots, it was inhabited, after a
period of abandonment during the Revolution, by Greeks alone. But
in 1834, being heavily in debt, it accepted the entrance-fees of
fifteen Russian probationers, who, wishing to enter the Athonite
community, not unnaturally chose the convent which tradition
assigned their nation. These attracted others; the whole of the
outstanding debts were paid by them; and large new buildings
erected for the reception of yet further compatriots. At length
they found themselves in a numerical majority, and claimed on that
ground the rights, first of reading the services on alternate days
in Russian, then of electing their own abbot. The latter demand
gave rise to bitter dissensions, in which the Holy Synod in Caryes
supported the Greeks. But they were overborne by the Patriarch
Joachim II, who, in return for substantial presents from St.
Petersburg, threatened them with eternal flames unless they acceded
to the Russian wishes.</p>

<p>Then followed the Russo-Turkish War. The Treaty of St. Stefano,
concluded in 1878 behind the backs of the Powers, contained the
following passage: "The monks of Mount Athos of Russian origin
shall be maintained in their former possessions and hermitages, and
shall continue to enjoy...the same rights and prerogatives as those
assured to the other religious establishments and convents of Mount
Athos." Thus the Sultan, the lay suzerain of the Mountain,
recognised the existence of exclusively Russian communities. But
the suspicions of the Powers had been aroused by the closing of the
Black Sea, and a general war was only averted by the conference and
Treaty of Berlin at the end of the year. Article 62 ran as follows:
"The monks of Mount Athos, <i>whatever</i> their country of origin,
shall be maintained in their former possessions and advantages, and
shall enjoy, <i>without any exception</i>, complete equality, of
rights and privileges." The guarantee of the Russian status, with
modified emphasis, was retained. But, infinitely more far-reaching,
there resulted from the jealousy of the Powers the recognition in
the most important international treaty since that of Vienna, of
the autonomy of the entire Mountain. "Former possessions and
advantages." By these vague words, ratifying at one sealing the
heterogeneous precedents of nine centuries, the preservation of
Athos as a theocracy, an independent political organism on the face
of Europe, was assured.</p>

<p>Encouraged by their foothold on what now was
virtually&mdash;and, in Russian hands, would be actually&mdash;an
Aegean government immune from Ottoman interference, the Russians
purchased the leases of two <i>skitai</i> and twenty <i>kellia</i>,
separate communities, but fortunately the inalienable property of
the Ruling Monasteries. The buildings that existed were replaced by
new ones, which disfigure the Mountain with their garish
semi-oriental domes, and have often been enlarged to twice or three
times the size of the parent monastery. Thus at the beginning of
the century, out of the 548 monks attached to the poor Greek
monastery of Pantocrator, 435 were Russian, resident for the most
part in the <i>skiti</i> of the Prophet Elias, one of the two which
they had purchased. In every case, the rules which limited the
enlargement of these dependencies were circumvented. And matters
were complicated by the inevitable willingness of the poorer
monasteries to raise such money as they could by the sale of
deserted religious sites.</p>

<p>The Russians now hoped, by argument of numbers, to promote these
inflated offspring to the status of Ruling Monasteries, and thus to
add other representatives to swell their meagre vote in the Synod
at Caryes. Thus eventually might they obtain a majority and a
ruling voice in an Aegean Government whose integrity was guaranteed
by international treaty. But in place of the venal Patriarch
Joachim II was now Joachim III the Magnificent, whose purpose it
was to combat the foreign menace. Not only did he resist all
advances of the Russians; but addressed himself to the work of
tabulating and revising the confused unwritten tradition of
Athonite law. From the constitution which finally took shape, and
which has been examined in Chapter III, one clause emerges with
significant clarity. Any addition to the twenty Ruling Monasteries,
seventeen Greek and three foreign, which already exist, is
absolutely and ultimately forbidden.</p>

<p>But events of even greater moment were at hand. Two years after
the original draft of the present constitution was published, the
Balkan War broke out. Constantine occupied Salonica. And on
November 2nd, 1912, after an interval of more than four and a half
centuries, the Holy Mountain was delivered of the Moslem thrall. A
Frenchman who arrived at Caryes to present his credentials towards
the end of October, has left us an account of these incomparable
days:[*]</p>

<blockquote>[* Jerome et Jean Tharaud: <i>La bataille &agrave;
Scutari</i>.]</blockquote>

<p>"This evening a feverish impatience stirs this chorus of old
men. The Greek army is at Salonica! The naval squadron here in the
neighbourhood! Did I notice in coming the battleships of
Condouriotis? Will they call soon at Athos? Is it to-day,
to-morrow, that the imprisoned Mountain shall at last be
delivered?"</p>

<p>Leaving the Synod, he proceeds to the Turkish <i>Kaimakam,</i>
who states the opposite case. "Look around you," he says. "Look at
these thousands of monks; visit their monasteries, question them
yourself. Of what, in reality, can they complain? Have we touched
their rules? Have we violated their property? Have we forbidden
their pilgramages? Have we altered even a tittle of their secular
constitution?...Always the West is talking of Turkish fanaticism.
But what race, I ask you, what conqueror could have treated these
people with greater humanity, greater moderation, greater religious
tolerance? Under our law they have remained as free, even freer,
than under the Byzantine emperors. And...they have not had to
endure under our domination a hundredth part of the vexations that
you have imposed on your monks in France...They will regret us,
monsieur."</p>

<p>The moment of liberation overtakes the writer at the Lavra. He
is "brutally awakened by an unexpected uproar of shouts,
explosions, and hurrying feet. In the courtyard crowds of monks are
running about between the cypresses...dragging ladders which they
lean against the walls. Many are already on top, upright between
the battlements, as though in the days when pirates were visible on
the horizon.</p>

<p>"...It is nine in the morning. Down below, on the glittering
sea, four battleships, four black dots, advance: the fleet of the
Condouriotis! The monks embrace one another, cry for joy, intone
chants, discharge old guns into the air. The Greek flag, white and
blue...flies from the top of the highest tower. All is radiant,
magnificent; the cupolas, the golden crosses, sparkle as though to
make welcome these harbingers of victory.</p>

<p>"The events of that day," continues the traveller, recounting
them as told him immediately afterwards, "...must have constituted
the simplest military operation of the whole war. The cruiser
<i>Averof</i>, the flagship, and the three torpedo-boats who
accompanied her, cast anchor at Daphni. In sight of the Greek
battleships, the five or six Ottoman officials employed in the
customs and the post-office fled precipitately for refuge to the
Russian monastery of St. Panteleimon. A torpedo-boat, stationed in
front of the monastery, sent a request to the abbot to surrender
the fugitives. This, after some discussion, was done. Meanwhile 70
men had disembarked, and, having hoisted the blue and white flag
over the customs-house and the post-office, set off for
Caryes...The unfortunate <i>kaimakam</i> was arrested on his
divan."</p>

<p>The narrative proceeds at length: tells of the arrival of the
soldiers and the banquets given in their honour; of the whole
Mountain enveloped in the distant echoing of bells; of the news of
fresh successes on the part of the Balkan allies; and then of the
dissensions that were springing up between them. On Athos these are
reflected: "Everywhere...a great inquietude has given place to joy.
The bells have ceased to peal...What will happen to the Mountain,
now that it is free? Will it be reunited to Greece, as the Greek
monasteries demand? Or, in accordance with the wishes of the Slavs,
will it remain independent under the control of the Orthodox
peoples?"</p>

<p>Thus in jubilation and anxiety the Turkish rule was ended. The
Holy Mountain was once more under Christian governance. But the
question was now: under which?</p>

<p>On February 6th, 1913, it was reported in <i>The Times</i> that
the Russian Foreign Office had requested "that Greece should not
proceed with the substitution of Hellenic authorities for the
pre-existing administration." It proposed, alternatively, that
Athos should be governed by an international commission, composed
of the representatives of all the Orthodox states&mdash;among which
Russia must inevitably preponderate. The scheme was countered by
the claim of Austria-Hungary to inclusion, as ruling over the
Serbian Orthodox Patriarchate of Carlovitz. And was further
complicated by the insistence of the Greeks themselves, voiced by
Meletios Metaxarchis, the present Patriarch of Alexandria, that
Great Britain should be represented, as possessing jurisdiction
over the autocephalous Church of Cyprus. A wholly negative
agreement was reached at the Treaty of London in 1913, Article 5 of
which confided "<i>le soin de statuer sur le sort...de la peninsule
de Mont Athos"</i> to the five Powers; as though, with every other
point of dispute in that diminutive pre-war world, it were not
already in their keeping. Thus the issues were skilfully avoided;
save that, temporarily at least, the threatened domination of the
Russians was averted.</p>

<p>This was in May. The second Balkan War was to come. Meanwhile
the interest still evinced by Russia in this, the most holy place
after Jerusalem within the confines of the Eastern Church, was
further aroused by a heresy which threatened to deprive the
Russians of their strongest claim to predominance on the
Mountain&mdash;that of Orthodoxy. A monk named Antony Boulatovitch,
formerly a Hussars officer, and now in the <i>skiti</i> of St.
Andrew at Caryes, had experienced a religious ecstasy on
discovering that, on the authority of many of the fathers, "the
name of God, being part of God, is in itself divine." His joy was
communicated to his companions. And, on hearing that the Archbishop
Antony of Volinsk had denounced the doctrine which entranced their
souls, they appealed for justification to their abbots and
<i>epitropoi.</i> These refusing to support them, they elected
others. But the first resisted, and in both monastery and
<i>skiti</i> the Russian monks came to blows. The heretics, at
first besieged and deprived of food, were eventually victorious.
And the Russian Government, with the approval of the Holy Synod of
Moscow, sought leave of the Patriarch of Constantinople to quell
the infringement of dogma by force. This was granted. Troops were
landed on June 24th, 1913.</p>

<p>There came also a special delegate of the Moscow Synod, the
Archbishop Nikon. Unannounced, he disembarked at Russico, and,
hurrying to the church, delivered a sermon which the monks
disdained by walking out in the middle. To the <i>skiti</i> of St.
Andrew he was refused admission altogether.</p>

<p>On July 15th matters came to a head. The Archbishop, wishing to
conduct the liturgy, was refused the keys to the monastery's
vestments. The doors, therefore, were broken open by the troops.
The fathers, retiring into the woods, stoned them. And they, in
reply, opened fire in the dark. As a sequel, 616 heretical monks
were deported, the majority seeking voluntary exile on the shores
of the Yellow Sea. The Holy Synod of Moscow admitted officially
that 24 had been wounded in the disturbances, and threw a curious
light on the ranks whence the Russian monks on the Mountain were
recruited by stating that "40 with criminal pasts had been
imprisoned at Odessa." The abbot of Russico telegraphed his thanks
to the Tsar, who replied wishing the monastery "peace, prosperity,
and piety." And the Greeks, having heard the gun-fire, now
considered the Russians not only overweening, but disturbers of
peace and suspect of faith into the bargain. Grisly rumours,
harking back to the embarkation of monastic reservists in the
Russo-Japanese War&mdash;an incident which in itself gave colour to
them&mdash;continued to encircle the Near East. The buildings were
barracks, the monks an army. Munitions lay hid. And all the newly
transformed <i>skitai</i> and <i>kellia</i> commanded the strategic
points of the Mountain.</p>

<p>A year passed. And then these petty convulsions were engulfed in
a larger. The intended dispositions of the five Powers lapsed into
oblivion. And the Mountain remained to all intents and purposes
identified with Greece. Four years later that beneficent comity
deputed to assign its fate was reduced to two. And by one of the
clauses of the Treaty of S&egrave;vres, which was afterwards
ratified at Lausanne in 1923, the sovereignty of the Hellenic state
was recognised, and the following assurance given:</p>

<p><i>"La Gr&egrave;ce s'engage &agrave; reconna&icirc;tre et
maintenir les droits traditionels et les libert&eacute;s dont
jouissent les communaut&eacute;s monastiques non grecques du Mont
Athos d'apr&egrave;s les dispositions de l'article 62 du
Trait&eacute; de Berlin du Juillet 13, 1878"</i>&mdash;Article 62
of the Treaty of Berlin, which invokes unspecified the precedents
of nine centuries. Thus the inviolability of the foreign
monasteries is guaranteed. But in view of the assertions that have
persisted in the English Press that the Greek Government has
decided to close the Mountain to monastic recruits of Greek
nationality, and thus presumably resign it to the Slavs whose
position is impregnable, the student of political curiosities may
refer to Articles 106 to 109 of the Hellenic constitution. There,
with rigid emphasis, locked in the keystone of the state, the
autonomy of the Mountain and the inalienability of its soil from
the twenty Ruling Monasteries are ensured for all time on as firm a
basis as words can build. In reply to the suggestion that it would
be an act of friendship on the part of the Greek Government to
promote the Rumanian <i>skiti</i> to the rank of a Ruling
Monastery, it was stated that:</p>

<p>"Greece is unable to modify the <i>status quo</i> of Mount Athos
either to her own advantage or to that of any other Power. She is
prevented by:</p>

<p>"1. The law of custom hallowed by the centuries.<br>
2. Her treaty obligations.<br>
3. Her own legislation."</p>

<p>The position is settled. And future generations, when
Christianity has passed into history, may still enjoy the spectacle
of a solitary survival secure within the political barriers.
History has been paradoxical. The autonomy of the Mountain was
conserved, while the rest of Europe was robbing the monks of the
last vestiges of temporal power, by the inertia of an infidel
government. And it was brought to the notice of international
guarantee, and thus saved from summary incorporation in the
Hellenic state, by Russian ambition. It has dictated its
constitution to the sovereignty which it admits. And it now remains
the preserve of that splendid yet unearthly beauty which Byzantine
civilisation once carried over all the coasts of the Levant.</p>

<p>But how near and how odious the Russian domination might have
been, was recalled to us by prints of the Mountain upon our bedroom
walls: high roads with carriages, Cossacks marching, bands playing.
The menace is past. Let us return, forgiving, to the chastened
remnant of its contrivers.</p>

<p>Last year, sated with the clattering magnificence of the church,
we had turned with relief to a small chapel beside it, and
discovered therein an old Greek <i>eicon</i> of the Assumption of
the Virgin. Thither now Valentine led us again, and promised to ask
permission for us to photograph it. We then ascended to another
church enclosed high up in the main building among the cells; a
species of enormous room, divided by a row of pillars and still
more ablaze with nineteenth century gilt and lustres than the one
below. On emerging, we encountered a monk six and a half feet high,
with the figure of a drill-sergeant, a cruel, tight-lipped face,
broader in jowl than forehead, and sprouting in opposite directions
two grey, compact points of beard. At the feet of this colossus
Valentine knelt till his head touched the ground. Then asked
permission for the photographing of the <i>eicon.</i> The
deputy-abbot, as this proved, disappeared into a room where, like
the twinkle of a star, we caught a glimpse of Mitrophanes. He
returned with the abbot's assent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the feast of the Assumption was not long past,
and tucked within the framing of the picture was an edging of linen
apple-blossom&mdash;a pretty ornament in itself, with its tinted
buds, but disastrously encroaching. The sacristan of the chapel was
called; hammer and pincers produced; and the whole construction
torn from its pedestal and delivered of the actual panel. The
painting, dating from the seventeenth century, exhibited a richness
and warmth of colour unlike most of its fellows on the Mountain;
where, being on chestnut wood, we presumed it to have been painted.
There was an unfamiliar sympathy also in the figures. But, like
that of Gregoriou, it was entirely devoid of contemporary Italian
facility, and lacked none of the decorative Byzantine formalism:
the sky patterned with gold florescent asterisks; Christ erect in
an aura of elliptical refulgence; and the inevitable insistence on
detailed light rather than shadow.</p>

<p>The exposures completed, we lunched with Valentine in a
miniature guest-refectory. Desperate with the hammerings of Mark's
curiosity, he vouchsafed a word of information. In this monastery,
he said, the abbot, though advised by the deputy-abbot and a
council of elders, ruled with the power of an autocrat. On arrival
each monk was apportioned certain work; at first something unsuited
to his abilities, which should act as a test of character.
Valentine, we felt sure from his more content demeanour, was
engaged on something less uncongenial than formerly. It seemed
silly that a man of his education should perform menial offices.
One day perhaps he will be abbot. And one day we shall return to
discover the story of his life. We were told at one of the other
monasteries that he had escaped from the Crimea with Wrangel's
army.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we visited the monastery shop, where a confused
array of pre-war souvenirs for pilgrims lay ranged on long
counters: <i>eicons,</i> Bibles, spoons, postcards, strings of
beads, and every blend of sacred oleograph. We discovered some
quires of writing-paper, damp with age, and bearing, in lieu of an
address, a representation of the Mountain rising like an emerald
cone from the sea, with all the monasteries depicted as red-roofed
German villas. With these we eventually succeeded in so astonishing
the importunate tradesmen of the mother country, that many,
believing we had forsaken both home and sanity for ever, ceased
their clamour for months to come.</p>

<p>At four o'clock we climbed to the upper church for the afternoon
service. The air was hot and sleepy; sheets of sunlight struck the
polished wooden floor and glittered over the jungles of golden
ornament. The singing, full of tragic harmonies unmodified to the
western ear like those of the choir in the Buckingham Palace Road,
played on the emotions as nothing can. Last year it had been more
impressive still. We had risen in the dark. The gloom of the
shadowy, candle-lit church was accentuated by the livid tapping of
the dawn without. Four men sang. Unaccompanied, in tones of
unfathomable sadness, they seemed to echo in exile the memory of a
life always sad, now extinguished.</p>

<p>During dinner, at which the guest-master descended from the
twilight of his imaginings to exhale a gentle mirth at our request
for more soup, the last night's boatman, hired for the purpose,
arrived with letters. Several of the batch were addressed to others
than ourselves. But as they had been rotting in the post-office for
most of the century, they were included on chance. One bore the
superscription of a Turkish lady. What ghastly clue it held to the
Mountain's previous violation we could only guess.</p>

<p>There is something grotesque, almost alarming, in the
combinations of letters that find their way to remote places. There
transpired now a night-club circular; a bill for writing-paper
stamped with Mrs. Byrne's address; a telegram from friends in
Venice addressed to "Cairo" instead of Caryes and requesting me to
answer to "Vienna"; an invitation to a wedding in Westminster
Cathedral, enclosing ticket admitting "to railed enclosure"; and a
request to attend the Navarino banquet, to be held in London at the
nominal fee of &pound;1 12s. 6d. a head. To this last I replied
that I should, I hoped, be celebrating the occasion in its native
bay. Events, as it turned out, took us to Crete instead. But we
returned to Athens on the day following the anniversary, to find
the streets gay with bunting and uniformed Codringtons; the English
colony fluttered, because the Minister had left the British
Government's wreath behind; the Minister himself stamping over an
impending dinner-table arranged by an inadvertent secretary to seat
all the guests but those very Codringtons for whom it was being
given; the Legation hushed beneath the noise of stitching medals on
and off dress coats for every new reception; several new issues of
stamps; and the whole diplomatic corps, the Press, the intellectual
leaders, the financial magnates, the Foreign Office, the Ministry
of Marine, and the Parliament, all recovering from the effects of
unwonted celebration on two successive nights. For the Greek
Government had chartered two ships to convey its guests; and with a
hospitality, a largeness of heart, which deserves immortality in
some Treasury of Golden Actions, had ordered all drinks to be
served free at its expense.</p>

<p>"I assure you," old men rumbled at me later, "I haven't touched
more than a single glass of claret for dinner for the last thirty
years. But these naval fellers are so generous, there's no getting
out of it. I thought I'd try a cocktail. And I don't mind admitting
after about five I felt damned odd. It was all I could do to crawl
to a coil of rope..."</p>

<p>One of our friends, who was an attach&eacute; at the Legation,
had purchased, before leaving on this expedition, a game of snakes
and ladders, and one which had been expanded into a landscape beset
with witches and deadly nightshade. A distinguished professor of
theology, the greatest living exponent of the Orthodox view of the
<i>Filioque</i>, had also been of the party. And it was, we were
informed, piteous to behold him, in the guise of Little Snowdrop,
counting up his dice and crashing the life's edifice of his
intellectual prestige upon an encounter with an ogre or a
swallowing of poisoned berries. Obliged to return to the beginning
again, he felt it as though Eastern Christendom had renounced the
Patriarch in favour of the Pope. In our opinion, it would have been
more fitting if in place of these floating gin-palaces and
gambling-hells the occasion had been observed in the spirit of
REMEMBRANCE. But that is because we were not there.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch12"></a>Chapter XII. GARDENIAS AND SWEETPEAS</h2>

<p>Mark and I, anxious to hear the singing again before we left,
were called at four o'clock. We dressed in haste, and were urged by
the guest-master with clucks of agitation across the starlit
courtyard; till we trotted one on either side of him into the upper
church. Each of us put his hat upon the floor. Whereupon from each
side of the nave a venerable father darted forward and placed it in
a stall to itself. Unfortunately the service was almost finished,
and it was plain that the guest-master's flurry had been due to a
sense of guilt in not having wakened us earlier. As we descended
after only twenty minutes, he tried to rectify his mistake by
propelling us toward another candle-lighted doorway. We declined,
and went back to bed.</p>

<p>After a fitful two hours, we rose again, this time at the
instance of David, who, having slept oblivious of his vaunted love
of music, now bounced into the room like a Brobdingnagian lark and
said that he wished to make an early start. While we breakfasted in
pyjamas, off the Daphni sardines, we were conscious of a droning
boom such as a 64-foot organ pipe sends vibrating over a cathedral.
Throbbing and fading, sometimes broken by long intervals, it
resolved at length into a human voice. But by the time David and I
had reached the passage sink to shave, it had ceased. Semi-nude, we
had just balanced the mirror on a nail, when a sound like a funeral
march arranged for Chaliapine began again at our very elbow. Framed
in a doorway stood a monk of indescribable proportions, eyes almost
closed with the good humour of his cheeks, beard tangled as
pre-Raphaelite brambles; and from his shoulders, broken at an angle
on the apex of his paunch, a green and gold brocade stole. In one
hand he carried a cross, in the other a receptacle of holy water
and a bunch of basil. Espying us in the moment that our eyes
lighted on him, he moved upon us with mammoth gait, chanting the
while. He sprinkled our defenceless chests with holy water from the
little green broom. And then, regardless of soap or skin, he
enveloped us each in an overpowering embrace, his whole form
garlanded with Christian love. The sudden horror of his oncoming
was mitigated by the exquisite spectacle of David's shrinking soapy
torso engorged in his black folds. After learning our nationality,
he took his way, voice uplifted. It appeared, upon subsequent
enquiry, that on the first of every month it is the custom in
Orthodox countries for the priest to go the round of the monastery
or village, as the case may be, blessing the cells or houses and
their inmates. To-day, being the fourteenth by our calendar, was
the first by theirs.</p>

<p>At length we were clothed, our homeward letters delivered to
Mitrophanes, the guest-master's hand shaken and rewarded, and
ourselves ensconced in a boat at the quayside. In half an hour we
were moored against the jetty of Xenophontos, a monastery almost on
the water's edge and hidden from Russico by the great inward twist,
three miles across, with which the promontory is here indented.</p>

<p>Willowing over the rough cobbles of the little pier stepped a
thin, bent figure, adorned with a silver nannygoat's beard and
bobbling eyes interrupted by the rim of a pair of pince-nez. This
was Father Damascene, who had been expediting his monastery's
merchandise in a schooner that set sail as we arrived. Eyeing us
with curiosity not unmixed with contempt, he ushered us to the
guest-house, the Russian boatmen following with the luggage. As
when, after a night journey to some outlying part of Greater
Britain, the house of a friend is reached at breakfast-time, so
here we felt something of embarrassment in our morning arrival. But
this was immediately dispelled by the welcome of the guest-master,
a small, untidy monk in an apron, and speaking a little German
which he had learnt as a prisoner of war. As we sat balancing our
coffee-cups, there entered the abbot, the Archimandrite
Akakios&mdash;as a visiting card later informed us was his name and
style. Though of middle height, he was of most distinguished
appearance, having a high forehead and long aquiline nose of clear
white skin; below which was a bold black beard, curling and silken,
where played a smile of that exceptional charm which is only as a
rule found in little children.</p>

<p>The pronounced variation in atmosphere exhaled by each
individual monastery contributes, more than anything else, to the
enchantment of the hospitality which the Holy Mountain extends to
visitors. It is as though, in the days of horse-transport, a round
of great country-houses were in progress, each conducted on the
tradition of centuries. For our impressions were confirmed, not
only by those of last year, but of long previous travellers. Thus
the Lavra resembles a huge rambling palace, enlarged generation by
generation, ill-kempt, but still capable of great splendour; St.
Paul's, on the cleanliness of which Robert Curzon remarked exactly
ninety years ago, a Georgian mansion where the amenities of life
are fully understood; and Dionysiou, the castle of some Draconian
great-aunt, widowed and religious, where meals are punctual and
smoking forbidden in the drawing-room. At this latter, our
experiences have been more than corroborated. Riley speaks of "a
churlish reception"; though this we do not wholly endorse. While
Tozer, who made two visits in the 'sixties, describes the monks on
both occasions as "singularly suspicious and unwilling to show
their treasures," phrases very applicable to their attitude toward
our letters from the Government and our request to see the
Trapezuntine chrysobul. To leave Dionysiou for Gregoriou was to
exchange the great-aunt for her nieces and nephews, with Father
Stephen the centre of their mischief. At Simopatra we did not stay
the night, and Russico lies outside the category. But arrived at
Xenophontos, the charm of environment was accentuated beyond any we
had met. At last we had reached the one house that exists in
everyone's life&mdash;that of an intimate friend and perfect
ease.</p>

<p>This side of Daphni&mdash;that is to say, north-west, since we
have been moving up from the south-east&mdash;the character of the
promontory has changed, the spine of the ridge sunk, and a more
benign air overspread the landscape. Beach, hitherto rare, has
become the general rule; cliff the exception. Separated from the
shingle by terraced vegetable-beds cultivated with that economy and
neatness which connotes the monkish gardener, the bottom wall of
Xenophontos stands an unpretentious creamy yellow, surmounted by
the usual projecting rooms of painted wood. But, from the side
whence we had approached, the crenellated walls of the enclosure
ramble far up the hill to the back, with cypresses and cupolas,
almost Tuscan in their dark and light, projecting from within. Near
the water on that side stands the boat-house, to which huge barred
doors fasten an entrance so shaped that it might, one feels, give
sudden vent to the frescoed and cross-bedizened coaches of the
Athonite tube. Between this building and the foundations of the
garden rises the path to the entrance, embowered with wistaria and
oleanders, the latter a startling pink when viewed against the blue
sea on descent. Once within the gate, the way twists up between
walls of great antiquity, supporting what appear to be, outside
Mistra, some of the very few Byzantine domestic buildings still in
existence. They possess the original windows, double-arched and
supported by a single pillar up the middle.</p>

<p>The air of the courtyard, even though deserted in the midday
heat, was that of an industrious farmyard. Here was revealed to its
fullest that idyllic mode of co-operative living which flourishes
on the Mountain and which Communism seeks to introduce on a larger
scale elsewhere. Repugnant, for personal reasons, as Communism may
be, its idealism is the more easily comprehended after a visit to
Athos. For in the East, unlike the West, the monasteries were
primarily not seats of learning, but exponents of an ideal social
system. Comment on this aspect of Orthodox monasticism has usually
been confined among western writers to negative abuse of the monks'
ignorance. But there is a hint of deeper perception in the extract
from Buondelmonti, at the beginning of the fifteenth century, with
which this book opens. And Belon, writing in 1553 before western
monasticism had received the full onslaught of the Reformation,
pictures the Athonite commonwealth in words as relevant now as
then:</p>

<p><i>"Des six mille religieux que i' ay nommez caloieres, vivants
en la susdicte montaigne, ne pensez pas qu'il en y ait un oyseux,
car s'ilz sortent de leurs monasteres de grand matin, chascun avec
son oustil en la main, portants du biscuit et quelques oignons en
un bissac dessus l'espaulle, l'un une houe, l'autre un pic, l'autre
une serpe. Chascun travaille pour le mesnaige de son monastere. Les
uns beischent les vignes, les autres buschent le bois, les autres
fabriquent les navires. Et ne scauroye en faire meilleure
comparaison que &agrave; la famille d'un prince, mettant une
economie en commun: Car les uns sont cousturiers, les autres
massons, les autres charpentiers, les autres d'autres mestiers,
travaillants tous en commun...C'est une economie, concernante le
profit du monastere: laquelle estant ainsi gouvern&eacute;e, est
grandement differente tant des moeurs que de fa&ccedil;on de vivre
aux monasteres des Latins."</i>
</p>

<p>"Excuse us," said the abbot Akakios, as we descended into the
courtyard to see the church, "that there were no men to fetch your
luggage. But everyone is out picking grapes." Other evidences of
the common husbandry lay about us. At our feet was spread a
dustsheet of figs drying in the sun, purple and brown, and so
delicious in their fragrant heat that the monks were soon wondering
if there would be any left for the winter. Beyond lay other
piles&mdash;figs again, or walnuts&mdash;on which we also fastened.
Upon a kind of wooden staging, erected over a fearsome pool that
trickled beneath arches into the very heart of the buildings, stood
rows of circular pewter trays supported on trestles, and each
covered with a paste of beaten tomatoes. Fleets of mules, each
bearing a pair of tall, conical vats piled with grapes, clattered
in and out beneath the wooden galleries with which the whole of one
face of the building was covered, like some old London inn.
Clothes&mdash;calico underwear and socks of coarse white
wool&mdash;were hanging out to dry, almost to scorch. Odd corners
were stacked with wood&mdash;faggots here, logs there. Against them
leaned other pewter trays not in use. Beyond the big cream-coloured
church a carpenter was working in a recess in the old wall beneath
its upper pathway, covering the ground with his shavings. Later
Mark and I went down to bathe. In the shade of a trellis of vines,
among its own ploughs, sat a grey ox, the ferocity of its pitchfork
horns belied by the blinking suavity of its face. And as we lay in
the water, there arrived upon the beach a herd of long-haired swine
of a dark piebald brown, which gobbled up a pottage thrown them by
a black-robed herdsman with a cough. These, which are peculiar to
the northern monasteries, we supposed to be the progeny of the wild
boars which inhabit the Mountain's forests. Wild we never saw them.
But now and then upon our rides we came upon a solitary monk
carrying a gun.</p>

<p>The morning was young, and David itching to be at his work.
First, however, the abbot must show us the treasures of the new
church, the one we had noticed, a large early nineteenth century
building of the traditional plan. Fortunately it was never
frescoed; and it now presents a cold, dignified interior,
unornamented save for a number of <i>eicons</i>, none more than two
feet square, which form one of the finest single collections on the
Mountain. To attempt their description is useless: for even the
broadest generalisations will convey nothing to those who are not
familiar with these paintings of the Orthodox Church, their rigid
symbolism, extraordinary mastery of composition, and brilliance of
colour and light. One larger than the rest, a <i>Panaghia</i>
behind the altar, stood pre-eminent, not only for its uncommon
depiction of the Virgin and Child in the act of kissing, but for a
treatment of flesh and drapery so savage in its contempt for the
naturalistic that, were it exhibited in a London salon, it might be
criticised as the culminating blasphemy of the mechanical
environment. The identity of vision displayed by industrial and
contemplative artists, however explicable, never ceases to astonish
me.</p>

<p>There hang in this church, besides the paintings, two works of
art of universal significance. These are two panels in mosaic,
about 40 inches by 18, representing St. George and St. Demetrius,
and dating back from the eleventh or twelfth century. The absence
of any comprehensive work on Christian mosaic is one of the gaps in
the artistic literature of the world that remains to be filled.
Christian mosaic; for to the ancients, despite their facility,
mosaic was never more than an opaque medium of architectural
decoration.</p>

<p>For the first ten centuries of Christianity, the medi&aelig;val
Greeks were almost the exclusive keepers of its culture and its
art; that art which, deriving primarily from Constantinople,
gradually took root throughout Europe, and upon the advent of
Giotto, its immediate child, flowered to perfection in the early
Renaissance. Fostered by the necessity of instructing the
illiterate, more attention than hitherto was devoted, under the
Church, to coloured representation on a flat plane. This clumsy
definition implies, for us, painting. But, for those who moved
within the sphere of that fabulous wealth guarded by the queen of
cities, painting was a cheap and secondary craft. Mosaic&mdash;by
which it meant, not the marble cubes of antiquity, but those of
glass coloured in a layer at the top&mdash;was the medium commanded
by the well-to-do, who rightly considered it to surpass paint, both
in richness of colour and of general texture. And it was not
therefore surprising that the artistry of inlaid squares in the
Levant should have reached a standard far beyond the conceptions of
those who have only explored the semi-Roman friezes of Ravenna or
the Italianised imitations of St. Mark's. The initial masterpieces
of this forgotten art are at Daphni, near Athens, at the monastery
of St. Luke of Stiris in Phocis, and at the Kahri&eacute; at
Constantinople. But these are all mural; and, as such, subordinated
to the architectural necessities of the buildings which contain
them.</p>

<p>For purposes of classification, mosaic falls, like painting,
into three categories. These are: wall decoration; miniatures; and
pictures proper. The first demands exaggerated breadth of
treatment, equally disposed throughout; the second a corresponding
attention to detail; and the third, the picture, a combination of
both those characteristics with an intermediate technique of its
own. Thus, in a portrait, the background is broad; the face of
delicate construction; and the drapery must bridge the two. While
the mark of a fine portrait is the unity of the three: achieved
partly by the texture of the paint, partly by the relation of each
to the other, the background lending importance to the figure and
the figure to the face. Nor is it different in a mosaic picture:
the coarser mural blocks are employed upon the background; the
raspberry-pip minutiae of the portative panel for the hands, face,
and such other incidents of the composition that may need
accentuation; and a middle size of glazed cube, about one-seventh
of an inch square, for the intermediate provinces.</p>

<p>To most people, even those who have pilgrimaged over the Near
East, mosaic is familiar only as a wall-covering. The existence of
the tiny panels whose dimensions can only be counted in inches is
recognised; such is that of St. Nicolas, damaged by an oyster
during a marine sojourn, which we had seen last year at the
monastery of Stavronikita. But of mosaic pictures, such as fall
within the definition suggested above, hardly any are known. There
is a <i>Panaghia</i> in the Byzantine Museum at Athens which was
brought from Asia Minor by the refugees; although few visitors to
that city think it worth their while to inspect its incomparable
delicacy of colour, varying on face and hands from coral pink to
olive green, and its interplay of cubes, coarse and fine. This is
fourteenth century. And there are also the two at Xenophontos.</p>

<p>The figures are standing three-quarter face and full length, St.
George facing the beholder's right, St. Demetrius his left. St.
George is clothed in dark chocolate clasped with lapis and varied
with another drapery the colour of deep eighteenth century brick;
the whole powdered with broad arrows, circles, diamonds, and
trellises of gold. The robe of St. Demetrius, similarly ornamented,
is of dark sapphire, lighted with turquoise; while, underneath, the
same dark brown alternating with weathered vermilion appears above
boots of brilliant faience blue and green. But it is in the
rendering of heads and hands that the marvel of technique is
achieved. Placed in lines of tiny blocks, firm and regular, the
colours range from shadow of deepest sepia, through olive green, to
scarlet, pink, and at last, on the face, lines of pure white
miraculously worked down the outline of the nose and round the
corners of the eyes. While in places, to express not a depression,
but a quality of the skin, minute patches of brilliant blue are
introduced. And all within a compass of three inches radius. Nor is
this fineness confined to flesh alone. Facing the forehead of each
saint is a small truncated Christ, whose attitude of admonition is
expressed with a strength and precision exactly opposed to the
delicate merging of the colours elsewhere. The haloes of the saints
are of blue, and the backgrounds of gold. Round St. Demetrius runs
a border&mdash;three single lines of large cubes in red, white, and
blue.</p>

<p>From the new church the abbot then led us to the old. This
building lies nearer the gate, presenting from below an
extraordinary picture in the brilliant sunlight, its walls and
cupolas of clear spring yellow outlined in white and reducing the
brazen blue of the sky to a colourless dark. The interior, paved
with eleventh century <i>opus Alexandrinum,</i> is unusually small,
having for this reason been abandoned; and it is consequently free
of that load of ornament&mdash;corona, chandeliers, candlesticks,
thrones, and reading-stands with which the churches of the Orthodox
rite are always obscured. It was possible at last to gain an idea
of the true decorative value of one of the older Athonite churches,
where no inch had been left unpainted. And the livid, angry lights
and ruthless impressionism of these frescoes in particular were
lent an extraordinary intensity by the emptiness of the building.
Here, moreover, is vouchsafed the ultimate corroboration of our
thesis that El Greco was a Byzantine artist of the strongest
conviction, who, having dispensed with the iconographic formulae of
his native church, spent his whole life in reverting to its spirit,
technique, and colour; and who alone of all his nation, and of all
the Slavs, Russians, Serbs, Bulgars, and Rumanians over whom its
influence extended, brought Byzantine art to its logical fruition.
Nowhere exists a link one half, one quarter so strong with this
great painter of all time, and direct forebear of modern art, as in
this small church decorated by an unknown hand in 1544, three years
after El Greco was born. Here is displayed all the maladroitness
and crudity which the separation from the cultural fertility of a
capital necessarily entails. But the troubled spirit of the artist
has clamoured through his limitations. Not great painting, his work
is none the less great expression.</p>

<p>The abbot Akakios overwhelmed us with help. No trouble was too
great for our convenience. David began focusing with the aid of
some small steps. On requesting larger, ladders that would have
scaled the walls of Babylon&mdash;such, of course, as any
well-conducted farm would naturally possess&mdash;were brought to
our assistance, the abbot directing operations in person. This
friendliness was not, as is sometimes the case, the result of
poverty. All the buildings were well kept, the monks neither few
nor squalid, and the abbot was arrayed, after the custom of his
kind, in a rustling silken gown.</p>

<p>Athonite ladders are peculiar. That part which contains the
steps goes to a point, from which depends, not, as with us, a
similar construction without steps, but a single hinged pole. Owing
to this pyramidical tendency, the higher the ladder, the larger its
base. Two such erections and the whole floor-space of this small
church was filled. What, therefore, was David's surprise when, on
looking out from behind the <i>eiconostasis</i> where he had just
released the shutter for a twenty-minutes' exposure, he found
himself imprisoned by the initial gabble of a service, conducted in
and out the ladders. This was that same rite which had so assisted
our toilet earlier in the day, numerous old monks and labourers
coming forward at intervals to be sprinkled with holy water from
the bunch of basil.</p>

<p>"Don't," said the officiating father, "interrupt your work for
us."</p>

<p>David did not. And the office was brightened by an orchestra of
splintering plates and maledictory hisses. Mark and I had escaped,
meanwhile, to the sea.</p>

<p>After lunch, served in a small refectory furnished with a table
covered in green American cloth, a cruet, and a Greek map of
Europe, Father Damascene arrived for his portrait. The time was
past when Mark expected me to make these appointments for him. He
had learnt the sentence, "May I do your <i>eicon,</i> my father?"
by heart. And the types that he picked now prowled upon our
slumbers unheralded. Damascene, whose acquaintance, it will be
remembered, we had made upon the quay, sat himself in a chair, at
his feet my suit-case, by his shoulder a lamp of pink glaze
decorated with forget-me-nots. His pinched face, with its wispish
silver growths, bent pince-nez, cap crushed slightly on one side,
and air of portentous, almost lunatic solemnity, lent itself to
more than portraiture. After an hour he inspected the result. He
was speechless; and, dismissing it with a gesture, tottered
furiously out of the door. Thus, as always, while David and I
laboured in our joint rebirth of the history of European painting,
its delivery altogether dependent on the goodwill of our hosts,
Mark must needs undo the tact of days, and the construction of
sentences calculated to fracture our cranial bones, in the practice
of a frivolous and unmoral art...We dined off red mullet, delicious
as trout, and aubergines fried in slivers. David then developed.
But the water in the sink had ceased to run; and we perforce sat
near the courtyard fountain till nearly midnight, looking at the
stars, turning our faces to the velvet cold of the breeze and
listening to the distant presence of the sea.</p>

<p>It occurred to us on the following afternoon to walk up the hill
and help the grape-pickers. First, however, I was obliged to take
some notes in the church. When these were completed, David, panting
on the apex of a wooden Eiffel Tower, found himself without a
colour filter. This I went to fetch. But, before I could return,
the guest-master was blocking the doorway with our afternoon
coffee. At his heels came the abbot, lighting the room with his
smile, and bearing two waxen, full-blown gardenias, which reminded
me, as I put one in my buttonhole, of cricket matches at Lord's,
and the triumph over the despicable majority who only wore
carnations.</p>

<p>"These flowers," said the abbot, "are very difficult to grow. We
must go and see the monk who gave them to me. He has a little
tree."</p>

<p>I was about to excuse myself, on the plea of David's necessity,
when the monk in question stepped into the room, burly and benign.
We thanked him, shook his hand, and said that in England such
flowers were worn only with ceremonial clothes at weddings. Both
then caught sight of Damascene's portrait, to which Mark was
putting last touches. Now, I thought, grasping the colour filter
for an exit...when Damascene himself trailed his boat-like feet
over the threshold. Once more he inspected the drawing, and, fixing
his eyes on space, marched from the room. Whereat the abbot and his
friend of the gardenias resolved into a paroxysm of laughter, and,
snatching the picture from Mark, held it up between them, shaking
as they sat. The noise attracted the guest-master, and others, till
half the monastery was heaving and chuckling over this unholy
likeness of its worthy, but evidently not respected, brother. Again
I moved to the door.</p>

<p>This time fate took flesh in an elderly professor, Edwardian
tweeded, who paused in alarm at the brink of this unedifying mirth.
Was I Mr. Byron? Evlogios of the Lavra had told him in Caryes that
he would find me. He could not stay the night here, being obliged
to return to Russico. But perhaps we should meet later at
Vatopedi.</p>

<p>"Do you," I said, "know Father Adrian of Vatopedi?"</p>

<p>"Adrian! He is my greatest friend in the world."</p>

<p>"Tell him," I begged, "that we are arriving on such and such a
date."</p>

<p>The professor then forced his way to the abbot, who, we were
glad to see, disdained him. His visit, however, had the advantage
of gaining us an extra round of <i>ouzo.</i></p>

<p>And so at last I reached the church. David had disappeared.</p>

<p>We set off then, as originally intended, up the hill. But the
walk was marred by Mark's arrogance in the field of natural
history. Delivering himself, over the smallest flies, of rhapsodies
in which I felt bound to join for fear of hurting his feelings, he
had the habit, whenever I espied a butterfly recorded hitherto only
in Patagonia, of quickening his pace in the opposite direction with
an air of assumed boredom. This odious jealousy, combined with the
heat, led us, instead of up the hill, to the beach, where we found
David already in the water. The bathe was enlivened by our
imitation of Queen Victoria&mdash;had she ever swum&mdash;in
propelling her rigid bust through the waves with that peculiar
bustle motion which she would doubtless have employed. This pastime
may seem unusual; but not unnatural, in view of the goodness of
Providence, who has reincarnated the face of the monarch upon the
person of the author. Her motions were the cause of some
astonishment to the professor, who was taking his departure in a
small boat.</p>

<p>We returned now to draw the abbot. Fetching his tall black
staff, his black rosary, and his veil from the "abbotry," he
unlocked the door of a private room, of which the wallpaper bore
the impress of the Byzantine eagles and the likeness of a servant's
bedroom. There he arrayed himself, and we drew till the light
failed. Upon my showing the result to the guest-master as we sat
upon a balcony drinking cocktails, he asserted that the staff was
too big. I defended it with heat; till at length we were shaking
our fists at each other's noses. I then perpetrated a caricature of
him of such malice as to leave him quite bewildered.</p>

<p>"The beard, oh, the beard&mdash;it <i>is</i> bad," he cried.</p>

<p>Morning broke with the arrival of the abbot, bearing a bunch of
sweetpeas, mauve and fleshy, which pervaded the whole room with
their smell. It was complicated, later, by the descent of Mark's
sponge and shaving-brush into a vegetable-bed. The gate was locked;
but the gardener was found, and, on recovering Mark's property,
presented him with a tremendous citron, four inches long, which he
plucked from a tree near by. After packing, we visited the library,
where such manuscripts as survived Robert Curzon had perished in a
fire. The only volume of entertainment was <i>Great Britain's
Coasting Pilot</i>, written in 1744 by "Captain Greenville Collins,
hydrographer in ordinary to the King's most excellent Majesty." On
a table stood a ghastly corset, fitting over the shoulders and
round the chest and waist, which was composed of jointed iron
plates, each one about three inches long, one broad, and a quarter
thick. This had formerly been an instrument of mortification. Here
of all monasteries it seemed out of keeping.</p>

<p>At last, with honest grief, we said good-bye, presenting the
abbot with a volume on church needlework. In return he showed us
the abbot's official treasures, more <i>eicons,</i> and a bellying
silver jug presented a few years ago by an English <i>lordos</i>
who had arrived in a yacht. We pictured the latter's relief at its
departure from the dining-room table. The abbot then posed himself
on some steps for a photograph; I, myself, on a pile of logs, to
take it. The latter collapsed, and, with a crash that deranged the
whole courtyard, I descended into the mouth of an adjacent
cooking-pot.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch13"></a>Chapter XIII. FRANKFORT</h2>

<p>Our boatman was a native of Gytheion. On hearing of our
intention to visit the churches of Mistra near by, his pride of
birthplace surged up within him and he harangued us till the boat
swayed. To me also the amenities of the district were not unknown.
And his words threw my thoughts into a train of reflection on the
circumstances that first led me to those parts.</p>

<p>My early days in Athens were spent in an exiguous basement flat
one quarter the size of Howe's, and giving access, like his, to a
vine-covered courtyard. A small but genuine bath&mdash;that is to
say, not a tub&mdash;had been placed in a hen-house at the farther
end. Here, such water as had not been stolen by the neighbours was
heated in a witches' cauldron suspended over a bonfire, whence the
flames came ravening into the bath upon the unwary body. Directly
opposite, five feet across the yard, lived an old woman in a
miserable plaster hutch, who sat all day long at her threshold
knitting. Though even the hen-hole of our bathroom door had been
boarded, her sense of propriety was appalled at the splashings
within. And no sooner had the first saunter of a dressing-gown
signalled from the entrance of the flat, than she let down a
curtain of thick white lace over her own and retired within. Since
there were no windows, she was obliged by our ablutions to spend
the whole of every morning in darkness.</p>

<p>Atop the daily remorse thus inflicted came the Greek Easter. The
landlady had a lamb. Arachne, the ancient knitter, had a lamb. We
had a lamb. And none ceased, day or night, to bleat the terror of
its impending doom. Ours broke loose on Good Friday. With the
agility of an ibex, it leaped through the window upon my host and
curveted from room to room, lent wings by the resilience of the
beds. Next night was Easter eve. With the whole city, we waited
outside the cathedral; watched at midnight the Metropolitan emerge
from the lighted doors, bearing the holy fire that had descended on
his candle as the Easter morning broke; surged with the crowd
towards him; lit our candles as soon as we might from the first
within reach; and, carefully guarding the sacred flame, set off to
our Passover. This consisted of eggs dyed red and blazoned "Christ
is risen," accompanied by the lamb, now turning whole upon a spit
over a bed of wood ashes. The party was a large one, containing,
besides ourselves and Phyllis, a former colonel of the Coldstream
Guards, his wife, his brother, and the latter's wife.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed, therefore, by this mounting burden of domestic and
social stress, we left early in the following week for the
south.</p>

<p>The train to Tripolitza, owing to that astonishing conformation
of sea and mountains which is Greece, takes thirteen hours to cover
eighty crow-flown miles. This allows ten minutes for lunch off
macaroni offal and hot beer at Corinth. Corinth! Corinth: with the
shunt of goods trains ever in the ear and the slag-heaps gaunt and
black against the faience blue of the gulf. Corinth is the Reading
of Greece, and the S.P.A.P., its railway, the Hellenic Great
Western. To one whom the Great Western has borne to home, school,
and university, Reading stands apart from all places, rusted in the
heart. What hours have I paced those platforms, endlessly,
hopelessly, where the draughts of Siberia and the solstice heats of
Ecuador focus their unscrupling rigours on the eructated passenger.
I have swallowed the chocolate of automatic machines, I have smoked
their cigarettes, I have snivelled at their unguents. I have
written novels like Roman inscriptions on their rose-labels, that
have stretched across the platform and on to the lines. I know each
waiting-room as a home, each waitress as a mother, each porter as a
brother. Reading, my Reading! Be I thy Brooke, thy Tennyson, thy
Sitwell! Shall biscuit fade and railroad wane, faithful I will e'er
remain. And second only to this, my incomparable amour, second in
body though one in soul, is Corinth.</p>

<p>Nor, for me, has Corinth lacked the weaving of human romance.
Returning on a June evening from the monastery of Megaspilion, with
the sun setting over the mountains across the gulf and the purple
spikes of buddleias stroking honeyed kisses on my boots as I sat on
the dashboard of the train, I came to conversation with a
Mademoiselle Vlasto, who was breaking a sojourn in the country to
visit her Athenian dentist, owing to a tooth which was causing her
insupportable pain. There was no restaurant-car. It was sultry to
the point of suffocation. And the journey was four hours more. As
we drew in to Corinth station, I forced my way through the numerous
crowd that gathers in these parts to see trains on their way, and
fetched her a bottle of lemonade. In the twilight of the carriage I
caught a gleam of velvet-brown eyes, heard a murmur of thanks. But
closer I never probed, since her face was entirely hidden in the
veils and bandages of her affliction. Picture, then, my chagrin
when, a few days later, she reported to a mutual friend that she
had "found a new admirer, a young Englishman." The vision of that
unseen face has not ceased to haunt me.</p>

<p>Thus ran my thoughts. And they must have continued to Gytheion,
whither we were bound when the journey began; where the dark-leaved
oaks spring singly from the ploughed red earth; and where, it will
be remembered, the boatman was born; when that holy man, switching
from the cradle to the hemispheres, enquired whether London was in
England and what lived in Australia. Jerked into the present, I
tried to ease his curiosity. On arrival at Docheiariou, he carried
our luggage up from the sea, and, seating himself in the
guest-room, launched further periods of speech upon us. Lunch was
on the table before he was gone.</p>

<p>The room in which we sat was the prettiest we had occupied, and
instanced, as at the Lavra, the similarity between monastic ideas
on decoration and those dictated by the fashion of the 1920's. The
walls were of white, broken only by blue folding doors panelled in
green lozenges, which were outlined in red. Though the tones of
these colours were in themselves dull, their juxtaposition produced
an intensity that made them difficult to look at. Round the top of
the room ran a curved vaulting about two feet deep, spottily
marbled in gentian blue, and adorned, in the middle of each wall,
with a floresque design in the same blue. On this was supported the
ceiling, where a circular pattern of carved wood consisted of a
series of radiating baroque spokes in hot brick-red on a background
of green. Since the room, in the manner of Athonite rooms, was
built out over the lower courtyard, its windows ran the whole
length of two walls. In a third was an open fireplace enclosed by a
thick stone mantelpiece above a raised hearth. Sir George Bowen,
who visited the Mountain in 1849 during colder weather, talks of
fires that blazed in every room. To-day, except at Kerasia, this
was the only fireplace that we saw. Elsewhere was always the tall,
organ-like blue and white stove. Above this mantelpiece rose two
tiny pillars of twisted black and lilac, curving over into a
miniature baroque arch. The room was erected in 1753, and was
described by Walpole in 1818 as "elegant." Even previous to its
existence the Jesuit Braconnier, at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, found the guest-rooms of Docheiariou the most comfortable
on the Mountain.</p>

<p>Externally also the monastery possesses an individual and rather
intimate charm. The hills here slope sharply from the sea, and the
buildings are arranged on a series of terraces. Almost the whole of
the main courtyard is occupied by the church&mdash;the largest on
Athos, and dating from 1568. This building is surmounted by a
series of tall, fluted cupolas washed a dull chocolate. From the
uppermost terrace, whither gave the guest-house porch, it was
almost possible to touch their leaded, shell-like domes.</p>

<p>We had arrived this year a month later than last. And the
profusion of flowers which had completed the scene was less. Then I
wrote: "Above, hung an arbour of wistaria in flower against the
rusty plaster and grey stone of the buildings. In a corner, the
delicate light green leaves and scarlet flowers of
pomegranate-trees showed in contrast against the larger, deeper
mulberry"&mdash;to-day there were pomegranates instead. "Beyond
appeared the pink and grey of an oleander. On the low wall in
front, hung with the virulent purple-blue trumpets of morning
glory, stood rows of bright green pincushions&mdash;basil, the
sweet herb. Surrounding the church stretched stone roofs covered
with yellow lichen and sprouting armies of tall white chimneys like
ninepins. While below all lay the silver blue of the sea, with the
off-shore currents trailing away to further wooded promontories.
And at last the summit, caught in the sun above a wreath of cloud,
reared its white point against the deep blue sky."</p>

<p>Synesius of last year was guest-master no longer. His place was
taken by a rubicund old monk whose cotton wool beard grew at right
angles from his chin, and ended, at some distance, in a final
upward flourish towards his nose. Of him, during lunch, we enquired
for our long expected Frankfort.</p>

<p>"Frankfort?" he replied. "What is Frankfort?"</p>

<p>Later we bathed. But, conscience-stricken by the gusts of
singing that were wafted on us from above, we returned in time to
see the end of the service and the relics afterwards. The first of
them was the head of St. Friday, or, if the name of the last day
but one be translated from the Greek, of St. Preparation, a lady,
and not, as some may have supposed, the factotum of Robinson
Crusoe. This was followed by that of St. Denys the Areopagite: "CUT
OFF IN ENGLAND!" shouted the keeper of the treasures in a sudden
fury, as if, in his estimation, our whole nation were still
blood-guilty of this blackest infamy. Then came an ancient gold
cross, set with a profusion of small diamonds and emeralds, which
had been presented to the monastery by one of the Voivodes of
Moldo-Wallachia. A traveller had once tried to buy it. And he was a
member, we were given to understand, of a nation not apparently
content with the single crime of St. Denys' execution. Last and
most prized of all the treasures, however, was a shapeless piece of
white marble. A young monk, discovering a buried horde, reported it
to the abbot, who despatched two others to help him bring it to the
monastery. These, thinking to keep it for themselves, tied this
piece of marble round his neck and threw him into the sea. Next
morning he was found in the church, having been delivered by the
archangels Gabriel and Michael. He forgave his assailants, and the
stone, which was to have been the instrument of his death, is
preserved. But the interest of this rather tedious and not
improbable story, to which the archangels have been attached, lies
in the fact that for not less than four and a half centuries, and
who knows how many more, this stone has been shown and this story
told to the monastery's visitors. The marvel is related in 1489 by
Paisios, a Russian monk of Chilandari, in exactly those words with
which the priest now held our attention.</p>

<p>Many early Russian accounts of the Mountain are extant. And the
first of them, from the pen of Ignatius of Smolensk in 1389,
confirms the fact that the Athonite community has not changed in
substantial outline since. The rest are uniformly dull. Such,
indeed, is the outstanding quality of most of the accounts of the
Mountain that have survived, the exceptions in our own language
being those of Tozer, Curzon, and Dr. Covel. The attentions of the
majority seem to have focused solely on the collection of
statistics, the discovery of classical inscriptions, and the
inspection of fishes' viscera and plants' bowels. In particular,
the sententious moralisings of the nineteenth century, humorous as
we have grown to regard them, still exhale a nauseous reek when
applied to those who had the good fortune (though bad taste) to be
dwelling outside the British Isles at the time. Thus, for instance,
writes Lieutenant Webber-Smith in 1837: "Dokhiariu, a small
monastery containing 30 caloyers: nothing worth notice. Near this
spot is the cave of a noted recluse who has lived here in a cell
for fifty years apart from all mankind; yet his feelings would seem
not to be blunted, as he bestows the care and attention on a
favourite rose-tree which, if well directed toward the good of his
fellow creatures, might have made him a useful member of the
community." But the words of this inflated naval cub pale before
those of Mr. Athelstan Riley, who is still amongst us. He, a
religious of the 'eighties&mdash;those years which threatened to
precipitate the Anglican Church from a comfortable evening of
desuetude to a painful and despised end&mdash;Mr. Riley has
bequeathed posterity the following eulogium of his hosts: "...those
poor folk whom the world despises and condemns, the humble and
illiterate peasant monks." Such is the Christian understanding
which simultaneously avows its hope for the union of the Anglican
and Orthodox Churches. Comment fails. Save that, in this despising
and contemning world of which Mr. Riley forms a part, if not a
whole, Christianity, which the monks have kept, has been lost.</p>

<p>After the relics, we examined the church, admiring the numerous
slabs and lintels of late Byzantine carving with which it is
decorated. In keeping with its spacious proportions, the pillars
are unusually tall and thick, their capitals being freshly gilded.
The frescoes, by the same Zorzi as worked at Dionysiou, have been
repainted out of recognition. But their decorative value remains,
enhanced by the size and lightness of the building.</p>

<p>As we were sitting over our wine after dinner, Synesius arrived.
He had heard that three Englishmen were asking for Frankfort, and
knew that I must be one of them.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "I am no longer guest-master. I have become
an elder." And he rustled a new and elaborate gown. We were
surprised, seeing that, despite his intelligence, he could not have
been more than 30.</p>

<p>"There are ten elders and three <i>epitropoi,"</i> he continued.
This is usual; however a monastery is governed, its superiors
habitually number thirteen, in imitation of the first Christian
corporation.</p>

<p>"And how is everything on the Mountain?"</p>

<p>"Better. Now that the Government's policy is settled, our
affairs will continue to improve. How big is London? Seven
millions; really. And New York? Oh, two. Where are your friends of
last year? Here is Hamid. Frankfort I can't find. But you shall see
him in the morning. Hamid! Hamid!" And Hamid, a grey and yellow
tortoiseshell, jumped obediently in and out of Synesius'
outstretched arms.</p>

<p>The morrow dawned with Mark in a cheerful mood. This may be
spared the reader. It was only damped by the re-entry of Synesius,
begging us to visit him. I excused myself that I was busy. But, as
his house was so placed on the farther side of the terrace that all
its windows looked directly into ours, and as he did not cease to
wave, I found concentration impossible. Opening the "red door," as
directed, Mark and I entered a small flat, the living-room of which
was decorated with Synesius' treasures. Above the divan on which he
sat hung numerous prints and enlarged photographs: King Constantine
and his family; Venizelos; Cl&eacute;menceau; Plastiras; besides a
wealth of snapshots. He also possessed, he said, a portrait of
Lloyd George; but it was too big to fit into the room. Upon the
fringed table lay lumps of golden-coloured quartz&mdash;a frequent
refinement, we noticed, of Athonite taste. But our attention was
diverted from these details by the arrival of Frankfort.</p>

<p>Frankfort is a black and white cat, who, when bidden,
reluctantly places his head between his paws and turns a
somersault. He is apt, however, when lazy, simply to roll over on
one side. This he did to-day. But Synesius was firm, and the whole
turn was eventually completed. Then, disturbed by our approbation,
he vouchsafed us one look of unutterable hatred and rushed from the
room.</p>

<p>From his pantry Synesius now fetched brandy in a decanter,
<i>glyco</i> made of quinces, grapes, and peaches; to which he
added, from a drawer, cigarettes. A white dove in a wicker cage
such as wizards' ravens inhabit, was dangled for our entertainment.
Finally, having eaten and drunk, we stepped on to the balcony. The
view was one of radiant beauty in the clean morning sun. Below us
glittered a rocking line of roof, tiled in slabs of shimmering
silver stone, and bursting up into the high white chimneys. And
instead of earth, there were only olives, profuse as soda-water
bubbles, with a high-light to each tree. They fell to the blue sea,
a deeper tone than any tree save the cypresses in a group at its
edge. Land showed again on the horizon: Longos, the middle of the
three fingers.</p>

<p>Synesius, not content with being photographed himself reading a
book upside down, asked us to do the same favour for an old man who
lived next door. Wishing to please, we were ushered into a small
dark room impregnated with the unsupportable odour of human
mortification. Propped on a divan sat a very old man, helpless and
immobile, in whose eyes was only the beyond. Replacing his cap by a
new and stiffer one, Synesius roared in his ear to be still. As the
shutter waited, Mark and I sat tremblingly forbidding the senses of
sight and smell to record the ghastly evidences of extreme debility
which the room afforded. Startled by shouts for assistance from
David in the refectory below, we left as soon as we could. Synesius
gave us each a parting gift&mdash;Mark a topaz, "old and
Byzantine"; myself a wooden chalice, containing two wooden rings
and a wooden hand holding a purple wooden egg. The mystic
significance of these I never discovered.</p>

<p>David we found in a temper. He considered the particular
paintings in the refectory upon which I had picked, to be
ridiculous. Our altercation was interrupted by a monk who knew ten
words of American and chose this moment to ask David his name.</p>

<p>"Holdjertonguedamnyou," was the reply, which puzzled the monk
and sent Mark and me fleeing into the sea. On the way we passed an
old <i>epitropos</i> standing in a rampart of faggots before a
weighing-machine, by which he was measuring the barrels of the
monastery's wine. These were then borne off on the shoulders of
labourers for export, to a schooner lying at anchor beyond the
jetty.</p>

<p>Lunch of monkey-nut soup and salad was marred by a number of
rotting sprats. Maddened by the stench, we threw one into the
fireplace and one out of the window. The former could be replaced
in its garniture of parsley, and, when our tempers had subsided,
was. But the other, to our discomfiture, landed on the roof of the
church, and remained casting looks of reproachful intensity through
the open windows. Fortunately this hypnotic glance proved without
effect on the guest-master.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we were fetched to see the library. It was hot.
And David refused to come. But Mark and I, equally loth though more
polite, triumphed. For we discovered a miniature of a Byzantine
emperor seated in the royal box of the Constantinople hippodrome,
watching the dismemberment of St. James of Persia, which David was
incensed to have missed, since it might have proved a valuable clue
in the excavations at Constantinople. But our departure was fixed
and his opportunity lost. Shaking once more the hand of Synesius,
we rode down to the beach, and along it for an hour, to where the
arsenal of Zographou was visible across the bay.</p>

<p>We had approached Docheiariou on a former occasion from the
other side of the promontory altogether. And had stopped for lunch
at Castamonitou. This monastery, one of the four that are situated
right away from the sea, is so lacking in architectural feature as
to be remarkable. Its austere grey walls rising among the sunlit
green of planes and chestnuts seemed such as might enclose a
Yorkshire farmhouse. Unlike their environment, the inmates who
entertained us were the most genial and expansive old men. I had
thought we might call on them during our present journey. But the
muleteer informed us that it was an hour out of the way. It was
therefore upsetting to learn later that they had known of my
presence, and had expressed themselves deeply hurt that I had
passed their very door without coming in.</p>

<p>My progress on the ride was somewhat retarded. The
pony&mdash;for such was its genus&mdash;was disposed to lag behind.
My coat dropped, and no sooner had I with infinite difficulty
remounted&mdash;for Greek saddles, being girthed with a single
cord, usually slip under the animal's belly unless there is
somebody to hold the other side&mdash;than I was again on my feet
to retrieve a pair of spectacles dropped by a passing monk. A
ruined tower then demanded a photograph. By this time the pony was
out of temper, and the others half a mile ahead. From the tower to
the arsenal&mdash;the latter flanked by a row of Lombardy poplars,
a marsh of bamboo, and a light railway for carrying wood down from
the hills above&mdash;I walked, the pony following. The path led me
to a peculiar building shaped like a beehive and resembling a
Kentish oast-house. Anxious to obtain another photograph of it, I
started out to sea along the pier. This had subsided in the middle,
and, as I was walking backwards, it was with a shock that I felt
one foot suddenly descend into a watery crater. At last, however, I
obtained a reasonable perspective; when the pony, who had been
cynically watching, now pirouetted off home to Docheiariou. Leaping
the crater, the sea, and the beach, I pursued it. But the faster I
walked, the faster it trotted. I ran. It cantered. I leapt from
olive terrace to olive terrace in the effort to cut off the hairpin
bends of the path. It galloped. And when at last it had flung my
coat, my despatch-case, and the monastery's new Turkey rug to the
ground, I left it.</p>

<p>Twilight was falling. It was extremely hot. I did not know the
way, and was exhausted with my steeplechase. Laden like a
carpet-vendor, I stumbled wearily back to the pier again, where I
found a monk, who regarded my purple face with horror, till we
simultaneously broke into devilish mirth.</p>

<p>"How long," I said, "is it to the monastery?"</p>

<p>"An hour."</p>

<p>"An hour? What am I to do? I won't walk for an hour. I am tired.
I have these things to carry. I don't know the way, and it is
getting dark."</p>

<p>He shrugged.</p>

<p>"Is there a telephone?"</p>

<p>He negatived.</p>

<p>Then, catching me by the arm, he tiptoed up the causeway, over
the beach, to a shed at the back of the arsenal. Therein glimmered
the hindquarters of a mule, ready saddled. This animal he coaxed
without, sat me upon it, disposed my property on the saddle, and
with a fierce thwack, sent it clattering up the cobbled road. No
sooner did hoof touch stone than the yell of a Goliath reverberated
from the shore. Looking back, I saw a man, arms uplifted in
commination, moving upon the monk. Chivalry called me back. But the
mule, whose home was above, had no such feeling. A corner
intervened as the two closed.</p>

<p>David, meanwhile, had come back to meet me. He did not notice
that I had a new mount. Nor did the muleteer responsible for the
old, till I told him. His concern for the pony was negligible. But
his astonishment at my having conjured a second beast from the
pebbles of the beach knew no bounds.</p>

<p>The landscape had now become entirely unlike that of the
southern end of the peninsula. Those broken hills to which we were
accustomed, half shrubs, half rock, pierced by gullies and made
savage with naked crags; those, with all their lines leading to the
ridge, and the ridge to the peak, now gave place to a great
sweeping country, densely forested and cast in tremendous dales so
deep that, with the sun in decline, all the bottoms were in shadow.
The road was broad, and the bridges built on a grand scale. In the
river-beds the light leaves of the plane-trees, trunks gnarled with
the rushing of winter torrents, contrasted with the darker tones of
the rest. And again, as we had found on the summit, there was
autumn in the air. Half the leaves were already fallen.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch14"></a>Chapter XIV. THE PURSUIT OF CULTURE</h2>

<p>Zographou, the monastery "of the painter," for which we were
bound, has been consistently occupied by Slavs and Macedonians
since the tenth century, and is now entirely Bulgarian. It was
formerly very rich, owning lands in Bessarabia, whence the Russian
Government, being anxious to foster the Slav element on the
Mountain, did not hinder the revenues. Hence the fine road and
broad bridges up which we had ridden. The present late nineteenth
century buildings are built on an immense plan, of plain squared
stone, four or five stories high. As we approached, it seemed as
though here were some huge eighteenth century palace&mdash;a
mixture, if such a thing can be imagined, of Windsor and Blenheim.
The impression was confirmed by the entrance, where a porch like a
railway terminus sheltered a coarse, bloated porter whose obesity
was such that he could scarcely speak or move. When our letters had
been examined, we were conducted to the guest-house, where passages
as broad as main roads gave access to the rooms. David was
installed single, that he might develop; Mark and I found ourselves
in a kind of college hall, where we were also to dine.</p>

<p>Two monks, one an <i>epitropos,</i> the other named Joseph, came
to visit us. The latter possessed cameras of his own, one of which
was stereoscopic. We discussed the League of Nations, for, on the
confiscation of property by the Greek Government, the Bulgars of
Zographou had appealed to Geneva under the treaties. They had been
no more successful than the sufferers of other nationalities. But
Joseph said there was still hope.</p>

<p>At dinner the guest-master, an elderly man who had been an
Ottoman subject, sat down with us, and he and David discoursed in
Turkish and Russian, which latter language hardly differs from
Bulgarian. Amid this babel of savage sounds, broken from time to
time by the schoolroom aspirates of Mark's now profuse
Greek&mdash;<i>hho</i> and <i>hhe</i> the definite article will
always remain for him&mdash;I was glad to forgo the everlasting
necessity of leading the conversation. Being very tired, I fell
gradually asleep over my plate of cold broad beans in iced gravy.
And on my drowsing drums played the echo of the guest-master's
ceaseless talk.</p>

<p>"Have you a father? Any sisters? Perhaps you are married? You
aren't drinking. Do women drink in England? Do they smoke too?
What's your occupation? What work do you do? What's your name? Mind
you shut that window at night. You'll get rheumatism if you don't."
The room had smelt like a deed-box before we opened it. "Well, I
see the little boy (me!) wants to go to bed. Your health! Your
health! Your health! "&mdash;and with bows all round he left.</p>

<p>So completely had we lapsed from the sequence of days and dates
with which life is ordinarily regulated, that a Sunday came upon us
with surprise. The church, dating from 1801, whither we suffered
ourselves to be led at seven the next morning, presents an exterior
emphatically striped in red and white and flanked by two gigantic
cypresses, considerably older than any of the existing buildings.
The service, which differed somewhat from the Greek, was reaching
its climax as we arrived. And it was with a sense of embarrassment
that we were conducted, in view of the whole congregation, to pay
our respects to the famous <i>eicons</i> of St. George. Of these,
one was painted supernaturally. The other came of its own volition
over the sea from Arabia. It arrived at Vatopedi. But the other
monasteries, learning of this monstrous good fortune, insisted that
it should be placed on the back of a mule and allowed to go whither
it pleased. This was done. The mule made straight for Zographou.
And the picture has remained there ever since. Our guest-master,
having prostrated before it and kissed it, recounted this history
as we stood upright and ridiculous in the middle of the church.
Eventually we were placed among the choir, which on our side was
led by a little monk who, when not singing, quacked disconcertingly
into a red beard.</p>

<p>When the service was over, we visited a smaller church,
similarly striped. The tradition of the abominable persecutions
inflicted on the Holy Mountain at the time of the Latin conquest,
when the whole of Byzantine Europe was in the hands of the Franks
and a papal legate installed at Salonica, has gained rather than
lost at Zographou during recent years. In one corner of the
courtyard is a nineteenth century cenotaph commemorating the 26
martyrs "burnt by the Pope of Rome"; a legend which is thought to
have arisen from the conflict between the Athonite monks and
Michael I Palaeologus, the Emperor who retook Constantinople; and
who, knowing that only with the support of the West could his
nation hope to defend it, applied himself to the reconciliation of
the Churches. To this project the opposition of the Athonites was
unflinching. And, the Bulgarian Church being already spasmodically
schismatic, Zographou was perhaps singled out for the Emperor's
punishment. In commemoration of the appalling outrages that
resulted, the smaller church is frescoed with graphic
representations of the arrival of the Pope in person; his
incarceration of 26 monks and 2 laymen in a tower; and the
subsequent pyre that he made of buildings and bodies. To complete
the accuracy of the spectacle, the date 1873 is attached. As the
Pope at this time was Pio Nono, he who remarked to the Anglican
Bishop of Gibraltar and Southern Europe that he had "the honour to
reside in your lordship's diocese," it is sad to think that he
never beheld the portraits that would so have pleased his sense of
humour.</p>

<p>The food at lunch, though plentiful, was of a nastiness without
precedent. Seeing me unable to swallow, Mark asked me why I did not
eat the cheese.</p>

<p>"Because I don't like it."</p>

<p>"But it's delicious&mdash;just the same as we have in Scotland,
called Crowdy."</p>

<p>Thus the barbarians always reason. The veneer which they have
acquired in the centres of the world falls off. Without a tremor
they conjure up some filthy habit of their native fastnesses. And,
not content with the very shame of the revelation, must needs
elevate it to a standard for the universe. "Crowdy!" It has always
been apparent to thinking people that some frightful custom, some
orgiastic rite that would discredit the aborigines of Papua, has
attended the childhood of those grim tribes among whom Albert and
Victoria, in the guise of "Lord and Lady Churchill," were the
Rosita Forbeses of their day. And now it is plain. "Crowdy!" These
rancid, foetid curdles that I needs must eat "because we do in
Scotland." Scotland? Where is Scotland?</p>

<p>Later Joseph arrived to show us his cameras and the library. In
the latter a selection of English literature proved more
interesting than the few early Slav manuscripts on paper. We
noticed with envy: <i>Second Love, or Beauty and Intellect, 1851;
Pocket Companion to Oxford, 1802;</i> and <i>Poppleton:
Conversation en anglais et fran&ccedil;ais, 1812.</i></p>

<p>As it was growing late, we departed immediately afterwards,
pleasantly rested by a day at a monastery where there was nothing
to photograph.</p>

<p>This labour on our part to record, pictorially and otherwise,
the works of the Athonite painters, may seem strange to those who
have read reports of their restoration and comparative novelty. It
was originally supposed, on the word of the monks, that the
majority dated from the eleventh or twelfth century. When it was
discovered that they were mainly of the fifteenth and sixteenth,
there arose a reaction among the great intelligent, the
antiquarians for the sake of age alone. But there are,
nevertheless, other works of the Byzantine Renaissance that have
remained untouched since the day they were painted. These are at
Mistra. And to Mistra, later in the year, we continued. Then, to
seek the psychological inspiration of the "Cretan school" and its
luminary, El Greco, we went to Crete as well. Our journey to the
southernmost point of the Greek dominion, contained in the
following interlude, was the complement to our long stay on the
Mountain in the north.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Those for whom Athens is but a city of broiling dust and
broiling sun will find it difficult to imagine our start for Sparta
at five o'clock in the dark of a drenching October morning. As the
train drew out, the familiar country was changed; the glaring
putty-coloured earth was now a deep red brown, almost Irish in its
softness; the greens of trees and shrubs were richer; the hills and
rocks a cold grey; and the sky a scene of billowing clouds,
decapitating the hills and allowing occasional searchlights of sun
to bathe a patch of plough or an olive-dotted slope in pale but
startling radiance.</p>

<p>Arrived at Tripolitza after the thirteen miserable hours, myself
racked with the shivers and heats of a feverish cold, we chartered
an ancient but powerful Lancia. This motor, being painted entirely
white, resembled a ghostly landau rushing through the rain behind
some invisible Pegasus. The drive was interrupted by numerous
requests for lifts and petrol. Until our patience was exhausted;
and, wishing to die in a bed, I informed the chauffeur that if, not
only did he stop, but even freewheeled again, his money would not
be forthcoming. Immediately afterwards we topped the mountains that
the road was climbing. And, with darkness almost upon us, there was
revealed that incomparable view of the valley of the Eurotas,
watered with the river and its tributaries, and rich with
mulberries, olives, and cypresses; in the centre Sparta, white and
modern; at the back Mistra, climbing indistinguishably brown to the
castle at the apex of its conical foothill; and, above it, the
towering, blue-black range of Taygetus, hump upon hump, with the
clouds thick on the top sending torn white wreaths down its clefts
and valleys. Then it became dark. The rain, lashing in upon us with
increasing fury, blinded the windscreen from the lights. But the
driver, obedient to his admonition, descended the 4,000 feet that
lay before us with his foot pressed to the accelerator. I recalled
that previously, being only two, we had shared a car designed by
God for five, with the luggage and persons of eleven others. These
were so disposed that the driver was obliged to trust the use of
the hand-and only brake to our discretion, since he himself could
not reach it. At length on the present occasion, conscious of
nothing but the cold, we drew up outside the Panhellenion Hotel. I
chartered my death-bed; and was removing my clothes for the last
time, when the Great Summons was averted by a lesser, which
announced that the mayor and prefect were awaiting us in the
Commercial Club across the square.</p>

<p>Our ears had been filled, while on the Holy Mountain, with tales
of the resentment aroused throughout Greece, and particularly in
the neighbourhood of Sparta, by the action of a distinguished
professor who was supposed, though unjustifiably, to have injured
the frescoes by treating them with chemicals. I had been at pains,
therefore, while in Athens, to ensure that we should not be
identified with similar roguery. But it was with grateful surprise
that we learned that a telegram had been sent by Monsieur Zaimis,
the Prime Minister, advising the civic authorities of our coming.
An interpreter whose English was acquired in the Sudan led us to
their presence. Seldom, perhaps never, has shattered frame made so
great an effort. But life and merriment were restored by brandy.
And we were treated to a civic banquet beside which one I had
previously eaten at the Guildhall was a mere snack. <i>Hors
d'oeuvre, pilaf,</i> chicken, pork, <i>gateau,</i> grapes, and
melon followed one another in a series of stupendous helpings; each
of which was washed down with yet another glass of that
resin-tasting wine which has brought the Greeks into national
disrepute, ever since its first denunciation by Liutprand, Otto I's
ambassador to Constantinople in the tenth century. The mayor,
exerting the whole strength of a forceful personality, insisted we
should drink. And drink we did. Till the aged prefect sank
altogether beneath the gastronomic battery of his colleague. The
meal ended with <i>Mavrodaphni,</i> a kind of Marsala, served in
champagne glasses. Next day David's interior was so deranged that
he could not eat. And the prefect was in bed. To the latter the
interpreter invariably referred as the "perfect," and, when called
on to denote his place of office, would say, "The perfect, Mr.
Byron, is at the perfection."</p>

<p>Mistra, situated three miles from Sparta, is the only purely
Byzantine city in existence. And its houses, bearing the famous
royal names of the despots, Lascaris, Cantacuzene, and Palaeologus,
remained inhabited up till the time of the Revolution. The site is
a steep and narrow cone, reaching a thousand feet above the valley
and falling from its summit, still fortified by the gigantic walls
of Villehardouin's Castle, down a sheer precipice behind. Here,
huge cliffs of black shale rise to the lower contours of Taygetus,
dotted with conifers. In front, the ruined city drops down, house
above house, enclosed in massive double walls; intersected by tiny
streets in which two mules may barely pass; and displaying in
panorama the centres of a capital: to the left the great trisected
shell of the palace of the despots, its many-windowed
banqueting-hall on the first storey still visible; and everywhere
churches, many of them roofless, the chief being the Metropolitan
at the bottom, where a priest is still attached and services held.
It was here that Constantine XI Dragases, last of the 88 emperors
of Constantinople, was crowned. The spot is commemorated by a slab
carved with the royal eagles.</p>

<p>These churches contain the whole clue to the semi-Oriental
paternity of European painting. Their importance is not to be
exaggerated. And it arouses a feeling of despair to see them, in
this age when the lesser monuments of other pasts are treated with
wasteful and absurd reverence, either roofless or fitted with doors
and windows that would discredit an Irish pigsty. With one
exception all are being rotted with the damp, are covered with a
coating of nobbly blue mould, which, though still possible to
remove, is eating through the paint to the plaster. This exception,
the church of the Convent of the Pantanassa, has had the cracks of
walls and ceiling so coarsely mended that many of the paintings,
otherwise as brilliant and delicate in colour as when the artist
left them, are barely intelligible. And in the nave are two layers
of frescoes on different coatings of plaster, both of value, one of
which needs removing and setting up elsewhere. There is the work of
years to occupy an expert. And the employment of such a man might
prove, in the end, a profitable investment. For the Greek
Government must realise that, with the world's advance towards the
appreciation of the dynamic in art, broken pillars and black and
orange pottery will not attract the rich tourist for ever. But with
the refugees, the country is harassed for lack of money. Is there
no institution endowed for the preservation of the world's cultural
monuments that will override the enforced inaction of the Athenian
Byzantinists? It is heating that is primarily needed. Cannot five
art-loving continents afford as many stoves?</p>

<p>Every day from Sparta we came and went. Every day we ate a
chicken at the Marmora, the caf&eacute; at the bottom, where a
young man and his aged mother tend the needs of infrequent
visitors; a delicious chicken, accompanied by fried potatoes,
tomato salad, and afterwards large green grapes, plucked from the
arbour above our table. Water we drank, cold and deep-tasting, from
the antique trough which catches a stream and gives the place its
name. It was curious, and somehow satisfying, to see the beasts of
such few residents as remain in the lower houses of the town
watered at this richly carved museum piece.</p>

<p>Our second centre was the Pantanassa half-way up the hill, where
Sister Eusebia and her sister by blood, the abbess, treated us as
their children. Coffee and <i>ouzo</i> they insisted we should have
when we came in and out to fetch our cameras and note-books; and a
black-robed maiden used to follow us about the courtyard and up the
terraces at the back with these little trays of welcome. Finally,
one day David decided not to come down to the Marmora to lunch, but
remain at his work without food till the evening. Sister Eusebia
would have none of it. And he was arranging the camera in the
gallery of the church when his eyes were suddenly blinded by the
exquisite symmetry of two poached eggs, set out between knife and
fork, salt and pepper, on the balustrading. The hospitality of this
tiny community of seven women was different from, though not less
than, that of their male counterparts. Theirs was that pleasure in
motherliness that only women possess. And there is a gallant spirit
in their pertinacity&mdash;clinging to the hill which all have
deserted, but they will not. They know all the ruins, the
inscriptions, and the history of the despots. And it is to their
efforts in repair that posterity owes such of the frescoes as still
survive. They were jolly old ladies, with a welcome for everyone.
Men and maidens from below used to make their gate a rendezvous.
Though this may have been temporarily due to the posse of policemen
who acted as our permanent guard of honour, and lounged about the
courtyard as we worked.</p>

<p>Whatever the nuns' isolation, the natural beauty of their
situation must fortify the weakest soul. For those epicures in
landscape who demand not only form but colour, for whom central
Europe is but a chromatic photograph and an Alp in a sunset
comparable only to the asbestos in a gas-stove, the Levant is
without peer. And in all the Levant, in Europe or Asia, pagan or
Christian, there is no place where the divine soul of the earth can
so fill the heart, so suffocate the eyes with tears, so make man
proud, as the Eurotas valley. Last year, as this, we had come every
morning from Sparta. And at the end of each day we had plodded home
along the dusty road through the olive groves, bidding the peasants
good evening and good night. Never in life will the memory of those
May nights escape; of the air enveloping, dark and real, the
breathing human kiss of the earth; of the bells of the birds
dropping round and full from the trees, with a red vein to their
silver curves; of space lit with the scattered mercury of the
stars; of one star balanced on the black brow of Taygetus and
suddenly, as by a hand, snatched off; and last, of the meticulous
scholastics from under the bridge: Brekekekex Coax Coax.</p>

<p>Now it is on rainy October days that we sit up in the
Pantanassa, drinking coffee in the Byzantine white-pillared
cloister beneath the egg-topped tower. Below us, the stone of the
ruined houses, brown and grey, merges into the hill. Then the walls
stop. And the last roots of the great mountain behind slide out
into the valley, where the rich red earth is dotted grey with
olives or striped with the spring-green of vines. Over all hangs
the odour of fresh rain. With distance the trees lose their detail
in patches of colour, Sparta hiding a white toy town in their
thickest. Each way the valley stretches, till on the east, as we
look north, a soft glint of the sea parts the rival ranges for
ever. All along above the twining silver river floats a veridian
haze. Far away rise the parallel hills, deepest sapphire, sweeping
high and regular as far as the eye can see, with the black and
white clouds rolling up, and their shadows like foreign armies
traversing the plain. In all lurks the colour of light, of the fire
of the earth, burning in watered leaf and sodden plough, catching
even the sounds as they run hazard through the air: this colour
which Greece knows and other lands do not; and which Greeks have
brought to rest, not in stone, but paint.</p>

<p>Leaving Mistra one drizzling evening, our hearts wrung with
David's good-byes, we journeyed on mules to Trypi. At the entrance
to the village stood the president, the chief of police, and other
leading men, grouped upon a rock in the rain to await our coming.
They conducted us to the inn, where they gave us drinks and talked
American, a language which we did our best to recall, as they did
not understand English. A vase of marigolds had been placed upon
the table of our room. But, beyond that, luxuries were few. Being
high up on the side of the mountain, it was extremely cold. The
beds, of straw, had a surface like their native land, and were
filled with hungry animals. The sanitary arrangements overhung a
pigsty at the end of an open gallery, along which it was necessary
to creep shielding a lighted candle from the howling storm. These
were tenanted by a Glamis monster, a livid rat big as a fox, which
rushed madly from side to side, to the terror of the bare feet. At
seven next morning we mounted the same mules for the thirty-mile
ride over the Langada pass to Calamata.</p>

<p>The path twisted at first up such precipices that it was more
comfortable to walk. Then we reached the gorge, where walls of rock
on either side reared above us into the clouds, grey and lowering
as a November sea. Here we kept to the river-bed, winding among
boulders and plane-trees; till at last the hills opened out and we
climbed among plantations of walnuts. The cold was bitter. Two
cabins on the path were already shuttered and forsaken for the
winter. And snowdrops and crocuses, purple, yellow, and white, were
flowering on the banks. At the top of the pass, where the trees
parted as though on purpose to reveal the view and the ground was
brown with pine-needles, we looked down over range after range to
the faint blue of the sea and the most southerly coastline of
Europe. Turning whence we had come, the fir-covered hills fell
steeply back to the dark entrance to the gorge. And then above all,
even ourselves, rose the extended mass of Taygetus, its three flat
peaks naked and glistening in a single patch of sun.</p>

<p>At Lada, a mountain village, we lunched with difficulty, pigs,
dogs, cats, and mules, none of whom had tasted food since the day
they were weaned, thrusting their nozzles into our sardine tins.
For four hours more we rode, up and down the grey inland cliffs,
smeared and scarred with dirty pink. Then we stood above the bay,
the port with ships at anchor, and, a little way inland, the town.
Unearthly colours, the prototype of the Byzantine painter's
landscape and as unlike nature, filled the countryside. The earth
was of deep claret, and the road along which we now galloped, of a
paler tone. The rocks, in Giottesque formation, such as attend St.
Francis' more adventurous moments, blared orange rust. And the
vegetation&mdash;aloes, thick-leaved bamboos, and even
bananas&mdash;was not more improbable than that of Van Gogh.</p>

<p>We arrived, trotting along the tram-lines, at five o'clock, and
hurried to remove a week's filth in the public baths, where a
portion of loofah was included in the shilling ticket. Returning to
the hotel, where, as at all Greek hotels outside Athens, clean and
properly appointed bedrooms were to be had for one and sixpence a
night, we encountered a flabby Italian who turned out to be the
Lloyd Triestino agent.</p>

<p>"Go from here to Crete?" he said. "Quite impossible."</p>

<p>It was impossible. Of that we were aware. For there is an
international convention which forbids steamers of one country to
carry passengers between the ports of another. But the Lloyds, one
of which we knew to be already in the harbour, are the only boats
which connect the south coast of Greece with the neighbouring
island. Once at Sparta, we were loth to return to Athens; we wished
to ride over the Langada; and we looked forward to a single night's
comfort among the Austrian traditions that the line still
maintains. Was there no solution to our dilemma? Could we not book
third class to Constantinople, the first foreign port of call? Mr.
Triadaphilopopoulos, the harbour-master, thought not. Fortunately
telegrams were cheap. And by dint of importunity over the wires to
Athens, combined with a torrential mastery of Greek on the spot, we
eventually persuaded ourselves on board, to the chagrin of the
Lloyd agent. Next morning we found ourselves at anchor in a rough
sea outside Canea. Arrival was as difficult as departure. The
governor of the island was in bed. But he was awakened and our
letter of introduction read him over the telephone. At last we were
safe. Though the mental strain and the prospect of travelling round
and round the Mediterranean on that Lloyd, visaless and penniless,
till she was broken up and our bones discovered, had left us
exhausted.</p>

<p>To portray here the individuality of Crete, this island which,
till the beginning of the twentieth century, had been "700 years in
perpetual revolt," is scarcely possible. Our visit was a
reconnoitre, a prelude, perhaps, to further exploration. At first
we remained in the capital, Canea. The buildings of this town
epitomise the whole history of the Levant. Across the mouth of the
harbour, as the rowing-boat enters, runs a mole ending in a Turkish
lighthouse, a truncated minaret delicately embroidered with stone
ornament. Nearer in, on the east, stands the earliest mosque on the
island, a tiny building with a dome that resembles three-quarters
of a doughnut and is supported by flying buttresses that might have
been borrowed from St. George's, Windsor. Look now across to the
west. It is Venice. High, multi-coloured houses, each black window
reflected in the sunlit water, jumble along the quay; and reveal,
on closer view, that it was Venice, and that the lions of St. Mark
still cry a weatherbeaten echo from the bellying walls. Behind, up
the slope from the sea, it is the same. Twisting narrow streets,
the houses so tall as to exclude all sun, display Renaissance
porticoes, escutcheons of the Venetian nobility, and even
basrelievo portraits of the generals of the Republic in plumed
helmets. On one such there appeared also the stone fez of a later
tenant. And above, as if to complete the tale, the cornice had been
furnished with a row of Greek <i>acroteria.</i> Adjacent lies the
old Turkish quarter, to-day the centre of commerce, where lanes of
windowless shops are piled with the importations of the West, side
by side with the traditional clothing and commodities of the
island.</p>

<p>It was October. The weather was clearing. And the sun shone with
golden warmth in the squares, upon the tall swinging men in their
dress of top-boots, black Turkish trousers falling in a huge bag
behind, and black cross-stitched shirts, to which were sometimes
added blue cloaks embroidered and hooded. At all the street corners
chestnuts were cooking on braziers. Fruit and game were piled high
in the market. We lunched as a rule in a disused mosque, where we
were always invited to choose our own partridge in the kitchen.
This building was also the theatre; and, since a different
performance was given nightly, there were frequent rehearsals. Our
meals were protracted by the tunes of operettas such as <i>The
Contessa Maritza,</i> and the declamations of love-stories
advertised on the posters as "[<i>Greek
characters</i>]&mdash;SHOCKING EROTICS"&mdash;delivered by unshaven
men and down-at-heel ladies, savagely painted. These, when not upon
the stage, lounged around us in basket chairs, looking strangely
irrelevant in the dim green light of this Mahommedan temple.</p>

<p>In the afternoons we bathed; or sometimes went driving with
Madame Venizelos, who was now leading a not altogether diverting
existence in the new house which she and her husband have built at
Haleppa, Canea's residential suburb. He, unfortunately, was ill
with phlebitis. On one occasion we visited Mournies, the place of
his birth, and saw the house of that event, subsequently burnt in a
rebellion and now overgrown with creepers and morning glory. Thence
we continued to a monastery, where the monks showed us the Venetian
deeds of their foundation, gorgeously illuminated with the badges
of the Republic.</p>

<p>But our visit to Crete had a definite purpose. We had heard the
White Mountains described in a passing sentence as resembling
"whitewash on coal." And we were determined to explore this
landscape, whence the Cretan painters, as all schools of painting
do, must have drawn their light and colour. Early one morning we
left the town in a motor, accompanied by three saddle-bags
containing a few clothes and one enormous sausage, on which we
lived for three days.</p>

<p>Sphakia, whither we were bound, is the most savage and
inaccessible province of the island, being inhabited largely by
outlaws. These are not brigands, but simply those who have not seen
eye to eye with the police over some such trifle as a missing
sheep. The White Mountains, haunt of the human vampire, here fall
with cataclysmic suddenness to a sea as deep as the middle of the
Pacific. Cleaving these walls of hell, leafless and arid, where the
rippling contours reflect the oblique morning sun in a succession
of strange lights&mdash;"whitewash on coal"&mdash;come titanic
cracks, deep shadow-black, to the very lapping of the water, where
reflection confirms their sinister reality. Down one of them, slit
by some prehistoric tantrum, we travelled by mule; slept that night
in the office of a police-station upon policemen's beds; and rowed
all next day along the devilish ramparts of the sea, till we
reached a tiny church, a mere crumb among the boulders of the beach
and the cliffs above. Here the remnant of a fresco bespoke a
primitive art such as flourished in the churches of Cappadocia.
Some way offshore at this point a fresh spring bubbles to the
surface. But, though we lapped as we swam, till the Mediterranean
was lowered, we could not find it.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we arrived at Aghia Roumeli. The only
inhabitants were the police, who welcomed us particularly for a
basket of new bread that we brought, their only provisions for the
rest of time being a single tin of sardines and half a loaf, green
with mould, which hung in a net from the ceiling. A ruined Turkish
castle, spattered with bullet-marks, dominated a hill up which we
climbed. The police, excited beyond bounds by fresh faces, could
not leave us. And, for our diversion, first destroyed the path by
rolling the boulders of which it was built on top of Mark, who was
beneath; and then, as it grew dark, setting the whole hill on fire.
From the castle we could look down to the Samaria gorge, with the
blue smoke of a tiny village rising at its entrance, and its
interminable walls of rock towering up to the peaks of the range.
That night we slept bedded in the shingle, the waves at our feet, a
cold moon overhead and a threatening whisper in the air. At four,
the hour when men die, we woke. Between the livid sea and the
half-lit cliffs it seemed as though the chill, angry breeze was
bearing the angel of death upon us. Tearing green oranges, and
filling our water-bottle with the burning red wine of the island,
we set off before it was light, accompanied by four policemen,
their dog, and one mule which they had been able to find, despite
the fact that "people round here don't like us."</p>

<p>As dawn broke, the gates of the gorge loomed above
us&mdash;enormous faces of rock scarred in diagonal strata; so that
by looking from side to side it was possible to see how accurately
they would fit together again should a second upheaval ever heal
the wound of the first. Then followed the little valley into which
we had looked the night before, and the village of low brown cabins
shaded with oranges and walnuts. This brought us to the actual neck
of the gorge, a mile long and a thousand feet deep, walls sheer and
in places no more than ten yards apart. In winter the water from
the snows makes this cloven route impassable. To-day its volume had
already swollen to necessitate the use of stepping-stones.</p>

<p>All the time the path was slowly climbing. At length the walls
and the line of sky above them widened, and we found ourselves at
the foot of fresh peaks. Everywhere grew cypresses of all shapes
but their own, disguised as cedars and pines. Surrounding the
church of St. Nicolas, where we rested, are said to be the largest
in the world. And, by comparison with the lesser giants of Athos,
the date of whose planting is known, it seemed not impossible that
these first saw light, as the tale goes, in pre-Christian times.
Here we met a caravan of mules, whose attendants fortunately
directed us off what appeared to be the main path, to the left.
Even the police had never attempted this journey before.</p>

<p>For we were now insinuated by gorge and valley into the heart of
the mountains, at the foot of the Xyloscala. We had risen 2,500
feet; 1,500 more remained to the lowest gap over which we could
return to the north of the island. And the path, discarding
compromise, attacked the escarpment zigzag. The sun beat upon us.
The policemen took frequent rests. And the others waited in turn
for the mule. Feeling that if I stopped it would be for ever, I
reached the top alone. Turning, the view had attained proportions
to which only the Grand Canyon can offer parallel. On the west
towered a sponge-like cliff, the moving mountain, which is always
falling, and where lives the rare Cretan ibex. Below lay the
valley, soft with distant trees, winding in and out the feet of the
hills till, with the beginning of the gorge, they closed in to form
an arena deeper, higher than the eye could compass. Over all the
peaks poured the powdery light of the sun, filling the interior
with a dull, warm haze. Some grouse whirred from my feet. And then
suddenly, as if to emphasise the sheer magnitude, there shot into
the circle of the sky an aeroplane, a purring flea at which the
mountains seemed to shrug and laugh. The British battleships were
in Suda Bay.</p>

<p>Five minutes later I had twisted up between two peaks as close
together as the banks of a road-cutting, and was walking on the
grass of the square mile plateau of Omalo. I fell in with an old
peasant more than six feet high, who asked, as he strode along in
his tall boots with gun and dog, how long a crossing separated
England from France. He gave me rotten crab-apples to eat, which
were sweet and tasted of medlars. As we walked we came on others
sowing their last seeds before the winter; for snow was expected
daily. It was high as Ben Nevis. And from behind a mild hillock,
out of a perfectly clear sky, there suddenly floated a puffy white
cloud, which proceeded to walk sedately across a patch of plough,
wholly obscuring its cultivators from our view.</p>

<p>It was midday. Not till six o'clock did we reach Lakkoi, whither
came a road, and where we rested to eat and drink on a terrace.
Around us chatted the male inhabitants, each sheltered from the
wind in a white woolly capote with a peaked hood; so that the
effect was that of a party of ghostly witches. From here we were
able to telephone for a car. As I sat at the instrument I said to
the police officer:</p>

<p>"We are very tired."</p>

<p>"So," he replied, "am I."</p>

<p>"We've come 40 kilometres from Aghia Roumeli."</p>

<p>"I've been out shooting."</p>

<p>"Shooting what?" I asked. "Wild ibex?"</p>

<p>"No; bad men."</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch15"></a>Chapter XV. BUILT IN THE FOREST</h2>

<p>We were riding, if the moment of our digress be recalled,
between Zographou and Chilandari. It was late in the day, and a
golden glory lapped the feathery canary green of the incense-pines
which lined the path. We were crossing now to the side of the
promontory whither we had originally descended on the first
evening, from Caryes to Iviron. And, as we reached the highest
point of the hills, the whole purple finger of land lay revealed,
floating in a pale sea; the clear-cut capes receding in different
tones like the wings of a theatre; and all leading to the lilac
spire of Athos at the end. Then we descended again to ilexes and
oaks. And the light deepened.</p>

<p>The mules of Zographou, insensitive to the palette of Nature,
were misbehaving. That which bore the luggage, loth to take the
left-hand path rather than the right, dragged the muleteer on his
stomach through the dust, to the ruin of his red beard and national
dress. Rising, he planted himself in mid-road and denounced the
animal with the tones of a Gladstone on the subject of his
Disraeli. Chastened by the moral fervour of this rhetoric, the
cavalcade continued. When David's mule, not to be excelled in
unseemliness, delivered itself of a succession of piercing belches.
That the curious properties of Athonite food should react even on
the lower creations was new to us. Hitherto we had studied their
outcome only at meals and in church. It is to be regretted, in a
questioning age, that the digestive reminiscence as a historic
factor has never been scientifically examined. In Arabian society
it is still the compliment which the host expects from his guest
after a meal. While among the Georgians, reported Busbecq, the
imperial ambassador to Constantinople in the sixteenth century, it
was the method of respectful greeting. St. Simon, when French
ambassador in Spain, had perhaps the classic experience of it,
when, on taking leave of the Infanta whom he had conducted to her
marriage, and asking if she had not any messages for her parents,
she replied from her dais with sounds that completely deranged the
proverbial gravity of the Spanish court. What catastrophic
upheavals may not have hinged, unknown to history, on similar
incidents?</p>

<p>As the darkness drew on, and then settled, we were obliged to
hurry. A light twinkled. But it was twenty minutes more before the
walls and tower of the monastery showed black above us. The gate
was shut. Only silence answered our shouts and hammerings. At last,
however, a wicket opened; and after much expostulation, which on
our side we left to the muleteer, knowing ourselves to be in the
wrong, we were allowed to enter. There was no light. Simply voices
uttered from the stars, whither our possessions were hoisted on a
rope. Finding an entrance in the wall, we followed as we might. And
ultimately reached the lounge-hall of the top flat in an
exceedingly high building. This was comfortably furnished with a
round table, dozens of Windsor chairs, and two to three hundred
engravings of the heroes and heroines of Slav independence in the
Balkans. For Chilandari is a Serbian monastery.</p>

<p>In one corner was a glass-partitioned pantry. Hence emerged a
youthful guest-master carrying refreshments, his tray and its
fittings being of lavishly ornamented silver. Everything bespoke
the care of a competent butler; a pleasurable surprise, for the
ridiculous Czech whom we had met at St. Paul's had curled our toes
with his tales of Chilandari's squalor and inhospitality. Could it
be that Bohemia owed Serbia a political grudge? Our knowledge of
the new Balkans was not sufficient to say whether the two countries
shared a common boundary. But it may have been that his remarks
were inspired by the truth of his experiences; for his was not the
only complaint that reached us.</p>

<p>At dinner, which was not ready, owing to the lateness of our
arrival, till ten o'clock&mdash;eleven and a half hours after we
had last tasted food&mdash;we were joined by another guest, a
German. The first course was a delicious soup which, when the
actual substance of the rank fish from which it was distilled was
avoided, tasted as though of hare. Towards this David gave free
rein to the greed which was now the property of all of us. And Mark
and I, stung to fury, heaped upon him the epithets of corpulence,
ending, as he scraped the tureen, by likening him to Diana of
Ephesus. Whereat the German, hitherto puzzled at the uproar,
understood.</p>

<p>"I see," he interpolated, "you talk of women: <i>he he he Ha Ha
Ha</i> HE HE HE HA! HA! HA!" and launched himself upon our mirth
with the vigour of a Babbitt.</p>

<p>Alone of the Slav, and alone of the inland monasteries,
Chilandari has preserved buildings of antiquity, the majority of
which, if not wholly mediaeval&mdash;for many were damaged in a
fire of 1722&mdash;have been plainly reconstructed on the same
foundations as the older. David, who shares the sea's worries and
was now quit of them, felt his happiest here, and resumed, as
became the surroundings, the life and manner of an English country
gentleman. Work in the church was followed, when Vespers put an end
to it, by a walk round the place before dinner. Game-birds were
plentiful. And the forests in this part contain, besides wild boar,
jackal and deer. Another year we shall borrow the dog pack of our
local hounds for the summer, and bring them out; thus completing,
since there will be pig-sticking and stalking as well, those
amenities of sport on which the sun never sets. We look forward, in
fact, to the day when the Holy Mountain is transformed from the
desultory haunt of artist and penman to a kind of Highland Melton,
resort of English sportsmen, who take the shooting regularly from
the Synod and are glad to run down to Salonica for a week or two
among these decent old dagoes without any damned womenkind fussing
about.</p>

<p>The buildings of Chilandari reflect the woods in which they
stand. Alone on Athos there is found here the mellowness and
harmony of weathered age which we in the North estimate above
pearls, and which is entirely opposed to the Byzantine code of
aesthetics. Throughout prevails the tint and texture of dead
leaves, property of small russet bricks concealed by neither
plaster nor colour-wash. The courtyard is enclosed by a
diamond-shaped perimeter of tall, thin buildings, the ground so
lying that the obtuse angles fall one below the other. At the
higher of these stands the tower, a twelfth century structure of
dignified simplicity, finished with a convex roof instead of the
usual crenellations. To the south, perched up on the foundation
walls, rises the octagonal smokestack of the old kitchen, exactly
resembling those mediaeval survivals of the same office at Eton and
Glastonbury. Below this runs a stream where the sun, filtering
through the leaves of overhanging trees, casts yet further spots on
the hairy backs of domesticated boars. At the end, a miniature
aqueduct, supporting like a military head-dress an impertinent
little cypress, carries water across the ravine to the monastery.
Thither Mark and I were picking our way, he in pursuit of a
swallow-tail butterfly, I of an art view, when the warning patter
of sewage on plane-leaves obliged us to return. In the evening we
went for another walk, and discovered a colony of tortoises.</p>

<p>Within the courtyard the eye is caught by four cypresses, one of
an immense height, surrounding a Turkish baroque phiale. Behind
these stands the thirteenth century church, much decorated with
brick patterns and sculptured plaques. The whole is Slav rather
than Greek in character, the reliefs being flat and lacking that
mastery of design for which Byzantines were conspicuous; and the
ornament, though pleasant in itself, detracting from the
architectural lines. Inside, the frescoes follow the "Macedonian"
iconography, and, dating from the beginning of the fourteenth
century, are earlier than most of those on the Mountain. But,
having been ruthlessly restored a hundred years ago, their artistic
value is almost negligible. None the less, it is extraordinary how
even now, beneath the colours of a Victorian birthday book, the old
spirit has survived in the force of the compositions.</p>

<p>Behind the altar is a remarkable painting of the infant Jesus
recumbent in the paten, the chalice upright at his side. Since this
uncouth vindication of transubstantiation is without inscription,
it may be presumed to record the experience of the ancient monk of
Scetis who was unable to accept this novel doctrine of the fourth
century. His companions having prayed for him, both he and they
repaired to the church. "And when the bread," wrote Palladius not
long after, "was placed on the holy table it appeared to the three
only as a child, and...an angel of the Lord came down from heaven
with a sword and slew the child as a sacrifice, and emptied its
blood into the cup...And as they drew near to partake of the holy
things, there was given to the old man alone, bleeding flesh."[*]
Here is theophagy at its grimmest. Such, no doubt, would Gregory of
Nyssa, the originator of transubstantiation, also have approved,
since in his opinion "it is not possible for anything to come to be
in the body except it be well mixed with the bowels by being eaten
and drunk. Surely, then, it is requisite to receive, in the way
possible to our nature, the power of the Spirit that is to quicken
us." So a large proportion of Christians appear to have thought
ever since. Here, however, was an unwitting memorial to the first
Protestant. A thousand years more were needed before Wycliffe and
Luther should succeed. But even they must have been restored to
faith by such measures.</p>

<blockquote>[* W. F. Adeney: <i>The Greek and Eastern
Churches</i>.]</blockquote>

<p>The floor of the church is a century older than the rest of the
building. It was laid in 1197, and is a superb example of <i>opus
Alexandrinum,</i> marbles of every colour being inlaid round large
figured slabs of greyish green. Contemporary with it was the
foundation of the monastery itself by SS. Symeon and Sabbas. The
former of these was in lay life Stephen Nemanja, King of Serbia.
His second son, Sabbas, called by secret voices to religion, set
off unknown to Athos. Soldiers were sent to retrieve him. But,
taking refuge in Russico, he divested himself of both his hair and
his royal robes, and bade these be returned in his stead. The
result was that King Stephen followed him, and they both settled at
Vatopedi. But Stephen&mdash;or Symeon, as he was now
called&mdash;being the son-in-law of the Byzantine Emperor Alexius
III Angelus, obtained permission to found an independent monastery
for the Serbians. These incidents are depicted on the walls of the
refectory, where they were painted in 1621. In a corner of the
church, behind the stalls, is a magnificent panel under glass,
representing St. Symeon recumbent in his monastic robes. The black
folds are lit with wine-coloured planes and formal lines of gold.
Near his feet stands a group of monks. And the background is formed
by a row of buildings diverse as a city street, and grouped solely
for pictorial purposes, as in a Carpaccio. The inscription is in
both Slav and Greek; and each version states clearly that it dates
from 1780. Its excellence of condition corroborates this. But there
is not a gallery in the world that would not be glad to possess it,
and would not at the same time, but for its inscription, hang it as
contemporary with the earlier Italians. St. Symeon's tomb, though
his body is now elsewhere, lies at the back of the church. Here
grows the famous vine whose grapes bring milk to suckling mothers.
When ripe they are put in the empty sarcophagus to dry, and are
afterwards entrusted to certain Serbian bishops to distribute. The
monks hold them very precious.</p>

<p>The sacristan was a strange little creature, with a pinched
Mongolian face and only a few wartish hairs blossoming on his chin.
He was at much pains to make us feel at home in the church, and
showed us the treasures. Among them the only object of importance
was a portative mosaic of the Virgin about 21 inches by 14; but it
was a crude piece of work, and lacked the genius of colouring and
technique apparent in the others described above.</p>

<p>"Do you come from London?" he asked as we were working.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How far is that from Jerusalem?"</p>

<p>"A week's journey."</p>

<p>"I must go to Jerusalem. How much would it cost from here?"</p>

<p>"&pound;3 10s.," said David, to whom the transport facilities of
Joppa are as familiar as those of Piccadilly Circus.</p>

<p>We, too, decided to visit Jerusalem, though the opportunity has
not yet arisen. There is something that tickles the humour in the
materialisation of cities which have haunted childhood. That of
Pericles is sufficiently entertaining on first sight. But to sip
the night-life of the heavenly city or rattle up the Jericho road
in a 'bus must arouse a delirium of mirth.</p>

<p>Mark, meanwhile, was sketching. To him also came the inevitable
question from a passing father: "Are you from London?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"London, London, aaah"; and, with a dream in his eye and romance
in his voice, he whispered, "Seven millions."</p>

<p>The meals, to our now coarsened palates, were periods of
unclouded enjoyment. The younger guest-master, who had received us
and who spoke only Serbian, presented a character which will one
day carry him to the top of his profession. After a single year on
the Mountain, he already spent his spare time sitting on a stool in
the corner and practising chants that would enable him to sing in
the choir. His hair and beard were red, and his sad and staring
eyes, of watery pastel blue, were vividly contrasted thereby. These
facial characteristics were so accentuated by Mark's pencil and
paint that he exclaimed: "Have I really become like this in a
year?" and begged that he might be allowed to sit again with the
added dignity of gown and veil. His efficiency was remarkable.
Automatically he came to fill that intricate receptacle, the
syphon, and place it on the table before each meal. We were saying,
in fact, as we picked our red mullet, that life in England would
plainly be no longer tolerable without a monkish butler, when the
edge was taken from our appetite by a resounding snort, followed by
the opening of a window and a sound of prolonged extrusion.</p>

<p>There sat at dinner with us on this occasion a Salonican
photographer, born, he hastened to say, near Sparta, who was making
an album. The album has retained its prestige in the Levant; for it
is the photographs that are taken to fill the album, not the album
bought to contain the photographs. The guest-master having, on the
close of his operations, left the window open, we enquired, knowing
the sensitiveness of those who live in hot countries, if the
photographer would like it shut.</p>

<p>"I?" he said. "Mind the cold? I was nine years in the army.
Soldiers don't mind the cold.</p>

<p>"I am a captain," he added suddenly.</p>

<p>Mark, understanding the words "I am," for some reason took it
into his head that the honourable designation of rank "[<i>Greek
characters</i>]," meant "tipsy." And there followed the disgusting
exhibition of his tapping nose and forehead at the insulted
officer, accompanying his gestures with assurances of sympathetic
comprehension of his state and a gleeful leer as he passed him the
decanter. The unfortunate man was not slow to demonstrate that he
could at least rid himself of our company with unfaltering
motion.</p>

<p>It seemed, in such spare time as offered, that this of all
monasteries must lend itself to my inept but persevering pencil. As
I was setting off up the hill, an old monk called from an upper
window and begged me to put out my cigarette. I did. And found, on
ascent, that the whole of the farther side was a tangle of
blackened roots. It was easy to imagine the danger from fire to a
monastery set among the trees as this one was. The path, as I
continued, disappeared. And I perforce went on all fours up a
perpendicular stream-bed. At the top, surrounded by trees, it was
impossible to obtain even a glimpse of the monastery. The sloping
ground was slippery with dead leaves, and every strand of
vegetation to which I clung shot barbed spines into my hands. At
length I reached a gap torn by three fallen pine-trees. And here I
sat a whole happy afternoon and evening, kept company by a sociable
though pugnacious wasp.</p>

<p>On our last night, David and I lounged on the steps of the
guest-house discussing the future and the possibilities of the pen.
For the public at large David expressed a profound contempt. It was
his aim, he said, to produce books of such expense and erudition
that they should actually repel it. I, on the contrary, suggested
that even contemporary public opinion was probably a better judge
of lasting value than those artificial cliques which, sensibly
enough from the point of view of their own finance, were strangling
British intellect. This led us to the novel, an ulterior goal. And
we agreed that if ever a great novel, to rank with Shakespeare,
Velasquez, and Beethoven, could be written, it is now. Only now are
we learning to probe the unreasoning machinery of the human mind.
And now, for the first time, man holds the world in his palm,
placed there by mechanised transport. It remains for an artist to
leave posterity a picture, not of dialects or tribes, countries or
continents, but of the globe of the twentieth century. For the
longer the opportunity lasts, the less worth while will it be.
Western civilisation is becoming universal, the race a homogeneous
one. And before we die, half the variety of the picture will be
gone; as if a showman had sold his swing-boats, his hoop-las, his
fat woman, and even his merry-go-round, and invested the proceeds
in one superlative chairoplane. The view is enlarged, the motion
more poignant. And then: all is dull.</p>

<p>The night itself was peaceless. Dinner was interrupted by Mark's
discovering, on returning to fetch the chutney, an unfamiliar
layman examining our tooth-cleansers and poking in our
shaving-creams. David later developed; and, as usual, left the
plates in the sink beneath a running tap. I was sitting at a book
in the lounge-hall when, unexpectedly as a ghost, a very old monk
picked away the oil lamp. I seized it from him. But he looked so
piteous that I returned it and sat in the dark. To my unspeakable
rage, he tottered slowly down the passage to the sink and turned
off the tap. Luckily David at that moment returned to his
guard.</p>

<p>Outside blew a great wind. At two o'clock we were awakened by
the sound of David's window, opened for the first time since
construction, bursting into fragments on the courtyard below. Nor
did we sleep thereafter. For the grunts and whistles of the storm
were broken by a carillon of bells pealed in mysterious
semi-oriental conjunctions, the rhythm slackening and quickening,
till, fortified by a new gong-like note, they reached a climax
reminiscent of Prokoviev's industrial ballet, the <i>Pas
d'Acier.</i> Combined with the wind and the rattle of casements
high up in this lovely, tree-girt monastery, the sound caught the
emotions in the waking dark with the force of tragedy.</p>

<p>It appeared in the morning that so great was the distance to
Vatopedi, our day's objective, that we must start at ten o'clock.
At eleven we reached Esphigmenou, a monastery actually lapped, when
the sea is rough, by the waves. Here we were more or less expected,
as one of the monks had visited Chilandari during our stay there
and begged us to choose to-day for our visit, since it was a feast
and there would be fish. The guest-master was the most winning and
fatherly of old men, and implored us to stay the night.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," he cried, "you will be punctual for lunch in an hour's
time, won't you? Yes, you can bathe now...everyone is
asleep"(!)</p>

<p>The buildings, though almost entirely modern, formed a pleasant
group, and were fringed with a profusion of bright flowers such as
we did not see elsewhere. Dr. Covel tells of a font that he saw in
1677, fourteen feet across and hewn from a single block of
porphyry. Of this magnificent object we discovered no trace. The
chief treasure is a piece of cloth of gold, once the property of
Napoleon, and variously described as either from the tent that he
used on the Moscow campaign or from one of his coronation robes.
The latter seems the more likely. One account states that it was
stolen by pirates and presented by them to the monastery; another,
that it was bought by a member of the community in Vienna. Of the
many and diverse objects held in veneration on the Mountain, this
perhaps is the most curious. It is only exhibited on the most
important feast-days. Unfortunately, the abbot was asleep, and as
he keeps its key, and we were unable to stay the night, we could
not attempt to identify it.</p>

<p>Our bathe&mdash;the first since we left Docheiariou nearly a
week ago&mdash;was ecstatic. After lunch we were put to rest in a
large and grandly furnished room. Seeing a number of beds newly
made, we feared to disturb them, and lay on the divans instead.
Upon which the guest-master, entering with drinking-water, asked us
if we thought the beds were not clean. "Too clean," we replied,
"for our dirty clothes." Indeed, his kindness made us wish we could
stay. But if the mules were to be back by dark, it was already time
to start.</p>

<p>The ride lasted three hours. We had now reached the north-east
coast, and were moving directly down the peninsula in the direction
we had originally gone. In the distance rose the summit. And from
it came wave on wave of wooded land towards us. High above great
cliffs, we threaded through the tree-heather. Until across a bay
was visible the clustering group of Vatopedi, largest and richest
of all the monasteries, domes, towers, roofs and turrets climbing,
within their walls from the water's edge like one of those
imaginary cities on an old map compressed to suit the requirements
of the cartographer. A man on a pony, galloping like a Delacroix
warrior up and down the cobbles, overtook us. Thus we rode
throughout the hot afternoon, the last lap in our circuit of the
Mountain.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch16"></a>Chapter XVI. THE BEAUTY OF WEALTH</h2>

<p>At Vatopedi we have arrived as it were in Rome from the hill
towns, in London from the provinces, in Europe&mdash;or, as the
case may be, America&mdash;from the other continents. No longer the
perpetual welcome and good-bye, the clatter of hoofs and the thud
of the oars to pen the days in twos and threes; no longer the echo
of our planet silenced by the crags and trees and the self-sung
sea. We have stepped into pomp and leisure, where reminders of the
world and age that bore us are not absent, where the contact of
mortals is again upon us. This is the temporality of Athos. And the
joyousness of life is twice incarnate.</p>

<p>The <i>salon</i> of the guest-suite immediately gives indication
of the change. But for the stove, it is an ordinary room. Couches
of brocade upholstery lie along the walls beneath pleasant and
sometimes ancient prints. Above the centre table hangs a grandiose
ormolu lamp for paraffin, to which has been attached the less
decorative white glass shades of electric light. The floor is
covered with strips of thick garter-blue carpet, on which are
blazoned in continuous recurrence the crown and eagles of the
Orthodox Church, together with the cipher of the monastery, "IMB,"
for "[<i>Greek characters</i>]." This was originally woven for the
reception of a visiting Tsar, and is said to have sheltered his
august feet the whole way from the sea to the entrance. Prince
Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, also on one occasion accepted the
monastery's hospitality, though tradition has it to have been
Edward, Prince of Wales. Other than Daphni, Vatopedi possesses the
only natural harbour on the Mountain; and, before the steamers
called regularly, travellers often landed here. One and all have
borne witness to the numerous cannon with which the walls were
defended, those at the entrance being mounted. These weapons,
however, were removed at the time of the Revolution. And to this
day may be seen the door-knocker into which the Virgin of the time
shrivelled the pet bitch of a Turkish officer, brought hither to
challenge her supremacy.</p>

<p>Having drunk our drinks, swallowed our <i>glyco,</i> and
discovered that my devoted Adrian is away at Salonica, we descend
to bathe. As we lie sleepily on the fine shingle of the extended,
curving beach, we are conscious first that the sun is setting, and
then that it has never set in quite this manner before. Sunsets
are, often as not, as ugly as the paintings which represent them.
To-night the very achievement of colour, gems, birds' breasts, the
Pala d'oro, Holman Hunt's bubbles, makes irrelevant the verdict of
aesthetics. Drawn out of the west come flaring, ragged arcs of
cloud, a wild, luminous pink against a sky of bonfire flames. On
the horizon lies Thasos, violet; in front, the sea, hot red-purple
of cinerarias, bounces polka-wise a ship in gilded sail. Near at
hand the ridges of the promontory take the colour of indelible ink.
And over them, falling down to the hills in the east, the sky is a
bluey-green writhing with glass-gold clouds. Bluey-green refracts
on the cineraria sea, catching each unnumbered ripple like the
shooting of a petticoat. The pink in the west goes dark, the clouds
black. Then all fades, to reveal the stars. And we are left in the
night, literally short of breath.</p>

<p>As we return to the monastery the electric lights are in full
glow, and the buildings resound to the clang of the plant. To us,
seated at the top of the upward-sloping courtyard, window upon
window reveals the unending blocks, in truth as well as metaphor a
walled town, one of those great composite institutions with which
the Byzantines endowed their poor, their sick, and their religious.
An old monk, passing, fetches us a plate of grapes from his cell.
The lights glitter. Clang and clang, the engine rivets the scene on
senses other than the sight. At dinner, still it throbs. Till at
ten o'clock comes a fading of lights, a softening of noise, and
then suddenly a definite good night. Next evening the engineer got
drunk and broke his leg. We lit the ormolu lamp instead.</p>

<p>On our first morning we sent as usual to the monastery council
to ask permission to begin our work in the church. They replied
that unfortunately it was the last day of the grape-harvest. And
that though to-morrow no pains should be spared to assist us,
to-day the sacristan and all his fellows were needed in the fields.
The guest-master, who had taken our message, had two assistants.
The lesser of these was a layman named Haralambos, pudding-faced
but mystic.</p>

<p>"I don't like 'outside,'" he said. "I was in the army thirteen
years. I fought with the English at Do&iuml;ran and received an
English medal. Later, I shall probably become a monk."</p>

<p>The other was Father Aristarchus, of a very different
temperament: a thickly built, athletic young man with a curly brown
beard. He suggested, as there was an idle day in front of us, that
I should accompany him up to the vineyards.</p>

<p>I fetched my cigarettes. He donned a white linen sandboy's hat,
and was joined by a friend wearing a broad straw, which,
surmounting as it did, a tied bunch of chestnut hair reaching to
his waist and a tight-fitting cassock, produced the effect of a
Victorian schoolgirl in a crocodile. Each carried a basket and a
miniature sickle; I suggested I might do likewise, but, being the
honoured visitor, was not allowed.</p>

<p>On the way up we inspected the press. This took the form of a
long stone warehouse, dark within, and filled with enormous vats,
twelve feet in diameter, sunk in the floor. In these the grapes,
brought down by mule, are delivered to the triple-knived poles of
white ghouls who stand at the edge and prod. They are then trodden
with gum-boots and the wine run off. From the residue of pips and
skins is boiled the life-giving <i>ouzo.</i></p>

<p>Continuing up shady paths, we came within sound and then sight
of the harvesters. Harvesters was indeed the word. But for the
lines of green bushes, scarcely different from the currant, it
might have been an August day on a large English farm. A crowd of
workers, mostly boys, had come from the mainland to assist. With
them the monks, every shade of beard emerging from every variety of
hat, swayed among the leaves in a doubled mass, shouting and
singing to the beating of barrels by the waiting muleteers. We had
halted at the lunch rendezvous. In the spotted shadow cast by a
fairy ring of cypresses stood a stupendous pan, big as a table-top,
above a pyramid of white embers. Into this a tall greybeard was
heaping beans and garlic as fast as his hands could throw them.
Around lounged other monks. I sat down on a bank, while Aristarchus
disappeared into a small stone house. From this he bore
ceremoniously upon a plate <i>ouzo</i> and a glass of water.</p>

<p>"A drink, sir," he said, in those actual words. He then
proceeded to outline his life. From this and subsequent
conversations resulted a tale of the modern Levant from the
unexpected viewpoint of the practical man.</p>

<p>English he had learnt as a sailor, in which capacity he had
sojourned some weeks in Cardiff. But, in a land where many people
speak American, it was the manner, not the language, that counted.
This he had acquired on a yacht belonging to an English colonel
resident in Constantinople.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," was now his daily greeting to us, with a
touch of his holy black hat. He knew, too, that no Englishman could
begin the day without breakfast, and a table fully laid with
napkins, knives, forks, slices of bread, and that precious preserve
jam, was always set ready to greet our demure sardines. Nor, when
some early appointment demanded, would he allow us to forgo the
meal. It happened later, on return from the vineyards, that David
was discovered to have set off to Caryes for letters.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Father Aristarchus, "I'm sure I don't know
what Mr. Rice is going to do about his lunch."</p>

<p>Aristarchus' manners were, without exception, the most
impressive monument to British civilisation that I have met.</p>

<p>Born in the island of Samos, he was one of fourteen children.
His mother, not content with this feat, adopted yet a fifteenth, a
bastard in a blanket which she discovered on the church doorstep.
To-day all his sisters were dead. (Mark interrupted at this point
with a bright, "I've got two sisters too!") And only five of the
brothers were left, one having been killed in the war, near Angora.
Of the survivors, one had become a monk at Docheiariou. And it was
he who had persuaded Aristarchus to adopt his present vocation when
all else failed. All else had failed. During the war his father,
once rich, was reduced to poverty. Further, he had remarried an
unsympathetic stepmother. Aristarchus himself had previously saved
enough money to open a shop of his own in Constantinople. Then,
being an exchangeable Greek, everything was confiscated by the
Turks. The girl to whom he was engaged had thrown him over. And he
had gone to fight in Asia Minor. There he had lost the few
possessions&mdash;camera and watch&mdash;that still remained to
him, and finally, as a last cruelty, the book containing the
addresses of his English friends. Homeless, owing to the
stepmother, and aghast at his misfortune, he had sought his
brother. But now, after two years on the Mountain, hope had
revived.</p>

<p>"I want to get away from here," he said.</p>

<p>His plan was to save 7,000 drachmas&mdash;about &pound;18. This
would take him across the Atlantic. Could he find work in England?
I thought not. He earned now 3,000 drachmas a year&mdash;2,000 for
his work as assistant guest-master, 1,000 for tending and ringing
the bells in the campanile. Vatopedi, being idiorhythmic, pays
these not extensive wages to those whose labours maintain the life
of the monastery.</p>

<p>"I don't care for monks," he continued. "They say I oughtn't to
have pyjamas and mosquito-nets, because proper monks don't. Every
morning I wash my face; but I never can feel clean with this beard.
I don't want to cook and sew for myself. I want to go outside and
find a wife to do those things, and make me a family. In Canada I
shall go to night schools and learn to write English. I can't do
that well enough yet. I want two or three pounds a week, so's I can
go to the cinema once a month.</p>

<p>"If I did stay here," he added, "I should like to be porter.
Then I could sell what I like and make a little money."</p>

<p>The porter's lodge at most monasteries dispenses necessities and
a few lesser luxuries. At Vatopedi we bought some toffee, and also
a tin of boot-polish of that remarkable mauve hue which has lately
been affected by the sartorial <i>&eacute;lite</i> of English
youth.</p>

<p>Aristarchus then reverted to his initiation as a monk. For a
whole year he had been on probation in ordinary clothes, proving
the genuineness of his call to the religious life by assisting to
clean the church and undertaking any jobs that might offer. At
length, surrounded by chanting fathers, he had stood in the middle
of the church in shirt and pants to receive his robes. For the
first year he had worked altogether in the church, and hated it.
Now even mastering guests was too hard. What he meant was that it
was too boring, that it gave no scope to his individual ambition.
Soon, when he had enough money, he would be gone. Here at Vatopedi
it was easy enough. You could always obtain passes up to six months
to visit the mainland on business or to see friends. And even these
might be renewed. In cenobitic monasteries, of course, it was
impossible. And if they did turn you out, having no property, you
were destitute. That would not happen to him. Would I give him my
address, in case he ever reached England?</p>

<p>Certainly the world will know Aristarchus again.</p>

<p>Returning to the monastery munching from a handkerchief of
grapes, I wandered slowly up the flagged slope of the court, buoyed
on a flawless satiety of colour. Here, within this precinct four or
five acres in extent, the artist sense of monkish generations
seemed to have flowered its fullest; as, indeed, became this
sheltered bay and its enclosing slopes of red cultivated earth. Yet
despite the unceasing variety of architectural style and function;
despite the disparity of nine centuries between contiguous
buildings; no confusion, no studied diversity of period and period
copy, broke the harmony. Underlying all, a single principle of
colour-relation brought unity&mdash;a principle psychologically
Byzantine, and standing in direct antecedence to that which rules
in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>It will be recalled from those numerous hours devoted in past
years at school to compulsory science, that if a ring of pink paper
be placed upon a sheet of white, and gazed at, the white will
eventually turn green. In the same way as that green, the colours
of modern painting are non-existent. It is not of their own virtue
that they strike the retina, but of their neighbours', who push
them to it. Thus by the use of the dullest tones the most brilliant
effects are obtained. And when, perhaps inadvertently, a bright
tone of an inherently bright colour is employed in conjunction with
complementary shades, the result may be such that the human eye
involuntarily turns away, as from a bright light. This is something
more than "crude," an adjective which implies an affection of the
stomach rather than the optic nerve. It is the result of intention,
something deeper than the gaudy taste of savages. That intention is
not only to strike the eyes, but to leave within the brain an image
that cannot fade.</p>

<p>This method of coloration is the outcome of that deliberate
exploitation of mental processes practised in the present age. It
is not sufficient to express this or that conviction full blown.
Every stage of its genesis and expansion is fit material for the
artist. Thus, analogous to this sifting of the mind's fundamental
machinery, is the use of primary basic colours. Instead of blurring
the paints with a prevailing tint, and presenting on the canvas a
mellow, ready-made harmony, the modern artist seeks to clarify the
elements of his picture, to create the harmony, not once, but a
thousand times, in the perpetually shifting transition between the
eye and the interplaying colours. Such a system, such a thing as a
clean flat plane of one shade, must have seemed as indecent to
Titian, had he seen it, as James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> to the
author of that emotional hoax, <i>Hamlet.</i></p>

<p>But before the age of Titian, before the Renaissance-Classical
era, there existed, especially in Eastern Europe whence all
mediaeval culture came, a state of mind similar in many respects to
our own. Preponderantly it was the aim of Byzantine art to
represent not matter but emotion; and, further, to express it with
such vigour as to stamp its message ineffaceably on the memory of
the beholder. All emotion in those times was ultimately diverted to
the channels of religion. And the Byzantine artist was as anxious
to seek artistic expression for the mystic convolutions of his
intellect as the modern for his analyses. Thus, though subject
differs, the elements, form, line, and colour have remained akin.
In architectural context, Athonite form and line have been
discussed (cf. Chapter X). When it is remembered that Athos not
only was Byzantine, but is, the colours of the buildings in
addition add another wave to the creative affinity between
ourselves and the mediaeval Greeks.</p>

<p>It has been attempted, at the cost of iteration, to picture, as
the circuit of the Mountain has revealed them, the ornaments of the
different monasteries. As the landscape varies, so, it seems, have
they. Thus the Lavra, old and storm-beaten, coats its church in
crimson-tinted wallflower, withered and dying, while over the
refectory door presides the grey and blue Virgin, hard and austere.
Thus Chilandari, warm and soft, reflects the forest leaves of its
environment. Thus Dionysiou, grey and ascetic on its cliff-hung
crag, attains the final fantasy in a church of pillar-box
vermilion. In the mind of the reader confusion has
resulted&mdash;confusion which assails the visitor himself at first
contact, and to which colour alone holds the map. For, of these
innumerable walls, this is not old and that young, this Greek and
that Turkish. Each is a clear, smooth province, each a unit in a
vast cycle of architectural complexion, each reacting on its
neighbour and contributing to the annihilation of that mellow
textural beauty for which we northerners treasure the passing of
centuries. To monks emotionally transfixed upon the future, the
neutral contentment of age is no virtue. Often the oldest
buildings, being the most important, preserve the most unflinching
novelty. While the new grow old. And the whole, instead of
remaining like our Oxford and Cambridge colleagues, a haphazard
collection of clashing styles, is welded to a single artistic unity
by the use of the traditional washes on buildings whose disparity
of age may amount to a millennium.</p>

<p>But it is at Vatopedi that the whole gamut of colour seems to
have coalesced in one gorgeous <i>ensemble.</i> Nowhere are the
tones so luxuriant, nor the principle of their application so
clear. Loth to lose the detail of its composition in a memory
replete with the glory of the whole, I made a plan. And from this
can still picture to myself the vivid magnificence of the scene:
the violent contrast of the snow-white campanile against the
fevered, rust-coloured church, smooth as silken velvet; the
northern range of buildings, light red and grey, their roofs
covered with lichen of daffodil-yellow and sprouting hosts of tall
white chimneys against the blue bay below; the high, curving rows
of cells at the foot of the hills behind, forming a background to
the exquisite pink chapel of the Holy Girdle near the gate, rising
as a ship on a wave from the sloping grass-grown flags; everywhere
the inevitable Greek blue, that chalky bluebell blue, covering
shutters and window-sills, outlining white buildings to make them
colder, strawberry ones to make them hotter; and over <i>all</i>
the sun flashing on the leaded cupolas and glittering down the lead
ribs of the cones atop the towers. In this lead roofing Byzantine
building has excelled. With no abruptness, yet without the
ostentation of a definite pitch, the vertical lines of the
structure are brought gently to rest, and its colours no wit
disturbed by that soft grey which slowly gleams and fades as the
sun moves over the heavens.</p>

<p>Upon a hill above the monastery lies a many-windowed ruin
overgrown with elders and wild figs, which is known as the
Athonias. This was formerly a school, which was founded in the
middle of the eighteenth century, when the Greek world was
experiencing that revival in wealth and letters which preceded the
Revolution. The prime movers in this attempt to provide the
Mountain with that which it must always lack, a material <i>raison
d'&ecirc;tre,</i> were the abbot Meletios of Vatopedi and the
Patriarch Cyril V. To its headmastership was summoned the noted
scholar Eugenius Bulgaris; cells for 170 students were provided;
and from Germany, Austria, and Russia, besides the Ottoman Empire,
they flocked to learn in the traditional home of learning. But the
school was partly under lay supervision; and the curriculum soared
beyond the confines of mediaeval ecclesiastics. Hence it became an
object of detestation to the monks, who cast such aspersions on the
morals of the headmaster that he sought an asylum in the Crimea,
invited thither by Catherine the Great. She, like her distant
predecessors of Kiev and Novgorod, was anxious to attract Greeks
and Greek culture to the south of Russia. But her efforts were
neutralised by those of her subjects, who starved the new colonists
into flight. Meanwhile the career of the school, that brief shout
of youth in the fastness of beards and miracles, was finally closed
by the simple expedient of arson. Untouched since, it lay before me
long and desolate as I climbed between the olives in the hot
afternoon. But a thorough inspection revealed that it possessed no
single feature of interest. Returning along the flat tops of stone
walls to avoid the dust, I found David fresh from Caryes, boasting
of a lunch off meat and beer. Aristarchus settled us to a cocktail
on the balcony. But hardly had the glasses touched our lips than
there bore upon us the vanguard of that social maelstrom in which
our last ten days on the Mountain were to be engulfed.</p>

<p>Its hats we had already noted upon the couch, speaking, as hats
do, of hellish possibilities: one, antique in pattern, companion to
a cape; the other, taut and French, impregnated with brilliantine.
Behold now their masters: Professor Papastratos, our acquaintance
of Xenophontos, white-moustached and decrepit, occupant of 1,000
capes; and young Mr. Botzaris, an Athenian dandy, owner of a famous
name and possessing fluent English. With them came the
<i>epitropos</i> Cosmas, of entrancing rotundity, who made us many
apologies for our work's interruption by the grape-harvest. All
together we sat drinking on the balcony in the dark and smoking the
cigarettes which the <i>epitropos</i> commanded. David and I
discussed Oxford in a corner. David, whose researches in
anthropology&mdash;anthropophagy it should have been&mdash;had
procured him a minor fellowship, rose in chivalrous defence of the
Alma Mater to whose alimentary cord he was still attached. I, who
had approached my first term full of historical promise and
resolution, ventured to question how far the broader culture was
likely to be imparted by men whose lives were given wholly to the
study of the Anglo-Saxon village; and how it was to be expected
that any person with an average sense of the passing of time should
devote three precious years to the memorising of facts as little
relative to the origins of our present civilisation, and the
evolution of a historical philosophy, as an early Bradshaw. David
replied meekly that he for his part had found the anthropological
instruction absorbing. We then moved to the neutral ground of
metaphysics, and fell into handclasps of agreement on the subject
of those acquaintances whom we had known to have sought a guiding
principle in life from the great thinkers. Either they had become
demented, or were now teaching the genitive of table to boys under
thirteen. I admitted to David's taunts that a sense of filial duty
had provoked me to qualify for a degree. But defended myself in as
much as I had not had it conferred, and had reclaimed with avidity
the &pound;12 which my college had held over to that end. Did I,
then, maintain that an Oxford career was barren? No; each unborn
son should enjoy one, but conditionally on his displaying a mental
activity independent of the mannerised sophistries of his
preceptors. Years later, I foresee, this passage will be hailed
from obscurity and the gates closed against him.</p>

<p>As the professor and the dandy were staying only a short time, a
joint tour of the monastery was arranged for the following morning.
We assembled first to drink coffee in the common-room of the
Synodico, the council-house, where the monks gather at seven
o'clock after the morning service. It was here, paralysed with
fear, that I had been formally introduced my second day on the
Mountain thirteen months ago. The rooms were comfortably and
normally furnished, and bore a pleasant air of nineteenth century
gaiety. We sat, as usual, on a balcony, ironwork of Greek blue
against the burnt strawberry walls, with the trumpets of morning
glory and dry purple everlastings growing from boxes. Below, the
sea lay like a pearl in the morning light. Only the derricks of a
two-masted schooner could be heard creaking sacks of corn into a
row-boat. Beside us the <i>epitropos</i> Cosmas added the radiance
of his presence. Papastratos and Botzaris emitted information.</p>

<p>At length we started. On the way down the professor slipped and
hurt his arm. Botzaris boasted of an <i>eicon</i> he had bought at
the Russian <i>skiti</i> of the Prophet Elias for 6&frac12;d. Our
lack of enthusiasm when he told us it was a copy hurt him.</p>

<p>First we visited the refectory, a late eighteenth century
building, decorated in panels like the Piccolomini library at
Siena. Adjoining was the buttery, stacked with ancient platters and
mugs of silvered copper. While the others were examining an old
print, David and I slunk away to the church.</p>

<p>This building, which was erected, like that of the Lavra,
towards the end of the tenth century, exhibits the finest interior
on the Mountain. It is very large&mdash;so large that David stood
aghast at the task that lay before him. And the frescoes, painted
by a master of the Macedonian school in 1312, are, with the
exception of haloes, lettering, and occasional figures necessitated
by the cracking of the plaster, unrestored. An extraordinary beauty
pervades the whole, a kind of cold, misty light, shadowless and
unbegotten, such as floats about London railway termini on Sunday
mornings and constitutes the glory of St. Sophia. Spreading over
the high vaultings and walls, the traditional scenes from the life
of Christ are depicted on an immense scale. Most prominent are the
Crucifixion where the delicately balanced resignation of the Christ
contrasts with the rigid grief of the watching women; and the entry
into Jerusalem, grey and blue broken by the red roofs of the town,
with the background half filled by a tree, forerunner of Van Gogh,
mobile with the emotion of the occasion.</p>

<p>Several days we spent in this church, watching the beams of the
sun move slowly over the detail of buildings and figures, conjuring
their beauty to full revelation, then leaving them to sink again
into their mysterious world of long dead ink, where the eye must
concentrate for minutes at a time to bring them out of hiding. And
if the eye, how much longer the camera? Ladders of enormous
dimensions were brought from a stack at the end of the
<i>narthex,</i> with which Aristarchus, our self-appointed
body-servant, set the corona and all the chandeliers a-swinging in
order to display his detestation of the holy place. But worse even
than these fittings, the shafts of sunlight offered insurmountable
obstruction. While some were necessary to light the church at all,
one invariably thrust obliquely straight across the lens. We had
almost given up hope of the large Crucifixion when Aristarchus,
hurrying by unknown paths to the dome, nailed his gown over the
offending inlet. Then, borrowing other gowns, he and I ran with
ladders round the outside, adorning each window with these
cr&ecirc;pe draperies. Even these were not sufficient; and finally
my green dressing-gown was requisitioned to strike an ultimate
<i>cri</i> upon the rust-coloured walls.</p>

<p>The floor, which is of the same nature as that of Chilandari,
would seem by its unevenness of surface to be even older, and
probably contemporary with the foundation of the church.
Outstanding in the design are the large slabs of heavily figured
pink marble bordered with dark green, the combination of which,
both in colour and marking, much resembles tongue and spinach. From
this rise four monolith columns of grey granite, the main supports
of the building, and bound head and foot in brass. While the church
of the Lavra, the only one which approaches this in magnificence,
is disfigured by a screen of modern grey marble, here the
furnishings are all old; the <i>eiconostasis</i> of wood minutely
carved and gilded; the abbot's throne, dated 1619, of similar
workmanship; and the main doors of ivory inlay&mdash;a craft
temporarily unpleasing to eyes jaundiced by the imports of
Anglo-Indian relatives, but in its setting decorative. These were
finished in 1567, "the work of Lawrence and Joseph." Giving on to
the courtyard are another pair of doors plated in early bronze
reliefs, and said to have been brought from St. Sophia in Salonica.
Both within the church and the cloister that abuts are various
mosaics. Those within consist of two pairs of panels of the
Annunciation, the Angel and the Virgin facing one another twice
over in different parts of the church. One pair is coarse in
execution and undeniably ugly; the other undistinguished. But in
the semicircular <i>tympanum</i> over the door leading from the
outer to the inner <i>narthex is</i> a very fine group of Christ
enthroned at the Last Judgment between the Virgin and St. John the
Baptist. Both from its technique and the evidence of a dedicatory
inscription, this appears to belong to the eleventh century.</p>

<p>As we moved pleasurably round this sanctuary, there joined us
the rest of the party, including Mark. With them came the priest
and keeper of the treasures, a tall, intelligent monk whom we had
met last year and who was now writing a book on the church and its
possessions. Of the reliquaries and <i>eicons</i> that he showed
us, it requires a more specialised study than we were able to give,
to write in detail. Vatopedi has always been celebrated for its
<i>objets d'art.</i> Dr. Covel has left a glittering account of the
collection in the seventeenth century, mentioning, among other
things, an <i>epitaphion,</i> the banner of the recumbent Christ
that is carried in procession on Good Friday, carrying 12,000
dollars&mdash;&pound;3,000&mdash;worth of pearls. This was
doubtless looted in the Revolution, when much of the metal work
also disappeared, either into the pockets of the Turkish soldiers
or to be melted down for the national cause.</p>

<p>Directly behind the altar hangs the most revered of all the
<i>eicons</i>, a <i>Panaghia,</i> and its renowned candle. These
were thrown down a well during the Arab invasions of the tenth
century, and, on their being retrieved, it was found that the
candle was still alight. Thus it has remained ever since, a bolster
of wax like a small sapling, and was seen by Dr. Covel in 1677 as
by us. The picture itself is sheathed with successive plates of
metal elaborately wrought in different ages. But along the bottom
and up one side runs a series of small reliefs, scarcely two inches
square and solid gold, which are, without question, of the very
finest Byzantine workmanship. There is a breadth of treatment,
maintenance of textural individuality, and strength of composition
almost magical in such small spaces, where all but the greatest
craftsmen would have confined their effort to the achievement of a
graceful pattern and no more. It may be supposed that this
continued insistence on the importance of all genuinely Byzantine
work that dates from before the fall of Constantinople is due to
personal mania. But its significance may be judged from the last
two acquisitions in this province of the South Kensington and
British Museums: an ivory panel of the eleventh and twelfth
century, 8&frac12; inches by 6; and a circular enamelled reliquary
of the same date, 1&frac14; inches in diameter; these two objects
cost &pound;1,200 apiece. Fine as they are, in the treasuries of
the Holy Mountain their eminence would be small. The auction value,
in crude terms, of many of the objects described in this book can
be counted only in thousands and tens of thousands of pounds.</p>

<p>From a cupboard in the wall what is perhaps the most famous
relic on the whole Mountain was now produced: the piece of the
Virgin's Girdle presented to the monastery in the fourteenth
century by King Lazar I of Serbia. This miraculous snippet of
camel's hair&mdash;"she made it herself, I expect," remarked a
monk&mdash;used habitually to be transported, and presumably still
is when occasion arises, to the plague-stricken towns of the Near
East; where even European writers have testified to its arrestation
of the pestilence. There accompanied it now an old Serbian cross
set with cornelians and four broad crystals, and presented by
"Stephen and Lazar."</p>

<p>In a glass-fronted hanging cabinet other treasures were ranged
on shelves. There were three portable mosaics, about 8 inches high
each, representing the Crucifixion, St. John Chrysostom, and St.
Anne and the Virgin. The last of these, though much earlier than
the sixteenth century, was a gift from the Tsarina Anastasia, wife
of Ivan the Terrible. Their fineness was such that it was necessary
to peer closely to make sure that they were mosaic. Beside them
stood two reliefs of about the same size in steatite, a composition
marble, one of St. George, the other of scenes from the life of
Christ. And thus, indeed, it would be possible to continue through
every corner of the church; to dilate upon the painted
<i>eicons;</i> upon the silvered <i>Panaghia</i> said to have been
brought from St. Sophia in Constantinople; and upon the half-length
of Christ blessing Peter and Paul, metalled and enamelled, and
presented by that despot, Andronicus Palaeologus, son of the
Emperor Manuel II, who sold Salonica to the Venetians in 1423. But
in the whole collection one object stands alone. This is the cup
bestowed on the monastery by Manuel Cantacuzene, son of the Emperor
of that name, who was despot of Mistra from 1349 to 1380. Standing
about 10 inches high, it consists of a broad bowl of transparent,
gold-flecked jasper, yellow, dark green, and red, which is mounted
on a thick octagonal stalk of silver-gilt. From a bulge in the
centre of this, two rhythmic tapering dragons spring off at a
tangent, until, taking an acute-angle turn, they come to rest upon
the metal rim, wings folded, heads supported by little pairs of
clutching claws. The base is also octagonal. And on every other
facet are chased the circular monograms of the donor: Manuel;
Despot; Cantacuzene; Palaeologus.</p>

<p>The last name is accounted for by Manuel's grandmother having
been a Palaeologina. I had spoken so much of this cup, that Mark
and David could not conceal their distaste for it.</p>

<p>We then moved to the <i>narthex</i> to inspect the miraculous
picture of the Virgin whence blood had been drawn by the blow of an
angry deacon. He had been late for supper, and having been refused
his commons, could contain his resentment against a controlling
deity no longer. Stricken with remorse after the act, he ensconced
himself in a dark corner opposite the affronted Mother of God,
where he remained for the rest of his life&mdash;30 years. The
offending arm had been immediately withered. And the bones of the
limb are still contained in a glass-lidded box placed at the foot
of the picture in eternal supplication. They seemed of considerable
age.</p>

<p>Midday the heavens were lit by the return of Adrian from
Salonica. Small of stature, flowing of robe, with a grizzled foxy
beard, a fat, neat bun, and romantic, soulful eyes, there is a
bounce in his walk as becomes the owner of a great fortune. For, in
the old days before the confiscations, Adrian had taken fullest
advantage of the system which allowed him, if he could outbid the
other fathers, to farm the monastery's estates on his own account.
Last year he had been <i>Protepistates;</i> and the effusion of his
greeting had doubled our pleasure in arrival. He had sat with us at
lunch in the inn at Caryes, holding his silver-headed staff and
attended by the old Rip van Winkle. He had conducted us to churches
and chapels; he had overseen our every comfort. Now, at Vatopedi,
he came to us in the <i>salon.</i> What reunion, what emotion! And
we sat for long talking, he throwing his arms above his head with a
rustling of draperies, to express uncertainty or chagrin in his
soft, quavering voice.</p>

<p>"You ought to come here in the winter. The weather is not so hot
and the water colder. It is glorious then. There was a priest on my
boat from Salonica who came from Plymouth, in England. He is a
Roman Catholic, and is coming here." We shivered. "He speaks no
Greek&mdash;not a word&mdash;</p>

<p>"As for the new constitution," he continued, "it is exactly the
same as the old, save that the Governor gives his assent to
official documents...</p>

<p>"This&mdash;is this for me? It is most beautiful." And we handed
him an illustrated treatise on campanology.</p>

<p>Our next meeting was in the <i>Synodico,</i> where we again
assembled before visiting the library. On the latter, without
technical knowledge, it is impossible to comment; though it was
plain that, as a collection, the books of Vatopedi surpassed any on
the Mountain. Historically the outstanding volumes were two: a
small psalter, once the property of the Emperor Constantine IX
Monomach, 1042-1054, and autographed in that imperial scarlet which
posterity has chosen to term purple; and a great Gospels copied by
the Emperor John V Cantacuzene, who retired to Vatopedi in 1355 and
assumed the name Joseph, which he has appended to his manuscript:
[<i>Greek characters</i>]. He had already visited the monastery in
1341, when he was still the Grand Domestic, and had built himself a
house. It is thought, from a recorded though now lost inscription,
that it was he who erected the beautiful double-pillared phiale
which still stands outside the church.</p>

<p>Mark was sitting in the courtyard that afternoon when a voice
behind him suddenly said, "Come and have a glass of grog." Looking
up, he beheld a monk of 85 years leaning from a window. He was an
old sailor, who assured him on entry that he "brewed it" himself.
"It" proved extremely strong&mdash;another tribute to British
methods. The great event of his life had been when he was eighteen
and his ship had put in to Portsmouth. Walking along the quay, he
and a friend came across two boys in a boat, to whom they gave some
Turkish delight. The boys handed them cards in return, which
revealed that they were none other than "the King's two sons."
Perhaps he meant the Queen's.</p>

<p>The following morning was a Sunday, and Adrian arrived early for
his portrait. We nicknamed him "the young grandmother." Though
unknown to us, the Governor and Evlogios had already decided
between them on "the old girl." All four of us were sitting looking
out to sea in utter content when there chugged into the harbour a
small steam launch, which belonged, we were told, to a Cavalla
merchant. Figures disembarked. And there irrupted on our calm two
middle-aged Greeks, a very old one, palsied and unshaven, together
with the threatened priest, sweat-stained and odoriferous, with a
permanent stubble veiling the lower half of a face like a tousled
cock sparrow. Adrian was appalled, and, gathering up his skirts,
hurried away. Aristarchus was furious. We suggested that, for the
sake of our rooms, it might be easier if we left the same evening.
But, being Sunday, the mules were at their ease and could not be
disturbed. Later in the day, even more of the party arrived
overland from Caryes, including two Germans who used English as a
common language in which to communicate with their Greek
companions.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mark and I sought refuge with Adrian. He
occupied a large suite of apartments, to one of which was attached
a minute conservatory such as leads off a Kensington back
drawing-room, wherein flourished an enormous magnolia and several
gardenia plants. Against the walls rested shelves of books; on the
fringed table paperweights of golden quartz; and in the place of
honour hung a gigantic red plush hair-tidy, blazoned in ornamental
lettering with the word <i>KAAHMEPA</i> which means "Good morning."
A serving-monk in another room was busy unpacking a Primus stove
which Adrian had bought for his own use in Salonica. To this were
attached nests of aluminium pannikins, which were scattered all
over the flat.</p>

<p>Another monk brought us the usual refreshments in gilded cups
and gilded glasses. The <i>ouzo</i> bottle was placed at our side.
Gradually the conversation shifted to depths in which my Greek
would hardly carry me.</p>

<p>"It is all," summarised Adrian, "a fight between the army of the
Devil and the army of God, with Christ and the Holy Ghost. One day
God will win."</p>

<p>This was his confession of faith, wailed out in the sheep's
voice that hid, as I happened to know, a strain of innocuous but
competent wolf. Afterwards we talked of the union of the Orthodox
and Protestant Communions. It had been proposed this year, with a
view to regulating the position of the White Russian and Balkan
churches in relation to the Constantinople Patriarchate, to summon
to the Holy Mountain the preliminaries of an Ecumenical Council; a
council such as has not met since that of Florence in 1438; while
even then the representation was faulty. I had pictured the
magnitude of this event, and had planned to sneak out to its
attendance in the train of a friendly dignitary. But, as
preparations were progressing, the Turkish government suddenly
announced that if the Ecumenical Patriarch once left Constantinople
to preside over such a body, he should not be allowed to return. So
there, for the moment, was the end of it. Adrian said that in the
event of the council's materialising in the future, it was proposed
that it should split into committees, each to deal with a different
point of conflict and each to be billeted on a different monastery.
But, as I suggested and he agreed with a puff of satisfaction,
Vatopedi would probably be the centre.</p>

<p>Dinner, our last meal, was served, owing to the largeness of the
party, in the guest refectory. There was meat, now that Friday was
past. As might have been expected, the food during our stay had
been profuse. But we could not boast the experience of Dr. Covel,
who wrote of the monastery: "They gave us limpets, these thrice as
big as owres in England and yellow, all cover'd with a fat yellow
mosse which they eat either alone or with oyl; and tact well." We
were fortunate, however, in having tasted [<i>Greek
characters</i>], a kind of light port served after the meal, which
still retains its Byzantine appellation of "toothwash."</p>

<p>Conversationally the meal was lugubrious. The priest was
determined to show himself a man of the world. Grasping such
decanters as lay within reach, he emptied them. Nor were we long
left in doubt as to his toleration of the grosser excesses. Though
these, after the nature of Roman Catholics in the Levant, he was
mainly concerned to fasten upon the monks who were his hosts. We,
on the other hand, were equally resolved to show that, dog though
he be, our interests lay elsewhere. Rebuffed by the atmosphere of a
Puritan conventicle which greeted his sallies, he ceased. But
confidential he remained till the end. Much was explained when he
informed us that he was training at the English seminary in Rome.
We had known others...</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch17"></a>Chapter XVII. FEAST</h2>

<p>For the last time Haralambos brought our water to the sink. For
the last time Aristarchus laid our breakfast. We opened the last
<i>p&acirc;t&eacute; de saumon;</i> we carved the last tongue. And
having pressed, despite the assurance of the Plymouth priest and
his Greek companions that it was unnecessary, a gift upon the
guest-master and a somewhat smaller sum to swell Aristarchus'
private 7,000-drachma fund, we hastened to the <i>Synodico</i> to
say good-bye. Adrian and the guest-master accompanied us to the
gate, the former protesting that weight of years and rheumatism
would never allow him to visit England. Amid a bowing and a waving
we rode off, feeling that another of life's pleasures was behind
us.</p>

<p>We were concerned to reach Caryes in time to wait on the Holy
Synod in morning session. The ride was hot, and, to our sated
sensibilities, dull. After two hours we reached the suburbs.
Tangled fences lined the road. Rickety gates gave entrance to
gardens and allotments. Turning a corner, we beheld the
onion-shaped domes, green and gold, of the inflated Russian
<i>skiti</i> of St. Andrew. We had intended originally to proceed
to Coutloumousi, a pleasant monastery situated a quarter of an hour
away over fields and stiles, which we had used as our town house
last year. Its inmates are mainly from the Ionian Islands. For the
monasteries have a system of regional recruiting, each choosing a
separate district in the Levant. This is so far obeyed that to-day
the novices of, for instance, Simopetra, whither members were
formerly drawn from a district round Smyrna now emptied of Greeks,
are still derived from that particular section of refugees from
that district. As a result, a few of the older Coutloumousiots are
English subjects; the Ionian Islands having been under British rule
from the time of the Napoleonic wars to the accession of King
George I of the Hellenes in 1862. The other monks used to hate
them; for, while there was considerable popular agitation for the
islands' reunion with Greece, the islanders themselves, in the
event of any dispute, were for ever invoking their British
passports. Matters reached a head in the middle of the century,
when a difference of opinion with the monastery of Pantocrator over
a territorial boundary led to the citation of the abbot of
Coutloumousi before the Holy Synod. He, knowing himself to be in
the wrong, retired behind locked doors, which were broken forthwith
by the Synod guard and his person stripped in search of documents.
He and his elders were then degraded from office. But an appeal was
sent to Mr. Wilkinson, the English Consul at Salonica, who so
persuaded the Turkish Pasha of the town that the latter enforced
their reinstatement. Another history has survived of a Russian
attempt to gain possession of the monastery by inducing the
Patriarch to dismiss the Anglo-Ionian abbot in favour of a Russian
creature. This was countered by similar means and the hoisting of
the Union Jack. But it is perhaps only another light on the same
incident. To-day the monastery is notable for the stupidity of its
abbot and the colour of its church, a deep peony crimson. This
contains one good <i>eicon,</i> of the Italianised island school,
and presumably brought to the monastery by a former inmate.</p>

<p>Despite these attractions, there came upon us as we rode a
sudden desire for freedom. We were irked with ceremonies and good
behaviour, with the early shutting of the doors, the attendance of
services, and the punctuality of meals. Physically and mentally,
our resolution was waning. We were exhausted with lack of food, and
our ribs stuck out like famine children's. We instructed the
muleteer to go to the inn instead. Thence David and I hurried to
the Synod house, to find the session over. Our attempts to elicit
from a surly guard when the church of the Protaton or the chapel of
the Prodrome might be open, were cut short with unconquerable
finality by a demented monk who rooted himself at our side and
started to shout.</p>

<p>Perforce content, therefore, with the assurance that the Synod
would be sitting again at four, we sought Monsieur Lelis, the
Governor. But he was away at Xeropotamou "for the feast." Being
anxious to attend such a function ourselves, we decided to follow
him if it were possible, and went to the post-office to consult him
on the telephone. But it was not from the post-office we could
telephone; we must go to the <i>konak</i> of Xeropotamou round the
corner. After forcing ourselves by accident into a nest of
surprised Russians, we reached the desired front door.</p>

<p>"Telephone from here?" said its opener. "Quite impossible. The
<i>antiprosopos"&mdash;the</i> monastery's representative on the
Synod&mdash;"is away."</p>

<p>"But we, I tell you, know that it is possible."</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"The post-office."</p>

<p>"But why do you want to telephone?"</p>

<p>"We must speak to the Governor."</p>

<p>"The Governor?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We are friends of his."</p>

<p>"But it is impossible. The <i>antiprosopos</i> is not here."</p>

<p>And thus, like a recurring decimal, the argument began again. As
it progressed, we gradually forced the gesticulating old man up a
flight of stairs till we stood upon a landing.</p>

<p>"Now," we said, like a trio of Chicago gunmen, "where is
it?"</p>

<p>The monk disappeared into a bedroom, whence sounded a noise like
the inside of Big Ben at midday.</p>

<p>"There are three English here who want to speak to the
Governor...HE'S COMING. Take it!"</p>

<p>We rushed upon the instrument, throwing the earpiece from one to
the other in the consternation of success. The conversation began
in Greek, till I could explain who we were, when it continued in
French. Monsieur Lelis was charming. He enquired feelingly after
our work, hoped the photographs were satisfactory, and seemed
delighted that we should follow him. Should we inconvenience the
monastery, already full of guests?</p>

<p><i>"Mon cher ami! Pour vous il y aura toujours de la place."</i>
</p>

<p>Purring under this euphemy, Mark and I said we would arrive
about six. Only two? Yes, two. David, unfortunately, must stay
behind to work.</p>

<p>It was now midday. The narrow, vine-hung streets, cobbled, and
concave for the sake of drainage, were empty of the prowling black
figures. The shop fronts, glazed or unglazed, were silent.
Oppressed, we pattered back to the fleshly sanctuary of the
inn.</p>

<p>The host, moustached and collarless, accompanied by his two
youthful assistants, conducted us by wooden ladder and wooden
balcony to the upper floor. Sick of the company of one another, we
commanded three separate rooms, the two lesser at 1s. 3d. a night,
the larger, an apartment of honour which was pressed upon us that
it might not fall to the use of other and uncleanly visitors, at
2s. 6d. This latter was decorated in the Turkish fashion, with
green plaster reliefs. Adjacent stood the bathroom, floored in lead
and suspending from the ceiling a small watering-can with an
inverted funnel-mouthed spout, which, when filled, would empty a
seductive stream over the inviting back. The windows looked
straight down the peninsula to the summit. This is the view that
gives the visitor, on arrival in Caryes, his first inkling of what
lies in store. Immediately in front, the surface of a great
depression, a mile across, tilts down to the sea, thick with the
varying greens of gardened squares and alternating trees, olives,
cypresses, and Lombardy poplars. Beyond, forest and shrubs begin
again, rising in short successive tiers, till only the phantom
obelisk, white and unsubstantial, floats up and for ever into the
unmeasured blue.</p>

<p>On descent, a lunch of macaroni, meat, and French beans was
placed before us. We sat at one of the numerous rough tables on a
bench. The whole ground floor was occupied by a low room, giving
egress upon one side to the street and on the other to a kind of
wooden staging hung with flowering creepers, and permitting through
its cracks a view of unsavoury chickens. The meal finished, we
demanded grapes.</p>

<p>"There are none," said the innkeeper.</p>

<p>Coincident with his words, I espied through the open door a
jungle of thick, purple bunches in a garden ten feet above the
street. Insane with ceaseless thwarting, I leapt the tables, scaled
the wall with the bound of a chamois, and returned with the words
"There are." Thenceforth there were. As we ate, a monk arrived with
a telegram forwarded by Adrian from Vatopedi. It announced, to our
excitement, that Howe and Simon were arriving on the morrow.</p>

<p>The frescoed monuments of Caryes are two. The more prominent is
the church of the Protaton, half basilica, half Greek cross in
form, which contains a cycle of early fourteenth century frescoes
of the Macedonian school. This building dates from before the
foundation of the first monastery in 963, when Caryes was already
the centre of the Mountain's hermits. The other is the chapel of
St. John the Baptist, or Prodrome, attached to the cell of Denys of
Fourna, which was at present occupied by a monk of Coutloumousi
named Meletios. Last year, to our disappointment, Meletios had been
away. And not even the influence of Adrian had been sufficient to
negotiate the barrier of locks and bolts that he had left behind
him. Only to a vine-covered courtyard could we gain entrance.
Thither ladders were brought. And perched precariously upon a strut
among the grapes, we peered in through a window which could
scarcely have emitted an arrow, only catching sight, as it
afterwards proved, of some eighteenth century additions to the
frescoes within. Now, David and I set out to find the chapel again.
The streets had come to life. And, enquiring, we were told that
Meletios was once more away. We set our teeth.</p>

<p>The sun told us that it was time to visit the Synod. Entering,
we sat on divans among the dignified old men and made desultory
conversation. When coffee had been handed, we broached our desire
to photograph in the Protaton. Certainly. As for the Prodrome, what
could they do? We might pay for a new door. But it was private
property. And there was an end of it.</p>

<p>Seated now in the placid environment of the English countryside,
with a warm fire and a south wind blowing a hint of primroses in at
the window, a strange film overspreads the memory of our last days
on the Mountain. The smallest action was a struggle; to rise from a
chair needed determination; to walk down the road, effort titanic.
We had become in a sense light-headed: partly, through some upset
of mental equilibrium, result of contact with the unfamiliar forces
accumulated through centuries, greedy of the novice and venturer
from without; partly from physical deterioration. The difficulty of
decision was overpowering. But, even more so, the maniacal,
irrational obstinacy with which a decision, once made, was pursued.
With the little breath that God had left us, we vowed that neither
prison nor death should deter us from that chapel. And returned to
the inn to seek advice.</p>

<p>Our host was stirred. It appeared that Meletios had only been
gone a day. And it was possible that he was still upon the
Mountain. A messenger was sent to Coutloumousi; and another to
Coutloumousi's arsenal, an hour away upon the shore. But these
reported that the monastery's boat had sailed for Cavalla last
night. Then, as we discussed the situation, the conversation was
overheard in passing by a nondescript man in a grey tweed suit, who
came running in to say that Meletios had left the key with
Nicolaides. Our hearts bounded. And continued to thump, while
arrangements were made for David to visit the chapel early next
morning. It was, of course, only the key to the courtyard&mdash;no
farther than we had penetrated before. None the less, half our
elation remained. We had at least an ally.</p>

<p>We had bought some dried figs at a neighbouring shop, and were
drinking tea, when the sound of hoofs reminded Mark and me of our
obligation to be at Xeropotamou, an hour and three-quarters away,
before the sun set. Stuffing some week-end trifles into the
saddle-bags, we rode over the ridge in the golden evening, with all
the chestnuts lit above us.</p>

<p>The gate was still open and the porter expectant. All around,
both in the courtyard and outside, reclined in the half-light every
variety of Levantine manhood, labourers, guards, policemen, tramps,
hermits, boys, and old men, assembled to celebrate the Exaltation
of the Cross&mdash;a ceremony not to be confused with the
Invention, but supposed to have originated with the dedication of
the churches built by Constantine in Jerusalem to commemorate the
latter event. Here at Xeropotamou is the largest piece of the Cross
on Athos, 13 inches long. Hence the special significance which the
occasion assumes.</p>

<p>It is a common witticism of cynics that if all the
<i>soi-disant</i> wood of the Holy Rood were collected, there would
be sufficient to build a town. The joke, however, is with the
statisticians. It has been calculated that a cross, to have borne a
full-grown man, must have contained not less than 10,860 cubic
inches of wood. In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of Constantine, made her
famous discovery. And the Cross was left intact in Jerusalem. But,
to the agony of Christendom, it was carried off by the Persians in
615 and was not recovered till Heraclius captured Ctesiphon
thirteen years later. In order to preclude once and for all a
recurrence of this disaster, it was now divided into nineteen
parts, which were distributed over the Near East, Jerusalem
retaining four and Constantinople receiving three. In the assaults
which the Levant was to endure at the hands of both Europeans and
Asiatics during the next 1,000 years, the greater part of the wood
was lost. And out of the 10,860 cubic inches, there had survived in
the middle of the last century, when Count Riant surveyed the
authenticated reliquaries, not more than 244: sufficient, in fact,
to build, not a town, but a tea-caddy. Rome, Venice, Brussels, and
Ghent possess about 30 each, Paris 15. The Holy Mountain,
therefore, with an aggregate of almost 54 cubic inches, owns more
of the true Cross than any place in the world. The sceptic may
question whether the wood of these relics ever bore the body of
Christ. But there is no adequate reason to doubt that they are
pieces of the Cross which St. Helena found and which, with divine
guidance, she distinguished from its two companions.</p>

<p>We were conducted by the guest-master to a clean double-bedded
room leading off a broad passage tiled in black and white. There
followed us the muleteer, a hireling, who was to proceed to the
port early next morning to meet the new arrivals and fetch the box
of plates that we had deposited at the shop on our way from
Simopetra to Russico. That there should be no mistake, we wrote two
letters, one to the shopkeeper, the other to Mr. <i>Xao&ucirc;</i>
(Howe). We were then conducted downstairs to a room brightly lit
and filled with a chatter of conviviality. And there, handing
ap&eacute;ritifs to the assembled company upon a silver tray, was
dear long-lost Father Boniface.</p>

<p>Last year Father Boniface had been in charge of Daphni, the
port, the property of this his monastery. Warned of our arrival, he
had prepared breakfast for two strangers who could then speak
hardly a syllable of his tongue. And it had been he who, upon the
non-arrival of the steamer by which we were to depart, had rescued
us from a night in the inn, had taken us to his house, laid us on
clean linen, fed us, and entertained our day&mdash;for there was
now one with us who could speak&mdash;with quizzical stories of his
fellow-monks. We had probed the very intimacies of monastic life;
we had seen him wash his face and beard; we had concocted messes in
his kitchen. He had once occupied an ecclesiastical position in
Jerusalem. But circumstances had obliged him, in old age, to accept
a subordinate position in an institution which he regarded with the
critical eye of the outside world. He told how in the idiorhythmic
monasteries the elders and <i>epitropoi</i> took all the money,
while the younger monks went without clothes and were reduced to
stealing. He talked of the favouritism that led to advancement. And
he poured contempt on excessive religious observance.</p>

<p>"It is unfortunate," we had said, "that you have no church here
in which to celebrate the liturgy."</p>

<p>"Unfortunate? Not at all. God gets drunk with too many people
shouting at him."</p>

<p>Finally, on departure he gave us a melon, a small yellow fruit.
It is the fault of melons that, while their flavour is delicious,
it is vague. That of the one in question possessed the sharpness of
a nectarine. Never since melon grew has earth borne such a one as
this which it was our privilege to eat.</p>

<p>At our entry Father Boniface almost dropped his tray. His
woolly-white beard, depending from round ruby cheeks, danced with
delight as he heaped glasses upon us. Hardly, it seemed, were we in
time; for we immediately filed into a gala dinner, sitting down
with about thirty monks at one long table brightly lit with hanging
lamps. The Governor had gone to Daphni to bid good-bye to a friend.
Mark and I were alone in the forest of tall hats and rustling
gowns. On our left sat a fierce <i>epitropos</i> at the head of the
table, his iron-grey moustaches twitching with anger as he shouted
orders at Boniface, who was acting <i>maitre d'h&ocirc;tel.</i> The
food was of distinction. <i>Hors d'oeuvres</i> of onions, tomatoes,
and anchovies were followed by three courses of salt fish, the last
covered with an excellent clove mayonnaise in which swam prunes
like the grapes in <i>sole v&eacute;ronique.</i> As the meal
progressed, the <i>epitropos'</i> temper cleared. He remembered me
from last year. Where had I learnt my Greek? And why did I not
drink? Why not?</p>

<p>"I am drinking."</p>

<p>"You are not."</p>

<p>"I <i>am."</i></p>

<p>"But look at all the other decanters. They are empty. Yours is
not half gone." And he filled my glass and almost forced it down my
throat.</p>

<p>"Very well, I shall get drunk."</p>

<p>"Drunk? What does that matter? You must drink."</p>

<p>So drink we did, while the others belched heavenly repletion,
varying their tributes with the sound of a rat in straw, the
washing of wine on gums.</p>

<p>Coffee, accompanied by a light sweet wine in lieu of port, was
handed in the other room, till it was time for the momentous
service, which was to last all night, to begin. Did we wish to come
to the church, or to sleep? Sleep, we thought. And the fierce
<i>epitropos</i> saw us with all courtesy to our room. But sleep,
for me at least, was not forthcoming. Through our open windows and
the open doors of the church floated not the usual far-off wailing,
but great volumes of sound, which so affected Mark's slumbering
consciousness that to each burst he retaliated with a groan and a
toss that encroached still further on the night. Being very tired,
I persevered till an hour or two after midnight. Then, feeling that
it was absurd to miss both the service and my rest, I dressed, felt
my way downstairs, and crossed the starlit courtyard filled with
black forms, praying, wandering, sleeping.</p>

<p>The church was not unknown to me. On the occasion of our
previous visit, supposing that we were pressed for time on our way
down to catch the steamer which did not arrive, we had hastened
into the monastery and begged that, if possible, we might see the
treasures at once. Vespers were in progress. But we were hurried,
notwithstanding, through the crowded nave to within the
<i>eiconostasis,</i> where the officiating priest, invested with
stole and thurible, hooked the relics out of a cupboard in the
intervals when his voice was not required to conduct the service.
One was the famous piece of the Cross, enclosed in an ornate and
comparatively modern casket; another a small but very ancient
reliquary set with misshapen pearls and magnificent
<i>cabouchon</i> emeralds. And the third a small ophite paten known
as Pulcheria's cup. Ophite, like steatite, is a composition stone,
of a greenish hue, while the other is buff. This object, which
enjoys the reputation of boiling water without assistance, is
possibly the finest Byzantine stone relief in existence. There is
another not unlike it at Russico. But beyond these two there exists
nowhere anything of the sort that can approach them for age or
depth of workmanship. That of Xeropotamou, a shallow bowl not more
than six or seven inches across, exhibits the Virgin and Child
upright between two angels, encircled by a band of fifteen other
full-length angels in arches, together with an outer series of
prostrated apostles. An inscribed silver border makes it appear
that the cup was a donation from the fifth century Empress
Pulcheria. But this was not added till the eighteenth, and was one
of an extraordinary series of forgeries, both of chrysobuls and
stone reliefs, which sought to assign a spurious antiquity to the
monastery's history. Among its supposed founders was the Emperor
Romanus I Lecapenus, who died before any monasteries were yet in
being. It is probable, however, that he has been confused with the
Emperor Romanus III Argyrus, who reigned from 1028 to 1034 as the
husband of that elderly siren, the Empress Zo&euml;. This Romanus
had a sister named Pulcheria. And it is likely, therefore, that the
cup dates from the eleventh century and not the twelfth, as is
usually supposed.</p>

<p>Another benefactor of the monastery was the Sultan Selim II in
the latter half of the sixteenth century, who rebuilt and endowed
it after a visit to the Mountain. Such instances of the followers
of the Prophet seeking God through Christ have not been uncommon.
Busbecq, a little earlier, records how the Turks used to delay
their journeys till the Greek Church had given the sea its
customary blessing. And Thevet, who visited Athos about the same
time, encountered a monk who had escorted Bajazet II to Mount Sinai
and had seen the sultan <i>"secrettement faire son oraison en ce
mont."</i> Further, he had presented the monks with relics and
ornaments.</p>

<p>As I entered the church, the <i>narthex</i> was in total
darkness. Pressing shoulder to shoulder towards the east, in their
effort to peer through the central doors, stood a compact multitude
of fathers. They were of the lowest grade; and their smell of hot
clovy hair, boot-polish, garlic, and unwashed linen, was
overpowering. Imperceptibly, for they were all in a trance, I
wedged through them. And my eyes reached the nave as the crisis of
the ceremony began.</p>

<p>In contrast to the usual dim light, an exquisite shadowless
radiance, bright as the stage of a theatre, only as different from
electricity as rainwater from chalk, suffused the entire building.
All the innumerable chandeliers, candlesticks, candle-brackets,
candle-crosses, that had previously seemed but a superfluous
obstruction, were now in play. Within the corona, itself a ring of
flames, the central chandelier rose in a mountain of light. Beneath
stood a stool, caparisoned in brocade. And on it, at this moment,
borne aloft from out the <i>eiconostasis,</i> was placed the casket
containing the Cross. From his throne, at the back of which I
stood, stepped a bishop in a full red cope falling in folds from
his shoulders and fastened at the ankles. From his head streamed
the black veil which all the monks were wearing. In his hand was
his staff, with the twin serpents' heads of ivory. There joined him
two deacons in copes of green and gold; and two others in black.
All but he carried candles. And, forming a circle, they began to
pace slowly round the relic, while the singing swelled from soft
accompaniment to the attack. Rhythm of chant and paces, that
intrinsic rhythm independent of "time," caught the beholders from
their human frames. The voices were no longer nasal. Once and
again, a hundred and a thousand times, the <i>Kyrie eleison,</i> in
limitless plurality, beginning deep and hushed, mounted the scale
with a presage of impending triumph&mdash;to die off and begin
again:</p>

<blockquote>KYRIE ELEISON<br>
KYRIE ELEISON<br>
KYRIE ELEISON<br>
KYRIE ELEISON<br>
KYRIE ELEISON<br>
KYRIE ELEISON<br>
KYRIE ELEISON</blockquote>

<p>while the figures stepped round and about. I was transfixed,
like the monks, by this revelation of Orthodox observance, as
different from the ordinary service as a country vicar's reading is
from the Coronation.</p>

<p>When it was finished, the dawn was already flitting over the
buildings outside. I breathed deep in the cold, mysterious air. The
muleteers were waking beneath the trees and in the monks'
summerhouse, a round edifice like a bandstand. Over the sea I
looked to the southern point of Longos. But no steamer was visible.
And I returned to shave. As I did so, the Governor, pretending not
to see me, suddenly scurried past with nothing on but a shirt. He
emerged a moment later in trousers to enquire after our night's
rest and to regret that he must leave at once, as the Bulgarian
<i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i> had arrived in Caryes. Before he
went, he attended a service that was now proceeding in the phiale
outside the church. Thither the relic had been carried on high by
the two deacons in copes. And the bishop, dipping a bunch of basil
in the water of the fountain, was blessing those who put their
heads within his reach. Owing to the necessity of simultaneously
kissing the relic, I forbore.</p>

<p>By this time Mark was dressed, even out of the saddle-bags, with
his customary aplomb. We watched the service and the crowd round
the phiale till dispersal. Then walked to the gate. For us,
underneath the ridge, the sun was not yet risen. But glinting in
its reach out upon the sea was the steamer, making rapidly for
Daphni.</p>

<p>We leapt to our bedroom, caught up towels, and with whoops and
bounds threw ourselves down the hill, exchanging the laborious
hairpins of the path for the dusty shoots between the olives. A
quarter of an hour saw us at the bottom, over the broad bridge, and
up another slope, panting for breath; till the coastline bore round
to the left and a bay Soo yards across separated us from the jetty
of the port. It was half a mile round by the path, and the steamer
was almost in. Mark was behind, out of patience with this insensate
excitation. Like the slave on the ice, I hurtled down the boulders
to the water's edge; flung clothes upon the shingle; and, with a
last shout that my pockets contained all the money remaining to us,
dashed into the water. Being accustomed to proceed long distances
only at my leisure, I am not a strong swimmer. But it was now as
though a pink torpedo were thrusting over the surface of the still
shadowed bay, where the reflection of the ridge was conscious to my
straining eyes as they fixed on the sunlight beyond and the white
crest of water at the steamer's bows, turning over like the earth
from a plough. Two silent boatloads of tall-hatted silhouettes
glided across my path. The rattle of an anchor sounded. I struck
on, side and front, hidden from the passengers, who were looking at
the approaching fathers. Rounding the bows, I bobbed up beneath the
unseeing gaze of Howe and the correctly hatted Roman profile of
Simon. Would they never notice? I paddled on. Other passengers,
women&mdash;could they still exist?&mdash;were riveted upon this
agitated and unseemly Poseidon spewed up from the waters of
sanctity whence they had expected only hermits. At last: a start; a
wave; a shout; a babble; a torrent of converse. And those who
traversed the pages of our first adventure in the Levant will share
the joy of the reunion.</p>

<p>Exhausted, sinking, I clung to the painter of a boat, its
oarsmen eyeing me disdainfully. The delay was without end; the
water cold and the sun no nearer. While the steamer, from a vent in
its side, retched cinders, sewage, and cabbage-stalks upon my
unprotected person. At length they were down the gangway. And we
pushed off, leaving the argosy of civilisation to return to its
world. The rowers heaved. I hung, anchor to their progress. We
neared the quay. A crowd was there, and in the foreground Mark,
wrapped neatly in a face-towel, together with the muleteer clasping
the letter we had charged him to deliver. My feet touched bottom.
But how emerge? A covering was produced from a suit-case: and a
tweed cape, the ultimate affectation of 1922, was flung upon my
shoulders. Shivering with cold, I ran barefooted in the wake of the
others through the gaping ranks of monks and muleteers to the inn,
where we sat beneath a row of oleanders, <i>ouzo</i> coursing
through us like fire.</p>

<p>The newcomers themselves now wished to bathe. Affixing their
luggage to a mule that our man had brought, and making sure that
the plates had been retrieved from the shop, we walked along to
where our clothes were lying and swam out again, this time to reach
the sun. In it we sat and dried. So that by eight o'clock, when,
after three-quarters of an hour's climb, the monastery's gate was
reached, we were in a state of perspiration. We had thought that
there might be difficulties about the reception of Simon and Howe
till after the presentation of their letters at Caryes. But, it
being a feast-day, the doors were open to all. In a dishevelled
troupe, Howe looking like a race-meeting in my tweed
overcoat&mdash;all but his shirt-sleeves having been left on the
mule&mdash;we were ushered by Boniface into the monks' common-room,
where the elders and more distinguished guests were assembled for
the real festivities that were now to begin. At first we said that
under no consideration could we stay to lunch. But when we learnt
that it was timed for half-past nine, and that deep offence would
be given if we left before, we changed our minds. The atmosphere
was delightful. Bells were ringing; sunbeams battling with the
blinds; guests and monks arriving; drinks being handed; tables
laid. The room in which we sat was furnished with unusual variety:
rocking-chairs rocking; tables groaning with a wealth of albums;
walls hung with every sovereign that ever sat, including our own
dear Victoria in the peerless ill-favour of her later years.
Cocktail followed cocktail. We explained to Simon the ritual of
their acceptance, and lent him a tie for the occasion. Then the
meal was announced. And we learnt what is meant by a "Feast of the
Church."</p>

<p>The tables were disposed up, across, and down, in the form of a
rectangle missing one end. At them sat a company of 60 or 70. In
the middle, at the top, presided the bishop who had conducted last
night's ceremony, spare and dignified, whose diocese in Asia Minor
had been annihilated in the war. By his side was Evlogios,
handsomest monk on the Mountain, with his flowing iron beard and
broadly chiselled aquiline features. The news had reached us at
Vatopedi that he had just been appointed to the archbishopric of
Tirana, and would thereby become Primate of Albania, an important
post for a man of 47. But he was not certain, he said, whether he
wished to exchange the idyll of Athonite existence for the turmoil
of that uncouth political fiction.</p>

<p>The courses began with soup, and continued, four in succession,
with octopus. There was octopus cooked amid segments of the garlic
bulb, and octopus, more subtly delicate perhaps, alone. There was
octopus with beans; and there was octopus again alone but for a hot
gravy. Then followed roes, hard and round, an inch in diameter and
three long. These were garnished with a yellow mayonnaise of beaten
caviare. Their advent was pregnant with event; for, unaware of
their resilience, I plunged my knife upon one, to see it fly over
my elbow on to the spotless sheen of the gown of the father next
me. He was ruffled. But, drying the spots with my napkin till they
were invisible, I bathed him with such tears of remorse that he was
restored to calm. The waiting, directed by Boniface, was faultless.
And of the plenty of wine it is unnecessary to speak.</p>

<p>The climax was reached with snails. These, nine to a dozen on
each plate, were served with the tops knocked off. They had to be
wheedled therefore, not, as in the West, from the snail's own door,
but by an adroit twist of the fork from above. Boniface, all those
around us, and even Evlogios from his vantage-point, were so
concerned lest we should fail fully to appreciate them, that we
were at pains to acquire the proper motion. Delicious they were.
Meanwhile we drank as though it were ten at night instead of in the
morning. All did the same. The conviviality grew. We laughed and
shouted and toasted one another across the tables. Then, headed by
Evlogios and the bishop, the assembled company took each an empty
shell between thumb and forefinger and blew a blast of whistles, as
though ten thousand milk-boys were competing for a prize.</p>

<p>Dessert of apples and grapes was succeeded by coffee and the
lighter wine. The sun was in the top of the heavens when, having
bidden regretful farewell to Boniface, the fierce <i>epitropos,</i>
and all the others, we started out for Caryes. Simon, unfamiliar
with the wooden armchairs with which the Greeks furnish their
mules, sat with a straight back and a grip at the knees, as became
a man who hunts from Craven Lodge and wishes the muleteer to know
it. Thus, with new dignity, we reached the capital.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch18"></a>Chapter XVIII. METROPOLIS</h2>

<p>At the entrance to the main street of Caryes the muleteer bade
us dismount. A blazing Indian summer had set in, to which, while
the rest of those who had partaken of Xeropotamou's enormous meal
were sleeping, we had been obliged to expose ourselves. Being
exhausted with the heat and the activity of the previous night, I
refused. There ensued a long altercation, in which the man
explained that both he and I would go to prison if I were to
persist. It was permissible to ride in from the other side and
round to the inn, as we had done from Vatopedi. But no one had ever
passed the Protaton and its sacred <i>eicon</i> of the Virgin
except on their feet. As I had already done so twice on a mule's
back, I thought his intention was simply to aggravate. But, as
windows were beginning to fly up and the sun was on my shoulders, I
gave way. This was fortunate, as he proved, on enquiry, to be right
and my previous muleteers to have been criminally negligent in
allowing such an infringement of the rules of the town.</p>

<p>In the inn we found David. He told a story that set our pulses
beating.</p>

<p>Early that morning, as arranged, a little boy had arrived with a
key. It was quite useless, he explained, to go down to the chapel,
as this opened only the door of the yard. David persisted. Together
they shut the street behind them. The entrance to the cell lay up a
flight of wooden steps.</p>

<p>"That door," said the boy, "is shut."</p>

<p>David, summoning his few words of Greek, then delivered a
meaningless and urbane conversation, nonchalantly fingering the
lock and surreptitiously implanting his knee in a position of
leverage. The boy, quieted by this apparent resignation, became
almost sympathetic. When David, with unforeseen promptitude,
suddenly disappeared inside. Screeching, the boy followed. In front
stood another door, padlocked. Grasping an opportune hammer, David,
with the blood of the first wet upon his lips, removed the staple
with a blow. He was now at the entrance to the chapel, fastened by
iron-bound portals that would have kept Jack Sheppard in Newgate.
The boy, alarmed lest at such opposition this monster should gnash
the very bricks from their foundations, fled into the street for
help. Simultaneously an unholy calm, the cunning of desperation,
gripped the assailant. Searching walls and floor with rapid
fingertips, he discovered a crannied key. It fitted. And when the
boy returned, accompanied by the man Nicolaides, it was to find a
sedate and businesslike figure arranging his apparatus with the
deliberation of a photographer in his studio. Nicolaides shrugged.
For in the East, while they expect a man to bow to fate, when the
West turns fate, they themselves bow to that as well. In cold blood
the incident makes strange reading. But we were no longer, it must
be remembered, in possession of our ordinary faculties.</p>

<p>From the inn David, Mark, and I proceeded to the next house down
the street to take coffee with the Governor. His residence had
originally been built as the central office of the Athonias, the
burnt school above Vatopedi. Last year it had been empty, and we
had used it as a place of repose during our day or two in Caryes.
The upper floor where Monsieur Lelis now lived consisted of a large
landing divided at the top end by a glass partition, behind which
he sat. To either side of this were little bedrooms. He displayed
much interest in Mark's drawings, appreciated their humour, laughed
as we had laughed over that of Adrian, <i>"la vieille fille,"</i>
and begged that one might be done of himself. At the present moment
he was on the point of leaving for Zographou with the Bulgarian
<i>charg&eacute; d'affaires.</i> But we must dine with him
to-morrow night, and also devote the afternoon to the cause of
art.</p>

<p>David then took us to see the violated chapel. The boy, an
infant of thirteen, screamed out to all the world as we
arrived:</p>

<p>"This gentleman broke all the doors yesterday, and that's the
truth."</p>

<p>Stifling his falsetto with drachmas, we went in and were
comforted by a series of wholly remarkable frescoes, unlike any
others on the Mountain and of great evolutionary significance in
their connection with the mediaeval West. Unfortunately, they had
suffered from excessive restoration; and many had been altogether
displaced by newer. This, combined with a patently spurious
inscription, had led our precursors in artistic research to dismiss
them as negligible eighteenth century.</p>

<p>As it was evening, we returned to the inn. The sleepless night,
the hour in the water, the feast, and the midday ride, had induced
in me that grandmaternal affliction, a migraine. White waves,
hopeless and horrible, clouded the eyes to the hammer of a sick
headache. I retired to bed, and lay thinking how easy, even
pleasant, to die in this dramatic squalor: garments torn and
stained strewing the uncovered floor; plaster falling from the
ceiling and walls; a carafe of warm and cloudy water at the
bedside; and only the effulgent pigskin of my suit-case to remind
me of those pompous little islands lying off the north-west of
Holland. From the street beneath came the clip-clop of mules, the
hum of voices. The sunset streamed through the tattered petticoats
of the windows on my tortured eyes. When it was dark, David brought
me a plate of <i>pilaf.</i> It remained on the floor, where I found
it, coagulated and grey, on waking next morning, restored but
shaky.</p>

<p>Howe and Simon, having fallen asleep the previous afternoon,
were obliged to rise early to catch the Synod in morning session
and obtain their circular letter of introduction to the individual
monasteries before proceeding to Vatopedi. David and I accompanied
them, to remind the authorities of their promise that the Protaton
should be open to the camera this morning. There was business on
hand. But Daniel of Iviron, the <i>Protepistates,</i> emerged to
say that the sacristan had been summoned and would be here in half
an hour. We thanked him and retired. Whereupon David, ordinarily
placid as a Hampstead pond, burst into a rage. Half an hour! Half
an hour was half an hour! Did they think that the world offered
nothing for him to do but wait half-hours on their disgusting
pleasure? Let them open the Protaton. The Almighty in person should
not drag him inside it after this. And, like a cyclone, he battled
away down the street to the house of Nicolaides, with the syllables
of "Half an hour" left hissing in the air behind him as I
followed.</p>

<p>On our advent Nicolaides, in his turn, was seized with a
blinding fury. Some devil possessed the morning. How could he spare
the boy to look after us to-day? Was he there for nothing? There
were grapes, and he had work. David ground and foamed, the skin of
his face tight as a two-months-old corpse.</p>

<p>"Grapes?" I answered. "What are grapes, when we have spent 200
English pounds and journeyed across Europe in order to photograph
these paintings? We will hire you another, a whole man, who will do
twice as much work as the boy."</p>

<p>"I don't want a man. Only the boy knows where the jars are
kept"; and he trailed off into domestic technicalities, while we
snatched away the infant, delighted at the prospect of another
sixpence. But David had only lifted the shutter of the first
exposure when I returned, stronger even than God, to fetch him to
the Protaton. I had met one of the Synod guard, who civilly told me
it was open. On arrival, the sacristan let it be seen that he found
his task plainly distasteful. He had work, food, and sleep to claim
his attention during the day, he told us. Being anxious, now that
David and I were reduced to subsisting on brandy and soda, that the
work should not be prolonged, I muttered glibly of the presents
that we customarily made to the churches whose frescoes we
recorded. His demeanour then changed; for the Protaton seldom
received gifts from visitors. From sitting half asleep in the
stalls of the <i>antiprosopoi,</i> each one labelled in brass with
the name of its monastery, he brought us ladders, helped them
behind the <i>eiconostasis,</i> and even assisted David to a
position on top of the <i>ciborium.</i> At midday he was obliged to
return to his house, but promised to fetch us from the inn at two.
This he did, a quarter of an hour early.</p>

<p>As it was Wednesday, the first fast day of the Athonite week, no
meat might be sold by order of the <i>Epistasia.</i> This and other
rules of that autocratic body, the Synod's executive, are strictly
enforced. In every caf&eacute;, both in Caryes and Daphni, hangs a
fixed tariff stamped with the seal of the community. And we heard
of an instance where an innocuous game of patience while waiting
for the steamer was peremptorily stopped by one of the guards.
Revolted by the insipid macaroni that the innkeeper placed before
us, Mark went shopping and returned with a dozen eggs, which he
scrambled himself with the artistry of a chef. These, accompanied
by a white fizzy wine, a hybrid between cider and ginger beer, made
a meal which the acutest dyspepsia could not refuse.</p>

<p>It remained to make plans for departure. We were still intending
to pay another visit to Dionysiou, in the hope, if Gabriel should
have overruled the <i>epitropoi,</i> of seeing the Trapezuntine
chrysobul. The board outside the steamship agent's told us that
there was no boat to Salonica till Saturday. Hastening to the
post-office, we found David, who had thought there was one on
Friday, despatching telegrams to that effect. These we
countermanded. And our plans were still further modified by a
passing monk, who told us in casual conversation that Gabriel had
been obliged to go to Cavalla. Without him it would be useless to
return. But there was only the Saturday boat, and that we decided
to take.</p>

<p>Mark and I then went to the Governor. He was posed in a corner
of the divan against the windows, with the flaring patterns of
draped curtain and painted blind framing not only him, but a view
of the summit beyond. Thus we sat and talked, Mark busy with his
pencil and he playing with a tasselled string of oranges, dried to
the size and hardness of cherry-stones and sweet scented.</p>

<p>It was my purpose, during this conversation, to gain from the
Governor a definition of the attitude of Greek bureaucracy towards
the Holy Mountain. The question of status is settled. And the
financial difficulties are not as pressing as they seemed. But
there had existed last year an unconcealed friction between the
monastic and lay authorities. Was this on the wane or the increase?
Might it, in fact, constitute a danger that, if the Hellenic
constitution, wherein the Mountain's autonomy is embodied, should
at any time be overthrown by one of the dictators which are
perpetually being washed up on the shores of the Mediterranean, the
government of Caryes would lapse before the practical necessities
of the modern state?</p>

<p>The foregoing chapters have aimed to picture Athos in every
aspect as the composite and living memorial of a great
civilisation, to which nature and man, history and religion, artist
and architect, have contributed and contribute. Landscape and peak;
buildings, coloured and convergent; paintings, forerunners of the
twentieth century; manuscripts from the seventh; <i>eicons,</i>
mosaics, reliquaries, and jewels; these, each in relation to the
others, are the inheritance of a people whose vicissitudes of
fortune since they entered upon the custody of the Roman Empire in
330 and became a nation, have risen to a glory and sunk to a depth
experienced by no other country in Europe. And it is the
preservation of this inheritance for which the Greek government is
responsible to Greeks and to the world.</p>

<p>The misfortune, therefore, of ill feeling between Athens and
Caryes can be appreciated. Of its existence last year we had been
made aware in both places. And there were still signs that it was
not wholly eliminated. The natural resentment at the confiscation
of the estates was no longer so marked, save in the foreign
monasteries. But there was another point of friction in the
portable and inestimably valuable contents of the Athonite
treasuries and libraries. No country in the world, not excepting
Italy, has been so systematically plundered of her works of art as
Greece. And long ago the law was passed to forbid all antiquities,
whether classical or mediaeval, from leaving the country. Already
the enterprise of travellers such as Robert Curzon and
Uspenski&mdash;of whom the latter's collection of <i>eicons</i>
from Greek monasteries has been published, and is preserved intact
by the Soviet government&mdash;had robbed the Mountain of many of
its chiefest possessions. The process was not, indeed, new; Thevet
reported in the latter half of the sixteenth century that all the
good books were already gone. But till recent years it was lack of
cultural education rather than venality which led the monks so
easily to the dispersal of their treasures. To-day this is not so;
their conception of their value may almost be said to be inflated;
and the patriotic conscience, inert under the Ottoman rule, now
beats with the vigour of the awakened sleeper. Should the
Trapezuntine chrysobul or the Nicephorus Phocas Bible disappear, it
were a national calamity. But to-day such events are unthinkable.
In 1926 the monastery of Stavronikita announced its intention of
closing down for lack of funds. Yet in the same year it refused any
thought of parting with a psalter written in block letters of gold
and a fourteenth century illuminated Gospels, the price of
which&mdash;for I saw them&mdash;would have run into thousands of
pounds sterling.</p>

<p>It is, on the other hand, a fact, of which the Athenian
authorities are vaguely aware, that valuable objects continue very
occasionally to disappear. In 1925 an early parchment liturgy in
the form of a roll was believed to have fallen into the hands of a
Salonica money-lender. And a year later, to my personal knowledge,
an Anglo-American collector acquired a small but finely illuminated
service-book, eleventh or twelfth century, in exchange for
&pound;400 cash down; an entertaining contrast to the price of
&pound;20 paid by Robert Curzon at Xenophontos in 1837 for the
great Gospels autographed by one of the many Emperors Alexius
Comnenus, which is now in the British Museum. The major part of the
scandal lies in the fact that the &pound;400 went, not into the
coffers of a monastery, but the pocket of an individual monk.
Again, in 1926 an official warning was conveyed through the British
Legation in Athens to the effect that a well-known American firm of
dealers was contemplating commercial descent on the Mountain. In
which, it must be admitted, those concerned displayed no very great
interest.</p>

<p>It is plain, therefore, that the solution of this particular
difficulty lies in the formation of an official catalogue, whereby
the existence and whereabouts of the treasures shall be finally
registered. To this project, however, the monks are resolutely
opposed, and threaten to hide or bury everything they possess
rather than submit to it. If this is cussedness, it is only
reciprocal. For it cannot be denied that the various Greek official
propositions that have been put forward from time to time have been
tactlessly expressed. The former dictator, General Pangalos, was
loud in his determination to turn the Mountain into that pet
resource of Mediterranean statesmen, a casino. While the Athenian
savants have freely mooted invoking the authority of the
Metropolitan of Athens to confiscate by force all the works of art
on Athos for the Byzantine Museum, which at present contains only
one object of first-class importance. Since Athos is spiritually
subject only to the Ecumenical Patriarch, the legality of such a
procedure would be indefensible. It is unlikely that either of
these propositions was ever seriously contemplated; such is
certainly not the case in the present time; but their
advertisement, combined with a certain arrogance in Athens and a
petty dignity in Caryes, led to a considerable disturbance of
relationships.</p>

<p>But, with the appointment of Monsieur Lelis as second of the
newly instituted governors, the oil of genuine tact and goodness of
heart was necessarily poured upon the waters.</p>

<p>"I am here," he said, "only to ensure that the constitution
which the monks themselves drew up, and which has been accepted in
its entirety by the Greek government, is maintained. That is the
extent of my duties. In the region of finance, it is not true to
say that the government has <i>confiscated</i> the monastic farms.
Compensation will be paid, and many of them are only rented for the
space of ten years."</p>

<p>He continued to enumerate the extraordinary privileges that the
monks enjoy: the exemption from military service; and from all
taxation, death-duties, and imposts on imported and exported
goods.</p>

<p>"But," I said, quoting sources that I believed to be accurate,
"are not some of the poorer monks obliged to make a living by
buying their coffee and sugar free of duty and then disposing of it
on the mainland again at a profit, underselling the shops? And is
it not a scandal that some monks grow privately rich, while their
monasteries are falling to ruin and their lesser brethren in
rags?"</p>

<p>"No, no," he replied, "the monks are poor men, good and simple,
leading sincere religious lives. Their duties are no sinecure. If
there are exceptions, I have not met them." And he would have
nothing of these scandals with which, as an irritated official, I
had hoped to tempt him. This attitude was the greater tribute to
him, since his dislike of the post was unconcealed.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, "is there a woman in the world? Shall I ever
dance again? Shall I ever reach Paris, where I was appointed,
before my predecessor here&mdash;an old man who liked it&mdash;died
suddenly?"</p>

<p>Thus, with the light and the portrait, the discussion closed.
The Governor was right. Let the Athonite community be judged by the
majority. Almost identical with his words were those of Sir Paul
Rycaut, writing of the Mountain in 1679: "...for the most part good
simple men of godly lives, given greatly to devotion and acts of
mortification...We may, without overmuch credulity, or easiness of
belief, conclude them not only to be real and moral good men, but
such also as are something touched with the spirit of God."
"Overmuch credulity": it is always that&mdash;the fear of being
made a fool&mdash;which leads the observer to seek evil in
simplicity.</p>

<p>We returned to the inn to "dress." For we were to dine with
Monsieur Lelis. At eight o'clock we presented ourselves. Bearing an
unshaded lamp, he led the way to a recess in the landing. Cook and
serving-man was Father Stephen, a grey ascetic who had resided on
the Mountain without intermission since he was fourteen.</p>

<p><i>"On ne peut &agrave; peine y croire,"</i> the Governor
informed us, <i>"mais c'est la v&eacute;rit&eacute;: it est vierge.
Il m'a demand&eacute; l'autre jour comment les femmes sont faites.
Je lui ai dit que j'en am&egrave;nerais une pourqu'il puisse
voir.</i></p>

<p><i>"'Ici,' s'&eacute;cria-t-il, 'sur la terre sainte?'</i>
</p>

<p><i>"'Oui, et de plus, je la mettrai dans votre chambre.'"</i>
</p>

<p><i>"Il faillit en mourir."</i>
</p>

<p>Whatever Father Stephen's inexperience of worldly pleasures, he
was not insensible to the needs of civilised digestion. Macaroni
was followed by rissoles with tomato sauce and salad. We ate to
bursting, and afterwards talked behind the glass partition, playing
with Father Stephen's cats, Bijou and Coco. Outside, jackals howled
in the vineyards and crickets chirped without ceasing.</p>

<p>I awoke next morning with an inflamed throat that would neither
open nor shut.</p>

<p>"This," I said to myself, "is typhus. There are no drains in the
town. I leave Caryes to-day if I sleep under a bush."</p>

<p>Running along the balcony, I poured my intention upon David. He,
too, he said, preferred to make a last bid for life. And even Mark,
hitherto in buoyant health, was reduced to acquiescence. For the
moment, however, we were engaged to breakfast with Evlogios at the
Lavra <i>Konak,</i> whither we were escorted by the Governor, who
said that the prospective archbishop was his greatest friend on the
Mountain. Though he speaks only Greek, Evlogios reads French and
German. The conversation ranged over Byzantine culture and its
modern interpreters.</p>

<p>"The French," said he, "are Slav propagandists. They are always
trying to attribute the best paintings and buildings to Slav
artists and Slav architects." Which is, as he pointed out, curious,
since all Slav culture emanated directly from Constantinople, and
was usually inferior.</p>

<p>Breakfast, which was served by an ill-kempt youth called Nicola,
who was hoping to become a monk in three months' time and was much
puffed up of it, consisted of tea, rusks, tinned butter, and jam.
In the middle the telephone rang; and Evlogios and the Governor
held a long conversation with our old friends of the Lavra,
Nicodemus and Dr. Spyridon. There had been a fire at Kerasia,
actually at the Holy Apostles', where lived Andreas and Basil, who
had conducted our ascent of the summit. But it was only in the
forest, and no buildings had been burnt.</p>

<p>From the Lavra <i>Konak</i> we continued to a bookbinder's, a
hot walk down steep wooded paths interrupted by streams. The
bookbinder was Father Niphon, whose sunken cheeks, furrowed brow,
and eyes staring into the beyond, we had seen a hundred times among
the frescoed saints in the churches. He showed us his workshop, his
tools, his different leathers, and his German and Russian presses.
There was always occupation. At present he was engaged on a
sumptuous photographic facsimile of the <i>Codex Sinaiticus</i> for
the library of the Holy Synod. We afterwards sat eating grapes. I
was anxious to return, as numerous inscriptions remained to be
copied in the chapel of the Prodrome before we left. But the
Governor could only repeat: "Leave Caryes to-night? Ridiculous!
Impossible! You shall not!"</p>

<p>The heat was stifling in the little chapel when I ultimately
reached it. David, who had worked there since eight o'clock, left
at two. I remained till three, when he returned to fetch me; since
the innkeeper, in order to make up for a meatless Wednesday, had
cooked us a chicken which he refused to serve till we were all
there to eat it hot. As we did so, decision seized us. We would
leave, not only the capital, but the Mountain. Our work was done.
And there was a boat calling on the way to Cavalla the following
morning. Though this was exactly opposed to where we wished to go,
being on the way to Turkey, it would at least enable us to avoid
the industrial fair at Salonica and also to motor over part of
Macedonia. The mules were ordered; the unwashed clothing packed;
the bill paid; the youths tipped. After waiting twenty minutes
while the Governor was closeted with the <i>anti-prosopos</i> of
Iviron, we bade him good-bye, promising to meet again in other more
accessible capitals whither his diplomatic profession might call
him.</p>

<p>It had been our intention to spend the night at Xeropotamou. But
such had been the delay in starting that it was already nearly
dark, and it was plain that the doors would be closed. Having
replaced the fastenings of the chapel and left compensation with
Nicolaides for any damage that Meletios might detect, we rode from
the town. The muleteer, whom we had beaten magnificently in a
bargain-drive, had purposely forgotten to provide our saddles with
rugs. This omission, much against his will, he was forced to
rectify while we waited, and the twilight closed.</p>

<p>Sad at this last evening, even in pleasure at the prospect of
new comfort and new health, I climbed the ridge alone. The stars
came out. The trees stood about me in black aisles. At the top
Mark's mule ran away. The saddle, Birthed with a single thread,
turned round and he was precipitated into the dust. Thenceforth he
walked, while I rode. The moon, paring of a crescent, only
intensified the murk. And the animals, whose masters' prided boast
it is that they see in the dark, tripped and slid about the cobbles
with torturing uncertainty. Their owner, sulking at the lateness of
the hour, the bad bargain, and the rugs, walked ahead, leaving us
to manage as we might. To our bodies no worse could come. But in
front lurched the baggage-mule bearing the fragile
outcome&mdash;200 glass plates&mdash;of all our plans and effort.
Unthinking of my own's inept paces, I rode with my eyes fixed upon
the tail of the other. If it stopped to nibble, so did I. If it
strayed from the path, I drove it back. At one point it fell with a
sickening crash into a ditch higher than itself. I, on top, worked
with feverish wiles to urge it to the mouth. David meanwhile sat
humped and desperate, oblivious of the disasters that were
impinging on his life's work.</p>

<p>At Xeropotamou, a twinkling quadrangle of lights, the muleteer,
who was gleefully aware of our plight, was confident that we should
at least attempt an entrance. But, rather than endure yet another
loading and unloading, we would have ridden down the Matterhorn. To
the song of his curses we embarked on the steepest descent on the
Mountain. We reached the bridge, climbed the next hill, and rounded
the bay. Suddenly, with one eye still on the luggage, I caught
sight of David's body prostrate by the roadside: motionless; too
late. Dismounting to retrieve it for burial in the old Cotswold
churchyard, there greeted my touch a fearful spasm, and
then&mdash;let a veil be drawn. The mules had continued with their
fellows. Supporting one another, we staggered down to the port like
the two grenadiers.</p>

<p>The ground floor of the inn, low and dirty, was full of
indiscriminate labourers and fishermen. With difficulty we
distinguished the host, unshaven and hard-faced, in a white and
collarless sweater. We asked for food. To which he replied:</p>

<p>"At present I am eating, and I shall eat for a little."</p>

<p>Incensed, we picked the biggest ouzo bottle from the counter and
disappeared into the night with it. He was therefore obliged to
follow. Food we wanted, did we? Well, there was neither bread, nor
fish, nor meat, nor vegetables, nor fruit, nor wine. How true is
the proverb that a Greek will grow fat on what will starve an ass.
David and I could do no more. But Mark rose like a Florence
Nightingale. In a basket he discovered two dozen eggs. He relit the
fire; called for pepper and salt, set out plates, spoons, and
forks; and at length&mdash;we dined. As we ate, our eyes rested on
the inn's official designation, ostentatiously placarded on the
wall opposite:</p>

<blockquote>COFFEE-ALE-EATING-HOUSE<br>
AND<br>
HOTEL OF SLEEP</blockquote>

<p>Upstairs, two rooms awaited us. One was empty; the other to be
shared with a snoring and odorous fellow. From him we dragged the
spare bed next door. I lay down. And it was hard to think that any
man had lain in precisely such a bed before. Within one hour the
sheets were strewn with the corpses of 22 broad red bugs, each of
which had added a spurt of alien blood to the varying contributions
of my predecessors. As long again brought the figure up to 63. I
then threw half the mattress out of the window, where it stuck in a
vine. Sleep, which I had thought impossible, came at last, despite
the tickling. And I awoke feeling completely restored. There was
evidently ground for the ancient practice of bleeding. In the light
of day, the total was brought by Mark's practised eye up to 95. It
was disappointing that we did not reach the century.</p>

<p>Dressing-gowns a cynosure, we bathed with the rising of the sun;
we breakfasted as we dined; at ten o'clock we sighted the steamer;
and at half past we were on board, the skirts of the other sex
fluttering about us, and the tale of our luggage, plates and all,
complete.</p>

<p>Instead of returning past the other fingers of Chalcidice to
Salonica, we sail close in along the shore, prior to rounding the
base of the summit and striking across to the coast-line of Thrace.
We sit on the upper deck. A steward in a white jacket brings us
iced drinks upon a tin table. And before us the whole promontory
unfolds; high up, Simopetra, crag and building casting black shadow
down the gulley; perched low at the water's edge, Gregoriou;
Dionysiou, materialising suddenly from its green marble cleft; St.
Paul's set far back at the apex of a slope, with the summit borne
upward from its tower; the <i>skiti</i> of St. Anne clinging to the
corner cliffs; and then the corner. The ship lurches. A breeze
strikes up. Spray spatters on the deck. Mighty cliffs, fantastic
humps, sugar-loaves and pyramids, beetle from the waves as we
caracole their crests. Still, we keep close in. The walls of rock
rear up and topple out of sight. Trees and shrubs make tentative
approach from above, then recede before declivities of shale.
Suddenly a wooded ravine, dark and steep as a pipe, drops to the
water. At its foot an island; at its top, 2,000 feet up, the red
wall of the Holy Apostles'. Thence we ourselves had once looked
down on the deck of a passing ship such as this, a tiny dot on the
peacock rim, unreal, enigmatic in parvitude. Now we are small,
mortals without mark in a world of ponderous concerns. And over
all, filling the sky, rules the peak, massive and obtuse to our
inferior vision. A mile and a quarter it stands from the water by
cliff and ledge; till the trees dot away and only the white marble
dances up the blue to the music of the cold morning sun.</p>

<p>The wind drives past; the waves grow bigger; the boards of our
Leviathan pitch to the east, roll to the north. At the farthest
angle, the tower of the Lavra arsenal stands white; and, with the
turn, the monastery of Athanasius itself lies low and scattered on
an upper platform. The peak is hidden by the cloud above it. We
strike out into the open sea. This is good-bye.</p>

<p>Afternoon passes to evening. And a calm descends as we sail
within the lee of Thasos. The prow points for the hills, smoky
purple, as the falling sun plays gold on the downy breasts of the
clouds. Cavalla is in sight, a white blur; houses, churches,
minarets; trams, hotels. There is a lament in the wind's talk to
the marrows of life. Turn south, it says, astern, where the dark is
moving up from the water. There, carried high on a bank of clouds,
hovers a shape, a triangle in the sky. This is the Holy Mountain
Athos, station of a faith where all the years have stopped.</p>
