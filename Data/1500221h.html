<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>EDITORIAL NOTE</h2>

<p>In my editorial note to <i>The Death of the Moth</i> I wrote
that Virginia Woolf "left behind her a considerable number of
essays, sketches, and short stories, some unpublished and some
previously published in newspapers; there are, indeed, enough to
fill three or four volumes". Since then the short stories have been
published in <i>A Haunted House.</i> The present volume contains a
further selection of essays. I have followed the same method of
selection as in <i>The Death of the Moth,</i> including some of all
the different kinds of essay&mdash;the sketch, literary criticism,
biographical, "political"&mdash;and not attempting to choose
according to some scale of merit or importance. The consequence is
that the standard of achievement seems to me as high in this volume
as it was in <i>The Common Reader</i> or in <i>The Death of the
Moth,</i> and it is the same in the essays which I have not
included, but are sufficient to fill yet another volume.</p>

<p>Some of the essays are now published for the first time; others
have appeared in <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>, <i>The
Nation,</i> the <i>New Statesman and Nation, Time and Tide,</i> the
<i>New York Saturday Review, New Writing.</i> I have included two
essays with the same title, <i>Royalty;</i> the first was
commissioned, but, for obvious reasons, not published by <i>Picture
Post;</i> the second was published in <i>Time and Tide.</i></p>

<p>What I said with regard to the unrevised state of the essays in
the editorial note to <i>The Death of the Moth</i> applies to the
essays included in this volume. If Virginia Woolf had lived, she
would have revised or rewritten nearly all of them. The essays
differ considerably in their state of "finish". All which have
actually been published in newspapers have been written and
rewritten and revised, though there is no doubt that the process
would have continued. Some of them&mdash;e.g. <i>On Re-reading
Novels</i>&mdash;have in fact been revised and rewritten after
publication with a view to inclusion in volume form. Others, e.g.
<i>The Moment,</i> exist only in a much earlier stage, a rather
rough typescript heavily corrected in handwriting. I have printed
these exactly as they were left, except for punctuation and the
correction of obvious mistakes, but I have done so with some
hesitation, if only because the handwriting is occasionally
extremely difficult to decipher.</p>

<p>LEONARD WOOLF</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>THE MOMENT: SUMMER'S NIGHT</h2>

<p>The night was falling so that the table in the garden among the
trees grew whiter and whiter; and the people round it more
indistinct. An owl, blunt, obsolete looking, heavy weighted,
crossed the fading sky with a black spot between its claws. The
trees murmured. An aeroplane hummed like a piece of plucked wire.
There was also, on the roads, the distant explosion of a motor
cycle, shooting further and further away down the road. Yet what
composed the present moment? If you are young, the future lies upon
the present, like a piece of glass, making it tremble and quiver.
If you are old, the past lies upon the present, like a thick glass,
making it waver, distorting it. All the same, everybody believes
that the present is something, seeks out the different elements in
this situation in order to compose the truth of it, the whole of
it.</p>

<p>To begin with: it is largely composed of visual and of sense
impressions. The day was very hot. After heat, the surface of the
body is opened, as if all the pores were open and everything lay
exposed, not sealed and contracted, as in cold weather. The air
wafts cold on the skin under one's clothes. The soles of the feet
expand in slippers after walking on hard roads. Then the sense of
the light sinking back into darkness seems to be gently putting out
with a damp sponge the colour in one's own eyes. Then the leaves
shiver now and again, as if a ripple of irresistible sensation ran
through them, as a horse suddenly ripples its skin.</p>

<p>But this moment is also composed of a sense that the legs of the
chair are sinking through the centre of the earth, passing through
the rich garden earth; they sink, weighted down. Then the sky loses
its colour perceptibly and a star here and there makes a point of
light. Then changes, unseen in the day, coming in succession seem
to make an order evident. One becomes aware that we are spectators
and also passive participants in a pageant. And as nothing can
interfere with the order, we have nothing to do but accept, and
watch. Now little sparks, which are not steady, but fitful as if
somebody were doubtful, come across the field. Is it time to light
the lamp, the farmers' wives are saying: can I see a little longer?
The lamp sinks down; then it burns up. All doubt is over. Yes the
time has come in all cottages, in all farms, to light the lamps.
Thus then the moment is laced about with these weavings to and fro,
these inevitable downsinkings, flights, lamp lightings.</p>

<p>But that is the wider circumference of the moment. Here in the
centre is a knot of consciousness; a nucleus divided up into four
heads, eight legs, eight arms, and four separate bodies. They are
not subject to the law of the sun and the owl and the lamp. They
assist it. For sometimes a hand rests on the table; sometimes a leg
is thrown over a leg. Now the moment becomes shot with the
extraordinary arrow which people let fly from their
mouths&mdash;when they speak.</p>

<blockquote>"He'll do well with his hay."</blockquote>

<p>The words let fall this seed, but also, coming from that obscure
face, and the mouth, and the hand so characteristically holding the
cigarette, now hit the mind with a wad, then explode like a scent
suffusing the whole dome of the mind with its incense, flavour; let
fall, from their ambiguous envelope, the self-confidence of youth,
but also its urgent desire, for praise, and assurance; if they were
to say: "But you're no worse looking than many&mdash;you're no
different&mdash;people don't mark you out to laugh at you": that he
should be at once so cock-ahoop and so ungainly makes the moment
rock with laughter, and with the malice that comes from overlooking
other people's motives; and seeing what they keep hid; and so that
one takes sides; he will succeed; or no he won't; and then again,
this success, will it mean my defeat; or won't it? All this shoots
through the moment, makes it quiver with malice and amusement; and
the sense of watching and comparing; and the quiver meets the
shore, when the owl flies out, and puts a stop to this judging,
this overseeing, and with our wings spread, we too fly, take wing,
with the owl, over the earth and survey the quietude of what
sleeps, folded, slumbering, arm stretching in the vast dark and
sucking its thumb too; the amorous and the innocent; and a sigh
goes up. Could we not fly too, with broad wings and with softness;
and be all one wing; all embracing, all gathering, and these
boundaries, these pryings over hedge into hidden compartments of
different colours be all swept into one colour by the brush of the
wing; and so visit in splendour, augustly, peaks; and there lie
exposed, bare, on the spine, high up, to the cold light of the moon
rising, and when the moon rises, single, solitary, behold her, one,
eminent over us?</p>

<p>Ah, yes, if we could fly, fly, fly...Here the body is gripped;
and shaken; and the throat stiffens; and the nostrils tingle; and
like a rat shaken by a terrier one sneezes; and the whole universe
is shaken; mountains, snows, meadows; moon; higgledly, piggledy,
upside down, little splinters flying; and the head is jerked up,
down. "Hay fever&mdash;what a noise!&mdash;there's no cure. Except
spending hay time on a boat. Perhaps worse than the disease, though
that's what a man did&mdash;crossing and recrossing, all the
summer."</p>

<p>Issuing from a white arm, a long shape, lying back, in a film of
black and white, under the tree, which, down sweeping, seems a part
of that curving, that flowing, the voice, with its ridicule and its
sense, reveals to the shaken terrier its own insignificance. No
longer part of the snow; no part of the mountain; not in the least
venerable to other human beings; but ridiculous; a little accident;
a thing to be laughed at; discriminated out; seen clearly cut out,
sneezing, sneezing, judged and compared. Thus into the moment
steals self-assertion; ah, the sneeze again; the desire to sneeze
with conviction; masterfully; making oneself heard; felt; if not
pitied, then somebody of importance; perhaps to break away and go.
But no; the other shape has sent from its arrow another fine
binding thread, "Shall I fetch my Vapex?" She, the observant, the
discriminating, who keeps in mind always other instances, so that
there is nothing singular in any special case&mdash;who refuses to
be jumped into extravagance; and so sceptical withal; cannot
believe in miracles; sees the vanity of effort there; perhaps then
it would be well to try here; yet if she isolates cases from the
mists of hugeness, sees what is there all the more definitely;
refuses to be bamboozled; yet in this definite discrimination shows
some amplitude. That is why the moment becomes harder, is
intensified, diminished, begins to be stained by some expressed
personal juice; with the desire to be loved, to be held close to
the other shape; to put off the veil of darkness and see burning
eyes.</p>

<p>Then a light is struck; in it appears a sunburnt face, lean,
blue-eyed, and the arrow flies as the match goes out:</p>

<p>"He beats her every Saturday; from boredom, I should say; not
drink; there's nothing else to do."</p>

<p>The moment runs like quicksilver on a sloping aboard into the
cottage parlour; there are the tea things on the table; the hard
windsor chairs; tea caddies on the shelf for ornament; the medal
under a glass shade; vegetable steam curling from the pot; two
children crawling on the floor; and Liz comes in and John catches
her a blow on the side of her head as she slopes past him, dirty,
with her hair loose and one hairpin sticking out about to fall. And
she moans in a chronic animal way; and thy children look up and
then make a whistling noise to imitate the engine which they trail
across the flags; and John sits himself down with a thump at the
table and carves a hunk of bread and munches because there is
nothing to be done. A steam rises from his cabbage patch. Let us do
something then, something to end this horrible moment, this
plausible glistening moment that reflects in its smooth sides this
intolerable kitchen, this squalor; this woman moaning; and the
rattle of the toy on the flags, and the man munching. Let us smash
it by breaking a match. There&mdash;snap.</p>

<p>And then comes the low of the cows in the field; and another cow
to the left answers; and all the cows seem to be moving tranquilly
across the field and the owl flutes off its watery bubble. But the
sun is deep below the earth. The trees are growing heavier,
blacker; no order is perceptible; there is no sequence in these
cries, these movements; they come from no bodies; they are cries to
the left and to the right. Nothing can be seen. We can only see
ourselves as outlines, cadaverous, sculpturesque. And it is more
difficult for the voice to carry through this dark. The dark has
stripped the fledge from the arrow&mdash;the vibrations that rise
red shiver as it passes through us.</p>

<p>Then comes the terror, the exultation; the power to rush out
unnoticed, alone; to be consumed; to be swept away to become a
rider on the random wind; the tossing wind; the trampling and
neighing wind; the horse with the blown-back mane; the tumbling,
the foraging; he who gallops for ever, nowhither travelling,
indifferent; to be part of the eyeless dark, to be rippling and
streaming, to feel the glory run molten up the spine, down the
limbs, making the eyes glow, burning, bright, and penetrate the
buffeting waves of the wind.</p>

<p>"Everything's sopping wet. It's the dew off the grass. Time to
go in."</p>

<p>And then one shape heaves and surges and rises, and we pass,
trailing coats, down the path towards the lighted windows, the dim
glow behind the branches, and so enter the door, and the square
draws its lines round us, and here is a chair, a table, glasses,
knives, and thus we are boxed and housed, and will soon require a
draught of soda-water and to find something to read in bed.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>ON BEING ILL</h2>

<p><b><i>First published in 1930</i></b>
</p>

<p>Considering how common illness is, how tremendous the spiritual
change that it brings, how astonishing, when the lights of health
go down, the undiscovered countries that are then disclosed, what
wastes and deserts of the soul a slight attack of influenza brings
to view, what precipices and lawns sprinkled with bright flowers a
little rise of temperature reveals, what ancient and obdurate oaks
are uprooted in us by the act of sickness, how we go down into the
pit of death and feel the waters of annihilation close above our
heads and wake thinking to find ourselves in the presence of the
angels and the harpers when we have a tooth out and come to the
surface in the dentist's arm-chair and confuse his "Rinse the
mouth&mdash;rinse the mouth" with the greeting of the Deity
stooping from the floor of Heaven to welcome us&mdash;when we think
of this, as we are so frequently forced to think of it, it becomes
strange indeed that illness has not taken its place with love and
battle and jealousy among the prime themes of literature. Novels,
one would have thought, would have been devoted to influenza; epic
poems to typhoid; odes to pneumonia; lyrics to toothache. But no;
with a few exceptions De Quincey attempted something of the sort in
<i>The Opium Eater;</i> there must be a volume or two about disease
scattered through the pages of Proust&mdash;literature does its
best to maintain that its concern is with the mind; that the body
is a sheet of plain glass through which the soul looks straight and
clear, and, save for one or two passions such as desire and greed,
is null, and negligible and non-existent. On the contrary, the very
opposite is true. All day, all night the body intervenes; blunts or
sharpens, colours or discolours, turns to wax in the warmth of
June, hardens to tallow in the murk of February. The creature
within can only gaze through the pane&mdash;smudged or rosy; it
cannot separate off from the body like the sheath of a knife or the
pod of a pea for a single instant; it must go through the whole
unending procession of changes, heat and cold, comfort and
discomfort, hunger and satisfaction, health and illness, until
there comes the inevitable catastrophe; the body smashes itself to
smithereens, and the soul (it is said) escapes. But of all this
daily drama of the body there is no record. People write always of
the doings of the mind; the thoughts that come to it; its noble
plans; how the mind has civilised the universe. They show it
ignoring the body in the philosopher's turret; or kicking the body,
like an old leather football, across leagues of snow and desert in
the pursuit of conquest or discovery. Those great wars which the
body wages with the mind a slave to it, in the solitude of the
bedroom against the assault of fever or the oncome of melancholia,
are neglected. Nor is the reason far to seek. To look these things
squarely in the face would need the courage of a lion tamer; a
robust philosophy; a reason rooted in the bowels of the earth.
Short of these, this monster, the body, this miracle, its pain,
will soon make us taper into mysticism, or rise, with rapid beats
of the wings, into the raptures of transcendentalism. The public
would say that a novel devoted to influenza lacked plot; they would
complain that there was no love in it&mdash;wrongly however, for
illness often takes on the disguise of love, and plays the same odd
tricks. It invests certain faces with divinity, sets us to wait,
hour after hour, with pricked ears for the creaking of a stair, and
wreathes the faces of the absent (plain enough in health, Heaven
knows) with a new significance, while the mind concocts a thousand
legends and romances about them for which it has neither time nor
taste in health. Finally, to hinder the description of illness in
literature, there is the poverty of the language. English, which
can express the thoughts of Hamlet and the tragedy of Lear, has no
words for the shiver and the headache. It has all grown one way.
The merest schoolgirl, when she falls in love, has Shakespeare or
Keats to speak her mind for her; but let a sufferer try to describe
a pain in his head to a doctor and language at once runs dry. There
is nothing ready made for him. He is forced to coin words himself,
and, taking his pain in one hand, and a lump of pure sound in the
other (as perhaps the people of Babel did in the beginning), so to
crush them together that a brand new word in the end drops out.
Probably it will be something laughable. For who of English birth
can take liberties with the language? To us it is a sacred thing
and therefore doomed to die, unless the Americans, whose genius is
so much happier in the making of new words than in the disposition
of the old, will come to our help and set the springs aflow. Yet it
is not only a new language that we need, more primitive, more
sensual, more obscene, but a new hierarchy of the passions; love
must be deposed in favour of a temperature of 104; jealousy give
place to the pangs of sciatica; sleeplessness play the part of
villain, and the hero become a white liquid with a sweet
taste&mdash;that mighty Prince with the moths' eyes and the
feathered feet, one of whose names is Chloral.</p>

<p>But to return to the invalid. "I am in bed with
influenza"&mdash;but what does that convey of the great experience;
how the world has changed its shape; the tools of business grown
remote; the sounds of festival become romantic like a
merry-go-round heard across far fields; and friends have changed,
some putting on a strange beauty, others deformed to the squatness
of toads, while the whole landscape of life lies remote and fair,
like the shore seen from a ship far out at sea, and he is now
exalted on a peak and needs no help from man or God, and now
grovels supine on the floor glad of a kick from a
housemaid&mdash;the experience cannot be imparted and, as is always
the way with these dumb things, his own suffering serves but to
wake memories in his friends' minds of <i>their influenzas,</i>
their aches and pains which went unwept last February, and now cry
aloud, desperately, clamorously, for the divine relief of sympathy.
But sympathy we cannot have. Wisest Fate says no. If her children,
weighted as they already are with sorrow, were to take on them that
burden too, adding in imagination other pains to their own,
buildings would cease to rise; roads would peter out into grassy
tracks; there would be an end of music and of painting; one great
sigh alone would rise to Heaven, and the only attitudes for men and
women would be those of horror and despair. As it is, there is
always some little distraction&mdash;an organ grinder at the corner
of the hospital, a shop with book or trinket to decoy one past the
prison or the workhouse, some absurdity of cat or dog to prevent
one from turning the old beggar's hieroglyphic of misery into
volumes of sordid suffering; and thus the vast effort of sympathy
which those barracks of pain and discipline, those dried symbols of
sorrow, ask us to exert on their behalf, is uneasily shuffled off
for another time. Sympathy nowadays is dispensed chiefly by the
laggards and failures, women for the most part (in whom the
obsolete exists so strangely side by side with anarchy and
newness), who, having dropped out of the race, have time to spend
upon fantastic and unprofitable excursions; C. L. for example, who,
sitting by the stale sickroom fire, builds up, with touches at once
sober and imaginative, the nursery fender, the loaf, the lamp,
barrel organs in the street, and all the simple old wives' tales of
pinafores and escapades; A. R., the rash, the magnanimous, who, if
you fancied a giant tortoise to solace you or a theorbo to cheer
you, would ransack the markets of London and procure them somehow,
wrapped in paper, before the end of the days; the frivolous K. T.,
who, dressed in silks and feathers, powdered and painted (which
takes time too) as if for a banquet of Kings and Queens, spends her
whole brightness in the gloom of the sick room, and makes the
medicine bottles ring and the flames shoot up with her gossip and
her mimicry. But such follies have had their day; civilisation
points to a different goal; and then what place will there be for
the tortoise and the theorbo?</p>

<p>There is, let us confess it (and illness is the great
confessional), a childish outspokenness in illness; things are
said, truths blurted out, which the cautious respectability of
health conceals. About sympathy for example&mdash;we can do without
it. That illusion of a world so shaped that it echoes every groan,
of human beings so tied together by common needs and fears that a
twitch at one wrist jerks another, where however strange your
experience other people have had it too, where however far you
travel in your own mind someone has been there before you&mdash;is
all an illusion. We do not know our own souls, let alone the souls
of others. Human beings do not go hand in hand the whole stretch of
the way. There is a virgin forest in each; a snowfield where even
the print of birds' feet is unknown. Here we go alone, and like it
better so. Always to have sympathy, always to be accompanied,
always to be understood would be intolerable. But in health the
genial pretence must be kept up and the effort renewed&mdash;to
communicate, to civilise, to share, to cultivate the desert,
educate the native, to work together by day and by night to sport.
In illness this make-believe ceases. Directly the bed is called
for, or, sunk deep among pillows in one chair, we raise our feet
even an inch above the ground on another, we cease to be soldiers
in the army of the upright; we become deserters. They march to
battle. We float with the sticks on the stream; helter-skelter with
the dead leaves on the lawn, irresponsible and disinterested and
able, perhaps for the first time for years, to look round, to look
up&mdash;to look, for example, at the sky.</p>

<p>The first impression of that extraordinary spectacle is
strangely overcoming. Ordinarily to look at the sky for any length
of time is impossible. Pedestrians would be impeded and
disconcerted by a public sky-gazer. What snatches we get of it are
mutilated by chimneys and churches, serve as a background for man,
signify wet weather or fine, daub windows gold, and, filling in the
branches, complete the pathos of dishevelled autumnal plane trees
in autumnal squares. Now, lying recumbent, staring straight up, the
sky is discovered to be something so different from this that
really it is a little shocking. This then has been going on all the
time without our knowing it!&mdash;this incessant making up of
shapes and casting them down, this buffeting of clouds together,
and drawing vast trains of ships and waggons from North to South,
this incessant ringing up and down of curtains of light and shade,
this interminable experiment with gold shafts and blue shadows,
with veiling the sun and unveiling it, with making rock ramparts
and wafting them away&mdash;this endless activity, with the waste
of Heaven knows how many million horse power of energy, has been
left to work its will year in year out. The fact seems to call for
comment and indeed for censure. Ought not some one to write to
<i>The Times?</i> Use should be made of it. One should not let this
gigantic cinema play perpetually to an empty house. But watch a
little longer and another emotion drowns the stirrings of civic
ardour. Divinely beautiful it is also divinely heartless.
Immeasurable resources are used for some purpose which has nothing
to do with human pleasure or human profit. If we were all laid
prone, stiff, still the sky would be experimenting with its blues
and its golds. Perhaps then, if we look down at something very
small and close and familiar, we shall find sympathy. Let us
examine the rose. We have seen it so often flowering in bowls,
connected it so often with beauty in its prime, that we have
forgotten how it stands, still and steady, throughout an entire
afternoon in the earth. It preserves a demeanour of perfect dignity
and self-possession. The suffusion of its petals is of inimitable
rightness. Now perhaps one deliberately falls; now all the flowers,
the voluptuous purple, the creamy, in whose waxen flesh the spoon
has left a swirl of cherry juice; gladioli; dahlias; lilies,
sacerdotal, ecclesiastical; flowers with prim cardboard collars
tinged apricot and amber, all gently incline their heads to the
breeze&mdash;all, with the exception of the heavy sunflower, who
proudly acknowledges the sun at midday and perhaps at midnight
rebuffs the moon. There they stand; and it is of these, the
stillest, the most self-sufficient of all things that human beings
have made companions; these that symbolise their passions, decorate
their festivals, and lie (as if <i>they</i> knew sorrow) upon the
pillows of the dead. Wonderful to relate, poets have found religion
in nature; people live in the country to learn virtue from plants.
It is in their indifference that they are comforting. That
snowfield of the mind, where man has not trodden, is visited by the
cloud, kissed by the falling petal, as, in another sphere, it is
the great artists, the Miltons and the Popes, who console not by
their thought of us but by their forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with the heroism of the ant or the bee, however
indifferent the sky or disdainful the flowers, the army of the
upright marches to battle. Mrs. Jones catches her train. Mr. Smith
mends his motor. The cows are driven home to be milked. Men thatch
the roof. The dogs bark. The rooks, rising in a net, fall in a net
upon the elm trees. The wave of life flings itself out
indefatigably. It is only the recumbent who know what, after all,
Nature is at no pains to conceal&mdash;that she in the end will
conquer; heat will leave the world; stiff with frost we shall cease
to drag ourselves about the fields; ice will lie thick upon factory
and engine; the sun will go out. Even so, when the whole earth is
sheeted and slippery, some undulation, some irregularity of surface
will mark the boundary of an ancient garden, and there, thrusting
its head up undaunted in the starlight, the rose will flower, the
crocus will burn. But with the hook of life still in us still we
must wriggle. We cannot stiffen peaceably into glassy mounds. Even
the recumbent spring up at the mere imagination of frost about the
toes and stretch out to avail themselves of the universal
hope&mdash;Heaven, Immortality. Surely, since men have been wishing
all these ages, they will have wished something into existence;
there will be some green isle for the mind to rest on even if the
foot cannot plant itself there. The co-operative imagination of
mankind must have drawn some firm outline. But no. One opens the
<i>Morning Post</i> and reads the Bishop of Lichfield on Heaven.
One watches the church-goers file into those gallant temples where,
on the bleakest day, in the wettest fields, lamps will be burning,
bells will be ringing, and however the autumn leaves may shuffle
and the winds sigh outside, hopes and desires will be changed to
beliefs and certainties within. Do they look serene? Are their eyes
filled with the light of their supreme conviction? Would one of
them dare leap straight into Heaven off Beachy Head? None but a
simpleton would ask such questions; the little company of believers
lags and drags and strays. The mother is worn; the father tired. As
for imagining Heaven, they have no time. Heaven-making must be left
to the imagination of the poets. Without their help we can but
trifle&mdash;imagine Pepys in Heaven, adumbrate little interviews
with celebrated people on tufts of thyme, soon fall into gossip
about such of our friends as have stayed in Hell, or, worse still,
revert again to earth and choose, since there is no harm in
choosing, to live over and over, now as man, now as woman, as
sea-captain, or court lady, as Emperor or farmer's wife, in
splendid cities and on remote moors, at the time of Pericles or
Arthur, Charlemagne or George the Fourth&mdash;to live and live
till we have lived out those embryo lives which attend about us in
early youth until "I" suppressed them. But "I" shall not, if
wishing can alter it, usurp Heaven too, and condemn us, who have
played our parts here as William or Alice, to remain William or
Alice for ever. Left to ourselves we speculate thus carnally. We
need the poets to imagine for us. The duty of Heaven-making should
be attached to the office of the Poet Laureate.</p>

<p>Indeed it is to the poets that we turn. Illness makes us
disinclined for the long campaigns that prose exacts. We cannot
command all our faculties and keep our reason and our judgment and
our memory at attention while chapter swings on top of chapter,
and, as one settles into place, we must be on the watch for the
coming of the next, until the whole structure&mdash;arches, towers,
and battlements&mdash;stands firm on its foundations. <i>The
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> is not the book for
influenza, nor <i>The Golden Bowl</i> nor <i>Madame Bovary.</i> On
the other hand, with responsibility shelved and reason in the
abeyance&mdash;for who is going to exact criticism from an invalid
or sound sense from the bed-ridden?&mdash;other tastes assert
themselves; sudden, fitful, intense. We rifle the poets of their
flowers. We break off a line or two and let them open in the depths
of the mind:</p>

<blockquote><i>and oft at eve<br>
Visits the herds along the twilight meadows</i><br>
<br>
<i>wandering in thick flocks along the mountains<br>
Shepherded by the slow unwilling wind.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Or there is a whole three volume novel to be mused over in a
verse of Hardy's or a sentence of La Bruy&egrave;re. We dip in
Lamb's Letters&mdash;some prose writers are to be read as
poets&mdash;and find "I am a sanguinary murderer of time, and would
kill him inchmeal just now. But the snake is vital", and who shall
explain the delight? or open Rimbaud and read:</p>

<blockquote>O saisons o chateaux<br>
Quelle ame est sans d&eacute;fauts?</blockquote>

<p>and who shall rationalise the charm? In illness words seem to
possess a mystic quality. We grasp what is beyond their surface
meaning, gather instinctively this that, and the other&mdash;a
sound, a colour, here a stress, there a pause&mdash;which the poet,
knowing words to be meagre in comparison with ideas, has strewn
about his page to evoke, when collected, a state of mind which
neither words can express nor the reason explain.
Incomprehensibility has an enormous power over us in illness, more
legitimately perhaps than the upright will allow. In health meaning
has encroached upon sound. Our intelligence domineers over our
senses. But in illness, with the police off duty, we creep beneath
some obscure poem by Mallarm&eacute; or Donne, some phrase in Latin
or Greek, and the words give out their scent and distil their
flavour, and then, if at last we grasp the meaning, it is all the
richer for having come to us sensually first, by way of the palate
and the nostrils, like some queer odour. Foreigners, to whom the
tongue is strange, have us at a disadvantage. The Chinese must know
the sound of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> better than we do.</p>

<p>Rashness is one of the properties of illness&mdash;outlaws that
we are&mdash;and it is rashness that we need in reading
Shakespeare. It is not that we should doze in reading him, but
that, fully conscious and aware, his fame intimidates and bores,
and all the views of all the critics dull in us that thunder-clap
of conviction which, if an illusion, is still so helpful an
illusion, so prodigious a pleasure, so keen a stimulus in reading
the great. Shakespeare is getting flyblown; a paternal government
might well forbid writing about him, as they put his monument at
Stratford beyond the reach of scribbling fingers. With all this
buzz of criticism about, one may hazard one's conjectures
privately, make one's notes in the margin; but, knowing that
someone has said it before, or said it better, the zest is gone.
Illness, in its kingly sublimity, sweeps all that aside and leaves
nothing but Shakespeare and oneself. What with his overweening
power and our overweening arrogance, the barriers go down, the
knots run smooth, the brain rings and resounds with <i>Lear</i> or
<i>Macbeth,</i> and even Coleridge himself squeaks like a distant
mouse.</p>

<p>But enough of Shakespeare&mdash;let us turn to Augustus Hare.
There are people who say that even illness does not warrant these
transitions; that the author of <i>The Story of Two Noble Lives</i>
is not the peer of Boswell; and if we assert that short of the best
in literature we like the worst&mdash;it is mediocrity that is
hateful&mdash;will have none of that either. So be it. The law is
on the side of the normal. But for those who suffer a slight rise
of temperature the names of Hare and Waterford and Canning ray out
as beams of benignant lustre. Not, it is true, for the first
hundred pages or so. There, as so often in these fat volumes, we
flounder and threaten to sink in a plethora of aunts and uncles. We
have to remind ourselves that there is such a thing as atmosphere;
that the masters themselves often keep us waiting intolerably while
they prepare our minds for whatever it may be&mdash;the surprise,
or the lack of surprise. So Hare, too, takes his time; the charm
steals upon us imperceptibly; by degrees we become almost one of
the family, yet not quite, for our sense of the oddity of it all
remains, and share the family dismay when Lord Stuart leaves the
room&mdash;there was a ball going forward&mdash;and is next heard
of in Iceland. Parties, he said, bored him&mdash;such were English
aristocrats before marriage with intellect had adulterated the fine
singularity of their minds. Parties bore them; they are off to
Iceland. Then Beckford's mania for castle building attacked him; he
must lift a French <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> across the Channel, and
erect pinnacles and towers to use as servants' bedrooms at vast
expense, upon the borders of a crumbling cliff, too, so that the
housemaids saw their brooms swimming down the Solent, and Lady
Stuart was much distressed, but made the best of it and began, like
the high-born lady that she was, planting evergreens in the face of
ruin. Meanwhile the daughters, Charlotte and Louisa, grew up in
their incomparable loveliness, with pencils in their hands, for
ever sketching, dancing, flirting, in a cloud of gauze. They are
not very distinct it is true. For life then was not the life of
Charlotte and Louisa. It was the life of families, of groups. It
was a web, a net, spreading wide and enmeshing every sort of
cousin, dependant, and old retainer. Aunts&mdash;Aunt Caledon, Aunt
Mexborough&mdash;grandmothers&mdash;Granny Stuart, Granny
Hardwicke&mdash;cluster in chorus, and rejoice and sorrow and eat
Christmas dinner together, and grow very old and remain very
upright, and sit in hooded chairs cutting flowers it seems out of
coloured paper. Charlotte married Canning and went to India; Louisa
married Lord Waterford and went to Ireland. Then letters begin to
cross vast spaces in slow sailing ships and communication becomes
still more protracted and verbose, and there seems no end to the
space and the leisure of those early Victorian days, and faiths are
lost and the life of Hedley Vicars revives them; aunts catch cold
but recover; cousins marry; there are the Irish famine and the
Indian Mutiny, and both sisters remain to their great, but silent,
grief without children to come after them. Louisa, dumped down in
Ireland with Lord Waterford at the hunt all day, was often very
lonely; but she stuck to her post, visited the poor, spoke words of
comfort ("I am sorry indeed to hear of Anthony Thompson's loss of
mind, or rather of memory; if, however, he can understand
sufficiently to trust solely in our Saviour, he has enough") and
sketched and sketched. Thousands of notebooks were filled with pen
and ink drawings of an evening, and then the carpenter stretched
sheets for her and she designed frescoes for schoolrooms, had live
sheep into her bedroom, draped gamekeepers in blankets, painted
Holy Families in abundance, until the great Watts exclaimed that
here was Titian's peer and Raphael's master! At that Lady Waterford
laughed (she had a generous, benignant sense of humour); and said
that she was nothing but a sketcher; had scarcely had a lesson in
her life&mdash;witness her angel's wings scandalously unfinished.
Moreover, there was her father's house forever falling into the
sea; she must shore it up; must entertain her friends; must fill
her days with all sorts of charities, till her Lord came home from
hunting, and then, at midnight often, she would sketch him with his
knightly face half hidden in a bowl of soup, sitting with her
sketch-book under a lamp beside him. Off he would ride again,
stately as a crusader, to hunt the fox, and she would wave to him
and think each time, what if this should be the last? And so it
was, that winter's morning; his horse stumbled; he was killed. She
knew it before they told her, and never could Sir John Leslie
forget, when he ran downstairs on the day of the burial, the beauty
of the great lady standing to <i>see</i> the hearse depart, nor,
when he came back, how the curtain, heavy, mid-Victorian, plush
perhaps, was all crushed together where she had grasped it in her
agony.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a><i>THE FAERY QUEEN</i>
</h2>

<p><i>The Faery Queen,</i> it is said, has never been read to the
end; no one has ever wished <i>Paradise Lost,</i> it is said, a
word longer; and these remarks however exaggerated probably give
pleasure, like a child's laugh at a ceremony, because they express
something we secretly feel and yet try to hide. Dare we then at
this time of day come out with the remark that <i>The Faery
Queen</i> is a great poem? So one might say early rising, cold
bathing, abstention from wine and tobacco are good; and if one said
it, a blank look would steal over the company as they made haste to
agree and then to lower the tone of the conversation. Yet it is
true. Here are some general observations made by one who has gone
through the experience, and wishes to urge others, who may be
hiding their yawns and their polite boredom, to the same
experience.</p>

<p>The first essential is, of course, not to read <i>The Faery
Queen.</i> Put it off as long as possible. Grind out politics;
absorb science; wallow in fiction; walk about London; observe the
crowds; calculate the loss of life and limb; rub shoulders with the
poor in markets; buy and sell; fix the mind firmly on the financial
columns of the newspapers, weather; on the crops; on the fashions.
At the mere mention of chivalry shiver and snigger; detest
allegory; revel in direct speech; adore all the virtues of the
robust, the plain spoken; and then, when the whole being is red and
brittle as sandstone in the sun, make a dash for <i>The Faery
Queen</i> and give yourself up to it.</p>

<p>But reading poetry is a complex art. The mind has many layers,
and the greater the poem the more of these are roused and brought
into action. They seem, too, to be in order. The faculty we employ
upon poetry at the first reading is sensual; the eye of the mind
opens. And Spenser rouses the eye softly and brilliantly with his
green trees, his pearled women, his crested and plumed knights.
(Then we need to use our sympathies, not the strong passions, but
the simple wish to go with our knight and his lady to feel their
heat and cold, and their thirst and hunger.) And then we need
movement. Their figures, as they pass along the grass track, must
reach a hovel or a palace or find a man in weeds reading his book.
That too is gratified. And then living thus with our eyes, with our
legs and arms, with the natural quiet feelings of liking and
disliking tolerantly and gently excited, we realise a more complex
desire that all these emotions should combine. There must be a
pervading sense of belief, or much of our emotion will be wasted.
The tree must be part of the knight; the knight of the lady. All
these states of Mind must support one another, and the strength of
the poem will come from the combination, just as it will fail if at
any point the poet loses belief.</p>

<p>But it may be said, when a poet is dealing with Faery Land and
the supernatural people who live there, belief can only be used' in
a special sense. We do not believe in the existence of giants and
Ogres, but in something that the poet himself believed them to
represent. What then was Spenser's belief, when he wrote his poem?
He has himself declared that the "general intention and meaning" of
<i>The Faery Queen</i> was "to fashion a gentleman or noble person
in virtuous and noble discipline". It would be absurd to pretend
that we are more than intermittently conscious of the poet's
meaning. Yet as we read, we half consciously have the sense of some
pattern hanging in the sky, so that without referring any of the
words to a special place, they have that meaning which comes from
their being parts of a whole design, and not an isolated fragment
of unrelated loveliness. The mind is being perpetually enlarged by
the power of suggestion. Much more is imagined than is stated. And
it is due to this quality that the poem changes, with time, so that
after four hundred years it still corresponds to something which
we, who are momentarily in the flesh, feel at the moment.</p>

<p>The question asks itself, then, how Spenser, himself imprisoned
in so many impediments of circumstance, remote from us in time, in
speech, in convention, yet seems to be talking about things that
are important to us too?. Compare, for example, his perfect
gentleman with Tennyson's Arthur. Already, much in Tennyson's
pattern is unintelligible; an easy butt for satire. Among living
writers again, there is none who is able to display a typical
figure. Each seems limited to one room of the human dwelling. But
with Spenser, though here in this department of our being, we seem
able to unlock the door and walk about. We miss certain intensities
and details; but on the other hand we are uncabined. We are allowed
to give scope to a number of interests, delights, curiosities, and
loves that find no satisfaction in the poetry of our own time. But
though it would be easy to frame a reason for this and to
generalise about the decay of faith, the rise of machines, the
isolation of the human being, let us, however, work from the
opposite point of view. In reading <i>The Faery Queen</i> the first
thing, we said, was that the mind has different layers. It brings
one into play and then another. The desire of the eye, the desire
of the body, desires for rhythm, movement, the desire for
adventure&mdash;each is gratified. And this gratification depends
upon the poet's own mobility. He is alive in all his parts. He
scarcely seems to prefer one to another. We are reminded of the old
myth of the body which has many organs, and the lesser and the
obscure are as important as the kingly and important.</p>

<p>Here at any rate the poet's body seems all alive. A
fearlessness, a simplicity that is like the movement of a naked
savage possesses him. He is not merely a thinking brain; he is a
feeling body, a sensitive heart. He has hands and feet, and, as he
says himself, a natural chastity, so that some things are judged
unfit for the pen. "My chaster muse for shame doth blush to write."
In short, when we read <i>The Faery Queen,</i> we feel that the
whole being is drawn upon, not merely a separate part.</p>

<p>To say this is to say that the conventions that Spenser uses are
not enough to cut us off from the inner meaning. And the reason
soon makes itself apparent. When we talk of the modern distaste for
allegory, we are only saying that we prefer our qualities in
another form. The novelist uses allegory; that is to say, when he
wishes to expound his characters, he makes them think; Spenser
impersonated his psychology. Thus if the novelist now wished to
convey his hero's gloom, he would tell us his thoughts; Spenser
creates a figure called Despair. He has the fullest sense of what
sorrow is. But he typifies it; he creates a dwelling, an old man
who comes out of the house and says I cannot tell; and then the
figure of Despair with his beautiful elegy. Instead of being
prisoned in one breast we are shown the outer semblance. He is
working thus on a larger, freer, more depersonalised scale. By
making the passions into people, he gives them an amplitude. And
who shall say that this is the less natural, the less realistic?
For the most exact observer has to leave much of his people's minds
obscure.</p>

<p>Once we get him out of his private mythology, there is no
mythology which can personify his actions. We wish to convey
delight and have to describe an actual garden, here and now;
Spenser at once calls up a picture of nymphs dancing, youth,
maidens crowned. And yet it is not pictorial merely. Nothing is
more refreshing, nothing serves more to sting and revive us than
the spray of fresh hard words, little colloquialisms, tart green
words that might have been spoken at dinner, joining in easily with
the more stately tribe. But such externality is impossible to us,
because we have lost our power to create symbols. Spenser's ability
to use despair in person depends on his power to create a world in
which such a figure draws natural breath, living breath. He has his
dwelling at the centre of a universe which offers him the use of
dragons, knights, magic; and all the company that exist about them;
and flowers and dawn and sunset. All this was still just within his
reach. He could believe in it, his public could believe in it,
sufficiently to make it serviceable. It was, of course, just
slipping from his grasp. That is obvious from his own words: His
poem, he says, will be called the abundance of an idle brain. His
language, too, oddly compounded of the high flown and the
vernacular, was just then at the turn. On the one hand we have the
old smooth conventions&mdash;Tithonus, Cynthia, Phoebus, and the
rest; on the other fry and rascal and losel, the common speech that
was current on the lips of the women at the door. He was not asking
the reader to adopt an unnatural pose; only to think poetically.
And the writer's faith is still effective. We are removed four
hundred years from Spenser; and the effort to think back into his
mood requires some adjustment, some oblivion; but there is nothing
false in what is to be done; it is easier to read Spenser than to
read William Morris.</p>

<p>The true difficulty lies elsewhere. It lies in the fact that the
poem is a meditation, not a dramatisation. At no point is Spenser
under the necessity of bringing his characters to the surface; they
lack the final embodiment which is forced so drastically upon the
playwright. They sink back into the poet's mind and thus lack
definition. He is talking about them; they are not using their own
words. Hence the indistinctness which leads, as undoubtedly it does
lead, to monotony. The verse becomes for a time a rocking horse;
swaying up and down; a celestial rocking horse, whose pace is
always rhythmical and seemly, but lulling, soporofic. It sings us
to sleep; it lulls the teeth of the wind. On no other terms,
however, could we be kept in being. And to compensate we have the
quality of that mind; the sense that we are confined in one
continuous consciousness, which is Spenser's; that he has saturated
and enclosed this world, that we live in a great bubble blown from
the poet's brain. Yet if it ignores our own marks, houses,
chimneys, roads, the multitudinous details which serve like
signposts or features to indicate to us where our emotions lie, it
is not a private world of fantasy. Here are the qualities that
agitate living people at the moment; spite, greed, jealousy,
ugliness, poverty, pain; Spenser in his poet's castle was as
acutely aware of the rubs and tumbles of life as the living, but by
virtue of his poetry blew them away into the higher air. So we feel
not shut in, but freed; and take our way in a world which gives
expression to sensation more vigorously, more exactly than we can
manage for ourselves in the flesh. It is-a world of astonishing
physical brilliance and intensity; sharpened, intensified as
objects are in a clearer air; such as we see them, not in dreams,
but when all the faculties are alert and vigorous; when the
stuffing and the detail have been brushed aside; and we see the
bone and the symmetry; now in a landscape, in Ireland or in Greece;
and now when we think of ourselves, under the more intense ray of
poetry; under its sharper, its lovelier light.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CONGREVE'S COMEDIES</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in August 1937</i></b>
</p>

<p>The four great plays through which Congreve is immortal take up
very little space, and can be bought very cheaply; but they can be
seen very seldom, and to read them, silently and in solitude, is to
do them an injustice. The best way to repair that injustice is to
consider them with the author's help more critically, if more
coldly, than we are able when the words are embodied on the stage.
Congreve, the man of mystery, the man of superb genius who ceased
to use his genius at his height, was also, as any reader may guess
from almost any page, of the class of writers who are not so
entirely submerged in their gift but that they can watch it
curiously and to some extent guide it even when they are possessed
by it. Whatever he has to say in a letter, in a dedication, in a
prologue about his art is worth listening to with all our ears. Let
us then put to him some of the questions that the remembrance of
his plays has left over in the mind before we allow the Tattles and
the Foresights, the Wishforts and the Millamants to sweep us off
our feet.</p>

<p>First there is the old grievance which, though it sounds
elementary, must always have its say: the grievance that is summed
up in the absurd names he gives his characters&mdash;Vainlove,
Fondlewife, and the rest&mdash;as if we were back again in the age
of mummer and cart, when one humour to one character was all the
audience could grasp or the actor express. To that he replies,
"...the distance of the stage requires the figures represented to
be something larger than the life", a warning to the reader to
suppress the desire for certain subtleties which the playwright
cannot satisfy, a reminder that the imponderable suggestions which
come together on silent feet in fiction are denied the playwright.
He must speak; the speaking voice is the only instrument allowed
him. That introduces a second question: they must speak, but why so
artificially? Men and women were never so witty as he makes them;
they never speak so aptly, so instantly, and with such a wealth of
figure and imagery as he would have us believe. And to that he
replies, "I believe if a poet should steal a dialogue of any
length, from the extempore discourse of the two wittiest men upon
earth, he would find the scene but coldly receiv'd by the town".
People on the stage must be larger than life because they are
further from us than in the book; and cleverer than life because if
he set down their actual words we should be bored to distraction.
Every writer has his selection to make; his artifice to enforce;
these are the playwright's. These are the methods by which he puts
us in the frame of mind needed for his purpose.</p>

<p>Still there remains another grievance which is not so elementary
nor so easily laid to rest; and that is, of course, the plot. Who
can remember the plot when the book is shut? Who has not been
teased by its intricacies while the book is open? As everybody is
agreed something must happen, and it matters very little what
happens if it serves to make the characters more real, or more
profound, than they would otherwise have been; a plot should put
the characters on the rack and show them thus extended. But what
are we to say when the plot merely teases and distorts the
character, and distracts us from any more profound enjoyment than
that of asking who is behind that door, who is behind that mask? To
this Congreve the critic gives us no satisfactory answer.
Sometimes, as in the preface to <i>The Double Dealer,</i> he prides
himself that he has maintained "the unities of the drama". But a
certain doubt declares itself elsewhere. In the dedication to
<i>The Way of the World</i> he envies Terence. Terence, he points
out, had "great advantages to encourage his undertaking for he
built most on the foundations of Menander; his plots were generally
modelled and his characters ready drawn to his hand". Either then,
one must conclude, the old weather-worn plots which slip into the
mind so smoothly that we scarcely notice them&mdash;the legendary,
the prehistoric&mdash;are the only tolerable ones, or we are forced
to suppose that the plot-making genius is so seldom combined with
the genius for creating character that we must allow even
Shakespeare to fail here&mdash;even Shakespeare sometimes lets the
plot dictate to the character; suffers the story to drag the
character out of its natural orbit. And Congreve, who had not
Shakespeare's miraculous fecundity, who could not cover up the
farfetched and the mechanical with the abundance of his imagination
and the splendour of his poetry, fails here. The character is
squeezed to fit the situation; the machine has set its iron stamp
upon live flesh and blood.</p>

<p>But, now that we have dismissed the questions that hang about an
unopened book, let us submit ourselves to the dramatist in action.
The dramatist is in action from the very first word on the very
first page. There are no preliminaries, no introductions; the
curtain rises and they are in the thick of it. Never was any prose
so quick. Miraculously pat, on the spot, each speaker caps the
last, without fumbling or hesitation; their minds are full charged;
it seems as if they had to rein themselves in, bursting with energy
as they are, alive and alert to their finger tips. It is we who
fumble, make irrelevant observations, notice the chocolate or the
cinnamon, the sword or the muslin, until the illusion takes hold of
us, and what with the rhythm of the speech and the indescribable
air of tension, of high breeding that pervades it, the world of the
stage becomes the real world and the other, outside the play, but
the husk and cast-off clothing. To attempt to reduce this first
impression to words is as futile as to explain a physical
sensation&mdash;the slap of a wave, the rush of wind, the scent of
a bean field. It is conveyed by the curl of a phrase on the ear; by
speed; by stillness. It is as impossible to analyse Congreve's
prose as to distinguish the elements&mdash;the bark of a dog, the
song of a bird, the drone of the branches&mdash;which make the
summer air. But then, since words have meaning, we notice here a
sudden depth beneath the surface, a meaning not grasped but felt,
and then come to realise something not merely dazzling in this
world, but natural, for all its wit; even familiar, and
traditional. It has a coarseness, a humour something like
Shakespeare's; a toppling imagination that heaps image upon image;
a lightning swiftness of apprehension that snatches a dozen
meanings and compacts them into one.</p>

<p>And yet it is not Shakespeare's world; for just as we think,
tossed up on the crest of some wonderful extravagance of humour, to
be swept into poetry we come slap against hard common sense, and
realise that here is a different combination of elements from the
poet's. There is tragedy&mdash;Lady Touchwood and Maskwell in
<i>The Double Dealer</i> are not comic figures&mdash;but when
tragedy and comedy collide it is comedy that wins. Lady Touchwood
seizes her dagger; but she drops it. A moment more and it would
have been too late. Already she has passed from prose to rant.
Already we feel not that the scene is ridiculous, for there is
passion there; but that it is unsafe. Congreve has lost his
control, his fine balance is upset; he feels the ground tremble
beneath him. Mr. Brisk's comment, "This is all very surprising, let
me perish", is the appropriate one. With that he finds his feet and
withdraws.</p>

<p>The world that we have entered, then, in Congreve's comedies is
not the world of the elemental passions. It is an enclosure
surrounded with the four walls of a living room. Ladies and
gentlemen go through their figures with their tongues to the
measure dictated by common sense as precisely as they dance the
minuet with their feet; but the image has only a superficial
rightness. We have only to compare Congreve's comedy with
Goldsmith's or with Sheridan's, let alone with Wilde's, to be aware
that if, to distinguish him from the Elizabethans, we confine him
to a room, not a world, that room is not the drawing-room of the
eighteenth century, still less is it the drawing-room of the
nineteenth century. Drays roar on the cobbles beneath; the brawling
of street hucksters and tavern rioters comes in at the open
windows. There is a coarseness of language, an extravagance of
humour, and a freedom of manners which cast us back to the
Elizabethans. Yet it is in a drawing-room, surrounded by all the
fopperies and refinements of the most sophisticated society in the
world, that these ladies and gentlemen speak so freely, drink so
deeply, and smell so strong. It is the contrast, perhaps, that
makes us more aware of the coarseness of the Restoration dramatists
than of the Elizabethan. A great lady who spits on the floor
offends where a fishwife merely amuses. And perhaps it was for this
reason that Congreve incurred first the majestic censure of Dr.
Johnson and then the more supercilious contempt of the Victorians
who neglected, Sir Edmund Gosse informs us, either to read him or
to act him. More conscious than we are of the drawing-room, they
were quicker repelled perhaps by any violation of its
decencies.</p>

<p>But however we may account for the change, to reach <i>The Way
of the World</i> through <i>The Old Bachelor, The Double
Dealer,</i> and <i>Love for Love</i> is to become more and more at
loggerheads with Dr. Johnson's dictum:</p>

<blockquote>It is acknowledged, with universal conviction, that the
perusal of his works will make no man better; and that their
ultimate effect is to represent pleasure in alliance with vice, and
to relax those obligations by which life ought to be
regulated.</blockquote>

<p>On the contrary, to read Congreve's plays is to be convinced
that we may learn from them many lessons much to our advantage both
as writers of books and&mdash;if the division is possible&mdash;as
livers of life. We might learn there, to begin with, the discipline
of plain speech; to leave nothing lurking in the insidious shades
of obscurity that can be said in words. The phrase is always
finished; nothing is left to dwindle into darkness, to sound after
the words are over. Then, when we have learnt to express ourselves,
we may go on to observe the indefatigable hard work of a great
writer: how he keeps us entertained because something is always
happening, and on the alert because that something is always
changing, and by contrasting laughter and seriousness, action and
thought, keeps the edge of the emotions always sharp. To ring so
many changes and keep up so rapid a speed of movement might well be
enough, but in addition each of these characters has its own being,
and each differs&mdash;the sea-dog from the fop, the old eccentric
from the man of the world, the maid from the mistress. He has to
enter into each; to leave his private pigeon-hole and invest
himself with the emotions of another human being, so that speech
meets speech at full tilt, each from its own angle.</p>

<p>A genius for phrase-making helps him. Now he strikes off a
picture in a flash: "...there he lies with a great beard, like a
Russian bear upon a drift of snow". Now in a marvellous rush of
rapid invention he conveys a whole chapter of guttersnipe life.</p>

<blockquote>That I took from the washing of old gauze and weaving
of dead hair, with a bleak blue nose, over a chafing dish of
starv'd embers, and dining behind a traverse rag, in a shop no
bigger than a bird cage.</blockquote>

<p>Then, again, like some miraculous magpie he repeats the naive
words, follows the crude emotions, of a great gawky girl like Miss
Prue. However it is done, to enter into such diverse characters is,
the moralists may note, at any rate to forget your own. Undoubtedly
it is true that his language is often coarse; but then it is also
true that his characters are more alive, quicker to strip off
veils, more intolerant of circumlocutions than the ordinary run of
people. They are reduced to phrase-making oftener than we could
wish, and fine phrases often sound cynical; but then the situations
are often so improbable that only fine phrases will cover them, and
words, we must remember, were still to Congreve's generation as
delightful as beads to a savage. Without that rapture the audacity
of his splendid phrases would have been impossible.</p>

<p>But if we have to admit that some of the characters are immoral,
and some of the opinions cynical, still we must ask how far we can
call a character immoral or an opinion cynical if we feel that the
author himself was aware of its immorality and intended its
cynicism? And, though it is a delicate matter to separate an author
from his characters and detach him from their opinions, no one can
read Congreve's comedies without detecting a common atmosphere, a
general attitude that holds them together for all their diversity.
The stress laid on certain features creates a common likeness as
unmistakable as the eyes and nose of a family face. The plays are
veined through and through with satire. "Therefore I would rail in
my writings and be revenged", says Valentine in <i>Love for
Love.</i> Congreve's satire seems sometimes, as Scandal says, to
have the whole world for its butt. Yet there is underneath a
thinking mind, a mind that doubts and questions. Some hint thrown
out in passing calls us back to make us ponder it: for instance,
Mellefont's "Ay, My Lord, I shall have the same reason for
happiness that your Lordship has, I shall think myself happy". Or,
again, a sudden phrase like "There's comfort in a hand stretched
out to one that's sinking" suggests, by its contrast, a sensibility
that trembles on the edge of tears. Nothing is stressed; sentiment
never broadens into sentimentality; everything passes as quickly as
a ray of light and blends as indistinguishably. But if we needs
must prove that the creator of Sir Sampson Legend and old Foresight
had not only a prodigious sense of human absurdity and a bitter
conviction of its insincerity but as quick a regard for its honesty
and decency as any Victorian or Dr. Johnson himself, we need only
point to his simplicity. After we have run up the scale of
absurdity to its sublime heights a single word again and again
recalls us to common sense. "That my poor father should be so very
silly" is one such comment, immensely effective in its place. Again
and again we are brought back to sanity and daylight by the sound
of a voice speaking in its natural tones.</p>

<p>But it is the Valentines, the Mirabells, the Angelicas, and the
Millamants who keep us in touch with truth and, by striking a
sudden serious note, bring the rest to scale. They have sharpened
their emotions upon their wits. They have flouted each other;
bargained; taken love and examined it by the light of reason;
teased and tested each other almost beyond endurance. But when it
comes to the point and she must be serious, the swiftest of all
heroines, whose mind and body seem equally winged, so that there is
a rush in the air as she passes and we exclaim with Scandal. "Gone;
why, she was never here, nor anywhere else", has a centre of
stillness in her heart and enough emotion in her words to furbish
out a dozen pages of eloquent disquisition. "Why does not the man
take me? Would you have me give myself to you over again?" The
words are simple, and yet, after what has already been said, so
brimming with meaning that Mirabell's reply, "Ay, over and over
again", seems to receive into itself more than words, can say. And
this depth of emotion, we have to reflect, the change and
complexity that are implied in it, have been reached in the direct
way; that is by making each character speak in his or her own
person, without addition from the author or any soliloquy save such
as can be spoken on the stage in the presence of an audience. No,
whether we read him from the moralist's angle or from the artist's,
to agree with Dr. Johnson is an impossibility. To read the comedies
is not to "relax those obligations by which life ought to be
regulated". On the contrary, the more slowly we read him and the
more carefully, the more meaning we find, the more beauty we
discover.</p>

<p>Here perhaps, in the reflections that linger when the book is
shut and <i>The Way of the World</i> is finished, lies the answer
to the old puzzle why at the height of his powers he stopped
writing. It is that he had done all that was possible in that kind.
The last play held more than any audience could grasp at a single
sitting. The bodily presence of actors and actresses must, it would
seem, often overpower the words that they had to speak. He had
forgotten, or disregarded, his own axiom that "the distance of the
stage requires the figures represented to be something larger than
the life". He had written, as he says in the dedication, for "the
<i>Few</i>", and "but little of it was prepar'd for that general
taste which seems now to be predominant in the palates of our
audience". He had come to despise his public, and it was time
therefore either to write differently or to leave off. But the
novel, which offered another outlet, was uncongenial; he was
incorrigibly dramatic, as his one attempt at fiction shows. And
poetry, too, was denied him, for though again and again he brings
us to the edge of poetry in a phrase like "You're a woman, One to
whom Heav'n gave beauty, when it grafted roses on a briar", and
suggests, as. Meredith does in his novels, the mood of poetry, he
was unable to pass beyond human idiosyncrasy to the more general
statement of poetry. He must move and laugh and bring us into touch
with action instantly.</p>

<p>Since these two paths then were blocked, what other way was
there for a writer of Congreve's temperament but to make an end?
Dangerous as it is to distinguish a writer from his work, we cannot
help but recognise a man behind the plays&mdash;a man as sensitive
to criticism as he was skilled in inflicting it on others; for what
is his defiance of the critics but deference to them? A scholar too
with all the scholar's fastidiousness; a man of birth and breeding
for whom the vulgar side of fame held little gratification; a man,
in short, who might well have said with Valentine, "Nay, I am not
violently bent upon the trade", and sit, handsome and portly and
sedate as his portrait shows him, "very gravely with his hat over
his eyes", as the gossips observed him, content to strive no
more.</p>

<p>But indeed he left very little for the gossips to feed upon; no
writer of his time and standing passed through the world more
privately. Voltaire left a dubious anecdote; the Duchess of
Marlborough, it is said, had an effigy of him set at her table
after his death; his few discreet letters provide an occasional
hint: "Ease and quiet is what I hunt after"; "I feel very sensibly
and silently for those whom I love"&mdash;that is all. But there is
a fitness in this very absence of relics as though he had consumed
whatever was irrelevant to his work and left us to find him there.
And there, indeed, we find something beyond himself; beyond the
many figures of his fertile and brilliant imagination; beyond
Tattle and Ben, Foresight and Angelica, Maskwell and Lady Wishfort,
Mirabell and Mellefont and Millamant. Between them they have
created what is not to be confined within the limits of a single
character or expressed in any one play&mdash;a world where each
part depends upon the other, the serene, impersonal, and
indestructible world of art.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>STERNE'S GHOST</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1925</i></b>
</p>

<p>That men have ghosts; that ghosts revisit the places where life
ran quickest; that Sterne therefore haunts no churchyard, but the
room where <i>Tristram Shandy</i> was written&mdash;all this may be
taken for granted; even if we find it no such easy matter to decide
in what mood and with what motives the ghost of Sterne beat
regularly at midnight upon the wall of Mrs. Simpson's best bedroom
in Stonegate, Yorks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson made no secret of the matter, which perhaps was too
notorious to be concealed. Owing to the ghost, she told the young
Mathews, she would let the rooms, large as they were and convenient
for the theatre, very cheap indeed, and perceiving something in
Mrs. Mathews's aspect which made her think her, as indeed she was,
"a candidate for literary gains", she added how it was in this room
and at that very table that a very famous book called <i>Tristram
Shandy</i> was written, she believed, some forty years before. Even
without its literary associations the cheapness of the lodging was
enough to excuse the ghost, for the young Mathews were extremely
poor&mdash;Charles acting at a salary of twenty-five shillings a
week in Tate Wilkinson's company, but Tate did not scruple to tell
him that with his screwed-up face and threadpaper body he had
better keep a shop than go upon the stage, while poor Eliza, the
girl whom Charles had married, out of pity, the second Mrs. Mathews
said, without <i>"really</i> loving her", had not a penny to her
name, which happened to be Strong. And Strong she had need to be,
said Charles's father, strong in character, strong in health,
strong in principles, strong in affections, if she became the wife
of the misguided boy who so wantonly preferred the stage and all
its evils to selling serious books to saintly personages in the
Strand. But Eliza herself was conscious of one source of strength
only (besides that she was very much in love with her husband) and
that was her gift for writing&mdash;her passion for literature.
When Mrs. Simpson at one and the same moment lowered the rent and
mentioned Sterne, the bargain was struck and the rooms taken. The
ghost must be endured.</p>

<p>That necessity arose, indeed, the very first night the Mathews
went to bed. As York Minster struck the first chimes of midnight
three powerful blows resounded on the wall at the back of the young
couple's bed. The same thing happened night after night. York
Minster had only to begin striking twelve and the ghost struck
three. Watch was set; experiments were made; but whether it was the
ghost of Sterne or the malevolence of some ill-wisher, no cause
could be discovered and the young people could only move their bed,
and shift their bedtime, which, as the playhouse hours were late
and Charles had a passion for reading or talking late at night, was
a matter of not much difficulty. Such courage could hardly have
been expected of so frail a woman. But unfortunately Eliza had a
reason for tolerating ghosts, if they reduced the rent, which she
dared not tell her Husband. Every week, like the honest and
affectionate creature he was, he poured his
salary&mdash;twenty-five shillings&mdash;into her lap, and every
week she assured him that twenty-five shillings was ample&mdash;all
their bills were paid. But every week a certain number, an
increasing number, for all she could do to keep their expenses
down, were slipped, unpaid, into Sterne's table drawer. Eliza
perhaps had some inkling of the fact that her husband had married
her impetuously in the goodness of his heart, from pity that the
only child of the late Dr. Strong should have to support herself by
inculcating the principles of arithmetic into the daughters of the
gentlemen of Swansea. At any rate, she was determined that he
should never suffer for his generosity. Comforts he must have, and
if twenty-five shillings a week were not enough to pay for them she
would pay for them herself out of her own earnings. She was
confident that she could do it. She would write a novel, a novel
like <i>Tristram Shandy</i> perhaps, save that her knowledge of
life was unfortunately limited, which would set all London in a
roar. And then she would come to her husband with the bills
receipted and her deception confessed, and give him the proceeds of
her famous novel to do what he liked with. But that day was still
far distant&mdash;at present she must work. While Charles was
acting and reading, while Charles, who loved talk and hated
bedtime, was gossiping and chattering and taking off odd
characters, so that he was famous in the green room whatever he
might be upon the stage, Eliza wrote. She wrote every kind of
piece&mdash;novels, sonnets, elegies, love songs. The publishers
took them, the publishers printed them, but they never paid her a
penny for them, and on she toiled, always carefully concealing her
work from her husband, so that his surprise when the day of
revelation came might be entire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bills accumulated, and act as Charles might (and
there were some young ladies in York who thought him the finest
comic actor they had ever seen, and would stand a whole evening in
the wings to hear him) his salary remained twenty-five shillings
and no more. It was useless for the ghost to knock; useless for
Eliza's back to ache; useless for her good brother-in-law William
to implore her to write everything twice over, peruse the best
works of the best authors, and find mottoes for all her
chapters&mdash;she had no choice; write she must. Surely the novel
she was now engaged on&mdash;<i>What Has Been</i>&mdash;promised
better than the others, and with a little help from William, who
knew Mr. Wordsworth and could perhaps solicit the favours of
reviewers, might, indeed must, bring her fame. Sitting where Sterne
had sat, writing where Sterne had written, the omens were
auspicious.</p>

<p>There, at any rate, long after the ghost had knocked thrice and
York Minster had tolled twelve times, she sat writing. She
neglected to take exercise. She never allowed herself to stand in
the wings a whole evening to see her Charles in his comic parts. At
last signs of exhaustion became apparent. Alarmed by her wasted
looks, Charles brought a doctor to see her. But one glance was
enough. Nothing could now be done. Whatever the cause, lack of
exercise or lack of food, or whether the nervous strain of hearing
those three taps delivered nightly had hopelessly injured her
constitution, consumption was far advanced; and all the doctor
could do was to prescribe apothecaries' stuff, which, expensive as
it was, Charles feared to be useless.</p>

<p>Eliza was now confined to bed. Her projects had totally failed.
<i>What Has Been</i> appeared, but, even corrected and at least
partially supplied with mottoes by the kindness of Mr. William
Mathews, failed like its predecessors, and she was at an end of her
resources. Even so, the worst was still to come. The butcher or the
baker stopped Charles in the street and demanded payment. The
drawer and its bills had to be revealed. The whole of her
miserable, innocent, overwhelming deception must be confessed.
Charles took the blow like an angel, said not a word of complaint,
though the bills were to hang about his neck for years to come. And
now, for the first time, the ghost fell silent. York Minster struck
midnight and there was no reply. But really the silence was worse
than the sound! To lie and wait for the three stout strokes as York
Minster struck twelve, and then to hear nothing&mdash;that seemed
to convey a more appalling message than the blow itself&mdash;as if
the enemy had worked its will and gone its way. But this very
silence inspired Eliza Mathews with a desperate courage. With the
ghost quiescent, the novels unsold, the bills unpaid, Charles all
day at the playhouse, often cast down by his failure and the
thought of his father's displeasure&mdash;for the God-fearing
bookseller in the Strand, where the whole house was hung with
portraits of the Saints framed in ebony, and canting humbugs
bamboozled the simple old tradesman out of his livelihood, had been
justified in his warnings&mdash;with all this that she had caused,
or failed to prevent, to oppress her, and the daily decline of her
own health to appal, Eliza framed a terrible and desperate resolve.
There was a girl at the playhouse for whom she had an affection, a
singer who was friendless as Eliza herself had been, and timid and
charming. For this young woman, Anne Jackson by name, Eliza sent.
She was better, Eliza claimed, as Anne came in, and indeed her
looks confirmed it; much better, because of an idea that had come
to her, which she counted on her friend's help to carry out. First,
before her husband came back, she wished to be propped up in bed,
in order, she said mysteriously, "to be able to look at you both
while I reveal my project". Directly Charles Mathews appeared, and
exclaimed in his turn at her sparkle, her animation, she began.
Sitting up, forced often to pause for breath, she said how she knew
her fate; death was inevitable; how the thought of her husband's
loneliness oppressed her&mdash;worse, the thought that he would
marry again a woman who did not understand him. Here she paused
exhausted, and Charles looked at Anne and Anne at Charles, as if to
ask had she lost her reason? On she went again. It was even worse,
she said, to think of Anne left in her youth and inexperience
without such help as she, Eliza, might have given her. Thoughts of
this kind embittered her last moments. Surely, then, they would
grant the last request she would ever make? She took her husband's
hand and kissed it; then took her friend's and kissed that too "in
a solemn manner, which I remember made me tremble all over", and at
last framed her terrible request. Would they, there and then,
pledge themselves to marry each other when she was dead?</p>

<p>Both were flabbergasted. Anne burst into floods of tears. Never,
she cried, never could she contemplate marriage with Mr. Mathews
She esteemed him; she admired him; she thought him the first comic
actor of the age; that was all. Charles himself fairly scolded the
dying woman for putting them in such an awful predicament. He ran
after the sobbing girl to implore her to believe that it was none
of his doing&mdash;that his wife was raving and no longer knew what
she said. And so Eliza died. For months a coldness, an awkwardness,
existed between the widower and his wife's friend. They scarcely
met. Then at the same moment on the same night the same vision
visited them, far apart as they were, in their sleep. Eliza came
imploring to the side of each. Well, said Anne, it must be destiny;
Shakespeare said so; "marriage comes of destiny", he said, and she
was disposed to agree with Shakespeare. Twelve months after she had
sworn that she could never feel anything but esteem for Mr.
Mathews, she was his wife.</p>

<p>But what conclusion are we led to draw from the behaviour of
Sterne's ghost? Was it malicious or tender, did it come to warn or
to mock, or merely to dip its handkerchief once more in the tears
of lovers? Nobody could say. Charles Mathews told the story of the
Stonegate ghost a hundred times in the green room at York, but
nobody came forward with an explanation. Again one night he was
telling the story, when an old actress who had returned to the
stage after a long absence and had heard nothing of the ghost or of
the Mathews, exclaimed in astonishment "Why, that was my dear Billy
Leng!" And then she told them how they lodged next door to Mrs.
Simpson's in Stonegate; how her dear Billy had been bedridden for
many years; how, as his infirmities increased, so did his fear of
robbers; how, being the most methodical of men, and growing more so
with age, he waited always for York Minster to chime midnight and
then took his crutch-handled stick and beat forcibly on the calico
at the back of his bed to warn any thief who might be concealed
there. "It was no ghost," she cried, "it was my dear Billy
Leng!"</p>

<p>Cleared of the imputation which the ghost of Sterne had cast
upon them, Mrs. Simpson now let her rooms for the ordinary sum.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>MRS. THRALE</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in February 1941</i></b>
</p>

<p>No one can destroy Boswell's sketch of Mrs. Thrale. It is done
with such venom and such vivacity; it contains so much of Boswell
himself, and, like all Boswell's portraits, it fits so perfectly
into its place in the picture. But Mr. Clifford* has done what is
far more valuable and more difficult. He has gone behind Boswell's
sketch and beyond it. He has amplified it and solidified it. He has
brought Mrs. Thrale herself into the foreground. And by so doing he
has changed the proportions of the picture.</p>

<p>[* <i>Hester Lynch Piozzi (Mrs. Thrale).</i> By James L.
Clifford.]</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale herself has lived an ambiguous scattered life all
these years in a mass of half published or unpublished documents
sprinkled over England and America. And for years Mr. Clifford has
been tracking her down and piecing her together with the most
devoted care and the most triumphant results. If it were not that
her diary and her commonplace book are still in the hands of an
American editor, we should suppose that the whole woman is now
before us. As it is we know her better perhaps than almost any
living person. We can follow her, as we cannot follow our friends,
at a foot's pace for more than eighty years. Yet the effect of this
minute illumination is baffling. The more we know of people the
less we can sum them up. Just as we think to hold the bird in our
hands, the bird flits off. Who can explain, for example, why the
brilliant and precocious Hester consented to marry the man whom Mr.
Clifford now reveals in his entirety&mdash;the odious Thrale? When
her father discovered their clandestine correspondence he fell dead
in a fit. And for once the incompetent, irascible, impecunious
Welsh squire was in the right. No marriage could have been more
incongruous. Hester was impressionable, generous, intellectual.
Thrale was a cold, callous, conventional man of business who aped
the habits of the aristocracy but was without their distinction,
who had the grossness of the middle class but lacked their
geniality. If he had any affection besides his passion for meat and
drink, it was not for Hester but for her mother. Yet Hester married
him and was at once immured in the great house at Streatham, "like
a kept mistress", as Johnson said, "shut from the world".</p>

<p>It was her marriage, however, that gave depth to her
relationship with Johnson. Had she been happy, she would never have
known him as she did. He gave her, of course, the obvious
things&mdash;stimulus, society, an outlet for her irrepressible
curiosity and ambition. But the friendship between the young wife
and the old man was based on deeper things. Johnson was not merely
a distinguished guest at dinner. He had the run of the house. He
and his hostess went together behind the scenes. It was to Johnson
that Mrs. Thrale turned when her eyes were red with
crying&mdash;when Queeney snubbed her; when Mr. Thrale took another
mistress; when ruin threatened them; when one after another the
children were born, and the children fell ill and died. "What shall
I do? What can I do? Has the flattery of my friends made me too
proud of my Brains? and must these poor Children suffer for my
crime?" she cried out to him in her anguish. He gave her counsel
and confidence. In return she gave him a share in the family, a
stake in the next generation, and domesticity. It was by "the
pump-side in the kitchen garden" at Streatham that Johnson was
caught "fusing metals" when Mr. Thrale came back from the city and
put out the fire. One anecdote sums up their relationship. Johnson
had been more than usually rude to her in company, and some one
protested. But Mrs. Thrale passed it off with a smile. "Oh dear
good man!" she said. And when the words were repeated to Johnson
"he seemed much delighted...and repeated in a loud whisper, Oh dear
good man!"</p>

<p>Why, then, when Mr. Thrale finally ate himself to death, did a
friendship that had been daily rubbed and tried for sixteen years
come to an end? Partly, as Mr. Clifford makes plain, because Mrs.
Thrale had suppressed a great deal. She had certain individual
tastes of her own. One was a romantic passion for the scenery of
Wales; another was a genuine love for painting. But when the three
of them travelled in Wales, neither Johnson nor Thrale had a word
of praise for the landscape; and in Paris she was left to gaze for
hours in the galleries alone. Again as a writer&mdash;she scribbled
incessantly&mdash;she was by nature an innovator. "Why, she
wondered, should there be one set of words for writing and another
for speaking?" She saw no reason why one should not write as one
speaks, familiarly, colloquially; and her pages, "crowded with
familiar phrases and vulgar idioms", roused the disgust of the
conventional. Clearly there were a thousand curiosities and desires
dormant in her that the old man could not gratify. So long as she
was Thrale's wife and the mistress of Streatham she must suppress
them. But when her husband's dead weight was lifted off her, up she
sprang. She became again the precocious and impulsive Hester
Salusbury. Perhaps marriage had kept her youth green in
her&mdash;she was only just past forty when she became a widow. And
one day before Thrale's death Mrs. Byron had warned her, while
Piozzi sang to the harpsichord: "You know, I suppose, that that man
is in Love with you?"</p>

<p>"That man" is one of Mr. Clifford's most remarkable
reconstructions. To the Streatham circle he was merely "an Italian
musick master". When they had said that they had said enough. But
in fact he was an Italian gentleman of great charm and cultivation;
a composer and performer of merit; and a passionate lover of music.
He travelled with a small harpsichord fitted under the seat so that
he could play Mozart and Haydn on the roads. They floated on a
barge down the Brenta to the strains of his music. Nor was he
lacking in the sober virtues. He managed Mrs. Piozzi's tangled
money matters admirably, and he ended his days in Wales giving plum
puddings to villagers and performing the duties of a country
gentleman. Yet at the notion that such a man could marry a brewer's
widow, the whole company of distinguished people who had feasted at
her table took flight in one flock. Johnson trumpeted his rage.
"She has now become a subject for her enemies to exult over, and
for her friends, if she has any left, to forget or pity." "Heaven
be praised," exclaimed the Queen of the Blues, "that I have no
daughters." It was only charity that led her to conclude that Mrs.
Thrale was mad. For Johnson there is the excuse that he had lost at
one blow Streatham and its peaches and its pork pies and the
undivided attention of his lady. The old elephant was jealous, and
his rage has at least the dignity of wounded passion. But how are
we to explain the conduct of the others? Only perhaps by supposing
that it is almost impossible even for genius and learning to swim
against the conventions of their time. And while genius and
learning come down the stream untouched, the conventions in which
they exist soon become obsolete and ridiculous. An Italian music
master in the eighteenth century was, we must suppose, equal to a
negro to-day. To explain the conduct of the Streatham set we must
imagine the attitude of society to-day to a lady of rank who has
contracted an alliance with a negro and expects Mayfair to open its
doors to her dusky and illegitimate brood.</p>

<p>But the more we excuse the Streatham set, the more we must
admire Mrs. Piozzi. Her passion for Piozzi made her for once
concentrated and direct. There is a fine ring in her letter to
Johnson.</p>

<blockquote>The birth of my second husband (she told him) is not
meaner than that of my first; his sentiments are not meaner; his
profession is not meaner...till you have changed your opinion of
Mr. Piozzi let us converse no more.</blockquote>

<p>With those words she should have vanished down the Brenta to the
strains of Mozart. Unfortunately, Mr. Clifford has an inexhaustible
supply of those little facts that reduce music to common speech.
With Johnson it is plain that Mrs. Thrale had lost her centre. Now
there was some screw loose. The whirligig spins faster and faster.
She was for ever dipping and sampling, quarrelling and chattering.
She was impulsive and impressionable, but she was also obtuse and
tactless. Her children found her intolerable Fanny Burney resented
her patronage. She decked her little body in grebe skins and tiger
shawls and flaxen wigs and many-coloured ribbons. She made a fool
of herself with her adopted nephew, and let herself be cheated out
of six thousand pounds to buy him a baronetcy. There was a
coarseness in her fibre and a commonness in her vision that explain
why, as an observer, she was so greatly inferior to Boswell.</p>

<p>Yet the spin of the whirligig has its fascination. Her appetite
for life was prodigious. She must have someone to worship. Mrs.
Siddons succeeded Dr. Johnson. Mr. Conway succeeded Mrs. Siddons.
When there was no hero to entertain, she devoured books. And when
the books were read, and the letters written, and the copy books
filled, she had out her telescope and scoured the horizon. One day
she counted forty-one sails out to sea. Then, turning her telescope
to the earth, she discovered Sir John Williams five miles away
searching for something in his garden. What could it be? She could
not rest until she had sent a servant to ascertain that Sir John
was looking for his watch.</p>

<p>At last, at the age of eighty, she led the dance at her birthday
party with her nephew; and danced indefatigably till dawn. That was
in 1820. By that time one has almost forgotten Boswell's sketch. It
was a snapshot at one particular moment. But the moment has long
been covered over. She has loved; she has travelled; she has known
everybody; she has been in the depths of despair and on the crest
of the wave times without counting. The portrait of the old lady in
the huge bonnet shows a very modern face, with her great vivacious
eyes, her loose lips, and the deep scar over the mouth which, by
her own wish, the artist has faithfully depicted. For that was the
scar she got when her horse threw her in 1774 at Streatham.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>SIR WALTER SCOTT. GAS AT
ABBOTSFORD</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in January 1940</i></b>
</p>

<p>Either Scott the novelist is swallowed whole and becomes r part
of the body and brain, or he is rejected entirely. There is no
middle party in existence&mdash;no busybodies run from camp to camp
with offers of mediation. For there is no war. The novels of
Dickens, Trollope, Henry James, Tolstoy, the
Bront&euml;s&mdash;they are discussed perpetually; the Waverley
novels never. There they remain, completely accepted, entirely
rejected&mdash;a queer stage in that ever-changing process which is
called immortality. If anything is going to break the deadlock
perhaps it is the first volume of Scott's Journal, 1825-1826, which
Mr. J. G. Tait has been at immense pains to edit and revise. As
Scott's Journals are the best life of Scott in existence, as they
contain Scott in his glory and Scott in his gloom, and gossip about
Byron, and the famous comment upon Jane Austen, as in a few
passages Scott throws more light upon his genius and its
limitations than all his critics in their innumerable volumes, this
new version may one of these dark nights bring the two
non-combatants to blows.</p>

<p>By way of inducing that desirable encounter, let us take the
entry for November 21st, 1825: "Went to the Oil Gas Committee this
morning, of which concern I am President or Chairman". Scott, as
Lockhart tells us and we can well believe, had a passion for gas.
He loved a bright light, and he did not mind a slight smell. As for
the expense of those innumerable pipes, in dining-room,
drawing-room, corridors, and bedrooms, and the men's wages&mdash;he
swept all that aside in those glorious days when his imagination
was at its height. "The state of an illumination was constantly
kept up"; and the gas shone upon a brilliant company. Everyone was
flocking to Abbotsford&mdash;dukes and duchesses, lion hunters and
toadies, the famous and the obscure. "Oh dear," Miss Scott
exclaimed. "Will this never end, Papa?" And her father replied,
"Let them come, the more the merrier." And someone else walked
in.</p>

<p>One night, a year or two before the diary begins, the stranger
was a young artist. Artists were so common at Abbotsford that
Scott's dog, Maida, recognised them at sight and got up and left
the room. This time it was William Bewick, obscure, penniless, in
pursuit of sitters. Naturally he was a good deal dazzled both by
the gas and the company. Kind Mrs. Hughes, therefore, the wife of
the deaf Dean of St. Paul's, tried to put him at his ease. She told
him how she had often soothed her children's quarrels by showing
them Bewick's woodcuts. But William Bewick was no relation of
Thomas Bewick. One feels that he had heard the remark before and
rather resented it, for was he not a painter himself?</p>

<p>He was a painter himself, and an extremely bad one. Did not
Haydon say "Bewick, my pupil, has realised my hopes in his picture
of Jacob and Rachel"? Did he not add, some years later, when they
had quarrelled about money, "Daniel's left foot and leg would have
disgraced Bewick before he ran away from my tuition to the shelter
of Academical wings"? But we know without Haydon's testimony that
Bewick's portraits were intolerable. We know that from his writing.
His friends are always painted in a state of violent physical
agitation, but mentally they are stock still, stone dead. There is
his picture of Hazlitt playing tennis. "He looked more like a
savage animal than anything human..." He cast off his shirt; he
leapt; he darted; when the game was over he rubbed himself against
a post, dripping with sweat. But when he spoke, "His ejaculations
were interlarded", Bewick says, "with unintentional and unmeaning
oaths." They cannot be repeated; they must be imagined; in other
words, Hazlitt was dumb. Or take Bewick's account of an evening
party in a small room when the Italian poet Foscolo met Wordsworth.
They argued. Foscolo "deliberately doubled his fist and held it in
Wordsworth's face close to his nose". Then, suddenly, he began
whirling round the room, tossing his quizzing glass, rolling his
R's, bawling. The ladies "drew in their feet and costumes".
Wordsworth sat "opening his mouth and eyes, gasping for breath". At
last he spoke. For page after page he spoke; or rather dead phrases
coagulated upon his lips, in frozen and lifeless entanglements.
Listen for a moment. "Although I appreciate, and I hope, can admire
sufficiently the beauties of Raphael's transcendent genius...yet we
must brace the sinews, so to speak, of our comprehension to grapple
with the grandeur and sublimity...of Michael Angelo..." It is
enough. We see Bewick's pictures; we realise how intolerable it
became to sit any longer under the portrait of Grandpapa flinging
out a bare arm from the toga while the horse in the background
champs his bit, paws the ground, and seems to neigh.</p>

<p>That night at Abbotsford the gas blazed from the three great
chandeliers over the dinner-table; and the dinner, "as my 'friend,
Thackeray, would have said, was recherche". Then they went into the
drawing-room&mdash;a vast apartment with its mirrors, its marble
tables, Chantrey's bust, the varnished woodwork and the crimson
tasselled curtains pendant from handsome brass rods. They went in
and Bewick was dazzled&mdash;"The brilliant gaslight, the elegance
and taste displayed throughout this beautiful apartment, the
costumes of the ladies, with the sparkle and glitter of the
tea-table"&mdash;the scene, as Bewick describes it, brings back all
the worst passages in the Waverley Novels. We can see the jewels
sparkling, we can smell the gas escaping, we can hear the
conversation. There is Lady Scott gossiping with kind Mrs. Hughes;
there is Scott himself, prosing and pompous, grumbling about his
son Charles and his passion for sport. "But I suppose it will have
an end at a given time, like any other hobby of youth." To complete
the horror, the German Baron D'este strums on the guitar. He is
showing "how in Germany they introduced into guitar performances of
martial music the imitation of the beating of drums" Miss
Scott&mdash;or is she Miss Wardour or another of the vapid and
vacant Waverley novel heroines?&mdash;hangs over him entranced.
Then, suddenly, the whole scene changes. Scott began in a low
mournful voice to recite the ballad of Sir Patrick Spens:</p>

<blockquote><i>Oh lang lang may their ladies sit<br>
With their fans in their hands<br>
Or e'er they see Sir Patrick Spens<br>
Come sailing to the land.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>The guitar stopped; Sir Walter's lips trembled as he came to an
end. So it happens, too, in the novels&mdash;the lifeless English
turns to living Scots.</p>

<p>Bewick came again. Again he joined that extraordinary company,
all distinguished either for their genius or for their rank. Again
the tiny red beads of light in the chandeliers blossomed at the
turn of a screw into "a gush of splendour worthy of the palace of
Aladdin". And there they all were, those gas-lit celebrities,
dashed in with the usual dabs of bright oily paint: Lord Minto in
plain black, wearing a most primitive tie; Lord Minto's chaplain,
with his saturnine expression and his hair combed and cut as if by
the edge of a barber's basin; Lord Minto's servant, so enthralled
by Scott's stories that he forgot to change the plates; Sir John
Malcolm wearing his star and ribbon; and little Johnny Lockhart
gazing at the star. "You must try and get hold of one," said Sir
Walter, upon which Lockhart smiled, "...the only time I have
observed him to relieve his fixed features from that impenetrable
reserve, etc., etc." And again they went into that beautiful
apartment, and Sir John announced that he was about to tell his
famous Persian story. Everybody must be summoned. Summoned they
were.</p>

<p>From all quarters of that teeming and hospitable house guests
came flocking. "One young lady, I remember, was brought from her
sick-bed wrapt in blankets and laid on the sofa." The story began;
the story went on. So long was it that it had to be cut into
"miles". At the end of one Sir John stopped and asked "Shall I go
on?" "Do go on, do go on, Sir John," Lady Scott entreated, and on
he went, mile after mile, until&mdash;from where?&mdash;there
appeared Monsieur Alexandre, the French ventriloquist, who at once
began to imitate the planing of a French-polished dinner-table.
"The attitude, the action, the noise, the screeches and hitches at
knots, throwing off the shavings with his left hand, were all so
perfect that Lady Scott, in alarm, screamed 'Oh! my dining-room
table, you are spoiling my dining-room table! It will never be got
bright again!'" And Sir Walter had to reassure her. "It is only
imitation, my dear...it is only make-believe...he will not hurt the
table." And the screeching began again, and Lady Scott screamed
again, and on it went, the screeching and the screaming, until the
sweat poured from the ventriloquist's forehead, and it was time for
bed.</p>

<p>Scott took Bewick to his room; on the way he stopped; he spoke.
His words were simple&mdash;oddly simple, and yet after all that
gas and glitter they seem to come from the living lips of an
ordinary human being. The muscles are relaxed; the toga slips off
him. "You, I suppose, would be of the stock of Sir Robert Bewick?"
That was all, but it was enough&mdash;enough to make Bewick feel
that the great man, for all his greatness, had noted his
discomfiture when Mrs. Hughes was so tactful, and wished to give
him his chance. He took it. "I," he exclaimed, "am of a very
ancient family, the Bewicks of Annan, who lost their estates..."
Out it all came; on it all went. Then Scott opened the bedroom
door, and showed him the gas&mdash;how you can turn it up, how you
can turn it down. And, expressing the hope that his guest would be
comfortable&mdash;if not, he was to ring the bell&mdash;Scott left
him. But Bewick could not sleep. He tossed and tumbled. He thought,
as the people in his pictures must have thought, about magicians'
cells, alchemists' spells, lions' lairs, the pallet of poverty, and
the downy couch of luxury. Then, remembering the great man and his
goodness, he burst into tears, prayed, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>We, however, can follow Scott to his room. By the light of his
journals, the natural and fitful light of happiness and sorrow, we
can see him after the party was over, when poor Charlotte chattered
no more, and Maida had gone where, let us hope, artists no longer
paint the favourite dogs of celebrated men. But after a party is
over, some saying, some figure often remains in the mind. Now it is
the ventriloquist, Monsieur Alexandre. Was Scott himself, we ask,
glancing at the long line of the Waverley Novels, merely the
greatest of all the ventriloquist novelists, of all who imitate
human speech without hurting the dining-room table&mdash;it is all
make-believe, my dear, it is all imitation? Or was he the last of
the playwright novelists, who, when the pressure of emotion is
strong enough behind them can leap the bounds of prose and make
real thoughts and real emotions issue in real words from living
lips? So many playwrights did; but of novelists who&mdash;except
Sir Walter and, perhaps, Dickens? To write as they did, to keep so
hospitable and teeming a house, where earls and artists,
ventriloquists and barons, dogs and young ladies speak each in
character, must not one be as they were, half-ventriloquist,
half-poet? And is it not the combination in the Waverley Novels of
gas and daylight, ventriloquy and truth, that separates the two
parties, and might they not, using the journals as stepping-stones,
with a glance at these crude illustrations from the brush of
William Bewick, break the deadlock and come to blows?</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>SIR WALTER SCOTT. THE ANTIQUARY</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1924</i></b>
</p>

<p>There are some writers who have entirely ceased to influence
others, whose fame is for that reason both serene and cloudless,
who are enjoyed or neglected rather than criticised and read. Among
them is Scott. The most impressionable beginner, whose pen
oscillates if exposed within a mile of the influence of Stendhal,
Flaubert, Henry James, or Chekhov, can read the Waverley Novels one
after another without altering an adjective. Yet there are no books
perhaps upon which at this moment more thousands of readers are
brooding and feasting in a rapture of uncritical and silent
satisfaction. And if this is the mood in which the Waverley Novels
are read, the inference is perhaps that there is something vicious
about such a pleasure; it cannot be defended; it must be enjoyed in
secret. Let us run through <i>The Antiquary</i> again and make a
note or two as we go. The first charge that is levelled against
Scott is that his style is execrable. Every page of the novel, it
is true, is watered down with long languid Latin
words&mdash;peruse, manifest, evince. Old metaphors out of the
property box come flapping their dusty wings across the sky. The
sea in the heat of a crisis is "the devouring element". A gull on
the same occasion is a "winged denizen of the crag". Taken from
their context it is impossible to deny that such expressions sound
wrong, though a good case might be made against the snobbery which
insists upon preserving class distinctions even among words. But
read currently in their places, it is difficult either to notice or
to condemn them. As Scott uses them they fulfil their purpose and
merge perfectly in their surroundings. Great novelists who are
going to fill seventy volumes write after all in pages, not in
sentences, and have at their command, and know when to use, a dozen
different styles of varying intensities. The genteel pen is a very
useful pen in its place. These slips and slovenlinesses serve as
relaxations; they give the reader breathing space and air the book.
Let us compare Scott the slovenly with Stevenson the precise. "It
was as he said: there was not a breath stirring; a windless
stricture of frost had bound the air; and as we went forth in the
shine of the candles, the blackness was like a roof over our
heads." One may search the Waverley Novels in vain for such close
writing as this. But if we get from Stevenson a much closer idea of
a single object, we get from Scott an incomparably larger
impression of the whole. The storm in <i>The Antiquary,</i> made up
as it is of stage hangings and cardboard screens, of "denizens of
the crags" and "clouds like disasters round a sinking empire",
nevertheless roars and splashes and almost devours the group
huddled on the crag; while the storm in <i>Kidnapped,</i> for all
its exact detail and its neat dapper adjectives, is incapable of
wetting the sole of a lady's slipper.</p>

<p>The much more serious charge against Scott is that he used the
wrong pen, the genteel pen, not merely to fill in the background
and dash off a cloud piece, but to describe the intricacies and
passions of the human heart. But what language to use of the Lovels
and Isabellas, the Darsies, Ediths, and Mortons! As well talk of
the hearts of seagulls and the passions and intricacies of
walking-sticks and umbrellas; for indeed these ladies and gentlemen
are scarcely to be distinguished from the winged denizens of the
crag. They are equally futile; equally impotent; they squeak; they
flutter; and a strong smell of camphor exudes from their poor dried
breasts when, with a dismal croaking and cawing, they emit the
astonishing language of their love-making.</p>

<p>"Without my father's consent, I will never entertain the
addresses of anyone; and how totally impossible it is that he
should countenance the partiality with which you honour me, you are
yourself fully aware," says the young lady. "Do not add to the
severity of repelling my sentiments the rigour of obliging me to
disavow them," replies the young gentleman; and he may be
illegitimate, and he may be the son of a peer, or he may be both
one and the other, but it would take a far stronger inducement than
that to make us care a straw what happens to Lovel and his
Isabella.</p>

<p>But then, perhaps, we are not meant to care a straw. When Scott
has pacified his conscience as a magistrate by alluding to the
sentiments of the upper classes in tones of respect and esteem,
when he has vindicated his character as a moralist by awakening
"the better feelings and sympathies of his readers by strains of
generous sentiment and tales of fictitious woe", he was quit both
of art and of morals, and could scribble endlessly for his own
amusement. Never was a change more emphatic; never one more wholly
to the good. One is tempted, indeed, to suppose that he did it,
half-consciously, on purpose&mdash;he showed up the languor of the
fine gentlemen who bored him by the immense vivacity of the common
people whom he loved. Images, anecdotes, illustrations drawn from
sea, sky, and earth, race and bubble from their lips. They shoot
every thought as it flies, and bring it tumbling to the ground in
metaphor. Sometimes it is a phrase&mdash;"at the back of a dyke, in
a wreath o' snaw, or in the wame o' a wave"; sometimes a
proverb&mdash;"he'll no can haud down his head to sneeze, for fear
o' seeing his shoon"; always the dialogue is sharpened and pointed,
by the use of that Scottish dialect which is at once so homely and
so pungent, so colloquial and so passionate, so shrewd and so
melancholy into the bargain. And the result is strange. For since
the sovereigns who should preside have abdicated, since we are
afloat on a broad and breezy sea without a pilot, the Waverley
Novels are as unmoral as Shakespeare's plays. Nor, for some
readers, is it the least part of their astonishing freshness, their
perennial vitality, that you may read them over and over again, and
never know for certain what Scott himself was or what Scott himself
thought.</p>

<p>We know, however, what his characters are, and we know it almost
as we know what our friends are by hearing their voices and
watching their faces simultaneously. However often one may have
read <i>The Antiquary,</i> Jonathan Oldbuck is slightly different
every time. We notice different things; our observation of face and
voice differs; and thus Scott's characters, like Shakespeare's and
Jane Austen's, have the seed of life in them. They change as we
change. But though this gift is an essential element in what we
call immortality, it does not by any means prove that the character
lives as profoundly, as fully, as Falstaff lives or Hamlet. Scott's
characters, indeed, suffer from a serious disability; it is only
when they speak that they are alive; they never think; as for
prying into their minds himself, or drawing inferences from their
behaviour, Scott never attempted it. "Miss Wardour, as if she felt
that she had said too much, turned and got into the
carriage"&mdash;he will penetrate no further into the privacy of
Miss Wardour than that; and it is not far. But this matters the
less because the characters he cared for were by temperament
chatterboxes; Edie Ochiltree, Oldbuck, Mrs. Mucklebackit talk
incessantly. They reveal their characters in talk. If they stop
talking it is to act. By their talk and by their acts&mdash;that is
how we know them.</p>

<p>But how far then can we know people, the hostile critic may ask,
if we only know that they say this and do that, if they never talk
about themselves, and if their creator lets them go their ways,
provided they forward his plot, in complete independence of his
supervision or interference? Are they not all of them, Ochiltrees,
Antiquaries, Dandy Dinmonts, and the rest, merely bundles of
humours, and innocent childish humours at that, who serve to
beguile our dull hours and charm our sick ones, and are packed off
to the nursery when the working day returns and our normal
faculties crave something tough to set their teeth into? Compare
the Waverley Novels with the novels of Tolstoy, of Stendhal, of
Proust! These comparisons of course lead to questions that lie at
the root of fiction, but without discussing them, they reveal
unmistakably what Scott is not. He is not among the great observers
of the intricacies of the heart. He is not going to break seals or
loose fountains. But he has the power of the artist who can create
a scene and leave us to analyse it for ourselves. When we read the
scene in the cottage where Steenie Mucklebackit lies dead, the
different emotions&mdash;the father's grief, the mother's
irritability, the minister's consolations&mdash;all rise
spontaneously, as if Scott had merely to record, and we have merely
to observe. What we lose in intricacy we gain perhaps in
spontaneity and the stimulus given to our own creative powers. It
is true that Scott creates carelessly, as if the parts came
together without his willing it; it is true also that his scene
breaks into ruin without his caring.</p>

<p>For who taps at the door and destroys that memorable scene? The
cadaverous Earl of Glenallan; the unhappy nobleman who had married
his sister in the belief that she was his cousin; and had stalked
the world in sables ever after. Falsity breaks in; the peerage
breaks in; all the trappings of the undertaker and heralds' office
press upon us their unwholesome claims. The emotions then in which
Scott excels are not those of human beings pitted against other
human beings, but of man pitted against Nature, of man in relation
to fate. His romance is the romance of hunted men hiding in woods
at night; of brigs standing out to sea; of waves breaking in the
moonlight; of solitary sands and distant horsemen; of violence and
suspense. And he is perhaps the last novelist to practise the
great, the Shakespearean art, of making people reveal themselves in
speech.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>LOCKHART'S CRITICISM</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1931</i></b>
</p>

<p>Lockhart was not an ambitious man, and, for all his powers, he
was, save in one instance, rather careless in the use he made of
them. As a young man he was content with the irresponsibilities of
anonymous reviewing; and as an older man the same ephemeral
occupation suited him well enough, though he pursued it more
sedately, less anonymously and from the respectable comfort of an
editor's chair. But he held no very exalted view of his mission.
The business of reviewers, he said, was "to think not of
themselves, but of their author...This excludes all chance of
formal, original, or would-be original disquisition on the part of
the journalist." Hence, though Lockhart must have filled volume
upon volume with his reviews, very little of Lockhart is to be
found embedded in them. When his editor comes&mdash;armed with an
admirable introduction&mdash;to pick out from the lumber of old
<i>Blackwoods</i> and <i>Quarterlies</i> the true Lockhart himself,
she finds, for all her enthusiasm, that one slim volume holds all
that can now be saved.*</p>

<p>[* <i>Lockhart's Literary Criticism.</i> With an Introduction
and Bibliography. By M. Clive Hildyard.]</p>

<p>Yet the work was well worth doing, both because Lockhart had a
bold, vivacious mind which leaked into his reviews in spite of his
theories, and then again, though Miss Hildyard rates him too highly
as a critic, he is a fine sample of a reviewer and serves to show
the nature and function of those curious creatures whose lives, if
they are as gay and giddy as a gnat's, are also as short. Here is
one of them who has got himself, rather against his will, pinned
down in a book; and it is highly amusing to look at him for a
moment transfixed. His most necessary quality, it would seem, must
be that which in other walks of life would be called, respectfully
enough, courage. A new and unknown writer is a very dangerous
person. Most of them die at a pinch without a gasp, but some
survive and sting, and their sting can be fatal. When Lockhart, we
have to remember, saw ranged on his table the usual new books,
their names conveyed nothing to him. Keats, Hook, Godwin, Shelley,
Bront&euml;, Tennyson&mdash;who were they? They might be
somebodies, but they might, more probably, be nobodies. It was for
him to make the trial and decide the question. Advancing alone with
nothing but his own judgment to support him, the reviewer had need
of all his courage, his acuteness, his education. He had to switch
as adroitly as he could from one subject to another. Mr. Shelley
and Mr. Keats, for example, were both poets, and wrote about Greek
myths. Godwin and Bront&euml;&mdash;Bront&euml; might possibly be a
woman&mdash;were both novelists; Jeffrey was a critic; Macaulay an
historian; Beckford and Borrow were travellers; Coleridge was a
poet again, but at the same time a very different poet from Crabbe;
somebody had written a book about heraldry, a Staff surgeon had
published his memoirs, General Nott had written about Afghanistan,
and there was also a valuable work about a new method of treating
dry rot. All had to be read, sorted, placed, marked good or bad,
and commended with a label tied round their necks to the attention
or neglect of the public. The public who paid to be told what to
read would be justly annoyed if they were told to read the wrong
things.</p>

<p>Lockhart was well qualified for the business. He was a highly
educated man. He had taken a first at Oxford, he had a considerable
knowledge of Spanish literature, and he was more widely read than
most young men of his age. All this was in his favour, but there
were drawbacks. The Lockharts were an old Scottish family; and when
you add an Oxford education to a young man of an old Scottish
family you are making it very difficult for him to be just to
apothecaries, for example, who think they can write poetry, or to
Cockneys who have the temerity to talk about the Greeks. Moreover,
Lockhart was one of those quick-witted indolent people who, as Sir
Walter complained, feel the attractions of "the gown and slipper
garb of life, and live with funny, easy companions" gossiping and
telling stories instead of attending to the serious business of
life and making a name for themselves. The doors and windows of his
study let in rumours, prejudices, odds and ends of unsubstantiated
gossip. With it all, however, he had the makings of a prince of
reviewers; and those who have a kindly feeling for the race might
well feel forebodings when he and his cronies picked up for review
one day in 1820 a new book of poems by John Keats. Keats, Lockhart
knew, was a friend of Leigh Hunt, and therefore presumably a
Liberal, a Cockney. He knew vaguely that his father had kept livery
stables. It was impossible, then, that he should be a gentleman and
a scholar. All Lockhart's prejudices were roused and he rushed to
his doom&mdash;the worst that can befall a reviewer. He committed
himself violently, he betrayed himself completely. He tried to
snuff out between finger and thumb one of the immortal lights of
English literature. For that failure he has been gibbeted ever
since. No one who sees him swinging in the wind can help a shudder
and a sigh lest the same fate may one of these days be his. After
all, new books of poems still appear.</p>

<p>And it is plain, as we turn over the pages of Lockhart's
resurrected reviews, that to write about a new book the moment it
comes out is a very different matter from writing about it fifty
years afterwards. A new book is attached to life by a thousand
minute filaments. Life goes on and the filaments break and
disappear. But at the moment they ring and resound and set up all
kinds of irrelevant responses. Keats was an apothecary and lived in
Hampstead, and consorted with Leigh Hunt and the Cockneys: Shelley
was an atheist and had irregular views upon marriage; the author of
<i>Jane Eyre</i> might be a woman, and, if so, was a very coarse
one. It is easy to say that these were ephemeral accidents and that
Lockhart should have brushed them aside; but they rang loud in his
ears, and he could no more have disregarded them and the prejudices
of his readers than he could have flung aside his blue
dressing-gown and marched down Albemarle Street in a tweed cap and
plus fours.</p>

<p>But even so, Lockhart was not so far out as might be expected;
in other words, he was very often of the same opinion as we are. He
saw the importance of Wordsworth and Coleridge; he welcomed Borrow
and Beckford; he placed <i>Jane Eyre,</i> in spite of its
coarseness, very high. It is true that he predicted a long life for
<i>Zohrab the Hostage,</i> who has had a short one. Probably
because he was a novelist himself his criticism of fiction was
erratic, and his enthusiasm for the novels of Godwin and Hook seems
to show that they excited his own creative power and thus deflected
his critical judgment. Tennyson he bullied with unchastened
insolence, but, as Tennyson proved by accepting some of his
criticism, not without acuteness. In short, the case of Lockhart
would seem to show that a good reviewer of contemporary work will
get the proportions roughly right, but the detail wrong. He will
single out from a number of unknown writers those who are going to
prove men of substance, but he cannot be certain what qualities are
theirs in particular, or how the importance of one compares with
the importance of another.</p>

<p>One may regret, since this is so, that Lockhart fixed his mind
so much upon contemporaries and did not give himself the benefit of
a wider perspective. He might have written with far greater safety
and perhaps with far greater authority upon the dead. But he was a
diffident man and a fastidious; and he knew that criticism, to be
worth anything, requires more effort and more austerity than he was
able to command All the brilliance of Jeffrey, as he perceived, was
not enough "to induce a man of research in the next century to turn
over the volumes of his review". And Gifford, with his "ill natured
abuse and cold rancorous raillery...is exquisitely formed for the
purposes of political objurgation, but not at all for those of
gentle and universal criticism". A reviewer can skim the surface,
but there are "matters of such moment, that it is absolutely
impossible to be a great critic while the mind remains unsettled in
regard to them". Because he was aware of this, Lockhart was a good
reviewer, and content to remain one. But he was too sceptical too
diffident, too handsome and well bred perhaps; he lived too much
under the shadow of Sir Walter Scott, he had too many worries and
sorrows and dined out too often to push on into those calm and
austere regions where the mind settles down to think things out and
has its dwelling in a mood of gentle and universal contemplation.
So he was content to go on knocking off articles, and cutting out
quotations and leaving them to moulder where they lay. But if his
reviews show by their power, their insolence, their very lack of
ambition, that he had it in him to do better, they also remind us
that there is a virtue in familiarity. We lose something when we
have ceased to be able to talk naturally of Johnny Keats, to regret
the "early death of this unfortunate and misguided gentleman" Mr.
Shelley. A little of the irreverence with which Lockhart treated
the living would do no harm to our more sober estimates of the
dead.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a><i>DAVID COPPERFIELD</i>
</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1925</i></b>
</p>

<p>Like the ripening of strawberries, the swelling of apples, and
all other natural processes, new editions of Dickens&mdash;cheap,
pleasant-looking, well printed&mdash;are born into the world and
call for no more notice than the season's plums and strawberries,
save when by some chance the emergence of one of these masterpieces
in its fresh green binding suggests an odd and overwhelming
enterprise&mdash;that one should read <i>David Copperfield</i> for
the second time. There is perhaps no person living who can remember
reading <i>David Copperfield</i> for the first time. Like
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and <i>Grimm's Fairy Tales</i> and the
Waverley Novels, <i>Pickwick</i> and <i>David Copperfield</i> are
not books, but stories communicated by word of mouth in those
tender years when fact and fiction merge, and thus belong to the
memories and myths of life, and not to its aesthetic experience.
When we lift it from this hazy atmosphere, when we consider it as a
book, bound and printed and ordered by the rules of art, what
impression does <i>David Copperfield</i> make upon us? As Peggotty
and Barkis, the rooks and the workbox with the picture of St.
Paul's, Traddles who drew skeletons, the donkeys who would cross
the green, Mr. Dick and the Memorial, Betsey Trotwood and Jip and
Dora and Agnes and the Heeps and the Micawbers once more come to
life with all their appurtenances and peculiarities, are they still
possessed of the old 'fascination or have they in the interval been
attacked by that parching wind which blows about books and, without
our reading them, remodels them and changes their features while we
sleep? The rumour about Dickens is to the effect that his sentiment
is disgusting and his style commonplace; that in reading him every
refinement must be hidden and every sensibility kept under glass;
but that with these precautions and reservations he is of course
Shakespearean; like Scott, a born creator; like Balzac, prodigious
in his fecundity; but, rumour adds, it is strange that while one
reads Shakespeare and one reads Scott, the precise moment for
reading Dickens seldom comes our way.</p>

<p>This last charge may be resolved into this&mdash;that he lacks
charm and idiosyncrasy, is everybody's writer and no one's in
particular, is an institution, a monument, a public thoroughfare
trodden dusty by a million feet. It is based largely upon the fact
that of all great writers Dickens is both the least personally
charming and the least personally present in his books. No one has
ever loved Dickens as he loves Shakespeare and Scott. Both in his
life and in his work the impression that he makes is the same. He
has to perfection the virtues conventionally ascribed to the male;
he is self-assertive, self-reliant, self-assured; energetic in the
extreme. His message, when he parts the veil of the story and steps
forward in person, is plain and forcible; he preaches the value of
"plain hardworking qualities", of punctuality, order, diligence, of
doing what lies before one with all one's might. Agitated as he was
by the most violent passions, ablaze with indignation, teeming with
queer characters, unable to keep the dreams out of his head at
night, nobody appears, as we read him, more free from the foibles
and eccentricities and charms of genius. He comes before us, as one
of his biographers described him, "like a prosperous sea captain",
stalwart, weather-beaten, self-reliant, with a great contempt for
the finicky, the inefficient, or the effeminate. His sympathies
indeed have strict limitations. Speaking roughly, they fail him
whenever a man or woman has more than two thousand a year, has been
to the university, or can count his ancestors back to the third
generation. They fail him when he has to treat of the mature
emotions&mdash;the seduction of Emily, for example, or the death of
Dora; whenever it is no longer possible to keep moving and
creating, but it is necessary to stand still and search into things
and penetrate to the depths of what is there. Then, indeed, he
fails grotesquely, and the pages in which he describes what in our
convention are the peaks and pinnacles of human life, the
explanation of Mrs. Strong, the despair of Mrs. Steerforth, or the
anguish of Ham, are of an indescribable unreality&mdash;of that
uncomfortable complexion which, if we heard Dickens talking so in
real life, would either make us blush to the roots of our hair or
dash out of the room to conceal our laughter. "...Tell him then,"
says Emily, "that when I hear the wind blowing at night I feel as
if it was passing angrily from seeing him and uncle, and was going
up to God against me." Miss Dartle raves&mdash;about carrion and
pollution and earthworms, and worthless spangles and broken toys,
and how she will have Emily "proclaimed on the common stair". The
failure is akin to that other failure to think deeply, to describe
beautifully. Of the men who go to make up the perfect novelist and
should live in amity under his hat, two&mdash;the poet and the
philosopher&mdash;failed to come when Dickens called them.</p>

<p>But the greater the creator the more derelict the regions where
his powers fail him; all about their fertile lands are deserts
where not a blade of grass grows, swamps where the foot sinks deep
in mud. Nevertheless, while we are under their spell these great
geniuses make us see the world any shape they choose. We remodel
our psychological geography when we read Dickens; we forget that we
have ever felt the delights of solitude or observed with wonder the
intricate emotions of our friends, or luxuriated in the beauty of
nature. What we remember is the ardour, the excitement, the humour,
the oddity of people's characters; the smell and savour and soot of
London; the incredible coincidences which hook the most remote
lives together; the city, the law courts; this man's nose, that
man's limp; some scene under an archway or on the high road; and
above all some gigantic and dominating figure, so stuffed and
swollen with life that he does not exist singly and solitarily, but
seems to need for his own realisation a host of others, to call
into existence the severed parts that complete him, so that
wherever he goes he is the centre of conviviality and merriment and
punch-making; the room is full, the lights are bright; there are
Mrs. Micawber, the twins, Traddles, Betsey Trotwood&mdash;all in
full swing.</p>

<p>This is the power which cannot fade or fail in its
effect&mdash;the power not to analyse or to interpret, but to
produce, apparently without thought or effort or calculation of the
effect upon the story, characters who exist not in detail, not
accurately or exactly, but abundantly in a cluster of wild and yet
extraordinarily revealing remarks, bubble climbing on the top of
bubble as the breath of the creator fills them. And the fecundity
and apparent irreflectiveness have a strange effect. They make
creators of us, and not merely readers and spectators. As we listen
to Micawber pouring himself forth and venturing perpetually some
new flight of astonishing imagination, we see, unknown to Mr.
Micawber, into the depths of his soul. We say, as Dickens himself
says while Micawber holds forth: "How wonderfully like Mr. Micawber
that is!" Why trouble, then, if the scenes where emotion and
psychology are to be expected fail us completely? Subtlety and
complexity are all there if we know where to look for them, if we
can get over the surprise of finding them&mdash;as it seems to us,
who have another convention in these matters&mdash;in the wrong
places. As a creator of character his peculiarity is that he
creates wherever his eyes rest&mdash;he has the visualising power
in the extreme. His people are branded upon our eyeballs before we
hear them speak, by what he sees them doing, and it seems as if it
were the sight that sets his thought in action. He saw Uriah Heep
"breathing into the pony's nostrils and immediately covering them
with his hand"; he saw David Copperfield looking in the glass to
see how red his eyes were after his mother's death; he saw oddities
and blemishes, gestures and incidents, scars, eyebrows, everything
that was in the room, in a second. His eye brings in almost too
rich a harvest for him to deal with, and gives him an aloofness and
a hardness which freeze his sentimentalism and make it seem a
concession to the public, a veil thrown over the penetrating glance
which left to itself pierced to the bone. With such a power at his
command Dickens made his books blaze up, not by tightening the plot
or sharpening the wit, but by throwing another handful of people
upon the fire. The interest flags and he creates Miss Mowcher,
completely alive, equipped in every detail as if she were to play a
great part in the story, whereas once the dull stretch of road is
passed by her help, she disappears; she is needed no longer. Hence
a Dickens novel is apt to become a bunch of separate characters
loosely held together, often by the most arbitrary conventions, who
tend to fly asunder and split our attention into so many different
parts that we drop the book in despair. But that danger is
surmounted in <i>David Copperfield.</i> There, though characters
swarm and life flows into every creek and cranny, some common
feeling&mdash;youth, gaiety, hope&mdash;envelops the tumult, brings
the scattered parts together, and invests the most perfect of all
the Dickens novels with an atmosphere of beauty.*</p>

<blockquote>[* The following letter by Virginia Woolf appears in
<i>The Nation</i> of September 12, 1925.<br>
<br>
<br>
SIR,<br>
<br>
Fear of a sudden death very naturally distracted Kappa's mind from
my article on <i>David Copperfield</i> or he would, I think, have
taken my meaning. That nobody can remember reading <i>David
Copperfield</i> for the first time is a proof not, as he infers,
that the reading makes so little impression that it slips off the
mind unremembered, but that <i>David Copperfield</i> takes such
rank among our classics and is a book of such astonishing vividness
that parents will read it aloud to their children before they can
quite distinguish fact from fiction, and they will never in later
life be able to recall the first time they read it. <i>Grimm's
Fairy Tales</i> and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> are for many people in
the same case.<br>
<br>
Questions of affection are of course always disputable. I can only
reiterate that while I would cheerfully become Shakespeare's cat,
Scott's pig, or Keats's canary, if by so doing I could share the
society of these great men, I would not cross the road (reasons of
curiosity apart) to dine with Wordsworth, Byron, or Dickens. Yet I
venerate their genius; and my tears would certainly help to swell
the "unparalleled flow of popular grief" at their deaths. It only
means that writers have characters apart from their books, which
are sympathetic to some, antipathetic to others. And I maintain
that if it could be put to the vote, Which do you prefer as man,
Shakespeare, Scott, or Dickens? Shakespeare would be first, Scott
second, and Dickens nowhere at all.<br>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>LEWIS CARROLL</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in January 1939</i></b>
</p>

<p>The complete works of Lewis Carroll have been issued by the
Nonesuch Press in a stout volume of 1293 pages. So there is no
excuse&mdash;Lewis Carroll ought once and for all to be complete.
We ought to be able to grasp him whole and entire. But we
fail&mdash;once more we fail. We think we have caught Lewis
Carroll; we look again and see an Oxford clergyman. We think we
have caught the Rev. C. L. Dodgson&mdash;we look again and see a
fairy elf. The book breaks in two in our hands. In order to cement
it, we turn to the Life.</p>

<p>But the Rev. C. L. Dodgson had no life. He passed through the
world so lightly that he left no print. He melted so passively into
Oxford that he is invisible. He accepted every convention; he was
prudish, pernickety, pious, and jocose. If Oxford dons in the
nineteenth century had an essence he was that essence. He was so
good that his sisters worshipped him; so pure that his nephew has
nothing to say about him. It is just possible, he hints, that "a
shadow of disappointment lay over Lewis Carroll's life". Mr.
Dodgson at once denies the shadow. "My life", he says, "is free
from all trial and trouble." But this untinted jelly contained
within it a perfectly hard crystal. It contained childhood. And
this is very strange, for childhood normally fades slowly. Wisps of
childhood persist when the boy or girl is a grown man or woman.
Childhood returns sometimes by day, more often by night. But it was
not so with Lewis Carroll. For some reason, we know not what, his
childhood was sharply severed. It lodged in him whole and entire.
He could not disperse it. And therefore as he grew older this
impediment in the centre of his being, this hard block of pure
childhood, starved the mature man of nourishment. He slipped
through the grown-up world like a shadow, solidifying only on the
beach at Eastbourne, with little girls whose frocks he pinned up
with safety pins. But since childhood remained in him entire, he
could do what no one else has ever been able to do&mdash;he could
return to that world; he could re-create it, so that we too become
children again.</p>

<p>In order to make us into children, he first makes us asleep.
"Down, down, down, would the fall <i>never</i> come to an end?"
Down, down, down we fall into that terrifying, wildly inconsequent,
yet perfectly logical world where time races, then stands still;
where space stretches, then contracts. It is the world of sleep; it
is also the world of dreams. Without any conscious effort dreams
come; the white rabbit, the walrus, and the carpenter, one after
another, turning and changing one into the other, they come
skipping and leaping across the mind. It is for this reason that
the two Alices are not books for children; they are the only books
in which we become children. President Wilson, Queen Victoria,
<i>The Times</i> leader writer, the late Lord Salisbury&mdash;it
does not matter how old, how important, or how insignificant you
are, you become a child again. To become a child is to be very
literal; to find everything so strange that nothing is surprising;
to be heartless, to be ruthless, yet to be so passionate that a
snub or a shadow drapes the world in gloom. It is to be Alice in
Wonderland.</p>

<p>It is also to be Alice Through the Looking Glass. It is to see
the world upside down. Many great satirists and moralists have
shown us the world upside down, and have made us see it, as
grown-up people see it, savagely. Only Lewis Carroll has shown us
the world upside down as a child sees it, and has made us laugh as
children laugh, irresponsibly. Down the groves of pure nonsense we
whirl laughing, laughing&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><i>They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with
care;<br>
They pursued it with forks and hope...</i>
</blockquote>

<p>And then we wake. None of the transitions in Alice in Wonderland
is quite so queer. For we wake to find&mdash;is it the Rev. C. L.
Dodgson? Is it Lewis Carroll? Or is it both combined? This
conglomerate object intends to produce an extra-Bowdlerised edition
of Shakespeare for the use of British maidens; implores them to
think of death when they go to the play; and always, always to
realise that "the true object of life is the development of
<i>character..."</i> Is there, then, even in 1293 pages, any such
thing as "completeness"?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>EDMUND GOSSE</h2>

<p>When famous writers die it is remarkable how frequently they are
credited with one particular virtue&mdash;the virtue of kindness to
the young and obscure. Every newspaper has lately contained that
eulogy upon Arnold Bennett. And here is the same tribute paid to
another writer who differed in every possible way from Arnold
Bennett&mdash;Sir Edmund Gosse. He too, it is said, was generous to
the young and obscure. Of Bennett it was certainly, although on
some occasions rather obliquely, true. He might, that is to say,
have formed a very low opinion of a book; he might have expressed
that opinion as his habit was, bluntly and emphatically in print;
and yet if he met the writer his sincerity, his concern, his
assumption that both cared equally for the craft of letters made it
perfectly easy for that unfortunate person to say, "It is all true,
and more than true, Mr. Bennett; but if you hate my books, I can't
tell you how completely I loathe yours"&mdash;after which a frank
discussion of fiction and its nature was possible; and a very
obscure novelist was left with the feeling that a very famous one
was indeed the kindest of men.</p>

<p>But what would have happened if, taking advantage of Sir
Edmund's generosity, and assuming a common respect for letters, one
had said, "But you can't hate my books, Sir Edmund, more than I
hate yours"? Instant annihilation would have been the only and the
happiest solution of the situation. But nobody who had ever seen
Sir Edmund in the flesh would have risked such folly. Bristling and
brilliant, formal but uneasy, he radiated even from a distance all
the susceptibilities that make young writers draw in their horns.
Generous was not the adjective that sprang to the lips at the sight
of him, nor is it one that frequently occurs on reading the life of
him by Mr. Charteris. He could be as touchy as a housemaid and as
suspicious as a governess. He could smell out an offence where none
was meant, and hoard a grievance for years. He could quarrel
permanently because a lamp wick was snuffed out too vigorously at a
table under his nose. Hostile reviews threw him into paroxysms of
rage and despair. His letters are full of phrases like "Mr. Clement
Shorter, in terms of unexampled insolence, speaks of me as 'the
so-called critic'...If that insolent notice in <i>The Times</i> is
true...it is better I should know it...I feel I shall never have
the heart to write another sentence." It seems possible that one
severe review by Churton Collins gave him more pain than he
suffered from any private or public sorrow in the course of
seventy-nine years. All this must have made him the most prickly of
companions, and the young must have been possessed of greater tact
than the young usually possess to reach the kindness that no doubt
lay hid behind the thorns. For the great merit of the present
biography is that it does not attempt to conceal the fact that Sir
Edmund was a complex character composed of many different strains.
Plain virtue was not a sure passport to his affection. He could
disregard genius and ignore merit if they trod too clumsily upon
his toes. On the other hand the House of Lords possessed a distinct
glamour for him; the rigours of high society delighted him; and to
see the words "Marlborough Club" at the head of his notepaper did,
it seems, shed a certain lustre upon the page.</p>

<p>But these foibles, amusing and annoying as they are, become at
once more interesting and less irritating when we learn that there
lay behind them a very good cause&mdash;his education, his
childhood. "Far more than might be supposed of his conduct in
life", writes Mr. Charteris, "was due to unconscious protest
against the things which darkened his childhood." Readers of
<i>Father and Son</i> know well what those things were&mdash;the
narrowness, the ugliness of his upbringing; the almost insane
religious mania of his father; the absence from his home of
culture, beauty, urbanity, graciousness&mdash;in fact, of all those
elements in life to which Edmund Gosse turned as instinctively and
needed as profoundly as a flower the sun. What could be more
natural than that the flower, once transplanted, should turn,
almost violently, the other way, should climb too high, should
twine too lavishly, should&mdash;to drop these
metaphors&mdash;order clothes in Savile Row and emerge from behind
the form of Dr. Fog uttering what appear at this distance of time
rather excessive praises of the now little known Danish poet,
Paludin M&uuml;ller?&mdash;a surly poet who objected to visitors.
But young Edmund Gosse triumphed. "Slowly, the poet murmured, 'You
flatter me too much, but thank you.' The most stubborn of all the
citadels had capitulated."</p>

<p>Few people can have been pitchforked, as Mr. Charteris calls it,
into the world by a more violent propulsion than that which Gosse
was given by the bleakness of his upbringing. It was no wonder that
he overshot the mark, never quite got his equilibrium at parties
which he loved, required to know the maiden names of married
guests, and observed formalities punctiliously which are taken as a
matter of course by those who have never lived in dread of the
instant coming of the Lord, and have ordered their clothes for
generations in Savile Row. But the impulse itself was generous, and
the tokens of kindling and expansion more admirable than
ridiculous. The "sensual sufficiency in life" delighted one who had
been starved of it. Happiness formed the staple of what he would
certainly not have called his creed. "To feel so saturated with the
love of things", to enjoy life and "suck it as a wasp drains a
peach", to "roll the moments on one's tongue and keep the flavour
of them"; above all, to cherish friendship and exalt the ideals of
friendship&mdash;such were the enjoyments that his nature, long
repressed, stretched out to, generously, naturally, spontaneously.
And yet...</p>

<p>Those who are acquainted with Sir Edmund's lively portraits know
what demure but devastating qualifications he was able to insinuate
after those two small words. "He possessed the truth and answered
to the heavenly calling," he wrote of Andrew Lang, "and yet..."
Such expansion was natural, was right, was creditable, and yet, we
echo, how much better Gosse would have been as a writer, how much
more important he would have been as a man if only he had given
freer rein to his impulses, if only his pagan and sensual joy had
not been dashed by perpetual caution! The peculiarity which Mr.
Charteris notes in his walk&mdash;"curiously suggestive at once of
eagerness and caution"&mdash;runs through his life and limits his
intelligence. He hints, he qualifies, he insinuates, he suggests,
but he never speaks out, for all the world as if some austere
Plymouth Brother were lying in wait to make him do penance for his
audacity. Yet it seems possible, given the nature of his gifts,
that if only he had possessed greater boldness, if only he had
pushed his curiosity further, had incurred wrath instead of
irritation, and complete confusion instead of some petty social
tribulation, he might have rivalled the great Boswell himself. When
we read how young Edmund Gosse insinuated himself under cover of
Dr. Fog into the presence of an irascible poet and won the day by
the adroitness of his flattery, we are reminded of the methods of
Boswell in pursuit of Paoli or Voltaire or Johnson. Both men were
irresistibly attracted by genius. Both had "a medium-like" power of
drawing other people's confidences into the open. Both were
astonishingly adept at reporting the talk and describing the
appearance of their friends. But where Boswell is drawn headlong by
the momentum of his hero and his own veneration beyond discretion,
beyond vanity, beyond his fear of what people will say, down into
the depths, Gosse is kept by his respect for decorum, by his
decency and his timidity dipping and ducking, fingering and
faltering upon the surface. Thus where Boswell left us that
profound and moving masterpiece, the <i>Life of Johnson,</i> Gosse
left us <i>Father and Son,</i> a classic doubtless, as Mr.
Charteris claims, certainly a most original and entertaining book,
but how little and light, how dapper and superficial Gosse's
portraits appear if we compare them with the portraits left by
Boswell himself! Fear seems always to dog his footsteps. He dips
his fingers with astonishing agility and speed into character, but
if he finds something hot or gets hold of something large, he drops
it and withdraws with the agility of a scalded cat. Thus we never
know his sitters intimately; we never plunge into the depths of
their minds or into the more profound regions of their hearts. But
we know all that can be known by someone who is always a little
afraid of being found out.</p>

<p>But if Gosse's masterpiece and his portraits suffer from his
innate regard for caution, much of the fault must be laid upon his
age. Even the most superficial student of letters must be aware
that in the nineteenth century literature had become, for one
reason or another, a profession rather than a vocation, a married
woman rather than a lady of easy virtue. It had its organisation,
its functions, its emoluments, and a host of people, not primarily
writers, were attached to its service. Among them Gosse, of course,
was one of the most eminent. "...No public dinner where literature
was involved", writes Mr. Charteris, "was complete without Gosse to
propose or to return thanks for the cause." He welcomed strangers,
addressed bodies, celebrated centenaries, presented prizes, and
represented letters on all occasions and with the highest delight
in the function. Then, again, some intellectual curiosity had risen
in the nineties and ardent if uninstructed ladies wished to be
enlightened. Here again Gosse was invaluable. By an odd irony,
while Churton Collins, his deadly foe, was lecturing in St. James's
Square, Gosse was serving up Matthew Arnold to "some of the
smartest women in London" in Bruton Street. After this, says Mr.
Charteris, he became "a much more frequent guest in Mayfair" and
his appetite for social life was whetted. Nothing would be more
foolish than to sneer at a natural love of ceremony or a natural
respect for the aristocracy, and yet it seems possible that this
concern with the ritual of literature, this scrupulous observance
of the rites of society encouraged Edmund Gosse in his growing
decorum. Friendship had been his ideal; nobody can question the
warmth of his youthful affection for Hamo Thornycroft; and yet when
one of his friends, Robert Ross, was involved in a famous scandal
he could write "I miss your charming company in which I have always
delighted...I would say to you&mdash;&mdash;be calm, be reasonable,
turn for consolation to the infinite resources of
literature...Write to me when you feel inclined, and however busy I
am I will write in reply, and in a more happy season you must come
back and be truly welcomed in this house." Is that the voice of
friendship, disinterested, fearless, sincere, or the voice of an
uneasy man of letters, who is terribly afraid that dear Lady C.
will not ask him to dine, or that divine being the Countess of D.
will not invite him for the week-end if they suspect him of
harbouring Robert Ross, the friend of Oscar Wilde? And later his
decorum seems to have drawn a film over his wonted perspicacity as
a critic. M. Gide, for example, thought it well to mention certain
facts openly in the third volume of his memoirs. "Was it wise? Was
it necessary? Is it useful?" Sir Edmund cried, in "painful
perplexity". And he was terribly shocked by an incident in E. M.
Forster's <i>Howards End.</i> "I should like to know", he wrote to
Mr. Marsh, "what you think of the new craze for introducing into
fiction the high-born maiden who has had a baby?...I do not know
how an Englishman can calmly write of such a disgusting thing, with
such <i>sang-froid</i>...I cannot help hoping that you may be
induced to say something that will redeem him." But when Sir Edmund
goes on to say that no high-bred maiden has ever had a baby
illegitimately in a French novel one can only suppose that he was
thinking, not unnaturally, of the House of Lords.</p>

<p>But if Gosse was no Boswell and still less a St. Francis, he was
able to fill a place and create a legend, and perhaps we have no
right to demand more. To be oneself is, after all, an achievement
of some rarity, and Gosse, as everybody must agree, achieved it,
both in literature and in life. As a writer he expressed himself in
book after book of history, of biography, of criticism. For over
fifty years he was busily concerned, as he put it, with "the
literary character and the literary craft". There is scarcely a
figure of any distinction, or a book of any importance in modern
letters, upon which we cannot have Gosse's opinion if we wish for
it. For instance, one may have a curiosity about Disraeli's novels
and hesitate which to begin upon. Let us consult Gosse. Gosse
advises on the whole that we shall try <i>Coningsby.</i> He gives
his reasons. He rouses us with a suggestive remark. He defines
Disraeli's quality by comparing him with Bulwer, with Mrs. Gore and
Plumer Read. He tells an anecdote about Disraeli that was told him
by his friend the Duke of Rutland. He breaks off a phrase here and
there for our amusement or admiration. All this he does with
perfect suavity and precision, so that by the time he has done
Disraeli is left glowing and mantling like an old picture lit up by
a dozen bright candles. To illumine, to make visible and desirable,
was his aim as a critic. Literature to him was an incomparable
mistress and it was his delight "to dress her charms and make her
more beloved". Lovers of course sometimes go further and a child is
the result. Critics too sometimes love literature creatively and
the fruit of their devotion has a toughness and a fibre that the
smooth strains of Sir Edmund's platonic devotion are entirely
without. Like all critics who persist in judging without creating
he forgets the risk and agony of child-birth. His criticism becomes
more and more a criticism of the finished article, and not of the
article in the making. The smoothness, the craftsmanship of the
work rouse his appreciation and he directs our attention only to
its more superficial aspects. In other words, he is a critic for
those who read rather than for those who write. But then no creator
possesses Gosse's impartiality, or his width of reading, or his
lightness and freedom of mind, so that if we want to hold a candle
to some dark face in the long portrait gallery of literature there
is no better illuminant than Edmund Gosse.</p>

<p>As for his own face, his own idiosyncrasy, only those who saw
him at home among his books, or heard him, mimicking, remembering,
in one of those club corners that he made, so characteristically,
his own, can bring the odds and ends of this excitable but timid,
this enthusiastic but worldly, this kindly but spiteful man into
one complete synthesis. It was only in talk that he completely
expressed himself. "I was not born for solitude", he wrote. Neither
was he born for old age and meditation. "You speak of 'the peace
which the years bring', but they bring no peace for me", he wrote.
Thought and the ardours and agonies of life were not for him. "I
have no idea", he said, "how the spiritual world would look to me,
for I have never glanced at it since I was a child and gorged with
it." It is a cruel fate that makes those who only come into being
when they talk fall silent. It is a harsh necessity that brings
these warm and mobile characters into the narrow confines of the
grave. Sir Edmund was not in the least anxious to depart and leave
a world which, with the solitary exception of Churton Collins, had
showered upon him so many delightful gifts for seventy-nine
years.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>NOTES ON D. H. LAWRENCE</h2>

<p>The partiality, the inevitable imperfection of contemporary
criticism can best be guarded against, perhaps, by making in the
first place a full confession of one's disabilities, so far as it
is possible to distinguish them. Thus by way of preface to the
following remarks upon D. H. Lawrence, the present writer has to
state that until April 1931 he was known to her almost solely by
reputation and scarcely at all by experience. His reputation, which
was that of a prophet, the exponent of some mystical theory of sex,
the devotee of cryptic terms, the inventor of a new terminology
which made free use of such words as solar plexus and the like, was
not attractive; to follow submissively in his tracks seemed an
unthinkable aberration; and as chance would have it, the few pieces
of his writing that issued from behind this dark cloud of
reputation seemed unable to rouse any sharp curiosity or to dispel
the lurid phantom. There was, to begin with, <i>Trespassers,</i> a
hot, scented, overwrought piece of work, as it seemed; then <i>A
Prussian Officer,</i> of which no clear impression remained except
of starting muscles and forced obscenity; then <i>The Lost
Girl,</i> a compact and seamanlike piece of work, stuffed with
careful observation rather in the Bennett manner; then one or two
sketches of Italian travel of great beauty, but fragmentary and
broken off; and then two little books of poems, <i>Nettles</i> and
<i>Pansies,</i> which read like the sayings that small boys
scribble upon stiles to make housemaids jump and titter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the chants of the worshippers at the shrine of
Lawrence became more rapt; their incense thicker and their
gyrations more mazy and more mystic. His death last year gave them
still greater liberty and still greater impetus; his death, too,
irritated the respectable; and it was the irritation roused by the
devout and the shocked, and the ceremonies of the devout and the
scandal of the shocked, that drove one at last to read <i>Sons and
Lovers</i> in order to see whether, as so often happens, the master
is not altogether different from the travesty presented by his
disciples.</p>

<p>This then was the angle of approach, and it will be seen that it
is an angle that shuts off many views and distorts others. But read
from this angle, <i>Sons and Lovers</i> emerged with astonishing
vividness, like an island from off which the mist has suddenly
lifted. Here it lay, clean cut, decisive, masterly, hard as rock,
shaped, proportioned by a man who, whatever else he might
be&mdash;prophet or villain, was undoubtedly the son of a miner who
had been born and bred in Nottingham. But this hardness, this
clarity, this admirable economy and sharpness of the stroke are not
rare qualities in an age of highly efficient novelists. The
lucidity, the ease, the power of the writer to indicate with one
stroke and then to refrain indicated a mind of great power and
penetration. But these impressions, after they had built up the
lives of the Morels, their kitchens, food, sinks, manner of speech,
were succeeded by another far rarer, and of far greater interest.
For after we have exclaimed that this coloured and stereoscopic
representation of life is so like that surely it must be
alive&mdash;like the bird that pecked the cherry in the
picture&mdash;one feels, from some indescribable brilliance,
sombreness, significance, that the room is put into order. Some
hand has been at work before we entered. Casual and natural as the
arrangement seems, as if we had opened the door and come in by
chance, some hand, some eye of astonishing penetration and force,
has swiftly arranged the whole scene, so that we feel that it is
more exciting, more moving, in some ways fuller of life than one
had thought real life could be, as if a painter had brought out the
leaf or the tulip or the jar by pulling a green curtain behind it.
But what is the green curtain that Lawrence has pulled so as to
accentuate the colours? One never catches Lawrence&mdash;this is
one of his most remarkable qualities&mdash;"arranging". Words,
scenes flow as fast and direct as if he merely traced them with a
free rapid hand on sheet after sheet. Not a sentence seems thought
about twice: not a word added for its effect on the architecture of
the phrase. There is no arrangement that makes us say: "Look at
this. This scene, this dialogue has the meaning of the book hidden
in it." One of the curious qualities of <i>Sons and Lovers</i> is
that one feels an unrest, a little quiver and shimmer in his page,
as if it were composed of separate gleaming objects, by no means
content to stand still and be looked at. There is a scene of
course; a character; yes, and people related to each other by a net
of sensations; but these are not there&mdash;as in Proust&mdash;for
themselves. They do not admit of prolonged exploration, of rapture
in them for the sake of rapture, as one may sit in front of the
famous hawthorn hedge in <i>Swann's Way</i> and look at it. No,
there is always something further on, another goal. The impatience,
the need for getting on beyond the object before us, seem to
contract, to shrivel up, to curtail scenes to their barest, to
flash character simply and starkly in front of us. We must not look
for more than a second; we must hurry on. But to what?</p>

<p>Probably to some scene which has very little to do with
character, with story, with any of the usual resting places,
eminences, and consummations of the usual novel. The only thing
that we are given to rest upon, to expand upon, to feel to the
limits of our powers is some rapture of physical being. Such for
instance is the scene when Paul and Miriam swing in the barn. Their
bodies become incandescent, glowing, significant, as in other books
a passage of emotion burns in that way. For the writer it seems the
scene is possessed of a transcendental significance. Not in talk
nor in story nor in death nor in love, but here as the body of the
boy swings in the barn.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, because such a state cannot satisfy for long,
perhaps because Lawrence lacks the final power which makes things
entire in themselves, the effect of the book is that stability is
never reached. The world of <i>Sons and Lovers</i> is perpetually
in process of cohesion and dissolution. The magnet that tries to
draw together the different particles of which the beautiful and
vigorous world of Nottingham is made is this incandescent body,
this beauty glowing in the flesh, this intense and burning light.
Hence whatever we are shown seems to have a moment of its own.
Nothing rests secure to be looked at. All is being sucked away by
some dissatisfaction, some superior beauty, or desire, or
possibility. The book therefore excites, irritates, moves, changes,
seems full of stir and unrest and desire for something withheld,
like the body of the hero. The whole world&mdash;it is a proof of
the writer's remarkable strength&mdash;is broken and tossed by the
magnet of the young man who cannot bring the separate parts into a
unity which will satisfy him.</p>

<p>This allows, partly at least, of a simple explanation. Paul
Morel, like Lawrence himself, is the son of a miner. He is
dissatisfied with his conditions. One of his first actions on
selling a picture is to buy an evening suit. He is not a member,
like Proust, of a settled and satisfied society. He is anxious to
leave his own class and to enter another. He believes that the
middle class possess what he does not possess. His natural honesty
is too great to be satisfied with his mother's argument that the
common people are better than the middle class because they possess
more life. The middle class, Lawrence feels, possess ideas; or
something else that he wishes himself to have. This is one cause of
his unrest. And it is of profound importance. For the fact that he,
like Paul, was a miner's son, and that he disliked his conditions,
gave him a different approach to writing from those who have a
settled station and enjoy circumstances which allow them to forget
what those circumstances are.</p>

<p>Lawrence received a violent impetus from his birth. It set his
gaze at an angle from which it took some of its most marked
characteristics. He never looked back at the past, or at things as
if they were curiosities of human psychology, nor was he interested
in literature as literature. Everything has a use, a meaning, is
not an end in itself. Comparing him again with Proust, one feels
that he echoes nobody, continues no tradition, is unaware of the
past, of the present save as it affects the future. As a writer,
this lack of tradition affects him immensely. The thought plumps
directly into his mind; up spurt the sentences as round, as hard,
as direct as water thrown out in all directions by the impact of a
stone. One feels that not a single word has been chosen for its
beauty, or for its effect upon the architecture of the
sentence.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>ROGER FRY</h2>

<p><b>An Address given at the opening of the Roger Fry Memorial
Exhibition at the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery on Friday, July
1935.</b>
</p>

<p>When I was asked to open this exhibition of Roger Fry's pictures
my first instinct I admit was to refuse, for it seemed to me that
an exhibition of paintings ought to be opened by a painter or by a
critic of painting. But on second thoughts it struck me that this
particular exhibition, this memorial exhibition of Roger Fry's
pictures, might fitly be opened by someone who is not a painter or
a critic because Roger Fry did more than anyone to make such
people&mdash;such outsiders&mdash;enjoy looking at pictures. That
was my experience, and I think I am right in saying that there are
others in this room who have felt the same thing. Pictures were to
many of us&mdash;if I may generalise&mdash;things that hung upon
walls; silent inscrutable patterns; treasure houses with locked
doors in front of which learned people would stop, and about which
they would lecture, saying that they were of this period or of
that, of this school or of that, probably by this master, but
perhaps on the other hand by one of his disciples. And we would
trail behind them, silent, servile, and bored. Then all of a sudden
those dim pictures began to flash with light and colour; and our
guides, those respectable professors, began to argue and to
quarrel, called each other&mdash;if I remember rightly&mdash;liars
and cheats, and altogether began to behave like living people
arguing about something of vital importance. What had happened?
What had brought this life and colour, this racket and in into the
quiet galleries of ancient art? It was that Roger Fry had gathered
together the Post-Impressionist Exhibition in Dover Street; and the
names of Cezanne and Gauguin, of Matisse and Picasso, suddenly
became as hotly debated, as violently defended as the
names&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;of Ramsay MacDonald, Hitler, or
Lloyd George. That is many years ago.</p>

<p>The dust of that conflict has died down. But all the same
pictures have never gone back to their walls. They are no longer
silent, decorous, and dull. They are things we live with, and laugh
at, love and discuss. And I think I am right in saying that it was
Roger Fry more than anybody who brought about this change. He did
it, of course, by his writing and by his lecturing. Many of you
will have read his books, and will have heard his lectures. You
will know better than I can describe it how profoundly he felt
about the roots of art; how subtly, with that long white wand of
Ids, standing in front of his magic lantern, he would point to this
line and to that and would bring to the surface in new and
startling revelation those qualities that lie deep sunk in pictures
so that we saw them afresh. You will have felt this while he
lectured; you will still find it, happily, in his books; but I
would like, if I can, to give you some Paint idea how he did it in
his talk.</p>

<p>I remember an instance that struck me greatly one night last
summer. It was at a friend's house, and someone had brought him a
picture for his opinion. It was a question whether it was a genuine
picture by Degas, or whether it was an extremely skilful imitation.
The picture was stood on a chair, and Roger Fry sat and looked at
it. His eye, ranged over it, carefully, appreciatively. It was a
very good picture beyond a doubt; it was signed by Degas; it was in
the manner of Degas&mdash;he was inclined to think on the whole
that it was by Degas. And yet there was something that puzzled him;
something&mdash;he could not say what&mdash;that made him hesitate.
As if to rest himself, he turned away and took part in a discussion
that was going forward in another corner of the room&mdash;a
difficult discussion upon some abstract question of aesthetics. He
argued and he listened to others arguing. But now and again I saw
his eye go back to the picture as if it were feeling it, tasting
it, making a voyage of discovery on its own. Then there was a
pause. Suddenly he looked up and said: "No. No. That is not by
Degas."</p>

<p>There it seemed to me one had a glimpse for a moment into the
process that made him so great a critic. While he was arguing about
the theory of art in the abstract his eye was ranging over the
picture and bringing back its spoils. Then there was a moment of
fusion, of comprehension; and his mind was made up. "No," he said.
"It is not by Degas." But how was it done? By the union, it seemed
to me, of two different qualities&mdash;his reason and his
sensibility. Many people have one; many people have the other. But
few have both, and fewer still are able to make them both work in
harmony. But that was what he did. While he was reasoning he was
seeing; and while he was seeing he was reasoning. He was acutely
sensitive, but at the same time he was uncompromisingly honest. Was
this integrity, this honesty, a quality that he owed in part to his
Quaker blood? He came, as you know, of a great Quaker family, and I
have sometimes thought that this clarity, this sobriety of
judgment, this determination to get beneath the appearance to the
bedrock beneath are qualities that go with a Quaker upbringing. At
any rate he never allowed himself merely to feel; he always checked
and verified his impressions. Whether he upset other people's views
(as he did) or changed his own (and he did), he always used his
brain to correct his sensibility. And what was of equal importance,
he always allowed his sensibility to correct his brain.</p>

<p>Here I come to a point in speaking of him where I doubt if he
would let me go on. For I want to say that his understanding of art
owed much to his understanding of life, and yet I know that he
disliked the mingling and mixing of different things. He wanted art
to be art; literature to be literature; and life to be life. He was
an undaunted enemy of the sloppiness, the vagueness, the
sentimentality which has filled so many academies with anecdotes of
dogs and duchesses. He detested the story-telling spirit which has
clouded our painting and confused our criticism. But I will venture
to say that one of the reasons why his criticism always grew,
always went deeper, always included more, and never froze into the
rigidity of death was that he himself breasted so many different
currents of the stream of life. He was a man of many interests and
many sympathies. As a young man he had been trained as a scientist.
Science interested him profoundly. Poetry was one of his perpetual
delights. He was deeply versed in French literature. He was a great
lover of music. Anything that he could touch and handle and fashion
with his fingers fascinated him. He made plates and pots with his
own hands; he dyed stuffs; he designed furniture; he would come
into the kitchen and teach the cook how to make an omelette; he
would come into the drawing-room and teach the mistress how to
arrange a bunch of flowers. And just as connoisseurs would bring
him a picture for his opinion, so people of all kinds&mdash;and he
had friends of all kinds&mdash;would bring him their
lives&mdash;those canvases upon which we paint so many queer
designs&mdash;and he would bring to bear upon their muddles and
misfortunes the same rare mixture of logic and sympathy that made
him so invigorating as a critic. He would start people living again
just as he would start them painting again. And though I do not
want to mix up different things, still I believe it was because so
many interests, so many sympathies lived together in him that his
teaching remained so fertile and so fresh.</p>

<p>But there was another reason why his criticism never became, as
criticism so often does become, the repetition of a fixed idea. And
that was of course that he always painted himself. He cared more
for his painting than for his writing. The writing was done with
many groans in the afternoon when the light was bad; on the tops of
omnibuses; in the corners of third-class railway carriages. But
painting was an instinct&mdash;a delight. If one were walking with
him through the English fields, or driving with him along the roads
of Italy or Greece, suddenly he would stop, and look. "I-must just
make a note of that," he would say, and out would come a pencil and
a piece of paper and he would make a rough-and-ready sketch on the
spot.</p>

<p>Many of the pictures on these walls are the results of those
sketches. And because he painted himself he was perpetually forced
to meet with his own brush those problems with which he was dealing
with his pen. He knew from his own experience what labours, joys,
despairs, go to the making of pictures. A picture was to him not
merely the finished canvas but the canvas in the making. Every step
of that struggle, which ends sometimes in victory, but more often
in defeat, was known to him from his own daily battle. It was
because he painted himself that he kept so keen a sense of all the
intricate processes of painting; and that was why he had so high a
standard of what I may call the morality of art. No one knew better
than he did how hard it is to paint well; no one knew better than
he did how easy it is to palm off upon the public something that
does instead. That is why his criticism is so trenchant, so witty,
often so devastating in its exposure of humbug and pretence. That
too is why it is so full of respect and admiration for the artist
who has used his gift honourably and honestly even though it is a
small one.</p>

<p>He was never, I think, satisfied with his own painting; he never
met with the success which he deserved. But that made no difference
to his interest, to his activity. He went on painting; he went on
tearing up his pictures; he threw them away; he began them again.
And his devotion to his art seemed, if possible, to grow stronger
with the years. Had he lived to be a hundred he would have been
found, I am sure, sitting in front of a canvas with a brush in his
hand.</p>

<p>Therefore there is nothing that he would have liked more than
that you should have brought together this collection of his
paintings. And there is no exhibition that could rouse questions of
greater interest. We may ask ourselves, as we look at these
pictures, is it a good thing that an artist should be also a
critic, or does it inhibit his creative power? Is it necessary that
an artist, in order to use his genius fully, should live half
submerged in the dim world of ignorance, or on the contrary does
knowledge and the consciousness that comes with it lead him to be
more daring and more drastic in his researches and discoveries, and
so prolong his artistic life and give it new power and direction?
Such questions can be answered here as in no other room in England;
for no artist, I think I am right in saying, knew more about the
problems of his art than Roger Fry, or pursued them with a deeper
curiosity or with greater courage.</p>

<p>But here I touch upon questions that lie beyond my
scope&mdash;here I come to the pictures themselves; and I am not
able to speak of Roger Fry's pictures as a fellow painter or as a
fellow critic would speak of them. But speaking unprofessionally,
as an outsider, I am sure that Roger Fry, were he here, would have
made us all welcome equally to his exhibition. He would have asked
only that we should come to it, whatever our calling, whatever our
interests, with open eyes and open minds in the spirit of
enjoyment. He believed that the love of art lives in most people if
they will but give scope to it. He believed that the understanding
of art, the enjoyment of art, are among the most profound and
enduring pleasures that life has to give. I feel then that I am now
asking you to embark upon a voyage&mdash;upon a voyage in which he
will always be one of the great leaders, the great captains&mdash;a
voyage of discovery into the mind and art of a remarkable man; and
I have great pleasure in declaring this exhibition open.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>THE ART OF FICTION</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1927</i></b>
</p>

<p>That fiction is a lady, and a lady who has somehow got herself
into trouble, is a thought that must often have struck her
admirers. Many gallant gentlemen have ridden to her rescue, chief
among them Sir Walter Raleigh and Mr. Percy Lubbock. But both were
a little ceremonious in their approach; both, one felt, had a great
deal of knowledge of her, but not much intimacy with her. Now comes
Mr. Forster,* who disclaims knowledge but cannot deny that he knows
the lady well. If he lacks something of the others' authority, he
enjoys the privileges which are allowed the lover. He knocks at the
bedroom door and is admitted when the lady is in slippers and
dressing-gown. Drawing up their chairs to the fire they talk
easily, wittily, subtly, like old friends who have no illusions,
although in fact the bedroom is a lecture-room and the place the
highly austere city of Cambridge.</p>

<p>[* <i>Aspects of the Novel,</i> by E. M. Forster.]</p>

<p>This informal attitude on Mr. Forster's part is of course
deliberate. He is not a scholar; he refuses to be a pseudo-scholar.
There remains a point of view which the lecturer can adopt
usefully, if modestly. He can, as Mr. Forster puts it, "visualise
the English novelists not as floating down that stream which bears
all its sons away unless they are careful, but as seated together
in a room, a circular room&mdash;a sort of British Museum
reading-room&mdash;all writing their novels simultaneously". So
simultaneous are they, indeed, that they persist in writing out of
their turn. Richardson insists that he is contemporary with Henry
James. Wells will write a passage which might be written by
Dickens. Being a novelist himself, Mr. Forster is not annoyed at
this discovery. He knows from experience what a muddled and
illogical machine the brain of a writer is. He knows how little
they think about methods; how completely they forget their
grandfathers; how absorbed they tend to become in some vision of
their own. Thus, though the scholars have all his respect, his
sympathies are with the untidy and harassed people who are
scribbling away at their books. And looking down on-them, not from
any great height, but, as he says, over their shoulders, he makes
out, as he passes, that certain shapes and ideas tend to recur in
their minds whatever their period. Since story-telling began
stories have always been made of much the same elements; and these,
which he calls The Story, People, Plot, Fantasy, Prophecy, Pattern,
and Rhythm, he now proceeds to examine.</p>

<p>Many are the judgments that we would willingly argue, many are
the points over which we would willingly linger, as Mr. Forster
passes lightly on his way. That Scott is a storyteller and nothing
more; that a story is the lowest of literary organisms; that the
novelist's unnatural preoccupation with love is largely a
reflection of his own state of mind while he composes&mdash;every
page has a hint or a suggestion which makes us stop to think or
wish to contradict. Never raising his voice above the speaking
level, Mr. Forster has the art of saying things which sink airily
enough into the mind to stay there and unfurl like those Japanese
flowers which open up in the depths of the water. But greatly
though these sayings intrigue us, we want to call a halt at some
definite stopping place; we want to make Mr. Forster stand and
deliver. For possibly, if fiction is, as we suggest, in
difficulties, it may be because nobody grasps her firmly and
defines her severely. She has had no rules drawn up for her, very
little thinking done on her behalf. And though rules may be wrong
and must be broken, they have this advantage&mdash;they confer
dignity and order upon their subject; they admit her to a place in
civilised society; they prove that she is worthy of consideration.
But this part of his duty, if it is his duty, Mr. Forster expressly
disowns. He is not going to theorise about fiction except
incidentally; he doubts even whether she is to be approached by a
critic, and if so, with what critical equipment. All we can do is
to edge him into a position which is definite enough for us to see
where he stands. And perhaps the best way to do this is to quote,
much summarised, his estimates of three great
figures&mdash;Meredith, Hardy, and Henry James. Meredith is an
exploded philosopher. His vision of nature is "fluffy and lush".
When he gets serious and noble he becomes a bully. "And his novels;
most of the social values are faked. The tailors are not tailors,
the cricket matches are not cricket." Hardy is a far greater
writer. But he is not so successful as a novelist because his
characters are "required to contribute too much to the plot; except
in their rustic humours their vitality has been impoverished, they
have gone thin and dry&mdash;he has emphasised causality more
strongly than his medium permits". Henry James pursued the narrow
path of aesthetic duty and was successful. But at what a sacrifice?
"Most of human life has to disappear before he can do us a novel
Maimed creatures can alone breathe in his novels. His characters
are few in number and constructed on stingy lines."</p>

<p>Now if we look at these judgments, and place beside them certain
admissions and omissions, we shall see that if we cannot pin Mr.
Forster to a creed we can commit him to a point of view. There is
something&mdash;we hesitate to be more precise&mdash;which he calls
"life". It is to this that he brings the books of Meredith, Hardy,
or James for comparison. Always their failure is some failure in
relation to life. It is the humane as opposed to the aesthetic view
of fiction. It maintains that the novel is "sogged with humanity";
that "human beings have their great chance in the novel"; triumph
won at the expense of life is in fact a defeat. Thus we arrive at
the notably harsh judgment of Henry James. For Henry James brought
into the novel something besides human beings. He created patterns
which, though beautiful in themselves, are hostile to humanity. And
for his neglect of life, says Mr. Forster, he will perish.</p>

<p>But at this point the pertinacious pupil may demand: "What is
this 'Life' that keeps on cropping up so mysteriously and so
complacently in books about fiction? Why is it absent in a pattern
and present in a tea party? Why is the pleasure that we get from
the pattern in <i>The Golden Bowl</i> less valuable than the
emotion which Trollope gives us when he describes a lady drinking
tea in a parsonage? Surely the definition of life is too arbitrary,
and requires to be expanded." To all of this Mr. Forster would
reply, presumably, that he lays down no laws; the novel somehow
seems to him too soft a substance to be carved like the other arts;
he is merely telling us what moves him and what leaves him cold.
Indeed, there is no other criterion. So then we are back in the old
bog; nobody knows anything about the laws of fiction; or what its
relation is to life; or to what effects it can lend itself. We can
only trust our instincts. If instinct leads one reader to call
Scott a story-teller, another to call him a master of romance; if
one reader is moved by art, another by life, each is right, and
each can pile a card-house of theory on top of his opinion as high
as he can go. But the assumption that fiction is more intimately
and humbly attached to the service of human beings than the other
arts leads to a further position which Mr. Forster's book again
illustrates. It is unnecessary to dwell upon her aesthetic
functions because they are so feeble that they can safely be
ignored. Thus, though it is impossible to imagine a book on
painting in which not a word should be said about the medium in
which a painter works, a wise and brilliant book, like Mr.
Forster's, can be written about fiction without saying more than a
sentence or two about the medium in which a novelist works. Almost
nothing is said about words. One might suppose, unless one had read
them, that a sentence means the same thing and is used for the same
purposes by Sterne and by Wells. One might conclude that
<i>Tristram Shandy</i> gains nothing from the language in which it
is written. So with the other aesthetic qualities. Pattern, as we
have seen, is recognised, but savagely censured for her tendency to
obscure the human features. Beauty occurs but she is suspect. She
makes one furtive appearance&mdash;"beauty at which a novelist
should never aim, though he fails if he does not achieve
it"&mdash;and the possibility that she may emerge again as rhythm
is briefly discussed in a few interesting pages at the end. But for
the rest fiction is treated as a parasite which draws sustenance
from life and must in gratitude resemble life or perish. In poetry,
in drama, words may excite and stimulate and deepen without this
allegiance; but in fiction they must first and foremost hold
themselves at the service of the teapot and the pug dog, and to be
found wanting is to be found lacking.</p>

<p>Strange though this unaesthetic attitude would be in the critic
of any other art, it does not surprise us in the critic of fiction.
For one thing, the problem is extremely difficult. A book fades
like a mist, like a dream. How are we to take a stick and point to
that tone, that relation, in the vanishing pages, as Mr. Roger Fry
points with his wand at a line or a colour in the picture displayed
before him? Moreover, a novel in particular has roused a thousand
ordinary human feelings in its progress. To drag in art in such a
connection seems priggish and cold-hearted. It may well compromise
the critic as a man of feeling and domestic ties. And so while the
painter, the musician, and the poet come in for their share of
criticism, the novelist goes unscathed. His character will be
discussed; his morality, it may be his genealogy, will be examined;
but his writing will go scot-free. There is not a critic alive now
who will say that a novel is a work of art and that as such he will
judge it.</p>

<p>And perhaps, as Mr. Forster insinuates, the critics are right.
In England at any rate the novel is not a work of art. There are
none to be stood beside <i>War and Peace, The Brothers
Karamazov,</i> or <i>A la Recherche du Temps Perdu.</i> But while
we accept the fact, we cannot suppress one last conjecture. In
France and Russia they take fiction seriously. Flaubert spends a
month seeking a phrase to describe a cabbage. Tolstoy writes <i>War
and Peace</i> seven times over. Something of their pre-eminence may
be due to the pains they take, something to the severity with which
they are judged. If the English critic were less domestic, less
assiduous to protect the rights of what it pleases him to call
life, the novelist might be holder too. He might cut adrift from
the eternal tea-table and the plausible and preposterous formulas
which are supposed to represent the whole of our human adventure.
But then the story might wobble; the plot might crumble; ruin might
seize upon the characters. The novel, in short, might become a work
of art.</p>

<p>Such are the dreams that Mr. Forster leads us to cherish. For
his is a book to encourage dreaming. None more suggestive has been
written about the poor lady whom, with perhaps mistaken chivalry,
we still persist in calling the art of fiction.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>AMERICAN FICTION</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1925</i></b>
</p>

<p>Excursions into the literature of a foreign country much
resemble our travels abroad. Sights that are taken for</p>

<p>granted by the inhabitants seem to us astonishing; however well
we seemed to know the language at home, it sounds differently on
the lips of those who have spoken it from birth; and above all, in
our desire to get at the heart of the country we seek out whatever
it may be that is most unlike what we are used to, and declaring
this to be the very essence of the French or American genius
proceed to lavish upon it a credulous devotion, to build up upon it
a structure of theory which may well amuse, annoy, or even
momentarily enlighten those who are French or American by
birth.</p>

<p>The English tourist' in American literature wants above all
things something different from what he has at home. For this
reason the one American writer whom the English wholeheartedly
admire is Walt Whitman. There, you will hear them say, is the real
American undisguised. In the whole of English literature there is
no figure which resembles his&mdash;among all our poetry none in
the least comparable to <i>Leaves of Grass.</i> This very
unlikeness becomes a merit, and leads us, as we steep ourselves in
the refreshing unfamiliarity, to become less and less able to
appreciate Emerson, Lowell, Hawthorne, who have had their
counterparts among us and drew their culture from our books. The
obsession, whether well or ill founded, fair or unfair in its
results, persists at the present moment. To dismiss such
distinguished names as those of Henry James, Mr. Hergesheimer, and
Mrs. Wharton would be impossible; but their praises are qualified
with the reservation&mdash;they are not Americans; they do not give
us anything that we have not got already.</p>

<p>Thus having qualified the tourist's attitude, in its crudity and
one-sidedness, let us begin our excursion into modern American
fiction by asking what are the sights we ought to see. Here our
bewilderment begins; for the names of so many authors, the titles
of so many books, rise at once to the lips. Mr. Dreiser, Mr.
Cabell, Miss Canfield, Mr. Sherwood Anderson, Miss Hurst, Mr.
Sinclair Lewis, Miss Willa Cather, Mr. Ring Lardner&mdash;all have
done work which, if time allowed, we should do well to examine
carefully, and, if we must concentrate upon two or three at most,
it is because, travellers and tourists as we are, it seems best to
sketch a theory of the tendency of American fiction from the
inspection of a few important books rather than to examine each
writer separately by himself. Of all American novelists the most
discussed and read in England at the present moment are probably
Mr. Sherwood Anderson and Mr. Sinclair Lewis. And among all their
fiction we find one volume, <i>A Story Teller's Story,</i> which,
being fact rather than fiction, may serve as interpreter, may help
us to guess the nature of American writers' problems before we see
them tussled with or solved. Peering over Mr. Sherwood Anderson's
shoulder, we may get a preliminary view of the world as it looks to
the novelist before it is disguised and arranged for the reception
of his characters. Indeed, if we look over Mr. Anderson's shoulder,
America appears a very strange place. What is it that we see here?
A vast continent, scattered here and there with brand new villages
which nature has not absorbed into herself with ivy and moss,
summer and winter, as in England, but man has built recently,
hastily, economically, so that the village is like the suburb of a
town. The slow English wagons are turned into Ford cars; the
primrose banks have become heaps of old tins; the barns sheds of
corrugated iron. It is cheap, it is new, it is ugly, it is made of
odds and ends, hurriedly flung together, loosely tied in temporary
cohesion&mdash;that is the burden of Mr. Anderson's complaint. And,
he proceeds to ask, how can the imagination of an artist take root
here, where the soil is stony and the imagination stubs itself upon
the rocks? There is one solution and one only&mdash;by being
resolutely and defiantly American. Explicitly and implicitly that
is the conclusion he reaches; that is the note which turns the
discord to harmony. Mr. Anderson is for ever repeating over and
over like a patient hypnotising himself, "I am the American man".
The words rise in his mind with the persistency of a submerged but
fundamental desire. Yes, he is the American man; it is a terrible
misfortune; it is an enormous opportunity; but for good or for bad,
he is the American man. "Behold in me the American man striving to
become an artist, to become conscious of himself, filled with
wonder concerning himself and others, trying to have a good time
and not fake a good time. I am not English, Italian, Jew, German,
Frenchman, Russian. What am I?" Yes, we may be excused for
repeating, what is he? One thing is certain&mdash;whatever the
American man may be, he is not English; whatever he may become, he
will not become an Englishman.</p>

<p>For that is the first step in the process of being
American&mdash;to be not English. The first step in the education
of an American writer is to dismiss the whole army of English words
which have marched so long under the command of dead English
generals. He must tame and compel to his service the "little
American words"; he must forget all that he learnt in the school of
Fielding and Thackeray; he must learn to write as he talks to men
in Chicago bar-rooms, to men in the factories of Indiana. That is
the first step; but the next step is far more difficult. For having
decided what he is not, he must proceed to discover what he is.
This is the beginning of a stage of acute self-consciousness which
manifests itself in writers otherwise poles asunder. Nothing,
indeed, surprises the English tourist more than the prevalence of
this self-consciousness and the bitterness, for the most part
against England, with which it is accompanied. One is reminded
constantly of the attitude of another race, till lately subject and
still galled by the memory of its chains. Women writers have to
meet many of the same problems that beset Americans. They too are
conscious of their own peculiarities as a sex; apt to suspect
insolence, quick to avenge grievances, eager to shape an art of
their own. In both cases all kinds of
consciousness&mdash;consciousness of self, of race, of sex, of
civilisation&mdash;which have nothing to do with art, have got
between them and the paper, with results that are, on the surface
at least, unfortunate. It is easy enough to see that Mr. Anderson,
for example, would be a much more perfect artist if he could forget
that he is an American; he would write better prose if he could use
all words impartially, new or old, English or American, classical
or slang.</p>

<p>Nevertheless as we turn from his autobiography to his fiction we
are forced to own (as some women writers also make us own) that to
come fresh to the world, to turn a new angle to the light, is so
great an achievement that for its sake we can pardon the
bitterness, the self-consciousness, the angularity which inevitably
go with it. In <i>The Triumph of the Egg</i> there is some
rearrangement of the old elements of art which makes us rub our
eyes. The feeling recalls that with which we read Chekhov for the
first time. There are no familiar handles to lay hold of in <i>The
Triumph of the Egg</i>. The stories baffle our efforts, slip
through our fingers and leave us feeling, not that it is Mr.
Anderson who has failed us, but that we as readers have muffed our
work and must go back, like chastened schoolchildren, and spell the
lesson over again in the attempt to lay hold of the meaning.</p>

<p>Mr. Anderson has bored into that deeper and warmer layer of
human nature which it would be frivolous to ticket new or old,
American or European. In his determination to be "true to the
essence of things" he has fumbled his way into something genuine,
persistent, of universal significance, in proof of which he has
done what, after all, very few writers succeed in doing&mdash;he
has made a world of his own. It is a world in which the senses
flourish; it is dominated by instincts rather than by ideas;
racehorses make the hearts of little boys beat high; cornfields
flow around the cheap towns like golden seas, illimitable and
profound; everywhere boys and girls are dreaming of voyages and
adventures, and this world of sensuality and instinctive desire is
clothed in a warm cloudy atmosphere, wrapped about in a soft
caressing envelope, which always seems a little too loose to fit
the shape. Pointing to the formlessness of Mr. Anderson's work, the
vagueness of his language, his tendency to land his stories softly
in a bog, the English tourist would say that all this confirms him
in his theory of what is to be expected of an American writer of
insight and sincerity. The softness, the shellessness of Mr.
Anderson are inevitable since he has scooped out from the heart of
America matter which has never been confined in a shell before. He
is too much enamoured of this precious stuff to squeeze it into any
of those old and intricate poems which the art and industry of
Europe have secreted. Rather he will leave what he has found
exposed, defenceless, naked to scorn and laughter.</p>

<p>But if this theory holds good of the work of American novelists,
how then are we to account for the novels of Mr. Sinclair Lewis?
Does it not explode at the first touch of <i>Babbitt</i> and
<i>Main Street</i> and <i>Our Mr. Wrenn</i> like a soap bubble
dashed against the edge of a hard mahogany wardrobe? For it is
precisely by its hardness, its efficiency, its compactness that Mr.
Lewis's work excels. Yet he also is an American; he also has
devoted book after book to the description and elucidation of
America. Far from being shelless, however, his books, one is
inclined to say, are all shell; the only doubt is whether he has
left any room for the snail. At any rate <i>Babbitt</i> completely
refutes the theory that an American writer, writing about America,
must necessarily lack the finish, the technique, the power to model
and control his material which one might suppose to be the bequest
of an old civilisation to its artists. In all these respects,
<i>Babbitt is</i> the equal of any novel written in English in the
present century. The tourist therefore must make his choice between
two alternatives. Either there is no profound difference between
English and American writers, and their experience is so similar
that it can be housed in the same form; or Mr. Lewis has modelled
himself so closely upon the English&mdash;H. G. Wells is a very
obvious master&mdash;that he has sacrificed his American
characteristics in the process. But the art of reading would be
simpler and less adventurous than it is if writers could be
parcelled out in strips of green and blue. Study of Mr. Lewis more
and more convinces us that the surface appearance of downright
decision is deceptive; the outer composure hardly holds together
the warring elements within; the colours have run.</p>

<p>For though <i>Babbitt</i> would appear as solid and authentic a
portrait of the American business man as can well be painted,
certain doubts run across us and shake our conviction. But, we may
ask, where all is so masterly, self-assured, and confident, what
foothold can there be for doubt to lodge upon? To begin with we
doubt Mr. Lewis himself: we doubt, that is to say, that he is
nearly as sure of himself or of his subject as he would have us
believe. For he, too, though in a way very different from Mr.
Anderson's way, is writing with one eye on Europe, a division of
attention which the reader is quick to feel and resent. He too has
the American self-consciousness, though it is masterfully
suppressed and allowed only to utter itself once or twice in a
sharp cry of bitterness ("Babbitt was as much amused by the
antiquated provincialism as any proper Englishman by any
American"). But the uneasiness is there. He has not identified
himself with America; rather he has constituted himself the guide
and interpreter between the Americans and the English, and, as he
conducts his party of Europeans over the typical American city (of
which he is a native) and shows them the typical American citizen
(to whom he is related) he is equally divided between shame at what
he has to show and anger at the Europeans for laughing at it.
Zenith is a despicable place, but the English are even more
despicable for despising it.</p>

<p>In such an atmosphere intimacy is impossible. All that a writer
of Mr. Lewis's powers can do is to be unflinchingly accurate and
more and more on his guard against giving himself away.
Accordingly, never was so complete a model of a city made before.
We turn on the taps and the water runs; we press a button and
cigars are lit and beds warmed. But this glorification of
machinery, this lust for "toothpastes, socks, tires, cameras,
instantaneous hot water bottles...at first the signs, then the
substitutes for joy and passion and wisdom" is only a device for
putting off the evil day which Mr. Lewis sees looming ahead.
However he may dread what people will think of him, he must give
himself away. Babbitt must be proved to possess some share in truth
and beauty, some character, some emotion of his own, or Babbitt
will be nothing but an improved device for running motor cars, a
convenient surface for the display of mechanical ingenuity. To make
us care for Babbitt&mdash;that was his problem. With this end in
view Mr. Lewis shamefacedly assures us that Babbitt has his dreams.
Stout though he is, this elderly business man dreams of a fairy
child waiting at a gate. "Her dear and tranquil hand caressed his
cheek. He was gallant and wise and well-beloved; warm ivory were
her arms; and beyond perilous moors the brave sea glittered." But
that is not a dream; that is simply the protest of a man who has
never dreamed in his life, but is determined to prove that dreaming
is as easy as shelling peas. What are dreams made of&mdash;the most
expensive dreams? Seas, fairies, moors? Well, he will have a little
of each, and if that is not a dream, he seems to demand, jumping
out of bed in a fury, what then is it? With sex relations and
family affection he is much more at ease. Indeed it would be
impossible to deny that if we put our ears to his shell, the
foremost citizen in Zenith can be heard moving cumbrously but
unmistakably within. One has moments of affection for him, moments
of sympathy and even of desire that some miracle may happen, the
rock be cleft asunder, and the living creature, with his capacity
for fun, suffering, and happiness, be set at liberty. But no; his
movements are too sluggish; Babbitt will never escape; he will die
in his prison, bequeathing only the chance of escape to his
son.</p>

<p>In some such way as this, then, the English tourist makes his
theory embrace both Mr. Anderson and Mr. Sinclair Lewis. Both
suffer as novelists from being American; Mr. Anderson, because he
must protest his pride; Mr. Lewis, because he must conceal his
bitterness. Mr. Anderson's way is the less injurious to him as an
artist, and his imagination is the more vigorous of the two. He has
gained more than he has lost by being the spokesman of a new
country, the worker in fresh clay. Mr. Lewis it would seem was
meant by nature to take his place with Mr. Wells and Mr. Bennett,
and had he been born in England would undoubtedly have proved
himself the equal of these two famous men. Denied, however, the
richness of an old civilisation&mdash;the swarm of ideas upon which
the art of Mr. Wells has battened, the solidity of custom which has
nourished the art of Mr. Bennett&mdash;he has been forced to
criticise rather than to explore, and the object of his
criticism&mdash;the civilisation of Zenith&mdash;was unfortunately
too meagre to sustain him. Yet a little reflection, and a
comparison between Mr. Anderson and Mr. Lewis, put a different
colour on our conclusion. Look at Americans as an American, see
Mrs. Opal Emerson Mudge as she is herself, not as a type and symbol
of America displayed for the amusement of the condescending
Britisher, and then, we dimly suspect, Mrs. Mudge is no type, no
scarecrow, no abstraction. Mrs. Mudge is&mdash;but it is not for an
English writer to say what. He can only peep and peer between the
chinks of the barrier and hazard the opinion that Mrs. Mudge and
the Americans generally are, somehow, human beings into the
bargain.</p>

<p>That suspicion suddenly becomes a certainty as we read the first
pages of Mr. Ring Lardner's <i>You Know Me, Al,</i> and the change
is bewildering. Hitherto we have been kept at arm's length,
reminded constantly of our superiority, of our inferiority, of the
fact, anyhow, that we are alien blood and bone. But Mr. Lardner is
not merely unaware that we differ; he is unaware that we exist.
When a crack player is in the middle of an exciting game of
baseball he does not stop to wonder whether the audience likes the
colour of his hair. All his mind is on the game. So Mr. Lardner
does not waste a moment when he writes in thinking whether he is
using American slang or Shakespeare's English; whether he is
remembering Fielding or forgetting Fielding; whether he is proud of
being American or ashamed of not being Japanese; all his mind is on
the story. Hence all our minds are on the story. Hence,
incidentally, he writes the best prose that has come our way. Hence
we feel at last freely admitted to the society of our fellows.</p>

<p>That this should be true of <i>You Know Me, Al,</i> a story
about baseball, a game which is not played in England, a story
written often in a language which is not English, gives us pause.
To what does he owe his success? Besides his unconsciousness and
the additional power which he is thus free to devote to his art,
Mr. Lardner has talents of a remarkable order. With extraordinary
ease and aptitude, with the quickest strokes, the surest touch, the
sharpest insight, he lets Jack Keefe the baseball player cut out
his own outline, fill in his own depths, until the figure of the
foolish, boastful, innocent athlete lives before us. As he babbles
out his mind on paper there rise up friends, sweethearts, the
scenery, town, and country&mdash;all surround him and make him up
in his completeness. We gaze into the depths of a society which
goes its ways intent on its own concerns. There, perhaps, is one of
the elements of Mr. Lardner's success. He is not merely himself
intent on his own game, but his characters are equally intent on
theirs. It is no coincidence that the best of Mr. Lardner's stories
are about games, for one may guess that Mr. Lardner's interest in
games has solved one of the most difficult problems of the American
writer; it has given him a clue, a centre, a meeting place for the
divers activities of people whom a vast continent isolates, whom no
tradition controls. Games give him what society gives his English
brother. Whatever the precise reason, Mr. Lardner at any rate
provides something unique in its kind, something indigenous to the
soil, which the traveller may carry off as a trophy to prove to the
incredulous that he has actually been to America and found it a
foreign land. But the time has come when the tourist must reckon up
his expenses and experiences, and attempt to cast up his account of
the tour as a whole.</p>

<p>At the outset let us admit that our impressions are highly mixed
and the opinions we have come to, if anything, less definite, less
assured than those with which we started. For when we consider the
mixed origin of the literature we are trying to understand, its
youth, its age, and all those currents which are blowing across the
stream of its natural development, we may well exclaim that French
is simpler, English is simpler, all modern literatures are simpler
to sum up and understand than this new American literature. A
discord lies at the root of it; the natural bent of the American is
twisted at the start. For the more sensitive he is, the more he
must read English literature; the more he reads English literature,
the more alive he must become to the puzzle and perplexity of this
great art which uses the language on his own lips to express an
experience which is not his and to mirror a civilisation which he
has never known. The choice has to be made&mdash;whether to yield
or to rebel. The more sensitive, or at least the more
sophisticated, the Henry Jameses, the Hergesheimers, the Edith
Whartons, decide in favour of England 'and pay the penalty by
exaggerating the English culture, the traditional English good
manners, and stressing too heavily or in the wrong places those
social differences which, though the first to strike the foreigner,
are by no means the most profound. What their work gains in
refinement it loses in that perpetual distortion of values, that
obsession with surface distinctions&mdash;the age of old houses,
the glamour of great names&mdash;which makes it necessary to
remember that Henry James was a foreigner if we are not to call him
a snob.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the simpler and cruder writers, like Walt
Whitman, Mr. Anderson, Mr. Masters&mdash;decide in favour of
America, but truculently, self-consciously, protestingly, "showing
off" as the nurses would say, their newness, their independence,
their individuality. Both influences are unfortunate and serve to
obscure and delay the development of the real American literature
itself. But, some critics would interpose, are we not making
mountains out of molehills, conjuring up distinctions where none
exist? The "real American literature" in the time of Hawthorne,
Emerson, and Lowell was much of a piece with contemporary English
literature, and the present movement towards a national literature
is confined to a few enthusiasts and extremists who will grow older
and wiser and see the folly of their ways.</p>

<p>But the tourist can no longer accept this comfortable doctrine,
flattering though it be to his pride of birth. Obviously there are
American writers who do not care a straw for English opinion or for
English culture, and write very vigorously none the
less&mdash;witness Mr. Lardner; there are Americans who have all
the accomplishments of culture without a trace of its
excess&mdash;witness Miss Willa Cather; there are Americans whose
aim it is to write a book off their own bat and no one
else's&mdash;witness Miss Fannie Hurst. But the shortest tour, the
most superficial inspection, must impress him with what is of far
greater importance&mdash;the fact that where the land itself is so
different, and the society so different, the literature must needs
differ, and differ more and more widely as time goes by, from those
of other countries.</p>

<p>American literature will be influenced, no doubt, like all
others, and the English influence may well predominate But clearly
the English tradition is already unable to cope with this vast
land, these prairies, these cornfields, these lonely little groups
of men and women scattered at immense distances from each other,
these vast industrial cities with their skyscrapers and their night
signs and their perfect organisation of machinery. It cannot
extract their meaning and interpret their beauty. How could it be
otherwise? The English tradition is formed upon a little country;
its centre is an old house with many rooms each crammed with
objects and crowded with people who know each other intimately,
whose manners, thoughts, and speech are ruled all the time, if
unconsciously, by the spirit of the past. But in America there is
baseball instead of society; instead of the old landscape which has
moved men to emotion for endless summers and springs, a new land,
its tin cans, its prairies, its cornfields flung disorderly about
like a mosaic of incongruous pieces waiting order at the artist's
hands; while the people are equally diversified into fragments of
many nationalities.</p>

<p>To describe, to unify, to make order out of all these severed
parts, anew art is needed and the control of a new tradition. That
both are in process of birth the language itself gives us proof.
For the Americans are doing what the Elizabethans did&mdash;they
are coining new words. They are instinctively making the language
adapt itself to their needs. In England, save for the impetus given
by the war, the word-coining power has lapsed; our writers vary the
metres of their poetry, remodel the rhythms of prose, but one may
search English fiction in vain for a single new word. It is
significant that when we want to freshen our speech we borrow from
America&mdash;poppycock, rambunctious, flipflop, booster,
good-mixer&mdash;all the expressive ugly vigorous slang which
creeps into use among us first in talk, later in writing, comes
from across the Atlantic. Nor does it need much foresight to
predict that when words are being made, a literature will be made
out of them. Already we hear the first jars and dissonances, the
strangled difficult music of the prelude. As we shut our books and
look out again upon the English fields a strident note rings in our
ears. We hear the first lovemaking and the first laughter of the
child who was exposed by its parents three hundred years ago upon a
rocky shore and survived solely by its own exertions and is a
little sore and proud and diffident and self-assertive in
consequence and is now on the threshold of man's estate.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>THE LEANING TOWER</h2>

<p><b><i>A paper read to the Workers' Educational Association,
Brighton, May 1940.</i></b>
</p>

<p>A writer is a person who sits at a desk and keeps his eye fixed,
as intently as he can, upon a certain object&mdash;that figure of
speech may help to keep us steady on our path if we look at it for
a moment. He is an artist who sits with a sheet of paper in front
of him trying to copy what he sees. What is his object&mdash;his
model? Nothing so simple as a painter's model; it is not a bowl of
flowers, a naked figure, or a dish of apples and onions. Even the
simplest story deals with more than one person, with more than one
time. Characters begin young; they grow old; they move from scene
to scene, from place to place. A writer has to keep his eye upon a
model that moves, that changes, upon an object that is not one
object but innumerable objects. Two words alone cover all that a
writer looks at&mdash;they are, human life.</p>

<p>Let us look at the writer next. What do we see&mdash;only a
person who sits with a pen in his hand in front of a sheet of
paper? That tells us little or nothing. And we know very little.
Considering how much we talk about writers, how much they talk
about themselves, it is odd how little we know about them. Why are
they so common sometimes; then so rare? Why do they sometimes write
nothing but masterpieces, then nothing but trash? And why should a
family, like the Shelleys, like the Keatses, like the Bront&euml;s,
suddenly burst into flame and bring to birth Shelley, Keats, and
the Bront&euml;s? What are the conditions that bring about that
explosion? There is no answer&mdash;naturally. Since we have not
yet discovered the germ of influenza, how should we yet have
discovered the germ of genius? We know even less about the mind
than about the body. We have less evidence. It is less than two
hundred years since people took an interest in themselves; Boswell
was almost the first writer who thought that a man's life was worth
writing a book about. Until we have more facts, more biographies,
more autobiographies, we cannot know much about ordinary people,
let alone about extraordinary people. Thus at present we have only
theories about writers&mdash;a great many theories, but they all
differ. The politician says that a writer is the product of the
society in which he lives, as a screw is the product of a screw
machine; the artist, that a writer is a heavenly apparition that
slides across the sky, grazes the earth, and vanishes. To the
psychologists a writer is an oyster; feed him on gritty facts,
irritate him with ugliness, and by way of compensation, as they
call it, he will produce a pearl. The genealogists say that certain
stocks, certain families, breed writers as fig trees breed
figs&mdash;Dryden, Swift, and Pope they tell us were all cousins.
This proves that we are in the dark about writers; anybody can make
a theory; the germ of a theory is almost always the wish to prove
what the theorist wishes to believe.</p>

<p>Theories then are dangerous things. All the same we must risk
making one this afternoon since we are going to discuss modern
tendencies. Directly we speak of tendencies or movements we commit
ourselves to the belief that there is some force, influence, outer
pressure which is strong enough to stamp itself upon a whole group
of different writers so that all their writing has a certain common
likeness. We must then have a theory as to what this influence is.
But let us always remember&mdash;influences are infinitely
numerous; writers are infinitely sensitive; each writer has a
different sensibility. That is why literature is always changing,
like the weather, like the clouds in the sky. Read a page of Scott;
then of Henry James; try to work out the influences that have
transformed the one page into the other. It is beyond our skill. We
can only hope therefore to single out the most obvious influences
that have formed writers into groups. Yet there are groups. Books
descend from books as families descend from families. Some descend
from Jane Austen; others from Dickens. They resemble their parents,
as human children resemble their parents; yet they differ as
children differ, and revolt as children revolt. Perhaps it will be
easier to understand living writers as we take a quick look at some
of their forebears. We have not time to go far back&mdash;certainly
we have not time to look closely. But let us glance at English
writers as they were a hundred years ago&mdash;that may help us to
see what we ourselves look like.</p>

<p>In 1815 England was at war, as England is now. And it is natural
to ask, how did their war&mdash;the Napoleonic war&mdash;affect
them? Was that one of the influences that formed them into groups?
The answer is a very strange one. The Napoleonic wars did not
affect the great majority of those writers at all. The proof of
that is to be found in the work of two great novelists&mdash;Jane
Austen and Walter Scott. Each lived through the Napoleonic wars;
each' wrote through them. But, though novelists live very close to
the life of their time, neither of them in all their novels
mentioned the Napoleonic wars. This shows that their model, their
vision of human life, was not disturbed or agitated or changed by
war. Nor were they themselves. It is easy to see why that was so.
Wars were then remote; wars were carried on by soldiers and
sailors, not by private people. The rumour of battles took a long
time to reach England. It was only when the mail coaches clattered
along the country roads hung with laurels that the people in
villages like Brighton knew that a victory had been won and lit
their candles and stuck them in their windows. Compare that with
our state to-day. To-day we hear the gunfire in the Channel. We
turn on the wireless; we hear an airman telling us how this very
afternoon he shot down a raider; his machine caught fire; he
plunged into the sea; the light turned green and then black; he
rose to the top and was rescued by a trawler. Scott never saw the
sailors drowning at Trafalgar; Jane Austen never heard the cannon
roar at Waterloo. Neither of them heard Napoleon's voice as we hear
Hitler's voice as we sit at home of an evening.</p>

<p>That immunity from war lasted all through the nineteenth
century. England, of course, was often at war&mdash;there was the
Crimean War; the Indian Mutiny; all the little Indian frontier
wars, and at the end of the century the Boer War. Keats, Shelley,
Byron, Dickens, Thackeray, Carlyle, Ruskin, the Bront&euml;s,
George Eliot, Trollope, the Brownings&mdash;all lived through all
those wars. But did they ever mention them? Only Thackeray, I
think; in <i>Vanity Fair</i> he described the Battle of Waterloo
long after it was fought; but only as an illustration, as a scene.
It did not change his characters' lives; it merely killed one of
his heroes. Of the poets, only Byron and Shelley felt the influence
of the nineteenth-century wars profoundly.</p>

<p>War then we can say, speaking roughly, did not affect either the
writer or his vision of human life in the nineteenth century. But
peace&mdash;let us consider the influence of peace. Were the
nineteenth-century writers affected by the settled, the peaceful
and prosperous state of England? Let us collect a few facts before
we launch out into the dangers and delights of theory. We know for
a fact, from their lives, that the nineteenth-century writers were
all of them fairly well-to-do middle-class people. Most had been
educated either at Oxford or at Cambridge. Some were civil servants
like Trollope and Matthew Arnold. Others, like Ruskin, were
professors. It is a fact that their work brought them considerable
fortunes. There is visible proof of that in the houses they built.
Look at Abbotsford, bought out of the proceeds of Scott's novels;
or at Farringford, built by Tennyson from his poetry. Look at
Dickens's great house in Marylebone; and at his great house at
Gadshill. All these are houses needing many butlers, maids,
gardeners, grooms to keep the .tables spread, the cans carried, and
the gardens neat and fruitful. Not only did they leave behind them
large houses; they left too an immense body of
literature&mdash;poems, plays, novels, essays, histories,
criticism. It was a very prolific, creative, rich century&mdash;the
nineteenth century. Now let us ask&mdash;is there any connection
between that material prosperity and that intellectual
creativeness? Did one lead to the other? How difficult it is to
say&mdash;for we know so little about writers, and what conditions
help them, what hinder them. It is only a guess, and a rough guess;
yet I think that there is a connection. "I think"&mdash;perhaps it
would be nearer the truth to say "I see". Thinking should be based
on facts; and here we have intuitions rather than facts&mdash;the
lights and shades that come after books are read, the general
shifting surface of a large expanse of print. What I see, glancing
over that shifting surface, is the picture I have already shown
you; the writer seated in front of human life in the nineteenth
century; and, looking at it through their eyes, I see that life
divided up, herded together, into many different, classes. There is
the aristocracy; the landed gentry; the professional class; the
commercial class; the working class; and there, in one dark blot,
is that great class which is called simply and comprehensively "The
Poor". To the nineteenth-century writer human life must have looked
like a landscape cut up into separate fields. In each field was
gathered a different group of people. Each to some extent had its
own traditions; its own manners; its own speech; its own dress; its
own occupation. But owing to that peace, to that prosperity, each
group was tethered, stationary&mdash;a herd grazing within its own
hedges. And the nineteenth-century writer did not seek to change
those divisions; he accepted them. He accepted them so completely
that he became unconscious of them. Does that serve to explain why
it is that the nineteenth-century writers are able to create so
many characters who are not types but individuals? Is it because he
did not see the hedges that divide classes; he saw only the human
beings that live within those hedges? Is that why he could get
beneath the surface and create many sided
characters&mdash;Pecksniff, Becky Sharp, Mr. Woodhouse&mdash;who
change with the years, as the living change? To us now the hedges
are visible. We can see now that each of those writers only dealt
with a very small section of human life&mdash;all Thackeray's
characters are upper middle-class people; all Dickens's characters
come from the lower or middle class. We can see that now; but the
writer himself seems unconscious that he is only dealing with one
type; with the type formed by the class into which the writer was
born himself, with which he is most familiar. And that
unconsciousness was an immense advantage to him.</p>

<p>Unconsciousness, which means presumably that the under-mind,
works at top speed while the upper-mind drowses, is a state we all
know. We all have experience of the work done by unconsciousness in
our own daily lives. You have had a crowded day, let us suppose,
sightseeing in London. Could you say what you had seen and done
when you came back? Was it not all a blur, a confusion? But after
what seemed a rest, a chance to turn aside and look at something
different, the sights and sounds and sayings that had been of most
interest to you swam to the surface, apparently of their own
accord; and remained in memory; what was unimportant sank into
forgetfulness. So it is with the writer. After a hard day's work,
trudging round, seeing all he can, feeling all he can, taking in
the book of his mind innumerable notes, the writer becomes&mdash;if
he can&mdash;unconscious. In fact, his under-mind works at top
speed while his upper-mind drowses. Then, after a pause the veil
lifts; and there is the thing&mdash;the thing he wants to write
about&mdash;simplified, composed. Do we strain Wordsworth's famous
saying about emotion recollected in tranquillity when we infer that
by tranquillity he meant that the writer needs to become
unconscious before he can create?</p>

<p>If we want to risk a theory, then, we can say that peace and
prosperity were influences that gave the nineteenth-century writers
a family likeness. They had leisure; they had security; life was
not going to change; they themselves were not going to change. They
could look; and look away. They could forget; and then&mdash;in
their books&mdash;remember. Those then are some of the conditions
that brought about a certain family likeness, in spite of the great
individual differences, among the nineteenth-century writers. The
nineteenth century ended; but the same conditions went on. They
lasted, roughly speaking, till the year 1914. Even in 1914 we can
still see the writer sitting as he sat all through the nineteenth
century looking at human life; and that human life is still divided
into classes; he still looks most intently at the class from which
he himself springs; the classes are still so settled that he has
almost forgotten that there are classes; and he is still so secure
himself that he is almost unconscious of his own position and of
its security. He believes that he is looking at the whole of life;
and will always so look at it. That is not altogether a fancy
picture. Many of those writers are still alive. Sometimes they
describe their own position as young men, beginning to write, just
before August 1914. How did you learn your art? one can ask them.
At College they say&mdash;by reading; by listening; by talking.
What did they talk about? Here is Mr. Desmond MacCarthy's answer,
as he gave it, a week or two ago, in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> He
was at Cambridge just before the war began and he says: "We were
not very much interested in politics. Abstract speculation was much
more absorbing; philosophy was more interesting to us than public
causes...What we chiefly discussed were those 'goods' which were
ends in themselves...the search for truth, aesthetic emotions, and
personal relations." In addition they read an immense amount; Latin
and Greek, and of course French and English. They wrote
too&mdash;but they were in no hurry to publish. They
travelled;&mdash;some of them went far afield&mdash;to India, to
the South Seas. But for the most part they rambled happily in the
long summer holidays through England, through France, through
Italy. And now and then they published books&mdash;books like
Rupert Brooke's poems; novels like E. M. Forster's <i>Room with a
View;</i> essays like G. K. Chesterton's essays, and reviews. It
seemed to them that they were to go on living like that, and
writing like that, for ever and ever. Then suddenly, like a chasm
in a smooth road, the war came.</p>

<p>But before we go on with the story of what happened after 1914,
let us look more closely for a moment, not at the writer himself;
nor at his model; but at his chair. A chair is a very important
part of a writer's outfit. It is the chair that gives him his
attitude towards his model; that decides what he sees of human
life; that profoundly affects his power of telling us what he sees.
By his chair we mean his upbringing, his education. It is a fact,
not a theory, that all writers from Chaucer to the present day,
with so few exceptions that one hand can count them, have sat upon
the same kind of chair&mdash;a raised chair. They have all come
from the middle class; they have had good, at least expensive,
educations. They have all been raised above the mass of people upon
a tower of stucco&mdash;that is their middle-class birth; and of
gold&mdash;that is their expensive education. That was true of all
the nineteenth-century writers, save Dickens; it was true of all
the 1914 writers, save D. H. Lawrence. Let us run through what are
called "representative names": G. K. Chesterton; T. S. Eliot;
Belloc; Lytton Strachey; Somerset Maugham; Hugh Walpole; Wilfred
Owen; Rupert Brooke; J. E. Flecker; E. M. Forster; Aldous Huxley;
G. M. Trevelyan; O. and S. Sitwell; Middleton Murry. Those are some
of them; and all, with the exception of D. H. Lawrence, came of the
middle class, and were educated at public schools and universities.
There is another fact, equally indisputable: the books that they
wrote were among the best books written between 1910 and 1925. Now
let us ask, is there any connection between those facts? Is there a
connection between the excellence of their work and the fact that
they came of families rich enough to send them to public schools
and universities?</p>

<p>Must we not decide, greatly though those writers differ, and
shallow as we admit our knowledge of influences to be, that there
must be a connection between their education and their work? It
cannot be a mere chance that this minute class of educated people
has produced so much that is good as writing; and that the vast
mass of people without education has produced so little that is
good. It is a fact, however. Take away all that the working class
has given to English literature and that literature would scarcely
suffer; take away all that the educated class has given, and
English literature would scarcely exist. Education must then play a
very important part in a writer's work.</p>

<p>That seems so obvious that it is astonishing how little stress
has been laid upon the writer's education. It is perhaps because a
writer's education is so much less definite than other educations.
Reading, listening, talking, travel, leisure&mdash;many different
things it seems are mixed together. Life and books must be shaken
and taken in the right proportions. A boy brought up alone in a
library turns into a book worm; brought up alone in the fields he
turns into an earth worm. To breed the kind of butterfly a writer
is you must let him sun himself for three or four years at Oxford
or Cambridge&mdash;so it seems. However it is done, it is there
that it is done&mdash;there that he is taught his art. And he has
to be taught his art. Again, is that strange? Nobody thinks it
strange if you say that a painter has to be taught his art; or a
musician; or an architect. Equally a writer has to be taught. For
the art of writing is at least as difficult as the other arts. And
though, perhaps because the education is indefinite, people ignore
this education; if you look closely you will see that almost every
writer who has practised his art successfully had been taught it.
He had been taught it by about eleven years of education&mdash;at
private schools, public schools, and universities. He sits upon a
tower raised above the rest of us; a tower built first on his
parents' station, then on his parents' gold. It is a tower of the
utmost importance; it decides his angle of vision; it affects his
power of communication.</p>

<p>All through the nineteenth century, down to August 1914, that
tower was a steady tower. The writer was scarcely conscious either
of his high station or of his limited vision. Many of them had
sympathy, great sympathy, with other classes; they wished to help
the working class to enjoy the advantages of the tower class; but
they did not wish to destroy the tower, or to descend from
it&mdash;rather to make it accessible to all. Nor had the model,
human life, changed essentially since Trollope looked at it, since
Hardy looked at it: and Henry James, in 1914, was still looking at
it. Further, the tower itself held firm beneath the writer during
all the most impressionable years, when he was learning his art,
and receiving all those complex influences and instructions that
are summed up by the word education. These were conditions that
influenced their work profoundly. For when the crash came in 1914
all those young men, who were to be the representative writers of
their time, had their past, their education, safe behind them, safe
within them. They had known security; they had the memory of a
peaceful boyhood, the knowledge of a settled civilisation. Even
though the war cut into their lives, and ended some of them, they
wrote, and still write, as if the tower were firm beneath them. In
one word, they are aristocrats; the unconscious inheritors of a
great tradition. Put a page of their writing under the
magnifying-glass and you will see, far away in the distance, the
Greeks, the Romans; coming nearer, the Elizabethans; coming nearer
still, Dryden, Swift, Voltaire, Jane Austen, Dickens, Henry James.
Each, however much he differs individually from the others, is a
man of education; a man who has learnt his art.</p>

<p>From that group let us pass to the next&mdash;to the group which
began to write about 1925 and, it may be, came to an end as a group
in 1939. If you read current literary journalism you will be able
to rattle off a string of names&mdash;Day Lewis, Auden, Spender,
Isherwood, Louis MacNeice and so on. They adhere much more closely
than the names of their predecessors. But at first sight there
seems little difference, in station, in education. Mr. Auden in a
poem written to Mr. Isherwood says: Behind us we have stucco
suburbs and expensive educations. They are tower dwellers like
their predecessors, the sons of well-to-do parents, who could
afford to send them to public schools and universities. But what a
difference in the tower itself, in what they saw from the tower!
When they looked at human life what did they see? Everywhere
change; everywhere revolution. In Germany, in Russia, in Italy, in
Spain, all the old hedges were being rooted up; all the old towers
were being thrown to the ground. Other hedges were being planted;
other towers were being raised. There was communism in one country;
in another fascism. The whole of civilisation, of society, was
changing. There was, it is true, neither war nor revolution in
England itself. All those writers had time to write many books
before 1939. But even in England towers that were built of gold and
stucco were no longer steady towers. They were leaning towers. The
books were written under the influence of change, under the threat
of war. That perhaps is why the names adhere so closely; there was
one influence that affected them all and made them, more than their
predecessors, into groups. And that influence, let us remember, may
well have excluded from that string of names the poets whom
posterity will value most highly, either because they could not
fall into step, as leaders or as followers, or because the
influence was adverse to poetry, and until that influence relaxed,
they could not write. But the tendency that makes it possible for
us to group the names of these writers together, and gives their
work a common likeness, was the tendency of the tower they sat
on&mdash;the tower of middle-class birth and expensive
education&mdash;to lean.</p>

<p>Let us imagine, to bring this home to us, that we are actually
upon a leaning tower and note our sensations. Let us see whether
they correspond to the tendencies we observe in those poems, plays,
and novels. Directly we feel that a tower leans we become acutely
conscious that we are upon a tower. All those writers too are
acutely tower conscious; conscious of their middle-class birth; of
their expensive educations. Then when we come to the top of the
tower how strange the view looks&mdash;not altogether upside down,
but slanting, sidelong. That too is characteristic of the
leaning-tower writers; they do not look any class straight in the
face; they look either up, or down, or sidelong. There is no class
so settled that they can explore it unconsciously. That perhaps is
why they create no characters. Then what do we feel next, raised in
imagination on top of the tower? First discomfort; next self-pity
for that discomfort; which pity soon turns to anger&mdash;to anger
against the builder, against society, for making us uncomfortable.
Those too seem to be tendencies of the leaning-tower writers.
Discomfort; pity for themselves; anger against society. And
yet&mdash;here is another tendency&mdash;how can you altogether
abuse a society that is giving you, after all, a very fine view and
some sort of security? You cannot abuse that society
whole-heartedly while you continue to profit by that society. And
so very naturally you abuse society in the person of some retired
admiral or spinster or armament manufacturer; and by abusing them
hope to escape whipping yourself. The bleat of the scapegoat sounds
loud in their work, and the whimper of the schoolboy crying
"Please, Sir, it was the other fellow, not me". Anger; pity;
scapegoat beating; excuse finding&mdash;these are all very natural
tendencies; if we were in their position we should tend to do the
same. But we are not in their position; we have not had eleven
years of expensive education. We have only been climbing an
imaginary tower. We can cease to imagine. We can come down.</p>

<p>But they cannot. They cannot throw away their education; they
cannot throw away their upbringing. Eleven years at school and
college have been stamped upon them indelibly. And then, to their
credit but to their confusion, the leaning tower not only leant in
the thirties, but it leant more and more to the left. Do you
remember what Mr. MacCarthy said about his own group at the
university in 1914? "We were not very much interested in
politics...philosophy was more interesting to us than public
causes"? That shows that his tower leant neither to the right nor
to the left. But in too it was impossible&mdash;if you were young,
sensitive, imaginative&mdash;not to be interested in politics; not
to find public causes of much more pressing interest than
philosophy. In 1930 young men at college were forced to be aware of
what was happening in Russia; in Germany; in Italy; in Spain. They
could not go on discussing aesthetic emotions and personal
relations. They could not confine their reading to the poets; they
had to read the politicians. They read Marx. They became
communists; they became antifascists. The tower they realised was
founded upon injustice and tyranny; it was wrong for a small class
to possess an education that other people paid for; wrong to stand
upon the gold that a bourgeois father had made from his bourgeois
profession. It was wrong; yet how could they make it right? Their
education could not be thrown away; as for their capital&mdash;did
Dickens, did Tolstoy ever throw away their capital? Did D. H.
Lawrence, a miner's son, continue to live like a mine? No; for it
is death for a writer to throw away his capital; to be forced to
earn his living in a mine or a factory. And thus, trapped by their
education, pinned down by their capital, they remained on top of
their leaning tower, and their state of mind as we see it reflected
in their poems and plays and novels is full of discord and
bitterness, full of confusion and of compromise.</p>

<p>These tendencies are better illustrated by quotation than by
analysis. There is a poem by one of those writers, Louis MacNeice,
called <i>Autumn Journal.</i> It is dated March 1939. It is feeble
as poetry, but interesting as autobiography. He begins of course
with a snipe at the scapegoat&mdash;the bourgeois, middle-class
family from which he sprang. The retired admirals, the retired
generals, and the spinster lady have breakfasted off bacon and eggs
served on a silver dish, he tells us. He sketches that family as if
it were already a little remote and more than a little ridiculous.
But they could afford to send him to Marlborough and then to
Merton, Oxford. This is what he learnt at Oxford:</p>

<blockquote><i>We learned that a gentleman never misplaces his
accents,<br>
That nobody knows how to speak, much less how to write English who
has not hob-nobbed with the great-grandparents of English.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides that he learnt at Oxford Latin and Greek; and
philosophy, logic, and metaphysics:</p>

<blockquote><i>Oxford</i> (he says) <i>crowded the mantelpiece with
gods&mdash;<br>
Scaliger, Heinsius, Dindorf, Bentley, Wilamowitz.</i></blockquote>

<p>It was at Oxford that the tower began to lean. He felt that he
was living under a system&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><i>That gives the few at fancy prices their fancy
lives<br>
While ninety-nine in the hundred who never attend the banquet<br>
Must wash the grease of ages of the knives.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>But at the same time, an Oxford education had made him
fastidious:</p>

<blockquote><i>It is so hard to imagine<br>
A world where the many would have their chance without<br>
A fall in the standard of intellectual living<br>
And nothing left that the highbrow cares about.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>At Oxford he got his honours degree; and that degree&mdash;in
humane letters&mdash;put him in the way of a "cushy
job"&mdash;seven hundred a year, to be precise, and several rooms
of his own.</p>

<blockquote><i>If it were not for Lit. Hum. I might be climbing<br>
A ladder with a hod,<br>
And seven hundred a year<br>
Will pay the rent and the gas and the phone and the
grocer&mdash;</i>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet, again, doubts break in; the "cushy job" of teaching
more Latin and Greek to more undergraduates does not satisfy
him&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><i>...the so-called humane studies<br>
May lead to cushy jobs<br>
But leave the men who land them spiritually bankrupt,<br>
Intellectual snobs.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>And what is worse, that education and that cushy job cut one
off, he complains, from the common life of one's kind.</p>

<blockquote><i>All that I would like to be is human, having a
share<br>
In a civilised, articulate and well-adjusted<br>
Community where the mind is given its due<br>
But the body is not distrusted.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore in order to bring about that well-adjusted community
he must turn from literature to politics, remembering, he says,</p>

<blockquote><i>Remembering that those who by their habit<br>
Hate politics, can no longer keep their private<br>
Values unless they open the public gate<br>
To a better political system.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in one way or another, he takes part in politics, and
finally he ends:</p>

<blockquote><i>What is it we want really?<br>
For what end and how?<br>
If it is something feasible, obtainable,<br>
Let us dream it now,<br>
And pray for a possible land<br>
Not of sleep-walkers, not of angry puppets,<br>
But where both heart and brain can understand<br>
The movements of our fellows,<br>
Where life is a choice of instruments and none<br>
Is debarred his natural music...<br>
Where the individual, no longer squandered<br>
In self-assertion, works with the rest...</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Those quotations give a fair description of the influences that
have told upon the leaning-tower group. Others could easily be
discovered. The influence of the films explains the lack of
transitions in their work and the violently opposed contrasts. The
influence of poets like Mr. Yeats and Mr. Eliot explains the
obscurity. They took over from the elder poets a technique which,
after many years of experiment, those poets used skilfully, and
used it clumsily and often inappropriately. But we have time only
to point to the most obvious influences; and these can be summed up
as Leaning Tower Influences. If you think of them, that is, as
people trapped on a leaning tower from which they cannot descend,
much that is puzzling in their work is easier to understand It
explains the violence of their attack upon bourgeois society and
also its half-heartedness. They are profiting by a society which
they abuse. They are flogging a dead or dying horse because a
living horse, if flogged, would kick them off its back. It explains
the destructiveness of their work; and also its emptiness. They can
destroy bourgeois society, in part at least; but what have they put
in its place? How can a Writer who has no first-hand experience of
a towerless, of a classless society create that society? Yet as Mr.
MacNeice bears witness, they feel compelled to preach, if not by
their living, at least by their writing, the creation of a society
in which every one is equal and every one is free. It explains the
pedagogic, the didactic, the loud speaker strain that dominates
their poetry. They must teach; they must preach. Everything is a
duty&mdash;even love. Listen to Mr. Day Lewis ingeminating love.
"Mr. Spender," he says, "speaking from the living unit of himself
and his friends appeals for the contraction of the social group to
a size at which human contact may again be established and demands
the destruction of all impediments to love. Listen." And we listen
to this:</p>

<blockquote><i>We have come at last to a country<br>
Where light, like shine from snow, strikes all faces.<br>
Here you may wonder<br>
How it was that works, money, interest, building could ever<br>
Hide the palpable and obvious love of man for man.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>We listen to oratory, not poetry. It is necessary, in order to
feel the emotion of those lines, that other people should be
listening too. We are in a group, in a class-room as we listen.</p>

<p>Listen now to Wordsworth:</p>

<blockquote><i>Lover had he known in huts where poor men dwell,<br>
His daily teachers had been woods and rills,<br>
The silence that is in the starry sky,<br>
The sleep that is among the lonely hills.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>We listen to that when we are alone. We remember that in
solitude. Is that the difference between politician's poetry and
poet's poetry? We listen to the one in company; to the other when
we are alone? But the poet in the thirties was forced to be a
politician. That explains why the artist in the thirties was forced
to be a scapegoat. If politics were "real", the ivory tower was an
escape from "reality". That explains the curious, bastard language
in which so much of this leaning-tower prose and poetry is written.
It is not the rich speech of the aristocrat: it is not the racy
speech of the peasant. It is betwixt and between. The poet is a
dweller in two worlds, one dying, the other struggling to be born.
And so we come to what is perhaps the most marked tendency of
leaning-tower literature&mdash;the desire to be whole; to be human.
"All that I would like to be is human"&mdash;that cry rings through
their books&mdash;the longing to be closer to their kind, to write
the common speech of their kind, to share the emotions of their
kind, no longer to be isolated and exalted in solitary state upon
their tower, but to be down on the ground with the mass of human
kind.</p>

<p>These then, briefly and from a certain angle, are some of the
tendencies of the modern writer who is seated upon a leaning tower.
No other generation has been exposed to them. It may be that none
has had such an appallingly difficult task. Who can wonder if they
have been incapable of giving us great poems, great plays, great
novels? They had nothing settled to look at; nothing peaceful to
remember; nothing certain to come. During all the most
impressionable years of their lives they were stung into
consciousness&mdash;into self-consciousness, into
class-consciousness, into the consciousness of things changing, of
things falling, of death perhaps about to come. There was no
tranquillity in which they could recollect. The inner mind was
paralysed because the surface mind was always hard at work.</p>

<p>Yet if they have lacked the creative power of the poet and the
novelist, the power&mdash;does it come from a fusion of the two
minds, the upper and the under?&mdash;that creates characters that
live, poems that we all remember, they have had a power which, if
literature continues, may prove to be of great value in the future.
They have been great egotists. That too was forced upon them by
their circumstances. When everything is rocking round one, the only
person who remains comparatively stable is oneself. When all faces
are changing and obscured, the only face one can see clearly is
one's own. So they wrote about themselves&mdash;in their plays, in
their poems, in their novels. No other ten years can have produced
so much autobiography as the ten years between 1930 and 1940. No
one, whatever his class or his obscurity, seems to have reached the
age of thirty without writing his autobiography. But the
leaning-tower writers wrote about themselves honestly, therefore
creatively. They told the unpleasant truths, not only the
flattering truths. That is why their autobiography is so much
better than their fiction or their poetry. Consider how difficult
it is to tell the truth about oneself&mdash;the unpleasant truth;
to admit that one is petty, vain, mean, frustrated, tortured,
unfaithful, and unsuccessful. The nineteenth-century writers never
told that kind of truth, and that is why so much of the
nineteenth-century writing is worthless; why, for all their genius,
Dickens and Thackeray seem so often to write about dolls and
puppets, not about full-grown men and women; why they are forced to
evade the main themes and make do with diversions instead. If you
do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other
people. As the nineteenth century wore on, the writers knew that
they were crippling themselves, diminishing their material,
falsifying their object. "We are condemned", Stevenson wrote, "to
avoid half the life that passes us by. What books Dickens could
have written had he been permitted! Think of Thackeray as
unfettered as Flaubert or Balzac! What books I might have written
myself? But they give us a little box of toys and say to us 'You
mustn't play with anything but these'!" Stevenson blamed
society&mdash;bourgeois society was his scapegoat too. Why did he
not blame himself? Why did he consent to go on playing with his
little box of toys?</p>

<p>The leaning-tower writer has had the courage, at any rate, to
throw that little box of toys out of the window. He has had the
courage to tell the truth, the unpleasant truth, about himself.
That is the first step towards telling the truth about other
people. By analysing themselves honestly, with help from Dr. Freud,
these writers have done a great deal to free us from
nineteenth-century suppressions. The writers of the next generation
may inherit from them a whole state of mind, a mind no longer
crippled, evasive, divided. They may inherit that unconsciousness
which, as we guessed&mdash;it is only a guess&mdash;at the
beginning of this paper, is necessary if writers are to get beneath
the surface, and to write something that people remember when they
are alone. For that great gift of unconsciousness the next
generation will have to thank the creative and honest egotism of
the leaning-tower group.</p>

<p>The next generation&mdash;there will be a next generation, in
spite of this war and whatever it brings. Have we time then for a
rapid glance, for a hurried guess at the next generation? The next
generation will be, when peace comes, a post-war generation too.
Must it too be a leaning-tower generation&mdash;an oblique,
sidelong, squinting, self-conscious generation with a foot in two
worlds? Or will there be no more towers and no more classes and
shall we stand, without hedges between us, on the common
ground?</p>

<p>There are two reasons which lead us to think, perhaps to hope,
that the world after the war will be a world without classes or
towers. Every politician who has made a speech since September 1939
has ended with a peroration in which he has said that we are not
fighting this war for conquest; but to bring about a new order in
Europe. In that order, they tell us, we are all to have equal
opportunities, equal chances of developing whatever gifts we may
possess. That is one reason why, if they mean what they say, and
can effect it, classes and towers will disappear. The other reason
is given by the income tax. The income tax is already doing in its
own way what the politicians are hoping to do in theirs. The income
tax is saying to middle-class parents: You cannot afford to send
your sons to public schools any longer; you must send them to the
elementary schools. One of these parents wrote to the <i>New
Statesman</i> a week or two ago. Her little boy, who was to have
gone to Winchester, had been taken away from his elementary school
and sent to the village school. "He has never been happier in his
life", she wrote. "The question of class does not arise; he is
merely interested to find how many different kinds of people there
are in the world..." And she is only paying twopence-halfpenny a
week for that happiness and instruction instead of 35 guineas a
term and extras. If the pressure of the income tax continues,
classes will disappear. There will be no more upper classes; middle
classes; lower classes. All classes will be merged in one class.
How will that change affect the writer who sits at his desk looking
at human life? It will not be divided by hedges any more. Very
likely that will be the end of the novel, as we know it.
Literature, as we know it, is always ending, and beginning again.
Remove the hedges from Jane Austen's world, from Trollope's world,
and how much of their comedy and tragedy would remain? We shall
regret our Jane Austens and our Trollopes; they gave us comedy,
tragedy, and beauty. But much of that old-class literature was very
petty; very false; very dull. Much is already unreadable. The novel
of a classless and towerless world should be a better novel than
the old novel. The novelist will have more interesting people to
describe&mdash;people who have had a chance to develop their
humour, their gifts, their tastes; real people, not people cramped
and squashed into featureless masses by hedges. The poet's gain is
less obvious; for he has been less under the dominion of hedges.
But he should gain words; when we have pooled all the different
dialects, the clipped and cabined vocabulary which is all that he
uses now should be enriched. Further, there might then be a common
belief which he could accept, and thus shift from his shoulders the
burden of didacticism, of propaganda. These then are a few reasons,
hastily snatched, why we can look forward hopefully to a stronger,
a more varied literature in the classless and towerless society of
the future.</p>

<p>But it is in the future; and there is a deep gulf to be bridged
between the dying world and the world that is struggling to be
born. For there are still two worlds, two separate worlds. "I
want", said the mother who wrote to the paper the other day about
her boy, "the best of both worlds for my son." She wanted, that is,
the village school, where he learnt to mix with the living; and the
other school&mdash;Winchester it was&mdash;where he mixed with the
dead. "Is he to continue", she asked, "under the system of free
national education, or shall he go on&mdash;or should I say
back&mdash;to the old public-school system which really is so very,
very private?" She wanted the new world and the old world to unite,
the world of the present and the world of the past.</p>

<p>But there is still a gulf between them, a dangerous gulf, in
which, possibly, literature may crash and come to grief. It is easy
to see that gulf; it is easy to lay the blame for it upon England.
England has crammed a small aristocratic class with Latin and Greek
and logic and metaphysics and mathematics until they cry out like
the young men on the leaning tower, "All that I would like to be is
human". She has left the other class, the immense class to which
almost all of us must belong, to pick up what we can in village
schools; in factories; in workshops; behind counters; and at home.
When one thinks of that criminal injustice one is tempted to say
England deserves to have no literature. She deserves to have
nothing but detective stories, patriotic songs, and leading
articles for generals, admirals, and business men to read
themselves to sleep with when they are tired of winning battles and
making money. But let us not be unfair; let us avoid if we can
joining the embittered and futile tribe of scapegoat hunters. For
some years now England has been making an effort&mdash;at
last&mdash;to bridge the gulf between the two worlds. Here is one
proof of that effort&mdash;this book. This book was not bought; it
was not hired. It was borrowed from a public library. England lent
it to a common reader, saying "It is time that even you, whom I
have shut out from all my universities for centuries, should learn
to read your mother tongue. I will help you." If England is going
to help us, we must help her. But how? Look at what is written in
the book she has lent us. "Readers are requested to point out any
defects that they may observe to the local librarian." That is
England's way of saying: "If I lend you books, I expect you to make
yourselves critics".</p>

<p>We can help England very greatly to bridge the gulf between the
two worlds if we borrow the books she lends us and if we read them
critically. We have got to teach ourselves to understand
literature. Money is no longer going to do our thinking for us.
Wealth will no longer decide who shall be taught and who not. In
future it is we who shall decide whom to send to public schools and
universities; how they shall be taught; and whether what they write
justifies their exemption from other work. In order to do that we
must teach ourselves to distinguish&mdash;which is the book that is
going to pay dividends of pleasure for ever; which is the book that
will pay not a penny in two years' time? Try it for yourselves on
new books as they come out; decide which are the lasting, which are
the perishing. That is very difficult. Also we must become critics
because in future we are not going to leave writing to be done for
us by a small class of well-to-do young men who have only a pinch,
a thimbleful of experience to give us. We are going to add our own
experience, to make our own contribution. That is even more
difficult. For that too we need to be critics. A writer, more than
any other artist, needs to be a critic because words are so common,
so familiar, that he must sieve them and sift them if they are to
become enduring. Write daily; write freely; but let us always
compare what we have written with what the great writers have
written. It is humiliating, but it is essential. If we are going to
preserve and to create, that is the only way. And we are going to
do both. We need not wait till the end of the war. We can begin
now. We can begin, practically and prosaically, by borrowing books
from public libraries; by reading omnivorously, simultaneously,
poems, plays, novels, histories, biographies, the old and the new.
We must sample before we can select. It never does to be a nice
feeder; each of us has an appetite that must find for itself the
food that nourishes it. Nor let us shy away from the kings because
we are commoners. That is a fatal crime in the eyes of Aeschylus,
Shakespeare, Virgil, and Dante, who, if they could speak&mdash;and
after all they can&mdash;would say, "Don't leave me to the wigged
and gowned. Read me, read me for yourselves." They do not mind if
we get our accents wrong, or have to read with a crib in front of
us. Of course&mdash;are we not commoners, outsiders?&mdash;we shall
trample many flowers and bruise much ancient grass. But let us bear
in mind a piece of advice that an eminent Victorian who was also an
eminent pedestrian once gave to walkers: "Whenever you see a board
up with 'Trespassers will be prosecuted', trespass at once."</p>

<p>Let us trespass at once. Literature is no one's private ground;
literature is common ground. It is not cut up into nations; there
are no wars there. Let us trespass freely and fearlessly and find
our own way for ourselves. It is thus that English literature will
survive this war and cross the gulf&mdash;if commoners and
outsiders like ourselves make that country our own country, if we
teach ourselves how to read and to write, how to preserve, and how
to create.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>ON RE-READING NOVELS</h2>

<p>So there are to be new editions of Jane Austen and the
Bront&euml;s and George Meredith. Left in trains, forgotten in
lodging-houses, thumbed and tattered to destruction, the old ones
have served their day, and for the new-comers in their new houses
there are to be new editions and new readings and new friends. It
speaks very well for the Georgians. It is still more to the credit
of the Victorians. In spite of the mischief-makers, the
grandchildren, it seems, get along very nicely with the
grandparents; and the sight of their concord points inevitably to
the later breach between the generations, a breach more complete
than the other, and perhaps more momentous. The failure of the
Edwardians, comparative yet disastrous&mdash;that is a question
which waits to be discussed. How the year 1860 was a year of empty
cradles; how the reign of Edward the Seventh was barren of poet,
novelist, or critic; how it followed that the Georgians read
Russian novels in translations; how they benefited and suffered;
how different a story we might have told to-day had there been
living heroes to worship and destroy&mdash;all this we find
significant in view of the new editions of the old books. The
Georgians, it seems, are in the odd predicament of turning for
solace and guidance not to their parents who are alive, but to
their grandparents who are dead. And so, as likely as not, we shall
be faced one of these days by a young man reading Meredith for the
first time. But before, inspired by his example, we risk the
dangerous experiment of reading <i>Harry Richmond</i> for a second
time, let us consider a few of the questions which the prospect of
reading a long Victorian novel at once arouses in us.</p>

<p>First, there is the boredom of it. The national habit of reading
has been formed by the drama, and the drama has always recognised
the fact that human beings cannot sit for more than five hours at a
stretch in front of a stage. Read <i>Harry Richmond</i> for five
hours at a stretch and we shall only have broken off a fragment.
Days may pass before we can add to it; meanwhile the plan is lost;
the book pours to waste; we blame ourselves; we abuse the author;
nothing is more exasperating and dispiriting. That is the first
obstacle to be overcome. Next, we cannot doubt that we are by
temperament and tradition poetic. There still lingers among us the
belief that poetry is the senior branch of the service. If we have
an hour to spend, we feel that we lay it out to better advantage
with Keats than with Macaulay. Novels, however, besides being so
long and so badly written, are all about the old familiar things;
what we do, week in, week out, between breakfast and bedtime; they
are about life, and one has life enough on one's hands already
without living it all over again in prose.</p>

<p>That is another obstacle. Yet these stock complaints which we
begin to hear and, perhaps, to utter (as we get on in life) lose
nothing of their acrimony if with the same breath we have to admit
that we owe more to Tolstoy, Flaubert, and Hardy than we can
measure; that if we wish to recall our happier hours, they would be
those Conrad has given us and Henry James; and that to have seen a
young man bolting Meredith whole recalls the pleasure of so many
first readings that we are even ready to venture a second. The
question is whether, if we venture ourselves a second time with
<i>Vanity Fair,</i> the Copperfields, the Richmonds, we shall be
able to find some other form of pleasure to take the place of that
careless rapture which floated us along so triumphantly in the
first instance. The pleasure we shall now look for will lie not so
obviously on the surface; and we shall find ourselves hard pressed
to make out what is the lasting quality, if such there be, which
justifies these long books about modern life in prose.</p>

<p>Some months ago Mr. Percy Lubbock applied himself to answer some
of these questions in <i>The Craft of Fiction,</i> a book which is
likely to have much influence upon readers and may perhaps
eventually reach the critics and the writers. The subject is vast
and the book short; but it will be our fault, not Mr. Lubbock's, if
we talk as vaguely about novels in the future as we have done in
the past. For example, do we say that we cannot read <i>Harry
Richmond</i> twice? We are led by Mr. Lubbock to suspect that it
was our first reading that was to blame. A strong but vague
emotion, two or three characters, half a dozen scattered
scenes&mdash;if that is all that <i>Harry Richmond</i> recalls to
us, the fault lies perhaps not with Meredith, but with ourselves.
Did we read the book as he meant it to be read, or did we not
reduce it to chaos through our own incompetency? Novels, above all
other books, we are reminded, bristle with temptations. We identify
ourselves with this person or with that. We fasten upon the
character or the scene which is congenial. We swing our
imaginations capriciously from spot to spot. We compare the world
of fiction with the real world and judge it by the same standards.
Undoubtedly we do all this and easily find excuses for so doing.
"But meanwhile the book, the thing he made, lies imprisoned in the
volume, and our glimpse of it was too fleeting, it seems, to leave
us with a lasting knowledge of its form." That is the point. There
is something lasting that we can know, something solid that we can
lay hands .on. There is, Mr. Lubbock argues, such a thing as the
book itself. To perceive this we should read at arm's length from
the distractions we have named. We must receive impressions but we
must relate them to each other as the author intended. And it is
when we have shaped our impressions as the author intended that we
are then in a position to perceive the form itself, and it is this
which endures, however mood or fashion may change. In Mr. Lubbock's
own words:</p>

<blockquote>But with the book in this condition of a defined shape,
firm of outline, its form shows for what it is indeed&mdash;not an
attribute, one of many and possibly not the most important, but the
book itself, as the form of the statue is the statue
itself.</blockquote>

<p>Now, as Mr. Lubbock laments, the criticism of fiction is in its
infancy, and its language, though not all of one syllable, is baby
language. This word "form", of course, comes from the visual arts,
and for our part we wish that he could have seen his way to do
without it. It is confusing. The form of the novel differs from the
dramatic form&mdash;that is true; we can, if we choose, say that we
see the difference in our mind's eyes. But can we see that the form
of <i>The Egoist</i> differs from the form of <i>Vanity Fair?</i>
We do not raise the question in order to stickle for accuracy where
most words are provisional, many metaphorical, and some on trial
for the first time. The question is not one of words only. It goes
deeper than that, into the very process of reading itself. Here we
have Mr. Lubbock telling us that the book itself is equivalent to
its form, and seeking with admirable subtlety and lucidity to trace
out those methods by which novelists build up the final and
enduring structure of their books. The very patness with which the
image comes to the pen makes us suspect that it fits a little
loosely. And in these circumstances it is best to shake oneself
free from images and start afresh with a definite subject to work
upon. Let us read a story and set down our impressions as we go
along, and so perhaps discover what it is that bothers us in Mr.
Lubbock's use of the word form. For this purpose there is no more
appropriate author than Flaubert; and, not to strain our space, let
us choose a short story, <i>Un Coeur Simple,</i> for example, for,
as it happens, it is one that we have practically forgotten.</p>

<p>The title gives us our bearings, and the first words direct our
attention to Madame Aubain's faithful servant
F&eacute;licit&eacute;. And now the impressions begin to arrive.
Madame's character; the look of her house; F&eacute;licit&eacute;'s
appearance; her love affair with Th&eacute;odore; Madame's
children; her visitors; the angry bull. We accept them, but we do
not use them. We lay them aside in reserve. Our attention flickers
this way and that, from one to another. Still the impressions
accumulate, and still, almost ignoring their individual quality, we
read on, noting the pity, the irony, hastily observing certain
relations and contrasts, but stressing nothing; always awaiting the
final signal. Suddenly we have it. The mistress and the maid are
turning over the dead child's clothes. "Et des papillons
s'envol&egrave;rent de l'armoire." The mistress kisses the servant
for the first time. "F&eacute;licit&eacute; lui en fut
reconnaissante comme d'un bienfait, et d&eacute;sormais la
ch&eacute;rit avec un d&eacute;vouement bestial et une veneration
religieuse." A sudden intensity of phrase, something which for good
reasons or for bad we feel to be emphatic, startles us into a flash
of understanding. We see now why the story was written. Later in
the same way we are roused by a sentence with a very different
intention: "Et F&eacute;licit&eacute; priait en regardant l'image,
mais de temps a autre se tournait un peu vers l'oiseau."</p>

<p>Again we have the same conviction that we know why the story was
written. And then it is finished. All the observations which we
have put aside now come out and range themselves according to the
directions we have received. Some are relevant; others we can find
no place for. On a second reading we are able to use our
observations from the start, and they are much more precise; but
they are still controlled by these moments of understanding.</p>

<p>Therefore the "book itself" is not form which you see, but
emotion which you feel, and the more intense the writer's feeling
the more exact without slip or chink its expression in words. And
whenever Mr. Lubbock talks of form it is as if something were
interposed between us and the book as we know it. We feel the
presence of an alien substance which requires to be visualised
imposing itself upon emotions which we feel naturally, and name
simply, and range in final order by feeling their right relations
to each other. Thus we have reached our conception of <i>Un Coeur
Simple</i> by working from the emotion outwards, and, the reading
over there is nothing to be seen; there is everything to be felt.
And only when the emotion is feeble and the workmanship excellent
can we separate what is felt from the expression and remark, for
example, what excellence of form <i>Esther Waters</i> possesses in
comparison with <i>Jane Eyre.</i> But consider the <i>Princesse de
Cl&egrave;ves.</i> There is vision and there is expression. The two
blend so perfectly that when Mr. Lubbock asks us to test the form
with our eyes we see nothing at all. But we feel with singular
satisfaction, and since all our feelings are in keeping, they form
a whole which remains in our minds as the book itself. The point is
worth labouring, not simply to substitute one word for another, but
to insist, among all this talk of methods, that both in writing and
in reading it is the emotion that must come first.</p>

<p>Still, we have only made a beginning and a very dangerous one at
that. To snatch an emotion and luxuriate in it and tire of it and
throw it away is as dissipating in literature as in life. Yet if we
wring this pleasure from Flaubert, the most austere of writers,
there is no limit to be put upon the intoxicating effects of
Meredith and Dickens and Dostoevsky and Scott and Charlotte
Bront&euml;. Or rather there is a limit, and we have found it over
and over again in the extremes of satiety and disillusionment. If
we are to read them again we must somehow discriminate. Emotion is
our material; but what value do we put on the emotion? How many
different kinds of emotion are there not in one short story, of how
many qualities, and composed of how many different elements? And
therefore to get our emotion directly and for ourselves is only the
first step. We must go on to test it and riddle it with questions.
If nothing survives, well and good; toss it into the waste-paper
basket and have done with it. If something survives, place it for
ever among the treasures of the universe. Is there not something
beyond emotion, something which though it is inspired by emotion,
tranquillises it, orders it, composes it?&mdash;that which Mr.
Lubbock calls form, which, for simplicity's sake, we will call art?
Can we not discover even in the vortex and whirlpool of Victorian
fiction some constraint which the most ebullient of novelists
forced himself to lay on his material, to reduce it to symmetry? Of
a playwright it would scarcely be necessary to ask so simpleminded
a question. The most casual visitor to the theatre must instantly
perceive how straitly even the crudest drama is shepherded by
conventions; and can bring to mind subtler instances of dramatic
technique which have been in force and have obtained recognition
these many hundred years. In <i>Macbeth,</i> for instance, critic
after critic points out the effect of change from tragedy to comedy
in the scene of the porter; and in the <i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles
we are bidden to remark how the messenger rearranges the story so
as make the discovery of the death of Antigone succeed, instead of
preceding, the funeral.</p>

<p>The drama, however, is hundreds of years in advance of the
novel. We must have known that a novelist, before he can persuade
us that his world is real and his people alive, before he can begin
to move us by the sight of their joys and sufferings, must solve
certain questions and acquire certain skill. But so far we have
swallowed our fiction with our eyes shut. We have not named and
therefore presumably not recognised the simplest of devices by
which every novel has to come into being. We have not taken the
pains to watch our story-teller as he decides which method he will
use; we have not applauded his choice, deplored his lack of
judgment, or followed with delight and interest his use of some
dangerous new device which, for all we know, may do his job to
perfection or blow the whole book to smithereens.</p>

<p>In excuse of our slovenliness it must be admitted, not only that
the methods are unnamed, but that no writer has so many at his
disposal as a novelist. He can put himself at any point of view; he
can to some extent combine several different views. He can appear
in person, like Thackeray; or disappear (never perhaps completely),
like Flaubert. He can state the facts, like Defoe, or give the
thought without the fact, like Henry James. He can sweep the widest
horizons, like Tolstoy, or seize upon one old apple-woman and leer
basket, like Tolstoy again. Where there is every freedom there is
every licence; and the novel, open-armed, free to all comers,
claims more victims than the other forms of literature all put
together. But let us look at the victors. We are tempted, indeed,
to look at them a great deal more closely than space allows. For
they too look different if you watch them at work. There is
Thackeray always taking measures to avoid a scene, and Dickens
(save in <i>David Copperfield)</i> invariably seeking one. There is
Tolstoy dashing into the midst of his story without staying to lay
foundations, and Balzac laying foundations so deep that the story
itself seems never to begin. But we must check the desire to see
where Mr. Lubbock's criticism would lead us in reading particular
books. The general view is more striking and a general view is to
be had.</p>

<p>Let us look, not at each story separately, but at the method of
telling stories as a whole, and its development from generation to
generation. Let us look at it in Richardson's hands, and watch it
changing and developing as Thackeray applies it, and Dickens and
Tolstoy and Meredith and Flaubert and the rest. Then let us see how
in the end Henry James, endowed not with greater genius but with
greater knowledge and craftsmanship, surmounts in <i>The
Ambassadors</i> problems which baffled Richardson in
<i>Clarissa.</i> The view is difficult; the light is bad. At every
angle some one rises to protest that novels are the outburst of
spontaneous inspiration, and that Henry James lost as much by his
devotion to art as he gained. We will not silence that protest, for
it is the voice of an immediate joy in reading without which second
readings would be impossible, for there would be no first. And yet
the conclusion seems to us undeniable, Henry James achieved what
Richardson attempted. "The only real <i>scholar</i> in the art"
beats the amateurs. The latecomer improves upon the pioneers. More
is implied than we can even attempt to state.</p>

<p>For from that vantage ground the art of fiction can be seen, not
clearly indeed, but in a new proportion. We may speak of infancy,
of youth, and of maturity. We may say that Scott is childish and
Flaubert by comparison a grown man. We may go on to say that the
vigour and splendour of youth almost outweigh the more deliberate
virtues of maturity. And then we may pause upon the significance of
"almost", and wonder whether, perhaps, it has not some bearing upon
our reluctance to read the Victorians twice. The gigantic,
sprawling books still seem to reverberate the yawns and
lamentations of their makers. To build a castle, sketch a profile,
fire off a poem, reform a workhouse, or pull down a prison were
occupations more congenial to the writers, or more befitting their
manhood, than to sit chained at a desk scribbling novels for a
simpleminded public. The genius of Victorian fiction seems to be
making its magnificent best of an essentially bad job. But it is
never possible to say of Henry James that he is making the best of
a bad job. In all the long stretch of <i>The Wings of the Dove</i>
and <i>The Ambassadors</i> there is not the hint of a yawn, not a
sign of condescension. The novel is his job. It is the appropriate
form for what he has to say. It wins a beauty from that
fact&mdash;a fine and noble beauty which it has never worn before.
And now at last it has worked itself free and made itself distinct
from its companions. It will not burden itself with other people's
relics. It will choose to say whatever it says best. Flaubert will
take for his subject an old maid and a stuffed parrot. Henry James
will find all he needs round a tea-table in a drawing-room. The
nightingales and roses are banished&mdash;or at least the
nightingale sounds strange against the traffic, and the roses in
the light of the arc lamps are not quite so red. There are new
combinations of old material, and the novel, when it is used for
the sake of its qualities and not for the sake of its defects,
enforces fresh aspects of the perennial story.</p>

<p>Mr. Lubbock prudently carries his survey no further than the
novels of Henry James. But already the years have mounted up. We
may expect the novel to change and develop as it is explored by the
most vigorous minds of a very complex age. What have we not,
indeed, to expect from M. Proust alone? But if he will listen to
Mr. Lubbock, the common reader will refuse to sit any longer
open-mouthed in passive expectation. That is to encourage the
charlatan to shock us and the conjuror to play us tricks.</p>

<p>From all this some conclusions seem to emerge. First, that when
we speak of form we mean that certain emotions have been placed in
the right relations to each other; then that the novelist is able
to dispose these emotions and make them tell by methods which he
inherits, bends to his purpose, models anew, or even invents for
himself. Further, that the reader can detect these devices, and by
so doing will deepen his understanding of the book, while, for the
rest, it may be expected that novels will lose their chaos and
become more and more shapely as the novelist explores and perfects
his technique Finally, perhaps, a charge is laid upon the indolence
and credulity of the reader. Let him press hard upon the novelist's
heels; be quick to follow, quick to understand, and so bring to
bear upon him, even in his study, with reams of paper at his
disposal and publishers eager to accept the bloated productions of
his solitude, the chastening and salutary pressure which a
dramatist has to reckon with, from actors, the spectators, and the
audience trained for generations in the art of going to the
play.</p>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>PERSONALITIES</h2>

<p>"I must have Keats's 'Love Letters' out; though I confess there
is something in the personality of Keats, some sort of
semi-physical aroma wafted from it, which I cannot endure." Such
was the opinion of J. A. Symonds&mdash;one highly unfashionable at
the present moment, and, apart from that circumstance, sufficiently
remarkable in itself. For most people will exclaim that if ever
there was a lovable human being, one whom one would wish to live
with, walk with, go on foreign travels with, it was Keats. He was
rather below middle height; his shoulders were perhaps a little
broad for his size; his eyes glowed with inspiration, but at the
same time expressed the greatest consideration for the feelings of
others. He was vigorous but gentle in all his movements, wearing
neat black shoes, trousers strapped under his insteps, and a coat
that was a little shabby at the seams. His eyes were of a warm yet
searching brown, his hands were broad, and the fingers, unlike
those of most artists, square at the tip. So we could go on making
it up, page after page, whether accurately or not does not for our
present purpose very much matter. For the point we wish to make is
that we are ready supplied with a picture of Keats, and have the
same liking or disliking for him personally that we have for a
friend last seen half an hour ago in the corner of the omnibus that
plies between Holborn and Ludgate Hill. Symonds also received an
impression of extreme vividness, though of a distasteful kind; and
both our impressions, though they affect our feelings for the
poetry, are not directly caused by it, though from what they rise
it would be hard to say. "What a curious thing is that undefinable
flavour of personality," Symonds continues, "suggestion of physical
quality, odour of the man in his unconscious and spontaneous
self-determination, which attracts or repels so powerfully, and is
at the very root of love or dislike." How much of it, we go on to
consider, enters into our feelings for books, and how difficult it
is to be certain that a sense of the physical presence of the
writer, with all which that implies, is not colouring our judgment
of his work. Yet the critics tell us that we should be impersonal
when we write, and therefore impersonal when we read. Perhaps that
is true, and it may be that the greatest passages in literature
have about them something of the impersonality which belongs to our
own emotions at their strongest. The great poet and the lover are
both representative&mdash;in some way anonymous. But these are high
matters. My purpose in dwelling upon this old-fashioned view of
Keats is to confess similar prejudices, partly as an act of
atonement for critical malpractices, and partly in order to see
whether, when they are set out, any sense can be made of them.</p>

<p>It seems to me possible that our attitude to Greek literature,
so queer in its reverence, servility, boredom, querulousness, and
uneasiness, may be due to the fact that we have either no sense or
a very weak one of the personality of the Greek dramatists The
scholars may contradict this. To them Aeschylus may be as real as a
man in an omnibus&mdash;as real as Keats himself; but if that is so
they have been singularly unsuccessful in impressing what they feel
upon the popular imagination. I shut my eyes and summon Aeschylus
before me, and all I see is a venerable old man wrapped in a
blanket sitting on a marble plinth in the sun. An eagle soars high
in the blue. Suddenly from his beak drops a large stone. It catches
Aeschylus on the back of the head, splits his skull open, and that
is all. Similarly with Sappho&mdash;she leapt from a high rock into
the sea. Both anecdotes have something barren and academical about
them, something detached and unilluminating. If we transpose them
to our own day and imagine Tennyson killed on the steps of St.
Paul's by an escaped eagle&mdash;but that is too
fantastic&mdash;let us suppose him run over by a taxi cab; or
George Eliot gathering her skirts about her and leaping from a
cliff, the difference between our attitude to Greek and our
attitude to English literature is at once apparent. If these
catastrophes had happened to our great writers, we should know a
multitude of additional facts&mdash;how it happened, what they
said, wore, and looked like; libraries of comment and psychology
would have been spun from them, and it is through that veil that we
should have been forced to read <i>In Memoriam</i> and
<i>Middlemarch.</i> It cannot be denied that the Greeks have a pull
over us in this as in other respects. The ordinary reader resents
the bareness of their literature. There is nothing in the way of
anecdote to browse upon, nothing handy and personal to help oneself
up by; nothing is left but the literature itself, cut off from us
by time and language, unvulgarised by association, pure from
contamination, but steep and isolated. That is a happy fate for a
literature, if it did not follow that very few people read it and
that those who do become a little priest-like&mdash;inevitably
solitary and pure, reading with more ingenuity but with less
humanity than the ordinary person, and thus leaving out
something&mdash;is it the character, the personality "which is at
the very root of love and dislike"&mdash;which we guess to be
there, but which, save for glimpses, we can never find for
ourselves. We are intolerably exacting. A few patient scholars,
shut up in their studies&mdash;what can they do for us? Perhaps one
must read collectively, learned side by side with the unlearned,
for generations, as we have read Shakespeare, to work through to
that kind of contact.</p>

<p>But directly Shakespeare is mentioned there comes to mind the
popular opinion that he, of all great men, is the least familiar.
Indeed very little is known of him biographically, but it is
evident that most people have precisely that personal feeling for
him which I think they have not for Aeschylus. There is never an
essay upon Hamlet which does not make out with some confidence the
author's view of what he calls "Shakespeare the man". Yet
Shakespeare is a very queer case. Undoubtedly one has the certainty
of knowing him; but it is as fleeting as it is intense. You think
you have fixed him for ever; you look again, and something seems
withheld. All your preconceptions are falsified. What was
Shakespeare may, after all, have been Hamlet; or yourself; or
poetry. These great artists who manage to infuse the whole of
themselves into their works, yet contrive to universalise their
identity so that, though we feel Shakespeare everywhere about, we
cannot catch him at the moment in any particular spot. But it is
simpler to take a much smaller example of the same quality. There
is Jane Austen, thumbed, scored, annotated, magnified, living
almost within the memory of man, and yet as inscrutable in her
small way as Shakespeare in his vast one. She flatters and cajoles
you with the promise of intimacy and then, at the last moment,
there is the same blankness. Are those Jane Austen's eyes or is it
a glass, a mirror, a silver spoon held up in the sun? The people
whom we admire most as writers, then, have something elusive,
enigmatic, impersonal about them. They rise slowly to their
heights; and there they shine. They do not win fame directly, nor
are they exposed to the alternations of praise and blame which rise
from the passions and prejudices of our hearts. In ransacking their
drawers we shall find out little about them. All has been distilled
into their books. The life is thin, modest, colourless, like blue
skimmed milk at the bottom of the jar. It is the imperfect artists
who never manage to say the whole thing in their books who wield
the power of personality over us.</p>

<p>This would be all very well if we could make it square with the
facts, but unfortunately with .Keats as an example of the kind of
writer whose personality affects us we can do no such thing. We
must then go humbly and confess that our likings and dislikings for
authors in their books are as varied and as little accountable as
our likings for people in the flesh. Some show themselves, others
hide themselves, irrespective of their greatness. Here is Jane
Austen, a great writer as we all agree, but, for my own part, I
would rather not find myself alone in the room with her. A sense of
meaning withheld, a smile at something unseen, an atmosphere of
perfect control and courtesy mixed with something finely satirical,
which, were it not directed against things in general rather than
against individuals, would be almost malicious, would, so I feel,
make it alarming to find her at home. On the other hand Charlotte
Bront&euml;, so easily stirred by timely mention of the Duke of
Wellington, so vehement, irrational, and caustic, would be far
easier to know, easier, it seems to me, to love. Her very faults
make a breach through which one steps into intimacy. It is the fact
that one likes people in spite of their faults, and then likes the
faults because they are theirs, that makes one distrust criticism,
and wake, after attempting it, in horror at dead of night. It will
be remembered that Charlotte Bront&euml; made herself ridiculous
when she introduced a Baroness and a footman into the pages of
<i>Jane Eyre.</i> Mrs. Humphry Ward points out the absurdity of the
scene; and into what bottomless pit of iniquity do we not drop Mrs.
Humphry Ward eternally for that very just observation? Again, no
one has written worse English than Mr. Hardy in some of his
novels&mdash;cumbrous, stilted, ugly, and inexpressive&mdash;yes,
but at the same time so strangely expressive of something
attractive to us in Mr. Hardy himself that we would not change it
for the perfection of Sterne at his best. It becomes coloured by
its surroundings; it becomes literature. These are the passages
that admirers tend to imitate; and when untinged by his character
one sees clearly enough how bad they are. But we need not apologise
for injustice to writers of this calibre. It is when we find
ourselves swayed by passion in judging the work of contemporaries
that we must be on our guard. How we, who cannot hold the reader's
attention and maunder on through chapter after chapter of
colourless disquisition, yet contrive to impress him with such a
distaste for our personality that he bristles at the mire mention
of our names, I know not. But it is a fact. The legacy of a
negligible novel is often an oddly vivid sense of the writer's
character, a fancy sketch of his circumstances, a disposition to
like or dislike which works its way into the text and possibly
falsifies its meaning. Or do we only read with all our faculties
when we seize this impression too?</p>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>PICTURES</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1925</i></b>
</p>

<p>Probably some professor has written a book on the subject, but
it has not come our way. "The Loves of the Arts"&mdash;that is more
or less the, title it would bear, and it would be concerned with
the flirtations between music, letters, sculpture, and
architecture, and the effects that the arts have had upon each
other throughout the ages. Pending his inquiry it would seem on the
face of it that literature has always been the most sociable and
the most impressionable of them all; that sculpture influenced
Greek literature, music Elizabethan, architecture the English of
the eighteenth century, and now undoubtedly we are under the
dominion of painting. Were all modern paintings to be destroyed, a
critic of the twenty-fifth century would be able to deduce from the
works of Proust alone the existence of Matisse, C&eacute;zanne,
Derain, and Picasso; he would be able to say with those books
before him that painters of the highest originality and power must
be covering canvas after canvas, squeezing tube after tube, in the
room next door.</p>

<p>Yet it is extremely difficult to put one's finger on the precise
spot where paint makes itself felt in the work of so complete a
writer. In the partial and incomplete writers it is much easier to
detect. The world is full of cripples at the moment, victims of the
art of painting who paint apples, roses, china, pomegranates,
tamarinds, and glass jars as well as words can paint them, which
is, of course, not very well. We can say for certain that a writer
whose writing appeals mainly to the eye is a bad writer; that if in
describing, say, a meeting in a garden he describes roses, lilies,
carnations, and shadows on the grass, so that we can see them, but
allows to be inferred from them ideas, motives, impulses, and
emotions, it is that he is incapable of using his medium for the
purposes for which it was created, and is as a writer a man without
legs.</p>

<p>But it is impossible to bring that charge against Proust, Hardy,
Flaubert, or Conrad. They are using their eyes without in the least
impeding their pens, and they are using them as novelists hive
never used them before. Moors and woods, tropical seas, ships,
harbours, streets, drawing-rooms, flowers, clothes, attitudes,
effects of light and shade&mdash;all this they have given us with
an accuracy and a subtlety that make us exclaim that now at last
writers have begun to use their eyes. Not indeed that any of these
great writers stops for a moment to describe a crystal jar as if it
were an end in itself; the jars on their mantelpieces are always
seen through the eyes of women in the room. The whole scene,
however solidly and pictorially built up, is always dominated by an
emotion which has nothing to do with the eye. But it is the eye
that has fertilised their thought; it is the eye, in Proust above
all, that has come to the help of the other senses, combined with
them, and produced effects of extreme beauty, and of a subtlety
hitherto unknown. Here is a scene in a theatre, for example. We
have to understand the emotions of a young man for a lady in a box
below. With an abundance of images and comparisons we are made to
appreciate the forms, the colours, the very fibre and texture of
the plush seats and the ladies' dresses and the dullness or glow,
sparkle or colour, of the light. At the same time that our senses
drink in all this our minds are tunnelling logically and
intellectually into the obscurity of the young man's emotions,
which as they ramify and modulate and stretch further and further,
at last penetrate too far, peter out into such a shred of meaning
that we can scarcely follow any more, were it not that suddenly in
flash after flash, metaphor after metaphor, the eye lights up that
cave of darkness and we are shown the hard tangible material shapes
of bodiless thoughts hanging like bats in the primeval darkness
where light has never visited them before.</p>

<p>A writer thus has need of a third eye whose function it is to
help out the other senses when they flag. But it is extremely
doubtful whether he learns anything directly from painting. Indeed
it would seem to be true that writers are, of all critics of
painting, the worst&mdash;the most prejudiced, the most distorted
in their judgments; if we accost them in picture galleries, disarm
their suspicions and get them to tell us honestly what it is that
pleases them in pictures, they will confess that it is not the art
of painting in the least. They are not there to understand the
problems of the painter's art. They are after something that may be
helpful to themselves. It is only thus that they can turn those
long galleries from torture chambers of boredom and despair into
smiling avenues, pleasant places filled with birds, sanctuaries
where silence reigns supreme. Free to go their own way, to pick and
choose at their will, they find modern pictures, they say, very
helpful, very stimulating. C&eacute;zanne, for example&mdash;no
painter is more provocative to the literary sense, because his
pictures are so audaciously and provocatively content to be paint
that the very pigment, they say, seems to challenge us, to press on
some nerve, to stimulate, to excite. That picture, for example,
they explain (standing before a rocky landscape all cleft in ridges
of opal colour as if by a giant's hammer, silent, solid, serene),
stirs words in us where we had not thought words to exist; suggests
forms where we had never seen anything but thin air. As we gaze,
words begin to raise their feeble limbs in the pale border-land of
no man's language, to sink down again in despair. We fling them
like nets upon a rocky and inhospitable shore; they fade and
disappear. It is vain, it is futile; but we can never resist the
temptation. The silent painters, C&eacute;zanne and Mr. Sickert,
make fools of us as often as they choose.</p>

<p>But painters lose their power directly they attempt to speak.
They must say what they have to say by shading greens into blues,
posing block upon block. They must weave their spells like mackerel
behind the glass at the aquarium, mutely, mysteriously. Once let
them raise the glass and begin to speak, and the spell is broken. A
story-telling picture is as pathetic and ludicrous as a trick
played by a dog, and we applaud it only because we know that it is
as hard for a painter to tell a story with his brush as it is for a
sheep-dog to balance a biscuit on its nose. Dr. Johnson at the
Mitre is much better told by Boswell; in paint, Keats's nightingale
is dumb; with half a sheet of notepaper we can tell all the stories
of all the pictures in the world.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they admit, moving round the gallery, even when
they do not tempt us to the heroic efforts which have produced so
many abortive monsters, pictures are very pleasant things. There is
a great deal to be learned from them. That picture of a wet marsh
on a blowing day shows us much more clearly than we could see for
ourselves the greens and silvers, the sliding streams, the gusty
willows shivering in the wind, and sets us trying to find phrases
for them, suggests even a figure lying there among the bulrushes,
or coming out of the farmyard gate in top-boots and mackintosh.
That still-life, they proceed, pointing to a jar of red-hot pokers,
is to us what a beefsteak is to an invalid&mdash;an orgy of blood
and nourishment, so starved we are on our diet of thin black print.
We nestle into its colour, feed and fill ourselves with yellow and
red and gold till we drop off, nourished and content. Our sense of
colour seems miraculously sharpened. We carry those roses and
red-hot pokers about with us for days, working them over again in
words. From a portrait, too, we get almost always something worth
having&mdash;somebody's room, nose, or hands, some little effect of
character or circumstance, some knick-knack to put in our pockets
and take away. But again, the portrait painter must not attempt to
speak; he must not say "This is maternity; that intellect", the
utmost he must do is to tap on the wall of the room, or the glass
of the aquarium; he must come very close, but something must always
separate us from him.</p>

<p>There are artists, indeed, who are born tappers; no sooner do we
see a picture of a dancer tying up her shoe by Degas than we
exclaim "How witty!" exactly as if we had read a speech by
Congreve. Degas detaches a scene and comments upon it exactly as a
great comic writer detaches and comments, but silently, without for
a moment infringing the reticences of paint. We laugh, but not with
the muscles that laugh in reading. Mlle Lessore has the same rare
and curious power. How witty her circus horses are, or her groups
standing with field-glasses gazing, or her fiddlers in the pit of
the orchestra! How she quickens our sense of the point and gaiety
of life by tapping on the other side of the wall! Matisse taps,
Derain taps, Mr. Grant taps; Picasso, Sickert, Mrs. Bell, on the
other hand, are all mute as mackerel.</p>

<p>But the writers have said enough. Their consciences are uneasy.
No one knows better than they do, they murmur, that this is not the
way to look at pictures; that they are irresponsible dragon-flies,
mere insects, children wantonly destroying works of art by pulling
petal from petal. In short, they had better be off, for here,
oaring his way through the waters, mooning, abstract,
contemplative, comes a painter, and stuffing their pilferings into
their pockets, out they bolt, lest they should be caught at their
mischief and made to suffer the most extreme of penalties, the most
exquisite of tortures&mdash;to be made to look at pictures with a
painter.</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>HARRIETTE WILSON</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1925</i></b>
</p>

<p>Across the broad continent of a woman's life falls the shadow of
a sword. On one side all is correct, definite, orderly; the paths
are strait, the trees regular, the sun shaded; escorted by
gentlemen, protected by policemen, wedded and buried by clergymen,
she has only to walk demurely from cradle to grave and no one will
touch a hair of her head. But on the other side all is confusion.
Nothing follows a regular course. The paths wind between bogs and
precipices. The trees roar and rock and fall in ruin. There, too,
what strange company is to be met&mdash;in what bewildering
variety! Stone-masons hobnob with Dukes of the blood
royal.&mdash;Mr. Blore treads on the heels of His Grace the Duke of
Argyll. Byron rambles through, the Duke of Wellington marches in
with all his orders on him. For in that strange land gentlemen are
immune; any being of the male sex can cross from sun to shade with
perfect safety. In that strange land money is poured out lavishly;
bank-notes drop on to breakfast plates; pearl rings are found
beneath pillows; champagne flows in fountains; but over it all
broods the fever of a nightmare and the transiency of a dream. The
brilliant fade; the great mysteriously disappear; the diamonds turn
to cinders, and the Queens are left sitting on three-legged stools
shivering in the cold. That great Princess, Harriette Wilson, with
her box at the Opera and the Peerage at her feet, found herself
before she was fifty reduced to solitude, to poverty, to life in
foreign parts, to marriage with a Colonel, to scribbling for cash
whatever she could remember or invent of her past.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it would be a grave mistake to think that Harriette
repented her ways or would have chosen another career had she had
the chance. She was a girl of fifteen when she stepped across the
sword and became, for reasons which she will not specify, the
mistress of the Earl of Craven. A few facts leak out later. She was
educated at a convent and shocked the nuns. Her parents had fifteen
children; their home was "truly uncomfortable"; her father was a
Swiss with a passion for mathematics, always on the point of
solving a problem, and furious if interrupted; while the
unhappiness of her parents' married life had decided Harriette
before she was ten "to live free as air from any restraint but that
of my own conscience". So she stepped across. And at once, the
instant her foot touched those shifting sands, everything wobbled;
her character, her principles, the world itself-all suffered a sea
change. For ever after (it is one of the curiosities of her
memoirs&mdash;one of the obstacles to any certain knowledge of her
character) she is outside the pale of ordinary values and must
protest till she is black in the face, and run up a whole fabric of
lies into the bargain, before she can make good her claim to a
share in the emotions of human kind. Could an abandoned woman love
a sister, could a mere prostitute grieve genuinely for a mother's
death? Mr. Thomas Seccombe, in the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography,</i> had his doubts. Harriette Wilson, he said, described
her sister's death "with an appearance of feeling", whereas to Mr.
Seccombe Lord Hertford's kindness in soothing the same creature's
last hours was indisputably genuine.</p>

<p>Outcast as she was, her position had another and an incongruous
result. She was impelled, though nothing was further from her
liking than serious thought, to speculate a little curiously about
the law of society, to consult, with odd results, the verdict of
"my own conscience". For example, the marriage-law&mdash;was that
as impeccably moral as people made out? "I cannot for the life of
me divest myself of the idea that if all were alike honourable and
true, as I wish to be, it would be unnecessary to bind men and
women together by law, since two persons who may have chosen each
other from affection, possessing heart and honour, could not part,
and where there is neither the one nor the other, even marriage
does not bind. My idea may be wicked or erroneous," she adds
hastily, for what could be more absurd than that Harriette Wilson
should set herself up as a judge of morality&mdash;Harry, as the
gentlemen called her, whose only rule of conduct was "One wants a
little variety in life", who left one man because he bored her, and
another because he drew pictures of cocoa-trees on vellum paper,
and seduced poor young Lord Worcester, and went off to Melton
Mowbray with Mr. Meyler, and, in short, was the mistress of any man
who had money and rank and a person that took her fancy? No,
Harriette was not moral, nor refined, nor, it appears, very
beautiful, but merely a bustling bouncing vivacious creature with
good eyes and dark hair and "the manners of a wild schoolboy", said
Sir Walter Scott, who had dined in her presence. But it cannot be
doubted&mdash;otherwise her triumph is inexplicable&mdash;that
gifts she had, gifts of dash and go and enthusiasm, which still
stir among the dead leaves of her memoirs and impart even to their
rambling verbosity and archness and vulgarity some thrill of that
old impetuosity, some flash of those fine dark eyes, some fling of
those wild schoolboy manners which, when furbished up in plumes and
red plush and diamonds, held our ancestors enthralled.</p>

<p>She was, of course, always falling in love. She saw a stranger
riding with a Newfoundland dog in Knightsbridge and lost her heart
to his "pale expressive beauty" at once. She venerated his
door-knocker even, and when Lord Ponsonby&mdash;for Lord Ponsonby
it was&mdash;deserted her, she flung herself sobbing on a doorstep
in Half Moon Street and was carried, raving and almost dying, back
to bed. Large and voluptuous herself; she loved for the most part
little men with small hands and feet, and, like Mr. Meyler, skins
of remarkable transparency, "churchyard skins", foreboding perhaps
an early death; "yet it would be hard to die, in the bloom of youth
and beauty, beloved by everybody, and with thirty thousand a year".
She loved; too, the Apollo Belvedere, and sat entranced at the
Louvre, exclaiming in ecstasy at the "quivering lips&mdash;the
throat!", till it seemed as if she must share the fate of another
lady who sat by the Apollo, "whom she could not warm, till she went
raving mad, and in that state died". But it is not her loves that
distinguish her; her passions tend to become perfunctory; her young
men with fine skins and large fortunes innumerable; her rhapsodies
and recriminations monotonous. It is when off duty, released from
the necessity of painting the usual picture in the usual way, that
she becomes capable of drawing one of those pictures which only
seem to await some final stroke to become a page in <i>Vanity
Fair</i> or a sketch by Hogarth. All the materials of comedy seem
heaped in disorder before us as she, the most notorious woman in
London, retires to Charmouth to await the return of her lover, Lord
Worcester, from the Spanish wars, trots to church on the arm of the
curate's aged father, or peeps from her window at the rustic
beauties of Lyme Regis tripping down to the sixpenny Assembly Rooms
with "turbans or artificial flowers twined around their wigs" to
dance at five in the evening on the shores of the innocent sea. So
a famous prima donna, hidden behind a curtain in strict incognito,
might listen to country girls singing a rustic ballad with contempt
and amusement, and a dash of envy too, for how simply the good
people accepted her. Harriette could not help reflecting how kindly
they sympathised with her anxiety about her husband at the wars,
and sat up with her to watch for the light of the postwoman's
lanthorn as she came late at night over the hill from Lyme Regis
with letters from Mr. Wilson in Spain! All she could do to show her
gratitude was to pay twice what they asked her, to shower clothes
upon ragged children, to mend a poor countrywoman's roof, and then,
tired of the role of Lady Bountiful, she was off to join Lord
Worcester in Spain.</p>

<p>Now, for a moment, before the old story is resumed, sketched
with a stump of rapid charcoal, springs into existence, to fade for
ever after, the figure of Miss Martha Edmonds, her landlady's
sister. "I am old enough," exclaimed the gallant old maid, "and
thank God I am no beauty...I have never yet been ten miles from my
native place, and I want to see the world." She declared her
intention of escorting Mrs. Wilson to Falmouth; she had her ancient
habit made up for the purpose. Off they started, the old maid and
the famous courtesan, to starve and freeze in an upper room of a
crowded Falmouth inn, the winds being adverse, until in some
mysterious way Mrs. Wilson got into touch first with the Consul and
then with the Captain, who were so hospitable, so generous, so
kind, that Aunt Martha bought a red rose for her cap, drank
champagne, took a hand at cards, and was taught to waltz by Mr.
Brown. Their gaieties were cut short, however; a letter demanded
Mrs. Wilson's instant presence in London, and Aunt Martha,
deposited in Charmouth, could only regret that she had not seen
something of life a little sooner, and declare that there "was a
boldness and grandeur about the views in Cornwall which far
exceeded anything she had seen in Devonshire".</p>

<p>Involved once more with Meylers, Lornes, Lambtons, Berkeleys,
Leicesters, gossiping as usual in her box at the Opera about this
lady and that gentleman, letting young noblemen pull her hair,
tapping late at night at Lord Hertford's little private gate in
Park Lane, Harriette's life wound in and out among the bogs and
precipices of the shadowy underworld which lies on the far side of
the sword. Occasionally the jingling and junketing was interrupted
by a military figure; the great Duke himself, very like a rat
catcher in his red ribbon, marched in; asked questions; left money;
said he remembered her; had dreamed of her in Spain. "I dreamed you
came out on my staff," he said. Or there was Lord Byron sitting
entirely alone, dressed in brown flowing robes at a masquerade,
"bright, severe, beautiful", demanding "in a tone of wild and
thrilling despondency 'Who shall console us for acute bodily
anguish?'" Or again the spangled curtain goes up and we see those
famous entertainers the sisters Wilson sitting at home at their
ease, sparring and squabbling and joking about their lovers; Amy,
who adored black puddings; good-natured Fanny, who doted upon
donkey-riding; foolish Sophie, who was made a Peeress by Lord
Berwick and dropped her sisters; Moll Raffles, Julia, niece to Lord
Carysfort and daughter to a maid of honour with the finest legs in
Europe&mdash;there they sit gossiping profanely and larding their
chatter with quotations from Shakespeare and Sterne. Some died
prematurely; some married and turned virtuous; some became
villains, sorceresses, serpents, and had best be forgotten; while
as for Harriette herself, she was scandalously treated by the
Beauforts, had to retire to France with her Colonel, would continue
to tell the truth about her fine friends so long as they treated
her as they did, and grew, we cannot doubt, into a fat
good-humoured disreputable old woman who never doubted the goodness
of God or denied that the world had treated her well, or regretted,
even when the darkness of obscurity and poverty blotted her
entirely from view, that she had lived her life on the shady side
of the sword.</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>GENIUS</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1926</i></b>
</p>

<p>"Genius," cried Haydon, darting at his canvas after some
momentary rebuff, "Genius is sent into the world not to obey laws,
but to give them!" But he need not have said it. Genius is written
large all over his memoirs. It is genius of a peculiar kind, of
course. It is not the Shakespearean but the Victorian genius, not
the conscious but the unconscious, not the true, but&mdash;let us
pause, however, and read Haydon's diaries with attention (they are
now reprinted, with a brilliant introduction by Mr. Huxley) before
we decide what kind of genius his was. That it was violent in its
symptoms and remorseless in its severity, no one can doubt. Of all
those men and women who have been stricken with genius (and the
number in the British Isles must be great) none suffered more, or
was more terribly its victim than the inspired boy with weak eyes
who should have been a bookseller in his father's shop in Plymouth,
but heard himself summoned to go to London, to be a great painter,
to honour his country, and to "rescue the Art from that stigma of
incapacity which was impressed on it".</p>

<p>He came to London. He made friends with Wilkie. He lived and
painted in one room, and there, night after night, Wilkie, Du
Fresne, Dr. Millingen, McClaggan, Allan ("the celebrated painter")
and Callender all met and drank his good tea out of his large cups,
and argued about art and politics and divinity and medicine and how
Marie Antoinette's head was cut off (Du Fresne said he had been
present and had flung his red cap into the air), while Liz of
Rathbone Place, who loved their talk but was otherwise cold, sided
with one, attacked another, and, was found studying <i>Reid on the
Human Mind</i> "with an expression of profound bewilderment".
"Happy period!", Haydon burst out, "no servants&mdash;no
responsibilities&mdash;reputation on the bud&mdash;ambition
beginning, friends untried", and so things might have gone on had
it not been for the demon which possessed him&mdash;the devil which
made him, even in those early days, indite letters, which Liz
applauded, against the might of the Royal Academy, and vow to bring
about their humiliation and the triumph of High Art by vast
pictures of Dentatus and Macbeth and Solomon, which took months to
paint, filled his living-room with the reek of oil, required that
he should dissect the forequarters of an ass, bring Guardsmen on
their horses into his studio, and run into debt, for, as he soon
found out, "the expenses of a work of High Art in England are
dreadful".</p>

<p>But there was another consequence of his prepossession. High Art
being of necessity large art into the bargain, only the great
nobles could afford it, and in consequence the simple life with Liz
and cups of good tea was abandoned for the life, or at least the
dinner tables, of the Mulgraves and the Beaumonts and any other
lord or lady who could be hypnotised into the belief that it was
their wish to have a vast picture of Achilles in the drawing-room,
and to their credit to have a man of genius talking very loud at
their board. Haydon, rapt in his burning enthusiasm for the Heroic
and for the Elgin Marbles and for himself, took it all seriously.
He entertained fashion all day long. Instead of painting, "I walked
about my, room, looked into the glass, anticipated what the foreign
ambassadors would say," overhead whispers at parties, "he himself
has an antique head," and seriously believed, when the beauties put
up their eyeglasses and lisped their admiration, that his fortune
was made, and that "all the sovereigns of Europe would hail with
delight an English youth who could paint an heroic picture". But he
was disillusioned. The great, he found, care not for art, but for
what people say about pictures. "Dear Lord Mulgrave" lost his faith
in Dentatus when he heard it criticised. Sir George Beaumont
shillied and shallied and said at last that Macbeth was too big and
Lady Beaumont had no room for it, and, "in fact, Sir George was
tired and wanted another extraordinary young man, for Wilkie was an
old story, and I was a nuisance". "And so, artists," he 'concluded,
summing up all that he had borne from his patrons, but letting us
infer how boldly he had corrected them and how terribly he had
bored them, "and so, artists, be humble and discreet!"</p>

<p>He proved the wisdom of his own saying by marrying, in spite of
his debts, a widow with two children, and by having in quick
succession, six more children of his own. With all this weight on
his shoulders he sank steadily more and more deeply into the mud.
For his genius never deserted him. It was always flourishing
irresistible subjects before his eyes. He was always rushing at his
canvas and "rubbing in" the head of Alexander "gloriously", or
dashing off some gigantic group of warriors and lions when his room
was bare of necessities, his furniture pawned, his wife screaming
in childbirth, and the baby (it was a a way they had) sickening of
a mortal illness. Where a smaller man would have been content to
deal with private difficulties, Haydon took upon himself the cares
of the world. He was feverishly interested in politics, in the
Reform Bill, in the Trades Union movement, in the success of the
British arms. Above all, he was the champion of the High Art in
England. He must badger Wellington, Peel, and every Minister in
turn to employ young English painters to decorate Westminster Hall
and the Houses of Parliament. Nor could he let the Royal Academy
sleep in peace. His friends begged him to stop; but no. "The idea
of being a Luther or a John Knox in art got the better of my
reason...I attacked the Academy. I exposed their petty intrigues; I
laid open their ungrateful, cruel, and heartless treatment of
Wilkie. I annihilated Payne Knight's absurd theories against great
works. I proved his ignorance of Pliny", with the result that "I
had brought forty men and all their high connections on my back at
twenty-six years old, and there was nothing left but Victory or
Westminster Abbey. I made up my mind for the conflict, and ordered
at once a larger canvas for another work."</p>

<p>But on the road to Victory and Westminster Abbey lay a more
sordid lodging-house, through which Haydon passed four
times&mdash;the King's Bench Prison. Servants and children, he
noted, became familiar with the signs of an approaching execution.
He himself learned how to pawn and how to plead, how to flatter the
sheriff's officer, how to bombard the great, who were certainly
generous if they were not clever; how to appeal to the hearts of
landlords, whose humanity was extraordinary; but one thing he could
not do: deny the demands of his own genius. Portrait painting was
an obvious resource. But then how odious to paint a little private
individual, a mere Mayor, or Member of Parliament, when one's head
was swarming with Solomons and Jerusalems and Pharaohs and
Crucifixions and Macbeths! He could scarcely bring himself to do
it. One could make them larger than life, it is true, but then the
critics sneered and said that if the ex-Mayor was the size that
Haydon painted him, he must have stuck in the doorway. It was
paltry work. "The trash that one is obliged to talk! The stuff that
one is obliged to copy! The fidgets that are obliged to be borne!
My God!"</p>

<p>The name of God was often on his lips. He was on terms of
cordial intimacy with the deity. He could not believe that one
great spirit could consent to the downfall of another. God and
Napoleon and Nelson and Wellington and Haydon were all of the same
calibre, all in the grand style. His mind harped on these great
names constantly. And as a matter of fact, though poor Mrs. Haydon
would smile when he bade her "trust in God", his trust was often
justified. He left his house in the morning with the children
fighting, with Mary scolding, with no water in the cistern, to
trudge all day from patron to pawn-shop, and came home at night
"tired, croaking, grumbling and muddy", when, just as hope seemed
extinct, a letter arrived; it was from Lord Grey; it contained a
cheque. Once more they were saved.</p>

<p>With it all, he declared, he was a very happy man, pink and
plump, in spite of all his worries, when Wilkie, who led an
abstemious bachelor's life, was cadaverous and plaintive. Now and
again they took the children to the sea or snatched an afternoon in
Kensington Gardens, and if they were in the depths of despair on
Wednesday, likely enough some stroke of fortune would put them in
the seventh heaven by Thursday. He had his friends,
too&mdash;Wordsworth and Scott and Keats and Lamb&mdash;with whom
he supped and he talked. He had, above all, a mind which was for
ever tossing and tumbling like a vigorous dolphin in the seas of
thought. "I never feel alone", he wrote, "with visions of ancient
heroes, pictures of Christ, principles of ancient Art, humorous
subjects, deductions, sarcasms against the Academy, piercing
remembrance of my dear children all crowding upon me, I paint, I
write, conceive, fall asleep...lamenting my mortality at being
fatigued." The power which drove him to these extremities did at
least reward him with some of its delights.</p>

<p>But as the symptoms of inspiration multiply&mdash;this
passionate joy in creation, this conviction of a divine
mission&mdash;one asks oneself what then is false, for falsity
there certainly seems to be. First there is something in the
superabundance of protest, in the sense of persecution, which
rouses suspicion; next these vast pictures of crowds, armies,
raptures, agonies begin, even as he sketches them in words, to scar
and wound our eyes; and finally we catch ourselves thinking, as
some felicity of phrase flashes out or some pose or arrangement
makes its effect, that his genius is a writer's. He should have
held a pen; of all painters, surely he was the best read. "The
truth is I am fonder of books than of anything else on earth", he
wrote. He clung to his Shakespeare and his Homer when his lay
figure had to go to the pawnbroker. There was even one moment when
he doubted his own vocation and accused the sublime art of
hampering his powers. But his instinct to express himself in words
was undeniable. Overworked as he was, he always found time to write
a diary which is in no way perfunctory, but follows with ease and
sinuosity the ins and outs of his life. Phrases form naturally at
the tip of his pen. "He sat and talked easily, lazily, gazing at
the sun with his legs crossed", he says of Chantrey. "Poor fellow,"
he wrote on hearing of the burial of Wilkie at sea, "I wonder what
the fish think of him, with their large glassy eyes in the gurgling
deep." Always his painter's eye lights up his phrases, and scenes
which would have been repulsive in paint shape themselves naturally
and rightly into words. It was some malicious accident that made
him, when he had to choose a medium, pick up a brush when the pen
lay handy.</p>

<p>But if accident it was, his genius was unrelenting. Paint he
must; paint he did. When his cartoons were rejected he learned to
toss off pictures of Napoleon Musing, at the rate of one in two
hours and a half. When the public deserted his last exhibition in
favour of Tom Thumb next door, he darted at another picture,
finished the Saxon Lord, dashed in Alfred, "worked", he declared,
"gloriously". But at last even his prayers sound a little hoarse,
and his protests without conviction. One morning after quoting Lear
and writing out a list of his debts and his thoughts, he put a
pistol to his forehead, gashed a razor across his throat, and
spattered his unfinished picture of Alfred and the first British
Jury with his blood. He was the faithful servant of genius to the
last. If we seek now any relic of all those acres of canvas, those
crowds of heroes, we find clean white walls, people comfortably
dining, and a vague rumour that a big picture did hang here once,
but the management took it away when the place was done up. The
pictures are vanished; Allan, "the celebrated painter", Du Fresne,
who saw Marie Antoinette executed, Millingen, Liz of Rathbone
Place, all are passed away; but still these pages that he scribbled
without thought of Genius or Art or Posterity remain, holding
vividly before us the struggling, greedy life with all its black
smoke and its flame.</p>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>THE ENCHANTED ORGAN</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1924</i></b>
</p>

<p>The enormous respectability of Bloomsbury was broken one fine
morning about 1840 by the sound of an organ and by the sight of a
little girl who had escaped from her nurse and was dancing to the
music. The child was Thackeray's elder daughter, Anne. For the rest
of her long life, through war and peace, calamity and prosperity,
Miss Thackeray, or Mrs. Richmond Ritchie, or Lady Ritchie, was
always escaping from the Victorian gloom and dancing to the strains
of her own enchanted organ. The music, at once so queer and so
sweet, so merry and so plaintive, so dignified and so fantastical,
is to be heard very distinctly on every page of the present
volume.*</p>

<p>[* <i>Letters of Anne Thackeray Ritchie,</i> selected and edited
by her daughter, Hester Ritchie.]</p>

<p>For Lady Ritchie was incapable at any stage of her career of
striking an attitude or hiding a feeling. The guns are firing from
Cremorne for the taking of Sebastopol, and there she sits
scribbling brilliant nonsense in her diary about "matches and fairy
tales". "Brother Tomkins at the Oratory is starving and thrashing
himself because he thinks it is right", and Miss Thackeray is
reading novels on Sunday morning "because I do not think it is
wrong". As for religion and her grandmother's miseries and the
clergyman's exhortations to follow "the one true way", all she
knows is that it is her business to love her father and
grandmother, and for the rest she supposes characteristically "that
everybody is right and nobody knows anything".</p>

<p>Seen through this temperament, at once so buoyant and so keen,
the gloom of that famous age dissolves in an iridescent mist which
lifts entirely to display radiant prospects of glittering spring,
or clings to the monstrous shoulders of its prophets in many-tinted
shreds. There are Mr. FitzGerald and Mr. Spedding coming to dinner
"as kind and queer and melancholy as men could be"; and Mrs. Norton
"looking like a beautiful slow sphinx"; and Arthur Prinsep riding
in Rotten Row with violets in his buttonhole&mdash;"'I like your
violets very much,' said I, and of course they were instantly
presented to me"&mdash;and Carlyle vociferating that a cheesemite
might as well understand a cow as we human mites our maker's
secrets; and George Eliot, with her steady little eyes, enunciating
a prodigious sentence about building one's cottage in a valley, and
the power of influence, and respecting one's work, which breaks off
in the middle; and Herbert Spencer stopping a Beethoven sonata with
"Thank you, I'm getting flushed"; and Ruskin asserting that "if you
can draw a strawberry you can draw anything"; and Mrs. Cameron
paddling about in cold water till two in the morning; and Jowett's
four young men looking at photographs and sipping tumblers of
brandy and water until at last "poor Miss Stephen", who has been
transplanted to an island where "everybody is either a genius, or a
poet, or a painter, or peculiar in some way", ejaculates in
despair, "Is there <i>nobody</i> commonplace?"</p>

<p>"Poor Miss Stephen", bored and bewildered, staying with several
cousins at the hotel, represented presumably the Puritanical
conscience of the nineteenth century when confronted by a group of
people who were obviously happy but not obviously bad. On the next
page, however, Miss Stephen is significantly "strolling about in
the moonlight"; on the next she has deserted her cousins, left the
hotel, and is staying with the Thackerays in the centre of
infection. The most ingrained Philistine could not remain bored,
though bewildered she might be, by Miss Thackeray's charm. For it
was a charm extremely difficult to analyse. She said things that no
human being could possibly mean; yet she meant them. She lost
trains, mixed names, confused numbers, driving up to Town, for
example, precisely a week before she was expected, and making
Charles Darwin laugh&mdash;"I can't for the life of me help
laughing," he apologised. But then, if she had gone on the right
day, poor Mr. Darwin would have been dying. So with her writing,
too. Her novel <i>Angelica</i> "went off suddenly to Australia with
her feet foremost, and the proofs all wrong and end first!!!" But
somehow nobody in Australia found out.</p>

<p>Fortune rewarded the generous trust she put in it. But if her
random ways were charming, who, on the other hand, could be more
practical, or see things, when she liked, precisely as they were?
Old Carlyle was a god on one side of his face but a "cross-grained,
ungrateful, self-absorbed old nutcracker" on the other. Her most
typical, and, indeed, inimitable sentences rope together a handful
of swiftly gathered opposites. To embrace oddities and produce a
charming, laughing harmony from incongruities was her genius in
life and in letters. "I have just ordered", she writes, "two
shillings' worth of poetry for my fisherman...we take little walks
together, and he carries his shrimps and talks quite enchantingly."
She pays the old dropsical woman's fare in the omnibus, and in
return the "nice jolly nun hung with crucifixes" escorts her across
the road. Nun and fisherman and dropsical old woman had never till
that moment, one feels sure, realised their own charm or the gaiety
of existence. She was a mistress of phrases which exalt and define
and set people in the midst of a comedy. With Nature, too, her gift
was equally happy. She would glance out of the window of a Brighton
lodging-house and say: "The sky was like a divine parrot's breast,
just now, with a deep, deep, flapping sea". As life drew on, with
its deaths and its wars, her profound instinct for happiness had to
exert itself to gild those grim faces golden, but it succeeded.
Even Lord Kitchener and Lord Roberts and the South African War
shine transmuted. As for the homelier objects which she preferred,
the birds and the downs and the old charwoman "who has been an old
angel, without wings, alas! and only a bad leg", and the smut-black
chimney-sweeps, who were "probably gods in disguise", they never
cease to the very end to glow and twinkle with merriment in her
pages. For she was no visionary. Her happiness was a domestic
flame, tried by many sorrows. And the music to which she dances,
frail and fantastic, but true and distinct, will sound on outside
our formidable residences when all the brass bands of literature
have (let us hope) blared themselves to perdition.</p>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>TWO WOMEN</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1927</i></b>
</p>

<p>Up to the beginning of the nineteenth century the distinguished
woman had almost invariably been an aristocrat. It was the great
lady who ruled and wrote letters and influenced the course of
politics. From the huge middle class few women rose to eminence,
nor has the drabness of their lot received the attention which has
been bestowed upon the splendours of the great and the miseries of
the poor. There they remain, even in the early part of the
nineteenth century, a vast body, living, marrying, bearing children
in dull obscurity, until at last we begin to wonder whether there
was something in their condition itself&mdash;in the age at which
they married, the number of children they bore, the privacy they
lacked, the incomes they had not, the conventions which stifled
them, and the education they never received&mdash;which so affected
them that, though the middle class is the great reservoir from
which we draw our distinguished men, it has thrown up singularly
few women to set beside them.</p>

<p>The profound interest of Lady Stephen's life of Miss Emily
Davies* lies in the light it throws upon this dark and obscure
chapter of human history. Miss Davies was born in the year 1830, of
middle-class parents who could afford to educate their sons but not
their daughters. Her education was, she supposed, much the same as
that of other clergymen's daughters at that time. "Do they go to
school? No. Do they have governesses at home? No. They have lessons
and get on as they can."</p>

<p>[* <i>Emily Davies and Girton College,</i> by Lady Stephen.]</p>

<p>But if their positive education had stopped at a little Latin, a
little history, a little housework, it would not so much have
mattered. It was what may be called the negative education, that
which decrees not what you may do but what you may not do, that
cramped and stifled. "Probably only women who have laboured under
it can understand the weight of discouragement produced by being
perpetually told that, as women, nothing much is ever expected of
them...Women who have lived in the atmosphere produced by such
teaching know how it stifles and chills; how hard it is to work
courageously through it." Preachers and rulers of both sexes
nevertheless formulated the creed and enforced it vigorously.
Charlotte Yonge wrote: "I have no hesitation in declaring my full
belief in the inferiority of woman, nor that she brought it upon
herself". She reminded her sex of a painful incident with a snake
in a garden which had settled their destiny, Miss Yonge said, for
ever. The mention of Women's Rights made Queen Victoria so furious
that "she cannot contain herself". Mr. Greg, underlining his words,
wrote that "the essentials of a woman's being are <i>that they are
supported by, and they minister to, men</i>". The only other
occupation allowed them, indeed, was to become a governess or a
needlewoman, "and both these employments were naturally
overstocked". If women wanted to paint, there was, up to the year
1858, only one life class in London where they could learn. If they
were musical there was the inevitable piano, but the chief aim was
to produce a brilliant mechanical execution, and Trollope's picture
of four girls all in the same room playing on four pianos, all of
them out of tune, seems to have been, as Trollope's pictures
usually are, based on fact. Writing was the most accessible of the
arts, and write they did, but their books were deeply influenced by
the angle from which they were forced to observe the world. Half
occupied, always interrupted, with much leisure but little time to
themselves and no money of their own, these armies of listless
women were either driven to find solace and occupation in religion,
or, if that failed, they took, as Miss Nightingale said, "to that
perpetual day dreaming which is so dangerous". Some, indeed, envied
the working classes, and Miss Martineau frankly hailed the ruin of
her family with delight. "I, who had been obliged to write before
breakfast, or in some private way, had henceforth liberty to do my
own work in my own way, for we had lost our gentility." But the
time had come when there were occasional exceptions, both among
parents and among daughters. Mr. Leigh Smith, for example, allowed
his daughter Barbara the same income that he gave his sons. She at
once started a school of an advanced character. Miss Garrett became
a doctor because her parents, though shocked and anxious, would be
reconciled if she were a success. Miss Davies had a brother who
sympathised and helped her in her determination to reform the
education of women. With such encouragement the three young women
started in the middle of the nineteenth century to lead the army of
the unemployed in search of work. But the war of one sex upon the
rights and possessions of the other is by no means a
straightforward affair of attack and victory or defeat. Neither the
means nor the end itself is clear-cut and recognised. There is the
very potent weapon, for example, of feminine charm&mdash;what use
were they to make of that? Miss Garrett said she felt "so mean in
trying to come over the doctors by all kinds of little feminine
dodges". Mrs. Gurney admitted the difficulty, but pointed out that
"Miss Marsh's success among the navvies" had been mainly won by
these means, which, for good or bad, were certainly of immense
weight. It was agreed therefore that charm was to be employed. Thus
we have the curious spectacle, at once so diverting and so
humiliating, of grave and busy women doing fancy work and playing
croquet in order that the male eye might be gratified and deceived.
"Three lovely girls" were placed conspicuously in the front row at
a meeting, and Miss Garrett herself sat there looking "exactly like
one of the girls whose instinct it is to do what you tell them".
For the arguments that they had to meet by these devious means were
in themselves extremely indefinite. There was a thing called "the
tender home-bloom of maidenliness" which must not be touched. There
was chastity, of course, and her handmaidens, innocence, sweetness,
unselfishness, sympathy; all of which might suffer if women were
allowed to learn Latin and Greek. The <i>Saturday Review</i> gave
cogent expression to what men feared for women and needed of women
in the year 1864. The idea of submitting young ladies to local
university examinations "almost takes one's breath away", the
writer said. If examined they must be, steps must be taken to see
that "learned men advanced in years" were the examiners, and that
the presumably aged wives of these aged gentlemen should occupy "a
commanding position in the gallery". Even so it would be "next to
impossible to persuade the world that a pretty first-class woman
came by her honours fairly". For the truth was, the reviewer wrote,
that "there is a strong and ineradicable male instinct that a
learned or even an accomplished young woman is the most intolerable
monster in creation". It was against instincts and prejudices such
as these, tough as roots but intangible as sea mist, that Miss
Davies had to fight. Her days passed in a round of the most diverse
occupations. Besides the actual labour of raising money and
fighting prejudice, she had to decide the most delicate moral
questions which, directly victory was within sight, began to be
posed by the students and their parents. A mother, for example,
would only entrust her with her daughter's education on condition
that she should come home "as if nothing had happened," and not
"take to anything eccentric". The students, on the other hand,
bored with watching the Edinburgh express slip a carriage at
Hitchin or rolling the lawn with a heavy iron roller, took to
playing football, and then invited their teachers to see them act
scenes from Shakespeare and Swinburne dressed in men's clothes.
This indeed was a very serious matter; the great George Eliot was
consulted; Mr. Russell Gurney was consulted, and also Mr.
Tomkinson. They decided that it was unwomanly; Hamlet must be
played in a skirt.</p>

<p>Miss Davies herself was decidedly austere. When money for the
college flowed in she refused to spend it on luxuries. She wanted
rooms&mdash;always more and more rooms to house those unhappy girls
dreaming their youth away in indolence or picking up a little
knowledge in the family sitting-room. "Privacy was the one luxury
Miss Davies desired for the student, and in her eyes it was not a
luxury&mdash;she despised luxuries&mdash;but a necessity." But one
room to themselves was enough. She did not believe that they needed
armchairs to sit in or pictures to look at. She herself lived
austerely in lodgings till she was seventy-two, combative,
argumentative, frankly preferring a labour meeting at Venice to the
pictures and the palaces, consumed with an abstract passion for
justice to women which burnt up trivial personalities and made her
a little intolerant of social frivolities. Was it worth while, she
once asked, in her admirable, caustic manner, after meeting Lady
Augusta Stanley, to go among the aristocracy? "I felt directly that
if I went to Lady Stanley's again I must get a new bonnet. And is
it well to spend one's money in bonnets and flys instead of on
instructive books?" she wondered. For Miss Davies perhaps was a
little deficient in feminine charm.</p>

<p>That was a charge that nobody could bring against Lady Augusta
Stanley. No two women could on the surface have less in common.
Lady Augusta, it is true, was no more highly educated in a bookish
sense than the middle-class women whom Miss Davies championed. But
she was the finest flower of the education which for some centuries
the little class of aristocratic women had enjoyed. She had been
trained in her mother's drawing-room in Paris. She had talked to
all the distinguished men and women of her time&mdash;Lamartine,
Merim&eacute;e, Victor Hugo, the Duc de Broglie, Sainte-Beuve,
Renan, Jenny Lind, Turgenev&mdash;everybody came to talk to old
Lady Elgin and to be entertained by her daughters. There she
developed that abounding sensibility, that unquenchable sympathy
which were to be so lavishly drawn upon in after years. For she was
very young when she entered the Duchess of Kent's household. For
fifteen years of her youth she lived there. For fifteen years she
was the life and soul of that "quiet affectionate dull household of
old people at Frogmore and Clarence House". Nothing whatever
happened. They drove out and she thought how charming the village
children looked. They walked and the Duchess picked heather. They
came home and the Duchess was tired. Yet not for a moment, pouring
her heart out in profuse letters to her sisters, does she complain
or wish for any other existence.</p>

<p>Seen through her peculiar magnifying-glass the slightest event
in the life of the Royal Family was either harrowing in the extreme
or beyond words delightful. Prince Arthur was more handsome than
ever. The Princess Helena was so lovely. Princess Ada fell from her
pony. Prince Leo was naughty. The Beloved Duchess wanted a green
umbrella. The measles had come out, but, alas, they threatened to
go in again. One might suppose, to listen to Lady Augusta
exclaiming and protesting in alternate rapture and despair, that to
read aloud to the old Duchess of Kent was the most exciting of
occupations, and that the old lady's rheumatisms and headaches were
catastrophes of the first order. For inevitably the power of
sympathy, when so highly developed and discharged solely upon
personal relations, tends to produce a hothouse atmosphere in which
domestic details assume prodigious proportions and the mind feeds
upon every detail of death and disease with a gluttonous relish.
The space devoted in this volume* to illness and marriage entirely
outweighs any reference to art, literature, or politics. It is all
personal, emotional, and detailed as one of the novels which were
written so inevitably by women.</p>

<p>[* <i>Letters of Lady Augusta Stanley,</i> edited by the Dean of
Windsor and Hector Bolitho.]</p>

<p>It was such a life as this, and such an atmosphere as this, that
Mr. Greg and the <i>Saturday Review</i> and many men, who had
themselves enjoyed the utmost rigours of education, wished to see
preserved. And perhaps there was some excuse for them. It is
difficult to be sure, after all, that a college don is the highest
type of humanity known to us; and there is something in Lady
Augusta's power to magnify the common and illumine the dull which
seems to imply a very arduous education of some sort behind it.
Nevertheless as one studies the lives of the two women side by side
one cannot doubt that Miss Davies got more interest, more pleasure,
and more use out of one month of her life than Lady Augusta out of
a whole year of hers. Some inkling of the fact seems to have
reached Lady Augusta even at Windsor Castle. Perhaps being a woman
of the old type is a little exhausting; perhaps it is not
altogether satisfying. Lady Augusta at any rate seems to have got
wind of other possibilities. She liked the society of literary
people best, she said. "I had always said that I had wished to be a
fellow of a college," she added surprisingly. At any rate she was
one of the fiat to support Miss Davies in her demand for a
University education for women. Did Miss Davies sacrifice her book
and buy her bonnet? Did the two women, so different in every other
way, come together over this&mdash;the education of their sex? It
is tempting to think so, and to imagine sprung from that union of
the middle-class woman and the court lady some astonishing phoenix
of the future who shall combine the new efficiency with the old
amenity, the courage of the indomitable Miss Davies and Lady
Augusta's charm.</p>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>ELLEN TERRY</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in January 1941</i></b>
</p>

<p>When she came on to the stage as Lady Cicely in <i>Captain
Brassbound's Conversion</i>, the stage collapsed like a house of
cards and all the limelights were extinguished. When she spoke it
was as if someone drew a bow over a ripe, richly seasoned 'cello;
it grated, it glowed, and it growled. Then she stopped speaking.
She put on her glasses. She gazed intently at the back of a settee.
She had forgotten her part. But did it matter? Speaking or silent,
she was Lady Cicely&mdash;or was it Ellen Terry? At any rate, she
filled the stage and all the other actors were put out, as electric
lights are put out in the sun.</p>

<p>Yet this pause when she forgot what Lady Cicely said next was
significant. It was a sign not that she was losing her memory and
past her prime, as some said. It was a sign that Lady Cicely was
not a part that suited her. Her son, Gordon Craig, insists that she
only forgot her part when there was something uncongenial in the
words, when some speck of grit had got into the marvellous machine
of her genius. When the part was congenial, when she was
Shakespeare's Portia, Desdemona, Ophelia, every word, every comma
was consumed. Even her eyelashes acted. Her body lost its weight.
Her son, a mere boy, could lift her in his arms. "I am not myself,"
she said. "Something comes upon me...I am always-in-the-air, light
and bodiless." We, who can only remember her as Lady Cicely on the
little stage at the Court Theatre, only remember what, compared
with her Ophelia or her Portia, was as a picture postcard compared
with the great Velasquez in the gallery.</p>

<p>It is the fate of actors to leave only picture postcards behind
them. Every night when the curtain goes down the beautiful coloured
canvas is rubbed out. What remains is at best only a wavering,
insubstantial phantom&mdash;a verbal life on the lips of the
living. Ellen Terry was well aware of it. She tried herself,
overcome by the greatness of Irving as Hamlet and indignant at the
caricatures of his detractors, to describe what she remembered. It
was in vain. She dropped her pen in despair. "Oh God, that I were a
writer!" she cried. "Surely a <i>writer</i> could not string words
together about Henry Irving's Hamlet and say <i>nothing,
nothing."</i> It never struck her, humble as she was, and obsessed
by her lack of book learning, that she was, among other things, a
.writer. It never occurred to her when she wrote her autobiography,
or scribbled page after page to Bernard Shaw late at night, dead
tired after a rehearsal, that she was "writing". The words in her
beautiful rapid hand bubbled off her pen. With dashes and notes of
exclamation she tried to give them the very tone and stress of the
spoken word. It is true, she could not build a house with words,
one room opening out of another, and a staircase connecting the
whole. But whatever she took up became in her warm, sensitive grasp
a tool. If it was a rolling-pin, she made perfect pastry. If it was
a carving knife, perfect slices fell from the leg of mutton. If it
were a pen, words peeled off, some broken, some suspended in
mid-air, but all far more expressive than the tappings of the
professional typewriter.</p>

<p>With her pen then at odds and ends of time she has painted a
self-portrait. It is not an Academy portrait, glazed, framed,
complete. It is rather a bundle of loose leaves upon each of which
she has dashed off a sketch for a portrait&mdash;here a nose, here
an arm, here a foot, and there a mere scribble in the margin. The
sketches done in different moods, from different angles, sometimes
contradict each other. The nose cannot belong to the eyes; the arm
is out of all proportion to the foot. It is difficult to assemble
them. And there are blank pages, too. Some very important features
are left out. There was a self she did not know, a gap she could
not fill. Did she not take Walt Whitman's words for a motto? "Why,
even I myself, I often think, know little or nothing of my real
life. Only a few hints&mdash;a few diffused faint clues and
indirections...I seek...to trace out here."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the first sketch is definite enough. It is the
sketch of her childhood. She was born to the stage. The stage was
her cradle, her nursery. When other little girls were being taught
sums and pot-hooks she was being cuffed and buffeted into the
practice of her profession. Her ears were boxed, her muscles
suppled. All day she was hard at work on the boards. Late at night
when other children were safe in bed she was stumbling along the
dark streets wrapped in her father's cloak. And the dark street
with its curtained windows was nothing but a sham to that little
professional actress, and the rough and tumble life on the boards
was her home, her reality. "It's all such sham there", she
wrote&mdash;meaning by "there" what she called "life lived in
houses"&mdash;"sham&mdash;cold&mdash;hard&mdash;pretending. It's
not sham here in our theatre&mdash;here all is real, warm and
kind&mdash;we live a lovely spiritual life here."</p>

<p>That is the first sketch. But turn to the next page. The child
born to the stage has become a wife. She is married at sixteen to
an elderly famous painter. The theatre has gone; its lights are out
and in its place is a quiet studio in a garden. In its place is a
world full of pictures and "gentle artistic people with quiet
voices and elegant manners". She sits mum in her corner while the
famous elderly people talk over her head in quiet voices. She is
content to wash her husband's brushes; to sit to him; to play her
simple tunes on the piano to him while he paints. In the evening
she wanders over the Downs with the great poet, Tennyson. "I was in
Heaven," she wrote. "I never had one single pang of regret for the
theatre." If only it could have lasted! But somehow&mdash;here a
blank page intervenes&mdash;she was an incongruous element in that
quiet studio. She was too young, too vigorous, too vital, perhaps.
At any rate, the marriage was a failure.</p>

<p>And so, skipping a page or two, we come to the next sketch. She
is a mother now. Two adorable children claim all her devotion. She
is living in the depths of the country, in the heart of
domesticity. She is up at six. She scrubs, she cooks, she sews. She
teaches the children. She harnesses the pony. She fetches the milk.
And again she is perfectly happy. To live with children in a
cottage, driving her little cart about the lanes, going to church
on Sunday in blue and white cotton&mdash;that is the ideal life!
She asks no more than that it shall go on like that for ever and
ever. But one day the wheel comes off the pony cart. Huntsmen in
pink leap over the hedge. One of them dismounts and offers help. He
looks at the girl in a blue frock and exclaims; "Good God! It's
Nelly!" She looks at the huntsman in pink and cries, "Charles
Reade!" And so, all in a jiffy, back she goes to the stage, and to
forty pounds a week. For&mdash;that is the reason she
gives&mdash;the bailiffs are in the house. She must make money.</p>

<p>At this point a very blank page confronts us. There is a gulf
which we can only cross at a venture. Two sketches face each other;
Ellen Terry in blue cotton among the hens; Ellen Terry robed and
crowned as Lady Macbeth on the stage of the Lyceum. The two
sketches are contradictory yet they are both of the same woman. She
hates the stage; yet she adores it. She worships her children; yet
she forsakes them. She would like to live for ever among pigs and
ducks in the open air; yet she spends the rest of her life among
actors and actresses in the limelight. Her own attempt to explain
the discrepancy is hardly convincing. "I have always been more
woman than artist," she says. Irving put the theatre first. "He had
none of what I may call my bourgeois qualities&mdash;the love of
being in love, the love of a home, the dislike of solitude." She
tries to persuade us that she was an ordinary woman enough; a
better hand at pastry than most; an adept at keeping house; with an
eye for colour, a taste for furniture, and a positive passion for
washing children's heads. If she went back to the stage it was
because&mdash;well, what else could she do when the bailiffs were
in the house?</p>

<p>This is the little sketch that she offers us to fill in the gap
between the two Ellen Terrys&mdash;Ellen the mother, and Ellen the
actress. But here we remember her warning: "Why, even I myself know
little or nothing of my real life." There was something in her that
she did not understand; something that came surging up from the
depths and swept her away in its clutches. The voice she heard in
the lane was not the voice of Charles Reade; nor was it the voice
of the bailiffs. It was the voice of her genius; the urgent call of
something that she could not define, could not suppress, and must
obey. So she left her children and followed the voice back to the
stage, back to the Lyceum, back to a long life of incessant toil,
anguish, and glory.</p>

<p>But, having gazed at the full-length portrait of Ellen Terry as
Sargeant painted her, robed and crowned as Lady Macbeth, turn to
the next page. It is done from another angle. Pen in hand, she is
seated at her desk. A volume of Shakespeare lies before her. It is
open at <i>Cymbeline,</i> and she is making careful notes in the
margin. The part of Imogen presents great problems. She is, she
says, "on the rack" about her interpretation. Perhaps Bernard Shaw
can throw light upon the question? A letter from the brilliant
young critic of the <i>Saturday Review</i> lies beside Shakespeare.
She has never met him, but for years they have written to each
other, intimately, ardently, disputatiously, some of the best
letters in the language. He says the most outrageous things. He
compares dear Henry to an ogre, and Ellen to a captive chained in
his cage. But Ellen Terry is quite capable of holding her own
against Bernard Shaw. She scolds him, laughs at him, fondles him,
and contradicts him. She has a curious sympathy for the advanced
views that Henry Irving abominated. But what suggestions has the
brilliant critic to make about Imogen? None apparently that she has
not already thought for herself. She is as close and critical a
student of Shakespeare as he is. She has studied every line,
weighed the meaning of every word; experimented with every
gesture.-Each of those golden moments when she becomes bodyless,
not herself, is the result of months of minute and careful study.
"Art", she quotes, "needs that which we can give her, I assure
you." In fact this mutable woman, all instinct, sympathy, and
sensation, is as painstaking a student and as careful of the
dignity of her art as Flaubert himself.</p>

<p>But once more the expression on that serious face changes. She
works like a slave&mdash;none harder. But she is quick to tell Mr.
Shaw that she does not work with her brain only. She is not in the
least clever. Indeed, she is happy she tells him, <i>"not to be
clever</i>". She stresses the point with a jab of her pen. "You
clever people", as she calls him and his friends, miss so much, mar
so much. As for education, she never had a day's schooling in her
life. As far as she can see, but the problem baffles her, the main
spring of her art is imagination. Visit mad-houses, if you like;
take notes; observe; study endlessly. But first, imagine. And so
she takes her part away from the books out into the woods. Rambling
down grassy rides, she lives her part until she is it. If a word
jars or grates, she must re-think it, re-write it. Then when every
phrase is her own, and every gesture spontaneous, out she comes on
to the stage and is Imogen, Ophelia, Desdemona.</p>

<p>But is she, even when the great moments are on her, a great
actress? She doubts it. "I cared more for love and life," she says.
Her face, too, has been no help to her. She cannot sustain emotion.
Certainly she is not a great tragic actress. Now and again,
perhaps, she has acted some comic part to perfection. But even
while she analyses herself; as one artist to another, the sun
slants upon an old kitchen chair. "Thank the Lord for my eyes!" she
exclaims. What a world of joy her eyes have brought her! Gazing at
the old "rush-bottomed, sturdy-legged, and wavy-backed" chair, the
stage is gone, the limelights are out, the famous actress is
forgotten.</p>

<p>Which, then, of all these women is the real Ellen Terry?' How
are we to put the scattered sketches together? Is she mother, wife,
cook, critic, actress, or should she have been, after all, a
painter? Each part seems the right part until she throws it aside
and plays another. Something of Ellen Terry it seems overflowed
every part and remained unacted. Shakespeare could not fit her; not
Ibsen; nor Shaw. The stage could not hold her; nor the nursery. But
there is, after all, a greater dramatist than Shakespeare, Ibsen,
or Shaw. There is Nature. Hers is so vast a stage, and so
innumerable a company of actors, that for the most part she fobs
them off with a tag or two. They come on and they go off without
breaking the ranks. But now and again Nature creates a new part, an
original part. The actors who act that part always defy our
attempts to name them. They will not act the stock parts&mdash;they
forget the words, they improvise others of their own. But when they
come on the stage falls like a pack of cards and the limelights are
extinguished. That was Ellen Terry's fate&mdash;to act a new part.
And thus while other actors are remembered because they were
Hamlet, Ph&egrave;dre, or Cleopatra, Ellen Terry is remembered
because she was Ellen Terry.</p>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>TO SPAIN</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1923</i></b>
</p>

<p>You, who cross the Channel yearly, probably no longer see the
house at Dieppe, no longer feel, as the train moves slowly down the
street, one civilisation fall, another rise&mdash;from the ruin and
chaos of British stucco this incredible pink and blue phoenix four
stories high, with its flower-pots, its balconies, its servant-girl
leaning on the window-sill indolently looking out. Quite unmoved
you sit reading&mdash;Thomas Hardy perhaps&mdash;bridging abysses,
preserving continuity, a little contemptuous of the excitement
which is moving those who feel themselves liberated from one
civilisation, launched upon another, to such odd gestures, such
strange irreticences. But reflect how much they have already gone
through. Try to recall the look of London streets seen very early,
perhaps very young, from a cab window on the way to Victoria.
Everywhere there is the same intensity, as if the moment instead of
moving lay suddenly still, because suddenly solemn, fixed the
passers-by in their most transient aspects eternally They do not
know how important they have become. If they did, perhaps they
would cease to buy newspapers and scrub doorsteps. But we who are
about to leave them feel all the more moved that they should
continue to do these homely things on the brink of that
precipice&mdash;our departure. Therefore it is natural that those
who have survived the crossing, with its last scrutiny of passing
faces so like a little rehearsal of death, should be shaken; should
move handbags; start conversations; and tremble for one
intoxicating moment upon the brink of that ideal society where
everyone without fear or hesitation reveals the depths of his
soul.</p>

<p>But it is only for a moment. Next, the disembodied spirit
fluttering at the window desires above all things to be admitted to
the new society where the houses are painted in lozenges of pale
pink and blue; women wear shawls; trousers are baggy; there are
crucifixes on hill-tops; yellow mongrel dogs; chairs in the street;
cobbles&mdash;gaiety, frivolity, drama, in short. "I'm awfully
sorry for Agnes because now they can't be married till he gets a
job in London. It's too far to get back from the works for midday
dinner I should have thought the father would have done something
for them." These detached sentences, spoken a little brokenly (for
they are frowning into tiny mirrors and drawing combs intently
through fair bobbed hair) by two English girls, fall like the bars
of a prison-house heavily across the mind. It is from them that we
must escape; the hours, the works, the divisions, rigid and
straight, of the old British week. Already as the train moves out
of Dieppe these obstructions seem bubbling and boiling in the
cauldron of a more congenial civilization. The days of the week
diminished; the hours disappeared. It was five o'clock, but no
banks had simultaneously shut their doors, nor from innumerable
lifts had millions of citizens emerged in time for dinner, or in
the poorer suburbs for slices of cold meat and Swiss roll laid
orderly in shallow glass dishes. There must be divisions even for
the French, but where they fall we cannot tell, and the lady in the
corner, so pale, so plump, so compact, seemed as she sat smiling to
be riding life over ditches and boundaries smoothed out by the
genius of the Latin race.</p>

<p>She rose to go to the dining-car. As she sat down she took a
small frying-pan from her handbag and hid it discreetly beneath a
tent made from a copy of <i>Le Temps.</i> Deftly as each dish was
served she secreted a portion in the absence of the waiter. Her
husband smiled. Her husband approved. We only knew that she was
brave. They might be poor. The helpings were large. The French have
mothers. To redress perpetually the extravagances of life, and make
the covering fit the fact instead of bulging in ostentatious
emptiness, was part, no doubt, of the French genius for living.
Still, when it comes to the thick yellow rind of a not fresh
cheese&mdash;. Ironically smiling, she condescended, in that
exquisite tongue which twinkles like diamonds with all its accents,
to explain that she kept a dog. But she might have
kept&mdash;anything. "Life is so simple," she seemed to say.</p>

<p>"Life is so simple&mdash;life is so simple," said the wheels of
the Sud Express all night long, in that idiotic or ironic way they
have, for any message less appropriate to the uneasy darkness, the
clank of chains, the anguished cries of railwaymen, and in the dawn
the misery of the unrested body, could scarcely be imagined. But
travellers are much at the mercy of phrases. Taken from home, which
like a shell has made them hard, separate, individual, vast
generalisations formulate in their exposed brains; the stress of
wheel or window-blind beats into rhythm idiotic sayings of false
profundity about life, repeats to distraction fragments of prose,
and makes them stare with ferocious melancholy at the landscape,
which in the middle of France is dull enough. The French are
methodical; but life is simple; the French are prosaic; the French
have roads. Yes, they have roads which strike from that lean poplar
there to Vienna, to Moscow; pass Tolstoy's house, climb mountains,
then march, all shop decorated, down the middle of famous cities.
But in England the road runs out on to a cliff; wavers into sand at
the edge of the sea. It begins to seem dangerous to live in
England. Here actually one could build a house and have no
neighbours; go for a walk along this eternal white road for two,
three, four miles, and meet only one black dog and one old woman
who, depressed perhaps by the immensity of the landscape and the
futility of locomotion, has sat herself down on a bank, attached
her cow to her by a rope, and there sits, unmoved, incurious,
monumental. Could our English poets for a moment share her seat and
think her thoughts, forget the parish, the pansy, and the sparrow's
egg, and concentrate (as she appears to do) upon the fate of
men!</p>

<p>But as the country grows larger and larger outside Bordeaux, the
concentration which is needed to produce even the simplest of
little thoughts is rent as a glove is torn by the thrust of a large
hand. Blessed are painters with their brushes, paints, and
canvases. But words are flimsy things. They turn tail at the first
approach of visual beauty. They let one down in the most literal
sense into a chaotic, an alarming chasm filled&mdash;for the eye
pours it all in&mdash;with white towns, with mules in single file,
with solitary farms, with enormous churches, with vast fields
crumbling at evening into pallor, with fruit-trees blazing askew
like blown matches, and trees burning with oranges, and clouds and
storms. Beauty seemed to have closed overhead and one washes this
way and that in her waters. It is always on the shoulders of a
human being that one climbs out; a profile in the corridor; a lady
in deep mourning who steps into a motor-car and drives across an
arid plain&mdash;where and why? a child in Madrid throwing confetti
effusively upon the figure of Christ; an Englishman discussing,
while his hat obscures half the Sierra Nevada, Mr. Churchill's last
article in <i>The Times.</i> "No," one says to beauty&mdash;as one
rebukes an importunate dog, "down, down; let me look at you through
the eyes of human beings."</p>

<p>But the Englishman's hat is no measure of the Sierra Nevada.
Setting out next day upon foot and mule-back, this wrinkled red and
white screen, this background for hats, this queer comment
(especially at sunset) upon Mr. Churchill's article in <i>The
Times</i> is found to consist of stones, olive trees, goats,
asphodels, irises, bushes, ridges, shelves, clumps, tufts, and
hollows innumerable, indescribable, unthinkable. The mind's
contents break into short sentences. It is hot; the old man; the
frying-pan; it is hot; the image of the Virgin; the bottle of wine;
it is time for lunch; it is only half-past twelve; it is hot. And
then over and over again come all those objects&mdash;stones,
olives, goats, asphodels, dragon-flies, irises, until by some trick
of the imagination they run into phrases of command, exhortation,
and encouragement such as befit soldiers marching, sentinels on
lonely nights, and leaders of great battalions. But must one give
up the struggle? Must one relinquish the game? Yes, for the clouds
are drifting across the pass; mules mind not what they carry; mules
never stumble; they know the way. Why not leave everything to
them?</p>

<p>Riders, as night comes on (and the pass was very misty), seem to
be riding out of life towards some very enticing prospect, while
the four legs of their beasts carry on all necessary transactions
with the earth. Riders are at rest; on they go, and on and on. And,
they muse, what does it all matter; and what harm can come to a
good man (behold two priests stepping out of the drizzle, bowing
and disappearing) in life or after death? And then, since a fox has
crossed the path, which is on turf and must be nearly at the top of
the mountain, how strangely it seems as if they were riding in
England, a long day's journey, hundreds of years ago, and the
danger is over, and they see the lights of the inn, and the hostess
comes into the courtyard and bids them sit round the fire while she
cooks dinner, which they do, half-dreaming, while clumsy boys and
girls with red flowers pass and repass in the background, and the
mother suckles her baby, and the old man who never speaks breaks
tufts from the brushwood and throws them on the fire, which blazes
up, and the whole company stares.</p>

<p>But good heavens! One never knows what days follow what nights.
Good heavens again! "Don Fernando had a passion for pigeon pie, and
so kept pigeons up here"&mdash;on his roof, that is, from which one
has this astonishing, this strange, this disturbing view of the
Alpujarras. "He died last summer in Granada." Did he, indeed? It is
the light, of course; a million razor-blades have shaved off the
bark and the dust, and out pours pure colour; whiteness from
fig-trees; red and green and again white from the enormous, the
humped, the everlasting landscape. But listen to the sounds on the
roof&mdash;first the fluttering pigeons; then water rushing; then
an old man crying chickens for sale; then a donkey braying in the
valley far below. Listen; and as one listens this random life
begins to be issued from the heart of a village which has faced the
African coast with a timeless and aristocratic endurance for a
thousand years. But how say this (as one descends from the blaze)
to the Spanish peasant woman who bids one enter her room, with its
lilies and its washing, and smiles and looks out of the window as
if she too had looked for a thousand years?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>FISHING</h2>

<p>While there is a Chinese proverb which says that the fisherman
is pure at heart "as a white sea-shell", there is a Japanese poem,
four lines long, which says something so true but at the same time
so crude about the hearts of politicians that it had better be left
in its original obscurity. It may be this contradiction&mdash;Major
Hills, says his publisher, "has been a member of the House of
Commons for thirty years...Throughout his long parliamentary life
he has remained faithful to his favourite-sport"&mdash;which has
produced a collision in his book; a confusion in the mind of the
reader between fish and men.</p>

<p>All books are made of words, but mostly of words that flutter
and agitate thought. This book on the contrary, though made of
words, has a strange effect on the body. It lifts it out of the
chair; stands it on the banks of a river, and strikes it dumb. The
river rushes by; a voice commands: "Stand absolutely
motionless...Cast up and slightly across...Shoot the line out...Let
the flies come well round...On no account pull...Do not be in a
hurry to lift..." But the strain is too great, the excitement too
intense. We have pulled&mdash;we have lifted. The fish is off.
"Wait longer next time," the voice commands; "wait longer and
longer."</p>

<p>Now, if the art of writing consists in laying an egg in the
reader's mind from which springs the thing itself&mdash;whether man
or fish&mdash;and if this art requires such ardour in its
practitioners that they will readily, like Flaubert, give up all
their bright spring mornings to its pursuit, how does it come about
that Major Hills, who has spent thirty years in the House of
Commons, can do the trick? Sometimes at four in the morning, in the
early spring dawn, he has roused himself, not to dandle words, but
to rush down to the river&mdash;"the exquisite river, with its
vivid green wooded banks, its dark rose-coloured sandstone rocks,
its rushing crystalline water", and there he has stood with his
rod. There we stand too.</p>

<p>Look at the rod. It was bought of Strong of Carlisle and cost
one pound. "It consisted of a piece of whole bamboo with a
lancewood top spliced on...Never have I had a rod sweeter to cast
with and throwing a longer line." It is not a rod; it is a tool,
more beautiful than a Persian pot, more desirable than a lover.
"...A friend broke it...and I could never get another like it...and
I grieved sorely, for bamboo cannot be mended." What death or
disaster could be more pungent? But this is no time for sentiment.
There deep under the bank lies the old male salmon. What fly will
he take? The grey turkey, with a body of violet silk, the
archdeacon in fact, number one? The line is cast; out it floats;
down its settles. And then? "...The fish went perfectly mad,
overran my reel...jammed it, and broke my twisted gut trace. It all
happened in a few seconds..." But they were seconds of
extraordinary intensity, seconds lived alone "in a world of strong
emotion, cut off from all else". When we look up Corby's walks have
changed. "The trees had their young light leaves, some of them
golden, the wild cherry was covered with drifts of snow and the
ground was covered with dog mercury, looking as though it had been
newly varnished...I felt receptive to every sight, every colour and
every sound, as though I walked through a world from which a veil
had been withdrawn."</p>

<p>Is it possible that to remove veils from trees it is necessary
to fish?&mdash;our conscious mind must be all body, and then the
unconscious mind leaps to the top and strips off veils? Is it
possible that, if to bare reality is to be a poet, we have, as Mr.
Yeats said the other day, no great poet because since the war
farmers preserve or net their waters, and vermin get up? Has the
deplorable habit of Clubs to fetter anglers with ridiculous
restrictions, to pamper them with insidious luxuries, somehow
cramped our poets' style? And the novelists&mdash;if we have no
novelist in England to-day whose stature is higher than the third
button on Sir Walter's waistcoat, or reaches to the watch-chain of
Charles Dickens, or the ring on the little finger of George Eliot,
is it not that the Cumberland poachers are dying out? "They were an
amusing race, full of rare humour, delightful to talk to...We often
had chats on the banks and they would tell me quite openly of their
successes." But now "the old wild days are over"; the poachers are
gone. They catch trout, commercially, innumerably, for hotels.
Banish from fiction all poachers' talk, the dialect, the dialogue
of Scott, the publicans, the farmers of Dickens and George Eliot,
and what remains? Mouldy velvet; moth-eaten ermine; mahogany
tables; and a few stuffed fowls. No wonder, since the poachers are
gone, that fiction is failing..."But this is not catching trout,"
the voice commands. "Do not dawdle...Start fishing again without
delay."</p>

<p>It is a bad day; the sun is up; the trout are not feeding. We
fail again and again. But fishing teaches a stern morality;
inculcates a remorseless honesty. The fault may be with ourselves..
"Why do I go on missing at the strike?...If I had more delicacy in
casting, more accuracy, if I had fished finer, should I not have
done better? And the answer is&mdash;Yes!...I lost him through
sinning against the light...I failed through obstinate stupidity."
We are sunk deep in the world of meditation and remorse.
"Contradiction lies at the root of all powerful emotions. We are
not ruled by reason. We follow a different law, and recognise its
sanctions..." Sounds from the outer world come through the roar of
the river. Barbarians have invaded the upper waters of the Eden and
Driffield Beck. But happily the barbarians are grayling; and the
profound difference that divides the human race is a question of
bait&mdash;whether to fish with worms or not; some will; to others
the thought is unutterably repulsive.</p>

<p>But the summer's day is fading. Night is coming on&mdash;the
Northern night, which is not dark, for the light is there, but
veiled. "A Cumberland night is something to remember", and
trout&mdash;for trout are "curious pieces of work"&mdash;will feed
in Cumberland at midnight. Let us go down to the bank again. The
river sounds louder than by day. "As I walked down I heard its
varied cadence, obscured during sunlight, at one moment deep, then
clamorous, then where thick beech trees hid the river subdued to a
murmur...The flowering trees had long since lost their blossoms,
but on coming to a syringa bush I walked suddenly into its scent,
and was drenched as in a bath. I sat on the path. I stretched my
legs. I lay down, finding a tuft of grass for pillow, and the
yielding sand for mattress. I fell asleep."</p>

<p>And while the fisherman sleeps, we who are presumably
reading&mdash;but what kind of reading is this when we see through
the words Corby's trees and trout at the bottom of the
page?&mdash;wonder, what does the fisherman dream? Of all the
rivers rushing past&mdash;the Eden, the Test, and the Kennet, each
river different from the other, each full of shadowy fish, and each
fish different from the other; the trout subtle, the salmon
ingenious; each with its nerves, with its brain, its mentality that
we can dimly penetrate, movements we can mystically anticipate, for
just as, suddenly, Greek and Latin sort themselves in a flash, so
we understand the minds of fish? Or does he dream of the wild
Scottish hill in the blizzard; and the patch of windless weather
behind the rock, when the pale grasses no longer bent but stood
upright; or of the vision on top&mdash;twenty Whooper swans
floating on the loch fearlessly, "for they had come from some land
where they had never seen a man"? Or does he dream of poachers with
their whisky-stained weather-beaten faces; or of Andrew Lang,
drinking, and discussing the first book of Genesis; or of F. S.
Oliver, whose buttons after a meal "kept popping off like broom
pods in autumn"; or of Sparrow, the hunter, "a more generous animal
never was seen"; or of the great Arthur Wood and all his bees? Or
does he dream of places that his ghost will revisit if it ever
comes to earth again&mdash;of Ramsbury, Highhead, and the Isle of
Jura?</p>

<p>For dream he does. "I always, even now, dream that I shall
astonish the world. An outstanding success..." The Premiership is
it? No, this triumph, this outstanding success is not with men; it
is with fish; it is with the floating line. "I believe it will
come..." But here he wakes "with that sense of well-being which
sleep in the open air always engenders. It was midnight, moonless
and clear. I walked to the edge of the flat rock..." The trout were
feeding.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>THE ARTIST AND POLITICS</h2>

<p>I have been asked by the Artist's International Association to
explain as shortly as I can why it is that the artist at present is
interested, actively and genuinely, in politics. For it seems that
there are some people to whom this interest is suspect.</p>

<p>That the writer is interested in politics needs no saying. Every
publisher's list, almost every book that is now issued, brings
proof of the fact. The historian to-day is writing not about Greece
and Rome in the past, but about Germany and Spain in the present;
the biographer is writing lives of Hitler and Mussolini, not of
Henry the Eighth and Charles Lamb; the poet introduces communism
and fascism into his lyrics; the novelist turns from the private
lives of his characters to their social surroundings and their
political opinions. Obviously the writer is in such close touch
with human life that any agitation in his subject matter must
change his angle of vision. Either he focuses his sight upon the
immediate problem; or he brings his subject matter into relation
with the present; or in some cases, so paralysed is he by the
agitations of the moment that he remains silent.</p>

<p>But why should this agitation affect the painter and the
sculptor? it may be asked. He is not concerned with the feelings of
his model but with its form. The rose and the apple have no
political views. Why should he not spend his time contemplating
them, as he has always done, in the cold north light that still
falls through his studio window?</p>

<p>To answer this question shortly is not easy, for to understand
why the artist&mdash;the plastic artist&mdash;is affected by the
state of society, we must try to define the relations of the artist
to society, and this is difficult, partly because no such
definition has ever been made. But that there is some sort of
understanding between them, most people would agree; and in times
of peace it may be said roughly to run as follows. The artist on
his side held that since the value of his work depended upon
freedom of mind, security of person, and immunity from practical
affairs&mdash;for to mix art with politics, he held, was to
adulterate it&mdash;he was absolved from political duties;
sacrificed many of the privileges that the active citizen enjoyed;
and in return created what is called a work of art. Society on its
side bound itself to run the state in such a manner that it paid
the artist a living wage; asked no active help from him; and
considered itself repaid by those works of art which have always
formed one of its chief claims to distinction. With many lapses and
breaches on both sides, the contract has been kept; society has
accepted the artist's work in lieu of other services, and the
artist, living for the most part precariously on a pittance, has
written or painted without regard for the political agitations of
the moment. Thus it would be impossible, when we read Keats, or
look at the pictures of Titian and Velasquez, or listen to the
music of Mozart or Bach, to say what was the political condition of
the age or the country in which these works were created. And if it
were otherwise&mdash;if the <i>Ode to a Nightingale</i> were
inspired by hatred of Germany; if <i>Bacchus and Ariadne</i>
symbolised the conquest of Abyssinia; if <i>Figaro</i> expounded
the doctrines of Hitler, we should feel cheated and imposed upon,
as if, instead of bread made with flour, we were given bread made
with plaster.</p>

<p>But if it is true that some such contract existed between the
artist and society, in times of peace, it by no means follows that
the artist is independent of society. Materially of course he
depends upon it for his bread and butter. Art is the first luxury
to be discarded in times of stress; the artist is the first of the
workers to suffer. But intellectually also he depends upon society.
Society is not only his paymaster but his patron. If the patron
becomes too busy or too distracted to exercise his critical
faculty, the artist will work in a vacuum and his art will suffer
and perhaps perish from lack of understanding. Again, if the patron
is neither poor nor indifferent, but dictatorial&mdash;if he will
only buy pictures that flatter his vanity or serve his
politics&mdash;then again the artist is impeded and his work
becomes worthless. And even if there are some artists who can
afford to disregard the patron, either because they have private
means or have learnt in the course of time to form their own style
and to depend upon tradition, these are for the most part only the
older artists whose work is already done. Even they, however, are
by no means immune. For though it would be easy to stress the point
absurdly, still it is a fact that the practice of art, far from
making the artist out of touch with his kind, rather increases his
sensibility. It breeds in him a feeling for the passions and needs
of mankind in the mass which the citizen whose duty it is to work
for a particular country or for a particular party has no time and
perhaps no need to cultivate. Thus even if he be ineffective, he is
by no means apathetic. Perhaps indeed he suffers more than the
active citizen because he has no obvious duty to discharge.</p>

<p>For such reasons then it is clear that the artist is affected as
powerfully as other citizens when society is in chaos, although the
disturbance affects him in different ways. His studio now is far
from being a cloistered spot where he can contemplate his model or
his apple in peace. It is besieged by voices, all disturbing, some
for one reason, some for another. First there is the voice which
cries: "I cannot protect you; I cannot pay you. I an so tortured
and distracted that I can no longer enjoy your works of art." Then
there is the voice which asks for help. "Come down from your ivory
tower, leave your studio," it cries, "and use your gifts as doctor,
as teacher, not as artist." Again there is the voice which warns
the artist that unless he can show good cause why art benefits the
state he will be made to help it actively&mdash;by making
aeroplanes, by firing guns. And finally there is the voice which
many artists in other countries have already heard and had to
obey&mdash;the voice which proclaims that the artist is the servant
of the politician. "You shall only practise your art", it says, "at
our bidding. Paint us pictures, carve us statues that glorify our
gospels. Celebrate fascism; celebrate communism. Preach what we bid
you preach. On no other terms shall you exist."</p>

<p>With all these voices crying and conflicting in his ears, how
can the artist still remain at peace in his studio, contemplating
his model or his apple in the cold light that comes through the
studio window? He is forced to take part in politics; he must form
himself into societies like the Artists' International Association.
Two causes of supreme importance to him are in peril. The first is
his own survival; the other is the survival of his art.</p>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>ROYALTY</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1939</i></b>
</p>

<p>To begin with a quotation, since it may throw light upon a very
complex emotion: the accused came to town because, he said, "I
wanted to see the Dukes and Kings."</p>

<p>The accused also said: "The inner man tells me that I am a
Duke." Appearances were against him, and, as he had brought a
pistol with him, his further actions took him to the Law Courts.
But save that he went a step further than most of us, his state of
mind was much the same as ours. We too want to see the Dukes and
Kings. There is no denying it, for the picture papers show us what
we want to see, and the picture papers are full of Dukes and Kings.
Even at times which it is sufficient to call "like these" there are
the little girls feeding the sea lions; there is the elderly lady
accepting a bouquet; there is the young man with a ribbon across
his breast. And we look at them, almost every day we look at them,
because we too want to see the Dukes and Kings.</p>

<p>It is not a simple wish. It is very very old, to begin with, and
old emotions like old families have intermarried and have many
connections. Love of Royalty, or to give it its crude name,
snobbery, is related to love of pageantry, which has some
connection with love of beauty&mdash;a respectable connection; and
again with the imagination&mdash;which is still more respectable
for it creates poems and novels. Certainly an old body in black
with a pair of horn spectacles on her nose required a good deal of
gilding by the imagination before she became the British Empire
personified. Scott undoubtedly had to use the same imagination upon
George the Fourth's tumbler to make it worth stealing that he had
to use upon the Waverley Novels to make them worth reading. We must
call up battles and banners and many ghosts and glories before we
see whatever it is that we do see in the picture of a child feeding
a bear with a bun. But perhaps the most profound satisfaction that
Royalty provides is that it gives us a Paradise to inhabit, and one
much more domestic than that provided by the Church of England.
Pile carpets are more palpable than fields of asphodel, and the
music of the Scots Greys more audible than the hymns angels play
upon their harps. Moreover, real people live in Buckingham Palace,
but always smiling, perfectly dressed, immune, we like to imagine,
if not from death and sorrow, still from the humdrum and the
pettifogging. Even though our inner man does not tell us that we
are Dukes, it is a consolation to know that such beings exist. If
they live, then we too live in them, vicariously. Probably most
people, as they hold out a penny to the bus conductor on a rainy
night, have caught themselves pretending that a beautiful lady is
stooping to kiss the royal hand, and the omnibus is lit up.</p>

<p>The last few years, however, have done some damage to this great
Victorian dream. For as we know, the Dukes and Kings refused to
play their part in the game any longer. Two at least declared that
they had hearts like ours; one heart loved a Smith, the other a
Simpson. The danger of this admission was at once felt to be very
great. A leading statesman foraged in the College of Heralds and
discovered that the lady was descended, perhaps on the mother's
side, perhaps from a Knight, who had perhaps fought at the Battle
of Hastings. But the public was not to be bamboozled. We said, we
cannot dream our dreams about people with hearts like ours. Such
names as Smith and Simpson rouse us to reality. And the emotion was
finely discriminated by a Court lady, who said that though she
could curtsey to Queen Elizabeth, the pink of grace and charm,
there was a difference&mdash;precisely what, she omitted to
say&mdash;between the curtsey she dropped an Earl's daughter and
the curtsey she gave Queen Mary the Royal. As for bending to a name
which is to be read in large letters over a well-known shop in
Piccadilly, her knees, she said, positively and, as it appeared,
quite independently of their owner, refused to comply.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show that the matter is complex.
Further, blue blood by itself is not enough. For though there are
extreme Royalists who can sustain themselves upon the shades of the
Stuarts&mdash;do they not still come with their white roses to the
Martyr's grave?&mdash;the cruder mass of us requires that Royalty
shall have its crown and sceptre. In France for example there are
princes of the Houses of Bourbon and Orleans whose blood is perhaps
bluer than that of our own House of Windsor. But nobody cares to
see them feeding pandas. No photographs of them appear in the
French picture papers. Snobbery, it seems, can get no nourishment
from the stout man in a frock coat, who is the present King of
France, because he has lost his palace and his crown. It is like
feeding upon a painted rose. Off it flits, this queer human
sensibility, in search of other food. Food it must have since it is
alive and has been nourished, one way or another, ever since
Hengist or Horsa, many centuries ago, made some old tin vessel
serve for a crown. In France, as every traveller knows, it has
found a substitute. It feeds not upon Royalty but upon religion;
not indeed upon those ardours and ecstasies which are the kernel,
but upon the husks and pageantry. It feeds upon processions and
images; upon wayside shrines; on the holy man in cloth of gold
blessing the fishing-boat; on children in white muslin; on the
penny candles and the incense. The Roman Catholic religion provides
with this pageantry a substitute for Royalty. It gives the poorest
old crone, who has nothing but a bunch of roses to stick in a pot,
something to dream about, and, what is equally important, something
to do.</p>

<p>The English religion, however, whether because of the climate or
because of the creed, has nothing of the kind to offer. It is a
black and white indoor affair which makes no appeal to our senses
and asks no help from our hands. If therefore Royalty fails to
gratify our need of Royalty, the Protestant religion is not going
to come to our help. The desire will have to find some other
outlet. And the picture papers, in which we see the reflection of
so many desires, are already hinting at a possible substitute. At
present it is a hint only, and a very humble hint&mdash;nothing
more than a caterpillar. It is true that it was a rare caterpillar;
a gentleman in Kensington had found it in his back garden. And so
it had its photograph in the news, and appeared almost life-size
upon the very same page as the picture of the Princess who was
feeding the panda. There they were, side by side. But what is
important is that the eye, passing from the Princess to the
caterpillar, registered a thrill which, though different from the
Royalty thrill, was like enough to serve much the same purpose. The
desire of the moth for the star was gratified by the caterpillar.
How wonderful are caterpillars&mdash;so we may translate that
thrill&mdash;symmetrical in shape and brilliantly barred; the
Privet Hawk wears, not one garter ribbon across its breast, but
three or four. How little&mdash;the thrill continued&mdash;we know
of the lives of caterpillars, living mysteriously on the heights of
elm trees; urged by instincts that are not ours; immune from worry;
and capable, as we are not, of putting off this gross body and
winging their way...in short, the caterpillar suggested that if a
mere caterpillar found in Kensington can cause this thrill (here
curtailed) and if this thrill is much the same as that which
Royalty used to provide when Royalty was barred and beautiful and
immune from human weakness, then perhaps Science will do instead.
There is in being, if at present only in germ, some curiosity about
this unknown world that might be fed. This unknown world is after
all more beautiful than Buckingham Palace, and its inhabitants will
never, in all probability, come down from the tree-top to mate with
the Smiths and the Simpsons. If the picture papers then would come
to our help, we might dream a new dream, acquire a new snobbery; we
might see the coral insect at work; the panda alone in his forest;
the wild yet controlled dance of the atoms which makes, it is said,
the true being of the kitchen table; and spend our curiosity upon
them. The camera has an immense power in its eye, if it would only
turn that eye in rather a different direction. It might wean us by
degrees from the Princess to the panda, and shunt us past religion
to pay homage to Science, as some think a more venerable royal
house than the House of Windsor. Above all it could check the most
insidious and dangerous of current snobberies, which is making the
workers into Kings; has invested the slum, the mine, and the
factory with the old glamour of the palace, so that, as modern
fiction shows, we are beginning to escape, by picturing the lives
of the poor and day-dreaming about them, from the drudgery, about
which there is no sort of glamour, of being ourselves.</p>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>ROYALTY</h2>

<p><b><i>Written in 1939</i></b>
</p>

<p>Many important autobiographies have appeared this autumn, but
none stranger or in certain respects more interesting than <i>The
Story of My Life,</i> by Marie, Queen of Roumania. The reasons seem
to be that she is royal; that she can write; that no royal person
has ever been able to write before; and that the consequences may
well be extremely serious.</p>

<p>Royalty to begin with, merely as an experiment in the breeding
of human nature, is of great psychological interest. For centuries
a certain family has been segregated; bred with a care only
lavished upon race-horses; splendidly housed, clothed, and fed;
abnormally stimulated in some ways, suppressed in others;
worshipped, stared at, and kept shut up, as lions and tigers are
kept, in a beautiful brightly lit room behind bars. The
psychological effect upon them must be profound; and the effect
upon us is as remarkable. Sane men and women as we are, we cannot
rid ourselves of the superstition that there is something
miraculous about these people shut up in their cage. Common sense
may deny it; but take common sense for a walk through the streets
of London on the Duke of Kent's wedding-day. Not only will he find
himself in a minority, but as the gold coach passes and the bride
bows, his hand will rise to his head; off will come his hat, or on
the contrary it will be rammed firmly on his head. In either case
he will recognise the divinity of royalty.</p>

<p>Now one of these royal animals, Queen Marie of Roumania, has
done what had never been done before; she has opened the door of
the cage and sauntered out into the street. Queen Marie can write;
in a second, therefore, the bars are down. Instead of the expected
suavities and sweetnesses we come upon sharp little words; Uncle
Bertie laughs, "his laugh was a sort of crackle"; Kitty Renwick
kept the medicine chest; "the castor oil pills looked like
transparent white grapes with the oil moving about inside"; there
were "little squares of burnt skin" on the pudding at Windsor;
Queen Victoria's teeth were "small like those of a mouse"; she had
a way of shrugging her shoulders when she laughed; when they rode
on the sands at evening "the shadows become so long that it is as
though our horses were walking on stilts"; there was a marvellous
stone in the museum, like a large piece of shortbread, that "swayed
slightly up and down when held at one end". This little girl, in
short, smelt, touched, and saw as other children do; but she had an
unusual power of following her feeling until she had coined the
word for it. That is to say, she can write.</p>

<p>If we want an example of the difference between writing and
non-writing we have only to compare a page of Queen Marie with a
page of Queen Victoria. The old Queen was, of course, an author.
She was forced by the exigencies of her profession to fill an
immense number of pages, and some of these have been printed and
bound between covers. But between the old Queen and the English
language lay an abyss which no depth of passion and no strength of
character could cross. Her works make very painful reading on that
account. She has to express herself in words; but words will not
come to her call. When she feels strongly and tries to say so, it
is like hearing an old savage beating with a wooden spoon on a
drum. "...this last refusal of Servia...almost <i>forces us</i> to
SEE <i>that</i> there is <i>no</i> false play." Rhythm is broken;
the few poverty-stricken words are bruised and battered; now hooked
together with hyphens, now desperately distended with italics and
capital letters&mdash;it is all no good. In the same way her
descriptions of celebrated people slip through the fingers like
water. "I waited a moment in the Drawing-room to speak to Irving
and Ellen Terry. He is very gentleman-like, and she, very pleasing
and handsome." This primitive little machine is all that she has
with which to register some of the most extraordinary experiences
that ever fell to a woman's lot. But probably she owed much of her
prestige to her inability to express herself. The majority of her
subjects, knowing her through her writing, came to feel that only a
woman immune from the usual frailties and passions of human nature
could write as Queen Victoria wrote. It added to her royalty.</p>

<p>But now by some freak of fate, which Queen Victoria would have
been the first to deplore, her 'granddaughter, the eldest child of
the late Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, has been born with a pen in
her hand. Words do her bidding. Her own account of it is
illuminating: "Even as a child", she says, "I possessed a vivid
imagination and I liked telling stories to my sisters...Then one of
my children said to me: 'Mama, you ought to write all this down, it
is a pity to allow so many beautiful pictures to fade away'...I
knew nothing whatever about writing, about style or composition, or
about the 'rules of the game', but I did know how to conjure up
beauty, also at times, emotion. I also had a vast store of words."
It is true; she knows nothing about "the rules of the game"; words
descend and bury whole cities under them; sights that should have
been seen once and for all are distracted and dissipated; she ruins
her effects and muffs her chances; but still because she feels
abundantly, because she rides after her emotion fearlessly and
takes her fences without caring for falls, she conjures up beauty
and conveys emotion. Nor is it merely that by a happy fluke she is
able to hit off a moment's impression, a vivid detail; she has the
rarer power of sweeping these figures along in a torrent of
language; lives grow and change beneath our eyes; scenes form
themselves; details arrange themselves; all the actors come alive.
Her most remarkable achievement in this way is her portrait of
"Aunty"&mdash;that Queen Elizabeth of Roumania who called herself
Carmen Sylva. As it happened, Queen Victoria also tried her hand at
a portrait of this lady. "The dear charming Queen", she writes,
"came to luncheon...She spoke with resignation and courage of her
many trials and difficulties...I gave her a Celtic brooch and
Balmoral shawl, also some books...The Queen read to us one of her
plays, an ancient Greek story, very tragic. She read it to us most
wonderfully and beautifully, and had quite an inspired look as she
did so...Many could, of course, not understand, as she read it in
German, but all were interested."</p>

<p>In Queen Marie's hands this "dear charming Queen" develops out
of all recognition. She becomes a complex contradictory human
being, wearing floating veils and a motoring cap, at once "splendid
and absurd". We see her posing in bed under a top light;
dramatising herself melodramatically; luxuriating in the flattery
of sycophants; declaiming poetry through a megaphone to ships at
sea; waving a napkin to grazing cows whom she mistakes for loyal
subjects&mdash;deluded and fantastic, but at the same time generous
and sincere. So the picture shapes itself, until all the different
elements are shown in action. Two scenes stand out with genuine
vitality&mdash;one where the romantic impulsive old lady seeks to
enchant an ancient flame&mdash;the late Duke of Edinburgh&mdash;by
dragging him to a hill-top where hidden minstrels spring out from
behind rocks and bawl native melodies into his disgusted ears; the
other where Queen Elizabeth of Roumania and Queen Emma of Holland
sit at their needlework while the Italian secretary reads aloud. He
chose Maeterlinck, and as he declaimed the famous passage where the
queen bee soars higher and higher in her nuptial ecstasy till at
last the male insect, ravaged by passion, drops dismembered to the
ground, Carmen Sylva raised her beautiful white hands' in rapture.
But Queen Emma gave one look at the reader and went on hemming her
duster.</p>

<p>Vivid as it all is, nobody is going to claim that Queen Marie
ranks with Saint Simon or with Proust. Yet it would be equally
absurd to deny that by virtue of her pen she has won her freedom.
She is no longer a royal queen in a cage. She ranges the world,
free like any other human being to laugh, to scold, to say what she
likes, to be what she is. And if she has escaped, so too, thanks to
her, have we. Royalty is no longer quite royal. Uncle Bertie,
Onkel, Aunty, Nando, and the rest, are not mere effigies bowing and
smiling, opening bazaars, expressing exalted sentiments, and
remembering faces always with the same sweet smile. They are
violent and eccentric; charming and ill-tempered; some have
bloodshot eyes; others handle flowers with a peculiar tenderness.
In short, they are very like ourselves. They live as we do. And the
effect is surprising. A month or two ago, the late Duke of
Edinburgh was as dead as the dodo. Now, thanks to his daughter, we
know that he liked beer; that he liked to sip it while he read his
paper; that he hated music; that he loathed Roumanian melodies; and
that he sat on a rock in a rage.</p>

<p>But what will be the consequences if this familiarity between
them and us increases? Can we go on bowing and curtseying to people
who are just like ourselves? Are we not already a little ashamed of
the pushing and the staring now that we know from these two stout
volumes that one at least of the animals can talk? We begin to wish
that the Zoo should be abolished; that the royal animals should be
given the run of some wider pasturage&mdash;a royal Whipsnade. And
another question suggests itself. When a gift for writing lodges in
a family, it often persists and improves; and if Queen Marie's
descendants improve upon her gift as much as she has improved upon
Queen Victoria's is it not quite possible that a real poet will be
King of England in a hundred years time? And suppose that among the
autumn books of 2034 is <i>Prometheus Unbound,</i> by George the
Sixth, or <i>Wuthering Heights,</i> by Elizabeth the Second, what
will be the effect upon their loyal subjects? Will the British
Empire survive? Will Buckingham Palace look as solid then as it
does now? Words are dangerous things, let us remember. A republic
might be brought into being by a poem.</p>
