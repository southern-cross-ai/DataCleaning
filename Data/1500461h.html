  <p class="intro">"The Festival"... is considered to be one of the first of
  Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos stories.... The story was inspired by Lovecraft's
  first trip to Marblehead, Massachusetts, in December 1922. Lovecraft later
  called that visit "the most powerful single emotional climax experienced
  during my nearly forty years of existence. In a flash all the past of New
  England&mdash;all the past of Old England--all the past of Anglo-Saxondom and
  the Western World&mdash;swept over me and identified me with the stupendous
  totality of all things in such a way as it never did before and never did
  again. That was the high tide of my life." &mdash; <a href=

  <br>

  <p class="first">I WAS far from home, and the spell of the eastern sea was upon me. In the
  twilight I heard it pounding on the rocks, and I knew it lay just over the
  hill where the twisting willows writhed against the clearing sky and the
  first stars of evening. And because my fathers had called me to the old town
  beyond, I pushed on through the shallow, new-fallen snow along the road that
  soared lonely up to where Aldebaran twinkled among the trees; on toward the
  very ancient town I had never seen but often dreamed of.</p>

  <p>It was the Yuletide, that men call Christmas though they know in their
  hearts it is older than Bethlehem and Babylon, older than Memphis and
  mankind. It was the Yuletide, and I had come at last to the ancient sea town
  where my people had dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when festival
  was forbidden; where also they had commanded their sons to keep festival once
  every century, that the memory of primal secrets might not be forgotten. Mine
  were an old people, and were old even when this land was settled three
  hundred years before. And they were strange, because they had come as dark
  furtive folk from opiate southern gardens of orchids, and spoken another
  tongue before they learnt the tongue of the blue-eyed fishers. And now they
  were scattered, and shared only the rituals of mysteries that none living
  could understand. I was the only one who came back that night to the old
  fishing town as legend bade, for only the poor and the lonely remember.</p>

  <p>Then beyond the hill's crest I saw Kingsport outspread frostily in the
  gloaming; snowy Kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples, ridgepoles and
  chimney-pots, wharves and small bridges, willow-trees and graveyards; endless
  labyrinths of steep, narrow, crooked streets, and dizzy church-crowned
  central peak that time durst not touch; ceaseless mazes of colonial houses
  piled and scattered at all angles and levels like a child's disordered
  blocks; antiquity hovering on grey wings over winter-whitened gables and
  gambrel roofs; fanlights and small-paned windows one by one gleaming out in
  the cold dusk to join Orion and the archaic stars. And against the rotting
  wharves the sea pounded; the secretive, immemorial sea out of which the
  people had come in the elder time.</p>

  <p>Beside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose, bleak and
  windswept, and I saw that it was a burying-ground where black gravestones
  stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed fingernails of a gigantic
  corpse. The printless road was very lonely, and sometimes I thought I heard a
  distant horrible creaking as of a gibbet in the wind. They had hanged four
  kinsmen of mine for witchcraft in 1692, but I did not know just where.</p>

  <p>As the road wound down the seaward slope I listened for the merry sounds
  of a village at evening, but did not hear them. Then I thought of the season,
  and felt that these old Puritan folk might well have Christmas customs
  strange to me, and full of silent hearthside prayer. So after that I did not
  listen for merriment or look for wayfarers, kept on down past the hushed
  lighted farmhouses and shadowy stone walls to where the signs of ancient
  shops and sea taverns creaked in the salt breeze, and the grotesque knockers
  of pillared doorways glistened along deserted unpaved lanes in the light of
  little, curtained windows.</p>

  <p>I had seen maps of the town, and knew where to find the home of my people.
  It was told that I should be known and welcomed, for village legend lives
  long; so I hastened through Back Street to Circle Court, and across the fresh
  snow on the one full flagstone pavement in the town, to where Green Lane
  leads off behind the Market House. The old maps still held good, and I had no
  trouble; though at Arkham they must have lied when they said the trolleys ran
  to this place, since I saw not a wire overhead. Snow would have hid the rails
  in any case. I was glad I had chosen to walk, for the white village had
  seemed very beautiful from the hill; and now I was eager to knock at the door
  of my people, the seventh house on the left in Green Lane, with an ancient
  peaked roof and jutting second storey, all built before 1650.</p>

  <p>There were lights inside the house when I came upon it, and I saw from the
  diamond window-panes that it must have been kept very close to its antique
  state. The upper part overhung the narrow grass-grown street and nearly met
  the over-hanging part of the house opposite, so that I was almost in a
  tunnel, with the low stone doorstep wholly free from snow. There was no
  sidewalk, but many houses had high doors reached by double flights of steps
  with iron railings. It was an odd scene, and because I was strange to New
  England I had never known its like before. Though it pleased me, I would have
  relished it better if there had been footprints in the snow, and people in
  the streets, and a few windows without drawn curtains.</p>

  <p>When I sounded the archaic iron knocker I was half afraid. Some fear had
  been gathering in me, perhaps because of the strangeness of my heritage, and
  the bleakness of the evening, and the queerness of the silence in that aged
  town of curious customs. And when my knock was answered I was fully afraid,
  because I had not heard any footsteps before the door creaked open. But I was
  not afraid long, for the gowned, slippered old man in the doorway had a bland
  face that reassured me; and though he made signs that he was dumb, he wrote a
  quaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he carried.</p>

  <p>He beckoned me into a low, candle-lit room with massive exposed rafters
  and dark, stiff, sparse furniture of the seventeenth century. The past was
  vivid there, for not an attribute was missing. There was a cavernous
  fireplace and a spinning-wheel at which a bent old woman in loose wrapper and
  deep poke-bonnet sat back toward me, silently spinning despite the festive
  season. An indefinite dampness seemed upon the place, and I marvelled that no
  fire should be blazing. The high-backed settle faced the row of curtained
  windows at the left, and seemed to be occupied, though I was not sure. I did
  not like everything about what I saw, and felt again the fear I had had. This
  fear grew stronger from what had before lessened it, for the more I looked at
  the old man's bland face the more its very blandness terrified me. The eyes
  never moved, and the skin was too much like wax. Finally I was sure it was
  not a face at all, but a fiendishly cunning mask. But the flabby hands,
  curiously gloved, wrote genially on the tablet and told me I must wait a
  while before I could be led to the place of the festival.</p>

  <p>Pointing to a chair, table, and pile of books, the old man now left the
  room; and when I sat down to read I saw that the books were hoary and mouldy,
  and that they included old Morryster's wild <i>Marvels of Science</i>, the
  terrible <i>Sadducismus Triumphatus</i> of Joseph Glanvill, published in
  1681, the shocking <i>Daemonolatriae</i> of Remigius, printed in 1595 at
  Lyons, and worst of all, the unmentionable <i>Necronomicon</i> of the mad
  Arab Abdul Alhazred, in Olaus Wormius' forbidden Latin translation; a book
  which I had never seen, but of which I had heard monstrous things whispered.
  No one spoke to me, but I could hear the creaking of signs in the wind
  outside, and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old woman continued her
  silent spinning, spinning. I thought the room and the books and the people
  very morbid and disquieting, but because an old tradition of my fathers had
  summoned me to strange feastings, I resolved to expect queer things. So I
  tried to read, and soon became tremblingly absorbed by something I found in
  that accursed <i>Necronomicon</i>; a thought and a legend too hideous for
  sanity or consciousness, but I disliked it when I fancied I heard the closing
  of one of the windows that the settle faced, as if it had been stealthily
  opened. It had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of the old woman's
  spinning-wheel. This was not much, though, for the old woman was spinning
  very hard, and the aged clock had been striking. After that I lost the
  feeling that there were persons on the settle, and was reading intently and
  shudderingly when the old man came back booted and dressed in a loose antique
  costume, and sat down on that very bench, so that I could not see him. It was
  certainly nervous waiting, and the blasphemous book in my hands made it
  doubly so. When eleven struck, however, the old man stood up, glided to a
  massive carved chest in a corner, and got two hooded cloaks; one of which he
  donned, and the other of which he draped round the old woman, who was ceasing
  her monotonous spinning. Then they both started for the outer door; the woman
  lamely creeping, and the old man, after picking up the very book I had been
  reading, beckoning me as he drew his hood over that unmoving face or
  mask.</p>

  <p>We went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that incredibly
  ancient town; went out as the lights in the curtained windows disappeared one
  by one, and the Dog Star leered at the throng of cowled, cloaked figures that
  poured silently from every doorway and formed monstrous processions up this
  street and that, past the creaking signs and antediluvian gables, the
  thatched roofs and diamond-paned windows; threading precipitous lanes where
  decaying houses overlapped and crumbled together; gliding across open courts
  and churchyards where the bobbing lanterns made eldritch drunken
  constellations.</p>

  <p>Amid these hushed throngs I followed my voiceless guides; jostled by
  elbows that seemed preternaturally soft, and pressed by chests and stomachs
  that seemed abnormally pulpy; but seeing never a face and hearing never a
  word. Up, up, up, the eery columns slithered, and I saw that all the
  travelers were converging as they flowed near a sort of focus of crazy alleys
  at the top of a high hill in the center of the town, where perched a great
  white church. I had seen it from the road's crest when I looked at Kingsport
  in the new dusk, and it had made me shiver because Aldebaran had seemed to
  balance itself a moment on the ghostly spire.</p>

  <p>There was an open space around the church; partly a churchyard with
  spectral shafts, and partly a half-paved square swept nearly bare of snow by
  the wind, and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having peaked roofs and
  overhanging gables. Death-fires danced over the tombs, revealing gruesome
  vistas, though queerly failing to cast any shadows. Past the churchyard,
  where there were no houses, I could see over the hill's summit and watch the
  glimmer of stars on the harbor, though the town was invisible in the dark.
  Only once in a while a lantern bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on
  its way to overtake the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into the
  church. I waited till the crowd had oozed into the black doorway, and till
  all the stragglers had followed. The old man was pulling at my sleeve, but I
  was determined to be the last. Crossing the threshold into the swarming
  temple of unknown darkness, I turned once to look at the outside world as the
  churchyard phosphorescence cast a sickly glow on the hilltop pavement. And as
  I did so I shuddered. For though the wind had not left much snow, a few
  patches did remain on the path near the door; and in that fleeting backward
  look it seemed to my troubled eyes that they bore no mark of passing feet,
  not even mine.</p>

  <p>The church was scarce lighted by all the lanterns that had entered it, for
  most of the throng had already vanished. They had streamed up the aisle
  between the high pews to the trap-door of the vaults which yawned loathsomely
  open just before the pulpit, and were now squirming noiselessly in. I
  followed dumbly down the foot-worn steps and into the dark, suffocating
  crypt. The tail of that sinuous line of night-marchers seemed very horrible,
  and as I saw them wriggling into a venerable tomb they seemed more horrible
  still. Then I noticed that the tomb's floor had an aperture down which the
  throng was sliding, and in a moment we were all descending an ominous
  staircase of rough-hewn stone; a narrow spiral staircase damp and peculiarly
  odorous, that wound endlessly down into the bowels of the hill past
  monotonous walls of dripping stone blocks and crumbling mortar. It was a
  silent, shocking descent, and I observed after a horrible interval that the
  walls and steps were changing in nature, as if chiseled out of the solid
  rock. What mainly troubled me was that the myriad footfalls made no sound and
  set up no echoes. After more aeons of descent I saw some side passages or
  burrows leading from unknown recesses of blackness to this shaft of nighted
  mystery. Soon they became excessively numerous, like impious catacombs of
  nameless menace; and their pungent odor of decay grew quite unbearable. I
  knew we must have passed down through the mountain and beneath the earth of
  Kingsport itself, and I shivered that a town should be so aged and maggoty
  with subterraneous evil.</p>

  <p>Then I saw the lurid shimmering of pale light, and heard the insidious
  lapping of sunless waters. Again I shivered, for I did not like the things
  that the night had brought, and wished bitterly that no forefather had
  summoned me to this primal rite. As the steps and the passage grew broader, I
  heard another sound, the thin, whining mockery of a feeble flute; and
  suddenly there spread out before me the boundless vista of an inner
  world&mdash;a vast fungous shore litten by a belching column of sick greenish
  flame and washed by a wide oily river that flowed from abysses frightful and
  unsuspected to join the blackest gulfs of immemorial ocean.</p>

  <p>Fainting and gasping, I looked at that unhallowed Erebus of titan
  toadstools, leprous fire and slimy water, and saw the cloaked throngs forming
  a semicircle around the blazing pillar. It was the Yule-rite, older than man
  and fated to survive him; the primal rite of the solstice and of spring's
  promise beyond the snows; the rite of fire and evergreen, light and music.
  And in the stygian grotto I saw them do the rite, and adore the sick pillar
  of flame, and throw into the water handfuls gouged out of the viscous
  vegetation which glittered green in the chlorotic glare. I saw this, and I
  saw something amorphously squatted far away from the light, piping noisomely
  on a flute; and as the thing piped I thought I heard noxious muffled
  flutterings in the fetid darkness where I could not see. But what frightened
  me most was that flaming column; spouting volcanically from depths profound
  and inconceivable, casting no shadows as healthy flame should, and coating
  the nitrous stone with a nasty, venomous verdigris. For in all that seething
  combustion no warmth lay, but only the clamminess of death and
  corruption.</p>

  <p>The man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the
  hideous flame, and made stiff ceremonial motions to the semi-circle he faced.
  At certain stages of the ritual they did groveling obeisance, especially when
  he held above his head that abhorrent <i>Necronomicon</i> he had taken with
  him; and I shared all the obeisances because I had been summoned to this
  festival by the writings of my forefathers. Then the old man made a signal to
  the half-seen flute-player in the darkness, which player thereupon changed
  its feeble drone to a scarce louder drone in another key; precipitating as it
  did so a horror unthinkable and unexpected. At this horror I sank nearly to
  the lichened earth, transfixed with a dread not of this or any world, but
  only of the mad spaces between the stars.</p>

  <p>Out of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that cold
  flame, out of the tartarean leagues through which that oily river rolled
  uncanny, unheard, and unsuspected, there flopped rhythmically a horde of
  tame, trained, hybrid winged things that no sound eye could ever wholly
  grasp, or sound brain ever wholly remember. They were not altogether crows,
  nor moles, nor buzzards, nor ants, nor vampire bats, nor decomposed human
  beings; but something I cannot and must not recall. They flopped limply
  along, half with their webbed feet and half with their membranous wings; and
  as they reached the throng of celebrants the cowled figures seized and
  mounted them, and rode off one by one along the reaches of that unlighted
  river, into pits and galleries of panic where poison springs feed frightful
  and undiscoverable cataracts.</p>

  <p>The old spinning woman had gone with the throng, and the old man remained
  only because I had refused when he motioned me to seize an animal and ride
  like the rest. I saw when I staggered to my feet that the amorphous
  flute-player had rolled out of sight, but that two of the beasts were
  patiently standing by. As I hung back, the old man produced his stylus and
  tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy of my fathers who had founded
  the Yule worship in this ancient place; that it had been decreed I should
  come back, and that the most secret mysteries were yet to be performed. He
  wrote this in a very ancient hand, and when I still hesitated he pulled from
  his loose robe a seal ring and a watch, both with my family arms, to prove
  that he was what he said. But it was a hideous proof, because I knew from old
  papers that that watch had been buried with my
  great-great-great-great-grandfather in 1698.</p>

  <p>Presently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family
  resemblance in his face, but I only shuddered, because I was sure that the
  face was merely a devilish waxen mask. The flopping animals were now
  scratching restlessly at the lichens, and I saw that the old man was nearly
  as restless himself. When one of the things began to waddle and edge away, he
  turned quickly to stop it; so that the suddenness of his motion dislodged the
  waxen mask from what should have been his head. And then, because that
  nightmare's position barred me from the stone staircase down which we had
  come, I flung myself into the oily underground river that bubbled somewhere
  to the caves of the sea; flung myself into that putrescent juice of earth's
  inner horrors before the madness of my screams could bring down upon me all
  the charnel legions these pest-gulfs might conceal.</p>

  <p>At the hospital they told me I had been found half-frozen in Kingsport
  Harbor at dawn, clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to save me.
  They told me I had taken the wrong fork of the hill road the night before,
  and fallen over the cliffs at Orange Point; a thing they deduced from prints
  found in the snow. There was nothing I could say, because everything was
  wrong. Everything was wrong, with the broad windows showing a sea of roofs in
  which only about one in five was ancient, and the sound of trolleys and
  motors in the streets below. They insisted that this was Kingsport, and I
  could not deny it. When I went delirious at hearing that the hospital stood
  near the old churchyard on Central Hill, they sent me to St Mary's Hospital
  in Arkham, where I could have better care. I liked it there, for the doctors
  were broad-minded, and even lent me their influence in obtaining the
  carefully sheltered copy of Alhazred's objectionable <i>Necronomicon</i> from
  the library of Miskatonic University. They said something about a "psychosis"
  and agreed I had better get any harassing obsessions off my mind.</p>

  <p>So I read that hideous chapter, and shuddered doubly because it was indeed
  not new to me. I had seen it before, let footprints tell what they might; and
  where it was I had seen it were best forgotten. There was no one &mdash;in
  waking hours&mdash;who could remind me of it; but my dreams are filled with
  terror, because of phrases I dare not quote. I dare quote only one paragraph,
  put into such English as I can make from the awkward Low Latin.</p>

  <p>"The nethermost caverns," wrote the mad Arab, "are not for the fathoming
  of eyes that see; for their marvels are strange and terrific. Cursed the
  ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied, and evil the mind that
  is held by no head. Wisely did Ibn Schacabao say, that happy is the tomb
  where no wizard hath lain, and happy the town at night whose wizards are all
  ashes. For it is of old rumor that the soul of the devil-bought hastes not
  from his charnel clay, but fats and instructs the very worm that gnaws; till
  out of corruption horrid life springs, and the dull scavengers of earth wax
  crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it. Great holes secretly are
  digged where earth's pores ought to suffice, and things have learnt to walk
  that ought to crawl."</p>
