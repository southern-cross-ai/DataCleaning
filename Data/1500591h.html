  <h2><a id="pre"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

  <p class="first">These pictures of the sixth century originated in my studies
  for the following works:</p>

  <p>"The Kings of the Goths," vol. ii., iii., iv. Munich and Würzburg,
  1862-66.</p>

  <p>"Procopius of Cæsarea:" a contribution to the historiography of the
  migration of nations and the decay of the Roman Empire. Berlin, 1865.</p>

  <p>By referring to these works, the reader may distinguish the details and
  changes which the romance has added to the reality.</p>

  <p>In history the events here described filled a period of almost thirty
  years' duration. From reasons easily understood, it was necessary to shorten,
  or at least to disguise, this long interval.</p>

  <p>The character of the Roman hero of the story, Cethegus Cæsarius, is a pure
  invention. That such a person existed is, however, known.</p>

  <p>The work was begun at Munich in 1859, continued at Ravenna, Italy, and
  concluded at Königsberg in 1876.</p>

<br>

  <h2><a id="b1-1"
     name="b1-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a sultry summer night of the year five hundred and
  twenty-six, A.D.</p>

  <p>Thick clouds lay low over the dark surface of the Adrea, whose shores and
  waters were melted together in undistinguishable gloom; only now and then a
  flash of distant lightning lit up the silent city of Ravenna. At unequal
  intervals the wind swept through the ilexes and pines on the range of hills
  which rise at some distance to the west of the town, and which were once
  crowned by a temple of Neptune. At that time already half ruined, it has now
  almost completely disappeared, leaving only the most scanty traces.</p>

  <p>It was quiet on the bosky heights; only sometimes a piece of rock,
  loosened by storms, clattered down the stony declivity, and at last splashed
  into the marshy waters of the canals and ditches which belted the entire
  circle of the sea-fortress; or a weather-beaten slab slipped from the tabled
  roof of the old temple and fell breaking on to the marble
  steps&mdash;forebodings of the threatened fall of the whole building.</p>

  <p>But these dismal sounds seemed to be unnoticed by a man who sat immovable
  on the second step of the flight which led into the temple, leaning his back
  against the topmost step and looking silently and fixedly across the
  declivity in the direction of the city below.</p>

  <p>He sat thus motionless, but waiting eagerly, for a long time. He heeded
  not that the wind drove the heavy drops which began to fell into his face,
  and rudely worried the full long beard that flowed down to his iron belt,
  almost entirely covering his broad breast with shining white hair.</p>

  <p>At last he rose and descended several of the marble steps: "They come,"
  said he.</p>

  <p>The light of a torch which rapidly advanced from the city towards the
  temple became visible; then quick and heavy footsteps were heard, and shortly
  after three men ascended the flight of steps.</p>

  <p>"Hail, Master Hildebrand, son of Hilding!" cried the advancing
  torch-bearer, as soon as he reached the row of columns of the Pronaos or
  antehall, in which time had made some gaps. He spoke in the Gothic tongue,
  and had a peculiarly melodious voice. He carried his torch in a sort of
  lantern&mdash;beautiful Corinthian bronze-work on the handle, transparent
  ivory forming the four-sided screen and the arched and
  ornamentally-perforated lid&mdash;and lifting it high, put it into the iron
  ring that held together the shattered centre column.</p>

  <p>The white light fell upon a face beautiful as that of Apollo, with
  laughing light-blue eyes; his fair hair was parted in the middle of his
  forehead into two long and flowing tresses, which fell right and left upon
  his shoulders. His mouth and nose, finely, almost softly chiselled, were of
  perfect form; the first down of a bright golden beard covered his pleasant
  lip and gently-dimpled chin. He wore only white garments&mdash;a war-mantle
  of fine wool, held up on the right shoulder by a clasp in the form of a
  griffin, and a Roman tunic of soft silk, both embroidered with a stripe of
  gold. White leather straps fastened the sandals to his feet, and reached,
  laced cross-wise, to his knees. Two broad gold rings encircled his naked and
  shining white arms. And as he stood reposing after his exertion, his right
  hand clasping a tall lance which served him both for staff and weapon, his
  left resting on his hip, looking down upon his slower companions, it seemed
  as if there had again entered the grey old temple some youthful godlike form
  of its happiest days.</p>

  <p>The second of the new-comers had, in spite of a general family likeness,
  an expression totally different from that of the torch-bearer.</p>

  <p>He was some years older, his form was stouter and broader. Low down upon
  his bull-neck grew his short, thick, and curly brown hair. He was of almost
  gigantic height and strength. There were wanting in his face the sunny
  shimmer, the trusting joy and hope which illumined the features of his
  younger brother. Instead of these, there was in his whole appearance an
  expression of bear-like strength and bear-like courage; he wore a shaggy
  wolf-skin, the jaws of which shaded his head like a cowl, a simple woollen
  doublet beneath, and on his right shoulder he carried a short and heavy club
  made of the hard root of an oak.</p>

  <p>The third comer followed the others with a cautious step; a middle-aged
  man with a dignified and prudent expression of countenance. He wore the steel
  helmet, the sword, and the brown war-mantle of the Gothic footmen. His
  straight light-brown hair was cut square across the forehead&mdash;an ancient
  Germanic mode of wearing the hair, which one often sees represented on Roman
  triumphal columns, and which has been preserved by the German peasant to this
  day. The regular features of his open face, his grey and steady eyes, were
  full of reflective manliness and sober repose.</p>

  <p>When he, too, had reached the cella of the temple, and had greeted the old
  man, the torch-bearer cried in an eager voice:</p>

  <p>"Well, old Master Hildebrand, a fine adventure must it be to which thou
  hast bidden us on such an inhospitable night, and in this wilderness of art
  and nature! Speak&mdash;what is it?"</p>

  <p>Instead of replying, the old man turned to the last comer and asked:
  "Where is the fourth whom I invited?"</p>

  <p>"He wished to go alone. He shunned us all. Thou knowest his manner
  well."</p>

  <p>"There he comes!" cried the beautiful youth, pointing to another side of
  the hill. And, in fact, a man of very peculiar appearance now drew near.</p>

  <p>The full glare of the torch illumined a ghastly-pale face that seemed
  almost bloodless. Long and shining black locks, like dark snakes, hung
  dishevelled from his uncovered head. Arched black brows and long lashes
  shaded large and melancholy dark eyes, full of repressed fire. A sharply-cut
  eagle nose bent towards the fine and smoothly-shaven mouth, around which
  resigned grief had traced deep lines.</p>

  <p>His form and bearing were still young; but pain seemed to have prematurely
  ripened his soul.</p>

  <p>He wore a coat of mail and greaves of black steel, and in his right hand
  gleamed a battle-axe with a long lance-like shaft. He merely greeted the
  others with a nod of the head, and placing himself behind the old man, who
  now bade them all four step close to the pillar on which the torch was fixed,
  began in a suppressed voice:</p>

  <p>"I appointed you to meet me here to listen to earnest words, which must be
  spoken, unheard, to faithful men. I have sought for months in all the nation,
  and have chosen you. You are the right men. When you have heard me, you will
  yourselves feel that you must be silent about this night's meeting."</p>

  <p>The third comer, he with the steel helmet, looked at the old man with
  earnest eyes.</p>

  <p>"Speak," said he quietly, "we hear and are silent. Of what wilt thou speak
  to us?"</p>

  <p>"Of our people; of this kingdom of the Goths, which stands close to an
  abyss!"</p>

  <p>"An abyss!" eagerly cried the fair youth. His gigantic brother smiled and
  lifted his head attentively.</p>

  <p>"Yes, an abyss," repeated the old man; "and you alone can hold and save
  it."</p>

  <p>"May Heaven pardon thee thy words!" interrupted the fair youth with
  vivacity. "Have we not our King Theodoric, whom even his enemies call the
  Great; the most magnificent hero, the wisest prince in the world? Have we not
  this smiling land Italia, with all its treasures? What upon earth can compare
  with the kingdom of the Goths?"</p>

  <p>The old man, without heeding his questions, continued:</p>

  <p>"Listen to me. The greatness and worth of King Theodoric, my beloved
  master and my dear son, are best known by Hildebrand, son of Hilding. More
  than fifty years ago I carried him in these arms, a struggling boy, to his
  father, and said: 'There is an offspring of a strong race&mdash;he will be a
  joy to thee.' And when he grew up I cut for him his first arrow, and washed
  his first wound. I accompanied him to the golden city of Byzantium, and
  guarded him body and soul. When he fought for this lovely land, I went before
  him, foot by foot, and held the shield over him in thirty battles. He may
  possibly, since then, have found more learned advisers and friends than his
  old master-at-arms, but hardly wiser, and surely not more faithful. Long ere
  the sun shone upon thee, my young falcon, I had experienced a thousand times
  how strong was his arm, how sharp his eye, how clear his head, how terrible
  he could be in battle, how friendly over the cup, and how superior he was
  even to the Greekling in shrewdness. But the old Eagle's wings have become
  heavy. His battle-years weigh upon him; for he and you, and all your race,
  cannot bear years like I and my play-fellows; he lies sick in soul and body,
  mysteriously sick, in his golden hall down there in the Raven-town. The
  physicians say that though his arm be yet strong, any beat of his heart may
  kill him with lightning-like rapidity, and with any setting sun he may
  journey down to the dead. And who is his heir? who will then uphold this
  kingdom? Amalaswintha, his daughter; and Athalaric, his grandson; a woman and
  a child!"</p>

  <p>"The Princess is wise," said he with the helmet and the sword.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she writes Greek to the Emperor, and speaks Latin with the pious
  Cassiodorus. I doubt that she even thinks in Gothic. Woe to us, if she should
  hold the rudder in a storm!"</p>

  <p>"But I see no signs of storm, old man," laughed the torch-bearer, and
  shook his locks. "From whence will it blow? The Emperor is again reconciled,
  the Bishop of Rome is installed by the King himself, the Frank princes are
  his nephews, the Italians are better off under our shield than ever before. I
  see no danger anywhere."</p>

  <p>"The Emperor Justinus is only a weak old man," said he of the sword,
  assentingly. "I know him."</p>

  <p>"But his nephew, who will soon be his successor, and is already his right
  arm&mdash;knowest thou him? Unfathomable as the night and false as the sea is
  Justinian! I know him well, and fear that which he meditates. I accompanied
  the last embassy to Byzantium. He came to our camp; he thought me
  drunk&mdash;the fool! he little knows what Hilding's child can
  drink!&mdash;and he questioned me about everything which must be known in
  order to undo us. Well, he got the right answer from me! But I know as well
  as I know my name, that this man will again get possession of Italy; and he
  will not leave in it even the footprint of a Goth!"</p>

  <p>"If he can," grumblingly put in the brother of the fair youth.</p>

  <p>"Right, friend Hildebad, if he can. And he can do much. Byzantium can do
  much."</p>

  <p>The other shrugged his shoulder</p>

  <p>"Knowest thou <i>how</i> much?" asked the old man angrily. "For twelve
  long years our great King struggled with Byzantium and did not prevail. But
  at that time thou wast not yet born," he added more quietly.</p>

  <p>"Well," interposed the fair youth, coming to his brother's help, "but at
  that time the Goths stood alone in the strange land. Now we have won a second
  half. We have a home&mdash;Italy. We have brothers-at-arms&mdash;the
  Italians!"</p>

  <p>"Italy our home!" cried the old man bitterly; "yes, that is the mistake.
  And the Italians our allies against Byzantium? Thou young fool!"</p>

  <p>"They were our King's own words," answered the rebuffed youth.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes; I know these mad speeches well, that will destroy us all. We
  are as strange here to-day as forty years ago, when we descended from the
  mountains; and we shall still be strangers in the land after another thousand
  years. Here we shall be for ever 'the barbarians.'"</p>

  <p>"That is true; but why do we remain barbarians? Whose fault is it but
  ours? Why do we not learn from the Italians?"</p>

  <p>"Be silent," cried the old man, trembling with wrath, "be silent, Totila,
  with such thoughts; they have become the curse of my house!" Painfully
  recovering himself, he continued: "The Italians are our deadly enemies, not
  our brothers. Woe to us if we trust them! Oh that the King had followed my
  counsel after his victory, and slain all who could carry sword and shield,
  from the stammering boy to the stammering old man! They will hate us
  eternally. And they are right. But we, we are the fools to trust them."</p>

  <p>There ensued a pause; the youth had become very grave, and asked:</p>

  <p>"So thou holdest friendship to be impossible 'twixt them and us?"</p>

  <p>"No peace between the sons of Gaul and the Southern folk! A man enters the
  gold cave of a dragon&mdash;he holds the head of the dragon down with an iron
  fist; the monster begs for life. The man feels compassion because of his
  glittering scales, and feasts his eyes on the treasures of the cavern. What
  will the poisonous reptile do? As soon as he can he will sting him
  stealthily, so that he who spared him dies."</p>

  <p>"Well then, let them come, the despicable Greeks!" shouted the gigantic
  Hildebad; "let the race of vipers dart their forked tongues at us. We will
  beat them down&mdash;so!" And he lifted his club and let it fall heavily, so
  that the marble slab split into pieces, and the old temple resounded with the
  blow.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they shall try!" cried Totila, and from his eyes shone a martial
  fire that made him look still more beautiful; "if these unthankful Romans
  betray us, if the false Byzantines come," he looked with loving pride at his
  strong brother, "see, old man, we have men like oaks!"</p>

  <p>The old master-at-arms nodded, well pleased:</p>

  <p>"Yes, Hildebad is very strong, though not quite as strong as Winither,
  Walamer and others, who were young with me. Against North-men strength is a
  good thing. But this Southern folk," he continued angrily, "fight from towers
  and battlements. They carry on war as they might make a reckoning, and at
  last they reckon a host of heroes into a corner, where they can neither budge
  nor stir. I know one such arithmetician in Byzantium, who is himself no man,
  but conquers men. Thou, too, knowest him, Witichis?" So asking, he turned to
  the man with the sword.</p>

  <p>"I know Narses," answered Witichis reflectively. He had become very grave.
  "What thou hast said, son of Hilding, is, alas! too true. Such thoughts have
  often crossed my mind, but confusedly, darkly, more a horror than a thought.
  Thy words are undeniable; the King is at the point of death&mdash;the
  Princess has Grecian sympathies&mdash;Justinian is on the watch&mdash;the
  Italians are false as serpents&mdash;the generals of Byzantium are magicians
  in art, but"&mdash;here he took a deep breath&mdash;"we Goths do not stand
  alone. Our wise King has made friends and allies in abundance. The King of
  the Vandals is his brother-in-law, the King of the West Goths his grandson,
  the Kings of the Burgundians, the Herulians, the Thuringians, the Franks, are
  related to him; all people honour him as their father; the Sarmatians, even
  the distant Esthonians on the Baltic, send him skins and yellow amber in
  homage. Is all that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All that is nothing! It is flattering words and coloured rags! Will the
  Esthonians help us against Belisarius and Narses with their amber? Woe to us,
  if we cannot win alone! These grandsons and sons-in-law flatter as long as
  they tremble, and when they no more tremble, they will threaten. I know the
  faith of kings! We have enemies around us, open and secret, and no friends
  beyond ourselves."</p>

  <p>A silence ensued, during which all gravely considered the old man's words;
  the storm rushed howling round the weather-beaten columns and shook the
  crumbling temple.</p>

  <p>Then, looking up from the ground, Witichis was the first to speak:</p>

  <p>"The danger is great," said he, firmly and collectedly, "we will hope not
  unavoidable. Certainly thou hast not bidden us hither to look deedless at
  despair. There must be a remedy, so speak; how, thinkest thou, can we
  help?"</p>

  <p>The old man advanced a step towards him and took his hand:</p>

  <p>"That's brave, Witichis, son of Waltari. I knew thee well, and will not
  forget that thou wert the first to speak a word of bold assurance. Yes, I too
  think we are not yet past help, and I have asked you all to come here, where
  no Italian hears us, in order to decide upon what is best to be done. First
  tell me your opinion, then I will speak."</p>

  <p>As all remained silent, he turned to the man with the black locks:</p>

  <p>"If thy thoughts are ours, speak, Teja! Why art thou ever silent?"</p>

  <p>"I am silent because I differ from you."</p>

  <p>The others were amazed. Hildebrand spoke:</p>

  <p>"What dost thou mean, my son?"</p>

  <p>"Hildebad and Totila do not see any danger; thou and Witichis see it and
  hope; but I saw it long ago, and have no hope."</p>

  <p>"Thou seest too darkly; who dare despair before the battle?" said
  Witichis.</p>

  <p>"Shall we perish with our swords in the sheath, without a struggle and
  without fame?" cried Totila.</p>

  <p>"Not without a struggle, my Totila, and not without fame, I am sure,"
  answered Teja, slightly swinging his battle-axe. "We will fight so that it
  shall never be forgotten in all future ages; fight with highest fame, but
  without victory. The star of the Goths is setting."</p>

  <p>"Meseems, on the contrary, that it will rise very high," cried Totila
  impatiently. "Let us go to the King; speak to him, Hildebrand, as thou hast
  spoken to us. He is wise; he will devise means."</p>

  <p>The old man shook his head:</p>

  <p>"I have spoken to him twenty times. He listens no more. He is tired and
  will die, and his soul is darkened, I know not by what shadows. What is thy
  advice, Hildebad?"</p>

  <p>"I think," answered Hildebad, proudly raising his head, "that as soon as
  the old lion has closed his tired eyes, we arm two hosts. Witichis and Teja
  lead the one before Byzantium and burn it down; with the other I and my
  brother climb the Alps and destroy Paris, that dragon's nest of the
  Merovingians, and make it a heap of stones for ever. Then there will be peace
  in East and West."</p>

  <p>"We have no ships against Byzantium," said Witichis.</p>

  <p>"And the Franks are seven to one against us," said Hildebrand. "But thy
  intentions are valiant, Hildebad. Say, what advisest thou, Witichis?"</p>

  <p>"I advise a league&mdash;weighted with oaths, secured with
  hostages&mdash;of all the Northern races against the Greeks."</p>

  <p>"Thou believest in fidelity, because thou thyself art true. My friend,
  only the Goths can help the Goths. But they must be reminded that they
  <i>are</i> Goths. Listen to me. You are all young, love all manner of things,
  and have many pleasures. One loves a woman, another weapons, a third has some
  hope or some grief which is to him as a beloved one. But believe me, a time
  will come&mdash;it may be during your young days&mdash;when all these joys
  and even pains will become worthless as faded wreaths from yesterday's
  banquet.</p>

  <p>"Then many will become soft and pious, forget that which is on earth, and
  strive for that which is beyond the grave. But that neither you nor I can do.
  I love the earth, with mountain and wood and meadow and rushing stream; and I
  love life, with all its hate and long love, its tenacious anger and dumb
  pride. Of the ethereal life in the wind-clouds which is taught by the
  Christian priests, I know, and will know, nothing. But there is one
  possession&mdash;when all else is gone&mdash;which a true man never loses.
  Look at me. I am a leafless trunk. I have lost all that rejoiced my life; my
  wife is dead long since; my sons, my grandchildren are dead: except one, who
  is worse than dead&mdash;who has become an Italian.</p>

  <p>"All, all are gone, and now my first love and last pride, my great King,
  descends tired into his grave. What keeps me still alive? What gives me still
  courage and will? What drives <i>me</i>, an old man, up to this mountain in
  this night of storm like a youth? What glows beneath my icy beard with pure
  love, with stubborn pride, and with defiant sorrow? What but the impulse that
  lies indestructible in our blood, the deep impulsion and attraction to my
  people, the glowing and all-powerful love of the race that is called Goth;
  that speaks the noble, sweet, and homely tongue of my parents! This love of
  race remains like a sacrificial fire in the heart, when all other flames are
  extinguished; this is the highest sentiment of the human heart; the strongest
  power in the human soul, true to the death and invincible!"</p>

  <p>The old man had spoken with enthusiasm&mdash;his hair floated on the
  wind&mdash;he stood like an old priest of the Huns amongst the young men, who
  clenched their hands upon their weapons.</p>

  <p>At last Teja spoke: "Thou art in the right; these flames still glow when
  all else is spent. They burn in thee&mdash;in us&mdash;perhaps in a hundred
  other hearts amongst our brothers; but can this save a whole people? No! And
  can these fires seize the mass, the thousands, the hundred thousands?"</p>

  <p>"They can, my son, they can! Thanks to the gods, that they can!&mdash;Hear
  me. It is now five-and-forty years ago that we Goths, many hundred thousands,
  were shut up with our wives and children in the ravines of the Hæmus. We were
  in the greatest need.</p>

  <p>"The King's brother had been beaten and killed in a treacherous attack by
  the Greeks, and all the provisions that he was to bring to us were lost. We
  lay in the rocky ravines and suffered such hunger, that we cooked grass and
  leather. Behind us rose the inaccessible precipices; before, and to the left
  of us, the sea; to the right, in a narrow pass, lay the enemy, threefold our
  number. Many thousands of us were destroyed by famine or the hardships of the
  winter; twenty times had we vainly tried to break through the pass.</p>

  <p>"We almost despaired. Then there came a messenger from the Emperor to the
  King, and offered us life, freedom, wine, bread, meat&mdash;under one
  condition: that, separated from each other, four by four, we should be
  scattered over the whole Roman Empire; none of us should ever again woo a
  Gothic woman; none should ever again teach his child our tongue or customs;
  the name and being of Goth should cease to exist, we should become
  Romans.</p>

  <p>"The King sprang up, called us together, and reported this condition to us
  in a flaming speech, and asked at the end, whether we would rather give up
  the language, customs and life of our people, or die with him? His words
  spread like wildfire, the people shouted like a hundred-voiced tumultuous
  sea; they brandished their weapons, rushed into the pass; the Greeks were
  swept away as if they had never stood there, and we were victors and
  free!"</p>

  <p>His eyes glittered with pride; after a pause he continued:</p>

  <p>"It is this alone which can save us now as then; if once the Goths feel
  that they fight for their nationality, and to protect the secret jewel that
  lies in the customs and speech of a people, like a miraculous well-spring,
  then they may laugh at the hate of the Greeks and the wiles of the Italians.
  And, first of all, I ask you solemnly: Do you feel as strongly convinced as I
  do, that this love of our people is our highest aim, our dearest treasure,
  our strongest shield? Can you say with me: My people is to me the highest,
  all else is nothing; to my people I will sacrifice all that I have and am.
  Will you say this, and can you do it?"</p>

  <p>"We will; we can!" cried the four men.</p>

  <p>"'Tis well," continued the old man. "But Teja is right, all Goths do not
  feel this as we do, and yet, if it is to be of any use, all <i>must</i> feel
  it. Therefore swear to me, to fill with the spirit of this hour all those
  with whom you live and act, from now henceforward. Too many of our folk have
  been dazzled by the foreign splendour; many have donned Grecian clothing and
  Roman thoughts; they are ashamed to be called barbarians; they wish to
  forget, and to make it forgotten, that they are Goths&mdash;woe to the fools!
  They have torn their hearts out of their bosoms, and yet wish to live; they
  are like leaves that have proudly loosened themselves from the parent stem.
  The wind will come and blow them into the mire and dirt to decay; but the
  stem will still stand in the midst of the storm, and will keep alive whatever
  clings to it faithfully. Therefore awaken and warn the people. Tell the boys
  the legends of their forefathers, relate the battles of the Huns, the
  victories over the Romans; show the men the threatening danger, and that
  nationality alone is our shield; warn your sisters that they may embrace no
  Roman and no would-be Roman; teach your wives and your brides that they must
  sacrifice everything, even themselves and you, to the fortune of the good
  Goths, so that when the enemy come, they may find a strong, proud, united
  people, against which they shall break themselves like waves upon a rock.
  Will you aid me in this?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," they cried, "we will!"</p>

  <p>"I believe you," continued the old man; "I believe you on your mere word.
  Not to bind you faster&mdash;for what can bind the false?&mdash;but because I
  cling to old custom, and because <i>that</i> succeeds best which is done
  after the manner of our forefathers&mdash;follow me."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-2"
     name="b1-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">Hildebrand took the torch from the column, and went across
  the inner space, past the cella of the temple, past the ruined high altar,
  past the bases of the statues of the gods&mdash;long since fallen&mdash;to
  the porticum or back of the edifice. Silently his companions followed the old
  man, who led them down the steps into the open field.</p>

  <p>After a short walk they stopped under an ancient holm, whose mighty boughs
  held off storm and rain like a roof.</p>

  <p>A strange sight presented itself under this oak, which, however, at once
  reminded the old man's Gothic companions of a custom of ancient heathen times
  in their distant Northern home.</p>

  <p>Under the oak a strip of thick turf, only a foot broad, but several yards
  long, had been cut loose from the ground; the two ends of the strip still lay
  in the shallow ditch thus formed, but in the middle it was raised over and
  supported by three long spears of unequal length, which were fixed into the
  ground, the tallest spear being in the middle, so that the whole arrangement
  formed a triangle, under which several men could stand commodiously between
  the shafts of the spears.</p>

  <p>In the ditch stood a brazen cauldron filled with water, near it lay a
  pointed and sharp butcher's knife, of extremely ancient form; the haft was
  made of the horn of the ure-ox, the blade of flint.</p>

  <p>The old man came forward, stuck the torch into the earth close to the
  cauldron, and then stepped, right foot foremost, into the ditch; he turned to
  the east and bent his head, then he beckoned to his friends to join him,
  putting his finger to his lip in sign of silence. Without a sound the four
  men stepped into the ditch beside him, Witichis and Teja to his right, the
  two brothers to his left, and all five joined hands in a solemn chain.</p>

  <p>Then the old man loosened his hands from those of Witichis and Hildebad,
  who stood next to him, and knelt down. First he took up a handful of the
  black mould and threw it over his left shoulder; then he dipped his other
  hand into the cauldron and sprinkled the water to the right behind him. After
  this he blew into the windy night-air that rustled in his long beard; and,
  lastly, he swung the torch from right to left over his head. Then he again
  stuck it into the earth and spoke in murmuring tones:</p>

  <p>"Hear me, ancient earth, welling water, ethereal air, flickering flame!
  Listen to me well and preserve my words. Here stand five men of the race of
  Graut, Teja and Totila, Hildebad and Hildebrand, and Witichis, Waltari's
  son.</p>

  <p>"We stand here in a quiet hour To bind a bond between blood-brethren, For
  ever and ever and every day. In closest communion as kindred companions. In
  friendship and feud, in revenge and right. One hope, one hate, one love, one
  lament, As we drop to one drop Our blood as blood-brethren."</p>

  <p>At these words he bared his left arm, the others did the same; close
  together they stretched their five arms over the cauldron, the old man lifted
  the sharp flint-knife, and with one stroke scratched the skin of his own and
  the others' forearms, so that the blood of all flowed in red drops into the
  brazen cauldron. Then they retook their former positions, and the old man
  continued murmuring:</p>

  <p>"And we swear the solemn oath, To sacrifice all that is ours, House,
  horse, and armour, Court, kindred, and cattle, Wife, weapons, and wares, Son,
  and servants, and body, and life, To the glance and glory of the race of
  Gaut, To the good Goths. And who of us would withdraw From honouring the oath
  with all sacrifices&mdash;"</p>

  <p>here he, and at a sign, the others also, stepped out of the ditch from
  under the strip of turf&mdash;</p>

  <p>"His red blood shall run unrevenged Like this water under the
  wood-sod&mdash;"</p>

  <p>he lifted the cauldron, poured its bloody contents into the ditch, and
  then took it out, together with the other implements&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Upon his head shall the halls of Heaven Crash cumbrous down and crush
  him, Solid as this sod."</p>

  <p>At one stroke he struck down the three supporting lance-shafts, and dully
  fell the heavy turf-roof back into the ditch. The five men now placed
  themselves again on the spot thus covered by the turf, with their hands
  entwined, and the old man said in more rapid tones:</p>

  <p>"Whosoever does not keep this oath; whosoever does not protect his
  blood-brother like his own brother during his life, and revenge his death;
  whosoever refuses to sacrifice everything that he possesses to the people of
  the Goths, when called upon to do so by a brother in case of necessity, shall
  be for ever subject to the eternal and infernal powers which reign under the
  green grass of the earth; good men shall tread with their feet over the
  perjurer's head, and his name shall be without honour wherever Christian folk
  ring bells and heathen folk offer sacrifices, wherever mothers caress their
  children and the wind blows over the wide world. Say, companions, shall it be
  thus with the vile perjurer?"</p>

  <p>"Thus shall it be with him," repeated the four men.</p>

  <p>After a grave pause, Hildebrand loosened the chain of their hands, and
  said:</p>

  <p>"That you may know why I bade you come hither, and how sacred this place
  is to me, come and see."</p>

  <p>With this he lifted the torch and went before them behind the mighty trunk
  of the oak, in front of which they had taken the oath. Silently his friends
  followed, and saw with astonishment, that, exactly in a line with the turfy
  ditch in which they had stood, there yawned a wide and open grave, from which
  the slab of stone had been rolled away. At the bottom, shining ghastly in the
  light of the torch, lay three long white skeletons; a few rusty pieces of
  armour, lance-points, and shield-bosses lay beside them.</p>

  <p>The men looked with surprise; now into the grave, now at Hildebrand. He
  silently held the torch over the chasm for some minutes. At last he said
  quietly:</p>

  <p>"My three sons. They have lain here for more than thirty years. They fell
  on this mountain in the last battle for the city of Ravenna. They fell in the
  same hour; to-day is the day. They rushed with joyous shouts against the
  enemies' spears&mdash;for their people."</p>

  <p>He ceased. The men looked down with emotion. At last the old man drew
  himself up and glanced at the sky.</p>

  <p>"It is enough," said he, "the stars are paling. Midnight is long since
  past. You three return into the city. Thou, Teja, wilt surely remain with me;
  to thee, more than to any other, is given the gift of sorrow, as of song; and
  keep with me the guard of honour beside the dead."</p>

  <p>Teja nodded, and sat down without a word at the foot of the grave, just
  where he was standing. The old man gave Totila the torch, and leaned opposite
  Teja against the stone slab. The other three signed to him with a parting
  gesture. Gravely, and buried in deep thought, they descended to the city.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-3"
     name="b1-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">A few weeks after this midnight meeting near Ravenna an
  assembly took place in Rome; just as secret, also under protection of night,
  but held by very different persons for very different aims.</p>

  <p>It took place on the Appian Way, near the Coemeterium of St. Calixtus, in
  a half-ruined passage of the Catacombs; those mysterious underground ways,
  which almost make a second city under the streets and squares of Rome.</p>

  <p>These secret vaults&mdash;originally old burial-places, often the refuge
  of young Christian communities&mdash;are so intricate, and their crossings,
  terminations, exits, and entrances so difficult to thread, that they can only
  be entered under the guidance of some one intimately acquainted with their
  inner recesses.</p>

  <p>But the men, whose secret intercourse we are about to watch, feared no
  danger. They were well led. For it was Silverius, the Catholic archdeacon of
  the old church of St. Sebastian, who had led his friends direct from the
  crypt of his basilica down a steep staircase into this branch of the vaults;
  and the Roman priests had the reputation of having studied the windings of
  these labyrinths since the days of the first confessor.</p>

  <p>The persons assembled also seemed not to have met there for the first
  time; the gloom of the place made little impression upon them. Indifferently
  they leaned against the walls of the dismal semi-circular room, which,
  scantily lighted by a hanging lamp of bronze, formed the termination of the
  low passage. Indifferently they heard the drops of damp fall from the roof to
  the floor, or, when their feet now and then struck against white and
  mouldering bones, they calmly pushed them to one side.</p>

  <p>Besides Silverius, there were present a few other orthodox priests, and a
  number of aristocratic Romans, nobles of the Western Empire, who had remained
  for centuries in almost hereditary possession of the higher dignities of the
  state and city.</p>

  <p>Silently and attentively they observed the movements of the archdeacon;
  who, after having mustered those present, and thrown several searching
  glances into the neighbouring passages&mdash;where might be seen, keeping
  watch in the gloom, some youths in clerical costume&mdash;now evidently
  prepared to open the assembly in form.</p>

  <p>Yet once again he went up to a tall man who leaned motionless against the
  wall opposite to him, and with whom he had repeatedly exchanged glances; and
  when this man had replied to a questioning gesture by a silent nod, he turned
  to the others and spoke.</p>

  <p>"Beloved in the name of the triune God! Once again are we assembled here
  to do a holy work. The sword of Edom is brandished over our heads, and King
  Pharaoh pants for the blood of the children of Israel. We, however, do not
  fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul, we fear much more
  those who may destroy both body and soul in hell-fire. We trust, during the
  terrors of night, to His help who led His people through the wilderness, in
  the day by a cloud of smoke, at night by a pillar of fire. And to this we
  will hold fast: that what we suffer, we suffer for God's sake; what we do, we
  do to the honour of His name. Thanks to Him, for He has blest our zeal. Small
  as those of the Gospel were our beginnings, but we are already grown like a
  tree by the fresh water-springs. With fear and trembling we first assembled
  here; great was our danger, weak our hope; noble blood of the best has been
  shed; to-day, if we remain firm in faith, we may boldly say that the throne
  of King Pharaoh is supported on reeds, and that the days of the heathen are
  counted in the land."</p>

  <p>"To business!" interrupted a young man with short curly black hair and
  brilliant black eyes. Impatiently he threw his <i>sagum</i> (or short cloak)
  back over his right shoulder, so that his broad sword became visible. "To
  business, priest! What shall be done to-night?"</p>

  <p>Silverius cast a look at the youth, which, with all its unctuous repose,
  could not quite conceal his lively dissatisfaction at such bold independence.
  In a sharp tone of voice he continued:</p>

  <p>"Those who do not believe in the holiness of our aim, should not, were it
  only for the sake of their own worldly aims, try to disturb the belief of
  others in its sanctity. But to-night, my Licinius, my hasty young friend, a
  new and highly welcome member is to be added to our league; his accession is
  a visible sign of the grace of God."</p>

  <p>"Who will you introduce? Are the conditions fulfilled? Do you answer for
  him unconditionally, or have you other surety?" So asked another of those
  present, a man of ripe years with regular features, who, a staff between his
  feet, sat quietly on a projection of the wall.</p>

  <p>"I answer for him, my Scævola; besides, his person? is
  sufficient&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort. The statutes of our league demand surety, and I
  insist upon it," said Scævola quietly.</p>

  <p>"Good, good; I will be surety, toughest of all jurists!" repeated the
  priest with a smile.</p>

  <p>He made a sign towards one of the passages to the left.</p>

  <p>From thence appeared two young <i>ostiarii</i> (doorkeepers), leading a
  man into the middle of the vault, upon whose covered head all eyes were
  fixed. After a pause, Silverius lifted the cover from the head and shoulders
  of the new comer.</p>

  <p>"Albinus!" cried the others, in surprise, indignation, and anger.</p>

  <p>Young Licinius grasped his sword; Scævola slowly rose; confused
  exclamations sounded from all sides.</p>

  <p>"What! Albinus, the traitor?"</p>

  <p>The reviled man looked shyly about him; his relaxed features announced
  inborn cowardice; as if beseeching help he turned his eyes towards the
  priest.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Albinus!" said the latter quietly, thus appealed to. "Will any one
  of the colleagues speak against him? Let him speak."</p>

  <p>"By my Genius!" cried Licinius, before any one could reply, "needs it to
  be told? We all know who and what Albinus is. A cowardly shameful
  traitor"&mdash;anger suffocated his voice.</p>

  <p>"Invectives are no proof," interposed Scævola. "But I ask himself; he
  shall confess here before us all. Albinus, was it you, or was it not, who,
  when the existence of our league was betrayed to the tyrant and you alone
  were accused, looked quietly on and saw the noble Boëthius and Symmachus, our
  confederates, because they defended you against the tyrant, despoiled of
  their fortune, persecuted, taken prisoners and executed; while you, the
  really accused, saved yourself by taking a shameful oath that you would never
  more trouble yourself about the state, and by suddenly disappearing? Speak,
  was it you for whose sake the pride of our fatherland fell?"</p>

  <p>A murmur of indignation went through the assembly. The accused remained
  dumb and trembled; even Silverius lost countenance for a moment.</p>

  <p>Then the man who was leaning against the wall opposite, raised himself and
  took a step forward; his mere vicinity seemed to embolden the priest, who
  again began:</p>

  <p>"Friends, what you say has happened, but not as you say it. Before all
  things, know this: Albinus is the <i>least</i> to blame. What he did, he did
  by my advice."</p>

  <p>"By your advice!"</p>

  <p>"You dare to confess it?"</p>

  <p>"Albinus was accused through the treachery of a slave, who had deciphered
  the secret writing in the letters to Byzantium. All the tyrant's suspicion
  was aroused; every appearance of resistance or of connection would increase
  the danger. The impetuosity of Boëthius and Symmachus, who courageously
  defended Albinus, was noble but foolish, for it revealed to the barbarians
  the sentiments of the whole of the Roman aristocracy; and showed that Albinus
  did not stand alone. They acted against my advice, and alas! have suffered
  death for so doing. But their zeal was superfluous; for the hand of the Lord
  suddenly bereft the slave of life before further revelations, and the secret
  writings of Albinus had been successfully destroyed before his arrest.</p>

  <p>"But do you believe that Albinus would have been silent under torture,
  under the threat of death, if naming his co-conspirators could have saved
  him? You do not believe it, Albinus himself did not believe it. Therefore it
  was necessary, before all else, to gain time and to prevent the use of
  torture. This was accomplished by his oath. Meanwhile, it is true, Boëthius
  and Symmachus suffered; they could not be saved; but of their silence, even
  under torture, we were sure.</p>

  <p>"Albinus was freed from his prison by a miracle, like St. Paul at
  Philippi. It was said that he had escaped to Athens, and the tyrant was
  contented with prohibiting his return. But the triune God has prepared a
  refuge for him here in His temple until the hour of freedom approaches. In
  the solitude of His sacred asylum the Lord has touched his heart in a
  wonderful manner, and, undismayed by the danger of death, which once before
  had so nearly overtaken him, he again enters into our circle, and offers to
  the service of God and the fatherland his whole immense fortune. Listen: he
  has made over all his property to the church of St. Maria Majoris for the
  uses of our league. Would you despise him and his millions?"</p>

  <p>A pause of astonishment ensued; at last Licinius cried:</p>

  <p>"Priest, you are as wise as&mdash;&mdash;as a priest. But such wisdom
  pleases me not."</p>

  <p>"Silverius," said the jurist, "you may take the millions. It is fitting
  that you should do so. But I was the friend of Boëthius; it is not fitting
  that I should have anything in common with that coward. I cannot forgive him.
  Away with him!"</p>

  <p>"Away with him!" sounded from all sides. Scævola had given utterance to
  the sentiment of all present. Albinus grew pale; even Silverius quailed under
  this general indignation. "Cethegus!" whispered he, claiming assistance.</p>

  <p>This man, who, until now, had remained silent and had only regarded the
  speakers with cool superiority, now stepped into the middle of the
  assembly.</p>

  <p>He was tall and lean, but powerful, with a broad breast and muscles of
  pure steel.</p>

  <p>A purple hem on his toga and delicate sandals betrayed riches, rank and
  taste, but a long brown soldier's mantle hid the remainder of his
  underclothing. His head was one of those which, once seen, are never again
  forgotten. His thick and still glossy black hair was cut short, after Roman
  fashion, round his lofty, almost too prominent forehead and nobly-formed
  temples. Deep under his finely-arched brows were hidden his narrow eyes, in
  whose undecided dark-grey colour lay a whole ocean of sunken passions and a
  still more pronounced expression of the coolest self-control. Round his
  sharply cut and beardless lips lurked a trait of proud contempt of God and
  His whole creation.</p>

  <p>As he stepped forward, and, with quiet distinction, allowed his eyes to
  wander over the excited assembly; as he commenced his insinuating yet
  commanding speech, every one felt his superiority, and few could remain in
  his presence without a consciousness of subordination.</p>

  <p>"Why do you wrangle," he said coldly, "about things that must be done? Who
  wills the end, must will the means. You will not forgive? As you please! That
  is of little consequence. But you must and you can forget. I also was a
  friend of the dead, perhaps their dearest. And yet&mdash;I will forget. I do
  so just because I was their friend. <i>He</i> loves them, Scævola, and he
  alone, who avenges them. For the sake of revenge&mdash;&mdash; Albinus, your
  hand!"</p>

  <p>All were silent, awed more by the personality than convinced by the
  reasons of the speaker.</p>

  <p>But the jurist still objected:</p>

  <p>"Rusticiana, the influential woman, the widow of Boëthius, the daughter of
  Symmachus, is favourable to our league. Will she remain so if this man enters
  it? Can she ever forget and forgive? Never!"</p>

  <p>"She can. Do not believe me, believe your eyes."</p>

  <p>With these words Cethegus quickly turned and entered one of the
  side-passages, whose opening had been hidden until now by his own person.</p>

  <p>Close to the entrance a veiled figure stood listening; he caught her
  hand:</p>

  <p>"Come," whispered he, "come now."</p>

  <p>"I cannot! I will not!" was the almost inaudible answer of the resisting
  woman. "I curse him! I cannot look at him, the wretch!"</p>

  <p>"It must be. Come; you can and you shall&mdash;for I will have it so." He
  threw back her veil; one look, and she followed as if deprived of the power
  of will.</p>

  <p>They turned the corner of the entrance:</p>

  <p>"Rusticiana!" cried the whole assembly.</p>

  <p>"A woman in our meeting!" exclaimed the jurist. "It is against the
  statutes, the laws."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Scævola; but the laws are made for the league, not the league for
  the laws. And you would never have believed from <i>me</i>, that which you
  now see with your own eyes."</p>

  <p>He laid the widow's hand within the trembling right hand of Albinus.</p>

  <p>"Look! Rusticiana forgives! Who will now resist?"</p>

  <p>Vanquished and overruled, all remained silent. For Cethegus all further
  proceedings seemed to have lost interest. He retired into the background with
  Rusticiana. But the priest now said:</p>

  <p>"Albinus is a member of the league."</p>

  <p>"And the oath that he swore to the tyrant?" hesitatingly asked
  Scævola.</p>

  <p>"Was forced, and he is absolved from it by Holy Church. But now it is time
  to depart. Let us only conclude the most pressing business. Here, Licinius,
  is the plan of the fortress of Neapolis: you must have it copied by
  to-morrow; it goes to Belisarius. Here, Scævola, letters from Byzantium, from
  Theodora, the pious wife of Justinian: you must answer them. Here,
  Calpurnius, is an assignment of half a million <i>solidi</i> from Albinus:
  you will send them to the Frankish major domus; he has great influence with
  his king. Here, Pomponius, is a list of the patriots in Dalmatia; you know
  men and things there, take notice if important names are omitted. And be it
  known to all of you, that, according to news received to-day from Ravenna,
  the hand of the Lord lies heavy on the tyrant. Deep melancholy, too tardy
  remorse for all his sins, oppresses him, and the consolations of the true
  faith have not yet penetrated into his soul. Have patience but a little
  while; the angry voice of the Judge will soon summon him; then comes the day
  of freedom. At the next Ides, at the same hour, we shall meet here again. The
  blessing of the Lord be with you!"</p>

  <p>A motion of his hand dismissed the assembly; the young priests came out of
  the side-passage with torches, and led the members, each one singly, in
  different directions, to the secret exits of the Catacombs.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-4"
     name="b1-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">Silverius, Cethegus, and Rusticiana went together up the
  steps which led to the crypt of the basilica of St. Sebastian. From thence
  they passed through the church into the adjoining house of the archdeacon. On
  arriving there, Silverius convinced himself that all the inhabitants of the
  house were asleep, with the exception of an old slave, who was watching in
  the atrium near a half-extinguished lamp. At a sign from his master he
  lighted a silver lamp which stood near him, and pressed a secret spring in
  the marble wainscot of the room.</p>

  <p>A slab of marble turned on its hinges and allowed the priest who had taken
  up the lamp to pass, with his two companions, into a small, low chamber, and
  then quickly and noiselessly closed behind them, leaving no trace of an
  opening.</p>

  <p>The small chamber, now simply adorned by a tall wooden crucifix, a
  fall-stool, and a few plain Christian symbols on a golden background, had
  evidently, as the cushioned shelf which ran round the walls showed, served
  for those small banquets of one or two guests, whose unrestrained comfort
  Horace has so often celebrated in song. At the time of which I speak it was
  the private chamber in which the archdeacon brooded over his most secret
  priestly or worldly plans.</p>

  <p>Cethegus silently seated himself on the <i>lectus</i> (a small couch),
  throwing the superficial glance of a critic at a Mosaic picture inserted into
  the opposite wall. While the priest was occupied in pouring wine from an
  amphora with large curving handles into some cups which stood ready, and
  placing a metal dish of fruit on the bronze tripod table, Rusticiana stood
  opposite Cethegus, measuring him with an expression of astonishment and
  indignation.</p>

  <p>Scarcely forty years of age, this woman showed traces of a rare&mdash;and
  rather manly&mdash;beauty, which had suffered less from time than from
  violent passions. Here and there her raven-black braids were streaked with
  white, not grey, and strong lines lay round the mobile corners of her
  mouth.</p>

  <p>She leaned her left hand on the table, and meditatively stroked her brow
  with her right, while she gazed at Cethegus. At last she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, tell me, Cethegus, what power is this that you have over me? I
  no more love you. I ought to hate you. I do hate you. And yet I must
  involuntarily obey you, like a bird under the fascinating eye of a snake. And
  you place my hand, <i>this</i> hand, in that of that miserable man! Say, you
  evil-doer, what is this power?"</p>

  <p>Cethegus was inattentively silent. At last, leaning back, he said: "Habit,
  Rusticiana, habit."</p>

  <p>"Truly, 'tis habit! The habit of a slavery that has existed ever since I
  can remember. It was natural that as a girl I should admire the handsome son
  of our neighbours; that I believed in your love was excusable, did you not
  kiss me? And who could&mdash;at that time&mdash;know that you were incapable
  of loving anything&mdash;even yourself? That the wife of Boëthius did not
  smother the mad passion which, as if in sport, you again fanned into a flame,
  was a sin; but God and the Church have forgiven it. But that I should still,
  after knowing for years your utter heartlessness, when the glow of passion is
  extinguished in my veins, that I should still most blindly follow your
  demoniac will&mdash;that is folly enough to make me laugh aloud."</p>

  <p>And she laughed wildly, and pressed her right hand to her brow.</p>

  <p>The priest stopped in his domestic occupations and looked stealthily at
  Cethegus. He was intensely interested.</p>

  <p>Cethegus leaned his head back against the marble moulding, and with his
  right hand grasped the drinking-cup which stood before him.</p>

  <p>"You are unjust, Rusticiana," he said quietly, "and confused. You mix the
  sports of Eros with the works of Eris and the Fates. You know that I was the
  friend of Boëthius, although I kissed his wife. Perhaps just for that reason.
  I see nothing particular in that. And you&mdash;well, Silverius and the
  saints have forgiven you. You know further, that I hate these Goths, mortally
  hate them; that I have the will and&mdash;more than all others&mdash;the
  power to carry through that which is now your greatest wish, to revenge your
  father, whom you loved, and your husband, whom you honoured, on these
  barbarians.</p>

  <p>"Therefore you obey my instigations, and you are wise in so doing; for you
  have a decided talent for intrigue, but your impetuosity often clouds your
  judgment. It spoils your finest plans. Therefore it is well that you follow
  cooler guidance. That is all. But now go. Your slave is crouching, drunk with
  sleep, in the vestibule. She believes that you are in the confessional with
  friend Silverius. The confession must not last too long. And we also have
  business to transact. Greet Camilla, your lovely child, for me, and
  farewell."</p>

  <p>He rose, took her hand, and led her gently to the door. She followed
  reluctantly, nodded to the priest at parting, looked once more at Cethegus,
  who appeared not to observe her inward emotion, and went out, slightly
  shaking her head.</p>

  <p>Cethegus sat down again and emptied his cup of wine.</p>

  <p>"A strange struggle in this woman's nature," remarked Silverius, and sat
  down by Cethegus with stylus, wax-tablets, letters and documents.</p>

  <p>"It is not strange. She wishes to atone for having wronged her husband by
  avenging him," said Cethegus. "And that she can accomplish this by means of
  her former lover, makes the sacred duty doubly sweet. To be sure, she is not
  conscious of it.&mdash;But what have we to do?"</p>

  <p>The two men now began their business: to consider such points of the
  conspiracy as they did not judge advisable to communicate to all the members
  of the league.</p>

  <p>"At present," began the archdeacon, "it is above all things necessary to
  ascertain the amount of this fortune of Albinus, and decide upon its
  appropriation. We assuredly require money, much money."</p>

  <p>"Money affairs are your province,"&mdash;said Cethegus, drinking. "I
  understand them, of course, but they annoy me."</p>

  <p>"Further," continued Silverius, "the most influential men in Sicilia,
  Neapolis, and Apulia must be won over to our cause. Here is the list of their
  names, with notes annexed. There are men amongst them who are not to be
  allured by the usual means."</p>

  <p>"Give it to me," said Cethegus, "I will manage that," And he cut up a
  Persian apple.</p>

  <p>After an hour's hard work, the most pressing business was settled, and the
  host replaced the documents, in a secret drawer in the wall behind the
  crucifix.</p>

  <p>The priest was tired, and looked with envy at his companion, whose
  powerful frame and indefatigable spirit no late hours or exertion seemed able
  to exhaust.</p>

  <p>He expressed something of the sort, as Cethegus again filled the silver
  cup.</p>

  <p>"Practice, friend, strong nerves, and," added Cethegus, smiling, "a good
  conscience; that is the whole secret."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but in earnest, Cethegus, you are a riddle to me in other
  respects."</p>

  <p>"I should hope so."</p>

  <p>"Oh ho! do you consider yourself such a superior being that I cannot
  fathom you?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. But still sufficiently deep to be to others no less a riddle
  than&mdash;to myself. Your pride in your knowledge of mankind may be at ease.
  I am no wiser about myself than you are. Only fools are transparent."</p>

  <p>"In fact," said the priest, expatiating on the subject, "the key to your
  nature must be difficult to find. For example, look at the members of our
  league. It is easy to say what motives have led them to join us. The hot
  young courage of a Licinius; the pig-headed but honest sense of justice of a
  Scævola; as for myself and the other priests&mdash;our zeal for the honour of
  God."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Cethegus, drinking.</p>

  <p>"Others are induced by ambition, or are in hopes that they may cut off the
  heads of their creditors in a civil war; or they are tired of the orderly
  condition of this country under the Goths, or have been offended by one of
  these foreigners. Most of them have a natural repugnance to the barbarians,
  and are in the habit of seeing in the Emperor alone the master of Italy. But
  none of these reasons apply to you, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And," interrupted Cethegus, "that is very uncomfortable, is it not? For
  by knowledge of their motives one can govern men. Well, I am sorry, reverend
  friend, but I cannot help you. I really do not know myself what my motive is.
  I am so curious about it, that I would gladly tell it to you&mdash;and allow
  myself to be governed&mdash;if I could only find it out. Only one thing I
  feel&mdash;that these Goths are my antipathy. I hate these full-blooded
  fellows, with their broad flaxen beards. I cannot bear their brutal good
  humour, their ingenuous youthfulness, their stupid heroism, their unbroken
  natures. It is the impudence of chance, which governs the world, that this
  country, after such a history, possessing men like&mdash;like you and
  me&mdash;should be ruled by these Northern bears!"</p>

  <p>He tossed his head indignantly, closed his eyes, and sipped a small
  quantity of wine.</p>

  <p>"That the barbarians must go, we are agreed," said Silverius, "and with
  this, all is gained as far as I am concerned. For I only await the
  deliverance of the Church from these heretical barbarians, who deny the
  divinity of Christ, and make Him a demi-god. I hope that the primacy of all
  Christendom will, as is fitting, incontestably fall to the share of the Roman
  Church. But as long as Rome is in the power of the heretics, while the Bishop
  of Byzantium is supported by the only orthodox and legitimate
  Emperor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Bishop of Rome cannot be the first Bishop of Christendom, nor the
  master of Italy; and therefore the Roman Apostolic See, even when occupied by
  a Silverius, cannot be what it ought to be&mdash;the highest. And yet that is
  what Silverius wishes."</p>

  <p>The priest looked up in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Do not be uneasy, reverend friend. I knew this long ago, and have kept
  your secret, although you did not confide it to me. But
  further&mdash;&mdash;" He again filled his cup. "Your Falernian has been well
  stored, but it is too sweet.&mdash;Properly speaking, you can but wish that
  these Goths may evacuate the throne of the Cæsars, and not that the
  Byzantines should take their place; for in that case the Bishop of Rome would
  have again a superior bishop and an emperor in Byzantium. You must therefore,
  instead of the Goths, wish&mdash;not for an
  Emperor&mdash;Justinian&mdash;but&mdash;what else?"</p>

  <p>"Either," eagerly interrupted Silverius, "a special Emperor of the Western
  Empire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who, however," said Cethegus, completing the sentence, "would be only a
  puppet in the hands of the holy Petrus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or a Roman republic, a State of the Church&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In which the Bishop of Rome is master, Italy the principal country, and
  the barbarian kings in Gaul, Germany, and Spain the obedient sons of the
  Church. All very fine, my friend. But first the enemy must be annihilated,
  whose spoils you already divide. Therefore let us drink an old Roman toast:
  'Woe to the barbarians!'"</p>

  <p>He rose and drank to the priest.</p>

  <p>"But," he added, "the last night-watch creeps on, and my slaves must find
  me in the morning in my bedchamber. Farewell!"</p>

  <p>With this he drew the <i>cucullus</i> (hood) of his mantle over his head
  and departed.</p>

  <p>His host looked after him. "A very important tool!" he said to himself.
  "It is a good thing that he is only a tool. May he always remain so!"</p>

  <p>Cethegus walked away from the Via Appia in a north-westerly direction,
  towards the Capitol, beneath which, at the northern end of the Via Sacra, his
  house was situated, to the north-east of the Forum Romanum.</p>

  <p>The cool morning air played refreshingly over his brow. He threw open his
  mantle and deeply inflated his strong broad chest.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am a riddle," he said to himself. "I join in a conspiracy and go
  about by night, like a republican or a lover at twenty. And wherefore? Who
  knows why he breathes? Because he must. And so I do what I must. But one
  thing is certain, this priest may&mdash;perhaps must&mdash;become Pope; but
  he must not remain so long, else farewell my scarcely-avowed thoughts, which
  are yet but dreams and cloud-mists. Perhaps it may be that from them will
  arise a storm that will decide my fate. See, it lightens in the east! 'Tis
  well; I accept the omen!"</p>

  <p>With these words he entered his house.</p>

  <p>In his bed-chamber he found a letter on the cedar table before his bed,
  tied with a silken string, and sealed with the royal seal. He cut the string
  with his dagger, opened the double waxen tablets, and read:</p>

  <p>"To Cethegus Cæsarius, the Princeps Senatus, Marcus Aurelius Cassiodorus,
  Senator.</p>

  <p>"Our lord and king lies on his death-bed. His daughter and heiress,
  Amalaswintha, wishes to speak with you before his end.</p>

  <p>"You are to undertake the most important office in the kingdom.</p>

  <p>"Hasten at once to Ravenna."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-5"
     name="b1-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">Over the King's palace at Ravenna, with all its gloomy
  splendour and inhospitable spaciousness, lay an air of breathless
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>The old castle of the Cæsars had suffered many disfiguring changes in the
  course of centuries, and since the Gothic kings, with all their Germanic
  courtiers, had taken the place of the emperors, it had assumed a very
  inharmonious aspect, for many chambers, intended for the peculiar customs of
  Roman life, stood, still retaining the old magnificence of their
  arrangements, unused and neglected. Cobwebs covered the mosaic of the rich
  baths of Honorius, and in the toilet-chamber of Placidia the lizards climbed
  over the marble frames of the silver mirrors on the walls. On the one side,
  the necessities of a more warlike court had obliged the removal of many
  walls, in order to change the small rooms of the ancient building into wider
  halls for arsenals, banqueting and guard-rooms, and, on the other,
  neighbouring houses had been joined to the palace by new walls, so as to
  create a stronghold in the middle of the city.</p>

  <p>In the dried-up <i>piscina maxima</i> (large fish-pond) fair-haired boys
  now romped, and in the marble halls of the <i>palæstra</i>[1] neighed the
  horses of the Gothic guards. So the extensive edifice had the dismal
  appearance partly of a scarcely-preserved ruin, and partly of a half-finished
  new erection; and thus the palace of the present ruler seemed a symbol of his
  Roman-Gothic kingdom, and of his whole half-finished, half-decayed political
  creation.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[1. A place for wrestling and other exercises.]</p>

  <p>On the day, however, on which Cethegus, after years of absence, once again
  entered the house, there lay heavy upon it a cloud of anxiety, sorrow and
  gloom, for its royal soul was departing from it.</p>

  <p>The great man, who here had guided, for the space of a man's life, the
  fate of Europe; who was wondered at, with love or with hate, by West and by
  East; the hero of his age; the powerful Theodoric of Verona, of whose
  name&mdash;even during his lifetime&mdash;Legend had possessed herself; the
  great Amelung, King Theodoric, was about to die.</p>

  <p>So said the physicians&mdash;if not to himself, yet to his nearest
  relations&mdash;and the report soon spread in the great and populous
  city.</p>

  <p>Although such an end to the secret sufferings of the aged King had been
  long held possible, the news that the blow was at hand now filled all hearts
  with the greatest excitement.</p>

  <p>The faithful Goths were anxious and grieved, and a dull fear was the
  predominating feeling even of the Roman population, for here in Ravenna, in
  the immediate vicinity of the King, the Italians had had frequent
  opportunities of admiring his mildness and generosity, and of experiencing
  his beneficence.</p>

  <p>And besides, it was feared that after the death of this King, who, during
  his lifetime&mdash;with the single exception of the last contest with the
  Emperor and the Senate, when Boëthius and Symmachus bled&mdash;had protected
  the Italians from the harshness and violence of his people&mdash;a new rule
  of severity and oppression would commence on the part of the Goths.</p>

  <p>And, finally, another and more noble influence was at work; the
  personality of this hero-King had been so grand, so majestic, that even those
  who had often wished for the destruction of himself and his kingdom, could
  not&mdash;at the moment when this luminary was about to be
  extinguished&mdash;revel in a feeling of malicious joy, and were unable to
  overcome a deep depression.</p>

  <p>So, since early morning&mdash;when servants from the palace had been seen
  rushing in all directions, and special messengers hurrying to the houses of
  the most distinguished Goths and Romans&mdash;the town had been in a state of
  great excitement.</p>

  <p>Men stood together by pairs or in groups in the streets, squares and
  baths, questioning or imparting to each other what they knew; trying to
  detain some person of importance who came from the palace, and talking of the
  grave consequences of the approaching catastrophe. Women and children, urged
  by curiosity, crouched on the thresholds of the houses.</p>

  <p>As the day advanced, even the populations of the nearest towns and
  villages&mdash;principally consisting of sorrowing Goths&mdash;streamed into
  the gates of the city to hear the news.</p>

  <p>The counsellors of the King, pre-eminently the pretorian prefect,
  Cassiodorus, who earned great praise for preserving order in those days, had
  foreseen this excitement, and perhaps expected something worse.</p>

  <p>At midnight all the entrances to the palace had been closed, and guarded
  by Goths. In the Forum Honorum, before the palace, a troop of cavalry had
  been placed. On the broad marble steps that led up to the grand colonnade of
  the principal entrance, lay, in picturesque groups, strong companies of
  Gothic foot-soldiers, armed with shield and spear.</p>

  <p>Only there, according to the order of Cassiodorus, could admittance be
  gained to the palace, and only the two leaders of the infantry&mdash;Cyprian,
  the Roman, and Witichis, the Goth, were allowed to grant permission to
  enter.</p>

  <p>It was to the first of these persons that Cethegus applied.</p>

  <p>As he took the well-known way to the King's apartments, he found all the
  Goths and Romans whose rank or importance had procured them admittance,
  scattered in groups about the halls and corridors.</p>

  <p>In the once noisy banqueting-hall the young leaders of the Gothic hundreds
  and thousands stood together, silent and sorrowing, or whispering their
  anxious inquiries, while here and there an elderly man&mdash;a
  companion-at-arms of the dying hero&mdash;leaned in the niche of a
  bow-window, seeking to hide his ungovernable sorrow. In the middle of the
  hall stood&mdash;pressing his head against a pillar and weeping
  loudly&mdash;a rich merchant of Ravenna. The King, now on the point of death,
  had once pardoned him for joining in a conspiracy, and had prevented his
  goods from being plundered by the enraged Goths.</p>

  <p>Cethegus passed by them all with a cold glance of contempt.</p>

  <p>In the next room&mdash;a saloon intended for the reception of foreign
  embassies&mdash;he found a number of distinguished Goths&mdash;dukes, earls,
  and other nobles&mdash;who evidently were assembled together to consult upon
  the succession, and the threatened overthrow of all existing conditions.</p>

  <p>There was the brave Duke Thulun, who had heroically defended the town of
  Arles against the Franks; Ibba, the conqueror of Spain; and Pitza, who had
  been victorious over the Bulgarians and Gepidians&mdash;all mighty warriors,
  proud of their nobility, which was little less than that of the royal house
  of Amelung; for they were of the house of Balthe, which, through Alaric, had
  won the crown of the Visigoths; and no less proud of their services in war,
  which had protected and extended the kingdom.</p>

  <p>Hildebad and Teja were with them. They were the leaders of the party which
  had long since desired a more severe treatment of the Italians, whom they at
  once hated and shunned; but had been forced, against their will, to give way
  to the milder opinions of the King.</p>

  <p>What looks of hatred shot from their eyes upon the aristocratic Roman who
  now came to witness the death of the great Gothic hero!</p>

  <p>Cethegus walked quietly past them, and lifted the heavy woollen curtain
  that divided this from the next apartment&mdash;the ante-chamber of the
  sick-room.</p>

  <p>On entering, he greeted with a profound inclination a tall and queenly
  woman, enveloped in a black mourning veil, who, grave and silent, but
  composed and without tears, stood before a marble table covered with records.
  It was Amalaswintha, the widowed daughter of Theodoric.</p>

  <p>A woman above thirty years of age, she was still extremely, though coldly,
  beautiful. She wore her rich dark hair parted and waved in the fashion of the
  Greeks. Her high forehead, her large, open eyes, her straight nose, the pride
  expressed in her almost manly features, and the majesty of her full form,
  gave her an imposing dignity, and, clad in a garment folded in true Grecian
  style, she resembled a Juno of Polycletus which had descended from its
  pedestal. Her arm, more supporting than supported, was laid within that of a
  youth of about seventeen years of age&mdash;Athalaric, her son, the heir of
  the kingdom of the Goths.</p>

  <p>He did not resemble his mother, but had the nature of his unhappy father,
  Eutharic, whom a wasting heart disease had hurried to the grave in the bloom
  of life. For this reason, Amalaswintha saw with sorrow that her son grew
  daily more like his father; and it was no longer a secret at the court of
  Ravenna that all the signs of the disease were already visible in the young
  man.</p>

  <p>Athalaric was as beautiful as all the other members of this royal house,
  descended from the gods. Heavy black eyebrows and long eyelashes shaded his
  beautiful dark eyes, that now melted with an expression of dreamy reverie,
  and now flashed with intellectual brilliancy. Dark brown tangled locks hung
  over his pale temples, on which, when he was excited, the blue veins swelled
  convulsively. On his noble brow physical pain or sad resignation had traced
  deep lines, strange to see on his youthful countenance. Marble paleness and
  vivid red quickly alternated in his transparent cheeks. His tall but
  bent-frame generally seemed to hang, so to speak, on its hinges, as if tired,
  and only at times he drew himself up with startling suddenness.</p>

  <p>He did not notice Cethegus, for, leaning on his mother's breast, he had in
  his sadness flung his Grecian mantle over that young head, which was soon
  destined to wear a crown.</p>

  <p>At some distance from these two figures, near an open window that afforded
  a view of the marble steps upon which lay the Gothic warriors, stood, lost in
  thought, a woman&mdash;or was it a girl?&mdash;of surprising and dazzling
  beauty; it was Mataswintha, the sister of Athalaric.</p>

  <p>She resembled her mother in height and nobleness of form, but her more
  sharply-cut features were filled with fiery and passionate life, which was
  only slightly concealed under an aspect of artificial coldness.</p>

  <p>Her figure, in which blooming fulness and delicate slenderness were
  harmoniously blended, reminded one of that Artemis in the arms of Endymion,
  in the group sculptured by Agesander, which, as legend reports, was banished
  from the town by the Council of Rhodes because the marble representation of
  the most perfect maidenly beauty and highest sensuousness had driven the
  youths of the island to madness and suicide. The magic of ripe virgin beauty
  trembled over the whole form of Mataswintha. Her rich waving hair was of a
  dark-red colour, with a glimmering metallic light upon it, and had such an
  extraordinary effect that it had procured for the Princess, even amongst her
  own nation, whose women were celebrated for their splendid golden locks, the
  appellation of "Beautiful-hair." Her nose was finely-shaped, with
  delicately-chiselled nostrils, which quivered at the slightest emotion; and
  freshly bloomed the full and rosy lips of her lovely mouth. But the most
  striking feature of this extraordinary beauty was the grey eye, not so much
  on account of its changing colour as from the wonderful expression with
  which, though generally lost in reverie, it could sometimes flash with
  burning passion.</p>

  <p>Indeed, as she stood there leaning against the window, in the
  half-Hellenic, half-Gothic costume, which her fancy had combined, her full
  white arm wound round the dark column of porphyry, and gazing thoughtfully
  out into the evening air, her seductive beauty resembled that of those
  irresistible wood or water-nymphs, whose enchanting power of love has always
  been celebrated in Northern legend.</p>

  <p>And so great was the power of this beauty, that even the burnt-out bosom
  of Cethegus, who had long known the Princess, was moved to new admiration as
  he entered.</p>

  <p>But his attention was immediately claimed by Cassiodorus&mdash;the learned
  and faithful minister of the King, the first representative of that
  benevolent but hopeless policy of reconciliation, which had been practised in
  the Gothic Kingdom for many years&mdash;who was standing near
  Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>This old man, whose venerable and mild features were no less filled with
  an expression of sorrow at the loss of his royal friend than by anxiety for
  the future of the kingdom, rose, and went with tottering steps towards
  Cethegus, who reverently bent his head.</p>

  <p>The aged man's eyes rested upon him for some moments, swimming in tears;
  at last he sank sighing upon the cold breast of Cethegus, who despised him
  for this weakness.</p>

  <p>"What a day!" complained Cassiodorus.</p>

  <p>"A fateful day," said Cethegus gravely. "Strength and presence of mind are
  necessary."</p>

  <p>"You say truly, patrician, and speak like a Roman," said the Princess,
  leaving Athalaric&mdash;"welcome!"</p>

  <p>She gave him her hand, which did not tremble. Her eye was clear and
  tearless.</p>

  <p>"The disciple of the Stoics preserves, even on this day, the wisdom of
  Zeno and her own composure," said Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"Say, rather, that the grace of God wonderfully upholds her soul," said
  Cassiodorus reprovingly.</p>

  <p>"Patrician," began Amalaswintha, "the prætorian prefect has proposed you
  to me for the performance of an important business. His word would be
  sufficient, even had I not known you so long. You are the self-same Cethegus
  who transposed the first two songs of the? 'Aeneid' into Grecian
  hexameters?"</p>

  <p>"Infandum renovare jubes, regina, dolorem. A youthful sin, Queen," said
  Cethegus, smiling. "I bought up all the copies and burnt them on the day on
  which Tullia's translation appeared."</p>

  <p>Tullia was the pseudonym of Amalaswintha. Cethegus knew it, but the
  Princess had no suspicion of his knowledge. She was flattered in her weakest
  point, and continued:</p>

  <p>"You know how it stands with us. My father's moments are counted;
  according to the report of the physicians, he may, although yet strong and
  active, die at any moment. Athalaric here is the heir to his crown. But until
  he has reached the proper age, I shall conduct the regency, and act as his
  guardian."</p>

  <p>"Such is the will of the King, and Goths and Romans have long since agreed
  to this wise arrangement," said Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"They did so, but the mob is fickle. The rough men despise the government
  of a woman"&mdash;and at this thought Amalaswintha knit her brow in
  anger.</p>

  <p>"It is certainly contrary to the political principles both of Goths and
  Romans," said Cassiodorus apologetically. "It is quite a new thing that a
  woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Whatever may be thought about it, it is a fact," interposed the Princess.
  "Nevertheless, I count on the fidelity of the Goths in general, though single
  aristocratic individuals may aim at the crown. I also fear nothing from the
  Italians here in Ravenna, nor in most towns. But I fear&mdash;Rome and the
  Romans!"</p>

  <p>The attention of Cethegus was arrested. His whole being was suddenly
  excited, but his countenance remained impassive.</p>

  <p>"Rome will never accustom herself to the rule of the Goths; she will
  always resist us&mdash;how can it be otherwise?" added Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if the daughter of Theodoric had a Roman soul.</p>

  <p>"Therefore we fear," concluded Cassiodorus, "that, at the news of the
  vacancy of the throne, a movement may break out in Rome against the regency,
  be it for annexation to Byzantium, be it for the election of an Emperor of
  the Western Empire."</p>

  <p>Cethegus, as if in reflection, cast down his eyes.</p>

  <p>"For this reason," quickly interposed the Princess, "everything must be
  done before the news reaches Rome. A faithful, energetic man must receive the
  oaths of the garrison for me&mdash;I mean for my son; must take possession of
  the most important gates and squares, intimidate the Senate and the nobles,
  win the people to my cause, and irrevocably confirm my dominion before it is
  menaced. And to effect this, Cassiodorus has proposed&mdash;you. Speak; will
  you undertake it?"</p>

  <p>At this moment the golden stylus which she held happened to fell to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>Cethegus stooped to pick it up.</p>

  <p>He had only this one moment for the crowding thoughts that passed through
  his mind on hearing this proposal.</p>

  <p>Was the conspiracy in the Catacombs betrayed? Was he himself betrayed? Was
  this a snare laid by the crafty and ambitious woman? Or were the fools really
  so blind as to press this offer upon him? And if it were so, what should he
  do? Should he seize the occasion? Should he strike at once, in order to win
  Rome? And for whom? For Byzantium or for an Emperor of the West? And who
  should it be? Or were things not yet ripe? Should he, for this once,
  seemingly practise fidelity?</p>

  <p>To resolve these and many other questions, he had only the one moment in
  which he stooped.</p>

  <p>But his quick mind needed no more. He had seen, while in the act of
  stooping, the unsuspicious, trusting look of Cassiodorus, and, giving the
  stylus to the Princess, he spoke with decision:</p>

  <p>"Queen, I undertake the business."</p>

  <p>"That is well," said the Princess.</p>

  <p>Cassiodorus pressed his hand.</p>

  <p>"When Cassiodorus proposed me for this office," continued Cethegus, "he
  gave another proof of his deep knowledge of mankind. He has seen the kernel
  through the shell."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>"Queen, appearances might have deceived him. I confess that I do not like
  to see the barbarians&mdash;pardon, the Goths&mdash;reigning in Italy."</p>

  <p>"This frankness honours you, and I pardon the feeling in a Roman."</p>

  <p>"Besides that, I have taken no interest in public affairs for some years.
  After having experienced varied passions, I now live in the calm and
  retirement of my country villas, cultivating the sportive muse, enjoying my
  books, and untroubled by the cares of kings."</p>

  <p>"Beatus ille qui procul negotiis," quoted the learned lady, sighing.</p>

  <p>"But, because I honour science, because I, a scholar of Plato, desire that
  the wise should govern, I wish that a Queen should reign over my fatherland
  who is only a Goth by birth, but in her soul a Greek, and by her virtues a
  Roman. For her sake I will sacrifice my leisure to hated business. But only
  on condition that this shall be my last office of state. I will undertake
  your commission, and answer for Rome with my head."</p>

  <p>"Good; here you will find the legal documents which you will need."</p>

  <p>Cethegus looked rapidly through the records.</p>

  <p>"This is the manifesto of the young King to the Romans, with your
  signature. <i>His</i> is still wanting."</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha dipped the Cnidian reed-pen into the vessel filled with
  crimson ink, which was used by the Amelungs as well as by the Roman
  Emperors.</p>

  <p>"Come, write thy name, my son," she said.</p>

  <p>Athalaric, standing and leaning with both arms on the table, had keenly
  observed Cethegus during the above conversation. Now he stood erect. He was
  accustomed to act with the usual arrogance of a Crown Prince and the
  petulancy of an invalid.</p>

  <p>"No," he said impatiently; "I will not write. Not only because I do not
  trust this cold Roman&mdash;I do not trust you in the least, you proud
  man&mdash;but it is revolting that, while my noble father still breathes, you
  already quarrel about his crown. You dwarfs! About the crown of a giant!
  Shame on your insensibility! Behind those curtains the greatest hero of the
  century is dying, and you think already of the partition of his garment!"</p>

  <p>He turned his back upon them and went slowly to the window, where he
  passed his arm round his lovely sister, and stroked her shining hair. He
  stood there for some time; she did not notice him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she started from her reverie.</p>

  <p>"Athalaric," she whispered, hastily grasping his arm, and pointing at the
  marble staircase, "who is that man in the blue steel helmet, who is just
  coming round that pillar? Say, who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Let me see," said the youth, bending forward. "That? Oh! that is Earl
  Witichis, the conqueror of the Gepidae, a famous hero."</p>

  <p>And he told her of the deeds and triumphs of the Earl in the last war.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Cethegus had looked inquiringly at the Princess and the
  minister.</p>

  <p>"Let him alone," sighed Amalaswintha. "If he will not, no power on earth
  can make him."</p>

  <p>Further questions on the part of Cethegus were cut short, for the
  three-fold curtain, that shut out all the noise of the ante-chamber from the
  King's bedroom, was parted.</p>

  <p>It was Elpidios, the Greek physician, who, lifting the heavy folds, now
  entered, and announced that the sick man, just awakened from a long sleep,
  had sent him away, in order to be alone with old Hildebrand, who never
  stirred from his side.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-6"
     name="b1-6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">Theodoric's bed-chamber, which had served the same purpose
  under the Emperors, was decorated with the heavy splendour of late Roman
  style.</p>

  <p>The superabundant reliefs of the walls and the gilded ornamentation of the
  ceiling still pictured the victories and triumphal processions of Roman
  consuls and emperors. Heathen gods and goddesses floated proudly above.
  Everywhere reigned the same oppressive magnificence.</p>

  <p>The extreme simplicity of the Gothic King's couch formed a remarkable
  contrast to all this pomp.</p>

  <p>The oval frame of unpolished oak was raised scarcely a foot from the
  ground, and contained few cushions. Only the costly crimson cover which hid
  the King's feet, and the lion's skin with golden claws that lay before the
  bed&mdash;a present from the King of the Vandals, in Africa&mdash;betrayed
  the royalty of the sick man. All the other furniture of the room was simple,
  plain, and almost barbarously clumsy.</p>

  <p>On a pillar in the background hung the iron shield and broad-sword of the
  King, which had not been used for many years. At the head of the bed stood
  the old master-at-arms, with his eyes bent down, anxiously examining the
  features of the patient, who, leaning on his left arm, turned his majestic
  countenance towards him.</p>

  <p>The King's sparse hair, rubbed off on the temples by years of friction
  caused by his heavy helmet, was still of a bright brown colour, and without a
  trace of grey. His heavy brow, sparkling eyes, large nose, and the deep lines
  in his cheeks, spoke of great tasks and great strength to accomplish
  them.</p>

  <p>The expression of his face was commanding and even sublime; but the
  benevolent softness of his mouth, in spite of the grim and slightly-grey
  beard, gave evidence of the mildness and peaceful wisdom by means of which he
  had raised his kingdom to such a flourishing condition that it had already
  become a proverb and celebrated in story.</p>

  <p>His golden-brown and piercing eyes rested for some time upon his gigantic
  sick-nurse, with an expression of love and favour.</p>

  <p>At last he stretched out his thin, but nervous, right hand.</p>

  <p>"Old friend," said he, "we must now take leave of each other."</p>

  <p>The old man sank upon his knees and pressed the King's hand to his broad
  breast.</p>

  <p>"Come, my friend, rise! Must I comfort <i>thee</i>?"</p>

  <p>But Hildebrand remained upon his knees, and only lifted his head so that
  he could look the King in the face.</p>

  <p>"See," said the King, "I know that thou, son of Hilding, hast received
  from thy ancestors and thy father a deeper knowledge of the ailings of
  mankind and their healing than all these Grecian physicians and Lydian
  quack-salvers. And, more than that, thou art sincere. Therefore, I beg thee
  honestly to confirm me in what I feel to be true. Tell me, must I not die
  to-day&mdash;even before the night?" And he looked at him in a manner that
  would brook no deception.</p>

  <p>But Hildebrand did not wish to deceive him; he had regained his natural
  composure.</p>

  <p>"Yes, King of the Goths, heir of the Amelungs, thou must die; the hand of
  Death has passed across thy brow. Never again wilt thou see the sun's
  setting."</p>

  <p>"It is well," said Theodoric, without blenching. "Seest thou, the Greek
  whom I dismissed has lied to me all the day long. And yet time is precious to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou again send for the priests?" asked Hildebrand reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"No; they can do me no good. I need them no more."</p>

  <p>"Sleep has strengthened thee, and lifted the veil from thy soul. Hail!
  Theodoric, son of Walamer! thou wilt die like a hero!"</p>

  <p>"I know," said the King, smiling, "that it was repugnant to thy feelings
  to see the priests near my couch. Thou art in the right. They cannot help
  me."</p>

  <p>"And now&mdash;who or what has helped thee now?"</p>

  <p>"God and myself. Hear! And what I am about to say are my parting words. In
  gratitude for thy fifty years' faithful service, I confide to thine ear
  alone&mdash;not to my daughter, and not to Cassiodorus&mdash;that which has
  so long troubled me. Tell me, what is reported among the people? What is
  believed was the cause of the melancholy which suddenly overcame me, and
  originated this disease?"</p>

  <p>"The Italians say that it was remorse for the death of Boëthius and
  Symmachus."</p>

  <p>"Didst thou believe this?"</p>

  <p>"No; I could not believe that the death of traitors could so affect
  thee."</p>

  <p>"Thou art in the right. Perhaps, according to law, they were not deserving
  of death; and I loved Boëthius much. But they were traitors a thousand times!
  Traitors in their thoughts, traitors to my trust, to my heart. I prized these
  Romans more than the best of my people. And they showed their gratitude by
  wishing that my crown were the Emperor's; they wrote flattering letters to
  the Byzantines; they preferred a Justinus and a Justinian to the friendship
  of a Theodoric! I am not sorry for them; I despise them. Guess again. What
  didst thou believe?"</p>

  <p>"King, thy heir is a youth, and enemies encompass thy throne."</p>

  <p>The sick man frowned.</p>

  <p>"This time thou art nearer the mark. I always knew the weakness of my
  kingdom. When at the evening banquet I have shown the proud face of
  confidence to the foreign ambassadors, at night I have anxiously sighed at
  its inward disease. Old man, I know that thou hast often considered me all
  too confident. But none might see me tremble, neither friend nor foe. Else my
  throne had trembled. I sighed only when alone, and have borne my care in
  solitude."</p>

  <p>"Thou art wisdom itself, my King, and I was a fool!" cried the old
  man.</p>

  <p>"Thou seest," continued the King, stroking the old man's hand, "that I
  knew in what I displeased thee. I knew also thy blind hatred of these
  Italians. Believe me, it <i>is</i> blind, as was, perhaps, my love of them."
  Here he stopped and sighed.</p>

  <p>"Why wilt thou distress thyself?"</p>

  <p>"No, let me continue! I know that my kingdom&mdash;the work of my glorious
  and toilsome life&mdash;may easily fall. Perhaps owing to my generosity to
  these Romans. Be it so! No work of man is eternal, and the error of
  over-kindness is easily borne!"</p>

  <p>"My great King!"</p>

  <p>"But, Hildebrand, one night, as I was lying awake, anxious about the
  danger of my kingdom, there rose before my soul the ghost of another sin! Not
  of too much kindness, but of bloody force! And woe, woe to me, if my nation
  is to be destroyed in expiation of the crime of Theodoric! His, <i>his</i>
  image rises before me!"</p>

  <p>The sick man spoke with difficulty, and lay for a moment overwhelmed with
  emotion.</p>

  <p>"Whose image? of whom dost thou speak?" asked the old man softly, bending
  over him.</p>

  <p>"Odoacer!" whispered the King, and Hildebrand bowed his head.</p>

  <p>At last Theodoric broke the painful silence.</p>

  <p>"Yes, old friend, this right hand, as thou knowest, struck down the mighty
  hero&mdash;my guest&mdash;at the banquet-table. His hot blood splashed into
  my face, and an ardent hate flashed upon me from his filming eyes. A few
  months past, during the night I speak of, his bloody, pale and angry form
  rose before me like an avenging god. My heart was contracted, my pulses beat
  with fever. The fearful conviction came over me that my kingdom would fall
  and my nation decay, because of this my bloody deed."</p>

  <p>This time, after a short pause, Hildebrand, looking up defiantly,
  said:</p>

  <p>"King, why dost thou fret like a woman? Hast thou not struck down hundreds
  with thine own arm, and thy people thousands at thy behest? Have we not
  descended from the mountains into this land in more than thirty battles,
  wading ankle-deep in blood? What is the blood of <i>one</i> man to all this?
  And remember the circumstances. For four years he had defied thee as the
  ure-ox defies the bear. Twice he had driven thee and thy folk to the brink of
  destruction. Hunger, sword, and pestilence carried off thy Goths. At last, at
  last, stubborn Ravenna fell, forced by famine. The deadly enemy lay at thy
  feet. Then a warning came that he contemplated treason; that he would renew
  the fearful strife; that he would attack thee and thine that night. What
  couldest thou do? Call him openly to account? If he were guilty, that could
  do no good, therefore thou wert beforehand with him, and did that to him in
  the evening which he intended doing to thee at night. That <i>one</i> deed
  saved thy people, and prevented the renewal of a fearful strife. Thou
  forgavest all his followers, and for thirty years caused Goths and Italians
  to live as if in Paradise. And now thou wilt torment thyself with vain
  remorse? Two nations will ever thank thee for this deed! I&mdash;I would have
  killed him seven times over!"</p>

  <p>The old man ceased; his eyes flashed; he looked like an angry giant. But
  the King shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That is nothing, old warrior! I have repeated the same thing to myself a
  hundred times, and put it into more flattering forms than is possible to thy
  rude tongue. All in vain! He was a hero&mdash;the only one of my
  kind&mdash;and I murdered him without proof of his guilt, for I was jealous,
  suspicious, aye, it must be said, I was <i>afraid</i>&mdash;afraid that I
  should be compelled again to strive with him. It was, and is, and ever will
  be a sin! I have found no peace in self-excuses. Since that night his image
  has followed me unceasingly. At the banquet and in the council-chamber; at
  the hunt, in the church, waking and sleeping. Then Cassiodorus sent the
  priests and bishops to me. They could not help me. They heard my confession,
  saw my grief and my faith, and absolved me from all my sins. But peace came
  not, and though they forgave me, I could not forgive myself. I know not
  whether it be the old manner of thought inherited from my heathen ancestors,
  but I cannot hide myself behind the Cross from the ghost of the murdered man!
  I cannot believe I am freed from my bloody deed by the blood of an innocent
  God who died upon the Cross!"</p>

  <p>Hildebrand's face was suddenly lit up with joy.</p>

  <p>"Thou knowest," he whispered in the King's ear, "that I could never
  believe the priests of the Cross. Speak, oh, speak! dost thou still believe
  in Thor and Odin? Have <i>they</i> helped thee?"</p>

  <p>The King smiled and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, thou incorrigible old heathen! Thy Walhalla is nothing for me. Hear
  how I was helped. Yesterday I sent the bishops away, and retired into the
  recesses of my own heart. I thought and wrestled and entreated God, and I
  became calmer, and, behold! in the night a deep slumber came upon me, such as
  I had not known for long months. When I awoke, no fever of torture shook my
  limbs; I felt composed, and my mind clearer; I felt that no grace or miracle
  of God could undo the deed that I had committed. I knew that if God be indeed
  a God of vengeance, He could punish me and my house unto the seventh
  generation, and I dedicated myself and my kingdom to His eternal vengeance.
  But, if God be just, He cannot visit the sins committed by their King upon
  the people of the Goths. No, He will not do that. And if ever this people
  decay, I feel that it will not be owing to my deed; and thus peace hath
  entered into my soul, and I can die with courage."</p>

  <p>He was silent, but Hildebrand bowed his head and kissed the hand which had
  killed Odoacer.</p>

  <p>"These are my parting words to thee, my legacy and thanks for a whole life
  of fidelity. Now let us dedicate the remaining time to the Goths. Come,
  assist me to rise, I cannot die amid these cushions. There hang my weapons!
  Give them to me! No objections! I will, and I can!"</p>

  <p>Hildebrand was obliged to obey. With his help the sick man rose, and threw
  a purple mantle over his shoulders, girded on his sword, set the low
  helmet-crown on his head, and supporting himself on the shaft of his heavy
  lance, leaned his back against the thick Doric column in the middle of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Now call my daughter, and Cassiodorus, and whoever else may be
  outside."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-7"
     name="b1-7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">The King remained quietly standing, while Hildebrand threw
  back the curtains of the door on both sides, so that bed-chamber and
  ante-room now formed one undivided apartment. All those assembled
  outside&mdash;for many Goths and Romans had entered meanwhile&mdash;drew near
  to the King in astonished and reverent silence.</p>

  <p>"My daughter," said the King, "are the letters written which are to
  announce my death and the succession of my grandchild to Byzantium?"</p>

  <p>"Here they are," answered Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>The King rapidly ran through the rolls of papyrus.</p>

  <p>"To Emperor Justinus.&mdash;A second: to his nephew, Justinianus. 'Tis
  true, he will soon wear the crown, and is already the master of his masters.
  I see by the fine similes that Cassiodorus has written these letters. But
  hold!" A cloud passed across his face. "'Recommending my youth to your
  imperial protection!' Protection! That is too much. Alas! if ever you should
  be obliged to depend on the protection of Byzantium! 'Recommending myself to
  your <i>friendship</i>, is enough from the grandson of Theodoric." And he
  gave the letters back. "Still a third letter to Byzantium? To whom? 'To
  Theodora, the noble spouse of Justinianus?' What! to the dancer of the
  circus? To the shameless daughter of the lionkeeper?"</p>

  <p>His eye flashed.</p>

  <p>"She has great influence upon her husband," interposed Cassiodorus.</p>

  <p>"No, no. My daughter shall write to no female who has dishonoured the name
  of her sex."</p>

  <p>And he tore the roll of papyrus into pieces and threw them on the floor.
  Then, walking over the fragments, he advanced towards the Goths who stood in
  the middle of the hall.</p>

  <p>"My brave Witichis, what will be thy office after my death?"</p>

  <p>"I shall review our foot at Tridentum."</p>

  <p>"None could do it better! Never yet hast thou claimed the favour which was
  granted to thee beforehand, when thou wert victorious over the Gepidæ. Hast
  thou no wish even now?"</p>

  <p>"I <i>have</i> a wish, my King."</p>

  <p>"At last!&mdash;that pleases me. Speak."</p>

  <p>"A poor jailer, for refusing to apply the torture and for striking at a
  lictor, is himself condemned to be put to the torture to-day. Sire, set the
  man free! To torture is shameful, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The jailer is free; and from this moment torture is abolished in the
  kingdom of the Goths. Look to it, Cassiodorus! Brave Witichis, give me thy
  hand. To show to all how much I honour thee, I bequeath thee Wallada, my
  chestnut charger, in remembrance of this parting hour. And if ever thou art
  in danger, or&mdash;" here he lowered his voice, "would avoid it, whisper my
  name into the horse's ear. Who will watch over Neapolis? Duke Thulun was too
  rough. Those gay people must be won by gentle looks."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Young Totila will be Count of the Harbour there," answered
  Cassiodorus.</p>

  <p>"Totila! a sunny youth! a Siegfrid; a favourite of the gods! No heart can
  withstand him. But truly, the hearts of these Italians&mdash;" He sighed, and
  then continued, "Who will assure us of Rome and the Senate?"</p>

  <p>"Cethegus Cæsarius," said Cassiodorus, with a motion of his hand, "this
  noble Roman."</p>

  <p>"Cethegus? I know him well. Look at me, Cethegus."</p>

  <p>Cethegus, thus addressed, reluctantly raised his eyes, which he had
  quickly cast down before the steady look of the King. But now, collecting
  himself, he quietly bore the eagle glance which seemed to penetrate his
  soul.</p>

  <p>"It was a sickly whim, Cethegus, which made a man of your kind withhold
  himself so long from affairs of state; and from us. Or it was dangerous.
  Perhaps it is still more dangerous that you&mdash;<i>now</i>&mdash;again take
  an interest in politics."</p>

  <p>"It was not my wish, O King."</p>

  <p>"I will answer for him!" cried Cassiodorus.</p>

  <p>"Peace, friend! On earth no one can answer for another!&mdash;scarcely for
  himself! But," he continued with a searching look, "this proud
  intellect&mdash;this Cæsar-like intellect&mdash;will not betray Italia to the
  Greeks."</p>

  <p>Cethegus had to endure one more sharp look from the golden eagle-eyes.
  Then the King suddenly grasped his arm, and whispered in his ear: "Listen to
  my warning. No Roman will ever again flourish on the throne of the Western
  Empire. Peace! no contradiction. I have warned you. What noise is that
  outside?" he asked, quickly turning to his daughter; who, in a low voice, was
  speaking with a Roman messenger.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, my King; nothing of importance, my father."</p>

  <p>"What! secrets from me? By my crown! Wilt thou govern while I still
  breathe? I hear the sound of strange tongues outside. Open the doors!"</p>

  <p>The doors which divided the outer hall from the ante-room were thrown
  open. There, in the midst of a number of Goths and Romans, were to be seen
  several strange and dwarfish forms, clothed in a curious costume, with
  doublets of wolfskin, pointed caps, and shaggy sheep-skins hanging down their
  backs. Surprised and impressed by the sudden apparition of the King, they
  sank upon their knees.</p>

  <p>"Ah, messengers from the Avarians! Those robber border-ruffians on our
  eastern boundaries! Have you brought the owing yearly tribute?"</p>

  <p>"Sire, once again we bring it: skins, woollen carpets, swords, shields.
  There they hang&mdash;there they lie. But we hope that next year&mdash;we
  will see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will see whether the aged Theodoric has become a dotard? You hoped
  that I was dead? You think that you can refuse the tribute to my successor?
  You err, spies!"</p>

  <p>And he took up, as if proving its worth, one of the swords which the
  messengers had laid at his feet, together with its sheath, held it firmly by
  hilt and point, and with a slight effort snapped the steel in two, and threw
  the pieces on the ground.</p>

  <p>"The Avari carry worthless swords," he said quietly. "Come, Athalaric,
  heir to my kingdom. They do not believe that thou canst bear the weight of my
  crown. Show them how thou canst throw my spear."</p>

  <p>The youth bounded to him. The scarlet hue of ambition flushed his pale
  face. He swung the heavy spear of his grandfather, and hurled it with such
  force at a shield which the messengers had leaned against one of the wooden
  pillars, that it completely pierced it and penetrated deeply into the
  wood.</p>

  <p>The King laid his left hand on the head of his grandchild, and said
  proudly to the messengers:</p>

  <p>"Now go, and tell at home what you have seen."</p>

  <p>He turned away; the outer doors were closed, and shut out the amazed
  Avarians.</p>

  <p>"Give me a cup of wine. It may possibly be the last! No, unmixed! In
  Germanic fashion&mdash;" he repulsed the Grecian physician. "Thanks, old
  Hildebrand, for this draught, so faithfully given. I drink prosperity to the
  Goths!"</p>

  <p>He slowly emptied the goblet; and with a hand yet firm and strong he
  replaced it on the marble table.</p>

  <p>But suddenly, like a flash of lightning, that which the physicians had
  long expected took place. He staggered, pressed his hand to his heart, and
  fell backwards into Hildebrand's arms; who, slowly kneeling down, let him
  gently slide on to the marble pavement, supporting his helm-crowned head.</p>

  <p>For one moment all present held their breath; but the King did not move,
  and, with a loud cry, Athalaric threw himself upon the corpse.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-8"
     name="b1-8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">There was another man, besides Cassiodorus, who played a
  most important, and, as it seemed to the Regency, a very deserving part, in
  those days of transition. This was no other than Cethegus. He had undertaken
  the momentous office of Prefect of Rome. As soon as the King had closed his
  eyes for ever, Cethegus had instantly hurried to his place of trust, and had
  arrived there before the news of the event had reached that city.</p>

  <p>Before daybreak, he had collected the senators together in the
  <i>Senatus</i>, that is, in the closed hall of Domitian, near the temple of
  Janus Geminus, on the right of the arch of Septimus Severus, and had
  surrounded the building with Gothic troops. He informed the surprised
  senators (many of whom he had only recently met in the Catacombs, and had
  incited to the expulsion of the barbarians) of the already accomplished
  succession to the throne. He had also, not without many mild hints as to the
  spears of the Gothic hundreds, which might easily be seen from the hall,
  taken their oaths of allegiance to Athalaric with a rapidity that brooked no
  contradiction.</p>

  <p>Then he left the "Senatus," where he kept the conscript fathers locked up,
  until, with the support of the strong Gothic garrison, he had held a meeting
  of the assembled Romans which he had called in the Flavian amphitheatre, and
  had won the hearts of the easily-moved "Quirites" for the young King.</p>

  <p>He enumerated the generous deeds of Theodoric, promised the same
  beneficence from his grandson, who was, besides, already acknowledged by all
  Italy and the provinces, and also by the fathers of the city; announced a
  general feast for the Roman population, with the gift of bread and wine, as
  the first act of the new government; and concluded with the proclamation of
  seven days of games in the Circus (races between twenty-four Spanish
  four-horsed chariots), with which he himself would celebrate the accession of
  Athalaric, and his own entrance into office.</p>

  <p>At once a thousand voices shouted, with loud huzzas, the names of the
  Queen-Regent and her son; and still more loudly the name of Cethegus. Then
  the people joyously dispersed, the imprisoned senators were released, and the
  Eternal City was won for the Goths.</p>

  <p>The Prefect hurried to his house at the foot of the Capitol, locked
  himself up, and eagerly wrote his report to the Queen-Regent.</p>

  <p>But he was soon disturbed by a violent knocking upon the iron door of the
  house. It was Lucius Licinius, the young Roman whom we have already met in
  the Catacombs. He struck with the hilt of his sword against the door till the
  house echoed.</p>

  <p>He was followed by Scævola, the jurist, with portentously frowning brow,
  who had been amongst the imprisoned senators; and by Silverius, the priest,
  with doubtful mien.</p>

  <p>The ostiarius looked prudently through a secret aperture in the wall, and,
  on recognising Licinius, admitted them.</p>

  <p>Licinius rushed impetuously before the others through the well-known
  vestibule and the colonnade of the atrium to the study of Cethegus.</p>

  <p>When Cethegus heard the hastily-approaching footsteps, he rose from the
  lectus upon which he was lying writing, and put his letters into a casket
  with a silver lid.</p>

  <p>"Ah, the saviours of the fatherland!" he said, smiling, and advanced
  towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Vile traitor!" shouted Licinius, his hand on his sword&mdash;anger
  impeded further speech; he half drew his sword from the sheath.</p>

  <p>"Stop! first let him defend himself, if he can," panted Scævola, holding
  the young man's arm, as he hastened into the room.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible that he can have deserted the cause of the Holy Church,"
  said Silverius, as he also entered.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" laughed Licinius. "What! are you mad, or am I? Has he not
  caused us to be confined in our houses? Has he not shut the gates, and taken
  the oaths of the mob for the barbarians?"</p>

  <p>"Has he not," continued Cethegus, "caught the noble fathers of the city,
  three hundred in number, and kept them in the Curia, like so many mice in a
  trap; three hundred aristocratic mice?"</p>

  <p>"He dares to mock us? Will you suffer that?" cried Licinius. And Scævola
  turned pale with anger.</p>

  <p>"Well, and what would you have done had you been allowed to act?" asked
  the Prefect quietly, crossing his arms on his broad breast.</p>

  <p>"What should we have done?" cried Licinius. "What we, and you with us,
  have a hundred times decided upon. As soon as the news of the tyrant's death
  had arrived, we should have killed all the Goths in the city, proclaimed a
  Republic, and chosen two consuls&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of the names of Licinius and Scævola; that is the first thing. Well, and
  then? What then?"</p>

  <p>"What then? Freedom would have conquered!"</p>

  <p>"Folly would have conquered!" broke out Cethegus in a thundering voice,
  which startled his accusers. "Well for us that your hands were bound; you
  would have strangled Hope for ever. Look here, and thank me upon your
  knees!"</p>

  <p>He took some records from another casket, and gave them to his astonished
  companions.</p>

  <p>"There; read! The enemy had been warned, and had thrown the noose round
  the neck of Rome in a masterly manner. If I had not acted as I did, Earl
  Witichis would be standing at this moment before the Salarian Gate in the
  north with ten thousand Goths; to-morrow young Totila would have blockaded
  the mouth of the Tiber on the south with the fleet from Neapolis; and Duke
  Thulun would have been approaching the Tomb of Hadrian and the Aurelian Gate
  from the west, with twenty thousand men. If, this morning early, you had
  touched a hair of a Goth's head, what would have happened?"</p>

  <p>Silverius breathed again. The others were ashamed and silent. But Licinius
  took heart.</p>

  <p>"We should have defied the Goths behind our walls," he said, with a toss
  of his handsome head.</p>

  <p>"Yes, when these walls are restored as I will restore them&mdash;for
  eternity, my Licinius: as they are now&mdash;not for a day."</p>

  <p>"Then we had died as free citizens," said Scævola.</p>

  <p>"You might have done that in the Curie three hours ago," laughed Cethegus,
  shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Silverius stepped forward with open arms, as if to embrace
  him&mdash;Cethegus drew back.</p>

  <p>"You have saved us all, you have saved Church and fatherland! I never
  doubted you!" exclaimed the priest.</p>

  <p>But Licinius grasped the hand of the Prefect, who willingly abandoned it
  to him.</p>

  <p>"I <i>did</i> doubt you," he said with charming frankness. "Forgive me,
  you great Roman! This sword, with which I would have penetrated into your
  very heart, is henceforward at your service. And when the day of freedom
  dawns, then no consul, then <i>salve</i>, Dictator Cethegus!"</p>

  <p>He hurried out with flashing eyes. The Prefect cast a satisfied glance
  after him.</p>

  <p>"Dictator, yes; but only until the Republic is in full security," said the
  jurist, and followed Licinius.</p>

  <p>"To be sure," said Cethegus, with a smile; "then we will wake up Camillus
  and Brutus, and take up the Republic from the point at which they left it a
  thousand years ago. Is it not so, Silverius?"</p>

  <p>"Prefect of Rome," said the priest, "you know that I was ambitious to
  conduct the affairs of the fatherland as well as of the Church. After this, I
  am so no more. You shall lead, I will follow. Swear to me only one thing: the
  freedom of the Roman Church&mdash;free choice of a Pope."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Cethegus; "but first Silverius must have become Pope. So
  be it."</p>

  <p>The priest departed with a smile upon his lips, but with a weight upon his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Go," said Cethegus, after a pause, looking in the direction taken by his
  three visitors. "You will never overthrow a tyrant&mdash;you need one!"</p>

  <p>This day and hour were decisive for Cethegus. Almost against his will, he
  was driven by circumstances to entertain new views, feelings, and plans,
  which he had never, until now, put to himself so clearly, or confessed to be
  more than mere dreams. He acknowledged that at this moment he was sole master
  of the situation. He had the two great parties of the period&mdash;the Gothic
  Government and its enemies&mdash;completely in his power. And the principal
  motive-power in the heart of this powerful man, which he had for years
  thought paralysed, was suddenly aroused to the greatest activity. The
  unlimited desire&mdash;yes, the necessity&mdash;to <i>govern</i>, made itself
  all at once serviceable to all the powers of his rich nature, and excited
  them to violent emotion.</p>

  <p>Cornelius Cethegus Cæsarius was the descendant of an old and immensely
  rich family, whose ancestor had founded the splendour of his house as a
  general and statesman under Cæsar during the civil wars; it was even rumoured
  that he was the son of the great Dictator.</p>

  <p>Our hero had received from nature various talents and violent passions,
  and his immense riches gave him the means to develop the first and satisfy
  the last to the fullest extent. He had received the most careful education
  that was then possible for a young Roman noble. He practised the fine arts
  under the best teachers; he studied law, history, and philosophy in the
  famous schools of Berytus, Alexandria, and Athens with brilliant success. But
  all this did not satisfy him. He felt the breath of decay in all the art and
  science of his time. In particular, his study of philosophy had only the
  effect of destroying the last traces of belief in his soul, without affording
  him any results. When he returned home from his studies, his father,
  according to the custom of the time, introduced him to political life, and
  his brilliant talents raised him quickly from office to office.</p>

  <p>But all at once he abandoned his career. As soon as he had made himself
  master of the affairs of state, he would no longer be a wheel in the great
  machine of a kingdom from which freedom was excluded, and which, besides, was
  subject to a barbarian King.</p>

  <p>His father died, and Cethegus, being now his own master and possessor of
  an immense fortune, rushed into the vortex of life, enjoyment, and luxury
  with all the passion of his nature.</p>

  <p>He soon exhausted Rome, and travelled to Byzantium, into Egypt, and even
  as far as India.</p>

  <p>There was no luxury, no innocent or criminal pleasure, in which he did not
  revel; only a well-steeled frame could have borne the adventures, privations,
  and dissipations of these journeys.</p>

  <p>After twelve years of absence, he returned to Rome.</p>

  <p>It was said that he would build magnificent edifices. People expected that
  he would lead a luxurious life in his houses and villas. They were sadly
  deceived.</p>

  <p>Cethegus only built for himself the convenient little house at the foot of
  the Capitol, which he decorated in the most tasteful manner; and there he
  lived in populous Rome like a hermit.</p>

  <p>He unexpectedly published a description of his travels, characterising the
  people and countries which he had visited. The book had an unheard-of
  success. Cassiodorus and Boëthius sought his friendship, and the great King
  invited him to his court.</p>

  <p>But on a sudden he disappeared from Rome.</p>

  <p>What had happened remained a mystery, in spite of all malicious, curious,
  or sympathetic inquiries.</p>

  <p>People told each other that one morning a poor fisherman had found
  Cethegus unconscious, almost dead, on the shores of the Tiber, outside the
  gates of the city.</p>

  <p>A few weeks later he again was heard of on the north-east frontier of the
  kingdom, in the inhospitable regions of the Danube, where a bloody war with
  the Gepidae, Avari, and Sclavonians was raging. There he fought the savage
  barbarians with death-despising courage, and followed them with a few chosen
  troops, paid from his private means, into their rocky fortresses, sleeping
  every night upon the frozen ground. And once, when the Gothic general
  entrusted to him a larger detachment of troops in order to make an inroad,
  instead of doing this, he attacked and took Sirmium, the enemy's fortified
  capital, displaying no less good generalship than courage.</p>

  <p>After the conclusion of peace, he travelled into Gaul, Spain, and again to
  Byzantium; returned thence to Rome, and lived for years in an embittered
  idleness and retirement, refusing all the military, civil, or scientific
  offices and honours which Cassiodorus pressed, upon him. He appeared to take
  no interest in anything but his studies.</p>

  <p>A few years before the period at which our story commences, he had brought
  with him from Gaul a handsome youth, to whom he showed Rome and Italy, and
  whom he treated with fatherly love and care. It was said that he would adopt
  him. As long as his young guest was with him he ceased his lonely life,
  invited the aristocratic youth of Rome to brilliant feasts in his villas,
  and, accepting all invitations in return, proved himself the most amiable of
  guests.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he had sent young Julius Montanus, with a stately suite of
  pedagogues, freedmen, and slaves, to the learned schools of Alexandria, he
  suddenly broke off all social ties, and retired into impenetrable solitude,
  seemingly at war with God and the whole world.</p>

  <p>Silverius and Rusticiana had, with the greatest difficulty, persuaded him
  to sacrifice his repose, and join in the conspiracy of the Catacombs. He told
  them that he only became a patriot from tedium. And, in fact, until the death
  of the King, he had taken part in the conspiracy&mdash;the conduct of which,
  however, was wholly in his and the archdeacon's hands&mdash;almost with
  dislike.</p>

  <p>It was now otherwise.</p>

  <p>Until now, the inmost sentiment of his being&mdash;the desire to test
  himself in all possible fields of intellectual effort; to overcome all
  difficulties; to outdo all rivals; to govern, alone and without resistance,
  every circle that he entered; and, when he had won the crown of victory,
  carelessly to cast it aside and seek for new tasks&mdash;all this had never
  permitted him to find full satisfaction in any of his aims.</p>

  <p>Art, science, luxury, office, fame. Each of these had charmed him. He had
  excelled in all to an unusual degree, and yet all had left a void in his
  soul.</p>

  <p>To govern, to be the first, to conquer opposing circumstances with all his
  means of superior power and wisdom, and then to rule crouching men with a rod
  of iron; this, consciously and unconsciously, had always been his aim. In
  this alone could he find contentment.</p>

  <p>Therefore he now breathed proudly and freely. His icy heart glowed at the
  thought that he ruled over the two great inimical powers of the time, over
  both Goths and Romans, with a mere glance of his eye; and from this exquisite
  feeling of mastery, the conviction arose with demonic force, that there
  remained but one goal for him and his ambition that was worth living for; but
  one goal, distant as the sun, and out of the reach of every other man. He
  believed in his descent from Julius Cæsar, and felt the blood rush through
  his veins at the thought&mdash;Cæsar, Emperor of the West, ruler of the Roman
  Empire!</p>

  <p>A few months ago, when this thought first flashed across his
  mind&mdash;not even a thought, not a wish, only a shadow, a dream&mdash;he
  was startled, and could not help smiling at his own boundless assurance.</p>

  <p><i>He</i>, Emperor and regenerator of the Empire! And Italy trembled under
  the footsteps of three hundred thousand Goths! And the greatest of all
  barbarian kings, whose fame filled the earth, sat on his powerful throne in
  Ravenna!</p>

  <p>Even if the power of the Goths were broken, the Franks and Byzantines
  would stretch their greedy hands over the Alps and across the sea to seize
  the Italian booty. Two great kingdoms against a single man! For, truly, he
  stood alone amid his people. How well he knew, how utterly he despised his
  countrymen, the unworthy descendants of great ancestors! How he laughed at
  the enthusiasm of a Licinius or a Scævola, who thought to renew the days of
  the Republic with these degenerate Romans!</p>

  <p>He stood alone.</p>

  <p>But the feeling only excited his ambition, and, at that moment, when the
  conspirators had left him, when his superiority had been more plainly proved
  than ever before, the thoughts which had been a flattering amusement of his
  moody hours, suddenly ripened and formed themselves into a clear resolve.</p>

  <p>Folding his arms across his mighty chest, and measuring the apartment with
  heavy steps, like a lion in his cage, he spoke to himself in abrupt
  sentences:</p>

  <p>"To drive out the Goths and prevent Franks and Greeks from entering, would
  not be difficult, with a brave host at one's back; any other man could do it.
  But alone, quite alone, more hindered than helped by these knaves without
  marrow in their bones; to accomplish the impossible; to make these cowards
  heroes; these slaves, Romans; these servants of the priests and barbarians,
  masters of the world; that, <i>that</i> is worth the trouble. To create a new
  people, a new time, a new world, with the power of his single will and the
  might of his intellect, is what no mortal has yet accomplished&mdash;that
  would be greater than Cæsar!&mdash;<i>he</i> led legions of heroes! and yet,
  it can be done, for it can be imagined. And I, who can imagine it, can do it.
  Yes, Cethegus, that is an aim for which it is easy to think, to live, to die!
  Up, and to work! and henceforward, no thought, no feeling, except for this
  one thing!"</p>

  <p>He stood still at last before a colossal statue of Cæsar, sculptured in
  Parian marble, which&mdash;a masterpiece of Arkesilaus, and, according to
  family tradition, given by Julius Cæsar himself to his son&mdash;stood before
  the writing-divan, the most sacred treasure of the house.</p>

  <p>"Hear me, divine Cæsar! great ancestor!" exclaimed Cethegus, "thy
  descendant dares to rival thee! There is still something higher than anything
  which thou hast reached; even to soar at a higher quarry than thou, is
  immortal; and to fall&mdash;to fall from such a height&mdash;is the most
  glorious death. Hail! Once again I know why I live!"</p>

  <p>He passed the statue, and threw a glance at some military maps of the
  Roman Empire, which lay unrolled upon the table.</p>

  <p>"First trample upon these barbarians: Rome! Then once more subdue the
  North: Paris! Then reduce the rebellious East to its old subjection to the
  Cæsar-city: Byzantium! and farther, even farther, to the Tigris, to the
  Indus; farther than Alexander; and back to the West, through Scythia and
  Germania, to the Tiber; the path, Cæsar, which Brutus' dagger cut off for
  thee. And so to be greater than thou, greater than
  Alexander&mdash;&mdash;hold, my thought! Enough!"</p>

  <p>And the heart of the icy Cethegus flamed and glowed; the veins of his
  temples throbbed violently; he pressed his burning forehead against the cold
  marble breast of Julius Cæsar, who majestically looked down upon him.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-9"
     name="b1-9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">The day of the King's death was not only decisive for
  Cethegus, but also for the conspiracy in the Catacombs, for Italy, and for
  the Gothic kingdom.</p>

  <p>Although the intrigues of the patriots&mdash;led by different men, who
  were not agreed upon the means, nor even upon the aims of their
  plots&mdash;had, till now, made slow and doubtful progress, this state of
  things was completely altered from the moment when Cethegus took the conduct
  of affairs into his own strong hands. Only then did the conspiracy become
  really dangerous to the Goths.</p>

  <p>Cethegus untiringly sought to undermine the security of their kingdom.
  With his great capacity for winning and governing men, and penetrating their
  motives, he was able daily to increase the number of important members and
  the means of success. He understood how to avoid the suspicion of the Goths
  on the one hand, and to prevent any untimely rebellion on the other. For it
  would have been easy to attack the barbarians in all the towns of the
  Peninsula on some special day, and to call upon the Byzantines&mdash;who had
  long since been on the watch for such a crisis&mdash;to complete the
  conquest. But in this way the Prefect would not have been able to carry out
  his secret plans. He would merely have put Byzantine tyranny in the place of
  Gothic rule. And we know that he had very different intentions. In order to
  fulfil them, he wished first to create for himself a power in Italy, greater
  than any other man possessed. Before the foot of a Byzantine was set upon
  Italian soil, he must become&mdash;although in secret&mdash;the mightiest man
  in the country. All must be so prepared that the barbarians should be driven
  away by Italy itself, that is, by Cethegus, with the least possible help from
  Byzantium; so that, after the victory, the Emperor could not avoid giving the
  dominion over the country to its saviour, even if only as a governor. Then he
  would soon gain time and opportunity to excite the national pride of the
  Romans against the rule of the "Greek-lings," as they contemptuously called
  the Byzantines. For, although for two hundred years&mdash;since the days of
  the great Constantine&mdash;the glory of the Empire of the world had been
  removed from widowed Rome to the golden town on the Hellespont, and the
  sceptre of the sons of Romulus seemed to have passed over to the Greeks;
  though East and West formed <i>one</i> state of antique culture opposed to
  the barbarian world; yet even now the Romans hated and despised the Greeks as
  much as in the days when Flaminius declared humbled Hellas to be a freedman
  of Rome. The old hate was now increased by envy.</p>

  <p>Therefore Cethegus was sure of the enthusiasm and support of all Italy,
  which, after the removal of the barbarians, would also banish the Byzantines
  from the country; and the crown of Rome, the crown of the Western Empire,
  would be his certain reward.</p>

  <p>And if he succeeded in exciting the newly-awakened national feeling to an
  offensive war on the other side of the Alps, when he had again erected the
  throne of the Roman Empire on the ruins of the Frankish Kingdom at Orleans
  and Paris, then the attempt would not be too rash once again to subdue the
  Eastern Empire and continue the Empire of the World in the Eternal City from
  the point at which Trajan and Hadrian had left it.</p>

  <p>In order to reach this distant and shining goal, every step on the dizzy
  path must be taken with the greatest prudence; any stumble might precipitate
  him into an abyss. In order to gain his end, Cethegus must first of all make
  sure of Rome; on Rome alone could his plans be based.</p>

  <p>Therefore the new Prefect bestowed the greatest care upon the city that
  had been entrusted to him. He wished to make Rome, morally and physically,
  his surety of dominion, belonging alone to him, and not to be wrested from
  him.</p>

  <p>His office gave him the best pretext for carrying out his plans. Was it
  not the duty of the <i>Præfectus Urbi</i> to care for the well-being of the
  populace, and for the preservation and security of the city? He understood
  perfectly well how to use the rights of his office for the furtherance of his
  own aims. He easily won the sympathies of all ranks; the nobles honoured in
  him the head of the conspiracy; he governed the clergy through Silverius, who
  was the right hand of the pope, and, by public opinion, appointed his
  successor, and who showed to the Prefect a devotion that was even surprising
  to its object. He gained the common people, not only by occasional gifts of
  bread, and games in the Circus, but also by promoting great undertakings,
  which, at the cost of the Gothic Government, provided work and sustenance for
  thousands.</p>

  <p>He persuaded Amalaswintha to give orders that the fortifications of Rome,
  which had suffered much more since the reign of Honorius from the inroads of
  time and the selfishness of Roman architects, than from the Visigoths and
  Vandals, should be quickly and completely restored "to the honour of the
  Eternal City, and," as she imagined, "for protection against the
  Byzantines."</p>

  <p>Cethegus himself, and, as was afterwards proved by the unsuccessful sieges
  of the Goths and Byzantines, with great strategic genius, made the plan of
  the magnificent works. With the greatest zeal he set about the gigantic task
  of transforming the immense city, with its circumference of many miles, into
  a stronghold of the first rank. The thousands of workmen, who well knew to
  whom they owed their well-paid employment, applauded the Prefect whenever he
  showed himself upon the ramparts, to examine what progress had been made, or
  excite to new industry, and, sometimes, to put his own hand to the work. And
  the deceived Princess assigned one million <i>solidi</i> after another for
  the expenses of fortifications, against which the whole power of her people
  was shortly to be wrecked and annihilated.</p>

  <p>The most important point of these fortifications was the Tomb of Hadrian,
  known now under the name of Castle St. Angelo. This magnificent edifice,
  built of blocks of Parian marble, which were laid one upon the other without
  any uniting cement, lay, at that time, about a stone's-throw from the
  Aurelian Grate, the flanking walls of which it by far overtopped.</p>

  <p>Cethegus had seen at a glance that this incomparably strong building,
  which until now had been designed for offence <i>against</i> the city, might,
  by very simple means, be converted into a powerful bulwark of defence
  <i>for</i> the city; he caused two walls to be built from the Aurelian Grate
  towards and around the Mausoleum.</p>

  <p>And soon the towering marble castle formed an assault-proof rampart for
  the Aurelian Grate, so much the more because the Tiber formed a natural fosse
  close before it. On the top of the wall of the Mausoleum stood about three
  hundred of the most beautiful statues of bronze, marble, and iron, mostly
  placed there by Hadrian and his successors. Amongst them were that of the
  Divus Hadrianus; his beautiful favourite Antinous; a Jupiter of Soter; a
  Pallas "town-protectress;" and many others. Cethegus rejoiced at the
  fulfilment of his ideas, and became exceedingly fond of this place, where he
  used to wander every evening with his beloved Rome spread out at his feet,
  examining the progress of the works. He had even caused a number of beautiful
  statues from his own villas to be added to those already existing, in order
  to increase the splendour of his creation.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-10"
     name="b1-10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">Cethegus was obliged to be more prudent in the execution of
  a second plan, not less necessary for the success of his projects. In order
  to be able to defy the Goths, and, if needful, the Greeks, from within
  <i>his</i> Rome, as he loved to call it, he was in want&mdash;not only of
  walls, but of soldiers to defend them.</p>

  <p>At first he thought of mercenaries, of a body-guard such as had been often
  kept by high officials, statesmen and generals in those times, such as
  Belisarius and Narses possessed in Byzantium.</p>

  <p>It would have been very easy for him, by means of his riches and the
  connections he had formed during his travels in Asia, to hire brave troops of
  the savage Isaurian mountain people, who then played the part of the Swiss of
  the sixteenth century; but this procedure had two very straitened limits. On
  the one side he could not, without exhausting the means that were
  indispensable for other purposes, keep more than a comparatively small band,
  the kernel of an army, not an army itself. On the other side it was
  impossible to bring these mercenaries in larger numbers to Italy or Rome,
  without arousing suspicion. He was obliged to smuggle them over with much
  cunning&mdash;by pairs, singly, or in small groups, to his scattered villas
  and estates, as his slaves, freedmen, clients, or guests; and to employ them
  as sailors and ship-officials in the harbour of Ostia, or as workmen in
  Rome.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the Romans themselves would, after all, have to save and defend
  Rome, and all his plans urged him to re-accustom his fellow-citizens to the
  use of arms. But Theodoric had wisely excluded the Italians from the
  army&mdash;exceptions were only made in favour of persons who were considered
  as particularly reliable and in the late unquiet times of his reign, during
  the process against Boëthius, he had issued orders for the general disarming
  of all Romans. This measure had certainly never been strictly carried out,
  but still Cethegus dared not hope that the Queen-Regent would allow him,
  against the expressed will of her august father and the evident interests of
  the Goths, to form any considerable forces of Italians.</p>

  <p>He contented himself with representing to her, that, by means of a very
  innocent concession, she could procure for herself the merit of having
  cancelled Theodoric's hateful measure by a noble trust; proposing to her that
  she should allow him to drill and keep under arms only two thousand Roman
  citizens as a guard for the city; the Romans would be for ever grateful to
  her that the city did not appear to be solely protected by barbarians.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha, who was enthusiastic about Rome, and whose dearest wish was
  to gain the love of the Romans, gave her consent, and Cethegus began to form
  his militia, as we should call it. In a proclamation, which sounded like a
  trumpet-call, he "bid the sons of Scipio take up their old weapons." He
  promised to double the pay fixed upon by the Princess from his own pocket, to
  any Roman who voluntarily presented himself. From the thousands who pressed
  forward he chose the most able. He armed the poor; gave to those who
  distinguished themselves in the service, Gallic helmets and Spanish swords
  from his own collections; and, as the most important step, he regularly
  discharged those who were sufficiently drilled as soon as possible, leaving
  them their weapons, and enlisted new recruits, so that although at no time
  more were on the service than the number allowed by Amalaswintha, yet, in an
  incredibly short space of time, many thousands of armed and practised Romans
  were at the disposal of their adored leader.</p>

  <p>While Cethegus added in this manner to the strength of his future capital
  and formed his future pretorians, he put off his co-conspirators, who
  constantly urged him to strike, and comforted them with the hope that the
  proper moment would soon arrive, which, however, he alone could determine. At
  the same time he kept up constant communication with Byzantium. He wanted to
  make sure of assistance thence, which could appear upon the scene of action
  at any hour in which he might desire it, but which would not come without a
  call, or in such force that it could not easily be again removed. He wished
  for a good general from Byzantium, who, however, must not be a great
  statesman; bringing an army sufficiently powerful to support the Italians,
  but not strong enough to gain the victory without them, or to remain in the
  country against their will.</p>

  <p>We shall see later how, with regard to this, much occurred in accordance
  with the Prefect's wishes, but just as much against them.</p>

  <p>As to the Goths&mdash;who at this time were in undisturbed possession of
  the booty for which Cethegus already mentally quarrelled with the
  Emperor&mdash; all his endeavour was to rock them into unsuspicious security,
  to split them into parties, and to uphold a weak government at their
  head.</p>

  <p>The first task was not difficult; for that strong Teutonic race despised,
  with barbarian pride, all open and secret foes&mdash;we have already seen how
  difficult it was to convince such a youth as Totila, who was otherwise
  sharp-sighted and clear-headed, of the approach of danger&mdash;and the
  stubborn trust of Hildebrand fully expressed the general disposition of the
  Goths.</p>

  <p>Party spirit was also not wanting in this people.</p>

  <p>There were the proud race of the Balthe, with their widely-spread kindred;
  at their head the three Dukes, Thulun, Ibba, and Pitza. The rich Wölfungs,
  under the two brothers, Duke Guntharis and Earl Arahad; and many others, who
  were not much inferior to the Amelungs in the splendour of their ancestry,
  and jealously guarded their position near the throne. There were also many
  who endured the guardianship of a woman and the rule of a boy with strong
  dislike, and who would gladly, according to the ancient rights of the nation,
  have passed over the royal line, and chosen one of the tried heroes of the
  nation for their King, But the Amelungs counted many blindly-devoted
  adherents, who abhorred such sentiments as treasonable.</p>

  <p>And, lastly, the whole nation was divided into two parties, one of which,
  long discontented with the clemency shown to the Italians by Theodoric and
  his daughter, would gladly have retrieved the mistake which, as they thought,
  had been made when the country was conquered, and punished the Italians for
  their secret hate with open violence. The number of those who held milder and
  nobler opinions&mdash;who, like Theodoric himself, were more susceptible to
  the higher culture of the subjected Italians, and desirous to raise
  themselves and their people to the same level&mdash;was naturally much
  smaller. At the head of this party stood the Queen.</p>

  <p>This woman Cethegus now sought to uphold in the possession of power; for
  her feminine, weak, and divided government was calculated to undermine the
  strength of the nation, to excite party spirit and discontent, and to exclude
  all augmentation of national feeling.</p>

  <p>Cethegus trembled at the thought that he might see an energetic man unite
  the strength of the whole nation. And often the traits of sublimity which
  occasionally were to be seen in Amalaswintha, and, still more, the fiery
  sparks of repressed feeling which sometimes blazed out in Athalaric's soul,
  caused him serious uneasiness. Should mother and son betray such feelings
  more frequently, then, certainly, he would be compelled to overthrow their
  government as zealously as he had hitherto upheld it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile he rejoiced in the unlimited command which he possessed over the
  mind of Amalaswintha. It had been easy for him to gain it; not only because
  he, with great subtlety, took advantage of her predilection for learned
  discussions&mdash;in which he was so often vanquished by the seemingly
  superior knowledge of the Princess that Cassiodorus, who was a witness of
  their arguments, could not refrain from regretting that the genius of
  Cethegus, once so brilliant, had rusted for want of practice&mdash;but he had
  touched the proud woman on a much more sensitive subject.</p>

  <p>Her great father had been blessed with no son; only this one daughter had
  been born unto him. The wish for a male heir had been often heard in the
  mouths of the King and of his people, and had penetrated to the daughter's
  ears in her childish years. It outraged the feelings of the highly-gifted
  girl that, merely on account of her sex, she should be put lower than a
  possible brother, who, as a matter of course, would be more capable and more
  worthy of governing. So, when a child, she often wept bitter tears because
  she was not a boy. Of course, as she grew up, she only heard the offensive
  wish from the lips of her father; every other mouth praised the wonderful
  talent, the manly spirit and courage of the brilliant Princess. And these
  praises were not flattery; Amalaswintha was, indeed, a wonderful creature.
  The strength of her will, the power of her intellect, her love of authority,
  and cold abruptness of manner, far exceeded the limits which generally bound
  the sphere of feminine grace. The consciousness that when her hand was
  bestowed, the highest position in the kingdom, and perhaps the crown itself,
  would be given with it, did not contribute to render her more modest; and her
  deepest, strongest sentiment was no longer the wish to be a man, but the
  conviction that, even as a woman, she was as capable of performing all the
  duties of life and of government as the most gifted man&mdash;much more
  capable than most men&mdash;and that she was fated to refute the general
  prejudice, and to prove the equality of her sex.</p>

  <p>The married life of this cold woman with Eutharic, a member of another
  branch of the family, a man of a genial temperament and high intellect, was
  of short duration&mdash;in a few years Eutharic fell a victim to
  disease&mdash;and not at all happy. She had unwillingly obeyed her husband,
  and, as a widow, gloried in her freedom. She burnt with the desire to verify
  her favourite theory in her position as Queen-regent and guardian of her son.
  She would govern in such a manner, that the proudest man must acknowledge her
  superiority. We have seen how the anticipation of ruling had enabled her to
  bear the death of her great father with considerable equanimity. She assumed
  her high office with the greatest zeal and the most untiring activity. She
  wished to do everything alone. She thrust aside the aged Cassiodorus, for he
  was unable to keep pace with the eagerness of her spirit. She would endure no
  man's advice, and jealously watched over her absolute monarchy.</p>

  <p>To none but one of her servants did she willingly and frequently lend her
  ear: to him who often and loudly praised the manly independence of her mind,
  and still more often seemed to admire it in secret, and who appeared
  incapable of conceiving the desire to govern any of her actions: she trusted
  Cethegus alone.</p>

  <p>For he constantly evinced only <i>one</i> ambition&mdash;that of carrying
  out all the ideas and plans of the Queen with the most zealous care. He never
  opposed her favourite endeavours, like Cassiodorus and the heads of the
  Gothic parties, but supported her therein. He helped her to surround herself
  with Greeks and Romans; to exclude the young king, as far as possible, from
  all share in the government; gradually to remove from the court the old
  Gothic friends of her father, who, in the consciousness of their services and
  according to old custom, often took upon themselves to speak a word of open
  blame; to use the money which was intended for men-of-war, horses, and the
  armament of the Gothic forces, for art and science, or for the embellishment,
  preservation, and security of Rome; in short, he aided her in every act that
  would estrange her from her people, or render her government an object of
  hatred, and her kingdom defenceless.</p>

  <p>And if he himself had a plan he always knew how to give his transactions
  with the Queen such a turn, that she considered herself the promoter of every
  scheme, and ordered him to execute his most secret wishes as <i>her</i>
  commands.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-11"
     name="b1-11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">In order to gain and support this influence, it can easily
  be understood that Cethegus was forced to be more at court, and oftener
  absent from Rome, than was advantageous for his interests in that city.</p>

  <p>He therefore endeavoured to bring persons into close connection with the
  Queen, who would, in part, take his place, warmly defend his interests, and
  keep him <i>au fait</i> of all that passed in the court of Ravenna.</p>

  <p>Many Gothic nobles had left the court in anger, and it was necessary to
  replace their wives in their office near the Queen; and Cethegus determined
  to use this opportunity to bring Rusticiana, the daughter of Symmachus and
  wife of Boëthius, once more to court. It was no easy task. For the family of
  Boëthius, who had been executed as a traitor, had been banished the capital.
  Before anything could be done, the feeling which the Queen entertained
  towards this family must be completely altered. Cethegus, however, soon
  succeeded in appealing to the compassion and magnanimity of Amalaswintha, who
  possessed a noble heart. At the same time she had never really believed in
  the unproved guilt of the two noble Romans, one of whom, the husband of
  Rusticiana, she had honoured as an extremely learned man, and, in some
  points, as her teacher. Cethegus proved to her that by showing favour to this
  family, either as an act of grace or of justice, she would touch the hearts
  of all her Roman subjects, and he thus easily persuaded her to pardon the
  deeply degraded family.</p>

  <p>It was much more difficult to persuade the proud and passionate widow of
  the murdered man to accept this favour, for her whole soul was filled with
  bitterness against the royal house, and thirst for revenge. Cethegus even
  feared that when she was in the presence of the "tyrants," her ungovernable
  hatred might betray itself. In spite of the great influence he had over her,
  she had repeatedly rejected this plan.</p>

  <p>Matters had come to this pass, when, one day, Rusticiana made a discovery
  which shortly led to the fulfilment of the Prefect's wish.</p>

  <p>Rusticiana had a daughter of scarcely sixteen years of age, named Camilla.
  She was a lovely girl, with a face of the true Roman type, with nobly-formed
  features and chiselled lips. Intense feeling beamed from her dark eyes; her
  figure, slender almost to delicacy, was elegant and light as that of a
  gazelle, and all her movements were agile and graceful. She had loved her
  unhappy father with all the energy of filial devotion. The stroke that had
  laid his beloved head low had entered deeply into her own young life; and
  inconsolable and sacred grief, mixed with passionate admiration for his
  heroism, filled all her youthful thoughts. A welcome guest at court before
  her father's death, she had fled with her mother after the catastrophe over
  the Alps to Gaul, where they had found an asylum with an old friend, while
  Anicius and Severinus, Camilla's brothers, who had been also condemned, but
  who were afterwards reprieved and sent into banishment, hastened at once to
  the court at Byzantium, where they tried to move heaven and earth against the
  barbarians.</p>

  <p>When the first heat of persecution had abated, the two women had returned
  to Italy, and led a retired life in the house of one of their faithful
  freedmen at Perusia, whence, as we have seen, Rusticiana had easily found
  means to join the conspiracy in Rome.</p>

  <p>It was in June, that season of the year when the Roman
  aristocracy&mdash;then as at this day&mdash;fled the sultry air of the towns,
  and sought a refuge in their cool villas on the Sabine mountains, or at the
  sea-coast. The two noble women, used to every luxury, felt extremely ill at
  ease in the hot and narrow streets of Perusia, and thought with regret of
  their beautiful villas in Florence and Neapolis, which, together with all the
  rest of their fortune, had been confiscated by the Gothic Government.</p>

  <p>One day, their faithful servant, Corbulo, came to Rusticiana with a
  strangely embarrassed expression of countenance, and explained to her "how,
  having long since noticed how much the 'Patrona' suffered under his unworthy
  roof, and had to endure much annoyance from his handiwork&mdash;he being a
  mason&mdash;he had bought a small, a very small, estate, with a still smaller
  house, in the mountains near Tifernum. However, she must not compare it with
  the villa near Florentia; but still there ran a little brook near it, which
  never dried up, even under the dog-star; oaks and cornel-trees gave broad and
  pleasant shade; ivy grew luxuriantly over a ruined Temple of Faunus; and in
  the garden he had planted roses, lilies, and violets, such as Donna Camilla
  loved; and so he hoped that they would mount their mules or litter, and go to
  their villa like other noble dames."</p>

  <p>The ladies, much touched by their old servant's fidelity, gratefully
  accepted his kindness, and Camilla, who rejoiced like a child in the
  anticipation of a little change, was more cheerful and animated than she had
  ever been since her father's death.</p>

  <p>Impatiently she urged their departure, and hurried off beforehand the very
  same day, with Corbulo and his daughter, Daphnidion, leaving her mother to
  follow as soon as possible with the slaves and baggage.</p>

  <p>The sun was already sinking behind the hills of Tifernum when Corbulo,
  leading Camilla's mule by the bridle, reached an open place in the wood, from
  whence they first caught sight of the little estate. He had long pleased
  himself with the thought of the young girl's surprise when he should show her
  the prettily situated villa.</p>

  <p>But he suddenly stood still, struck with surprise; he held his hand before
  his eyes, fancying that the evening sun dazzled him; he looked around to see
  if he were really in the right place; but there was no doubt about it! There
  stood, on the ridge where wood and meadow met, the grey border-stone, in the
  form of the old frontier-god Terminus, with his pointed head. It was the
  right place, but the little house was nowhere to be seen; where it should
  have been, was a thick group of pines and plantains; and besides this, the
  whole place was changed; green hedges and flowerbeds stood where once
  cabbages and turnips grew; and where sandpits and the high-road had, till
  now, marked the limits of his modest property, rose an elegant pavilion.</p>

  <p>"The Mother of God and all the superior gods save me!" Cried the mason;
  "some magic must be at work!"</p>

  <p>His daughter hastily handed him the amulet that she carried at her girdle;
  but she was no wiser than he, for it was the first time that she had visited
  the new property; and so there was nothing left but to drive the mules
  forward as fast as possible. Father and daughter, leaping from stone to
  stone, accompanied the trotting mules to the bottom of the declivity with
  cries of encouragement.</p>

  <p>As they approached, Corbulo certainly discovered the house that he had
  bought behind the group of trees, but so changed, renewed, and beautified,
  that he scarcely recognised it.</p>

  <p>His astonishment at the transformation of the whole place tended to
  increase his superstitious fears. His mouth opened wide, he let the reins
  fall, stood stock-still, and he was beginning another wonderful speech,
  intermixed with heathen and Christian interjections, when Camilla, equally
  astounded, called out:</p>

  <p>"But that is the garden where we once lived, the Viridarium of Honorius at
  Ravenna! The same trees, the same flower-beds, and, by the lake, the little
  Temple of Venus, just as it once stood on the sea-shore at Ravenna! Oh, how
  beautiful! What a faithful memory! Corbulo, how did you manage it?" and tears
  of grateful emotion filled her eyes.</p>

  <p>"The devil and all the Lemures take me, if I had anything to do with it!
  But there comes Cappadox with his club foot; he at least is not bewitched.
  Speak, then, Cyclops, what has happened here?"</p>

  <p>Cappadox, a gigantic, broad-shouldered slave, came limping along with an
  uncouth smile, and after many questions, told a puzzling tale.</p>

  <p>About three weeks ago, a few days after he had been sent to the estate to
  manage it for his master, who had gone to the marble quarries of Luna, there
  came from Tifernum a noble Roman with a troop of slaves and workmen and
  heavily-packed wagons. He inquired if this was the estate bought by the
  sculptor Corbulo of Perusia for the widow of Boëthius. Upon being answered in
  the affirmative, he had introduced himself as the Hortulanus Princeps, that
  is, the superior intendant of the gardens at Ravenna. An old friend of
  Boëthius&mdash;who wished not to tell his name, for fear of the Gothic
  tyrants&mdash;desired to care for his family in secret, and had given orders
  that their summer residence should be improved and embellished with all
  possible art. He (Cappadox) was by no means to spoil the intended surprise,
  and, half-kindly, half by force, they had kept him fast in the villa. Then
  the intendant had immediately made his plan, and set his men to work. Many
  neighbouring fields were bought at a high price; and there began such a
  pulling-down and building-up, such a planting and digging, hammering and
  knocking, such a cleaning and painting, that it had made him both blind and
  deaf. When he ventured to meddle or ask questions the workmen laughed in his
  face.</p>

  <p>"And," concluded Cappadox, "it went on in this way till the day before
  yesterday. Then they had finished, and went away. At first I was afraid, and
  trembled when I saw all these splendid things growing out of the earth. I
  thought, if Master Corbulo has to pay for all this, then mercy on my poor
  back! and I wanted to come and tell you. But they would not let me go; and
  besides, I knew you were not at home. And when I saw what a ridiculous amount
  of money the intendant had with him, and how he threw the gold pieces about,
  as children throw pebbles, I got easier by degrees, and let things go on as
  they would. Now, master, I know well that you can set me in the stocks, and
  have me whipped with the vine-branch or even with the scorpion; for you are
  the master, and Cappadox the servant. But, master, it would scarcely be just!
  By all the saints and all the gods! For you set me over a few cabbage-fields,
  and see! they have become an Emperor's garden under my care!"</p>

  <p>Camilla had long since dismounted and disappeared, when the servant ended
  his account.</p>

  <p>Her heart beating with joy, she hurried through the garden, the bowers,
  the house; she flew as if on wings; the active Daphnidion could scarcely
  follow her. Repeated cries of astonishment and pleasure escaped her lips.
  Whenever she turned the corner of a path, or round a group of trees, a new
  picture of the garden at Ravenna met her delighted eyes.</p>

  <p>But when she entered the house, and in it found a small room painted,
  furnished, and decorated exactly like the room in the Imperial Palace, in
  which she had played away the last days of her childhood, and dreamed the
  first dreams of her maidenhood; the same pictures upon the hempen tapestry;
  the same vases and delicate citrean-wood[2] boxes; and, upon the same small
  tortoise-shell table, her pretty little harp with its swan's wings;
  overpowered by so many remembrances, and still more by the feeling of
  gratitude for such tender friendship, she sank sobbing on the soft cushions
  of the lectus.</p>

  <p class="footnote">2. The most valued wood&mdash;not the modern
  citron-tree.]</p>

  <p>Scarcely could Daphnidion calm her.</p>

  <p>"There are still noble hearts in the world; there are still friends of the
  house of Boëthius!" and she breathed a prayer of deep thankfulness to
  Heaven.</p>

  <p>When her mother arrived the next day, she was scarcely less moved by the
  strange surprise. She wrote at once to Cethegus in Rome, and asked: "In which
  of her husband's friends she should seek this secret benefactor?" Within her
  heart she hoped that it might turn out to be himself.</p>

  <p>But the Prefect shook his head over her letter and wrote back: "He knew no
  one of whom this delicate mode of proceeding reminded him. She should
  carefully watch for every trace that might lead to the solving of the
  riddle."</p>

  <p>It was not long ere it was solved. Camilla was never tired of traversing
  the garden, and continually discovering resemblances to its well-known
  original.</p>

  <p>She often extended her rambles beyond the park into the neighbouring wood.
  She was generally accompanied by the merry Daphnidion, whose similar youth
  and faithful affection soon won her confidence. Daphnidion had repeatedly
  remarked to her that they must be followed by a wood-sprite, for it often
  snapped in the branches and rustled in the grass near them, and yet there
  nowhere was a man or an animal to be seen.</p>

  <p>But Camilla laughed at her superstition, and often persuaded her to
  venture out again, far away under the green shadows of the elms and
  plantains.</p>

  <p>One hot day, as the two girls penetrated deeper and deeper into the
  greenwood they discovered a clear-running spring, that issued copiously from
  a dark porphyry rock. But it had no decided channel, and the thirsty maidens
  with difficulty collected the single silvery drops.</p>

  <p>"What a pity!" cried Camilla, "the delicious water! You should have seen
  the fountain of the Tritons in the Pinetum[3] at Ravenna. How prettily the
  water rushed from the inflated cheeks of the bronze sea-god, into the wide
  shell of brown marble! What a pity!" And they passed on.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[3. Pine-wood.]</p>

  <p>Some days after they both came again to the same place. Daphnidion, who
  was walking in front, suddenly stood still with a loud scream, and silently
  pointed at the spring.</p>

  <p>The woodland streamlet had been enclosed. From a bronze Triton's head the
  water fell, in a bright stream, into a delicate shell of brown marble.
  Daphnidion, now firmly believing in some magic, turned to fly without further
  ado; her hands pressed over her eyes, so as not to see the wood-sprite, which
  was considered to be extremely dangerous, she fled towards the house, calling
  loudly to her mistress to follow her.</p>

  <p>But a thought flashed through Camilla's mind. The spy who had lately
  followed them was certainly in the vicinity, revelling in their
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>She looked carefully about her. The blossoms of a 'wild rose-bush fell
  from its shaking boughs to the earth. She quickly stepped towards the
  thicket, and lo! a young hunter, with spear and game-bag, advanced towards
  her from out the bushes.</p>

  <p>"I am discovered," he said, in a low, shy voice. He looked very handsome
  in his embarrassment.</p>

  <p>But, with a cry of fear, Camilla started back.</p>

  <p>"Athalaric!" she stammered, "the King!"</p>

  <p>A whole sea of thoughts and feelings rushed through her brain and heart,
  and, half fainting, she sank upon, the grassy bank beside the spring.</p>

  <p>The young King, alarmed and delighted, stood for a few moments speechless
  before the tender figure lying at his feet. Thirstily his burning eye dwelt
  upon the beautiful features and noble form. A vivid flush shot like lightning
  over his pale face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, she&mdash;she is my death!" he breathed, pressing both hands to his
  beating heart. "To die now&mdash;to die with her!"</p>

  <p>Camilla moved her arm, which movement brought him to his senses; he
  kneeled down beside her, and wetted her temples with the cool water of the
  spring. She opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Barbarian! murderer!" she cried shrilly, thrust his hand away, sprang up,
  and fled like a frightened doe.</p>

  <p>Athalaric made no attempt to follow her.</p>

  <p>"Barbarian! murderer!" he murmured to himself, in great grief, and buried
  his glowing forehead in his hands.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-12"
     name="b1-12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">Camilla came home in such extreme excitement, that
  Daphnidion would not be convinced that she had not seen the nymphs, or even
  the venerable sylvan god, Picus, himself.</p>

  <p>But the maiden threw herself with wild emotion into the arms of her
  alarmed mother. The strife of confused feelings within her resolved itself
  into a flood of hot tears, and only later was she able to answer Rusticiana's
  anxious questions.</p>

  <p>A terrible struggle was taking place in the soul of this child. At the
  court of Ravenna it had not escaped the growing girl that the dark eyes of
  the beautiful Athalaric often rested upon her with a strange and dreamy
  expression, and that he eagerly listened to every tone of her voice. But a
  suspicion of deeper affection had never entered into her mind. The Prince,
  reserved and shy, cast down his eyes whenever she met his look with an
  unembarrassed and inquisitive glance. Were they not both at that time almost
  children?</p>

  <p>She did not know how to interpret Athalaric's manner&mdash;he scarcely
  could do so himself&mdash;and it had never occurred to her to reflect why she
  so gladly lived near him; why she liked to follow the bold flights of his
  thoughts and imaginations, differing so much from those of all other
  playfellows; why she loved to wander silently through the quiet gardens in
  the evening-light by the side of the silent boy, who often, in the midst of
  his reverie, addressed her with abrupt, but always significant, words; whose
  poetical feelings&mdash;the feelings of enthusiastic youth&mdash;she so
  completely understood and appreciated.</p>

  <p>The tender tissue of this budding inclination was violently torn by the
  catastrophe of her father's death, and not only gentle sorrow for the
  murdered man, but glowing hatred of his murderers, took possession of the
  passionate Roman girl's soul.</p>

  <p>At all times Boëthius, even when in the height of his favour at court, had
  displayed a haughty condescension to the barbarism of the Goths, and, since
  the catastrophe, all Camilla's companions&mdash;her mother, her two brothers
  (who thirsted for vengeance), and the friends of the house&mdash;breathed
  hatred and contempt, not only for the bloody murderer and tyrant, Theodoric,
  but for all Goths, and particularly for the daughter and grandson of the
  King, who, in their eyes, shared his guilt because they had not hindered
  it.</p>

  <p>So the maiden had almost ceased to think of Athalaric, and if he were
  named, or if, as often happened, his picture entered into her dreams, her
  hatred of the barbarians was concentrated in a feeling of the greatest
  abhorrence towards him, perhaps just because, in the depths of her heart,
  there lurked an involuntary suspicion of the secret inclination which she
  nourished for the handsome and noble youth.</p>

  <p>And now&mdash;now he had dared to lay a snare for her unsuspicious
  heart!</p>

  <p>No sooner had she seen him step from the bushes&mdash;no sooner did she
  recognise him, than she at once understood that it was he who had not only
  enclosed the spring, but caused the alteration of the whole estate. He, the
  hated enemy; he, the offspring of the cursed race which had shed the blood of
  her father: the King of the Goths!</p>

  <p>The joy with which, during the last few days, she had examined house and
  garden, was now changed into bitterness. The deadly enemy of her people, of
  her race, had dared to enrich her; to give her pleasure; to make her happy;
  for him she had breathed thankful prayers to Heaven! He had been bold enough
  to follow her steps, to listen to her words, to fulfil her lightest wish; and
  at the bottom of her soul lay the dreadful certainty that he loved her! The
  barbarian was insolent enough to show it. The tyrant of Italy dared to hope
  that the daughter of Boëthius&mdash;&mdash; Oh, it was too much! and, sobbing
  violently, she buried her head in the cushions of her couch, to which she had
  retired, until deep sleep of exhaustion overcame her.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Cethegus, who had been hastily sent for, came to visit the
  troubled woman.</p>

  <p>Rusticiana would fain have followed her own and Camilla's first impulse,
  to fly from the villa and the hated vicinity of the King, and hide her child
  on the other side of the Alps. But Camilla's condition had, till then,
  prevented their departure, and as soon as the Prefect entered the house, the
  flame of their excitement seemed to sink before his cold glances.</p>

  <p>He took Rusticiana alone with him into the garden. Leaning his back
  against a laurel-tree, and supporting his chin on his hand, he listened
  quietly and attentively to her passionate recital.</p>

  <p>"And now, speak," she concluded; "what shall I do? How shall I save my
  poor child? Whither shall I take her?"</p>

  <p>"Whither shall you take Camilla?" he repeated. "To the court, to
  Ravenna."</p>

  <p>Rusticiana started. "Why this ill-timed joke?"</p>

  <p>But Cethegus quickly stood erect. "I am in earnest. Be quiet and listen.
  Fate, that wills the destruction of the barbarians, could have laid no more
  gracious gifts upon our path. You know how completely I rule the
  Queen-regent, but you do not know how powerless I am over that obstinate
  enthusiast, Athalaric. It is enigmatical. The sick youth is, amongst all the
  nation, the only one who suspects, if he does not see through, me; and I do
  not know whether he most fears or hates me. That would be a matter of
  indifference to me if the audacious fellow did not very decidedly and very
  successfully act against me. Naturally, his opinion weighs heavily with his
  mother; often more than mine; and he will always grow older, riper, and more
  dangerous. His spirit exceeds his years; he takes a grave part in the
  councils of the Regency, and always speaks against me; he often prevails.
  'Twas but lately that, against my will, he succeeded in giving the command of
  the Gothic troops in Rome, in <i>my</i> Rome, to that bilious Teja. In short,
  the young King becomes highly dangerous. Until now I have not the shadow of
  authority over him. He loves Camilla to his peril; through her we will rule
  the unruly one."</p>

  <p>"Never!" cried Rusticiana; "never as long as I breathe! <i>I</i> at the
  court of the tyrants! My child, Boëthius's daughter, the beloved of
  Athalaric! Her father's bloody ghost would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would you avenge that ghost? Yes. Would you ruin the Goths? Yes.
  Therefore you must consent to everything which will lead to this end."</p>

  <p>"Never, by my oath!"</p>

  <p>"Woman, do not irritate me, do not oppose me! You know me. By your oath?
  Have you not sworn blind and unconditional obedience to me, calling down
  curses on yourself and your children should you break that oath? Caution is
  necessary when dealing with women! Obey, or tremble for your soul!"</p>

  <p>"Fearful man! Shall I sacrifice all my hatred to you and your
  projects?"</p>

  <p>"To me? who speaks of me? I plead <i>your</i> cause, I complete
  <i>your</i> revenge. The Goths have done nothing to <i>me</i>. <i>You</i>
  disturbed me from my books, <i>you</i> called upon me to aid you in
  destroying these Amelungs; do you repent? Very well. I will return to
  Horatius and the Stoics. Farewell!"</p>

  <p>"Remain, remain! But must Camilla be sacrificed?"</p>

  <p>"Folly! Athalaric will be the victim. She shall not love him, she shall
  only influence him&mdash;or," he added, looking sharply at her, "do you fear
  for her heart?"</p>

  <p>"May your tongue be paralysed! <i>My</i> daughter love <i>him</i>! Rather
  would I strangle her with these hands!"</p>

  <p>But Cethegus had become thoughtful. "It is not for the girl's sake," he
  thought, "that would not matter&mdash;but should she really love
  him?&mdash;the Goth is handsome, intellectual, enthusiastic&mdash;Where is
  your daughter?" he asked aloud.</p>

  <p>"In the women's apartment. Even should I wish it, she will never
  consent&mdash;never!"</p>

  <p>"We will attempt it. I will go to her."</p>

  <p>And they went into the house.</p>

  <p>Rusticiana would have entered the room with Cethegus, but he repulsed
  her.</p>

  <p>"I must have her alone," he said, and passed through the curtain.</p>

  <p>On seeing him, the beautiful girl rose from the cushions on which she had
  been resting, lost in helpless reverie. Accustomed to find in this wise and
  commanding man, her father's old friend, a constant adviser, she greeted him
  trustfully, as a patient greets his physician.</p>

  <p>"You know, Cethegus?"</p>

  <p>"Everything!"</p>

  <p>"And you bring me help and comfort?"</p>

  <p>"I bring you revenge, Camilla!"</p>

  <p>That was a new and startling idea! Hitherto to fly, to save herself from
  this torturing position, had been her only thought. At the most, an angry
  rejection of the royal gift. But now, revenge! Compensation for all the pain
  she had suffered! Revenge upon the murderers of her father! Her heart was
  deeply wounded, and in her veins boiled the hot blood of the south. She
  rejoiced at the words of her tempter.</p>

  <p>"Revenge? Who will revenge me? You?"</p>

  <p>"You will revenge yourself; that will be sweeter."</p>

  <p>Her eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"On whom?"</p>

  <p>"On him. On his house. On all your enemies."</p>

  <p>"How can I, a weak and timid girl?"</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Camilla. To you only, to the noble daughter of the noble
  Boëthius, will I unfold what I would trust to no other woman on earth. There
  exists a powerful league of patriots, who have sworn to extirpate the
  barbarians from the face of this country. The sword of revenge hangs
  trembling over the heads of the tyrants. The fatherland and the shade of your
  father call upon you to cause it to fall."</p>

  <p>"Upon me? <i>I</i>&mdash;revenge my father? Speak!" cried the maiden, her
  face glowing as she stroked back the dark locks from her temples.</p>

  <p>"There must be a sacrifice. Rome demands it."</p>

  <p>"My blood, my life! Like Virginia will I die!"</p>

  <p>"No; you shall live to triumph in your revenge. The King loves you. You
  must go to Ravenna, to court. You shall destroy him by means of his love. We
  have no power over him, but you will gain the mastery over his soul."</p>

  <p>"Destroy him!"</p>

  <p>She seemed strangely moved as she spoke thus in a low voice. Her bosom
  heaved; her voice trembled with the force of her opposing feelings. Tears
  burst from her eyes, she buried her face in her hands.</p>

  <p>Cethegus rose from his seat.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," he said, "I will go. I knew not&mdash;that you <i>loved</i>
  the King."</p>

  <p>A scream of anger, like that of physical pain, escaped the maiden's lips;
  she sprang up and grasped his arm.</p>

  <p>"Man! who said so? I hate him! Hate him more than I ever knew I could
  hate!"</p>

  <p>"Then prove it, for I do not believe it."</p>

  <p>"I will prove it!" she cried; "he shall die!"</p>

  <p>She threw back her head; her eyes sparkled fiercely; her dark tresses fell
  over her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"She loves him," thought Cethegus; "but it matters not, for she does not
  know it. She is only conscious of hating him. All is well."</p>

  <p>"He shall not live," repeated Camilla. "You shall see," she added with a
  wild laugh&mdash;"you shall see how I love him! What must I do?"</p>

  <p>"Obey me in everything."</p>

  <p>"And what do you promise in return? What shall he suffer?"</p>

  <p>"Unrequited love."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, that he shall!"</p>

  <p>"His kingdom and his race shall be ruined," continued Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"And he will know that it is through <i>me</i>!"</p>

  <p>"I will take care that he shall know that. When shall we start for
  Ravenna?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow! No; to-day, this instant." She stopped and grasped his hand.
  "Cethegus, tell me, am I beautiful?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, most beautiful!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she cried, tossing back her flowing hair, "Athalaric shall love me
  and perish! Away to Ravenna! I will and must see him!"</p>

  <p>And she rushed out of the room.</p>

  <p>Her whole soul was thirsting to be with the object of her love and
  hate.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-13"
     name="b1-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">That same day the inhabitants of the villa entered upon
  their journey to Ravenna.</p>

  <p>Cethegus sent a courier forward with a letter from Rusticiana to the
  Queen-regent. Therein the widow of Boëthius declared, "that by the mediation
  of the Prefect of Rome, she was now ready to accept the repeated invitation
  to return to court. She did not accept it as an act of pardon, but of
  conciliation; as a sign that the heirs of Theodoric wished to make amends for
  the injustice done to the deceased."</p>

  <p>This proud letter was written from Rusticiana's very heart, and Cethegus
  knew that such a step would do no harm, and would only exclude any suspicious
  construction that might be laid upon the sudden change in her sentiments.</p>

  <p>Half-way the travellers were met by a messenger bearing the Queen's
  answer, which bade them welcome to her court.</p>

  <p>Arrived in Ravenna, they were received by the Queen with all honours,
  provided with a retinue, and led into the rooms which they had formerly
  occupied. They were warmly welcomed by all the Romans at court.</p>

  <p>But the anger of the Goths&mdash;who abhorred Symmachus and Boëthius as
  ungrateful traitors&mdash;was greatly excited by this measure, which seemed
  to imply an indirect condemnation of Theodoric. The last remaining friends of
  that great King indignantly left the Italianised court.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, time, the diversions of the journey, and the arrival at
  Ravenna, had softened Camilla's excitement. Her anger had the more time to
  abate, as many weeks elapsed before she met Athalaric; for the young King was
  dangerously ill.</p>

  <p>It was said at court, that while on a visit to Aretium, whither he had
  gone to enjoy the mountain air, the baths, and the chase, he had drank from a
  rocky spring in the woods of Tifernum while heated with hunting, and had
  thereby brought on a violent attack of his former malady. The fact was, that
  his followers had found him lying senseless by the side of the spring where
  he had met Camilla.</p>

  <p>The effect of this story upon Camilla was strange. To the hate she bore to
  Athalaric was now added a slight feeling of compassion, and even a sort of
  self-reproach. But on the other side, she thanked Heaven that, by this
  illness, the meeting was postponed, which, now that she was in Ravenna, she
  feared no less than she had longed for it while far away in Tifernum.</p>

  <p>And as she wandered in the wide-spread grounds of the magnificent
  palace-gardens, she was repeatedly reminded of the anxious care with which
  Corbulo's little estate had been fashioned after this model.</p>

  <p>Days and weeks passed. Nothing was heard of the patient except that he was
  convalescent, but forbidden to leave his rooms. The physicians and courtiers
  who surrounded him often expressed to Camilla their admiration of his
  patience and strength of mind while suffering the most acute pains, his
  gratitude for the slightest service, and the noble mildness of his
  disposition.</p>

  <p>But when she caught herself listening with pleasure to these words of
  praise, she frowned angrily, and the thought arose within her: "And he did
  not oppose the murder of my father!"</p>

  <p>One hot July night, after long and restless wakefulness, Camilla towards
  daybreak had sunk into an uneasy slumber.</p>

  <p>Anxious dreams disturbed her.</p>

  <p>It seemed to her as if the ceiling of the room, with all its bas-reliefs,
  were sinking down upon her. Directly over her head was a beautiful young
  Hypnos, the gentle God of Sleep, modelled by the hand of a Greek.</p>

  <p>She dreamed that the drowsy god assumed the earnest, sorrowful features of
  his pale brother Thanatos.</p>

  <p>Softly and slowly the God of Death bent his countenance above her. He
  approached nearer and nearer. His features became more and more distinct. She
  already felt his breath upon her forehead. His beautiful lips almost touched
  her mouth. Then she recognised with affright the pale features&mdash;the dark
  eyes. It was Athalaric! With a scream she started up.</p>

  <p>The silver lamp had long since burnt out. The room was dim.</p>

  <p>A red light gleamed faintly through the window of spar-gypsum. She rose
  and opened it. The cocks were crowing, the first rays of the sun gently stole
  over the sea, of which, beyond the garden, she had a full view. She could no
  longer bear to remain in the close chamber.</p>

  <p>She threw a mantle over her shoulders and hurried softly out of the still
  silent palace, down the marble steps, and into the garden; across which the
  fresh morning wind from the neighbouring sea blew towards her.</p>

  <p>She hastened towards the sun and the sea, for, to the east, the high walls
  of the palace gardens rose directly out of the blue waves of the
  Adriatic.</p>

  <p>A gilded lattice-gate, and, beyond it, ten broad steps of white Hymettus
  marble, led to the little garden-harbour, in which rocked the light-oared
  gondolas with their lateen sails of purple linen-cloth, fastened with silver
  chains to the ornamental rams'-heads fixed right and left upon the marble
  quay.</p>

  <p>At the side of the lattice-gate towards the garden, the grounds ended in a
  spacious rotunda, which was surrounded with broad and shady pines. The ground
  was laid out with carefully-tended grassplots, intersected by neat paths, and
  diversified by gay beds of sweet-scented flowers. A spring, ornamentally
  enclosed, ran down the declivity into the sea. In the centre of this place
  was a small and antique Temple of Venus, overtopped by a single palm-tree,
  while burning-red saxifrage grew in the now empty niches of its outer walls.
  At the right of its long-closed door stood a bronze statue of Aeneas. The
  Julius Caesar to the left had fallen centuries ago. Theodoric had placed upon
  its pedestal a bronze statue of Amala, the mythic forefather of his
  house.</p>

  <p>Between these statues, from the steps of the little fane, was a splendid
  view through the lattice-gate over the sea, with its woody lagoon-islands,
  and a group of jagged rocks, called "the Needles of the Amphitrites."</p>

  <p>This had been a favourite resort of Camilla's childhood. And it was hither
  that she now bent her steps, lightly brushing the plentiful dew from the high
  grass as, with slightly-lifted garments, she hastened along the narrow
  pathway. She wished to behold the sun rise glowing from the sea.</p>

  <p>She advanced from behind the temple, passed to the estrade on the left,
  and had just set her foot upon the first step which led from the front of the
  temple to the lattice-gate, when she caught sight of a white figure reclining
  on the second step, with the head leaning against the balustrade and the face
  turned towards the sea.</p>

  <p>She recognised the black and silky hair; it was the young King.</p>

  <p>The meeting was so unexpected that there was no possibility of avoiding
  it. As if rooted to the ground, she stood still upon the first step.</p>

  <p>Athalaric sprang up and quickly turned. His pallid face was illumined by a
  vivid flush. But he was the first to recover himself, and said:</p>

  <p>"Forgive, Camilla. I could not expect you to come here at this hour. I
  will go; and leave you alone with the rising sun."</p>

  <p>And he flung his white mantle over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Remain, King of the Goths. I have no right to scare you away&mdash;and no
  intention," she added.</p>

  <p>Athalaric came a step nearer.</p>

  <p>"I thank you. And I beg one favour," he added, smiling. "Do not betray me
  to my physicians nor to my mother. All day long they shut me up so carefully,
  that I am obliged to escape before sunrise. For the fresh air, the
  sea-breeze, does me good; I feel that it cools me. You will not betray
  me?"</p>

  <p>He spoke so quietly. He looked so unembarrassed. This freedom from
  embarrassment confused Camilla. She would have felt more courageous if he had
  been more moved. She observed his coolness with pain, but not because she
  really cared for the Prefect's plans. So, in answer, she only shook her head
  in silence, and cast down her eyes.</p>

  <p>At that moment the rays of the sun reached the spot on which the pair were
  standing.</p>

  <p>The old temple and the bronze of the statues shone in the rosy light; and
  from the east a broad path of trembling gold was laid upon the smooth
  flood.</p>

  <p>"See, how beautiful!" cried Athalaric, carried away by his admiration.
  "Look at that bridge of light and glory!"</p>

  <p>She joined in his admiration, and looked out over the sea.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember, Camilla," he continued slowly, as if lost in
  recollection, and not looking at her, "do you remember how we played here
  when we were children? How we dreamed? We said that the golden path painted
  on the waters by the sun, led to the Islands of the Blessed."</p>

  <p>"To the Islands of the Blessed!" repeated Camilla. In secret she was
  wondering at the delicacy and ease with which, avoiding every allusion to
  their last meeting, he conversed with her in a manner, which completely
  disarmed her.</p>

  <p>"And look, how the statues glitter, that wonderful pair, Aeneas
  and&mdash;Amala! Listen, Camilla, I have something to beg pardon for."</p>

  <p>Her heart beat rapidly. He was going to speak of the rebuilding of the
  Villa and the fountain. The blood rose to her cheeks. She remained silent in
  painful expectation.</p>

  <p>But the youth continued quietly:</p>

  <p>"You know how often&mdash;you the Roman, and I the Goth&mdash;vied with
  each other here in praises of the glory and fame and manners of our people.
  Then you stood under the statue of Aeneas, and told me of Brutus and
  Camillus, of Marcellus and the Scipios. And I, leaning against the shield of
  my ancestor Amala, praised Ermanaric and Alaric and Theodoric. But you spoke
  more eloquently than I. And often, when the glory of your heroes threatened
  to outshine mine, I laughed at your dead greatness, and cried, 'The living
  present and the glowing future belong to my people!'"</p>

  <p>"Well, and now?"</p>

  <p>"I speak so no more. You have won, Camilla!"</p>

  <p>But even while he spoke thus, he looked prouder than ever.</p>

  <p>And this expression of superiority revolted the Roman girl. Besides that,
  she was irritated by the unapproachable coolness with which the King, upon
  whose passion for her such plans were being founded, stood before her. She
  did not understand this tranquillity. She had hated him because he had dared
  to show her his love, and now her hate revived because he was able to conceal
  it. With the intention to hurt his feelings she slowly said:</p>

  <p>"So you acknowledge, King of the Goths, that your barbarians are inferior
  to the civilised nations?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Camilla," he answered quietly; "but only in one thing: in good luck.
  In the favours of Fate as well as of Nature. Look at that group of fishermen,
  who are hanging up their nets on the olive-trees upon the strand. How
  beautiful are their forms! In motion and repose, in spite of their rags, they
  are complete statues! Look at that girl with the amphora on her head. And
  there, at that old woman, who, leaning her head on her arm, lies upon the
  sand and gazes out dreamily over the sea. Each beggar amongst them looks like
  a dethroned king. How beautiful they are! At one with themselves and happy!
  The glory of uninterrupted happiness lies upon them, as it does upon
  children, or upon noble animals! This is wanting to us barbarians!"</p>

  <p>"Is that alone wanting to you?"</p>

  <p>"No, Fate is not gracious to us&mdash;my poor, glorious people! We have
  been carried away into a strange world, in which we do not flourish. We
  resemble the flower of the high Alps, the Edelweiss, which has been carried
  by the stormy wind to the hot sands of the low-levels. We cannot take root
  here. We fade and die." And overcome with noble sadness, he turned away and
  looked over the blue waves.</p>

  <p>But Camilla was not in the humour to reflect upon these prophetic words
  spoken by a king of his people.</p>

  <p>"Why did you overstep the mountains which God set as an eternal boundary
  between your people and ours?" she asked. "Say, why?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know," answered Athalaric, without looking at her, almost as if
  thinking aloud, "do you know why the dark moth flies to the bright flame?
  Again and again! Warned by no pain, until it is devoured by the beautiful but
  dangerous element? From what motive? From a sweet madness! And it is just
  such a sweet madness that has enticed my fellow-Goths away from the fir and
  the oak to the laurel and the olive. They will burn their wings, the foolish
  heroes, and will not cease to do so. Who can blame them for it? Look around
  you! How deeply blue the sky! How deeply blue the sea! And in it are
  reflected the summits of the pines and the white glitter of the marble
  temples! And away in the distance arise blue mountains; and out in the waters
  swim green islands, where the vine clings to the elm. And, above all, the
  soft, warm and caressing air that illumines the whole with a magic light.
  What wonders of form and colour does the eye drink, and what sweetness do the
  delighted senses breathe! This is the magic charm which will for ever entice
  and undo us!"</p>

  <p>The deep emotion of the young King did not fail to make an impression upon
  Camilla. The tragic force of his words affected her; but she <i>would</i> not
  be moved. She defended herself against the increasing softness of her
  feelings. She said coldly:</p>

  <p>"A whole nation enchanted by this magic, in spite of reason and judgment?"
  and she looked at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>But she was startled; for like lightning flashed the eyes of the youth,
  and his long-withheld passion broke out suddenly without restraint.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I tell thee, maiden! a whole people can nourish a foolish passion, a
  sweet destructive madness, a deadly longing, as well as&mdash;as well as a
  single man! Yes, Camilla, there is a power in the heart, which, stronger than
  reason and will, forcibly draws us with open eyes to destruction. But thou
  knowest it not, and mayst thou never experience it. Never! Farewell!"</p>

  <p>He quickly turned away and entered a bowery walk of climbing vines to the
  right of the temple, which immediately hid him from Camilla, as well as from
  the windows of the palace. The girl remained standing in deep reflection. His
  last words echoed strangely in her ears. For a long time she looked out
  dreamily over the open sea, and at last returned to the palace, filled with
  strangely conflicting feelings, and in an altered mood.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-14"
     name="b1-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">On the same day Cethegus paid a visit to the two ladies. He
  had come over from Rome on important business, and had just left the
  privy-council which had been held in the invalid King's room. His energetic
  features were full of repressed anger.</p>

  <p>"To work, Camilla!" he cried. "You are too long about it. This impertinent
  boy becomes more and more unmanageable. He defies me and Cassiodorus, and
  even his mother. He is intimate with dangerous people. With old Hildebrand
  and Witichis and their friends. He sends and receives letters behind our
  backs. He has managed that the Queen may never hold a council of the regency
  except in his presence. And in the council he crosses all our plans. This
  must cease. In one way or another."</p>

  <p>"I have no more hope of influencing the King," said Camilla gravely.</p>

  <p>"Why? Have you already seen him?"</p>

  <p>The girl reflected. She had promised Athalaric not to allow his
  disobedience to come to the ears of his physicians; and besides, it went
  against her feelings to desecrate and betray their meeting. So she avoided
  the question and said:</p>

  <p>"If the King refuses to obey his mother, the Queen-regent, he is not
  likely to suffer himself to be controlled by a young girl."</p>

  <p>"What sweet simplicity!" laughed Cethegus. And he dropped the conversation
  as long as the girl remained in the room. But afterwards, in private, he
  forced from Rusticiana a promise to manage matters so that her daughter in
  future might frequently see and speak to the King. It was possible to do
  this, for Athalaric's health rapidly improved. He became daily more manly and
  more decided. It seemed as if his opposition to Cethegus strengthened him
  both bodily and mentally.</p>

  <p>In a very short time he again spent many hours of the day in the extensive
  pleasure-grounds. It was here that his mother and the family of Boëthius
  frequently met him in the evening.</p>

  <p>And while Rusticiana appeared to receive the gracious courtesies of the
  Queen with answering friendship, listening attentively to her confidential
  remarks, in order afterwards to report them, word for word, to the Prefect,
  the two young people walked before them through the shady paths of the
  garden. Often this select company entered one of the light gondolas in the
  little harbour, and Athalaric rowed them himself over the blue sea to one of
  the small wooded isles which lay not far away. On the return home, the purple
  sails were spread, and the fresh breeze, which always arose at sunset,
  carried them gently and idly back. Camilla and the King, accompanied by
  Daphnidion, frequently enjoyed this trip over the waves alone.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha naturally saw the danger of increasing by such freedom the
  inclination of her son for Camilla, which had not escaped her notice; but,
  above all other considerations, she was thankful for the favourable influence
  which this companionship evidently exercised upon her son. In Camilla's
  presence he was quieter and more cheerful; and at the same time more gentle
  in his manner to herself, which had often been abrupt and violent. He also
  controlled his feelings with a mastery which was doubly surprising in such an
  irritable invalid. And, lastly, the Queen-regent, supposing that his
  inclination should indeed ripen to earnest love, would not be averse to an
  alliance which promised completely to win the Roman aristocracy, and erase
  all memory of a cruel deed.</p>

  <p>In Camilla a wonderful change was going forward. Day by day, as she more
  and more clearly saw the noble tenderness, the gifted soul, and the deep and
  poetical feelings of the young King develop, she felt her hate melt away.
  With difficulty she recalled to her memory the fate of her father, as an
  antidote to this sweet poison; she learnt better to distinguish justly which
  of the Goths and Amelungs had contributed to that fate, and, with growing
  certainty, she felt that it was unjust to hate Athalaric for a misfortune
  which he had merely not opposed, and indeed would hardly have been able to
  prevent. She would have liked, long ago, to speak to him openly, but she
  mistrusted her own weakness; she shunned it as a sin against father,
  fatherland, and her own freedom; she trembled as she felt how indispensable
  this noble youth had become to her, how much she thirsted to hear his
  melodious voice, and look into his dark and thoughtful eyes. She feared this
  sinful love&mdash;which she could now scarcely conceal from herself&mdash;and
  she would not part with the only weapon that remained to her: the reproach of
  his passive acquiescence in her father's death.</p>

  <p>So she fluctuated from feeling to feeling; all the more hesitatingly, the
  more mysterious Athalaric's strange reserve became. After all that had
  happened, she could not doubt that he loved her; and yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>Not a syllable, not a look betrayed this love. The exclamation with which
  he had left her at the Temple of Venus was the most important, the only
  important speech that had escaped him. She could not suspect what the youth
  had suffered before his love had become not extinguished, but self-denying.
  And still less in what new feeling he had found manly strength enough for
  such renunciation.</p>

  <p>Her mother, who watched Athalaric with all the keenness of hate, and, in
  doing so, forgot to observe her own child, appeared even more astonished at
  his coldness.</p>

  <p>"But patience," she said to Cethegus, with whom she often consulted behind
  Camilla's back. "Patience! soon, in three days' time, you will see him
  alter."</p>

  <p>"It is high time," answered Cethegus. "But upon what grounds do you
  build?"</p>

  <p>"Upon a means which has never yet failed me."</p>

  <p>"You will not, surely, mix a love-philtre for him?" asked the Prefect,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I shall. I have done so already."</p>

  <p>He looked at her mockingly.</p>

  <p>"And are you, then, so superstitious, you, the widow of the great
  philosopher, Boëthius? Upon my word, in love affairs all women are mad
  alike!"</p>

  <p>"It is neither madness nor superstition," replied Rusticiana quietly. "Our
  family has possessed this secret charm for more than a hundred years. An
  Egyptian woman once gave it to one of my female ancestors on the Nile, and it
  has always proved its power. No woman of my family has ever loved without
  requital."</p>

  <p>"That required no magic," observed the Prefect. "You are a handsome
  race."</p>

  <p>"Spare your sarcasm. The love-philtre is unfailing, and if it has not yet
  taken effect&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So you have really&mdash;&mdash; What imprudence! How could you,
  unobserved&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Every evening, when he returns from a walk or a row with us, Athalaric
  takes a cup of spiced Falernian. The physicians ordered it. There are some
  drops of Arabian balsam in it. The cup always stands ready upon the marble
  table in front of the temple. Three times I have succeeded in pouring in my
  potion."</p>

  <p>"Well," observed Cethegus, "until now it has done no particular good."</p>

  <p>"That is only owing to my impatience. The herbs must be gathered during
  the new moon. I knew it well enough; but, hurried by your insistence, I tried
  it during the full moon, and, you see, it was not effectual."</p>

  <p>Cethegus shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"But yesterday," she went on, "it was new moon. I was not idle with my
  golden scissors, and when he drinks now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A second Locusta! Well, <i>my</i> comfort is Camilla's beautiful eyes!
  Does she know of your arts?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word to her! She would never suffer it. Silence! She comes!"</p>

  <p>The girl entered in great excitement; her oval cheeks were red; a plait of
  her hair had got loose, and floated over her lovely neck.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she cried, "you who are wise and experienced, tell me what to
  think! I come from the boat. Oh, he has never loved me, the haughty man! He
  pities, he is sorry for me! No, that is not the right word. I cannot explain
  it." And bursting into tears, she hid her face upon her mother's neck.</p>

  <p>"What has happened, Camilla?" asked Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"Very often before," she began, with a heavy sigh, "an expression played
  about his mouth, and filled his eyes, as if <i>he</i> had been deeply
  offended by <i>me</i>, as if <i>he</i> had to forgive, as if <i>he</i> had
  made a great sacrifice for me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Raw boys always imagine it to be a sacrifice, when they are in love."</p>

  <p>At this Camilla's eyes flashed; she tossed her head, and turned quickly
  upon Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"Athalaric is no boy, and no one shall laugh at him!"</p>

  <p>Cethegus was silent, and quietly dropped his eyelids; but Rusticiana asked
  in surprise:</p>

  <p>"Do you hate the King no more?"</p>

  <p>"To the death! He shall be undone, but not mocked!"</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" repeated Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"To-day I again noticed that puzzling, proud, and cold expression upon his
  face more distinctly than ever. A little incident occurred which caused the
  King to speak more plainly. An insect&mdash;a beetle&mdash;had fallen into
  the water. The King stooped and took it out, but the little creature turned
  against the beneficent hand, and bit the fingers that held it. 'The
  ungrateful thing!' I exclaimed. 'Oh,' said Athalaric, with a bitter smile,
  'we wound most those to whom we are most indebted!' and he glanced at me with
  a sad and proud expression. But, as if he had said too much, he briefly bid
  me farewell, and went away; but I&mdash;&mdash;" and her bosom heaved, her
  finely-cut lips were compressed&mdash;"I can bear it no longer! The haughty
  one! He <i>shall</i> love me&mdash;or die!"</p>

  <p>"That shall he," said Cethegus inaudibly; "one or the other."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-15"
     name="b1-15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">A few days later the court was surprised by a new step
  towards independence on the part of the young King. He himself summoned a
  council, a prerogative which, until now, had only been assumed by
  Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>The Queen-regent was not a little astonished when a messenger from her son
  bade her repair to his apartments, where the King had already assembled
  several of the highest officials of the realm, both Goths and Romans. Amongst
  these last were Cassiodorus and Cethegus.</p>

  <p>At first the latter had intended to absent himself, in order not by his
  presence to acknowledge the right which the youth had assumed; he suspected
  nothing good. But just for this reason he altered his mind.</p>

  <p>"I must not turn my back upon danger, I must face it," he said as he
  prepared for the distasteful assembly.</p>

  <p>He found all those who had been invited already collected in the King's
  chamber. The Queen alone was still absent. When she at last entered,
  Athalaric, who wore a long and wide purple robe, with the crown of Theodoric
  shining upon his brow, and his sword at his side, rose from his throne
  (behind which was a niche covered by a curtain), advanced to the Queen and
  led her to a second and higher throne, which, however, was placed on the
  left. So soon as she was seated he began:</p>

  <p>"My royal mother, brave Goths, noble Romans! We have assembled you here to
  make known to you our will. Dangers threatened this kingdom which only we,
  its King, could avert."</p>

  <p>Such a speech had never yet been heard from his lips. All were silent and
  confounded; Cethegus from prudence; he waited for the proper moment. At last
  Cassiodorus began:</p>

  <p>"Your wise mother and your faithful servant Cassiodorus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My faithful servant Cassiodorus will be silent until his lord and King
  asks his advice. We are discontented, highly discontented, with that which
  the advisers of our mother have, until now, done and left undone. It is high
  time that we ourselves should look to the right. Until now we were too young
  and too ailing. We feel so no more. We announce to you that we accordingly
  annul the regency, and take the reins of government into our own hands."</p>

  <p>He ceased. Every one remained silent. None wished, like Cassiodorus, to
  speak and be rebuked.</p>

  <p>At length Amalaswintha, who was quite stunned by the sudden energy
  displayed by her son, again found her tongue:</p>

  <p>"My son, the age of minority is, according to the laws of the
  Emperor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Romans, mother, may abide by the Emperor's laws. We are Goths and
  live under Gothic law. German youths are of age when the assembled army has
  declared them capable of bearing arms. We have therefore determined to invite
  all the generals, counts, and freemen of our realm, as many as will obey our
  call, from all the provinces of the kingdom, to a review of the army at
  Ravenna. They will arrive at the next solstitial feast."</p>

  <p>All were mute with surprise.</p>

  <p>"That will be in fourteen days," said Cassiodorus at last. "Will it be
  possible to issue summonses in so short a time?"</p>

  <p>"They are issued. Hildebrand, my old master-at-arms, and Earl Witichis
  have thought of everything."</p>

  <p>"Who has signed the summonses!" asked Amalaswintha, taking courage.</p>

  <p>"I alone, dear mother. It was necessary to show those invited that I was
  old enough to act alone."</p>

  <p>"And without my knowledge!" cried the Queen-regent.</p>

  <p>"It was done without your knowledge, because otherwise it must have been
  done against your will."</p>

  <p>He ceased. All the Romans were confounded by the suddenly developed energy
  of the young King. Only Cethegus was at once resolved to prevent the review
  at any price. He saw the foundations of all his plans tottering. Gladly would
  he have come to the help of the regency, which was thus sinking before his
  very eyes, with all the weight of his oratory; he would have long since
  gladly crushed the bold efforts of the youth with his calm superiority, but a
  strange circumstance held his thoughts and tongue enchained as if in magic
  bonds.</p>

  <p>He fancied he heard a noise behind the curtain, and fixed a keen look upon
  it. He soon remarked beneath it, for the fringes did not quite reach the
  ground, the feet of a man. But only as far up as the ankles.</p>

  <p>Upon these ankles, however, were steel greaves of peculiar construction.
  He knew these greaves; he knew that they belonged to a full suit of armour of
  the same make; he knew also, by an instinctive connection of ideas, that the
  wearer of this armour was hateful and dangerous to him. But still it was
  impossible for him to say who this enemy was. If he could only have seen the
  greaves as far up as the knee!</p>

  <p>His eyes wandered again and again to the same spot. Against his will his
  mind was occupied in guessing. And this circumstance kept his attention
  fixed, at a moment when everything was at stake. He was angry with himself,
  but he could not tear his thoughts and looks away from the niche.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the King continued without contradiction: "Further, we have
  recalled the noble Dukes Thulun, Ibba and Pitza, who have left our court in
  ill-will, from Gaul and Spain. We find that too many Romans and too few Goths
  surround us. These three brave warriors, together with Earl Witichis, will
  examine the defences of our kingdom, the fortresses and ships, and will
  discover and remedy all deficiencies. We expect them to arrive shortly."</p>

  <p>"They must at once leave the place again," said Cethegus to himself; but
  his thoughts repeated, "not without reason is that man concealed behind the
  curtain."</p>

  <p>"Further," resumed Athalaric, "we have ordered Mataswintha, our beautiful
  sister, to return to court. She was banished to Tarento because she refused
  to become the wife of an aged Roman. She shall return, the loveliest flower
  of our realm and an ornament to our court."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" cried Amalaswintha; "you attack the rights, not only of the
  Queen, but of the mother."</p>

  <p>"I am the head of the family as soon as I am of age."</p>

  <p>"My son, you know how feeble you were only a few weeks ago. Do you really
  believe that the Gothic warriors will declare you capable of bearing
  arms?"</p>

  <p>The King became as scarlet as his royal purple, partly from shame, partly
  from anger. Before he could find an answer, a rough voice at his side
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Be not troubled about that, your Majesty! I have been his master,"
  continued the speaker, turning to the assembly: "I tell you that he can
  measure his strength against any foe; and whom old Hildebrand declares
  capable of bearing arms is considered so by all the Goths."</p>

  <p>Loud applause from all the Goths present confirmed this assertion. Again
  Cethegus would have put in his word, but a movement behind the curtain drew
  his attention away. "It is one of my greatest enemies, but who?" he
  thought.</p>

  <p>"There is yet an important matter to make known to you," again began the
  King with a hasty glance at the niche, which did not escape Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps an accusation against me," thought the latter; "they want to take
  me by surprise? They shall not succeed!"</p>

  <p>But it surprised him, after all, when the King suddenly called in a loud
  voice:</p>

  <p>"Prefect of Rome! Cethegus Cæsarius!"</p>

  <p>Cethegus started; but, quickly recovering himself, bent his head and
  answered: "My Lord and King!"</p>

  <p>"Have you nothing to announce from Rome? What is the feeling of the
  Quirites? What do people think of the Goths?"</p>

  <p>"They are honoured as the people of Theodoric."</p>

  <p>"Are they feared?"</p>

  <p>"There is no cause to fear them."</p>

  <p>"Are they loved?"</p>

  <p>Gladly would the Prefect have replied, "There is no cause to love them;"
  but the King himself continued:</p>

  <p>"So there is no trace of discontent? No cause for uneasiness? Nothing
  particular in preparation?"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to communicate."</p>

  <p>"Then you are badly informed, Prefect of Rome, or badly disposed! What?
  must I&mdash;who have scarcely risen from my sick-bed here at
  Ravenna&mdash;tell you what happens in Rome under your very eyes? The workmen
  on your bulwarks sing satirical songs against the Goths, against the Queen,
  against me. Your legions use threatening words while practising the use of
  their arms. Most probably there exists already a widespread conspiracy, with
  senators and priests at its head. They assemble by night in secret places. An
  accomplice of Boëthius, a banished man, Albinus, has been seen in Rome, and
  do you know where? In the garden of your house."</p>

  <p>All eyes&mdash;either in astonishment, rage, or fear&mdash;were fixed upon
  Cethegus. Amalaswintha trembled for the object of her trust. But he was now
  quite himself again. Quiet, cool, and silent, he looked full at the King.</p>

  <p>"Justify yourself!" exclaimed the King.</p>

  <p>"Justify myself? Against a shadow, a report? Against an accusation without
  accusers? Never!"</p>

  <p>"We shall know how to force you."</p>

  <p>The Prefect's thin lips curled with contempt.</p>

  <p>"I may be murdered upon mere suspicion, without doubt&mdash;we Italians
  have experienced such a thing&mdash;but not condemned. There can be no
  justification opposed to force."</p>

  <p>"Justice shall be done, doubt it not. We charge all Romans present with
  the examination, and leave the sentence to the Roman Senate. Choose a
  defender."</p>

  <p>"I defend myself," said Cethegus coolly. "What is the accusation? Who is
  my accuser? Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Here!" cried the King, and threw back the curtain.</p>

  <p>A Gothic warrior, in a full suit of black armour, stepped forth. We
  already know him. It was Teja.</p>

  <p>The Prefect turned away his eyes in deadly hatred.</p>

  <p>Teja spoke.</p>

  <p>"I, Teja, son of Tagila, accuse thee, Cethegus Cæsarius, of treason
  against the Goths. I accuse thee of having hidden the banished traitor,
  Albinus, in thy house in Rome. Death is the penalty. And, besides this, thou
  art plotting to subject this country to the Emperor of Byzantium."</p>

  <p>"That least of all," said Cethegus coolly, "Prove your accusation."</p>

  <p>"I saw Albinus, with my own eyes, entering thy garden fourteen days ago,"
  continued Teja, turning to the assembly. "He came from the Via Sacra,
  enveloped in a mantle, a wide-brimmed hat upon his head. I had seen him on
  two former occasions; this time I recognised him. As I went towards him, he
  disappeared through a door, which closed behind him."</p>

  <p>"Since when does my colleague, the brave Commandant of Rome, play the
  nightly spy?"</p>

  <p>"Since he had a Cethegus at his side," retorted Teja. "But as the fugitive
  escaped, this roll fell from his mantle. It contains the names of
  distinguished Romans, and opposite to each name notices in an unknown cipher.
  Here is the roll."</p>

  <p>He gave it to the King, who read:</p>

  <p>"The names are Silverius, Cethegus, Licinius, Scævola, Calpurnius,
  Pomponius. Canst thou swear, Teja, that the disguised man was Albinus?"</p>

  <p>"I will swear it."</p>

  <p>"Prefect of Rome, Earl Teja is a free, unblemished, honourable man. Can
  you deny it?"</p>

  <p>"I deny it. He is not unblemished. His parents lived in an illegal,
  incestuous marriage; they were sister's children. The Church has cursed their
  connection and its fruit. He is a bastard, and can not bear witness against a
  noble Roman of senatorial rank."</p>

  <p>A murmur of anger burst from all the Goths present. Teja's pale face
  became still paler. He grasped his sword.</p>

  <p>"Then I will defend my word with my sword," he said, in a voice stifled by
  rage. "I challenge thee to mortal combat! God shall judge between us!"</p>

  <p>"I am a Roman, and do not act according to your barbaric customs. But even
  if I were a Goth, I would refuse to fight a bastard!"</p>

  <p>"Patience," said Teja, and quietly returned his sword to its sheath.
  "Patience, my sword; thy day will come!"</p>

  <p>The Romans in the room breathed again.</p>

  <p>The King resumed:</p>

  <p>"However that may be, the accusation is sufficiently well founded to
  justify the arrest of the said Roman. You, Cassiodorus, will decipher the
  secret writing. You, Earl Witichis, will hasten to Rome and make sure of the
  five suspected men; search their houses, and that of the Prefect. Hildebrand,
  arrest the accused, and take his sword."</p>

  <p>"Hold!" said Cethegus. "I will guarantee not to leave Ravenna until this
  question be settled, with the forfeiture of all my property. I demand an
  examination upon a free footing; such is the right of a senator."</p>

  <p>"Trouble not thyself about that, my son," cried old Hildebrand to the
  King. "Let me arrest him!"</p>

  <p>"Let him alone," answered the King. "He shall have strict justice. Leave
  him. The accusation has taken him by surprise. He shall have time to prepare
  his defence. To-morrow at this hour we will meet here again. I dissolve the
  assembly."</p>

  <p>He made a sign with his sceptre. Amalaswintha hurried away in the greatest
  excitement.</p>

  <p>The Goths surrounded Teja, greatly pleased; but the Romans passed quickly
  by Cethegus, avoiding any speech with him.</p>

  <p>Cassiodorus alone stepped firmly up to him, laid his hand upon his
  shoulder, looking searchingly into his eyes, and then asked:</p>

  <p>"Cethegus, can I help you?"</p>

  <p>"No; I will help myself," answered Cethegus, shaking him off, and went out
  alone with a proud step.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-16"
     name="b1-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">The heavy blow which the young King had so unexpectedly
  aimed at the whole system of the Regency soon filled the palace and the city
  with astonishment, fright, or joy. Cassiodorus took the first decided news to
  the family of Boëthius, at the same time sending Rusticiana to comfort the
  agitated Queen.</p>

  <p>Overwhelmed with questions, he circumstantially related the whole
  proceeding; and disturbed and indignant though he was, his admiration of the
  decision and courage of the young King shone unmistakably through his
  unfriendly report.</p>

  <p>Camilla listened with eagerness to every word; pride in the
  beloved&mdash;love's happiest feeling&mdash;filled her whole soul.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt," concluded Cassiodorus, sighing, "that Athalaric is
  our most decided adversary. He sticks to the Gothic party&mdash;to Hildebrand
  and his friends. He will undo the Prefect. Who would have believed it? I
  cannot help remembering, Rusticiana, how differently he conducted himself
  with regard to the process against your husband."</p>

  <p>Camilla listened attentively.</p>

  <p>"At that time we were convinced that he would be the most ardent friend,
  the most zealous advocate of the Romans."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing of it," said Rusticiana.</p>

  <p>"It was hushed up. The sentence of death had been pronounced upon Boëthius
  and his sons. In vain had we all, Amalaswintha foremost, appealed to the
  clemency of the King: his ire was unappeasable. As I again and again besieged
  him with petitions, he started up in anger and swore by his crown, that he
  who again dared to petition for the traitors, should repent it in the deepest
  dungeon of the palace. At that we were all dumb, except one. Athalaric, the
  boy, would not be repulsed; he wept and prayed, and clung to his
  grandfather's knees."</p>

  <p>Camilla trembled and held her breath.</p>

  <p>"And he did not desist," Cassiodorus went on, "until Theodoric, starting
  up in a rage, pushed him violently away, and delivered him to the guards. The
  King kept his oath. Athalaric was led into the castle dungeon, and Boëthius
  was at once executed."</p>

  <p>Camilla tottered, felt herself sinking, and caught at a slender pillar
  near which she was standing.</p>

  <p>"But Athalaric had not spoken and suffered in vain," continued
  Cassiodorus. "The next evening, while at table, the King sorely missed his
  darling. He remembered with what noble courage the youth had begged for his
  friend's life, when all men were dumb with fear. At last he rose from his
  repast, at which he had sat reflecting for some time, and descended in person
  to the prison, opened the doors, embraced his grandson, and granted his
  petition to spare the lives of your sons, Rusticiana."</p>

  <p>"Away! away to him!" exclaimed Camilla, and hurried, unnoticed, out of the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"At that time," concluded Cassiodorus, "Romans and their friends believed
  that in the young King they had found their best support; and now&mdash;my
  unfortunate mistress, unhappy mother!" and with this lament upon his lips, he
  departed.</p>

  <p>Rusticiana sat for some time as if stunned. She saw the foundations, upon
  which she had built her plans of revenge, totter; she sank into a moody
  reverie.</p>

  <p>Longer and longer stretched the shadows of the towers across the court of
  the palace, into which she was gazing. All at once she was roused by the firm
  footsteps of a man; Cethegus stood before her. His countenance was cold and
  dark, but icily calm.</p>

  <p>"Cethegus!" cried the distressed woman, hurrying towards him; and would
  have taken his hand, but his coldness repulsed her.</p>

  <p>"All is lost!" she sighed, stopping short.</p>

  <p>"Nothing is lost. Calmness is all that is wanting&mdash;and promptness,"
  he added, looking round the room.</p>

  <p>When he saw that he was alone with her, he put his hand into the folds of
  his toga.</p>

  <p>"Your love-philtre has done no good, Rusticiana. Here is another; more
  potent. Take it," and he thrust into her hand a small phial made of
  dark-coloured lava-stone.</p>

  <p>She looked into his face with anxious suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Do you all at once believe in magic and charms? Who has mixed it?"</p>

  <p>"I," he answered, "and <i>my</i> potions work."</p>

  <p>"You!" a cold shudder ran through her frame.</p>

  <p>"Ask no questions, do not delay," he commanded. "It must be done this day!
  Do you hear? This very day!"</p>

  <p>But Rusticiana still hesitated, and looked doubtfully at the bottle in her
  hand.</p>

  <p>Then Cethegus went close to her and lightly touched her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You hesitate?" he said slowly. "Do you know what is at stake? Not only
  our whole plan! No, blind mother. Still more. Camilla <i>loves</i>, loves the
  King; with all the power of her young soul. Shall the daughter of Boëthius
  become the paramour of the tyrant?"</p>

  <p>With a loud cry Rusticiana started back. That which, during the last few
  days, had crossed her mind with a terrible suspicion, now became a certainty;
  she cast one glance at the man who had spoken the cruel word, and hurried
  away, angrily grasping the phial.</p>

  <p>Cethegus looked quietly after her.</p>

  <p>"Now, young Prince, we shall see! You were quick, I am quicker. It is
  strange," he added, "I have long thought that I was incapable of such violent
  emotion. Life has again a charm. I can again strive, hope, and fear. Even
  hate. Yes, I hate this boy, who dares to meddle in my affairs with his
  childish hand. He would defy me&mdash;hinder my progress&mdash;he boldly
  crosses my path&mdash;he! Well, let him bear the consequences!" And he slowly
  left the chamber, and turned towards the audience-room of the Queen, where he
  intentionally showed himself to the assembled crowd, and, by his calmness,
  gave some degree of confidence to the troubled hearts of the Roman
  courtiers.</p>

  <p>At sunset he went with Cassiodorus and a few other Romans&mdash;consulting
  about his defence for the next day&mdash;into the gardens, where he looked
  about in vain for Camilla.</p>

  <p>She, as soon as she had heard the end of Cassiodorus' report, had hurried
  to the court of the palace, where she hoped to find the King at the exercise
  of arms with the other young Goths. She only wished to see him, not yet to
  speak to him and beg pardon at his feet for the great wrong she had done
  him.</p>

  <p>She had abhorred him, repulsed him, hated him as spotted with the blood of
  her father&mdash;him, who had suffered for her father's sake, who had saved
  her brothers' lives!</p>

  <p>But she did not find the King in the court. The important events of the
  day kept him confined to his study. His comrades also did not fence to-day.
  Standing in thick groups, they loudly praised the courage of their young
  King. Camilla heard this praise with delight. Blushing with pride, she
  wandered in happy dreams about the garden, seeking the traces of her lover in
  all her favourite haunts.</p>

  <p>Yes, she loved him! Joyfully and proudly she confessed it to herself; he
  had a thousand times deserved it. What matter that he was a Goth, a
  barbarian! He was a noble, generous youth, the King of her soul!</p>

  <p>She repeatedly told the slave who accompanied her to keep at a distance,
  so that she might not hear how she again and again murmured the beloved
  name.</p>

  <p>At last she arrived at the Temple of Venus, and sank into sweet dreams of
  the future, which lay indistinct, but golden-hued, before her. She first of
  all resolved to declare to her mother and the Prefect that they must no more
  reckon upon her assistance in any plot against the King. Then she would ask
  pardon for her fault with moving words, and then&mdash;then?</p>

  <p>She did not know what would happen then; but she blushed in the midst of
  her sweet reverie.</p>

  <p>Red and perfumed almond-blossoms fell from the bending trees; in the thick
  oleander near her sang a nightingale; the clear stream glided purling past
  her to the blue sea, and the waves of this sea rolled softly to her feet, as
  if doing homage to her love.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b1-17"
     name="b1-17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">The sound of approaching footsteps upon the sandy path
  startled her from her reverie. The step was so rapid and firm, that she did
  not expect Athalaric. But he it was, changed in appearance and carriage; more
  manly, stronger, more decided.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, welcome, Camilla!" he cried, in a loud and lively voice. "To see
  you here is the best reward for this troublous day."</p>

  <p>He had never spoken to her so before.</p>

  <p>"My King!" she whispered, blushing. She cast a beaming look upon him from
  her dark eyes, then the long and silky lashes fell.</p>

  <p>"My King!" She had never before called him so, never given him such a
  look.</p>

  <p>"Your King!" he said, seating himself beside her. "I fear you will call me
  so no longer, when you learn what has happened to-day."</p>

  <p>"I know all."</p>

  <p>"You know! Well then, Camilla, be just. Do not scold, I am no
  tyrant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The noble youth!" she thought. "He excuses himself for his most manly
  act."</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows that I do not hate the Romans. Are they not your people? I
  honour them and their ancient greatness; I respect their rights; but I must
  firmly protect my kingdom, Theodoric's creation, and woe to the hand that
  threatens it! Perhaps," he continued, more slowly and solemnly, "perhaps its
  doom is already written in the stars. 'Tis all the same. I, its King, must
  with it stand or fall."</p>

  <p>"You say truly, Athalaric, and speak like a King!"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Camilla; how just and good you are today! To such goodness I may
  well confide what blessing, what healing has come to me. I was a sick and
  erring dreamer, without support, without joy, gladly sinking to the grave.
  Then there suddenly came over me a feeling of the danger which threatened
  this nation, an active anxiety for the welfare of my people, and out of this
  anxiety grew a warm and mighty love for my Goths; and this ardent and
  watchful love has strengthened and comforted my heart for .... a bitterly
  painful renunciation. What matters <i>my</i> happiness, if only my people
  flourish! See, this thought has made me whole and strong, and truly, I could
  now venture upon the most daring deed!"</p>

  <p>He sprang up and extended both his arms, exclaiming: "Oh, Camilla! this
  inaction destroys me! Oh that I were mounted and meeting a full-armed foe!
  Look," he added, more calmly, "the sun is setting. The mirror-like flood
  invites us. Come, Camilla, come with me in the boat."</p>

  <p>Camilla hesitated. She looked around.</p>

  <p>"The slave?" asked Athalaric. "Ah, let her alone. There she reposes under
  the palm by the spring. She sleeps. Come, come quickly, ere the sun sets.
  Look at the golden ripple on the water&mdash;it beckons us!"</p>

  <p>"To the Isles of the Blessed?" asked the lovely girl, with a shy look and
  a slight blush.</p>

  <p>"Yes, come to the Blessed Isles!" he answered, delighted, lifted her
  quickly into the boat, loosed the silver chain from the ram's head upon the
  quay, sprang in, took the ornamental oar, and pushed off.</p>

  <p>Then he laid the oar into the notch at his left hand, and, standing in the
  stern of the boat, steered and rowed at the same time&mdash;a graceful and
  picturesque movement, and a right Germanic ferryman's custom.</p>

  <p>Camilla sat upon a <i>diphros</i>, or Grecian folding-stool, in the bow of
  the boat, and looked into Athalaric's noble face. His dark hair was ruffled
  by the breeze, and it was pleasant to watch the lithe and graceful motions of
  his agile form.</p>

  <p>Both were silent. Like an arrow the light bark shot through the smooth
  water. Flecked and rosy cloudlets passed slowly across the sky, the faint
  breeze was laden with clouds of perfume from the blossoming almond-trees upon
  the shore, and all around was peace and harmony.</p>

  <p>At last the King broke the silence, while giving the boat a strong
  impulse, so that it obediently shot forwards.</p>

  <p>"Do you know of what I am thinking? How splendid it would be to steer a
  nation&mdash;thousands of well-loved lives&mdash;securely forward through
  waves and wind, to happiness and glory! But what were you thinking about,
  Camilla? You looked so kind, you must have had pleasant thoughts."</p>

  <p>She blushed and looked aside into the water.</p>

  <p>"Oh, speak! Be frank in this happy hour."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking," she said, her pretty head still averted, "how delightful
  it must be to be steered through the heaving flood of life by a faithful and
  beloved hand, to whose guidance one could implicitly trust."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Camilla, even a barbarian may be trusted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are no barbarian! Whoever feels so tenderly, thinks so nobly, so
  generously controls himself, and rewards great ingratitude with kindness, is
  no barbarian! He is as noble a man as ever Scipio was."</p>

  <p>The King ceased to row in his delight; the boat remained motionless.</p>

  <p>"Camilla, am I dreaming? Did <i>you</i> say that? and to me V 9</p>

  <p>"More still, Athalaric! I beseech you to forgive that I have repulsed you
  so cruelly. Ah! it was from shame and fear."</p>

  <p>"Camilla, pearl of my soul&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Camilla, who had her face turned towards the shore, suddenly cried
  out:</p>

  <p>"What is that? They follow us. The court! the women! my mother!"</p>

  <p>It was so. Rusticiana, aroused by the Prefect's terrible warning, had
  sought for her daughter in the garden. She could not find her. She hurried to
  the Temple of Venus. In vain. Looking around, she suddenly caught sight of
  the two&mdash;her child, alone with Athalaric&mdash;in the boat, far out upon
  the sea.</p>

  <p>Greatly angered, she rushed to the marble table, where the slaves were
  just preparing the King's evening draught, sent them down the steps to
  unloose the gondola, won in this way an unobserved moment near the table, and
  directly afterwards descended the steps with Daphnidion&mdash;whom her angry
  cry had awakened&mdash;to the boat.</p>

  <p>At this moment the Prefect and his friends, whose walk had also led them
  to this place, approached from a thick taxus-path. Cethegus followed
  Rusticiana down the steps and gave her his hand to help her into the
  gondola.</p>

  <p>"It is done!" she whispered to him, and the boat pushed off.</p>

  <p>It was just then that the young pair became aware of the movement upon the
  beach. Camilla stood up; perhaps she suspected that the King would turn the
  boat, but he cried:</p>

  <p>"No; they shall not rob me of this hour, the happiest of my life! I must
  sip still more of these sweet words. Oh, Camilla, you must tell me more; you
  must tell me all! Come, we will land upon that island, they may reach us
  there."</p>

  <p>And rowing rapidly, he pressed with all his might upon the oar, so that
  the boat flew forward as if winged.</p>

  <p>"Will you not speak again?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! my friend, my King&mdash;do not press me."</p>

  <p>He only looked into her lovely face, into her beaming eyes; he paid no
  more attention to his goal.</p>

  <p>"Well, wait&mdash;there upon the island; there you
  shall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A renewed and passionate effort, when all at once a dull crash was heard;
  the boat had struck, and drove, shaking violently, backwards.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Heaven!" cried Camilla, springing up and looking towards the bow of
  the boat. A whole volume of water came foaming towards her. "The boat has
  burst! we sink!" she cried, turning pale.</p>

  <p>"Come here to me; let me see!" cried Athalaric, starting up. "Ah! it is
  the 'Needles of the Amphitrites!' We are lost!"</p>

  <p>The "Needles of the Amphitrites"&mdash;we know that they could scarcely be
  seen from the terrace of the temple&mdash;were two narrow, sharp-pointed
  rocks, lying between the shore and the nearest lagoon island. They scarcely
  rose above the level of the water; with the slightest wind, the waves washed
  quite over them.</p>

  <p>Athalaric knew the danger of the place, and had always easily avoided it;
  but this time he had only looked into Camilla's eyes.</p>

  <p>At one glance he saw their fearful position.</p>

  <p>They could not be saved.</p>

  <p>A plank in the bottom of the slightly-made boat had sprung; the water
  rushed rapidly through the leak. The boat sank deeper and deeper every
  moment.</p>

  <p>He could not hope, with Camilla, to gain the nearest island or the shore
  by swimming. On the narrow point of the rock scarcely the feet of a sea-eagle
  could have found a moment's resting-place, and Rusticiana's gondola had only
  just pushed off from the land.</p>

  <p>All this he had seen with lightning-like rapidity, and he cast a horrified
  look at Camilla.</p>

  <p>"Beloved, thou must die!" he cried despairingly. "And through me!" He
  embraced her passionately.</p>

  <p>"Die?" she cried. "Oh no! not so young&mdash;not now! Let me
  live&mdash;live with thee!" And she clung closely to his arm.</p>

  <p>The tone, the words, cut him to the heart. He tore himself loose; he
  looked about for rescue. In vain; in vain. The water rose higher and higher;
  the boat sank more and more rapidly. He threw the oar away.</p>

  <p>"It is over&mdash;all is over, beloved! Let us take leave!"</p>

  <p>"No; we part no more! If we must die&mdash;oh! then, away with all the
  restraints which bind the living!" And, glowing all over, she nestled to his
  breast. "Oh! let me tell thee, let me confess to thee how much I love thee;
  how long ago&mdash;since&mdash;since first I knew thee! All my hate was only
  bashful love. Oh, God! I loved thee already when I thought I ought to abhor
  thee! Yes, thou shalt know how I love thee!" And she covered his eyes and
  mouth with hasty kisses. "Oh! now I will gladly die. Rather die with thee
  than live without thee! But no"&mdash;and she suddenly pushed him
  away&mdash;"thou shalt not die! Leave me here; go! swim&mdash;you can easily
  reach the island alone. Try; and leave me."</p>

  <p>"No," he cried, in an ecstasy of joy; "rather die with thee than live
  without thee! After such painful doubt, at length joyous certainty! From this
  hour we belong to each other for ever. Come, Camilla, beloved, let us die
  together!"</p>

  <p>A shudder of horror and delight, of love and death, shook their frames. He
  drew her to him, embraced her with his left arm, and lifted her upon the
  steer-board of the boat, which scarcely rose a hand's-breadth above the
  water. Already he prepared for the fatal leap&mdash;when suddenly they both
  uttered a joyful cry.</p>

  <p>Round a precipitous promontory which stretched far out into the sea, at a
  short distance, they saw a ship coming at full speed.</p>

  <p>The crew had heard their cry, and, at all events, saw their danger;
  perhaps had even recognised the person of the King. Forty oars, plunged into
  the water at the same moment by the rowers on the double deck, gave impetus
  to the course of the swift vessel, which rustled before the wind with
  swelling sails.</p>

  <p>Those who crowded the deck shouted to them to stand firm; and
  presently&mdash;it was high time&mdash;the prow of the bireme lay close over
  the little boat, which sank immediately after the endangered pair had been
  taken on board the ship through the opening of the lower deck.</p>

  <p>It was a small Gothic guardship. The golden rampant lion, the arms of the
  Amelungs, shone upon the blue flag. Aligern, a cousin of Teja, commanded
  it.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, brave friends!" said Athalaric, as soon as he could find words.
  "Thanks! you have not only saved your King, but also your Queen!"</p>

  <p>Much astonished, soldiers and sailors surrounded the happy man, who held
  the weeping Camilla in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Hail to our young and beautiful Queen!" cried the red-haired Aligern; and
  the crew shouted enthusiastically, "Hail! hail to our Queen!"</p>

  <p>At this moment the sailing-vessel rustled past Rusticiana's gondola. The
  sound of this joyous shout aroused the unhappy woman from the stupor of
  horror into which she had fallen when her two startled oarsmen had discovered
  the danger of the young couple in the sinking boat, and had at once declared
  that it was impossible to save them.</p>

  <p>On hearing this, she had sunk senseless into Daphnidion's arms. Now she
  came to herself, and cast a confused glance around her. She was amazed. Was
  it a dream that she saw, or was it really her daughter who stood on the deck
  of the Gothic ship, which proudly rustled past, lying on the young King's
  breast? And did really joyous voices cry, "Hail, Camilla, our Queen?" She
  stared at the passing vision, speechless and confounded.</p>

  <p>But the swiftly-flying ship had already passed her boat and drew near the
  land. It anchored outside the shallow garden-bay; a boat was lowered, the
  rescued couple, Aligern, and three sailors sprang into it, and soon they
  climbed the steps of the quay, where, besides Cethegus and his companions, a
  crowd of people had collected, who, from the palace or the gardens, had with
  horror become aware of the danger of the little boat, and now hurried to
  greet the rescued King.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by felicitations and blessings, Athalaric mounted the
  steps.</p>

  <p>"Behold!" he said, on arriving at the temple, "behold, Goths and Romans!
  behold your Queen, my bride! The God of Death has united us. Is it not so,
  Camilla?"</p>

  <p>She looked up at him, but was terribly startled. The excitement and the
  sudden change from horror to joy had fearfully shaken the scarcely-recovered
  King. His countenance was pale as marble; he tottered and convulsively
  pressed his hand to his breast, as though suffocating.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake!" cried Camilla, fearing an attack of his old malady. "The
  King is unwell! Quick with the wine, the medicine!"</p>

  <p>She flew to the table, caught up the silver cup which stood ready, and
  pressed it into the King's hand.</p>

  <p>Cethegus stood close by, and followed Athalaric's every movement with
  eagerness. The latter had already lifted the cup to his lips, but suddenly
  removed it, and said, smiling, to Camilla:</p>

  <p>"Thou must drink to me, as becomes a Gothic Queen at her court."</p>

  <p>And he gave her the goblet. She took it out of his hand.</p>

  <p>For a moment the Prefect felt as if on fire.</p>

  <p>He was upon the point of darting forward to dash the cup from her hand.
  But he controlled himself. If he did so, he was irrevocably lost. Not only
  tomorrow, as guilty of high treason, but at once arrested and accused of
  poisoning. And with him would be lost the future of Rome and all his ideal
  world. And for whom? For a love-sick girl, who had faithlessly revolted to
  his deadly enemy.</p>

  <p>"No," he said coldly to himself, clenching his fist; "she or
  Rome&mdash;therefore she!"</p>

  <p>And he quietly looked on while the girl, sweetly blushing, sipped somewhat
  of the wine, which the King then drank to the last dregs.</p>

  <p>Athalaric shuddered as he replaced the cup upon the marble table.</p>

  <p>"Come up to the palace," he said, shivering, and threw his mantle across
  his shoulders; "I feel cold."</p>

  <p>And he turned away. In doing so he caught sight of Cethegus, stood still
  for a moment, and looked penetratingly into the Prefect's eyes.</p>

  <p>"You here?" he said gloomily, and advanced a step towards him. All at once
  he shuddered again, and, with a sudden cry, fell prone near the spring.</p>

  <p>"Athalaric!" cried Camilla, and threw herself upon him. The old servant
  Corbulo sprang to her from the group of domestics.</p>

  <p>"Help!" he cried; "she is dying&mdash;the King!"</p>

  <p>"Water, quick! water!" called Cethegus, and he resolutely went to the
  table, took the silver cup, stooped, rinsed it quickly but thoroughly in the
  spring, and then bent over the King, who lay in Cassiodorus' arms, while
  Corbulo laid Camilla's head upon his knee.</p>

  <p>Helpless and horrified, the courtiers surrounded the two apparently
  lifeless forms.</p>

  <p>"What has happened? My child!" With this cry Rusticiana, who had just
  landed, rushed to her daughter's side. "Camilla!" she screamed desperately,
  "what ails you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Cethegus quietly, examining the two bodies. "It is only a
  fainting-fit. But his heart-disease has carried off the young King! He is
  dead!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="b2"
     name="b2"></a>BOOK II. &mdash; AMALASWINTHA.</h2>

  <p class="cp">"Amalaswintha did not despair like a woman, but vigorously
  defended her royalty."&mdash;<br>
  <i>Procopius: Wars of the Goths</i>, i. 2.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="b2-1"
     name="b2-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">Athalaric's sudden death fell like lightning from a clear
  sky upon the Gothic party, whose hopes, just at this very time, had been
  raised to such a high pitch. All the measures which the King had taken at
  their suggestion were paralysed, and the national party was left without a
  representative in the State; at the head of which the Queen-regent was now
  placed alone.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning of the next day Cassiodorus went to the Prefect of
  Rome. He found him in a sound and tranquil sleep.</p>

  <p>"And you can sleep as quietly as a child after such a blow?"</p>

  <p>"I sleep," answered Cethegus, raising himself on his elbow, "in the
  feeling of renewed security."</p>

  <p>"Security! yes, for you; but the kingdom!"</p>

  <p>"The kingdom was in more danger through this boy than I. Where is the
  Queen?"</p>

  <p>"She sits speechless beside the open coffin of her son! She has sat there
  the whole night."</p>

  <p>Cethegus sprang up.</p>

  <p>"That must not be! It does no good. She belongs to the State, not to this
  corpse. So much the less because I have heard whispers concerning poison. The
  young tyrant had many enemies. How about that matter?"</p>

  <p>"Very uncertain. The Grecian physician, Elpidios, who examined the corpse,
  certainly speaks of some striking appearances. But he thinks that if poison
  has been used it must be a very secret one, quite unknown to him. In the cup
  from which the unfortunate boy drank there could not be discovered the least
  trace of suspicious contents. So it is generally believed that excitement had
  again brought on his former malady, and that this was the cause of his death.
  But still it is well that, since the moment of your leaving the assembly,
  <i>you</i> were always in the presence of witnesses; grief breeds
  suspicion."</p>

  <p>"How is it with Camilla?" the Prefect inquired further.</p>

  <p>"She has never yet awakened from her stupor; the physicians fear the
  worst. But I came to ask you what shall now be done? The Queen speaks of
  suppressing the examination concerning you."</p>

  <p>"That must not be," cried Cethegus. "I demand an investigation. We will go
  to her immediately."</p>

  <p>"Will you intrude upon her at the coffin of her son?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will. Do you shrink from it in your tender consideration? Well
  then, come afterwards, when I have broken the ice."</p>

  <p>He dismissed his visitor and called his slaves to dress him. Shortly
  afterwards, enveloped in a dark mourning garment, he descended to the vault
  where the corpse lay exposed. With an imperious gesture he motioned aside the
  guard and the women of Amalaswintha, who kept watch at the door, and entered
  noiselessly.</p>

  <p>It was the low vaulted hall, where, in former times, the corpses of the
  emperors had been prepared with salves and combustibles for the funeral
  pyre.</p>

  <p>This quiet hall, flagged with dark-green serpentine, the roof of which was
  supported by short Doric columns of black marble, was never illumined by a
  ray of sunshine, and at the present moment no other light fell upon the
  gloomy Byzantine mosaics on the gold ground of the walls than that from four
  torches, which flickered with an uncertain light near the stone sarcophagus
  of the young King.</p>

  <p>There he lay upon a dark purple mantle; helm, sword, and shield at his
  head.</p>

  <p>Old Hildebrand had wound a wreath of oak-leaves amidst the dark locks. The
  noble features reposed in pallid and earnest beauty.</p>

  <p>At his feet, clad in a long mourning veil, sat the tall form of the Queen,
  supporting her head upon her left arm, which was laid upon the sarcophagus.
  Her right hand hung languidly down. She could weep no more.</p>

  <p>The crackling of the burning torches was the only sound in this stillness
  of the grave.</p>

  <p>Cethegus entered noiselessly, not unmoved by the poetry of the scene.</p>

  <p>But, contracting his brows, he smothered the passing feeling of
  compassion. He knew that it was necessary to be clear and composed.</p>

  <p>He gently drew near and took Amalaswintha's relaxed hand.</p>

  <p>"Rise, noble lady, you belong to the living, not to the dead."</p>

  <p>She looked up, startled.</p>

  <p>"You here, Cethegus? What seek you here?"</p>

  <p>"A Queen!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you only find a weeping mother!" she cried, sobbing.</p>

  <p>"That I cannot believe. The kingdom is in danger, and Amalaswintha will
  show that even a woman can sacrifice her sorrow to the fatherland."</p>

  <p>"She can!" replied the Queen, rising. "But look at him. How young! how
  beautiful! How could Heaven be so cruel!"</p>

  <p>"Now, or never!" thought Cethegus, and said aloud: "Heaven is just,
  severe; not cruel."</p>

  <p>"Of what do you speak? What wrong has my noble son committed? Do you dare
  to accuse him?"</p>

  <p>"Not I! But a portion of Holy Writ has been fulfilled upon him: 'Honour
  thy father and mother, that thy days may be long in the land!' The
  commandment is also a threat. Yesterday he sinned against his mother and
  dishonoured her by bold rebellion&mdash;to-day he lies here. Therein I see
  the finger of God."</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha covered her face. She had heartily forgiven her son while
  watching beside his coffin. But still this view, these words, powerfully
  affected her, and drew her attention away from her grief to the well-loved
  habit of government.</p>

  <p>"You wish, O Queen, to suppress my examination, and recall Witichis.
  Witichis may be recalled. But I demand, as my right, that the prosecution be
  continued, and I fully expect a solemn acquittal."</p>

  <p>"I have never doubted your fidelity. Woe to me, should I be obliged to do
  so! Tell me that you know of no conspiracy, and all is ended."</p>

  <p>She seemed to expect his asseveration,</p>

  <p>Cethegus was silent for a short time. Then he quietly said:</p>

  <p>"Queen, I know of a conspiracy."</p>

  <p>"What say you?" cried the Queen, looking at him threateningly.</p>

  <p>"I have chosen this hour and place," continued Cethegus, with a glance at
  the corpse, "to put a seal to my devotion, so that it may be indelibly
  impressed upon your heart. Hear and judge me."</p>

  <p>"What shall I hear?" said the Queen, now upon her guard, and firmly
  resolved to allow herself to be neither deceived nor softened.</p>

  <p>"I should be a bad Roman, Queen, and you would despise me, if I did not
  love my nation above all things. That proud nation, which even you, a
  stranger, love! I know&mdash;as you know&mdash;that hatred against you as
  heretics and barbarians still smoulders in the hearts of most Italians. The
  last harsh deeds of your father have fanned this feeling into a flame. I
  suspected a conspiracy. I sought and discovered it."</p>

  <p>"And concealed it?" said the Queen, rising in anger.</p>

  <p>"And concealed it. Until to-day. The blind fools would have sought
  assistance from the Greeks, and, after destroying the Goths, subjected
  themselves to the Emperor."</p>

  <p>"The vile traitors!" cried Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>"The fools! They had already gone so far, that only <i>one</i> means was
  left by which to keep them back: I placed myself at their head."</p>

  <p>"Cethegus!"</p>

  <p>"In this manner I gained time, and was able to prevent noble, though blind
  men, from rushing to destruction. I opened their eyes by degrees, and showed
  them that their plan, if it succeeded, would have only exchanged a mild
  government for a despotic one. They acknowledged it; they obeyed me; and no
  Byzantine will ever touch Italian soil, until I call him, I&mdash;or
  you."</p>

  <p>"I! Do you rave?"</p>

  <p>"Sophocles, your favourite, says, 'Forswear nothing.' Be warned, Queen,
  for you do not see the pressing danger. Another conspiracy, much more
  dangerous than that of these Roman enthusiasts, and close to you, threatens
  you, your kingdom, and the Amelungs' right of sovereignty&mdash;a conspiracy
  of the Goths!"</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha turned pale.</p>

  <p>"You have seen yesterday, to your sorrow, that your hand can no more guide
  the rudder of this realm. Just as little as could that of your noble son, who
  was but the tool of your enemies. You know, Queen, that many of your nation
  are bloodthirsty, barbarous, rapacious, and brutal; they would like to levy
  contributions upon this land, where Virgil and Tullius wandered. Yon know
  that your insolent nobles hate the superiority of your royal house, and would
  make themselves its equal. You know that the rude Goths think unworthily of
  woman's vocation for government."</p>

  <p>"I know it," she said, proudly and angrily.</p>

  <p>"But you do not know that both these parties are united. They are united
  against you and your Roman predilections. They will overthrow you, or force
  you to do their will. Cassiodorus and I are to be dismissed from your side,
  our Senate and our rights to be dissolved, and the kingship to become a
  shadow. War is to be proclaimed against the Emperor; and force, extortion,
  and rapine, let loose upon us Romans."</p>

  <p>"You paint mere idle phantoms!"</p>

  <p>"Was that which happened yesterday an idle phantom? If Heaven had not
  intervened, would not you&mdash;like me&mdash;be robbed of all your power?
  Would you still be mistress in your kingdom, in your house? Are they not
  already so strong, that the heathen Hildebrand, the countrified Witichis, the
  gloomy Teja, openly defy your will in the name of your befooled son? Have
  they not recalled the three rebel dukes? And your perverse daughter,
  and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"True, too true," sighed the Queen.</p>

  <p>"If these men should rule&mdash;then farewell science, art, and all noble
  culture! Farewell, Italia, mother of humanity! Then, burst into flame, you
  white parchments! crumble into fragments, you beautiful statues! Brutality
  and murder will run rife in these plains, and posterity will bear witness:
  'Such things happened in the reign of Amalaswintha, the daughter of
  Theodoric.'"</p>

  <p>"Never, never shall that happen! But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You want proofs? I fear you will have them only too soon. However, you
  see, even now, that you cannot rely upon the Goths, if you wish to prevent
  such horrors. We alone can protect you against them; we, to whom you already
  belong by intellect and culture; we Romans. Then, when the barbarians
  surround your throne with uproar, let me rally the men around you who once
  conspired against you: the patriots of Rome! They will protect you and
  themselves at the same time."</p>

  <p>"Cethegus," said the distressed woman, "you influence men easily! Who,
  tell me, who will answer for the patriots? Who will answer for <i>your</i>
  truth?"</p>

  <p>"This paper, Queen, and this! The first contains a correct list of the
  Roman conspirators. You see, there are many hundred names. This is a list of
  the members of the Gothic league, whom I certainly could only guess at. But I
  guess well. With these two papers I give both these parties&mdash;I give
  myself&mdash;completely into your hands. You can at any moment reveal me to
  my own party as a traitor, who, before all things, sought <i>your</i> favour.
  You can expose me to the hatred of the Goths&mdash;as soon as you will. I
  shall be left without adherents. I stand alone; your favour is my only
  support."</p>

  <p>The Queen had glanced over the papers with sparkling eyes. "Cethegus," she
  exclaimed, "I will always remember your fidelity and this hour!"</p>

  <p>And she gave him her hand with emotion.</p>

  <p>Cethegus slightly bent his head. "Still one thing more, O Queen. The
  patriots, henceforward your friends as they are mine, know that the hate of
  the barbarians, the sword of destruction, hangs over their heads. Their
  anxious hearts require encouragement. Let me assure them of your high
  protection. Place your name at the head of this list, and let me thereby give
  them a visible sign of your favour."</p>

  <p>She took the golden stylus and the waxen tablets which he handed to her.
  For one moment she hesitated; then she quickly signed her name, and gave
  tablets and stylus back again. "Here! They must be faithful to me; as
  faithful as yourself!"</p>

  <p>At this moment Cassiodorus entered. "O Queen, the Gothic nobles await you.
  They wish to speak with you."</p>

  <p>"I come! They shall learn my will!" she said vehemently; "but you,
  Cassiodorus, shall be the first to know the decision to which I have come
  during this trying hour, and which will soon be known to my whole kingdom.
  Henceforward the Prefect of Rome is the first of my servants, as he is the
  most faithful. He has the place of honour in my trust and near my
  throne."</p>

  <p>Much astonished, Cassiodorus led the Queen up the dark steps.</p>

  <p>Cethegus followed slowly. He held up the tablets in his hand, and said to
  himself: "Now you are mine, daughter of Theodoric! Your name upon this list
  severs you for ever from your people!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-2"
     name="b2-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">As Cethegus emerged from the subterranean chamber into the
  ground-floor of the palace, and prepared to follow the Queen, his ear was
  caught and his progress arrested by the solemn and sorrowful tones of flutes.
  He guessed what it meant.</p>

  <p>His first impulse was to turn aside. But he presently decided to
  remain.</p>

  <p>It would happen some time, therefore it was best at once. He must find out
  how far she was informed.</p>

  <p>The tones of the flutes came nearer, alternating with a monotonous dirge.
  Cethegus stepped into a wide niche of the dark corridor, into which the head
  of a little procession already turned.</p>

  <p>Foremost came, two by two, six noble Roman maidens, covered with grey
  mourning veils, carrying reversed torches. Then followed a priest, before
  whom was borne the tall banner of the Cross, with long streamers. Next came a
  troop of the freedmen of the family of Boëthius, led by Corbulo and the
  flute-players. Then followed, borne by four Roman girls, an open coffin,
  covered with flowers. Upon it lay, on a white linen cloth, the dead Camilla,
  in bridal ornaments, a wreath in her dark hair, an expression of smiling
  peace upon her slightly-opened lips.</p>

  <p>Behind the coffin, with loosened hair, staring fixedly before her, came
  the unhappy mother, surrounded by matrons, who supported her sinking
  form.</p>

  <p>A company of female slaves closed the procession, which slowly disappeared
  into the vault.</p>

  <p>Cethegus recognised the sobbing Daphnidion, and stopped her.</p>

  <p>"When did she die?" he asked calmly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir, a few hours ago! Oh, the good, kind, beautiful Domna!"</p>

  <p>"Did she ever awaken to full consciousness?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, never. Only quite at the last she once more opened her large
  eyes, and appeared to seek for something. 'Where has he gone?' she asked her
  mother. 'Ah, I see him!' she then cried, and rose from her cushions. 'Child,
  my child, where will you go?' cried my mistress, weeping. 'Oh, there!' she
  replied with a rapturous smile; 'to the Isles of the Blessed!' and she closed
  her eyes and fell back upon her couch; that lovely smile remained upon her
  lips&mdash;and she was gone, gone for ever!"</p>

  <p>"Who has caused her to be brought down here?"</p>

  <p>"The Queen. She learned everything, and gave orders that the deceased, as
  the bride of her son, should be laid beside him and buried in the same
  tomb."</p>

  <p>"But what says the physician? How could she die so suddenly?"</p>

  <p>"Alas! the physician saw her only for a moment; he was too much occupied
  with the royal corpse; and then my mistress would not suffer the strange man
  to touch her daughter. It is just her heart that has been broken; one can
  easily die of that! But peace&mdash;they come!"</p>

  <p>The procession returned in the same order as before, but without the
  coffin. Daphnidion joined it. Only Rusticiana was missing.</p>

  <p>Cethegus quietly walked up and down the corridor, to wait for her.</p>

  <p>At last her bowed-down form came slowly up the steps. She staggered and
  seemed about to fall.</p>

  <p>Cethegus quickly caught her arm. "Rusticiana, take courage!"</p>

  <p>"You here? God! you also loved her! And we&mdash;we two have murdered
  her!" and she sank upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Silence, unhappy woman!" he whispered, looking around.</p>

  <p>"Alas! I, her own mother, have killed her! I mixed the fatal draught that
  caused his death."</p>

  <p>"All is well," thought Cethegus. "She has no suspicion that Camilla drank,
  and still less that I saw her do so.&mdash;It is a terrible stroke of Fate!"
  he said aloud. "But reflect, what would have followed had she lived? She
  loved him!"</p>

  <p>"What would have followed?" cried Rusticiana, receding. "Oh, if she but
  lived! Who can prevent love? Oh that she had become his&mdash;his
  wife&mdash;his mistress, provided only that she lived!"</p>

  <p>"But you forget that he <i>must</i> have died?"</p>

  <p>"Must? Why must he have died? So that you might carry out your ambitious
  plans? Oh, selfishness without example!"</p>

  <p>"They are your plans that I carry out, not mine; how often must I repeat
  it? <i>You</i> have conjured up the God of Revenge, not I. Why do you accuse
  me if he demand a sacrifice? Think better of it. Farewell."</p>

  <p>But Rusticiana violently seized his arm. "And that is all? And you have
  nothing more&mdash;not a word, not a tear for my child? And you would make me
  believe that you have acted thus to avenge her, to avenge me? You have never
  had a heart! You did not even love her&mdash;coldly you see her die! Ha,
  curses, curses upon thee!"</p>

  <p>"Be silent, frantic woman!"</p>

  <p>"Silent! no, I will speak and curse you! Oh that I knew of something that
  was as dear to you as Camilla was to me! Oh that you, like me, could see your
  whole life's last and only joy torn away&mdash;that you could see it vanish,
  and despair! If there be a God in heaven you will live to do so!"</p>

  <p>Cethegus smiled.</p>

  <p>"You do not believe in heavenly vengeance? Well, then, believe in the
  vengeance of a miserable mother! You shall tremble! I will hasten to the
  Queen and tell her all! You shall die!"</p>

  <p>"And you will die with me."</p>

  <p>"With a smile&mdash;if only I can see you perish!" and she would have
  hurried away, but Cethegus held her back with an iron grasp.</p>

  <p>"Stop, woman! Do you think that I am not on my guard with such as you?
  Your sons, Anicius and Severinus, are here in Italy, secretly&mdash;in
  Rome&mdash;in my house. You know that death is the penalty of their return. A
  word&mdash;and they die with us. Then you may take to your husband your sons,
  as well as your daughter, who has died by your means. Her blood upon your
  head!" and quickly turning the angle of the corridor, he disappeared.</p>

  <p>"My sons!" cried Rusticiana, and sank down upon the marble pavement.</p>

  <p>A few days after, the widow of Boëthius, with Corbulo and Daphnidion, left
  the court for ever. In vain the Queen sought to detain her.</p>

  <p>The faithful freedman took her back to the sheltered Villa of Tifernum,
  which she now deeply regretted ever having left. There, in the place of the
  little Temple of Venus, she erected a basilica, in the crypt of which an urn
  was placed, containing the hearts of the two lovers.</p>

  <p>In her passionate soul her prayers for the salvation of her child were
  inseparably bound up with a petition for revenge upon Cethegus, whose real
  share in Camilla's death she did not even suspect; she only felt that he had
  used mother and daughter as tools for his plans, and had sacrificed the
  girl's happiness and life with heartless coldness.</p>

  <p>And scarcely less continuously than the flame of the eternal lamp before
  the urn, the prayer and the curse of the lonely mother rose up to heaven.</p>

  <p>The hour came which disclosed to her all the Prefect's guilt, and the
  vengeance which she called down from heaven did not tarry.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-3"
     name="b2-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">At the court of Ravenna there ensued a bitter and obstinate
  strife.</p>

  <p>The Gothic patriots, although deeply grieved at the sudden death of their
  youthful King, and, for the moment, overpowered, were very soon re-encouraged
  by their indefatigable leaders.</p>

  <p>The high consideration in which Hildebrand was held, the quiet strength of
  Witichis, who had returned, and Teja's watchful zeal, operated
  continuously.</p>

  <p>We have seen that these men had succeeded in inducing Athalaric to shake
  off the authority of his mother. It was now easy for them to find ever new
  adherents amongst the Goths against a government in which the hated Cethegus
  would come more than ever to the front.</p>

  <p>The feeling in the army and the Germanic population of Ravenna was
  sufficiently prepared for a decisive stroke. The old master-at-arms with
  difficulty restrained the discontented, until, strengthened by important
  confederates, they could be more certain of success.</p>

  <p>These confederates were the three dukes, Thulun, Ibba, and Pitza, whom
  Amalaswintha had driven away from court, and whom her son had so lately
  recalled.</p>

  <p>Thulun and Ibba were brothers; Pitza was their cousin.</p>

  <p>Another brother of the former, Duke Alaric, had been condemned to death
  some years ago on account of a pretended conspiracy, and since his flight
  (for he had succeeded in escaping) nothing had been heard of him. They were
  the offspring of the celebrated race of the Balthe, who had worn the crown of
  the Visigoths, and were scarcely inferior in ancient descent and rank to the
  Amelungs. Their pedigree, like that of the Royal House, descended from the
  gods. The wealth of their possessions in land and dependent colonies, and the
  fame of their warlike deeds, enhanced the power and glory of their house.</p>

  <p>It was said amongst the people that Theodoric had, for a while, thought of
  passing over his daughter and her son, and, in the interest of the kingdom,
  of appointing the powerful Duke Thulun as his successor. And, after the death
  of Athalaric, the patriots were decided, in case of the worst&mdash;that is,
  if the Queen could not be persuaded to renounce her system&mdash;once more to
  entertain this idea.</p>

  <p>Cethegus saw the threatening tempest. He saw how Gothic national feeling,
  awakened by Hildebrand and his friends, grew more opposed to the Romanising
  Regency. He indignantly confessed to himself that he had no real power with
  which to keep down discontent. Ravenna was not his Rome, where he controlled
  all proceedings, where he had again accustomed the citizens to the use of
  arms, and attached them to his person; here all the troops were Goths, and he
  could only fear that they would reply to an order for the arrest of
  Hildebrand or Witichis by open rebellion. So he took a bold resolution to
  free himself at one stroke from the net which encompassed him in Ravenna. He
  decided to take the Queen, if necessary by force, to Rome. There he was
  mighty, had weapons and adherents; there Amalaswintha would be exclusively in
  his power, and the Goths would be frustrated.</p>

  <p>To his delight, the Queen entered into his plan with eagerness. She longed
  to be out of these walls, where she appeared to be more a prisoner than a
  ruler. She longed for Rome, freedom, and power.</p>

  <p>Cethegus took his measures with his usual rapidity. He was obliged to
  renounce the shorter way by land, for upon the broad Via Flaminia, as well as
  on the other roads from Ravenna to Rome, escorts of Gothic troops were
  stationed, and it was therefore to be feared that their flight by any of
  these ways would be easily discovered, and perhaps impeded.</p>

  <p>Fortunately the Prefect remembered that the Navarchus, or captain of the
  galleys, Pomponius, one of the conspirators, was cruising about in chase of
  African pirates on the east coast of the Adriatic, with three triremes,
  manned by Romans. To him he sent an order to appear in the harbour of Ravenna
  on the night of the Feast of Epiphany. He hoped, while the town was occupied
  with religious festivities, to reach the ships with Amalaswintha easily and
  safely from the gardens of the palace, when they would be taken by sea past
  the Gothic positions to Teate. Thence the way to Rome was short and safe.</p>

  <p>With this plan in his mind&mdash;his messenger had safely gone and
  returned with the promise of Pomponius to appear punctually&mdash;the Prefect
  smiled at the daily increasing hate and insolence of the Goths, who observed
  his position of favourite with bitter displeasure.</p>

  <p>He warned Amalaswintha to be patient and not, by an outbreak of her royal
  wrath against the "rebels," to occasion a collision before the day of
  deliverance, which might easily render vain all plans of rescue.</p>

  <p>The Feast of Epiphany arrived. The people crowded the basilicas and
  squares of the city. The jewels of the treasury were ready ordered and
  packed, as well as the most important documents of the archives. It was
  mid-day.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha and the Prefect had just told their friend Cassiodorus of
  their plan, the boldness of which at first startled him, but he very soon
  perceived its prudence.</p>

  <p>They were just about to leave the room where they had told him of their
  intentions, when suddenly the uproar made by the populace&mdash;who were
  crowding before the palace&mdash;became louder and more violent; threats,
  cries of exultation, and the clatter of arms arose promiscuously.</p>

  <p>Cethegus threw back the curtain of the large bay-window, but he only saw
  the last of the crowd pressing through the open gates of the palace.</p>

  <p>It was not possible to discover the cause of this excitement. Already the
  uproar was ascending the staircase of the palace. The noise of altercations
  with the attendants was audible; the clash of weapons; and soon approaching
  and heavy footsteps.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha did not tremble; she tightly grasped the dragon's head which
  decorated the throne-seat, to which Cassiodorus had again led her.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Cethegus hurried to meet the intruders.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" he called from the threshold of the chamber. "The Queen is visible
  for no one."</p>

  <p>For one moment there was complete silence.</p>

  <p>Then a powerful voice called out: "If for thee, Roman, also for us, for
  her Gothic brethren. Forwards!"</p>

  <p>And again the roar of voices arose, and in a moment Cethegus, without the
  application of any particular violence, was pushed by the press, as if by an
  irresistible tide, into the farthest corner of the hall, and the foremost
  intruders stood close before the throne.</p>

  <p>They were Hildebrand, Witichis, Teja, a gigantic Goth, unknown to
  Cethegus, and near this last&mdash;there was no doubt about it&mdash;the
  three dukes, Thulun, Ibba, and Pitza, in full armour&mdash;three splendid
  warriors.</p>

  <p>The intruders bowed before the throne. Then Duke Thulun called to those
  behind him, with the gesture of a born ruler:</p>

  <p>"Goths, wait yet a short time without! We will try; in your name, to
  adjust things with the Queen. If we do not succeed, we will call upon you to
  act&mdash;you know in what manner."</p>

  <p>With a shout of applause, the crowd behind him willingly withdrew, and
  were soon lost in the outer passages and halls of the palace.</p>

  <p>"Daughter of Theodoric," began Duke Thulun, "we are come because thy son,
  the King, recalled us. Unfortunately we find he is no more alive. We know
  that thou hast no delight in seeing us here."</p>

  <p>"If you know it," said Amalaswintha with dignity, "how dare you,
  notwithstanding, appear before our eyes? Who allows you to intrude upon us
  against our will?"</p>

  <p>"Necessity enjoins it, Highness&mdash;necessity, which has often forced
  stronger bolts than the whims of a woman. We have to announce to thee the
  demands of thy people, which thou wilt fulfil."</p>

  <p>"What language! Knowest thou before whom thou standest, Duke Thulun?"</p>

  <p>"Before the daughter of the Amelungs; whose child I honour, even when she
  errs and transgresses!"</p>

  <p>"Rebel!" cried Amalaswintha, and rose indignantly from her throne. "Thy
  <i>King</i> stands before thee!"</p>

  <p>But Thulun smiled.</p>

  <p>"It would be wiser, Amalaswintha, to be silent upon this point. King
  Theodoric charged thee with the guardianship of thy son&mdash;thee, a woman!
  It was against the law; but we Goths did not interfere between him and his
  kindred. He wished this boy to be his successor. That was not prudent; but
  the nobles and people have honoured the race of the Amelungs and the wish of
  a King, who else was ever wise. But he never wished, and we should never have
  allowed, that after the death of that boy a woman should reign over
  us&mdash;the spindle over the spear."</p>

  <p>"So you refuse to acknowledge me as your Queen?" she cried indignantly.
  "And thou, too, Hildebrand, old friend of Theodoric, thou disownest his
  daughter?"</p>

  <p>"Queen," said the old man, "would that thou wouldst prevent it!"</p>

  <p>Thulun continued:</p>

  <p>"We do not disown thee&mdash;not yet. I only answer thee thus because thou
  boastest of thy right, and thou must know that thou hast no right. But as we
  gladly honour noble birth&mdash;in which we honour ourselves&mdash;and
  because at this moment it might lead to evil dissensions in the kingdom if we
  deprived thee of the crown, I will repeat the conditions under which thou
  mayst continue to wear it."</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha suffered terribly. How gladly would she have delivered the
  bold man who spoke such words into the hands of the executioner! And she was
  obliged to listen helplessly! Tears rose to her eyes; she repressed them, but
  at the same time sank back exhausted upon the throne, supported by
  Cassiodorus.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Cethegus had made his way to her side.</p>

  <p>"Concede everything," he whispered; "it is forced and null. And to-night
  Pomponius will arrive.</p>

  <p>"Speak!" said Cassiodorus; "but spare the woman, barbarians!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Duke Pitza. "She will not be treated like a woman. She
  is our <i>King</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Peace, cousin!" said Duke Thulun reprovingly; "she is of noble blood.
  First," he continued, "thou must dismiss the Prefect of Rome. He is said to
  be an enemy of the Goths; he may not advise the Gothic Queen. Earl Witichis
  will take his place near thy throne."</p>

  <p>"Agreed!" said Cethegus himself, instead of Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>"Secondly, thou wilt declare, in a proclamation, that for the future no
  order of thine can be executed which is not signed by Hildebrand or Witichis;
  and that no law is valid without the ratification of the National
  Assembly."</p>

  <p>The Queen started up angrily; but Cethegus held her arm.</p>

  <p>"Pomponius comes to-night," he whispered. Then he said aloud, "This also
  is agreed to."</p>

  <p>"The third condition," resumed Thulun, "is one which thou wilt as
  willingly grant as we ask it. We three Balthes have not learned to bow our
  heads in a prince's court. The roof here is too low for us. It is better that
  Amelungs and Balthes live as far apart as the eagle and the falcon. And the
  realm needs our weapons upon its boundaries. Our neighbours think that the
  land is orphaned since thy great father died, Avari, Gepidæ, and Sclavonians
  fearlessly overstep the frontiers. In order to punish these three nations,
  thou wilt equip three armies, each of thirty thousand; and we three Balthes
  will lead them, as thy generals, to the east and to the north."</p>

  <p>"The whole military force also in their hands&mdash;not bad!" thought
  Cethegus. "Accepted!" he cried aloud, smiling.</p>

  <p>"And what remains to me," asked Amalaswintha, "when I have granted all
  this?"</p>

  <p>"A golden crown upon a white forehead," said Duke Ibba.</p>

  <p>"Thou canst write like a Greek," re-commenced Thulun. "Such arts are not
  learned in vain. This parchment should contain all that we demand; my slave
  has written it down." He gave it to Witichis to examine. "Is it so? 'Tis
  well. That thou wilt sign, Princess. Good. We have finished. Now, Hildebrand,
  speak with yonder Roman."</p>

  <p>But Teja was beforehand. He advanced to the Prefect, trembling with hate,
  his sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Prefect of Rome," said he, "blood has been shed&mdash;precious, noble,
  Gothic blood! It consecrates the furious strife which will soon be kindled.
  Blood, which thou shalt atone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His voice was suffocated with rage.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" cried Hildebad&mdash;for he was the tall Goth&mdash;pushing him
  aside. "Make not such a to-do about it! My dear brother can easily part with
  a little superfluous blood; and the others lost more than he could spare.
  There, thou black devil!" he cried, turning to Cethegus, and holding a
  broad-sword close before his eyes, "knowest thou that?"</p>

  <p>"Pomponius's sword!" cried Cethegus, turning pale and staggering back a
  step.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha and Cassiodorus asked in alarm,</p>

  <p>"Pomponius?"</p>

  <p>"Aha!" laughed Hildebad. "That is shocking, is it not? Nothing will come
  of the water-party!"</p>

  <p>"Where is Pomponius&mdash;my Navarchus?" asked Amalaswintha
  vehemently.</p>

  <p>"With the sharks, Queen, in deep water."</p>

  <p>"Ha! death and destruction!" exclaimed Cethegus, now carried away by his
  anger. "How happened that?"</p>

  <p>"Merrily enough! My brother Totila&mdash;thou surely knowest
  him?&mdash;lay in the harbour of Ancona with two little ships. Thy friend
  Pomponius had had for some days such an insolent expression of countenance,
  and had let fall such bragging words, that it struck even my unsuspicious
  brother. One morning Pomponius suddenly disappeared from the harbour with his
  three triremes. Totila smelt a rat, spread all sail, pursued him, overtook
  him off Pisaurum, stopped him, went on board with me and a few others, and
  asked him whither he would be going."</p>

  <p>"He had no right to do so. Pomponius will have given him no answer."</p>

  <p>"He did so, for all that, most excellent Cethegus! When he saw that we
  were only ten upon his ship, he laughed, and cried, 'Whither sail I? To
  Ravenna, thou downy-beard, to save the Queen from your claws, and take her
  to. Rome!' And he therewith made a sign to his crew. But we, too, threw our
  shields before us, and&mdash;hurrah! how the swords flew from the sheaths! It
  was hard work&mdash;ten to forty! But happily it did not last long. Our
  comrades in the nearest ship heard the iron rattle, and were quickly
  alongside with their boats, and climbed the bulwarks like cats. Now we had
  the upper hand; but the Navarchus&mdash;to give the devil his
  due!&mdash;would not yield; fought like to madman, and pierced my brother's
  arm through his shield, so that the blood spouted. But then my brother got
  into a rage too, and ran his spear through the other's body, so that he fell
  like an ox. 'Greet the Prefect,' he said, as he lay dying, 'give him my
  sword, his gift, back again, and tell him that no one can cheat Death, else I
  had kept my word!' I swore to him that I would confirm his words. He was a
  brave man. Here is the sword."</p>

  <p>Cethegus took it in silence.</p>

  <p>"The ships yielded, and my brother took them back to Ancona. But I sailed
  here with the swiftest, and met the three Balthes in the harbour, just at the
  right moment."</p>

  <p>A pause ensued, during which Cethegus and Amalaswintha bitterly
  contemplated their desperate position. Cethegus had consented to everything
  in the sure hope of flight, which was now frustrated. His well-considered
  plan was balked; balked by Totila; and hatred of this name entered deeply
  into the Prefect's soul. His grim reflections were interrupted by the voice
  of Thulun, asking:</p>

  <p>"Well, Amalaswintha, wilt thou sign? or shall we call upon the Goths to
  choose a King?"</p>

  <p>At these words Cethegus quickly recovered himself. He took the tablets
  from the hand of the Duke and handed them to the Queen.</p>

  <p>"It is necessary, O Queen," he said in a low voice; "you have no
  choice."</p>

  <p>Cassiodorus gave her the stylus, she wrote her name and Thulun received
  the tablets.</p>

  <p>"'Tis well," said he; "we go to announce to the Goths that their kingdom
  is saved. Thou, Cassiodorus, accompany us to bear witness that all has been
  done without violence."</p>

  <p>At a sign from Amalaswintha the senator obeyed, and followed the Gothic
  leaders to the Forum before the palace.</p>

  <p>When the Queen found herself alone with Cethegus, she started from her
  seat. She could no longer restrain her tears. She passionately struck her
  forehead. Her pride was terribly humbled. She felt the shame of this hour
  more deeply than the loss of husband, father, or even of her son.</p>

  <p>"Then this," she cried, weeping loudly, "this is man's superiority!
  Brutal, clumsy force! O, Cethegus, all is lost!"</p>

  <p>"Not all, Queen, only a plan. I beg you to keep me in kindly remembrance,"
  he added coldly. "I go to Rome."</p>

  <p>"What? you will leave me at this moment? You, you have made me give all
  these promises, which rob me of my throne, and now you forsake me! Oh! it
  were better that I had resisted, I should then have remained indeed a Queen,
  even if they had set the crown upon the head of that rebel Duke!"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," thought Cethegus, "better for you, worse for me. No, no hero
  shall ever again wear this Gothic crown." He had quickly seen that
  Amalaswintha could no longer serve him, and just as quickly he gave her up.
  He was already thinking of a new tool for his plans. Yet he decided to
  disclose to her a portion of his thoughts, in order that she might not act
  upon her own account, contradict her promises, and thereby cause the crown to
  obvert to Thulun. "I go, O Queen," he said; "but I do not therefore forsake
  you. Here I can no longer serve you. They have banished me from your side,
  and will guard you as jealously as a lover his mistress."</p>

  <p>"But what shall I do with these promises? what with the three dukes?"</p>

  <p>"Wait, and, at present, submit. And as to the three dukes," he added
  hesitatingly, "they go to the wars&mdash;perhaps they will never return."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps!" sighed the Queen. "Of what use is a 'perhaps?'"</p>

  <p>Cethegus came close to her.</p>

  <p>"As soon as you wish it&mdash;they <i>shall</i> never return."</p>

  <p>The woman trembled:</p>

  <p>"Murder? Terrible man, of what are you thinking?"</p>

  <p>"Of what is necessary. Murder is a wrong expression. It is self-defence.
  Or a punishment. If you had now the power, you would have a perfect right to
  kill them. They are rebels. They force your royal will. They kill your
  Navarchus; they deserve death."</p>

  <p>"And they <i>shall</i> die," whispered Amalaswintha to herself, clenching
  her fist; "they shall not live, these brutal men, who force a Queen to do
  their behest. You are right&mdash;they shall die!"</p>

  <p>"They must die&mdash;they and," he added in a tone of intense hatred,
  "and&mdash;the young hero!"</p>

  <p>"Wherefore Totila? He is the handsomest and most valiant youth in the
  nation!"</p>

  <p>"He dies!" growled Cethegus. "Oh that he would die ten times over!" And
  such bitter hatred flamed from his eyes, that, suddenly seen in a man of such
  a cold nature, it both startled and terrified Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>"I shall send you from Rome," he continued rapidly in a low tone, "three
  trusty men, Isaurian mercenaries. These you will send after the three
  Balthes, as soon as they have reached their several camps. You understand
  that <i>you</i>, the Queen, send them; for they are executioners, no
  murderers. The three dukes must fall on the same day&mdash;I myself will care
  for handsome Totila&mdash;the bold stroke will alarm the whole nation. During
  the first consternation of the Goths I will hurry here from Rome, with
  troops, to your aid. Farewell."</p>

  <p>He departed, and left alone the helpless woman, upon whose ear now broke
  the shouts of the assembled multitude from the Forum in front of the palace,
  extolling the success of their leaders and the submission of
  Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>She felt quite forsaken. She suspected that the last promise of the
  Prefect was little more than an empty word of comfort to palliate his
  departure. Overcome by sorrow, she rested her cheek upon her beautiful hand,
  and was lost for some time in futile meditations.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the curtain at the entrance rustled. An officer of the palace
  stood before her.</p>

  <p>"Ambassadors from Byzantium desire an audience. Justinus is dead. His
  nephew Justinianus is Emperor. He tenders a brotherly greeting and his
  friendship."</p>

  <p>"Justinianus!" This name penetrated the very soul of the unhappy woman.
  She saw herself robbed of her son, thwarted by her people, forsaken by
  Cethegus. In her sad musings she had been seeking in vain for help and
  support, and, with a sigh of relief, she again repeated,
  "Justinianus&mdash;Byzantium!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-4"
     name="b2-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">In the woods of Fiesole, a modern wanderer coming from
  Florence will find to the right of the high-road the ruins of an extensive
  villa-like edifice. Ivy, saxifrage and wild roses vie with each other in
  concealing the ruins. For centuries the peasants in the neighbouring villages
  have carried away stones from this place in order to dam up the earth of
  their vineyards on the slopes of the hills. But even yet the remains clearly
  show where once stood the colonnade before the house, where the central hall,
  and where the wall of the court.</p>

  <p>Weeds grow luxuriantly in the meadows where once lay in shining order the
  beautiful gardens; nothing has been left of them except the wide marble basin
  of a long dried-up fountain, in whose pebble-filled runnels the lizards now
  sun themselves.</p>

  <p>But in the days of our story the place looked very different. "The Villa
  of Mæcenas at Fæsulæ," as the building, probably with little or no reason,
  was called at that time, was inhabited by happy people; the house ordered by
  a woman's careful hand; the garden enlivened by childhood's bright
  laughter.</p>

  <p>The climbing clematis was gracefully trained up the slender shafts of the
  Corinthian columns in front of the house, and the cheerful vine shaded the
  flat roof. The winding walks in the garden were strewed with white sand, and
  in the outhouses dedicated to domestic uses reigned an order and cleanliness
  which was never to be found in a household served by Roman slaves alone.</p>

  <p>It was sunset.</p>

  <p>The men and maid servants were returning from the fields. The
  heavily-laden hay-carts swung along, drawn by horses which were evidently not
  of Italian breed. The shepherds were driving goats and sheep home from the
  hills, accompanied by large dogs, which scampered on in front, barking
  joyously.</p>

  <p>Close before the yard gate, a couple of Roman slaves, with shrill voices
  and mad gestures, were urging on the panting horses of a cruelly over-laden
  wagon, not with whips, but with sticks, the iron points of which they stuck
  again and again into the same sore place upon the poor animals' hides. In
  spite of this, no advance was made, for a large stone lay just in front of
  the left fore-wheel of the wagon, which the angry and impatient drivers did
  not notice.</p>

  <p>"Forwards, beast! and son of a beast!" screamed one of them to the
  struggling horse; "forwards, thou Gothic sluggard!" Another stab with the
  iron point, a renewed and desperate pull; but the wheel did not go over the
  stone, and the tortured animal fell on its knees, threatening to upset the
  wagon by its struggles.</p>

  <p>At this the rage of the driver was redoubled. "Wait, thou rascal!" he
  shouted, and struck at the eye of the panting animal.</p>

  <p>But he only struck once; the next moment he himself fell under a heavy
  blow.</p>

  <p>"Davus, thou wicked dog!" growled a powerful voice, and, twice as tall,
  and certainly twice as broad as the frightened tormentor, there stood over
  the fallen man a gigantic Goth, who rained down blows upon him with a thick
  cudgel. "Thou miserable coward," said he, giving him a final kick, "I will
  teach thee how to treat a creature which is ten times better than thyself. I
  verily believe, thou rascal, that thou treatest the beast ill, because he
  comes from the other side of the mountains! If I catch thee at it again, I
  will break every bone in thy body. Now get up, and unload&mdash;thou shalt
  carry every swath that is too much into the barn upon thine own back.
  Forwards!"</p>

  <p>With a malicious glance at his punisher the beaten man rose, and, limping,
  prepared to obey.</p>

  <p>The Goth had immediately helped the struggling horse to its feet, and now
  carefully washed its broken knees with his own evening drink of wine and
  water.</p>

  <p>He had scarcely finished his task, when the clear voice of a boy called
  urgently from a neighbouring stable:</p>

  <p>"Wachis, come here; Wachis!"</p>

  <p>"I'm coming, Athalwin, my boy! What's the matter?" And he already stood in
  the open door of the stable near a handsome boy of about seven years of age,
  who angrily stroked his long yellow hair from his glowing face, and with
  great trouble repressed two large tears of rage that <i>would</i> spring into
  his blue eyes. He held a pretty wooden sword in his right hand, and shook it
  threateningly at a black-browed slave who stood opposite to him, with his
  head insolently thrust forward and his fists clenched. "What is the matter
  here?" repeated Wachis, crossing the threshold.</p>

  <p>"The chesnut has again nothing to drink; and only look! Two gadflies have
  sucked themselves fast upon his shoulder, where he cannot get at them with
  his tail, and I cannot reach with my hand; and that bad Cacus there won't do
  what I tell him; and I am sure he has been scolding at me in Latin, which I
  don't understand."</p>

  <p>Wachis drew nearer with a threatening look.</p>

  <p>"I only said," said Cacus, slowly receding, "that I must first eat my
  millet. The beast may wait. In our country men come before beasts."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, thou dunce!" said Wachis, as he killed the gadflies; "in our
  country the horse eats before the rider! Make haste!"</p>

  <p>But Cacus was strong and obstinate; he tossed his head and said:</p>

  <p>"Here, we are in <i>our</i> country, and <i>our</i> customs must be
  followed."</p>

  <p>"Oho, thou cursed blockhead! wilt thou obey?" asked Wachis, raising his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Obey? Not thee! Thou art only a slave like me. And my parents lived in
  this house when such as thou were stealing cows and sheep on the other side
  of the mountains."</p>

  <p>Wachis let his cudgel fall and swung his arms to and fro.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Cacus, I have another crow to pluck with thee besides; thou
  knowest wherefore. Now it can all be done with at the same time."</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha!" cried Cacus with a mocking laugh, "about Liuta, the
  flaxen-haired wench? Bah! I like her no longer, the barbarian. She dances
  like a heifer!"</p>

  <p>"Now it's all up with thee," said Wachis quietly, and caught hold of his
  adversary.</p>

  <p>But Cacus twisted himself like an eel out of the grasp of the Goth, pulled
  a sharp knife from the folds of his woollen frock and threw it at him. As
  Wachis stooped the knife whistled only a hair's-breadth past his head, and
  penetrated deeply into the door-post behind him.</p>

  <p>"Well, wait, thou murderous worm!" cried the German, and would have thrown
  himself upon Cacus, but he felt himself clasped from behind.</p>

  <p>It was Davus, who had watched for this moment of revenge.</p>

  <p>But now Wachis became exceedingly wroth.</p>

  <p>He shook the man off, held him by the nape of the neck with his left hand,
  got hold of Cacus with his right, and, with the strength of a bear, knocked
  the heads of his adversaries together, accompanying every knock with an
  interjection, "There, my boys&mdash;that for the knife&mdash;and that for the
  back-spring&mdash;and that for the heifer!" And who knows how long this
  strange litany would have continued, if he had not been interrupted by a loud
  call.</p>

  <p>"Wachis! Cacus! let loose, I tell you," cried the strong fall voice of a
  woman; and a stately matron, clad in a blue Gothic garment, appeared at the
  door.</p>

  <p>She was not tall, and yet imposing. Her fine figure was more sturdy than
  slender. Her gold-brown hair was bound in simple but rich braids round her
  head; her features were regular; more firm than delicate.</p>

  <p>An expression of sincerity, worth, and trustfulness lay in her large blue
  eyes. Her round bare arms showed that she was no stranger to work. At her
  broad girdle, over which puffed out her brown under-garment of home-spun
  cloth, rattled a bunch of keys; she rested her left hand quietly upon her
  hip, and stretched her right commandingly before her.</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, Rauthgundis, mistress mine," said Wachis, letting loose, "must
  you have your eyes everywhere?"</p>

  <p>"Everywhere, when my servants are at mischief. When will you learn to
  agree? You Italians need a master in the house. But thou, Wachis, shouldst
  not vex the housewife too. Come, Athalwin, come with me."</p>

  <p>And she led the boy away.</p>

  <p>She went into a side-yard, filled her raised skirt with grain out of a
  trough, and fed the fowls and pigeons, which immediately flocked around
  her.</p>

  <p>For a little while Athalwin watched her silently. At last he said:</p>

  <p>"Mother, is it true? Is father a robber?"</p>

  <p>Rauthgundis suspended her occupation, and looked at the child in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Who said so?"</p>

  <p>"Who? Eh, the nephew of Calpurnius! We were playing on the great heap of
  hay in his meadow, and I showed him how far the land belongs to us on the
  right of the hedge&mdash;far and wide&mdash;as far as our servants were
  mowing, and the brook shone in the distance. Then he got angry and said,
  'Yes, and all that land once belonged to us, and thy father or thy
  grandfather stole it, the robbers!'"</p>

  <p>"Indeed! And what didst thou reply?"</p>

  <p>"Eh, nothing at all, mother. I only threw him over the hay-cock, with his
  heels in the air. But now I should like to know if it is true."</p>

  <p>"No, child, it is not true. Your father did not steal it, but took it
  openly, because he was stronger and better than these Italians. And heroes
  have done the same in all ages. And when the Italians were strong and their
  neighbours weak, they did so most of all. But now come; we must look after
  the linen that is bleaching on the green."</p>

  <p>As they turned their backs upon the stables, and were going towards the
  grassy hill on the left of the house, they heard the rapid hoof-beats of a
  horse, which was approaching on the old Roman high-road.</p>

  <p>Athalwin climbed quickly to the top of the hill and looked towards the
  road.</p>

  <p>A rider, mounted on an immense brown charger, galloped down the woody
  heights towards the villa. Brightly sparkled his helmet and the point of the
  lance, which he carried across his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"It is father, mother; it is father!" cried the boy, and ran swift as an
  arrow down the hill to meet the rider.</p>

  <p>Rauthgundis had just now reached the top of the hill. Her heart beat. She
  shaded her eyes with her hand, to look into the evening-red; then she said in
  a low happy voice:</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is he! my husband."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-5"
     name="b2-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile Athalwin had already reached his father and
  climbed up his knee, clinging to his foot.</p>

  <p>The rider lifted him up with a loving hand, set him before him in the
  saddle, and spurred his horse into a gallop. The noble animal, once the
  charger of Theodoric, neighed lustily as he recognised his home and his
  mistress, and shook his flowing mane.</p>

  <p>The rider now reached the hill, and dismounted with the boy.</p>

  <p>"My dear wife!" he exclaimed, embracing her tenderly.</p>

  <p>"My Witichis!" she answered, blushing with pleasure, and clinging to him;
  "welcome home!"</p>

  <p>"I promised that I would come before the new moon&mdash;it was
  difficult&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But thou hast kept thy word, as always."</p>

  <p>"My heart drew me here," he said, putting his arm around her.</p>

  <p>They went on slowly to the house.</p>

  <p>"It seems, Athalwin, that Wallada is of more consequence to thee than thy
  father," said Witichis, smiling, to the boy, who was leading the horse
  carefully after them.</p>

  <p>"No, father; but give me the lance too&mdash;I have not often such a
  pleasure in this country life;" and dragging the long, heavy shaft of the
  spear after him with difficulty, he cried out: "Eh! Wachis, Ansbrand! father
  has come! Fetch the skin of Falernian from the cellar. Father is thirsty
  after his rapid ride!"</p>

  <p>With a smile Witichis stroked the golden curls of the boy, who now hurried
  past them to the house.</p>

  <p>"Well, and how does all go on here?" asked Witichis, looking at
  Rauthgundis.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Witichis. The harvest is all brought in, the grapes crushed,
  the sheaves housed."</p>

  <p>"I do not ask about that," said he, pressing her tenderly to
  him&mdash;"how art thou?"</p>

  <p>"As well as a poor woman can be," she answered, looking up at him, "who
  misses her well-loved husband. Work is the only thing that comforts me, my
  friend; plenty of occupation, which benumbs a sensitive heart. I often think
  how thou, far away amongst strange people, must trouble thyself in court and
  camp, where there is none to cherish thee. At least, I say to myself, he
  shall find his home well-kept and cheerful when he returns. And it is that,
  seest thou, which sanctifies and ennobles all the dull routine of work, and
  makes it dear to me."</p>

  <p>"That's my brave wife! But dost thou not too much fatigue thyself?"</p>

  <p>"Work is healthy. But vexation, and the men's wickedness, <i>that</i>
  hurts me!"</p>

  <p>Witichis stood still.</p>

  <p>"Who dares to grieve thee?"</p>

  <p>"Ah! the Italian servants, and our Italian neighbours! They all hate us.
  Woe to us, if they did not fear us. Calpurnius, our neighbour, is so insolent
  when he knows thou art absent, and the Roman slaves are disobedient and
  false; our Gothic servants alone are good."</p>

  <p>Witichis sighed. They had now arrived at the house, and sat down at a
  marble table under the colonnade.</p>

  <p>"Thou must remember," said Witichis, "that our neighbour was forced to
  give up to us the third part of his estate and slaves."</p>

  <p>"And has kept two-thirds, and his life into the bargain&mdash;he ought to
  thank God!" answered Rauthgundis contemptuously.</p>

  <p>Just then Athalwin came running with a basketful of apples, which he had
  plucked from the tree. Presently Wachis and the other German servants came
  with wine, meat, and cheese, and greeted their master with a frank clasp of
  the hand.</p>

  <p>"Well done, my children. The mistress praises you. But where are Davus,
  Cacus, and the others?"</p>

  <p>"Pardon, sir," answered Wachis, grinning, "they have a bad
  conscience."</p>

  <p>"Why? What about?"</p>

  <p>"Eh!&mdash;I think&mdash;because I have beaten them little; they are
  ashamed."</p>

  <p>The other men laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, it will do them no harm," said Witichis; "go now to your meal.
  To-morrow I will examine your work."</p>

  <p>The men went.</p>

  <p>"What is that about Calpurnius?" asked Witichis, pouring wine into his
  cup.</p>

  <p>Rauthgundis blushed and hesitated.</p>

  <p>"He has carried away the hay from the mountain meadow," she then replied,
  "which our men had mowed; and has put it into his barn by night, and will not
  return it."</p>

  <p>"He will return it quickly enough, I think," said her husband quietly, as
  he took up his cup and drank.</p>

  <p>"Yes," cried Athalwin eagerly, "I think so too! And if he will not, all
  the better for me! Then we will declare war, and I will go over with Wachis
  and all the great fellows, with weapons and pikes! He always looks at me so
  wickedly, the black spy!"</p>

  <p>Rauthgundis told him to be silent, and sent him to bed.</p>

  <p>"Very well, I will go," he said; "but, father, when thou comest again,
  thou wilt bring me a real weapon, instead of this stick, wilt thou not?" and
  he ran into the house.</p>

  <p>"Contentions with these Italians never cease," said Witichis; "the very
  children inherit the feeling. But it causes thee far too much vexation here.
  So much the more willingly wilt thou do what I now propose: come with me to
  Ravenna, Rauthgundis, to court."</p>

  <p>His wife looked at him with astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Thou art joking!" she said incredulously. "Thou hast never before wished
  it! During the nine years of our married life, it has never entered thy head
  to take me to court! I believe no one in all the nation knows that a
  Rauthgundis exists. For a surety, thou hast kept our marriage secret," she
  added, smiling, "like a crime!"</p>

  <p>"Like a treasure!" said Witichis, embracing her.</p>

  <p>"I have never asked thee wherefore. I was and am happy; and I thought and
  think now: he has his reason."</p>

  <p>"I had a good reason: it exists no longer. Now thou mayest know all. A few
  months after I had found thee amid the solitudes of thy mountains, and had
  conceived an affection for thee, King Theodoric hit upon the strange idea, to
  unite me in marriage with his sister Amalaberga, the widow of the King of the
  Thuringians, who needed the protection of a man against her wicked
  neighbours, the Franks."</p>

  <p>"Thou wert to wear a crown?" asked Rauthgundis, with sparkling eyes.</p>

  <p>"But Rauthgundis was dearer to me," continued Witichis, "than Queen or
  crown, and I said, No. It vexed the King exceedingly, and he only forgave me
  when I told him that probably I should never marry. At that time I could not
  hope ever to call thee mine; thou knowest how long thy father suspiciously
  and sternly refused to trust thee to me; but when, notwithstanding, thou wert
  become my wife, I considered that it would not be wise to show the King the
  woman for whose sake I had refused his sister."</p>

  <p>"But why hast thou concealed all this from me for nine long years?"</p>

  <p>"Because," he said, looking lovingly into her eyes, "because I know my
  Rauthgundis. Thou wouldst ever have imagined I had lost I know not what with
  that crown! But now the King is dead, and I am permanently bound to the
  court. Who knows when I shall again rest in the shadow of these columns, in
  the peace of this roof?"</p>

  <p>And he related briefly the fall of the Prefect, and what position he now
  held near Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>Rauthgundis listened attentively; then she took his hand and pressed
  it.</p>

  <p>"It is good, Witichis, that the Goths gradually find out thy worth, and
  thou art more cheerful, I think, than usual."</p>

  <p>"Yes; I feel more contented since I can bear part of the burden of the
  time. It was much more difficult to stand idly by and see it pressing heavily
  upon my nation. I am only sorry for the Queen, she is like a prisoner."</p>

  <p>"Bah! Why did the woman grasp at the office of a man? Such a thing would
  never enter my head."</p>

  <p>"Thou art no Queen, Rauthgundis, and Amalaswintha is proud."</p>

  <p>"I am ten times prouder than she! but not so vain. She can never have
  loved a man, nor understood his nature and worth, otherwise she could not
  wish to fill a man's place."</p>

  <p>"At court that is looked upon in a different manner. But do come with me
  to Ravenna."</p>

  <p>"No, Witichis," she quietly said, rising from her seat, "the court is not
  fit for me, nor I for the court. I am the child of a mountain farmer, and far
  too uncultured. Look at this brown neck," she laughed, "and these rough
  hands! I cannot tinkle on the lyre, or read verses. I should be ill suited
  for the fine Roman ladies, and thou wouldst have little honour with me."</p>

  <p>"Surely thou dost not consider thyself too bad for the court?"</p>

  <p>"No, Witichis, too good."</p>

  <p>"Well, people must learn to bear with and appreciate each other."</p>

  <p>"I could not do that. They could perhaps learn to bear with me, out of
  fear of thee. But I should daily tell them to their faces that they are
  hollow, false, and bad!"</p>

  <p>"So, then, thou wilt rather do without thy husband for months?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, rather do without him, than be near him in a false and unfitting
  position. Oh, my Witichis!" she added, encircling his neck with her arm,
  "consider who I am and how thou foundest me! where the last settlements of
  our people dot the edge of the Alps, high up upon the steep precipices of the
  Scaranzia; where the youthful Isara breaks foaming out of the ravines into
  the open plains, there stands my father's lonely farm; there I knew of nought
  but the hard work of summer upon the quiet alms, of winter in the
  smoke-blackened hall, spinning with the maids. My mother died early, and my
  brothers were killed by the Italians. So I grew up lonely, no one near me but
  my old father, who was as true, but also as hard and close, as his native
  rocks. There I saw nothing of the world which lay outside our mountains. Only
  sometimes, from a height, I watched with curiosity a pack-horse going along
  the road deep below in the valley, laden with salt or wine. I sat through
  many a shining summer evening upon the jagged peaks of the high Arn, and
  looked at the sun sinking splendidly over the far-away river Licus; and I
  wondered what it had seen the whole long summer day, since it had risen over
  the broad Oenus; and I thought how I should like to know what things looked
  like at the other side of the Karwändel, or away behind the Brennus, over
  which my brothers had gone and had never returned. And yet I felt how
  beautiful it was up there in the green solitude, where I heard the golden
  eagle screaming in its near eyrie, and where I plucked more lovely flowers
  than ever grow in the plains, and even, sometimes, heard by night the
  mountain-wolf howling outside the stable-door, and frightened it away with a
  torch. In early autumn, too, and in the long winter, I had time to sit and
  muse; when the white mist-veils spun themselves over the lofty pines; when
  the mountain wind tore the blocks of stone from our straw-roof, and the
  avalanches thundered from the precipices. So I grew up, strange to the world
  beyond the next forest, only at home in the quiet world of my thoughts, and
  in the narrow life of the peasant. Then thou earnest&mdash;I remember it as
  if it had happened yesterday&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She ceased, lost in recollection.</p>

  <p>"I remember it too, exactly," said Witichis. "I was leading a centumvirate
  from Juvavia to the Augusta-town on the Licus. I had lost my way and my
  people. For a long time I had wandered about in the sultry summer day,
  without finding a path, when I saw smoke rising above a fir-tree grove, and
  soon I found a hidden farm, and entered the yard-gate. There stood a splendid
  girl at the pump, lifting a bucket&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look, even here in the valley, in this southern valley of the Alps, it is
  often too close for me; and I long for a breath of air from the pine-woods of
  my mountains. But at court, in the narrow gilded chambers! there I should
  languish and pine away. Leave me here; I shall manage Calpurnius well enough.
  And thou, I know well, wilt still think of home, wife, and child, when absent
  in the royal halls."</p>

  <p>"Yes, God knows, with longing thoughts! Well then, remain here, and God
  keep thee, my good wife!"</p>

  <p>The second day after this conversation Witichis again rode away up the
  wooded heights.</p>

  <p>The parting hour had made him almost tender; but he had firmly checked the
  outbreak of feeling which it was so repugnant to his simple and manly nature
  to indulge in. How the brave man's heart clung to his trusty wife and darling
  boy!</p>

  <p>Behind him trotted Wachis, who would not be prevented from accompanying
  his master for a short distance.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he rode up to him.</p>

  <p>"Sir," said he, "I know something."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Why didst not tell it?"</p>

  <p>"Because no one asked me about it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I ask thee about it."</p>

  <p>"Yes; if one is asked, then of course he must answer! The mistress has
  told you that Calpurnius is such a bad neighbour?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; what about that?"</p>

  <p>"But she did not tell you since when?"</p>

  <p>"No; dost thou know?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it was about half a year ago. About that time Calpurnius once met
  the mistress in the wood, alone as they both thought; but they were not
  alone. Some one lay in a ditch, and was taking his mid-day nap."</p>

  <p>"Thou wert that sluggard!"</p>

  <p>"Rightly guessed. And Calpurnius said something to the mistress."</p>

  <p>"What did he say?"</p>

  <p>"That I did not understand. But the mistress was not idle; she lifted her
  hand and struck him in the face with such a smack, that it resounded. And
  since then our neighbour is a bad neighbour, and I wanted to tell you,
  because I thought the mistress would not wish to vex you about the rascal;
  but still it is better that you know it. And see! there stands Calpurnius at
  his house door; do you see? and now farewell, dear master."</p>

  <p>And with this he turned his horse and galloped home. But the blood rushed
  to Witichis' face.</p>

  <p>He rode up to his neighbour's door. Calpurnius was about to retreat into
  the house, but Witichis called to him in such a voice, that he was obliged to
  remain.</p>

  <p>"What do you want with me, neighbour Witichis?" he asked, looking up at
  him askance.</p>

  <p>Witichis drew rein, and stopped his horse close to him. Then he held his
  clenched iron-gloved fist close before his neighbour's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Neighbour Calpurnius," he said quietly, "if <i>I</i> ever strike thee in
  the face, thou wilt never rise again."</p>

  <p>Calpurnius started back in a fright.</p>

  <p>But Witichis gave his horse the spur, and rode proudly and slowly upon his
  way.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-6"
     name="b2-6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">In his study at Rome, comfortably stretched upon the soft
  cushions of a lectus, lay Cethegus the Prefect.</p>

  <p>He was of good cheer.</p>

  <p>His examination had ended with full acquittal. Only in case of an
  immediate search in his house&mdash;such as the young King had ordered, but
  which his death had frustrated&mdash;could discovery have been
  apprehended.</p>

  <p>He had succeeded in gaining permission to complete the fortifications of
  Rome, supplying the funds out of his own exchequer, which circumstance still
  more increased his influence in that city.</p>

  <p>The evening before he had held a meeting in the Catacombs. All the reports
  were favourable; the patriots were increasing in number and means.</p>

  <p>The greater oppression which since the late occurrences at Ravenna weighed
  upon the Italians, could but serve to add to the ranks of the malcontents;
  and, which was the main thing, Cethegus now held all the threads of the
  conspiracy in his own hands. Even the most jealous Republicans implicitly
  acknowledged the necessity of committing the conduct of affairs, until the
  day of deliverance, to the most gifted of men.</p>

  <p>The feeling against the barbarians had made such progress amongst all
  Italians, that Cethegus could entertain the project of striking a blow
  without the help of the Byzantines, as soon as ever Rome was sufficiently
  fortified.</p>

  <p>"For," he repeatedly told himself, "all foreign liberators are easily
  summoned, but with difficulty discarded."</p>

  <p>Musing thus, Cethegus reposed upon his lectus. He laid aside Cæsar's
  "Civil Wars," the leaves of which he had been turning over, and said to
  himself:</p>

  <p>"The gods must have great things in store for me; whenever I fall, it is
  like a cat&mdash;upon my feet and unhurt. Ah! when things go well with us, we
  like to share our content with others. But it is too dangerous a pleasure to
  put trust in another, and Silence is the only faithful goddess. And yet one
  is human, and would like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here a slave entered&mdash;the old Ostiarius Fidus&mdash;and silently
  handed to Cethegus a letter upon a flat golden salver.</p>

  <p>"The bearer waits," he said, and left the room.</p>

  <p>Cethegus took up the letter. But as soon as he recognised the design upon
  the wax seal which secured the string twisted round the tablets&mdash;the
  Dioscuri&mdash;he cried eagerly, "From Julius&mdash;at a happy hour!" hastily
  untied the string, opened the tablets, and read, his cold and pale
  countenance flushed with a warmth of pleasure usually wholly strange to
  him:</p>

  <p>"'To Cethegus the Prefect, from Julius Montanus.</p>

  <p>"'How long it is, my fatherly preceptor'&mdash;(by Jupiter! that sounds
  frosty)&mdash;'that I have delayed sending you the greeting which I owe you.
  The last time I wrote from the green banks of the Ilissos, where I sought for
  traces of Plato in the desolated groves of the Akademia, but found none. I
  know well that my letter was not cheerful. The sad philosophers, wandering in
  the lonely schools, surrounded by the oppressions of the Emperor, the
  suspicion of the priests, and the coldness of the multitude, could only
  arouse my compassion. My soul was gloomy; I knew not wherefore. I blamed my
  ingratitude to you, the most generous of all benefactors.'</p>

  <p>"He has never given me such intolerable names before," observed
  Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"'For two years I have travelled, accompanied by your slaves and freedmen,
  endowed like a King of the Syrians with your riches, through all Asia and
  Hellas; I have enjoyed all the beauty and wisdom of the ancients, and my
  heart is still unsatisfied, my life empty. Not the enthusiastic wisdom of
  Plato; not the gilded ivory of Phidias; not Homer and not Thucydides gave me
  what I wanted! At last, at last, here in Neapolis, in this blooming,
  God-endowed city; here I found what I had unconsciously missed and sought for
  everywhere. Not dead wisdom, but warm, living happiness.'&mdash;(He is in
  love! At last, thou coy Hippolyte! Thanks, Eros and Anteros!)&mdash;'Oh! my
  guardian, my father! do you know what happiness it is for the first time to
  call a heart that completely understands you, your own?'&mdash;(Ah, Julius!"
  sighed the Prefect, with a singular expression of softened sentiment, "as if
  I knew it not?)&mdash;'a heart to which one can freely open his whole soul?
  Oh! if you have ever proved it, rejoice with me! sacrifice to Jupiter, the
  fulfiller! For the first time I have found a friend!'</p>

  <p>"What does he say?" cried Cethegus indignantly; and starting up with a
  look of jealous pain, "The ungrateful boy!"</p>

  <p>"'For thou wilt understand it well, until now I had no bosom friend. You,
  my fatherly preceptor&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>Cethegus threw the tablets upon the tortoise-shell table, and walked
  hastily up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"Folly!" he then said quietly, took up the letter again, and read on:</p>

  <p>"'You, so much older, wiser, better, greater than I&mdash;you had laid
  such a weight of gratitude and reverence upon my young soul, that it could
  never unfold itself to you without reserve. I have also often heard with
  discouragement the biting wit with which you mocked at all warmth and
  softness of feeling; and a sharp expression about your proud and
  closely-compressed mouth has always killed such feelings in me, as the
  night-frost kills the first violets.'&mdash;(Well, at all events, he is
  sincere!)&mdash;'But now I have found a friend&mdash;frank, warm, young, and
  enthusiastic&mdash;and I feel a delight hitherto unknown to me. We are one in
  heart and soul; we wander together on sunny days and moonlight nights through
  the Elysian fields, and are never at a loss for winged words. But I must soon
  close this letter. He is a Goth'&mdash;(that too!" cried Cethegus,
  angrily)&mdash;"'and is named Totila.'"</p>

  <p>Cethegus let drop the hand which held the letter. He said nothing. He only
  shut his eyes for an instant, and then he quietly read on again:</p>

  <p>"'And is named Totila. The day after my arrival in Neapolis, as I was
  lounging through the Forum of Neptune, and admiring some statues under the
  arches of a neighbouring house which had been exposed for sale by a sculptor,
  there suddenly rushed at me, out of the door of this house, a grey-haired man
  with a woollen apron, all over white with plaster, and holding in his hand a
  pointed tool. He grasped my shoulder and shouted, "Pollux, my Pollux! have I
  found thee at last!" I thought the old fellow was mad, and said, "You
  mistake, old man, I am called Julius, and come from Athens." "No," cried he;
  "thou art named Pollux, and come from Olympus!" And before I knew what had
  happened, he had pushed me into the house. There I gradually found out what
  was the matter. It was the sculptor who had exposed the statues. In the
  ante-chamber stood many half-finished works, and the sculptor explained to me
  that for years he had been thinking of a group of the Dioscuri. For the
  Castor he had found a charming model in a young Goth. "But in vain," he
  continued, "have I prayed to Heaven for an inspiration for my Pollux. He must
  resemble the Castor; like him, a brother of Helena and a son of Jupiter.
  Complete similarity of feature and form must be there, and yet the difference
  must be as apparent as the resemblance; they must each be completely
  individual. In vain I sought in all the baths and gymnasiums of Neapolis. I
  could not find the Leda-twin. And now a god&mdash;Jupiter himself&mdash;has
  led thee to my door! It struck me like lightning when I saw thee, 'There
  stands my Pollux, just as he ought to look!' And I will never let thee depart
  living from my house until thou hast promised me thy head and thy body." I
  willingly promised the strange old man to come again the next day; and I did
  so the more gladly when I afterwards learnt that my violent friend was
  Xenarchus, the greatest sculptor in marble and bronze that Italia has known
  for a long time. The next day I went again, and found my Castor. It was
  Totila; and I cannot deny that the great resemblance surprised me, although
  Totila is older, taller, stronger, and incomparably more handsome than I.
  Xenarchus says that we are like a pale and a gold-coloured citron&mdash;for
  Totila has fairer hair and beard&mdash;and just in this manner, the master
  swears, were the two Dioscuri alike and unlike. So we learnt to know and love
  each other amongst the statues of the gods and goddesses in the studio of
  Xenarchus; became, in truth, Castor and Pollux, inseparable and intimate as
  they; and already the merry populace of Neapolis calls us by these names when
  we wander arm in arm through the streets. But our new-made friendship was
  still more quickly ripened by a threatened danger, which might easily have
  nipped it in the bud. One evening, as usual, we had wandered out of the Porta
  Nolana to seek refreshment after the heat of the day in the Baths of
  Tiberius. After the bath&mdash;in a mood of sportive tenderness&mdash;you
  will blame it&mdash;I had thrown my friend's mantle over me, and set his
  helmet, decorated with the swan's wings, upon my head. He entered into the
  joke, and, with a smile, threw my chlamys[4] around him; and, chatting
  peacefully, we went back through the pine grove in the gloom of approaching
  night to the city. All at once a man sprang upon me from a taxus-bush behind
  me, and I felt cold steel at my throat. But the next moment the murderer lay
  at my feet, Totila's sword in his breast. Only slightly wounded, I bent over
  the dying man, and asked him what reason he had to hate and murder me. But he
  stared in my face, and breathed out, "Not thee&mdash;Totila, the Goth!" and
  he gave a convulsive shiver and was dead. By his costume and weapons, we saw
  that he was an Isaurian mercenary.'"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[4. A Grecian rider's upper garment, worn by the Romans
  of that time.]</p>

  <p>Again the hand which held the letter dropped, and Cethegus pressed the
  other to his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Madness of chance!" he said; "to what mightest thou not have led!" And he
  read to the end. '"Totila said he had many enemies at Ravenna. We reported
  the incident to Uliaris, the Gothic Earl at Neapolis. He caused the corpse to
  be examined, and instituted an inquiry&mdash;without result. But this grave
  event has cemented our youthful friendship and consecrated it with blood for
  ever. It has united us in an earnest and holy bond. The seal-ring of the
  Dioscuri, which you gave me at parting, was a friendly omen, and it has been
  pleasantly fulfilled; and when I ask myself to whom is owing all my
  happiness, it is to you, to you alone, who sent me to this city, where I have
  found all that I wanted! So may the gods requite you for it! Ah, I see that
  my letter speaks only of myself and this friendship&mdash;write to me
  speedily, I beg, and let me know how things go with
  you.&mdash;<i>Vale</i>."</p>

  <p>A bitter smile passed across the Prefect's expressive mouth, and he again
  measured the room with rapid strides. At last he stopped, supporting his chin
  in his hand:</p>

  <p>"How can I be so&mdash;childish&mdash;as to vex myself? It is all very
  natural, if very foolish. You are sick, Julius. Wait; I will write you a
  prescription."</p>

  <p>And with an expression of pleased malice on his face, he seated himself
  upon the writing-divan, took a Cnidian reed-pen, and wrote with the red ink
  from a cup of agate, in the shape of a lion's head, which was screwed into
  the lectus:</p>

  <p>"To Julius Montanus: Cethegus, Prefect of Rome.</p>

  <p>"Your touching epistle from Neapolis amused me much. It shows that you
  have not yet outlived the last childish ailments. When you have laid them
  aside you will be a man. In order to precipitate this crisis, I will
  prescribe the best means. You will at once seek for the trader in purple,
  Valerius Procillus, the oldest friend that I have in Neapolis. He is the
  richest merchant of the East, an inveterate enemy of the Emperor of
  Byzantium, and as good a republican as Cato; merely on that account he is my
  trusted friend. But his daughter, Valeria Procilla, is the most beautiful
  Roman girl of our time, and a true daughter of the ancient, the heathen
  world. She is only three years younger than you, and therefore ten times as
  wise. At the same time her father will not refuse you if you explain to him
  that Cethegus sues for you. But thou wilt fall deeply in love at first sight!
  Of this I am sure; although I tell it you beforehand, although you know that
  I wish it. In her arms you will forget all the friends in the world; when the
  sun rises, the moon pales. Besides, do you know that your Castor is one of
  the most dangerous enemies of the Romans? And I once knew a certain Julius
  who swore: 'Rome before all things!'&mdash;<i>Vale</i>."</p>

  <p>Cethegus rolled the papyrus together, tied it with a string of red bast,
  fastened the knot with wax, and pressed his amethyst ring, engraved with a
  splendid head of Jupiter, upon it. Then he touched a silver eagle which
  protruded from the marble wainscoting of the room; outside, upon the wall of
  the vestibule, a bronze thunderbolt struck upon the silver shield of a fallen
  Titan with a clear bell-like tone. The slave re-entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Let the messenger have a bath; give him food and wine, a gold solidus,
  and this letter. To-morrow at sunrise he will return to Neapolis."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-7"
     name="b2-7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">Several weeks later we find the grave Prefect in a circle
  which seemed very ill-suited to his lofty character, or even to his age.</p>

  <p>In the singular juxtaposition of heathenism and Christianity which, during
  the first century succeeding Constantine's conversion, filled the life and
  manners of the Roman world with such harsh contrasts, the peaceful mingling
  of the old and the new religious festivals played a striking part. Generally
  the merry feasts of the ancient gods still existed, together with the great
  holidays of the Christian Church, though usually robbed of their original
  significance, of their religious kernel. The people allowed themselves to be
  deprived of the belief in Jupiter and Juno, of sacrifices and ceremonies, but
  not of the games, the festivities, the dances and banquets, by which those
  ceremonies had been accompanied; and the Church was at all times wise and
  tolerant enough to suffer what she could not prevent. Thus, even the truly
  heathen Lupercalia, which were distinguished by gross superstition and all
  kinds of rude excess, were only, and with great difficulty, abolished in the
  year 496.</p>

  <p>The days of the Floralia were come, which formerly were celebrated over
  the whole continent with noisy games and dances, as being specially a feast
  of happy youth; and which, in the days we speak of, were at least passed in
  banqueting and drinking.</p>

  <p>And so the two Licinii, with their circle of young gallants and
  patricians, had made an appointment to meet together for a symposium upon the
  principal holiday of the Floralia, to which, as at our picnics, every one
  contributed his share of food and wine.</p>

  <p>The guests assembled at the house of young Kallistratos, an amiable and
  rich Greek from Corinth, who had settled in Rome to enjoy an artistic
  leisure, and had built, near the gardens of Sallust, a tasteful house, which
  became the focus of luxury and polite society.</p>

  <p>Besides the rich Roman aristocracy, this house was particularly frequented
  by artists and scholars; and also by that stratum of the Roman youth, which
  could spare little time and thought from its horses, chariots and dogs for
  the State, and which until now had therefore been inaccessible to the
  influence of the Prefect.</p>

  <p>For this reason Cethegus was well-pleased when young Lucius Licinius, now
  his most devoted adherent, brought him an invitation from the Corinthian.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Licinius modestly, "that we can offer you no appropriate
  entertainment; and if the Falernian and Cyprian, with which Kallistratos
  regales his guests, do not entice you, you can decline to come."</p>

  <p>"No, my son; I will come," said Cethegus; "and it is not the old Cyprian
  which tempts me, but the young Romans."</p>

  <p>Kallistratos, who loved to display his Grecian origin, had built his house
  in the midst of Rome in Grecian style; not in the style then prevalent, but
  in that of the free Greece of Pericles, which, by contrast with the tasteless
  overcharging usual in Rome in those days, made an impression of noble
  simplicity.</p>

  <p>Through a narrow passage one entered the peristyle, or open court,
  surrounded by a colonnade, in the centre of which a splashing fountain fell
  into a coloured marble basin. The colonnade, open to the north, contained,
  besides other rooms, the banqueting hall, in which the company was now
  assembled.</p>

  <p>Cethegus had stipulated that he should not be present at the coena, or
  actual banquet, but only at the compotatio, the drinking-bout which
  followed.</p>

  <p>So he found the friends in the elegant drinking-room, where the bronze
  lamps upon the tortoise-shell slabs on the walls were already lighted, and
  the guests, crowned with roses and ivy, lay upon the cushions of the
  horse-shoe-shaped triclinium.</p>

  <p>A stupefying mixture of wine-odours and flower-scents, a glare of torches
  and glow of colour, met him upon the threshold.</p>

  <p>"<i>Salve</i>, Cethegus!" cried the host, as he entered. "You find but a
  small party."</p>

  <p>Cethegus ordered the slave who followed him, a beautiful and slender young
  Moor, whose finely-shaped limbs were rather revealed than hidden by the
  scarlet gauze of his light tunic, to unloose his sandals. Meanwhile he
  counted the guests.</p>

  <p>"Not less than the Graces, nor more than the Muses," he said with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Quick, choose a wreath," said Kallistratos, "and take your place up
  there, upon the seat of honour on the couch. We have chosen you beforehand
  for the king of the feast."</p>

  <p>The Prefect was determined to charm these young people. He knew how well
  he could do so, and that day he wished to make a particular impression. He
  chose a crown of roses, and took the ivory sceptre, which a Syrian slave
  handed to him upon his knees.</p>

  <p>Placing the rose-wreath on his head, he raised the sceptre with
  dignity.</p>

  <p>"Thus I put an end to your freedom!"</p>

  <p>"A born ruler!" cried Kallistratos, half in joke, half in earnest.</p>

  <p>"But I will be a gentle tyrant! My first law: one-third
  water&mdash;two-thirds wine."</p>

  <p>"Oho!" cried Lucius Licinius, and drank to him, "<i>bene te!</i> you
  govern luxuriously. Equal parts is usually our strongest mixture."</p>

  <p>"Yes, friend," said Cethegus, smiling, and seating himself upon the corner
  seat of the central triclinium, the "Consul's seat," "but I took lessons in
  drinking amongst the Egyptians; they drink pure wine. Ho,
  cupbearer&mdash;what is he called?"</p>

  <p>"Ganymede&mdash;he is from Phrygia. Fine fellow&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"So, Ganymede, obey thy Jupiter, and place near each guest; a patera of
  Mamertine wine&mdash;but near Balbus two, because he is a countryman."</p>

  <p>The young people laughed.</p>

  <p>Balbus was a rich Sicilian proprietor, still quite young, and already very
  stout.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" said he, laughing, "ivy round my head, and an amethyst on my
  finger&mdash;I defy the power of Bacchus!"</p>

  <p>"Well, at which wine have you arrived?" asked Cethegus, at the same time
  signing to the Moor who now stood behind him, and who at once brought a
  second wreath of roses, and, this time, wound it about his neck.</p>

  <p>"Must of Setinum, with honey from Hymettus, was the last. There, try it!"
  said Piso, the roguish poet, whose epigrams and anacreontics could not be
  copied quickly enough by the booksellers; and whose finances,
  notwithstanding, were always in poetical disorder. He handed to the Prefect
  what we should call a <i>vexing-cup</i>, a bronze serpent's-head, which,
  lifted carelessly to the lips, violently shot a stream of wine into the
  drinker's throat.</p>

  <p>But Cethegus knew the trick, drank carefully, and returned the cup.</p>

  <p>"I like your <i>dry</i> wit better, Piso," he said, laughing; and snatched
  a wax tablet from a fold in the other's garment.</p>

  <p>"Oh, give it me back," said Piso; "it is no verses&mdash;just the
  contrary&mdash;a list of my debts for wine and horses."</p>

  <p>"Well," observed Cethegus, "I have taken it&mdash;so it and they are mine.
  To-morrow you may fetch the quittance at my house; but not for
  nothing&mdash;for one of your most spiteful epigrams upon my pious friend
  Silverius."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Cethegus!" cried the poet, delighted and flattered, "how spiteful one
  can be for 40,000 solidi! Woe to the holy man of God!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-8"
     name="b2-8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">"And the dessert&mdash;how far have you got there?" asked
  Cethegus, "already at the apples? are these they?" and he looked, screwing up
  his eyes, at two heaped-up fruit-baskets, which stood upon a bronze table
  with ivory legs.</p>

  <p>"Ha, victory!" laughed Marcus Licinius, Lucius's younger brother, who
  amused himself with the then fashionable pastime of modelling in wax. "There!
  you see my art, Kallistratos! The Prefect thinks that my waxen apples, which
  I gave you yesterday, are real."</p>

  <p>"Ah, indeed!" cried Cethegus, as if astonished, although he had long since
  noticed the smell of the wax with dislike. "Yes, art deceives the most acute.
  With whom did you learn? I should like to put similar ornaments in my
  Kyzikenian hall."</p>

  <p>"I am an autodidact," said Marcus proudly, "and to-morrow I will send you
  my new Persian apples&mdash;for you honour art."</p>

  <p>"But is the sitting at an end?" asked the Prefect, resting his left arm on
  the cushions of the triclinium.</p>

  <p>"No," cried the host, "I will confess the truth. As I could not reckon
  upon the king of our feast until the dessert, I have prepared a little
  after-feast to be taken with the wine."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you sinner!" cried Balbus, wiping his greasy lips upon the rough
  purple Turkish table-cover, "and I have eaten such a terrible quantity of
  your <i>becca-ficchi</i>!"</p>

  <p>"It is against the agreement!" cried Marcus Licinius.</p>

  <p>"It will spoil my manners," said the merry Piso gravely.</p>

  <p>"Say, is that Hellenic simplicity?" asked Lucius Licinius.</p>

  <p>"Peace, friends!" and Cethegus comforted them with a quotation: "'E'en
  unexpected hurt, a Roman bears unmoved.'"</p>

  <p>"The Hellenic host must adjust himself according to his guests," said
  Kallistratos, excusing himself. "I feared you would not come again if I
  offered you Marathonian fare."</p>

  <p>"Well, at least confess with what you menace us," cried Cethegus. "Thou,
  Nomenclator! read the bill of fare. I will then decide upon the suitable
  wines."</p>

  <p>The slave&mdash;a handsome Lydian boy, dressed in a garment of blue
  Pelusian linen, slit up to the knee&mdash;came close to Cethegus at the
  cypress-wood table, and read from a little tablet which he carried fastened
  to a golden chain about his neck:</p>

  <p>"Fresh oysters from Britannia, in tunny-sauce, with lettuce."</p>

  <p>"With this dish, Falernian from Fundi," said Cethegus at once. "But where
  is the sideboard with the cups? Good wine deserves handsome goblets."</p>

  <p>"There is the sideboard!" And at a sign from the host, a curtain, which
  had concealed a corner of the room opposite the guests, dropped.</p>

  <p>A cry of astonishment ran round the table.</p>

  <p>The richness of the service displayed, and the taste with which it was
  arranged, surprised even these fastidious feasters.</p>

  <p>Upon the marble slab of a side-table stood a roomy silver carriage, with
  golden wheels and bronze horses. It was a model of a booty-wagon, such as
  were used in Roman triumphal processions, and, like a costly booty, within it
  was piled, in seeming disorder, but with an artistic hand, a quantity of
  goblets, glasses, and salvers, of every shape and material.</p>

  <p>"By Mars the Victor!" laughed the Prefect, "the first Roman triumph for
  two hundred years! A rare sight! Dare I destroy it?"</p>

  <p>"You are the man to set it up again," said Lucius, with fire.</p>

  <p>"Do you think so? Let us try! First, we will have that goblet of
  pistachio-wood for the Falernian."</p>

  <p>"Wind-thrushes from the Tagus, with asparagus from Tarento," continued the
  Lydian, reading the bill of fare.</p>

  <p>"With that, red Massikian from Sinuessa, to be drunk out of that amethyst
  goblet."</p>

  <p>"Young lobsters from Trapezunt, with flamingo-tongues."</p>

  <p>"Stop! By holy Bacchus!" cried Balbus, "it is the torture of Tantalus. It
  is all the same to me out of what I drink, whether from pistachio-wood or
  amethyst; but to listen to this list of divine dainties with a dry throat, is
  more than I can stand. Down with Cethegus, the tyrant! Let him die, if he
  lets us thirst!"</p>

  <p>"I feel as if I were Emperor, and heard the roar of the faithful Roman
  populace! I will save my life and yield. Serve the dishes, slaves."</p>

  <p>At this the sound of flutes was heard from an outer room, and six slaves
  entered, marching in time to the music, with ivy in their shining, anointed
  locks, and dressed in red mantles and white tunics. They gave to each guest a
  snowy cloth of finest Sidonian linen, with purple fringes.</p>

  <p>"Oh," cried Massurius, a young merchant who traded principally with
  beautiful slaves of both sexes, and enjoyed the rather doubtful reputation of
  being a great critic in such wares, "the best cloth is beautiful hair," and
  he passed his hands through the locks of a Ganymede who was kneeling near
  him.</p>

  <p>"But, Kallistratos, I hope those flutes are of the female sex. Up with the
  curtain; let the girls in."</p>

  <p>"Not yet," ordered Cethegus. "First drink, then kiss. Without Bacchus and
  Ceres, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Venus freezes, but not Massurius!"</p>

  <p>All at once lyres and citharas sounded from the side room, and there
  entered a procession of eight youths in shining silken garments of a
  gold-green colour. Foremost the "dresser" and the "carver." The other six
  bore dishes upon their heads. They passed the guests with measured steps, and
  halted at the sideboard of citron-wood. While they were busy there, castanets
  and cymbals were heard from another part of the house; the large double doors
  turned upon their shining bronze hinges, and a swarm of slaves in the
  becoming costume of Corinthian youths streamed into the room.</p>

  <p>Some handed bread in ornamentally-perforated baskets; others whisked the
  flies away with fans of ostrich feathers and palm-leaves; some gracefully
  poured oil into the wall-lamps from double-handled vases; whilst others swept
  the crumbs from the mosaic pavement with besoms of Egyptian reeds, or helped
  Ganymede to fill the cups, which now were circling merrily.</p>

  <p>The conversation grew more rapid and animated, and Cethegus, who, although
  he remained cool and collected, seemed to be quite lost in the enjoyment of
  the moment, charmed the young guests by his youthful gaiety.</p>

  <p>"What do you say?" asked the host, "shall we play dice between the dishes?
  There stands the dice-box, near Piso."</p>

  <p>"Well, Massurius," observed Cethegus, with a sarcastic look at the
  slave-dealer, "will you try your luck with me once more? Will you bet against
  me? Give him the dice-box, Syphax," he said to the Moor.</p>

  <p>"Mercury forbid!" answered Massurius, with comical fright. "Have nothing
  to do with the Prefect he has inherited the luck of his ancestor, Julius
  Cæsar."</p>

  <p>"Omen accipio!" laughed Cethegus. "I accept the omen, with the dagger of
  Brutus into the bargain."</p>

  <p>"I tell you, he is a magician! Only lately he won an unwinnable bet
  against me about this black demon," and the speaker threw a cactus-fig at the
  slave's face, but Syphax caught it cleverly with his shining white teeth, and
  quietly ate it up.</p>

  <p>"Well done, Syphax!" said Cethegus. "Roses from the thorns of the enemy!
  Thou canst become a conjurer as soon as I let thee free."</p>

  <p>"Syphax does not wish to be free: he will always be your Syphax, and save
  your life as you saved his."</p>

  <p>"What is that&mdash;thy life?" asked Lucius Licinius.</p>

  <p>"Did you pardon him?" asked Marcus.</p>

  <p>"More than that, I bought him off."</p>

  <p>"Yes, with my money!" grumbled Massurius.</p>

  <p>"You know that I immediately gave him the money I won from you as his
  private possession," answered Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"What about this bet? Let us hear. Perhaps it will afford a subject for my
  epigrams," said Piso.</p>

  <p>"Retire, Syphax. There! the cook is bringing us his masterpiece, it
  seems."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-9"
     name="b2-9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a turbot weighing six pounds, which for years had
  been fed with goose-liver in the sea-water fishponds of Kallistratos. The
  much-prized "Rhombus" was served upon a silver dish, with a little golden
  crown on its head.</p>

  <p>"All ye gods, and thou, Prophet Jonah!" stammered Balbus, sinking back
  upon the cushions, "that fish is worth more than I!"</p>

  <p>"Peace, friend," said Piso, "let not Cato hear thee, who said, 'Woe to
  that city where a fish is worth more than an ox.'"</p>

  <p>A burst of laughter, and the loud call of "<i>Euge belle!</i>" drowned the
  angry exclamation of the half-drunken Sicilian.</p>

  <p>The fish was carved, and was found delicious.</p>

  <p>"Now, slaves, away with the weak Massikian. A noble fish must swim in
  noble liquid. Quick, Syphax, the wine which I have contributed to the banquet
  will suit exactly. Go, and let the amphora, which the slaves have set in snow
  outside, be brought in, and with it the cups of yellow amber."</p>

  <p>"What rare thing have you brought&mdash;from what country?" asked
  Kallistratos.</p>

  <p>"Ask this far-travelled Odysseus, from what hemisphere," said Piso.</p>

  <p>"You must guess. And whoever guesses right, or whoever has already tasted
  this wine, shall have an amphora from me as large as this."</p>

  <p>Two slaves, crowned with ivy, dragged in the immense dark-coloured vase;
  it was of brown-black porphyry and of a singular shape, inscribed with
  hieroglyphics and well closed at the neck with plaster.</p>

  <p>"By the Styx! does it come from Tartarus? It is indeed a black fellow!"
  said Marcus, laughing.</p>

  <p>"But it has a white soul&mdash;show, Syphax."</p>

  <p>The Nubian carefully knocked off the plaster with an ebony hammer which
  Ganymede handed to him, took out the stopper of palm-rind with a bronze hook,
  poured away the oil which swam at the top of the wine, and filled the cups. A
  strong and intoxicating odour arose from the white and sticky fluid.</p>

  <p>Every one drank with an air of examination.</p>

  <p>"A drink fit for the gods!" cried Balbus, setting down his cup.</p>

  <p>"But as strong as liquid fire," said Kallistratos.</p>

  <p>"I do not know it," said Lucius Licinius.</p>

  <p>"Nor I," affirmed Marcus Licinius.</p>

  <p>"And I am happy to make its acquaintance," said Piso, and held his empty
  cup to Syphax.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the host, turning to an, until now, almost silent guest at
  his right hand, "well, Furius, valiant sailor, discoverer and adventurer! you
  who have sailed round the world, is <i>your</i> wisdom also at fault?"</p>

  <p>The guest slightly raised himself from the cushions. He was a handsome
  athletic man of about thirty years of age, with a bronzed weather-beaten
  complexion, coal-black, deep-set eyes, dazzling white teeth, and a full
  beard, trimmed in Oriental fashion. But before he could speak Kallistratos
  interposed:</p>

  <p>"By Jupiter Xenios! I believe you do not know each other!"</p>

  <p>Cethegus measured his unknown and attractive companion with a keen
  look.</p>

  <p>"I know the Prefect of Rome," said the silent guest.</p>

  <p>"Well, Cethegus," said Kallistratos, "this is my Vulcanic friend, Furius
  Ahalla, from Corsica, the richest ship-owner of the West; deep as night and
  hot as fire. He possesses fifty houses, villas and palaces on all the coasts
  of Europe, Asia, and Africa; twenty galleys; a few thousand slaves and
  sailors, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And a very talkative friend," concluded the Corsican. "Prefect, I am
  sorry for you, but the amphora is mine. I know the wine." And he took a
  Kibitz-egg and broke the shell with a silver spoon.</p>

  <p>"Hardly," said Cethegus with a sarcastic smile.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless I do know it. It is Isis-wine. From Memphis." And the
  Corsican quietly sipped the golden yolk of his egg.</p>

  <p>Cethegus looked at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Well guessed!" he then said. "Where have you tasted it?"</p>

  <p>"Necessarily in the same place as you. It flows only from one source,"
  said the Corsican, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Enough of your secrets! No riddles under the rose!" cried Piso.</p>

  <p>"Where have you two weasels found the same nest?" asked Kallistratos.</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said Cethegus, "you may as well know it. In Old Egypt, and
  particularly in holy Memphis, there remain near the Christian settlers and
  monks in the deserts, men, and especially women, who still cling to their old
  faith; who will not forsake Apis and Osiris, and cherish faithfully the sweet
  worship of Isis. They fly from the surface, where the Church has victoriously
  planted the cross of the ascetics, to the secret bosom of Mother Earth with
  their holy and beloved religious ceremonies. They still keep, hidden below
  the pyramids of Cheops, a few hundred amphoras of the strong wine which
  intoxicated the initiated at the orgies of joy and love. The secret is kept
  from generation to generation, there is always only one priestess who knows
  the cellar and keeps the key. I kissed the priestess and she let me in. She
  was like a wild cat, but her wine was good; and at parting she gave me five
  amphoras to take on board my ship."</p>

  <p>"I did not get as far as that with Smerda," said the Corsican. "She let me
  drink in the cellar, but at parting she only gave me this." And he bared his
  brown throat.</p>

  <p>"A dagger-stab of jealousy!" laughed Cethegus. "Well, I am glad that the
  daughter has not degenerated. In my time, that is, when the mother let me
  drink, the little Smerda still ran about in baby-frocks. Long live the Nile
  and sweet Isis!" And the two men drank to each other. But yet they were vexed
  that they shared a secret which each believed he had possessed alone.</p>

  <p>The others, however, were charmed by the amiable humour of the icy
  Prefect, who chatted with them as youthfully as the youngest amongst them,
  and who now, when the favourite theme of young men at the wine-cup had been
  introduced&mdash;love adventures and stories of lovely women&mdash;bubbled
  over with anecdotes of jests and tricks, of most of which he had himself been
  witness. Every one stormed him with questions. The Corsican alone remained
  dumb and cold.</p>

  <p>"Say," cried the host, and signed to the cup-bearer just as a burst of
  mirth caused by one of these stories had ceased; "tell us, you man of varied
  experience&mdash;Egyptian Isis-girls, Gallic Druidesses, black-haired
  daughters of Syria, and my plastic sisters of Hellas&mdash;all these you know
  and understand how to value; but tell us, have you ever loved a Germanic
  woman?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Cethegus, "they were always too insipid for me."</p>

  <p>"Oho!" said Kallistratos; "that is saying too much. I tell you, I was mad
  all the last calendars for a German girl; she was not at all insipid."</p>

  <p>"What? you, Kallistratos of Corinth, the countryman of Aspasia and Helena,
  you could burn for a barbarian woman? Oh, wicked Eros, sense-confuser,
  man-shamer!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I acknowledge it was an error of the senses. I have never before
  experienced such."</p>

  <p>"Relate, relate!" cried all the others.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-10"
     name="b2-10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">"With pleasure," said the host, smoothing his cushions;
  "although I play no brilliant part in the story. Well, some time ago I was
  returning home from the baths of Abaskanthus at about the eighth hour. In the
  street I found a woman's litter, accompanied by four slaves, who, I believe,
  were captive Gepidians. And exactly opposite the door of my house stood two
  veiled women, their calanticas thrown over their heads. One wore the garment
  of a slave, but the other was very richly and tastefully dressed; and the
  little that could be seen of her figure was divine. Such a graceful walk,
  such slender ankles, such an arched instep! As I approached they entered the
  litter and were gone. But I&mdash;you know that a sculptor's blood flows in
  the veins of every Greek&mdash;I dreamt all night of the slender ankles and
  the light step. The next day at noon, as I opened the door to go, as usual,
  to the bibliographers in the Forum, I saw the same litter hurrying away. I
  confess&mdash;though I am not usually vain&mdash;I thought that this time I
  had made a conquest; I wished it so much. And I could no longer doubt it,
  when, coming home again at the eighth hour, I saw my strange beauty, this
  time unaccompanied, slip past me and hurry to her litter. I could not follow
  the quick-footed slaves, so I entered my house, full of happy thoughts. The
  ostiarius met me and said:</p>

  <p>"'Sir, a veiled female slave waits in the library.'</p>

  <p>"I hurried to the room with a beating heart. It was really the slave whom
  I had seen yesterday. She threw back her mantle; a handsome coquettish Moor
  or Carthaginian&mdash;I know the sort&mdash;looked at me with sly eyes.</p>

  <p>"'I claim the reward of a messenger, Kallistratos,' she said; 'I bring you
  good news.'</p>

  <p>"I took her hand and would have patted her cheek&mdash;for who desires to
  win the mistress must kiss the slave&mdash;but she laughed and said:</p>

  <p>"'No, not Eros; Hermes sends me. My mistress'&mdash;I listened eagerly.
  'My mistress is&mdash;a passionate lover of art. She offers you three
  thousand solidi for the bust of Ares which stands in the niche at the door of
  your house.'"</p>

  <p>The young guests laughed loudly, Cethegus joining in their merriment.</p>

  <p>"Well, laugh away!" continued the host, smiling; "but I assure you I did
  not laugh. My dreams were dashed to pieces, and I said, greatly vexed, 'I do
  not sell my busts.' The slave offered five thousand, ten thousand solidi. I
  turned my back upon her and opened the door. Then the sly puss said, 'I know
  that Kallistratos is indignant because he expected an adventure, and only
  found a money-affair. He is a Greek, and loves beauty; he burns with
  curiosity to see my mistress.' This was so true, that I could only smile.
  'Well,' she said, 'you shall see her, and then I will renew my last offer.
  Should you still refuse, at least you will have had the advantage of
  satisfying your curiosity. To-morrow, at the eighth hour, the litter will
  come again. Then be ready with your Ares.' And she slipped away. I cannot
  deny that my curiosity was aroused. Quite decided not to give up my Ares, and
  yet to see this beauteous art-enthusiast, I waited impatiently for the
  appointed hour. It came, and with it the litter. I stood watching at my open
  door. The slave descended. 'Come,' she called to me, 'you shall see her.'
  Trembling with excitement, I stepped forward, the curtain fell, and I
  saw&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?" cried Marcus, bending forward, his cup in his hand.</p>

  <p>"What I shall never again forget! a face, friends, of unimagined beauty.
  Cypris and Artemis in one! I was dazzled. But I hurried back, lifted the Ares
  from its niche, gave it to the Punic slave, refused her money, and staggered
  into my house as confused as if I had seen a wood-nymph."</p>

  <p>"Well, that is wonderful," laughed Massurius; "you are else no novice in
  the works of Eros."</p>

  <p>"But," asked Cethegus, "how do you know that your charmer was a Goth?"</p>

  <p>"She had dark-red hair, and a milk-white skin, and black eyebrows."</p>

  <p>"Oh, ye gods!" thought Cethegus. But he was silent and waited. No one
  present uttered the name. "They do not know her.&mdash;And when was this?" he
  asked his host.</p>

  <p>"During the last calendars."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," thought Cethegus. "She came at that time from Tarentum
  through Rome to Ravenna. She rested here for three days."</p>

  <p>"And so," said Piso, laughing, "you gave your Ares for a look at a
  beautiful woman! A bad bargain! This time, Mercury and Venus were allies.
  Poor Kallistratos!"</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Kallistratos, "the bust was not worth so very much. It was
  modern work. Ion of Neapolis made it three years, ago. But I tell you, I
  would give a Phidias for such a look."</p>

  <p>"An ideal head?" asked Cethegus indifferently, and lifted admiringly the
  bronze mixing-vase which stood before him.</p>

  <p>"No; the model was a barbarian&mdash;some Gothic earl or
  other&mdash;Watichis or Witichas&mdash;who can remember these hyperborean
  names," said Kalistratos, as he peeled a peach.</p>

  <p>Cethegus reflectively sipped his wine from the cup of amber.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-11"
     name="b2-11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">"Well, one might put up with the barbarian women," cried
  Marcus Licinius, "but may Orcus devour their brothers!" and he tore the faded
  rose-wreath from his head&mdash;the flowers could ill bear the close air of
  the room&mdash;and replaced it by a fresh one. "Not only have they deprived
  us of liberty&mdash;they even beat us upon the field of love, with the
  daughters of Hesperia. Only lately, the beautiful Lavinia shut the door upon
  my brother, and received the foxy-haired Aligern."</p>

  <p>"Barbaric taste!" observed Lucius, shrugging his shoulders, and taking to
  his Isis-wine, as if to comfort himself. "You know the Goths too, Furius; is
  it not an error of taste?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know your rival," answered the Corsican; "but there are youths
  enough among the Goths who might well be dangerous to a woman. And an
  adventure occurs to me, which I lately discovered, but of which, certainly,
  the point is still wanting."</p>

  <p>"That does not matter; tell it to us," said Kallistratos, putting his
  hands into the luke-warm water, which was now handed round in Corinthian
  bronze vessels; "perhaps we can find the point."</p>

  <p>"The hero of my story," began Furius, "is the handsomest of all the
  Goths."</p>

  <p>"Ah, the young Totila," interrupted Piso, and gave his cameo-decorated cup
  to be filled with iced wine.</p>

  <p>"The same. I have known him for years, and like him exceedingly, as all
  must who have ever looked into his sunny face; not to speak of the
  fact"&mdash;and here the shadow of some grave remembrance flitted across the
  Corsican's face, as he hesitated&mdash;"that I am under an obligation to
  him."</p>

  <p>"It seems that you are in love with the fair-haired youth," said Massurius
  sarcastically, and throwing to the slave he had brought with him a kerchief
  full of Picentinian biscuits, to take home with him.</p>

  <p>"No; but he has been very friendly to me, as he is to every one with whom
  he comes into contact; and very often he had the harbour-watch in the Italian
  ports where I landed."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he has rendered great services to the Gothic navy," said Lucius
  Licinius.</p>

  <p>"As well as to their cavalry," concurred Marcus. "The slender youth is the
  best rider in his nation."</p>

  <p>"Well, I met him last in Neapolis. We were well-pleased to meet, but it
  was in vain that I pressed him to share our merry suppers on board my
  ship."</p>

  <p>"Oh, those suppers are both celebrated and ill-famed," observed Balbus;
  "you have always the most fiery wines."</p>

  <p>"And the most fiery girls," added Massurius.</p>

  <p>"However that may be, Totila always pleaded business, and was not to be
  persuaded. Imagine that! business after the eighth hour in Neapolis, when the
  most industrious are lazy! Naturally, it was only an excuse. I promised
  myself to find out his pranks, and, at evening, loitered near his house in
  the Via Lata. And truly, the very first evening he came out, looking
  carefully about him, and, to my surprise, in disguise. He was dressed like a
  gardener, with a travelling-cap well drawn down over his face, and a cloak
  folded closely about him. I dogged his footsteps. He went straight through
  the town to the Porta Capuana. Close to the gate stands a large tower,
  inhabited by the gate-keeper, an old patriarchal Jew, whom King Theodoric, on
  account of his great fidelity, entrusted with the office of warder. My Goth
  stood still before the house, and gently clapped his hands. A little
  side-door, which I had not remarked before, opened noiselessly, and Totila
  slipped in like an eel."</p>

  <p>"Ho, ho!" interrupted Piso eagerly, "I know both the Jew and his child
  Miriam&mdash;a splendid large-eyed girl! The most beautiful daughter of
  Israel, the pearl of the East! Her lips are red as pomegranates, her eyes are
  deep sea-blue, her cheeks have the rosy bloom of the peach."</p>

  <p>"Well done, Piso," said Cethegus, smiling; "your poem is very
  beautiful."</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, "Miriam herself is living poetry."</p>

  <p>"The Jewess is proud," grumbled Massurius, "she scorned my gold with a
  look as if no one had ever bought a woman before."</p>

  <p>"So the haughty Goth," said Lucius Licinius, "who walks with an air as if
  he earned all heaven's stars upon his curly head, has condescended to a
  Jewess."</p>

  <p>"So I thought, and I determined, at the next opportunity, to laugh at the
  youth for his predilection for musk. But nothing of the sort! A few days
  later, I was obliged to go to Capua. I started before daybreak to avoid the
  heat. I drove out of the town through the Porta Capuana, just as it was
  dawning, and as I rattled over the hard stones before the Jews' tower, I
  thought with envy of Totila, and said to myself that he was then lying in the
  embrace of two white arms. But at the second milestone from the gate, walking
  towards the town, with two empty flower-baskets hanging over his breast and
  back, dressed in a gardener's costume, just as before, whom should I meet but
  Totila! Therefore he was not lying in Miriam's arms; the Jewess was not his
  sweetheart, but perhaps his confidante; and who knows where the flower that
  this gardener cherishes blooms? The lucky fellow! Only consider that on the
  Via Capuana stand all the villas and pleasure-houses of the first families of
  Neapolis, and that in these gardens flourish and bloom the loveliest of
  women."</p>

  <p>"By my genius!" cried Lucius Licinius, lifting his wreathed goblet, "in
  that region live the most beautiful women of Italia&mdash;cursed be the
  Goths!"</p>

  <p>"No," shouted Massurius, glowing with wine, "cursed be Kallistratos and
  the Corsican! who offer us strange love-stories, as the stork offered the fox
  food from narrow-necked flasks. Now, O mine host, let your girls in, if you
  have ordered any. You need not excite our expectation any further."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes! the girls! the dancers! the players!" cried the young guests
  all together.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" said the host. "When Aphrodite comes, she must tread upon flowers.
  This glass I dedicate to thee, Flora!"</p>

  <p>He sprang up, and dashed a costly crystal cup against the tabled ceiling,
  so that it broke with a loud ring. As soon as the glass struck the ceiling,
  the whole of it opened like a trap-door, and a thick rain of flowers of all
  kinds fell upon the heads of the astonished guests; roses from Pæstum,
  violets from Thurii, myrtles from Tarentum; covering with scented bunches the
  tesselated floor, the tables, the cushions, and the heads of the
  drinkers.</p>

  <p>"Never," cried Cethegus, "did Venus descend more beautifully upon
  Paphos!"</p>

  <p>Kallistratos clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>To the sound of lyre and flute the centre wall of the room, directly
  opposite the triclinium, parted; four short-robed female dancers, chosen for
  their beauty, in Persian costume, that is, dressed in transparent
  rose-coloured gauze, sprang, clashing their cymbals, from behind a bush of
  blooming oleander.</p>

  <p>Behind them came a large carriage in the form of a fan-shaped shell, with
  golden wheels, pushed by eight young female slaves. Four girls, playing on
  the flute, and dressed in Lydian garments&mdash;purple and white with
  gold-embroidered mantles&mdash;walked before, and upon the seat of the
  carriage rested, in a half-lying position, and covered with roses, Aphrodite
  herself; a blooming girl of enchanting, voluptuous beauty, whose almost only
  garment was an imitation of Aphrodite's girdle of the Graces.</p>

  <p>"Ha, by Eros and Anteros!" cried Massurius, and sprang down from the
  triclinium with an unsteady step amidst the group.</p>

  <p>"Let us draw lots for the girls," said Piso; "I have new dice made from
  the bones of the gazelle. Let us inaugurate them."</p>

  <p>"Let our festal King decide," proposed Marcus.</p>

  <p>"No, freedom! freedom at least in love!" cried Massurius, and roughly
  caught the goddess by the arm; "and music. Hey there! Music!"</p>

  <p>"Music!" ordered Kallistratos.</p>

  <p>But before the cymbal-players could begin, the entrance-doors were hastily
  thrown open, and pushing the slaves who tried to stop him aside, Scævola
  rushed in. He was deadly pale.</p>

  <p>"You here! I really find you here, Cethegus! at this moment!" he
  cried.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked the Prefect, quietly taking the wreath of roses
  off his head.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter!" repeated Scævola. "The fatherland trembles between
  Scylla and Charybdis! The Gothic Dukes, Thulun, Ibba, and
  Pitza&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Lucius Licinius.</p>

  <p>"Are murdered!"</p>

  <p>"Triumph!" shouted the young Roman, and let loose the dancer whom he held
  in his arms.</p>

  <p>"A fine triumph!" said the jurist angrily. "When the news reached Ravenna,
  the mob accused the Queen; they stormed the palace&mdash;but Amalaswintha had
  escaped."</p>

  <p>"Whither?" asked Cethegus, starting up.</p>

  <p>"Whither! Upon a Grecian ship&mdash;to Byzantium."</p>

  <p>Cethegus frowned and silently set down his cup.</p>

  <p>"But the worst is that the Goths mean to dethrone her, and choose a
  King."</p>

  <p>"A King?" said Cethegus. "Well, I will call the Senate together. The
  Romans, too, shall choose."</p>

  <p>"Whom? what shall we choose?" asked Scævola.</p>

  <p>But Cethegus was not obliged to answer.</p>

  <p>Before he could speak Lucius shouted:</p>

  <p>"A Dictator! Away, away to the Senate!"</p>

  <p>"To the Senate!" repeated Cethegus majestically. "Syphax, my mantle!"</p>

  <p>"Here, master, and the sword as well," whispered the Moor. "I always bring
  it with me, in case of need."</p>

  <p>And host and guests, staggering, followed Cethegus, who, the only
  completely sober man amongst them, was the first out of the house and into
  the street.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-12"
     name="b2-12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">In one of the small rooms of the Emperor's palace in
  Byzantium, a short time after the Feast of the Floralia, a little man of
  insignificant appearance was pacing to and fro, lost in anxious thought.</p>

  <p>The room was quiet and lonely. Although outside it was broad daylight, the
  bay-window, which looked into the court of the extensive edifice, was thickly
  hung with heavy curtains of gold-brocade. Equally costly stuffs covered the
  mosaic floor, so that no noise accompanied the footsteps of the solitary
  inmate.</p>

  <p>A softened light filled the room. Relieved against the golden background
  of the walls, stood a row of small white busts of the Christian Emperors
  since Constantine. Exactly over a writing divan, hung a large cross of
  massive gold. Whenever the little man passed this, he bent before it; for in
  the middle of the gold, and covered with glass, a splinter of wood was
  enclosed, said to be a piece of the true Cross. At last he stopped before a
  map, which, representing the <i>orbis Romanus</i>, and traced upon a
  parchment with a purple border, covered one of the walls.</p>

  <p>After a long and searching look, he sighed and covered his eyes with his
  hands. They were not beautiful, nor was his face noble; but his features were
  exceedingly suggestive both of good and evil. Mistrust, cunning and vigilance
  lay in the restless glance of his deep-set eyes; deep wrinkles, more the
  result of care than of age, furrowed his projecting forehead and hollow
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Who can foresee the result?" he exclaimed, sighing again, and rubbing his
  long and bony hands. "I am unceasingly impelled to do it. A spirit has
  entered my bosom, and it warns me repeatedly. But is it an angel of the Lord
  or a demon? Who can interpret my dream? Forgive, Thou Triune God, forgive Thy
  most zealous servant! Thou hast cursed him who interprets dreams. And yet
  Joseph interpreted the dreams of King Pharaoh, and Jacob saw the heavens
  open; and their dreams were from Thee. Shall I, dare I venture?"</p>

  <p>Again he walked to and fro; and who knows how long he would have continued
  to do so, had not the purple curtains of the doorway been gently drawn aside.
  A slave, glittering with gold, threw himself on the ground before the little
  man, with his arms crossed on his breast.</p>

  <p>"Emperor, the patricians whom you summoned have arrived.</p>

  <p>"Patience!" said the Emperor to himself, and seated himself upon a couch,
  of which the supports were made of gold and ivory. "Quick with the shoes and
  the chlamys!"</p>

  <p>The slave drew a pair of sandals with thick soles and high heels upon the
  Emperor's feet, which added some inches to his height, and threw over his
  shoulders a rich mantle worked all over with stars of gold, kissing each
  article as he touched it. After a repetition of the humble prostration, which
  had lately been introduced at Byzantium in this aggravated form of Oriental
  submission, the slave withdrew.</p>

  <p>Emperor Justinian placed himself opposite the entrance in the attitude in
  which he was accustomed to give audience, resting his left arm upon a broken
  porphyry column from the Temple of Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>The curtain at the entrance was again parted, and three men entered, with
  the same salutation as the slave; and yet they were the first men of the
  empire, as was shown by their characteristic heads and intellectual features,
  still more than by their richly-decorated garments.</p>

  <p>"We have summoned you," began the Emperor, without noticing their humble
  greeting, "to hear your advice concerning Italy. You have had all necessary
  information&mdash;the letters of the Queen-regent, and the documents of the
  patriotic party. You have also had three days to reflect. Speak first,
  Magister Militum."</p>

  <p>And he turned to the tallest of the three, a man of stately and heroic
  figure, clad in a full suit of richly-gilded armour. His well-opened,
  light-brown eyes were frank and confident; his large, straight nose and full
  cheeks gave his face an expression of health and strength. There was
  something Herculean about his broad chest and powerful thighs and arms; but
  his mouth, in spite of the fierce beard, was mild and good-humoured.</p>

  <p>"Sire," he said, in a full, deep-chested voice, "the advice of Belisarius
  is always, 'Attack the enemy!' At your command, I lately destroyed the
  Kingdom of the Vandals, in Africa, with fifteen thousand men. Give me thirty
  thousand, and I will lay the Gothic crown at your feet."</p>

  <p>"'Tis well," said the Emperor approvingly. "Your words have done me good.
  What say you, Tribonianus, pearl of jurists?"</p>

  <p>The jurist was little shorter than Belisarius, but not so broad-shouldered
  and stout-limbed. His high, grave forehead, quiet eyes, and expressive mouth,
  bore witness to a powerful mind.</p>

  <p>"Emperor," said he firmly, "I warn you against this war. It is
  unjust."</p>

  <p>Justinian started up indignantly.</p>

  <p>"Unjust!&mdash;to recover that which belongs to the Roman Empire!"</p>

  <p>"Which <i>did</i> belong. Your predecessor, Zeno, ceded the West to
  Theodoric and his Goths when they had overthrown the usurper Odoacer."</p>

  <p>"Theodoric was to be the Viceregent of the Emperor, not the King of
  Italy."</p>

  <p>"Admitted. But after he had become King&mdash;as he could not fail to do,
  for a Theodoric could never be the servant of another&mdash;the Emperor
  Anastasius, your uncle Justinus, and, later, you yourself, acknowledged him
  and his kingdom."</p>

  <p>"That was under the pressure of necessity. Now that they are in need, and
  I the stronger, I revoke that acknowledgment."</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I call unjust."</p>

  <p>"You are blunt and disagreeable, Tribonianus, and a tough disputant. You
  are excellently fitted to compile my pandects. I will never again ask your
  advice in politics. What has justice to do with politics?"</p>

  <p>"Justice, Justinianus, is the best policy."</p>

  <p>"Bah! Alexander and Cæsar thought differently."</p>

  <p>"But, first, they never completed their work; and,
  secondly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped.</p>

  <p>"Well, secondly?"</p>

  <p>"Secondly, you are not Cæsar, nor are you Alexander."</p>

  <p>All were silent. After a pause, the Emperor said quietly:</p>

  <p>"You are very frank, Tribonianus."</p>

  <p>"Always, Justinianus."</p>

  <p>The Emperor quickly turned to the third of his advisers:</p>

  <p>"Well, what is your opinion, Narses?"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-13"
     name="b2-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">Narses was a stunted little man, considerably shorter than
  Justinian, for which reason the latter stooped, when speaking with him, much
  more than was necessary. He was bald, his complexion a sickly yellow, his
  right shoulder higher than his left, and he limped a little on the left foot,
  supporting himself upon a stick with a golden crutch. But his eagle eye was
  so commanding, that it annulled any disagreeable impression made by his
  insignificant figure, and lent to his plain countenance the consecration of
  intellectual greatness, while the expression of painful resignation and cool
  superiority about his mouth had even a singular charm. When addressed by the
  Emperor, Narses quickly banished from his lips a cold smile, which had been
  excited by the jurist's moral politics, and raised his head.</p>

  <p>"Emperor," he said, in a sharp, decided voice, "I would dissuade you from
  this war&mdash;for the present."</p>

  <p>The Emperor bit his lips in vexation.</p>

  <p>"Also from reasons of justice?" he asked, almost sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"I said: for the present."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because what is necessary precedes what is pleasant. He who has to defend
  his own house should not break into strange dwellings."</p>

  <p>"What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means, that no danger threatens your empire from the West, from the
  Goths. The enemy who can, and perhaps will, destroy it, comes from the
  East."</p>

  <p>"The Persians!" cried Justinian contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Since when," interposed Belisarius, "since when does Narses, my great
  rival, fear the Persians?"</p>

  <p>"Narses fears no one," answered the latter, without looking at his
  interrogator, "neither the Persians whom he has beaten, nor you whom the
  Persians have beaten. But he knows the Orient. If not the Persians, then it
  will be others who follow them. The tempest which threatens Byzantium
  approaches from the Tigris, not from the Tiber."</p>

  <p>"Well, and what does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means, that it is a shameful thing for you, O Emperor, and for the
  Roman name which we still bear, that you should, year by year, buy peace from
  Chosroes, the Persian Khan, at the cost of many hundredweights of gold."</p>

  <p>The Emperor's face flushed scarlet.</p>

  <p>"How can you put such a meaning upon gifts, subsidies?"</p>

  <p>"Gifts! If they are not forthcoming but a week after the day of payment,
  Chosroes, the son of Cabades, burns your villages! Subsidies! With them he
  pays Huns and Saracens, the most dangerous enemies of your frontiers!"</p>

  <p>Justinian walked rapidly through the room.</p>

  <p>"What do you then advise?" he said at last, stopping short before
  Narses.</p>

  <p>"Not to attack the Goths without necessity or reason, when we can scarcely
  defend ourselves from the Persians. To put forth the whole power of your
  empire in order to abolish this shameful tribute; to prevent the depredations
  on your frontiers; to rebuild the burnt towns of Antiochia, Dara, and Edessa;
  to win back the provinces which you lost, in spite of the valiant sword of
  Belisarius; and to protect your frontiers by a seven-fold girdle of
  fortresses from the Euphrates to the Araxes. And when you have completed this
  necessary work&mdash;and I fear much you cannot complete it&mdash;then you
  may follow where Fame leads."</p>

  <p>Justinianus slightly shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You are displeasing to me, Narses," he said bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I knew that long ago," Narses answered quietly.</p>

  <p>"And not indispensable," cried Belisarius proudly. "Do not listen, my
  great Emperor, to this small doubter. Give me the thirty thousand, and I
  wager my right hand that I will conquer Italy for you."</p>

  <p>"And I wager my head, which is more," said Narses, "that Belisarius will
  conquer Italy neither with thirty, nor with sixty, nor with a hundred
  thousand men.",</p>

  <p>"Well," asked Justinianus, "and who can do it, and with what forces?"</p>

  <p>"I," said Narses, "with eighty thousand."</p>

  <p>Belisarius grew red with anger; he was silent for want of words.</p>

  <p>"You have never yet, with all your self-esteem, Narses," said the jurist,
  "vaunted yourself thus highly above your rival."</p>

  <p>"I do not now, Tribonianus. See, the difference is this: Belisarius is a
  great hero, and I am not; but I am a great general, and Belisarius is not,
  and none but a great general can conquer the Goths."</p>

  <p>Belisarius drew himself up to his full height, and angrily grasped his
  sword. He looked as if he would have gladly crushed the cripple near him.</p>

  <p>The Emperor defended him. "Belisarius no great general! Envy blinds you,
  Narses."</p>

  <p>"I envy Belisarius nothing, not even," answered Narses, slightly sighing,
  "his health. He would be a great general if he were not so great a hero.
  Every battle which he has lost, he has lost through too great heroism."</p>

  <p>"That can not be said of you, Narses," retorted Belisarius.</p>

  <p>"No, Belisarius, for I have never yet lost a battle."</p>

  <p>An angry retort from Belisarius was cut short by the entrance of a slave,
  who, lifting the curtain, announced:</p>

  <p>"Alexandros, sire, who was sent to Ravenna, has landed an hour ago, and
  asks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bring him in! Here!" cried the Emperor, hastily starting from his seat.
  He impatiently signed to the ambassador, who entered at once, to rise from
  his obeisance.</p>

  <p>"Well, Alexandros, you came back alone?"</p>

  <p>The ambassador&mdash;a handsome and still young man&mdash;repeated:
  "Alone."</p>

  <p>"But your last report said&mdash;In what condition have you left the
  Gothic kingdom?"</p>

  <p>"In great confusion. I wrote in my last report that the Queen had decided
  to rid herself of her three most haughty enemies. Should the attempt fail,
  she would be no longer safe in Italy, and she begged to be allowed, in that
  case, to go in my ship to Epidamnus, and from thence to escape to
  Byzantium."</p>

  <p>"And I accepted the proposal readily. Well, and the attempt?"</p>

  <p>"Succeeded. The three dukes are no more. But the rumour had reached
  Ravenna that the most dangerous of them, Duke Thulun, was only wounded. This
  induced the Queen&mdash;as, besides, the Goths threateningly surrounded the
  palace&mdash;to escape to my ship. We weighed anchor, but soon after we had
  left the harbour, off Ariminum, Earl Witichis overtook us with superior
  numbers, boarded us, and demanded that Amalaswintha should return,
  guaranteeing her safety until a solemn examination had taken place before the
  National Assembly. When she learnt from him that Duke Thulun had succumbed to
  his wounds, and saw from the proposal of Witichis that he and his powerful
  friends did not yet believe in her guilt, and as, besides, she apprehended
  compulsion, she consented to return with him to Ravenna. But first, on board
  the <i>Sophia</i>, she wrote this letter to you, and sends you this present
  from her treasury."</p>

  <p>"Of that later. Tell me further, how do things, stand now in Italy?"</p>

  <p>"Well for you, O great Emperor! An exaggerated account of the rebellion of
  the Goths at Ravenna and of the flight of the Queen to Byzantium, has flown
  through the whole country. Already many encounters have taken place between
  Romans and barbarians. In Rome itself the patriots wished to strike a blow at
  once; to choose a Dictator in the Senate, and call for your assistance. But
  this step would have been premature, for the Queen was in the hands of the
  Goths, and only the firmness of the clever man who heads the conspiracy of
  the Catacombs prevented it."</p>

  <p>"The Prefect of Rome?" asked Justinian.</p>

  <p>"Cethegus. He mistrusted the reports. The conspirators wished to surprise
  the Goths, proclaim you Emperor of the West, and choose him, meanwhile, for
  Dictator. But he literally allowed them to put the dagger to his throat in
  the Curia, and said, No."</p>

  <p>"A courageous man!" said Belisarius.</p>

  <p>"A dangerous man!" said Narses.</p>

  <p>"An hour after," continued the ambassador, "news, arrived of
  Amalaswintha's return, and things remained as they were. That gloomy warrior,
  Teja, had sworn to render Rome a pasture for cattle, if a drop of Gothic
  blood were shed. I learned all this on my intentionally slow coast voyage to
  Brundusium. But I have something still better to announce. I have found
  zealous friends of Byzantium, not only among the Romans, but also among the
  Goths, and even in the members of the Royal Family."</p>

  <p>"Whom mean you?"</p>

  <p>"In Tuscany there lives a rich proprietor, Prince Theodahad, the cousin of
  Amalaswintha."</p>

  <p>"To be sure! he is the last male of the Amelung family, is he not?"</p>

  <p>"The last. He and, still more, Gothelindis, his clever but wicked wife,
  the proud daughter of the Balthe, mortally hate the Queen. He, because she
  opposed the measureless avarice with which he sought to appropriate the
  property of all his neighbours; she, from reasons which I could not discover,
  but which, I believe, originated during the girlhood of the two Princesses;
  enough, her hate is deadly. Now, these two have promised me to help you in
  every possible way to win Italy back. She will be satisfied, it seems, with
  the destruction of the object of her hatred; he, however, demands a rich
  reward."</p>

  <p>"He shall have it."</p>

  <p>"His support is important, for he already possesses half Tuscany&mdash;the
  noble family of the Wölfungs owns the other half&mdash;and can easily bring
  it into our power; and also because he expects, if Amalaswintha falls, to
  seat himself upon her throne. Here are letters from him and Gothelindis. But,
  first of all, read the writing from the Queen&mdash;&mdash; I believe it is
  very important."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-14"
     name="b2-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">The Emperor opened the tablets, and read:</p>

  <p>"To Justinian, Emperor of the Romans, Amalaswintha, Queen of the Goths and
  the Italians."</p>

  <p>"Queen of the Italians!" laughed Justinian; "what an insane title!"</p>

  <p>"From Alexandros you will learn how Eris and Ate haunt this land. I am
  like a lonely palm-tree which is tossed by opposing winds. Each day increases
  the barbarians' enmity to me, and daily I become more estranged from them;
  and the Romans, however much I try to conciliate them, can never forget that
  I am of Germanic origin. Till now I have defied all danger with a firm
  spirit; but I can do so no longer, if my palace and my person are not in
  security. I cannot rely upon any party in this country. Therefore I appeal to
  you, as my royal brother. It is the dignity of all rulers, and the peace of
  Italy, which you will protect. Send me, I beseech you, a trustworthy troop, a
  life-guard"&mdash;the Emperor cast a significant look at Belisarius&mdash;"a
  troop of some thousand men, with a leader who will be unconditionally devoted
  to me. They shall occupy the palace; it is a fortress in itself. As to Rome,
  these troops must, above all things, keep from me the Prefect Cethegus, who
  is as full of duplicity as he is powerful, and who deserted me in the danger
  into which he himself had led me. If necessary, they must ruin him. When I
  have overthrown my enemies, and secured my kingdom, as I trust in Heaven and
  my own strength that I shall, I will send back troops and leader richly laden
  with gifts, and still more with warm thanks.&mdash;<i>Vale</i>."</p>

  <p>Justinian clasped the wax-tablets tightly in his hand; his eyes shone; his
  plain features were ennobled by an expression of high intellectual power; and
  the present moment showed, that together with many weaknesses and
  littlenesses, he possessed strength and greatness: the greatness of
  diplomatic genius.</p>

  <p>"In this letter," he cried at last, with sparkling eyes, "I hold Italy and
  the Gothic kingdom!"</p>

  <p>And, much agitated, he paced the room with long strides, even forgetting
  to bow before the Cross.</p>

  <p>"A life-guard! that she shall have! But not a few thousand men; many
  thousands&mdash;more than she will like; and you, Belisarias, shall lead
  them."</p>

  <p>"Deign to look at the presents," said Alexandros, pointing to a costly
  shrine of cypress-wood, inlaid with gold, which a slave had set down behind
  him. "Here is the key."</p>

  <p>And he held out a little box of tortoise-shell, which was closed with the
  Queen's seal.</p>

  <p>"Her picture is there too," he said, raising his voice as if by
  accident.</p>

  <p>At the moment in which Alexandros raised his voice, the head of a woman
  was protruded gently and unnoticed through the curtain, and two sparkling
  black eyes looked keenly at the Emperor.</p>

  <p>Justinian opened the shrine, quickly pushed aside its costly contents, and
  hastily caught up a simple tablet of polished box-wood, with a small golden
  frame.</p>

  <p>A cry of astonishment involuntarily burst from his lips, his eyes
  sparkled, and he showed the picture to Belisarius.</p>

  <p>"A splendid woman! What majesty on her brow! One sees that she is a born
  ruler&mdash;a king's daughter!" and he gazed admiringly at the noble
  features.</p>

  <p>The curtain rustled, and the listener entered.</p>

  <p>It was Theodora, the Empress. A seductive apparition.</p>

  <p>All the arts of woman's inventive genius in a time of refined luxury, and
  all the means of an empire, were daily called into requisition, in order to
  keep the beauty of this woman&mdash;who had impaired it only too much by a
  life of unbridled sensuality&mdash;fresh and dazzling. Gold-dust gave to her
  blue-black hair a metallic brilliancy; it was carefully combed up from the
  nape of her neck, in order to show the beautiful shape of her head, and its
  fine set upon her shoulders. Her eyebrows and eye-lashes were dyed black with
  Arabian antimony; and so carefully was the red of her lips put on, that even
  Justinian, who kissed those lips, never suspected an aid to Nature by means
  of Phoenician scarlet. Every tiny hair on her alabaster arm had been
  carefully destroyed: and the delicate rose-colour of her finger-nails was the
  daily care of a specially-appointed slave.</p>

  <p>And yet, without all these arts, Theodora, who was not yet forty years of
  age, would have passed for an extremely lovely woman. Her countenance was
  certainly not noble; no noble, or even proud spirit, spoke from her fatigued
  and weirdly shining eyes; round her lips played an habitual smile, the
  dimples of which indicated the place of the first future wrinkle; and her
  cheeks, beneath the eyes, showed traces of exhaustion.</p>

  <p>But as she now gracefully moved towards the Emperor, delicately holding up
  the heavy folds of her dark-yellow silk robes with her left hand, her whole
  appearance produced a bewitching charm, similar to the sweet and soothing
  scent of Indian balsam which she shed around her.</p>

  <p>"What pleases my imperial lord so much? May I share his delight?" she
  asked in a sweet and flattering voice.</p>

  <p>Those present prostrated themselves before the Empress, scarcely less
  humbly than before the Emperor.</p>

  <p>Justinian started upon seeing her, as if he had been caught in some
  culpable act, and tried to conceal the portrait in the folds of his chlamys.
  But it was too late. The Empress had already fixed her quick eyes upon
  it.</p>

  <p>"We are admiring," said the Emperor, "the&mdash;the fine chasing of the
  gold frame."</p>

  <p>And, blushing, he gave her the portrait.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Theodora, smiling, "there is not much to admire in the frame.
  But the picture is not bad. It is surely the Gothic Queen?"</p>

  <p>The ambassador bowed assent.</p>

  <p>"Not bad, as I said before; but barbaric, severe, unwomanly. How old may
  she be, Alexandros?"</p>

  <p>"About forty-five."</p>

  <p>Justinian looked at the picture and then at the ambassador.</p>

  <p>"The picture was taken fifteen years ago," said Alexandros, as if in.
  explanation.</p>

  <p>"No," said the Emperor, "you mistake; here stands the date, according to
  the indiction[5] and the consul, and the date of her accession; it is of this
  year."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[5. An epocha of the Roman calendar instituted by
  Constantine the Great.]</p>

  <p>An awkward pause ensued.</p>

  <p>"Well," stammered Alexandros, "then the artists flatter
  like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Like courtiers," concluded the Emperor.</p>

  <p>But Theodora came to the ambassador's aid.</p>

  <p>"Why do we chatter about portraits and the age of strange women, when we
  should think only of the empire? What news brings Alexandras? Are you
  decided, Justinianus?"</p>

  <p>"Almost. I only wished to hear your opinion, and, I know, you are in
  favour of war."</p>

  <p>Narses quietly interposed. "Wherefore, sire, did you not at once tell us
  that the Empress was in favour of war? We could have spared our words."</p>

  <p>"What! would you insinuate that I am the slave of my wife?"</p>

  <p>"Guard your tongue better," said Theodora angrily. "Many who seemed
  invulnerable, have been stung by their own sharp tongues."</p>

  <p>"You are very imprudent, Narses," said Justinian.</p>

  <p>"Emperor," he answered, "I have long since ceased to be prudent. We live
  in a time, in a realm, and at a court, where, for any word that we speak or
  leave unspoken, we may fall into disgrace and be ruined. As any word of mine
  may cause my death, I will at least die for words that please me."</p>

  <p>The Emperor smiled.</p>

  <p>"You must confess, patrician, that I can bear a great deal of
  plain-speaking."</p>

  <p>"You are by nature great, O Justinianus, and a magnanimous ruler; else
  Narses would not serve you. But Omphale rendered even Hercules small."</p>

  <p>The eyes of the Empress shone with hatred.</p>

  <p>Justinianus became uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Go," he said, "I will consult with the Empress alone. To-morrow you shall
  hear my decision."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-15"
     name="b2-15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">No sooner were they gone, than Justinian went up to his
  wife, and pressed a kiss upon her white forehead.</p>

  <p>"Forgive him," he said, "he means well."</p>

  <p>"I know it," she answered, returning the kiss. "It is for this reason, and
  because he is indispensable as a foil to Belisarius, that he still
  lives."</p>

  <p>"You are right, as always," cried Justinian, putting his arm round her,
  and thus walking with her up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"What does he intend to do?" thought Theodora; "this tenderness indicates
  a bad conscience."</p>

  <p>"You are right," he repeated, "God has denied me the spirit which decides
  the fate of battles, and, in compensation, has given me these two men of
  victory&mdash;-<i>fortunately</i> two of them. Their jealousy of each other
  secures my dominion better than their fidelity. Either of these generals
  alone would be a continual danger to the state, and on the day that they
  become friends, my throne will shake. You continue to excite their mutual
  dislike?"</p>

  <p>"It is easy to excite. There is as natural an antipathy between them as
  between fire and water. And every spiteful remark of the eunuch I tell with
  indignation to my friend Antonina, the wife and mistress of the hero
  Belisarius."</p>

  <p>"And I repeat every rudeness of this hero to the irritable cripple. But to
  our consultation. Since receiving the report of Alexandros, I am almost
  decided upon the expedition to Italy."</p>

  <p>"Whom will you send?"</p>

  <p>"Belisarius, of course. He promises to accomplish with thirty thousand,
  that which Narses will scarcely undertake with eighty thousand."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that so small a force will be sufficient?"</p>

  <p>"No. But the honour of Belisarius is engaged. He will exert his utmost
  strength, and yet will not quite succeed."</p>

  <p>"That will be wholesome for him. For, since the war with the Vandals, his
  pride has become insupportable."</p>

  <p>"But," continued the Emperor, "he will accomplish three-fourths of the
  work. Then I will recall him, march myself with sixty thousand, taking Narses
  with me, and easily finish the remaining fourth of the task. Then I, too,
  shall be called a great general and a conqueror."</p>

  <p>"Finely thought out!" cried Theodora, with sincere admiration of his
  subtlety: "your plan is ripe."</p>

  <p>"However," said Justinian, sighing and stopping in his walk, "Narses is
  right; I must confess it. It would be better for my empire if I defended it
  from the Persians, instead of attacking the Goths. It would be wiser and
  safer policy. For, at some time or other, destruction will come from the
  East."</p>

  <p>"Let it come! It may not be for centuries, when the only thing remembered
  of Justinianus will be the fame of having reconquered Italy as well as
  Africa. Is it your office to take thought for the future? Those who come
  after you may care for their present; let yours be your only care."</p>

  <p>"But if it should then be said: had Justinian defended his kingdom instead
  of making conquests, it would now be better? If they say: Justinian's
  victories have destroyed the empire?"</p>

  <p>"No one will speak thus. Mankind is dazzled by the glory of Fame. And yet
  another thing&mdash;" and now the earnestness of deep conviction chased the
  expression of cunning persuasiveness from the seductive features of the
  Empress.</p>

  <p>"I suspect what you are about to say; but continue."</p>

  <p>"You are not only an Emperor, you are a man. Your salvation must be dearer
  to you than even your kingdom. Many a bloody step was taken upon the path,
  upon <i>our</i> path&mdash;which led to the height to which we have attained,
  to the glory of our empire. Many harsh deeds were necessary; life and
  treasures, and many a dangerous foe were&mdash;enough! It is true that, with
  part of these treasures, we are building a temple to the glory of Christ,
  which alone will make our name immortal upon earth. But for Heaven&mdash;who
  knows if that be sufficient! Let us"&mdash;and her eyes glowed with fanatic
  fire&mdash;"let us destroy the unbelievers, and seek the path to grace and
  pardon over the bodies of the enemies of Christ!"</p>

  <p>Justinian pressed her hand.</p>

  <p>"The Persians, too, are the enemies of Christ; they are even
  heathens."</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten the teaching of the Prophet: 'heretics are seven times
  worse than heathens?' The true faith has been revealed to them and they have
  despised it. That is the sin against the Holy Ghost, which will never be
  forgiven on earth or in heaven. But you are the sword which shall destroy
  these God-forsaken Arians! They are the most hated enemies of Christ; they
  know Him, and still deny that He is God. Already you have overthrown the
  heretic Vandals in Africa, and smothered error in blood and fire. Now Italy
  calls upon you; Rome, the place where the blood of the prince of Apostles was
  shed, the holy city, must no longer be subject to the heretics. Justinian,
  recall her to the true faith!"</p>

  <p>She ceased.</p>

  <p>The Emperor looked up at the golden cross and sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>"You unveil the inmost depths of my heart. It is this feeling which,
  mightier still than love of fame and victory, urges me to this war. But am I
  capable, am I worthy of achieving such a holy work to the honour of God? Will
  He consummate such a great deed by my sinful hand? I doubt; I waver. Was the
  dream which came to me last night sent from Heaven? What was its meaning? did
  it incite to the attempt or warn me off? Well, your mother, Komito, the
  prophetess of Cyprus, had great wisdom in interpreting dreams and
  warnings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you know that the gift is inherited. Did I not foretell the result of
  the war with the Vandals from your dreams?"</p>

  <p>"Then you shall also explain this last dream to me. You know that I waver
  in my best plans, if an omen speaks against them. Listen then. But"&mdash;and
  he cast an uneasy glance at his wife&mdash;"but remember that it was but a
  <i>dream</i>, and no man can answer for his dreams."</p>

  <p>"Certainly; God sends them.&mdash;What shall I hear?" she added to
  herself.</p>

  <p>"Last night I fell asleep while meditating over the last reports about
  Amala&mdash;about Italy. I dreamed that I was wandering in a landscape with
  seven hills. Under a laurel-tree there reposed the most beautiful woman I had
  ever seen. I stood before her and looked at her with delight. Suddenly there
  rushed out of a thicket at my right hand a growling bear, and, from the rocks
  to the left, a hissing snake, and darted at the sleeping woman. She woke and
  called my name. I quickly caught her up, and, pressing her to my bosom, fled.
  Looking back, I saw that the bear crushed the snake, while the snake stung
  the bear to death."</p>

  <p>"Well, and the woman?"</p>

  <p>"The woman pressed a hasty kiss upon my forehead and suddenly vanished. I
  awoke and stretched out my arms for her in vain. The woman," he continued
  quickly, before Theodora had time to reflect, "is, of course, Italy."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said the Empress quietly, but her bosom heaved. "Your dream
  is most happy. The bear and the snake are barbarians and Italians, who strive
  for the city upon the seven hills. You tear it from their grasp, and let them
  mutually destroy each other."</p>

  <p>"But she vanishes&mdash;she does not remain."</p>

  <p>"She remains. She kisses you and disappears in your arms. So will Italy be
  swallowed up in your empire."</p>

  <p>"You are right!" said Justinian, springing up. "Thanks, my wise wife. You
  are the light of my soul! I will venture. Belisarius shall march." He was
  about to call the attendant, but suddenly stopped short. "One thing more,"
  and casting down his eyes he took Theodora's hand.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" thought Theodora, "now it is coming."</p>

  <p>"When we have destroyed the kingdom of the Goths, and have with the
  Queen's help taken Ravenna&mdash;what&mdash;what shall be done with her, the
  Princess?"</p>

  <p>"What shall be done with her?" repeated Theodora with well-feigned
  composure. "That which was done with the King of the Vandals. She shall come
  here, to Byzantium."</p>

  <p>Justinian breathed again.</p>

  <p>"It rejoices me that you have at once interpreted my thought," and he
  kissed her slender white hand with real pleasure.</p>

  <p>"More than that," said Theodora. "She will enter into our plans all the
  more willingly if she can look forward to an honourable reception here. So I
  will myself write her a sisterly epistle inviting her to come. In case of
  need she shall ever find an asylum in my heart."</p>

  <p>"You do not know," interrupted Justinian eagerly, "how much you will
  assist our victory by so doing. The daughter of Theodoric must be completely
  weaned from her people. She shall herself lead us to Ravenna."</p>

  <p>"But if so, you cannot immediately send Belisarius with an army. It would
  only awaken her suspicions and make her rebellious. She must first be
  completely in our power and the barbarians must have begun an internecine
  war, before the sword of Belisarius flies from its sheath."</p>

  <p>"But at least he must henceforth be in the vicinity."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, perhaps in Sicily. The disturbances in Africa afford the best
  excuse for sending a fleet into those waters. And as soon as the net is sunk
  Belisarius must draw it together."</p>

  <p>"But who shall sink it?"</p>

  <p>Theodora reflected for a few moments; then she said:</p>

  <p>"The most gifted man in the West; Cethegus Cæsarius, the Prefect of Rome,
  the friend of my youth."</p>

  <p>"Quite right. But not he alone. He is a Roman, no subject of mine; and I
  am not sure of him. Whom shall I send? Once again Alexandros?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Theodora, "he is too young for such a task. No." And she became
  thoughtfully silent. "Justinian," she said at last, "you shall see that I can
  sacrifice my personal dislikes for the sake of the empire, when it is
  necessary to choose the right man. I propose my enemy, Petros, the cousin of
  Narses, the fellow-student of the Prefect, the sly rhetorician&mdash;send
  him!"</p>

  <p>"Theodora!" cried the Emperor, embracing her; "God himself has given you
  to me! Cethegus&mdash;Petros&mdash;Belisarius. Barbarians! you are lost!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-16"
     name="b2-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">The morning following this conversation the beautiful
  Empress rose in great good-humour from her swelling cushions, which were
  filled with the delicate neck-feathers of the Pontian crane, and covered with
  pale yellow silk.</p>

  <p>Before the bed stood a tripod holding a silver basin, representing
  Oceanus; in it lay a massive golden ball. The Empress lifted the ball and let
  it fall clanging into the basin. The clear tone roused the Syrian slave who
  slept in the ante-room. She entered, and, approaching the bed of the Empress
  with her arms crossed upon her bosom, drew back the heavy violet-coloured
  curtains of Chinese silk. Then she took a soft Iberian sponge, which, soaked
  in asses' milk, lay in a crystal dish, and carefully wiped off the coating of
  oily paste with which the neck and face of her mistress were covered during
  the night.</p>

  <p>Next she kneeled down before the bed, her face bent almost to the earth,
  and stretched out her hand to the Empress, who, taking it, slowly set her
  foot upon the neck of the kneeling girl, and sprang elastically to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>The slave rose and threw over her mistress, who, clad only in an
  under-tunic of the finest lawn, sat upon the palm-wood frame of the
  bed&mdash;a fine dressing-mantle of rose-coloured stuff. Then she made a
  profound obeisance, turned to the door, cried "Agave!" and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Agave, a young and beautiful Thessalian girl, entered the room. She rolled
  a washstand of citrean-wood, covered with countless boxes and bottles, close
  before her mistress, and began to rub her face, neck, and hands with soft
  cloths dipped in different wines and essences. This task completed, the
  Empress rose from the bedside and stepped on to a couch covered with
  panther's skins.</p>

  <p>"The large bath towards mid-day," she said.</p>

  <p>Agave pushed an oval bath of terebinthus-wood, covered outside with
  tortoise-shell and filled with deliciously-scented water, in front of the
  divan, and lifted the little white feet of the Empress into it. Afterwards
  she loosened the net of gold-thread which confined the luxurious hair of her
  mistress during the night, letting the rich dark coils fall over neck and
  shoulders, and departed in her turn, calling "Galatea!"</p>

  <p>Galatea was an aged slave, the nurse, attendant, and, we regret to add,
  the procuress of Theodora, when the latter was only the bespangled daughter
  of Acacius the lion-keeper, and, while yet almost a child, the already
  deeply-corrupted favourite of the great Circus.</p>

  <p>Galatea had faithfully shared all the humiliations and triumphs, the vices
  and cunning of the adventuress's life until the latter had attained to the
  imperial throne.</p>

  <p>"How hast thou slept, my dove?" asked Galatea, handing to Theodora in a
  vessel of amber the aromatic essence which the town of Adana, in Sicily, was
  forced to send in large quantities for the Empress's use as a yearly
  tribute.</p>

  <p>"Well; I dreamt of him."</p>

  <p>"Of Alexandros?"</p>

  <p>"No, thou fool! of the handsome Anicius."</p>

  <p>"But Alexandros has been waiting for some time already; outside in the
  secret niche."</p>

  <p>"He is impatient," said the Empress, smiling; "well then, let him in!"</p>

  <p>And she leaned back upon the long divan, drawing a cover of purple silk
  over her; but the delicate ankles of her beautiful feet remained visible.</p>

  <p>Galatea bolted the principal door, through which she had entered, and
  crossed the room to the opposite corner, which was filled by a colossal
  bronze statue of Justinian. She touched a spring, and the seemingly immovable
  mass turned on one side, exposing a small opening in the wall, which was
  completely hidden by the statue in its normal position. A dark curtain was
  drawn before this opening. Galatea lifted the curtain and Alexandros hurried
  in. He threw himself on his knees before the Empress, caught her small hand
  and covered it with kisses.</p>

  <p>Theodora gently drew it away.</p>

  <p>"It is very imprudent, Alexandros," said she, leaning back her lovely
  head, "to admit a lover to the toilet of his mistress. What says the poet:
  'All things serve beauty. Yet it is no pleasant sight to see that in
  preparation which only pleases when complete.' But I promised, when you left
  for Ravenna, to admit you to my toilet, and you richly deserve your reward.
  You have ventured much for me. Fasten the braids tighter," she cried to
  Galatea, who had now commenced the task, entrusted to her alone, of dressing
  the splendid hair of her mistress. "You have risked your life for me,
  Alexandros!" and she gave him two fingers of her right hand.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Theodora!" cried the youth, "to gain but this one moment I would die
  ten times over!"</p>

  <p>"But," she continued, "why did you not send me a copy of the barbarian
  Queen's last letter to Justinian?"</p>

  <p>"It was not possible; there was no time. I could send no more messengers
  from my ship. I barely succeeded, after landing, in sending you word that her
  picture was among the presents. You came just at the right moment!"</p>

  <p>"Yes; what would become of me if I did not pay Justinian's door-keepers
  twice as well as he? But, most imprudent of ambassadors! how stupid you were
  about the date!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, loveliest daughter of Cyprus! I had not seen you for months! I could
  think of nothing but you and your wonderful beauty!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose I must forgive you.&mdash;Galatea, bring me the black
  fillet.&mdash;You are a better lover than a statesman, Alexandros. Therefore
  I have kept you here. Yes, you were to have gone once more to Ravenna! But I
  think I will send an older ambassador, and keep the young one for myself.
  Shall I?"</p>

  <p>Alexandros, becoming bolder and more ardent, sprang up and pressed a kiss
  upon her rosy lips.</p>

  <p>"Hold, traitor!" she scolded, and struck his cheek lightly with a fan of
  flamingo-feathers. "Enough for to-day. To-morrow you may come again, and tell
  me about the barbarian beauties. I must have the next hour for another."</p>

  <p>"For another!" cried Alexandros, starting back. "So what they whisper in
  the gymnasiums and baths of Byzantium is true! You ever
  faithless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Theodora's friends must never be jealous," laughed the Empress. It was no
  sweet laughter. "But this time you may be quite easy; you shall meet him
  yourself. Go."</p>

  <p>Galatea took the reluctant lover by the shoulders, without ceremony, and
  pushed him behind the statue and out of the secret door.</p>

  <p>Theodora now seated herself upright, and fastened the loose folds of her
  long under-garment with her girdle.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-17"
     name="b2-17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">Galatea appeared again immediately, accompanied by a little
  round-backed man, who looked much older than his forty-years justified. His
  wise, but pinched features, piercing eyes, and cunning mouth, made a
  disagreeable impression on all who observed him.</p>

  <p>Theodora returned his creeping salutation by a slight nod. Galatea began
  to paint her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Empress," the new-comer began, "I wonder at your courage. If I were seen
  here! A moment's rashness would render vain the prudence of nine years!"</p>

  <p>"But you will not be seen, Petros," said Theodora quietly. "This is the
  only hour in which I am secure from Justinian's importunate tenderness. It is
  his hour of prayer. I must profit by it as much as I can. God preserve his
  piety! Galatea, my wine. What! Surely, thou dost not fear to leave me alone
  with this dangerous seducer?"</p>

  <p>The old woman left the room with a hateful grin upon her lips, and soon
  returned with a jug of sweet heated Chian-wine in one hand, and a cup of
  honey and water in the other.</p>

  <p>"I could not arrange our meeting in the church as usual, where, in the
  dark confessional, you look exactly like a priest. The Emperor will call you
  before church-time, and you must be thoroughly instructed beforehand."</p>

  <p>"What is then to be done?"</p>

  <p>"Petros," answered Theodora, leaning comfortably back and sipping the
  sweet mixture which Galatea now handed to her, "the day has come which will
  reward all our years of patience, and make you a great man."</p>

  <p>"It is time, indeed!" observed Petros.</p>

  <p>"Do not be impatient, friend.&mdash;Galatea, a little more honey.&mdash;In
  order to put you into the right humour for to-day's business, it will be well
  to remind you of the past, of the manner in which our&mdash;friendship
  originated."</p>

  <p>"What mean you? Wherefore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For many reasons. To begin. You were the cousin and adherent of my deadly
  enemy, Narses. Consequently, you were my enemy too. For years you acted
  against me in your cousin's service, hurting me but little, and still less
  benefiting yourself. For Narses, your virtuous friend, considers it a point
  of honour never to do anything for his relations; so that, unlike other
  courtiers of the realm, he may never be accused of nepotism. Out of pure
  friendship and virtue, he left you unpromoted. You remained a simple writer
  and a poor man. But a clever man like you knows how to help himself. You
  forged&mdash;you doubled the amount of the Emperor's dues. Besides what was
  demanded by the Emperor, the provinces paid another tax, which Petros and the
  tax-gatherers shared amongst themselves. For a time all went on smoothly. But
  once&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Empress, I beseech you!"</p>

  <p>"I shall soon have finished, friend. But once you had the misfortune to
  have a new tax-gatherer, who valued the favour of the Empress more than the
  share of booty which you promised him. He entered into your plans, allowed
  you to forge the documents&mdash;and showed them to me!"</p>

  <p>"The wretch!" murmured Petros.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was bad enough," said Theodora smiling, and setting down her
  glass. "So I had the neck of my sly enemy, the confidant of the hated eunuch,
  under my foot; and, I must confess, I had a great desire to trample upon him.
  But I sacrificed a short revenge for a great and enduring advantage. I called
  you to me, and told you to choose whether you would die or serve me for life.
  You were kind enough to choose the last, and, still the greatest enemies in
  the eyes of the world, we have secretly worked together for years. No sooner
  has Narses formed a plan, than you reveal it to me. I have rewarded you well.
  You are now a rich man."</p>

  <p>"Not worth mentioning."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed, ungrateful man! My treasurer knows better. You are
  <i>very</i> rich."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but without dignity or rank. My fellow-students are patricians,
  great men in the East and West; like Cethegus in Rome, and Procopius
  here."</p>

  <p>"Patience! From this day you will quickly climb the ladder of ambition. It
  was necessary to keep something in reserve. Listen; to-morrow you go as
  ambassador to Ravenna."</p>

  <p>"As imperial ambassador!" cried Petros, rejoiced.</p>

  <p>"Through my influence. But that is not all. You will receive
  circumstantial directions from Justinian to undermine the kingdom of the
  Goths, and smooth the path of Belisarius in Italy."</p>

  <p>"Shall I obey these directions, or not?"</p>

  <p>"Obey them. But you will receive another order, which Justinian will
  particularly recommend to your notice; that is, to save the daughter of
  Theodoric from the hands of her enemies at any price, and bring her to
  Byzantium. Here is a letter from me to her, which presses her to take refuge
  in my arms."</p>

  <p>"'Tis well," said Petros, taking the letter. "I will bring her here
  immediately."</p>

  <p>Theodora, like an angry snake, started up on her couch with such
  impetuosity, that Petros and Galatea retreated in affright.</p>

  <p>"No, no, Petros! no!" she exclaimed. "For this reason I send you. She must
  <i>not</i> come to Byzantium! She must not live!"</p>

  <p>Confounded, Petros let the letter fall.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Empress!" he whispered; "murder?"</p>

  <p>"Peace!" cried Theodora, in a hoarse voice; and her eyes sparkled cruelly.
  "She must die!"</p>

  <p>"Die? Oh, Empress! wherefore?"</p>

  <p>"There is no need for you to know that. But stay; I will tell you, for it
  will give the spur to your courage. Listen." She seized his arm wildly, and
  whispered in his ear, "Justinian, the traitor, has conceived a passion for
  her!"</p>

  <p>"Theodora!" cried Petros, startled.</p>

  <p>The Empress fell back upon her couch.</p>

  <p>"But he has never seen her," stammered Petros.</p>

  <p>"He has seen her portrait. He already dreams of her. He has fallen in love
  with her picture."</p>

  <p>"You have never yet had a rival."</p>

  <p>"No; nor ever will."</p>

  <p>"You are so beautiful."</p>

  <p>"Amalaswintha is younger."</p>

  <p>"You are so wise; you are Justinian's counsellor the confidant of his most
  secret thoughts."</p>

  <p>"It is just this which annoys him. And"&mdash;she again caught his
  arm&mdash;"remember, she is a King's daughter, a born ruler; and I&mdash;am
  the plebeian daughter of a lion-keeper! Ridiculous and insane though it be,
  Justinian, in his purple, forgets that he is the son of a shepherd from the
  Dardanelles. He has imbibed the madness of Kings; he, himself an adventurer,
  chatters about innate majesty, about the mystery of royal blood! I have no
  protection against such whims. I fear nothing from all the women in the
  world. But this King's daughter&mdash;&mdash;" She angrily started up, and
  clenched her small fist. "Beware, Justinian!" she cried, pacing the room.
  "With this eye and hand I have subdued lions and tigers; let us see if I
  cannot keep this fox in royal purple at my feet." She re-seated herself. "In
  short, Amalaswintha dies," she said, suddenly becoming quite cool again.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Petros, "but not through me. You have bloodthirsty servants
  enough; send them. I am a man who will talk&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are a man who will die if you do not obey! You, my supposed enemy,
  must do it. None of my friends can venture it without arousing
  suspicion."</p>

  <p>"Theodora," said Petros, forgetting himself, "take care! To murder the
  daughter of Theodoric, a born Queen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha!" said Theodora, in a rage, "you, too, miserable man, are dazzled
  by the 'born Queen!' All men are fools, still more than rascals! Listen,
  Petros&mdash;the day when the news of her death arrives from Ravenna, you
  shall be a senator and a patrician."</p>

  <p>The man's eyes sparkled, but cowardice or conscience were still stronger
  than ambition.</p>

  <p>"No," he said decidedly, "I would rather lose the court and all my
  plans."</p>

  <p>"You will lose your life, wretch!" cried Theodora. "Oh, you think you are
  safe, because I burnt the forged documents before your eyes! You fool! they
  were false! Look here; here I hold your life in my hands!"</p>

  <p>She dragged a yellow parchment from a roll of documents, and showed it to
  Petros, who, completely subdued, fell upon his knees at her feet.</p>

  <p>"Command me!" he stammered, "I obey." Just then a knocking was heard at
  the principal door.</p>

  <p>"Away!" cried the Empress, "take my letter to the Queen from the ground,
  and think over what I have said: patrician if she dies, torture and death if
  she lives. Go!"</p>

  <p>Galatea pushed the bewildered man through the secret entrance, turned the
  statue into its place again, and went to open the great door.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-18"
     name="b2-18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">There entered a stately woman, taller and of coarser frame
  than the small and delicate Empress; not so seductively beautiful, but
  younger and more blooming, with a fresh complexion and natural manners.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, Antonina, sister of my heart! Come to my arms!" cried the
  Empress to the new-comer, who humbly bent before her.</p>

  <p>Antonina obeyed in silence.</p>

  <p>"How hollow her eyes have become," she thought, as she rose from the
  embrace.</p>

  <p>"How bony is the soldier's wife!" said the delicate Empress to herself,
  and looked at her friend.</p>

  <p>"You are as blooming as Hebe!" she said aloud, "and how well the white
  silk becomes your fresh complexion. Have you anything to tell me of&mdash;of
  him?" she asked indifferently, and took from the wash-stand a much-dreaded
  instrument, a sharp lancet with an ivory handle, with which clumsy, or even
  only unfortunate, slaves were often pricked by their angry mistress.</p>

  <p>"Not to-day," whispered Antonina, blushing. "I did not see him
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>"I believe it!" said Theodora to herself, with a hidden smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how painfully I shall miss you soon!" she added aloud, stroking
  Antonina's full round arm. "Perhaps Belisarius will sail next week, and you,
  most faithful of all wives, will go with him. Which of your friends will
  accompany you?"</p>

  <p>"Procopius," answered Antonina, "and&mdash;" she added, casting down her
  eyes&mdash;"the two sons of Boëthius."</p>

  <p>"Ah, indeed," remarked the Empress, smiling, "I understand. In the freedom
  of the camp you hope to please yourself with the handsome youth, undisturbed;
  and while our hero, Belisarius, fights battles and conquers
  cities&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You guess rightly. But I have a request to make. You are fortunate.
  Alexandros, your handsome friend, has returned; he remains near you, and is
  his own master; but Anicius, you know, is still under the strict guardianship
  of his elder brother, Severinus. Never would he&mdash;who thinks of nothing
  but fighting for freedom and revenge&mdash;suffer this tender friendship. He
  would repeatedly disturb our intimacy. Therefore do me a favour: do not let
  Severinus follow us! When we are on board with Anicius, keep the elder
  brother in Byzantium, either by cunning or by force. You can do it
  easily&mdash;you are the Empress!"</p>

  <p>"That is not bad," laughed Theodora. "What stratagems! One can see that
  you have learned from Belisarius."</p>

  <p>Antonina blushed violently.</p>

  <p>"Oh, do not name him! Do not mock me! You know best from whom I learnt to
  do that for which I must blush."</p>

  <p>Theodora shot a fierce glance at her friend, who, without noticing it,
  continued: "Heaven knows that Belisarius himself was not more faithful than
  I, until I came to this court! It was you, Empress, who taught me that these
  selfish men, occupied with affairs of state, war, and ambition, neglect us
  when they have become our husbands, and no longer value us when they possess
  us. You taught me that it is no sin to accept the innocent homage, the
  flattering devotion which is denied to us by our husbands, from friends who
  court us because they still hope. God is my witness, that it is nothing but
  this sweet incense which Belisarius denies me, and which my vain weak heart
  sorely needs, that I expect from Anicius."</p>

  <p>"Fortunately for me, it will soon tire him out," said Theodora to
  herself.</p>

  <p>"And yet," continued Antonina, "even this, I fear, is a sin against
  Belisarius. Oh, how great, how noble he is! If only he were not too great for
  this little heart." And she buried her face in her hands.</p>

  <p>"The pitiful creature!" thought the Empress, "too weak for vice, as for
  virtue."</p>

  <p>At this moment Agave, the beautiful Thessalian slave, entered the room
  with a large bunch of splendid roses.</p>

  <p>"From him," she whispered to her mistress.</p>

  <p>"From whom?" asked Theodora.</p>

  <p>But Antonina just then looked up, and Agave made a sign of warning. The
  Empress, in order to occupy her, gave Antonina the roses.</p>

  <p>"If you please, put them into that marble vase."</p>

  <p>As Antonina turned her back upon them to obey, Agave whispered: "From him
  whom you kept hidden here all day yesterday; from the handsome Anicius," the
  pretty girl added, blushing.</p>

  <p>But she had scarcely uttered the imprudent words, than she gave a loud
  cry, and held her left arm to her lips.</p>

  <p>The Empress struck her in the face with the still bloody lancet.</p>

  <p>"I will teach you to notice whether men are handsome or ugly," she cried
  furiously. "You will keep to the spinning-room for four weeks. Go at once!
  and do not show yourself again in my ante-rooms."</p>

  <p>The weeping girl left the room, hiding her face in her dress.</p>

  <p>"What has she done?" asked Antonina, coming forward.</p>

  <p>"She let the scent-bottle fall," answered Galatea quickly, and picked one
  up from the floor. "Mistress, I have finished."</p>

  <p>"Then let the dressers in, and whoever else waits in the ante-room. Will
  you, meanwhile, look at these verses, Antonina? They are the newest poems of
  Arator, 'The Deeds of the Apostles,' and very edifying. This particularly,
  'The Stoning of St. Stephen.' But read, and judge for yourself."</p>

  <p>Galatea opened wide the doors of the principal entrance. A whole troop of
  slaves and freed-women streamed in. Some occupied themselves with clearing
  away the articles of toilet hitherto used; others swung censers with aromatic
  incense, or sprinkled balsam about the room from narrow-necked flasks. But
  most of them were busy about the person of the Empress, who now completed her
  toilet.</p>

  <p>Galatea took off the rose-coloured tunic.</p>

  <p>"Berenice," she cried, "bring the Milesian tunic, with the purple stripe
  and gold tassels. To-day is Sunday ."</p>

  <p>While the experienced old woman was artfully fastening into the knot of
  the Empress's hair a costly gold needle, its head formed of a gem, engraved
  with a head of Venus, the Empress asked: "What news, from the city,
  Delphine?"</p>

  <p>"You have won, mistress!" answered Delphine, kneeling down with the gilded
  sandals; "your colours, the blue, have beaten the green; both with the horses
  and the chariots!"</p>

  <p>"What a triumph!" cried Theodora joyfully. "A bet of two centenaria of
  gold; it is mine! News? Whence? from Italy?" she cried to a slave who just
  entered with letters.</p>

  <p>"Yes, mistress, from Florence; from the Gothic Princess, Gothelindis. I
  know the Gorgon-seal; and from Silverius, the archdeacon."</p>

  <p>"Give me them," said Theodora, "I will take them with me to church. The
  mirror, Elpis."</p>

  <p>A young slave came forward with an oval plate of brilliantly-polished
  silver, in a gold frame, richly set with pearls, and standing on a strong
  foot of ivory.</p>

  <p>Poor Elpis had a hard service.</p>

  <p>During the completion of the toilet she had to hold the heavy plate, and,
  following every movement of her restless mistress, turn it, so that the
  latter could always look at her own reflection, and woe to Elpis if she were
  too late in turning!</p>

  <p>"What is there to buy, Zephyris?" the Empress asked a dark-skinned Lybian
  freed-woman, who just then brought her a tame snake to caress, which lay in a
  small basket upon soft moss.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing particular," answered the Lybian. "Come, Glauke," she added,
  taking a snowy white chlamys, embroidered with gold, from a clothes-press,
  and carefully spreading it out upon her arms, waited until Glauke took it
  from her, and, at one throw, arranged it in graceful folds upon the shoulders
  of the Empress, clasping it with the white girdle, and fastening one end upon
  her pearly shoulder with a golden brooch, which, formed in the shape of the
  dove of Venus, now represented the sign of the Holy Ghost.</p>

  <p>Glauke, the daughter of an Athenian sculptor, had studied the folds of the
  chlamys for years, and for this reason had been bought by the Empress at a
  cost of many thousand solidi. The whole day long this was her sole
  occupation.</p>

  <p>"Sweet-scented soap-balls," said Zephyris, "have just arrived from Spain.
  A new Milesian fairy-tale has just come out. And the old Egyptian is there
  again, with his Nile-water," she added in a low tone; "he says it is
  unfailing. The Persian Queen, who was childless for eight
  years&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Theodora turned away sighing; a shadow passed across her smooth face.</p>

  <p>"Send him away," she said; "this hope is past forever." And, for a moment,
  it seemed as if she would have sunk into a melancholy reverie.</p>

  <p>But she roused herself, and, beckoning to Galatea, she went back to her
  bed, took a crushed wreath of ivy which lay upon the pillow, and gave it to
  the old woman, whispering:</p>

  <p>"For Anicius, send it to him. The jewels, Erigone!"</p>

  <p>Erigone, with the help of two other slaves, brought forward, with great
  trouble, a heavy bronze casket, the lid of which, representing the workshop
  of Vulcan in embossed figures, was closed with the seal of the Empress.</p>

  <p>Erigone showed that the seal was intact, and then opened the lid. Many a
  girl stood upon her tiptoes to catch a glance at the shining treasures.</p>

  <p>"Will you wear the summer rings, mistress?" asked Erigone.</p>

  <p>"No," said Theodora, looking into the casket, "the time for those is over.
  Give me the heavy ones, the emeralds."</p>

  <p>Erigone handed to her rings, earrings, and bracelet.</p>

  <p>"How beautifully," said Antonina, looking up from her pious verses, "how
  beautifully the white of the pearls contrasts with the green of the
  stones."</p>

  <p>"It was one of Cleopatra's treasures," said the Empress indifferently;
  "the Jew swore to its pedigree."</p>

  <p>"But you linger long," said Antonina. "Justinian's litter was already
  waiting as I came up."</p>

  <p>"Yes, mistress," said a young slave anxiously, "the slave at the sundial
  has already announced the fourth hour. Hasten, mistress!"</p>

  <p>A prick with the lancet was the only answer.</p>

  <p>"Would you teach your Empress!" but she whispered to Antonina: "We must
  not spoil the men; they must always wait for us, never we for them. My
  ostrich fan, Thais. Go, Ione, tell the Cappadocian slaves to come to my
  litter." And she turned to go.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Theodora!" cried Antonina quickly, "do not forget my request."</p>

  <p>"No," answered Theodora, suddenly standing still, "certainly not! And that
  you may be quite sure, I will give the order into your own hands. My
  wax-tablets and the stylus!"</p>

  <p>Galatea brought them in haste.</p>

  <p>Theodora wrote, and whispered to her friend:</p>

  <p>"The Prefect of the harbour is one of my old friends. He blindly obeys me.
  Read what I write."</p>

  <p>"To Aristarchus the Prefect, Theodora the Empress.</p>

  <p>"When Severinus, the son of Boëthius, is about to go on board the ship of
  Belisarius, keep him back, if necessary, by force; and send him to my rooms.
  He is appointed my chamberlain."</p>

  <p>"Is that right, dear sister?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"A thousand thanks!" said Antonina, with beaming eyes.</p>

  <p>"But," said the Empress suddenly, putting her hand to her neck, "have we
  forgotten the principal thing? My amulet! the Mercury. Please, Antonina;
  there it hangs."</p>

  <p>Antonina turned hastily to fetch the little golden Mercury, which hung, by
  a silk cord, on the bed of the Empress.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Theodora quickly crossed out the word "Severinus," and wrote
  instead "Anicius." She closed the tablets, tied them, and fastened the string
  with her seal.</p>

  <p>"Here is the amulet," said Antonina, returning.</p>

  <p>"And here is the order," said the Empress, smiling. "You can give it to
  Aristarchus yourself at the moment of departure. Now," she cried, "let us go.
  To the church!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-19"
     name="b2-19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">In Neapolis, that Italian city over which the tempest then
  gathering at Byzantium was soon to burst in its first violence, no
  presentiment of the coming danger was felt.</p>

  <p>On the charming declivities of Posilippo, or on the shore to the
  south-east of the city, there wandered, day by day, two handsome youths,
  exchanging confidences with all the enthusiasm of youthful friendship. They
  were the "Dioscuri," Julius and Totila.</p>

  <p>Oh, happy time! when the uncorrupted soul, breathing the fresh morning air
  of life, as yet untired and undeceived, and drunk with the ecstasy of
  ambitious dreams, is urged to impart to an equally young, equally rich and
  equally enthusiastic nature its overflowing sentiments!</p>

  <p>The noblest resolves are strengthened, and imagination wings its way to
  the very gates of heaven, in the happy certainty that he who listens will
  understand.</p>

  <p>When the wreath upon our brows is faded, and the harvest of our life is
  ripe, we may smile at these dreams of youth and youthful friendship; but it
  is no smile of mockery; it is tinged with the melancholy with which we think
  of the sweet, exhilarating airs of spring, while inhaling the breath of decay
  in autumn.</p>

  <p>The young Goth and the young Roman had met at the age most favourable to
  the formation of the bond of friendship. Totila's sunny soul had preserved
  all the dewy bloom of youth; with smiling eyes he looked forth into the
  smiling future. He loved his fellow-creatures, and won all hearts by his
  amiability and the joyous frankness of his disposition. He believed in the
  complete victory of good over evil. Where meanness and wickedness met him in
  his path, he trod them into the dust with the holy anger of an archangel;
  from the depths of his gentle nature the latent heroic strength broke forth,
  and he did not rest until the hated elements were destroyed. But the
  disturbance was forgotten as soon as overcome, and life and the world again
  appeared to him as harmonious as his own soul. He walked through the crowded
  streets of Neapolis with a song upon his lips, the idol of the girls, the
  pride of his brothers in arms.</p>

  <p>With such a nature Totila was the favourite of all who knew him, receiving
  and imparting happiness. Even his quiet friend imbibed somewhat of the charm
  of his temperament.</p>

  <p>Julius Montanus, of a sensitive and thoughtful disposition, of an almost
  feminine nature, had been early left an orphan, and, awed by the immense
  superiority of his guardian Cethegus, had grown up shy, lonely and studious.
  More oppressed than elevated by the cheerless science of his time, he was
  apt; to look upon life as earnest and almost sad. He was inclined to subject
  all things to the severe test of superhuman perfection, and his natural
  self-distrust might easily have darkened into melancholy.</p>

  <p>At a happy moment Totila's friendship shone into the inmost depths of his
  heart, and penetrated it with such a sunny warmth that his noble nature was
  thereby enabled to rise with elasticity from a severe shock which it received
  by means of this very friendship.</p>

  <p>Let us hear what he himself wrote about this circumstance to the
  Prefect.</p>

  <p>"To Cethegus the Prefect, Julius Montanus.</p>

  <p>"The cold-hearted reply to my enthusiastic report of my newly-formed
  friendship to Totila, at first&mdash;surely contrary to your wish&mdash;hurt
  me sorely, but later it was the means of enhancing the happiness of this
  friendship in a manner, however, which you could neither foresee nor wish.
  Sorrow caused by you was soon changed into sorrow for <i>you</i>. Though at
  first I felt hurt because you treated my deepest feelings as the mere
  enthusiasm of a sickly boy, and tried to assail my profoundest convictions
  with bitter mockery&mdash;only <i>tried</i>, for they are
  unassailable&mdash;this feeling was soon changed into one of compassion for
  you. It is sad that a man like you, so rich in intellect, should be so poor
  in heart. It is sad that you do not know the happiness of self-denial, or of
  that unselfish love, which is called in the language of a belief&mdash;more
  laughed at than credited by you, but to which each day of pain draws me
  closer&mdash;<i>caritas</i>! Forgive the freedom of my words. I know I have
  never yet addressed such to you, but I have only lately become <i>what</i> I
  am. Perhaps it was not wholly with injustice that, in your last letter, you
  blamed the traces of childishness which you found in me. I believe that they
  have disappeared since then, and I speak to you now as a <i>man</i>. Your
  'medicine' has certainly accelerated my development, but not in your sense of
  the word and not according to your wish. It has brought me pain, holy and
  refining; it has put my friendship to a severe test, and, God be thanked, the
  fire has not destroyed it, but hardened it for ever. Read on and you will
  wonder at the manner in which Heaven has carried out your plans! Though
  pained at your letter, I very soon, with my habitual obedience, sought your
  friend, Valerius Procillus, the trader in purple. He had already left the
  town for his charming villa. There I followed him, and found a man of much
  experience, and a zealous friend of freedom and of his country. His daughter
  Valeria is a jewel! You prophesied truly. My intention of being extremely
  reserved melted at her sight like mist before the sun. It seemed to me as if
  Electra or Cassandra, Cloelia or Virginia, stood before me! But still more
  than by her great beauty, I was charmed by the grace of her mind as it
  unfolded itself before me. Her father at once invited me to remain as his
  guest, and under his roof I have spent the happiest days of my life. Valeria
  lives in the poetry of the ancients. How her melodious voice lent splendour
  to the choruses of Aeschylus, and melancholy to Antigone's lament! We read
  together for hours, and when she rose from her chair in her enthusiasm, when
  her dark hair waved freely over her shoulders and her eyes flashed with an
  almost unearthly fire, she looked indeed wonderfully beautiful. Her character
  gains an additional charm from a circumstance which may cause her much future
  grief, and which runs through her life like a cruel rent. You will guess what
  I mean, for you know the history of her family. You know better than I how it
  happened that her mother dedicated Valeria at her birth to a lonely virgin
  life, passed in works of piety, but that her rich father, more worldly than
  heavenly-minded, bought her release from this vow at the cost of a church and
  a cloister. But Valeria believes that Heaven will not accept dead gold for a
  living soul; she does not feel released from this vow, of which she thinks
  not with love but with fear. For you were right when you wrote that she is a
  true child of the ancient heathen world. Not only that, but she is the true
  child of her father, yet still she cannot altogether renounce the pious
  Christianity of her mother; it lives within her, not as a blessing, but as an
  overpowering curse; as the inevitable fetter of that fatal vow. This strange
  conflict of feeling tortures her, but it ennobles her also. Who knows how the
  struggle will be ended? Heaven alone which will decide her fate. This inward
  strife attracts me. You know that Christian faith and atheistic philosophy
  struggle for the victory in my soul. To my astonishment, faith has increased
  during these days of sorrow, and it almost seems to me that happiness leads
  to heathen wisdom, and pain and misfortune to Christ. But you have still to
  learn the cause of my suffering. When I became at first aware of my growing
  passion, I was full of joyful hope. Valerius, perhaps already influenced by
  you, observed my attention to Valeria with no dislike; perhaps the only thing
  he disapproved in me was, that I did not sufficiently share in his dreams of
  a renewed Roman Republic, or his in hatred of the Byzantines; in whom he sees
  the deadly enemies, not only of his family, but of Italy. Valeria, too, soon
  bestowed her friendship upon me, and who knows if at that time this
  friendship and her reverence to her father's wishes would not have sufficed
  to induce her to accept my love. But I thank&mdash;shall I say God or
  Fate?&mdash;that this did not happen. To sacrifice Valeria to a married life
  of indifference would have been a sacrilege. I do not know what strange
  feeling prevented me from speaking the word, which, at that time, would have
  made her mine. I loved her deeply; but each time that I was about to take
  courage and sue to her father for her hand, a feeling crept over me as if I
  were trespassing on another's property; as if I were not worthy of her, or
  not intended for her; and I was silent and controlled my beating heart. One
  day, at the sixth hour&mdash;it was sultry and the sun scorched both land and
  sea&mdash;I went to seek coolness and shade in the grotto of the garden. I
  entered through the oleander-bushes. There Valeria reposed upon a soft, mossy
  bank, one hand resting upon her gently-heaving bosom, the other placed
  beneath her head, which was still crowned with a wreath of asphodels worn
  during the evening meal. I stood before her trembling; she had never looked
  so lovely. I bent over her, lost in admiration; my heart beat quickly. I bent
  still lower, and would have kissed her delicate rosy mouth, but all at once a
  thought oppressed me: what you are about to do is a robbery! Totila! my whole
  soul cried within me, and as gently as I had come I left her. Totila! why had
  I never thought of him before? I reproached myself for having almost
  forgotten the brother of my heart in my new happiness. The next day I
  returned to Neapolis to fetch him. I praised the beauty of the maiden, but I
  could not prevail on myself to tell him of my love. I preferred that he
  should come and find it out for himself. On our arrival at the villa we did
  not find Valeria in the house. So I led Totila into the garden&mdash;Valeria
  is passionately fond of flowers&mdash;and as we issued from an avenue, she
  appeared before us in all her dazzling beauty. She was standing before a
  statue of her father and crowning it with freshly-plucked roses, which she
  held heaped up in a fold of her tunic.</p>

  <p>"It was a surprisingly beautiful picture&mdash;this lovely girl, framed in
  the dark green of the taxus-bushes, her right hand uplifted to the white
  marble statue, the other pressing the corner of her robe to her
  bosom&mdash;and the effect upon Totila was overpowering. With a cry of
  astonishment, he remained rooted to the ground before her. She looked up and
  started. The roses fell from her dress to the ground; she did not notice it.
  Their eyes had met, and her cheeks were covered with blushes. At a glance I
  saw that her and my fate was decided. They loved each other at first sight!
  This certainly pierced my soul like a burning arrow. But only for a moment
  did I feel this unmixed pain. The next, as I looked at the two, I felt
  unselfishly glad that they had found each other; for it seemed as if the
  Power which creates the souls and bodies of mortals, had formed them of one
  material for each other. They belonged to each other, like morning sunshine
  and morning flowers. Now I knew what mysterious feeling had kept me apart
  from Valeria, and caused me to pronounce his name. By the wisdom of God, or
  in the course of the stars, it had been decided that Valeria should be
  Totila's, and that I should not step in between them.</p>

  <p>"Permit me to leave the rest untold; for my nature is still so selfish,
  the holy precept of self-denial has still so little power over me,
  that&mdash;I am ashamed to confess it&mdash;my heart often fails me, instead
  of beating with happiness at the good fortune of my friends. As two flames
  mingle inseparably together, so their hearts were united. They love each
  other, and are as happy as the immortal gods. To me remains the joy of
  witnessing their bliss, and helping them to conceal it from the eyes of their
  father, who will scarcely give his child to the barbarian as long as he sees
  in Totila <i>only</i> the barbarian. But I keep my love and its sacrificial
  death a secret from my friend; he does not guess, nor shall he ever learn,
  that which would only disturb his happiness. You see now, Cethegus, how far
  from your aim a god has turned your plan. You would have given to me this
  jewel of Italy, and instead it is laid at Totila's feet. You would have
  destroyed my friendship, and have, instead, freed it, in the furnace of
  self-immolation, from all earthly dross, and made it immortal. You would have
  made me a man through the joy of love, and I have become a man through love's
  pain. Farewell, and revere the guidance of Heaven!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-20"
     name="b2-20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p class="first">We will not attempt to describe the effect of this letter
  upon the Prefect, but will rather accompany the two friends upon one of their
  evening walks on the charming shores of the Gulf of Neapolis.</p>

  <p>After an early coena, they wandered through the city, and out of the Porta
  Nolana, which was still decorated with some half-ruined reliefs, illustrating
  the victories of one of the Roman Emperors over the barbarians.</p>

  <p>Totila stood still and admired the beautiful sculpture.</p>

  <p>"Who can be that Emperor," he asked his friend, "on the car of victory,
  with the winged lightning in his hand, like a Jupiter Tonans?"</p>

  <p>"That is Marcus Aurelius," said Julius, and would have walked on.</p>

  <p>"Oh, stay a while! And who are those four prisoners in chains, with the
  long waving hair, who drag the car?"</p>

  <p>"They are Germanic Kings."</p>

  <p>"But of what family?" asked Totila. "Look there, an
  inscription&mdash;'<i>Gothi extincti!</i>'&mdash;the Goths annihilated!" and,
  laughing loudly, the young Goth struck the marble column with the palm of his
  hand, and walked quickly through the gate. "A lie in marble!" he cried,
  looking back. "That Emperor never thought that one day a Gothic Count in
  Neapolis would give his boast the lie!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, nations are like the changing leaves upon the tree," said Julius
  thoughtfully. "Who will govern this land after you?"</p>

  <p>Totila stood still.</p>

  <p>"AFTER US?" he asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What! You do not think that your Goths will endure for ever amongst the
  nations?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that," said Totila, walking on.</p>

  <p>"My friend, Babylonians and Persians, Greeks and Macedonians, and, as it
  seems, we Romans also, had their appointed time. They flourished, ripened,
  and decayed. Will it be otherwise with the Goths?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," answered Totila uneasily. "I never thought about it. It
  has never occurred to me that a time might come when my nation&mdash;&mdash;"
  He hesitated, as if it were a sin even to express the thought. "How can one
  imagine such a thing? I think as little about it as I do
  about&mdash;death!"</p>

  <p>"That is like you, my Totila."</p>

  <p>"And it is like you, Julius, to tease yourself and others with such
  dreams."</p>

  <p>"Dreams! You forget that for me and for my nation it has already become a
  reality. You forget that I am a Roman. I cannot deceive myself like most men;
  it is all over with us. The sceptre has gone from us to you. It was not
  without much painful thought that I learned to forget that you, my bosom
  friend, are a barbarian, the enemy of my country."</p>

  <p>"But it is not so, by the light of the sun!" interrupted Totila eagerly.
  "Do I find this harsh thought in you too? Look around you! When, tell me,
  when has Italy ever flourished more than under our protection? Scarcely in
  the time of Augustus! You teach us science and art; we give you peace and
  protection. Can one imagine a finer correlation? Harmony amongst Romans and
  Goths may create an entirely new era, more splendid than has ever
  existed."</p>

  <p>"Harmony! But it does not exist. You are to us a strange people, divided
  from us by speech and faith, by race and customs, and by centuries of hatred.
  Once we robbed you of your freedom; now you have robbed us of ours. Between
  us yawns a wide abyss."</p>

  <p>"You reject my favourite idea."</p>

  <p>"It is a dream!"</p>

  <p>"No, it is truth. I feel it, and perhaps the time will come when I can
  prove it. I would build all the fabric of my life upon it."</p>

  <p>"Then were it built upon a noble delusion. No bridge between Romans and
  barbarians!"</p>

  <p>"Then," said Totila, with some heat, "I do not understand how you can
  live&mdash;how you could take me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do not complete your sentence," said Julius gravely. "It was not easy; it
  was most painful self-denial. Only after a sharp struggle with selfish
  feelings did I succeed. But at last I have ceased to live only in my nation.
  The faith which already unites Romans and barbarians as nothing else could;
  which more and more powerfully conquered my repugnant reason by grief and
  pain&mdash;pain which turned to joy&mdash;brought peace to me in the conflict
  of my soul. In this one thing I may already boast that I am a Christian; I
  live for mankind, not alone for my nation. I am a man, and no longer a mere
  Roman. Therefore I can love you, the barbarian, like a brother. Are we not
  brothers of one family&mdash;that of humanity? Therefore I can bear to live,
  even after seeing my nation die. I live for humanity; that is my people."</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Totila vehemently; "that I could never do. I can, and will,
  live only for my nation. My nationality is the air in which alone my soul can
  breathe. Why should we not endure eternally, or as long as this earth
  endures? Persians and Greeks? We are of better stuff! Need we fall because
  they have decayed? We are still in the strength of our youth. Ah, no! If the
  day should ever come when the Goths fall, may I not live to see it! Oh, ye
  gods! let us not linger like these sickly Greeks, who cannot live and cannot
  die. No; if it must be, send a fearful tempest, and let us perish suddenly
  and gloriously all, all! and I the foremost!"</p>

  <p>He had excited himself to the warmest enthusiasm. He sprang up from the
  marble bench upon which they had been seated, and shook his lance in the
  air.</p>

  <p>"My friend," said Julius, looking at him kindly, "how well this ardour
  becomes you! But reflect; such a conflict could only be kindled against
  <i>us</i>, against my nation, and should I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If ever such a strife arose, you should cling to your nation, body and
  soul, that is clear. You think that would interfere with our friendship? Not
  in the least. Two heroes can cleave each other to the marrow, and yet remain
  the best friends. Ha! I should rejoice to meet you in battle, with spear and
  shield."</p>

  <p>Julius smiled: "My friendship is not of so grim a nature, my savage Goth!
  These doubts have tormented me for some time, and all my philosophers
  together could give me no peace. Only since I learned, in my sorrow, that I
  owe service to God in heaven alone, and must, on earth, live for humanity,
  and not for a nation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Softly, friend," cried Totila, "where is this humanity of which you rave?
  I do not see it. I see only Goths, Romans, and Byzantines! I know of no
  humanity somewhere up in the sky, above the existing peoples. I serve
  humanity by serving my nation! I cannot do otherwise. I can not strip off the
  skin in which I was born. I speak like a Goth, in Gothic words, not in a
  language of general humanity: there is no such thing. And as I speak like a
  Goth, so I feel like a Goth. I can appreciate strange nations certainly; I
  can admire your art, your science, and, in part, your state, in which
  everything is so strictly ordered. We can learn much from you; but I could
  not and would not exchange, even with a people of angels. Ah! my brave Goths!
  At the bottom of my heart their faults are dearer to me than your
  virtues!"</p>

  <p>"How differently I feel, and yet I am a Roman."</p>

  <p>"You are no Roman! Forgive me, friend, it is long since a Roman existed,
  else I could never be the Count of the Harbour of Neapolis. No one can feel
  as you do, whose nation yet exists; and all must feel as I do, who belong to
  a living people."</p>

  <p>Julius was silent for a short time. "If it be indeed so, then happy I! If
  I have lost the earth, I have gained heaven! What are nations, what are
  states, what is the earth? Not here below is the home of my immortal soul,
  which longs for a kingdom where all is divine and eternal!"</p>

  <p>"Stop, Julius," said Totila, standing still, and striking his lance upon
  the ground. "Here upon earth have I a firm footing; here let me stand and
  live, doing good, and enjoying what is beautiful. I will not follow you into
  your heaven. I cannot. I honour your dreams and your longing for holiness;
  but I do not share your feelings. You know," he added, smiling, "that I am an
  inveterate heathen, like Valeria&mdash;my Valeria! I remember her at the
  right moment. Your earth-forsaking dreams make us forget the dearest things
  upon that earth! Look, we have reached the city again; the sun sinks rapidly
  here in the south, and before nightfall I must take some seeds to the garden
  of Valerius. A fine gardener," he laughed, "to forget his flowers. Farewell.
  I turn to the right."</p>

  <p>"Farewell. Greet Valeria for me. I shall go home and read."</p>

  <p>"What are you reading now? still Plato?"</p>

  <p>"No, Augustinus. Farewell!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-21"
     name="b2-21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p class="first">Totila, avoiding the more thickly populated parts of the
  inner town, hurried through the suburbs towards the Porta Capuana and the
  tower of Isaac, the Jewish gate-keeper.</p>

  <p>This tower stood on the right of the gate, and had strong walls and a
  massive arched roof. It was divided into different stories, each being
  smaller than the one below it. In the top story, close to the battlements,
  were two low but roomy chambers, intended for the dwelling of the
  gate-keeper.</p>

  <p>There lived the old Jew, with Miriam, his beautiful daughter.</p>

  <p>In the largest of these two rooms&mdash;where, against the walls, hung a
  row of heavy keys belonging to the principal and side doors of this important
  gate, a curved signal-horn, and the spear of the gate-keeper&mdash;sat Isaac,
  the aged warder, a tall, bony figure, with the hooked nose and arched and
  bushy eyebrows of his nation. He sat upon a reed mat, with his legs crossed,
  a long staff laid upon his knees, listening attentively to the words of a
  young, ill-favoured-looking man, evidently an Israelite, whose hard, sober
  features were expressive of all the cunning of his race.</p>

  <p>"Look here, father Isaac," he was saying, in a thin, unpleasant voice, "my
  words are no vain words, and do not come only from the heart, which is blind,
  but from the mind, which is sharp to discern. I have brought letter and
  document for every word that I speak. Here is my appointment as architect of
  all the aqueducts in Italy; fifty gold solidi yearly, and ten more for every
  new undertaking. I have just reconstructed the half-ruined aqueduct for this
  city of Neapolis; in this purse are the ten solidi, money down. Thou seest I
  can keep a wife, and besides, I am thy cousin Rachel's son, so do not let me
  speak in vain, but give me Miriam, thy child, to wife, so that she may set my
  house in order."</p>

  <p>But the old man stroked his long grey beard, and shook his head
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"Jochem, son of Rachel, I say to thee, leave it alone, leave it
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Why, what hast thou against me? Who in Israel can speak against
  Jochem?"</p>

  <p>"No one. Thou art just and peaceful and industrious, and increasest thy
  substance, and thy work flourisheth before the Lord. But hast thou ever seen
  the nightingale mated with the sparrow, or the slender gazelle with the beast
  of burden? They do not suit each other; and now, look there, and tell me
  thyself if thou art fitted for Miriam?"</p>

  <p>He softly pushed aside the curtain which shut off the outer chamber. At a
  large bow-window which commanded a view of the splendid city, the blue sea,
  and the distant mountains, stood a young girl, holding a strangely-shaped
  stringed instrument in her arms. The room was filled with the glowing light
  of the setting sun, which bathed the white garments and the noble features of
  the girl with a rosy lustre. It played upon her shining black hair, which,
  stroked back behind the small ears, exposed the delicate temples; and, like
  this sunshine, a poetical harmony seemed to envelop her whole figure,
  accompanying her every movement, and every dreamy look of her dark blue eyes,
  which, filled with gentle thoughts, gazed out over sea and city. Piso, the
  poet, had called these eyes "dark sea-blue."</p>

  <p>As if in a half dream, her fingers touched the strings of her instrument
  softly, while from her half-open lips there breathed an old and melancholy
  song:</p>

  <p>"By the waters of Babylon We sat down and wept. When comes the day when
  Israel Shall cease to weep?"</p>

  <p>"Shall cease to weep?" she repeated dreamily, and leaned her head upon her
  arm, which, enclosing the harp, she rested upon the window-sill.</p>

  <p>"Look there!" said the old man in a low voice, "is she not as lovely as
  the rose of Sharon, or the hind upon the mountain, without spot or
  fleck?"</p>

  <p>Before Jochem could answer, there sounded from below three knocks upon the
  small iron door. Miriam started from her reverie, and hurried down the narrow
  winding staircase. Jochem went to the window, and his face grew dark and
  frowning.</p>

  <p>"Ha! the Christian! the cursed Christian!" he growled, and clenched his
  fist. "That fair Goth again, with his insufferable pride! Father Isaac, is
  that the stag that suits thee for thy hind?"</p>

  <p>"Son, speak no mocking word against Isaac! Thou knowest that the youth has
  set his heart upon a Roman girl; he thinks not of the Pearl of Judah!"</p>

  <p>"But perhaps the Pearl of Judah thinks of him!"</p>

  <p>"With joy and gratitude, as the lamb thinks of the strong shepherd who has
  saved it from the jaws of the wolf. Hast thou forgotten, that, when last
  these cursed Romans hunted for the treasures and gold-heaps of Israel, and
  burnt down the synagogue with unholy fire, a band of these wicked men chased
  my poor child through the streets, like a pack of wolves after a white lamb,
  and tore the veil from her face, and the kerchief from her shoulders? Where
  was Jochem then, my cousin's son, who had accompanied her? He had fled from
  danger with swift feet, and had left the dove in the claws of the
  vulture!"</p>

  <p>"I am a man of peace," said Jochem uneasily; "my hand holds not the sword
  of force."</p>

  <p>"But Totila held it, brave as the Lion of Judah; and the Lord was with
  him. Alone he sprang amid the group of impudent robbers, struck the boldest
  with his sharp sword, and drove away the others as a falcon frighten crows.
  He covered my trembling child carefully with her veil, and supporting her
  tottering footsteps, led her home, unhurt, to the arms of her old father. May
  Jehovah the Lord bless him for this deed with long life and happiness!"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Jochem, taking up his papers, "then I will go: this time for
  a long while. I must travel over the great waters to transact an important
  business."</p>

  <p>"An important business? With whom?"</p>

  <p>"With Justinianus, the Emperor of the East. A portion of the great church,
  which he is building to the glory of God, in the golden town of Constantine,
  has fallen in. I have made a plan for the restoration of the building."</p>

  <p>The old man sprang up hastily, and struck his stick upon the ground.</p>

  <p>"What, Jochem, son of Rachel! wilt thou serve the Romans? Wilt thou serve
  the Emperor, whose forefathers destroyed the holy city of Zion, and reduced
  the Temple of the Lord to ashes? Wilt thou build a house for the erring
  faith, thou, the son of the pious Manasseh? Woe, woe to thee!"</p>

  <p>"Why callest thou 'woe,' and knowest not wherefore? Canst thou smell
  whether a gold piece comes from the hand of a Jew or from that of a
  Christian? Does it not weigh as heavily and shine as brightly?"</p>

  <p>"Son of Manasseh, thou canst not serve God and Mammon."</p>

  <p>"But thou thyself art a servant of the unbelievers! Do I not see the
  warder's keys on the walls of thy chamber? Dost thou not keep them for these
  Goths, and openest the doors for their outgoing and incoming, and guardest
  the castle of their strength?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do so," said the old man proudly; "and I will watch for them
  faithfully, day and night, like a dog for its master; and as long as Isaac
  lives, no enemy of their nation shall enter these gates. For the children of
  Israel owe fervent thanks to them and to their great King, who was as wise as
  Solomon and as mighty as Gideon! We owe them such thanks as our forefathers
  owed to Cyrus, who freed them from the Babylonian captivity. The Romans
  destroyed the Temple of the Lord, and scattered His people over the face of
  the earth. They have mocked and beaten us, and burnt our holy places, and
  plundered our towns, and defiled our houses, and forced our wives, all over
  this land, and have made many a cruel law against us. But there came this
  great King from the North, whose seed may Jehovah bless! and he rebuilt our
  synagogues, and where the Romans had destroyed them, they were obliged to
  rebuild them with their own hands and their own money. He protected our
  homes, and whoever injured an Israelite was punished as if he had offended a
  Christian. He left us our God and our belief, and protected our commerce, and
  we celebrated the Paschal in such joy and peace as we had never known since
  the time when the Temple still stood upon Zion. And when a Roman noble had
  taken my Sarah from me by force, King Theodoric ordered that his proud head
  should be struck off that very day, and gave me back my wife unhurt. This I
  will remember as long as my days endure, and I will serve the nation
  faithfully till death, and once again it shall be said far and wide: as
  faithful and true as a Jew!"</p>

  <p>"Mayst thou not reap ingratitude where thou sowest gratitude," said
  Jochem, preparing to go; "it seems to me that the time will come, when I
  shall again sue for Miriam&mdash;for the last time. Perhaps, father Isaac,
  thou wilt then be less proud." And he went through Miriam's chamber and down
  the steps, where he met Totila.</p>

  <p>With an ungracious bow and a piercing look, the little man pressed past
  the slender Goth, who was obliged to stoop, as he entered the warder's
  dwelling.</p>

  <p>Miriam followed Totila immediately.</p>

  <p>"There hangs your gardener's dress," said she in a melodious voice,
  without raising her long lashes, "and here in the window I have placed the
  flowers ready. You said lately that she loved the white narcissus. I have
  taken care to procure some. They smell so sweet!"</p>

  <p>"You are a good little maiden, Miriam," said Totila, taking off his helmet
  with the silver-white swan's wings, and setting it upon the table. "Where is
  your father?"</p>

  <p>"The blessing of the Lord rest upon thy golden locks," said the old man,
  as he entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Good even, faithful Isaac!" cried Totila, taking off the long white
  mantle which hung from his shoulders, and enveloping himself in a brown
  cloak, which Miriam took down from the wall. "You good people! without you
  and your faithful silence, all Neapolis would know of my secret. How can I
  thank you!"</p>

  <p>"Thank?" said Miriam, fixing her beaming eyes upon him, "you have thanked
  us beforehand to all eternity!"</p>

  <p>"No, Miriam," said Totila, pulling a broad-brimmed brown felt hat low down
  upon his forehead, "that was nothing. Tell me, father Isaac, who is that
  little man who just went away, and whom I have often met here? It seems to me
  that he has cast his eyes upon Miriam. Speak frankly. If a dowry is
  wanting&mdash;I would gladly be of use."</p>

  <p>"Love is wanting&mdash;on her side," said Isaac quietly,</p>

  <p>"Then I can certainly do no good! But if her heart has chosen
  elsewhere&mdash;I should like to do something for my Miriam!" and he laid his
  hand gently upon the maiden's shining hair.</p>

  <p>The touch was but slight, but as if a flash of lightning had startled her,
  Miriam fell suddenly upon her knees. Her head sank upon her bosom, and,
  crossing her arms, she slipped down at Totila's feet like a flower heavy with
  dew.</p>

  <p>Totila drew back a step in surprise. But the next moment the girl had
  risen.</p>

  <p>"Forgive, it was only a rose&mdash;it fell at your feet," She placed the
  flower upon the table, and seemed so composed, that neither her father nor
  Totila thought further of the occurrence. "It is growing dark already; make
  haste, sir!" she said quietly, and gave him a basket containing flowers and
  plants.</p>

  <p>"I go. Valeria is very thankful for all your kindness. I have told her a
  great deal about you, and she has long wished to see you. Well, perhaps we
  can soon manage it&mdash;to-day is, probably, the last time that I shall need
  this disguise."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to carry off the daughter of Edom?" cried the old man. "Bring
  her here! here she will be well hidden!"</p>

  <p>"No," interposed Miriam, "not here! no, no!"</p>

  <p>"Why not, thou strange child?" asked her father in a tone of
  annoyance.</p>

  <p>"This is no place for a bride&mdash;this chamber&mdash;it would bring her
  no blessing."</p>

  <p>"Be not uneasy," said Totila, as he went to the door, "I shall soon put an
  end to secrecy by sueing for her hand openly. Farewell!" He hastened out.</p>

  <p>Isaac took the spear, the horn, and several keys from the wall, and
  followed in order to open the gate for Totila, and make the round of all the
  doors of the great tower.</p>

  <p>Miriam remained alone.</p>

  <p>For a long time she stood with closed eyes motionless on the same
  spot.</p>

  <p>At last she passed both hands over her forehead and cheeks, and looked
  about her.</p>

  <p>The room was very quiet; through the open window stole the first beam of
  moonlight. It fell silvery upon Totila's white mantle, which hung in long
  folds over a chair. Miriam ran and covered the hem of the mantle with burning
  kisses. She took the glittering helmet, which stood near her upon the table,
  and pressed it tenderly to her heart with both arms. Then holding it a little
  way from her, she gazed upon it dreamily for a few moments, and, at
  last&mdash;she could not resist&mdash;she lifted it up and placed it upon her
  lovely head. She started as the heavy bronze touched her forehead, and then,
  stroking back her dark braids, she pressed the cold hard steel firmly upon
  her brow. She then took it off, and set it, looking shyly round, in its
  former place, and going to the window she looked out into the magic moonlight
  and the scented night-air. Her lips moved as if in prayer, but the words of
  the prayer were the same old song:</p>

  <p>"By the waters of Babylon We sat down and wept. O daughter of Zion, when
  comes the day Which stills thy heavy pain?"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-22"
     name="b2-22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p class="first">While Miriam was gazing silently at the first pale stars,
  Totila's impatience soon brought him to the villa of the rich trader, which
  lay at about an hour's distance from the Porta Capuana.</p>

  <p>The slave who kept the gate told him to go to the old Hortularius,
  Valeria's freedman, who had the care of the garden. This freedman had been
  admitted to the lovers' confidence, and now took the plants from the supposed
  gardener's boy, and led him into his sleeping-room, the low windows of which
  opened into the garden. The next day before sunrise&mdash;so taught the
  mysteries of ancient horticulture&mdash;the flowers must be planted, so that
  the first sunlight which shone upon them in the new soil should be that of
  the fresh morning. The young Goth waited impatiently in the narrow chamber
  for the hour at which Valeria would be able to leave her father after their
  evening meal.</p>

  <p>He drew aside the curtain which covered the window and again and again
  looked up at the sky, measuring the flight of time by the rising of the stars
  and the progress of the moon. The large garden before him lay bathed in its
  peaceful light.</p>

  <p>In the distance, the plashing of a fountain could be heard, and the
  cicadas chirped in the myrtles. The warm south wind blew sultry through the
  night, at times bearing clouds of sweet odour upon its wings; and, from the
  blooming grove at the end of the garden, the clear song of the nightingale
  filled the air with melody.</p>

  <p>At last Totila could wait no longer. He swung himself noiselessly over the
  marble sill of the window; the white sand of the narrow path scarcely grated
  beneath his rapid footsteps, as, avoiding the stream of moonlight, he hurried
  along under the shrubbery.</p>

  <p>On past the dark taxus-trees and the thick olive-groves; past the tall
  statue of Flora, whose white marble shone ghostly in the moonlight; past the
  large basin, where six marble dolphins spouted water high into the air; into
  the thick shrubbery of laurels and tamarinds, and, pressing through the
  oleanders, he stood before the stalactite grotto, in which a marble nymph of
  the spring leaned upon a large dark urn. As he entered, a white figure glided
  from behind the statue.</p>

  <p>"Valeria, my lovely rose!" cried Totila, ardently embracing her.</p>

  <p>"Leave me, leave me, my beloved!" she said, withdrawing from his arms.</p>

  <p>"No, sweet one! I will not leave you. How long, how painfully, I have
  missed you! Do you hear how sweetly and invitingly the nightingale calls?
  Inhale the warm air of the summer night and the intoxicating scent of the
  roses. All breathes joy and love! Oh, let us hold fast these golden hours! My
  soul cannot contain all its bliss! All thy beauty; all our youth; and this
  glowing, blooming summer night. Life rolls in mighty waves through my heart,
  and bursts it with delight!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Totila, I would gladly lose myself, like you, in the happiness of
  these hours! But I cannot. The intoxicating perfume, the luxurious warmth of
  these summer nights are but transient; they breed misfortune. I cannot
  believe in the happiness of our love!"</p>

  <p>"Thou dear fool, why not?"</p>

  <p>"I know not. The unhappy doubt which troubles all my life spreads its
  curse even over our love. How gladly would I love and trust like you! But a
  warning voice in my heart ever repeats: 'It will not last&mdash;thou shalt
  not be happy!'"</p>

  <p>"Then, even in my arms, you are not happy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and no! The feeling of concealment from my noble father oppresses
  me. See, Totila, what makes me love you most is not your youthful beauty and
  strength, nor even your great love for me. It is my pride in your character,
  in your frank, unclouded and noble character. I have accustomed myself to see
  you walk through this dark world bright and strong as the God of Light. The
  noble courage, sure of victory; the enthusiasm and truth of your being, are
  my pride. That when you approach, all that is mean, little, and unholy must
  vanish from before you, is my delight. I love you as a mortal loves the
  Sun-god who approaches him in the fulness of his glory, and therefore I can
  endure nothing secret about you. Not even the delight of these hours&mdash;it
  is enjoyed by stealth, and that must no longer be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, Valeria, and shall not! I feel exactly the same. I hate the lie of
  this disguise; I can bear it no longer! To-morrow I will throw it off and
  speak openly and freely to your father."</p>

  <p>"This decision is the best, for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For it saves your life, young man!" suddenly cried a deep voice, and from
  the dark background of the grotto a man came forth, in the act of sheathing
  his sword.</p>

  <p>"My father!" cried Valeria, startled, but with courageous composure.
  Totila put one arm round her.</p>

  <p>"Away, Valeria! leave the barbarian!" cried Valerius, stretching out his
  hand commandingly.</p>

  <p>"No, Valerius," cried Totila, pressing Valeria close to his breast;
  "henceforward her place is on my bosom!"</p>

  <p>"Audacious Goth!"</p>

  <p>"Hear me, Valerius, and be not angry with us for this deceit. You yourself
  heard that it was to end tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Fortunately for you, I did. Warned by an old friend, I could still
  scarcely believe that my daughter&mdash;would deceive me. When I was
  compelled to believe my eyes, I was resolved that your life should pay for
  her fault. Your words saved you. But now go; you will never again see her
  face."</p>

  <p>Totila would have retorted angrily, but Valeria was beforehand.</p>

  <p>"Father," she said quietly, stepping between the two men, "listen to your
  child. I will not excuse my love, it needs no apology. It is as innocent and
  heavenly as are the stars. My love is the life of my life. You know me; truth
  is the air I breathe. By my soul! I will never leave this man!"</p>

  <p>"Nor I her!" cried Totila, and took her right-hand.</p>

  <p>The young couple stood erect before the old man in the bright moonlight,
  their noble features filled with sacred enthusiasm. They looked so beautiful
  that a softened feeling took possession of the angry father.</p>

  <p>"Valeria, my child!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my father! you have led all my childish steps with such untiring love
  that till now I have scarcely missed, though I have deeply regretted, my lost
  mother. At this moment I miss her for the first time; for now I feel that I
  need her advocacy. At least let her memory plead for me. Let me bring her
  picture before you, and remind you of the time when, dying, she called you
  for the last time to her bedside, and, as you have often told me, confided to
  you my happiness as a holy legacy."</p>

  <p>Valerius pressed his right hand to his forehead; his daughter ventured to
  take the other; he did not repulse her. Evidently a struggle was going on in
  his mind. At last he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Valeria, without knowing it, you have pleaded strongly. It would be
  unjust to withhold from you a fact upon which you have mysteriously touched.
  Your mother's vow, which, however, we had long since annulled, still
  oppressed her soul. 'If our child,' she said, 'is not to be the bride of
  Heaven, at least swear to me to honour the freedom of her choice. I know how
  Roman girls, particularly in our rank of life, are given in marriage unasked,
  without love. Such an union is misery on earth and a sin before God. My
  Valeria will choose nobly; swear to me to give her to the husband of her
  choice, and to no other!'&mdash;and I Swore it. But to give my child to a
  barbarian, to an enemy of Italy! no, no!" And he broke from her grasp.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am not so barbarous, Valerius, as you think," began Totila. "At
  least I am the warmest friend of the Romans in all my nation. Believe me, I
  do not hate you; those whom I abhor are your worst enemies as well as
  ours&mdash;the Byzantines!"</p>

  <p>It was a happy speech, for in the heart of the old republican the hatred
  of Byzantium was the reverse side to his love of freedom and Italy. He was
  silent, but his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the youth.</p>

  <p>"My father," said Valeria, "your child could love no barbarian. Learn to
  know Totila; and if you still call him a barbarian&mdash;I will never become
  his. I ask nothing of you but this: learn to know him. Decide for yourself
  whether my choice be noble. He is beloved by all the Goths, and all men are
  friendly to him&mdash;surely you alone will not reject him?"</p>

  <p>Again she took her father's hand.</p>

  <p>"Oh, learn to know me, Valerius!" begged Totila earnestly, taking his
  other hand.</p>

  <p>The old man sighed. At length he said: "Come with me to your mother's
  grave, Valeria; there it is amongst the cypresses; there stands the urn
  containing her heart. Let us think of her&mdash;the noblest woman who ever
  lived&mdash;and appeal to her shade. And if your love prove to be true and
  well placed, then I will perform what I have promised."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-23"
     name="b2-23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">A few weeks later, we find Cethegus in the well-known room
  containing the statue of Cæsar, together with our new acquaintance, Petros,
  the ambassador of the Emperor Justinian, or rather of the Empress.</p>

  <p>The two men had shared a simple meal and had emptied a flask of old
  Massikian together, exchanging reminiscences of past times&mdash;they had
  been fellow-students, as we already know&mdash;and had just left the
  dinner-room for the study of Cethegus, in order, undisturbed by the
  attendants, to talk over more confidential affairs.</p>

  <p>"As soon as I had convinced myself," said Cethegus, concluding his account
  of late events, "that the alarming reports from Ravenna were only
  rumours&mdash;perhaps inventions, and, at all events, exaggerated&mdash;I
  opposed the utmost coolness to the excitement and zeal of my friends. Lucius
  Lucinius, with his fiery temper and foolish enthusiasm, almost spoilt
  everything. He repeatedly demanded that I should accept the office of
  Dictator, and literally put his sword to my breast, shouting that I should be
  compelled to serve the fatherland. He let out so many secrets, that it was
  fortunate the dark Corsican&mdash;who seems to stick to the Goths, no one
  knows why&mdash;took him to be more drunk than he really was. At last news
  came that Amalaswintha had returned, and so people and Senate gradually
  became more calm."</p>

  <p>"And you," said Petros, "have saved Rome for the second time from the
  revenge of the barbarians&mdash;a service which can never be forgotten, and
  for which all the world, but most of all the Queen, must thank you."</p>

  <p>"The Queen&mdash;poor woman!" answered Cethegus, shrugging his shoulders.
  "Who knows how long the Goths, or your imperial master at Byzantium, will
  leave her upon her throne?"</p>

  <p>"What! You mistake entirely!" interrupted Petros eagerly. "My embassy was
  intended, above all other things, to support her government; and I was just
  upon the point of asking your advice," he added cunningly, "as to how this
  can best be done."</p>

  <p>But the Prefect leaned back his head against the marble wall, and looked
  with a smile at the ambassador.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Petros! oh, Peter!" he said. "Why so secret? I thought we knew each
  other better."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked the Byzantine, embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"I mean that we have not studied law and history together at Berytus and
  Athens in vain. I mean that at that time we already, while working together
  and exchanging our wise thoughts, came to the conclusion that the Emperor
  must drive out these barbarians, and rule again in Rome as he does in
  Byzantium. And as I think now just as I did then, you also will surely not
  have become a different man."</p>

  <p>"I must subject my views to those of my master; and
  Justinian&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Naturally burns to rule in Italy."</p>

  <p>"But certainly," said Petros, much embarrassed, "cases might
  occur&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Peter," said Cethegus, now rising indignantly, "use no phrases and no
  lies with me; they do no good. See, Petros, this is your old fault; you are
  ever too cunning to be wise. You think that you must always lie, and are
  never courageous enough to be truthful. How can you pretend to me that the
  Emperor does not mean to have Italy again? Whether he will uphold or
  overthrow the Queen depends upon whether he thinks he will reach his goal
  more easily with or without her. What his opinion is I am not to know. But,
  in spite of all your cunning, the next time we meet I will tell you to your
  face what he intends to do."</p>

  <p>A wicked and bitter smile played upon the ambassador's thin lips.</p>

  <p>"Still as proud as ever you were in the schools of logic at Athens," he
  said spitefully.</p>

  <p>"Yes; and at Athens, you know, I was always the first, Procopius the
  second, and you came third."</p>

  <p>Syphax just then entered the room.</p>

  <p>"A veiled woman, sir," he said, "awaits you in the Hall of Jupiter."</p>

  <p>Glad that the conversation was thus interrupted, for he did not feel
  capable of arguing with the Prefect, Petros said, with a grin:</p>

  <p>"I wish you joy of such an interruption."</p>

  <p>"Yes, for your own sake," answered Cethegus, smiling; and left the
  room.</p>

  <p>"You shall one day repent your sarcasm, haughty man!" thought the
  Byzantine.</p>

  <p>In the hall&mdash;which received the name of Jupiter from a beautiful
  statue, sculptured by Glycon of Athens&mdash;Cethegus found a woman, clad
  richly in the Gothic costume. On his entrance, she threw back the cowl of her
  brown mantle.</p>

  <p>"Princess Gothelindis!" cried the Prefect in surprise. "What leads you to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Revenge!" she answered, in a hoarse voice, and advanced towards him.</p>

  <p>Her features were sharp, but not plain; she would even have been called
  beautiful, but that her left eye was utterly destroyed, and the whole of her
  left cheek disfigured by a long scar. The wound seemed to bleed afresh as her
  cheeks flushed while pronouncing the angry word. Such deadly hatred shone
  from her grey eye, that Cethegus involuntarily retreated.</p>

  <p>"Revenge?" he asked. "On whom?"</p>

  <p>"On&mdash;of that later. Forgive that I disturb you," she added, composing
  herself. "Your friend Petros of Byzantium is with you, is he not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but how do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! I saw him enter your door before supper," she answered, with assumed
  indifference.</p>

  <p>"That is not true," said Cethegus to himself; "for he was brought in by
  the garden-gate. So they have made an appointment here, and I was not to know
  it. What can they want with me?"</p>

  <p>"I will not keep you long," continued Gothelindis. "I have only one
  question to ask of you. Answer briefly, 'yes' or 'no.' I have the power to
  ruin that woman&mdash;the daughter of Theodoric&mdash;and I have the will.
  Are you for me in this, or against me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! friend Petros," thought the Prefect. "Now I already know what you
  intend to do with Amalaswintha. But we will see how far you have
  gone.&mdash;Gothelindis," he said aloud, "I readily believe that you wish to
  ruin the Gothic Queen; but I doubt if you can do so."</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, and then decide whether I can or no. The woman has caused
  the three dukes to be murdered."</p>

  <p>Cethegus shrugged his shoulders. "Many people think that."</p>

  <p>"But I can prove it."</p>

  <p>"You don't say so?" exclaimed Cethegus incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Duke Thulun, as you know, did not die immediately. He was attacked on the
  Aemilian Way, near my villa at Tannetum. My husbandmen found him and brought
  him into my house. You know that he was my cousin&mdash;I belong to the
  Balthe family. He died in my arms."</p>

  <p>"Well, and what said the sick man in his fever?"</p>

  <p>"Fever! Nothing of the sort! As Duke Thulun fell, he wounded his murderer,
  who was not able to fly far. My husbandmen sought for him, and found him
  dying in the nearest wood. He confessed everything to me."</p>

  <p>Cethegus imperceptibly compressed his lips.</p>

  <p>"Well? What was he? What did he say?"</p>

  <p>"He was an Isaurian mercenary," said Gothelindis sharply, "an overlooker
  of the works on the ramparts at Rome, and he said, 'Cethegus, the Prefect,
  sent me to the Queen, and the Queen sent me to Duke Thulun!'"</p>

  <p>"Who heard his confession besides you?" asked Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"No one. And no one shall know of this, if you stand by me. But if not,
  then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gothelindis," interrupted the Prefect, "no threats! They are of no use.
  You must comprehend that they can only aggravate, but not control me. In case
  of need, I would allow it to come to an open accusation. You are known as the
  bitter enemy of Amalaswintha, and your evidence alone&mdash;you were
  imprudent enough to confess that no one else heard the declaration of the
  dying man&mdash;would ruin neither her nor me. You cannot force me to act
  against the Queen; at the most, you could persuade me, if you can show that
  it would be to my advantage. And to do this, I myself will propose an ally to
  you. You certainly know Petros, my friend?"</p>

  <p>"Very well; long since."</p>

  <p>"Permit me to fetch him to this conference."</p>

  <p>He returned to his study.</p>

  <p>"Petros, my visitor is the Princess Gothelindis, the wife of Theodahad.
  She wishes to speak to both of us. Do you know her?"</p>

  <p>"I? oh no. I have never seen her," answered Petros quickly.</p>

  <p>"'Tis well; follow me."</p>

  <p>As soon as they entered the hall, Gothelindis cried out:</p>

  <p>"Welcome, old friend! What a surprising meeting!"</p>

  <p>Petros was dumb. Cethegus, his hands clasped behind his back, enjoyed the
  confusion of the Byzantine.</p>

  <p>"Do you see, Petros? always too cunning, always unnecessary subtleties!
  But come, do not be so cast down by the discovery of a trick. So you two have
  combined together for the Queen's ruin. You wish to persuade me to help you.
  But before doing so, I must know your intentions exactly. Whom will you place
  upon Amalaswintha's throne? For the way is not yet open for Justinian."</p>

  <p>Both were silent for some moments. His clear perception of the situation
  surprised them. At last Gothelindis spoke:</p>

  <p>"Theodahad, my husband, the last of the Amelungs."</p>

  <p>"Theodahad, the last of the Amelungs," Cethegus repeated slowly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, he considered all the advantages and disadvantages of this
  plan. He reflected that Theodahad, unloved by the Goths, and raised to the
  throne by Petros, would soon be entirely in the power of the Byzantines, and
  that the catastrophe would be brought about in a different manner and earlier
  than he intended. He reflected that he must at all events keep the armies of
  the East Romans at a distance for the longest possible time, and he decided
  to keep up the present state of things and support Amalaswintha, because thus
  he would gain time for his preparations. All this he had thought over,
  weighed, and decided upon, in a few moments.</p>

  <p>"And how will you commence proceedings?" he asked gravely.</p>

  <p>"We shall desire the Queen to abdicate in favour of my husband,
  threatening, in case of refusal, to accuse her of murder."</p>

  <p>"And if she runs the risk?"</p>

  <p>"We will carry out our threat," said Petros, "and raise a storm amongst
  the Goths, which will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cost her her life!" cried Gothelindis.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps cost her her throne," said Cethegus, "but hardly give it to
  Theodahad. No, if the Goths are allowed to <i>choose</i> a king, he will not
  bear the name of 'Theodahad.'"</p>

  <p>"That is too true," said Gothelindis angrily.</p>

  <p>"Then there might easily come a king who would be much less welcome to us
  all than Amalaswintha. And therefore I tell you openly, I am not on your
  side; I will uphold the Queen."</p>

  <p>"Then there is war between us," cried Gothelindis grimly, and turned
  towards the door. "Come, Petros."</p>

  <p>"Softly, friends," said the Byzantine. "Perhaps Cethegus will change his
  mind when he has read this paper," and he gave the Prefect the letter which
  Alexandros had brought from Amalaswintha to Justinian.</p>

  <p>Cethegus read; his features darkened.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Petros sarcastically, "will you still support the Queen, who
  has vowed your ruin? Where would you be if she carried out her plan, and your
  friends did not watch over you?"</p>

  <p>Cethegus scarcely listened to him.</p>

  <p>"Pitiful fellow," he thought, "as if it were that! as if the Queen were
  not quite right! as if I could blame her for it! But the imprudent woman has
  already done what I only feared from Theodahad. She has ruined herself, and
  frustrated all my plans; she has already called the Byzantines into the
  country, and now they will come, whether she will or no. As long as
  Amalaswintha reigns, Justinian will play the part of her protector." And now
  he turned, in seeming consternation, to the ambassador, and, giving him the
  letter back, asked: "And if she carries out her intention, when could your
  troops land?"</p>

  <p>"Belisarius is already on the way to Sicily," said Petros, proud of having
  abashed the Prefect; "in a week he can anchor before Portus."</p>

  <p>"Unheard of!" cried Cethegus, this time in real dismay.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Gothelindis, who had meanwhile read the letter, "those
  whom you would uphold wish to ruin you. Be beforehand with them."</p>

  <p>"In the name of my Emperor," said Petros, "I summon you to help me to
  destroy this kingdom of the Goths, and to restore to Italy her freedom. You
  and your talent are valued as they ought to be at the Emperor's court, and,
  after the victory, Justinian promises you&mdash;the dignity of a senator at
  Byzantium."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible?" cried Cethegus. "But not even this highest; of honours
  drives me with such eagerness into your plans as my indignation against the
  ungrateful Queen, who in reward for all my services, threatens my
  life.&mdash;But are you sure?" he asked anxiously, "that Belisarius will not
  land at once?"</p>

  <p>"Do not be uneasy," answered Petros; "it is my hand that will beckon, when
  it is time. First, Amalaswintha must be replaced by Theodahad."</p>

  <p>"That is well," thought Cethegus; "with time all is won, and the
  Byzantines shall not land until I can receive them at the head of Italy in
  arms.&mdash;I am yours," he added aloud, turning to Gothelindis, "and I think
  I can bring Amalaswintha to set the crown upon your husband's head with her
  own hands. She shall resign the sceptre."</p>

  <p>"The Queen will never do that!" cried Gothelindis.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps! Her generosity is still greater than her ambition. It is
  possible to ruin one's enemies through their virtues," said Cethegus
  thoughtfully. "I am now sure of the thing, and I greet you, Queen of the
  Goths!" he concluded, with a slight bow.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b2-24"
     name="b2-24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">After the removal of the three dukes, Amalaswintha had
  maintained an expectant attitude. Although by the fall of the heads of the
  aristocratic opposition she had obtained some freedom of action, yet the
  National Assembly at Regeta, near Rome, was soon to be held, when she must
  either completely exculpate herself from all suspicion of murder, or lose her
  crown, and perhaps her life. Only until the assembly had taken place did
  Witichis and his adherents promise her their protection. She therefore made
  every effort to strengthen her position before the decisive moment arrived.
  She hoped nothing more from Cethegus; she had seen through his selfish
  motives.</p>

  <p>But she hoped that the Italians and the conspirators of the Catacombs, at
  the head of whose members her own name figured, would prefer her rule, so
  friendly to the Romans, to that of a king who belonged to the Gothic national
  party. She ardently longed for the arrival of the body-guard from the
  Emperor, which would protect her in the first moment of danger; and she was
  zealously employed in increasing the number of her friends amongst the Goths
  themselves. She invited many of her father's old followers&mdash;zealous
  adherents of the Amelungs, grey old warriors of great influence with the
  people, brothers-at-arms and almost play-fellows of old Hildebrand&mdash;to
  return to Ravenna; particularly the white-bearded Grippa, Theodoric's
  cupbearer, whose fame was scarcely less influential than that of the old
  master-at-arms. She overwhelmed him and his comrades with honours, confided
  the castle of Ravenna to their care, and made them swear to keep faith with
  the Amelung family. As this connection with popular names was to form a sort
  of counterbalance to the influence of Witichis, Hildebrand and their
  friends&mdash;and Witichis could not justly prevent her from distinguishing
  the old friends of Theodoric with honours&mdash;so the Queen also looked
  about for aid against the family of the Balthes and their revenge. With sharp
  discernment she perceived that this could best be procured from the Wölfungs,
  whose family possessed great influence and riches in central Italy. At that
  time the heads of this family were two brothers, Duke Guntharis and Earl
  Arahad.</p>

  <p>To win their alliance she had thought of a peculiarly effective means. For
  the friendship of the Wölfungs she would offer no less a price than the hand
  of her beautiful daughter.</p>

  <p>In a richly decorated room at Ravenna the mother and daughter were engaged
  in an earnest but not amicable conversation on this subject.</p>

  <p>The Queen was measuring the narrow apartment with hasty steps; all her
  usual repose of manner gone. She frequently threw an angry look at the
  beautiful girl, who, leaning against a marble table, stood quietly before her
  with downcast eyelids.</p>

  <p>"Reflect well," cried Amalaswintha angrily, and suddenly standing still,
  "reflect once more! I give you three days' time."</p>

  <p>"It is in vain. I shall always speak as I have done to-day," said
  Mataswintha without raising her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Then tell me, what have you to say against Earl Arahad?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except that I cannot love him."</p>

  <p>The Queen did not seem to hear her.</p>

  <p>"This is quite a different case from the other, when we would have had you
  marry Cyprianus," she said. "He was old and&mdash;which perhaps in your eyes
  was a greater disadvantage," she added bitterly&mdash;"a Roman."</p>

  <p>"And yet I was banished to Tarentum because I refused him."</p>

  <p>"I hoped that severity would have induced you to change your mind. For
  months I kept you away from my court, from my motherly heart." A bitter smile
  curled Mataswintha's lovely mouth. "In vain," continued the Queen. "I now
  call you back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You err. My brother Athalaric called me back!"</p>

  <p>"I now offer you another husband. Young, handsome, a Goth of the purest
  nobility, his rank is at this moment the second in the kingdom. You know, at
  least you suspect, how sorely my throne, surrounded by enemies, needs
  protection. He and his powerful brother promise us the help of their whole
  army. Earl Arahad loves you, and you, you refuse him! Tell me why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I do not love him."</p>

  <p>"A girl's stupid speech! You are a King's daughter; you ought to sacrifice
  yourself to your rank, to your kingdom."</p>

  <p>"I am a woman," answered Mataswintha, raising her sparkling eyes, "and
  will sacrifice my heart to no power in heaven or on earth!"</p>

  <p>"And thus speaks my daughter? Look at me, foolish child. I have striven
  after great things, and have attained much. As long as men admire what is
  great, they will name my name. I have won all that life can offer, and yet I
  never&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Loved! I know it," sighed her daughter.</p>

  <p>"You know it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; it was the curse of my childhood! I was indeed still a child when my
  father died. I knew not how to express it, but even then I could feel that
  his heart missed something, when, sighing deeply, he embraced Athalaric and
  me, and sighed again. And I loved him all the more tenderly because I felt
  that he sought love most where it was wanting. Now indeed I know what then I
  could not explain to myself. You became our father's wife, because, after
  Theodoric, he stood next to the throne. Ambition, and not love, led you to
  his arms, and you could only give cold pride in return for his warm
  affection."</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha was startled, and stopped again in her restless walk.</p>

  <p>"You are very bold!" she said.</p>

  <p>"I am your daughter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You speak of love so familiarly&mdash;you seem to know it at twenty
  better than I at fifty. You love!" she cried suddenly, "and thence comes this
  obstinacy!"</p>

  <p>Mataswintha blushed and was silent.</p>

  <p>"Speak," cried her angry mother; "confess it or deny it."</p>

  <p>Mataswintha cast down her eyes and still kept silence. She had never
  looked more beautiful.</p>

  <p>"Will you deny the truth? Are you afraid, you, a daughter of the
  Amelungs?"</p>

  <p>The girl proudly raised her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid and I do not deny the truth. Yes, I love."</p>

  <p>"And whom, unhappy girl?"</p>

  <p>"Not even a god could force me to tell that!"</p>

  <p>She looked so decided that Amalaswintha did not attempt to learn more.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "my daughter has no common nature. So I demand of you
  what is uncommon: to sacrifice all to the highest."</p>

  <p>"Mother, I cherish a noble dream in my heart. To me it is the highest. To
  it I will sacrifice all."</p>

  <p>"Mataswintha," said the Queen, "how unqueenly! See, God has blessed you
  above thousands with beauty of body and mind. You are born to be a
  queen."</p>

  <p>"I will be a queen of love. All praise my beauty. I have proposed to
  myself, loving and beloved, happy and bestowing happiness, to be a true
  woman!"</p>

  <p>"A woman? is that all your ambition?"</p>

  <p>"It is. Oh, would it had been yours!"</p>

  <p>"And the realm is nothing to you, the grandchild of Theodoric? Your
  nation, the Goths, are they of no account?"</p>

  <p>"No, mother," said Mataswintha quietly; "it grieves me, it almost makes me
  ashamed, but I cannot pretend what I do not feel. The word 'Goth' arouses no
  sentiment in me. Perhaps it is not my fault; you have always despised these
  Goths and valued these 'barbarians' lightly; that was my first impression; it
  is enduring. And I hate this crown, this kingdom of the Goths; it has taken
  the place of my father, of my brother, and of myself in your heart! The
  Gothic crown has never been anything to me but a hated and inimical
  power."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my child, woe to me if I am guilty of this! If you will not do it for
  the sake of our kingdom, oh, do it for my sake! I am lost without these
  Wölfungs. Do it for the sake of my love!" And she took her daughter's
  hand.</p>

  <p>Mataswintha drew back with a bitter smile:</p>

  <p>"Mother, do not blaspheme that holy name! Your love? You have never loved
  me. Nor my brother, nor my father."</p>

  <p>"My child! What should I have loved if not you?"</p>

  <p>"The crown, mother, and the hated monarchy! How often have you repulsed me
  before Athalaric's birth, because I was a girl, and you wished for a
  crown-prince. Think of my father's grave and of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cease!" cried Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>"And Athalaric? Have you ever loved him? Have you not rather loved his
  right to the throne? Oh, how often have we poor children wept, when we sought
  the mother and found the Queen!"</p>

  <p>"You never complained to me! you do it only now, when I ask you for the
  sacrifice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mother, even now it was not for yourself, only for your crown and throne.
  Put off the crown and you are free from all care. It has brought us no
  happiness, only pain. You are not threatened&mdash;I would sacrifice
  everything for you&mdash;but only your throne, only the golden diadem, the
  idol of your heart, the curse of my life! Never will I sacrifice my love to
  this hated crown, never, never, never!" And she crossed her white arms over
  her bosom as if she would protect her love thus from all assailers.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" cried the Queen indignantly, "selfish, heartless child! you confess
  that you have no feeling for your people, no pride in the crown of your great
  ancestors! You will not voluntarily obey the voice of honour; well then, obey
  force! You deny my love? then feel my severity! You will leave Ravenna at
  once with your attendants. You will go to Florentia, as the guest of Duke
  Guntharis; his wife has invited you. Earl Arahad will accompany you on your
  journey. Leave me. Time will bend your stubborn will!"</p>

  <p>"No power can do that," said Mataswintha, proudly raising her head, and
  she left the room.</p>

  <p>The Queen looked after her silently. Her daughter's reproofs had made a
  greater impression upon her than she was willing to allow.</p>

  <p>"Ambition?" she said to herself. "No, it is not that which fills my soul.
  I feel that I could protect my realm and render it happy, and truly I could
  sacrifice my life, as well as my crown, if the well-being of my nation
  demanded it. Could I not?" she asked herself, doubtfully laying her hand upon
  her heart.</p>

  <p>She was roused from her reverie by Cassiodorus, who entered with bent head
  and slow steps.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Amalaswintha, struck by the sad expression of his face, "do
  you come to tell me of a misfortune?"</p>

  <p>"No; only to ask a question."</p>

  <p>"What question?"</p>

  <p>"Queen," the old man solemnly commenced, "I have served you and your
  father faithfully for thirty years. I, a Roman, have served the barbarians,
  for I honoured your virtues, and believed that Italy, no longer capable of
  self-government, would flourish best under your rule, for your rule was just
  and mild. I continued to serve you, even when the blood of my best
  friends&mdash;and, as I believe, the most innocent blood&mdash;was shed. But
  they died by law, and not by treachery. I was obliged to honour your father,
  even where I could not praise him. But now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now? but now?" repeated the Queen proudly.</p>

  <p>"I come now to beg from my friend, may I say my scholar&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You may," answered the Queen, softened.</p>

  <p>"To beg great Theodoric's noble daughter to speak one single word, a
  'yes.' If you can say this 'yes.'&mdash;and I pray to God that you
  can&mdash;then I will serve you as faithfully as ever, so long as my grey
  hairs are spared."</p>

  <p>"And if not?"</p>

  <p>"And if not, O Queen," answered the old man sadly&mdash;"oh, then farewell
  to you, and to my last joy in this world!"</p>

  <p>"What have you to ask?"</p>

  <p>"Amalaswintha, you know that I was far away on the northern frontiers of
  the realm, when the rebellion here broke out, when that terrible rumour
  arose, and that fearful accusation was made. I believed nothing&mdash;I
  hurried here from Tridentum&mdash;I arrived two days ago, and not an hour
  passes, not a Goth do I meet, but a terrible doubt falls heavily upon my
  heart. And you, too, are changed; restless, inconstant&mdash;and yet I cannot
  believe it. One sincere word of yours will dispel all these mists."</p>

  <p>"Why use so many words?" she cried, supporting herself on the arm of her
  chair. "Ask briefly what you have to ask."</p>

  <p>"Say but one simple 'yes.' Are you guiltless of the death of the three
  dukes?"</p>

  <p>"And if I were not, have they not richly deserved their fate?"</p>

  <p>"Amalaswintha&mdash;I beseech you&mdash;say 'yes.'"</p>

  <p>"You take a very sudden interest in the Gothic rebels!"</p>

  <p>"I beseech you," cried the old man, falling on his knees, "daughter of
  Theodoric, say 'yes,' if you can!"</p>

  <p>"Rise!" she cried, turning away with a frown. "You have no right to
  question me thus."</p>

  <p>"No," said the old man quietly, and rising from his knees. "No, not now.
  From this moment I no longer belong to this world."</p>

  <p>"Cassiodorus!" cried the Queen, alarmed.</p>

  <p>"Here are the keys of my rooms in the palace. There you will find all the
  gifts that I have received from you and Theodoric; the documents which assert
  my dignities, and my seals of office. I go!"</p>

  <p>"Whither, my old friend, oh, whither?"</p>

  <p>"To the cloister which I founded at Squillacium, in Apulia. Henceforward,
  far from kings and their deeds, I shall only do God's work upon earth. My
  soul has long since panted for peace, and now I have nothing left on earth
  that is dear to me. Accept once more my advice at parting: put away the
  sceptre from your blood-stained hands. You can bless this realm no longer,
  you can only bring a curse upon the nation. Think of the salvation of your
  soul, and may God be gracious to you!" And before the Queen could recover
  from her consternation, he had disappeared.</p>

  <p>She would have hurried after him to call him back but she was met at the
  door by Petros, the ambassador.</p>

  <p>"Stay, Queen," he said in a low and rapid voice, "stay and hear me. I have
  no time to lose. I am followed."</p>

  <p>"Who follows you?"</p>

  <p>"People who do not mean so well by you as I do. Deceive yourself no more;
  the fate of the kingdom is decided; you can hinder it no longer, so save for
  yourself what you can. I repeat my proposal."</p>

  <p>"What proposal?"</p>

  <p>"You heard it yesterday."</p>

  <p>"That treacherous advice! Never! I shall report it to your master, the
  Emperor, and beg him to recall you. With you I will confer no more."</p>

  <p>"Queen, this is not the moment to spare you. The next ambassador of
  Justinian is called Belisarius, and he will come with an army!"</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" cried the forsaken Queen. "I recall my petition."</p>

  <p>"Too late. The fleet of Belisarius already lies off Sicily. The proposal
  which you thought came from me you have rejected. Learn that the Emperor, and
  not I, was the propounder, and meant it as a last token of his favour."</p>

  <p>"Justinian, my friend, my protector, would thus ruin me and my kingdom!"
  cried Amalaswintha, who began to see the terrible truth.</p>

  <p>"Not ruin you, but save you! He will re-conquer this Italy, the cradle of
  the Roman Empire. This unnatural, impossible kingdom of the Goths is
  condemned and lost. Leave the sinking ship. Justinian reaches out to you a
  friendly hand, and the Empress offers you an asylum, if you will deliver
  Neapolis, Rome, Ravenna, and all the fortresses into the hands of Belisarius,
  and consent that the Goths shall be led, disarmed, over the Alps."</p>

  <p>"Wretched man! Shall I betray my people as you have betrayed me? Too late
  I see your schemes; I came to you for help, and you will destroy me!"</p>

  <p>"Not you, only the barbarians."</p>

  <p>"These barbarians are my people; they are my only friends! I see it now,
  and will stand by them to the death."</p>

  <p>"But they will not stand by you."</p>

  <p>"Insolent! Out of my sight! Leave my court!"</p>

  <p>"You will not listen? Reflect, O Queen! only on this condition can I
  answer for your life."</p>

  <p>"My people in arms shall answer for my life!"</p>

  <p>"Hardly. For the last time I ask you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be silent! I will not give up my crown to Justinian without a
  struggle."</p>

  <p>"Well, then," said Petros to himself, "another must, do it. Enter!" he
  called aloud at the entrance.</p>

  <p>But Cethegus alone appeared from behind the curtain.</p>

  <p>"Where is Gothelindis? Where is Theodahad?" whispered Petros.</p>

  <p>"I left them outside the palace. The two women hate each other too
  bitterly. Their passion would spoil all."</p>

  <p>"You are not my good angel, Prefect of Rome," said Amalaswintha, turning
  away from him gloomily, as he approached.</p>

  <p>"This time perhaps I am," whispered Cethegus, going close up to her. "You
  have rejected the proposals from Byzantium, as I expected you would. Dismiss
  that false Greek."</p>

  <p>At a sign from the Queen, Petros retired into an ante-room.</p>

  <p>"What would you with me, Cethegus? I trust you no longer."</p>

  <p>"You have trusted the Emperor instead of me, and you see the
  consequences."</p>

  <p>"I do indeed," she answered in deep grief.</p>

  <p>"Queen, I have never deceived you in this: that I love Italy and Rome more
  than the Goths. You will remember that I never concealed it from you."</p>

  <p>"I know it, and do not blame you."</p>

  <p>"My dearest wish is to see Italy free. In order to keep the Emperor off, I
  would uphold your government; but I tell you openly that there is now no hope
  of this. If you proclaim war against Byzantium, the Goths will no more obey
  or the Italians trust you."</p>

  <p>"And why not? What separates me from the Italians and my people?"</p>

  <p>"Your own acts: two unfortunate documents, which, are in Justinian's
  hands. You yourself first called his arms into Italy&mdash;a body-guard from
  Byzantium!"</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha grew pale.</p>

  <p>"You know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately not I alone, but my friends, the conspirators of the
  Catacombs. Petros showed them, the letter, and they call down curses upon
  you."</p>

  <p>"Then my Goths, at least, remain to me!"</p>

  <p>"No longer. Not alone do the adherents of the Balthes seek your life; but
  the conspirators of Rome have sworn, as soon as war breaks out, to announce
  to all the world that your name stands at the head of their conspiracy
  against the Goths&mdash;against your own nation! The document, with your
  signature, is in my hands no longer; it lies in the archives of the
  conspirators."</p>

  <p>"Faithless man!"</p>

  <p>"How could I know that you treated with Byzantium behind my back, and thus
  made enemies of my friends? You see that Byzantium, the Goths, and Italy are
  all against you. If the war break out under your direction, division will run
  rife in Italy. No one will obey you, and the kingdom will fall helpless into
  the hands of Belisarius. Amalaswintha, there must be a sacrifice! I demand it
  of you in the name of Italy, in the name of your people and of mine."</p>

  <p>"What sacrifice? I consent to any."</p>

  <p>"The greatest sacrifice&mdash;your crown. Give it to a man who is capable
  of uniting the Goths and Italians against Byzantium, and save both
  nations."</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha looked at him searchingly. A terrible struggle took place in
  her soul.</p>

  <p>"My crown? It is very dear to me," she said.</p>

  <p>"I always held Amalaswintha capable of any sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"Dare I place confidence in your advice?"</p>

  <p>"If it were sweet, you might doubt it; if I flattered your pride you might
  mistrust me. But I offer you the bitter cup of renunciation. I appeal to your
  generosity and courage. Make me not ashamed."</p>

  <p>"Your last advice was a crime," cried Amalaswintha, shuddering.</p>

  <p>"I preserved your throne by every possible means as long as it could be
  upheld, as long as it was necessary for Italy; and I now demand that you
  should love your people more than your sceptre."</p>

  <p>"By God! there you do not err. For my people I have not hesitated to
  sacrifice the lives of others"&mdash;she gladly dwelt on this thought, which
  appeased her conscience&mdash;"and I shall not refuse now to sacrifice my
  personal ambition. But who will be my successor?"</p>

  <p>"Your heir, to whom the crown belongs&mdash;Theodahad, the last of the
  Amelungs."</p>

  <p>"What! that feeble creature?"</p>

  <p>"He is no hero, it is true; but heroes will obey the nephew of Theodoric
  if you place him on the throne. And, consider, his Roman education has won
  the Italians for him; they will stand by him. They would both fear and hate a
  king after Hildebrand's heart."</p>

  <p>"And rightly," answered the Queen reflectively. "But Gothelindis,
  Queen!"</p>

  <p>Cethegus came nearer, and looked keenly into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Amalaswintha is not so mean as to nourish a pitiful feminine enmity when
  there is need of a noble resolve. You have ever appeared to me nobler than
  your sex. Now prove it, and decide."</p>

  <p>"Not now," said Amalaswintha. "My head burns and my brain is confused. Let
  me alone to-night. You believe me capable of self-sacrifice. I thank you for
  that at least. To-morrow I will decide."</p>

  <h2><a id="b3"

  <p class="cp">"It seemed to Theodahad that to have neighbours was a kind of
  misfortune."<br>

  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="b3-1"
     name="b3-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">The morning after the events before described, a manifesto
  announced to the astonished inhabitants of Ravenna that the daughter of
  Theodoric had resigned the crown in favour of her cousin Theodahad, the last
  male scion o£ the House of Amelung.</p>

  <p>Italians and Goths were summoned to swear the oath of allegiance to their
  new sovereign.</p>

  <p>Cethegus had judged rightly. Amalaswintha had felt her conscience
  oppressed by many a folly, and even by deadly sin. Noble natures seek
  consolation and atonement in sacrifice and self-denial; and the unhappy woman
  had been much affected by the reproaches of her daughter and Cassiodorus;
  therefore the Prefect had found her in a mood favourable for the reception of
  his advice. The very bitterness of this advice induced her to follow it;
  indeed, to save her people and expiate her guilt, she would even have endured
  much greater humiliation.</p>

  <p>The change of dynasty was accomplished without difficulty. The Italians at
  Ravenna were in nowise prepared for rebellion, and Cethegus fed them with
  hopes of a more favourable opportunity. Besides this, the new King was known
  and liked by them as a friend of Roman civilisation.</p>

  <p>The Goths, however, did not seem inclined to submit to the change without
  more ado. Prince Theodahad was certainly a man&mdash;that was in his favour
  and an Amelung, which last circumstance weighed heavily; but he was by no
  means esteemed. Cowardly and unmartial, effeminate in body and mind, he had
  none of the qualities which the Germans require in their kings. One sole
  passion filled his soul&mdash;avarice, insatiable love of gold. Though very
  rich, he was constantly engaged in mean quarrels with his neighbours in
  Tuscany. He well understood the art of increasing his estates by force and
  cunning, and the weight of his royal rank, and how to wrest their property
  from his neighbours; "for," says an author of that period, "it seemed to
  Theodahad that to have neighbours was a kind of misfortune." At the same
  time, his weak nature was entirely subject to that of his wicked but
  strong-minded wife.</p>

  <p>For all these reasons, the worthiest members of the Gothic nation saw the
  accession of such a man to the throne of Theodoric with great dislike; and
  the manifesto had scarcely been published, when Earl Teja, who had shortly
  before returned to Ravenna with Hildebad, summoned the old master-at-arms and
  Witichis, and invited them to arouse and direct the discontent of the people,
  and to set a more worthy man in Theodahad's place.</p>

  <p>"You know," he concluded his exhortation, "how favourable is the temper of
  the people. Since the night of our meeting in the Temple of Mercury, we have
  incessantly stirred up the nation, and have succeeded in many of our efforts.
  The noble self-assertion of Athalaric, the victory of the Feast of Epiphany,
  the prevention of Amalaswintha's escape was all our work. Now a favourable
  opportunity offers. Shall a man who is weaker than a woman step into a
  woman's place? Have we no more worthy man than Theodahad amongst us?"</p>

  <p>"He is right, by Thor and Woden!" cried Hildebad. "Away with these weak
  Amelungs! Raise a hero upon our shield, and hit about on all sides! Away with
  the Amelungs!"</p>

  <p>"No," said Witichis calmly; "not yet. Perhaps it will come to that at
  last; but it must not happen sooner than is necessary. The Amelungs have a
  great party. Theodahad would never part with the riches, nor Gothelindis with
  the power of the crown without a struggle; they are strong enough, if not for
  victory, at least for battle. But strife between brothers is terrible.
  Necessity alone can justify it; and, at present, that does not exist.
  Theodahad may try; he is weak, and may easily be led. There is time enough to
  act if he prove incapable."</p>

  <p>"Who knows if then there will be time?" said Teja warningly.</p>

  <p>"What dost thou advise, old man?" asked Hildebad, upon whose mind the
  remarks of Witichis had not been without effect.</p>

  <p>"Brothers," answered Hildebrand, stroking his long beard, "you have the
  choice, and therefore are plagued with doubt. I am spared both, for I am
  bound. The King's old followers have sworn an oath that, as long as a member
  of his House lives, they will allow no stranger to occupy the throne."</p>

  <p>"What a foolish oath!" cried Hildebad.</p>

  <p>"I am old, and yet I do not call it foolish. I know what a blessing rests
  upon the great and sacred law of inheritance; and the Amelungs are descended
  from the gods!" he added mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"Theodahad is a fine child of the gods!" laughed Hildebad.</p>

  <p>"Be silent!" cried the old man angrily. "You modern men understand this no
  longer. You think you can fathom everything with your miserable reason. The
  mystery, the secrecy, the magic that lies in blood&mdash;for this you have
  lost all sense. Therefore I have held my peace about such things. But you
  cannot change me, with my near a hundred years. Do what you like; I shall do
  what I must."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Earl Teja, yielding, "upon thy head be the responsibility.
  But when this last Amelung is no more&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then the followers of Theodoric are free from their oath."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Witichis, "it is fortunate that your oath spares us the
  choice, for we certainly wish for no ruler whom thou canst not acknowledge.
  Let us then go and pacify the people; and let us bear with this King as long
  as it is possible."</p>

  <p>"But not an hour longer!" cried Teja, and went away in anger.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b3-2"
     name="b3-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">The very same day Theodahad and Gothelindis were crowned
  with the ancient crown of the Goths.</p>

  <p>A splendid banquet, at which all the Roman and Gothic dignitaries of the
  court and city were present, enlivened the old palace and the usually quiet
  gardens, with which we have become acquainted as the scene of Athalaric's and
  Camilla's loves.</p>

  <p>The revel lasted until deep into the night.</p>

  <p>The new King, no friend of the cup, or of barbaric revelry, had retired
  early.</p>

  <p>Gothelindis, on the contrary, sunned herself in the glory of her new rank.
  Proudly she sat upon her high seat, the golden circlet on her dark hair. She
  seemed all ear for the loud hurrahs with which, again and again, her own and
  her husband's names were greeted. But most of all she enjoyed the thought
  that these shouts would penetrate into the royal vault, where Amalaswintha,
  her hated and conquered rival, sat mourning by the sarcophagus of her
  son.</p>

  <p>Among the crowd of such guests as need only a full cup to make them merry,
  many a grave face was to be seen; many a Roman who would rather have seen the
  Emperor Justinian upon the throne at the head of the table; many a Goth who,
  in the present precarious condition of affairs, could not do homage to such a
  King as Theodahad without anxiety.</p>

  <p>To these last belonged Witichis, whose thoughts seemed far absent from the
  splendid scene around him. The golden cup before him stood untouched, and he
  scarcely noticed the loud exclamations of Hildebad, who sat opposite him.</p>

  <p>At last&mdash;the lamps were long since lit, and the stars stood in the
  sky&mdash;he rose and went into the greeny darkness of the garden. He slowly
  wandered through the taxus-walks, his eyes fixed upon the sparkling
  luminaries. His heart was with his wife, with his child, whom he had not seen
  for months.</p>

  <p>He wandered on unconsciously, until at last he came to the little Temple
  of Venus by the quay, with which we are already acquainted.</p>

  <p>He looked out over the gleaming sea. All at once something shining at his
  feet attracted his attention. It was the glittering of the moonlight upon a
  small Gothic harp, and upon a suit of mail. A man lay before him upon the
  soft grass, and a pale face was uplifted towards him.</p>

  <p>"Thou here, Teja? Thou wert not at the banquet?"</p>

  <p>"No; I was with the dead."</p>

  <p>"My thoughts, too, were absent; at home with wife and child," said
  Witichis.</p>

  <p>"With wife and child," repeated Teja, sighing.</p>

  <p>"Many asked after thee, Teja."</p>

  <p>"After me? Should I sit by Cethegus, who has robbed me of my honour, or by
  Theodahad, who took inheritance?"</p>

  <p>"Thine inheritance?"</p>

  <p>"At least he possesses it. And over the place where once stood my cradle
  he now drives his ploughshare."</p>

  <p>His head sank upon his breast, and both were silent.</p>

  <p>"And thy harp," at last said Witichis, "will it never be heard again? They
  praise thee as our nation's best minstrel!"</p>

  <p>"Like Gelimer, the last King of the Vandals, who was also the best singer
  of his nation.&mdash;But they shall never lead <i>me</i> in triumph to
  Byzantium!"</p>

  <p>"Thou singest but seldom now?"</p>

  <p>"Seldom or never. But it seems to me time is coming when I shall sing
  again."</p>

  <p>"A time of joy?"</p>

  <p>"A time of deep and final sorrow."</p>

  <p>Again a long pause ensued.</p>

  <p>"My Teja," resumed Witichis, "I have ever found thee, in all trouble of
  peace or war, as true as steel. And although thou art so much younger than
  I&mdash;and an elder man does not lightly bind himself to a youth&mdash;I may
  call thee my best and bosom-friend. I know that thy heart cleaves to me more
  than to thy youthful companions."</p>

  <p>Teja took the speaker's hand and pressed it. "Yes, even when my ways
  perplex thee, thou withholdest not thy respect and sympathy. The
  others&mdash;&mdash; And yet, <i>one</i> of them I love much!"</p>

  <p>"Whom?"</p>

  <p>"He whom all love."</p>

  <p>"Totila?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I love him as the night loves the morning star. But he is so frank,
  that he cannot understand when others are, and must be, reserved."</p>

  <p>"Must be! Why? Thou knowest that curiosity is not my failing. And if, at
  this earnest moment, I beg thee to lift the veil from thy grief, I ask it
  only because I would gladly help and comfort thee, and because a friend's eye
  often sees more clearly than one's own."</p>

  <p>"Help? Help me? Canst thou awaken the dead? My pain is irrevocable as the
  past! Whoever has, like me, seen the unmerciful wheel of Fate roll, crushing
  everything before it, blind and dumb to all tenderness and nobleness; yea,
  even crushing what is noble more easily and readily, because it <i>is</i>
  tender; whoever has acknowledged that a dull necessity, which fools call the
  wise providence of God, rules the universe and the life of mankind, is past
  all help and comfort! If once he has caught the sound, he hears for ever,
  with the sharp ear of despair, the monotonous rumble of the cruel, insensible
  wheel in the centre of the universe, which, at every revolution,
  indifferently produces or destroys life. Whoever has felt this, and lived
  through it, renounces all and for ever. For evermore, nothing can make him
  afraid. But certainly&mdash;he has also for ever forgotten the sweetness of a
  smile."</p>

  <p>"Thou makest me shudder! God forbid that I should ever entertain such a
  delusion! How hast thou acquired, so young, such terrible wisdom?"</p>

  <p>"Friend, by thought alone the truth cannot be reached; only the experience
  of life can teach it. And in order to understand what and how a man thinks,
  it is necessary to know his life. Therefore, that I may not appear to be an
  erring dreamer, or an effeminate weakling, who delights in nursing his
  sorrow&mdash;and in honour of thy trust and friendship&mdash;thou shalt hear
  a small portion of the cause of my grief. The larger part, by far the larger,
  I will keep to myself," he added, in evident pain, and pressing his hand to
  his heart. "The time for that will come too. But now thou shalt only hear how
  the Star of Misfortune, even at my birth, shone over my head. And amidst all
  the million stars above, this one alone remains faithful. Thou wert
  present&mdash;thou wilt remember&mdash;when the false Prefect taunted me
  before the whole assembly with being a bastard, and refused to fight with me.
  I was obliged to endure the insult. I am even worse than a bastard. My
  father, Tagila, was a famous hero, but no noble. Poor, and of low birth. He
  had loved, ever since his beard sprouted, the daughter of his father's
  brother, Gisa. She lived far away on the outermost eastern frontier of the
  realm; on the cold Ister, where continued battles raged with the Gepidæ and
  the wild Sarmatian hordes, and where a man has little time to think of the
  Church, or of the changing laws promulgated by her Conclaves. For a long time
  my father was not able to lead Gisa to his home; ha had nought but his helm
  and spear, and could not pay the tax, nor prepare a home for his wife. At
  last fortune smiled upon him. In the war against the Sarmatians, he conquered
  the king's stronghold on the Alutha, and the rich treasures which the
  Sarmatians had gained by years of plunder, and had there amassed, became his
  booty. In reward of his valour, Theodoric gave him the rank of earl, and
  called him to Italy. My father took with him Gisa, now become his wife, and
  all his treasure, and bought a large and beautiful estate in Tuscany, between
  Florentia and Luca. But his good fortune did not last long. Shortly after my
  birth, some miserable fellow, some cowardly rascal, accused my parents of
  incest before the Bishop of Florentia. They were Catholics, and not
  Arians&mdash;and brothers' children; their marriage was null in the eyes of
  the Church&mdash;and the Church ordered them to part. My father pressed his
  wife to his heart, and laughed at the order. But the secret accuser did not
  rest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who was he?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, would that I knew it! I would reach him, even if he lived amid all
  the horrors of Vesuvius! The priests tormented my mother without cessation,
  and tried to alarm her conscience. In vain; she stood fast by her God and her
  husband, and defied the bishop and his messengers. And whenever my father met
  one of the priests upon his estate, he gave him such a welcome that he took
  care never to come again. But who can strive with those who speak in God's
  name! A last term was appointed; if, by that time, the disobedient couple had
  not separated, they were to be excommunicated, and their property forfeited
  to the Church. My father now hurried in despair to the King, to beg for the
  abolition of the terrible sentence. But the verdict of the Conclave was too
  clear, and Theodoric did not dare to offend the rights of the Orthodox
  Church. When my father returned from Ravenna, he stared in horror at the
  place where once his house had stood: the time had elapsed, and the threat
  had been fulfilled. His home was destroyed, his wife and child had
  disappeared. He madly sought for us all over Italy, and at last, disguised as
  a peasant, he discovered Gisa in a convent at Ticinum. They had torn her boy
  from her arms, and taken him to Rome. My father arranged everything for her
  flight from the convent; at midnight they escaped over the wall of the
  cloister garden. But the next morning the sisters missed their prisoner at
  the <i>hora</i>&mdash;her cell was empty. The convent servants followed the
  track of the horses&mdash;they were overtaken. Fighting desperately, my
  father fell; my mother was taken back to the convent. The pain of her loss
  and the severe discipline of the order had such a terrible effect upon her
  brain, that she went mad and died. Such was the fate of my parents."</p>

  <p>"And thou?"</p>

  <p>"I was discovered in Rome by old Hildebrand, who had been a
  brother-at-arms of my grandfather and father. With the King's assistance, he
  took me from the care of the priests, and brought me up with his own
  grandchildren in Regium."</p>

  <p>"And thy estate, thine inheritance?"</p>

  <p>"Was forfeited to the Church, which sold it, almost as a gift, to
  Theodahad. He was my father's neighbour; he is now my King!"</p>

  <p>"My poor friend! But what happened to you later? I have heard only
  rumours&mdash;thou hast been in Greece&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Teja rose.</p>

  <p>"Let me keep silence on that subject; perhaps another time. I was once
  fool enough to believe in happiness and the beneficence of a loving God. I
  have repented it bitterly. I shall never believe again. Farewell, Witichis,
  and do not blame Teja, if he be different from other men." He pressed the
  hand of his friend warmly; and quickly disappeared into the dark avenues of
  the garden.</p>

  <p>Witichis sat for a long time in silent thought. Then he looked up at the
  sky, seeking in the bright stars a contradiction of the gloomy thoughts which
  his friend's words had aroused in his mind. He longed for their peaceful and
  clear light. But during the conversation, clouds had risen rapidly from the
  lagoons, and covered the sky. All around was dark and dismal. With a sigh,
  Witichis arose, and filled with sad thoughts, sought his lonely couch.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b3-3"
     name="b3-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">While Italians and Goths feasted and drank together in the
  halls on the ground-floor of the palace at Ravenna, they little suspected
  that above their heads, in the King's apartments, a negotiation was going on
  which was to determine the fate of the kingdom.</p>

  <p>The King had left the banquet early, and had retired to his rooms with the
  Byzantine ambassador, and, for a long time, the two were occupied in writing
  and consulting together.</p>

  <p>At last they seemed to have come to an agreement, and Petros was about
  once more to read what he had written, when the King interrupted him:</p>

  <p>"Stop," said the little man, who seemed almost lost in his royal robes,
  "stop&mdash;there is yet another thing."</p>

  <p>And he rose from his seat, softly crossed the room, and looked behind the
  curtain at the entrance to see if any were listening.</p>

  <p>Having reassured himself, he returned, and gently pulled the sleeve of the
  Byzantine. The light of the bronze lamp flickered in the draught, and fell
  upon the withered yellow cheeks of his ugly face, as he cunningly screwed up
  his already small eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yet another thing. If these wholesome changes are to be made, it would be
  well, indeed it is necessary, that some of the most daring of my barbarian
  subjects should be rendered incapable of opposition."</p>

  <p>"I have already thought of that," answered Petros. "There is that old half
  heathen, Hildebrand, that coarse Hildebad, and wise Witichis."</p>

  <p>"You seem to know men well," said Theodahad, "you have looked sharply
  about you. But," he added, "there is one whom you have not mentioned, one who
  must be got rid of more than any other."</p>

  <p>"And he?"</p>

  <p>"Is Earl Teja, the son of Tagila."</p>

  <p>"Is the melancholy dreamer so dangerous?"</p>

  <p>"More so than any of the others. Besides, he is my personal enemy, as was
  his father before him."</p>

  <p>"How so?"</p>

  <p>"His father was my neighbour at Florentia, I wanted his acres. In vain I
  pressed him to give them up. Ha, ha!" and Theodahad laughed, "they became
  mine at last! The holy Church dissolved his criminal marriage, confiscated
  his property, and let me have it cheap. I had deserved well of the Church
  during the process&mdash;your friend, the Bishop of Florentia; can tell you
  the particulars."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Petros. "Why did not the barbarian give his acres up
  with a good will? Does Teja know?"</p>

  <p>"He knows nothing. But he hates me merely because I bought his
  inheritance. He looks black at me, and the gloomy dreamer is just the man to
  strangle an enemy at the very feet of God Himself."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" said Petros, suddenly becoming very thoughtful. "Well, enough of
  him! He shall not hurt us. Let me read the treaty once more, point by point;
  afterwards you can sign it. 'First: King Theodahad resigns the sovereignty of
  Italy, and the subject islands and provinces of the Gothic kingdom, namely:
  Dalmatia, Liburnia, Istria, the second Pannonia, Savia, Noricum, Rhætia, and
  the Gothic provinces in Gaul, in favour of Emperor Justinian, and of his
  successors. He promises to deliver Ravenna, Rome, Neapolis, and all the
  fortresses in the kingdom, into the hands of the Emperor.'"</p>

  <p>Theodahad nodded.</p>

  <p>"'Secondly: King Theodahad will use all the means in his power to the end
  that the Gothic army shall be disarmed and led away, in small parties, over
  the Alps. The women and children will follow the army, or be taken as slaves
  to Byzantium, according to the decision of the imperial generals. The King
  will take care that any resistance on the part of the Goths shall be without
  result. Thirdly: in return, the Emperor Justinian leaves the titles and
  honours of royalty to King Theodahad and his spouse for their lifetime. And
  fourthly&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"I will read this paragraph myself," interrupted Theodahad, and held out
  his hand for the document.</p>

  <p>"'Fourthly: the Emperor leaves to the King of the Goths not only all the
  lands and treasures which the latter possesses as private property, but the
  whole of the royal Gothic treasury, which alone is valued at forty thousand
  pounds of minted gold. Further, the Emperor assigns to Theodahad, as his
  property and inheritance, the whole of Tuscany, from Pistoria to Cære, from
  Populonia to Clusium; and lastly, he makes over to him for life the half of
  all the public revenues of the kingdom thus restored to its rightful
  sovereign.' Tell me, Petros, do not you think that I might demand
  three-fourths?"</p>

  <p>"You might certainly ask it, but I doubt exceedingly that Justinian would
  grant it. I have already overstepped the utmost limits of my power."</p>

  <p>"We will demand it, at all events," said the King, altering the figures,
  "then Justinian must either bargain for less, or grant additional
  privileges."</p>

  <p>A false smile played over the thin lips of the ambassador.</p>

  <p>"You are a clever negotiator, O King," he said. "But in this case you
  reckon wrongly," he added to himself.</p>

  <p>Just at this moment the rustle of trailing garments was heard in the
  marble corridor, and Amalaswintha entered, dressed in a long black mantle and
  a black veil sowed with silver stars. She was deadly pale, but composed and
  dignified; a Queen in spite of having lost her crown. Intense sorrow ennobled
  the expression of her countenance.</p>

  <p>"King of the Goths," she began, "forgive if a dark shadow suddenly rises
  from the realm of the dead to dim your joyous feast. It is for the last
  time."</p>

  <p>Both the men were struck by her appearance.</p>

  <p>"Queen," stammered Theodahad.</p>

  <p>"'Queen!' oh, would that I had never borne the name. I come, cousin, from
  the grave of my noble son, where I have acknowledged my infatuation, and
  repented of all my sins. I come to you, King of the Goths, to warn you
  against similar infatuation and similar guilt."</p>

  <p>Theodahad's unsteady eyes avoided her grave and searching looks.</p>

  <p>"It is an evil guest," she continued, "that I find here as your confidant
  at the hour of midnight. There is no safety for a prince except in his
  people. Too late I have found this out; too late for myself; not too late, I
  hope, for my people. Do not trust Byzantium; it is a shield that crushes him
  whom it should protect."</p>

  <p>"You are unjust," said Petros, "and ungrateful."</p>

  <p>"I beg you, my royal cousin," continued Amalaswintha, unheeding the
  remark, "not to consent to what this man demands. Do not grant him that which
  I refused. We were to surrender Sicily, and furnish three thousand warriors
  to the Emperor for each of his wars. I rejected the shameful proposal. I
  see," she went on, pointing to the document on the table, "that you have
  already concluded your business. Retreat before it is too late; they will
  deceive you always."</p>

  <p>Theodahad uneasily drew the document towards him, and cast a suspicious
  look at Petros. The latter went up to Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>"What do you want here, you queen of yesterday? Would you control the
  ruler of this realm? Your time is past and your power at an end."</p>

  <p>"Leave us," said Theodahad, taking courage. "I will do what I think good.
  You shall not succeed in parting me from my friends at Byzantium. Look here,
  before your very eyes our treaty shall be concluded," And he signed his
  name.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Petros with a smile, "the Princess comes just at the right
  moment to sign as a witness."</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Amalaswintha, "I have come at the right moment to frustrate
  your plan. I will go straightway to the army, to the National Assembly, which
  will soon take place at Regeta. There, before all the nation, I will expose
  your proposals, the plans of the Emperor, and the treachery of this feeble
  man."</p>

  <p>"That will do no good," said Petros quietly, "unless you accuse
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"I <i>will</i> accuse myself. I will confess all my folly, all my guilt,
  and gladly suffer the death I have deserved. But my self-accusation shall
  warn and alarm the whole nation from Etna to the Alps. A world in arms shall
  be opposed to you, and I will save my Goths by my death, from the dangers to
  which my life has exposed them!" And, filled with noble enthusiasm, she
  hurried out of the room.</p>

  <p>Theodahad looked with dismay at the ambassador. For some time he could not
  find a word to say.</p>

  <p>"Advise me, help&mdash;" he stammered out at last.</p>

  <p>"Advise? At this moment there is but one advice to give. That insane woman
  will ruin herself and us if we let her alone. She must not be allowed to
  fulfil her threat. <i>You</i> must take care of that."</p>

  <p>"I?" cried Theodahad, alarmed. "I know nothings about such things! Where
  is Gothelindis? She, and she alone, can help us."</p>

  <p>"And the Prefect," added Petros; "send for both of them."</p>

  <p>Gothelindis and Cethegus were summoned from the banquet. Petros told them
  what the Princess had said, but without mentioning the treaty as the cause of
  her outburst. He had scarcely finished speaking, when Gothelindis cried,
  "Enough! She must not go. Her every step must be watched. She must speak
  neither to Goth nor Roman; she must not leave the palace. That least of all!"
  And she hurried away to place confidential slaves at the doors of
  Amalaswintha's apartments. Presently she returned.</p>

  <p>"She is praying aloud in her cabinet," she cried contemptuously. "Rouse
  yourself, Cethegus, and let us thwart her prayers."</p>

  <p>Cethegus, leaning against the wall, had observed all these proceedings,
  and listened to all that was said in thoughtful silence. He saw how necessary
  it was that he should once more take the reins into his own hands, and hold
  them more firmly. He saw Byzantium pressing more and more into the
  foreground&mdash;and that he could not suffer.</p>

  <p>"Speak, Cethegus," Gothelindis repeated. "What is most necessary?"</p>

  <p>"Clearness of purpose," he answered, standing erect. "In every contract,
  the particular aim of each of the contracting parties must be plain. If not,
  they will continually hinder each other by mistrust. You have your aims, I
  have mine. Yours are evident&mdash;I have already told you what they are.
  You, Petros, wish that Emperor Justinian should rule in Italy in place of the
  Goths. You, Gothelindis and Theodahad, wish so also, on condition that you
  receive a rich recompense in revenge, gold, and honours. But I&mdash;I too,
  have my private aim. What is the use of denying it? My sly Petros, you would
  not long believe that I was only ambitious of serving as your tool, and of
  being a senator in Byzantium. I, too, have my aim, and all your threefold
  cunning would never be able to discover it, because it lies too close to your
  eyes. I must betray it to you myself. My petrified heart still cherishes one
  ideal: Italy! and I, like you, wish the Goths well out of this country. But I
  do not, like you, wish that the Emperor should step unconditionally into
  their shoes. I do not want the deluge instead of the shower. I, the
  inveterate Republican, would like best&mdash;you know, Petros, that we were
  both Republicans at eighteen years of age, and I have remained so; but you
  need not tell it to your master, the Emperor; I have told him myself long
  since&mdash;to cast out the barbarians, bag and baggage, but without letting
  you in. Unfortunately, that is not now possible; we cannot do without your
  help. But I will limit it to the unavoidable. No Byzantine army shall enter
  this country, except&mdash;at the last extremity&mdash;to receive it at the
  hands of the Italians. Italy must be more a gift from the Italians than a
  conquest of the Emperor. The blessing of generals and tax-gatherers, which
  Byzantium would bring upon the land, must be spared us; we want your
  protection, but not your tyranny."</p>

  <p>Over the face of Petros crept a sly smile, which Cethegus seemed not to
  observe. He continued:</p>

  <p>"Hear my conditions. I know that Belisarius lies off Sicily with his
  fleet. He must not land. He must return home. I cannot do with him in Italy;
  at least, not until I call him myself. And if you, Petros, do not at once
  send him the order to return to Byzantium, our ways separate. I know
  Belisarius and Narses, and their military government, and I know what mild
  masters these Goths make. I am sorry for Amalaswintha; she was a mother to my
  people. Therefore choose&mdash;choose between Belisarius and Cethegus. If
  Belisarius lands, Cethegus and all Italy will stand by Amalaswintha and the
  Goths, and then we will see whether you can wrest from us a single foot of
  this soil. If you choose Cethegus, he will break the power of the barbarians,
  and Italy will subject herself to the Emperor, not as his slave, but as his
  consort. Choose, Petros."</p>

  <p>"You proud man!" cried Gothelindis. "You dare to make conditions to me,
  your Queen?" And she lifted her hand with a threatening gesture.</p>

  <p>But Cethegus caught the hand in his iron grasp, and drew it quietly
  down.</p>

  <p>"Leave such antics, you Queen of a day! Here only Italy and Byzantium
  negotiate. If you forget your want of power, you must be reminded of it. You
  reign only so long as we uphold you."</p>

  <p>He stood before the angry woman in an attitude of such quiet majesty, that
  she was silenced, but her eyes flashed with inextinguishable hatred.</p>

  <p>"Cethegus," said Petros, who had meanwhile made up his mind, "you are
  right. For the moment, Byzantium can gain nothing better than your help; for
  without it she can gain nothing. If Belisarius returns to Byzantium, will you
  be for us unconditionally?"</p>

  <p>"Unconditionally."</p>

  <p>"And Amalaswintha?"</p>

  <p>"I abandon her."</p>

  <p>"Well, then," said the Byzantine, "we are agreed."</p>

  <p>He wrote upon a waxen tablet a briefly-expressed order for the return of
  Belisarius to Byzantium, and gave it to the Prefect.</p>

  <p>"You may send the message yourself."</p>

  <p>Cethegus read it carefully.</p>

  <p>"It is well," said he, putting the tablet into the bosom of his dress. "We
  are Agreed."</p>

  <p>"When will Italy proceed against the barbarians?" asked Petros.</p>

  <p>"In the first days of the next month. I shall now go to Rome.
  Farewell."</p>

  <p>"You are going? Will you not help us to get rid of Amalaswintha? You will
  take pity on her again?" asked the Queen, in a reproachful voice.</p>

  <p>"She is condemned," said Cethegus, turning as he reached the door. "The
  judge goes; the executioner will perform his duty." And he left them with a
  proud mien.</p>

  <p>Theodahad, who had listened to all that had passed in speechless
  astonishment, now caught the hand of Petros in great alarm.</p>

  <p>"Petros," he cried, "for God's sake, what have you done? Our contract, and
  everything else, depends upon Belisarius; and you send him away?"</p>

  <p>"And allow that insolent man to triumph?" added Gothelindis
  indignantly.</p>

  <p>But Petros laughed; his whole face beamed with the ecstasy of victorious
  cunning.</p>

  <p>"Be quiet," he said. "This time the invincible Cethegus is conquered by
  Petros, at whom he has always scoffed."</p>

  <p>He took Theodahad and Gothelindis each by the hand, drew them close to
  him, looked round, and then whispered:</p>

  <p>"At the commencement of the message to Belisarius I have placed a small
  spot, which means: 'All that I have written is not meant in earnest, and is
  null.' Yes, yes; one learns the art of writing at the court of
  Byzantium!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b3-4"
     name="b3-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">Amalaswintha passed the two days following this midnight
  interview in a sort of real or imagined imprisonment. Whenever she left her
  chamber, whenever she turned the corner of one of the passages of the palace,
  she fancied that some one followed or accompanied her, now appearing, now
  slipping past her, now disappearing, and seemingly as eager to watch all her
  movements as to avoid her notice. She could not even descend to the tomb of
  her son unobserved.</p>

  <p>In vain she asked for Witichis or Teja; they had left the city the morning
  after the coronation, by order of the King.</p>

  <p>The feeling that she was alone, surrounded by lurking enemies, filled her
  mind with vague alarms.</p>

  <p>Heavily and darkly the autumn rain-clouds hung over Ravenna, as
  Amalaswintha rose from her sleepless couch on the morning of the third day.
  It affected her disagreeably when, upon going to the window of sparry gypsum,
  a raven rose cawing from the marble sill, and flew slowly over the garden
  with hoarse cries, heavily flapping its wings. The Princess felt how much her
  nerves had been tried by the last few days of pain, fear, and remorse; for
  she could not resist the dismal impression made upon her by the early autumn
  mists, which rose from the lagoons of the harbour city.</p>

  <p>She looked at the grey and marshy landscape with a deep sigh. Her heart
  was heavy with care and remorse. Her only hope lay in the thought of saving
  the kingdom at the cost of her own life, by frankly accusing and humiliating
  herself before the whole nation. She did not doubt that the relations and
  blood-avengers of the murdered dukes would strictly fulfil their duty.</p>

  <p>Buried in such reflections, she went through the empty halls and corridors
  of the palace&mdash;this time, as she believed, unobserved&mdash;to the
  resting-place of her son, in order to confirm herself, with prayer and
  penitence, in her pious resolution.</p>

  <p>As, after some time had elapsed, she re-ascended from the vault and turned
  into a gloomy arched passage, a man in the habit of a slave stepped out of a
  niche&mdash;she thought that she had often seen his face before&mdash;and put
  into her hand a little wax tablet, immediately disappearing into a side
  passage.</p>

  <p>She at once recognised the handwriting of Cassiodorus.</p>

  <p>And now she guessed who was the secret messenger. It was Dolios, the
  letter-carrier of her faithful minister.</p>

  <p>Quickly concealing the tablet in her dress, she hastened to her chamber,
  where she read as follows:</p>

  <p>"In pain, but not in anger, I parted from you. I would not that you should
  be called away from this world in an impenitent state, and lose your immortal
  soul. Fly from the palace, from the city. You know how bitter is the hatred
  of Gothelindis. Your life is not safe for an hour. Trust no one except my
  secretary, and at sunset go to the Temple of Venus in the garden. There you
  will find my litter, which will bring you safely to my villa at the Lake of
  Bolsena. Obey and trust."</p>

  <p>Much moved, Amalaswintha pressed the letter to her heart. Faithful
  Cassiodorus! He had not, then, quite forsaken her. He still feared and cared
  for her life. And that charming villa upon the lonely island in the blue Lake
  of Bolsena! There, many, many years ago, in the full bloom of youth and
  beauty, as the guest of Cassiodorus, she had been wedded to Eutharic, the
  noble Amelung, and, surrounded by all the splendour of rank and power, had
  passed the proudest days of her youth.</p>

  <p>She was overcome with an intense longing to see once more the scene of her
  greatest happiness.</p>

  <p>This feeling powerfully induced her to listen to the warning of
  Cassiodorus. Still more the fear&mdash;not for her life, for she longed to
  die&mdash;but that her enemies would make it impossible for her to warn the
  nation and save the kingdom.</p>

  <p>And, finally, she reflected that the way to Regeta, near Rome, where the
  great National Assembly was shortly&mdash;as was usual every autumn&mdash;to
  take place, led past the Lake of Bolsena; and that it was therefore only a
  furthering of her plan, should she start at once in this direction.</p>

  <p>But, in order to make sure in all cases, so that, even if she never
  arrived at the end of her journey, her warning voice might reach the ears of
  the nation, she decided to write a letter to Cassiodorus&mdash;whom she could
  not be sure of meeting at his villa&mdash;in which she would entrust him with
  her confession, and expose to him all the plans of the Byzantines and
  Theodahad.</p>

  <p>With closed doors she wrote the painful words. Hot tears of gratitude and
  remorse fell upon the parchment; she carefully sealed it, and delivered it to
  the most faithful of her slaves, with the strict injunction to carry it
  speedily and safely to the monastery at Squillacium in Apulia, the monastical
  foundation and usual abode of Cassiodorus.</p>

  <p>Slowly, slowly passed the dreary hours.</p>

  <p>She had grasped the offered hand of her friend with all her heart. Memory
  and hope vied with each other in painting the island in the lake as a
  much-loved asylum. There she hoped to find repose and peace.</p>

  <p>She kept carefully within her apartment, in order to give no cause for
  suspicion to her spies, or any excuse to detain her.</p>

  <p>At last the sun had set.</p>

  <p>With light steps, Amalaswintha, forbidding the attendance of her women,
  and only hiding a few jewels and documents in the folds of her mantle,
  hurried from her room into the wide colonnade which led to the garden.</p>

  <p>She feared to meet here as usual some lurking spy, and to be stopped, and
  perhaps detained. She frequently looked back, and even glanced carefully into
  the niches of the statues&mdash;all was empty and quiet, no spy followed her
  footsteps. Thus, unobserved, she reached the platform of the terrace which
  united the palace and the garden, and afforded an open view of the
  latter.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha examined the nearest path leading to the Temple of Venus. The
  way was open. Only the faded leaves fell rustling from the tall pines on to
  the sandy path, where they were whirled about by the wind, which drove the
  mist and clouds before it in ghostly shapes; it was very dismal in the
  deserted garden, which looked grey and dim in the twilight.</p>

  <p>The Princess shivered. The cold wind tore at her veil and mantle. She cast
  a shy glance at the heavy, gloomy mass of stone which she had left
  behind&mdash;the building in whose precincts she had ruled so proudly, and
  from which she was now escaping, lonely and fearfully as a criminal.</p>

  <p>She thought of her son, who reposed in the vault of the palace. She
  thought of her daughter, whom she herself had banished from these walls.</p>

  <p>For a moment her pain threatened to overpower the forsaken woman; she
  tottered, and with difficulty supported herself by the broad balustrade of
  the steps which she was descending. A feverish shudder shook her frame, as
  the horror of despair shook her soul.</p>

  <p>"But my people," she said to herself, "and my atonement&mdash;&mdash; I
  must and will accomplish it."</p>

  <p>Strengthened by this thought, she again hurried down the steps, and
  entered an alley overhung by thick foliage, which led across the garden, and
  ended at the Temple of Venus.</p>

  <p>She walked rapidly forward, trembling whenever the autumn leaves, with a
  sighing sound, were swept across her path from a side-walk.</p>

  <p>Breathless she arrived at the little temple, and looked searchingly around
  her.</p>

  <p>But no litter, no slaves were to be seen; all around was quiet; only the
  branches of the pines creaked in the wind.</p>

  <p>All at once the neighing of a horse struck upon her ear.</p>

  <p>She turned; around the corner of a wall a man approached with hasty
  steps.</p>

  <p>It was Dolios. He looked sharply about him, and then beckoned to her to
  come.</p>

  <p>The Princess hastened to follow him round the corner; there stood
  Cassiodorus's well-known Gallic travelling carriage, the comfortable and
  elegant <i>carruca</i>, closed on all sides with movable latticed shutters of
  polished wood, and to which were harnessed three swift-footed Flemish
  horses.</p>

  <p>"We must hasten, Princess," whispered Dolios, as he lifted her into the
  soft cushions. "The litter was too slow for the hatred of your enemies. Quiet
  and speed; so that no one may notice us."</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha looked back once more.</p>

  <p>Dolios opened the garden-gate and led the horses out. Two men stepped out
  of the bushes near. One took the driver's seat on the carriage, the other
  mounted one of two saddle-horses which stood outside the gate. Amalaswintha
  recognised the men as confidential slaves belonging to Cassiodorus. Like
  Dolios, they were provided with weapons.</p>

  <p>The latter carefully closed the garden-gate, and let down the shutters of
  the carriage. Then he mounted the remaining horse and drew his sword.</p>

  <p>"Forward!" he cried.</p>

  <p>And the little company galloped away as if Death himself were at their
  heels.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b3-5"
     name="b3-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">Amalaswintha at first revelled in the feeling of gratitude,
  freedom, and safety. She made happy plans of reconciliation. She saw her
  people saved from Byzantium by her warning voice&mdash;saved from the
  treachery of their own King.</p>

  <p>She already heard the enthusiastic shouts of the valiant army, announcing
  death to the enemy, and pardon to herself.</p>

  <p>Lost in such dreams, the hours, days, and nights passed rapidly.</p>

  <p>The party hurried on without pause. Three or four times a day the horses
  were changed, so that mile after mile was passed with the utmost
  velocity.</p>

  <p>Dolios carefully watched over the Princess. He stood at the door of the
  carriage with drawn sword, while his companions fetched meat and drink from
  the stations which they passed.</p>

  <p>The speed at which they went, and the faithful attention of Dolios, freed
  the Princess from an anxiety which she had not been able for some time to get
  rid of&mdash;it seemed to her that they were pursued.</p>

  <p>Twice, at Perusia and Clusium, where the carriage stopped, she had thought
  she heard the rattle of wheels and the sound of horses' hoofs close
  behind.</p>

  <p>And, at Clusium, she had even fancied, as she looked through the lattices,
  that she saw a second <i>carruca</i>, likewise accompanied by outriders, turn
  into the gate of that town.</p>

  <p>But when she had spoken of this to Dolios, he had at once galloped back to
  the gate, and shortly returned with the assurance that there was nothing to
  be seen.</p>

  <p>From that time she had noticed nothing more; and the mad haste with which
  she was being carried to the wished-for island, encouraged the hope that her
  enemies, even if they had discovered her flight and had followed her for a
  time, had soon become tired and remained behind.</p>

  <p>An accident, insignificant in itself, but fraught with dread because of
  accompanying circumstances, suddenly darkened the brightening hopes of the
  fugitive Princess.</p>

  <p>A desolate, treeless waste extended on all sides, farther than the eye
  could reach. Only reeds and tall marsh-plants stood in the damp ditches on
  both sides of the Roman high-road, nodding and whispering mysteriously in the
  night wind.</p>

  <p>The road was now and then bordered by walls grown over with vines; or, in
  old Roman style, by monuments, which, however, were often sadly ruined, and
  the scattered stones of which, fallen across the road, hindered the progress
  of the horses.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the carriage stopped with a violent shock, and Dolios tore open
  the door.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" cried the Princess; "have we fallen into the hands of
  our enemies?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Dolios, who, though known to her as gloomy and reserved,
  seemed, during the journey, almost alarmingly silent; "a wheel is broken. You
  must descend and wait until it is mended."</p>

  <p>A violent gust of wind just then extinguished his torch, and chilly drops
  of rain lashed the face of the terrified Princess.</p>

  <p>"Descend? here? whither shall I go? There is no house near, not even a
  tree which might afford a shelter from the rain and wind. I shall remain in
  the carriage."</p>

  <p>"The wheel must be taken off. That monument will afford some shelter."</p>

  <p>Shivering with fright, Amalaswintha obeyed, and walked over the scattered
  stones to the right side of the road, where, across the ditch, she saw a tall
  monument rise out of the darkness.</p>

  <p>Dolios helped her over the ditch. All at once the neighing of a horse was
  heard on the road behind the carriage. Amalaswintha stopped short in
  alarm.</p>

  <p>"It is our rear-guard," said Dolios quickly. "Come!" And he led her
  through the wet grass up the hill upon which stood the monument.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the top, she seated herself upon the broad slab of a
  sarcophagus. Dolios all at once disappeared into the darkness; in vain she
  called him back. Presently she saw the light of his torch on the road below;
  it shone redly through the mist of the marsh, and the stormy wind rapidly
  bore away the sound of the hammer-strokes of the slaves who were working at
  the wheel.</p>

  <p>Thus sat the daughter of the great Theodoric, lonely and in fear. The cold
  rain slowly penetrated her clothing. The wind tore at her dress and sighed
  dismally through the cypresses behind the monument; ragged clouds drove
  across the sky and at intervals permitted a gleam of moonlight to penetrate
  their folds, which only intensified the darkness that followed.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha's heart was sick with fear. Gradually her eyes became
  accustomed to the gloom, and, looking about her, she could distinguish the
  outlines of the nearest objects. There!&mdash;her heart stood still with
  horror&mdash;it seemed to her as if, close behind her on the raised corner of
  the back of the sarcophagus, there sat a second figure&mdash;it was not her
  own shadow&mdash;a shorter figure in a wide flowing garment, its arms resting
  on its knees, its head supported on its hands, and its eyes fixed upon
  her.</p>

  <p>She could scarcely breathe; she thought she heard a whisper; she
  feverishly tried to see, to hear.</p>

  <p>Again there came a whisper.</p>

  <p>"No, no; not yet!" this was what she thought she heard.</p>

  <p>She raised herself gently, and the figure, too, seemed to move; she
  distinctly heard the clang of steel upon stone. In mortal fear she screamed
  out:</p>

  <p>"Dolios! lights! help! lights!"</p>

  <p>She turned to descend the hill, but her knees trembled too much; she fell
  and hurt her cheek against the sharp stones.</p>

  <p>All at once Dolios stood beside her, and silently lifted her up. He asked
  no questions.</p>

  <p>"Dolios," she said, trying to compose herself, "give me the light! I must
  see what was there; what is there now."</p>

  <p>She took the torch and walked with a firm step round the corner of the
  sarcophagus. There was nothing to be seen, but by the light of the torch she
  now perceived that the monument was not old like the others, but newly
  erected; so unsoiled was the white marble, so fresh the black letters of the
  inscription.</p>

  <p>Irresistibly impelled by the strange curiosity which is inseparable from
  terror, she held the torch to the socle of the monument, and by its
  flickering light read these words:</p>

  <p>"Eternal honour to the three Balthes, Thulun, Ibba, and Pitza. An eternal
  curse upon their murderers!"</p>

  <p>With a scream Amalaswintha staggered back.</p>

  <p>Dolios led her, half fainting, to the carriage. She passed the remaining
  hours of her journey in an almost unconscious state. She felt ill in body and
  mind. The nearer she came to the island the more the feverish joy with which
  she had looked forward to reaching it was replaced by a mysterious fear. With
  apprehension she saw the shrubs and trees at the road-side fly past her
  faster and faster.</p>

  <p>At last the smoking horses stopped. She let down the shutters and looked
  out. It was that cold and dreary hour in which the first grey of dawn
  struggles for the mastery with the still pervading night. They had arrived,
  it seemed, at the shore of the lake, but nothing was to be seen of its
  waters.</p>

  <p>A dismal grey mist lay, impenetrable as the future, before Amalaswintha's
  eyes. Of the villa, even of the island, nothing could be seen.</p>

  <p>On the right side of the road stood a low fisher-hut, half-buried in the
  tall, thick reeds, which bent their heads to the soughing of the morning
  wind. Singular! they seemed to warn and beckon her away from the hidden lake
  behind them.</p>

  <p>Dolios had gone into the hut. He now returned and lifted the Princess out
  of the carriage. Silently he led her through the damp meadow to the reeds.
  Among them lay a small boat, which seemed rather to float on the mist than on
  the water.</p>

  <p>At the rudder sat an old man in a grey and ragged mantle; his long white
  hair hung dishevelled about his face. He seemed to sit dreaming with closed
  eyes, which he did not even open when the Princess entered the rocking boat
  and placed herself in the middle upon a camp-stool.</p>

  <p>Dolios entered the boat after her, and took the two oars; the slaves
  remained behind with the carriage.</p>

  <p>"Dolios!" cried Amalaswintha anxiously, "it is very dark. Can the old man
  steer in this fog, and no light on either shore?"</p>

  <p>"A light would be of no use, Queen. He is blind."</p>

  <p>"Blind!" cried the terrified woman. "Let me land! Put back!"</p>

  <p>"I have guided the boat for twenty years," said the aged ferryman; "no
  seeing man knows the way as well as I."</p>

  <p>"Were you born blind then?"</p>

  <p>"No. Theodoric the Amelung caused me to be blinded, believing that Alaric,
  the brother of Thulun, had hired me to murder him. I am a servant of the
  Balthes, and a follower of Alaric, but I was innocent; and so was my master,
  the banished Alaric. A curse upon the Amelungs!" he cried with an angry pull
  at the rudder.</p>

  <p>"Silence, old man!" said Dolios.</p>

  <p>"Why should I not say to-day what I have said at every oar-stroke for
  twenty years? It is the way I beat time. A curse upon the Amelungs!"</p>

  <p>The Princess looked with horror at the old man, who, in fact, steered the
  boat with complete security, and as straight as an arrow.</p>

  <p>His wide mantle and dishevelled hair waved in the wind; all around was fog
  and silence; only the regular beat of the oars could be heard. Empty air and
  grey mist enveloped the slight boat.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Amalaswintha as if Charon was rowing her over the Styx to the
  grey realm of shades.</p>

  <p>Shivering, she drew her mantle closely around her.</p>

  <p>A few more strokes of the oar, and they landed.</p>

  <p>Dolios lifted the trembling Queen on to the land; but the old man silently
  turned his boat, and rowed as quickly and unerringly back as he had come.
  With a sort of dismay Amalaswintha watched him disappear into the thick
  mist.</p>

  <p>Suddenly it seemed to her as if she heard the sound of oar-strokes from a
  second boat, which approached nearer and nearer. She asked Dolios what was
  the cause of this noise.</p>

  <p>"I hear nothing," he answered; "you are over-excited. Come into the
  house."</p>

  <p>Supported by his arm she climbed the steps, hewn in the rock, which led to
  the tower-like, loftily-situated villa. Of the gardens, which, as she
  distinctly remembered, extended on both sides of the narrow path, scarcely
  the outlines of the rows of trees could be distinguished in the mist.</p>

  <p>At last they reached the lofty entrance, a bronze door with posts of black
  marble.</p>

  <p>Dolios knocked upon it with the hilt of his sword; the stroke reverberated
  dully through the vaulted halls&mdash;the door sprang open.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha remembered how she had once entered this door, then almost
  choked with wreaths of flowers, at the side of her young husband; she
  remembered with what friendly warmth they had been welcomed by the
  door-keeper and his wife, at that time also a newly-married couple.</p>

  <p>The dark-looking slave with tangled grey hair, who now stood before her
  with a lantern and a bunch of keys, was a stranger to her.</p>

  <p>"Where is Fuscina, the wife of the late ostiarius? Is she no more in the
  house?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"She was long since drowned in the lake," answered the door-keeper
  indifferently; and went forward with the light.</p>

  <p>The Princess followed shuddering; she could not help thinking of the cold
  black waves which had so dismally licked the planks of the little boat.</p>

  <p>They went on through arched courts and pillared halls; all were empty, as
  if the inhabitants were dead. Their footsteps echoed loudly in the deserted
  rooms&mdash;the whole villa seemed one vast catacomb.</p>

  <p>"The house is uninhabited? I need a female slave."</p>

  <p>"My wife will attend you."</p>

  <p>"Is no one else in the villa?"</p>

  <p>"One other slave&mdash;a Greek physician."</p>

  <p>"A physician? I will see him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But at this moment a violent knocking was heard at the outer door.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha started in terror.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" she asked, catching Dolios by the sleeve.</p>

  <p>She heard the banging of the heavy door as it was closed again.</p>

  <p>"It was only some one demanding admittance," said the ostiarius, as he
  returned and unlocked the door of the room intended for the fugitive
  Princess.</p>

  <p>The close air of a chamber which had not been opened for a long time half
  suffocated her; but she recognised with emotion the tortoise-shell lining of
  the walls; it was the same room which she had occupied twenty years ago.</p>

  <p>Overpowered by the recollection, she sank upon the small couch, which was
  covered with dark-coloured cushions.</p>

  <p>Dismissing the two men, she drew close the curtains of the couch, and soon
  sank into an uneasy slumber.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b3-6"
     name="b3-6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">Thus she lay, she knew not how long, half awake, half
  dreaming; picture after picture arose in her excited mind.</p>

  <p>Eutharic with the expression of constant pain upon his
  lips&mdash;Athalaric as he lay stretched upon his bier, he seemed to sign to
  her&mdash;the reproachful face of Mataswintha&mdash;then mist and clouds and
  leafless trees&mdash;then three angry warriors with pale faces and bloody
  garments&mdash;and the blind ferryman in the realm of shades.</p>

  <p>At another time it seemed to her as if she lay on the steps of the
  monument in the desolate waste, and again something rustled behind her, and a
  shrouded figure bent over her, nearer and nearer, oppressing and suffocating
  her.</p>

  <p>Her heart was contracted by fear; she started up terrified, and looked
  about her. There!&mdash;it was no dream-fancy&mdash;something really rustled
  behind the curtains, and a shrouded shadow glided along the wainscoted
  walls.</p>

  <p>With a scream Amalaswintha opened the curtain wide&mdash;there was nothing
  to be seen.</p>

  <p>Was it, then, but a dream?</p>

  <p>It was impossible to remain alone with her torturing thoughts. She pressed
  a knob of agate on the wall, which set in motion a hammer outside the
  room.</p>

  <p>Very soon a slave appeared, whose features and costume betrayed a higher
  education.</p>

  <p>He introduced himself as the Greek physician. She told him of the terrible
  dreams and the feverish tremblings by which she had been tormented during the
  last few hours. He explained the symptoms as the consequence of excitement,
  perhaps of cold taken during her flight, recommended a warm bath, and left
  her to order its preparation.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha remembered the splendid baths, which, divided into two
  stories, occupied the whole right wing of the villa.</p>

  <p>The lower story of the large octagonal rotunda, designed for the cold
  bath, was in immediate connection with the lake. The water was conducted into
  the bath through sieves, which excluded every impurity.</p>

  <p>The upper story, a smaller octagon, was erected over the bath-room of the
  lower story, the ceiling of which, made of a large circular metal plate,
  formed the floor of the upper bath, and could be pushed, divided into two
  semicircles, into the walls; so that both stories then formed an undivided
  space, which, for the purposes of cleansing or for games of swimming and
  diving, could be completely filled with the water of the lake.</p>

  <p>Generally, however, the upper story was used only for the warm bath, and
  was provided with hundreds of pipes, and innumerable dolphin, triton, and
  Medusa-heads of bronze or marble, through which flowed the scented waters,
  mixed with oils and essences; while from the gallery all round, upon which
  the bathers undressed, ornamental steps led down into the shell-shaped
  porphyry basin of the bath.</p>

  <p>As the Princess was recalling these rooms to her memory, the wife of the
  door-keeper appeared to lead her to the bath.</p>

  <p>They passed through wide columned halls and libraries&mdash;where,
  however, the Princess missed the capsulas and rolls of Cassiodorus&mdash;in
  the direction of the garden; the slave carrying fine bath-cloths, oil flasks,
  and the salve for anointment.</p>

  <p>At last they arrived at the tower-like octagon of the bath-rooms, which
  was completely lined and paved with pale grey marble.</p>

  <p>They went through the halls and passages, which served for the gymnastics
  and games of ball usually indulged in before and after the bath, past the
  heating-rooms, undressing and anointing-rooms, directly to the calidarium, or
  warm bath.</p>

  <p>The slave silently opened the door in the marble wall. Amalaswintha went
  in and stood upon the narrow gallery which ran round the basin. Immediately
  before her was a flight of easy steps leading into the bath, out of which
  warm and delicious odours already arose.</p>

  <p>The light fell from above through an octagonal dome of artistically-cut
  glass. Close to the entrance into the room a staircase of cedar-wood,
  consisting of twelve steps, led on to a spring-board.</p>

  <p>On the marble walls of the gallery, as well as of the basin, the openings
  of the water-works and heating-pipes were concealed by marble
  bas-reliefs.</p>

  <p>Without a word, the attendant laid the various articles for the bath upon
  the soft cushions and carpets which covered the gallery, and turned to
  go.</p>

  <p>"How is it that I seem to know you?" asked the Princess, looking
  thoughtfully at her. "How long have you been here?"</p>

  <p>"Eight days," answered the slave, turning the handle of the door.</p>

  <p>"How long have you served Cassiodorus?"</p>

  <p>"I serve, and have always served, the Princess Gothelindis."</p>

  <p>At this name Amalaswintha started up with a cry and caught at the woman's
  skirt&mdash;too late; she was gone and the door closed, and Amalaswintha
  heard the key taken from the lock outside.</p>

  <p>A great and unknown terror overcame her. She felt that she had been
  fearfully deceived; that some shocking secret lay behind. Her heart was full
  of unspeakable anxiety; and flight&mdash;flight from the rooms was her only
  thought.</p>

  <p>But flight seemed impossible. The door now appeared to be only a thick
  marble slab like those on the right and left; even a needle could not have
  penetrated into the junctures. She looked desperately round the walls of the
  gallery, but met only the marble stare of the tritons and dolphins. At last
  her eyes rested upon a snake-encircled Medusa's head directly opposite and a
  scream of horror escaped her lips.</p>

  <p>The face of the Medusa was pushed aside, and the oval opening beneath, the
  snaky hair was filled with a living countenance! Was it a human face?</p>

  <p>The trembling woman clung to the marble balustrade of the gallery, and
  bent, over it, staring at the apparition. Yes, it was the distorted features
  of Gothelindis! A hell of hate and mockery flashed from the eyes.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha fell upon her knees and hid her face in her hands.</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i>&mdash;you here?"</p>

  <p>A hoarse laugh was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Yes, child of the Amelungs, I am here; to your ruin! Mine is this island;
  mine the house&mdash;it will become your grave&mdash;mine is Dolios, and all
  the slaves of Cassiodorus; bought by me eight days ago. I have decoyed you
  here; I have followed you like your shadow. I have endured the torture of my
  hatred for long days and nights, in order to enjoy full revenge at last. I
  will revel for hours in your death-agony. I will see your tender frame shaken
  as with fever-frost, and your haughty features convulsed with terror. Oh, I
  will drink a sea of revenge!"</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha rose from her knees wringing her hands.</p>

  <p>"Revenge? For what? Why this deadly hatred?"</p>

  <p>"Ah! can you ask? Certainly years have passed, and the happy easily
  forget. But hate has a faithful memory. Have you forgotten how two young
  girls once played under the shade of the plantains in the meadow at Ravenna?
  They were the fairest among their play-fellows; both young, beautiful, and
  amiable. A royal child the one, the other a daughter of the Balthes. The
  girls were about to choose a queen of the games. They chose Gothelindis, for
  she was still more handsome than you, and not so tyrannical. And they chose
  her twice in succession. But the King's daughter stood near, devoured by
  ungovernable pride and envy, and when they chose me for the third time she
  took up a pair of sharp-pointed gardener's scissors&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop! Oh! be silent, Gothelindis!"</p>

  <p>"And hurled it at me. It hit me. Screaming' with pain and bleeding, I fell
  to the ground, my whole cheek one yawning wound, and my eye, my eye pierced
  through! Ah! how it still pains, even to-day!"</p>

  <p>"Forgive, pardon me, Gothelindis!" cried Amalaswintha. "You have pardoned
  me long ago."</p>

  <p>"Forgive? I forgive you? Shall I forgive you when you have robbed me of my
  eye, and of all my beauty? You conquered for life! Gothelindis was no more
  dangerous as a rival. She lamented in secret; the disfigured girl hid from
  the eyes of mankind. And years passed. Then there came to the court of
  Ravenna a noble Amelung from Spain; Eutharic with his dark eyes and tender
  soul. And he, himself sick, took pity upon the sick and half-blind girl. He
  spoke to her with affection and kindness; spoke to the ugly, disfigured
  creature whom all the others avoided. And it was decided&mdash;in order to
  eradicate the ancient enmity between our families, and to expiate old and new
  guilt&mdash;for Duke Alaric had been condemned in consequence of a secret and
  unproved accusation&mdash;that the poor ill-used daughter of the Balthes
  should become the wife of the noblest of the Amelungs. But when you heard
  this, you, who had so terribly disfigured me, were resolved to deprive me
  also of my lover! Not out of jealousy, no; not because you loved him, no; but
  from mere pride. Because you were determined to keep the first man in the
  kingdom and the heir to the crown to yourself. And you succeeded; for your
  father could deny you nothing, and Eutharic soon forgot his compassion for
  the one-eyed girl, when the hand of the beautiful Amalaswintha was offered to
  him. In recompense&mdash;or was it only in mockery?&mdash;they gave me, too,
  to an Amelung; to Theodahad, that miserable coward?"</p>

  <p>"Gothelindis, I swear to you, I never suspected that you loved Eutharic.
  How could I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To be sure! how could you believe that the disfigured girl could place
  her heart so high? Oh, you cursed woman, if you had really loved him, and had
  made him happy&mdash;I could have forgiven all! But you never loved him; you
  are only capable of ambition! His lot with you was misery. For years I saw
  him wasting by your side, oppressed, unloved, chilled to the very soul by
  your coldness. Grief soon killed him. You! you have robbed me of my lover and
  brought him to the grave with sorrow&mdash;revenge! revenge for him!"</p>

  <p>And the lofty dome echoed with the cry: "Revenge! Revenge!"</p>

  <p>"Help!" cried Amalaswintha, and ran despairingly round the circle of the
  gallery, beating the smooth walls with her hands.</p>

  <p>"Aye! call! call! here no one can hear you but the God of Revenge! Do you
  think I have bridled my hate for months in vain? How often, how easily could
  I have reached you, with dagger or poison, at Ravenna! But no; I have decoyed
  you here. At the monument of my murdered cousins; an hour ago at your
  bedside; I with difficulty restrained my uplifted hand&mdash;but slowly, inch
  by inch, shall you die. I will watch for hours the growing agony of your
  death."</p>

  <p>"Terrible! Oh, terrible!"</p>

  <p>"What are hours compared with the long years during which I was martyred
  by the thought of my disfigurement, of your beauty and your possession of my
  lover! But you shall repent it!"</p>

  <p>"What will you do?" cried the terrified woman, again and again seeking
  some outlet in the walls.</p>

  <p>"I will drown you, slowly and surely, in the waterworks of this bath,
  which your friend Cassiodorus built. You do not know what tortures of
  jealousy and impotent rage I endured in this house when your wedding with
  Eutharic was celebrated, and I was compelled to serve in your train. In this
  room, you proud woman, I unloosed your sandals, and dried your fair
  limbs&mdash;in this room you shall die?"</p>

  <p>She touched a spring in the wall.</p>

  <p>The floor of the basin, the round metal plate, divided into two halves,
  which slid slowly into the walls on the right and left.</p>

  <p>With horror the imprisoned woman looked down from the narrow gallery into
  the chasm thus opened at her feet.</p>

  <p>"Remember that day in the meadow!" cried Gothelindis; and in the lower
  story the sluices were suddenly opened, and the waters of the lake rushed in,
  roaring and hissing, and rose higher and higher with fearful rapidity.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha saw certain death before her. She saw the impossibility of
  escape, or of softening her fiendish enemy by prayers. At this crisis, the
  hereditary courage of the Amelungs returned to her; she composed herself, and
  was reconciled to her fate.</p>

  <p>She descried, amid the numerous reliefs of mythological subjects near her,
  a representation of the death of Christ on the right of the entrance. The
  sight strengthened her mind; she threw herself upon her knees before the
  marble cross, clasped it with both ands, and prayed quietly with closed eyes,
  while the water rose and rose; it already splashed upon the steps of the
  gallery.</p>

  <p>"You pray, murderess? Away from the cross!" cried Gothelindis, enraged;
  "think of the three dukes!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly all the dolphin and triton heads on the right side of the octagon
  began to spout streams of hot rater; white steam rushed out of the pipes.</p>

  <p>Amalaswintha sprang up and ran to the left side of the gallery.</p>

  <p>"Gothelindis, I forgive you! Kill me, but forgive me also!"</p>

  <p>And the water rose and rose; it already covered the topmost step of the
  bath, and slowly wetted the floor of the gallery.</p>

  <p>And now the streaming water-pipes spouted upon Amalaswintha from the left
  also. She took refuge in the middle of the gallery, directly opposite the
  Medusa, the only place where no steam from the hot-water pipe could reach
  her.</p>

  <p>If she mounted the spring-board, which was placed here, she could respite
  her life for some time longer. Gothelindis seemed to expect that she would do
  so, and to revel in the prospect of the lengthened torture of the agonised
  woman.</p>

  <p>The water already rushed over the marble flooring of the gallery and laved
  the feet of Amalaswintha. She ran quickly up the brown and shining wooden
  steps, and leaned over the railing of the bridge.</p>

  <p>"Hear me, Gothelindis! my last prayer! not for myself, but for my people,
  for <i>our</i> people. Petros will destroy them, and
  Theodahad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know that the kingdom is your last anxiety! Despair. It is lost!
  These foolish Goths, who have always preferred the Amelungs to the Balthes,
  are sold and betrayed by the Amelungs. Belisarius approaches, and there is no
  one to warn them."</p>

  <p>"You err, satanic woman; they <i>are</i> warned! I, their Queen, have
  warned them! Hail to my people! Destruction to their enemies! and may God
  have mercy on my soul!" and she suddenly leapt from the spring-board into the
  water, which closed whirling over her head.</p>

  <p>Gothelindis looked at the place which her victim had occupied a moment
  before.</p>

  <p>"She has disappeared," she said. Then she looked at the water&mdash;on the
  surface floated Amalaswintha's kerchief.</p>

  <p>"Even in death this woman conquers me," said Gothelindis slowly. "How long
  was my hate, and how short my revenge!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b3-7"
     name="b3-7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">A few days after these occurrences, there were assembled in
  the apartments of the Byzantine ambassador at Ravenna a number of
  distinguished Romans of worldly and ecclesiastical rank. The Bishops Hypatius
  and Demetrius from the Eastern Empire were also present.</p>

  <p>Great excitement, mixed with alarm and anger, was visible on all faces, as
  Petros, the rhetorician, concluded his address in these words:</p>

  <p>"It is for this reason, reverend bishops of the East and West, and you,
  noble Romans, that I have assembled you here. I protest loudly and solemnly,
  in the name of the Emperor, against all secret acts of cunning or force which
  may have been practised against the noble lady. Nine days ago she disappeared
  from Ravenna; most likely taken by force from your midst; she, who has ever
  been the friend and protector of the Italians! On the same day, the Queen,
  her bitter enemy, also disappeared. I have sent out expresses in all
  directions, but, until now, am without news. But alas! if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He could not complete the sentence.</p>

  <p>A confused tumult arose from the Forum of Hercules, and very soon hasty
  footsteps were heard in the vestibule; the curtain was parted, and one of the
  Byzantine slaves of the ambassador hurried into the room, covered with
  dust.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he cried, "she is dead! she is murdered!"</p>

  <p>"Murdered!" repeated many voices.</p>

  <p>"By whom?" asked Petros.</p>

  <p>"By Gothelindis; at the villa in the Lake of Bolsena!"</p>

  <p>"Where is the corpse? Where the murderess?"</p>

  <p>"Gothelindis pretends that the Princess was drowned in the bath while
  playing with the water-works, with which she was unacquainted. But it is
  known that the Queen had followed her victim, step by step, ever since she
  left the city. Romans and Goths have crowded by hundreds to the villa to
  bring the corpse here in solemn procession. The Queen escaped the fury of the
  people and fled to the fortress of Feretri."</p>

  <p>"Enough," cried Petros indignantly. "I go to the King, and call upon you
  all to follow me. I shall refer to your testimony of what passes in my report
  to Emperor Justinian." And he at once hurried out at the head of the assembly
  to the palace.</p>

  <p>In the streets they found a throng of people rushing hither and thither,
  full of rage and indignation. The news had arrived in the city, and spread
  from house to house. On recognising the imperial ambassador and the
  dignitaries of the city, the crowd gave way before them, but immediately
  closed again behind them pressed after them to the palace, and was with
  difficulty kept from entering the gates.</p>

  <p>Every moment increased the number and excitement of the people. The Roman
  citizens crowded together in the Forum of Honorius, and to their grief for
  the fate of their protectress was added the hope that this occurrence might
  cause the downfall of the barbarians. The appearance of the ambassador
  encouraged this hope, and the feelings of the mass took a direction which was
  by no means inimical alone to Theodahad and Gothelindis.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Petros, with his companions, hastened to the apartments of the
  helpless King, who, in the absence of his wife, had lost all strength of
  resistance. He trembled at the excitement of the crowd before the palace, and
  had already sent for Petros, to ask from him help and counsel; for it was
  Petros himself who had decided upon the murder of the Princess, and arranged
  with Gothelindis the manner of its accomplishment. The King, therefore, now
  expected him to help to bear the consequences.</p>

  <p>When, then, the Byzantine appeared upon the threshold, Theodahad hurried
  to him with open arms; but he suddenly stood still in amazement, astonished
  to see what companions Petros had brought with him, and still more astonished
  at his threatening aspect.</p>

  <p>"I call you to account, King of the Goths!" cried Petros, even before he
  had crossed the threshold. "In the name of Byzantium, I call you to account
  for the disappearance of the daughter of Theodoric. You know that Emperor
  Justinian had assured her of his particular protection; every hair of her
  head is therefore sacred, and sacred every drop of her blood. Where is
  Amalaswintha?"</p>

  <p>The King stared at him in speechless astonishment. He admired this power
  of dissimulation; but he did not understand its cause. He made no answer.</p>

  <p>"Where is Amalaswintha?" repeated Petros, advancing threateningly: and his
  companions also came a step forward.</p>

  <p>"She is dead," said Theodahad, who began to feel extremely anxious.</p>

  <p>"She is murdered!" cried Petros. "So says all Italy. Murdered by you and
  your wife. Justinian, my illustrious Emperor, was the protector of this
  woman, and he will be her avenger. In his name I declare war against
  you&mdash;war against you and all your race!"</p>

  <p>"War against you and all your race!" repeated the Italians, carried away
  by the excitement of the moment, and giving vent to their long-cherished
  hatred; and they pressed upon the trembling King.</p>

  <p>"Petros," he stammered in terror, "you will remember our treaty, and you
  will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the ambassador took a roll of papyrus out of his mantle, and tore it
  in two.</p>

  <p>"Thus I tear all bonds between my Emperor and this bloodthirsty house! You
  yourselves by this cruel deed have forfeited all our former forbearance, No
  treaties&mdash;war!"</p>

  <p>"For God's sake!" cried Theodahad; "no fighting! What do you demand,
  Petros?"</p>

  <p>"Complete subjection. The evacuation of Italy. Yourself and Gothelindis I
  summon to Byzantium, before the throne of Justinian. There&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But his speech was interrupted by the sounding clang of the Gothic alarum,
  and into the room hurried a strong troop of Gothic warriors, led by Earl
  Witichis.</p>

  <p>On hearing of Amalaswintha's death, the Gothic leaders had at once
  summoned the most valiant men of the nation in Ravenna to meet before the
  Porta Romana, and there they had agreed upon the best means of security. They
  had appeared in the Forum of Honorius just at the right moment&mdash;when the
  excitement was becoming dangerous. Here and there a dagger flashed, and the
  cry arose, "Woe to the barbarians!"</p>

  <p>These signs and voices ceased at once, as the hated Goths advanced in
  close ranks from the Forum of Hercules through the Via Palatina. Without
  resistance, they marched through the murmuring groups; and while Earl Teja
  and Hildebad guarded the gates and terraces of the palace, Witichis and
  Hildebrand arrived in the King's rooms just in time to hear the last words of
  the ambassador.</p>

  <p>Wheeling to the right, they placed their followers near the throne, to
  which the King had just retreated; and Witichis, leaning on his long sword,
  went close up to Petros, and looked keenly into his eyes.</p>

  <p>A pause of expectation ensued.</p>

  <p>"Who dares," asked Witichis quietly, "to play the master here in the royal
  palace of the Goths?"</p>

  <p>Recovering from his surprise, Petros answered,</p>

  <p>"It does not become you, Earl Witichis, to interfere for the protection of
  a murderer. I have summoned the King before the court at Byzantium."</p>

  <p>"And for this insult thou hast no reply, Amelung?" cried old Hildebrand
  angrily.</p>

  <p>But his bad conscience tied the King's tongue.</p>

  <p>"Then we must speak for him," said Witichis "Know, Greek, and understand
  it well, you false and ungrateful Ravennites, the nation of the Goths is free
  and acknowledges no foreign master or judge or earth."</p>

  <p>"Not even for murder?"</p>

  <p>"If evil deeds occur amongst us, we ourselves will judge and punish them.
  It does not concern strangers; least of all our enemy, the Emperor of
  Byzantium."</p>

  <p>"My Emperor will revenge this woman, whom he could not save. Deliver up
  the murderers to Byzantium."</p>

  <p>"We would not deliver up a Gothic hind, much less our King!"</p>

  <p>"Then you share his guilt and his punishment, and I declare war against
  you in the name of my master. Tremble before Justinian and Belisarius!"</p>

  <p>A movement of joy amongst the Gothic warriors was the only answer.</p>

  <p>Old Hildebrand went to the window, and cried to the Goths, who crowded
  below:</p>

  <p>"News! joyful news! War with Byzantium!"</p>

  <p>At this a tumult broke loose below, as if the sea had burst its dams;
  weapons clashed, and a thousand voices shouted:</p>

  <p>"War! war with Byzantium!"</p>

  <p>This repetition of his words was not without effect upon Petros or the
  Italians. The fierceness of this enthusiasm alarmed them; they were silent,
  and cast down their eyes.</p>

  <p>While the Goths, shaking hands, congratulated each other, Witichis went up
  to Petros with an earnest mien, and said solemnly:</p>

  <p>"Then it is war! We do not shun it; that you have heard. Better open war
  than this lurking, undermining enmity. War is good; but woe to him who
  kindles it without reason and without a just cause! I see beforehand years of
  blood and murder and conflagration; I see trampled corn-fields, smoking
  towns, and numberless corpses swimming down the rivers! Listen to our words.
  Upon your heads be this blood, this misery! You have irritated and excited us
  for years; we bore it quietly. And now you have declared war against us,
  judging where you had no right to judge, and mixing yourselves in the affairs
  of a nation which is as free as your own. On your heads be the
  responsibility! This is our answer to Byzantium."</p>

  <p>Silently Petros listened to these words; silently he turned and went out,
  followed by his companions.</p>

  <p>Some of them accompanied him to his residence, amongst them the Bishop of
  Florentia.</p>

  <p>"Reverend friend," Petros said to the latter at parting, "the letters of
  Theodahad about the matter you know of, which you entrusted to me for
  perusal, you must leave entirely at my disposal. I need them, and they are no
  longer necessary to you."</p>

  <p>"The process is long since decided," answered the Bishop, "and the
  property irrevocably acquired. The documents are yours."</p>

  <p>The ambassador then dismissed his friends, who hoped soon to see him again
  in Ravenna with the imperial army, and went to his chamber, where he at once
  despatched a messenger to Belisarius, ordering him to invade the country.
  Then he wrote a detailed report to the Emperor, which concluded in the
  following words:</p>

  <p>"And so, my Emperor, you seem to have just reason to be contented with the
  services of your most faithful messenger, and the situation of affairs. The
  barbarian nation split into parties; a hated Prince, incapable and faithless,
  upon the throne; the enemy surprised, unprepared and unarmed; the Italian
  population everywhere in your favour. We cannot fail! If no miracle occur,
  the barbarians must succumb almost without resistance; and, as often before,
  my great Emperor appears as the protector of the weak and the avenger of
  wrongs. It is a witty coincidence that the trireme which brought me here
  bears the name of <i>Nemesis</i>. Only one thing afflicts me much, that, with
  all my efforts, I have not succeeded in saving the unhappy daughter of
  Theodoric. I beg you, at least, to assure my mistress, the Empress, who was
  never very graciously disposed to me, that I tried most faithfully to obey
  all her injunctions concerning the Princess, whose fate she entrusted to me
  as her principal anxiety during our last interview. As to the question about
  Theodahad and Gothelindis, by whose assistance the Gothic Kingdom has been
  delivered into our hands, I will venture to recall to the Empress's memory
  the first rule of prudence: it is too dangerous to have the sharers of our
  profoundest secrets at court."</p>

  <p>This letter Petros sent on in advance with the two bishops, Hypatius and
  Demetrius, who were to go immediately to Brundusium, and thence through
  Epidamnos by land to Byzantium.</p>

  <p>He himself intended to follow in a few days, sailing slowly along the
  Gothic coasts of the Ionian Gulf, in order to prove the temper and excite the
  rebellion of the inhabitants of the harbour towns.</p>

  <p>He would afterwards sail round the Peloponnesus and Euboea to Byzantium,
  for the Empress had ordered him to travel by sea, and had given him
  commissions for Athens and Lampsacus.</p>

  <p>Before his departure from Ravenna, he already calculated the rewards he
  expected to receive at Byzantium for his successful operations in Italy.</p>

  <p>He would return twice as rich as he had come, for he had never confessed
  to the Queen, Gothelindis, that he had come into the country with the order
  to overthrow Amalaswintha.</p>

  <p>He had rather, for some time, met her with representations of the anger of
  the Empress and Emperor, and had, with great show of repugnance, allowed
  himself to be bribed with large sums to connive at her plans, when, actually,
  he but used her as his tool.</p>

  <p>He looked forward with certainty to the proud rank of patrician in
  Byzantium, and already rejoiced that he would be able to meet his haughty
  cousin, Narses&mdash;who had never used his influence to advance him&mdash;on
  equal terms.</p>

  <p>"So everything has succeeded better than I could wish," he said to himself
  with great complacency, as he set his papers in order before leaving Ravenna,
  "and this time, my proud friend Cethegus, cunning has proved truly excellent.
  The little rhetorician from Thessalonica, with his small and stealthy steps,
  has advanced farther than you with your proud strides. Of one thing I must be
  careful: that Theodahad and Gothelindis do not escape to Byzantium; it would
  be too dangerous. Perhaps the question of the astute Empress was intended as
  a warning. This royal couple must be put out of our way."</p>

  <p>Having completed his arrangements, Petros sent for the friend with whom he
  lodged, and took leave of him. At the same time he delivered to him a
  dark-coloured narrow vase, such as those which were used for the preservation
  of documents; he sealed the cover with his ring, which was finely engraved
  with a scorpion, and wrote a name upon the wax-tablet appended to it.</p>

  <p>"Seek this man," he said to his host, "at the next assembly of the Goths
  at Regeta, and give him the vase; the contents are his. Farewell. You shall
  soon see me again in Ravenna."</p>

  <p>He left the house with his slaves, and was soon on board the ambassador's
  ship; filled with proud expectations, he was borne away by the
  <i>Nemesis</i>.</p>

  <p>As his ship, many weeks after, neared the harbour of Byzantium&mdash;he
  had, at the Empress's wish, announced his speedy arrival at Lampsacus, by
  means of an imperial swift-sailer which was just leaving&mdash;Petros looked
  at the handsome country houses on the shore, which shone whitely from out of
  the evergreen shade of the surrounding gardens.</p>

  <p>"Here you will live in future, amongst the senators of the Empire," he
  thought with great contentment.</p>

  <p>Before they ran into the harbour, the <i>Thetis</i>, the splendid
  pleasure-boat of the Empress, flew towards them, and, as soon as she
  recognised the galley of the ambassador, hoisted the purple standard, as a
  sign to lay to.</p>

  <p>Very soon a messenger from the Empress came on board the galley. It was
  Alexandros, the former ambassador to the court of Ravenna. He showed to the
  captain of the galley a writing from the Emperor, at which the captain
  appeared to be much startled; then he turned to Petros.</p>

  <p>"In the name of the Emperor Justinian! You are condemned for life,
  convicted of long-practised forgery and embezzlement of the taxes, to the
  metal-works in the mines of Cherson, with the Ultra-Ziagirian Huns. You have
  delivered the daughter of Theodoric into the hands of her enemies. The
  Emperor thought you excused when he read your letter; but the Empress,
  inconsolable for the death of her royal sister, revealed your former guilt to
  the Emperor, and a letter from the Prefect of Rome proved that you had
  secretly planned the murder of the Princess with Gothelindis. Your fortune is
  confiscated, and the Empress wishes you to recollect&mdash;" here he
  whispered into the ear of Petros, who was completely stunned and broken by
  this terrible blow&mdash;"that you yourself, in your letter, advised her to
  get rid of all the sharers of her secrets."</p>

  <p>With this, Alexandros returned to the <i>Thetis</i>, but the
  <i>Nemesis</i> turned her stern to Byzantium, and bore the criminal away for
  ever from all civilised community with mankind.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b3-8"
     name="b3-8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">We have lost sight of Cethegus ever since his departure for
  Rome.</p>

  <p>During the events which we have described, he had been extremely active in
  that city, for he saw that things were coming to a crisis, and looked forward
  with confidence to a favourable result.</p>

  <p>All Italy was united in hatred against the barbarians, and who could so
  well direct this hatred as the head of the conspiracy of the Catacombs, and
  the master of Rome?</p>

  <p>For now he was so in fact. The legions were fully formed and equipped, and
  the fortifications of the city&mdash;the works of which had been carried on
  for the last few months night and day&mdash;were almost completed.</p>

  <p>And, as he thought, he had finally succeeded preventing an immediate
  incursion of the Byzantine army into Italy, the greatest calamity which
  threatened his ambitious plans. He had learned, through trustworthy spies,
  that the Byzantine fleet&mdash;which, till now had been anchored off
  Sicily&mdash;had really left that island, and sailed towards the African
  coast, where seemed occupied in suppressing piracy.</p>

  <p>Cethegus certainly foresaw that it would yet come to a landing of the
  Greeks in Italy; he could not do without their help. But it was material to
  his plans that the Emperor's assistance should be of secondary importance,
  and, to insure this, he must take care that, before a single Byzantine had
  set foot in Italy, a rebellion of the Italians should have taken place
  spontaneously, and have been already carried to such a point, that the later
  co-operation of the Greeks would appear to be a mere incident, and could be
  easily repaid by the acknowledgment of a light supremacy of the Emperor.</p>

  <p>To this end he had prepared his plans with great nicety.</p>

  <p>As soon as the last tower on the Roman walls was under roof, the Goths
  were to be attacked on one and the same day all over Italy, and, at one
  stroke, all the fortresses, castles, and towns&mdash;Rome, Ravenna, and
  Neapolis foremost&mdash;were to be overpowered and taken.</p>

  <p>If the barbarians were once driven into the open country, there was no
  fear&mdash;considering their complete ignorance of the art of siege, and the
  number and strength of the Italian fortresses&mdash;that they would be able
  to take these last, and thereby again become masters of the peninsula.</p>

  <p>Then an allied army from Byzantium might aid in finally driving the Goths
  over the Alps; and Cethegus was resolved to prevent these allies from
  entering the most important fortresses, so that, later, they also might be
  got rid of without difficulty.</p>

  <p>To ensure the success of this plan, it was necessary that the Goths should
  be taken by surprise. If war with Byzantium were in prospect, or, still
  worse, already broken out, it naturally followed that the barbarians would
  not allow their fortified places to be wrested from them by a mere stroke of
  the hand.</p>

  <p>Now as Cethegus&mdash;since he had penetrated the motives of the embassy
  of Petros&mdash;fully expected that Justinian would come forward at the first
  opportunity, and as he had barely succeeded in preventing the landing of
  Belisarius, he was resolved not to lose a moment's time.</p>

  <p>He had arranged that a general meeting of the conspirators should take
  place in the Catacombs on the day of the completion of the Roman
  fortifications, when their successful termination should be celebrated, the
  moment of the attack on the Goths decided, and Cethegus himself designated as
  the leader of this purely Italian movement.</p>

  <p>He hoped to overcome the opposition of the timorous or the
  bribed&mdash;who were inclined to act only for and with the assistance of
  Byzantium&mdash;by the enthusiasm of the Roman youth, whom he would promise
  to lead at once to battle.</p>

  <p>Before the day of meeting arrived, he had heard the news of Amalaswintha's
  murder, and of the confusion and division of the Goths, and he impatiently
  longed for the crisis.</p>

  <p>At length the last tower of the Aurelian Grate was completed. Cethegus
  himself gave the finishing stroke, and as he did so it seemed to him that he
  heard the sound of the blow which would liberate Rome and Italy.</p>

  <p>At the banquet which he afterwards gave to thousands of labourers in the
  theatre of Pompey, most of the conspirators were present, and the Prefect
  made use of the opportunity to show them how unlimited was his popularity.
  Upon the younger members the impression which he wished and expected to make
  was produced, but a small party, headed by Silverius, retired from the tables
  with discontented and gloomy looks.</p>

  <p>The priest had lately seen that Cethegus would not consent to be a mere
  tool, but that he contrived to carry out his own plans, which might prove
  extremely dangerous to the Church and to his (the priest's) personal
  influence. He was decided to overthrow his colleague as soon as he could be
  spared, and it had not been difficult for him to excite the jealousy of many
  Romans against Cethegus.</p>

  <p>The wily archbishop had taken advantage of the presence of the two bishops
  from the Eastern Empire, Hypatius of Ephesus and Demetrius of
  Philippi&mdash;who secretly treated with the Pope in matters of faith, and
  with King Theodahad in affairs of policy&mdash;to enter into a close and
  secret alliance with Theodahad and Byzantium.</p>

  <p>"You are right, Silverius," grumbled Scævola, as they issued from the
  doors of the theatre, "the Prefect unites Marius and Cæsar in one
  person."</p>

  <p>"He does not throw away such immense sums for nothing," said the
  avaricious Albinus warningly; "we must not trust him too far."</p>

  <p>"Beloved brethren," said the priest, "see that you do not lightly condemn
  a member of our community. Who should do this would be worthy of hell-fire!
  Certainly Cethegus commands the fists of the workmen as well as the hearts of
  his young 'knights;' and it is well, for he can therewith break the
  tyranny&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But at the same time he could replace it by new despotism," interrupted
  Calpurnius.</p>

  <p>"That he shall not, if daggers can still kill, as in the time of Brutus!"
  cried Scævola.</p>

  <p>"Bloodshed is not necessary. Consider; the nearer the tyrant, the more
  oppressive the tyranny; the farther the ruler, the more bearable his
  government. The power of the Prefect must be balanced by the power of the
  Emperor."</p>

  <p>"Yes," affirmed Albinus, who had received large sums from Byzantium, "the
  Emperor must become master of Italy."</p>

  <p>"That is," said Silverius, restraining Scævola, who would have interrupted
  indignantly, "we must keep down the Prefect by means of the Emperor, and the
  Emperor by means of the Prefect. See, we have arrived at the door of my
  house. Let us enter. I must tell you in confidence what will be made known to
  the assembly to-night. It will surprise you; but other people still
  more."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the Prefect had also hurried home from the banquet, to prepare
  for his important work by lonely meditation.</p>

  <p>He did not think over his speech; he knew long ago what he had to say;
  and, a splendid orator, to whom words came as readily as thoughts, he
  willingly left the mode of expression to the impulse of the moment, knowing
  well that words which issue spontaneously from the heart, have the liveliest
  effect.</p>

  <p>But he sought for inward composure; for his passions were vividly
  excited.</p>

  <p>He thought over the steps which he had taken in order to reach his goal,
  since first he had been drawn towards it with demoniac force. He measured the
  short space which he had still to tread; he counted the difficulties and
  hindrances which lay upon his path, and measured the strength of mind with
  which he could overcome them; and the result of all this examination awakened
  in him a certainty of victory which filled him with youthful enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>He measured his room with rapid strides; the muscles of his arms swelled
  as if in the hour of battle; he girded himself with the broad and victorious
  sword of his former campaigns, and convulsively grasped the hilt as if he
  were about to fight for his Rome against two worlds: against Byzantium and
  the barbarians.</p>

  <p>He paused before the statue of Cæsar, and looked long at the silent marble
  face.</p>

  <p>"Farewell!" he cried, "give me thy good fortune upon my way. More I do not
  need."</p>

  <p>He turned quickly, and hurried out of the room and through the atrium into
  the street, where the first stars were already shining. The conspirators had
  assembled in the Catacombs on this evening in greater numbers than ever, for
  urgent invitations had been sent through all Italy.</p>

  <p>According to the wish of the Prefect, all strategically important places
  were represented at this meeting. Deputies had been sent from the strong
  warders of the frontiers, Tridentum, Tarvisium, and Verona, which behold the
  ice of the Alps; from Otorantum and Consentia, which are laved by the tepid
  waves of the Ausonian Sea; from all the celebrated towns of Sicily and Italy,
  with the proud, beautiful, and historic names: Syracuse and Catana, Panormus
  and Messana, Regium, Neapolis and Cumæ, Capua and Beneventum, Antium and
  Ostia, Reate and Narnia, Volsinii, Urbsvetus and Spoletum, Clusium and
  Perusia, Auximum and Ancona, Florentia and Fæsulas, Pisa, Luca, Luna and
  Genua; Ariminum, Casena, Faventia, and Ravenna; Parma, Dertona and Placentia;
  Mantua, Cremona, and Ticinum (Pavia); Mediolanum, Comum, and Bergamum; Asta
  and Pollentia; and from the northern and eastern coasts of the Ionian Gulf:
  Concordia, Aquileja, Iadera, Scardona, and Salona.</p>

  <p>There were grave senators and judges, who had grown grey in the councils
  of their towns, where their ancestors had been leaders for centuries; wise
  merchants, broad-shouldered proprietors, disputing jurists, mocking
  rhetoricians, and in particular a great number of clergy of all ranks and all
  ages: the only firmly organised party, and which was implicitly obedient to
  Silverius.</p>

  <p>As Cethegus, still concealed behind the corner of the narrow entrance,
  overlooked the groups assembled in the rotunda of the grotto, he could not
  restrain a contemptuous smile, which, however, ended in a sigh.</p>

  <p>Excepting the general dislike to the barbarians&mdash;which, however, was
  by no means strong enough to support the sacrifices and self-denial necessary
  to the accomplishment of difficult political plans&mdash;what different and
  often what small motives had led these men together!</p>

  <p>Cethegus knew exactly the motives of each individual: had he not been able
  to influence them by taking advantage of their foibles? And, after all, he
  could not but rejoice at this, for he could never have brought true Romans so
  completely under his influence as he had done these conspirators.</p>

  <p>But as he now looked at the assembled patriots, and reflected how one had
  been induced to join the discontented, in the hope of a title from Byzantium;
  another by bribery; another from revenge or on account of some personal
  offence, or even from tedium, or debts, or some foolish dilemma; and when he
  told himself that with <i>such</i> colleagues he must meet the warriors of
  the Gothic army&mdash;he almost shrank from the temerity of his plan.</p>

  <p>It was some relief to him, when the clear voice of Lucius Licinius
  attracted his looks to the troop of young "knights," whose truly martial
  courage and national enthusiasm were expressed on their features; there at
  least he had a few trustworthy weapons.</p>

  <p>"Welcome! Lucius Licinius," he said, as he stepped out of the darkness of
  the passage, "Ha, ha! you are mailed and armed as if we were going straight
  from hence to meet the barbarians!"</p>

  <p>"I can scarcely contain myself for joy and hate!" cried the handsome
  youth. "Look here, all these I have won for you, for the cause of the
  fatherland."</p>

  <p>Cethegus looked round and greeted the others.</p>

  <p>"You here also, Kallistratos? you merry son of peace!"</p>

  <p>"Hellas will not desert her sister Italia in the hour of danger," said the
  Greek, and laid his white hand upon his elegant, ivory-hilted sword.</p>

  <p>Cethegus nodded to him and turned to the rest; Marcus Licinius, Piso,
  Massurius, Balbus, who, completely won for the Prefect since the feast of the
  Floralia, had brought with them their brothers, cousins, and friends.</p>

  <p>Cethegus looked searchingly through the groups; he seemed to miss some
  one.</p>

  <p>Lucius Licinius guessed his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"You seek the dark Corsican, Furius Ahalla? You must not reckon upon him.
  I sounded him thoroughly, but he said: 'I am a Corsican&mdash;no Roman. My
  trade flourishes under Gothic protection. Leave me out your game.' And when I
  pressed him further&mdash;for I would gladly win his brave sword and the many
  thousands of hands which he commands&mdash;he said abruptly: 'I will not
  fight against Totila.'"</p>

  <p>"The Gods alone know what binds the wild tiger to that milksop," said
  Piso.</p>

  <p>Cethegus smiled, but frowned as well.</p>

  <p>"I think we Romans will suffice," he said in a loud voice; and the youths
  looked at him with beating hearts.</p>

  <p>"Open the assembly," said Scævola impatiently to Silverius. "You see how
  he talks over the young people; he will win them all. Interrupt him;
  speak!"</p>

  <p>"Immediately. Are you sure that Albinus will come?"</p>

  <p>"He will; he waits for the messengers at the Appian gate."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the priest, "God be with us!"</p>

  <p>And he stepped into the middle of the rotunda, raised the black cross
  which he held, and began:</p>

  <p>"In the name of the Triune God! We have again assembled in the gloom of
  night for the works of light. Perhaps for the last time; for the Son of God,
  to whom the heretics refuse all honour, has wonderfully blessed our
  endeavours. Next to God, our warmest thanks are due to the noble Emperor
  Justinian and his pious spouse, who listen to the sighs of the suffering
  Church with active sympathy; and, lastly, to our friend and leader here, the
  Prefect, who zealously works for the cause of our master the
  Emperor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop, priest!" cried Lucius Licinius. "Who calls the Emperor of Byzantium
  our <i>master</i>? We will not have the Greeks instead of the Goths! We will
  be free!"</p>

  <p>"We will be free!" echoed the chorus of his friends.</p>

  <p>"We shall <i>become</i> free!" continued Silverius. "Certainly! But that
  is not possible unaided. The Emperor must help us. And do not think, beloved
  youths, that the man whom you honour as your leader, Cethegus, is of a
  different opinion. Justinian has sent him a costly ring&mdash;his portrait in
  carneol&mdash;as a sign that he is contented with the Prefect's services, and
  the Prefect has accepted the ring. Behold, he wears it on his finger."</p>

  <p>Startled and indignant, the youths looked at Cethegus, who silently
  advanced into the middle of the room.</p>

  <p>A painful pause ensued.</p>

  <p>"Speak, General!" cried Lucius; "contradict him! It is not as he says with
  the ring!"</p>

  <p>But Cethegus nodded and drew off the ring.</p>

  <p>"It is as he says. The ring is from the Emperor, and I have accepted
  it."</p>

  <p>Lucius Licinius fell back a step.</p>

  <p>"As a sign?" asked Silverius.</p>

  <p>"As a sign," cried Cethegus, in a threatening voice, "that I am not the
  ambitious egoist for which many take me. As a sign that I love Italy more
  than my ambition. Yes, I built upon Byzantium, and would have given up the
  leadership to the mighty Emperor; therefore I took this ring. I build no more
  upon Byzantium, for she hesitates everlastingly: therefore I have brought the
  ring with me to-day, in order to return it to the Emperor. You, Silverius,
  have proved yourself the representative of Byzantium; here, return his pledge
  to your master; he delays too long. Tell him Italy will help herself!"</p>

  <p>"Italy will help herself!" shouted the young Romans.</p>

  <p>"Reflect what you do!" cried the priest with restrained anger. "I
  understand the hot courage of youth&mdash;but that my friend, the ripe and
  experienced man, stretches forth his hand for what is
  unattainable&mdash;<i>that</i> surprises me! Remember the strength and
  ferocity of the barbarians! Reflect that the Italians are unused to arms,
  that all the fortresses of the country are in the hands&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be silent, priest," thundered Cethegus. "You do not understand such
  matters! Speak where the psalms have to be explained or souls led to heaven,
  for that is your office; but where war and fighting are concerned, let those
  speak who understand! We will leave you all heaven&mdash;leave the earth to
  us. Roman youths, you have the choice. Will you wait until this cautious
  Byzantium vouchsafes to take pity upon Italy?&mdash;you may become weary old
  men before then!&mdash;or will you in old Roman fashion, win freedom with
  your own swords? You will; I see it by your sparkling eyes. How? They tell us
  we are too weak to liberate Italy! Ha! were not your fathers Romans, who
  conquered the world? If I call upon you, man by man, there is not a name
  which does not ring with the fame of a hero. Decius, Corvinus, Cornelius,
  Valerius, Licinius&mdash;will you free the fatherland with me?"</p>

  <p>"We will! Lead us, Cethegus!" cried the youth with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>After a pause Scævola began:</p>

  <p>"My name is Scævola. When the names of Roman heroes are cited, the race
  which inherits the heroism of the Celts might have been remembered. I ask
  you, Cethegus, have you more than dreams and wishes, like these young fools?
  have you a plan?"</p>

  <p>"More than that, Scævola, I have, and will keep, the victory! Here is a
  list of all the fortresses in Italy. At the next Ides, that is in thirty
  days, they will fall, at one blow, into my hands."</p>

  <p>"What? must we still wait thirty days?" asked Lucius.</p>

  <p>"Only till the deputies assembled here have again reached their towns.
  Only till my expresses have flown through Italy. You have <i>had</i> to wait
  forty years!"</p>

  <p>But the impatience of the youths, which he himself had excited, was not to
  be subdued; they looked gloomy at the postponement&mdash;they murmured.</p>

  <p>The priest was quick to take advantage of this change of humour.</p>

  <p>"No, Cethegus," he cried; "we cannot delay so long! Tyranny is unbearable
  to the noble-minded; shame upon him who endures it longer than he must! I
  know of better comfort, youths! In a few days the spears of Belisarius may
  flash in Italian sunshine."</p>

  <p>"Or shall we, perhaps," asked Scævola, "refuse to follow Belisarius
  because he is not Cethegus?"</p>

  <p>"You speak of wishes," cried Cethegus, "not of realities. If Belisarius
  land, I shall be the first to join him. But he will not land. It is this
  which has disgusted me; the Emperor does not keep his word."</p>

  <p>Cethegus played a very bold game. But he could not do otherwise.</p>

  <p>"You may err," said Silverius, "and the Emperor may fulfil his promise
  sooner than you think. Belisarius lies off Sicily."</p>

  <p>"Not now. He has gone towards Africa, towards home. Hope nothing from
  Belisarius."</p>

  <p>Just then hasty steps were heard in the passage, and Albinus rushed
  in.</p>

  <p>"Triumph!" he cried. "Freedom! freedom!"</p>

  <p>"What news?" asked the priest.</p>

  <p>"War! deliverance! Byzantium has declared war against the Goths!"</p>

  <p>"Freedom! war!" shouted the Romans.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible!" said Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"It is certain!" cried another voice from the entrance&mdash;it was
  Calpurnius, who had followed close upon Albinus. "And, more than this, the
  war has commenced. Belisarius has landed in Sicily, at Catana; Syracusæ and
  Messana have surrendered; Panormus he has taken with the fleet. He has
  crossed to Italy, from Messana to Regium; he is upon Italian soil!"</p>

  <p>"Freedom!" cried Marcus Licinius.</p>

  <p>"Everywhere the population joins him. The Goths, taken by surprise, fly
  from Apulia and Calabria. Belisarius presses on without pause, through
  Bruttia and Lucania, to Neapolis."</p>

  <p>"It is all lies&mdash;lies!" cried Cethegus, more to himself than to the
  others.</p>

  <p>"You do not seem pleased at the success of the good cause! But the
  messenger rode three horses to death. Belisarius has landed with thirty
  thousand men."</p>

  <p>"Who still doubts is a traitor!" cried Scævola.</p>

  <p>"Now let us see," said Silverius to Cethegus sarcastically, "if you will
  keep your word. Will you be the first to join Belisarius?"</p>

  <p>At this bitter moment a whole world&mdash;<i>his</i> world&mdash;sank
  before the eyes of Cethegus. So, then, all had been in vain; worse than
  that&mdash;what he had done, had been done for a hated enemy. Belisarius in
  Italy with a strong army, and he deceived, powerless, conquered! Any other
  man would have given up all further effort.</p>

  <p>But not a shadow of discouragement crossed the mind of the Prefect. His
  gigantic edifice was shattered; the noise of its fall still deafened him, and
  yet at the same moment he had already resolved to begin again.</p>

  <p>His world was destroyed, and he had no time even to sigh, for the eyes of
  all were fixed upon him.</p>

  <p>"Well, what will you do?" repeated Scævola.</p>

  <p>Cethegus disdained to look at him.</p>

  <p>He turned to the assembly, and spoke in a quiet voice:</p>

  <p>"Belisarius has landed," he said; "he is now our leader. I shall at once
  go to his camp."</p>

  <p>With this he walked, with measured steps and a composed countenance, past
  Silverius and his friends towards the exit.</p>

  <p>Silverius would have whispered a word of sarcasm, but he was startled at
  the glance which the Prefect cast upon him.</p>

  <p>"Do not rejoice too soon, priest," it seemed to say; "you will repent this
  hour!" And Silverius, the victor, was dumb.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="b3-9"
     name="b3-9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">The landing of the Byzantines had taken both Goths and
  Italians by surprise; for the last move of Belisarius to the east had misled
  both parties.</p>

  <p>Of all our Gothic friends, Totila alone was in South Italy. He had, in his
  office as commodore and Count of the Harbour of Neapolis, in vain warned the
  Government of Ravenna of the impending danger, and begged for the power and
  means of defending Sicily.</p>

  <p>We shall see how he had been deprived of all possibility of preventing the
  catastrophe which threatened to overwhelm his nation, and which was to throw
  the first shadow upon the brilliant path of his own life, and tear the web of
  good fortune which a happy fate had, until now, woven about this favourite of
  the gods.</p>

  <p>Valerius, who, though stern, had a noble and kindly nature, had soon been
  won by Totila's irresistible amiability. We have seen how strongly the
  prayers of his daughter, the memory of his wife's last words, and Totila's
  frankness, had influenced the worthy man, even when he was irritated at the
  discovery of the lovers' secret meetings.</p>

  <p>Totila remained at the villa as a guest. Julius, with his winning
  affection, was called upon to help the lovers, and to their united influence
  the father gradually yielded.</p>

  <p>But this was only possible because Totila assimilated to the Romans more
  nearly in manners, education, and inclinations than any other Goth: so that
  Valerius soon saw that he could not call a youth a "barbarian" who knew and
  appreciated the language, wisdom, and beauty of Hellenic and Roman literature
  better than most Italians, and admired the culture of the ancient world no
  less than he loved his fellow-countrymen.</p>

  <p>And, in addition to all this, a common hatred of Byzantium united the old
  Roman and the young German.</p>

  <p>The Valerians had always belonged to the aristocratic Republican
  opposition against the Cæsars, and, since the time of Tiberius, many a member
  of this family had sealed with his blood his fidelity to the cause of Old
  Republicanism.</p>

  <p>The family had never really acknowledged the removal of the Empire of the
  World from the city on the Tiber to that on the Bosphorus. In the Byzantine
  imperial dignity Valerius beheld the acme of all tyranny, and, at any cost,
  would gladly have saved his Latium from the avarice, religious intolerance,
  and Oriental despotism of the Byzantine Emperors.</p>

  <p>Added to this, the father and brother of Valerius had been arrested at
  Byzantium by an avaricious predecessor of Justinian, while passing through
  that city, and, on pretence of participation in a conspiracy, had been
  executed, and all their eastern possessions had been confiscated; so that
  private loss considerably strengthened the political hatred of the patriot.
  When Cethegus introduced him to the conspiracy of the Catacombs, he had
  eagerly taken up the idea of an Italian rebellion; but had repulsed all
  advances of the imperial party with the words, "Rather death than
  Byzantium!"</p>

  <p>So the two, Valerius and Totila, were unanimous in the resolution to
  tolerate no Byzantine in their beloved country, which was scarcely less dear
  to the Goth than to the Roman.</p>

  <p>The lovers took care not to press the old man, at present, to make any
  formal promise; they contented themselves with the freedom of intercourse
  allowed by Valerius, and waited quietly until the influence of habit should
  gradually accustom him to the thought of their ultimate union.</p>

  <p>Our young friends thus passed many happy days, and, added to the bliss of
  their mutual love, they had the delight of witnessing the growing affection
  of Valerius for Totila.</p>

  <p>Julius was filled with the noble exaltation which lies in the sacrifice of
  one's own passion for the sake of another's happiness. His soul, unsatisfied
  by the wisdom of old philosophy, turned more and more to the doctrine which
  teaches that peace is only to be found in self-denial.</p>

  <p>Valeria was of a very different nature. She was the true expression of the
  Roman ideal of her father, who had conducted her education in place of her
  early-lost mother, and had imbued her with the spirit of the antique Pagans.
  Christianity&mdash;to which she hard been dedicated by an outward form at the
  very commencement of her life, and from which she had afterwards been wrested
  by an equally external formality&mdash;seemed to her a fearful power, by no
  means loved or understood, but which, nevertheless, she could not exclude
  from the circle of her thoughts and feelings.</p>

  <p>Like a true Roman, she noticed with joy and pride, not with dismay, the
  martial enthusiasm with which Totila spoke to her father in their
  conversations concerning Byzantium. She felt that he was born to be a hero,
  and so, when duty suddenly called him away from love and friendship, she bore
  the parting with noble self-control.</p>

  <p>For as soon as the Byzantine fleet was known to be cruising off Syracusæ,
  the young Goth was inflamed with an insatiable thirst for war. It was his
  duty, as commodore of the South Italian squadron, to watch the movements of
  the enemy and protect the coast. He promptly set sail to meet the Grecian
  fleet, and demanded the reason of its appearance in those waters. Belisarius,
  who had orders to avoid all inimical proceedings until called upon to
  commence hostilities by Petros, gave a peaceful and plausible answer,
  alleging as his pretext the disturbances in Africa and the piracies of
  Mauritanian ships. Totila was obliged to content himself with this reply, but
  in his heart he was sure that the war would soon break out; perhaps only
  because he so ardently desired it.</p>

  <p>He therefore took all precautions: sent messengers with warnings to
  Ravenna, and, above all, essayed to protect the city of Neapolis at least
  towards the sea, for the inland fortifications had fallen into decay during
  the long peace, and old Uliaris, the commander of the city, was not to be
  shaken out of his proud security and contempt of the Greeks.</p>

  <p>The Goths in general cherished the dangerous delusion that the Byzantines
  would never dare to attack them; and their treacherous King did all in his
  power to strengthen this belief.</p>

  <p>The warnings of Totila, therefore, were disregarded, and the zealous
  commodore was even deprived of his whole fleet, which was ordered to the
  Harbour of Ravenna, on the pretext of an exchange; but the ships which should
  have replaced those which had sailed away never arrived.</p>

  <p>So Totila had nothing left but a few small guardships, with which, as he
  declared to his friends, he could not even sufficiently watch the movements
  of the enemy, much less prevent their advance.</p>

  <p>When apprised of all this, the merchant determined to leave his villa at
  Neapolis, and to go to his rich estates and mercantile establishments at
  Regium, on the south point of the peninsula, in order to remove all his most
  valuable property from that neighbourhood&mdash;where Totila feared the first
  attack of the enemy&mdash;and bring it to Neapolis; and also to make his
  preparations in case of a prolonged war.</p>

  <p>Julius was to accompany him on this journey; and Valeria was not to be
  persuaded to remain behind in the empty villa; so, as Totila assured them
  that no danger was to be feared for the next few days, the three, accompanied
  by a few slaves, journeyed to the villa on the estate near the Pass of Jugum,
  to the north of Regium, which, situated close to the sea, was partly, with
  all the luxury already so severely blamed by Horace, "daringly built out"
  into the very sea itself.</p>

  <p>Valerius found things in a bad condition. His stewards, taking advantage
  of the prolonged absence of their master, had made sad work, and Valerius saw
  with indignation that, in order to repair the mischief, his presence would be
  necessary, not for days, but for weeks.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the threatening symptoms increased. Totila sent many warning
  messages; but Valeria decided that she could not leave her father while in
  danger, and the latter scorned to fly before the "degenerate Greeks," whom he
  still more despised than hated.</p>

  <p>One day they were surprised by the arrival of two boats, which ran into
  the little harbour of the villa at Regium almost at the same moment. One
  brought Totila; the other the Corsican, Furius Ahalla.</p>

  <p>The two greeted each other with surprise, but, as old acquaintances, were
  well pleased to meet, and walked together through the taxus-hedges and laurel
  walks to the villa. There they parted, Totila saying that he wished to pay a
  visit to his friend Julius, while the Corsican had business with the
  merchant, with whom he had for years been connected in a commerce which was
  equally advantageous to both parties.</p>

  <p>Valerius was therefore much pleased to see the clever, bold, and handsome
  sailor enter his room, and after a hearty welcome, the two business-friends
  turned to their books and accounts.</p>

  <p>After some short discussion, the Corsican rose from his examination of the
  books, and said:</p>

  <p>"So you see, Valerius, that Mercurius has again blessed our connection. My
  ships have brought you purple and costly woollen stuffs from Phoenicia and
  Spain; and taken your exquisite manufactures of last year to Byzantium and
  Alexandria, to Massilia and Antiochia. A centenarius of gold more profit than
  last year! And so it will go on rising from year to year, so long as the
  brave Goths uphold peace and justice in the West."</p>

  <p>He ceased, as if in expectation.</p>

  <p>"So long as they <i>can</i> uphold it!" sighed Valerius. "So long as these
  Greeks keep the peace! Who can guarantee that to-night the sea-breeze may not
  drive the ships of Belisarius towards these coasts!"</p>

  <p>"So you, too, expect war? In confidence: it is more than probable, it is
  certain."</p>

  <p>"Furius!" cried the Roman, "how do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"I come from Africa&mdash;from Sicily. I have seen the fleet of the
  Emperor. One does not arm against pirates in such a manner. I have spoken to
  the captains of Belisarius; they dream night and day of the treasures of
  Italy. Sicily is ripe for defection, as soon as the Greeks land."</p>

  <p>Valerius grew pale with excitement.</p>

  <p>Furius remarked it, and continued.</p>

  <p>"For this reason I have come here to warn you. The enemy will land in this
  vicinity, and I know&mdash;that your daughter is with you."</p>

  <p>"Valeria is a Roman."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but these enemies are the most ferocious barbarians. For it is Huns,
  Massagetæ, Scythians, Avari, Sclavonians, and Saracens which this Emperor of
  the Romans lets loose upon Italy! Woe to your lovely child should she fall
  into their hands."</p>

  <p>"That she shall not!" cried Valerius, his hand upon his dagger. "But you
  are right&mdash;she must go&mdash;she must be placed in safety."</p>

  <p>"Where is safety in Italy? Soon the billows of the conflict will roll over
  Neapolis&mdash;over Rome&mdash;and will scarcely break against the walls of
  Ravenna!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think so highly of these Greeks? Yet Greece has never sent
  anything to Italy but mimes, pirates, and pickpockets!"</p>

  <p>"But Belisarius is the favourite of fortune. At all events, a war will be
  kindled, the end of which many of you will not outlive!"</p>

  <p>"Of <i>us</i>, you say? Will not <i>you</i> fight with us?"</p>

  <p>"No, Valerius! You know that pure Corsican blood flows in my veins, in
  spite of my adopted Roman name. I am no Roman, no Greek, and no Goth. I wish
  the Goths the victory, because they keep order on land and sea, and my trade
  flourishes under their sway; but were I to fight openly on their side, the
  exchequer of Byzantium would swallow up all that I possess in ships and goods
  in the harbours of the East: three-fourths of my whole fortune. No, I intend
  so to fortify my island&mdash;you know that half Corsica is mine&mdash;that
  neither of the disputants can molest me. My island shall be an asylum of
  peace, while round about land and water echo with the noise of battle. I
  shall defend this asylum as a king defends his crown, or a bridegroom his
  bride; and therefore"&mdash;his eyes sparkled, and his voice trembled with
  excitement&mdash;"therefore I wish&mdash;now&mdash;to speak a word which for
  years I have carried hidden in my heart&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>Valerius saw beforehand what was coming, and saw it with deep regret. For
  years he had pleased himself with the thought of entrusting his daughter's
  happiness to this powerful merchant, the adopted son of an old friend, of
  whose affection to Valeria he had long been aware. Although he had learned to
  love Totila, he would far rather have had his old friend for a
  son-in-law.</p>

  <p>And he knew the ungovernable pride and irritable temper of the Corsican;
  he feared, in case of refusal, that the old love and friendship would be
  speedily changed to burning hate. Dark stories were told of the wild rage of
  this man, and Valerius would gladly have spared both him and himself the pain
  of a rejection.</p>

  <p>But the other continued:</p>

  <p>"I think we are both men who do business in a business-like manner. And,
  according to old custom, I speak at once to the father, and not first to the
  daughter. Give me your child to wife, Valerius! In part you know my
  fortune&mdash;only in part&mdash;for it is far larger than you think. I will
  match her dowry, be it never so splendid, with the double&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Furius!" interrupted the father.</p>

  <p>"I think I am a man who can make his wife happy. At least, I can protect
  her better than any one else in these dangerous times. I will take her in my
  ships, should Corsica be threatened, to Asia or to Africa. On every coast
  there awaits her, not a house, but a palace. No queen could envy her. I will
  cherish, her more dearly&mdash;more dearly than my life!"</p>

  <p>He paused in extreme agitation, as if expecting a prompt reply.</p>

  <p>Valerius was silent, he sought for an excuse&mdash;it was but a moment,
  but the bare appearance of hesitation on the father's part revolted the
  Corsican. The blood rushed to his handsome face, which, just before almost
  soft and mild, suddenly assumed an aspect of ferocity; a vivid red flush
  spread over his brown cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Furius Ahalla," he said hastily, "is not accustomed to offer a thing
  twice. Usually my wares, at the first offer, are snatched at with both hands.
  I now offer myself&mdash;by God! I am not worse than my
  purple&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My friend," began the old man, "we no longer live in ancient times. The
  new belief has almost deprived a father of the right to dispose of his
  daughter. My <i>will</i> would give her to you and to no other, but her
  heart&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She loves another!" cried the Corsican, "whom?"</p>

  <p>And his hand caught at his dagger, as if he would gladly have killed his
  rival on the instant.</p>

  <p>There was something of the tiger in this movement, and in the glare of his
  rolling eyes.</p>

  <p>Valerius felt how deadly would be his hatred, and would not mention the
  name.</p>

  <p>"Who can it be?" asked Furius, in an under tone. "A Roman? Montanus? No!
  Oh, only&mdash;only not <i>he</i>&mdash;say no, old man! not
  he&mdash;&mdash;" and he caught Valerius by the sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Who? Whom do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"He, who landed with me&mdash;the Goth! But yes it must be he&mdash;every
  one loves him&mdash;Totila!"</p>

  <p>"It is he," said Valerius, and kindly tried to take his friend's hand. But
  he released it again in terror; a fearful convulsion shook the iron frame of
  the strong Corsican. He stretched forth his hand stiffly, as if he would
  strangle the pain which tortured him. Then he tossed back his head, and,
  laughing wildly, struck his forehead repeatedly.</p>

  <p>Valerius observed this mad fit with horror. At last the arms of the
  enraged man slowly dropped, and revealed an ashy-pale face.</p>

  <p>"It is over," said Furius in a trembling voice. "It is a curse that lies
  upon me. I am never to be happy in a wife. Once before&mdash;just before
  accomplishment! And now! I know that Valeria's influence and quiet composure
  would have brought peace into my wild life&mdash;I should have become
  different, better. And if this could not have been"&mdash;his eyes again
  sparkled&mdash;"it would have been almost equally sweet to murder the
  destroyer of my happiness. Yes, I would have wallowed in his blood, and torn
  his bride away from his corpse! And now it is <i>he</i>! He, the only being
  to whom Ahalla owes gratitude&mdash;and what gratitude!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was silent, nodding his head as if lost in recollection.</p>

  <p>"Valerius," he then said, suddenly rousing himself, "I would yield to no
  man on earth&mdash;I could not have borne to give place to another&mdash;but
  Totila! I will forgive her for not loving me, because she has chosen Totila.
  Farewell, Valerius, old friend. I go to sea; to Persia, to India&mdash;I know
  not whither&mdash;ah! everywhere I shall carry with me the bitter pain of
  this hour!"</p>

  <p>He went quickly out, and immediately afterwards his arrow-swift boat bore
  him away from the little harbour of the villa.</p>

  <p>Valerius left the room sighing, and went in search of his daughter.</p>

  <p>In the atrium he met Totila, who was obliged to take leave at once. He had
  only come to try to persuade them to return to Neapolis. For Belisarius had
  left the African coast and was cruising near Panormus, and any day a descent
  might be effected in Sicily or even Italy; and, in spite of Totila's
  insistence, the King had sent no ships. He himself was shortly going to
  Sicily to convince himself of the truth. His friends, therefore, were here
  totally unprotected, and he begged Valerius to return forthwith to Neapolis
  by land.</p>

  <p>But it revolted the old soldier to fly before the Greeks; he could not and
  would not leave his affairs before three days; and Totila could scarcely
  persuade him to accept a small troop of twenty Goths as a poor
  protection.</p>

  <p>With a heavy heart Totila entered his boat and was taken back to his
  guardship. It was almost dark when he arrived on board; a veil of mist
  shrouded the nearest objects.</p>

  <p>All at once the sound of oars was heard to the west, and a ship,
  recognisable by the red light on the tall mast, turned the point of a small
  promontory.</p>

  <p>Totila listened, and asked his look-out:</p>

  <p>"A sail to the left! what ship? what master?"</p>

  <p>"It is already signalled from the mast-head," was the reply,
  "merchant-ship&mdash;Furius Ahalla&mdash;lay at anchor here."</p>

  <p>"Where bound?"</p>

  <p>"For the East&mdash;for India!"</p>
