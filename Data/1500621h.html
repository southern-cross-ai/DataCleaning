  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

  <p class="first">Some years ago I was at work in Salzburg: in the library
  among the old records, and in the Museum of Roman antiquities.</p>

  <p>My studies were principally concerned with the fifth century: the time
  when the Germanic tribes invaded these regions, the Roman garrisons retiring
  with or without resistance, while many settlers remained in the land.
  Peasants, trades-people, mechanics, would not forsake their homes, nor give
  up their lucrative occupations, would not quit their valued, long-cherished
  plots of ground, but stayed under the rule of the Barbarian; who, when the
  storm and battle of conquest were over, and the division of the country
  completed, did not molest them.</p>

  <p>The work of the day over, I wandered in the beautiful, long-familiar
  country of the Salzach valley; the warm June evenings permitted long
  wanderings up to a late hour. Thought and fancy were filled with the pictures
  of the life and the changing fate of the latest Romans in these lands. My
  imagination was excited by the inscriptions, coins, and utensils, by the
  Roman monuments of every kind which are found in such rich abundance in and
  around Salzburg; for this town, with its prominent fortress, the
  "Capitolium," on the rocky hill dominating stream and valley, was for
  centuries, under the name of "Claudium Juvavum," a chief bulwark of the Roman
  rule and the seat of a flourishing and brilliant development of the Roman
  culture. The inscriptions testify to the official rank of many of the
  citizens, such as Duumvirs, Decurions, Ædiles of the markets and games; to
  the importance of the town as a place of trade, and to the encouragement
  given to the arts and manufactures.</p>

  <p>That which had occupied me during the labours of the day was pictured by
  the play of fancy, when in the evening I wandered out through the gate of the
  town: stream and road, hill and valley, were then peopled for me with forms
  of the Roman life; and from the distant north-west, like the driving clouds
  that often arose from the Bavarian plain, approached menacingly the invading
  Germans.</p>

  <p>Most frequently, I preferred to saunter along the banks of the stream in
  the direction of the great Roman road, which passed the Chiemsee, and
  crossing its effluent, the Alz, at Siebruck (Bedaium), and the Inn (Oenus) at
  Pfünz (Pons Oeni), led towards the province of Vindelicia and its splendid
  capital, Augsburg (Augusta Vindelicorum). Many coins, fragments of pottery,
  urns, gravestones, and household utensils of every kind have been found in
  the level country which stretches on each side of the old highroad, and is
  now for the most part covered with forest and brushwood, and in some parts
  overgrown with thick ivy. It is evident that farms, and also stately villas
  of the rich citizens, were thickly scattered beyond the outer wall of the
  fortified town, thus filling and adorning the whole valley. I often wandered
  in the neighbourhood of this Roman road, the traces of which were still
  distinctly visible, watching the setting sun, and wondering what were the
  feelings of the inhabitants of these villas, when, instead of the proud
  Legions marching by on their way to the Roman town on the Lech, it was the
  first weak bands of the Germans from the conquered Vindelicia who galloped
  in, carefully reconnoitring; and soon to be followed by larger masses, more
  daring, or rather having the well-grounded confidence that they would find
  the country only weakly defended, and would be able to establish themselves
  as masters over the defenceless Romans who still remained.</p>

  <p>In such fancies, not without the silent wish that I might myself glean
  some small memorial of Roman times from this land so rich in remembrances, I
  penetrated one evening deeper into the brushwood on the right of the Roman
  road, following upwards the course of a small stream, through a hollow often
  strewn with broken stones and potsherds, which moss and ivy had thickly
  overgrown, and which cracked not seldom, under my footsteps. I picked up many
  tiles and bits of pottery. Were they Roman? No certain evidence could be
  gathered from <i>these</i>.</p>

  <p>I determined to-day to follow the rivulet till I should reach its source,
  which I imagined to be under the gentle slope of a moderately high hill; for
  I knew that the Romans liked to build their quiet villas as well as their
  military stations by running water.</p>

  <p>It was very hot on that summer day, I was tired in body and mind, and it
  was only slowly, and with difficulty, that I could ascend the course of the
  brook, forcing my way through the thick and often nearly impassable bushes by
  the help of my alpenstock, which I carried with, me, as I often climbed the
  mountains in my wanderings.</p>

  <p>I could willingly have stretched myself drowsily on the soft inviting
  moss; but I resisted the inclination, and determined to press through and up
  to the goal I had set myself: the source of the stream.</p>

  <p>In half an hour the slope was reached; the height is called by the people,
  "the Pagan mound." Along the latter part of the way I had noticed a striking
  increase in the number and size of the fragments of stone; among them also
  were red and gray marble, like that which had been quarried in the
  neighbourhood for unnumbered centuries; and it was, as I had imagined, close
  under the crown of the hill the stream trickled out of the ground.</p>

  <p>It appeared to have been once surrounded by masonry; this was in part
  still perceptible, carefully polished clear gray marble enclosed it here and
  there in a handsome setting, and round about lay scattered numerous tiles. My
  heart beat quickly, not only in consequence of the arduous climb, but also, I
  confess it, in hopeful expectation, I was yet very young. Suppose if to-day
  and here, Mercury, the Roman, or Wotan, the German god of wishes and
  discovery, should give into my hand the long-desired memorial of the Romans
  of Juvavum; the name "Pagan mound" gave undoubted evidence of the Roman
  occupation&mdash;for the Roman road is here called the "Pagan
  road"&mdash;added to this, the source of the spring, the traces of the marble
  setting, the many tiles&mdash;then the sun's rays, just before setting, fell
  across the brushwood and shone directly on the tile-slab lying before me.
  Cement! I picked it up and tested it; it was without doubt that Roman cement
  which, becoming hard as stone during the lapse of centuries, so marks out the
  buildings of eternal Rome, I turned the piece over; there, O joy! was burnt
  in the undoubted motto of the Twenty-second Legion: <i>Primigenia pia
  fidelis!</i> And as I bend down, highly pleased, to try the next brick, a yet
  stronger sunbeam falls on a piece of peculiar light-gray stone. It is marble,
  I see now, and on the surface there are three Roman letters distinctly
  visible: "hic...." There the stone was broken; but close to it, the broken
  edge of a similar piece of gray stone projected from the moss and ivy. Does
  the continuation of the inscription lie here buried under a covering of moss
  and turf?</p>

  <p>I pulled at the stone, but it was too heavy, either from the load of earth
  or from its own size.</p>

  <p>After some useless efforts, I found that I must clear off the layers of
  turf and moss before the marble would entrust me with its secret.</p>

  <p>Had it one to narrate? Certainly! I held the commencement in my hand:
  "Hic," "here"&mdash;<i>what</i> had here taken place, or was here
  attested?</p>

  <p>After I had with my pocket-knife cleared the first piece from earth and
  root-fibres, I held its broken surface to that of the still covered slab;
  they fitted very well together. Then I set to work; it was not easy, not soon
  over; with hand, knife, and the point of my alpenstock, I had to scrape and
  tear away fully two feet of turf, earth, moss, and, toughest of all, the
  numerous little roots of the clasping ivy; although the sun was setting and
  the breeze was cool, the labour made me very hot; the perspiration fell from
  my brow on the old Roman stone, which now showed itself as a tolerably long
  slab. After the first few minutes my zeal was sharpened by perceiving more
  letters. It was at last so far laid bare that I could take hold of the edges
  with both hands, and with some little jerks bring it fully to view. I then
  held the broken stone with the deciphered <i>hic</i> against it; this gave me
  the direction in which farther to search.</p>

  <p>I hastily scraped away earth, stones, and moss from the cutting of the
  letters, for it was quickly getting darker, and I wished to make out at once
  the long-buried secret. I succeeded; without question, though certainly with
  difficulty, I read the inscription, in two lines under each other:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Hic habitat Felicitas.<br>
  Nihil mali intret.</p><br>

  <p>The two last letters of the third word alone were missing; the stone was
  here broken away, and its companion piece was not to be found; but it was
  self-evident that the missing letters were&mdash;as&mdash;the inscription
  meant:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Here dwells happiness;<br>
  May nothing evil enter in.</p><br>

  <p>Clearly the gray marble slab had formed the threshold of the entrance to
  the garden or porch of the villa; and the adage expressed the wish that all
  evil might be kept far from the door.</p>

  <p>I sought in vain for yet farther traces, for remains of household
  utensils.</p>

  <p>Pleased and satisfied with the discovery of the pretty proverb, I then
  rested.</p>

  <p>Wiping my heated brow, I sat down on the soft moss by my work, thinking
  again and again of the words; I supported my back against an old oak, which
  had grown up out of the rubbish of the house, or, perhaps, out of the good
  mould of the little garden.</p>

  <p>A wondrous quiet reigned over the hill, which was quite separated from the
  world by trees and bushes.</p>

  <p>Only very, very faintly one heard the trickling of the small, scanty vein
  of water which came out of the earth close by me, and only sometimes, when it
  found a quicker fall, rippled more strongly. Once, no doubt, when handsomely
  enclosed in the clear gray marble, it had spoken loader.</p>

  <p>In the distance, on the summit of a high beech, the golden oriole sang its
  flute-like evening song, which told of still deeper forest loneliness, for
  the listener seldom hears the notes of the "Pirol," except in such a
  solitude. Bees hummed here and there over the mossy carpet, coming out of the
  dark thicket and seeking the warmer light, sleepy themselves and lulling to
  sleep with their humming.</p>

  <p>I thought, whose "happiness" once dwelt here? And has the wish of the
  inscription been fulfilled? Was the proverb powerful enough to keep off all
  evil? The stone which bore it is broken&mdash;a bad sign. And what kind of
  happiness was this? But stay! At that time Felicitas occurs as a <i>woman's
  name</i>; perhaps the proverb, with a graceful double meaning, would say:
  "Here dwells happiness; that is to say, my Felicitas; may nothing evil come
  over her, over our threshold!"</p>

  <p>But "Felicitas"&mdash;who was she? and who was he, whose happiness she had
  been, and what had become of them? And this villa, how&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

  <p>This was my last waking thought, for with the last question I fell
  asleep.</p>

  <p>And long did I slumber; for when the song of the nightingale, loudly
  exultant, close to my ear, awoke me, it was dark night; a single star shone
  through the branches of the oak. I sprang up: "Felicitas! Fulvius!" I cried,
  "Liuthari! Felicitas! where are they?"</p>

  <p>"Felicitas!" softly repeated the echo from the hill. All else was still
  and dark.</p>

  <p>So was it a dream?</p>

  <p>Now, <i>this</i> dream I will retain.</p>

  <p>Felicitas, I hold thee!</p>

  <p>Thou shalt not escape me.</p>

  <p>Poetical fancy can immortalise thee.</p>

  <p>And I hastened home, and the same night noted down the history which I had
  dreamt among the ruins of the old Roman villa.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a beautiful evening in June, The sun threw its golden
  beams from the west, from Vindelicia, on the Mercurius Hill, and the modest
  villa which crowned it.</p>

  <p>Here and there on the great street a two-wheeled cart, drawn by a yoke of
  Noric oxen, was returning home at the close of the market-day through the
  west gate of Juvavum, the <i>Porta Vindelica</i>. The colonists and peasants
  had been selling vegetables, fowls, and pigeons in the Forum of Hercules; but
  the bustle of the street reached the hill only as a murmur. Here it was still
  and quiet; one only heard outside the low stone wall which surrounded the
  garden the lively rippling of a little spring, which at its source was
  prettily enclosed in marble, and after it had fed the fountain in the middle,
  and had wandered through the garden in artificially winding rivulets, escaped
  through a gap in the wall and hurried down the hill in a stone channel. Close
  by was the gate entrance, surmounted by a statue of Mercury, but open,
  without door or lattice. In the direction of the town, towards the
  south-east, there lay at the foot of the hill carefully tended vegetable and
  fruit gardens, meadows with the most succulent verdure, and corn-fields with
  luxuriant grain, which products the Romans had brought into the land of the
  barbarians.</p>

  <p>Behind the villa, towards the north, fine beech-woods towered and rustled,
  ascending the mountain slopes; and out of their depths sounded from afar the
  metallic note of the golden oriole.</p>

  <p>It was so beautiful, so peaceful; but from the west&mdash;and no less from
  the south-east!&mdash;threatening storm-clouds were rising.</p>

  <p>From the entrance a straight path, strewn with white sand, led through the
  wide-spreading garden, between tall ilices and yews, which according to the
  long ruling fashion had been cut into all kinds of geometrical
  figures&mdash;a taste, or rather want of taste, which the Rococo did not
  invent, but only newly borrowed from the gardens of the Imperators.</p>

  <p>Statues were placed at regular intervals in the space between the garden
  gate and the entrance to the dwelling-house: nymphs, a Flora, a satyr, a
  Mercury&mdash;bad work in plaster; the stout Crispus made them by the dozen
  in his workshop on the Vulcan market-place in Juvavum; and he sold them
  cheap: for the times were not good for <i>men</i>, and were bad for gods and
  demi-gods; but these were all gifts, for Crispus was the father's brother of
  the young householder.</p>

  <p>From the entrance of the garden, echoing from the stone wall of the
  enclosure, there sounded several strokes of a hammer, only lightly, for they
  were given carefully by an artist-hand; they seemed to be the last improving,
  finishing efforts of a master.</p>

  <p>Now the hammerer sprang up; he had been kneeling just within the entrance,
  near to which, standing upright against each other, were some dozen yet
  unworked marble slabs, which pointed out the dwelling of a stone-mason. He
  stuck the little hammer into the leather belt which fastened the skin apron
  over his blue tunic, shook from a little oil-flask a few drops on a woollen
  cloth, rubbed therewith the marble till it was smooth as a mirror, turned his
  head aside, as a bird will that wishes to look closely at anything, and then,
  nodding well pleased, read from the slab at the entrance:</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes! here dwells happiness; <i>my</i> happiness, <i>our</i>
  happiness: so long as my Felicitas dwells here&mdash;happy and making happy.
  May misfortune never step over this threshold: banished by the adage, may
  every bad spirit Halt! Now is the house beautifully finished by this
  inscription. But where is she, then? She must see it and praise me.
  Felicitas," cried he, turning towards the house, "come then!"</p>

  <p>He wiped the sweat from his brow, and stood upright&mdash;a supple,
  youthful form, slender, not above the middle height, not unlike the Mercury
  of the garden, whose proportions Crispus had formed according to old
  tradition; dark-brown hair, in short curls, covered almost like a cap his
  round head; under large eyebrows, two dark eyes laughed pleasantly on the
  world; the naked feet and arms showed a fine shape, but little strength; only
  in the right arm powerful muscles raised themselves; the brown skin apron was
  sprinkled white with marble dust, he shook it off, and cried again louder,
  "Felicitas!"</p>

  <p>Then appeared on the threshold of the house a white figure, who, drawing
  back the dark-yellow curtain, which was fastened to rings running on a bronze
  rod, was framed like a picture in the two pilasters of the entrance&mdash;a
  quite young girl&mdash;or was it a young wife? Yes, she must be already a
  wife, this child of hardly seventeen years, for she is without doubt the
  mother of the infant which, with her left arm, she nestles to her bosom: only
  the mother holds a child with such expression in the movements and
  countenance. Two fingers of the right hand, the inner surface turned
  outwards, the young mother laid on her lips: "Be quiet!" said she, "our child
  sleeps." And now the hardly full-ripe form glided down the four stone steps
  which led from the house into the garden, with the left arm carefully raising
  the child higher and pressing it closer, with the right gently lifting the
  hem of her plaited robe as high as her well-formed ankles. It was a spectacle
  of perfect grace: young and childlike, like Raphael's Madonna, but not humble
  and at the same time mystically glorious, as the mother of the Christ-child;
  there was nothing incomprehensible, nothing miraculous, only a noble
  simplicity and yet royal loftiness in her unconscious dignity and innocence.
  There floated, as it were, a sweet-sounding music round the figure of this
  Hebe, every movement being in perfect harmony; wife and yet maiden; entirely
  human, perfectly at rest and contented in the love of her young husband and
  of the child at her breast. Lovely, touching, and dignified at the same time,
  in all the perfect beauty of her figure, her face and her complexion so
  modest, that in her presence, as before a beautiful statue, every wish was
  silent.</p>

  <p>She wore no ornament; her light-brown hair, shining with a golden lustre
  when the sun kissed it, flowed back in natural waves from the open,
  well-formed temples, leaving the rather low forehead free, and was fastened
  at her neck in a loose knot. A milk-white robe of the finest wool, fastened
  on the left shoulder with a beautifully shaped, but simple silver brooch,
  hung in folds down to her ankles, showing the pretty red leather sandals;
  leaving bare the neck and arms, which were still childlike, but rather too
  long. The robe was fastened at the waist with a wide bronze girdle.</p>

  <p>Thus she moved silently down the steps, and approached her husband. The
  long narrow face had that wonderful, almost bluish-white, complexion only
  possessed by the daughters of Ionia, and which no noon-tide sun of the south
  can embrown; the eye-brows, in a half-circle, regular as if drawn with
  compasses, might have given to the countenance a lifeless, statuesque
  appearance, but under the long, slightly curved, black eye-lashes, the
  dark-brown gazelle-like eyes, now directed towards her beloved, shone with a
  life full of feeling.</p>

  <p>He flew towards her with an elastic step, lifted carefully, tenderly, the
  sleeping child from her arm, and taking the flat straw lid from his
  tool-basket, he placed the child on it, under the shade of a rose-bush. The
  evening breeze threw the scented leaves of a full-blown rose on the little
  one: he smiled in his sleep.</p>

  <p>Then the master, winding his arm round the waist of his young wife, led
  her to the just completed entrance-slab, and said:</p>

  <p>"Now is the proverb ready, which I have kept hidden from thee till I could
  finish it; now read, and know, and feel"&mdash;and he kissed her tenderly on
  the mouth: "Thou&mdash;thou thyself art the happiness; <i>Thou</i> dwellest
  here."</p>

  <p>The young wife held her hand before her eyes to protect them from the sun,
  which now shone in almost horizontal beams through the open gateway; she read
  and blushed, the colour rose perceptibly in her delicate white cheeks, her
  bosom heaved, her heart beat quickly: "O Fulvius! thou art good. How thou
  dost love me! How happy we are!" And she laid her two hands and arms on his
  right shoulder, on the other her beautiful head.</p>

  <p>He heartily pressed her to himself. "Yes, overflowing, without shadow is
  our happiness&mdash;without measure or end."</p>

  <p>Quickly, with a slight trembling, as if shivering, she raised herself, and
  looked him anxiously in the face: "O, do not provoke the holy ones. It is
  whispered," said she, herself whispering, "they are envious." And she held
  her hand before his mouth.</p>

  <p>But he pressed a loud kiss upon the small fingers, and cried: "I am not
  jealous, I, a <i>man</i>&mdash;why should the holy ones be envious? I do not
  believe that. I do not believe it of the holy ones&mdash;nor of the heathen
  gods, if indeed they still have life and power."</p>

  <p>"Speak not of them! They certainly live!&mdash;but they are bad spirits,
  and he who names them, he calls them near; thus warns the Presbyter of the
  Basilica."</p>

  <p>"I fear them not. They have protected our ancestors for many
  generations."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but we have turned away from them! They defend us no longer. Only
  the saints are our defenders against the barbarians. Alas! if they came here,
  trampled down the flowers in the garden, and carried away our child."</p>

  <p>And she knelt down and kissed the little sleeper.</p>

  <p>But the young father laughed. "The Germans, dost thou mean? they steal no
  children! They have more than they can feed. But it is true&mdash;&mdash;they
  may perhaps one day sound out their war-cry before the gates of Juvavum."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that they may, very soon!" broke in an anxious voice, and the fat
  Crispus, breathing heavily after his hot walk, entered the garden.</p>

  <p>"Ave, Phidias in plaster," cried Fulvius to him.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, uncle," said Felicitas, giving him her hand.</p>

  <p>The broad-brimmed felt hat which he had drawn over his brow to protect his
  red, fat, shining, good-humoured face, and his stump nose, from the sun,
  Crispus threw on his neck, so that it hung by the leather strap on his broad
  back. "May Hygeia never leave thee, my daughter; the Graces never forsake
  thee, their fourth sister. Yes, the Germans! A horseman came last night with
  secret information for the Tribune. But two hours after we knew it all, we,
  early guests at the Baths of Amphitrite. The rider is a Wascon; no Wascon
  keeps his mouth closed if you pour wine therein. A battle has been fought at
  the ford of the Isar: our troops have fled, the watch-tower of Vada is burnt.
  The barbarians have crossed the river."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" laughed Fulvius, "that is yet far away. Go, darling, prepare a
  cooling drink for our uncle&mdash;thou knowest what he likes: not too much
  water! And <i>if</i> they come, they will not eat us. They are fierce giants
  in battle&mdash;children after the victory. Have I not lived months among
  them as their prisoner? I fear nothing from them."</p>

  <p>"Nothing for thyself&mdash;but for this sweet wife?"</p>

  <p>Felicitas did not hear this question; she had taken up the child and gone
  with it into the house.</p>

  <p>Fulvius shook his curly locks. "No! They would do nothing to her, that is
  not their custom. Certainly, did I fall, she would not be long left a widow.
  But there are people not in the bearskins of the barbarians, who would
  willingly tear her from the arms of her husband."</p>

  <p>And he seized angrily the hammer in his belt.</p>

  <p>"She must not suspect anything of it, the pure heart!" continued he.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. But thou must be on the watch. I met the Tribune lately in
  the office of the old money-lender."</p>

  <p>"The usurer! the blood-sucker!"</p>

  <p>"I was able, fortunately, to pay him my little debt. The slave announced
  me. I waited behind the curtain: I then heard a deep voice mention thy
  name&mdash;and Felicitas. I entered. The Tribune stood with the money-dealer.
  They were quickly silent when they perceived me. And just now, on the way
  here, whom should I overtake on the highway? Leo the Tribune, and Zeno the
  money-dealer! The latter pointed with his staff to thy house, the flat roof
  of which, with its little statues, projected above the trees. I guessed their
  conversation, and the object of their journey. Unseen I sprang from the road
  into the ditch, and hastened by the shorter way, the steep meadow path, to
  warn thee. Take care&mdash;they will soon be here."</p>

  <p>"Let him only come, the miser! I have earned and carefully put away the
  sum that I owe him for marble supplied from Aquileia, and for the town taxes.
  My other creditors I have asked to wait, or rather promised them higher
  interest, and have put all the money together for this destroyer. But what
  does the Tribune want with me? I owe him nothing, except a knife-thrust for
  the look with which he devoured my precious one."</p>

  <p>"Be careful! <i>His</i> knife is more powerful: it is the sword; and
  behind him stand the wild Mauritanian cavalry, and the Isaurian hirelings,
  whom we must pay with precious gold to protect us from the barbarians."</p>

  <p>"But who defends us from the defenders? The Emperor in distant Ravenna? He
  rejoices if the Germans do not cross the Alps; he troubles himself no more
  about this land, which has been so long Roman."</p>

  <p>"Except in extortionate taxes, to squeeze out our last blood-drops."</p>

  <p>"Bah! The State taxes! It is many years since they were collected. No
  Imperial functionary ventures now over the mountains. I stand indeed here on
  Imperial soil. But what is the name of the man who is now Emperor, and to
  whom this bit of land belongs, of which he has never heard? Every two years
  another Emperor is made known to us&mdash;but only through the coinage."</p>

  <p>"And that becomes ever worse."</p>

  <p>"It <i>cannot</i> get worse; that is a comfort."</p>

  <p>"A friend tells me that the taxes get more and more intolerable in
  Mediolanum, where there are still bailiffs and soldiers to levy them by
  force."</p>

  <p>"And it may be the same with us," laughed the young man. "Who knows how
  much I am already in debt for these two acres of land?"</p>

  <p>"And the roads of the Legions are overgrown with grass and brushwood."</p>

  <p>"And the troops receive no wages."</p>

  <p>"But they pay themselves by plundering the burghers, whom they should
  defend."</p>

  <p>"And the walls of Juvavum are falling, the moats are dry, the sluices
  destroyed; the rich people go away, there only remain poor wretches like
  ourselves, who cannot leave."</p>

  <p>"I wonder that the money-lender has not long ago moved with his great
  gold-bag over the Alps."</p>

  <p>"I would not go, uncle, if I could; and why, indeed, could I not? My art,
  my trade will be honoured everywhere, so long as the Romans dwell in stone,
  not wooden houses, like the Germans. But I am firmly fixed to this soil.
  Many, many generations have my fathers dwelt here; they say since the
  founding of the colony by the Emperor Hadrian. They have cleared the forests,
  drained the marshes, made roads, raised fords, laid out house and garden,
  grafted the rich fruits on the wild apple and pear-trees; the climate itself
  has become milder. I know Italy, I have bought marble in Venetia, but I would
  rather live here on the old inheritance of my fathers."</p>

  <p>"But if the barbarians come, wilt thou then also?"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Stay! I have my own thoughts about that. For us unimportant people it is
  better under the barbarians than"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Say not, than under the Emperor. Thou art a Roman!"</p>

  <p>The stout Crispus said this very gravely, but the other laughed; the good
  uncle but little resembled a Roman hero. His neighbours declared that he
  modelled his statues of Bacchus from his own figure.</p>

  <p>"Half-blood! My mother was a Noric Celt. Induciomara! That does not sound
  much of the Quirinal."</p>

  <p>"And we do not stand under the Emperor, but under his hangman servants,
  Exchequer officials, and under the murderous fist of the Moorish and Isaurian
  troops. If I must serve barbarians, I prefer the Germans."</p>

  <p>"But they are heathen."</p>

  <p>"In part. A hundred and fifty years ago so were we all. My grandfather
  sacrificed secretly to Jupiter. And there are also Christians among
  them."</p>

  <p>"Arians! heretics! worse than heathen, says the Holy Church."</p>

  <p>"A few decades past our emperors were also heretics. And the Germans ask
  no one what he believes; but how heavily did our fathers suffer, if their
  faith did not exactly agree with that of the ruling emperor!"</p>

  <p>"You take too lenient a view of the coming of the barbarians. They have
  set fire to many towns."</p>

  <p>"Yes; but stone does not burn. The Romans quickly fit new timbers in the
  undestroyed walls. Then no German settles in a town. They pasture their herds
  on the land; it is the peasant in his farm who suffers from them. They take
  from him a third of his fields and pasturage. But the land profits thereby.
  It is now sadly dispeopled; nowhere is there a free peasant on a free soil.
  For the masters, whom they never see, who carouse in Naples or Byzantium,
  <i>slaves</i> cultivate the ground, or rather they do <i>not</i> cultivate
  it, they only work enough to keep them from starving. If they gained more the
  slave-master would take it from them. But it is different with plough and
  sickle, when hundreds of Germans press into the country, each with
  innumerable white-headed children. For so many children as <i>these</i>
  people have, I could not have imagined over the whole earth!&mdash;And in a
  few years the grown-up son builds his own wooden house in the cleared forest
  or the drained swamp. They swarm over the furrows like ants, and they soon
  throw away their old wooden plough-shares and copy the iron shares of the
  colonists, and in a few years the land bears so much more than formerly, that
  it richly feeds both conquerors and conquered."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," nodded Crispus, "we have seen all that in the frontier lands,
  where they have settled. If the sons become too numerous they cast lots, and
  the third part, that draws the lot to migrate, wanders on wherever hawk or
  wolf directs; but never back, never towards the north!" sighed Crispus, "so
  they press ever nearer to us."&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"But they leave us our laws, our language, our God, our Basilica, and
  demand much, much less in tribute than the slave-master of the landlord or
  the tax-gatherer of the Emperor."</p>

  <p>"It is well that Severus does not hear you, the old <i>armaturarum
  magister</i> in Juvavum; he would"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Yes, he thinks we have yet the old times, and there are still living the
  old Romans as in the days of that tamer of the Germans, the Emperor Probus,
  of whose race he counts himself. But by the saints he is mistaken. Why should
  I be over zealous for the Emperor? He, this Emperor, certainly shows no zeal
  for me; in strong Ravenna he sits and invents new taxes, and new punishments
  for those who pay no taxes, because they have nothing."</p>

  <p>"The old Severus has long been drilling volunteers to lead against the
  barbarians, in case they should roam this way. I have been there a few days,
  painfully carrying spear and shield in this heat. I have never seen thee, so
  much younger and stronger, on our '<i>Campus Martius</i>,' as they call
  it."</p>

  <p>Fulvius laughed. "I have no need, uncle; I have learnt to use arms long
  enough while a prisoner with the Germans, and if the town and one's own
  hearth must be defended I shall not be wanting&mdash;for honour's sake! not
  that I think we shall do much; for, believe me, if they seriously intend to
  come, that is, if they <i>must</i> because they <i>need</i> our acres, then
  Severus will not keep them back with his old-fashioned generalship and his
  new-fashioned 'Legions of the Capitol of Juvavum,' under the golden eagle
  which he has presented to them. Nor the Tribune either with his cavalry from
  Africa and his mercenaries from Isauria. But look! Philemon, the slave, is
  beckoning; I see the drinking-cup shining on the seat in the little
  porch&mdash;the table is ready. Now drink of our rough Räter-wine; Augustus
  long ago knew how to value it, and it has been already a year in the cellar
  since the pack-mule brought it here from the Tyrol. Let us look at Felicitas
  and the child at her breast, and forget emperors and barbarians."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile, slowly walking up the high-road, the two men whom
  Crispus had announced were approaching the villa; they often stood still,
  interrupting their progress with an animated conversation.</p>

  <p>"No, no," warned the money-dealer, shaking his bald head, which, in spite
  of the sun, was uncovered, and striking with his staff on the hard road,
  "such haste, such violence, such impetuosity, as thy passionate longing
  craves, will not answer, O friend Tribune. Only leave me alone! We are on the
  right, the safe way."</p>

  <p>"Thy way is a crooked, weary, roundabout way, a snail-pace," cried the
  soldier impatiently, and he threw back his proud head so that the black plume
  of his helmet rustled on the links of his armour. "To what purpose are these
  ceremonies? They do not hasten the time when you shall add the little
  property to your vast possessions. And I&mdash;I cannot sleep since the sight
  of this young woman has inflamed my passions. My heart beats to breaking. All
  night I toss on my hot couch. By the ungirdled Astarte of Tripolis! I
  <i>will</i> have this slender Felicitas! And I <i>must</i> have her, or my
  veins will burst." And his fiery black eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt have her, only patience."</p>

  <p>"No! no patience. A sword-thrust will make the milk-sop of a husband cold;
  in these arms will I lift the struggling one on Pluto, my black horse, and
  quick to the Capitol, even if all the market-women of Juvavum raise an outcry
  behind me."</p>

  <p>"Murder and rape! Thou knowest the punishment."</p>

  <p>"Bah! Would an accuser come forward? And the Emperor? The Emperor of
  <i>Juvavum</i>&mdash;is myself. Let us see who will climb the walls of my
  Capitolium."</p>

  <p>"The Cross, my roaring Leo, the Cross and the Presbyter. No, no, it must
  not be an open sin crying to heaven. True, the Judge and his lictors are weak
  in this land, which is almost given up by Rome. But the Church is so much the
  stronger. If the haggard, white-bearded Johannes thrust thee out, thou art a
  lost man. No pound of meat, no cup of wine, will the people of Juvavum again
  sell to thee."</p>

  <p>"I will take what I need with my lancers."</p>

  <p>"But thy lancers are Mauritanians: pious Christians, baptised by the
  Presbyter. See if they will follow, if the old man have cursed thee."</p>

  <p>"I will strike him dead after, or rather, before the curse," cried the
  officer, and he made a quick step forwards; his long dark-red mantle floated
  in the wind.</p>

  <p>But the money-changer again stopped, adjusting with his bony fingers his
  yellow tunic.</p>

  <p>"How useless! Dost thou not know that <i>they</i> are immortal? If thou
  strikest <i>one</i> dead, the Bishop sends another. And they are all
  alike&mdash;much more than thy soldiers resemble each other. And I&mdash;I
  would not look at thee across the street if thou wert thrust out from the
  Holy Church."</p>

  <p>But now the soldier stopped and laughed aloud: "Thou! Zeno of Byzantium!
  Thou believest as little in the Holy Church as Leo himself. And it is my
  opinion, that thy soul-destroying usury is not regarded more favourably by
  the saints, than my trifle of pleasure in love and murder. What hast thou to
  do with the Church?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell thee, thou rash son of Mars. I <i>fear</i> her! She is the
  only power now left in these lands. The Emperor is far away, his officers are
  all venal; the barbarians are like the storm, they bluster around us, we bend
  to them, and they again bluster away; but the Church is everywhere, even if
  only a single priest says mass in a half-ruined house of prayer. And the
  priest is not to be bought. The miserable creature dares not live like a man,
  so he needs nothing; and all who hope for heaven follow him, that is to say:
  all fools. But woe to the man who has the fools against him&mdash;he is lost.
  No, no! we must not rouse the Church against us."</p>

  <p>"I need him yet, the sneak!" grated Leo through his teeth, with an angry
  look at his companion; and he impatiently pushed aside his short, broad sword
  in the finely-worked scabbard.</p>

  <p>"For that reason truly, I have to serve you," continued the merchant.</p>

  <p>"For a good reward," interrupted Leo scornfully.</p>

  <p>"But which, alas! I have yet only received in half."</p>

  <p>"The other half when I have the gazelle-eyed beauty in my chamber."</p>

  <p>"For that reason I have taken all this trouble, woven all these meshes,
  and gathered them in my hand; one jerk, and the net closes over the head of
  the stone-mason; he and the sweet nymph struggle therein, defenceless,
  powerless, and best of all, without a right. Emperor and Church can look on
  whilst thou seizest the bird, and I the land. Not that it is valuable; but it
  rounds off my fields here. I can then more easily sell the whole to a great
  lord in Italy."</p>

  <p>"I also do not intend to keep the fragile creature long; only through the
  autumn and winter. When the slave-dealers come here in summer from Antioch, I
  shall sell her at a high price. This half-bluish white of the eyes is much
  sought for. Whence has she it?"</p>

  <p>"From Hellas or Ionia. Her parents were slaves of a Greek trader in
  purple, who died here on the return journey from Pannonia. They declare that
  the old man set them free before his death; they then carried on a little
  trade in salt. When they also died, the child became the wife of their
  neighbour's son, the stone-mason, who had grown up with her. I am eager to
  know if they have preserved the letter of emancipation. If not, then
  good-night, Felicitas! We are now at our goal; the foot-path here turns down,
  from the main road towards the Mercurius Hill. Moderate, I beseech thee, the
  violence and the eagerness in thine eyes, or thou wilt spoil all."</p>

  <p>"I have not been born or trained to wait."</p>

  <p>Thereupon the Tribune approached the open entrance of the garden. Zeno
  followed slowly. The setting sun threw its beams fully on the threshold-stone
  and the newly-cut inscription.</p>

  <p>"Hic habitat Felicitas!" read the Tribune. "For yet how long?" asked he,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>"Nihil mali intret!" concluded the merchant. "It is well that wishes are
  not bolts."</p>

  <p>"Or <i>we</i> should not come in!" said the other; and he trod scornfully
  with a quick step on the neat letters. These were rubbed smooth as a mirror
  with fresh oil. Leo's foot slipped, he staggered, tried to recover himself,
  stumbled again, and fell with a cry of pain on the stone slab, helmet and
  armour loudly rattling.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

  <p class="first">Immediately, before his companion could stretch forth a hand
  to help him, the enraged man had tried to rise, but with a wild curse he sank
  again to the ground, and repelled vehemently the attempt of the other to
  assist him.</p>

  <p>"Let me lie; the foot is broken or the ankle is sprained. No, it is the
  knee. I do not know. But I cannot stand&mdash;I must be carried."</p>

  <p>"I will call the people of the house. The stone-mason is coming
  already."</p>

  <p>"I will strike him dead if he touches me. I will have no help from him. On
  the other side of the road to the left I saw some of my people spear-throwing
  on the drill-ground. Call them to me, they shall carry me away."</p>

  <p>And this was done.</p>

  <p>While the money-changer had gone for the soldiers Fulvius came forward,
  but the Tribune turned away from him and would not speak; silent, suppressing
  any utterance of pain, he was carried by the strong Moors into the town,
  where they soon obtained a litter and took him to the Capitol.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile Fulvius had stopped the merchant at the entrance. "Not
  over the threshold, most excellent man!" said he, pushing him back. "I am
  superstitious; thou hast an evil look. As soon as I caught sight of thee and
  the Tribune I hastened to meet you, bringing the money which lies in that bag
  ready counted for thee. Here"&mdash;&mdash;and he began to count out the
  silver money on the broad coping of the low wall. "Here, count then! It is
  reckoned correctly: fifty solidi principal, and at thirty per cent, interest,
  fifteen solidi more. And here&mdash;for I cannot transact business with thee
  without a receipt&mdash;on this wax tablet I have written the acquittance.
  Take the style, put thy name to it, and go thy way, never to return."</p>

  <p>But with his lean hand Zeno pushed back disdainfully the silver pieces, so
  that they fell rattling on the stone slab and rolled round about.</p>

  <p>"We do not separate so quickly, hospitable landlord and grateful
  debtor."</p>

  <p>"Grateful! Thirty per cent, is, I think, thanks enough, and one is not
  hospitable to harpies and vampires. Take what belongs to thee and go!"</p>

  <p>"When I have taken that which belongs to me," answered the Byzantiner
  fiercely, "then, not I, but <i>thou</i>, wilt go out of this house&mdash;out
  of this whole property."</p>

  <p>"What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"That means, that my business is not merely with the fifty miserable
  solidi with interest. Thou art my debtor for more than twenty times that sum;
  mine is the house, mine the whole possession, most probably thyself also, at
  this moment, with every bone in thy body; mine also that slave daughter, who
  peeps anxiously there between the curtains, with the child at her breast.
  Mother-sheep and lamb are my own."</p>

  <p>So maliciously were these words uttered, at first lightly whispered, then
  in rising anger, ever louder and more threatening, that Fulvius, alarmed,
  looked back to see if his young wife had perceived this disaster.</p>

  <p>But Felicitas had again disappeared behind the curtain, satisfied that the
  wild officer, whom she feared, she knew not why, was no longer there. She
  knew well that the money was ready for the usurer.</p>

  <p>Smiling, she bade farewell to her guest, who had emptied his beaker and
  now took his departure. Not a cloud overshadowed her white brow as she now
  sat down on the couch, and with a sweet smile on her maiden-like countenance
  raised the waking child, and proceeded to give it nourishment.</p>

  <p>Zeno still delaying, Fulvius in fear and anger pushed him with his elbow a
  step farther from the entrance; the muscles of his naked arms tightened, his
  hands clenched; threatening but speechless, he stood before the man who had
  spoken such fearful words.</p>

  <p>Crispus now came forward; he seized his young nephew firmly by the wrist
  of his right arm, which he was slowly raising for a blow.</p>

  <p>"What means this?" cried the fat uncle, anxiously.</p>

  <p>Fulvius spoke not a word.</p>

  <p>But Zeno answered: "This means, that I have bought this property from the
  Imperial Exchequer, with all the old claims for State taxes, and seven times
  the rent due to the Emperor, for which, according to the accounts, this
  tenant and his father are many decades in arrear; this makes, together with
  the fines, a debt of seven thousand solidi."</p>

  <p>Crispus calculated in an instant that if even he gave his whole
  possessions to save his nephew, they would not amount to a seventh part of
  this sum.</p>

  <p>"That means," continued Zeno, "that as there is no doubt about the
  inability of the debtor to pay, I claim him as my slave for debt, and shall
  to-morrow be installed by the magistrate into the property."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Felicitas!" groaned Fulvius.</p>

  <p>"Be calm; I will take mother and child home with me till the suit is
  decided," comforted the good-natured uncle.</p>

  <p>"Law-suit?" laughed Zeno. "A suit that begins with its accomplishment is
  quickly decided. My claim is indubitably shown by the Imperial tax-rolls;
  they give positive evidence, and that young creature"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou also claim the wife for the debt of her husband? That is not
  Roman justice," cried Crispus.</p>

  <p>"Stay with thy ridiculous statues, and do not teach me justice and its
  ways. The young wife is a slave-child, the property of the master of her
  parents. This man died without a will, without assignable heirs. His property
  fell to the Exchequer; to the Exchequer belonged the parents and belongs the
  child."</p>

  <p>"The old Krates set the parents and the child free before his death."</p>

  <p>"Where is the letter of emancipation?"</p>

  <p>And when both were silent the usurer continued in a triumphant tone: "You
  are silent? It is, then, as I suspected: the papyrus was destroyed when her
  parents' house was burnt in the rising of the people against the
  tax-collectors. Her birth as a slave is undisputed, the letter of
  emancipation is not forthcoming, therefore she and her slave-brood are
  mine."</p>

  <p>The young husband was overcome with passion and anguish, and a blow with
  his fist on the breast of the villain sent him staggering backwards. "Hast
  thou, then, thou old sinner, purchased my wife in advance from the Fiscus, as
  thou hast also me and my house?"</p>

  <p>"No," said he, exasperated, "the beautiful Greek belongs to a handsome
  young lord, who suits her better. A lion will soon drag her to his den. Thou
  knowest well what kind of suitor the lion is."</p>

  <p>"The Tribune!" cried Fulvius. "I will strangle him first with these fists;
  and thou, panderer, take"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>But Crispus slung both arms around him, holding him fast.</p>

  <p>So Zeno gained time to make his escape. He quickly mounted the path which
  led to the main road; when he had gained the height he turned and looked
  through the bushes at the villa. He raised his fist menacingly, and cried to
  the two men, "Woe to the vanquished!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

  <p class="first">Crispus then turned to go towards the house.</p>

  <p>"What dost thou wish to do?? asked Fulvius.</p>

  <p>"To ask Felicitas if there is no writing, no evidence of
  emancipation"&mdash;&mdash;but the young husband stopped him.</p>

  <p>"No, no! She must know nothing about it. The poor, tender, helpless, happy
  child! It would crush her&mdash;this horrid plot!"</p>

  <p>"How wilt thou prevent her knowing it, when it will to-morrow be carried
  out? For I do not doubt it is all correct what the usurer says of the
  tax-dues and of his purchase of the property. And that is not the worst. Thou
  canst fly, as so many thousand debtors have already, to the mountains, to the
  forests, to the barbarians, for aught I care. Leave him here the heap of
  stones."</p>

  <p>"The house of my parents! the place where we have been so happy!"</p>

  <p>"You can be happy elsewhere, when you come together again. But Felicitas
  with the infant&mdash;she cannot yet share thy flight. She must stay, and
  <i>can</i> stay with me. And that, I hope, can be arranged; for I have no
  doubt about the emancipation. The old people did not fabricate it. It is only
  the evidence that we want&mdash;the evidence!"</p>

  <p>"The letter of emancipation is burnt; that is certain; burnt with the few
  ornaments and savings of the parents. They often told us about it. They had
  put all their valuables in a little box of cedar-wood, under the cushions of
  the bed, in their own room. In the night that the despairing tax-debtors and
  the peasants, the beasts of burden of the great landlords, had broken out in
  riot, the old people had, with the child, hastened into the street to inquire
  the cause of the fearful noise. They ran forward to the corner of the Vulcan
  market. Another crowd of fighting peasants and soldiers then poured in from
  behind, cutting off their return. The wooden storehouses of the small
  tradesmen that lived there, were set on fire. It was two days before they
  could return to their house, and then it was almost entirely burnt out; under
  the half-carbonised cushions of the bed, they found two melted gold pieces
  and the iron mounting of the cedar-box, yet glowing, and round about
  ashes:&mdash;from the wood of the box and its contents."</p>

  <p>"The writing was not to be found?"</p>

  <p>"In the house of her parents, certainly not; we searched it thoroughly
  before we sold it, after the death of the old people."</p>

  <p>"Among the records of the Curies?"</p>

  <p>"The freedom was given by letter, not by will. Krates intended to leave a
  will, but was overtaken by death before he had carried out his
  intention."</p>

  <p>"Witnesses?"</p>

  <p>"There were none. I tell you the freedom was given by letter."</p>

  <p>"There is, then, no evidence. It is fearful."</p>

  <p>"It makes one despair."</p>

  <p>"But what thoughtlessness to live long years without"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Long years? It is not yet one year that I have called her mine. Before
  that it was the care of the parents; but these good old
  people&mdash;strangers here&mdash;what could they do? They could not awake
  the dead master, that he might repeat the emancipation."</p>

  <p>"Had no one else read the letter?"</p>

  <p>"Possibly! But these could only witness that they had read it, not that it
  was genuine."</p>

  <p>"I see no escape but in flight&mdash;hasty flight."</p>

  <p>"Hasty flight with the infant, and the young mother hardly convalescent,
  is impossible. And to fly! it is not my custom. Rather resistance by
  force."</p>

  <p>"Thou, and I, and the lame Philemon, the force against the lancers of the
  Tribune! For he stands behind."</p>

  <p>"I believe it! I saw his passionate look rest on her&mdash;on her
  neck&mdash;I could throttle him!"</p>

  <p>"You are a dead man before you raise a hand against him."</p>

  <p>"It is dark, hopeless night around us. Oh, where shall we find counsel,
  where a beam of hope, of light?"</p>

  <p>"In the Church," spoke softly, but decidedly, a sweet voice. Felicitas put
  her arm round the neck of her beloved.</p>

  <p>"Thou!"</p>

  <p>"Thou here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, as thou didst not come back, I sought for thee; it is always so
  between us. The boy sleeps; I laid him in my bed. I found you both so deep in
  conversation, that you did not hear my step on the soft garden sand."</p>

  <p>"What hast thou heard?" cried Fulvius, full of fear.</p>

  <p>But the radiant, cheerful face, the smooth brow, the happy smile of his
  young wife, soon quieted his anxiety.</p>

  <p>"I only heard that you wanted light in the darkness, and there came into
  my mind, as always, the word 'Church,' the name 'Johannes.'"</p>

  <p>Fulvius was satisfied, almost joyful, because she had heard nothing of the
  lurking misfortune. He stroked tenderly her beautifully arched head, and
  said:</p>

  <p>"And yet thou art not one of those devotees whose piety, or rather
  hypocrisy, peeps through the knees of their garments, worn threadbare by the
  altar steps."</p>

  <p>"No; I am, alas, not pious enough. But it does not help me if I do go
  often to confession. Johannes always smiles when I have finished, and says:
  'Thou hast only <i>one</i> sin; that is, Falvius.' But when I hear of
  darkness and light, I always think of the Church and Johannes. It is an
  experience of my earliest childhood," said she slowly, reflectively.</p>

  <p>"What experience?" asked Crispus, becoming attentive.</p>

  <p>"I had been obliged for many weeks, on account of a disease in the eyes,
  to wear a bandage, to remain in darkness, I know not how long. I was hardly
  six years old. I then heard the voice of Krates, the master, who was skilful
  in medicine, and had himself treated me. 'Take her with you this evening into
  the Basilica,' said he, 'it will not hurt her eyes; and she must be there, so
  says the law.'"</p>

  <p>"What sayest thou? For what purpose?" asked the two men in breathless
  eagerness.</p>

  <p>"I know not. You forget I was a child. But this stands yet clear before
  me: In the evening father and mother took me between them, each holding one
  of my hands; the master was also there; and they led me with bandaged
  eyes&mdash;for the raw evening air of the late autumn might have hurt
  them&mdash;into the Basilica. Here they took off the bandage
  and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And now?"</p>

  <p>"What didst thou see? What happened?"</p>

  <p>"For the first time for months without pain, did my eyes again see the
  bright but gentle light. Before the altar, which was lighted with many wax
  candles, stood Johannes in shining white garments; the master placed us all
  three at the lowest step of the altar, and then spoke a number of words that
  I did not understand: the priest blessed us; my parents wept&mdash;but I
  noticed it was from emotion, not from pain&mdash;and kissed their master's
  knees; they then again put the bandage on my eyes, and we went from the light
  of the church out into the darkness. Since then light and Church and Johannes
  are to me one."</p>

  <p>Felicitas could not quite understand what now happened to her.</p>

  <p>Her husband warmly kissed her brow and eyes, and her uncle almost crushed
  her hand.</p>

  <p>"Go thou back to the house," cried at last her husband. "We must go
  immediately to the church; thou art right&mdash;as always. Thou&mdash;thou
  hast given to us the best, the saving counsel."</p>

  <p>And he led her eagerly, with a last kiss, back into the garden.</p>

  <p>"It is quite certain," said Crispus, when Fulvius again appeared, "that it
  was not only by letter that they were set free; for greater safety there was
  the ceremony in the church, before the priest, according to all the forms of
  the law. And the child has all unsuspiciously revealed it to us in our
  greatest need!"</p>

  <p>"And the priest"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Was Johannes himself!"</p>

  <p>"He yet lives. Thanks be to the holy ones! He can testify to it."</p>

  <p>"And he shall: before this night! Before witnesses, before the Curies
  shall he verify it! To the church!"</p>

  <p>"To Johannes!"</p>

  <p>And the two men hastened as fast as feet could carry them, down the
  high-road to the town, towards the Porta Vindelica.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile Felicitas went slowly back to the house, often stopping
  to look back at her husband until he had disappeared from view.</p>

  <p>"What may they be doing?" said she quietly, bending her beautiful head.
  "Well, they are good: the holy ones are with them. The sun is now set behind
  Vindelicia. But in the forest the sweet bird still sings his evening song:
  how peaceful! how quiet! I will go to the bed of my little one. I can wait
  there most calmly; Fulvius will come back before night. For he loves
  us&mdash;yes, he loves us much, my little son!"</p>

  <p>She then entered the house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

  <p class="first">But Fulvius did not come back that night.</p>

  <p>When he and Crispus had passed through the Porta Vindelica, and had turned
  into the Via Augustana, in which stood the church of Saint Peter and the
  little house of the priest, they noticed Zeno, who was knocking at the door
  of a magnificent building at the other end of the street. It was the house of
  the Judge.</p>

  <p>"He is using despatch," said Crispus. "It is well that we are already
  here." And he touched the knocker, which in shape like a cross hung on the
  small door of the priest's house.</p>

  <p>"He will manage all through the Judge, who is his son-in-law," said
  Fulvius, anxiously.</p>

  <p>"And deeply indebted to the usurer. That holds everything together, like
  sticky mud."</p>

  <p>The door was opened, and a slave led them through a long, narrow passage,
  dimly lighted by an oil lamp in a little niche in the wall, to the room of
  the priest; drew back the curtain, and ushered in the two guests.</p>

  <p>The half-dark room was almost void of furniture: the lid of a large chest
  served as a table, on it stood writing materials; on the walls one saw a
  lamb, a fish, a dove, very roughly sketched and painted a red colour.</p>

  <p>Johannes, although in conversation with two priests, immediately turned
  towards them; a meagre form, upright, in spite of his seventy years, by the
  force of a strong, enthusiastic will; a gray Capuchin dress, tied round the
  loins with a cord, was all his attire; a silver ring of white hair, which
  shone like a nimbus, encircled his head. A long white beard fell low on his
  breast.</p>

  <p>"A moment's patience, dear friends," said he. "The business of my brothers
  here is urgent; you see, they have the traveller's hat and staff&mdash;but it
  will soon be concluded. Thou, Timotheus, wilt return to-night to thy post. It
  is well that thou hast given the warning; but only the hireling forsakes his
  flock, the good shepherd remains constant to it."</p>

  <p>"I go," said the one addressed, a young subdeacon, blushing quite abashed:
  "I certainly did not wish to run away from the barbarians&mdash;I only
  wished"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"To give a warning, certainly. And then, perhaps, the spirit of cowardice
  suggested this to thee&mdash;that Johannes would keep thee here within the
  safe walls of this fortress. But I say to thee: 'Except the Lord keep the
  city, the watchman waketh but in vain.' And if the troubles of war come over
  the poor people out there, thy consolations will be needed. Go with God, my
  son, back to thy cell at Isunisca."</p>

  <p>"Are the barbarians already so near?" cried Crispus, alarmed.</p>

  <p>"Apparently; at least, brother Timotheus heard, three nights ago, horsemen
  ride by his cell with unshod steeds. Those were not Romans."</p>

  <p>"They were the night-riders, the gods of the heathen, led by Wotan, the
  devil chief, whom our fathers named Teutates, but the Romans Mercurius," said
  Bojorix, the deacon, an older man, and he trembled for fear.</p>

  <p>"Hardly," said Johannes, with a quiet smile, "for afterwards in clear day,
  one of these night-phantoms, with a long flowing gray beard, and clad in a
  wolf's skin, dashed into a company of armed merchants at the bridge across
  the Inn, seized the largest wine-skin from the waggon, threw it on his horse,
  and rode away. Spectres do not drink this year's Räter wine. This news from
  the <i>west</i> disturbs me less than the absence of news from the
  <i>east</i>&mdash;from Ovilava and Lentia! There certainly came from there,
  through the Porta Latina, a few peasants into the market; but I did not know
  them: I was suspicious of them. Well, we stand in the protection of the Lord,
  in the rising as in the setting of the sun! But thou,
  Stephen"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>But he who was addressed heard not.</p>

  <p>Gently rebuking him, the Presbyter took hold of his garment: "Stephen,
  Stephen, dost thou still understand only the barbarian name Bojorix? Thou, my
  Stephen, say to the children of the widow at Foutes: I will pledge the silver
  vessels of the church, keeping back only one for use, and with the proceeds
  satisfy the money-lender, and save her from slavery. I will bring the money
  to-morrow, or the day following."</p>

  <p>"O, sir, they are so anxious. Why not tonight?"</p>

  <p>"To-night I must bind afresh the wounds of the poor leprous Jew, whom the
  doctors will no more touch, and watch by him. Go now, both of you, my
  brethren: and may the Angel of the Lord who led Tobias hover around your
  traveller's staff. Fear not, although it is night: you walk in light."</p>

  <p>Reverently saluting, they departed; Johannes refused the kiss that they
  wished to press on his hand.</p>

  <p>"And now to you, my friends," said he; "what can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>With haste and excitement, each supplementing the other, they laid their
  anxieties before the priest; he listened gravely, attentively.</p>

  <p>"It is," said he then, "as my dear penitent has said. Krates, the master,
  set free the parents and the child: before me, in this Basilica."</p>

  <p>"Oh, then we are safe from that base man!" rejoiced Fulvius.</p>

  <p>"So long as I live: but I am an old man; this night the Lord may call me.
  Haste is necessary against this profligate. Yon knew Galla, the child of
  Gaudentius, who lives near to the tax-office. She was eighteen years old. It
  was only a few days ago. The villain saw her at mid-day:&mdash;before night
  she had disappeared:&mdash;next morning she lay shattered at the foot of the
  rock of the Capitol;&mdash;it was said she had met with an accident while
  gathering berries&mdash;but a fisherman, who was drawing his nets at
  daybreak, confided to me that he saw her throw herself from the
  tower-window."</p>

  <p>"The Tribune lives there!" cried Crispus.</p>

  <p>Fulvius, speechless, grasped at the hammer in his tunic.</p>

  <p>"Come! The Judge, the Curies will not take any declaration so late. They
  are feasting and carousing. We will seek out the elders of the congregation:
  I will swear before them my knowledge of the emancipation. And I will
  to-night consider with thee if we cannot protect thy wife's innocence, and
  also thyself and thy inheritance, brave stone-mason, against this usurer.
  Follow me."</p>

  <p>They hastened all three into the street. It was still tolerably light; the
  twilight of the long Jane evening only very gradually deepened. As they
  reached the house of the Judge, the outer door opened: the master came out
  escorting the money-dealer.</p>

  <p>"I will," said he, "send there early to-morrow. Thy right is undoubted;
  and as the flight of the debtor is probable, I will issue the
  warrant&mdash;but there he stands before us."</p>

  <p>Zeno turned towards the street and saw the three men approaching; it
  displeased him to see his victim in company with the priest, whom the
  burghers loved, whom he feared and hated. He greeted him coldly; there were
  other people in the street, it would have injured himself to refuse one so
  honoured a greeting, but he wished to pass by him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Halt, Zeno of Byzantium!" cried the priest aloud&mdash;and one would not
  have credited the old man with this strength of voice&mdash;"I have to warn
  thee, thee and that voluptuous Tribune. I know too well of your sins: the
  measure is full. If you do not repent, I cannot longer suffer you in the
  fellowship of the saints." The merchant grew pale. "A usurer thou art; and
  he&mdash;he is a murderer of body and soul. You will not carry it out. Know
  that, if the letter is burnt, the pure wife shall not be given up to you. She
  is free&mdash;set free before me in the church."</p>

  <p>"Thou canst easily say that," said Zeno, with a crafty look.</p>

  <p>"I go to swear it before witnesses."</p>

  <p>"Then no one knows it except the old man," thought the other.</p>

  <p>"But thou who takest thirty and more per cent., I will bring thee to
  account before the congregation. And not for that alone. Think of thy poor
  Syrian slave! I will also accuse thee, on her account, before the secular
  tribunal." The Byzantian trembled. "And thou and that commander-in-chief of
  lust and power, if you cannot clear yourselves from the blood of Galla, I
  will expel you next Sunday from the Church."</p>

  <p>Before Zeno could answer there was a clang of weapons and the sound of
  heavy steps, and a company of the Tribune's Isaurians turned the corner. The
  centurion hastened to the merchant:</p>

  <p>"I seek thee! I was directed from thy house here, to the Judge. Read! From
  the Tribune!"</p>

  <p>Zeno took the small wax tablet, "Open?" asked he suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Sealed for us," laughed the soldier; "we do not read; we only fight."</p>

  <p>Zeno read: "It was only the knee. My Greek slave has by friction reduced
  the swelling. I shall to-morrow again mount my horse. Threefold, if thou
  gettest the woman to-morrow!"</p>

  <p>The Greek exchanged a quick look with the Judge; he then, with the reverse
  end of the style, rubbed the tablet smooth, effacing the writing, turned the
  style and wrote:</p>

  <p>"The priest alone knows that she was set free. On Sunday he denounces thee
  publicly. Dead dogs do not bark."</p>

  <p>"Take that to thy Tribune," said he to the centurion.</p>

  <p>"I cannot. I go on guard at the Vindelician gate. But here, Arsakes, go
  back to the Capitol."</p>

  <p>He gave the tablet to one of the soldiers, who saluted and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"At the Vindelician gate? Wait, then!" And Zeno whispered a word to the
  Judge.</p>

  <p>"Halt, centurion!" cried the latter, "My Carcerarii are not within call;
  in case of necessity I can exercise authority over you warriors, according to
  the law of the Emperor Diocletian. Seize that debtor of the state, whose
  escape is suspected, and take him to the prison for tax-debtors; it stands by
  the Vindelician gate."</p>

  <p>Fulvius was in a moment surrounded; the centurion laid hold of his
  shoulder, four men seized his arms.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Felicitas!" sighed he, utterly helpless.</p>

  <p>"I will save her! I will go to her immediately!" cried Crispus, and he
  hastened away.</p>

  <p>He was about to turn the comer, when there sounded suddenly the
  hoof-strokes of a horseman riding along in mad haste, followed by a
  tumultuous crowd: soldiers, burghers, women, children&mdash;all
  pell-mell.</p>

  <p>"One of our Moorish horsemen!" cried the centurion, as he caught the
  horse's bridle. "Jarbas! Comrade in arms! What is the matter?"</p>

  <p>The rider, who was dripping with water, raised himself high in the saddle;
  he had lost helmet and shield, he held a broken spear in his right hand,
  blood streamed over his naked left arm.</p>

  <p>"Tell the Tribune," cried he in a hoarse voice, as if making a last
  effort. "I can do no more&mdash;the arrow in my neck&mdash;they are
  there&mdash;close the gates&mdash;the Germans stand before the town!" And
  dropping the bridle, he fell backwards from his horse.</p>

  <p>He was dead!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

  <p class="first">Was it actually so? Did the Germans stand indeed before the
  gates of Juvavum?</p>

  <p>The burghers racked their brains in tormenting uncertainty. They could
  learn nothing more at present of what had happened without the walls; the
  mouth that might have given farther information was silent for ever.</p>

  <p>The gates were kept carefully shut. When the news first reached the
  Capitol, Leo, the Tribune, had sprung from his couch, "To horse!" cried he;
  "out, before the walls!" But with a cry of pain he had sunk back in the arms
  of his slave; and he did not wish to entrust to another the dangerous
  enterprise of a nightly reconnaissance outside the gates, against an enemy
  certainly far superior in numbers. Severus, the commander of the volunteers
  in the town, had only infantry at his disposal. With these alone, he could
  not and would not advance against the barbarians in the night. He contented
  himself with occupying the towers and gates. The strengthened guard on the
  ramparts watched and listened attentively in the mild night air; but there
  was nothing unusual to be observed, no light in the neighbourhood, no
  camp-fires in the distance, which the advancing Germans, with wives and
  children, men-servants and maidens, with herds, carts and waggons, certainly
  could not dispense with, and which it was not their custom to extinguish
  either from prudence or fear. No noise was heard, neither the clang of arms,
  nor the hoof-strokes of horses; only the regular, gentle murmuring of the
  stream, which hastened through the valley from south to north, struck on the
  ears of the watchers. A burgher once thought he heard a noise in the
  direction of the river, like the gentle neighing of a horse, and a splash of
  the waves, as if a heavy body had fallen or sprung into the stream; but he
  convinced himself that he had been deceived, for everything remained still as
  before.</p>

  <p>The nightingales sang in the bushes around the villas; their undisturbed
  song testified, as one rightly judged, that neither waggons, horses, nor
  warriors were in movement there.</p>

  <p>So to gain information they turned again to the corpse of the horseman,
  and to his steed, yet trembling in every limb.</p>

  <p>They saw that the horse had swum the stream, man and horse were running
  with water. Why had not the fugitive made use of the bridge below the town?
  Because he did not know if it were occupied? or because he did not wish to do
  so? Because he had striven to bring his news the most direct road? He had no
  other wound than that in the neck, caused by the deadly arrow, from which the
  blood had flowed over his shoulder and shieldless left arm. It was
  undoubtedly a missile like those the Germans carried; the three-barbed point
  had entered very deeply, the shot was given at a close range; the long shaft
  of alder-wood was winged with the feathers of the gray heron; the blade of
  his long cavalry sword was missing, the leather sheath hung empty at the
  right side of his girth; the spear, which the closed right hand still
  grasped, was broken at the first iron clasp by which the point was attached,
  by a powerful blow from a battle-axe, not from a sword; so that the rider had
  lost in close combat, helmet, shield, sword, and spear, and in flight had
  received the arrow shot by his pursuer. The dead man could be questioned no
  more.</p>

  <p>But what had become of his comrades in arms?</p>

  <p>Leo, the Tribune, had the day before sent out five of the Moorish cavalry
  to take possession of a hill, two hours' journey north-west of the town,
  which commanded a view of the country as far as the thick forest to the
  north. A half-fallen watch-tower stood there, which had last been repaired
  and occupied in the time of the Emperor Valentinian I., now a hundred years
  ago.</p>

  <p>What had become of the other four Moors?</p>

  <p>Nobody knew.</p>

  <p>The citizens passed an anxious night. The watch went their rounds on the
  ramparts with torches, and small fires burnt at the spots where broad
  flagstones covered the surface of the earth and turf.</p>

  <p>The fires were extinguished at dawn of the early June morning; the
  sentinels looked carefully out into the country in the full morning light;
  there was nowhere a trace of the enemy.</p>

  <p>Peasants came as usual from all parts into the town to sell or to buy.
  They were astonished to find the gates closed. They were allowed to pass in
  singly, all being carefully examined to see if they were trustworthy people
  or spies, perhaps even barbarians in disguise.</p>

  <p>But the inoffensive peasants were terrified at this unusual sharpness of
  the gate-watch; to question them was without rhyme or reason. They evidently
  knew nothing, and were much more zealous and anxious to inquire in the town
  what had taken place.</p>

  <p>From the north-west, in the direction of Vindelicia, from which the
  approach of the barbarians was expected, the country people had come in, as
  usual, in numbers; they had observed nothing suspicious. But from the
  south-east hardly anyone came. It excited no remark, few villas and houses
  lay that way, and it was only seldom that a frequenter of the market came
  from thence. One might have considered the fright of the previous evening as
  a dream, only the dead horseman was a silent witness to its actuality.</p>

  <p>The first hours of the day passed away without any threatening
  indications; there was no enemy visible even in the far distance; the bridge
  over the Ivarus below the town (a second joined the two banks within the
  walls) was seen to be unoccupied.</p>

  <p>As the Tribune was still kept a prisoner in the Capitol by the accident to
  his knee, Severus ordered the Vindelician gate to be opened; he went with a
  company to the bridge, caused the end on the left, western bank to be
  barricaded with pieces of rock and timber, left there thirty spearmen and
  slingers, and then returned to the town quite satisfied that there was no
  trace of the enemy. But the old soldier did not relax his watchfulness; he
  ordered the gates to be kept closed and the towers garrisoned, and any
  occurrence was to be notified immediately to him in the Bath of Amphitrite,
  whither he now went, to wash away the cares of the night and the heat and
  dust of the march.</p>

  <p>After having fully enjoyed the bath, he sat comfortably on the soft
  woollen rug covering the marble seat, which formed a semicircle around the
  porphyry bath, rubbing now arms, and now legs, from the hip to the knee.</p>

  <p>This man of about fifty-five years was a model of healthy and vigorous
  strength; his limbs showed that the practice of the hunt and gymnastics had
  developed the power of his strongly-formed body.</p>

  <p>He now ceased his movements, and sank gradually into deep thought. His
  head fell deeper and deeper on his breast; at last he extended his right arm
  and began to draw figures in the clean white sand, which covered the space
  between the marble seat and the edge of the bath.</p>

  <p>"Must rank our men still deeper against the German wedge," murmured he to
  himself. "Ten men&mdash;twelve men deep. No, they don't waver yet. And
  yet&mdash;it must be just a question of arithmetic to defeat these Germans.
  It is only a problem of stroke and counter-stroke. Who may solve it? It would
  be best"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It would be best," broke in gently a melancholy voice, "that we lay in
  our last long sleep, where there is no longer either stroke or
  counterstroke."</p>

  <p>Severus turned; the white woollen curtain of the inner bath was moved
  aside; a handsome man in the strength of youth, and fully armed, stood behind
  it.</p>

  <p>"Thou, Cornelius! What meanest thou?"</p>

  <p>"Thou knowest my meaning. The best for man is not to have been born."</p>

  <p>"Shame on thee! thirty years old, and already so tired of life."</p>

  <p>"Shame on <i>thee</i>! Nearly sixty years, and still so foolishly fond of
  life."</p>

  <p>"What dost thou bring?"</p>

  <p>"Advice: evacuate the town, all the citizens to the Capitol. An express
  messenger over the Alps for help."</p>

  <p>"Thou seest spectres!"</p>

  <p>"Ah! If I saw only <i>them</i>! But I see the Germans!"</p>

  <p>"There is no trace of them far and wide."</p>

  <p>"It is exactly that which is mysterious. They must be near, quite near;
  and no one knows where they are."</p>

  <p>"<i>Why</i> must they be quite near?"</p>

  <p>"Because the gray heron does not go southwards in the month of June; and
  because he never flies so low."</p>

  <p>"What has that to say to it?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you. I was making the midnight round to relieve the guard at
  the Porta Latina. From the battlements of the tower I looked out sharply into
  the night. Nothing was to be seen, and nothing to be heard, except the song
  of the nightingale. Then suddenly I heard the cry of the gray heron."</p>

  <p>"They are not numerous here," said Severus; "but they do appear in the
  stagnant waters and in the marshes of the Ivarus."</p>

  <p>"Certainly; but the cry did not come from the river; it sounded on this
  side of the stream, out of the mountain forest."</p>

  <p>"Making an eyrie there, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"It was the <i>migratory call</i>. And they migrate in August. And after
  the first call there was a second, a third, a fourth answer, till the sounds
  died away in the distance."</p>

  <p>"The echo from the hills!"</p>

  <p>"That is conceivable. But the cry did not come from high in the air; it
  came from below, from the ground, up to me on the battlements of the tower.
  The heron does not fish at night."</p>

  <p>The old man smiled pleasantly. "Do, my Cornelius, believe the old
  huntsman. It fishes at night when it has a brood to feed. I have myself
  caught one in the morning in the fishing-net which I had set the evening
  before."</p>

  <p>"But that arrow was winged with the feathers of the&mdash;gray heron. And
  as often as the heron called, there answered still deeper out of the eastern
  forest the shrill cry of the black eagle."</p>

  <p>"Accident! And how could the Germans come here from the east? From the
  west, from Vindelicia only, could the Alemanni come, who are the nearest
  Germans to us. How could they have crossed the river unnoticed, unless they
  have wings, like the gray heron himself? Foresight is very praiseworthy, my
  young friend, and thou seest I am not wanting in vigilance. But thou art too
  anxious; youth and age have exchanged their <i>rôle</i>, I know," hastened
  Severus to add, as an angry look flashed across the handsome face of the
  young man, "I know Cornelius Ambiorix is only anxious for Rome, not for
  himself."</p>

  <p>"Why should I be anxious about a life that has no charm and no value?"
  asked the other, again composed, and sitting down by the old man. "The
  philosophy of the sceptics has destroyed the old gods for us; and I cannot
  believe in the Jew of Nazareth. A blind fate guides the world. Rome&mdash;my
  pride, my dream&mdash;sinks, sinks irretrievably."</p>

  <p>"Thou errest there," answered the other, quite composed. "I would to-day
  throw myself on this sword"&mdash;he grasped the weapon which lay near him on
  a cushion&mdash;"if I shared thy belief. But this sword&mdash;it is inherited
  from my imperial ancestor, Probus&mdash;gives me always fresh encouragement.
  Nine German kings knelt before that hero's tent, when he drew this sword out
  of the scabbard, and commanded the trembling ones, according to their own
  custom, to swear allegiance by the sword. And they swore it."</p>

  <p>"That is long ago."</p>

  <p>"And with this sword is also bequeathed in our family the oracular
  promise: 'This sword is conqueror in every battle.' It has been proved in
  many generations of our house. I myself, while I was allowed to serve, had
  defeated the Germans in twenty battles and fights, with this sword." And the
  old man pressed the weapon tenderly to his breast.</p>

  <p>"Pardon, if I correct thee," said the young man, smiling sadly; "not with
  this sword, but with Isaurians, Moors, Illyrians, and, most of all, with
  Germans, hast thou other Germans conquered. Rome, Latium, Italy has no more
  men. There are no more Romans. Celtic blood flows in my veins, Dacian in
  thine. And why canst thou no longer serve? Because thou hast often conquered,
  the mistrustful Emperor has taken the general's staff from thy hand, and in
  gratitude for thy services sent thee here in honourable banishment."</p>

  <p>"It was very&mdash;undeserved," said Severus, rising; "but no matter! I
  can be of use to the Roman state here also."</p>

  <p>"Too late!" sighed the other. "<i>Fuimus Troes!</i> It is over with us.
  Asia to the Parthians, Europe to the Germans, and to us&mdash;destruction. It
  seems to me that each people, as each man, lives out its life. Twelve
  centuries have gone by since Romulus was suckled by the she-wolf. We must
  allow that she had good milk&mdash;the venerable beast&mdash;and the wolf's
  blood in our veins has lasted long. But now it is diseased, and the baptismal
  water has utterly ruined it. How can the government of the world be
  maintained, when hardly any Roman marries, and the few children that are born
  are not suckled by the mothers, while these broad-hipped German women are
  filling the land with their numerous progeny. They literally eat us up, these
  forest people; they dispossess us from the earth more through their chaste
  fruitfulness than by their deadly courage. Three hundred and forty thousand
  Goths did the Emperor Claudius destroy; in four years after there stood four
  hundred thousand in the field. They grow like the heads of the Hydra. And we
  have no Hercules. I have had enough of it. I shall bring it to an end in the
  next battle. One does not suffer long after a blow from a German
  battle-axe."</p>

  <p>Severus seized the hand of the young man who had spoken so bitterly. "I
  honour thy sorrow, Cornelius, but thou shouldest act according to thy own
  words: thy Thalamos stands empty; thou must again make Hymen sound forth
  under the gray pillars."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" laughed the young man fiercely, "that a second Emperor may entice
  away from me a second spouse, as a bishop the first bride, an Emperor the
  first wife led astray? No! truly there are no more Romans; but still fewer
  Roman women. Pleasure, love of ornament, and love of power, are the three
  Graces whom they invoke. Have you ever heard that the priests among these
  barbarians befool the young girls? or their kings entice wives from the
  hearths of their free husbands? I have not. But a people without gods,
  without native warriors, without true wives, without children&mdash;such a
  people can no longer live. A people that has every reason to tremble before
  its own slaves, ten times more numerous than itself! If thou hadst only seen
  the murderous dark looks with which the slaves of Zeno, the usurer,
  threatened their lord and the slave-master, as they were just now driven in
  chains through the street! But I myself? How stands it with me? I have been
  everywhere, and held many different offices in Rome, in Ravenna, in
  Byzantium: soldier, magistrate, writer&mdash;all with success; and yet I
  found it all&mdash;vain, hollow. I have tried everything, it is all naught.
  Now, returned home to the town of my fathers, I find it ruled by a usurer
  from Byzantium and a sensualist and brawler from Mauritania; and the only one
  who still makes any opposition to this alliance, is not <i>thou</i>, and not
  <i>I</i>; we are only two honourable Romans! no: a Christian priest, whose
  fatherland, as he boasts, is not the Roman Empire, but heaven!&mdash;I have
  had enough of it!&mdash;I say it again: a people without gods, without wives,
  without mothers, without children&mdash;a people whose battles are fought by
  levied barbarians&mdash;such a people can no longer live! It must die; and
  that soon. Come, then, come, ye Alemanni! I cannot swallow hemlock. I will
  fall with the clang of the tuba, and imagine that I am falling under Camillus
  or Scipio."</p>

  <p>Cornelius was wildly excited. Severus seized him by both shoulders:</p>

  <p>"Promise me not to seek death until you see the next battle lost, and that
  you will be willing to live if we conquer."</p>

  <p>Cornelius nodded, sadly smiling, "I think I can boldly promise that. Thou
  and thy conquering sword&mdash;you will no longer keep back the quickly
  approaching ruin."</p>

  <p>At this moment a shrill blast from the tuba struck on their ear. The
  curtain of the inner bath was torn aside; an armed burgher rushed in and
  cried: "Hasten, Severus; now they are coming. German horsemen are galloping
  hither out of the western forest on the other side of the river!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

  <p class="first">With the help of the messenger and the bath attendants,
  Severus was quickly armed. Accompanied by Cornelius he hastened to the
  Vindelician gate, there to mount the high wall, which afforded a prospect far
  and wide. The exertion made him very hot, for it was now mid-day; the burning
  rays of the sun fell vertically on his heavy helmet.</p>

  <p>At the gate he was met by a centurion of the Tribune; Leo had already seen
  from the Capitol the horsemen swarming out of the western forest. He sent
  word there were only about a hundred Germans: he would himself immediately
  lead his cavalry to the gates, for he was able again to mount his horse.</p>

  <p>Severus ordered the soldier to follow him for the moment on to the walls.
  With Cornelius he looked intently over the plain, which stretched from the
  left farther bank of the river as far as the western forest.</p>

  <p>After long observation he turned. He was about to speak to Cornelius; but
  his eyes fell on two country people who were anxiously looking in the same
  direction.</p>

  <p>"Now," said he, "Geta, how could you be so foolish? You swore by all the
  saints that you had seen no trace of the enemy. Your cottages lie on the
  other side of the western forest. And now the barbarians lie hidden between
  you and the town! Were you blind and deaf?"</p>

  <p>"Or did you <i>wish</i> to be so?" interposed Cornelius mistrustfully.
  "Consider," warned he, "they have every reason to support the barbarians;
  rough and passionate these may be, but they do not press the last marrow out
  of the bones of their bondmen, like the imperial fiscal."</p>

  <p>But the elder of the two peasants answered: "No, sir, I am no traitor. I
  do not support the barbarians. Have I not served under the great Aëtius and
  received an honourable discharge and this little property? Believe an old
  legionary; and if you do not believe me, keep me here as a hostage till it is
  decided. Only yesterday I and my nephew were boiling pitch in the west
  forest&mdash;the traders from Ravenna give a high price for it. The whole
  forest is not five miles in breadth; if there had been many barbarians hiding
  themselves there, we must have seen them; it cannot be a migrating horde, an
  army of people; it can only be adventurers, a few horsemen who are
  reconnoitring to see how the country is protected."</p>

  <p>"We will show them how it is protected," cried Severus, and he raised his
  right hand menacingly. "The veteran is right, Cornelius. I believe him. It is
  only that handful of riders over by the river that is capering towards us. We
  will drench them for their insolence. Himilco, back to the Tribune. I decline
  the help of his Moors&mdash;hearest thou? I decline it altogether; it is a
  case of honour, to show these robbers that the burghers of Juvavum alone are
  men enough to chastise them."</p>

  <p>"I fully agree with you," said Cornelius. "It can only be a party of
  scouts."</p>

  <p>"I shall, notwithstanding, be cautious, and make the attack with an
  overpowering force; this time I <i>must</i> conquer&mdash;on account of thy
  vow, my Cornelius."</p>

  <p>He struck him on the shoulder with fatherly kindness, and descended the
  narrow flight of steps from the walls. Having reached the gate, he commanded
  the tuba-blower to hasten through all the quarters of the town, and summon
  the burghers to the Vindelician gate: in a quarter of an hour would the
  attack be made. Loud sounded the imperative tones in all parts of the town,
  and from every street the armed volunteers streamed forth to the
  north-western gate. One of the first was the fat Crispus, who came panting
  from his workshop hard by. He toiled along under an immense spear and shield.
  It was hot, and Crispus was old and corpulent. On his head, instead of a
  helmet, he carried a cooking utensil, in which, in peaceful times, the old
  Ancilla was accustomed to bake the&mdash;only too greasy&mdash;festival
  cakes! It was certainly now scoured quite bright, but it was somewhat too
  large, and at each step rattled about his ears. He did not present a very
  warlike appearance.</p>

  <p>Severus observed him with a shake of the head. "Now the will is
  good"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And the flesh is not weak!" mocked Cornelius.</p>

  <p>"But," continued Severus, "I would rather see thy slim nephew, the
  stone-mason. Why does he deny his arm to the Fatherland? Always with his
  young wife? Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Here he is!" cried an entreating voice high above their heads.</p>

  <p>Crispus had not had time to answer&mdash;had only pointed towards the
  tower at the gate; and behind the barred window of the second story, Fulvius
  was to be seen eagerly stretching forth both hands.</p>

  <p>"Let me out, O general! Help me down, and with the spear I will thank
  thee!"</p>

  <p>"Severus," said Crispus eagerly to the astonished general, "order the
  gaoler&mdash;there he stands, in the doorway&mdash;to release him; Zeno the
  usurer has caused him to be imprisoned."</p>

  <p>"Bring the man out, Carcerarius!" commanded Severus. "I need such a strong
  youthful arm. Let him pay first his debt to the Fatherland. Should he fall,
  he will be free from every debt; should he survive, he will return to the
  tower."</p>

  <p>The gaoler hesitated; but a blow in the ribs which Cornelius impatiently
  dealt him altered his opinion.</p>

  <p>"I yield to force!" cried he, rubbing the assaulted spot.</p>

  <p>"What an iron, strictly obedient Roman soul!" exclaimed Cornelius.</p>

  <p>Immediately afterwards Fulvius sprang over the threshold, seized the
  shield and spear which were brought to him from the store of arms on the
  ramparts, and cried:</p>

  <p>"Out! out before the gate!"</p>

  <p>Well pleased, the eye of the general rested on him.</p>

  <p>"I praise such zeal! Thou longest for the battle?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, no, sir," answered the young man ingenuously, "only for
  Felicitas."</p>

  <p>While Severus turned away vexed, Crispus comforted his nephew.</p>

  <p>"I have been watching thy house from the wall. Compose thyself, no
  barbarian has yet crossed the river."</p>

  <p>"And the Tribune?" whispered the young husband.</p>

  <p>"Has not yet left the Capitol"</p>

  <p>"And Zeno?"</p>

  <p>"Is fully occupied in bringing his treasures into the town and hiding
  them."</p>

  <p>Then the tuba-blowers returned from their rounds the last citizens from
  the most distant houses arrived.</p>

  <p>Severus and Cornelius drew them up in two companies, each of about three
  hundred men. Then the old hero stood before them and said:</p>

  <p>"Romans! Men of Juvavum! Follow me! Out before the gate, and woe to the
  barbarians!"</p>

  <p>He expected loud applause, but all were silent.</p>

  <p>One man alone stepped from the ranks, and said anxiously:</p>

  <p>"May I ask a question?"</p>

  <p>"Ask!" answered Severus, displeased.</p>

  <p>"How many barbarians may there be out there?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly one hundred."</p>

  <p>"And we are six hundred!" said this bold one, smiling comfortably and
  turning to his fellow-citizens. "To the gate!" cried he suddenly, striking
  his sword on the shield. "To the gate! And woe to the barbarians!"</p>

  <p>"Woe to the barbarians!" cried now the whole troop.</p>

  <p>The gate was drawn up, and over the drawbridge, which at the same time
  fell across the moat, the men hastened out of the town.</p>

  <p>Very few guards were left on the walls. Women and children now hurried
  from their houses, mounted the ramparts, and looked after their dear ones,
  who at a quick march were advancing towards the bridge below the town, the
  west end of which, as we have seen, had been in the morning barricaded and
  occupied by a small troop.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">At mid-day, when the Alemannian horsemen had first become
  visible, Leo the Tribune was lying in his richly-furnished chamber in the
  high tower of the Capitol, on a soft couch over which was spread a lion's
  skin. He felt in his best mood.</p>

  <p>His knee pained and hindered him no longer.</p>

  <p>He comfortably stroked the rich black beard which encircled a
  face&mdash;bronze-brown, small, originally nobly formed, but long since
  become terrible by passions.</p>

  <p>Before him, on a table of citron-wood, there stood, half-emptied, a large
  jug of fiery Siculer wine, and a silver drinking-cup.</p>

  <p>Two Greek slaves, father and son, were in attendance on him.</p>

  <p>The elder slave, raising his finger in warning, brought the mixing-cup.
  But, laughing, his master put it aside. "North of the Alps," said he, "nature
  herself mixes too much coldness in our blood; we do not need to dilute the
  wine. Is it not so, my demure Antinoüs? There, drink!" And he offered the cup
  to a third servant, a handsome boy of some fifteen years, who was crouching
  on the ground in the extreme corner of the room, as far as possible from Leo,
  and turning his back to his master. He wore only a purple petticoat round his
  loins. His other garments the Tribune had stripped off, that he might gaze on
  his splendid limbs. Without turning his beautiful, sad face, the prisoner
  shook his head, round which flowed long golden hair.</p>

  <p>Defiantly, threateningly, he then spoke: "My name is not Antinoüs; my name
  is Hortari. Set me free! let me go back to my own people in the rustling
  forests of the Danube! or else kill me! For know this, shameful man, never
  will I comply with thy orders."</p>

  <p>Leo angrily threw at him the heavy fortress-key, which lay on an ottoman
  near. "Depart hence, stubborn dog! Davus!" cried he to the younger slave, who
  was engaged in putting ready the armour of the Tribune, "drag him to the
  stable, and hang him there in chains! If the brat will not be his master's
  plaything, away with him to the beasts!"</p>

  <p>The boy sprang up and threw his woollen mantle around him.</p>

  <p>Davus dragged him away. The look, full of deadly hate, which the young
  German threw back, quickly turning as he passed out of the room, Leo did not
  observe. He soon recovered his good-humour.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow I shall have better company here in the Thalamos," said he,
  again stroking his dark beard, "than an untamable young bear. Felicitas! I
  drink to our first embrace!" And he emptied the cup.</p>

  <p>Then he stood up. "I need a support no longer!" He thereupon motioned away
  the elder slave, stepped to the window of the tower, and looked out.</p>

  <p>"There is not a hundred of them, these daring barbarians! What insolence!
  Only a few wear defensive armour; and their weapons of attack are pitiable.
  How many of their arrows, spears, battle-axes have already splintered
  harmlessly on my helmet and armour! They are coming straight towards me. I
  long for battle and victory! There is life down there in the streets of the
  town. Severus is gathering his cobblers and tinkers. But they will not get
  the better of the impetuous enemy. When the old man, who is playing the
  general, is in the greatest distress&mdash;I will let him struggle a good
  while as a punishment&mdash;then will I ride out with my cavalry like the
  storm of the desert, and sweep them before me. But first to the priest. No
  one in the town is now thinking of anything but the barbarians outside the
  gates. So I can accomplish it unnoticed. The danger from that priest must be
  very threatening, when the cowardly gold-sack himself counsels bloody means.
  He has ever menaced me, the psalm-whiner. First security and revenge, then
  the pleasure of victory, and for a reward&mdash;Felicitas. Let Pluto be
  saddled," commanded he the old slave, "and help me to arm."</p>

  <p>The old man took the order to the court below, and then returned to the
  tower. Leo had already put on the tall helmet with its flowing plume, and the
  splendid greaves, and the slave now helped his master to clasp and buckle
  over the dark-red tunic the magnificent breast-armour, which was adorned with
  many orders and distinctions. When Leo had girded on the sword, and was going
  to take the bronze shield, with the long, sharp spike in the centre, the old
  man took carefully from a small ivory box, which stood in the corner near the
  couch, a narrow leather strap with two diminutive appendages, and with an
  entreating, silent, impressively eloquent look, offered the charm to his
  master. It was a small, ugly idol in amber, and a tiny silver case.</p>

  <p>"Take it, my lord!" entreated the Greek, as Leo contemptuously pushed it
  away.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do with that? What sort of"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do not revile them," implored the old man; "or they will be malicious and
  protect no longer. Dost thou not know them, the guarding jewels? The one is
  the Egyptian god, Phtha, and the capsule encloses a hair of the beard of the
  Apostle Paul. If the first does not help, the second will. Wear to-day both.
  I had last night a bad dream."</p>

  <p>"<i>Thou</i> wear them, then!"</p>

  <p>"The dream did not concern me, but thee, my lord. I saw thee celebrating a
  marriage!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that thou seest often! This time with Felicitas?"</p>

  <p>"No, with Persephone, the queen of shades."</p>

  <p>"She is no doubt very beautiful," laughed the Tribune, spreading out his
  powerful arms; "let her only approach, she is welcome!"</p>

  <p>"May the omen be far distant!" cried the slave.</p>

  <p>"Thou art very anxious about me! Does my life concern thee? Why? Say, for
  what reason?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir, thou wast never so angry with Chrysos as"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"With all the others, wilt thou say?" laughed the Moor. "Only
  self-interest, old man; I need thee; that is, thy healing knowledge and
  fingers."</p>

  <p>"If thou wouldst only pray! And some one creature on the earth,
  love&mdash;some one name honour! It would be better for thee!"</p>

  <p>But the soldier gave a shrill laugh: "Love? Do I not every month love
  another woman?"</p>

  <p>"Thou destroyest what thou lovest!"</p>

  <p>"And pray? To which god shall I pray? With the same fervour and with the
  same results, have I seen prayer offered to Astarte and Artemis, to Osiris
  and Jupiter, to Christ and Jehovah. But honour? What can be sacred to me?
  Hardly so old as that German youth, I was stolen by Vandal horsemen. Then
  lost I home, parents for ever! Sold as a slave to the Romans, I suffered and
  enjoyed, even as a boy, things unspeakable&mdash;pampered, kissed, fed,
  whipped. I slew my last master, escaped into the forests of Calabria, became
  robber, robber-chief; was taken, condemned to the sports in the circus,
  pardoned by the Emperor when even my blood reddened the arena, placed among
  the mercenaries, soon by wild courage centurion and Tribune. To which god
  shall I pray? They all forsook me when I believed in them. But since I scorn
  them all, Fortune serves me like a beloved maid. And what shall I love and
  honour? My palm-rustling home? That is occupied by Vandalic barbarians! Rome?
  Rome at first ill-treated me like a captive beast of prey, and now hunts me
  like a tamed lion against her enemies. Very well; the nature as well as the
  name of this my terrible countryman have I chosen;" and he patted the
  proudly-maned head of the desert-king on his couch. "Booty, enjoyment,
  battle! Wine, war, women! And at last&mdash;no awakening&mdash;eternal night
  in the silent waste of death!" With that he seized both amulets, threw them
  from the tower window, grasped his spear, which was resting against the wall,
  and went clanging down the steep tower staircase.</p>

  <p>The Greek followed sadly.</p>

  <p>Having reached the wide court-yard, the Tribune commanded his troops to
  mount; he ordered the squadron to follow him into the town, and station
  themselves in the Forum of Hercules, there to wait till, he should lead them
  to the attack. The centurion Himilco, in command of the Isaurian
  foot-soldiers, was placed at the look-out post at the entrance of the
  Capitol, to watch the progress of the battle and any possible events in the
  town; and if his presence was required in the town or outside the walls, he
  must first close the strong gate of the citadel, and leave two guards there.
  The Tribune quietly ordered his two slaves, the old Greek and his son, to the
  foot of the Capitol with a closed litter: "under any circumstances," added
  he. "To drag on horseback a struggling woman up the steep path&mdash;that
  might oblige me seriously to hurt her&mdash;as in Galla's case," said he to
  himself. And now, having given all his commands, he placed his foot in the
  stirrup, to swing himself on Pluto, his magnificent black Spanish steed,
  which had, with the front hoof, been impatiently striking sparks from the
  granite pavement. He was hardly in the saddle when, through the open
  stable-door, his eye fell on the boy Hortari, who, with outstretched arms,
  was chained to the wall between two iron horse-racks. In a corner of the
  stable lay a round blue German shield, a spear, and a battle-axe, the weapons
  that had been taken from the boy at his seizure.</p>

  <p>"Ha! the future Antinoüs!" laughed he, fixing his spear at his side.
  "Unchain him! He shall go on the walls, and see the destruction of his German
  heroes. At night we will chain him with a whole pack of such bears."</p>

  <p>And he gave his steed the spurs, so that he started loudly neighing.
  "Beware of the bears of the forest," cried Hortari, now unchained, and
  stepping to the door of the stable with flashing eyes; "their claws will tear
  you in pieces."</p>

  <p>But the Tribune, with a laugh, shouted: "Up! to the gate! and woe to the
  barbarians!"</p>

  <p>And, following their powerful leader, the glittering cavalcade galloped
  off, rushing and clashing down the valley.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

  <p class="first">With less cheerfulness than the Tribune, had his confederate
  Zeno received the news of the appearance of the Germans before the town.</p>

  <p>He owned many estates outside the gates, managed by slaves and
  slave-women, who might take this opportunity, as the oppressed often do in
  such cases, to run away to the barbarians, and with them make good their
  escape.</p>

  <p>Although he was no patron of art, and was too prudent to leave treasures
  outside the fortress, yet his villas contained much valuable furniture and
  other household goods. There were also herds of cattle, sheep, and swine,
  which he would very unwillingly have bestowed on the robbers.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in the early hours of the morning, when Severus went out to
  reconnoitre and to take possession of the bridge over the Ivarus, Zeno sent
  out, under the protection of this troop, his slave-master, himself an
  emancipated slave, with a gang of armed men, to bring in from the houses
  which lay, at all events, on this side of the river, the most valuable
  effects. The slaves especially belonging to those properties were to be led
  into the town&mdash;if necessary by force. These peasants and herdsmen,
  always rougher, wilder, more insubordinate than the town servants, had only
  obeyed with reluctance; on two estates the unhappy creatures had resisted,
  but were overpowered by superior numbers and bound with chains to each other.
  The slave-master swung incessantly over them the many-lashed leather scourge,
  urging them to haste, and to burden themselves with still heavier loads,
  which they balanced on their heads.</p>

  <p>In a long train, those that were chained in the centre, cattle and sheep
  forward, armed slaves at each side, the overseers at the head and end of the
  line, they now came back through the Vindelician gate, which was immediately
  closed behind them.</p>

  <p>"Forward, Thrax, thou old dog!" cried Calvus, the overseer&mdash;he was
  considered Zeno's son by a slave-woman&mdash;to a white-haired old man who
  staggered under a load of bronze vessels; and as from feebleness he could not
  hasten his steps, Calvus struck him a severe blow on the back with the flat
  of his sword-blade.</p>

  <p>The old man cried aloud and stumbled to the ground.</p>

  <p>A gigantic neatherd, who was very heavily chained&mdash;he had resisted
  furiously, and still bled from several wounds&mdash;then halted; he thereby
  stopped the progress of all who were chained to him.</p>

  <p>"I pray thee, Calvus, spare my father! Give his basket to me."</p>

  <p>"Wait, Këix, thou cursed Thracian, I will give thee that which is thy
  due," cried Calvus, and struck him with the edge of the sword over head and
  shoulder, so that the blood spouted out. He was silent; not a cry of pain
  escaped his tightly-pressed lips. But Calvus continued: "Thou hast risen in
  open rebellion; we might have thee quartered for it. But it would be losing
  too much capital to kill such a beast, that we have fed for thirty years.
  Patience, my little son! I shall try on thee the new torture instrument which
  the master has procured from Byzantium. That shall be my refreshing evening's
  amusement."</p>

  <p>The strong Thracian grew pale; but with anger, not fear. He only cast a
  look at his persecutor, and again strode forwards.</p>

  <p>While some of the servants distributed the herds in the town stabling, the
  chained slaves were taken by Calvus to the court of the master's house in the
  Via Augustana, to receive their punishment.</p>

  <p>"Do with them as thou wilt," said Zeno in his writing-chamber, reading
  through the list of the rescued property, "only take care that the life and
  value, that means the power to work of these wretches, does not suffer
  thereby. Previous to mutilation, we must, according to the law of the pious
  Constantine, obtain the sentence of the Judge. I will ask my son-in-law.
  Mucius," and he smiled; "but, with a slight modification of the law,
  <i>afterwards</i>. Now I shall go to the Bath of Amphitrite to inquire the
  news."</p>

  <p>While he, accompanied by Calvus, was passing through the court, his eyes
  fell on old Thrax, who lay in the comer on some straw; quite exhausted, he
  had sunk into a deep sleep; by him, leaning against the wall, was his giant
  son, heavily chained; blood still trickled from his wounds. Zeno thrust at
  the sleeper with his staff; the old man opened his tired eyes:</p>

  <p>"Ah, am I still alive? I dreamt that the Lord had called me! I walked in
  Paradise! But on the earth also I belong to the Lord Christ!"</p>

  <p>"Then thy Lord Christ shall feed thee," mocked Zeno. "Calvus, that old man
  is good for nothing. Withdraw from him the wine and bacon. It is useless to
  feed him." His look then met the eye of the son, who grasped his chains in
  rage.</p>

  <p>Zeno was alarmed.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Calvus," whispered he; "that one there, after he has been
  tortured, let him be sold. He makes me uneasy. He has the look of our black
  bull immediately before it went mad. Away with him to the mines of the
  Fiscus! They need there such strong scoundrels, and the lead soon poisons.
  Now to the bath!"</p>

  <p>With that he went out of the court. He had hardly crossed the threshold of
  his house, when a lame slave hobbled in, who very much resembled the
  powerful-limbed Këix; it was his elder brother. But he did not seem to notice
  either the old father or the brother streaming with blood; he limped towards
  Calvus, and said, deeply bending:</p>

  <p>"My master, Mucius the Judge, sends you this writing. Zeno and thou, you
  are accused before him, by Johannes the priest, of having scourged the Syrian
  woman, so that the unborn child died. He says he can this time only with
  difficulty acquit you."</p>

  <p>The writing was long; while Calvus read it with a knitted brow, the lame
  man glided silently to his brother and pressed a file into his hand; it was
  wrapped in a strip of papyrus. Këix read: "After the mid-day meal." With his
  chained hand he lifted the small strip to his mouth and swallowed it.</p>

  <p>The lame man stood again behind Calvus. "What answer, sir?"</p>

  <p>Highly displeased, Calvus gave him back the indictment. "May Orkus swallow
  up this priest! He knows everything that does not concern him. I must myself
  speak with thy master. Go on! Thou limpest horribly, Kottys," laughed he.
  "But the expedient has been successful. We sold thee to the Judge as
  incorrigible. But since thy new master has cut thy sinews for thee, thou hast
  not again attempted to escape, and art become tame, quite tame." They then
  both left the court.</p>

  <p>In an hour Zeno returned from the bath. As he crossed the courtyard, all
  the slaves, chained and unchained, were sitting at their scanty meal,
  consisting of small pieces of coarse barley-bread, onions, and bad wine, sour
  as vinegar. He went into his writing-room to his accounts.</p>

  <p>There, as was well known, no one dared disturb him.</p>

  <p>This room&mdash;alone in the house&mdash;had instead of curtains a strong
  wooden door, which could be locked.</p>

  <p>The low window looked on a narrow lane, not on the principal street.</p>

  <p>He soon noticed an unusual noise, as of the screaming and running of many
  men in the distance. The door then opened gently. Astonished, displeased at
  the intrusion, Zeno turned.</p>

  <p>He was still more astonished to see old Thrax standing upon the threshold,
  who shut the door carefully, turned the key, and laid his finger on his lips,
  warning silence, for his master had angrily given a cry of displeasure.</p>

  <p>"Flee, master! Quick! Through the window! Thou art a dead man if they
  seize thee."</p>

  <p>"Who? Are the barbarians in the town?"</p>

  <p>"Thy slaves; they are in revolt; all, in the whole town. They will be here
  immediately."</p>

  <p>Horror seized the Byzantian. He was well aware what vengeance he had
  heaped up against himself. From the courtyard the wild cry already rang in
  his ears. He seized a large bag of gold pieces, and a little purse full of
  precious stones which lay before him on the counter of slate; he had been in
  the act of counting them. The old man pushed a stool to the window to help
  him to mount. Zeno started; it was with astonishment that he saw the old man
  actively engaged about his escape. "Why doest thou this for me?"</p>

  <p>The slave answered solemnly: "I do it for the sake of the Saviour;
  Johannes has taught me that my Lord Christ has said: 'Reward evil with
  good.'"</p>

  <p>"But whither, whither shall I flee?"</p>

  <p>"To the church! There is safety. Johannes will protect thee."</p>

  <p>"Johannes!"</p>

  <p>Zeno wondered if the Tribune had already carried out his bloody counsel.
  His knees shook. He was not able to climb the low breastwork of the
  window.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer sounded the uproar.</p>

  <p>He heard the voice of Calvus. "Mercy! mercy!" he cried.</p>

  <p>Immediately afterwards was heard a heavy fall.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" groaned Zeno, now at last lifted up by the slave to the window.
  "If they guess my hiding-place!"</p>

  <p>"Master, no one knows it but myself, and I"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt never betray me!" cried the Byzantian, and he seized the
  dagger in his tunic, thrust it to the haft in the neck of the old man, and
  swung himself into the street.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile the straggle outside the gates was being
  decided.</p>

  <p>The barbarians some eighty horsemen, had several times approached the
  river, but never within bow-shot; they had also trotted towards the blockaded
  bridge, but had made no attack on that strong position. The eyes of the
  people on the ramparts and of the attacking party were directed intently
  towards this enemy in the <i>west</i>.</p>

  <p>When the bridge was reached Severus ordered a small opening to be made in
  the barricade, through which only two men at a time could gain the left bank,
  and now, as the two last of the long train of burghers passed
  through&mdash;the bridge was still occupied by its original
  garrison&mdash;there sounded from the hills of the eastern forest, from the
  <i>right</i> bank, the piercing cry of the black eagle.</p>

  <p>Cornelius quickly turned and looked towards the east. "Heardest thou the
  cry of the eagle?"</p>

  <p>Severus nodded. "A good omen for Roman warriors! Seest thou how our golden
  eagle on the standard seems to raise its wings?"</p>

  <p>But Cornelius did not look at the standard-bearer; he looked only towards
  the eastern forest. "A column of smoke rises up from the chamois rock."</p>

  <p>"A charcoal-burner! Turn thy face! In the <i>west</i> stands the enemy.
  Lower the spears! Forward!"</p>

  <p>In two extended lines near each other, each three men deep, they now
  advanced towards the agile horsemen, who had quickly ridden back from the
  river as this mass of footmen passed over; they had halted half-way between
  the stream and the western forest, and had formed in two parallel lines. Only
  a spear's throw separated the enemies.</p>

  <p>Then as Severus and Cornelius, slowly advancing their columns, were just
  going to raise their spears, two Germans rode slowly towards them,
  ceremoniously turning the points of their lances downwards.</p>

  <p>"Halt!" cried Severus to his troops. "They wish to parley. Let us listen
  to them!"</p>

  <p>The two horsemen came now quite close to Severus and Cornelius. The
  combatants on each side stood back in anxious expectation.</p>

  <p>One of the two Germans, a youthful, towering, splendid figure, on a
  milk-white steed, was by the ornaments and splendour of his arms
  characterised as a leader; he might be more than ten years younger than
  Cornelius, who noticed with envy the muscular strength of the naked right arm
  of the young barbarian, adorned and at the same time strengthened by broad
  golden armlets; the left arm was covered by a small round shield, painted
  red, embellished in the centre with a spokeless wheel, a Rune or a picture of
  the sun. His breast was protected by splendidly-worked armour&mdash;ah! with
  feelings of anger Severus recognised, by the badges of honour appended
  thereto, that it had been the panoply of a distinguished Roman officer, a
  legate or <i>magister militum</i>;&mdash;he wore short leather breeches; from
  the ankle upwards the calf of the leg was bound round with neat leather
  straps; the left only of the two closely-fitting wooden shoes bore a spur;
  the rider scorned saddle and stirrups; a short double axe was stuck in his
  girdle, a white woollen mantle, fastened together so that it hindered no
  movement, hung at his back; it was the hand of the mother&mdash;for this
  youth was certainly yet unwedded&mdash;who had worked the handsome, broad,
  bright red stripe on its border; splendid light golden hair floated on his
  shoulders in natural curls, and surrounded the dazzlingly beautiful,
  maidenlike white face; and on the proudly arched Roman helmet, also obtained
  by plunder, towered, instead of the Latin black horse-tail, the pinion of the
  gray heron.</p>

  <p>The second horseman, a gigantic, gray-haired man of about sixty years,
  with a gray beard falling low on his breast and waving in the wind, seemed to
  be the leader o£ the retinue of his chief. He was simply dressed and armed;
  the mane and tail of his powerful war-horse, a brown stallion, were prettily
  interwoven with red and yellow ribbons; on his shoulders he wore the skin of
  a wolf, whose open jaws yawned at the enemy from the top of his helmet; his
  shield was painted in red and yellow circles; at his unarmed breast he
  carried a mighty horn of the bison of the primeval forest.</p>

  <p>The commander now raised his lowered spear, threw it into the bridle-hand,
  and offered the right to Severus, who took it with hesitation, and
  immediately let it fall.</p>

  <p>"First a grasp of the hand," cried the German, with a soft, richly-toned
  voice, in very good Vulgate Latin&mdash;"first a grasp of the hand, then, if
  you so wish it, a stroke with the sword. I know thee; thou art the brave
  Severus, formerly the <i>Magister Militum</i>. Thou art gallantly continuing
  the struggle at a lost post, for a lost cause. I pride myself in being the
  son of the hero Liutbert, king of the Alemanni. My name is Liuthari, and no
  man has yet conquered me."</p>

  <p>Severus frowned darkly. "I have heard of thy father's name, and of thine,
  you have stormed Augusta Vindelicorum."</p>

  <p>"But not retained possession of it," cried the king's son; and his clear
  gray eyes shone pleasantly. "Who would wish to live in walled graves? Also in
  your Juvavum we shall not settle."</p>

  <p>"That is provided against," muttered Severus.</p>

  <p>But Liuthari threw back his locks, laughing.</p>

  <p>"Wait a little! But say first, for whom leadest thou these burghers into
  the field? In whose name dost thou defend Juvavum?"</p>

  <p>"For the Imperator of Ravenna, who, as a good omen, unites the names of
  the first king and the first emperor; for Romulus Augustulus, the lord of the
  whole earth."</p>

  <p>Then the German drew a papyrus roll from his girdle, and threw it to
  Cornelius.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," said he. "You know less than we barbarians what is
  happening in your own Italy&mdash;in your own imperial chief city. Read what
  is written to me by one who knows it well. There is no longer an Emperor of
  the West! Romulus Augustulus&mdash;the boy's name is certainly a good omen
  <i>for us</i>!&mdash;is deposed. He lives henceforth on an island, and feeds
  peacocks; and on his throne sits my brother-in-law, the husband of my
  beautiful sister&mdash;Odoacer the brave. He has himself written it to
  us."</p>

  <p>Cornelius had glanced through the composition. He tamed pale and silently
  gave it to Severus, who read it trembling.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt!" said he, almost voiceless. "I know the man; he has
  served under me. Odoacer does not lie."</p>

  <p>"And we do not lie!" cried the gray-bearded companion of Liuthari. He
  urged on his horse and took the letter from the hand of Severus. "To split
  shields, not to falsify Runes, have I taught King Liutbert's son."</p>

  <p>One could well believe that of the old man. Before he put the roll into
  his girdle he looked into it with an important air; it did not disturb him
  that the letters were upside down.</p>

  <p>Severus supported himself on his spear. Cornelius looked darkly before
  him. "I knew it," he then said. "I had almost wished for it when I saw it was
  unavoidable; and now it is come it crushes me."</p>

  <p>"No longer an Imperator in Rome!" groaned Severus.</p>

  <p>"Italy in the hands of the barbarians!" sighed Cornelius.</p>

  <p>"You awake my deepest pity, gallant heroes," said the king's son, in a
  grave tone. "But now you see well: the battle must come to an end before it
  begins. For whom, for what will you yet fight?"</p>

  <p>"For the future!" cried Severus.</p>

  <p>"For the past&mdash;for honour!" cried Cornelius.</p>

  <p>"For immortal Rome!" said both.</p>

  <p>"Byzantium yet rules&mdash;soon will Byzantium send another Emperor,"
  threatened Severus.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps!" said Liuthari, shrugging his shoulders. "But in the meantime we
  want a settling-place, fields, and pasturage, we Germans. And therefore I
  bring you a message in my father's name: 'So speaks Liutbert, the King of the
  Alemanni, in his own name and in that of his allies'"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Who are these allies?" interrupted Cornelius.</p>

  <p>"You will find out quicker than you will like," answered gruffly
  Liuthari's companion.</p>

  <p>Liuthari continued: "'Let him stay in the land who will do so peaceably;
  he who will not stay let him peaceably retire. The fortresses to be vacated;
  they must be destroyed. Two-thirds of the land remain to you; one-third is
  for us.' That is a reasonable division."</p>

  <p>But Severus started up angrily, raising his spear. "Bold barbarian! Darest
  thou thus to speak, with eighty barbarians against the host of Juvavum's
  burghers? Thou hast learnt to speak as a Latin, but not to think as a
  Roman!"</p>

  <p>"I should think," interposed Cornelius, "that your country was large
  enough for you, ye Alemanni, when you can only send eighty horsemen to
  conquer Juvavum. Do you think I can yield to <i>you</i>?"</p>

  <p>A peculiar smile played around the young German's handsome mouth, about
  which the first downy beard charmingly curled. "Take care, Roman! Are we too
  few for thee? Soon may we seem too many. Out of a few the wonder-working
  Wotan wakes many! For the last time&mdash;evacuate the fortress; divide
  peaceably the country!"</p>

  <p>"Never! Back, barbarian!" cried the two Romans at once.</p>

  <p>Liuthari turned his horse suddenly round. "It is your wish. You are, then,
  lost. Wotan has you all!"</p>

  <p>The two horsemen then galloped back to their men.</p>

  <p>"Haduwalt, sound the horn!"</p>

  <p>The old master-in-arms put the horn to his mouth, and a load roaring tone
  struck on the ear of the Romans; and before they could obey the command of
  their leaders and advance against the enemy, there sounded behind them, <i>in
  the east</i>, from the river, from the town, now quite near, the loud cry of
  the black eagle; and immediately afterwards such a fearful noise of whoops,
  cries of anguish, and the clashing of weapons, that all the six hundred men,
  and both commanders, turned in dismay. Horror and despair seized them.
  Germans&mdash;Germans innumerable, as it appeared to the alarmed Romans
  rushed forth from the eastern forest, and from all the slopes of the
  mountains and brushwood of the hills. A strong detachment hurried towards the
  bridge; others, on horse and on foot, threw themselves into the river above
  and below the bridge; but the greater part, laden with ladders and trunks of
  trees on which the horizontal branches had been left, approached the town;
  and with fierce rage the shut-out citizens saw how whole masses of the
  stormers, crowding together like ants, helped to raise each other, supported
  themselves on the ladders, beams, and trees, climbed up, and, in many places
  almost without resistance from the few sentinels, at once gained the crown of
  the ramparts.</p>

  <p>Juvavum, the town, was conquered before its defenders had been able to
  strike a blow.</p>

  <p>The garrison had been enticed out, with the exception of the soldiers of
  the Tribune. Were <i>they</i> still in the Capitol? The leaders looked
  anxiously towards the tower: the imperial <i>Vexillum</i> was still
  fluttering at its summit.</p>

  <p>But the cry of joy with which the Alemannian horsemen greeted the success
  of their heroic confederates recalled the Romans to the threatening danger
  from this near enemy. Severus ordered Cornelius, with about a hundred men, to
  engage the Alemannian troopers, while he himself, with the greater part of
  the deeply discouraged burghers, turned back to the bridge, to assist its
  garrison, which was now being attacked from the unprotected open east
  side.</p>

  <p>He again heard the sound of Haduwalt's horn. Severus turned.</p>

  <p>"Yield!" cried the king's son. "You are lost!"</p>

  <p>"Never!" cried Cornelius, and threw his spear as Liuthari was galloping
  towards him.</p>

  <p>Liuthari turned the stroke aside with his shield arm: the next instant
  Cornelius fell backwards, pierced to the heart through shield and armour by
  the lance of the German hurled while at full speed.</p>

  <p>"I will avenge thee!" cried Severus, and was turning towards the king's
  son; but at the same moment a cry of distress again called him eastwards.</p>

  <p>The enemy had overpowered the garrison of the bridge; already many of the
  swimmers, horsemen and footmen intermixed, had reached the troops of Severus.
  Active youths, whose yellow hair floated in the wind from their uncovered
  heads, ran, holding on to the manes of the horses; and thus attacked at once
  by horse and foot, the citizens of Juvavum, knowing their town, their
  relatives, were already in the power of the conqueror, threw away their arms,
  and fled on all sides. At the same time the Alemanni from the west rode down
  the hundred men of Cornelius.</p>

  <p>Severus stood alone: his spear fell from his hand.</p>

  <p>The leader of the enemy that had come so suddenly from the east then
  approached him. He had galloped in advance of his followers on to the bridge,
  where his horse was pierced and fell. He then advanced on foot, a giant in
  stature. The mighty pinion of the black eagle bristled menacingly on his
  helm; his red hair, combed towards the crown, and drawn together behind, fell
  below his helmet; an enormous bear-skin hung on his shoulders: he raised his
  stone battle-axe.</p>

  <p>"Throw down thy sword, old man, and live," cried this giant, in Latin.</p>

  <p>"Throw down this sword?" said Severus. "I will not live!"</p>

  <p>"Then die!" cried the other, and hurled his stone axe.</p>

  <p>Severus fell: his breast-plate was rent in twain, it fell in two pieces
  from his body.</p>

  <p>He supported himself painfully on his left arm: the conquering sword he
  had not yet let fall.</p>

  <p>The victor bent over him, picking up his axe.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, before I die," said Severus, with a weak voice, "in whose hands
  is Juvavum fallen? Of what race are you? Are you Alemanni?"</p>

  <p>"No, Roman; we have been summoned by the Alemanni. We do not come from the
  west. We come from the east, up the Danube. We have taken all the Roman towns
  from Carnuntum hither; the last legion this side of the Alps have we defeated
  at Vindobona. We share the land with our comrades the Alemanni&mdash;the
  Licus is the boundary. Look here; already from the mountains of the east our
  people stream down into the country&mdash;women and children, waggons and
  herds&mdash;that is the advanced guard; tomorrow will come the great
  horde."</p>

  <p>"And what is your name?"</p>

  <p>"We were called formerly Marcomanni; but now, 'the men of Bajuhemum,' the
  Bajuvaren, all this land is ours for ever, as far as one can see to the north
  from the Alpine ridge. Yield, then, gray-head! there yet remains to
  thee"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"This sword," said Severus, and he thrust into his heart the conquering
  sword of the Emperor Probus.</p>

  <p>The giant drew it out and a stream of blood rushed forth.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the Bajuvaren. "The old man is dead. It would be a pity,"
  continued he slowly, looking at the sword, "if this good blade were lost.
  Come, brave weapon; serve henceforth the new lord of the land. But now must I
  thank Liuthari; everything hit together admirably. Yes; these Alemanni! They
  are almost wiser than we! Hojo, Sigo, Heilo!" cried he, holding his two hands
  hollowed before his mouth. "Liuthari! beloved, where tarriest thou? Garibrand
  calls, the Bajuvaren duke. Hojoho! Sigo! Heiloho! Now let us share the booty
  and the land!"</p>

  <p>Liuthari galloped forward and offered his hand to the duke. "Welcome in
  our new home! Welcome in victory!" cried he, with a joyous voice.</p>

  <p>But then sounded from the town fresh noise of arms and tumult of
  battle.</p>

  <p>"The victory is not yet complete," said Garibrand, pointing with his axe
  to the Capitol.</p>

  <p>There was now heard, through the battle-cries of the Bajuvaren in the
  town, the clear warlike call of the tuba. "That is the Roman general and his
  host!" cried the duke. "He is coming from the fortress down into the town on
  my men! Quick! bring me another horse! Into the town! To the help of my
  heroes!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

  <p class="first">With the exception of the two leaders, very few Romans had
  fallen in the short hand-to-hand combat; for the Bajuvaren duke had before
  the attack given the order: "To-day&mdash;prisoners! No slain! Consider, ye
  men; every man slain is a loss, every prisoner a servant gained for the new
  masters of the land!"</p>

  <p>Fulvius and Crispus had been among the troops turned by Severus against
  the Bajuvaren. When their ranks were broken, the nephew cried to the uncle:
  "To Felicitas! Through the ford!" and as they had stood together, so they now
  ran together towards the river below the bridge, for that was held by the
  enemy.</p>

  <p>But the stout Crispus, although he had quickly thrown away spear and
  shield, was soon left far behind the agile stone-mason.</p>

  <p>An Alemannian horseman, with a youth running at his side, followed
  both.</p>

  <p>Crispus was soon overtaken.</p>

  <p>His ridiculous appearance challenged the rider to give him a blow on the
  casserole covering his head in the place of a helmet, it fell over his eyes
  and nose, from which poured a stream of blood, he gave a loud cry and fell to
  the ground; he thought he was dead.</p>

  <p>But he soon came back to the agreeable certainty of life, when the
  foot-soldier, who had remained by him, roughly tore the casserole from his
  head. Crispus sprang up, gasping for breath, the German laughed in his big,
  fat, highly-astonished face.</p>

  <p>"Ha! this Roman hero has had good provender. And this nose is not red with
  its own blood or with water either. Ho, friend, I will set thee free, if thou
  wilt reveal to me where in Juvavum the best wine can be got. It seems to me
  thou art the man to know it."</p>

  <p>Crispus, so pleasantly spoken to, recovered himself quickly, now that he
  was quite convinced that he was not dead, and would not have to die for the
  fatherland.</p>

  <p>He drew a deep breath and spoke, raising his hand as an oath:</p>

  <p>"I swear as a Roman burgher, Jaffa, the good Jew, near the Basilica, has
  the sweetest. He is not baptized&mdash;but neither is his Falernian.</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" cried the Alemannian. "Come, ye friends!"&mdash;a whole crowd
  of Alemanni and Bajuvaren were shaking hands close about him&mdash;"to Jaffa
  the Jew, to drink our gratitude to the god Ziu for our pleasant victory!
  Thou, fat fellow, lead on, and if, contrary to thine oath, it is sour, this
  Jew's wine, we will drown thee therein."</p>

  <p>But Crispus was not alarmed; he rejoiced, on the contrary, that he would
  now be able to drink gratis, as much as he wished, of the choicest
  long-stored Cyprus wine, which hitherto had been quite beyond his means. That
  it was to be drunk to the honour of the god Ziu did not make the wine worse.
  "And," said he to himself, "it is at all events better pleasing to God that
  we empty the Jew's wine-skins than those of a good Christian."</p>

  <p>He did not trouble about his house. "They will not interfere with my old
  Ancilla; her wrinkles will protect her better than many shields. The bit of
  money is buried; they will not carry away the plaster statues, they will only
  cut off their noses with great zeal and an incomprehensible liking for the
  business: it does not matter, one can stick them on again," But he was
  anxious about Fulvius, about Felicitas.</p>

  <p>He looked about for the fugitive, but could not see him either lying dead,
  or brought in a prisoner; he seemed to be swallowed up by the earth: the
  rider who had pursued him had turned his horse in another direction, and was
  pursuing other flying Romans. Crispus hoped that the young husband had
  escaped. He (Crispus) was quite unable to help Felicitas, for his conqueror
  held him firmly by the shoulder and pushed him towards the bridge.</p>

  <p>"Forward! Thou canst not imagine, Roman, how Alemannian thirst burns. And
  near the Basilica, sayest thou? That is right! There we shall find, besides,
  gold and silver cups for the liquor."</p>

  <p>And in front of the whole noisy, laughing, shouting swarm, the fat
  Crispus, an involuntary pot-companion, stumped along as fast as his short
  legs could carry him, towards the gate through which he had shortly before
  marched, a proud helmeted legionary. He had left the casserole where it fell,
  but he was still reminded of it by the smarting of his nose.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Fulvius had actually disappeared. He had not thrown away
  shield and spear, like his corpulent companion; he was young, strong, he had
  no fear, and he thought of the promise which he had given at his release to
  the gallant Severus. He had now reached the river and stood firmly on the
  marshy bank. He heard the hoof-strokes of the galloping horse coming nearer
  and nearer, and he resolutely turned, looked at the enemy fiercely, raised
  his spear, took good aim and threw it with all the strength of his arm
  against the face of the German.</p>

  <p>"Well aimed!" cried he, as he dropped the reins, and with his left hand
  caught the whizzing spear.</p>

  <p>The shield of Fulvius would now have availed him little, for the galloping
  horseman aimed at the same time with both spears, his own and the one he had
  caught, at the Roman's head and abdomen. But before the deadly lances reached
  him, Fulvius had suddenly disappeared; in stepping backwards from the
  snorting horse, that must the next instant have prostrated him, he lost his
  balance, slipped on the smooth grass, and fell backwards into the stream, the
  waters of which, dashing up, closed over him. The Alemannian bent down from
  his steed and looked after him laughing as he was carried away.</p>

  <p>"Greet the Danube for me" cried he, "when thou hast reached it;" then
  turned his horse and galloped across the fields.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Zeno hastily pursuing his way, had reached the corner of the
  narrow street.</p>

  <p>Loud cries sounded behind him; he looked round; the flames broke crackling
  through the roof of a house close by; it was that of the Judge, his
  son-in-law. Full of fresh anxiety he hurried forwards.</p>

  <p>After a few steps he came to the door of the priest's small house, which
  stood open.</p>

  <p>He sprang across the threshold, flew along the narrow, imperfectly-lighted
  passage. No Ostiarius, no sub-deacon showed himself. He hurried into the
  priest's room, the same into which we have already been.</p>

  <p>It was empty.</p>

  <p>The door which led into the adjoining church was ajar.</p>

  <p>The fugitive entered and hastened across the dimly-lighted space to the
  altar, which, dividing apse and nave, furnished the most sacred asylum in the
  church. Here on the steps lay Johannes, stretched out motionless, with both
  arms clasping the relic-shrine on the altar.</p>

  <p>In his anguish new horror seized the hard Byzantian.</p>

  <p>Was he murdered?&mdash;He, who might perhaps have been able to protect
  him?</p>

  <p>"Woe is me!" groaned he.</p>

  <p>His horror increased when he, who lay as dead, slowly raised himself and
  silently turned his pale, venerable face.</p>

  <p>"Ha! do the dead rise again?" cried Zeno, shrinking back.</p>

  <p>"Why dost thou think me dead?" asked Johannes, regarding his disturbed
  countenance with a soul-piercing look.</p>

  <p>"Not I&mdash;not I&mdash;but the Tribune wished"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I imagined so! What seekest thou here?"</p>

  <p>"Safety! safety!" stammered the usurer; he again thought only of the
  danger that was following his steps. "My slaves! All the slaves have
  revolted. The Judge's house is in flames."</p>

  <p>Then a bright light as of fire shone through the open windows of the
  church, and arms clashed in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Hearest thou? They are seeking me! They come! Save me! Cover me with thy
  body. Here, all this gold"&mdash;he threw the heavy bag on the altar, it
  burst and single gold pieces ran clinking over the steps on to the marble
  pavement. "Alas! it escapes from me faithlessly! All this gold&mdash;or the
  half&mdash;no&mdash;all, the whole will I give thee&mdash;no, not to
  <i>thee</i>. I know thou wilt devote it to St. Peter, to thy church, to the
  poor&mdash;only save me!"</p>

  <p>And he threw himself at the priest's feet, carefully concealing the little
  purse of jewels in his bosom.</p>

  <p>Johannes raised him.</p>

  <p>"I <i>will</i> save thee!&mdash;for Christ's sake, not for the sake of the
  gold."</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt stay with me," cried Zeno with rising hope.</p>

  <p>"That I cannot do. My place at this hour is on the battle-field, to attend
  on the wounded. My brethren I have already sent out. I was only deriving
  strength from a last prayer."</p>

  <p>"No, no, I will not let thee go!" cried Zeno, clinging to him.</p>

  <p>But, with unlooked-for strength, Johannes freed himself.</p>

  <p>"I must, I tell thee. The Lord calls me. Perhaps I may even check the
  slaughter. But thou&mdash;thy cruelty has so enraged the unhappy creatures,
  that some of them would not be restrained by the altar&mdash;by my
  intercession"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes!" agreed Zeno.</p>

  <p>He thought of Këix, the mad bull.</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt be hidden where no one but God the Lord can find thee. See
  here!"</p>

  <p>With these words he stooped down and raised a slab of the marble flooring
  near the altar; a short ladder was visible, which led into a dark, tolerably
  spacious vault.</p>

  <p>"Go down there. No one but myself knows of this old cave. Wait till I
  fetch thee out; I will come as soon as the danger is over."</p>

  <p>"But if&mdash;and if"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Thou meanest if I lose my life? See, thus can the roof-stone be lifted
  from below. Hasten!"</p>

  <p>"It horrifies me&mdash;to be buried alive! Are the bones of the
  dead&mdash;skeletons&mdash;&mdash;Pardon; are there relics in the vault?"</p>

  <p>"Fear thou henceforth the living God, not dead men. Here, take the
  oil-lamp; and now away! Hearest thou? The tumult presses nearer."</p>

  <p>Then Zeno sprang down, lamp in hand. Johannes seized the money-bag, and
  threw it in after him; the miser noticed with agony that the priest had first
  taken out a handful of solidi. He replaced the stone, and then strewed the
  gold pieces from the principal door, of the church (which he bolted on the
  inside) up to the altar, and from there as far as, and over, the threshold of
  the door which led from the church into his own house. He then hastened
  through this door, and out of his house into the open air.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes, Zeno heard, with a despairing heart, furious
  axe-blows thundering on the great door of the church.</p>

  <p>It burst open and a great crowd of men&mdash;to judge from the voices and
  footsteps&mdash;crushed in. Zeno held his breath in an agony of fear; he
  pressed his ear to the slab, in order to hear better. He perceived first the
  voice of a woman.</p>

  <p>"Do not kill him in the church!&mdash;in the sanctuary of the saints! He
  scourged me almost to death, and killed my child. But do not kill him in the
  church. Honour the house of the eternal God!"</p>

  <p>"Rather in the house of God than in the house of the good Johannes!" said
  another voice.</p>

  <p>"It is sanctuary only on the altar, not in the whole church!" cried a
  third. But then Zeno heard the terrible Këix scream out:</p>

  <p>"At the feet of the Father in heaven would I strangle him! He has at the
  last murdered my old father, who had entreated me to spare the monster. When
  I would not yield, he stole from my side. I found him again when we had
  broken open the villain's door, and his dagger was in my father's neck. I
  could murder him seven times."</p>

  <p>"Once is enough," said Kottys, "if we murder him as slowly as we have
  killed my master. Mucius the Judge we have burnt alive in the flames of his
  own house."</p>

  <p>"Halt! Look here, brother Kottys; this is the track of the fugitive. The
  wounded hyena sweats blood; the fleeing miser sweats gold. See here! at the
  portal it begins: then he is inside&mdash;has drawn the bolt behind
  him&mdash;here, past the altar has he run; and there&mdash;through that door
  into the priest's house! There he must be hidden. After him!"</p>

  <p>"After him! Down with him!" roared the whole mob, and ran with rambling
  steps across the slab over Zeno's head, away into the adjoining house.</p>

  <p>The miser, senseless with fright, had crept back into the farthest corner;
  long cowered he there; cold sweat ran from his brow.</p>

  <p>But all remained quiet, the last sound died away; the pursuers had, after
  searching the priest's house, poured out into the street.</p>

  <p>He said to himself: "The Tribune will soon observe the conflagration, and
  the uproar in the town. He has already repeatedly subdued such riots. With
  his lancers he will in a few hours re-establish order." Thus presence of mind
  and a certain courage slowly returned to him.</p>

  <p>By the light of the oil-lamp, he now looked around him in the cellar-like
  vault.</p>

  <p>He stumbled against a chest. A strange curiosity, mixed with dread,
  impelled him irresistibly to open it; perhaps here the sly old fellow hid the
  treasures of his church! He lifted up the lid; the chest contained nothing
  but papyrus rolls and parchments; spread over them was a white, priestly
  garment with a hood, exactly like that which Johannes had worn.</p>

  <p>An idea struck the fugitive. He hastily drew the wide robe over his own
  garments.</p>

  <p>"I shall not stay long in this place, and I am now safely
  disguised&mdash;better than in armour."</p>

  <p>After a time, as all remained still, he became uncomfortable in the damp
  air of the vault; he carefully half-raised the slab, mounted the ladder and
  looked into the empty church.</p>

  <p>His eye fell on the glittering gold pieces, which shone in the light of
  the altar-lamp.</p>

  <p>A few had been picked up by his pursuers, but they thirsted more for blood
  than gold. Already the miser repented having promised the priest so much.</p>

  <p>"He, moreover, rejected the gold; so I am no longer bound to give it. And
  these scattered pieces&mdash;they shall not fall to the scoundrels."</p>

  <p>He now lifted the slab quite up, and listened again anxiously. All was
  silent.</p>

  <p>Then he deliberately placed money-bag and purse of jewels in the chest,
  closed the lid, climbed quickly out and picked up the solidi&mdash;at first
  those that lay nearest, then those by the altar; he then saw to the right of
  the altar a whole heap lying together, as they had fallen out of the burst
  bag.</p>

  <p>He went now from the left of the altar towards the right, stooped
  down&mdash;oh, horror! he heard steps approaching from the priest's house!
  Only one man, certainly, but that was not Johannes&mdash;there was the clang
  of metal!</p>

  <p>He quickly attempted to regain his hiding-place, but before he could pass
  the altar, a black shadow fell across his path. Zeno could not, unnoticed,
  spring into the vault.</p>

  <p>His knees failed him; so, drawing the hood quickly over his head, he threw
  himself into the position in which he had found Johannes, with his arms
  encircling the relic shrine on the altar. At the same moment cold steel
  penetrated his neck. He was dead before he had heard the words, "Die,
  priest!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">But the murderer now thought it was not the high-towering
  form of the Presbyter. He bent down so that the black horse-tail of his high
  helmet fell forwards, and drew back the hood, and with it the head of the
  murdered man.</p>

  <p>With a short scream he let it again fall.</p>

  <p>"Irony of fate! The usurer! How comes he here? How in this disguise? Where
  is the priest?"</p>

  <p>But before the Tribune could think about these questions, his whole
  attention was drawn towards the chief entrance of the church, by a noise of
  the most startling kind.</p>

  <p>Leo had stationed his troops in the Forum of Hercules; had left them with
  the command there to await his return. He had dismounted, and put his horse
  in charge of one of the troopers. He wished to reach the priest's house on
  foot, by a circuitous route through narrow streets, where he would be less
  observed.</p>

  <p>He had been startled when half-way by seeing the flames rise, and hearing
  in the distance the tumult of the revolted slaves. He stood still.</p>

  <p>A fleeing woman then hurried towards him, with covered head, he stopped
  her.</p>

  <p>"It is thou, Tribune!" cried the fugitive.</p>

  <p>"What? Thou, Zoë! The Judge's wife! What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"The slaves! Our house is burning! Save! help!"</p>

  <p>"My troops are standing in the Forum of Hercules. I will return myself
  immediately. Then will I help."</p>

  <p>He had then hurried into the empty house of the priest, rushing through it
  with sword drawn, he reached the Basilica, and instead of him he sought, had
  struck dead his own confederate. He had hardly discovered this, when there
  sounded in the direction of the portal the bugles and trumpets of his
  horsemen, calling to the attack.</p>

  <p>"They are in conflict with the rioters," thought the Tribune, and he was
  going out through the doorway. "Rascals of slaves! while the barbarians stand
  before the gates!"</p>

  <p>But on the threshold he suddenly stopped: for quite a different sound
  struck on his terrified ear&mdash;not the raging howl of frantic slaves; no,
  a cry well known to him&mdash;the watch-cry, the war-cry, the cry of victory
  of the Germans, and&mdash;it was close at hand.</p>

  <p>"Germans in the town? Impossible!"</p>

  <p>But, stepping carefully out from the door of the Basilica, he saw at the
  corner of the great square whole swarms, yes, hundreds of Germans, on
  foot&mdash;not the few horsemen whom they had so long observed&mdash;and they
  were advancing straight towards the church.</p>

  <p>"To fight one's way through! Impossible! Back! through the priest's
  house!"</p>

  <p>He fled through the nave of the church, past the still raised stone slab
  into the house of Johannes. But the noise came towards him in that direction
  also, loud laughing and shouting, and he saw approaching a crowd of Germans
  with a stout Roman at their head, whom they had heavily laden with
  wine-skins.</p>

  <p>As quickly as his heavy armour would allow him, he turned back into the
  Basilica, sprang&mdash;this seemed the only possible place of
  safety&mdash;into the open vault, pulled down the stone slab, and immediately
  heard the Germans pouring into the church through both entrances. Shouting
  and exulting the conquerors greeted each other over the head of the
  imprisoned commandant of Juvavum.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

  <p class="first">We will join the drinking Germans above, rather than the
  Tribune raging in impotent wrath below the marble floor.</p>

  <p>"Welcome in victory, ye brave Bajuvaren!"</p>

  <p>"For that we thank you, ye clever Alemanni!"</p>

  <p>"Did we not entice them out well?" said another comrade in arms. "First of
  all we&mdash;that is, Liuthari, our famous king's famous son, and two of his
  followers&mdash;surprised a post of five Moorish horsemen, whom the Tribune
  of the Capitol had sent out against us as spies. But we know the forests
  better than those brown Africans. Four were dead, or prisoners, before they
  were aware of it. One escaped&mdash;alas! But it seems he was not able to
  tell much. Then a little company of us slipped across the river&mdash;an
  Alemannian horse can swim like a swan&mdash;and galloped to you Bajuvaren in
  the eastern mountains, in order that at the right time the call of the heron
  should be answered by the cry of the eagle."</p>

  <p>"And this time you also, ye heavy-stepping Bajuvaren, contrary to your
  manner and custom, actually came at the right time," teased Suomar, another
  Alemannian.</p>

  <p>Fiercely the Bajuvaren put his hand to the battle-axe in his girdle. "What
  does that mean, thou Suevian blockhead? It is my opinion we have come early
  enough to cut you down&mdash;you as well as all others who wait long enough!
  Although you are so quick in thought and hasty in words, many times already
  you have not had limbs quick enough for flight, to escape from us, if we are
  slow."</p>

  <p>Provoked thus, the other was going to answer angrily, but Vestralp, the
  first Alemannian, interposed soothingly: "Never mind, both of you; thou, my
  Suomar! and thou, brave Marcoman! Once there, the Bajuvaren fight so
  splendidly that they make up for lost time."</p>

  <p>"They have often shown that!" cried Rando, a third Alemannian.</p>

  <p>"The last time," continued Suomar, "just now, in the market-place, and on
  the steep path up to the citadel, against the cavalry of the Tribune."</p>

  <p>"Listen! What was that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! did not a groan come out of the ground?"</p>

  <p>"There!&mdash;at the left by the altar."</p>

  <p>"Look! behind the altar! Perhaps some one wounded."</p>

  <p>Two warriors hastened to the spot and looked behind the altar, but they
  found nothing.</p>

  <p>"But what lies there in front&mdash;on the steps?"</p>

  <p>"A dead man."</p>

  <p>"A Roman?"</p>

  <p>"A priest, as it seems."</p>

  <p>"The slaves must have done that; the rioters who joined themselves to us
  when we had climbed the walls," said Helmbert, an aged leader of the
  Bajuvaren. "They are now the guides to the richest booty."</p>

  <p>"Take the corpse away! On the stone steps is the best place to sit and
  drink," said Helmdag, his son.</p>

  <p>"Dare to do it, thou blasphemer! That is the table of the most exalted
  Lord of Heaven," threatened Rando.</p>

  <p>"It is not true," cried Helmdag. "Thou art a Catholic. This is a heretic
  church, more harmful than any abominations of heathenism. So my Gothic
  godfather, the Bishop of Novi, teaches me."</p>

  <p>"Thou stinking Arian!" answered Rando. "Thou denier of Christ! I will
  teach thee to give to the Lord Christ equal honour with the Father. I will
  fill thy mouth with my fist, and with thine own teeth as well!"</p>

  <p>"With us the son always stands behind the father," growled Helmdag.</p>

  <p>"Peace! both of you," commanded Vestralp, "fill your mouths with Roman
  wine. Bring the skin, Crispus, thou Roman hero! Do not untie it! A stroke
  with the sword. So! It spouts like red blood out of wounds! Now the helmets
  and hollow shields, until the noble Roman in the buck's skin is exhausted.
  And as concerns the strife about the two stone steps, I think that a good man
  honours everything that is sacred to another. Therefore, brothers, we will
  all draw back from those steps."</p>

  <p>"But the gold and silver on the walls, on the pillars and stone coffers?"
  said Helmdag, the Arian.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that is to stay for the plundering slaves?" said Rando the
  Catholic.</p>

  <p>"No!" cried the enlightened pagan, who had spoken for peace&mdash;it was
  Vestralp, the vanquisher of the helmeted Crispus&mdash;"that would be a pity.
  We will divide it amongst us all: for the God Ziu, for the Romish Bishops,
  and for the followers of Arius."</p>

  <p>And they immediately set to work with the bronze helmet, or deer-skin cap,
  full of red wine in the left hand, the battle-axe in the right. Drinking
  heartily during their work, they broke away from the sarcophagi, holy
  shrines, and even from the columns, all that was valuable of the metal
  ornaments and jewels, and also the stones that pleased the eye by their
  variegated colours.</p>

  <p>Garizo, a young, slim, tall Bajuvaren, lifted from the neck of a Saint
  Anne her necklace of heavy gold and sapphires, giving at the same time a deep
  bow, and saying:</p>

  <p>"With thy permission, holy goddess, or whatever else thou mayest be; but
  thou art horribly ugly, and of dead stone. What one sees of thy bosom is
  yellow; but my bride Albrun is alive and young, and wonderfully beautiful;
  and very pretty will these stones look on her white neck."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but where are they then, your women and children, and unarmed folk?"
  asked Vestralp of the busy bridegroom.</p>

  <p>"They will come to-morrow down the eastern mountains," answered Garizo.
  "For this we have at last found out, 'slow-moving' as we are, as thy
  hasty-tongued comrade just now said&mdash;this we have now learnt: to send
  the men forwards into the battle, and let the unarmed come afterwards when
  the victory and land is won."</p>

  <p>"There must be something in it," laughed Vestralp, "in this name
  'slow-moving,' because it vexes you so. If one called you a coward, you would
  only laugh and strike him down. You are a strange people! No other race so
  calm, and at the same time so terrible in anger."</p>

  <p>"I will tell thee," spoke thoughtfully Helmbert, the white-bearded. "We
  are like the mountains; they stand quiet, whatever goes on round about them.
  But if the tumult within gets too vexatious, they overturn in rocks and
  fire."</p>

  <p>"You have shown this time that you also can be cunning and crafty," cried
  Suomar. "With what artful care did you prevent the enemy getting scent of
  your approach! So sharply did you watch all the roads, and even the
  mule-tracks and the paths of the chamois-hunters, that no intelligence from
  the east could reach Juvavum."</p>

  <p>"And not to make the Romans suspicious at the absence of all news," added
  Helmbert, "we sent our own Roman settlers disguised like peasants and
  workmen, as if they were the people from Ovilava and Laureacum, into the
  town, there to buy and sell."</p>

  <p>"And if these had revealed all?" asked Suomar.</p>

  <p>"Their relatives left behind would have been put to death. That was said
  plainly enough to them. But besides this, the poor people would rather
  support us than their Roman tormentors."</p>

  <p>"The burghers of the town soon gave up the contest; they find themselves
  under a new rule; as they see, we do not eat them," said Helmdag,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>"Yes; <i>only</i> the cavalry and foot-soldiers of the Tribune fought
  bravely, and with exasperation," said Rando.</p>

  <p>"Tell us about it," urged Vestralp. "We, who fought on the other side of
  the river, do not know yet exactly what happened within the walls, or how the
  citadel fell so quickly."</p>

  <p>"By the sword of Ziu, it was wonderful!" began Rando. "There, on the great
  square, where the Christian saint stands with lion's skin and
  club"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<i>That</i> a saint! That is a heathen god!"</p>

  <p>"No; a demi-god."</p>

  <p>"All the same to me," continued Rando; "he did not help the Romans,
  whether saint, or god, or demi-god. But we were surprised on that
  market-place. After we, some twenty Alemanni, with the Bajuvaren&mdash;they
  can climb like cats, these mountain huntsmen of Bajuhemum&mdash;had clambered
  over the walls, we thought all was over. But when we came to the open market,
  there came galloping towards us, in close order, with the crashing sounds of
  the tuba, the cavalry of the Tribune. He himself was not to be seen; it was
  said, he lay ill in the citadel; but he was not taken prisoner there. We were
  at first very few, and it was only with difficulty that we could stand
  against them. But we gradually pressed them back; step by step they were
  forced upwards towards the Capitol. But then came the Isaurian infantry to
  their help, and it was now a fearful struggle&mdash;man against man. Ah! I
  have again seen them fight with their Wotan's fury, these Bajuvaren."</p>

  <p>"Say, rather, lion's courage," interposed proud Helmdag the Bajuvaren,
  "for we carry the lion on our standard, and lion's courage in our
  hearts."</p>

  <p>"How come you with the southern beast? I think the bear stands nearer, and
  more resembles you."</p>

  <p>"Thou thinkest that, forsooth, thou sharp-witted Suevian!" said old
  Helmbert, coming to his son's help, "because you know so much more than we;
  but you do not know everything. Three hundred years ago one had not heard the
  name of the Alemanni; but our ancestors, the Marcomanni, had already long
  fiercely fought with the Romans. And at that time victory cradled itself on
  the wings of the golden eagle. There was, in the golden house of Nero on the
  Tiber, a great, wise Emperor skilled in magic. He had found out, by his
  magical arts, that if he made two lions swim across the Danube, the bravest
  people on the earth would conquer in the impending battle. But our fathers,
  the Marcomanni, said: 'What yellow dogs are these?'&mdash;killed the lions
  with clubs, and afterwards slew the army of the Emperor and his general:
  twenty thousand Romans lay dead on their shields. The clever Emperor in Rome
  knew then which was the bravest people on the earth. And since then we carry
  two lions on our colours. So sing and tell our bards. Now, continue,
  Suevian."</p>

  <p>"That I will, to your glory! Like cats&mdash;or if thou, Helmdag, wouldst
  rather hear it, like lions&mdash;sprang the Bajuvaren on to the necks of the
  Moorish horses, and allowed themselves to be dragged along rather than let
  go. 'Give to Loge his due,' says a proverb that I have heard among the
  Anglo-Saxons: the Moors and Isaurians fought desperately, man by man covering
  the narrow, steep path which only offered space for two horses. At last the
  Duke came to our help; he brought fresh troops, and now in a sudden attack
  with levelled spears, pushing our way between the horses, we scattered the
  whole entangled mass. The Bajuvaren now used their short knives in a
  hand-to-hand conflict. They ran under the long lances of the Isaurians,
  sprang on to the saddle of the fully armed Moorish horsemen, and in face and
  throat&mdash;the only vulnerable part&mdash;thrust the blade of their
  daggers; on both sides, now right, now left, fell the enemy, horse and man,
  over the low breastwork of the Roman wall on to the jagged rocks in the
  depths below. Nevertheless the battle might have lasted long around the
  citadel; indeed, hunger alone would have subdued those rock walls if the rest
  of the enemy, who now at last fled, had gained the gate. But they did
  <i>not</i> succeed in getting within it. A great deed was done by the hand of
  a Bajuvarian boy; I saw it plainly: having been overtaken by the Bajuvaren, I
  was, at last, no longer fighting, but was watching the gate of the fortress,
  which, high above me, was distinctly visible. I then saw that one of the two
  Isaurians who there stood on guard, ran towards his fleeing comrades; his
  movements plainly indicated that he was urging them to still hastier flight
  into the fortress, before the barbarians should press in with them. The other
  Isaurian stood on the threshold, holding the iron bolt in his hand, ready to
  close the half-door from the inside and draw the bolt as soon as the
  fugitives had poured in. Then, suddenly, as if struck by lightning, the man
  fell forward on his face: he stood up no more. Immediately afterwards
  appeared a boy with fair hair on the tower above the gateway; he cut down
  with a battle-axe the imperial purple standard, and in place of the fallen
  banner planted, on a tall spear, which shone afar, a blue shield.</p>

  <p>"'My Hortari,' then cried Garibrand, the Duke, 'my brother's son, stolen
  many weeks ago, and thought dead! <i>His</i> shield, the victorious blue
  shield of our house, of our family. Forward, ye Bajuvaren! Now to cut our way
  to Hortari!'</p>

  <p>"But there was nothing more through which to cut our way; the Tribune was
  not there; the slaves of the Tribune were also not to be found in the
  fortress: the brave child was the only human being inside the Capitol. The
  fight before the gate was over immediately; the enemy shut out, powerless,
  one man springing on the back of another trying to climb the high walls,
  pressed still harder by us, soon threw down their arms and yielded. A few
  certainly, despairing of grace, or despising it, spurred their horses from
  the steep path into the abyss below. The gate of the citadel of Juvavum flew
  open from the inside, and young Hortari sprang into his uncle's arms; this
  youth of the Bajuvaren had won for his people the Capitol of Juvavum."</p>

  <p>"Hail to the youth Hortari! The minstrels will have him in
  remembrance!"</p>

  <p>"Hail to the youth Hortari!" sounded loud through the wide halls of the
  Basilica.</p>

  <p>When the joyous cry had died away, quarrelling words were heard at the
  farther end of the building.</p>

  <p>In the apse behind the altar, two, flushed with wine, were in loud
  strife.</p>

  <p>In a chest containing Roman memorials, which the zealous Johannes had
  taken away from his flock, in order to wean them from their pagan
  superstitions, the two men had found a small, beautifully-carved marble
  relief, representing the three Graces tenderly clasping each other. They had
  seized the piece of sculpture; and screaming and shouting, now dragged and
  pulled each other through the church till they stood before Vestralp and
  Helmbert.</p>

  <p>Then one of the disputants let fall the marble and flashed his short knife
  against his opponent, who immediately dropped the plunder and seized the
  hand-axe in his girdle.</p>

  <p>"Halt, Agilo!" cried Vestralp, seizing the arm of his fellow
  tribesman.</p>

  <p>"Stab <i>Romans</i>, if thou wilt, not Alemanni," shouted Helmbert, and
  struck down the knife of his countryman.</p>

  <p>"Well! You shall decide," cried both disputants with one breath.</p>

  <p>"I saw it first," cried the Alemannian. "I wished to hang it on my
  favourite horse as a breast-plate."</p>

  <p>"But I took it first," retorted the other. "They are the three
  fate-spinning sisters. I should hang it up over my child's cradle."</p>

  <p>"The strife is easily settled," said Vestralp, picked up the three Graces
  from the floor, took the axe from the hand of the Alemannian, aimed well, and
  cut the relief exactly through the middle.</p>

  <p>Helmbert seized the two pieces and said:</p>

  <p>"Forasitzo, Wotan's son, who is the judge in Heligoland, could not have
  divided it more evenly; there, each of you has a goddess and a half. Now go
  and drink reconciliation."</p>

  <p>"We thank you very much," said the combatants, again unanimous and highly
  satisfied.</p>

  <p>"But there is no more wine," complained the Alemannian.</p>

  <p>"Or I should have drunk it long ago," sighed the Bajuvaren.</p>

  <p>"Heigh, Crispe, son of Mars and Bellona," cried Vestralp, "where is there
  wine&mdash;more wine?"</p>

  <p>Crispus came panting. "Oh, sir, it is incredible! But they have actually
  drunk it all! The prudent Jaffa," whispered he, "has still a very small skin
  of the very best; but that is for thee alone, because thou hast saved my
  life." He continued aloud: "There is a large stone jug full of water; if we
  mix that with the last dregs in the wine-skins there will still be abundance
  of drink."</p>

  <p>But Vestralp raised his spear-shaft and shattered the great jug so that
  the water ran in a stream. "Let the man be cut off from the race of the
  Alemanni," cried he, "who at any time mixes water with his wine! That special
  wine," continued he quietly to Crispus, "the poor Jew himself shall keep. Let
  him drink it himself, after all his fright."</p>

  <p>Then there sounded from outside the call of the great ox-horn. And
  immediately afterwards the door of the church was thrown open. A gigantic
  Bajuvaren stood on the threshold, and cried with a loud voice: "You are
  sitting there and drinking in blissful indolence, as if all was over; and yet
  the battle is again raging in the streets. The slaves of the Romans! They are
  burning and destroying, while the town is <i>ours</i>! Protect your Juvavum,
  men of Bajuhemum! So commands Garibrand, the Duke."</p>

  <p>In an instant all the Germans had seized their arms, and with the loud
  cry, "Defend the Juvavum of the Bajuvaren!" they rushed out of the
  church.</p>

  <p>When the last footstep had long died away, the marble slab was carefully
  raised; the Tribune climbed out. The man so brave, so fond of war, had
  suffered the bitterest torments of humiliation during this long time. Was he
  not a Roman, and did he not know his duty? It stung his honour as a soldier
  that he, blindly following his own passions, pursuing only his <i>own</i>
  object, had made the victory so easy for the barbarians. His looks were
  sullen; he bit his lips. "My cavalry! the Capitol! Juvavum! vengeance on the
  priest! victory! all is lost&mdash;except Felicitas! I will fetch her; and
  away, away with her over the Alps!&mdash;Where may my Pluto be?"</p>

  <p>Leo crept through the priest's house into the narrow street, and carefully
  sought the shadow of the houses. It was beginning to get dark, so long had
  the drinking bout above his head detained him a prisoner. Like a slinking
  beast of prey, stooping at every corner, and with a spring quickly gaining
  the side of the opposite street, he avoided the large open squares and
  crowded streets. He then heard, in the distance, the roaring noise of
  confused voices. He looked back; flames were rising into the heavens, already
  darkened with smoke.</p>

  <p>The Tribune hastened to gain the north side of the ramparts; to find the
  Porta Vindelica unoccupied he could not hope, even from German recklessness;
  but he knew the secret mechanism by which, without key, a small sortie-gate
  could be opened which led into the high road to Vindelicia. This doorway he
  now endeavoured to reach. Unchallenged, unseen, he mounted the wall, avoiding
  the steps; opened the door; closed it again carefully; slid down the steep
  slope, and gained the moat, which, formerly filled with water, had
  now&mdash;the sluices were all destroyed&mdash;lain dry for tens of years.
  Weeds and bushes above a man's height grew therein.</p>

  <p>He had hardly reached the bottom of the moat when a loud neighing greeted
  him out of a willow-plot; his faithful horse trotted towards him, nodding its
  head.</p>

  <p>Two other horses answered out of the bushes.</p>

  <p>Immediately afterwards two men crept out of the thicket, crawling along
  the ground on all-fours. It was Himilco the centurion, and another Moor.</p>

  <p>They beckoned to him silently to follow them into the hiding-place. They
  had escaped into the moat after the dispersion of their troops by the
  Bajuvaren. The black steed had followed the two other horses, the man in
  charge of him having fallen.</p>

  <p>Since then they had remained hidden among the thick bushes of the
  moat.</p>

  <p>"The first gleam of light on this black day," said the Tribune. "We three
  will fly! Come! There to the left the river approaches the moat. The horses
  can easily reach it with a leap, and then swim across. I must go to the
  Mercurius hill, down the Vindelician road; then&mdash;over the
  mountains!"</p>

  <p>"Sir," implored Himilco, "wait till night. Twice already have we tried to
  escape by that way. Each time we were observed by the Alemannian horsemen,
  who incessantly march before the gates to seize fugitives; each time it was
  only with the greatest difficulty that we regained our shelter. Only in the
  darkness of the night can we venture."</p>

  <p>The Tribune was reluctantly obliged to acknowledge this counsel as
  well-grounded. "At night," said he to himself, "I shall be better able to
  carry off Felicitas." So, impatient enough, he determined to await the
  darkness in this hiding-place.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

  <p class="first">Far away from the hidden fugitives, in the south-east side
  of the town, strife and tumult were meanwhile raging.</p>

  <p>Many of the revolted slaves, after revenging themselves on their masters,
  had thrown down their arms; but the <i>wildest</i> spirits, restrained by the
  Germans from further incendiarism, murder, and robbery, and driven by them
  from street to street, had now crowded together for a last resistance.</p>

  <p>Here lay the large imperial magazines for the building of boats and rafts
  for the traffic of the Ivarus, especially the salt-trade: also immense stores
  of well-dried wood, sail-cloth, pitch, and tar. These favourites of the
  fire-god the mad creatures wished to set on fire. They hoped, in their blind
  destructive fury, that the conflagration would from there spread its red and
  black wings over the whole city.</p>

  <p>But the magazines were covered with slates on the flat roofs, were
  protected by high stone walls, and shut in with strong oak doors; the few
  guards round about had, certainly, long since fled, but, even undefended,
  stone and iron-bound wood would for some time resist the fury of the
  assailants.</p>

  <p>But now came Këix, the leader of the host, from the bath of Amphitrite,
  close by, which was in flames, swinging in one hand a blue and in the other a
  green pitch torch, such as were used in the illumination of the ornamental
  gardens.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" cried he; "now see! We will have to-day the richest fire-works! The
  Christian emperors have indeed forbidden the Saturnalia, but we will
  introduce them again, but this time to the honour of Vulcan and Chaos!"</p>

  <p>And he propped both torches against the oak panels of the door, which
  immediately began to smoulder. But now the pursuing Bajuvaren had reached the
  spot.</p>

  <p>The barricades in the streets they had, after a short, wild conflict with
  their defenders, thrown down; and they now rushed forward in a close wedge
  with Duke Garibrand at their head.</p>

  <p>"We have you, incendiaries! Down with your arms! Extinguish those flames
  instantly; or, by the spear of Wotan, no man among you shall remain
  alive."</p>

  <p>Instead of answering, Kottys lifted up the heavy iron rod&mdash;the long
  bolt which he had torn from his own slave prison&mdash;and screamed:</p>

  <p>"Dost thou think we wish to change our masters? We will be free, and
  masters ourselves. And all shall be destroyed on this whole earthly ball that
  reminds us of the time of our slavery. Come on, ye barbarians, if you want to
  fight with desperate men."</p>

  <p>And now a furious rage threatened to break forth.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a loud, powerful voice cried: "Stop. Peace be with you all!"
  Between the combatants stepped the venerable form of Johannes; behind him
  appeared his ecclesiastical brethren; they, assisted by some of the burghers
  of Juvavum, were carrying on barrows and litters, wounded slaves, Moors,
  Isaurians, and also some Germans.</p>

  <p>"Make way for us! Let us take these wounded&mdash;they belong to you all
  who are here fighting&mdash;to my church."</p>

  <p>The words, the look, had immediately a silencing, an appeasing effect. At
  the sign of their Duke, the Bajuvaren lowered their lifted weapons; most of
  the slaves did the same. Fearlessly Johannes walked into the thickest part of
  the crowd; all reverently shrunk back. The women&mdash;for there were many
  women amongst the mob&mdash;knelt down and kissed the hem of his garment. He
  stepped straight towards the door which had now caught fire.</p>

  <p>Kottys alone tried to turn him away.</p>

  <p>"Back, priest!" he cried, and threw the iron bar; and as Johannes quietly
  walked on, the iron struck him on the shoulder. He sank&mdash;his blood
  flowed on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Woe to thee, brother!" cried Këix. "Thou hast murdered the only protector
  of the poor and miserable&mdash;our father's best friend!"</p>

  <p>And the wild man knelt by the priest, holding him in his arms.</p>

  <p>To do this he was obliged to throw away his weapon, an iron trident, which
  he had torn from the hand of a Neptune at the fountain. Nearly all his
  comrades followed this example. Kottys threw the rod on the ground, and
  entreated:</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, Father Johannes!"</p>

  <p>The priest raised himself. "Thou hast repented, therefore God has forgiven
  thee. Who am I&mdash;a sinner&mdash;that <i>I</i> should forgive?"</p>

  <p>He now stepped unhindered to the door, threw down the torches, picked up
  one of the broad shields, pressed it with the right hand against the burning
  door, raised imploringly the left towards heaven, and said:</p>

  <p>"Fire! thou also art a creature and a servant of God the Lord! I command
  thee&mdash;I adjure thee, thou hellish demon of flame, retire hence into
  hell."</p>

  <p>The fire was then extinguished. Johannes let the shield fall, and turned
  again to the crowd; his face was radiant with the glory of the deepest
  conviction.</p>

  <p>"A wonder! A miracle of the Lord by the hand of the devout Johannes!"
  sounded out from the whole host of slaves. The most defiant now threw away
  their weapons and sank on their knees, crossing themselves. Among the Germans
  many also made the sign of the cross and bent the knee; but Këix and Kottys
  raised their hands towards Johannes as if in worship. Duke Gariband then
  advanced to the Presbyter, and spoke slowly:</p>

  <p>"Thou hast well done, old man. Here, my hand. But say," continued he, and
  a sly smile flashed across his lips, "if thou hadst full confidence in the
  magic of the Runic words that thou didst utter to the fire, why didst thou
  also use the shield?"</p>

  <p>The priest so addressed stood erect and said: "Because we should not tempt
  God. Not that the Lord needed my arm or the shield to extinguish the
  fire."</p>

  <p>"It has never yet happened," said the Duke, thoughtfully nodding his head,
  "that one of you Christian priests was at a loss for an answer. You
  have&mdash;and thou especially hast&mdash;power over souls, more than my
  sword over the conquered, use it ever as at this time. I know well how
  powerful you are, ye men of the cross, on the Danube there rules one,
  Severinus by name; he has more authority by his word than Rome and the
  barbarians. We shall be good friends; I shall respect thee. But hear this. I
  shall allow you to worship Christ as you will; take thou care not to hinder
  my people from sacrificing as they will. No, no, old man, do not shake thy
  head; I suffer no contradiction!" And he lifted his finger threateningly.</p>

  <p>But undaunted, Johannes said:</p>

  <p>"If the Lord will call the wanderers to Himself through my mouth, fear of
  thee will not close it. Thy duchess is already won to the Lord. Verily, I
  tell thee&mdash;thou, and thy people&mdash;you will not escape Him. But you,
  rise," said he, turning to the slaves. "I will entreat for you with the
  victors, who are now the rulers of this land. I will teach them, that ye
  also, created in the image of God, are also their brethren, and that your
  immortal souls are redeemed by the death of Christ. I will teach them, that
  he who sets his slaves free wins the warmest place in the heart of the Father
  of heaven."</p>

  <p>"But he who has still to remain in servitude," interrupted the Duke, "let
  him know, that we Germans are noble-minded masters; we do not burden and
  punish the slave according to the caprice and temper of the master; as our
  free people are judged by the free, so the bond people are judged by their
  fellows&mdash;in the court of justice, according to the law. You stand
  henceforth under the protection of the strongest judicial fortress&mdash;the
  law, and the tribunal of your own comrades! So be comforted: you serve noble
  masters."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

  <p class="first">Soon after the slave insurrection had been quelled in the
  manner above described, two Germans walked through the Porta Vindelica on to
  the great military road, in the direction of the Mercurius Hill.</p>

  <p>"See, the evening twilight is fading and the stars are already appearing,"
  said the one, and, balancing his spear on his shoulder, he raised both hands
  to heaven. "I greet you, ye watchers of Asgard, ye all-seeing eyes. Send me
  happiness! I divine that <i>you</i> know," added he in low tones, "what
  happiness my heart desires. It aches, this heart&mdash;I think because it is
  empty."</p>

  <p>He then again seized his spear and stepped forwards, his eyes directed
  into the mist-veiled distance, as if searching and longing: his white mantle
  floating in the wind. He was very handsome, the young son of the king; and
  this dreaming manner gave to his noble, serious features a heart-winning
  charm.</p>

  <p>"If the stars wish to show <i>me</i> what is most pleasing," grumbled his
  companion, throwing back his wolfs skin, "let them show me quickly a
  wine-shop. It is long, long since I had what I wanted. My throat smarts,
  because it is empty, I think. Vestralp and his men, they hit it off well.
  Some Christians were in their troop, and, I suppose as a reward for their
  faith, the brave Christian Baldur took them into his church; there, or close
  by, they found and drank a whole flood of wine, as if they had been in the
  halls of Thor. But I have only swallowed a few drops in a deserted house,
  where the meal had just been served as the Bajuvaren forced their way into
  the town. Listen, their Duke is right: it is too strict, the way thou dost
  carry out thy vow."</p>

  <p>"Can one interpret a vow, a duty, too strictly, old man? Thou thyself hast
  taught me better."</p>

  <p>"Truly, thy father made thee swear never to sleep a night in a Roman town,
  snaring-pits spread over with nets for noble game the king calls
  them&mdash;but Juvavum, as Garibrand justly said, is now a town of the
  Bajuvaren."</p>

  <p>"King Liutbert himself can alone permit me so to interpret the vow. But be
  comforted: thou shalt soon drink wine, as much as thou wilt."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"In the house where we will now seek hospitality."</p>

  <p>"But in which?"</p>

  <p>"For my sake in the nearest, in order to quench thy thirst. Look there, on
  the right of the road stands a hill with a house upon it; one can see the
  white statues of the gods on the roof, gleaming through the bushes."</p>

  <p>"But down there, to the left of the road, lies another; it seems larger,
  more stately, more promising."</p>

  <p>"It is all one to me."</p>

  <p>"Then we will choose the larger&mdash;that on the left."</p>

  <p>"But look, there shot a star from heaven! and it fell immediately on the
  roof of the house to the right, on the hill. That is a hint from the gods. I
  will gladly follow the star. We will go to the house on the right."</p>

  <p>He thereupon sprang from the high road on to the little foot-path that led
  to the stonemason's house.</p>

  <p>"We shall also come short at the division of the booty, because of thy
  foolish strictness," grumbled the old man, following him.</p>

  <p>"No," cried Liuthari, "Duke Garibrand will summon me thereto early in the
  morning; he promised me that, when he bade us farewell at the Vindelician
  gate. Besides, the chief gain of this victory to us is not a few gold vessels
  or a tract of land, but that henceforth we have for our trusty frontier
  neighbours on the east, instead of the Romans, the faithful Bajuvaren. It has
  become too narrow and shut in for them in Bajuhemum and along the Danube,
  since the East-Goths increased so powerfully, so they have spread out towards
  the north and west. Agilolf, another of their dukes, related to Garibrand,
  set out, when the latter started for Juvavum, through the Bojer forest
  against Regina Castra, the strong Roman fortress on the Danube, where it
  reaches the most northern point of its course. I wonder if he has yet taken
  it?"</p>

  <p>"The news of victory cannot be delayed much longer; and with this message
  comes also another, which closely concerns thee, Liuthari." The young man
  blushed, and silently drooped his head. "Duke Agilolf's daughter Adalagardis
  is the most beautiful young woman I have ever seen," continued the old man
  eagerly. "Her father and King Liutbert have long thought to unite you; but it
  seems that the proud Bajuvaren will not ally himself by marriage with a
  king's house till he can do so as an equal. Therefore he sent me home from my
  wooing journey with the words: 'From the conquered Roman fortress I will send
  an answer.' And I think it is time for thee, my boy! Thou standest in the
  fulness of thy youth, and thou hast blood, not water, in thy veins."</p>

  <p>"I often think fire burns therein," said the young man quietly, as if
  ashamed.</p>

  <p>"Dost thou think that I did not see, in the conquered Juvavum, with what
  eyes thou didst gaze at every Roman maiden who looked at thee? Many of them,
  I think, would not have struggled much in thy arms."</p>

  <p>"What, Haduwalt! Force! Force towards a woman!"</p>

  <p>"Eh! by Berahta and Holda! it would not need <i>much</i> force. But these
  black-haired, yellow-skinned, lean cats are nothing to my king's son; they
  would ruin the whole race. But, Adalagardis! prosperity to thee and to us if
  she becomes thy wife. I should imagine the shield-maidens of Wotan to be like
  her! Hardly a finger's breadth shorter than thou, fair hair floating around
  her to the ankles, like a king's golden mantle, arms round, full and white as
  Alpine snow, joyful, sparkling eyes, clear as the sky in spring, and a
  proudly-arched, heaving bosom. By Fulla, the exuberantly strong and
  beautiful! that is the right king's wife for the Alemanni! Why didst thou not
  go long ere this and woo her?"</p>

  <p>"Thou forgettest; I have never seen her. Her father said: 'I will invite
  thee when I hold my court at Regina Castra.' Yet she may be the happiness,
  uncertain and yet ardently longed for, the Sälde that I seek. Stop! Here we
  are at our goal. This is the entrance.&mdash;But what is this? This house
  seems inhospitable. The entrance is barricaded with slabs of stone."</p>

  <p>"Ha, now," laughed the old man. "I cannot blame them, the house-folk, for
  shutting out such guests as Haduwalt and his thirst. But they are not to be
  kept back so easily. Not Haduwalt, Hadumar's son&mdash;and still less his
  thirst. Down with the stones!"</p>

  <p>And he had already seized with a strong hand one of the piled-up marble
  slabs, to throw them inwards.</p>

  <p>"Stay!" cried Liuthari, "look!&mdash;on the topmost slab of the barricade
  there is something written; perhaps the name of the house. I think I can yet
  see to read it."</p>

  <p>"I could not read it," laughed the other, "even if the sun stood high at
  noon. What do the Runes say?"</p>

  <p>And Liuthari read&mdash;slowly, laboriously, deciphering letter by
  letter:</p>

  <p>"Hic&mdash;habitat&mdash;felicitas&mdash;nihil&mdash;mali intret."</p>

  <p>Struck with surprise, motionless, the young man was silent for a while.
  His heart beat&mdash;the blood rose throbbing in his temples.</p>

  <p>"How strange!" said he then to himself. "Here dwells happiness&mdash;the
  happiness that I am seeking? And the shooting star&mdash;did it on that
  account guide here my steps?"</p>

  <p>"Now, by the wondering Wotan," said Haduwalt, "have the Runes enchanted
  thee?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes; this may indeed have been engraved to direct me to a blessing,
  protecting enchantment."</p>

  <p>The old man hastily seized the king's son by the shoulder and wished to
  draw him away.</p>

  <p>"Then let us retire," whispered he anxiously. "I would rather force my way
  through two lines of Romans than through a magic spell. See, already thou
  seemest spell-bound before the entrance. What is the meaning of the
  Runes?"</p>

  <p>"How can I explain it to thee? Now, something like this: 'The wishing-god
  and Sälde herself live here. May malicious beings never approach!' This Lady
  Sälde who lives here, I will see," said Liuthari with decision; and, with the
  help of shield and knee, he pushed the middle slabs inwards, so that the
  whole erection of stone fell with a loud crash into the garden.</p>

  <p>The young man stepped quickly across the threshold.</p>

  <p>"This is no spell that scares away; it invites and entices in. Here dwells
  happiness. The god of wishes himself has led me here. And <i>we dare</i> to
  approach&mdash;for we certainly are not malicious creatures."</p>

  <p>"Who knows whether the master of the house may not think us so?" said the
  old man thoughtfully, shouldering his spear, and following his young friend,
  who impetuously, as if driven by a god, stepped towards the inner door of the
  house, behind which&mdash;it was only closed by a dark yellow curtain which
  fluttered in the wind&mdash;a faint glimmer of red light seemed to beckon one
  in. Yet, in spite of all his haste, Liuthari noticed a rose-bush, which,
  loosened from its support, lay helpless on the sanded path. He carefully put
  it back in its place, remarking, "it would be a pity if it were trodden
  down."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Liuthari sprang up the four steps in one bound and pushed
  back the curtain. But farther went he not: he stood as if spell-bound, as if
  rooted to the ground at the sight which presented itself to him.</p>

  <p>He indeed drew back a step as if alarmed; in his astonishment, his spear
  struck the ground and threatened to escape from his right hand. For towards
  the king's son, with a noble step, as an alabaster Hebe might have stepped
  down from her marble pedestal, advanced Felicitas.</p>

  <p>She carried her slumbering child tenderly on the left arm, pressing it to
  her bosom; her wondrously beautiful face was yet paler in the agitation of
  the moment; in the right hand she carried a flat silver vessel, filled with
  red wine.</p>

  <p>"I bid you welcome, O strangers, as our guests, at the hearth of my
  husband. He is absent. I am quite alone in the house. Protect me and my
  child."</p>

  <p>Liuthari found no words; with wide-opened eyes and a beating heart he
  looked at the beautiful woman before him.</p>

  <p>But old Haduwalt, stepping to his side, saw with anxiety this look of his
  young master. He spoke with great seriousness:</p>

  <p>"Be of good cheer and rest assured, Roman matron. I swear to thee by the
  renown of the honour of King Liutbert and of his son Liuthari, who stands
  here and is strangely silent, I will protect thee as if thou wert my own
  daughter, and he shall honour thee as if thou wert his sister. Now drink,
  Liuthari, what is so hospitably offered thee," cried he, turning and taking
  the spear from Liuthari's hand, who still stood as if entranced.</p>

  <p>The young man took the bowl, put it to his mouth, sipped the wine and gave
  it back, without moving his eyes from her face.</p>

  <p>"What is thy name?" asked he with a faint, trembling voice.</p>

  <p>"Felicitas."</p>

  <p>He quickly stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"Happiness! Sälde! that is thy <i>name</i>: that <i>art</i> thou."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand thee."</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary," muttered Haduwalt. "Give me also something to
  drink."</p>

  <p>He took the bowl from her and emptied it at a draught.</p>

  <p>"Truly," continued he, "the wonderful wishing-god seems to live here; how
  else couldst thou have come directly towards us, towards my thirst, with a
  bowl of wine?"</p>

  <p>"I saw you coming, startled by the crashing of the stone slabs; Philemon,
  our old gray-headed slave, built them up. How could he protect me, the lame,
  half-blind old man?"</p>

  <p>"And didst thou imagine thyself protected by a heap of stones, without
  defenders?"</p>

  <p>"No, indeed! I know that I am protected by the good God in heaven, and by
  my protecting angel. But, when I sent out the old man (the second time) to
  look for my husband,&mdash;he did not wish to leave me alone, and I was
  obliged repeatedly to bid him go:&mdash;he thought I should be in some
  measure hidden if he blocked up the entrance."</p>

  <p>Following the example of the hostess, Liuthari sat down. "Thy husband!"
  said he, with knitted brows. "He has forsaken thee?&mdash;in this
  danger?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," answered the young wife, "Yesterday evening, before, there was
  any appearance of danger, he went into the town, since then he has not
  returned, a few hours ago he was still living and active. Philemon saw him in
  the street as he was going with spear and shield towards the bridge across
  the Ivarus."</p>

  <p>"Comfort thyself," interposed the old soldier cheerfully; "very few on thy
  side fell in the battle down there."</p>

  <p>"I know certainly that he is alive. If otherwise, do you think you would
  see me so calm? The gracious God in heaven cannot allow that the best, the
  most excellent man on this earth, should meet, with undeserved suffering. I
  trust firmly in God and am comforted."</p>

  <p>Haduwalt thought to himself: "I have already seen many an innocent brave
  man fall;" but he reserved this wisdom of experience and answered:
  "Certainly! he is at most taken prisoner. And, if so, be of good cheer. The
  powerful son of our king here," continued he, with a significant look at
  Liuthari, "will beg for this prisoner and release him as a reward for thy
  hospitality."</p>

  <p>Liuthari drew a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been married?"</p>

  <p>"It is now eleven months."</p>

  <p>"Eleven months&mdash;of perfect happiness!" said Liuthari slowly.</p>

  <p>"Yes: of unspeakable happiness! Since thou understandest it&mdash;art thou
  also married?"</p>

  <p>"I! No! But I&mdash;I can imagine it."</p>

  <p>Frankly and peacefully Felicitas returned the wondering look that rested
  reverentially upon her. She felt that he marvelled at her beauty; but it did
  not disturb her&mdash;his look was pure. The contrast made her involuntarily
  think of the disquieting flame in the black eyes of the Tribune, which had so
  often alarmed her. But she could look with pleasure on this noble, serious
  countenance, into these deeply-penetrating gray eyes.</p>

  <p>She now rose slowly.</p>

  <p>"I have always," said she, with a smile which made her look still more
  charming, "been very much alarmed at&mdash;at&mdash;at you, whom we call
  'Barbarians.' And how terrified I was at hearing the stones falling one over
  the other! I anxiously looked out. But when I saw how carefully you came up
  the narrow way, did not trample down the flowers, when even he in the white
  mantle carefully raised a rose-bush that had fallen on the gravel path, then
  I said to my little son on my arm: 'Fear not, thou apple of mine eye,
  <i>they</i> will do us no harm.' And I fearlessly filled the wine-cup. And
  now that I have looked into your kind eyes, now I feel myself perfectly safe
  just because you are both here. And I know certainly you will bring me my
  husband to-morrow morning. I will go and place the child there in our
  sleeping-room."</p>

  <p>She pointed with the finger to a small doorway in the centre, before which
  hung a red woollen curtain. "Then I will bring the provisions I have in the
  house."</p>

  <p>"Do not forget the wine," called out Haduwalt.</p>

  <p>As she glided away like a softly rustling wave, Liuthari sprang up
  impetuously.</p>

  <p>"Stay, oh, stay!" cried he hastily, following her a step or two.</p>

  <p>But Haduwalt held him firmly by the mantle.</p>

  <p>"She did not hear it; thanks be to the gods."</p>

  <p>Liuthari violently set himself free.</p>

  <p>"She <i>must</i> hear that I"&mdash;&mdash;Then he calmed himself, and
  pressed his right hand to his brow.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;now&mdash;now&mdash;<i>now!</i>" said the old man slowly, with
  long pauses. "Has young Liuthari now for the first time seen the thing called
  woman, who, instead of a man's breastplate, carries a child at her breast? I
  truly feared that the Runic spell had quite bewitched thee; for in the wine
  there was no magic. <i>I</i> feel nothing peculiar in <i>me</i>. The
  witchcraft began as soon as thou didst see that white face. What? thou wilt
  follow her? Halt there! How vexed I am that I have forgotten all the furious,
  loud-sounding, bad names with which Hadumar, my father, scolded me when he
  caught me as I was climbing into the neighbour's garden to steal the sweet
  pears that the Romans had grafted on to the wild pears of the Illara forest.
  He thrashed me soundly; but the caressing words have escaped me&mdash;it is
  so long ago. 'Thou pilferer! thou pear-stealer! thou sluggard! thou sneak!'
  These were some of the most tender. And now I could use them all admirably.
  Why starest thou thus speechless, senseless, after another man's wife? Is it
  such behaviour that the Lady Lindgardis, thy glorious mother, has taught
  thee? Dost thou not remember Adalagardis, thy bride?"</p>

  <p>"Old giant! blustering, growling bear! that is enough of thine abuse; I
  have had quite enough of it. Adalagardis my bride? She is but a name&mdash;a
  wish of my father. Can I embrace, and clasp, and kiss a name? But this woman
  is living flesh and blood. I felt the sweet warmth of her arm as I touched
  it. Heat flashed through me. She is so beautiful&mdash;so wonderfully,
  enchantingly beautiful! It is an elfin beauty. No, no; words cannot express
  it. The goddesses of Walhalla are not so beautiful as she. Where have I seen
  her equal?" continued he dreamily. "It was, I think, under a warmer, fairer
  sky! Ah, yes; now I see it clearly. In the service of the Emperor, I was
  sailing from Byzantium through the blue Grecian seas. There, on an island
  covered with myrtle and laurel, stood the white form of a Grecian goddess. I
  was affected then almost as much as now by this woman." He was silent and
  laid his hand on his beating heart.</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to say against it, Liuthari, if thou admirest her as thou
  wouldst a stone statue; even if thy taste does go so far astray. Mine seeks
  something different. Commend me to Adala&mdash;yes, I will be silent! But
  this small-waisted little one, straight as an arrow, and not much taller,
  with her thin child's arms, she looks so fragile that she would certainly be
  crushed the first time thou didst heartily touch her."</p>

  <p>"What can the bear know about touching the harp-strings?" said Liuthari
  roughly.</p>

  <p>"It may well be, O son of my king, that I do not understand much about
  dolls made in white Grecian stone-work, for the amusement of boys. But this I
  know, it is much more like the son of the lady Lindgardis, to put other men's
  wives out of his burning thoughts. If thou hadst known each other
  <i>before</i>, and thou now didst find her in the power of another, and she
  still cared for thee secretly in her heart, then I might say, Use the
  superior strength with which Wotan has gifted thee. But
  thus&mdash;&mdash;Here she comes again, innocent, unsuspecting, trustful! She
  builds on <i>thy</i> protection, the dear child. I cannot feel vexed with
  her, because she is so harmless and innocent. I say to thee, if thou, either
  by look or word, dost disturb her peace, I shall take care that father and
  mother give thee a very bad reception when thou dost return home after this
  expedition, and dost wish to sit at the honourable hearth of the lady thy
  mother."</p>

  <p>But Liuthari was now quite angry.</p>

  <p>"Very much I shall fear thy chattering! And the lady Lindgardis's rod does
  not any longer reach to <i>my</i> back. What art thou chattering about there,
  thou senseless being? As a conqueror I stand in this house; it is all mine;
  all that I wish for; the house and the mistress. Her husband is dead, or an
  imprisoned thrall; she herself widow, or my servant as soon as I call her
  so."</p>

  <p>"Thy thoughts are very nicely occupied with thy Grecian goddess! Wert thou
  now <i>my</i> boy, instead of my king's, very quickly, but not quietly,
  wouldst thou flee from this house. But I will watch&mdash;I, Haduwalt, heir
  of Hadamar&mdash;that a son of the king of the Alemanni does not trespass
  like a honey-stealing boy."</p>

  <p>The hostess then appeared, placed on the table a prettily-woven basket,
  full of white, fragrant bread, then butter, fresh goat's cheese, and a
  ham.</p>

  <p>"Directly, directly!" answered she to the silent question of Haduwalt's
  thirsty eyes, and appeared again immediately, bearing on her head an immense
  amphora full of wine.</p>

  <p>Demeanour and movements were full of grace: the left arm resting on her
  hip, the right raised to the handle of the pitcher, perfectly upright,
  advancing slowly because of the heavy burden, thus she stepped across the
  threshold.</p>

  <p>Liuthari sprang up hastily to take the burden from her. But Haduwalt held
  his arm. "Let her alone, my son! <i>Alone</i> she certainly will not spill
  the wine; what might happen if thou didst help, I should not like to
  see."</p>

  <p>Liuthari drew a deep breath; he unbuckled the heavy armour and laid it
  aside, as also the large Roman helmet from his burning head. He mechanically
  took the food; but he ate very little, and did not take his eyes from her
  beautiful face.</p>

  <p>But soon Felicitas rose from the repast. "I am very tired," said she.
  "Since Fulvius left I have not slept, I must now go to our child; if I hear
  his gentle breathing I am quite composed. I will bring you pillows and
  coverlets; you must be contented here; we have no other room worthy of such
  guests."</p>

  <p>"Never mind, as far as I am concerned," cried Liuthari, springing up. "I
  cannot sleep; or I can sleep in the garden, on the soft turf, my head resting
  on my shield. Come with me, old man."</p>

  <p>"No, I should rather sleep <i>here</i>, exactly here," replied he, slily
  smiling to himself. "But my wolf's skin is sufficient, friendly hostess. Thou
  hast shut the back-door, which, as thou saidst, led from the garden into thy
  sleeping-room?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; Philemon will not return from the town before morning."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not earlier. The gates will be shut at night-fall. I shall lie
  here quite comfortably, seest thou, here on the threshold, before the curtain
  which closes thy room. Sleep well and be quite at rest," cried he to her
  through the curtain, as she was putting away the provisions. "Not even a
  little mouse could reach thee without waking me. Seest thou, I fill the whole
  width of the entrance, thus! Now the wine-pitcher near me. Hurrah! it is
  again quite full! And very excellent the old wine tastes. Thy husband is a
  connoisseur therein. I shall drink it all. I shall not sleep. Oh no!"</p>

  <p>"Rest well, ye guests," said she, and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Liuthari threw a peculiar, scornful look on the old soldier cowering in
  the doorway, and on the immense pitcher of wine at his side. Then he sprang
  laughing down the steps into the garden.</p>

  <p>"What?" said he to himself, half-pleased and half-defiant, "the growling
  bear thinks to keep me back if I am determined to step across that threshold?
  <i>He</i> keep guard! Before he has drunk half the heavy wine he will snore
  like Thor in the hall of the giants. I might, perhaps, have given it up; but
  now that he presumes to coerce me&mdash;well! what I will do when I stand
  before the glorious sleeper&mdash;I know not yet; but to her couch I will go,
  in spite of his upbraidings."</p>

  <p>The ardent emotion of the youth relieved itself in his defiant anger
  against his old friend, who looked after him with blinking eyes.</p>

  <p>When the quick steps sounded in the far distance, he called gently:</p>

  <p>"Young woman!"</p>

  <p>"What wilt thou, then?"</p>

  <p>"Hast thou not a ball of thread in the house?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly; here is one."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Give me the end through the curtain. So! Dost thou see? I will
  fasten the thread here at my sword-belt. And thou&mdash;thou take the ball in
  thy hand and hold it firmly during sleep. Dost thou understand? And if thou
  shouldst have any bad dreams, pull quickly."</p>

  <p>"Why so? I can call thee."</p>

  <p>"You had better not trust to that," said the old man, rubbing his tired
  eyes. "They say if I once get into a wine sleep, the battle-cry of all the
  Alemanni would not wake me; but if pulled by the girdle I notice it directly.
  Then I shall awake, if by chance I might have gone to sleep, and will spring
  to thy help."</p>

  <p>"As thou wilt, but it is unnecessary; thy companion keeps watch there in
  the garden."</p>

  <p>"Oh, do not believe that! he is as sleepy as a marmot, on him there is no
  reliance, therefore, hold the ball fast, and now goodnight, sweet creature. I
  am pleased with her myself," muttered he. "Very much she pleases me. But I
  must speak against her to the boy. He has never yet caressed the cheek of any
  woman but his mother, and he is overflowing with passion and strength, like a
  noble young stag; and now he meets this tender white doe! Shame! if her
  unsuspecting soul suffered even a little fright. I must protect
  <i>her</i>&mdash;and <i>him</i>. One more draught, and then: Haduwalt,
  fasting and watchful."</p>

  <p>Dimly shone the little lamp in the sleeping-room, only a faint gleam
  penetrated the red curtain.</p>

  <p>In the front room the lamp went out.</p>

  <p>Stillness reigned over the whole house, one heard only from the garden the
  lulling murmur of the spring.</p>

  <p>From the inner room the old man soon heard the deep, regular respirations
  of the sleeping young wife. Haduwalt counted them. He counted bravely up to a
  hundred. He then laid his hand, groping uncertainly, on the thread at his
  girdle. "All right," thought he; "and I shall not sleep. Certainly not!
  Hundred and one!"</p>

  <p>Then he counted no more.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">Over the silent garden lay the enchantment of a warm,
  glorious summer night.</p>

  <p>The innumerable stars shone magnificently in the cloudless heavens. And
  now in the east, above the walls of Juvavum, which had till now hidden her
  from view, rose the full moon, pouring forth a flood of glory, showing in her
  fantastic light, so bright and yet so different from day, the white house,
  the dark bushes, and the tall trees.</p>

  <p>Numerous night-loving flowers in the gardens of the villas, and in the
  meadows around, whose cups were closed by day, now opened and exhaled their
  scent into the soft air.</p>

  <p>The young German traversed the garden with agitated steps.</p>

  <p>In the rose-bushes of the neighbouring gardens sang the nightingale, so
  loud, so quavering, so ardent, so impassioned, Liuthari would rather not have
  heard it; and yet he could not help listening to the fervid tones.</p>

  <p>The night wind played in his flowing locks, for, besides the breast-plate,
  he had also left his helmet in the room, only taking with him his spear,
  which served as a staff, and the round shield, on which to lay his head, if
  he wished to rest.</p>

  <p>But he found no rest.</p>

  <p>With strong determination he went away from the house, which so powerfully
  attracted him, towards the entrance where the stone slabs lay about in
  confusion. As the store of stones had not been sufficient to fill up the
  entrance, the old slave had with the pick-axe taken up two slabs from the
  threshold, one of which bore the inscription. On this heap of stones Liuthari
  now sat in a deep reverie, just within the entrance, and looked at the stars
  and the soft light of the moon. He forced himself to think of his parents at
  home, of the past day and its victory, of the daughter of Agilolf with the
  fine-sounding name&mdash;what might she be like?</p>

  <p>All! it was of no use; he only deceived himself: through all the pictures
  of his thoughts, pushing them aside, so that they melted away as mist,
  appeared that noble, pale face, the rhythmic symmetry of that figure.</p>

  <p>"Felicitas!" breathed he lightly to himself.</p>

  <p>Long, long sat he thus.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the nightingale was silent.</p>

  <p>Liuthari was quickly awakened out of his thoughts and dreams: in hot
  haste, their iron hoofs resounding on the hard pavement of the road, several
  horses came galloping from Juvavum; the practised ear of the German clearly
  distinguished two, perhaps three horses.</p>

  <p>The young man sprang up, and seized the spear which was lying near
  him.</p>

  <p>"Those are not Alemannian horsemen," said he. "Who else can it
  be?&mdash;Fugitive Romans? or even&mdash;her husband?"</p>

  <p>He stepped behind the pier of the entrance to the right, where his form
  and also his shadow was hidden, while the moonlight revealed clearly to him
  the road and the footpath which led to the villa.</p>

  <p>The hoof-strokes were now silent.</p>

  <p>The watcher plainly saw how, at the turn o£ the footpath, three riders
  sprang from their horses, and fastened them to a milestone.</p>

  <p>The one, the tallest, wore a Roman helm, with a dark flowing plume, the
  two others the close-fitting headgear of the Moorish cavalry; their white
  mantles floated in the night wind.</p>

  <p>"That is scarcely her husband, and those are not slaves of this villa. And
  yet they are coming here. What may they be seeking? Shall I call Haduwalt?
  Bah! King Liutbert's son has often already stood against three enemies at
  once."</p>

  <p>At this moment the one in the helmet reached the entrance.</p>

  <p>"Wait here," he commanded, raising his short spear, "I alone will fetch
  the woman; if I need you, I will call. But I think"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Halt! stand, Roman!" cried Liuthari, with levelled spear, springing into
  the gateway in the full moonlight. "What seek you here?"</p>

  <p>"A German! Down with him!" cried the three voices at once. But at the same
  moment the leader stumbled two steps backwards, struck on the breast by the
  spear of Liuthari.</p>

  <p>If the armour-factory of Lorch had not supplied such excellent work, the
  point would have gone through and through the man. But it rebounded
  and&mdash;broke.</p>

  <p>The German angrily dropped the now useless shaft.</p>

  <p>"By Tartarus, that was a murderous blow!" cried Leo fiercely. "Prudence is
  necessary. Raise the spears; we will throw together."</p>

  <p>The three lances flew at once&mdash;all three the Alemannian stopped with
  his shield. One, hurled with especial momentum and fury, penetrated the
  threefold ox-hide and ash-wood of the shield, and wounded his arm near the
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>The young man, full of strength, hardly felt the slight wound; but the
  shield, encumbered with three spear-shafts, he could no longer dexterously
  use.</p>

  <p>"Haduwalt!" cried he now with a loud voice, "Waffenâ! Feindô! Help!"</p>

  <p>At the same time he seized one of the lances in his shield, tore it out,
  and threw. The Moor at the right of the Tribune cried out and fell dead to
  the ground.</p>

  <p>"I will throw him down; thou, sir, stab him!" cried the other. It was
  Himilco, the centurion.</p>

  <p>"With the leap of the panther of his native deserts, he now sprang at the
  throat of the German; but, quick as lightning, Liuthari had drawn the short
  knife from his shoulder-belt. He thrust it into the brow between the eyes of
  his assailant. The brown, muscular arms which had seized the German's two
  shoulders as with the claws o£ a beast of prey, loosened; without a sound the
  African fell backwards. But Liuthari had not time to draw out the deeply
  imbedded dagger-blade.</p>

  <p>"Haduwalt! Help!" cried he loudly.</p>

  <p>For already the third enemy, a most formidable opponent, had rushed upon
  him.</p>

  <p>With a powerful sword-stroke he cleaved Liuthari's shield so that it split
  into two halves, and, with the clinging spears, fell right and left from his
  arm.</p>

  <p>And the Roman had, at the same time, stuck the sharp iron spike in the
  centre of his convex shield, deep into the naked right arm of the king's son:
  the blood spurted out. He recoiled several steps from the weight of the blow,
  nearly stumbling over the stone slabs.</p>

  <p>The furious enemy, well armed both for defence and offence, now stepped
  victoriously into the entrance, pushing aside with his foot the two halves of
  the shield, that his adversary should not draw out the spears.</p>

  <p>With a keen look the Roman measured his adversary, who now drew his last
  weapon, the short-handled battle-axe, from his girdle, and raised it to
  strike. The towering stature of the young German must have seemed fearful to
  the Roman, in spite of the superiority of his arms.</p>

  <p>"Why should we tear each other to pieces, barbarian? Why dost thou protect
  this house so grimly? I will not contest it with thee; I will leave it to
  thee as soon as I have taken out one single thing."</p>

  <p>"What thing? something belonging to thee? Thou art not the master of the
  house."</p>

  <p>"I will leave thee the house. I come only for&mdash;a woman."</p>

  <p>"<i>Thy</i> wife? Felicitas? No! she is not thine"</p>

  <p>Furiously the other cried: "What? Thou art already so intimate in the
  house! But neither is Felicitas <i>thy</i> wife; and shall not become so.
  Felicitas shall be <i>mine</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Never!" cried Liuthari, and he sprang forward and dashed his stone
  battle-axe against the magnificent bronze helmet, so that it split asunder
  where the plume was attached, and fell in pieces from the head of the
  wearer.</p>

  <p>But alas! that head remained uninjured, while the axe, descending with
  such force on the metal, broke off at the handle. For a moment the Tribune
  stood as if stupefied by the blow. But he saw immediately how his opponent,
  now quite defenceless, did not turn his face for flight, but still stood
  before him.</p>

  <p>With a wild, yelling, tiger-like shriek, in which thirst for blood and joy
  of revenge sounded harshly together, he let his shield slip down, raised the
  short, broad Roman sword for a blow, and with the cry, "Felicitas is mine!"
  sprang on the German.</p>

  <p>At that first outcry, Liuthari quickly bent forward, slightly raising the
  heel of his left foot, and seized one of the marble slabs lying before him;
  and now, first swinging it high above his head, with the cry "Felicitas!" he
  hurled it with a good aim against the helmetless forehead of the Tribune, as
  he sprang towards him.</p>

  <p>Hoarsely groaning, clashing in his armour, the assailant fell backwards;
  the sword escaped from his hand.</p>

  <p>Already Liuthari knelt on his breast, seized the blade, and raised it to
  force it into his throat.</p>

  <p>But he breathed no more&mdash;he was dead. Liuthari rising, threw the
  sword aside, and looked proudly on the three slain enemies.</p>

  <p>"For Felicitas!" said he. "Now to her. I think&mdash;I have deserved
  it."</p>

  <p>He knelt down by the running stream, washed the smarting, still bleeding
  wound of his right arm, tore some broad strips from the linen mantle of the
  dead centurion, bound them firmly around the wound, and then trod with a
  light, elastic step the long path through the garden, back to the house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

  <p class="first">Having reached it he pushed carefully aside the yellow
  curtain of the outer door, letting the moonlight fall into the dark room.</p>

  <p>At the entrance to the sleeping-room, before its red curtain, lay
  Haduwalt, snoring; by him, lying on its side, empty, was the amphora.
  Lightly, on tip-toe and with a beating heart, the young man advanced and
  cautiously divided the two halves of the red curtain. He then perceived, with
  a smile, the cunning arrangement of the thread; it was still fastened to the
  leathern belt of the guard; but the hand of the sleeper had opened; the ball
  lay on a stool by her couch. With a wide stride Liuthari stepped across the
  old man into the sleeping-room.</p>

  <p>Above the head of the bed, in a niche in the wall, stood the little
  earthen lamp; it threw its mild light over the pillow. By its red glimmer, he
  perceived the infant near the bed of the mother in a wicker cradle.</p>

  <p>The beautiful sleeper had loosened her abundant light-brown hair; it
  flowed over her naked shoulders and splendidly curved, though delicate bosom,
  from which the woollen covering had half slipped.</p>

  <p>The dazzlingly white left arm she had placed behind her head and neck; the
  right hand covered, as if protecting, the left breast. The intruder stepped
  quite close. So ravishingly beautiful he had not seen her, when awake; and
  the serious eyes now closed no longer maintained a strict watch.</p>

  <p>The full lips were half opened; he inhaled the sweet breath of her mouth.
  The young man trembled from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"Only one kiss," thought he, "and it shall not awake her."</p>

  <p>He was already bending softly over her face. The beautiful lips then
  moved, and in her sleep she said tenderly:</p>

  <p>"Come, O my Fulvius; kiss me!"</p>

  <p>With the speed of lightning, Liuthari turned, sprang lightly across
  Haduwalt on the threshold, then down the steps into the garden, clasped his
  two hands before his eyes, and murmured:</p>

  <p>"Oh, what wickedness might I not have done!"</p>

  <p>He fell on his knees, and hid his feverish head in the dewy grass.
  Repentance, pain, unstilled longing, surged together within him, and were at
  length dissolved in a salutary stream of tears. Long lay he thus. At last the
  youth of the exhausted, wounded man asserted itself beneficially; he sank
  into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

  <p class="first">When the next morning the summer sun rose magnificently over
  Juvavum, and the golden oriole began its flute-like song, young Liuthari
  sprang up, a healed and a wiser man.</p>

  <p>The wound in his arm no longer pained, and his imagination, which had been
  much more excited than his heart, was stilled.</p>

  <p>No longer dissatisfied with himself, joyful and composed, he first cooled
  his face in the spring, and then, carefully hiding the wounded arm under his
  mantle, he walked up the steps into the outer room. Haduwalt, yawning and
  stretching up both his arms, received him with the words:</p>

  <p>"But thou hast long slept. And I&mdash;I think I have not closed my eyes
  the whole night."</p>

  <p>"But perhaps the ears!" laughed Liuthari. "Where is the mistress? I am
  hungry."</p>

  <p>"Here am I," cried Felicitas. "I will bring you directly fresh-laid eggs,
  and milk, and honey. Philemon is now milking the cow in the meadow behind the
  house."</p>

  <p>"Only think," said she, now stepping from behind the curtain and offering
  a hand to each guest: "very early, as soon as the gates were again opened,
  the old slave came back from the town by the meadow-path, and awoke me
  knocking at the outer door. I had slept so firmly."</p>

  <p>"And very sweetly dreamt?" said Liuthari, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;as always, <i>if</i> I dream: of Fulvius. Certainly Philemon
  has not found his master; but still I am of good cheer. The good Johannes had
  caused the dead and the wounded to be brought together&mdash;the former in
  front of, and the latter into the church. Philemon carefully inspected them.
  Thanks to the God of heaven, the saints and the good Genii, my Fulvius is not
  among them." And she sat down with her guests.</p>

  <p>Philemon brought an immense jug fall of foaming warm milk. He threw a
  wondering look on the two Germans, whom his mistress had represented to him
  as protectors, not enemies, and he went again to the back of the house.
  Felicitas followed him to fetch the child, which seemed to be waking.</p>

  <p>"Tell me now, grim teacher and armour-master," began Liuthari, "wilt thou
  in thine old age learn woman's handiwork, and the art of using thread? What
  hast thou there trailing at thy girdle?"</p>

  <p>Quite taken aback the old giant looked down at his portly person, and at
  the long, long thread which was entangled about his clumsy feet.</p>

  <p>"That? Oh, that is only something between the mistress and myself. She has
  become so fond of me&mdash;much more so than of thee&mdash;and that I should
  not escape her, she bound me fast to her couch."</p>

  <p>"Thou wouldest complain of me to my mother&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>"Yes; if I had not kept watch, who knows&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>"Now I will accuse <i>thee</i> to thy wife, the strict Grimmtrud, that
  thou didst bind thyself to the couch of a young beauty."</p>

  <p>The young man stooped down, picked up the ball, and put it in his
  vest.</p>

  <p>"I shall keep the thread," continued he gravely, "as a remembrance of the
  hour when Haduwalt slept, the thread lay loose on the ground, but Liuthari
  watched&mdash;for three."</p>

  <p>Felicitas after a while again came in, the child on her arm.</p>

  <p>"The day advances," sighed she, "and I begin to be very anxious. My
  Fulvius, where mayest thou be?"</p>

  <p>"Here I am," cried a joyous, clear voice, and the longed-for husband
  rushed in through the open doorway.</p>

  <p>With a cry of happiness Felicitas sprang up. He folded mother and child
  tenderly in his arms.</p>

  <p>Liuthari rose. He looked at them without pain, and regarded the husband
  with a frank, happy look, who, however, astonished, drew back a step, and
  measured the handsome young man with his eyes. Hot fear flashed through him
  in an instant; but the alarm disappeared, fleeing like a cloud-shadow, when
  he looked into His wife's face, so peaceful, so radiantly happy.</p>

  <p>"What has happened to me, my darling? The day before yesterday shut up in
  the debtor's tower, early yesterday set free by Severus, taken by him to the
  battle&mdash;we were defeated&mdash;I fled, was pursued, fell into the river,
  was carried away by the stream&mdash;half stupefied I at last reached the
  bank&mdash;was taken prisoner by other horsemen, led into the town, and this
  morning&mdash;saved by a miracle of the Lord or the holy Saint Peter, I know
  not which."</p>

  <p>"A miracle! Oh, thank the mercy of the God of heaven! He heard my prayer!
  But what miracle?"</p>

  <p>"Johannes, who never wearies in the care of his people, had already
  yesterday evening besought the barbarian Duke to release all the citizens of
  Juvavum who were prisoners of war. The powerful prince answered that he would
  willingly set free all that fell to his share of the booty, but those that
  fell to his warriors he had not the power to release, only to
  redeem&mdash;quite a different law prevails with the Germans than with
  us&mdash;and he could not exhaust his treasure to do that. So last night many
  of us were set at liberty, but the larger proportion, and amongst them
  myself, remained in bondage. Then in the early morning Johannes appeared
  again in the Capitol, where the Duke had fixed his abode, and&mdash;redeemed
  us all! Thou art astonished. Thou mayest well ask whence the man, who
  possesses nothing but his robe and staff, procured so much money! Yes, that
  is the miracle! When, sad at the fate of the prisoners, he returned to his
  Basilica, he found, in an old vault under the church-floor, a bag full of
  gold pieces, and also a little purse of precious stones, abundantly
  sufficient to ransom us all. But whence came this treasure? Nobody knows. The
  angel of the Lord manifestly heard the prayer of Johannes, and brought the
  treasure. The whole of Juvavum is amazed at the miracle. And I vow to thee,
  thou godly one, I will henceforth listen more devoutly to the words of
  Johannes. But thee, my beloved! what alarm has threatened thee!"</p>

  <p>"But has not reached me, thanks be to God, and also to our guests; and
  perhaps," added she smiling, "to the inscription on the entrance-slab, that
  kept back misfortune."</p>

  <p>"Dost thou know <i>who</i> wished to step across it?"</p>

  <p>"How should I? I have not left the house."</p>

  <p>"Then thou hast no idea how truly thou didst speak! Listen and breathe
  again. As I just now was hastening here from the town, on approaching the
  hill, I saw fastened to the milestone three horses, and among them&mdash;I
  know him too well&mdash;the black steed of the Tribune! Full of alarm, I
  sprang to our gate; there lay&mdash;oh, horrible!&mdash;two slain Moors, and,
  directly across the threshold, stretched on his back, the terrible Tribune,
  with a shattered skull! His face was half covered with the inscription-slab,
  and the corner-piece, broken off, was deeply embedded in his skull.
  <i>This</i> stone has felled him who was never conquered. But what arm hurled
  it?"</p>

  <p>The old Haduwalt, who at the first mention of conflict had instinctively
  looked into the averted face of his young master, now drew the white mantle
  from his shoulder, showed the bloody bandage, and said: "This arm&mdash;And
  I!&mdash;Oh, Liuthari, my darling!&mdash;I meanwhile lay and slept!"</p>

  <p>"Tolerably firmly," said the young man smiling, and continued, turning to
  the master of the house: "Yes, I slew him, that very bold man; he wished to
  force his way in, and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Steal Felicitas!" cried the husband, pressing his wife, now terribly
  alarmed, to his breast. "Oh, sir, how can we thank thee?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>But Felicitas could not utter a word; she could only direct her eyes,
  swimming in tears, towards her preserver. She had not appeared so beautiful
  even in the night.</p>

  <p>"Thanks!" laughed Liuthari, "I fought for my life. But listen! who comes
  here?"</p>

  <p>The steps of armed men were heard in the garden, and there entered,
  accompanied by five followers, Garibrand the Duke.</p>

  <p>"A good piece of work have you two done out there before the entrance. The
  Tribune, whom we have sought everywhere, he fell certainly by thy hand. I
  have found thee at last, young hero! Welcome news I bring thee. A messenger
  from thy father is seeking thee. The Roman fortress on the Regan stream has
  fallen. My cousin, Duke Agilolf, and thy father, have settled the betrothal:
  Agilolf invites thee to his halls. Adalagardis, the most beautiful princely
  daughter of the Germans, is awaiting thee."</p>

  <p>"Hail to thee, thou son of my king! this is thy reward for this night,"
  cried Haduwalt.</p>

  <p>"Betrothal! I have never seen her!" cried Liuthari, hesitating.</p>

  <p>"Betrothal! yes, if you please each other," said the Duke.</p>

  <p>"<i>He</i> will certainly please <i>her</i>." said Haduwalt, clapping the
  blushing youth on the shoulder; "and I hope," whispered he quietly in his
  ear, "that <i>she</i>, the beauty whom thou <i>mayest</i> love, will right
  well please <i>thee</i>."</p>

  <p>"Choose now," continued the Duke, "what thou wilt of the booty. To you
  Alemanni, to thee above all, do we owe the victory."</p>

  <p>"I will follow thee," said Liuthari, rising hastily. "Help me, old
  friend!"</p>

  <p>The armour-master helped him to buckle on his breastplate; the young man
  raised the beautifully-shaped Roman helmet with the towering heron's plume to
  his head. Magnificent stood the king's son, his joyful countenance radiant
  with the noblest sentiments.</p>

  <p>"Oh, now all is well," rejoiced Fulvius. "The Tribune is slain; Zeno the
  usurer is dead, murdered by an unknown hand, without doubt by his slaves, so
  Johannes tells me. There is no longer an Emperor in Ravenna; we were assured
  of this yesterday morning by this young hero. Now am I free from all debts to
  the Fiscus."</p>

  <p>"And no less do I assure thee," laughed Liuthari, "that this powerful Duke
  here has stepped into the Emperor's place&mdash;<i>his</i> debtor art thou
  now."</p>

  <p>Fulvius anxiously put his hand to his right ear, and looked dismayed at
  the mighty man.</p>

  <p>"Fear not," continued Liuthari. "I ask, Duke Garibrand, as a part of my
  share of the booty, this villa and the land belonging to it. And free from
  all debt."</p>

  <p>"It shall be as thou hast said," answered the Bajuvaren.</p>

  <p>"And to you both, Fulvius and Felicitas, I give this free property, before
  these seven free men as witnesses. Their oath will be of service to you if
  anyone should contest your right and warrant."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, sir; thanks."</p>

  <p>"Thou art, then, Fulvius the stone-mason?" interposed the Duke. "The
  priest Johannes commended thee to me as faithful and brave; if thou dost
  prove thyself so, I will place thee as steward over my lands outside this
  gate."</p>

  <p>Felicitas, after a short whispering with her husband, now stepped towards
  Liuthari, with the child on her arm. She blushed faintly, and said:</p>

  <p>"Sir, he who gives so much as thou&mdash;must give still more. Our little
  son has not yet a name. Next Sunday I shall take him to Johannes, to the
  font. How shall the boy be named?"</p>

  <p>"Felix Fulvius," said the king's son, deeply moved, laying his hand on the
  tiny head, "and&mdash;<i>Liuthari</i>, in order that my name may yet strike
  many times on your ear. But he who gives a name, gives also a
  present&mdash;that is German custom. Here, young housewife, take this ring. I
  stripped it from the finger of a patrician some years ago, whom I slew in
  battle. In Augusta Vindelicorum the dealers say it is worth as much as half
  their town. That is a bit of treasure in case of need. And now, both of you,
  farewell!"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" here cried Haduwalt; "we do not thus bid farewell&mdash;farewell
  for life! Thou didst ask, stone-mason, how thou couldst thank the hero. Let
  thy young wife give him one kiss; believe me, he has deserved it&mdash;he is
  a gallant youth!"</p>

  <p>Fulvius led his blushing wife towards him.</p>

  <p>Liuthari pressed a kiss on the white brow, and cried: "Farewell, thou
  lovely one, for ever!"</p>

  <p>And already he was gone: the curtain rustled behind him. The other Germans
  followed; at the garden entrance they mounted their horses and galloped
  quickly back towards the Porta Vindelica.</p>

  <p>The first thing that Fulvius did, after he had with Philemon removed the
  dead bodies, was carefully to reset the stone with the inscription, into the
  pavement of the entrance; the broken-off corner he left unset.</p>

  <p>"It shall," said he, "for ever be to us a proof how effectual the adage
  has been."</p>

  <p>And the adage, it proved itself true to the wedded pair through their
  whole life.</p>

  <p>No misfortune crossed that threshold while they dwelt there. Blooming sons
  and daughters grew up after Felix Fulvius Liuthari. Sickness never befell
  them, parents or children, although the pestilence might be raging in Juvavum
  and in the villas round about.</p>

  <p>The Ivarus often overflowed, spreading its waves and destruction over men,
  animals, horses, and grain. Before this gate, before the Mercurius Hill, it
  each time stopped.</p>

  <p>A landslip overwhelmed the neighbours' gardens right and left. An immense
  piece of rock rebounded from the inscription stone, and was shattered into a
  thousand fragments. Fulvius became "Villicus" of all the ducal property in
  Juvavum, and stood, on account of his prudence and fidelity, high in the
  favour of Duke Garibrand.</p>

  <p>When he and Felicitas had become quite old people, fully eighty years of
  age, but active and vigorous, they were sitting one June evening hand in hand
  in the garden. They had had a seat made just within the entrance, so that
  their feet rested on the adage-stone.</p>

  <p>Thus they sat, and thought of past times. Sweetly sang the golden oriole
  in the neighbouring beech forest. But it gradually became silent, for the air
  had become very sultry; a storm was approaching.</p>

  <p>There was a vivid flash of lightning, and a tremendous peal of thunder.
  The children hastened to bring their old parents into the house.</p>

  <p>But when Felix Fulvius Liuthari, hurrying in advance of the others,
  reached them, he found them both dead.</p>

  <p>A flash of lightning had killed them both.</p>

  <p>They still held each other hand in hand, and smiled, as if to say: "Death,
  which comes thus, is no misfortune, but a blessing."</p>
