  <h3>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h3>

  <p class="note">Between 1904 and 1918 Edgar Wallace wrote a large number of
  mostly humorous sketches about life in the British Army relating the
  escapades and adventures of privates Smith (Smithy), Nobby Clark, Spud Murphy
  and their comrades-in-arms. A character called Smithy first appeared in
  articles which Wallace wrote for the <i>Daily Mail</i> as a war correspondent
  in South Africa during the Boer war. (See "Kitchener's The Bloke", "Christmas
  Day On The Veldt", "The Night Of The Drive", "Home Again", and "Back From The
  War&mdash;The Return of Smithy" in the collection <a href=
  "../NonFiction/ReportsFromTheBoerWar.html"><i>Reports From The Boer
  War</i></a>). The Smithy of these articles is presumably the prototype of the
  character in the later stories.</p>

  <p class="note">In his autobiography <i>People</i> Edgar Wallace describes
  the origin of of his first "Smithy" collection as follows: "What was in my
  mind... was to launch forth as a story-writer. I had written one or two short
  stories whilst I was in Cape Town, but they were not of any account. My best
  practice were my 'Smithy' articles in the <i>Daily Mail</i>, and the short
  history of the Russian Tsars (<i>Red Pages from Tsardom</i>, R.G.) which ran
  serially in the same paper. Collecting the 'Smithys', I sought for a
  publisher, but nobody seemed anxious to put his imprint upon my work, and in
  a moment of magnificent optimism I founded a little publishing business,
  which was called 'The Tallis Press.' It occupied one room in Temple Chambers,
  and from here I issued "Smithy" at 1 shilling and sold about 30,000 copies."
  &mdash; R.G.</p>

  <p class="first">"THERE'S ten ways of finishin' the war," said Smithy, "an'
  very likely there's more, only I have only talked it over with ten people.
  There's the celebrated way of bringin' Russians through England, there's the
  idea of takin' Berlin an' destroyin' von Hindenberg's time table, an' last
  but not least&mdash;skippin' all the other suggestions&mdash;there's the plan
  which is in favour in almost everv club in London of destroyin' the German
  Fleet an' landin' an army at Hamburg. Nobby Clark, whom I might describe as
  one of the grandest geniuses that ever came into the army, had a plan which
  hasn't been heard outside of a select circle.</p>

  <p>"'What we ought to do,' he sez, 'is to go up into the Alps to the place
  where the Rhine rises, stick a cork in the spring, an' stop the Rhine from
  runnin'. If there wasn't no Rhine there'd be no watch on the Rhine, an' if
  there wasn't a watch we'd be able to nip across before anybodv saw us.'</p>

  <p>"Another idea of Nobby's was one which I daresay you've heard about. It
  wasn't exactly to stop the war, but, so to speak, to stop the bit of war
  which was operatin' on our front.</p>

  <p>"We held a line of trenches near Y&mdash; or Z&mdash;, an' our main
  difficulty was to persuade the enemy that the trench line was held by about
  90,000 men. In a sense we was in the air, an' even our supports was well in
  advance of where the line should have run.</p>

  <p>"Owin' to the fact that we had a little river on our right, an' a swamp on
  our left, we could take liberties, but the unfortunate fellows of 'D'
  company, who were in the support trenches an' had to bring up supplies an'
  ammunition, got it properly in the neck.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes the enemy was satisfied with snipin', but now an' then,
  especially after nightfall, the parties that came up to the firin' trench
  would be raided from the marsh, an' have all their stores pinched. If they
  got away without bein' pinched themselves or shot a bit, they was very
  lucky.</p>

  <p>"We could never find all the paths across the marsh&mdash;there must have
  been half-a-dozen&mdash;an' no sooner had we laid a trap for the Germans in
  one place than they come up in another.</p>

  <p>"It got a bit annoyin', especially after 'C' company, who had been holdin'
  the firin' trenches, lost a day's rations.</p>

  <p>"'We wouldn't have minded,' says one of the fellows from 'C' bitterly,
  'only the pinchers pinched the box with the jam in it.'</p>

  <p>"'Jam's bad for you,' sez Nobby, 'besides which it's pretty bad for the
  enemy,' he sez. 'You've probably done the army a good turn by losin' it.'</p>

  <p>"A couple of days later, when it was our turn to be in the firin'
  trenches, the same thing happened. The supports comin' up with provisions was
  attacked an' routed, an' the stores taken.</p>

  <p>"'This ain't war,' sez Nobby indignant; 'this is barbarity&mdash;it ain't
  civilised to rob the wounded of their comforts. When I say wounded,' sez
  Nobby carefully, 'I mean heroes who are likely to be wounded at any
  minute.'</p>

  <p>"It was about this time that Nobby got his grand idea for finishin' the
  war. He had a long talk with our company officers when we came back to
  billets, and the captain, who was a bit of a sport, went over to see the
  R.E.C.O. It was Nobby's plan, and Nobby's grand idea all through.</p>

  <p>"They emptied a new packin'-case, and filled it full of all kinds of
  things that the Germans did not want. There were little packets of cordite, a
  box of nitro-glycerine, or somethin' that made the same noise, pieces of old
  iron, and samples of explosives collected far and near by the R.E. officer,
  and the whole was arranged so that when you prised the lid off, somethin'
  would happen which gave you a better idea of an earthquake than anythin'
  which had ever been invented. It was a nice new packin'-case, an' when they
  had nailed it down very carefully they stencilled on it 'Comforts for the
  troops ' and 'Jam for the soldiers,' and Nobby added, what I might term an
  artistic touch, by stickin' on a card, 'From little Minnie Brown, with love
  for all the dear heroes at the Front.'</p>

         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"'That ought to get em, sir,' sez Nobby enthusiastic, and the R.E. officer
  and our company officers were highly delighted.</p>

  <p>"The general idea was that the case should be taken up to the edge of the
  marsh, an' left carelessly near the end of one of the paths which we had
  spotted.</p>

  <p>"All might have gone well if it had not been for the Wigshires. We never
  got on with the Wigshires owin' to a slight disagreement about football some
  years ago.</p>

  <p>"Although since Mons we had met all the horrors of war, we never had the
  bad luck to find ourselves quartered alongside the Wigs. We'd been shelled,
  aeroplanes had dropped bombs on us, we'd had our trenches blown in, we had
  had the roads blown up, we'd had poisoned water, typhoid fever, an' had gone
  without warm food for days together, but we'd never had the crownin'
  misfortune of findin' ourselves side by side with the first battalion of the
  150th (Peakey Blinders) Royal Wigshire Regiment. It is not for me to run down
  chaps in the army, but we know that whenever it has been possible for the
  Wigshires to lose theirselves they've done it. If any convoy takes the wrong
  road an' finds itself in High Street, Germany, you can bet your life it's the
  Wigshires. The only wise thing they ever did was to keep away from the marsh
  road. At least thev tried to.</p>

  <p>"What happened exactly on the fatal 7th of January I've never been able to
  find out. We were at a post halfway between the trench and the billets when
  we saw a lot of the Wigshires comin' back in a hurry.</p>

  <p>"'We've had a terrible fight,' sez one fellow to Nobby, and he was so
  agitated he<br>
  could hardly get the words out; 'attacked, as it were, by overwhelmin'
  forces, like von Kluck attacked French, we made a noble resistance,
  an'&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Tell us your sad story,' sez Nobby, 'without makin' a despatch of it,
  an' me and my gallant friends will be very much obliged.'</p>

  <p>"The long and short of it was that the Wigshires had once more lost their
  supplies.</p>

  <p>"'The wonder to me,' sez Nobby, ' is that you don't lose your bloom in'
  heads!'</p>

  <p>"The matter might have ended here, only the next day some of the Wigshires
  put it about that some of their comforts had been seen in the Ancaster supply
  trenches, an' a deputation of the Wigshires came along to investigate.</p>

  <p>"'It's a very funny thing,' sez one of the Wigshires, a chap named
  Wingsey, 'you chaps have got more fried bacon an' jam than you can eat, an'
  we've got nothin.'</p>

  <p>"'If it amuses you,' sez Nobby, 'me an' the other heroes of the Ancasters
  are very satisfied.'</p>

  <p>"'We don't want to make no accusations,' sez this chap, 'an' we don't want
  to do<br>
  nothing' unpleasant&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'There is two ways out of these trenches,' sez Nobby very cold-like: 'you
  can go over the parapet an' have a talk with the Germans, or you can go back
  the way you came. Another way,' Nobby sez thoughtfully, 'is to wait for the
  ambulance to come an' fetch you.'</p>

  <p>"These little disturbances are always croppin' up. Sometimes you hear talk
  about it in the trenches; sometimes you have to wait till you get back to
  billets before you get any news.</p>

  <p>"We were in billets, the Wigshires havin' relieved us, an' were settlin'
  down to a quiet country life, when a couple of Wigshire chaps drifted into
  our village. They had been sent back with a convoy of sick to the
  collectin'-station, an' by their mysterious hints and their sarcastic manner,
  we knew that somethin' was up.</p>

  <p>"'It is a very curious thing,' sez one of these Wigshire chaps.</p>

  <p>"'You are,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'It is a very curious thing,' this chap went on, 'that our regiment
  should find some of its comforts near your lines.'</p>

  <p>"'Speak plainly, Moses,' sez Nobby. 'You alarm me.'</p>

  <p>"'To rob the poor bloomin' soldier,' the Wigshire chap went on, 'is one of
  the lowest crimes I have ever heard about.'</p>

  <p>"'Hear, hear!' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'We've found one of our boxes of supplies,' sez the chap. 'We found it
  very close to the marsh road, not one hundred yards from your supply
  trenches. There it was lyin' <i>doggo</i> by the side of the road where
  nobody would have thought of lookin' for it.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby jumped to his feet.</p>

  <p>"'Here, he sez, agitated, 'what is this you are talkin' about?'</p>

  <p>"'A packin'-case,' sez the Wigshire man very emphatic&mdash;'a Wigshire
  packin'-case with comforts for the troops sent by a young lady in England
  with her best love. What the Ancasters pinched, and what we found.'</p>

  <p>"'Do you mean to tell me,' sez Nobby, turnin' pale, 'that you found that
  packin'-case by the marsh?'</p>

  <p>"'I do,' sez the other chap, 'an', what's more, I was the fellow that
  found it. To-night, he sez, 'when the fellows are eatin' them
  comforts&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"Nobby didn't wait for any more, but dashed out of the barn an' made his
  way to the little cottage which our officers were usin' as a mess. In three
  minutes the bugles were soundin' to assembly, and 'B' and 'C' companies had
  fallen in.</p>

  <p>"'We had better send as many as we can spare,' I heard the Colonel say to
  the Adjutant. 'We don't know to what part of the trenches this confounded box
  has got!'</p>

  <p>"'Whose idea was it?' sez the Colonel.</p>

  <p>"'Private Clark's of "B" company,' replies the Adjutant.</p>

  <p>"'What a brain that fellow has!' sez the Colonel, but he sez it in a way
  which made Nobby squirm.</p>

  <p>"It was growin' dark, an' the roads underfoot were thick with mud, but we
  marched quicker than we had ever marched before.</p>

  <p>"It was Spud Murphy, Nobby, and me who struck the section of the trench
  where the box was. One of the Wigshires was just puttin' the edge of his
  entrenchin' tool between the lid an' the box when Nobbv fell on him.</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"'Here, what's the game?' said the chap, an' one of the Wigshire officers
  came up.</p>

  <p>"'What is the meanin' of this?' he sez. But before we could answer, the
  sentry at one end of the trench loosed of a round of ammunition and shouted
  'Look out!'</p>

  <p>"It was a bit of luck," Smithy went on, "that we came up in time. A whole
  brigade of German infantry had been pushed forward against the Wigshires'
  front. From 8 till 10.30 the Wigshires and the Ancasters fought side by side
  until the enemy blew up a bit of the trench and the order came to retire.</p>

  <p>"In the support trenches we rallied, drivin' back two fresh attacks, an'
  gradually the firin' died down on our front, an' at 12 o'clock there was
  almost silence.</p>

  <p>"'This is a nice thing,' sez Wingsey, of the Wigshires bitterly. 'They
  have not only got our trenches, but they have got our bloomin' jam!'</p>

  <p>"He had hardly got the words out of his mouth before there came an
  explosion in the trench we had left louder than any other explosion I have
  ever heard.</p>

  <p>"'What is that?' sez our company officer, who was standin' close behind me
  an' Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'That, sir,' sez Nobby proudly, 'is the jam!'"</p>
