  <p class="cp"><i>There is tragedy in this stately story of an Irish feud. But
  at the<br>
  end there is the beauty and the solace of courage and nobility.</i></p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">"THERE'S Lord Maskell's steward been this hour in the
  parlor; shall I send him on his road again?"</p>

  <p>"And what will Lord Maskell's steward be doing here?" was the impatient
  answer.</p>

  <p>"Nothing that's good, my lord. Shall I put him on his road again?"</p>

  <p>The young man to whom this eager question was addressed dismounted from
  his beautiful horse, hesitated, then said: "No, I'll see him."</p>

  <p>The servant, now holding the dark horse's head, protested with a stern
  anxiety:</p>

  <p>"You'll see him? And it's the steward&mdash;the gentleman not coming
  himself?"</p>

  <p>Lord Beltarbet paused on the steps of his decayed mansion. The wind was
  blowing about his hair, the autumn leaves scurried round his feet; it was the
  earliest hour of a lovely, soft twilight.</p>

  <p>"Maybe there's trouble," mused he, smiling wistfully at the servant. "I've
  heard there'll be more risings in County Clare&mdash;maybe in County
  Wicklow."</p>

  <p>"That, my lord," replied the stately servant, with a hard, grim look,
  "will be no affair of Lord Maskell or his steward."</p>

  <p>"They're English," said Beltarbet, with cold bitterness, and he entered
  his ancient, ill-kept house. He flung off his hat in the shabby hall and
  still holding his riding whip behind him, entered the parlor where the
  Englishman waited.</p>

  <p>The Englishman introduced himself&mdash;Mr. Simon Ware, Lord Maskell's
  agent; though his manner was respectful, the little neat man conveyed
  perfectly well that he knew he was one of the conquerors speaking to one of
  the conquered; his very civility had an air of pity.</p>

  <p>To him the dark young man in the worn riding suit was merely a member of a
  despised and defeated race, the descendant of generations of rebels whose
  estates and titles were confiscated, and who was only suffered to retain such
  property and barren honors as he possessed through the charity of the British
  Government.</p>

  <p>Lord Beltarbet had naturally another estimation of himself, and it was one
  that was shared by thousands of his countrymen. Beltarbet should have been
  one of the least of his titles and Fournaughts one of the least of his
  demesnes; he was by right Clare and Thomond, this Murrough O'Brien, one of
  the most famous names in Ireland.</p>

  <p>The O'Briens had been princes in Clare before the Romans entered Britain,
  and generations of them had fallen on foreign battlefields rather than submit
  to the English; but Beltarbet's father had come home to die, and through the
  intercession of kindly folk at St. James' this little parcel of land in
  Wicklow and this small title of honor had been allowed to the last of the
  Princes of Clare.</p>

  <p>Lord Maskell, whose steward stood near him now, had been granted most of
  the Clare estate and it was rumored that the young Englishman, who had
  rendered brilliant service in the field, was soon to be rewarded with a
  revival in his favor of the ancient titles of Clare and Thomond. Lord
  Beltarbet, who had grown up with pride and poverty, bitter, reckless,
  thriftless, trained in nothing but loneliness, hated all the English, and
  hated more than any other man Lord Maskell, who ruled in Clare and who was on
  the Lord Lieutenant's staff&mdash;definitely one of the conquerors.</p>

  <p>The agent was not discomposed by the young man's stormy glance, but came
  concisely and with no show of hesitation to the heart of his errand.</p>

  <p>"Lord Maskell charged me to ask, sir, if you would reconsider your refusal
  in the matter of Diarmuid, the horse?"</p>

  <p>"You've wasted your errand," returned Beltarbet, dryly; "six months ago I
  told your master that the horse was not for sale."</p>

  <p>"Lord Maskell thought," said the Englishman, smoothly, "that possibly you
  had reconsidered. He is prepared to give even a higher price&mdash;he
  recognizes he is a very beautiful animal."</p>

  <p>"There's no finer horse in Ireland," cried Beltarbet, with a flash.</p>

  <p>"There'll be no finer price ever paid for a horse, if you take what Lord
  Maskell offers. It's fifteen thousand pounds, and that"&mdash;with a sly
  glance round the staring poverty of the room&mdash;"is a large sum, Lord
  Beltarbet."</p>

  <p>"I'll not sell the horse&mdash;the money is nothing to me."</p>

  <p>"You said as much before, Lord Beltarbet," the Englishman reminded him,
  slyly, "in the matter of Earl Sigurd's bowl."</p>

  <p>My lord turned his back upon the speaker and struggled for control by
  tapping the handle of his riding-whip on the worn window-frame; in all his
  short, unhappy life he had never done anything that he reviewed with such
  remorse and regret as the selling of Earl Sigurd's bowl, the last treasure of
  his family, which, according to a lovingly credited tradition, had been taken
  from the defeated invader by an O'Brien on the fierce and bloody field of
  Clontarf.</p>

  <p>"I sold the bowl to keep the horse," he muttered, "and that's enough."</p>

  <p>"Fifteen thousand pounds?" queried Mr. Ware, distantly, casually.</p>

  <p>Beltarbet faced him:</p>

  <p>"You know my poverty; you do not know, it seems, some other things of me.
  The horse is not for sale."</p>

  <p>"A pity!" The steward seemed to regret the sumptuous foolishness of this
  young man as well as the disappointment to his master. "Lord Maskell meant to
  enter him for the races. The Lord Lieutenant is entering Comet, the English
  horse&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I am entering mine&mdash;Diarmuid," said Beltarbet, sternly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Simon Ware was definitely surprised. His pursed lips and his raised
  eyebrows showed that he considered it an ostentatious and ridiculous gesture
  of defiance for a penniless young Irishman to dare to compete in races which
  were the diversion of the English gentlemen in Dublin.</p>

  <p>"There'll be a good many guineas on him&mdash;all that I and my friends
  can scrape up," said Beltarbet, frowning him down.</p>

  <p>"You'd be safer, sir, to take the money that's offered; it is a reckless
  risk to put all on the hazard of the winning of a race."</p>

  <p>"My family," smiled Beltarbet, bitterly, "are used to living at a hazard,
  sir."</p>

  <p>The Englishman rose, took his hat and cane, and smiled agreeably.</p>

  <p>"Just one word of warning, sir," he said, with a dry compassion for the
  dark young man. "It is well for you to have some friend at the viceregal
  court&hellip; The times are difficult for one in your position&hellip; Lord
  Maskell might be able, some day, to do you a service."</p>

  <p>"The day when I shall ask Lord Maskell, or any other Englishman, to do me
  a service will never dawn," replied Beltarbet, quietly. "You may tell your
  master as much. He has got my estates and will have, I hear, my titles. He
  has Earl Sigurd's bowl, which was my last treasure. He shall not have the
  horse. I have no more to say, sir, nor any hospitality to offer you."</p>

  <p>The Englishman bowed, by no means discomposed. "There are rumors of
  trouble," he said, flicking his gloves on his hat. "I live in Dublin. I hear
  a good deal that, perhaps, does not come to your Lordship's ears in
  Fournaughts. A Roman Catholic gentleman with Irish sympathies would do well
  to be very careful during the next few weeks."</p>

  <p>"Careful!" cried Beltarbet. "And why should I be careful? I've neither
  wife nor child; I'm the last of my house; I have nothing to lose. Tell your
  master that, if he sent this warning."</p>

  <p>"And you'll not sell the horse offered for in a fair and friendly
  fashion?"</p>

  <p>"Good-day to you, Mr. Ware!"</p>

  <p>Lord Maskell's steward drove away in his neat carriage from the demesne of
  Fournaughts. Beltarbet came out on to the sunken threshold step and into the
  sweet windy evening. Luke Tandy, the servant, was waiting there like a
  sentinel.</p>

  <p>"He came to buy the horse," said Beltarbet. "That was his errand,
  Luke."</p>

  <p>"You've sent him away?" asked Tandy, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I've sent him away," smiled Beltarbet. "I am putting Diarmuid into the
  October races and I'll ride the horse, though all the English in Ireland be
  there to laugh at me."</p>

  <p>"Did he say anything of the troubles?" asked Luke Tandy, keenly scanning
  his master's face.</p>

  <p>"He gave me some manner of warning," replied Beltarbet; "maybe from his
  master. But what's the matter for that to me. I've nothing in the world to
  lose&mdash;except the horse and you, Luke Tandy."</p>

  <p>He smiled into the elder man's eyes.</p>

  <p>They stood shoulder to shoulder, the same height, something of the same
  build; but forty years, and all the difference between royal and peasant
  blood, between them. They loved each other.</p>

  <p>Luke Tandy had twice saved the life of Beltarbet's father in foreign
  battles; Luke Tandy had brought Beltarbet himself, as a small child, home to
  the miserable demesne that was all that was left to the heir of Clare. Luke
  Tandy had taught him all he knew of arms and horsemanship, and brought him up
  in love and lore of Ireland, the legends and history of it, the tales of the
  Shee and other unseen folk that haunt the oppressed and desolate land. Luke
  Tandy had served him, without wage or thought of a wage, for a poor bare
  living; he had been his close companion, his loving teacher in wood and
  field, walking by the banks of the Liffey, strolling in the shaded valley of
  Clara, riding through the haunted hollows of Boyne fields, beneath the tombs
  of Irish kings, or climbing the noble sides of Slieve Donard, blue in the
  blue. To Luke Tandy, Beltarbet was a prince of ancient and pure race, and a
  boy dearer to him than his own two sons whom he had lost in the dreary
  hardships of long exile.</p>

  <p>Beltarbet gazed earnestly at the face of his one friend, companion and
  servant.</p>

  <p>"I had no right to refuse to sell the horse," he said. "There were pride
  and temper in that, although the animal is my own darling. I should have
  taken the money, and, maybe, built up the house again, and helped the
  creatures who starve to pay my rent, and see that you had more comfort and
  less work, Luke Tandy."</p>

  <p>"There is no money could pay for the horse, my lord; haven't you bred him
  and broken him yourself, with perhaps some help from me? Isn't he famous not
  only in Ireland but in England? Isn't he like a glory to the house, and an
  honor and a credit and a pride to you? We have so little&mdash;God help
  us!&mdash;for which to take honor and glory and credit."</p>

  <p>Beltarbet knew that. The horse stood for beauty and nobility in his life,
  which was otherwise so thriftless and barren. The animal had always seemed to
  him of more than mortal grace and power, as if he came from the Shee, or was
  a descendant of the immortal steeds of fire and wings who had borne the
  Princes of Clare into a hundred battles.</p>

  <p>But Beltarbet shook his head sadly and mocked at himself.</p>

  <p>"I paid more than I could afford for the horse. I sold Earl Sigurd's bowl
  to keep him, and I had no right to refuse the price for him, Luke Tandy. This
  poverty is breaking the heart in me and I need the money, if it's only to pay
  for my journey away, so that the English shall not see how I die."</p>

  <p>"You'll win the race and make a fortune," consoled the old servant,
  peering at his master lovingly and wistfully through the increasing azure
  twilight, so soft, so pure.</p>

  <p>"I'll win the race," said Beltarbet, "but who'll put money on an Irish
  horse whose owner cannot afford to give him a rider but must ride him
  himself? The Catholic gentlemen have no money, Luke Tandy, and the English
  will bet on their own animals. But I'll do it, just to beat Maskell's
  horse&mdash;just for once in my life, Luke Tandy, to get the better of Lord
  Maskell. He's had everything&mdash;all of mine and, maybe, God'll not grudge
  me just that one moment when I ride Diarmuid to the winning-post."</p>

  <p>Luke Tandy knew that there was more behind those words than the words
  themselves. The Englishman had indeed had everything&mdash;not only the
  estates, but the titles, the money, and the honors that should, in happier
  times for Ireland, have gone to the heir of Clare and Thomond; also the
  graces and favors of a lovely woman, fit bride for an O'Brien.</p>

  <p><br>
  In Dublin last winter Beltarbet had allowed his heart to mislead him; proud,
  somber, galled and outfaced by the English and the Protestant Irish gentry,
  he had made but a short appearance at the stately court of the amiable Lord
  Lieutenant. Yet it had been long enough for him to meet in the painted
  ballroom of Dublin Castle a lady who had caused some dreams to stir in his
  desolate heart&mdash;dreams which might never come again; and he had been
  blinded enough to believe that she had favored him; but she was English and
  Protestant, and surrounded by an ambitious family, and, before Beltarbet had
  left Dublin for the only retreat that his pride and poverty could tolerate,
  he had learned that the gay and splendid Kitty Archer was betrothed to Lord
  Maskell.</p>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The only person in the world who knew of this secret and exquisite wound
  was Luke Tandy, who had stood by for many a steady month and watched the
  recklessness of grief, humbled pride and thwarted aspirations of the lonely
  young man; and comforted, strengthened and supported him as best he
  could&mdash;not by words, but by companionship and service, by being there in
  the midst of his desolation and humiliation&mdash;always Luke Tandy, a
  friend, a servant, a subject of the Princes of Clare.</p>

  <p>Something of the poetry and romance of that brief, inarticulate and
  thwarted passion for the woman had passed into Beltarbet's feelings for the
  horse, this creature that seemed to have the wonder of all the four
  elements&mdash;the swiftness of the wind, the ardor of fire, the flowing
  grace of water, and the beauty of glittering earth.</p>

  <p>With an instinct to escape from his present distresses he went through the
  soft, gentle azure twilight down to the stables where Luke Tandy kept
  Diarmuid with a passion of tender care. Beltarbet leaned in the doorway and
  looked at the noble creature; he thought that the line and luster of him, the
  glow and color of him, were like an uprising poem or a swell of music.</p>

  <p>The young man caressed the loving creature, who understood both his
  affection and his pain, and pressed his face against the smooth warm roan
  coat, and knew in his heart that he ought to have taken the English gold;
  that winter he and Luke Tandy and the few poor creatures who looked to him
  might be brought very low.</p>

  <p>Beltarbet left the stables. He took a way that he could have found in the
  moonless dark, through a somber tangle of ashwood, to a little chapel. Here
  had stayed a great treasure, as safe in the lonely woods as if it had been in
  a safe in a London bank, for it was the last heirloom of the O'Briens and
  sacred to all the Irish&mdash;Earl Sigurd's bowl of silver gilt, with squares
  of flashing, angry-seeming, red and orange stone round it and strange
  lettering that no one had been skillful enough to decipher. Last year
  Beltarbet had sold this bowl to Lord Maskell in order to make some show in
  Dublin, without parting with his costly horse.</p>

  <p>Beltarbet entered the chapel. A little old man greeted him. He sat down in
  the dim light, and opened his soul, not for the first time, to the sad
  thoughtful priest, told him how Lord Maskell's agent had tempted him to sell
  Diarmuid, and of the arrest of men in Rathdrum, and soldiers in the Vale of
  Clara, of the peasantry gathering in Ballinalea, and how ill it went with
  him&mdash;a young man and strong, with a great name, to be there corrupting
  in idleness, and how he would rather die than live as he was living now,
  which was worse than a captive or an exile, outcast from all, denied
  everything&hellip; with ruin about him, and despair and idleness&hellip;</p>

  <p>Father Moran listened with loving patience. When Beltarbet had exhausted
  himself in overflowing speech the priest spoke, and his kind voice was like a
  shadow and a chill over the bold despairing energy of the other.</p>

  <p>"Ireland cannot rise! How can a man who is shackled to the ground struggle
  to his feet? This will mean but more widows and orphans, more houses like
  your house, Lord Beltarbet, and churches like mine."</p>

  <p>Luke Tandy had said the same; Beltarbet knew these two men, so different
  in their several ways, had spoken the dreadful truth. No revolt in Ireland
  could be anything but a desperate convulsion of extreme despair and would be
  most horribly punished.</p>

  <p>"You have a responsibility," urged the priest, gently; "you must lead the
  people toward peace and submission, not toward a useless and costly striving
  which can have but one end. When the foot is on the neck and the yoke is on
  the shoulder, when the chains hang heavy and the prison walls close round,
  there's nothing left but resignation."</p>

  <p>Beltarbet received Father Moran's blessing; then turned and went back
  through the dark wood to his dark mansion.</p>

  <p>The young man picked up the horn lantern in the hall and, holding it above
  his head, went from room to room, calling for Luke Tandy, to whom he wished
  to impart his resolution&hellip; But a little waiting, and the race, and
  perhaps a few guineas from it, and then away! and escape from the humiliation
  of inaction&hellip; "Eh, Luke! Luke Tandy!"</p>

  <p>No answer, though he searched from desolate chamber to chamber, went to
  the stables where his darling was safe, then round the whispering wood, he
  could not find his servant.</p>

  <p>He was peering through the bushes with an increasing impatience and a
  growing dismay when a small, crying, ragged boy ran out from the dark and
  told him that when he had gone to see the priest the redcoats had ridden up
  to the house in haste and power, had arrested Luke Tandy and carried him off
  along the Dublin road&hellip;</p>

  <p>Beltarbet mounted Diarmuid and pursued the soldiers through the mild warm
  night. He came up with them when they were halfway to their destination; but
  little was the satisfaction Beltarbet got from the meeting. The prisoner was
  a known rebel who had been going about the country and stirring up the people
  against the government. He would be lodged that night in Dublin
  Castle&hellip;</p>

  <p>Lord Beltarbet argued passionately with the British officer that it was a
  mistake; he could swear to it; his man would have done nothing without his
  knowledge&hellip; Neither he nor Luke Tandy knew anything of the risings. He
  demanded deliverance of the pinioned prisoner. When he could not get a
  hearing, and the officer impatiently ignored him, he rode behind the
  cavalcade to Dublin, and his heart was like to fly out of his bosom with
  shame and grief.</p>br&gt;

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500791h-images/BeltarbetsPride-2.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>That night Luke Tandy was flung into one of the evil cells in Dublin
  Castle, whose high-barred windows looked on to the courtyard called the
  Devil's Acre, from being the scene of floggings, executions and torments.
  Beltarbet and Diarmuid passed the night in a poor inn which was yet better
  than he could afford, and where he was treated with princely courtesy because
  his name was Murrough O'Brien.</p>

  <p><br>
  The following morning by use of grim patience and black determination
  Beltarbet forced himself into the presence of the governor of the castle
  prison.</p>

  <p>The interview with Luke Tandy he begged was denied him, but he got this
  news for his consolation:</p>

  <p>Tomorrow the old man would be flogged in the Devil's Acre; he had refused
  any manner of confession; if he <i>did</i> confess and give the names of his
  accomplices he would be hanged; if he refused to confess he would be flogged
  again and, maybe, put to other tortures.</p>

  <p>The English governor, a not unkindly man, was something confounded by the
  sight of Beltarbet's distress, but it was not in his power to grant him the
  interview, or, indeed, any privilege to any of his prisoners.</p>

  <p>"Have you no friend at the court among the English?" he asked, curious,
  interested, a little sorry.</p>

  <p>"A friend&mdash;I&mdash;an O'Brien?"</p>

  <p>"I saw you with Lord Maskell last year; he has some influence, and the
  lady he is to marry is the commander-in-chief's daughter and high in the
  friendship of the Lord Lieutenant's wife&mdash;you might do something
  there."</p>

  <p>"You send me to the man who has got my estates, will have my titles?"
  asked Beltarbet, thinking this an insult to his misery.</p>

  <p>But the governor had not so intended his advice: "Lord Maskell might
  consider that an obligation; he is easy and generous&mdash;you should try him
  if you can think of no one else."</p>

  <p>Easy and generous! The words beat bitterly in Beltarbet's distracted mind.
  Since he had come to Dublin he had heard the talk, which had now come to the
  coffee houses, that Lord Maskell and Brocas would be gazetted Earl of Clare
  and Thomond that winter&hellip;</p>

  <p>That night he called at Lord Maskell's fine mansion in Kildare Street and
  waited, in vain, for a bitter hour. The Englishman was abroad&mdash;he had
  been occupied with the troubles, with his military duties. His distress,
  sharply increased by the delay, sent Beltarbet to a club in Merrion Square
  where my lord might be, and there, by chance, he found him with a number of
  his companions&mdash;English noblemen and officers, gay and splendid,
  animated by the successful crushing of the rebellion, the prospect of a
  struggle with the French.</p>

  <p>Beltarbet sent in his name, and my lord left his gaming and came out to
  him.</p>

  <p>The two men met in the high, elegant chamber, with its painted ceiling and
  the Italian marble chimney-piece. Beltarbet was in his suit of an outdated
  fashion, shabby and worn, but brushed and mended by the landlord's daughter;
  the Englishman was in full regimentals, fair, handsome, confident.</p>

  <p>"I have come about my horse, Diarmuid," Beltarbet said, sternly.</p>

  <p>"You'll sell him?" asked Lork Maskell, agreeably.</p>

  <p>"No, I'll not sell him, but I've come to bargain about him. And that's
  difficult, sir, for I cannot remember ever in my life having bargained
  before."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," smiled the English officer, haughtily. "What, sir, can we have to
  bargain about?"</p>

  <p>"Very little, as you may suppose," smiled Beltarbet, also grimly. "You
  have the titles and the estates which should go with the name I
  hold&mdash;it's a queer thing for a Murrough O'Brien to come to an Englishman
  and talk of bargaining, is it not? There's little indeed I have left to trade
  with, Lord Maskell&mdash;only the horse, and it's desperate the plight I must
  be in before I talk of parting from him, for in all County Wicklow he's
  called 'Beltarbet's Pride.'"</p>

  <p>"It's a beautiful horse," remarked the Englishman, smoothly; "I have
  always admired him, and I have offered you what I believe, Lord Beltarbet, is
  a fair and even a generous price."</p>

  <p>"It's not the price I want," replied Murrough O'Brien, desperately.
  "There's a man of mine&mdash;a servant, a friend&mdash;in Dublin Castle,
  under suspicion of being implicated in these risings, and I can do nothing; I
  am a penniless, landless man with no influence, Lord Maskell; and there's
  none that'll be listening to me. But, if you lend me your influence for the
  sake of Luke Tandy, I'll give you the horse."</p>

  <p>"A bribe!" murmured Lord Maskell, softly, with his hand on his hip, where
  his scarlet sash was knotted over his sword hilt.</p>

  <p>"It will be in time for the races," added the Irishman. "He's not entered
  yet, and he'll win you the prize, for you'll have many friends that will put
  the golden guineas on him. I am offering you a large fortune, Lord
  Maskell&mdash;not that you need it, but money seldom comes amiss to any
  man."</p>

  <p>"And what," asked the English officer, dryly, "precisely do you wish of
  me?"</p>

  <p>Beltarbet told him, standing there in his worn, old-fashioned attire
  before the marble chimney-piece, his youth and beauty haggard and wasted from
  days of anxiety and nights of despair.</p>

  <p>"Luke Tandy is to be flogged tomorrow in what we call the Devil's Acre; it
  may be after that he'll be hanged, and maybe he'll be flogged again, and
  maybe he'll be put to some other torture; and that he's innocent I might take
  upon my honor; but, innocent or guilty, I'd have you use your influence to
  get him off, sir."</p>

  <p>"I doubt I've influence enough to get a rebel pardoned," remarked Lord
  Maskell, slowly.</p>

  <p>"There's your lady that's to be," suggested Beltarbet, quietly; "she's the
  daughter of the commander-in-chief&mdash;it may be she would say a word. Miss
  Kitty Archer was ever gentle and kind."</p>

  <p>The two men glanced at each other and then away again; a little silence
  followed the mention of the lady's name. Then Maskell asked: "Who is this
  Luke Tandy?"</p>

  <p>"He's the one friend I've left&mdash;the one servant and follower; he
  thinks of me still as if I were a prince in Clare; he saved my father's life
  twice abroad and brought me home. He taught me all I know of action, as the
  priests have taught me all I know of thought. A brave and loyal man, Lord
  Maskell, he would do nothing to bring trouble on my house or me, knowing I'm
  deep enough in that already."</p>

  <p>"I doubt if I can do anything," said the Englishman.</p>

  <p>"You can stop the flogging."</p>

  <p>Maskell was silent; his fair composed face was expressionless.</p>

  <p>"And if you couldn't stop it," added the Irishman, with a heaving breast
  and a note of desperate earnestness in his soft voice, "maybe you could do
  this, Lord Maskell&mdash;allow me to stand beside him in the Devil's Acre
  while he takes his torment."</p>

  <p>The Englishman glanced up with narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I could do that," he conceded. "And you'd give me your horse, for
  which I have offered fifteen thousand pounds, for so slight a favor?"</p>

  <p>"No slight favor to me, Lord Maskell; the O'Briens have always stood by
  their friends and servants. I've no right to ask anything from
  you&mdash;we're not friends or equals," he added with a flash in eyes and
  voice, "and there's that between us should make us enemies. It has not been
  the easiest thing in the world for me to come to you, Lord Maskell; I'll call
  it a bargain&mdash;not the begging of favor."</p>

  <p>"And I am to enter your horse," smiled the Englishman, "and win the race
  with him, and a power of guineas besides, eh? And who's to mount him? I hear
  you intended to ride him yourself."</p>

  <p>"He would give his best with me. With others he's a fine horse, the most
  splendid animal in Ireland, but with me he's like a thing from the
  Shee&mdash;all wind and flame!" The Irishman lifted his head and his gray
  eyes gleamed. "I'll tell you this, Lord Maskell, if you'll do what you can
  for Luke Tandy, I'll ride the horse for you at the races."</p>

  <p>"And yet you can have no cause to wish to serve me, Beltarbet."</p>

  <p>"I've none! I've the wrongs of a hundred years and more between us. You,
  and the like of you, Lord Maskell, have made my own country so hateful to me
  that, until this came upon me, I was going abroad again and taking with me
  the horse and Luke Tandy and, maybe, the old priest&mdash;all of us becoming
  like the leaves on the road again in a foreign land where my forefathers
  died."</p>

  <p>"And join our enemies?" suggested the Englishman, quietly.</p>

  <p>"It may be," said Beltarbet. "What have we ever been but
  enemies&mdash;Irish and English&mdash;since the days when Strongbow landed?
  Conquered and conquerors! And I wish that my father had let me take my lost
  fortune and stay in exile."</p>

  <p>"If you would give up your property and serve the King," remarked Lord
  Maskell, "you might yet find life desirable. Such an existence as you lead,
  Beltarbet&mdash;idle, lonely&mdash;is damning to a man."</p>

  <p>"I'll neither leave my faith nor serve the foreigner," replied Murrough
  O'Brien. "It wasn't to discuss this that I came here&mdash;but to ask you to
  do what you can for Luke Tandy. I have offered you the horse and to ride him
  for you and win the race&mdash;on my honor."</p>

  <p>Lord Maskell asked:</p>

  <p>"You have no other friend&mdash;no other hope?"</p>

  <p>"None," replied the Irishman, simply, "or I should never have come to
  you."</p>

  <p>"You hate me, I suppose," mused the Englishman, "because my grandfather
  had your estates?"</p>

  <p>"Hate? I don't know. They say you'll be Clare and Thomond&hellip; those
  are queer titles for a man whose name is Henry Tresham. I'm Murrough O'Brien,
  and that's all the difference there is between us. Now, will you take my
  bargain or not?"</p>

  <p>"What would you do if I refused?" asked the Englishman, curiously.</p>

  <p>"I could stand at the door of your damned gaol tomorrow," flashed Murrough
  O'Brien, "and hope that Luke Tandy would know that I was there..."</p>

  <p>"I'll see what I can do," said Maskell, negligently. "Will you stay and
  entertain yourself with me and my friends, Beltarbet?"</p>

  <p>"Such is not my humor," replied the Irishman, sternly. He gave the address
  of the miserable hostelry on the Howth road where he was to be found. "I'll
  be waiting there all night for your news, Lord Maskell."</p>

  <p><br>
  He left the warmly lit, aristocratic mansion, with its company of gay,
  laughing officers, gambling, drinking, confident, walked to the poor inn on
  the flats of the estuary, fetched out Diarmuid, and rode for hours.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my darling," he whispered to the horse, "and if Luke Tandy can be
  saved, I must ride the race with you for another man, and then may never
  mount you again. If Luke Tandy is not to be saved, if the Englishman will do
  nothing, then you and I must die, Diarmuid; some way, not daring to live when
  we were useless at a push like this. We'll gallop into the sea, Diarmuid, my
  darling, where the Danish ravens went down, and as the surf goes over us
  maybe Firvanna himself will catch your bridle and lead us to the company of
  the Shee. Maybe we'll then possess the land, my darling, and ride over it day
  and night with the English never seeing us."</p>

  <p>In the blue dawn he led the beautiful horse to the dingy stable and
  himself saw to his comfort, then caressed him, and lingered long beside him,
  for he must hope that he would not soon have to part with him.</p>

  <p>In the murky light, for it was not yet full day, he saw Luke Tandy
  standing eagerly waiting by the rough table in the poor parlor.</p>

  <p>"I'm free!" cried Luke Tandy, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>Not till after a full five minutes of warm delight and gratitude did
  Beltarbet consider Diarmuid must go.</p>

  <p>"And I'll be the Englishman's jockey in the race!" And he wondered how he
  should give this news to Luke Tandy, who would not consider himself worth
  such a price.</p>

  <p>The servant caressed his master's hand and talked to him wistfully,
  eagerly, of their dear project of leaving Ireland and trying some fortune
  abroad.</p>

  <p>"And you've a friend, my lord, who gave me this."</p>

  <p>He put a letter into Beltarbet's hand.</p>

  <p>The Irishman opened it. It was addressed to "The Earl of Clare and
  Thomond."</p>

  <p>"Why, who calls me this, Luke?&mdash;the name that was lost a hundred
  years ago, and never heard since save in the mouths of foreigners."</p>

  <p>He carried the letter to the mean window and in the pale light that
  entered read the large resolute hand:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Lord:</span></p>

  <p class="letter">Keep your titles, your servant, your horse. Indeed, no man
  can deprive you of them. I send you with this passports which will see you
  all safely beyond the seas; for your affairs in Ireland I will be steward.
  Perhaps we shall meet on the battlefield. I recommend to you, my lord, a life
  of action. The titles which I now give you shall never be my signature; but I
  shall always remain,</p>

  <p class="letter">Your obedient servant, sir,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Maskell and Brocas</span>.</p>

  <p><br>
  The bitterness of a hundred years lifted from the soul of Beltarbet&mdash;he
  had his horse, his servant, an open port, a generous enemy; as for his purse,
  the October races would line that very comfortably; for, unless God
  interfered, Diarmuid could not lose. And after that&mdash;a stern but noble
  fate would beckon him from his present ruin; cause and country were lost, but
  nothing would make his faith less than inviolate, and in the tumult of a
  world in arms one more Irishman might find an honorable foreign
  grave&mdash;nay, not so foreign, for it is difficult to discover a spot the
  blood of the exiles had not hallowed.</p>

  <p>The sunshine was very fair and pleasant&mdash;the pale tender sunshine of
  Ireland shining through the pure azure veils on the Wicklow hills melting
  round Slieve Donard, on the gray-blue waters of Dublin Bay, and penetrating
  the mean court of a poor inn where two men and a horse set out on a long
  journey&mdash;"With, maybe, the unseen people to guide us," mused Beltarbet,
  "for I believe Firvanna walks at Diarmuid's head and tells him the Shee goes
  with us."</p>
