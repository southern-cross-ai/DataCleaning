  <h2>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h2>

  <p class="first">"The Reformation of Circe" made its first appearance in
  September 1903 in <i>The Sketch</i>, a weekly glossy magazine published in
  London from 1893 to 1959, for a time under the pretentious sub-title "An
  Illustrated Weekly Magazine of Society and Aristocracy." This and a number of
  other stories by Oppenheim (for example, "A Commonplace Jest," "Darton's
  Great Picture" and "Darton's Successor," <i>qv</i>) were printed as part of
  an open-end series called "A Novel in a Nutshell." This series included, in
  the magazine's early issues, Bram Stoker's Gothic murder story "A Dream of
  Red Hands" (1894), George Moore's "An Episode in Bachelor Life" and "An
  Episode in Married Life" (both 1894), Grant Allen's "Amour de Voyage" (1894),
  and Walter de La Mare's "Kismet" (1895)</p>

  <p><i>The Sketch</i> printed two or three stories in each issue, mostly
  "society" stories, but also mysteries. Agatha Christie's first twelve Poirot
  stories appeared in <i>The Sketch</i> in 1923 under the general title "The
  Grey Cells of M. Poirot." The magazine also published a noteworthy series
  called "Tales with a Sting," which included contributions by Edwin Baird,
  E.M. Delafield and Marjorie Bowen.</p>

  <p>The following image of an 1894 issue of <i>The Sketch</i> will give the
  reader an impression of the appearance and "feel" of the weekly during the
  late Victorian and early Edwardian period.</p><br>

  <p>"The Reformation of Circe" was syndicated for publication internationally.
  The bibliographic record is obscure in this respect, but a file at the
  <a href="http://www.fultonhistory.com/Fulton.html">Old Fulton NY
  Postcards</a> site shows that one of the US newspapers in which it appeared
  was <i>The Democratic Herald</i>, Clyde, NY, which printed it on December 28,
  1904.</p>

  <h2>THE REFORMATION OF CIRCE</h2>

  <p class="first">"FOR the last time, then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For the last time, no!"</p>

  <p>Ransom looked sorrowfully into his friend's face. The note of finality in
  that brief negative was unmistakable. And the pity of it! Immense!
  Inexpressible!</p>

  <p>"I shall not come again, Derrator. But now that you are sending me
  away&mdash;we shall likely enough never meet again&mdash;you are going to
  hear the truth!"</p>

  <p>Derrator bowed.</p>

  <p>"Be patient, my dear friend," he murmured, with a faint note of irony in
  his tone. "I am going to hear your view of the truth."</p>

  <p>"I do not accept the correction," Ransom answered, quickly. "There are
  times when a man can make no mistake, and this is one of them. You shall hear
  the truth, and when you have spun out your days here to their limit, your
  days of sybaritic idleness, you shall hear it again&mdash;only it will be too
  late. Mind that&mdash;it will be too late! You are fighting against Nature.
  You were born to rule, to be master over men. You have power&mdash;the gift
  of swaying the minds and hearts of your fellow-creatures. Once you accepted
  your destiny, your feet were planted firmly upon the great ladder, you could
  have climbed&mdash;where you would!"</p>

  <p>"My friend," Derrator murmured, "it was not worth while."</p>

  <p>Ransom turned upon him fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Not worth while! Is it worth while, then, to loiter in your
  flower-gardens, to be a dilettante student, to write fugitive verses, to
  dream away your days in the idleness of purely enervating culture? Life apart
  from one's fellows must always lack robustness. You have the instincts of the
  creator, Derrator. You cannot stifle them. Some day the cry of the world will
  fall upon your ears, and it may be too late. For the place of all men some
  time or other is filled."</p>

  <p>Derrator lit a cigarette, and took his friend by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said. "You have plenty of time for the train. I will tell the
  carriage to go on to the top of the hill. I want to show you my
  possessions."</p>

  <p>Ransom recognised the purpose in his friend's invitation. Together they
  climbed the mountainous path. At the summit Derrator paused.</p>

  <p>"Look around," he said.</p>

  <p>"It is a beautiful view," Ransom admitted, coldly.</p>

  <p>Derrator laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Look again," he said. "There is the sea, the moor! Turn your lace to the
  wind: can you smell the heather? We have left the rose-gardens below, Ransom.
  This is Nature&mdash;the mother, the mistress beneficent, wonderful! You are
  a man of cities. Stay here with me for a day or two, and the joy of all these
  things will steal into your blood&mdash;and you will know what peace is."</p>

  <p>"Peace is for the dead," Ransom answered, fiercely; "the last reward,
  perhaps, of a breaking life. The life effective, militant, is the only life
  for men. Break away from it, Derrator, for God's sake! Yours is the
  <i>fainéant</i> spirit of the decadent. Were you born into the world, do you
  think, to loiter through life an idle worshipper at the altar of beauty? Who
  are you to dare to skulk in quiet places while the battle of life is fought
  by others?"</p>

  <p>Derrator smiled quietly&mdash;the smile that Ransom hated.</p>

  <p>"Dear friend," he said, "the world can get on very well without me, and I
  have no need of the world. The battle that you speak of&mdash;well, I too
  have been in the fray, as you know. The memory of it is still a nightmare to
  me."</p>

  <p>"You were ill-treated, Derrator," Ransom interrupted; "but your return
  would be all the more a triumph. You will go straight into office. The
  Premier himself is your suppliant."</p>

  <p>Derrator shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Let us confine our conversation to generalities," he said, dryly. "Do not
  think that I nourish any resentment against the Party for whom I laboured. I
  owe them nothing but thanks for driving me out. Only, I have learned my
  lesson. The strenuous life which you would glorify I have tried and found
  wanting. All the great causes of life are honeycombed with the disease of
  man's ambition and vanity and greed. For me the bottom has been knocked out
  of the whole thing. I have found here the life that satisfies me. Come and
  see me when you will, Ransom, but never again as an ambassador."</p>

  <p>And Ransom was silent, because he had no more to say. The two men stood
  side by side, watching the carriage from below crawl up the hill. Before it
  reached them, however, the horn of a motor-car, approaching in the opposite
  direction, drove them to the side of the road. They both turned. A slow,
  enigmatic smile transformed Ransom's face. After all, there was hope,
  then.</p>

  <p>The car passed them&mdash;without undue speed, but enveloped in a cloud of
  dust Derrator watched the woman, and Ransom watched the man who had once been
  his bosom-friend. He saw the woman's languid curiosity flash from her
  deep-blue eyes, Derrator's arrestment of all expression, sudden, faint start
  as the woman's lips curved into what, with longer waiting, might have
  developed into a smile. The episode, if it could be ranked as such, was
  over.</p>

  <p>Ransom, from his seat in the carriage, leaned over to say a final
  word.</p>

  <p>"My mission, Derrator," he said, "must be written down a failure. Yet I am
  one of those who cling to thin chances, so I want you to remember this. All
  that I have said remains in force for six months from to-day. The solitude
  which has brought you a certain measure of madness may carry in its bosom its
  own antidote. Therefore, I shall not despair. <i>Au revoir</i>,
  Derrator!"</p>

  <p>"Farewell!" Derrator answered, with a wave of the hand.</p>

  <p><br>
  She came to the boundary-hedge, a gleam of white, tall, a little ghost-like
  with the smooth grace of her silent movements. She was bareheaded; she came
  to him out of the late twilight as one walking through a mist. As she walked
  she sang softly, at first to herself, then to him. He heard her, frowning. He
  was pale and nervous.</p>

  <p>"Is it true," he asked abruptly, "that you are going?"</p>

  <p>"But why not?" she answered, with gently upraised eyebrows. "One does not
  come to such places as these for always. One sleeps through the night, but
  the daytime&mdash;ah, that is different!"</p>

  <p>"You have been contented here?"</p>

  <p>"More than contented! I have been almost happy," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Then why go back?" he asked, with a sudden fierceness in his tone. "What
  is there in the world so beautiful, after all? Here are the sun; and the sea,
  and the wind&mdash;it is the flower-garden of life. Stay and pick the roses
  with me!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am not like that," she answered, slowly "Life may have its vulgarities,
  its weariness and its disappointments, but it is the only place for men and
  women. The fight may be sordid and the prizes tinsel&mdash;yet it is only the
  cowards who linger without."</p>

  <p>"Still, you have been content here," he repeated, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Content to rest," she answered; "but one does not sleep for ever. We
  were, neither of us, born to linger in a maze of abstractions. The
  contemplative life is for the halt and maimed of the world. We others must
  carry our burden into the thick of the battle."</p>

  <p>"You speak to-night in allegories," he said. "You mean that you will
  return to London?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!"</p>

  <p>"And leave me here, after these days together&mdash;after everything."</p>

  <p>Her eyes sought his, and the man's heart beat to passionate music.</p>

  <p>"That," she murmured, "is as you will, Sir Hermit. Only it is certain that
  I must go. As for you&mdash;well, you are a man. It is for you to
  choose."</p>

  <p>He sprang over the low paling. She swayed towards him with outstretched
  arms. Together they passed away into the world of shadow.</p>

  <p><br>
  "You wonderful woman!" Ransom murmured. "What can we give you? A peerage in
  your own right, a diamond tiara&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense!" she interrupted, a little sharply. "The
  Governorship for Herbert was all that I asked, and that he has. For the rest,
  I wonder sometimes&mdash;I wonder whether I do not regret."</p>

  <p>Ransom stared at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Regret?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I do not believe that he is happy."</p>

  <p>Ransom sighed meditatively. After all, the ways of women were indeed
  mysterious.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," he remarked, "but that sounds a little sentimental, does it
  not?"</p>

  <p>"If it is&mdash;what then? Am I too old or too world-weary for
  sentiment?"</p>

  <p>Ransom was not at his ease.</p>

  <p>"You amaze me, Adelaide," he said. "I regard you&mdash;we all regard
  you&mdash;as Derrator's saviour. He had committed moral suicide; it was you
  who disinterred him. The world owes you much for that; we owe you more;
  Derrator, perhaps, owes you most"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she murmured; "perhaps not."</p>

  <p>"But I do not understand your hesitation," Ransom persisted. "Derrator's
  career was ended. It was you who brought him once more into touch with great
  things, and you can see for yourself the outcome. Did you ever know a man
  grip the helm more firmly? He will be Prime Minister in five years."</p>

  <p>"Prime Minister, perhaps; but will he be happy?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Once more Ransom looked at her in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Happy, Adelaide! I do not understand you. The man's career was ended. It
  was you who brought him back before the footlights. Of all your achievements
  I think that was the greatest."</p>

  <p>"And of all my achievements," she answered, "it is the one of which I am
  least proud. You and I are both worldly persons, Ransom, but I yield the palm
  to you. To tell the truth, I am not happy about Derrator."</p>

  <p>"You lingered too long with him in his lotos-land," Ransom said, with a
  subtle note of mockery in his tone. "His rose-gardens were very beautiful,
  but there was poison in every blossom&mdash;the poison of honey-flowers, you
  know. I trust that none of it has found its way into your veins."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure," she answered, a little defiantly. "After all, a man is
  great by what he is, not what he does."</p>

  <p>"Hush! He is coming," Ransom said, quickly "I am going to find Milligan.
  Find out what he has decided about Duncan's offer."</p>

  <p>Derrator sank into the seat which Ransom had vacated. He was tired and
  there were dark lines under his eyes. The woman watched him closely.</p>

  <p>"You are weary," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," he answered. "Already I have forgotten it. I have been
  looking for you."</p>

  <p>For once she was tongue tied. She knew well that the psychological moment
  had arrived. Every muscle of his face seemed set into nervous lines.</p>

  <p>"I have been looking for you," he repeated, in a low, deep tone, his eyes
  fixed steadfastly upon her. "I have something to say."</p>

  <p>"Well?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"I think," he continued, "that to-night I may speak. I have obeyed your
  call. For your sake I have broken a vow which had become to me almost a holy
  thing. The time has come, Adelaide, when I claim my reward."</p>

  <p>For the moment she was evasive. Her eyes were fastened upon his face, as
  though she would read his unspoken thoughts.</p>

  <p>"My friend," she said, "that sounds a little like an accusation. I
  persuaded you to break your vow because I honestly believed that you were
  wasting your life. I thought that you only needed to feel yourself once more
  in touch with the great world, and your only regret would be for the years
  which you had wasted. To-night I have been watching you, and I am not sure
  that I was right."</p>

  <p>He looked straight ahead. Could he, too, she wondered, be wandering once
  more in the world of shadows where the cedar-trees drooped low and the
  perfume of the roses hung heavy upon the air? Underneath the lace of her gown
  her bosom was quickly rising and falling. She leaned forward and touched him
  on the arm.</p>

  <p>"You shall have your answer," she whispered, "and it shall be 'yes.' But
  there is a condition."</p>

  <p>The momentary flash of joy in his race died away. "Another!"</p>

  <p>She leaned a little forward.</p>

  <p>"Do not be afraid, dear," she whispered. "The condition is only
  this&mdash;that you take me back to where I found you. Only a little while
  ago I was a missionary; to-day I am myself a convert. Let us go back
  together&mdash;and hear whether the nightingales are singing still!"</p>

  <p><br>
  So Derrator was never Prime Minister, after all.</p>
