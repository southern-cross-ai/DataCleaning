I. &mdash; THE MYSTERY OF SURGEON-MAJOR PALMER</h2>

<p>ON that most sensational, or at any rate one of the most
sensational of Derby days, what was known as 'Hermit's Derby,' a
party of ladies and gentlemen, who, if not justly entitled to claim
to walk in the exclusive ranks of the upper ten,' were not far
removed from them, so far as their mode of life and habits were
concerned, went down to the race-course from London in a
splendidly-appointed drag, drawn by four magnificent bays that were
tooled by young Lord Blank. (It is fitting that his Lordship's true
name should not be given here, as he had nothing whatever to do
with the extraordinary events I am about to narrate.)</p>

<p>Before dealing with these people it will not be out of place to
briefly refer to that ever memorable Derby, which, to the
astonishment of every one, to the ruin of many, and the despair and
death of not a few, was won by a rank outsider called Hermit, owned
by Mr. Chaplin. The odds on this horse were no less than 100 to 1,
and if any one had ventured to predict before the race began that
the horse would win he would have been voted insane. Nevertheless,
after a wonderful and most exciting race, during which two or three
persons died suddenly on the field from heart disease, Hermit
carried off the blue ribbon of that year by a bare neck only, his
jockey being J. Daley, who got £3,000 for winning, while the owner
of the horse netted no less a sum than £141,000. Not the least
remarkable thing in connection with this remarkable race was, that
the Duke of Hamilton had laid £180,000 to £6,000 against Hermit,
but some little time before the Derby Day his grace was able, by
means known to turfites, to declare the bet off, and so he saved
his £180,000. When the winning horses were declared, the duke must
have considered himself an exceedingly lucky man, for, though I do
not know how much he may have won, it is a matter of history that
he had been within an ace of bringing ruin on the ducal house. With
these brief remarks I will now pass on to the ladies and gentlemen
in the drag. The party, exclusive of the noble driver, numbered
six. They were a Mr. Egerton Plunkett, about six-and-twenty years
of age, whose father had recently died and left him a million of
money, which had been made in the iron trade. But as fools and
their money are soon parted, it seemed at this time as if young
Plunkett had determined to get rid of his million with the greatest
possible speed; for, though he had only been in possession two
years, it was reported that he had already squandered a fourth of
it. Then there was the Hon. Sidney Drinkwater, another young man,
but who was said to live principally on the Jews, as he had 'good
expectations.' His name, as far as he was personally concerned, was
somewhat of a misnomer, as it was understood that he rarely took
water, except by accident. He was a tall, lank, cadaverous-faced
young gentleman, four-and-twenty years of age (who, it may be
stated here, died of alcoholic poisoning before he was thirty.)
Next in order comes Mr. Algernon Mainwaring, a partner in an
exceedingly wealthy firm of solicitors. The ladies were two
sisters, the Misses Lilian Travers Aitkin and Mabel Susan Aitkin.
Beyond saying that they were noted and <i>notorious</i> beauties,
it is not necessary at the present to say more, as I shall have to
deal with them further on.</p>

<p>The sixth person of the little party I have purposely left till
the last. He was Surgeon-Major Palmer, retired. This gentleman was
then about sixty years of age, but looked younger, being a
wonderfully-well preserved man, with a splendid physique, and a
pronounced military bearing. He had served his country with
distinction in a medical capacity for something like thirty years,
and had distinguished himself for his devotion and skill during the
Crimean war, towards the end of which he was seriously wounded by a
splinter of a shell that burst near him as he was attending to a
wounded officer on the battle-field. Doctor Palmer had never
married, owing&mdash;so the story ran&mdash;to his having been
jilted in his youth, which caused him to register a vow that he
would remain single all his life. He had, however, earned for
himself a reputation for being 'a thorough man about town,' and in
spite of his being a gentleman by birth and education, he was
ostracised in certain classes of society owing to some glaring
scandals with which his name had been mixed up. Nevertheless, he
was a man whose company was courted, for he had a singularly
winning manner with him, was very handsome, a brilliant
<i>raconteur,</i> generous to a fault, and was never known to speak
ill of any one, even of those people whom he knew to be his
enemies. Such a man was sure to be in great request, especially
when, added to his other attractions, he was the fortunate
possessor of ten thousand a-year, which he had inherited from an
uncle.</p>

<p>Surgeon-Major Palmer was a Bohemian by instinct and inclination.
He loved a free and unconventional life; and at his charming house
at Chelsea some very remarkable company could be met with.</p>

<p>In order to minister to their wants at the Derby the party had
taken three men-servants with them, two being the butler and
footman of Lord Blank, and the third a servant of Dr. Palmer's. His
name was Walter Joyce. He was slightly under forty years of age,
and was a fine, tall, handsome fellow. He had been a soldier, and
had seen service in the Crimea. His position was that of a valet,
and he had been with his master about six months.</p>

<p>The ladies and gentlemen I have enumerated were the guests of
Lord Blank, he having undertaken to drive them down to the course
in his sumptuous drag. They were a merry party&mdash;made merrier
by the fact that they all won some money by bets. In the way of
delicacies that would minister to the carnal appetite nothing
seemed to have been forgotten, and the luncheon was of a very
<i>recherché</i> description, while the gentlemen vied with each
other as to which could be the most gallant and attentive to the
two beautiful young women who were their companions. Presumably
life sat very lightly on each member of that little company. No
thoughts of a dark to-morrow or a tortuous future entered into
their minds. The mighty sorrow of the world had apparently passed
them by. They revelled in the luxury that wealth can purchase, and
they laughed and were joyful. No doubt, had it been possible for
some Asmodeus to have enabled an outsider to peer in each heart
that seemed to beat so joyously, he would have seen that not one
was without its black speck&mdash;not one without its gnawing worm.
For human life&mdash;at any rate such a life as these people
led&mdash;must ever be conventional, and more or less
hypocritical.</p>

<p>After the great event of the day was over the party returned to
town, which they reached about six o'clock. Lord Blank deposited
his guests at the door of Surgeon-Major Palmer's house. Then he
left them with his two servants, a prior engagement necessitating
his going away, and so he passes out of this story. The others were
to dine at Dr. Palmer's house, which I must now describe to some
extent. It was a large, old-fashioned house, standing in about an
acre of ground. The garden was walled in, but in the boundary wall
at the bottom was a door which gave access to a small paddock of
about three-quarters of an acre, which the doctor utilised for his
horses; and it is important to state here, as it has a considerable
bearing on what follows, that at this particular time a very
favourite horse of the doctor's, which he called Jerry, and which
had been out of health, had been put to graze in the paddock, and
was there on the Hermit Derby night.* The man was greatly attached
to the horse, and the horse to him, and, whatever Surgeon-Major
Palmer's faults were, he bore the character of having a great love
for all dumb animals. The dinner party consisted of, besides the
doctor, the Hon. Sidney Drinkwater, Mr. Egerton Plunkett, Mr.
Algernon Mainwaring, Lilian and Mabel Aitkin, and a Mr. Roland, a
neighbour, who 'dropped in.' The house, which was a commodious one,
was luxuriously furnished, and provided with everything that taste
could suggest and money buy. There were rare pictures, bronzes,
articles of virtu, bric-a-brac, and a unique collection of Indian
curiosities which the doctor had gathered in India.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The Doctor's house was pulled down years
ago, and the land built upon, several smaller houses now covering
the site.]</p>

<p>The household was presided over by a lady housekeeper, a Mrs.
Challoner, the widow of an army officer, who had been in the
doctor's service for some years. And besides the valet, Walter
Joyce, already mentioned, there were a butler, a cook, a
scullerymaid, three chambermaids, two parlourmaids, a coachman, two
grooms, and a page-boy.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the doctor kept up a very considerable
establishment, but he also kept a great deal of company. Indeed it
was very seldom that there was not company in the house; and as the
doctor was very fond of the fleshpots of Egypt, he must have made a
pretty big hole every year in his income. It was but natural,
perhaps, that this particular convivial gathering should be marked
by a trifle more freedom and a little more boisterousness than
usually characterised even the doctor's little dinners, which were
noted for their <i>recherché</i> character and freedom from
restraint. 'This is Liberty Hall, ladies and gentlemen, and you
will do as you like,' the host was fond of saying. But on this
night there was a memorable Derby to commemorate, and some men and
women are fond of the slightest excuse for a little extra
indulgence. One thing was certain, that the doctor's guests needed
good appetites and an all but unlimited capacity for imbibing. Dr.
Palmer's appetite was said to be prodigious, and he liked his
friends to eat and drink heartily. To dine with the doctor was
considered a treat, for he was an epicure, and his wines could not
be surpassed.</p>

<p>When the dinner was over the ladies and gentlemen retired to the
elegantly-appointed smoking-room, where they played cards for a
couple of hours. After that they adjourned to the drawing-room, and
music was indulged in, and at midnight they went down to a supper
of lobster-salad and champagne.</p>

<p>The reader who has followed me thus far will, no doubt, say that
by this time these people must have been in a condition when they
could no longer be said to be responsible for their actions. And,
as a matter of fact, they were all more or less under the influence
of the wine they had taken. It had at first been arranged that the
ladies were to be escorted home&mdash;they lived near Regent's
Park&mdash;and the doctor had given orders that the carriage was to
be ready, but this order was countermanded, and it was decided to
make a night of it; but the Hon. Sidney Drinkwater became ill, and
at his own urgent request was driven home in the doctor's dog-cart.
It was arranged that all the others were to sleep in the doctor's
house, with the exception of Mr. Roland, who lived within a couple
of hundred yards.</p>

<p>When the Hon. Drinkwater had departed, such of the servants who
had remained up were told to go to bed, including Walter Joyce, the
valet. The butler was the last to retire, as he had to replenish
certain supplies which had been exhausted. This duty accomplished
he too went to bed, the doctor undertaking to see the house all
secure and the gas put out. It would appear that the doctor and his
guests resorted to cards as a means of enjoying themselves, and
soon after two o'clock the two ladies begged to be allowed to
retire, and with some reluctance the doctor gave them permission to
go, as they pleaded that they were quite knocked up; and being a
soldier and a gentleman he could not resist their appeal, so he
himself showed them to the room they were to occupy. This was a
very handsomely-furnished chamber in the front of the house, his
own bed-room being on the opposite side of the corridor. In about
ten minutes he rejoined his guests, and two or three more rubbers
of whist were played, but it is in evidence that the gentlemen had
by this time got into a state when most things had ceased to
interest them. Some exception, however, was to be made in the
doctor's favour, for it would seem that there was a stage beyond
which he never went, and it was positively asserted that he never
so far forgot himself as to be unable to account for his
actions.</p>

<p>As the orange, so to speak, had been sucked dry for that night,
or rather morning, the host conducted Mr. Plunkett and Mr.
Mainwaring to their rooms, and then he saw Mr. Roland home, and
having performed this service he returned to his house. That was
beyond all doubt, because the policeman on the beat, and to whom he
was well known, happened to be at the gate, and the doctor chatted
with him for some minutes, the subject of conversation being the
remarkable circumstance of a rank outsider winning the Derby.
Wishing the man good night, the doctor entered his house, and the
policeman heard him lock and chain the door. It was then after four
o'clock, but still quite dark, with rain threatening and a very
strong wind blowing.</p>

<p>The rest of the night wore itself away, and the doctor's
household&mdash;that is, the servant part of it&mdash;rose somewhat
later than usual, for they knew that, after the preceding night's
carouse, their master and his friends were not likely to put in a
very early appearance. Soon after nine o'clock Mrs. Challoner, the
housekeeper, took some tea up to the ladies. They were asleep when
she first knocked at the door, but the knocking awakened them and
the door was opened; and now a very remarkable incident has to be
recorded. In the course of conversation with the housekeeper Lilian
Aitkin said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, Mrs. Challoner, do you know I've had such a horrid dream. I
dreamt that Dr. Palmer was dead, and I woke up in a fright and
could have sworn that I heard the report of a gun. Then I went to
sleep and actually dreamt the same thing again.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Challoner smiled, and remarked that dreams were not to be
relied upon, and that she had no doubt, when the ladies went down
to breakfast, the Doctor would be there to meet them radiant as
ever, for he seemed to be endowed with a cast-iron constitution,
and nothing upset him.</p>

<p>An hour or so later, when the ladies did go downstairs, they
proved Mrs. Challoner to be incorrect, for the Doctor was not there
to meet them. The butler said that he would send Walter Joyce to
call the master, but the ladies begged that he would not do so yet,
for they were quite sure the Doctor must be very much fatigued, and
they preferred that he should be allowed to sleep for some time
longer. At eleven o'clock Mr. Mainwaring put in an appearance, and
to him Lilian related her dream on his asking her and her sister
how they slept, and he being an unsentimental man laughed and told
her dreams were to be interpreted contrariwise. A quarter of an
hour later Mr. Plunkett joined the party in the breakfast-room, and
as the host had not then appeared the butler was requested to send
up to his room.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the butler rushed in with the startling
information that not only was the Doctor not in his room, but his
bed had not been slept in, and he could not be found in any other
part of his house. Such an effect had this announcement on Lilian
Aitkin, as she connected it with her dream, that straightway she
fainted, and so added to the confusion into which the guests were
thrown. The housekeeper was summoned and instructed to give
attention to the lady, and then Mr. Mainwaring, being a lawyer and
a practical man, began to question the servants as to what
likelihood there was of their master having gone out after his
guests had retired, and they answered that they did not think it at
all likely. Moreover, the large hall door and the back doors were
all securely bolted and chained. That would not have been the case
with the hall door if the master had gone out.</p>

<p>At first no uneasiness was felt by the guests, and Mr.
Mainwaring despatched a message to Mr. Roland, asking that
gentleman to come round, and when he arrived he told them what they
had not known&mdash;that the Doctor had taken him home, and left
him at his doorstep, and he knew nothing of the Doctor's movements
after that. Now, if the servants were correct in what they
stated&mdash;and there was no reason to believe they were
not&mdash;namely, that the doors were bolted and chained, it was
obvious that the Doctor must have re-entered his house; and if that
was so, where could he have gone to P But in a little while the
scullerymaid, who was the first to come down that morning, asserted
positively that a back door leading out of the scullery into the
back garden was only on the latch, and was not locked at all, which
astonished her very much, for she knew that the master was very
particular about the doors, as the house had been twice robbed, and
burglaries were not infrequent in the neighbourhood. Added to this
was a statement by the old gardener, who said that he too was
surprised to find the wall door that led into the paddock standing
open. Now he was aware, as well as all the servants were, that
since Jerry, the horse, had been in the paddock, the Doctor often
went out the last thing at night to see that Jerry was all right,
and to give him an apple or a carrot; but he was always very
careful about closing the paddock door to prevent the horse getting
into the garden. The inference now was that, after the Doctor had
returned from seeing Mr. Roland home, he entered his house by the
hall door, and having securely fastened that, had gone out at the
back to visit Jerry. That was feasible enough, of course, but if he
had gone out, why had he not come back? That was precisely where
the mystery began! It was clear that the Doctor had disappeared,
but how and why? It was equally clear he had not been in his bed,
for it was exactly as the chambermaid had left it, and the gas was
still burning in the room. The paddock was examined, but the
missing man was not there. It did not apparently require much
examination, for it was simply an oblong field, with two poplar
trees at the end; a very much decayed oak tree; a wooden shed for
the horse on one side, and a dung heap and a liquid manure pit. One
side of the field was bounded by the garden of another house, from
which it was separated by a tarred wooden fence and a quick-set
hedge. At the bottom it was joined by another garden, but here
again was a compact hedge, and the other side was protected by a
high brick wall that shut it off from a side thoroughfare.</p>

<p>When all these things were considered, something like a feeling
of uneasiness seized upon the little company, and they asked each
other what could possibly have become of the Doctor. There was a
door leading out of the garden into the thoroughfare just
mentioned, but this was only used by the gardener, and the Doctor
had not a key. Moreover, the door was locked, and from the thick
cobwebs in the corners and the dirty and rusty condition of the
lock it was certain that the door had not been opened for a
considerable time. At one side of the house and at the back part
were the stables and stableyard, and on the other side the front
garden was separated from the back by a light trellis work
overgrown with ivy. There was a door in the trellis work, but it
was also locked. At this door a huge Newfoundland dog was kept
chained up, and no one had heard the dog bark in the night. Of
course he would not have barked if his master had gone to him, but
he would have made himself heard unmistakably if a stranger had
been moving about the premises.</p>

<p>A consideration of all these points only served to deepen the
mystery, for mystery it certainly was. Amongst the servants who had
crowded into the breakfast-room and the guests uneasiness was very
apparent, and uppermost, no doubt, in each mind was the unspoken
question, Has anything dreadful happened to the Doctor?'</p>

<p>Miss Lilian Aitkin&mdash;whose dream by this time was known to
the servants, Mrs. Challoner having told them&mdash;gave way to
uncontrollable grief, for she was deeply impressed with the dream,
which she had twice dreamt, and she expressed strong fear that
something terrible had happened. The rest, however, were disposed
not to take that view at the time, although they knew that, his
Bohemianism notwithstanding, the Doctor was not erratic, nor given
to wandering off without leaving word where he was going to.</p>

<p>From the evidence that Mr. Mainwaring had gathered up so far, it
seemed pretty certain, if the servants were to be believed, that
the master had entered the house again after leaving Mr. Roland. So
much was certain, because the hall door was bolted inside, and a
heavy chain that fastened right across it was in its place,
according to the statement of the servant. But, having secured that
door, he went out at the back, using the scullery doorway for his
exit; and his object, on the face of it, was to visit Jerry and see
that he was all right. Having gone into the paddock, however, it
seemed as if he had not returned, because the communicating door
between the garden and the paddock was, as the gardener declared,
standing open. In company with the gardener, coachman, stableman,
butler&mdash;in fact, all the men folk&mdash;Mr. Mainwaring went
into the paddock again with a view to examining the hedges to see
if there was any trace of the Doctor having gone through. It was
not possible for him to have got over the wall; it was too high,
unless he had used a ladder, and he would hardly have carried the
ladder off with him. In the bottom hedge there was observed a
slight, very slight, gap, through which a man might have squeezed;
but the hedge being a prickly thorn hedge, a person so squeezing
through must have suffered very considerably; moreover, it was in
the highest degree probable that he would have left shreds of his
clothing on the thorns; but, though the lawyer examined this part
of the hedge with the greatest care, even using a powerful reading
glass from the Doctor's study for the purpose, there was not the
slightest trace of anyone having gone through. Besides, anyone
forcing himself through must necessarily have broken some of the
twigs, but not a twig was broken.</p>

<p>After this examination it was felt that the mystery was
deepening, and not a soul there was capable, or at any rate,
willing to suggest even a possible hypothesis for the Doctor's
disappearance. It was only too painfully evident that he had
disappeared, but how or why not a living soul there could tell.</p>

<p>Naturally, there was a reluctance on the part of his friends no
less than on the part of his servants, to make the matter public;
for if Lilian Aitkin is left out there was no one present who at
that stage of the proceedings suspected mischief. The disappearance
might be a freak on the Doctor's part; but what puzzled them was
how he could have got away. Miss Aitkin indulged in all sorts of
gloomy forebodings, for she was a nervous and hysterically-inclined
young woman, and her dream had given her a shock, and she expressed
a firm conviction that the Doctor was dead.</p>

<p>The instability of human joy and light-heartedness was
strikingly illustrated by these people. A few hours before they
were full of a happy carelessness; they might have been the
personification of perfect delight so far as they could be judged
externally, but now grave anxiety was apparent in every face, and a
fear, shadowy and vague at first, did begin to take possession of
them when hours passed, and they were as far off as ever from
answering the problem. It is, perhaps, needless to say that the
house, as well as the grounds, was thoroughly searched, but without
yielding the slightest clue, and at last, when the fear was
becoming more substantial, Mr. Mainwaring told his companions that
he thought that they ought not to delay any longer communicating
with the police; and as this was voted the proper thing to do, the
lawyer took the task upon himself, and went out for that
purpose.</p>

<p>Within two hours of Mr. Mainwaring appealing to the police, I
was sent for, he having been recommended to put the case in my
hands. He gave me all the details of the doctor's movements during
the past twenty-fours in a perfectly frank manner. And those
details form the story which I have narrated in the foregoing
pages. Being a lawyer, and used to systematising facts and
incidents, he was clear in his statements, and placed all the
incidents in proper sequence, so that everything likely to have any
bearing on the case might be before me. Mr. Mainwaring did not
attempt to disguise that they were all more or less under the
influence of the wine they had imbibed the previous day and night.
But his own opinion was, the doctor was not much, if any, the
worse. That this was correct was borne out by the testimony of the
policeman, who while on duty had seen Surgeon Palmer, and conversed
with him a few minutes previous to his entering his house. That he
did enter the house and secure the door the man was positive about,
and that the door was secured in the morning all right was vouched
for by the servant who had come down first.</p>

<p>At this stage of the case it did not seem that any of the
friends or servants, except Miss Lilian Aitkin, seriously thought
that any fatal calamity had happened to the Doctor.</p>

<p>'The fact is,' said Mainwaring, 'although he could stand a lot
of drink without showing it, it affected his brain very much, and
when alcoholised he was in the habit of doing erratic and idiotic
things. Now what I think is this: Seized with some sudden and
unaccountable desire to wander about after he got into the house,
or after he went into the paddock to see the horse, he managed to
get away somehow or other, and has fallen perhaps into bad hands;
that is, got into a house where he is being detained. He may even
have been drugged, for he wore a good deal of jewellery, and was
seldom without a considerable sum of money in his pocket. Having an
idea that I am correct in my theory, I should like the affair kept
as quiet as possible so as to avoid scandal.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I answered, 'what you state is feasible, although it's
antagonistic to your first statement, that it was not possible for
him to have got out of the paddock without leaving some indications
behind as to how he had gone.'</p>

<p>'True, I did say so; but if he didn't leave the paddock, where
the deuce is he?'</p>

<p>Of course this line of argument showed that, lawyer though he
was, Mr. Mainwaring was at his wit's end for a reasonable
theory&mdash;in short, was absolutely mystified. As I was assured
that every hole and corner of the house had been subjected to a
rigid examination, I did not deem it necessary to go over the
premises again at that moment. And having heard a narration of Miss
Lilian Aitkin's dream&mdash;to which, let me say here, I attached
not the slightest importance&mdash;I proceeded to the paddock in
company with the lawyer and several of the servants, including the
coachman, stablemen, and the gardener. After a full half hour's
critical examination of the place, I came to the conclusion that
the Doctor could not have escaped that way. There was not the
slightest gap in the formidable hedge through which a man could
have passed without leaving some trace behind&mdash;that is to say,
he would have required to have exerted so much force in order to
squeeze his body through that many of the twigs and stems must
necessarily have been broken. Now, the paddock itself had no hole
or corner where a man could have concealed himself. There was a
small hay stack in one corner and a shed in the other, but they, of
course, need not be taken into account. Yes, there was one place,
but it could only have hidden a dead man's body. This place was the
liquid manure pit. It was about twelve feet square, almost flush
with the ground, but a wooden combing running all round to prevent
the edges of the pit falling in, and there was a wooden pump on one
side for the purpose of pumping the liquid up, which was then used
for the garden. Looking at this pit for some moments I
asked&mdash;</p>

<p>'How deep is that pit?'</p>

<p>My question was like a bombshell, for it at once suggested a
dreadful possibility, and I saw that nearly every one present
betrayed alarm.</p>

<p>'My God!' exclaimed Mainwaring, 'you don't think that he has
thrown himself in there?'</p>

<p>'I asked a question,' I said; 'it is not for me to hazard an
opinion. How deep is the pit?'</p>

<p>The gardener here spoke up and answered me.</p>

<p>'It's about three-and-a-half feet, sir.'</p>

<p>I confess that when I heard that I had a sort of instinctive
feeling that that horrible place would show us how the Doctor had
disappeared. For, if he was not in there, how could he have gone
away and left no trace behind unless he had been spirited away?</p>

<p>'Have you a pole or a pitchfork?' I inquired of the
gardener.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' and he went off to the stable.</p>

<p>The little group of spectators became suddenly silent and
scared, after the manner of people who know that they are about to
hear some dreadful revelation. My own feeling in the matter was
this&mdash;and let it be understood that my thoughts were naturally
bred out of what I had been told. All the people were utter
strangers to me. I had never heard of Surgeon-Major Palmer in my
life; but, according to the details, as I had gathered them, this
gentleman, being wealthy and an idler, and fond of free-living, had
been to the Derby, bent on having what he would, no doubt, have
called a day's enjoyment. At night he entertained his friends at
his house, and they all seemed to have drank, 'not wisely, but too
well.' The surgeon, being able to stand more than the others, saw a
friend home at an early hour in the morning; then returned to his
house, and in all probability he may have refreshed himself again
from the too seductive decanter. After that, being fond of his
animals, he had gone out to see his invalid horse; and after
that&mdash;what? With the other facts before one, did it not seem
easy to fill in the sequel? Some sudden aberration of intellect
<i>might</i> have led him to commit suicide; but the more likely
theory was that, lacking physical steadiness, and possibly being
somewhat in a mental haze, he had stumbled and met his fate in that
horrible cesspool. Surely, nine hundred and ninety men out of every
thousand would have constructed just such a theory as that in the
absence of a tittle of evidence that the Doctor had got out of the
paddock, and, as I looked at the melancholy horse standing limp and
scared-like under the shed, I thought to myself, 'That poor beast
knows all about it. I read the story in his mournful eyes, and had
he but the gift of speech he would say, 'Yes, you are quite right;
it is even as you think.'</p>

<p>As will be seen directly, only one part of my theory was
correct.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the gardener returned with a pitchfork, and,
taking this from him, I began to sound the manure pit, and in a few
moments I turned to the scared and eager spectators who were
crowding round, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'The gentleman is in here.'</p>

<p>The effect of this announcement was to cause them all to start
back in horror, and one of the female servants fell with a shriek
to the ground and fainted. I had with the pitchfork touched a soft,
yielding something in the turbid mass, and that something I had not
a doubt was a human body. The fainting woman was carried into the
house, and then we made a grapnel of some large iron hooks fastened
to two lengths of cord, and with this apparatus we fished
Surgeon-Major Palmer from the horrible pit.</p>

<p>The recovery of his body, of course, caused a sensation amongst
those who, in a sort of bewildered and fascinated way, were looking
on. It was but natural that when we hauled the body out I should
think that the theory I had constructed was the correct one, for I
had no means of seeing then that the mystery was only
beginning.</p>

<p>It can readily be surmised that the condition the poor gentleman
was in after being soaked in that filthy liquid prevented our
seeing the true state of matters. I had a large horse-cloth brought
from the stable, and in this we placed the body, and so carried it
into the scullery, and when I had intimated that the corpse should
be stripped of the clothing and washed and the coroner notified, I
considered my share in the ghastly business was over. But, as a
matter of fact, it was only then commencing.</p>

<p>The servants, of course, were much cut up and horrified, for the
'master' was greatly beloved by those who served him; for he was
not only a very considerate master and a humane one, but an
unusually kind one to his servants, and so there was much weeping
and wailing at the sight of the poor man lying there enveloped in
slimy filth, and stone dead. One of the gardeners had already
seized a sponge, and, dipping it in water, had begun to sponge the
face, when suddenly he started back with the exclamation&mdash;</p>

<p>'Good God! look here, he's got a hole in his head!'</p>

<p>I was in the very act of leaving the scullery when this was
said, but, turning back, I stooped down, and saw on the forehead
near the right temple a blue, jagged wound, which, from its
appearance, left no doubt on my mind was a bullet wound. I had seen
many bullet wounds in my time, and was not likely to be
deceived.</p>

<p>Rising to my feet I said&mdash;</p>

<p>'This puts another aspect on the matter. Please send for the
nearest medical man, and leave the body precisely as it is. Don't
touch it any more until it has been seen by a surgeon.'</p>

<p>I now deemed it my duty to remain there, although the conclusion
I came to was that it was a case of suicide, and when Mr.
Mainwaring muttered to me, 'This is an awful bit of business,' I
answered, 'Yes, the poor man has evidently killed himself.'</p>

<p>I should rather be disposed to say somebody else has killed
him,' Mainwaring remarked. 'Why, he seemed to me the very last man
in the world to do such a deed as that. He enjoyed life. He was of
a most cheerful disposition; had plenty of money, and, as far as
one could judge, not a care in the world.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' I answered, 'every man leads a life within his life.
Unless you can know the secret workings of a man's heart you can
never know whether he is truly happy or not. Besides, the brain
often plays sudden tricks with us, and there may come a time when a
sudden pang of remorse for something done renders a man mad for a
moment, but in that moment he realises the falseness of life's
glitter, and rushes into the unknown.'</p>

<p>'There is truth in what you say,' replied Mainwaring, 'but I'll
be hanged if I can think that of Palmer. He was not only a
philosopher, but endowed with a powerful mind.'</p>

<p>'Well, we shall see,' I returned. 'You knew him, and I didn't;
but I think we shall find it is a case of suicide.'</p>

<p>In the course of another few minutes the doctor arrived, and,
stooping down, he made a cursory examination of the wound, and
immediately pronounced it a bullet-hole. He thereupon ordered the
body to be stripped and washed immediately, and while preparations
were being made for carrying out these instructions I returned to
the paddock to look for the weapon that had made the hole, and I
took the gardener with me. My own impression was the weapon would
be found in the manure pit. For some strange reason, as it seemed
then, Dr. Palmer had shot himself at the edge of the pit, and when
he fell the pistol&mdash;for, presumably, it was a
pistol&mdash;fell with him. So we set to work at once to pump the
liquid out; but while this was being done I used the drags, though
without any result. And after we had been at work half an hour, the
butler came running out in a very excited state, and exclaimed
breathlessly&mdash;</p>

<p>'Mr. Donovan, Mr. Donovan, the doctor wants you
immediately!'</p>

<p>I returned to the house at once. The body had been removed to a
little ante-room, whither I was conducted. I found the doctor, Mr.
Mainwaring, and Mr. Plunkett there, and when I had entered the
doctor closed the door and said, quietly and gravely&mdash;</p>

<p>'Mr. Donovan, this is a case of murder.'</p>

<p>'Murder!' I echoed.</p>

<p>'Yes. I find on examination that there is a very deep puncture,
evidently a stab, in the back under the left shoulder-blade, and,
as far as I can judge from the direction of the wound, I should say
the heart must have been punctured. Now, although it would have
been easy enough for a man to have shot himself in the forehead as
we find this man shot, it would be an utter impossibility for him
to stab himself in the back. I have probed for the bullet, but
cannot find it. It is probably imbedded deep in the base of the
skull. I should say without hesitation that either wound would
produce almost, if not absolutely, instantaneous death, but it is
clearly impossible for me to determine now whether the Doctor was
shot first or stabbed first.'</p>

<p>'I will not hesitate to say that this announcement caused me a
shock, because it seemed to me at first so clearly a case of
suicide, that murder had not entered into my thoughts. But from
what the doctor said, there could not be a shadow of a doubt that
Surgeon-Major Palmer had been foully murdered. And now came the
solemn and serious question&mdash;' By whom? Who had done this
horrible deed? And why had he done it?'</p>

<p>From the careful examination we had already made of the paddock,
we proved pretty conclusively that there was no break in the hedge
to show that a man had either entered or left. But, returning once
more to the place, I began a new inspection, and as I noticed the
old horse, which was still standing mournfully under his shed, I
could not help the reflection Poor beast! your eyes must have seen
this strange deed&mdash;must have seen your poor master foully done
to death; but nature seals your mouth, and you cannot describe the
murderer.'</p>

<p>It might only have been fancy on my part, but it certainly did
seem to me that the animal was sorrowing and grieving.</p>

<p>The inspection I now made only served to confirm the conclusion
I had come to at first, which was that nobody had got over the
hedge; and to have got over the wall a ladder was necessary, though
a daring and determined man might have got over by other means.
That is, he might have had a rope with a large sharp hook at the
end. He could have thrown this hook to the top of the wall until it
caught. Then he could have pulled himself up by the rope, and
lowered himself down again on the other side by the same
arrangement. But given that this was the means employed, I should
have expected to find traces of the man's boots on the surface of
the wall. I say 'a man,' because all the circumstances were
antagonistic to the idea that a woman had done the deed. As far as
mere possibilities went, a woman might have done it, but the
probabilities were all against it, though it did occur to me that a
woman might, and very likely was the cause.</p>

<p>Although I subjected the wall to the keenest search, I could not
detect the slightest sign that a man with boots on had climbed up
it. X man without boots on might have done so. Supposing, for
instance, the murderer had prepared all his plans beforehand, he,
in all likelihood, came barefooted, and in that ease his feet would
not have marked the wall. I next got a ladder and, mounting to the
top of the wall, examined it for indications of a hook or grapnel
having been employed, but I could see nothing that warranted me
coming to the conclusion that such a means of entrance to or egress
from the paddock had been used.</p>

<p>Most certainly, as appearances went then, the affair was a very
complicated puzzle, and it was necessary to define some reasonable
hypothesis to account for the motive of the murder. That motive was
not robbery. That was placed beyond doubt by all the property on
Dr. Palmer's body being intact&mdash;his ring's, a diamond
scarf-pin, his massive and very valuable gold chronometer and
chain, and his money, £20 being found in his pocket. The idea of
robbery, therefore, had to be put on one side. And that being so,
the next likeliest motive was revenge, and till I saw reason to
change my views I determined to look upon revenge as the actuating
cause which had led to the dark deed being committed. As a logical
sequence of this view, it followed that the person guilty of the
deed must have been pretty well acquainted with the Doctor's
habits. He must have known that he was in the habit of going to
look at his sick horse the last thing before retiring. And on the
night of the crime he knew, no doubt, that his victim was making
merry&mdash;that his victim's guests were in a state when they
would probably all sleep soundly. And so the murderer lay concealed
in the paddock during the solemn hours of the night, and with no
mortal eye, save that of the poor old horse, to witness the foul
deed, he slew the unfortunate man. All these points, if in any way
correct, pointed to the murderer as being one of the household of
that night. Either one of the guests or one of the servants. I need
scarcely say I kept this thought strictly to myself.</p>

<p>Not the least remarkable circumstance in connection with this
mystery was Lilian Aitkin's dream. That she did so dream seemed
evident, because she had told Mrs. Challoner before it was known
that the Doctor had not slept in his bed, and Mrs. Challoner had
told the other servants. Necessarily I asked myself if this dream
was the effect of foreknowledge, or the result of causes that could
not be determined by ordinary laws? But if it was the effect of
foreknowledge, the girl must have been worse than a fool to tell
her dream, as it was calculated to place her in a somewhat
unenviable position. I inclined to the belief that there was no
foreknowledge, because, had Lilian known that the murder was to be
committed, she surely would never have been so weak-brained as to
say she Lad dreamed about it, for what possible purpose was there
to serve in so doing? Nevertheless, I determined to look into the
history of pretty Lilian Aitkin.</p>

<p>In due time the manure-pit was pumped dry, and then we carefully
searched the place for the weapons with which the murder had been
committed; but the search was without result. We could find
nothing, and I turned my attention then to trying to discover the
exact spot where the crime was perpetrated, and on my hands and
knees I began a careful scrutiny of the grass, deeming it probable
that some of the blades would show traces of blood, for the doctor
stated that from both wounds there would be a large flow of blood.
After a time my search was rewarded. I found what were unmistakably
blood-stains on the grass. I 'graced these stains to the haystack
of which I have made mention. There was a wooden roof over this
hay. The roof was supported by a wooden prop at each corner. I
found that some of the loose hay on the ground had been drenched
with blood. Here, then, was the spot where the deed had been done,
and it was easy to suppose that the murderer lurked behind the
haystack, that his victim went to the stack to get some hay for the
horse, that he was then shot and fell on his face, but, not being
dead, or to make doubly sure of the fiendish work being complete,
the victim was stabbed in the back as he lay. His body was then
dragged to the manure-pit and cast in.</p>

<p>So far, the action of the tragedy seemed clear enough. And now
it was important that the weapons should be discovered, for they
might afford an unerring clue to the perpetrator of the deed. To
this end the paddock was searched and searched again. The hay was
turned over; possible and impossible hiding places were examined;
the adjoining gardens were also searched under the idea that the
criminal might have hurled the things away after the crime was
done. But our labour was all in vain. Nothing was found, and I next
turned my attention to the interior of the house. The servants, as
well as the gentlemen guests who still remained, anxious to do what
they could, rendered valuable aid, and our search of the house was
as thorough as the search of the gardens and the paddock had been,
but the result was the same. In the Doctor's bed-room were three or
four revolvers, but it was proved that they had not been used for a
long time. There were also hung on the wall an Indian lance, a
cavalry sword, a Turkish bayonet, and an Italian dagger with a
jewelled handle, and a long, sharp blade. These things were
subjected to a rigid examination with a powerful glass. But the
rust of ages was on them, and it was obvious they had not been used
to take their owner's life.</p>

<p>Before leaving the house, where I had now been for some hours, I
questioned Mr. Mainwaring as to what his views were of the affair.
His answer was, that he had no theory whatever. He had known Dr.
Palmer for about a year, and the greater part of that time they had
been very intimate. As regards his own affairs, Doctor Palmer was
peculiarly reticent. He was very hospitable, very warm-hearted,
brave as a lion, of a most even temper, and full of animal spirits.
He had great determination of purpose, was excessively fond of
gaiety, and of the company of ladies, and his weakness in the
latter respect had sometimes led him into scrapes. Such were the
characteristics of the deceased gentleman as given me by Mr.
Mainwaring; and, as I pondered over the matter, it seemed to me
that the cause of the murder must be sought for in the Doctor's
gaiety. In other words, jealousy had prompted the crime, and my
business was to try and discover who had had the best reason to be
jealous. In this I saw, or fancied I saw, an exceedingly likely
clue to the murderer; but at that stage of the proceedings I was
bound to confess to myself that the whole affair was shrouded in
mystery.</p>

<p>I need scarcely say, perhaps, that in setting to work to unravel
this mystery I did not lose sight of the possibilities that the
Surgeon's slayer might be found amongst the guests he had
entertained on the night of his death. It must be borne in mind
that I inclined strongly to the belief that the motive of the crime
was to be found in jealousy, and the cause of that jealousy, I
decided, was one of the Misses Aitkin, if not both of them. The
Doctor's attention to these ladies had inflamed someone who was
also enamoured of them. Thus I reasoned, and it was for me to
determine who the <i>someone</i> was. Herein my field of labour was
narrowed to a very limited area&mdash;that is, so long as I
confined myself to the guests&mdash;for virtually my suspicions, if
I really had any suspicions, rested on Mr. Mainwaring or Mr.
Egerton Plunkett; but I very soon saw reason to definitely decide
that I should not be justified in harbouring suspicion against
these gentlemen; and, although I ascertained that the Hon. Sidney
Drinkwater&mdash;who, it will be remembered, left the Doctor's
house early in the evening&mdash;was smitten deeply with the charms
of Miss Mabel Aitkin, she did not encourage him in the least. But,
any way, he could not have been jealous of the Doctor as far as she
was concerned, as servants and friends alike were unanimous in
declaring that it was Lilian who was the Doctor's favourite. And,
attractive as her sister was, Lilian completely overshadowed her,
for I must certainly rank her amongst the most beautiful women I
have met. She had a wonderfully mobile and expressive face, that
reflected like a looking-glass the varying emotions of her mind.
Neither of these young women was well educated, and each lacked
that polish and refinement that conies from high-breeding; but each
in degree was peculiarly fascinating, though Lilian bore off the
palm. In conversation her lack of thorough education was soon made
apparent; but she made up for it by an amount of general knowledge
that was little short of amazing, and which was due, no doubt, to
the fact that she had a most retentive memory, and was a keen
observer. The quality of self-possession, too, was one that she had
naturally, and which she had cultivated to a very marked degree.
She was capable also of arguing in a way that might have
discomfited many men. But leaving Lilian and her sister for a
moment, let us return to the servants.</p>

<p>The female portion I passed over, for I was perfectly convinced
it was not a woman's hand that had destroyed the Doctor's life. In
fact, the medical man who made the <i>post-mortem</i> examination
averred that the knife had been driven into the body with such a
force that only a very powerful man could have done it. Amongst the
men servants the one that most nearly answered that description was
Walter Joyce, the soldier servant of Dr. Palmer. He had a splendid
physique, with a development of chest and a massiveness of limb
that argued remarkable muscular power. The character he bore in the
house was that of being reticent, and now and again given to an
over-indulgence in stimulants; but he was described as a singularly
even-tempered and good-natured man. Before entering the Doctor's
service, where he had been for six months, he was for two years
with a retired army captain. The captain was dead, but his widow
and family spoke of Joyce in the very highest terms of praise; and
I saw nothing, and heard nothing, that would have warranted my
harbouring a shadow of suspicion against him.</p>

<p>The sensation that was caused when the crime became known was
very great, and the deceased gentleman's relatives came forward
with all sorts of theories, all of which, however, when put to the
test, were found to be unworkable.</p>

<p>Mr. Mainwaring&mdash;who proved himself to be a very practical
and business-like man&mdash;agreed with me that in all probability
jealousy had been the actuating motive leading to the crime. He
informed me that the Doctor had been very strongly attached to
Lilian Aitkin, but that she did not altogether reciprocate the
warmth of his passion. He had&mdash;so the lawyer assured
me&mdash;even offered her marriage, but she had refused him, much
to the amazement of those who were acquainted with the
circumstance. This naturally set me pondering, and I asked myself
<i>why</i> a young woman in her position should have refused an
offer of marriage that must have so greatly been to her advantage.
It was a most suggestive circumstance to me, and I quietly set to
work to learn the history of Lilian and her sister, with the
following result:&mdash;</p>

<p>They were the only daughters of a naval officer who, dying when
they were quite children, left his widow unprovided for, and with
the burden of four children&mdash;two sons besides the
girls&mdash;on her shoulders. Thus it came about that the girls
received but scant education. They had, however, somewhat exalted
notions of the position they ought to hold in society; but finding
that their poverty militated against them, they revolted against
maternal control before they were out of their teens, and throwing
off all the shackles of restraint they abandoned themselves to
so-called gaiety. But Lilian came under the notice of a wealthy
invalid lady, who, being much struck with her, offered to take her
into her service as a companion, an offer the girl accepted. The
lady, wishing also to do something for the sister, provided Mabel
with the necessary capital to start, in partnership with her
mother, a small fancy shop as a means of livelihood, and this being
done, the lady went abroad, taking Lilian with her. They travelled
about the Continent for some little time, and then went to India.
Two years were passed in India when they started to return to
Europe, but the lady became seriously ill, and was advised to
remain at Malta, which she did, keeping Lilian with her. A year was
spent on the island, as the invalid became attached to the place,
and it seemed to suit her; but a sudden relapse of her complaint,
just as she was contemplating returning to London, had a speedy
fatal termination. Apart from a legacy of five hundred pounds,
payable immediately, she left Lilian Aitkin a hundred a year for
life.</p>

<p>Soon after the funeral of her benefactress, Miss Aitkin left
Malta, and a hiatus occurred in the story of her movements, as for
six months nobody seemed to know what had become of her. She
communicated with none of her friends, not even her sister, and for
these six months she disappeared entirely from their ken. At length
she turned up again in London. Her mother was then dead, and her
sister was carrying on the little business. But soon after,
yielding to Lilian's persuasion, she sold it, and they launched out
into a whirl of excitement. In the process of time they became
acquainted with Surgeon-Major Palmer, and, as I have already
stated, the Doctor made Lilian an offer of marriage, which, for
some reason best known to herself, she declined.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, was the story of these two young ladies. A story
that, so far as it concerned Lilian, had a special interest for me.
For bearing in mind the French proverb, <i>Cherchez la Femme,</i> I
felt almost sure that it was through her the Doctor had come to his
untimely end.</p>

<p>Let me make myself clear. I did not think that she had abetted
the murderer in any way, for I saw nothing to warrant that
conclusion. But what I did think was, that she had been the
unconscious cause; and that, if I could fill up the gap in the
story of her wanderin's, I might, perchance, obtain a clue to the
criminal. As it was, no clue was forthcoming. Not a trace of the
weapons could be discovered; nothing amongst the Doctor's papers
and letters threw any light on the matter; the most ingenious
cross-examination of the servants failed to bring out anything that
might have served as a guide; and the strange crime remained a
profound mystery. To confess that, in the face of all this, I felt
baffled, would be to do myself somewhat of an injustice. I did most
certainly feel puzzled, for I might be likened to a man in the
centre of a maze, who had tried the various paths without finding
egress. Still, I buoyed myself up with the thought that no puzzle
invented by human brain could be so ingenious as to utterly baffle
man's skill, and so I was sanguine that, sooner or later, I would
run the doctor's murderer down.</p>

<p>I must state here that, within a few hours of the doctor's
death, his executors&mdash;one of them was Mr.
Mainwaring&mdash;took charge of his property; and in the course of
a fortnight all the servants were discharged, as their services
were no longer needed. The house, therefore, that had been the
scene of so much revelry and careless pleasure was given over to
silence and solitude, while passers-by regarded it with more or
less awe, for murder, foul and cruel, had desecrated it.</p>

<p>Impelled by some sort of intuitive feeling that by clinging to
the sisters Aitkin I should ultimately obtain a clue that would
enable me to unravel the mystery, I determined not to lose sight of
them. Their demeanour and bearing convinced me that they were
sincerely sorry for the death of their friend. They referred to him
in terms of great respect, and did not hesitate to speak of the
great generosity he had shown towards them. Indeed, they both
averred that in him they had both lost the best friend they had
ever had in the world.</p>

<p>Perhaps I need scarcely say that I felt a good deal of curiosity
on the subject of Lilian's dream, and I frequently discussed it
with her, though she was unable to remember anything that might
have predisposed her to dream of the doctor's death. But somehow or
another, how I cannot for the life of me tell, there began to grow
up in my mind a conviction that she was concealing something; that
she had a secret which she was desirous of screening from the eyes
of all the world. As I say, I am quite unable to tell why I began
to think this. Probably it was due to an unconscious impression I
received that she always spoke with a reservation, notwithstanding
a seeming candour. But if I am not able to accurately determine the
beginning of my suspicion in this respect, I know that it
ultimately took hold of me, as it were, and I could not shake it
off.</p>

<p>It may readily be supposed that I was not willing to let go
anything, however shadowy, that promised even a remotely possible
clue to the unravelling of this strange and startling crime.
Already two months had passed, and yet we had failed to get on the
track of the murderer, and, notwithstanding that a considerable
Government reward was offered, and that this was supplemented by a
reward of £500, promised by the relatives, for any information that
would lead to the detection of the criminal, not a soul came
forward with a statement of any kind that was of the slightest
value. Udder these circumstances I was not disposed to let go my
hold of even the flimsy thread I had got. I was not blind to the
likelihood of my being deluded, but I resolved to go on until the
delusion became a certainty, or I proved myself right; and in
pursuance of this resolve I took an opportunity one day of waiting
upon Lilian Aitkin, and putting the following point blank questions
to her&mdash;</p>

<p>'Do you know of any one out of all your circle of acquaintances
who had, or might have thought he had, an interest in Surgeon-Major
Palmer's death?'</p>

<p>There was a very appreciable space of time between my question
and her answer, which was&mdash;</p>

<p>'No, I do not.'</p>

<p>The tone in which this was said, and the manner with which she
said it, gave force and weight to my hitherto somewhat shadowy idea
that she was carefully guarding a secret. Whatever that secret
might be I had no hope that I should succeed in wringing it from
her; for not only was she remarkably self-possessed, but she was
without that sentiment which we usually associate with women, and
she had the no less striking power of keeping her emotions in
subjection. In fact, she might be described as a woman absolutely
incapable of emotion. As there was no emotion to play upon, no
sentiment to stir up, she was not in the least likely to betray
herself, supposing that she had any guilty knowledge. To give point
to the foregoing remarks, let me add, that we generally reach a
woman's mind through the sentiment and emotion peculiar to the
womanly temperament; and, assuming the existence of these
qualities, the woman does not live who could resist giving herself
away to the man capable of exerting the peculiar diplomacy
necessary to the probing of the feminine heart. I had, almost from
my first acquaintance with her, been convinced that in Miss Lilian
Aitkin I had no ordinary woman to deal with; and mentally I likened
her to a sort of Sphinx who guarded her secrets in a stony breast,
against which no assaults would be effectual.</p>

<p>'There is one other question I must put to you, Miss Aitkin,' I
said. 'Will you tell me where you went to after you left
Malta?'</p>

<p>Perhaps it will almost seem like a contradiction of what I have
just set forth if I state that my question appeared to startle her,
or at any rate I thought it did. But now, without the slightest
hesitation, and speaking with a decisiveness that was unmistakable,
she said&mdash;</p>

<p>'No, Mr. Donovan, I will not. And I quite deny your right to
question me as to my past life. If you suspect me of being either
directly or indirectly concerned in the Doctor's fate, you can, as
an officer of the law, arrest me, and take such means as may seem
good to you to justify your measure. But I have yet to learn that
you do suspect me, and therefore I deny your right to open the
volume of my foregone life. It is mine, and mine alone, and I will
not yield it to inquisitiveness, idle curiosity, or unwarranted
suspicion.'</p>

<p>This answer astonished me, for it not only proved her to be a
remarkable woman, but it had in it the germs of an irrefutable
logic.</p>

<p>'I frankly confess that I do not think for a moment that you
were <i>particeps criminis</i> to this dreadful crime,' I said.</p>

<p>'Then why do you desire to go into my past history?' she
demanded with a certain indignant peremptoriness.</p>

<p>'To that question I must respectfully decline to accord a
reply,' I said firmly. 'It is not always easy, and most certainly
not desirable, to give reasons for one's motives.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' she answered, 'I will not seek to divine your
motives, for I am indifferent to them, and it seems to me any
further interviews between us will be merely a waste of time.'</p>

<p>This was decisive, and I left her, but I had no intention of
losing sight of her, and I was inflexibly determined then to fill
in that blank in the story of her life, for the thought still grew
and grew upon me&mdash;haunted me, as it were&mdash;that from those
lost pages of her strange history I might get more than a hint that
would help me in reading the riddle of the crime.</p>

<p>The sensation caused by the murder had quite died out. In deed,
it had been overshadowed by another great murder case in the
metropolis, in which a woman and two children had been foully done
to death; and as the public memory is short, Surgeon-Major Palmer
had ceased to be remembered. I mean, of course, in a public sense;
but there were men whose duty it was not to forget him, and I was
one of them. I was disappointed, irritated, that I had failed so
far to obtain any clue, although I was aware that I could not, no
more than any other man, perform impossibilities. But I felt, so
long as I had not filled in that hiatus in Lilian's history, I had
not exhausted every chance of getting on the track of the criminal,
and so I decided to take a step which I hoped would enable me to
supply the missing page. This step was to proceed to Malta; and, in
the course of the succeeding fortnight, I was crossing the Bay of
Biscay, bound for the island.</p>

<p>On arriving at my destination I found that Miss Aitkin was well
remembered, for her flirtations with many of the officers in
garrison there had made her somewhat notorious. Indeed, I was
informed that she had been the cause of two or three duels, and of
grave scandals that had blighted more than one family's
happiness.</p>

<p>But I learned something, to me of far greater importance than
this. I was made aware of dark rumours that had found tongue of an
intrigue carried on by Lilian Aitkin with a man who had been a
soldier, but who was then a servant attached to the household of
the principal Maltese magistrate. The man was known by the name of
James Beeston. Soon after Lilian left the island this man suddenly
and mysteriously disappeared. As he was not known to have been
guilty of any offence against the law, it was at first supposed
that he had committed suicide. Subsequently, however, it was
incontestably proved that he had gone off in a French fishing
lugger, named <i>L'Etoile,</i> which was bound to Marseilles. This
fact would have been without any special significance save for one
thing. I learned that Lilian Aitkin, when she left the island, went
direct to Marseilles also, in a French mail boat.</p>

<p>Here, then, were two suspicious incidents which required looking
into; and I began to think I was now in a fair way of discovering
what Lilian did during those months when she was lost to her
friends. A few days later I was in Marseilles, and by dint of
unflagging perseverance I obtained information which made it clear
that Miss Lilian and James Beeston came together, and that they
proceeded to Paris. This latter fact became known in rather a
curious way. In the hotel where Lilian stayed in Marseilles she
lost a valuable ring which had had been given to her by her
benefactress. The landlord promised that every means possible
should be taken to find the ring, and if found, it should be
forwarded anywhere she wished. She thereupon said she would write
when she got to Paris, and communicate her address. This she did.
The ring was found, and sent to her at Hotel Meyerbeer, Rue
Meyerbeer, Paris.</p>

<p>From Marselles I went off to Paris, and my investigations at the
Hotel Meyerbeer revealed the fact that Lilian and James Beeston
stayed there as man and wife. They remained in Paris and at the
same hotel for several months, but they did not seem to be in
perfect concord with each other, and often quarrelled. It was said
that the chief, if not the only, cause of this was that 'Monsieur
was jealous of his pretty wife.'</p>

<p>But now I brought a more startling item still to light. On
getting a description of James Beeston I found it tallied closely
with that of Walter Joyce, who had been servant to Surgeon-Major
Palmer; and when I was aware of this, the mystery began to clear
away, and I felt that the road out of the maze was straight before
me.</p>

<p>My next journey was to London, and once back in the metropolis,
I lost no time in trying to arrest James Beeston, <i>alias</i>
Walter Joyce, on suspicion of being the murderer of Surgeon-Major
Palmer; but he had gone, leaving no trace behind him. Lilian
Aitkin, however, was still at her old address, and once again I
sought an interview with her.</p>

<p>'Miss Aitkin,' I began, 'since I last saw you I have been able
to fill in the blank in your history.'</p>

<p>'Indeed!' she exclaimed sneeringly. 'I hope it is satisfactory
to you.'</p>

<p>'In one sense it is; and I want you to tell me now where I shall
find Walter Joyce, or James Beeston, if that is his correct
name.'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' she answered without a change in her demeanour
or her expression.</p>

<p>'You must pardon me,' I remarked, 'if I frankly say I more than
doubt your statement.'</p>

<p>'You may do as you like, sir,' she said. 'I repeat, and repeat
it most emphatically, that I have only seen him once since the
murder of Dr. Palmer. That is two or three days after the
crime.'</p>

<p>'Where did you see him?'</p>

<p>'He called here to induce me to go abroad with him.'</p>

<p>'I am not surprised to hear that,' I answered, 'for I may at
once inform you that I have learned that you and he lived in Paris
together after you left Malta.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I lived with him, because he became my husband.'</p>

<p>I smiled incredulously, and I thought she so far betrayed her
feelings as to show anger at my doubt. But there was no anger in
her voice as she spoke. Her tone rather indicated contempt,
indignation, scorn.</p>

<p>'You have learnt much,' she said, 'and have shown yourself
clever, but you have only learnt half the truth apparently. Excuse
me for a few minutes, and I will show you something that will
astonish you.'</p>

<p>She left the room, and was away about a quarter of an hour. Then
she returned and handed me a document, which I unfolded and read,
and had to confess that I was astonished, for it was a certificate
of a civil marriage between Lilian Aitkin, spinster, and James
Beeston, bachelor, celebrated at the British Embassy, Paris.</p>

<p>'I knew you would be surprised,' she said, with a cold cynical
smile playing about her pretty mouth, and an expression of
consciousness of the triumph she had scored.</p>

<p>'I may well be surprised,' I answered, 'for I did not dream that
Beeston was your husband. And now your reason for refusing Doctor
Palmer's offer of marriage is clear.'</p>

<p>At last her wonderful self-possession gave way&mdash;her woman's
nature asserted itself, and she burst into passionate weeping. In a
few minutes she said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes; my reason was, I could not commit bigamy. The man I was
linked to I hated&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why did you marry him, then?'</p>

<p>'Because, like a blind fool, I thought I loved him. Every woman
becomes more or less mad at some period of her life, and I had my
moments of madness. I became his wife, and immediately after I
began to hate him, for he tried to make me his bond slave, and his
jealousy was such that, could he have done so, he would have shut
me up in an iron-bound room, and never have allowed me to look on
any human face but his. I had been too much used to freedom,
however&mdash;had seen too much of the world to yield readily to
the shackles he tried to put upon me. I rose in revolt; we
quarrelled desperately, and I left him and came to London. For a
time I lost sight of him, but he found me out. It was soon after I
became acquainted with Doctor Palmer. He was then in the service of
a Captain Millward. He said he was in great distress, because his
old mother was likely to lose a house she owned, owing to there
being a mortgage on it of three hundred and fifty pounds, which had
been called up, but which she could not pay. He told me, if I would
let him have this sum, he would make a solemn vow never to bother
me in any way again. He would give me a written undertaking to that
effect, and I was to be free to do as I liked. I got the money from
Dr. Palmer, and gave it to my husband. For some time after this I
neither saw him nor heard anything of him, when, to my amazement
and horror, I found he had entered the service of Surgeon-Major
Palmer. He so far kept his promise that he did not claim me as his
wife, and no one had the remotest idea of our relationship, not
even my own sister.'</p>

<p>'It's a strange story,' I remarked as she paused. 'Yes; but it
is a true one.'</p>

<p>'I do not doubt it. But, tell me, was your husband not jealous
of the attention paid to you by Dr. Palmer?'</p>

<p>'I believe he was, but he did not show it. One night, however,
he came to me&mdash;he had been drinking&mdash;and with passionate
appeal and entreaty he tried to induce me to live with him again as
his wife. I refused, and reminded him of his vow and written
promise. Then he said some cruel and bitter things about the
Doctor. This maddened me, and I told him I would rather be the
slave of the Doctor than my husband's queen.'</p>

<p>'Did your husband threaten his master?'</p>

<p>'No; I never heard him utter a threat.'</p>

<p>'But you believe that he murdered Dr. Palmer?'</p>

<p>'Now I do.'</p>

<p>'Did you not do so at the very first?'</p>

<p>'Not for the first few days. The thought came upon me
after.'</p>

<p>'Why did you not denounce him then?'</p>

<p>'Do you forget that I am his legal wife! Do you forget that his
disgrace and shame will reflect on me; and that if he is taken,
tried, and sentenced, I shall become an outcast&mdash;shunned and
pointed at as the wife of a murderer!'</p>

<p>I could not but admit the force of her argument, and I pitied
her from the bottom of my heart. It was a sad story: a story of
human weakness and sin; a story that had been repeated through all
the ages, and will continue to be repeated until time shall be no
more.</p>

<p>By the Doctor's will she and her sister had been left a legacy
of three thousand pounds each, and I advised them that, as soon as
they got the money, they should go abroad, where they were not
known, and begin a new life; they adopted this advice, and went to
America, and a year or two later Mabel married a well-to-do farmer,
and went to live with him somewhere near Colorado. But poor Lilian,
tortured by some remorse, or scourged by regret for her buried
hopes&mdash;hopes that died the night Surgeon-Major Palmer was
assassinated&mdash;sought for Lethe in potent drink, falling at
last into the clutch of the demon of consumption, which hurried her
to an untimely grave.</p>

<p>With regard to James Beeston, <i>alias</i> Walter Joyce, it
remains for me to say he managed to elude man's vengeance.
Notwithstanding the reward, and the fact that his portrait was
circulated in every civilised country in the world, no tale or
tidings of him were ever forthcoming. For months and months I tried
to get on his track, but failed. It is highly probable that, by
some means or other, he came to know soon after the murder that I
was watching his wife, and thinking that she might betray him, he
slipped from the country, leaving no trace behind. His crime was a
dastardly one, and I have always bitterly regretted that he managed
to escape the punishment due, but at least I have the satisfaction
of knowing that I was successful in clearing away the mystery that
at first surrounded Surgeon-Major Palmer's death.</p>

<p>As a sequel to the foregoing narrative, I may mention that some
years after the crime the grounds at the back of what was once Dr.
Palmer's house were being cleared for building purposes when an
old, decayed oak trunk, which had been a conspicuous object at the
bottom of the paddock owing to its being entirely covered with a
rich and luxuriant growth of ivy, was cut down, and while being
sawn in pieces there was found in a hollow of it an old navy
revolver and a formidable Spanish dagger. Both these weapons were
much corroded with rust, as they had lain there since the night of
the murder, for there could not be any reasonable doubt they were
the weapons that had been used to kill the unfortunate Doctor. Five
chambers of the revolver were still loaded, and as the bullet which
had been taken from the dead man's head had been preserved, it was
found to exactly correspond with those which were in the weapon.
The fact of the murderer having used two weapons for his fiendish
work seemed to indicate that the crime had been deliberately
planned. Probably he thought that he might miss his aim with the
pistol in the dark, and so had armed himself with the poignard.
Very likely he shot his victim first, and the poor man fell forward
on his face, and then, to make assurance doubly sure, the assassin
plunged the knife into his back. This is only conjecture, but it
is, at least, feasible. Whatever the <i>modus operandi</i> was, the
deed was done, and then the cowardly slayer hid his deadly tools in
the hole of the tree. He must, of course, have known beforehand of
that hole, and deemed it a safe hiding-place, as in truth it proved
to be, for I myself examined the ivy, thinking it might conceal the
weapons, but I failed to discover the hole, and little did I think
then I was within a few inches of the articles I was so anxious to
find.</p>

II. &mdash; IN A SMUGGLER'S DEN</h2>

<p>ALTHOUGH it has been my fate to wander pretty extensively over
the face of the habitable globe, and to see many fair scenes in
beautiful lands, I think that, in certain respects, the English
South Downs are unsurpassed. I venture on this assertion with some
amount of diffidence, and with no desire to institute comparisons.
But it will be admitted that it seems sometimes as if Nature had
put forth unusual efforts to gladden the eye with a picture of
perfect beauty, and in the South Downs she has certainly done this.
As to what constitutes beauty from a picturesque point of view, is,
as I am aware, a point open to discussion; and, as there are many
minds, so there are many opinions. Still, we are all agreed on one
thing&mdash;that is, that in order that a natural picture should be
beautiful in the strictest aesthetic sense it should contain many
elements. Now, what are the elements of beauty in this connection?
Firstly, there should be richness of colour; secondly, diversity of
outline; thirdly, softness of perspective; fourthly, an utter
absence of anything like incongruity. It may almost sound like
unpardonable redundancy to say that the picturesque must be made up
of picturesque features; but a little examination will show us that
such an expression is perfectly admissible. A square-towered,
ivy-clad church, for instance, in the midst of a landscape, however
beautiful, serves, as it were, to emphasise the picturesqueness,
for it is picturesque in itself. Again, a ship with all her sails
set, and drifting lazily on a sun-lit sea, lends point to the
seascape, and who will say that an old boat lying on the shore,
with a backing of dark brown rocks, does not give a finishing touch
to the view, which makes it all that can be desired as a
picture?</p>

<p>I fear that I have but imperfectly expressed what I wish to
convey, but let me return to the South Downs. Here, in certain
seasons of the year, we have a wealth of the very richest colouring
that Nature is capable of turning out of her laboratory&mdash;at
any rate, in northern regions. The emerald turf&mdash;and where
else is there such turf&mdash;stretches for miles and miles in
undulating sweeps, that at times slope gently down to the beach,
and anon breaks suddenly off, leaving great walls of white and
striated cliffs. At some places these cliffs go sheer down into the
water, which is constantly hurling green breakers at them. At
others their bases rest on golden sand, and the sea touches them
not, save when their faces are wetted by the salt spray blown in by
the wind. These Downs are the haunts of innumerable sea birds, and
the wild plovers have their home there. The Downs are also the
feeding grounds of one of the finest breeds of sheep in the world,
and in summer time the white fleeces of the sheep dotting the
brilliant green sward produce a most charming effect.</p>

<p>To lie on the edge of one of the great cliffs on a warm, clear
summer's day and to gaze up to the blue sky, or across the bluer
sea, is to enjoy a sense of dreamy repose that is entrancing. I
once found my&mdash; self under such circumstances one perfect day.
I was enjoying a holiday and seeking rest for mind and body. I had
chosen this southern coast because it had always had a charm for
me. Its bold front&mdash;one of the gateways of England&mdash;that
has defied the elements for tens of thousands of years, no less
than the enemies who have turned their eyes towards England as
towards a promised land, is rich with the most stirring
associations. There is not a mile of the splendid sea front that
has not a perfect library of tradition&mdash;of stories weird, of
wild legends, of thrilling adventures, of magnificent heroism; and
he who can wander there and gaze out to the silver streak which has
girt us round with an inviolable barrier and not feel the blood
stir within him must be a soulless clod indeed.</p>

<p>On the day that I am instancing I do not think the weather could
have come nearer perfection than it was. A brilliantly star-lit
night, warm and odorous as that of some more southern clime, had
given place to a day of splendour. The sun god rose in a flame of
crimson, and the breeze of the darkness died clown till the sea,
like a burnished mirror of silver, flashed till the air was filled
with palpitating light. As night folded her star-gemmed robe, and
the golden glow in the east proclaimed the morn, I started from a
charming hostelry in one of those quaint and restful Kentish
villages where the very stones of the houses are saturated with the
brine of the ocean. My knapsack was on my back, my cares were few,
my heart was light, my destination anywhere where the night might
find me. I intended to keep in sight of the sea; to drink in the
ozone as much as possible; to dream and idle and loiter in
delicious indolence, throwing myself on the velvety turf when
tired, and refreshing myself when necessary from my frugal store of
bread and cheese, which I carried in my bag. To wander thus,
careless and untrammelled; to have no thought of the passionate
world, whose roar and moan go up from the great cities; to have no
fixed rout or destination; to feel utterly unconcerned about time,
and to be oblivious of the thousand and one abstruse problems that
vex the great heart of humanity, is to enjoy a sense of freedom, a
delicious vagrantness that turns life into a worldless poem. No
wonder that the untutored savage, used to the freedom of his vast
forests and boundless plains, pines and dies when the restrictions,
restraints, and artificial modes of living are imposed upon him by
so-called civilisation. No wonder that certain birds, when caught
and caged, burst their tiny hearts in their vain endeavours to
regain that liberty which to them <i>was</i> life, and to be
deprived of which is a cruel death.</p>

<p>Surely it must have taken primitive man many centuries to
accustom himself to the restraint of towns.</p>

<p>For me, I have ever been a worshipper at Nature's altar. I can
take my cares and sorrows, and, laying them at her feet, feel that
for the time my burden is lightened, and that I live.</p>

<p>I think it is John Stuart Mill who says, in one of his works,
'It is hard to die never having lived.' But, alas! tens of
thousands of people do not live. They exist, they have their being,
they die, but they have not lived. They have never known what it is
to thrill with ecstacy in the presence of a great mountain, to be
stirred with reverential emotions at the sight of the ocean,
whether it be in storm or calm, to dream dreams that have no words
as one wanders listlessly through some grand old wood, where a
world of subdued colour greets the eye, and the light that filters
through the branches of the trees transfigures&mdash;if I may be
allowed the expression&mdash;all the surroundings, until we seem to
be wandering through scenes of which we have read in poems. In
verity, he who has no love for Nature; he who has no sentiment for
beauty in its highest aspects; he who cannot rise above the
sordidness of a sordid world, knows not what it is to live. His
life is the life of a worm, it is of the earth earthy.</p>

<p>I have given expression to the thoughts that are associated with
that delightful day, because, when I wandered forth, the gyves of
duty having for the time being fallen from me, my calling was
forgotten. The many scenes of wretchedness, wickedness, and crime
that I had had to witness had faded away, and I saw only the
grandeur and the richness that Nature had lavished around. And yet
before the day was done I was destined to become an unwilling actor
in a remarkable little drama.</p>

<p>For some hours I wandered listlessly along until, on the summit
of a high cliff, I threw myself on the springy turf, and, lying at
full length on my back, gazed upward to the heavens, where little
masses of woolly clouds moved with a monotonous motion, and
produced in me a feeling that I was floating dreamingly in space,
and the great world was far, far beneath me. Some bees hummed
drowsily near me, attracted by a patch of sweet clover, and now and
again a sea-bird uttered its plaintive cry, or a passionate lark
poured forth a tempest of melody, as it soared upward into the blue
ether. But these sounds were Nature's notes of harmony; they formed
a lullaby that emphasised the silence, and begot a dreamy, blissful
languor that one word spoken by human lips would at once have
destroyed. I must have slept, and have slept long, and yet I never
seemed to lose sight of those slowly drifting clouds; never seemed
to cease to fancy that I floated through space; never ceased to
hear that drowsy hum, that plaintive cry, that passionate flood of
melody that made the very air palpitate. But sleep I did, and when
next a sense of my mundane existence stole upon me, a change had
passed over the scene, a change that had in it something of
weirdness. The silver flashing of the sea had ceased, and a purple
gloom had spread on the face of the deep. The ships, with their
white sails, thrown into bold relief by the gloom, appeared
unnatural. The water, as far as the eye could reach, was one vast
level plain, for not the faintest ripple broke its surface. The air
was absolutely stagnant. Not a sound arose. Either the birds had
gone to roost under the impression that night had come, or they had
been hushed into silence by the weirdness that was on sea and
land.</p>

<p>Far away the horizon line was sharp, rigid, and distinct, for
whereas the sea was purple, the sky itself was sepia, and this,
added to a certain rarefied condition of the atmosphere, caused the
ships to look as if they were suspended. Everything&mdash;sky, sea,
trees, grass&mdash;had become a neutral tint, as if one were
looking through deeply-smoked glasses on a sunless day.</p>

<p>This remarkable change from brilliancy, light, and colour to
deathly stillness and dun gloom was startling, for it seemed
unmistakably to presage mischief. There was a conspiracy on the
part of the forces of Nature, and presently there would be an
outbreak amongst these forces that might become terrible and
destructive. The fear of the unknown seemed to weigh on the birds
of the air and the beasts of the field alike; and the one sought
shelter in the holes and on the ridges of the cliffs, and the other
cowed under the trees and the hedges. Apparently I was the only
lord of creation' in all that scene; and the horrible calm and the
funereal gloom produced a scene of nervous depression that was
absolutely painful and distressing. It was already seven o'clock,
and not knowing how far I was from human habitation, I rose and
continued my journey. For some considerable distance my route lay
over an almost level plateau, that broke away suddenly in straight
cliffs, plunging down for something like five hundred feet to the
shore. But after a time the land dipped rapidly, and, going at a
great rate, I found myself on a level at last with the sea. On my
right was the Channel&mdash;on the left stretched away a bare and
barren moorland, broken up by sand dunes.</p>

<p>And now there came a strange sighing in the air, and on the
purple water there were white rifts, for the sigh was the sighing
of the rising wind. And suddenly there leapt from the far-oft
horizon seaward, and extended to nearly two hundred degrees of the
arc of the sky, a jagged flame that filled the air with an awful
light, leaving me blind for a few moments, and making the gloom
intenser; and five minutes later there rolled in from the south an
ominous and muffled peal of thunder. Darker grew the sky, and
sudden puffs of wind, warm almost as the breath of a sirocco,
whistled over the sand-hills, and bent down to the ground the
spare, wiry blades of grass that struggled for existence in that
arid waste. Once more was the air filled with flame, and now
enormous drops of rain began to patter down. Seaward a curtain
seemed to have fallen, and the ships were hidden from my view. The
tempest was raging out there, and the rain was lashing the sea into
foam. Not wishing to get drenched, although I was deeply interested
in watching the gathering storm, I hurried on, and ran to the top
of a high dune to see if there was any house near. A quarter of a
mile or so away on the shore line I spied a dwelling, and, getting
its bearings, I set off as hard as I could go, for I heard the roar
of the wind and the rain as they rushed in from the dark waters,
where now there seemed to hang a huge black pall.</p>

<p>As I neared the house I saw a signboard on a post, on the
seaward side, and in a few moments I was enabled to read on the
signboard that the house was 'The Fisherman's Rest.' I was
delighted, and considered myself highly fortunate in having so
opportunely found an inn. As I reached the door the storm burst in
fierce wrath. The wind shrieked demoniacally as it hurled itself
against the house; the thunder mingled its crash with the roar of
the gale; the rain seethed and hissed as it lashed the sea, that
tossed and tumbled now in foaming anger. Instead of the inn-door
being open for the storm-caught traveller, the house might have
been a house of the dead. The door was fast barred, the windows
were all closed, no smoke rose from the chimneys, and not a sign
nor a sound was there of a human being. I hammered on the door
impatiently with my stick, and hammered again and again before
there were any signs of life within. Then an upper window was
raised, and a woman thrust forth her head. She spoke no word, but,
after a hurried glance, she withdrew, shut the window, and soon I
heard her clattering down the carpetless wooden stairs. In a few
moments she flung the door open, and asked angrily&mdash;</p>

<p>'What do you want, master?'</p>

<p>'Well, I want refreshment and shelter from the storm,' I
answered, surprised by the roughness of the greeting. 'This is a
public-house, is it not?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Well, no&mdash;that is, we haven't got no licence now.
They tuk it from us.'</p>

<p>'Anyway, you will, perhaps, let me shelter from the rain,' I
remarked, as I stepped into the passage, 'and let me ask you why
you don't take your signboard down if you've got no licence?'</p>

<p>'Ay. Well, we've been for taking it down, but we ain't a had no
time.' The woman growled, and as it seemed to me, scowled at
me.</p>

<p>She was, I had almost said, an uncanny sort of creature, and had
I met her out there on the moorland I might have been inclined to
think she was an evil spirit. She was tall and lank, with an oval
face that was deeply wrinkled and puckered. Her skin was
cinnamon-colour by long exposure to sun and wind. Her hair, scant
in quantity, was iron-grey, and straggled in an unkempt fashion
about her low forehead. Her eyes, overhung by coarse, wiry
eyebrows, were deep set, without a kindly gleam in them. Her lank
body was clothed in a dirty, patched print gown, that clung about
her and displayed her bony angularities. She must have been at
least sixty years of age, but was straight and powerful-looking. It
was only too painfully obvious that I was not a welcome guest, and
I asked her how far it was to the nearest inn where I could get
lodging for the night.</p>

<p>'The nighest place is five miles off,' she answered.</p>

<p>That was by no means cheering information, for the rain now was
pouring down as if a second deluge had burst upon the earth; and
never, out of the tropics, have I seen lightning so brilliant and
so incessant. Had it not been for the rain, I should have enjoyed
watching the storm, for to my mind there is something sublimely
grand in lightning; but I confess to a very decided objection to a
drenching. So I asked this remarkable woman if she could not let me
remain for a time, and I would pay her for the accommodation she
afforded.</p>

<p>'Well, you see,' she answered, in somewhat pleasanter tones, 'as
I told you afore, we ain't got no licence; but if you like to come
in and take what I can give you, you can pay me what you like.'</p>

<p>I thought this was fair and honest of her, and my opinion of her
somewhat improved, since she seemed to be a respecter of the law.
She led the way into a small, low-ceilinged, stuffy room, where the
paper was peeling off the walls with damp. It had evidently been
the tap-room, for there were fixed forms all round, and small
fixed. tables. It was now getting quite dark, and she
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Bide a bit, and I'll get a candle.'</p>

<p>She went away, and was absent quite ten minutes, during which I
groped my way to one of the forms and sat down, relieving myself of
my dripping knapsack. At last she appeared, carrying a battered tin
candlestick, and shading the candle with her big, bony hand.. Are
you alone?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Yes. My daughter has gone over to the village, and the men-folk
are out fishing:</p>

<p>'Fishing!' I exclaimed. 'They will have a bad time of it,
surely, in a storm like this?'</p>

<p>'Oh, they're all right,' she answered with, as I thought, an air
of nonchalance and indifference, which, however, I attributed to
long familiarity with the sea and its perils, and I began to think
that her harshness and apparent cynicism were due to the hardness
of the life she had obviously led&mdash;a life that must have been
a never-ending struggle for daily bread. So I viewed her in a more
kindly light, and inquired, with a display of interest, why the
licence had been taken away?'</p>

<p>'Well, you see, the folk as had this place afore us used to sell
stuff out o' hours. It was an old man and woman and their son as
kept it. The man was drowned, and the son went to Australia, and my
man, who's a sailor man, bought the place.'</p>

<p>'Bought it!'</p>

<p>'Yes. Rump and stump. He gave two hundred pounds for it, as much
as it was worth, for it's just tumbling to pieces. But when we got
it, the Magistrate wouldn't let us have the licence any more, so we
just have to do the best we can for a living.'</p>

<p>My interest in the woman was naturally increased by this
information, and I said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, I know of no law that can prevent you dispensing
hospitality to a storm-driven stranger, and as I am roaming about
on holiday-bent, perhaps you can find me a shake-down for the
night, and give me something to eat, for I am tired, and as hungry
as a hunter. And before I leave I shall ask you to accept a present
from me for your kindness.'</p>

<p>She did not seem very eager to close with the bargain, and
considered for some moments before answering. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, if you don't mind the roughness, I can put you up for a
night, and we've got a barrel o' ale for our own drinking. You can
have some of that, and I can give you some cold beef and bread and
pickles.'</p>

<p>'That's capital,' I answered, and I'm your guest.'</p>

<p>So she went away to procure the eatables, and I walked to the
window and peered out. The sea was white with foam; the sky inky
black, save when the lightning lit it up, while the rain came down
in a sheet, so that I felt truly thankful even for the
accommodation of this lonely house, which was shaken by the
hurricane's might and drenched with the flying spume of the angry
sea.</p>

<p>Soon the woman returned, bearing a coarse clean towel, which she
spread on one of the tables as a cloth, and then placed the remains
of a joint of beef before me, together with a loaf of home-baked
bread, half a bottle of pickles, and a piece of rankish butter. She
went off again, and came back with a quart jug full to the brim
with foaming ale. I had to be content with a tin plate, a very
common knife, and a two-pronged steel fork, while a mug without a
handle did duty for a glass. There was a tin pepper castor, much
battered, a broken cup with some mustard in it, and a saucer
containing rough bay salt. An epicure with a dainty stomach might
have turned up his nose at this humble fare and primitive
<i>service de table,</i> but I had brought a robust appetite to
bear; and I did full and ample justice to the spread, while my
hostess sat and worked at knitting a stocking, and vouchsafed curt
answers to such remarks as I addressed to her.</p>

<p>By the time my repast was finished it was ten o'clock. The
thunder had died down; the lightning had become fitful, but the
rain still poured, and the wind howled.</p>

<p>Filling my pipe, I leaned back grateful for the meal, and
grateful for the accommodation.</p>

<p>'You've a pretty hard life of it here, missus,' I remarked.</p>

<p>'Ay,' she said with a sort of grunt.</p>

<p>'It must be dreary enough in winter.'</p>

<p>'God knows it is,' she exclaimed with a bitter, cynical sneer,
'but poor folk have to put up with anything.'</p>

<p>'Still, as you and your husband are the owners of this house,
you are better off than a good many people.'</p>

<p>'Bricks and mortar and rotten old timbers don't fill one's
belly, nor clothe one's back,' she growled almost savagely; and as
the subject seemed to have a tendency to make her angry, I let it
drop, and began to ask her questions about the country.
Nevertheless she was not mollified, and appeared to me to grow
restless and uneasy, and she paused in her work now and again, and
appeared to be listening intently. This led me to ask her if her
daughter would return that night, and she answered
gruffly&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes; I'm expecting her.'</p>

<p>'She'll surely have a dark and dreary journey if she intends to
walk?'</p>

<p>'Oh, she knows the way well enough, and knows how to take care
of herself. But ain't you going to bed?'</p>

<p>This question was asked so abruptly and snappishly that I
laughed and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, of course; if you want me to go, I'll go.'</p>

<p>'Come on then,' she exclaimed, as, rising suddenly, she seized
the candle and stalked out of the room. I thought her conduct
strange, but made no comment, simply following her. She led the way
down the passage, and, opening a door, ushered me into a fair sized
room at the back of the house. The furniture consisted of a very
old four-post bedstead, the bed being covered with a horse-cloth.
There were two or three flour casks in the room, and an old chest
of drawers and two or three chairs, each minus some of its parts.
The floor was carpetless, and black with dirt. There were a number
of oil skins, such as are worn by sailors, hung on pegs on the
wall, two or three sou'westers, and a huge pair of sea boots; and
in one corner of the room was a pile of fishing net. The place
reeked with a combination of smells, a fishy one prevailing.</p>

<p>'Are you a sound sleeper?' asked my strange hostess.</p>

<p>'Yes, as a rule, I am.'</p>

<p>'Does it take much to waken you?'</p>

<p>This question seemed to me rather a peculiar one, and for the
first time something like suspicion came into my mind.</p>

<p>'Well,' I answered deliberately, 'under certain circumstances,
no.'</p>

<p>She seemed as if she divined my thoughts, and
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, I only asked 'cos the men folk 'll be comin' in maybe about
twelve o'clock, and I thought their clatter might rouse you; but
you needn't be afeard. There's nought as 'll do you any harm.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm not afraid,' I said, 'and I daresay I'll sleep soundly
enough.'</p>

<p>'Well, good night to you,' and so saying she slammed the door,
and I heard her go down the passage.</p>

<p>Pondering on her questions and answers, I began to have visions
of all sorts of things that might have disturbed a nervous man, for
the house was lonely, very lonely, and murder might be done there,
and never brought to light. But I wasn't nervous. Nevertheless, I
examined the door, and I found it could be fastened on the inside
by a broad, flat, wooden bolt, sliding into a deep socket, and
which I was satisfied would make the door secure enough against
intruders unless great force was used to burst it open. Then I gave
my attention to the window. That seemed secure also, and moreover I
observed that it was protected on the outside by three iron bars.
In case I should have to fight, I had a stout oak stick, with which
I could have given a good account of myself, except, of course,
against firearms.</p>

<p>Being thus satisfied with my inspection, I began to prepare for
bed, when I remembered I had left my pipe, a favourite meershaum,
on the table in the room where I had had my slipper. So, opening
the door and taking the candle, I went for it, and when I reached
the room, I noted that a lighted candle had been placed on a high
stool in the window, and on dwelling on this, I concluded it was a
signal for 'the men folk' who were coming in from sea. Then I
dismissed the matter from my mind, and only partially undressing
myself, and placing the oak stick alongside of me, I lay down on
the outside coverlet of the bed, and very soon had sunk into a
sound slumber, noting, however, before I did so, that it was
half-past eleven by my watch as I wound it up.</p>

<p>Perhaps the strongest evidence that the suspicions I entertained
before retiring to rest did not make a very deep impression is,
that I slept soundly up to nearly four o'clock&mdash;a dreamless,
refreshing sleep, the result of a delightful day in pure, bracing
air. But suddenly I awoke with these words ringing in my
ear&mdash;</p>

<p>'What the devil did you take him in for?'</p>

<p>The voice was that of a man. It was guttural, bass, and
metallic, and somehow seemed to suggest a seafaring man, for there
was that rough ring in it which sailors acquire by having to exert
their voices so much when at sea.</p>

<p>As the question seemed applicable to me, I naturally felt an
interest. But moreover the voice had in it a growl of anger, if not
menace, so that my faculties were quickened. The man's brusque
demand was answered by a woman, and the woman was the one who had
entertained me. This is what she said&mdash;</p>

<p>'I took him in cos I thought we'd make a few shillings out of
him, and I wasn't sure about your coming to-night. I thought,
maybe, the storm would stop your running the cargo.'</p>

<p>'You're a fool,' snapped the man, gruffly. 'If I'd awaited cos
o' the storm, the hawks would a spied us soon as daylight come
in.'</p>

<p>'Well, you needn't trouble yoursel',' returned the woman. 'The
fellow's sound asleep, and you can have the stuff stowed in an
hour.'</p>

<p>'Well, if I thought as he wasn't asleep, shiver me if I wouldn't
drill a hole in him with my knife, for I ain't a going to lose this
haul for the best chap as ever lived.' Thus answered the man, and
the woman said in response&mdash;</p>

<p>'Go out, and bring the things, you fool, and don't stand there
growling like that. I tell you the bloke's all right. He told me he
was a having of his holidays, and was a tramping about to amuse
hissel, and he ain't likely to trouble us.'</p>

<p>The man made some reply which I couldn't catch, and then I heard
his heavy footsteps, telling unmistakably of big sea-boots, as he
went down the passage.</p>

<p>The few words I had caught put me on the <i>qui vive,</i> and I
realised at once that something wrong was going on. I slipped out
of bed and drew back the curtain from the window. The moon had
risen, and by its rays I was enabled to see the face of my watch,
and noted that it was five minutes to four. Then I heard the boards
creaking just outside my door, and I instinctively knew that the
woman was listening, trying to assure herself, no doubt, that I was
wrapped in slumber. Consequently, I remained very still, and
presently she went away. I did not light the candle, as it might
have betrayed me; but, dressing myself quickly and noiselessly, I
decided to try and find out what was going on. I knew that the door
of the house facing seawards was open, for the wind was blowing
directly in, and groaning and whistling through the crevices of my
door.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that my room was at the back of the
house. I found that the window looked on to a wilderness of a
garden, surrounded by a dilapidated and tumble-down fence. I tried
the window, and found I could open it easy enough, but the space
between the iron bars, to which I have already alluded, was too
small to admit of my passing through. A thin boy might have got
through, but not a full-grown man. I, therefore, had no alternative
but to wait the development of events.</p>

<p>The fresh air that came in when I opened the window was
delightful. The storm and rain had cooled the atmosphere, which was
heavy with the odours of flowers and of the sea. A fairly strong
breeze was blowing, and, as it stirred the foliage of the trees and
shrubs, it made pleasant music, that was varied by the chirp of a
night-cricket. The moon was shining brilliantly, but my view was
restricted to the garden, as the trees prevented one seeing what
was beyond. I should have liked to have gone out and roamed about,
drinking in the rich air that was saturated with the ozone of the
ocean. But the iron bars rendered egress by the window impossible
for me. So I crept back to the door and listened, and I heard two
female voices in whispered conversation. The one I recognised as
belonging to the old woman; the other was strange, but I guessed
that it belonged to the daughter. I could not gather what was said,
save a word here and there, which, however, gave me no clue to the
subject they were discussing, unless the following sentence did
so&mdash;</p>

<p>'He's all right&mdash;I tell you he's all right,' spoken by the
old woman with a rising inflexion and an emphasis of
irritability.</p>

<p>In a little while I heard the two women pass my door, go along
the passage, and, as I inferred, leave the house. Then a
silence&mdash;an absolutely impressive silence&mdash;followed, save
for the wind that still moaned through the crevices. I waited for
some minutes, almost holding my breath, to catch the slightest
sound. But everything seemed to indicate that for the time being I
was the sole occupant of the house. I, therefore, drew back the
wooden bolt as noiselessly as possible, opened the door, that
creaked a little on its hinges, and peeped out. I was enabled to
see right down the passage, and through the open doorway of the
front door. And this doorway framed a narrow strip of the beach and
the moonlit sea, making a remarkably striking picture. Nearly
opposite my room was another room on the other side of the passage.
The door was ajar, and I saw that a light was burning. I crept
across, pushed the door further open, and peered in. The window of
the room was closely blinded by, as it seemed to me, a piece of old
sail. Two candles were burning, each one stuck in a bottle, and on
the floor was a horn lantern with a light in it. The room seemed
full of lumber. There were oars, masts of boats, fishing'-nets,
pieces of ropes, old sails, blocks, &amp;c. But what interested me
most was an open trap-door. This was suggestive, and I resolved at
all risk to know what it meant. So I stepped into the room, lifted
up the horn lantern, and, holding it over the hole in the floor, I
saw that a ladder went down to a cave or cellar, and I thought to
myself&mdash;</p>

<p>'That place, as sure as I'm alive, is a receptacle for
contraband goods, and the people of this lonely house are
smugglers.'</p>

<p>I restored the lantern to its former position, and as it was
evident that no one else was stirring, I stole along the passage,
and peeped out very cautiously The scene was beautiful, for the sea
was silvered by the moon, and there were lines of white foam on the
sandy beach. But in the foreground of the picture was a group of
figures including two women and three men. A large boat with one
mast was riding at anchor some distance out, and I saw a small
rowing boat coming from this boat towards the shore. The doorway in
which I stood was in shadow, for the moon being high shone on the
back of the house. It thus gave me an advantage, as I could see
without being seen, and I was perfectly convinced now that I was
alone in the house, so I waited and watched.</p>

<p>In a few minutes I saw the little boat shoot through the surf,
and she was pounced upon by the men and women, and hauled up on the
beach. Then the two women and their companions lifted things out of
the boat and came towards the house, so I hurried back to my room,
and barred the door again. In a few minutes they entered the house
with subdued noise, and they went into the room where the lights
were burning. Presently I heard the man, whose voice had wakened
me, say&mdash;</p>

<p>'Stow them kegs, Jack, in th' well. Devil himself won't find 'em
there.'</p>

<p>About a quarter of an hour elapsed, and the woman crept to my
door and listened, then said&mdash;</p>

<p>'There ain't a sound. He is sleeping all right.'</p>

<p>I could not help smiling, and thought to myself, 'Fate has gone
against you this time, my good woman, and your sin has found you
out.'</p>

<p>Once more they all left the house, and some of them were
smoking, for there was a powerful odour of very strong tobacco.
Then ensued another spell of silence, during which I opened my door
and stole forth again, and I watched this little band of
smugglers&mdash;for smugglers I hadn't a doubt they were&mdash;go
down to the beach for another load.</p>

<p>I should have liked very much to have descended into that cellar
or cave where they were stowing the things, but I was doubtful if
there would be time before the people returned. And I did not deem
it prudent, either in my own interest or the interest of justice
itself, that I should be caught playing the spy. I could not have
hoped to successfully tackle all the band, and if I had managed to
get away, and gone off for assistance, it was pretty certain that
the smugglers would have taken means to effectively hide all traces
of their illicit trade.</p>

<p>My position was certainly a peculiar one, and but for the storm
I should hardly have made the discovery I had made. It did occur to
me to conceal myself in the room where the things were being
secreted, and I hurried to the room to see if it were practicable
to do so. But I came to the conclusion it was not, without grave
risk of being found out. The candles and the lantern were still
burning, and, seizing the latter, I descended the ladder a few
steps, and, holding the light up, I peered into the gloom. The
light was too feeble, however, for one unaccustomed to the place to
see much; but I made out that it was a vaulted cellar, and that the
floor was littered with boxes and other things.</p>

<p>I got up again and went back to my room, only barely in time
before the people returned. In fact, I was not quite sure that they
had not seen my retreating form, and for some minutes I waited in
suspense, grasping my oak stick, and expecting to hear them
battering at my door. They gave no evidence, however, that they had
seen me. And as I did not think I could gain any more knowledge
then than I had already gained, I lay down on the bed and soon fell
asleep.</p>

<p>It was half-past eight when I awoke. It did not take me long to
perform my toilet, and that done I went out. No one seemed to be
stirring, but the front door was open.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning, all light and brilliancy and motion,
for the sea was dancing in the breeze, and short, crispy waves
seemed to be chasing each other merrily on the shore, making a line
of foam that, being caught up by the wind, was blown inland like
feathers, and the spray as it was thrown up in the lines of light
scintillated with the prismatic hues of the rainbow.</p>

<p>As I sauntered forth I observed the woman whose acquaintance I
had already made, and a young and by no means bad-looking woman, of
about four-and-twenty, sitting on a bench in the sunlight not far
from the door, mending a fishing net.</p>

<p>'Good morning, mister,' exclaimed the elderly woman as soon as
she saw me. Then she looked at me very keenly as she asked: 'Did
you sleep well?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' I said, 'very well,' and not wishing her to question
me further on the point, I asked: 'Is this your daughter?' alluding
to the young woman.</p>

<p>'Yes, that's my gal.'</p>

<p>'And not a bad looking girl either,' I remarked.</p>

<p>'No, she ain't so bad,' said the mother, with a touch of genuine
pride.</p>

<p>'Is she married?' I asked.</p>

<p>'No; she's engaged to a sailor who's away to&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Where is it he's gone to, Nellie?'</p>

<p>'To Valparaiso.'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes, that's it&mdash;Val&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Paraiso,' added the girl, as her mother paused again.</p>

<p>'Yes, that's it,' repeated the old woman, but without venturing
to pronounce the name of the place this time, for it was obvious
that she found the pronunciation difficult. Then she added with a
sigh' I wish he were here now, lass, and would take you away. He's
a good lad, and will do better for you than your father will
do.'</p>

<p>The girl made no answer, but to me the remark was significant,
and it gave me the opportunity of asking if the father was in.</p>

<p>'Oh, ay; he's sleeping in now. Him and the lads was out at sea
all day yesterday, and didn't get on shore till nigh on daylight,
so they're pretty tired.'</p>

<p>'You have some sons, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I've three on 'em, and there are two nephews what lives
with us, and my husband's partner.'</p>

<p>'What partner is that?'</p>

<p>'The chap as has got a half share in the boat.'</p>

<p>'And do the whole lot of you live by fishing?' I inquired, with
an air of innocence.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed; and bad enough living it is. Sometimes in winter
the men can't get out at all.'</p>

<p>'Then you starve?' I suggested, a little sarcastically.</p>

<p>'Well, we come most nigh it sometimes.'</p>

<p>It was on my tongue to ask her if the men folk' had brought home
a cargo of fish the last night and what they had done with it; but
I checked myself, for I saw how the question might raise
suspicions. So I said instead&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, can you give me any breakfast, for I want to be
moving!'</p>

<p>'Nellie,' she said to her daughter, 'go and get the gent.'s
breakfast ready.'</p>

<p>So Nellie rose and went into the house, and I strolled down on
the shore. The small boat had been pulled up high and dry, and the
large sailing-boat was anchored some distance out, and I saw that
the name painted on her was 'Nellie Bell.' As I sauntered back to
the old woman I asked her if her family name was Bell, and she told
me that it was, and that the boat had been called after her
daughter.</p>

<p>For some little time I stood and chatted about the weather, the
country, and the crops, until Nellie appeared at the door and
beckoned me to go to my breakfast, which consisted of some fairish
coffee and a dish of ham and eggs.</p>

<p>Somehow I felt interested in the girl and engaged her in
conversation, and gradually learned that she and her family had
lived in Ramsgate, and had a fairly good business as fisher folk.
But one or two bad seasons, followed by the loss of their nets and
boats in a tremendous storm, involved them in difficulties, and
with a little money her father had in a building society he bought
the house they were then in which was going to be pulled down, so
that he got it cheap.</p>

<p>'And do you like living here?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Indeed no,' she said with energy. 'I wish to goodness I was out
of it. I've been trying for a long time to get a place as a
servant, and I was over in the town yesterday seeing a person, but
I don't know whether I'll get anything or not. It's awful dull
here,' she added, 'and me and my father don't get on very well
together.'</p>

<p>'Then if you'll take my advice,' I answered, 'you'll do anything
that's honest rather than stay here.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'd clear out to-morrow if I could,' she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Promising her that I would interest myself in her behalf I rose
from a very substantial breakfast just as the old woman entered. I
rewarded her suitably for her attention and hospitality, and
bestowing a small <i>douceur</i> on Nellie, took my departure much
disappointed at not having seen the men folk; but exhausted, no
doubt, by their nocturnal labours, they were all 'sleeping in.'</p>

<p>The delightful feeling of <i>insouciance</i> that I had enjoyed
on the previous day was for the nonce gone, as I had a duty to
perform now that I was bound to respect. I was truly sorry that it
had fallen to my lot during my holiday to have to lay information
against these people. But even had my calling been other than it
was, I should still have been bound, as an honest man, to report
the discovery I had made, for it was only too clear that the
interesting Bell family were making a business of defrauding their
country's treasury. That was a serious offence, and as a
representative of the law's majesty I could not hold my peace.</p>

<p>The morning was full of that glory of fresh beauty which is so
conspicuous in fine weather after a heavy thunderstorm has relieved
the air of its superabundant electricity. The deep blue sky was a
study in its masses of fleecy clouds that tempered the too ardent
rays of the sun. The rain had laid the dust, so that the air was as
clear as crystal. The sea was one great mass of scintillating
light, and the sailing craft seemed instinct with joyous life as
they sped before the fresh breeze; while from the ethereal heights
poured down a flood of passionate melody from the throats of the
soaring larks. The landscape was a wonderful picture in its lights
and shades, its gradation of colours, its ever varying outlines,
its great stretches of fields green as emerald with grass, or
tinged with gold where the corn was fast ripening. Then there were
patches of woodland so suggestive of shade and dreamy stillness;
and farmhouses, em-bosomed amongst trees, dotted the land, and were
varied by the numerous windmills, whose sails spun merrily round in
the bracing breeze.</p>

<p>My enjoyment of all this beauty was somewhat marred by the
disagreeable duty that had so unexpectedly devolved upon me. But I
had to submit, so made my way to the town, some five miles' distant
from that lonely house by the sea; and, arrived there, I lost no
time in giving information to the coastguard people, whose business
it was to attend to the matter.</p>

<p>So far, then, my part in the matter ended, but I may chronicle
what followed. Eight or nine stalwart coastguardsmen, armed, and
led by an officer, marched to the Bells' residence, taking the
people by surprise, and demanding to know if they had any
contraband goods on the premises. Of course, they denied that they
had, and the 'men folk,' who seemed disposed to offer resistance,
were placed under arrest, and a search took place. It is highly
probable, however, that but for my having overhead the remark about
the well the search would have been fruitless of any result, for in
the actual cellar itself there was nothing but a quantity of old
boxes and packing cases, which the Bells said were being gradually
broken up for firewood. But, owing to the information I had
furnished, a very careful inspection was made of the floor, and
under a heap of old boxes a trap-door was found, so skilfully
devised, however, that it might well have escaped any but the most
thorough search. When this trap was raised it revealed a large
bricked recess, and in this was found stowed, evidently by those
who had been used to stowing things in a ship's hold, nearly half a
ton of plug tobacco, and a great quantity of French brandy and
German 'raw' spirit, besides nearly a hundred boxes of common
cigars.</p>

<p>When the Bells heard that their ingeniously-planned hiding-place
had been brought to light, they were furious, for the goods found
represented a large investment of capital. They had the good sense,
however, to see the utter hopelessness of resistance, and they were
marched into the town, while a guard was placed over the things
until they could be removed, which was done in the course of the
day, and, news of the discovery having spread, a large number of
people wended their way out to the old house, actuated by the
merest curiosity.</p>

<p>Further investigation proved, beyond doubt, that the Bells had
followed smuggling for a long time, and made it a very profitable
business, for, in spite of Mrs. Bell's statement to nee about the
poverty of the family, they were found to have a banking account of
several hundred pounds. On the night that I passed under their
roof, the men had been out in their smack to mid channel, where, by
pre-arrangement, they had met a French schooner, and had received a
quantity of tobacco and brandy from her.</p>

<p>Of course the den of smugglers was broken up, all their property
was confiscated, and very heavy fines were imposed, and as the men
were unable to meet them, they were sentenced to various terms of
imprisonment, and, if capable of reflection at all, they must have
come to the conclusion that, after all, honesty is the best
policy.'</p>

<p>It only remains for me to say that I did not forget my promise
to Nellie, and I was successful in getting a philanthropic lady in
London to interest herself in her, with the result that Nellie
subsequently obtained a situation as a domestic servant in a very
good family. I heard later on that she had married her sailor lad,
who had voyaged to Valparaiso, and after that I lost sight of
her.</p>

III. &mdash; TRACKED BY A FOOTPRINT<br>
THE STORY OF A STRANGE MURDER</h2>

<p>ONE autumn morning, more than a quarter of a century ago, I was
urgently requested by telegraph to go down into one of the English
Midland counties to investigate a case of murder, and endeavour to
track the criminal. The telegram came from the Chief Superintendent
of Police of the district, and it expressed a strong desire that I
would start off immediately, as the crime was surrounded with a
good deal of mystery, and though five days had elapsed, not the
slightest clue to the criminal had been obtained.</p>

<p>I had already heard of the murder, and felt interested in it,
and though it put me to considerable inconvenience, I complied with
the Superintendent's request, and set off from the North, where I
was then stationed.</p>

<p>I remember perfectly well that it was a raw, sombre, gusty day,
full of the sadness of dying things, and calculated to beget in any
one with a tendency to moralise a depression of spirits, if not
absolute melancholy. Everywhere the trees seemed to be shivering in
the rude gusts of cold wind that swept over the land, filling the
air, and strewing the ground with withered leaves. The sky was like
a sheet of lead, and, turn which way the eye would, no warmth of
colour gladdened it. I could not help thinking, as we sped over the
lonely and desolate mountain moorland, known as Shap Fell, where
all nature wore an aspect of savageness, and the wanton wind seemed
to rave with passionate fierceness, that it was a fitting day to
deal with murder. Of course that was mere sentiment; but when all
is bright and gladsome, when the sun shines brilliantly, and the
earth is carpeted with flowers, do not our minds dwell more readily
on life, and hope, and pleasure a And death at such a time is apt
to strike us as a startling and strange incongruity&mdash;at any
rate, death by violence. When I reached my destination as far as
the train could take me, there was an eight miles' drive before me.
The Superintendent himself met me with a dogcart. The day was
darkening to its close; the wind had freshened; rain was beginning
to fall, and a funereal pall seemed to have been dropped over the
land.</p>

<p>As we drove along the dismal country road that was bordered with
trees looking gaunt and spectral in the gloom, and which twisted,
and writhed, and creaked, and groaned every time the blustering
gusts lashed them, as if they were suffering actual pain, the
Superintendent told me the following story:&mdash;</p>

<p>About twenty-two years previously, there had come to the
neighbourhood a man by the name of James Naylor. He was a native of
Manchester, and at that time was thirty years of age, or
thereabouts. His trade was that of a bricklayer, and he worked as
an ordinary labourer for some time. He was married, his family
consisting of his wife and a son, who, however, was not his wife's
son, but an illegitimate child, then seven years of age. This fact
was made known by the wife herself. James Naylor was notable for
two things. Firstly, a magnificent physique, that gave him the
strength of a giant; secondly, a peculiar exclusiveness and
reticence. By exclusiveness I mean that lie held himself aloof from
other people, and was never to be seed in the village
public-houses, where numbers of his class congregated. His
reticence, which seemed to be shared by his wife, prevented people
from learning anything of his past life or of his present affairs.
But notwithstanding this, he was considered to be very respectable;
and though his wages were only about thirty shillings a week, he
paid his way regularly, and was never in debt. Two or three years
after coming, to the village he became possessed of a few hundred
pounds through the will of an uncle, who had gone to Australia and
saved a little money. Mr. Naylor did not make this information
public himself, but people got to know of it through advertisements
inserted in the Manchester and other papers for James Naylor, as
the executors and lawyers did not know where he was. Strangely
enough, Naylor's attention was drawn to the advertisements by the
narrator of the story&mdash;that is, the Chief Superintendent of
Police, with whom I was riding. He had taken a fancy to Naylor
owing to his steady habits, and his respectful, quiet demeanour.
And he was the only person in the village that Naylor seemed to
cultivate any acquaintance with. Of course Naylor went off to
Manchester at once to the address of the solicitors mentioned in
the advertisements, and two months later he returned, and almost
immediately he made a bid for about ten acres of pasture land that
had long been in the market without finding a purchaser. This land
was the residue of an estate in the hands of trustees; but being so
far from a railway station, no one would buy it.</p>

<p>On one occasion Naylor had said to the Superintendent, when they
happened to be passing this very field, and, as he looked up at the
board announcing 'This Land for Sale,' 'I wish I had the money to
buy that land, I'd make a fortune.' Asked how the fortune would be
made, he showed no disposition to enter into any explanation, and
the subject dropped. The offer that Naylor made for the land,
although very low, was ultimately accepted, and the bricklayer's
labourer became a landed proprietor. This occasion was the only one
on which he was ever known to display outward manifestations of
delight. And so overjoyed was he that he collected a number of his
acquaintances together, and treated them to ale and bread and
cheese t the village public.</p>

<p>Of course much wonder was expressed by the villagers as to what
he was going to do with his purchase, for, as pasture land, his
estate was worth little or nothing, and as the trustees had been
unable to sell it for building purposes, although there was a good
deal of building going on in the district, it was not considered at
all likely that Naylor would have any better luck. But Mr. James
Naylor showed himself to be longer-headed that any one else round
about, for he soon proved that his land consisted of a magnificent
stratum of brick-clay. How he himself got to know this before he
purchased must ever remain a mystery; that he did know it was
evidenced in many ways, and it was speedily made pretty clear that
when he told the Superintendent that, if he had the land, he would
acquire a fortune, that he spoke within the mark.</p>

<p>In the course of six months of his entering on possession, he
had erected a row of wooden sheds, and had begun operations as a
brick manufacturer with a staff of five workpeople&mdash;three
women and two men. As there was no other brickfield at that time
within a radius of quite thirty miles, Naylor had a monopoly, and
so shrewd and keen did he prove himself to be in business
transactions, and so punctilious in keeping his engagements, that
people said his bricks were turning to gold. But his great
opportunity did not come until four years later, when a wealthy
London Trades Guild decided to build in this neighbourhood, owing
to its salubrity, a very large Orphan Asylum, and Mr. James Naylor
received the contract to supply the whole of the bricks and tiles
necessary for the work. A little while before this he had begun to
make tiles, the clay being peculiarly suitable for them. As he was
still the only manufacturer within thirty miles, he was enabled to
get an excellent price for his goods. And the number of his
workpeople, which had been gradually increased, now reached a
hundred, including his own son, who was then between fourteen and
fifteen. He was placed in the office as a sort of under clerk, but,
though he inherited some of his father's taciturnity, he did not
seem disposed to follow in his father's footsteps, as he showed a
preference for idleness and loafing about.</p>

<p>It is necessary to state that at this period of his career Mr.
Naylor had become a widower, his wife having died suddenly in a fit
about eighteen months before. And now, much to the surprise of
every one, and to the heart-breaking disappointment of some of the
village belles, who looked upon him as a most eligible partner for
life, he made it known that he was going to marry again, his choice
being a young woman who had been a chambermaid in Lord
B&mdash;&mdash;n's family, who resided in a magnificent old mansion
ten miles from the village. His lordship took great interest in
Naylor, and not only gave his wife a very handsome present on the
occasion of her marriage, but advanced him a large sum of money to
enable him to increase his plant, and erect new and improved
machinery.</p>

<p>This development of his business brought Naylor increased
prosperity, and as time went on children were born to
him&mdash;three daughters and a son&mdash;and Naylor was, as far as
people could judge, a happy and contented man. It was a matter of
common talk, however, in the village that he and his illegitimate
son did not get on well together. The youth had been christened
Robert; and, though he was taciturn and in certain respects moody,
he was disposed to run wild, and, though under twenty years of age,
he gave way occasionally to drinking habits. Those who were in a
position to form an opinion said that this preyed very much on
James Naylor's mind, for he had given evidence that he was strongly
attached to his wayward son. At last the climax was reached, when
young Bob' Naylor committed a brutal assault on a man with whom he
had been drinking in a public-house. The two of them quarrelled,
and Bob struck his companion over the head with a pewter pot,
felling him to the ground. Not content with that, he kicked him
severely, fracturing one of his ribs, and inflicting several wounds
on the poor man's face and body. For this outrage Bob was brought
before the Justice of the Peace; and, though he pleaded drunkenness
as an excuse, it was felt that some exemplary punishment should be
meted out. Nevertheless, the magistrate, out of respect for James
Naylor, hesitated to send the lad to prison, and actually remanded
him, letting him free on his father's bail, while he took counsel
with his brother magistrates. But Naylor himself expressed a wish
that no leniency should be shown to the youth simply because he was
his son, and the end was, as the assaulted man had been seriously
injured, Bob was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment, the majority
of the villagers even considering that an exceptionally lenient
sentence.</p>

<p>At the expiration of the young man's term of imprisonment he did
not return to his father's house, but on the very morning of his
release took train to Liverpool, and it was subsequently rumoured
in the village that he had shipped on board of some vessel and gone
abroad.</p>

<p>It was noted that, after this little and unfortunate incident,
James Naylor looked very dejected, and displayed an
absent-mindedness that was unusual with him. But in a few months
the effects had apparently passed off, and he was himself again. As
regarded his business, nothing seemed in the slightest degree to
retard its success.</p>

<p>As evidencing Mr. Naylor's shrewdness, it may be mentioned that,
when he made his original purchase, there were rumours that an
adjoining estate, consisting of some ten or twelve acres with a
small farm, was likely to be thrown on the market in the course of
time, and Naylor, with far-seeing judgment, got the solicitors who
were acting for the owners to give him a written contract that, if
it was decided to sell, he should have the first offer at a stated
price. The solicitors, knowing how land had been a drug in the
market in that region, thought that this was an uncommonly good
bargain on their part, as they were sure of a customer immediately
they wanted to sell. But they saw the affair from another point of
view, when at last they were compelled to offer the estate for
sale. Land had gone up in value very much then, for Naylor had
improved the neighbourhood considerably, in conjunction with his
patron, Lord B They had built a number of handsome villas, and let
them to a superior class of tenants; and, as his lordship was one
of the directors of the adjacent railway company, he obtained a
provisional promise from his co-directors that, when the village
was a little more developed, they would ask for powers to construct
a loop-line of about sixteen miles, which would embrace this
village, and another one about four miles off. The consequence of
all this was, land nearly doubled in value, and the solicitors,
with the grasp and greed peculiar to their class, tried to get out
of their bargain with Naylor, even going to law over it, but, as
every one predicted they would do, they lost their case and were
compelled to sell to Naylor at the price originally agreed upon,
and he thus more than doubled his holding.</p>

<p>Soon after this he erected for himself a very handsome villa,
into which he removed his family on the completion of the
house.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Naylor was now a wealthy man, lived in fairly good
style, and kept a horse and rather stylish trap for the use of his
wife and children, he made no pretensions to be anything but what
he was&mdash;a labouring man, who by shrewdness, industry, and
uprightness, had gained influence and a fortune. He was very
greatly respected, and had his ambition led him in that direction,
he could have put J.P., if not M.P., after his name, and have got
appointed to many positions of trust and responsibility. But he
declined all such honours, and contented himself with founding a
working man's building society and savings' bank, making it his
hobby, and displaying so much energy, that he soon had a very long
list of members, and the society flourished, as everything else
seemed to do that Mr. Naylor associated himself with, and, of
course, the working men of the neighbourhood were greatly
benefited. And so highly were Mr. Naylor's efforts in this
direction appreciated that, five years after the founding of the
society, a strong desire was expressed in the neighbourhood that
some acknowledgment of Naylor's attempt to improve the working
classes should be made, and the result was a sum of over a thousand
pounds was subscribed for a testimonial, which took the form of a
full-length oil painting of himself, a handsome service of plate,
and an exceedingly handsome gold chronometer watch, bearing a
suitable inscription. There was no doubt Naylor was very proud of
these things, for, as he himself modestly said at the presentation
dinner, nothing could have afforded him keener gratification than
this acknowledgment, on the part of his neighbours and friends,
that his humble strivings to be an honest and useful man had not
been altogether without results.</p>

<p>Of course, such a man was not likely to make a retrograde
movement, and his future career was marked by the same steady
application, the same progress, and unswerving fidelity to duty.
For some years he almost, but not quite, suspended his brick-making
operations, as an opposition had started in the neighbourhood, but
Naylor said that they would exhaust their land in five years at the
most, and he could afford to wait. He proved a true prophet; and
the opposition having ceased business, he commenced to re-develop
his, and broke new ground. Extending his operations in all
directions, his business began to assume gigantic proportions, and
people predicted that James Naylor, the once bricklayer's labourer,
would die a millionaire. They did not, however, see the grim hand
of ghastly murder that was hovering over the poor man. Had it not
been for this, the predictions might have been fulfilled.
Nevertheless, although not a millionaire, he was certainly rich
when the grim hand struck him.</p>

<p>Such, then, were the interesting facts in connection with this
man, as they were told to me by the Superintendent on that dismal,
drizzly night as we drove to the little town. I may mention here
that arrangements were then in progress for connecting it with the
main line of railway. The bill had passed the House of Commons, the
route had been surveyed, and Mr. Naylor had hoped to see the line
commenced immediately, for it was a pet scheme of his. He knew, of
course, it would benefit himself, but he knew, also, it would
benefit the neighbourhood generally, and so he had thrown himself
heart and soul into the business. A cruel fate, however, doomed
that he should never witness the beginning of the work, for five
days previous to this journey of mine James Naylor had been found
in one of his brickfields battered, hacked, and crushed out of
life. To use the Superintendent's own words, no more horrible or
brutal murder had ever been committed in the county. 'Brutal,' in
fact, hardly described it&mdash;it was savage, fiendish, almost
beyond credence.</p>

<p>It can well be understood that a crime of this kind, having
regard to the man's career and his position, should produce a fever
of excitement, and cause a sensation unparalleled in the district.
His widow and children were plunged into inconsolable grief, for he
was a faithful husband, a just and upright father, and this grief,
it may be said, was shared by the whole village; and, when it was
remembered how greatly Naylor was respected, and how much good he
had done, people were amazed that he of all men should have become
the victim of murderous passion; and what made the crime more
mysterious and incomprehensible was, that it had not been committed
for the sake of robbery, because Mr. Naylor's presentation watch
was found on the body, together with a sum in cash of over twenty
pounds. Revenge, therefore, seemed to have been the motive which
had prompted the murderer. One person was suspected&mdash;a
brickmaker&mdash;a sullen, disreputable fellow of powerful build,
who had been discharged several times for drunkenness, and taken on
again; but at last Mr. Naylor had so lost patience with him, that
he vowed he would give him no more work.</p>

<p>'Although we have made every effort,' continued the
Superintendent, 'to get some evidence against this man, we have
quite failed. Whoever killed Mr. Naylor must have been a powerful
man, because a struggle had taken place, and Naylor was possessed
of so much strength that he could not have been overcome easily.
The man I speak of has all the strength to have done the deed, for
he is even more powerful than Naylor was; but, though his clothes
have been examined with the greatest care, not a spot of blood
could be found upon him. Besides, inquiries leave little doubt that
he spent the evening in a public house, and, two hours after the
house closed, he was found sleeping on the high road by a rural
constable, three miles at least from the brickfields. He had not
then recovered from the drink he had taken, and when roused up was
dazed and stupid. Nevertheless, we still have the fellow in
custody, as we got a remand for a week, but my own strong
impression is, we shall have to let him go unless something like
evidence should crop up. Of course, we have not ceased our efforts
in other directions, but I am sorry that we have got no clue. I
resolved, therefore, by the advice of the magistrates, to send for
You, and we are hopeful that you may be able to unravel the
mystery, and bring the criminal to justice.'</p>

<p>'Five days,' I answered, 'have given him a good start, unless,
of course, the man you have in custody to-day is the right man. If
he is not, I confess it seems to me that the chances of success are
decidedly against us.'</p>

<p>'That's precisely my view,' answered the Superintendent
despondingly. 'And it strikes me that poor Naylor's death will go
unavenged.'</p>

<p>'Is he buried yet?' I inquired.</p>

<p>'No; the funeral takes place to-morrow, so you will be able to
see the body. I have the ground where the murder took place
carefully boarded over, and everything is precisely as it was when
the body was found.'</p>

<p>I complimented my companion on his astuteness in doing this, and
having secured a room in the hotel which Naylor himself had built
in anticipation of the opening of the new railway, I wished him
good night, and promised to set to work as soon as daylight
broke.</p>

<p>I passed a somewhat restless night, for my mind was full of the
work that lay before me; and when seven struck I was glad to turn
out of bed, although a more dismal, cheerless morning it would be
difficult to conceive. All the landscape was cold, grey, and sodden
with rain, while a piercing east wind chilled one to the marrow. As
there were only a few hours intervening between then and the time
when the mortal remains of James Naylor would be for ever hidden
from men's sight, I hurried off to his house, as I felt that in
some respects it would be an advantage to me to view the body.</p>

<p>I shall not harrow my readers' feelings with details of the
sight I gazed upon. It is sufficient to say that the wounds and
mutilations were horrible, and they suggested that the murderer had
been actuated by some frenzied passion, otherwise why did he batter
his victim in such a way? There were at least twenty fearful
wounds, and any one of those wounds was sufficient to have caused
death.</p>

<p>The Superintendent had in no way exaggerated when he described
Naylor as having possessed a splendid physique. Indeed, I do not
know that I ever saw a finer man. He had a massive chest, a
remarkable muscular development, and great length of arm, which
suggested that he must have been able to deliver a
sledge-hammer-like blow; and, taking all these points into
consideration, the inference was that he had been taken
unawares&mdash;attacked suddenly and stunned. No other hypothesis
would account for so powerful a man being overcome so easily as it
seemed was the case.</p>

<p>My next visit was to the medical gentleman who had performed the
autopsy, and he told me that his opinion was the first blow had
been delivered on the back of the victim's head with some blunt
instrument; that the blow had been such a tremendous one that it
had crushed in that of the skull, injuring the brain, and so
rendering the poor fellow powerless, although he might have feebly
struggled for a few moments. The weapon with which this blow had
been struck was, he thought, either a brick or a heavy piece of
Wood. He was sure that, immediately the blow had been delivered,
the victim dropped to the ground like a felled ox, though probably
he sprang up again, and made an effort to defend himself. In
battering the head, face, and neck of the victim about as the
murderer had done, he must have been spurred on by some blind,
unreasoning fury. That coincided entirely with my opinion, and it
led me to make inquiries whether any one in the community had borne
ill-feeling for the deceased. But there seemed to be a very decided
consensus of opinion that he was so universally liked that nobody
in his sane senses could have borne him a grudge. In fact, the
people round about were indignant at the bare suggestion that the
murderer was amongst them. They were unanimous in declaring it must
have been a stranger.</p>

<p>'But why a stranger?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Ah! that was a matter they were not prepared to answer.'</p>

<p>I pointed out that the stranger's motive in committing the crime
would probably have been robbery; but Naylor's watch and money had
not been touched. I could understand that the criminal might have
hesitated about possessing himself of the presentation watch, as it
was calculated to prove a most damning piece of evidence against
him. But the twenty pounds or over in hard cash was another thing.
Surely a man who resorted to the dreadful crime of murder for the
sake of robbery was not likely, unless under peculiar
circumstances, to have let twenty pounds go when he might have
taken it without increasing in any way the risk he had already run.
But, in spite of this argument, the people doggedly stuck to their
opinion that a stranger had done the deed.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that a man was in custody on suspicion
of being the murderer. This man's name was Robert Arkwright, and he
was locally known as Big Bob.' He belonged to the neighbourhood,
having been born in the parish; and the worst that people could say
about him was that he was a drunken, lazy fellow. He was accounted
an exceedingly good worker when he would work, and it was well
known that Mr. Naylor had interested himself in Big Bob, trying to
reform him, and never refusing to give him work during his periods
of sobriety, for it appeared that Bob sometimes swore off,' and
would not touch drink for three or four weeks. Then he would break
out and go on the spree, as it is called, so long as he could get a
penny to spend. Although the Superintendent had spoken of Bob as a
'sullen, disreputable fellow,' he had never been known to do
anything against the law, and not a soul could be found who had
ever heard Bob utter the slightest threat against Mr. Naylor. On
the contrary, it was agreed that he always spoke very well of his
employer, and he frequently expressed surprise that Naylor put up
with him as well as he did.</p>

<p>Of course I had an interview with Bob. He seemed to be greatly
affected by the suspicions against him; and when Naylor's death was
spoken of, Bob shed unmistakable tears. He was an exceedingly
powerful man, and might have overcome Naylor if he had half stunned
him by the first blow, but I was of opinion that Naylor would have
been more than a match for him unless partially disabled.</p>

<p>On leaving Bob, I came to the conclusion he was not the
murderer. The deductions that led me to this conclusion were partly
of a psychological and partly of a physiological nature, and I may
here anticipate a little by saying that as no evidence was
forthcoming to connect Bob with the crime, he was discharged two
days later. So far, then, the crime was involved in mystery, and
the long start the murderer had got gave him a very decided
advantage, and the possibilities were that, unless he betrayed
himself by some act of folly, he might succeed in baffling us. It
is necessary now that I should describe with some minuteness the
actual scene of the crime. Mr. Naylor's works occupied something
like fifteen acres of land, and this land was much cut up by the
excavations that had been made for the clay. In one of these
excavations a pond had been formed, the water being used for the
brickmaking operations. Near this pond a small brick and wood house
had been erected, and Mr. Naylor had his office here. From several
parts of the field this house was not visible owing to the brick
kilns. Nor could it be seen from the high road, which was exactly
one hundred yards two feet away, and was separated from Mr.
Naylor's land by a wooden railing and a thickset hedge. This road,
roughly speaking, ran north and south, but at right angles with it,
and going west was a narrow lane that, though not on Mr. Naylor's
property, he had acquired by purchase a right-of-way through for
his cartage. One part of this lane was within twelve yards of the
pond. It was bounded by a hedge and an old railing, and a
five-barred gate gave entrance to the brick fields near the pond.
The lane was three-quarters of a mile long, and ended at a farm.
Between the door of the house and the office used by Mr. Naylor and
the edge of the pond was a space of about thirty-six feet, and it
was in this space the crime was committed. Mr. Naylor was in the
habit of coming to this office, sometimes in the evening, after the
day's operations were over, as he gave a good deal of personal
attention to his books, and he could be quiet and secluded here.
The little house stood quite by itself, and behind it was a wooden
shed used for storing coal. The ground all round was stiff,
tenacious clay, that was easily impressed with anything bearing
upon it.</p>

<p>Now, the murder had not been committed inside the house, but
outside. And this argued that the murderer was acquainted with
Naylor's habits, for he was in the habit of locking himself in the
cottage when working there, in order, no doubt, to keep out
intruders. The windows were protected by iron bars and wooden
shutters, and given night-time, and a light inside, anyone outside
could see through the chinks of the shutters where they had shrunk
and warped.</p>

<p>I could not resist the theory, which seemed fully warranted,
that the murderer lay in wait for his victim, for he must have
reasoned that, if he broke into the house, Naylor would have time
to put himself on the defensive. But when he came forth from the
glaring light of his lamp to the pitchy darkness of the night, and
not suspecting danger, he would be an easy prey He always had a
bull's-eye lantern with him on dark nights, and this lantern had
been round on the ground intact. The space between the door of the
house and the edge of the pond was well-marked with footprints that
twisted and turned about and ran one into another, thereby
indicating clearly enough that there had been a struggle. The
Superintendent had had the forethought to see that this part of the
ground was kept intact until it had been thoroughly examined by an
expert, and in order to preserve it from the weather, it had been
carefully covered over with boards and a piece of tarpaulin.</p>

<p>It was clear enough that Mr. Naylor was leaving his office when
he was struck down; because the key had been found in the door and
the lock was already turned, but he had not had time to withdraw
the key before the first murderous blow was given. The frontage of
the house was about forty feet, and between one of the gable ends
and the door was a space of ten feet. Anyone hiding behind this
gable end might with a spring have pounced upon his victim, and
have knocked him down as he was in the act of locking the door. And
that that was the course pursued I felt pretty sure by the
footprints.</p>

<p>I examined the ground with the greatest care, and found two
distinct sets of footmarks. The one had been made by Mr. Naylor's
boots, which contained three rows of nails, but the other was the
impress of boots that had iron-shod heels and iron plates at the
toes, and one of these plates&mdash;that on the right
boot&mdash;had a piece broken out which had left a sort of V shaped
gap.</p>

<p>I saw immediately the value and importance of this footprint as
a possible clue, and with the utmost care I had a block of clay,
containing the best defined imprint of the boot, dug out. It was
then conveyed in charge of a constable to the nearest town to an
Italian image moulder, who was requested to male a plaster of Paris
cast from the clay, and so well did he do his work that he got an
absolutely perfect impression of the boot worn by the murderer, for
could there be a doubt that the man who had worn that boot was the
man who had done poor Mr. Naylor to death?</p>

<p>In the meantime, I directed my efforts to trying to discover
with what weapon the crime had been committed. If that could only
be found, it would, as I knew, afford another very important
possible clue.</p>

<p>The nature of the wounds on the dead man's body left no room to
doubt that they were the result of powerful blows dealt with a
blunt instrument&mdash;a brick, the medical men suggested, or a
bludgeon. On reasoning the matter out I came to the conclusion that
something in the nature of a bludgeon was far more likely to have
been used than a brick, because a brick would have necessitated the
murderer being almost in contact with his victim when he struck the
first blow, and raising the brick in both his hands in order to
bring it down with the crushing effect which was only too painfully
apparent in the dead man's head. Now, although this action might
not have occupied more than two seconds of time, it was necessary
to presuppose that Naylor was so absorbed as to be altogether
unconscious that a man was immediately behind him, if the brick
theory was to be accepted. But, as opposed to this, I ascertained,
by questioning his family, that he was a cautious man, and knowing,
owing to the loneliness of the spot at night, that outrage was
possible, he had a habit of throwing the light from his bull's-eye
round about the house as be emerged, in order to detect anyone who
might be lurking about. His widow told me that she had sometimes
expressed nervousness about him, and he used to assure her that he
had no fear, and was all right; and as a precautionary measure lie
always kept a loaded revolver in his desk at the office, and for
the rest he relied on his own personal strength and a stout oak
stick that he invariably carried. This stick was found leaning
against the portal of the door, where he had evidently placed it
while he turned the key in the lock. It was therefore
unquestionable that that particular stick was not the weapon that
had been used to do the murder with.</p>

<p>Although, as I have already stated, I saw good reason for not
believing that a brick had been the instrument of destruction, I
examined scores of bricks that were lying about, using a magnifying
glass of great power for the purpose, but without any result. The
hedges, the adjoining fields, the lane, were all diligently
searched, but yielded nothing that would help us.</p>

<p>My attention to these matters was looked upon by the local
police as a useless expenditure of time, and it was hinted that I
had better try and discover the murderer.</p>

<p>That is what I am trying to do,' was my answer. But one person,
who was more blunt of speech than polite, said I was not likely to
find him if I did nothing else but examine bricks through a
magnifying glass.</p>

<p>To this I ventured to reply that, in my humble opinion, the
reason the local people had so signally failed to get any clue to
the murderer's whereabouts was their neglect to search for such
signs as he might have left behind him. I reminded them further
that it was said of the great naturalist Cuvier that, if a single
bone of an animal was given to him, though he did not know to what
animal the bone belonged, he could build up a perfect skeleton
representing the defunct animal, so a detective, who was one by
instinct, and who knew his business, could oftentimes, if he got a
definite clue, build up an accurate theory of a crime that, in many
cases, might enable him to track down the criminal.</p>

<p>I found that even the Superintendent was inclined to share the
views of his subordinates, and he laid stress upon the fact that he
had noticed the footprints in the clay, and had had them carefully
covered up, and that some attempt had been made to try and find the
weapon that Naylor had been killed with. But he frankly admitted
that the attempt had been of a very perfunctory nature, for it was
thought more desirable to send men out east, west, north, and south
to endeavour to learn if a suspicious-looking man had been seen. I
pointed out that, in their eagerness to get signs of the man afar,
they had forgotten one very important point, which was that the
murder had evidently been well planned by someone whose motive was
not robbery. Therefore the murderer would have taken such
precautionary measures as might be calculated to ensure his safety
after the crime.</p>

<p>The murder had been discovered soon after six o'clock in the
morning, when the brickmakers commenced work. But when medical aid
was summoned the doctors were positive in their assertions that the
deceased had been dead several hours. It will, of course, be asked
how it was his family had not missed him. I asked the same
question, and was informed that sometimes when he went to his
office like that it was very late when he returned, and by his own
particular request no one sat up for him. He would let himself in
with a latch-key, and having partaken of his supper, retire to rest
without disturbing anyone. Consequently the first intimation of the
murder was conveyed to the family by a constable, and up to then
they had not been aware that he had not come home as usual.</p>

<p>In trying to fix the approximate time of the murder, I gathered
that the victim rarely, if ever, stayed in his office after
midnight, and sometimes he left long before that. But let it be
assumed that he stayed on that particular night to the outside
limit of his usual time&mdash;that is to say, he left at twelve
o'clock&mdash;and a few minutes after that he was a corpse. It
followed, therefore, that between then and the discovery of his
body six hours had elapsed. That gave the murderer a pretty long
start, and if he was a fair walker, he could be a good many miles
away from the scene of the crime when daylight broke. Now, twelve
miles off was a considerable village, and every morning, Sunday
excepted, a train left that station for the south, and it was
generally filled with working men going to their work, as it
stopped at all the little stations between there and a large town
eight miles away. Let it be supposed, therefore, that the murderer
had acquainted himself with this fact&mdash;and it was probable he
had&mdash;he could easily have covered the twelve miles, have got
into that workmen's train without attracting any attention, and so
escaped without leaving a trace behind him.</p>

<p>It is a fact, and I am bound to state it, that the local people
had quite overlooked these little probabilities, and they had gone
about the highways and the adjoining villages virtually crying out,
'Have you seen a murderer?' whereas a little logic brought to bear
would have been sufficient to convince them that the man who
planned and carried out that terrible crime was not likely to have
run the risk of being captured red-handed by lingering near the
scene of his dark deed, always assuming that he did not belong to
that district. And there were very many reasons for coming to the
conclusion that he did not. But the whole truth of the matter is
this&mdash;When the police laid hold of 'Big Bob,' they made cock
sure,' as the saying is, that they had got the man they were
seeking, and naturally their vigilance was relaxed to the advantage
of the criminal. I honestly confess that there were grounds for
suspecting Bob at first, but I assert that that was not a
sufficient reason for ceasing to look for some one else who might
equally be an object of suspicion.</p>

<p>I saw only too clearly that my only hope of being successful was
to get some tangible clue at the spot where the deed was done, and,
by following that clue, get on the track of the villain. In the
footprint there was such a clue, but I felt that my hands would be
considerably strengthened could I discover the weapon that had been
used to batter out Mr. Naylor's vitality.</p>

<p>'Have you had the pond dragged?' I asked the Superintendent.</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' he answered, 'I did not think it was of any use doing
that. A man was hardly likely to throw a stick or bludgeon into a
pond, for wood has the property of floating.'</p>

<p>'It has,' I replied, 'unless, to use an Irishism, that wooden
stick or bludgeon was made of iron, but even a wooden stick will
not float if it is tied to a brick, and is there not a possibility
that, in this particular instance, the murderer, if he was very
anxious to rid himself of his fearful weapon, might, if it was a
stick, have attached a brick to it, and have pitched it into the
pond?'</p>

<p>The feasibility of this was too apparent to be pooh-poohed, and
the Superintendent agreed with me that it would not be a bad thing
to drag the pond. We at once set to work to do this, constructing a
rough raft for the purpose.</p>

<p>The water was in places twelve feet deep, and owing to the clay,
was somewhat the colour of pea-soup. The bottom, too, was soft and
slimy, so that it seemed not unlikely our labour would be without
fruit.</p>

<p>If I had been of a less sanguine disposition I should very soon
have given the business up, or rather if I had been less
persevering, but it was so utterly contrary to my nature to give in
because my first efforts looked hopeless that I pegged away in
spite of certain little sarcasms of some of the local police, who
from the very first had been at no pains to conceal the fact that
they looked upon me as an intruder, and probably an upstart. A
crowd of chawbacons, too, had collected round the pond, and,
seeming to think it was an occasion for personal enjoyment and
coarse wit, they indulged in chaff at my expense, and made me a
butt for their meaningless laughter. All this, however, was to me
like water to a duck's back. It had no more effect. I had my duty
to perform, and not laughter, nor coarse jest, nor sarcasm, could
turn me from that duty.</p>

<p>At length, after three hours' work, the very primitive dredger
we were using brought up from the ooze a life-preserver, consisting
of a stiff piece of gotta percha about an inch thick, rendered
formidable by a round bullet at the end, weighing six or seven
ounces, and worked all over with string.</p>

<p>'Eureka!' I exclaimed. 'That is the weapon that killed Mr.
Naylor.'</p>

<p>The appearance of the life-preserver seemed to work a change in
the feelings of the good people who thought I was wasting time; and
even the most lightheaded amongst the crowd of country gawbees who
had jeered me changed his tone, and gave vent to his views by
saying: 'I'm blarmed if that theere thing baint th' bludgeon what
knocked Maister Naylor's brains owert.'</p>

<p>I was strongly of opinion myself that it was the identical
weapon which had been used by the murderer, though there was the
possibility that it was not. But a minute examination revealed the
fact that the loaded end of the weapon was much battered, and still
adhering to it were several hairs, which were recognised as similar
to the hair of the late Mr. Naylor's head. The doctors admitted
that such a weapon might have produced the wounds which were found
on Naylor's body.</p>

<p>Here, then, I had two important clues; first, the footprint;
second, the life-preserver; and they suggested to me two things.
The one was, that the boots were such as a tramp or a navvy might
wear, and that, therefore, the murderer belonged to the vagrant or
the working classes. The other was that he had procured the
life-preserver for the express purpose of committing the murder,
which was, <i>à priori,</i> planned and premeditated. If I was
correct in this theory, it followed that the crime had been one of
revenge, and robbery had formed no part of the motive. Now, who was
likely to cherish revengeful feeling against Naylor, if it was not
some one of the villagers or his workpeople? As regards his
workpeople, I found that many had been with him for years, and not
one had been in his employ less than six months. All these people
bore the reputation of being unusually well-behaved for their
class, thanks to the exertions of their employer, who displayed the
most lively interest and concern in their welfare. To add to their
comfort, he had built a row of excellent cottages, which he let to
them at a nominal rent. He had also built a large recreation room,
well provided with books, papers, and periodicals. For twopence a
week any one of his workpeople was privileged to use this room
whenever he liked, and here he could smoke his pipe and be supplied
with a limited quantity of wholesome beer at a low price. In fact,
by common consent, Mr. Naylor was admitted to have been one of the
kindest and most excellent of employers, who was ever trying to
teach his employés habits of prudence, self-respect, and frugality.
He also offered a premium every year to the man or woman employed
by him who had the most money standing in his or her name in the
local savings bank at Christmas. He was, therefore, a friend and
benefactor to them all, and the question naturally arose, why
should any of these people have wanted to kill their best friend a
And, in fact, the most careful inquiries failed to elicit the
slightest thing that would have justified a shadow of suspicion
against any of them, nor could I learn that any one in the village
had ever been heard to threaten Naylor, so that I was forced to the
conclusion that the murderer was a stranger, and had come from
afar. It would have been mere affectation for me to have said that
I was not dubious about the issue of my investigations, having
regard to the time that had elapsed and the mystery that
unquestionably surrounded the crime. But let it not be supposed for
a moment that I was altogether hopeless. A man who begins a task,
no matter what it is, with a feeling that he will not succeed,
never does succeed. But I had no such feeling, and I began to weave
out a theory as to why the murder had been committed, and where the
murderer had gone to afterwards.</p>

<p>Now as to the motive. It seemed to me undoubtedly revenge,
unless the crime had been perpetrated by some half or wholly mad
person. And the manifest ferocity of the deed suggested the strong
probability of frenzy, and I kept that in view. Then as to the way
in which the murderer had escaped. I have mentioned that at a
distance was a large village, or perhaps I should say a small town,
for it had a population of eight thousand. Eight miles from this
place was one of the huge hives of industry with a population of
three hundred thousand, and a large number of working men who had
their employment in the larger town resided in the smaller one. In
all directions, taking the scene of the crime as a centre, were
plenty of small villages, but no town of any size nearer than the
one I speak of. The murderer had displayed so much cunning that I
could not think it likely he would run the risk of showing himself
in any of these small places, where a stranger would necessarily
attract a great deal of attention. So I came to the conclusion that
he had gone south to the big manufacturing city, and there I
resolved to seek for him, and I mainly relied upon the cast of the
footprint to track him down. The cast was perfect in its way. The
plastic nature of the clay of the brickfield rendered it one of the
best of mediums for receiving impressions, and had the murderer
only thought of that, he would have been more careful. But he
overlooked it, and the result was I had got a most excellent model
of the sole of his boot. But what made it doubly valuable as a
piece of evidence was the V shaped fracture in the toeplate. A
hundred men might have worn boots with the toe part of the sole
protected by a piece of iron or steel, and impressions taken of
these soles would, in a general way, have been so much alike that
it would have been difficult to distinguish one from the other, but
here was a detail that might be of the highest possible value as a
link of evidence, given that that particular boot could be
found.</p>

<p>My first inquiries were directed to trying to discover if any
one had recently purchased a life-preserver in the town, and, to
this end, I caused a circular to be distributed amongst the
tradespeople who dealt in such things, and also amongst the
pawnbrokers. So thoroughly was this done, with the valuable aid of
the local authorities, that not a shop or a pawnbroker was missed,
and in about a fortnight's time a man called one day at the head
police station to make the following statement: About a month to
six weeks before&mdash;he could not fix the precise date&mdash;a
man came into his shop and asked to see some life-preservers.' This
tradesman, whose place of business was in one of the poor quarters
of the town, dealt mostly in secondhand things, and his stock in
trade was of a very miscellaneous character, ranging from
second-hand clothes to brass candlesticks. The customer drew
attention on himself because he was so hard to please, and could
not find one that was heavy enough for him. At last he selected
one, and paid two-and-sixpence for it. The tradesman described this
customer as a thick-set, powerful-looking, middle-aged man, with a
remarkably sullen expression of countenance, and striking
restlessness of the eyes.</p>

<p>'Although at the time,' said the tradesman, 'I did not attach
much importance to the fact of this fellow buying a life-preserver,
I did think to myself I should not care to meet him on a dark night
in a lonely place.'</p>

<p>He was pictured as being poorly dressed, with a very sulky and
scowling face. Although the tradesman had noticed his customer
pretty minutely he could not say what sort of boots he had on.
Shown the life-preserver, the tradesman instantly recognised it as
the one he had sold to the man; and he gave unmistakable evidence
of his accuracy, for, scratched with the point of a knife-blade on
the extreme end of the weapon&mdash;not the loaded end&mdash;was
the shopkeeper's private mark, showing what the article had cost
him. This mark was in very minute characters, but they were
perfectly distinct when examined through a glass.</p>

<p>Here then was a discovery of the very highest importance as
bearing on the crime, and it proved pretty conclusively that the
criminal purchased his murderous weapon in that town with the
premeditated object of slaying Naylor, and having accomplished the
fearful deed he had flung the instrument of death into the clay
pond, thinking, no doubt, that it would never see the light of day
again. Presumably the murderer resided in the town, because it
seemed out of accord with commonsense that a stranger should go to
that particular place to buy a weapon wherewith to commit a murder.
At any rate, that was my idea; and though I am aware of the danger
of attaching too much importance to mere speculative theories, I
have generally found by experience that, in arguing on such crimes
as that I am dealing with, it is pretty safe to assume that
ordinary people follow ordinary rules. Therefore, my assumption was
that the man who had been guilty of destroying Mr. Naylor's life
had strong personal motives for doing so. That necessitated the
inference that he knew Naylor, knew his habits and his movements,
and had either been in his employ or had had transactions with him.
And if this was correct, what more probable than that he lived in
the town?</p>

<p>Acting on the idea, I tried to find out, by searching inquiries
at his house, whether Mr. Naylor had business transactions with any
particular person or firms in the town. And I learned from his
books and papers that he dealt with three or four firms, and with
one he had had extensive transactions. The name of this firm was
Hooper &amp; Hooper, and they manufactured all the tools and
implements used by brickmakers; besides which they were engineers
and made pumps, iron pulleys, chains, trolleys, and similar
articles used in the brick trade. They were consequently large
employers of labour; and it seemed to me not at all an improbable
idea that amongst their labourers Naylor's murderer might be found.
With a view of putting this to the test, I put myself in
communication with Messrs. Hooper &amp; Hooper, and they very
readily consented to do all that they possibly could in the way of
helping me to elucidate the mystery. They had been well acquainted
with the murdered wan, who visited them whenever he was in the
town. They spoke of him in the very highest terms, as in fact every
one did, and they said, in their opinion, he was a model man, and
one of the most generous of employers, therefore his cruel murder
was all the more mysterious, seeing that robbery had evidently not
been the motive.</p>

<p>Hooper &amp; Hooper employed altogether about a hundred and
ninety men and boys, and these were apportioned to the various
departments.</p>

<p>On the occasion of my first visit I was shown through the works
by a member of the firm, and I directed my attention to
scrutinising the various employés, but there was nothing in any one
of them that attracted my particular attention, for my scrutiny was
necessarily of a cursory character. Moreover, I was particularly
anxious to avoid raising their suspicions in any way as to the
object of my visit, for, if it became known who I was and what my
business was, my object might have been defeated.</p>

<p>The pay day of the firm was on Saturday, between twelve and one,
and the mode of payment was as follows: The men passed in single
file before a little window with a pigeon hole at the bottom.
Behind the window in a small office sat three clerks, one to call
out the workman's name, another to check the pay sheet, and the
third to place the amount on the shelf at the bottom of the pigeon
hole, so that the person entitled to the money lifted it as he
passed along the narrow passage formed by a wooden barrier. I asked
for, and obtained, permission to be present in this office on one
of the pay days, so that I might have a fair view of the face of
every man as he passed the small window, which framed the face, as
it were, and thus emphasised its most salient features.</p>

<p>If it has not struck the reader already, I may state that my
chief object was to try and discover a face that tallied in any way
with the face of the man described by the shopkeeper who had sold
the life-preserver. For I went upon the assumption, supported by
circumstantial evidence, that the murderer was a working man, that
he lived in that town, that he knew Mr. Naylor well, and cherished
some spite against him, and that, therefore, it was probable he was
in the employ of some house with which Naylor had had dealings;
that, by some means for which it is impossible for me then to
suggest even the shadow of a feasible theory, Naylor had given
offence to this particular man, who, having a ferocious and brutish
nature, had resolved to murder him.</p>

<p>It was a bitter winter day as I took up my position in the
office, and placed myself in such a way that I could see every face
distinctly as it came within the space embraced by the
window-frame. The atmosphere outside was thick with fog, and a
chilling, depressing gloom prevailed everywhere, and was not
dispersed by the gas that it was necessary to burn.</p>

<p>One by one the grimy faces passed the window, presenting to my
keen and anxious gaze a series of living portraits. I was conscious
that the situation was a strange and highly dramatic one, capable
of being turned to good account by a novelist or dramatist.</p>

<p>Suddenly a face appeared at the window that immediately riveted
my attention, for it came near realising the mental picture I had
drawn of the man described to me by the shopkeeper as the person
who had bought the life-preserver. It was a sullen, brooding face,
with restless eyes, that had in them a latent fierceness. This an
had appeared in answer to the call of 'William Chadwick,' and his
face impressed itself so deeply upon me that I could not dismiss it
even after its owner had passed out of my range of vision.</p>

<p>When the business of paying was over, I made some inquiries with
regard to William Chadwick, and was informed that he had only been
four months in the firm's employ. His position was that of a
labourer in the chain department, his wages twenty-five shillings a
week. Beyond that the firm knew absolutely nothing about him. He
came and went, did his work, received his money, and there the
connection between him and his employers ended. There was
sufficient in these little details, coupled with a facial
resemblance he bore to the man who purchased the life-preserver, to
arouse my keen interest, and I set about finding out more about
him. Amongst his fellow-workmen he was regarded as a very quiet
man, who never talked about himself. He was considered to be
exceedingly passionate when excited, and from the fact that his
arms, hands, and breast were much tattooed, it was thought that he
had been a seafaring man. He was very reticent, however, about his
past history, but he had stated that he came from Liverpool. I
inquired upon what grounds he was considered to be passionate, and
the following incident was related in evidence thereof:&mdash;</p>

<p>One day a piece of iron fell upon his foot, and he was so
enraged thereby that he seemed to become a madman, and, seizing a
sledge-hammer out of the hand of a fellow-workman, he smashed the
piece of iron into fragments, snorting and foaming with his
uncontrollable rage.</p>

<p>This characteristic fitted in with my theory of the murderer.
The ferocity displayed spoke of just such a disposition, and my
interest in William Chadwick increased.</p>

<p>Of course I had no difficulty in discovering where he lived, and
I found that he was a lodger, occupying a room in the house of a
man named Bradburn, who was a night watchman in a large foundry.
Bradburn had a family of eight, including his wife, and five of the
children&mdash;two girls and three boys&mdash;went out to daily
labour. With this family Chadwick had lodged ever since he came to
the town, and he was regarded as a very quiet but somewhat
eccentric man. The room he occupied was a back bed-room, and when
in the house he usually kept to his room, though occasionally he
joined the young men in the kitchens and smoked with them, for he
was a great smoker.</p>

<p>So far, then, although Chadwick answered in some respects to the
description of the person who had bought the life-preserver, I had
not a scrap of evidence against him such as would have justified
his arrest on suspicion. My next move, therefore, was to take
Bradburn into my confidence, and get his permission to allow me to
make an examination of Chadwick's room. This permission was readily
accorded, and, as the lodger and most of the family were out all
day, there was no difficulty in the way.</p>

<p>My first attention was directed to trying to find out if
Chadwick possessed a pair of boots that would have done for the
model of the plaster cast I had. And in this connection another
suspicions element cropped up. Four weeks previous to
this&mdash;that is, just after the date of the
murder&mdash;Chadwick bought a new pair of boots, agreeing to pay
eighteen-pence a week for them, at a shop where Bradburn and his
family dealt.</p>

<p>But what was, perhaps, still more suspicious, he wore his Sunday
clothes for a day or two about the same date; and then he asked
Bradburn to introduce him to a shop where he could get a suit of
work-clothes on credit. This was done, and he provided himself with
an entirely new rig-out. This was certainly a significant incident,
and I began to think that the signs were thickening, and that the
finger of Nemesis was pointing unmistakably to Chadwick as the
slayer of Mr. Naylor.</p>

<p>My first inspection of his room did not lead to any discovery.
It was a pretty large room, containing an iron bedstead, a
washstand, a dressing-table, a chest of drawers, two or three
chairs, and some odds and ends. The floor was partially covered
with pieces of carpet, and the house being old the boards were
uneven. A second inspection led me to note that in one part of the
room it seemed that a couple of boards had recently been disturbed,
and this induced me to make a closer examination, and I found that
the boards would easily lift up; and, deeming it probable that the
space between the floor and the ceiling of the room beneath might
have been utilised as a secret hiding-place, I procured a candle,
and was enabled to discern some dark object lying on the laths. I
had soon drawn it out. It proved to be a boot&mdash;a heavy lace-up
boot, with an iron shod heel, and a plate at the toe. The plate was
perfect&mdash;that is, it had no chip like a V in it; but it was a
left boot, and my cast represented the boot of the right foot. With
almost feverish excitement I searched the space again, and lo, and
behold! the other boot was there, and the plate on the sole had a
piece broken away that corresponded exactly with my plaster cast.
Both these boots were stiff with having been sodden with wet, and
they were covered with mud and stains. I had now no longer any
doubt that I had run the murderer down; but, before proceeding to
arrest him, I had the boots carefully examined by an analytical
chemist, who expressed a strong opinion that the stains on the
leather were stains of blood. They seemed, in fact, to have been
soaked with it, for some of it had got into the lining inside. The
dirt that still adhered in lumps to the hollows beneath the heels
was pronounced to have particles of clay amongst it.</p>

<p>My course now was clear, and I lost no time in arresting
Chadwick. In order to avoid a scene at the house where he lodged, I
arrested him as he was leaving his work. At first he seemed
staggered; he grew pale, and a wild, fierce light caeme into his
eyes. But with an effort he controlled himself, and, smiling
cynically, he said&mdash;' It's easy enough to arrest a chap for
murder, but you've got to prove it against him.'</p>

<p>'I expect to be able to do that,' I answered.</p>

<p>Having got him safely secured, I directed my efforts to trying
to find the clothes that he had worn with the boots, but in this I
was unsuccessful. He had probably destroyed them; but why he had
not destroyed the boots was remarkable.</p>

<p>His first examination before the magistrate led to a remand, and
during the interval I found out that, on the night of the murder,
he was not at home, and I could find nobody who could say they had
seen him. The man who had sold the life-preserver was brought
forward to identify the prisoner, and, though he would not swear to
it positively, he asserted that, to the best of his belief,
Chadwick was the man to whom he had sold the weapon. Some of the
clay still adhering to the soles of the boots was contrasted with a
sample brought from the scene of the crime, and was found to be
identical. The sole of the right boot fitted the plaster cast
accurately, so that there could be no reasonable doubt that it was
that boot which had made the imprint in the clay, and the man who
had worn the boot was Mr. Naylor's murderer. Chadwick denied that
he was the owner of the boots I had found, but Bradburn and members
of his family identified the boots as having been worn by the
lodger. The consequence was, William Chadwick was committed for
trial at the assizes, and in the meantime efforts were wade to
strengthen the evidence. We learned that Chadwick had lived in
Liverpool under the name of John Mellor, and had worked as a
labourer about the docks, and it was understood by those who knew
him that he had been a sailor, and sailed in almost every sea.</p>

<p>Very little further evidence was forthcoming, but it was felt
that the circumstance of the footprint was in itself so powerful
that it was strong enough to hang the prisoner. In the meantime
Chadwick preserved an extraordinary and sullen silence. He
absolutely declined to give any account of himself, or say whether
he had any relatives, and not a single soul came forward to claim
relationship with him. As he had no means for his defence, counsel
was appointed; but he said that he didn't want counsel&mdash;that
he had nothing to tell him, and he didn't care whether he was
hanged or not. When he was brought up for trial, it was noted that
an extraordinary look of melancholy had settled on his face. He
seemed utterly indifferent, and to be entirely absorbed within
himself, as if he took not the slightest interest in anything.</p>

<p>With the exception of the two young children, every member of
the Bradburn family swore that the boots had been worn by Chadwick;
and the man who sold the life-preserver was almost positive
Chadwick was the man who bought it, although he would not swear to
it. The prisoner's absence from the town on the night of the murder
was placed beyond doubt, and it was also proved that he returned to
his lodgings about six o'clock in the morning, and immediately
after went to his work with his Sunday clothes on.</p>

<p>The case for the prosecution was considered clearly established;
but, as the defence was insanity, and in view of the prisoner's
strange behaviour since his arrest, it weighed with the jury, and
the verdict was one of wilful murder, coupled with a strong
recommendation to mercy on the ground that the prisoner seemed to
be subject to aberrations of intellect.</p>

<p>Two days after his condemnation, Chadwick startled the world by
not only confessing to the murder, but adding to the confession
that the murdered man was his father, he (the prisoner) being an
illegitimate son. He averred that he had taken a great dislike to
his father from an early age, as he thought he did not treat him
well. After his conviction for the assault he committed on a man in
a public-house, and of which mention has been made in the early
part of this narrative, he made a solemn vow that, if ever he got
the chance, he would kill Naylor. On his release from prison he
went to Liverpool, and shipped as an apprentice on board a Black
Bail liner, and he continued to go to sea for many years. During
all these years his hatred for his father never lessened, and,
learning that Naylor was prosperous, he got employment with Hooper
and Hooper, so that he might know something of his father's
movements; and on several occasions he went down to the village at
night, and, finding that Mr. Naylor was in the habit of going to
his office in the brickfield at night time, he resolved to cut his
career short in the very midst of his prosperity. He was actuated
solely by a revengeful feeling, and scorned to touch a penny of the
dead man's money. The murder was carried out much in the way that I
conjectured. The criminal lay in wait, and struck his victim down
the moment he came from the office. After the first blow Naylor did
spring up, and struggled a little with his assailant, but he soon
grew faint from the effects of the first blow, and was speedily
rendered utterly unconscious. After the crime Chadwick tramped to
the nearest station, and on getting back to his own place, he found
that his clothes had been literally drenched with blood, and he
resolved to destroy them, and, pending the opportunity to do that,
he hid them underneath the floor, together with his boots. He
subsequently took the bundle of clothes, entirely forgetting the
boots, and cast them in a lime-kiln in the suburbs. That
forgetfulness about the boots was the means of his undoing, and was
as remarkable a circumstance as ever I remember in connection with
a murder case. But for those boots the criminal would never have
been convicted.</p>

<p>Such was the story of this foul, unnatural crime, but it not
only served to strengthen the feeling that the murderer, if not
actually mad, as understood, was a brooding, melancholy monomaniac,
and ought not to be hanged, so the jury's recommendation was
allowed to take effect, and the death sentence was commuted to
penal servitude for life. The wretched man's life, however, was
destined to be a short one. Periodically violent fits of frenzy
seized him, and on one of these occasions congestion of the brain
supervened, and killed him three years after his conviction.</p>

IV. &mdash; THE STORY OF A DARING DEED</h2>

<p>THAT the commission of crime requires a certain amount of
boldness and daring goes without saying, although in some cases,
perhaps, crime is the result of a terrible and desperate despair,
and does not indicate any of the qualities of true courage. In
fact, it may be argued, and with a fair show of reason, that
criminals are, as a rule, cowards of the worst kind. In a sense
this is correct, for cruelty and cowardice are almost inseparable,
and criminals are, generally speaking, invariably cruel. But I have
known men of the criminal classes display such an amount of
sterling courage and indifference to suffering and death, that one
could but regret it had not been exercised in a different and
worthier cause.</p>

<p>These remarks are suggested by a curious case with which I had
something to do years ago. It was during the time I was attached to
the Glasgow staff, and the season was winter. Some weeks previously
a burglary had been committed at a house situated near Hyde Park
Gate, London, and several thousand pounds' worth of jewellery and
plate had been carried off. The London police had been unable to
capture any of the gang, for there was reason to believe it was the
work of a gang, and the authorities at Scotland Yard were greatly
annoyed, more particularly as the press had accused the police of
'stupidity,' 'laxity of duty,' 'pig-headedness,' and all the rest
of it. The fact is, public indignation had been aroused by a series
of very daring burglaries in the Metropolis, supposed to have been
committed by the same gang as those who had succeeded in carrying
off such a large amount of swag from the Hyde Park house. These
robberies had been planned so skilfully, and carried out so boldly,
that the police had been quite baffled, more particularly as the
criminals had not confined their operations to any particular
locality. One night they worked in the north, then in the south,
the next in the west, and so on&mdash;even the East End coming in
for a share of their attention. The result was, the authorities did
not know where to look for them next, for the rascals showed no
partiality for any particular locality. The leader of these clever
housebreakers was said to be a very notorious character, who was
known amongst his kind as 'Leary Dan,' but whose real name was
Daniel Wray. This man had already served several long terms of
imprisonment&mdash;in fact, the larger portion of his life had been
passed in prison, for his antecedents were of the worst possible
kind. His family for generations had been criminals. He had
inherited the taint, and made his first appearance in a police
court at the early age of ten. Leary Dan was described as an
extraordinarily powerful man, standing about five feet ten and
a-half, with a muscular development that enabled him to accomplish
seemingly impossible feats. What rendered him still more dangerous,
perhaps, was a certain natural suavity of manner, and a
plausibility that were particularly deceptive. He displayed none of
those characteristics which are supposed to be inseparable in some
way with the professional ruffian. He was said to have a mild,
almost benign, expression of face, with a soft blue eye, and a
pleasant, fascinating smile. This was certainly singular, having
regard to the fact that he came of a race of criminals, and he was,
therefore, interesting as a psychological problem. He bore the
reputation, however, of being a daring and fearless man who would
stick at nothing, and who would sell his life and liberty very
dearly indeed.</p>

<p>Soon after the London robbery to which I have referred, word
came through to Glasgow that Leary Dan was supposed to be lurking
in that city, and a sharp look-out was to be kept for him. As soon
as this information was received, my Chief sent for me, and having
given me a full and detailed description of Dan, said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well now, Donovan, here's a chance for you to distinguish
yourself. If Dan's in Glasgow, hunt him down, and earn renown for
yourself; for it will be a feather in your cap if you can manage to
lay this desperado by the heels.'</p>

<p>I need scarcely say these words had their due effect upon me,
and I resolved to leave no stone unturned to capture Mr. Leary Dan,
if he was really in Glasgow. I was told that he was not a man
likely to be easily taken, but the effect of that information was
to stimulate me to put forth all my energies, and to make a mental
vow that I would capture him if possible. Of course, the first
thing was to get on his track. The fellow bore the reputation of
being infinitely more cunning than a fox, and capable of assuming
so many disguises as to completely baffle his pursuers.</p>

<p>After making every allowance for exaggeration, I came to the
conclusion that Dan was certainly not an ordinary customer, and
therefore there might be some difficulty in trapping him. But still
this in no way discouraged me. I may, in fact, venture to assert
that it had precisely the opposite effect, and it put me on my
mettle.</p>

<p>My first step was to visit every haunt of vice in Glasgow, as
well as the low lodging-houses, in the hope that I might&mdash;to
use an Indian hunter's phrase&mdash;get on the spoor of my game.
But I could find no sign of him. And I began to think that he had
not honoured Glasgow with his distinguished presence. Nevertheless
I did not relax my vigilance, and, deeming it probable that he
might, if in the city at all, have taken up his residence in a
hotel, for the well-known habits of the man rendered that probable,
I visited most of the hotels&mdash;good, bad, and
indifferent&mdash;but still I failed to get any trace of him.</p>

<p>Need I say that I was bitterly disappointed, and it was but a
logical conclusion to come to, that Dan was not in Glasgow. We
heard from London, however, that the authorities there had
unmistakable evidence that Dan had certainly taken a ticket at
Euston Station for Glasgow, and that he as certainly travelled by
the train, part of the way at least, for a man who knew him, but
who did not know then that he was wanted, had seen him go into the
refreshment-room at Rugby. Of course, Dan might have gone on to
Glasgow by that train, but probably did not make a stay in the
northern city. But the question that suggested itself to my mind
was, 'Why did he go to Glasgow at all?' He must have had some
inducement. What was the inducement? He probably was acquainted
with somebody there, and I saw that if I could only establish that
as a fact, I might succeed in tracking him. Notwithstanding,
however, that I made every effort to do this, I quite failed to get
the slightest information. Dan's movements and affairs were well
kept by his pals and associates, and not a clue was forthcoming at
first. One night, however, I paid a professional visit to a very
notorious house in a low quarter of Glasgow. This house&mdash;long
since swept away&mdash;had a license to sell drink, the result
being that it was patronised by as wicked a lot of wretches, male
and female, as could be found in a day's march. In fact, whenever
we wanted to lay our hands on any of the fraternity of habitual
lawbreakers we went to this house, for somehow it had a fascination
for the class I allude to, and, though they knew they were likely
to be spotted there, they went, notwithstanding the risk.</p>

<p>On this particular night, amongst the visitors was a young woman
named Lizzie Graham, but known to her companions as 'Fair-haired
Liz.' She was, in spite of dissipation and recklessness, a
remarkably well-made and pretty woman, about twenty-five years of
age, but with a very bad record. She had suffered various terms of
imprisonment, and her associates were of the very worst kind. She
was, in short, as pretty and as dangerous a fiend as Glasgow at
that time could have produced. I knew her well as one of the
'dangerous classes,' and she knew me, for I had been instrumental
on one occasion in 'putting her away' for a whole year for highway
robbery.</p>

<p>'Hullo, Dick Donovan!' she exclaimed sneeringly as I entered;
'what lay are you on to-night?'</p>

<p>'Oh, just smelling round, Liz,' I answered; and then suddenly it
occurred to me that, if anyone in the city was likely to know if
Leary Dan was there, that person was Liz, so I determined to try
and pump her.</p>

<p>'Well, I hope when you're smelling round you'll break your
infernal neck, or that some bloke will knife you,' she remarked
savagely.</p>

<p>'Thank you, Liz,' I replied; 'you're charitable.'</p>

<p>'Yes; to the likes of you I am.'</p>

<p>'But you forget, my pretty one, I am the law's representative,
and I only do my duty.'</p>

<p>'Law be bloomed,' she exclaimed. 'There should be no law. It's
the law what makes poor devils like us outcasts.'</p>

<p>'Your logic's false, and your statement untrue,' I said. 'But
come, now, to show there's no ill-will on my part, I will pay for a
drink for you.'</p>

<p>'I don't want your blooming drink,' she answered; 'I can pay for
my own. Don't you believe me? look here.' As she spoke she pulled
from her pocket several pound notes, and flourished them in my
face.</p>

<p>'Oh, you're in clover,' I remarked. 'Have you been cracking some
crib, or skinning a mug?'*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* 'Skinning a mug,' robbing an intoxicated
man.]</p>

<p>'No I haven't,' she answered with a long-drawn sneer; I've done
better than that.'</p>

<p>'What have you done, Liz?'</p>

<p>'You don't think I'm such a howling flat as to tell you, do
you?'</p>

<p>'No; but maybe I shall find out.'</p>

<p>'Will you! maybe you won't. You think yourself' mighty clever,
but you ain't clever enough this time.'</p>

<p>'Don't be too sure of that, Lizzie, my lass. I've trapped
sharper people than you.'</p>

<p>'Yes; and I hope you'll be trapped some day, and get your
blooming neck broken.'</p>

<p>'How charitable you are, Liz! Now, you know you ought really to
be a little more polite,' I said banteringly, 'for you don't know
how soon you may be glad enough to ask a favour from me.'</p>

<p>'Favour from you!' she shrieked defiantly, and snapping her
finger and thumb in my face. 'Favour from you, Dick! No, old pal,
don't you make any blooming error. I won't ask any favour from you,
and take my tip, old man. You'll have to cut your wisdom teeth
before you have me again. Fact is, I'm going to clear out of this
rotten country, where poor folk are no better than rats.'</p>

<p>'And where are you going to?' I asked, with a laugh.</p>

<p>'Wouldn't you like to know?' she snarled, like an angry cat.</p>

<p>'No, I'm not particularly anxious, but I suppose you've picked
up a pal?'</p>

<p>'Yes, a fellow that's worth a dozen like you. He's one of the
proper sort, he is, and all the traps in Glasgow won't take
him.'</p>

<p>'He <i>must</i> be clever, then,' I said carelessly.</p>

<p>'He's that blooming clever that he's set the whole police in the
country at defiance.'</p>

<p>Unwittingly she was betraying herself into my hands, and I made
a random shot, remarking with an air of carelessness, and yet
fixing my eyes upon her&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, at the present moment, there is only one man I know who
is doing that.'</p>

<p>'And what's his name?' she asked sharply, with, as it seemed to
me, a shade of anxiety in her face.</p>

<p>'Leary Dan,' I answered.</p>

<p>At the mention of the name I saw her change countenance, and she
became confused, although she laughed coarsely and
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'For once, Mr. Dick Donovan, you're wrong; that ain't the bloke
I mean.'</p>

<p>'Ah, well, perhaps I am. But come, are you not going to have
this drink at my expense?'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, since you're so pressing, I don't mind. Well, here's
tae you. May you always be outwitted.'</p>

<p>I laughed heartily, and replied that it was possible her wish
might be realised, but not probable, and I thought to myself: 'I'm
of opinion, my fine lassie, I'll outwit you before you're much
older.'</p>

<p>I left soon after this, and somehow I could not help thinking
that I had struck a trail, and that Liz would prove an unwilling
Delilah and betray Dan Wray into my hands. It was evident that she
had made a haul of money from somewhere, and it seemed to me in the
highest degree probable that she had taken up with Dan, and he was
keeping her in funds out of the proceeds of the robbery in London.
I therefore resolved to have her closely watched.</p>

<p>For more than a week all her goings to and fro were noted to me,
although she had little idea how she was being shadowed. Of course
I tried to find out if she was in direct communication with Leary
Dan, but could get no evidence that such was the case. He was so
cunning, however, that I was sure he would not openly associate
with this woman, but that she knew a good deal about him I was
morally certain from the expression of her face when I had
mentioned his name to her. Another piece of strong presumptive
evidence was that Liz was well supplied with money.</p>

<p>I learned that much, but could not discover the source of
supply, but I did not relax my vigilance, and the feeling grew upon
me that, through Liz, I should run Leary Dan down, for, if it was
true he had come to Glasgow, then, from the known characteristics
of the man, he was lying <i>perdu</i> somewhere, or assuming some
character that for the time being defied the scrutiny of those who
were so anxious to discover him. It seemed, however, more likely to
me that he was hidden away in some snug retreat known only to a few
staunch 'pals,' amongst whom was fair-haired Liz, who certainly
would not betray him if she could possibly help it, for, like all
habitual criminals, she hated law and order, and all those whose
duty it was to uphold the majesty of the law, and she would have
done a great deal, and have gone to great lengths, to have cheated
the law.</p>

<p>For three weeks I shadowed this woman in a way that she had
never been shadowed before, and though I learned nothing
definitely, her movements became more suspicious, and proved she
had something to conceal, and that her funds were in a flourishing
state, for she redeemed many things from pawn, and began to deck
herself out in all sorts of gaudy finery, to the envy and jealousy
of her less-favoured associates, who, however, would not betray
her. During all this time no word had been heard of Leary Dan,
although his description had been circulated all over the country,
and a smart look-out was being kept. This led me to the positive
conclusion that he was in Glasgow; that Liz knew his whereabouts,
and as soon as he thought the coast was clear, he would shift his
quarters. That my inferences were right received some confirmation
from a report that was made to us by the authorities at Scotland
Yard. According to this report, a man had been arrested in London
for some minor offence. As he was known to be an associate of
Dan's, he had been questioned with a view to try and find out if he
was aware of Dan's hiding-place. The fellow, however, it became
evident, was ignorant on the subject, but he let fall a remark
which was decidedly valuable. He said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Maybe Dan has gone to his gal up in the north.' Asked what part
of the north, he replied that he did not know.</p>

<p>Pressed to state who the girl was, he expressed an equal want of
knowledge, but said that Dan had a pal' who was said to be 'the
rortiest petticoat pal' in the country.</p>

<p>These statements were embodied in the report sent to us, and an
official note was appended to the effect that it was very probable
that Dan was consorting with some woman, and that we were to
exercise increased vigilance. Of course I was rather pleased at
this seeming confirmation of my suspicions, and I became more than
ever attentive to 'Fair-haired Liz,' though, I need scarcely state,
she was all unconscious of my attentions. One thing was very clear
to me, as in fact it was to all my colleagues&mdash;namely, that
Dan was well protected by his pals, and that he must have adopted
some clever disguise, otherwise lie would have been taken long ago.
But I felt very certain that the fellow would be wearied out in the
end, for such a man was not likely to remain quiet and inactive for
any great length of time.</p>

<p>I noted at last that Liz began to visit her old haunts less
frequently; and that she was unusually well up in Ends was very
apparent, for she decked herself out in all sorts of finery, and
even mounted a watch and chain, which I found she had purchased at
a pawnbroker's.</p>

<p>All these little signs were to me very significant, and at great
personal inconvenience I closely shadowed the woman with unwearying
patience, and this sort of work does indeed want patience. The
outside public have but little knowledge of the amount of tireless
and persistent watchfulness that has to be exercised by a detective
officer who wishes to be successful in his calling. It is this very
quality, indeed, which often enables the officer to outwit the
criminal, for it is well known that criminals are restless, and
strongly opposed to anything like restraint on their movements; and
so, although at first they may display caution and patience, they
are soon tired out, and betray themselves by some careless act.
Knowing this, I was hopeful that, sooner or later, I should lay my
hands on the much-wanted Dan, and have the credit of bringing this
notorious rogue to justice. I was more than ever convinced that Liz
knew of his hiding-place, although she did most certainly succeed
in baffling me.</p>

<p>It came to her knowledge at last that she was being watched, for
I heard incidentally one night in one of the haunts frequented by
the class represented by Liz that she had stated she knew she was
being shadowed by 'that blooming duffer, Dick Donovan,' but that he
would have to cut a mighty lot of high teeth before he copped'
her.</p>

<p>I smiled to myself when I heard this, for it was so very
womanly, and showed that the caution which she was pleased to think
she possessed in a very high degree was, after all, only thin
veneer, and would soon wear itself out.</p>

<p>At last, one night, owing to information furnished me by my
assistant Jim, I kept an unusually sharp watch on Liz, and saw her
leaving her lodging gaily dressed, and with a large bundle under
her arm. Presently she got into a cab, and I felt sure that
something was on the tapis, and that, probably, my persistency was
about to be rewarded. Following her, I tracked her to the railway
station, where she took a ticket by what is known as 'The Irish
Train,' for Greenock. This astonished me. What did it mean a I kept
my weather eye open to see if she was joined by any one, but it was
evident she was alone, and I began to think that, after all,
perhaps there had been a mistake made as to Dan being in Glasgow.
But I was resolved not to lose Liz's track, and so travelled in the
same train to Greenock as she did. I felt sure that I was about to
witness a revelation, and when we reached Greenock, Miss Liz
employed a porter to carry her bundle, and I followed her to the
pier, where the Dublin boat was lying with her steam up, ready to
start for the Irish Metropolis. Then it flashed across me that Dan,
perhaps, was in Dublin, and Liz was going to join him there. I had
so altered and disguised my ordinary appearance that not even the
penetrating gaze of Liz could have discovered my identity, and so
when the boat cast off her warps and steamed down the river, I was
a fellow passenger with Liz, but little did I dream that that fact
was to be productive of one of the most extraordinary and daring
deeds that the annals of crime can furnish.</p>

<p>Although it was winter tune, the night was unusually fine,
though cold. There was an utter absence of wind, and a young moon
shone from a sky that was picturesque with ragged masses of fleecy
clouds. There were not many passengers by the steamer, and the
second-class were considerably in excess of the first-class. In
fact, including myself, there were only five saloon passengers,
while in the second-class there were fifteen at least. Liz
travelled second, and as soon as she got on board, she went down
below. I noted that she was very well clad, and was warmly wrapped
up in a soft woollen shawl of grey lambs' wool. She really looked a
most attractive young woman, and if her voice had been less raspy
and harsh, and her language more polished and less interspersed
with slang, she might have passed for a modest and refined young
woman. But in that case she would have been doubly and trebly
dangerous so far as men were concerned. When she spoke, however, it
was impossible for her not to betray her coarseness, and that was a
warning signal, as it were, to those who had their wits about
them.</p>

<p>As we steamed out to sea, I walked up and down the deck dreaming
dreams as I inhaled the smoke of a choice cigar, and I naturally
speculated on what the result of this journey would be. It was
evident that Liz had some mission, else why was she going to Dublin
To Dublin she was certainly going, because the boat called nowhere.
As it was a fourteen hours' journey, I knew I had her safe for that
time, and I could not help a quiet chuckle as I thought that I had
outwitted her so far, and how mad and furious she would be if she
only knew it. For two hours I kept the deck and smoked, until a
sense of weariness stole over me, and I felt that I wanted to
sleep. The boat was pursuing her course very steadily. There was no
wind, and the heavy black smoke from her funnel hung about like a
shroud, and made a great black pall like shadow on the sleeping
sea.</p>

<p>I had half expected to have seen Liz on deck, but she had not
put in an appearance, and so before turning in for a few hours'
rest, I thought I would go down into the second-class to have a
look at Liz if she was still up, which, however, I hardly expected
would be the case. My surprise, therefore, was very great to find
her seated at the table in company with a man who had the
appearance of a cattle-dealer. He was a big, powerful man, with a
clean-shaved face and short-cropped hair. He was dressed in
moleskin trousers, a short pea jacket buttoned over his breast,
while a heavy woollen muffler was wound round his neck. It was
impossible to see the whole of his face, as he had a large green
eye-shade over both his eyes.</p>

<p>My curiosity and interest were necessarily aroused to find that
Liz was not alone, and I began to take stock of her companion. For
a moment I asked myself if he was an acquaintance she had made
promiscuously since coming on board. They were drinking
whisky-and-water; and from their manner to each other, I soon came
to the conclusion that they were by no means new chums. They were
in close conversation, and talking almost in whispers. Then
suddenly it flashed across my mind that this man was 'Leary Dan,'
with whom I was burning with anxiety to get in touch. The
description, however, that I had of Dan was that he had a thick
short beard and whiskers, whereas this fellow's face was clean
shaved. Of course that was not of much moment, for I knew how
easily a beard could be removed by any one wishing to disguise his
identity. The eye-shade so completely hid the upper part of the
fellow's face that it was impossible to tell what his features were
like. Apart from the short thick beard, Dan's face was described as
being marked by a scar about an inch long over the right eyebrow,
and which at times had a very livid appearance. Was it not likely,
therefore, that this individual was Dan, and that he wore the
eye-shade to screen the scar?</p>

<p>I could not suppress a feeling of excitement as I began to
realise how very probable this was. If I was right in my surmises,
it was clear that, with the peculiar artfulness so characteristic
of the rascal, Dan had slipped out of Glasgow in spite of my
vigilance, and Liz had joined him on board, and they were going to
the Irish metropolis, where they hoped to be undisturbed by
detectives&mdash;for a time, at least. It was necessary, of course,
for me to prove whether I was right or wrong. If this man had a
sear over the right eye, then his identity would be established,
for one might dismiss the possibility of a coincidence, and I was,
therefore, resolved to find out if he was so marked. I had not much
fear of my own identity being discovered, for my disguise was very
complete. The voice was the only thing likely to betray me, for the
voice never changes after a certain age, and everyone knows how
extremely difficult it is to disguise the voice, and keep up the
change for any length of time. I resolved, however, to run the risk
of discovery by my voice, with which Liz was, of course, pretty
familiar. But still, as she was not suspecting danger, and probably
was congratulating herself on the clever manner in which she had
faked the blooming duffer, Dick Donovan,' she might not be
attracted by my voice. I, therefore, took my seat at the table,
and, in a half drowsy, husky way, as if I had already indulged in
alcohol beyond the limits of prudence, I ordered the steward's boy
to bring me some whisky. I noted that Liz fixed her eyes upon me,
and I mumbled out&mdash;</p>

<p>'That's a fine night, mum.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she answered curtly.</p>

<p>'We're getting a splendid crossing.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she answered again.</p>

<p>My drink was brought, and as I put the glass to my lips I
said&mdash;' 'Here's your health, mum.' She took no notice of my
remark, and after some minutes' silence, during which I had allowed
my chin to fall on my breast, as if sleep was overpowering me, I
suddenly started up as eight bells (twelve o'clock) was struck.</p>

<p>The bar closed at midnight, so I sang out to the boy&mdash;</p>

<p>'Here, boy, bring me another whisky before you shut up.' Then
turning to Liz and her companion, I asked them if they would join
me. Liz refused, but the man answered&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, it's all right. Yes, we'll have a drink, governor.'</p>

<p>This broke the ice, and I remarked to the man&mdash;</p>

<p>'You're going over for stock, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I'm a pig-dealer.'</p>

<p>'Irish pigs are cheap now,' I said.</p>

<p>'Are they?' he answered abstractedly. Then suddenly he asked,
'Are you in the line?'</p>

<p>'Hell, no.'</p>

<p>'What's your business, then?'</p>

<p>'I'm a traveller.'</p>

<p>'Do you know Dublin?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, fairly well. Do you?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Then you'll know my friend, Larry Murphy?' I remarked, watching
his face while I spoke. Larry Murphy was a pig dealer in a large
way of business in Dublin and Cork, and any one in the same line of
business would be sure to know him. I saw certain indications about
my companion's mouth which plainly indicated that he was taken off
his guard, and he answered somewhat confusedly&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, I know him.'</p>

<p>'He's a queer little bit of a spalpeen,' said I. 'It's a wonder,
what a lot he's got in his head, seeing how small he is.'</p>

<p>'Begad, you're right,' answered the fellow, with an attempt at a
laugh.</p>

<p>Now Larry Murphy was a man who stood over six feet high in his
stocking feet, with a development of figure in proportion to his
height. But though he was said to have made a lot of money by
dealing in pigs, he was an ignoramus, with no knowledge of anything
out of his own particular line. My 'suspect,' therefore, had
betrayed himself by proving that he knew nothing of Murphy.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that Liz began to manifest some impatience and
uneasiness, for she nudged the man on the arm, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, look here, Joe, are you going to sit here all night?'</p>

<p>'No, old gal. But, don't be in a hurry. Let's see if we can get
another drink.'</p>

<p>'Ah, that's right!' I exclaimed. 'Charming as your missis is,
we'll excuse her if she wishes to retire. Eh?' 'Don't make no
blooming error, old man,' Liz replied snappishly, and allowing her
vulgarity and slanginess to overcome her discretion&mdash; 'I ain't
going without my husband, I can tell you.'</p>

<p>'Right glad am I to hear that,' I remarked, 'for you are so
delightful that I prefer that you remain.</p>

<p>'We can't get anything more at the bar, for it's closed, but
I've got a flask here containing a drop of prime old Long John.
We'll finish it, if you like.'</p>

<p>The woman did not accept my invitation readily, but the man did.
I was sure that her suspicions were aroused, and I noted that she
occasionally eyed me askance and curiously; nevertheless, this did
not give me any concern, for if the man was, as I suspected, Leary
Dan, he was trapped as securely as a rat in an iron cage, and, on
reaching Dublin, he would go on shore as my prisoner. I drew my
flask from my pocket, and served the whisky, and, as we discussed
it, I said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Have you something wrong with your eyes, governor?'</p>

<p>Before he could reply Liz spoke, and answered&mdash; 'Yes, he
got cold in them some time ago, and they've always been inflamed
since.'</p>

<p>I could hardly suppress a smile at this shallow attempt at
deception, for the woman's whole manner and tone betrayed that it
was deception. I could no longer doubt now that she was painfully
anxious to conceal something, but it was my business, of course, to
prove, beyond a doubt, that the man was Leary Dan. That he was a
rascal went without saying, otherwise he would not have been in the
company of this notorious woman, for it was evident that they were
well acquainted with each other. Nevertheless, I wanted still
further proof that my suspicions were well founded; so, suddenly
jumping up, I reached across the table, for he was sitting on the
one side and I on the other, and I exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'Let's look at your eyes, for I've got a splendid remedy for
inflammation.'</p>

<p>Before he could stop me I had lifted up the shade, and there,
sure enough, was the scar over the right eye. While secretly
delighted that I had at last run my man to earth, I kept my
composure. Dan himself was furious, and drew back his elbow,
doubled his ponderous fist, and seemed inclined to let drive at me.
But Liz threw her arms round him, and, betraying her distress in
her voice, she said to him pleadingly&mdash;</p>

<p>'Let the bloke alone, dearie. You'll only get yourself in a mess
if you strike him.'</p>

<p>'Yes, there's no doubt about that,' I answered, with a
self-satisfied smile, for you see I might strike back, and then
your man would find some of his parts missing.'</p>

<p>'Well, if he couldn't knock you into smithereens I'd shunt him,'
remarked Liz with a sneer of the greatest contempt.</p>

<p>'Yes, by&mdash;,' exclaimed Dan. 'If you think I can't, just
stand before me for two minutes.'</p>

<p>What are you losing your temper about?' I asked quietly. I only
wanted to see your eyes. Perhaps you're afraid of showing your full
face lest you should be nabbed for something you've done.'</p>

<p>Dan's countenance was a study in its mixed expression of rage
and fear, and he seemed to be struggling to give vent to his
feelings, but Liz interposed, and, linking her arm in his, she drew
him away, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>'Come on; don't stop there, or there 'll be a row. Come to bed,
and leave the cad alone. He ain't worth quarrelling with.'</p>

<p>Dan yielded to her entreaties, but, as he moved away, he said
menacingly&mdash;</p>

<p>'I'll be even with you, old pal, if I get the chance. I shall
see you again before I leave the boat.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I answered. 'You needn't have the slightest doubt that
you'll see me again.'</p>

<p>I saw that these words brought a look of unmistakable alarm in
Liz's face&mdash;a look that plainly said she suspected my calling,
although she gave no sign that she knew who I was.</p>

<p>Dan and Liz retired, and I went back to the cabin, but not to
sleep. My drowsiness had passed off, and I was too elated with my
discovery to think of going to bed. 'I have my man safe now,' I
thought, 'and he shall go on shore at Dublin as my prisoner.' It
certainly was a triumph for me, because Liz had so long defied and
deceived me. But at last she had played into my hands, and had been
outwitted.</p>

<p>In the course of the night I went to the Captain, who was on
duty on the bridge, and told him who I was, and what my business
was. He told me that the man with the shade over his eyes had come
on board two hours before the boat started. It was clear,
therefore, that Dan had preceded Liz to Greenock, or he had,
perhaps, been staying there, having managed to slip away from
Glasgow owing to the hue and cry.</p>

<p>The Captain promised me his assistance, and so I went and turned
in for a couple of hours, for I was exhausted, and sadly needed
rest.</p>

<p>When I awoke the day was dawning, and we were nearing Dublin.
With the going down of the moon, a thick, heavy, white mist had
spread itself over the sea, and rendered it imperative that our
vessel should proceed almost dead slow, while the steam-whistle was
kept constantly going. A large and scattered fleet of fishing boats
was coming out of the harbour and making for the open sea, and it
took us all our time to keep clear of them. Under these
circumstances, the Captain's whole attention was needed for the
navigation of his vessel, and he kept to the bridge, while the
seamen were all occupied, some in keeping a look-out on all sides,
others in getting the warps ready for fastening the vessel as soon
as she reached the wharf. I, therefore, resolved to effect Dan's
capture without any assistance, and I went down into the
second-class.</p>

<p>Dan was asleep on a form, the green shade still pulled well over
his eyes, but Liz was walking up and down. She was evidently
restless and uncomfortable, and when I made my appearance, I saw a
look of alarm come into her face, and I could not help saying with
a laugh, 'Well, Liz, how do you feel this morning? You look as
charming as ever.'</p>

<p>She fairly staggered, and she grew as pale as a sheet of
note-paper. Then, with an oath, she ex-claimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'I'm not wrong, then. You're Dick Donovan?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Liz, I am,' I answered, 'and I think you'll admit you're
outwitted at last.'</p>

<p>She was dumb for some moments. She looked as fierce and savage
as a wild cat at bay, and as if she was going to fly at me. Knowing
the dangerous nature of the woman, I kept on the alert, and, moving
to the spot where Leary Dan was sleeping in blissful ignorance of
my presence, I whipped out a pair of handcuffs, and proceeded to
fasten them on his wrists. Then Liz screamed, and sprang at me;
and, seizing my hair like a Fury, she began to belabour me about
the head with her fists, accompanying her blows with a volley of
the foulest language, mingled with curses. I managed to securely
handcuff Dan before he fully realised the situation, and sprang to
his feet with a blood-curdling oath. There was only half a dozen
other passengers in the steerage at the time, four of them being
women, but I called upon the two men, in the name of the law, to
assist me. They did not heed my appeal, however, either from
amazement or fear. And, as I held Dan securely by the collar, I
warded off the virago's blows, and threatened her with imprisonment
in Dublin. My threats, however, would have had no weight, probably,
had it not been for Dan himself. Finding himself a prisoner, he
suddenly gained command of himself, and displayed great coolness
and self-possession, and he told Liz to be quiet. At first she did
not heed him, then he thundered out&mdash;</p>

<p>'You fool, keep quiet. What good do you think you're doing now?
You'll only get put in quod, and how will that help me?'</p>

<p>This had an effect, and she desisted, but her wishes for my
destruction found vent in language of the strongest possible
description. Suddenly Dan leaned towards her as she clung to him as
if thinking she could prevent my taking him away, and he whispered
something to her that I could not catch, and, deeming it prudent to
separate them, I pulled him away, and ordered him to go up the
companion way to the deck. Then I took him to the after part of the
vessel, and we were followed by Liz, who had dried her tears, and
ceased her abuse. The ship was still moving very slowly, for the
fog was as thick as ever. Cold and raw as the morning was, Dan was
hot and flushed with the exertion he had undergone, and it was easy
to read in his face feelings of intense chagrin and bitterness as
he realised that, though he had eluded justice for long, the law
had proved too much for him at last.</p>

<p>For ten minutes or so he was silent and gloomy. At last he
raised his manacled hands, and tore off the eye-shade,
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>'It's no use acting the fool any longer. You've fairly trapped
me, Dick Donovan, and I wish you joy of it.'</p>

<p>'Well, I've had a pretty long hunt for you, Dan,' I answered,
'and I am not a little pleased I've succeeded in running you to
earth at last.'</p>

<p>Ah,' he grunted, 'you'll never do it again, though.' Liz was
sitting on the cabin skylight with her face buried in her hands.
Suddenly Dan reeled, and leaned heavily against the rail of the
vessel and gasped&mdash;</p>

<p>'Get me a drink&mdash;some whisky&mdash;I feel ill.'</p>

<p>I could hardly refuse such a request, as he really seemed ill,
and I moved towards the companion-way to call the steward. Then
with a jerk of his powerful wrists Dan snapped the handcuffs. Liz
flew towards him, and, putting his arm round her, the two sprang
overboard.</p>

<p>The daring and suddenness of the deed for a moment deprived me
of speech; then I glanced over the side, and saw Liz and Dan
drifting astern, and gradually disappearing in the fog. I raised an
alarm, but before the vessel's way could be stopped the man and
woman had drifted out of sight, and, as we were still a long way
from the shore, it was highly probable they had gone to their doom.
It certainly was as daring and remarkable an act as the annals of
crime could show, and seemed to prove that the man preferred to
face death rather than suffer long imprisonment; while the woman,
low and brutal as she was, was willing to share his fate, by reason
of the strong attachment she had for him.</p>

<p>As soon as it became known that a man and woman had jumped
overboard all was confusion on the vessel, and no time was lost in
getting a boat clear; but the law relating to boats on passenger
vessels was not enforced with the rigour then that it is now, and
nearly a quarter of an hour elapsed before a boat was got into the
water, and half an hour was spent in a vain and fruitless endeavour
to pick up the wretched couple, but not a sign nor a trace of them
could be found, and the feeling of all on board was that they had
undoubtedly perished. So the boat was hoisted in, the machinery was
set in motion again, and the steamer proceeded on her way to the
wharf.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe what my feelings were. I had for
once in my life been cleanly outwitted. I freely admit that; but
then the wretched people had paid a terrible penalty for their
triumph. I could not think, somehow, that it had been their
intention to commit suicide. Probably the man thought he could
reach the shore, for he was, no doubt, a good swimmer, otherwise he
would not have run such a risk; or, failing the shore, some passing
boat might pick him up. <i>Some passing boat!</i> As this idea
flashed through my mind, I asked whether it was not extremely
likely they had been picked up.</p>

<p>We were making our way through a fishing fleet proceeding to
sea, and so numerous were these boats that it was in the highest
degree probable that the man and woman must have been observed by
one or other of them. In fact, when I came to argue the matter out,
I could not avoid the conclusion that Dan had calculated upon this
chance. It is true it was a desperate chance. But do not desperate
diseases require desperate remedies? Dan saw a long term of penal
servitude before him, even if he did not get a lifer, which was
probable, seeing how black his record was. Therefore it was worth
while to preserve his liberty even at the risk of death. That Liz
was ready and willing to share his fate, whatever it might be, only
served to prove the strength of her devotion. And devotion to him
it must have been, for he had had no chance of discussing the plan
with her. There is no doubt that when he hastily whispered to her
in the steerage he said enough to put her on the alert. She was
evidently quick to gather his meaning, though few words were
spoken, and, without the slightest thought as to what might be the
consequence, she blindly trusted herself to him, and braved all the
dangers of the fog-enshrouded sea.</p>

<p>On reaching Dublin I at once took steps to ascertain what
fishing vessels were out that morning, though the task was so full
of difficulty, owing to the boats starting from all parts of the
coast, that I abandoned it. But, with the concurrence of the
authorities, I offered a reward of £10 for any information that
would conclusively prove Dan and Liz to be dead or alive.</p>

<p>A few days later we got word from the officer of a revenue
cutter that, making for the port on the morning that Dan and Liz
jumped overboard, he passed close to a fishing smack heading for
sea, so close, in fact, that the two boats narrowly escaped
collision. The smack had evidently been stopped, for her mainsail
was being hoisted, and she was getting under weigh. But what
particularly attracted the attention of the officer and his men was
the appearance of a man and woman on the deck of the smack who had
evidently been in the water. The officer intended to inquire what
was the matter, but had to rapidly change his course to avoid
collision, and the fog in a few moments hid the two boats from each
other, and the officer did not think it worth while to delay. He
had, however, noted the number of the fisherman on the mainsail,
and by this number we were enabled to trace the smack, which proved
to be the Calhoun, belonging to Bray. The Calhoun, however, had
been out more than a week, and had not returned; but we found that
the relations of those on board were not concerned by the prolonged
absence, and it was evident they had had 'a tip' given them. On the
tenth day the Calhoun came in, and I, in company with two other
officers, boarded her, and questioned the crew as to where they had
been to. At first they were reluctant to tell, until, by
cross-examination, I learned from the skipper that he had been to
the coast of France. Questioned why he had been so far, he admitted
picking a man and woman out of the water, and they had paid him a
large sum to land them on French soil, the man having round his
waist a belt containing a considerable amount of money.</p>

<p>This, then, was the solution of the mystery, and it was evidence
of Dan's daring, no less than of his cuteness; and, rascal though
he was, and bad as Liz was, I could not but feel a certain amount
of admiration for his pluck and her devotion. It was a daring deed,
and they had won their lives.</p>

<p>Twelve months later Dan turned up in his old haunts in London.
He could not resist the fascination they had for him, and one day,
being recognised by a London detective, he was promptly pounced
upon, and dragged off to prison. Anxious to learn from his own lips
the story of his daring and desperate deed, I visited him in
prison, and he told me that on that memorable morning he had
resolved to perish rather than be taken, and, being a very powerful
swimmer, he had calculated on being able to sustain himself and Liz
above water until they were picked up by some passing boat. A
hurriedly-spoken word to Liz had put her on the alert, and, without
any shrinking from the risk she ran, she joined issues with him.
They were in the water half an hour before they were taken on board
the fishing vessel. Having a hundred pounds in his possession, he
offered fifty to the skipper of the vessel to run him over to the
coast of France. The offer was accepted, and they were landed near
Brest; but the immersion in the icy water was fatal to Liz, and Dan
told me with genuine emotion and tears that on the third day she
was seized with violent inflammation of the lungs, and died in the
Brest Hospital a week later.</p>

<p>Dan was duly tried for the robbery for which he had been so long
wanted, and, being convicted, he was sentenced to penal servitude
for life, as he was regarded as an irredeemable criminal. Thus his
daring and courageous deed had been fatal to the woman whose strong
attachment to him had led her to willingly risk her life with his,
and it had not saved him from life-long incarceration in a felon's
prison. Truly, it was courage wasted in an unworthy cause.</p>

V. &mdash; THE GREAT RUBY ROBBERY</h2>

<p>MOST of my readers will, no doubt, be aware that Hatton Garden,
London, is a short thoroughfare that runs north from Holborn, and
is distinguished by being almost entirely occupied by two classes
of people only&mdash;lawyers and dealers in precious stones. The
physical law that all matter tends to gravitate towards its kind
would seem to be illustrated in a marked manner so far as Hatton
Garden is concerned, for the dealers in stones, as well as the
lawyers, are for the most part of the Hebrew persuasion. The money
value of the business transacted in this short street in the course
of a week would appear to be fabulous if put on paper. But the
stock in the hands of some of these Jewish gem merchants is often
valued at tens of thousands of pounds, and the way in which packets
of gems worth many thousands of pounds are carried about during the
day would astonish an outsider. Of course such a region of wealth
has repeatedly aroused the cupidity of adventurers, and there are
stories told of gem robberies in Hatton Garden that would read like
wild romances. It is only two or three years ago that the post
office in the street was attacked one evening by some members of a
gang of ruffians. It was just as the evening mail was being made
up, and the rascals knew there would be numerous packets of
precious stones. The clerks in charge of the office were overcome,
and the mail-bag rifled, with the result that the thieves obtained
a very valuable booty, with which they got clear off.</p>

<p>The case I am about to narrate, however, dates back many years
before this post office robbery. In my time one of the best-known
firms in the 'Garden' was that of Benjamin Moses and Sons, whose
business ramifications extended to all civilised parts of the
world. They were Russian Jews of high respectability, and had been
established in London for more than a quarter of a century. The
firm consisted of the father and three sons, and a nephew of Mr.
Moses, senior. This nephew, whose name was Samuel Cohen, had only a
nominal interest in the concern, and his position was that of a
clerk or bookkeeper. The business was entirely managed by these
five people, and they employed no one else, notwithstanding that
their transactions were most extensive, and it was said that Moses
and his sons were as wealthy as Creesus. Their premises, which
consisted of two rooms on the ground-floor of one of the large,
old-fashioned houses which abound in the street, were entered from
a. passage common to the whole building. This passage was reached
from the street by four or five steps. Then at the end of the
passage was a flight of stairs communicating with the upper stories
of the building. In the basement was a suite of rooms, occupied by
the caretaker of the premises&mdash;a woman named Martin, who lived
there with her husband, a blind man, and their daughter,
Isabella.</p>

<p>The rooms of Moses and Sons were back and front. The front room
was fitted up as an office; the back was where the stock and
business books were kept. Each of these rooms communicated with the
outer passage by means of a door, but the door of the back room was
always kept securely locked and barred. And the back window, which
looked into a small yard, peculiar to some of the old houses in the
city of London, was also guarded with iron bars. With this
description of the place the reader will understand more clearly
what follows.</p>

<p>It chanced, one November, two of the sons were on the Continent
travelling on business for the firm, and the third son was ill at
home, suffering from a severe cold. It was the middle of the month,
and was one of those typical mornings which Londoners often
experience in November. The air was thick, like pea-soup; and it
was so dark that gas had to be lighted in all the business places.
On this very morning Mr. Moses had received from abroad a parcel of
magnificent Burmese rubies, valued at about £25,000, and he and his
nephew were busy in the back room sorting and counting these gems
so as to check the invoice. But about eleven o'clock it became
necessary for the nephew to take some diamonds and other stones to
a customer in Cornhill, consequently old Mr. Moses was left alone,
and went on with his work, putting the rubies into cases
preparatory to locking them up in one of the ponderous safes which
were set into the wall of the room. While so engaged he heard the
bell of the office-door strike, which signified that somebody had
entered. The door could not be opened without this alarm-bell
sounding. Mr. Moses at once went into the office, closing the
communicating-door of the two rooms behind him. He was confronted
by a young but exceedingly powerful-looking man, who wore a heavy
fur-trimmed coat and a fur cap. He had a thick moustache and a long
black beard. He introduced himself by saying he was a buyer for a
large and very well-known West-End firm of jewellers, and he had
been sent to purchase a few exceptionally good brilliants to
complete a tiara his firm was making for a titled lady in
London.</p>

<p>After some little conversation, Mr. Moses turned round to go
into the back room to get the stones, when, with one bound, the
intruder sprang over the little counter that stood between him and
the doorway, threw his arm round Mr. Moses's throat, half
strangling him; then clapped a plaster made of pitch, or something
equally adhesive, on to the Jew's mouth, and, as the victim
struggled desperately to free himself from the vice-like grip in
which he was held, the robber struck him over the head with what
was supposed to be a knuckle-duster, and stunned him. After that he
securely tied his feet together, and his hands behind his back,
with some strong cord which he had brought with him. The
unfortunate merchant being thus rendered helpless and insensible,
the thief entered the back room and carried off the rubies,
together with a few diamonds and sapphires that were in a glass
dish on the table, and, having secured his booty, he turned out the
gas and made tracks.</p>

<p>When Mr. Moses recovered consciousness he was almost suffocated
with the plaster over his mouth, and it was utterly impossible for
him to cry out, and equally impossible for him to free his hands or
feet, for they had been most securely tied. Knowing that, besides
the outrage on himself, his place must have been robbed, he
suffered agony of mind that was dreadful, and in his desperation he
managed to struggle to his feet, but at that moment he evidently
fainted and fell down again, for a blank ensued, and he could
remember nothing.</p>

<p>When he took his departure the thief locked the door on the
outside with a key that he had obviously brought with him, for Mr.
Moses always kept his own keys in his pocket. The object in locking
the door was, no doubt, to prevent any one who might call from
entering, and thus discovering the outrage before the thief had a
sufficiently long time to make good his escape. As was subsequently
proved, two or three people did call, but, finding the door locked
and the place in darkness, they concluded that Mr. Moses was
temporarily absent.</p>

<p>It was about half-past twelve when Samuel Cohen returned from
his errand to Cornhill, and naturally he was surprised to find the
door locked. But he, also, thought that his uncle had stepped out
for a few minutes. Having waited a quarter of an hour or twenty
minutes, however, he called upon two or three neighbours where it
was probable his uncle might have gone, but failing to get any
information he grew uneasy, and seeing a policeman coming down the
street, he spoke to him, and expressed his fears that something was
wrong. Under these circumstances the policeman suggested that it
might be advisable to burst the door open, and, acting on this
advice, Cohen and the policeman proceeded to effect forcible entry
into the premises, the result being they found Mr. Moses on the
floor, bound hand and foot, and his mouth gagged with the horrible
plaster.</p>

<p>That outrage had been committed was only too obvious; and
outrage suggested robbery, which Cohen speedily determined had been
of a very serious character. The first thing to do, however, was to
free Mr. Moses from the plaster and the bonds; but, even when this
was done, it was some time before he could give any coherent
account of the affair, for he was dazed and stupefied. But when a
local chemist had dressed the wound in his head and administered
some stimulant he was able to detail what had happened; and, as may
be imagined, he was in terrible distress of mind at the heavy loss,
for he knew only too well that the chances of recovering precious
stones were somewhat remote. Such portable property as that, while
going into small bulk, was very valuable, and could be easily
disposed of.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Moses and his nephew recovered from the shock
which the affair naturally caused them I was telegraphed for, or,
to be correct, word was sent with all speed to the 'Yard,' and I
was instructed to look into the matter.</p>

<p>When I arrived in Hatton Garden it was three o'clock, and as the
robbery had been committed about half-past eleven, the enterprising
gentleman who had gone off with the rubies had got a fairly good
start, so that if he knew how to make the best of his opportunities
he might succeed in eluding capture, and that he had his wits about
him was manifested from the way he had done his work. That he was
bold almost to recklessness seemed equally evident, and it was no
less evident that he had deliberately planned the robbery, and
carried it out in a most systematic manner, although from the fact
that some of the rubies were found scattered about the floor it was
safe to argue that he had become somewhat flurried and excited in
the end, for when the dropped stones were picked up and valued they
were proved to be worth about a thousand pounds; and though the
fellow had made a most valuable haul as it was he might have had
this additional thousand pounds' worth had he remained cool and
collected. However, he probably though that a thousand or two more
or less in such a valuable prize made little difference.</p>

<p>Mr. Moses having recovered from the shock, although the wound in
his head pained him, related the story to me with a
circumstantiality that left nothing to be desired, and he described
his assailant as a man of about eight-and-twenty or thirty, very
dark complexioned, with dark, piercing eyes, a full moustache and
beard, but Mr. Moses was of opinion that the beard was a false one.
Although the thief spoke excellent English, the merchant was sure
he was a foreigner, as he detected an accent that he thought
betrayed an Italian origin.</p>

<p>Now there were certain circumstances in connection with this
case that were very significant and suggestive. That the man had
deliberately planned the robbery and outrage was evident to the
meanest intelligence, otherwise why did he go prepared with plaster
and cord? This argued that he knew he would have to encounter the
old man, and render him helpless before he could possess himself of
the gems. But it did more than that; it seemed to me to point
conclusively to foreknowledge on the part of the thief. By that I
mean that he had managed by some means or other to ascertain,
first, that there had been a large arrival of rubies; and,
secondly, that the old Jew was alone. Had he not been aware of this
latter fact he would hardly have ventured on the robbery, for he
could not have hoped to succeed had any one else been with Mr.
Moses at the time. To overcome one man&mdash;and that man an old
one&mdash;was a comparatively easy matter to a young and vigorous
fellow, but to subdue two in the same way was next to
impossible.</p>

<p>It was but natural that I should ponder upon this, and ask
myself&mdash;How did the thief gain this knowledge? The reader will
see at once how that question was fraught with importance, for,
could I get an answer to it, I might be able to get on the track of
the robber. I felt morally certain that he had not acted alone, but
had had a confederate who had given him the information. Who was
the confederate? Did not all the circumstances point to Samuel
Cohen as the man? But at that early stage of the inquiry I was
hardly justified in giving expression to my suspicions.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that under the rooms occupied by Mr.
Moses the caretaker, Mrs. Martin, and her husband and daughter,
lived&mdash;that is, they occupied the basement. Their place could
be reached from the street by a flight of stone steps going down
into an area, and they were also in communication with the house by
the back staircase, which came up into the passage I have
described. When I had got all the information I could from Mr.
Moses, who was almost distracted at the idea of losing so much
money as was represented by the stolen rubies, I proceeded to
interview Mrs. Martin, and to inquire of her if she had observed
any one loitering about. She was an intelligent woman, though a
somewhat garrulous one, and I had a difficulty in keeping her to
the point. But at last I got from her an emphatic declaration that
she had not noticed any one. Her husband was stone blind, and
confined to his bed with rheumatism. Their daughter Bella was a
good-looking young woman of about four-and-twenty, and was
employed, so they informed me, as a check-taker and
programme-seller in a West-End theatre.</p>

<p>'How long have you lived here?' I asked Mrs. Martin. Close on
five year, sir.'</p>

<p>'And you know Mr. Moses and his sons well?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, sir. They ain't very liberal gents, 'cause they don't
give me as much at Christmas-time as the other tenants do; but I
ain't got nothink to say again them.'</p>

<p>I did not check her in giving me this gratuitous opinion, for I
had an object in questioning her, and thought it better to let her
answer in her own way, and when she had finished I said in a casual
sort of manner, as though I had no interest in asking&mdash;</p>

<p>'And I suppose you find Mr. Cohen very little more to your
mind?'</p>

<p>'Ah, well now, sir, I wouldn't quite say that, because, as 'ow,
I've always found Mr. Cohen a very nice gentleman, and often of a
Saturday, when I've been a scrubbing the passage and the stairs,
which I 'ave to do every week, he's given me a shilling or a
sixpence, saying, as 'ow, it would do to get me and my husband a
drop of beer for our Sunday's dinner.'</p>

<p>'Had he any particular reason, do you know, for this display of
liberality?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Not that I know of, 'cept his kind-heartedness, like.'</p>

<p>'Well, sir,' put in the blind husband, 'I think the missus ought
to tell you that she caught Cohen some time ago a carrying on a
flirtation with our Bella, and she threatened as how she would tell
Mr. Moses, and, maybe, the shillings and sixpences have been given
to keep her tongue quiet.'</p>

<p>The man spoke with a certain anger and bitterness, as though he
did not view Mr. Cohen's liberality in the same light as his wife
did. But now Bella herself had a say, and she exclaimed pertly, and
with an indignant toss of her head&mdash;</p>

<p>'What do you talk such nonsense for, father? It isn't true that
Mr. Cohen flirted with me.'</p>

<p>'Well, lass, I'm only repeating what your mother told me.'</p>

<p>'Then mother ought to have had more sense than to tell you any
such rubbish.'</p>

<p>'Now, Bella,' remarked the mother, 'you know quite well that I
caught you and Mr. Cohen together several times.'</p>

<p>'And what if you did! Can't a girl be seen speaking to a
gentleman without it's being thought that he is flirting with
her?'</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin was evidently averse to discussing the subject
further, for probably she did not wish me to imagine that Cohen's
liberality was due to the cause her husband had suggested. Of
course I drew my own conclusions from what I had heard, and those
conclusions left me in no doubt that there had been a good deal of
flirtation between this pretty girl and Mr. Samuel Cohen, and
though I could not determine then whether this might have any
bearing on the robbery I felt it was not to be altogether ignored
in sifting the pros and cons of this remarkable case.</p>

<p>Miss Isabella Martin was evidently a young woman who&mdash;to
use a somewhat vulgar, but, nevertheless, an expressive
phrase&mdash;knew how many beans made five. There was a
self-consciousness, and even a certain. priggishness, about her
that asserted themselves in an unpleasant way. She was pretty, I
will even say very pretty, and that fact would, in the eyes of some
men, have been sufficient to outweigh any objectionable qualities.
But she impressed me with something like a conviction that she was
cunning, artful, and deceitful, and I deemed it not at all
improbable that her flirtations with Mr. Cohen were not quite of
the venial character she described them to be. Therefore, it
followed as a sequence in the line of argument that she might,
under proper conditions, be betrayed into making admissions with
reference to Mr. Cohen that would be valuable in assisting me to
elucidate the mystery of the robbery. But these conditions were not
then; and, as I had no object in prolonging my interview with the
Martins, I thanked them, and withdrew with a feeling that I had not
wasted my time.</p>

<p>It will, of course, be noted that my suspicions were fastening
on Mr. Cohen as an accessory to the crime, and my reasons for this
were based upon the significant circumstances of the crime, which
were that the robbery took place on the very morning that a large
consignment of precious stones had arrived, and at the very hour
when Cohen was absent. Everything else was, of course, in favour of
the thief&mdash;the absence of the sons, the dark morning&mdash;but
if he had not received 'a tip,' how did he know that one son was
away ill, that the rubies had arrived, and that Cohen was out;
therefore, that Mr. Moses was alone and engaged in examining his
purchase, and that, therefore, again, the stones would be loose in
the stockroom? These were pertinent questions for me to put to
myself; and if such a tip as that I suggested was given, who was
likely to have given it if not Cohen?</p>

<p>Full of my suspicion, but without wishing at that stage to
declare it, I went down to Mr. Moses's private house that
evening&mdash;he lived in good style at Richmond&mdash;and, in the
course of a conversation I had with him, I said
incidentally&mdash;</p>

<p>'I presume your nephew had gone out this morning by your
request?'</p>

<p>'Oh, certainly,' was the answer. 'I sent him.'</p>

<p>'He himself didn't suggest going?'</p>

<p>'No, of course not.'</p>

<p>I confess that his answers disappointed me. Had they been the
other way, they would have seemed to support my suspicion. As it
was, they had a tendency to make me think I was in the wrong; and
as Mr. Moses had been very emphatic in his 'No, of course not,' I
did not consider it prudent then to say another word that might
cause him to think I suspected the nephew, but I resolved to take
other steps to learn more about Mr. Cohen.</p>

<p>In the few hours that had elapsed we had not let the grass grow
under our feet, and news of the outrage and robbery had been sent
to every principal station in the kingdom, with a brief description
of the thief.</p>

<p>For myself, I did not look for a very speedy capture, because
the fellow had not only got a good start, and could, by shaving his
face&mdash;assuming his beard was not false&mdash;alter his
appearance; but I felt sure, for several reasons, that he had
confederates, who would endeavour to cover his retreat, and throw
his pursuers off the scent, and that I was not wrong in this
surmise seemed to be confirmed by a letter received at the
Detective Department, which read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">'The fellow what did the job so neatly at Old
Moses's place in Hatton Garden sailed last night from Liverpool in
one of the liners for the land of the soaring eagle, and he'll
never come back no more, and the 'cops' will never take him. He
knowed his book, and has won cleverly.&mdash;<i>&gt;One What
Admires Pluck.'</i></p>

<p>Of course there are plenty of stupid people who are always ready
to write a letter like this under the impression that they are
having a joke, but I did not think that this one was to be classed
amongst the missives which usually pour in from human donkeys
whenever there is an unusual case on hand; and the reason I did not
so think was that the writer was not so ignorant as he wished to
seem. The writing itself was infinitely better than the generality
of such letters that are sent to the police, and the slipshod
grammar, I felt pretty sure, had been purposely assumed. Any way,
if it served no other purpose, it proved that the race of fools had
not died out, for I did not believe the thief had gone to America,
but the writer's object was to throw us off the scent. The police,
however, are not quite such idiots as this class of people consider
them to be.</p>

<p>When a fortnight had passed we were still without any clue to
the thief, and Mr. Moses was so affected by his heavy loss that he
became alarmingly ill. His sons, on hearing of the robbery, had
hurried back to London, and I had several interviews with them, but
no information they could give me was of the slightest use in
helping me to trace the robber. I drew from them, by leading
questions I put to them, that they not only had great confidence in
their cousin, but were greatly attached to him. And from other
sources where I had pushed my inquires, I could learn nothing
against Cohen. He was a single man, and, though fond of gaiety and
enjoyment, he was considered to be very respectable and very
upright.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this I could not divest myself of the idea
that he was an accessory. I have had a habit all my life of
sticking with dogged persistency to any conclusion I have come to
that seemed to me warranted by logic, unless, of course, I saw
clearly I was in the wrong; but in the present case, although I
could not discern much to justify me in saying I was right, I could
not, on the other hand, see anything very definite that decided I
was wrong. Perhaps this may be regarded as pigheadedness, or crass
obtuseness, but every man acts according to his lights, and I had
learned from long experience of the ways of evildoers not to be
deceived by mere surface appearances. I was not disposed to accept
veneering for the solid wood; and, though Mr. Samuel Cohen might
turn out to be all that he was represented to be, I was determined
to go down a little deeper into his life and mode of living in the
exercise of what I considered my duty to the Law, of which I was a
humble representative. But little did I dream then that I was to be
instrumental in revealing a state of matters that had in them all
the elements of a wild romance.</p>

<p>In order to carry out my idea with regard to Mr. Cohen, I made
it a special business to have several interviews with him,
ostensibly to ask questions having a bearing on the robbery, but in
reality that I might study him, and, possibly, by some chance
remark on his part, find a justification for suspecting him. But in
so far as this was concerned I was not successful, for he proved
himself to be remarkably cautious. However, one or two things I did
learn that were of advantage to me, and they were that Cohen was a
fast young man, fond of fast company, and that he was exceedingly
extravagant, while his income was by no means equivalent to his
expenditure. Nevertheless, I had to admit that these points were
not in themselves so remarkable as to warrant my regarding him as a
dishonest man, for thousands of young men are fast, extravagant,
and live beyond their incomes, and yet do not commit any act
against the law. So far, then, I could make out nothing against Mr.
Cohen, and there were times when I was disposed to admit that I had
been following a wrong scent. But still, though other men were
engaged on the case, no clue was forthcoming, and I knew that some
of the officials were of opinion that the letter which had been
received by the Department, signed One What Admires Pluck,' was
genuine, and that the thief had really got off to America.</p>

<p>This belief did not recommend itself to me at all, for, as I
have already explained, the letter, when viewed in the light of
experience, did not bear the stamp of genuineness. On the other
hand, in spite of the vigilance that had been exercised, in spite
of a considerable reward, and in spite of much detective science
that had been brought to bear on the case, we had been unable to
get the slightest clue to the thief or the stolen property. Mr.
Moses and his sons were naturally greatly distressed, and finding
that, as every day passed, the chances of recovering the stolen
gems rapidly diminished, they decided to offer a reward of £500 for
any information that would lead to the arrest of the criminal and
the recovery of the property. But even this offer, tempting as it
was, had no effect, nor did it tend in any way to induce me to
slacken my vigilance. The idea that had fixed itself in my mind
with regard to Cohen would not yield, for the more I analysed all
the details of the case the more clearly did it seem to me that the
thief must have had a confederate who was well acquainted with what
was going on in Moses' office on the morning of the robbery, for
which everything had been prepared.</p>

<p>Nearly two months passed, and we were as far off a solution of
the mystery as ever, when one afternoon towards the end of January
I was going along Oxford Street when I saw a gentleman and lady
emerge from a well-known restaurant. In the gentleman I at once
recognised Samuel Cohen, and, scrutinising his companion narrowly,
I was surprised to find she was none other than Isabella Martin,
but she was so stylishly dressed that at first I was disposed to
think I was wrong. They hailed a cab, and drove away without having
seen me, and this little incident set me pondering.</p>

<p>'How was it,' I asked, 'that the young woman, occupying as she
did a very humble position in life, could afford to dress in a way
that implied a large expenditure of money?'</p>

<p>However, it was not so much that detail that interested me as
the fact of her being in company with Cohen. His acquaintance with
her, as it appeared from this, was something more than a mere
flirtation, and it occurred to me that Miss Martin might, if
diplomatically approached, prove a valuable ally, without knowing
that she was aiding me.</p>

<p>A little later on the same evening I called upon the young
lady's mother to make some inquiries about the daughter, but the
mother told me in bitter sorrow that 'Bella' had been away for
several weeks. She had had a few words with her father, and had
taken herself off without saying where she was going to, and her
parents had neither seen her nor heard from her since. I did not
deem it prudent to tell the poor distressed mother that I had seen
her daughter that very afternoon, under circumstances that seemed
to suggest she was flourishing.</p>

<p>My next step was to proceed to the theatre where</p>

<p>Bella was employed, but there I learnt that she had thrown up
her situation four weeks ago. These things were in themselves
undoubtedly significant, and seemed to suggest to me that I was
striking a trail that might lead to important results. Did it not,
for instance, seem probable that Miss Isabella Martin had had a
share of the plunder, judging from her style of dress, and the fact
of her having thrown up her situation at the theatre? Why had she
done that? The feasible answer seemed to be because Cohen had
liberally supplied her with money, which had not only enabled her
to ape the ways of her superiors, as far as dress was concerned,
but also to be independent of the salary which her employment
brought her in. Anyway, here was a mystery, and I was determined to
solve it, and learn as much as possible about the interesting
Bella. To that end I made inquiries at the theatre as to her
address, but at the outset was foiled, for nobody seemed able to
give it, until a woman, who was employed as a cleaner, volunteered
the information that the young woman was living with her
husband.</p>

<p>'With her husband!' I exclaimed.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'But you don't mean to say she's married?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, I believe as how she's married.'</p>

<p>'To whom is she married?'</p>

<p>'Well, I believe she married a gent what goes abroad.'</p>

<p>This was news indeed, and seemed to me to strike a key-note.</p>

<p>'How do you know she's married?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Because me and her was pretty friendly, and her sweetheart used
to come about the theatre a good deal, and she told me that he was
agoing to marry her.'</p>

<p>'Going to! How long is that ago?'</p>

<p>'Well, it's some weeks now.'</p>

<p>'Then she's been married recently?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes; that's why she left the theaytur.'</p>

<p>'Umph, umph,' I muttered, as I began to see daylight as I
thought. 'Do you know the name of her husband?'</p>

<p>'I've heard it, but I can't remember it. It's a furren
name.'</p>

<p>'What sort of a man is her husband&mdash;I mean in
appearance?'</p>

<p>'He's a very dark man.'</p>

<p>'Tall?'</p>

<p>'Well, middling tall.'</p>

<p>'Should you think he was a strong man?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, I'm sure he is.'</p>

<p>'Has he a beard?'</p>

<p>'I've never seen him with no beard. He's a young man&mdash;a
good-looking fellow, with just a moustache.'</p>

<p>As I left my informant, having learnt as much, apparently, as
she had to impart, for she could not give me Bella's address, I was
somewhat in a quandary&mdash;puzzled, in fact; for what I had heard
pointed to my being wrong in my suspicions of Cohen; and yet I had
seen them together under circumstances that suggested he was
sweethearting her. The description I had received of Isabella's
husband did not correspond with Cohen's appearance, so that if the
information was correct there were two Richmonds in the field, and
that rather complicated matters; but I made up my mind to see what
I could get out of Cohen in the course of another interview, and,
acting on what I had heard, accordingly, that evening I went down
to where he lived, but found him out, and so I wrote asking him to
give me an appointment, which he did.</p>

<p>'You are probably exceedingly desirous, Mr. Cohen,' I began,
'that the mystery of this robbery should be cleared up, for, as I
understand matters, you are a sufferer&mdash;that is, you are a
loser&mdash;in conjunction with your relatives?'</p>

<p>'Of course I am,' he answered, 'and I would do a great deal to
bring the thief to justice.'</p>

<p>'You do not speak mere words in saying that?' I asked, with a
significant emphasis on my words. What do you mean?' he demanded
angrily.</p>

<p>'To be perfectly plain, I mean are you sincere when you say you
would be glad to bring the thief to justice?'</p>

<p>This question seemed to anger him to such an extent that his
dark eyes flashed fire, and his face became scarlet.</p>

<p>'Do you suppose,' he exclaimed with strong energy, 'that I am
the thief?'</p>

<p>'My suppositions and my thoughts are my own,' I remarked, by no
means disturbed by his outburst.</p>

<p>He was almost beside himself, and I thought he was meditating
falling upon me and crushing me.</p>

<p>'By heavens!' he cried, as he brought his fist down on the
table, 'if you insinuate that I am the thief, I will make you prove
your words at whatever cost.'</p>

<p>I smiled at his threat, and answered&mdash;</p>

<p>'I have not said that I suspected you; but there is a good deal
of mystery in this case, and I am trying to get to the bottom of
it. Now, there is one thing you won't attempt to deny, and that is
you are very familiar with Isabella Martin?'</p>

<p>'And what if I am?'</p>

<p>'A good deal, as far as I am concerned. Isabella has left the
protection of her father and mother, and is living under
yours.'</p>

<p>'That is a lie,' he hissed.</p>

<p>'You will not deny that you dined with her at a restaurant in
Oxford Street last Thursday?'</p>

<p>'No; I do not deny it.'</p>

<p>'You will also admit that she wears clothes that are quite out
of keeping with her station in life.'</p>

<p>'Her station in life is that which she likes to make for
herself,' he answered somewhat ambiguously.</p>

<p>'Granted. But you will not deny that within the last few
weeks&mdash;that is, since the robbery&mdash;her circumstances have
changed?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't deny it, and I will go so far as to admit that I
have bought her clothes, and that she left her situation at the
theatre at my suggestion.'</p>

<p>'Not because she was going to get married, then?'</p>

<p>'Married!' he exclaimed with a sarcastic laugh.</p>

<p>'Yes. Are you not aware that she is married?'</p>

<p>'No, indeed I am not. If I were, I would throw her up
to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'You are in love with her, then?'</p>

<p>'I am much attached to her.'</p>

<p>'Now then, Mr. Cohen, since you make that admission, there is
one pointed question I must put to you, and on your answer to it
much depends.'</p>

<p>'What is it?' he asked sharply.</p>

<p>'Do you believe sincerely that you have Miss Isabella Martin's
undivided affection?'</p>

<p>He paused before making reply, and looked at me keenly, then
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes, undoubtedly I do.'</p>

<p>'And if you were proved to be in the wrong, what then?'</p>

<p>'What then! By Abraham, I would kill her.'</p>

<p>The force and fire displayed in this answer pointed to his
sincerity; and his tone, manner, and expression of face indicated
that he was sincere.</p>

<p>'Then you don't think she is playing a double game with
you?'</p>

<p>'No,' he answered emphatically, 'indeed I do not.'</p>

<p>'Will you give me her address?'</p>

<p>'Certainly,' and, without hesitation, he told me where she was
living.</p>

<p>So far, then, I had gained a point, and I lost no time in
proceeding to the address; and I found that the young lady occupied
a bedroom and sitting-room, as a single young woman, in a large and
respectable house in Kensington. She herself was out, but from
inquiries I made I learned that the only caller she had was a
gentleman whose name was not known, but whose description tallied
with Cohen's. This seemed to involve matters again, and I felt that
there was some deception somewhere, and I resolved to shadow Bella.
Very soon my persistency was rewarded. I followed her one day from
her lodgings to Hampstead, and saw her meet a man whose appearance
answered in every way that described by the woman at the theatre.
Here, then, was a discovery, and there could no longer be any doubt
that Bella was playing a double game. I saw them enter a house
together, and, later on, I called there, and found out that Miss
Bella and the dark gentleman were known as Mr. and Mrs.
Shernsky.</p>

<p>My next step was to see Cohen again, and ask him if he knew of a
Mr. Shernsky, and he gave me the most positive assurance that he
had never heard the name in his life before, and when I told him
that Isabella was keeping company with a man of that name, and
passing as his wife, he became furious. After a time he calmed
down, and then said that he had worshipped the very ground Miss
Martin had walked on, but now was disposed to think she had grossly
deceived him. He was for rushing off to her at once, but I stopped
him by saying he might prevent my discovering the thief if he did
anything rashly, and, though evidently overcome with grief, he
consented to place himself in my hands.</p>

<p>I quickly decided on a plan to pursue, and that was to see
Isabella Martin, which I did without further delay; and, having
obtained an interview with her, I went straight to the point
without any beating about the bush.</p>

<p>'You are acquainted with a Mr. Shernsky?' I began.</p>

<p>At this question she changed colour, and betrayed great
confusion as she stammered out a 'No,' but then checked herself,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, I did know a person of that name.'</p>

<p>'How long ago?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Some months,' she answered with downcast eyes, and evidently
feeling very uneasy.</p>

<p>'Your notions of time, Miss Martin, seem to be vague,' I
remarked. 'It is but two days ago I saw you enter a house at
Hampstead with him.'</p>

<p>For a moment she cast a furtive glance at me; then, covering her
face with her hands, she burst into tears, and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'I don't know what you mean by playing the spy on me like that.
What has it got to do with you whether I know Shernsky or not?'</p>

<p>'Well, it may have a good deal to do with me, and it is very
certain it has much to do with Mr. Samuel Cohen, who believes in
you implicitly.'</p>

<p>She threw herself on to a sofa, and continued to sob bitterly. I
let her go on for a while, and then I said&mdash;</p>

<p>'It is no use your trying to deceive me, for, depend upon it,
whatever the truth is, I shall get it out. Tell me now, who is
Shernsky?'</p>

<p>I had to ask her several times before she answered me, and each
time I gave more emphasis to my question. At last she sobbed
out&mdash;</p>

<p>'He is my husband.'</p>

<p>'Are you sure?'</p>

<p>'Yes. It's true; it's true; it's true,' she repeated
hysterically.</p>

<p>'When were you married?'</p>

<p>'Two months ago.'</p>

<p>'Your husband is a foreigner?'</p>

<p>'Yes. He is a Pole.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Cohen does not know him?'</p>

<p>'No, indeed he does not. I have deceived him.'</p>

<p>Then suddenly, with a heart-bursting sob, she threw herself on
her knees at my feet, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Oh, I will tell you all; I will tell you all if you will not
punish me.'</p>

<p>Then, without giving me time to reply, she told me in substance
the following story:&mdash;</p>

<p>She had made the acquaintance of Shernsky about six months
before at the theatre; and he almost immediately professed great
love for her, and in a very short time he acquired over her a most
remarkable influence. He had already got to know, according to her
statement, that she lived under Moses's premises, and he proposed
to her that they should rob the place, but subsequently he told her
that she was to get from Cohen, who was infatuated with her, all
the particulars she could about Moses's business, and he promised
to marry her if he could make a good haul. She had acquired so much
power over Cohen that she used to ask him questions about the
business, and he answered her without suspecting her object. It was
thus that she came to know that his firm were to receive a large
packet of rubies, and this information she gave to her Polish
lover, who thereupon made arrangements to rob the place. It was at
first arranged that on the morning of the robbery Isabella was to
send a message to Cohen, saying she wished to see him, so as to get
him away from the place. But before she could do this, he by a
strange chance went out, and she immediately communicated with
Shernsky, who was loitering in the street.</p>

<p>Shortly after the robbery Shernsky married her. At first he
wanted to back out of that part of the arrangement, but she
threatened to denounce him, and under that threat he made her his
wife; and he had ever since done nothing but urge her to obtain
money from Cohen, who had already supplied her very liberally.</p>

<p>Such was the remarkable confession she made to me, and, placing
her in safe hands, I lost no time in going in search of Shernsky,
and that night arrested him. Her story was proved to be true in
every particular, and I got evidence that left no doubt Shernsky
was meditating flight and the abandonment of his wife; but he
lingered rather too long, and I was enabled to spoil his little
game, much to his amazement. We proved also beyond doubt that he
himself wrote the letter which was sent to the police, and also
that he was one of a gang of most notorious thieves, whose
operations extended all over Europe. It may be imagined what
Cohen's feelings were when he discovered how the pretty Jezebel had
deceived him; and, though a terrible lesson for him, it was a
salutary one.</p>

<p>As regards the property, we ascertained that the gems were sent
abroad soon after the robbery, and we could not recover them; but a
sum of money amounting to nearly four thousand pounds was found in
Shernsky's possession.</p>

<p>In due course he was tried, and sentenced to ten years' penal
servitude. The unhappy Bella was not proved to be legally
blameable, and so she escaped, but during her ten years of grass
widowhood she, no doubt, had time to reflect that the
stepping-stone to happiness is not that of crime.</p>

VI. &mdash; BREAKING UP A GANG OF DESPERADOES</h2>

<p>DURING one of the darkest, dreariest, and most severe winters
that had been known for many years, something that approached very
near a panic reigned in London owing to a series of daring
burglaries. The expertness and ingenuity with which these robberies
were carried out, and a certain similarity in the <i>modus
operandi</i> pursued, suggested the strong feasibility that an
audacious and well-organised gang of rascals were at work. No
partiality was shown for any particular district, and the
enterprising cracksmen seemed to be ubiquitous. Bolts and bars,
apparently, offered no impediment to these gentlemen of the night,
while dogs, large and small, that were relied upon by householders
to give warning of approaching danger, were in some mysterious
manner silenced and killed, as was supposed, with some powerful
drug.</p>

<p>It can easily be understood that such a state of matters caused
a widespread feeling of alarm, for the frequency of the robberies
was really remarkable, and people wrote to the papers making all
sorts of complaints, wild charges, and absurd suggestions. One man
went so far as to hint that the police had been bribed wholesale by
a wealthy syndicate of expert cracksmen in order that these
gentlemen might pursue their avocations of the night with impunity.
Another suggested that every householder whose premises were worth
robbing should have two ferocious bloodhounds roaming loose in his
house at night. A third thought that it would be a good plan to
have a battery of pistol barrrels heavily loaded with shot, so
arranged near the likeliest place of ingress for the thieves that
on a door or window being opened a concealed spring and wire should
fire the battery and stretch the intruders dead. No less absurd and
laughable was the demand of a lady that two or three regiments of
cavalry should be used as patrols during the night, owing to the
'utter inefficiency of the police to protect the peaceful citizens
of the largest and most heavily-taxed city of the world.'</p>

<p>In some of the outlying districts where robberies had been
frequent, notably in Dulwich, Hampstead, Hounslow, Blackheath, the
residents formed 'Vigilance Committees,' and patrolled the roads at
night, armed with sticks and revolvers. While the diverging points
of the compass at which the various places enumerated are situated
serve to show how far a-field the burglars roamed, the action of
the citizens proved how deep was the alarm that had been spread
through the Metropolis. Perhaps it is unnecessary to say that
robberies of this kind could only be continued for any length of
time in a great city, for it follows, as a matter of course, that,
however well such a city may be guarded with police, there must
necessarily be some weak points. Perhaps this applies more strongly
to London than to any other city, owing to the enormous extent of
the outlying suburbs. The reader need scarcely be informed that the
system pursued in 'policing' a city is to apportion one policeman
to so many thousand inhabitants. Consequently, it does not require
much calculation to determine approximately the area a single
guardian of the peace has to keep watch and ward over. It thus
follows that an organised gang of determined men, following out
some well-defined plan of action, may for a time set the watchers
at defiance, and find the weak places in the chain of defence. I
was in London at the time, and was one of a number of detectives
who received instructions to do everything possible to try and stop
the burglaries by capturing the rascals. We had not a doubt in our
own minds that we had to deal with an exceedingly expert gang, who
had served an apprenticeship to their calling, and that, therefore,
our work was cut out. Nevertheless, I, for one at least, was
strongly of opinion we should effect a capture. For in every gang,
and this applies particularly to criminals, there must be some weak
members, who, sooner or later, betray their weakness. In the case
of criminals, this takes the form often of stupidity, which leads
to clues being obtained. When it became known that active steps
were about to be taken by the authorities, and that the services of
some of the ablest detectives of the day had been called into
requisition, there was a cessation of the burglaries, and the
citizens began to breathe more freely. But in the course of two or
three weeks&mdash;I think it was about the middle of
January&mdash;London was once more startled by the news of a most
extensive burglary and murderous outrage committed at the house of
Mr. Thomas Druce Mayland, M.P., the house, a large mansion, being
situated in one of the western suburbs. At the time, Mr. Mayland,
who was in bad health (he died shortly afterwards), was sojourning
in the south of France, together with his wife, two daughters, and
a son; and Mr. Mayland's sister&mdash;an elderly lady&mdash;had
been left in charge of his house. Seven servants slept on the
premises, including a butler; and over the stables, which were at
the back, and separated from the house by a courtyard, half-a-dozen
men slept, including coachman and stablemen. The house was very
isolated, stood in a somewhat lonely situation, and was surrounded
by about four acres of ground. As it had always been considered
that the place offered strong temptation to the enterprising and
energetic burglar, every precaution that could be thought of had
been taken to render his efforts futile should he at any time
decide to attempt to 'crack the crib.' In addition to unusual
safeguards being adopted with windows and doors, a large mastiff
was allowed the freedom of the lower part of the house at night,
and another mastiff was kept chained to a kennel that was placed at
the back of the house. Both these dogs were unusually fine
specimens of their kind, and were considered to be invaluable as
watch-dogs. Nevertheless, both dogs, which were worth a large sum,
were killed before they were enabled to give any alarm.</p>

<p>Entrance to the premises had been effected through a
conservatory that abutted on the courtyard where the stables were,
but so silently and skilfully had this been done that none of the
men who slept over the stables were disturbed. When the burglars
got into the conservatory they had between them and a small back
Fitting-room, used chiefly by the servants, an iron-lined door, but
this, apparently, offered but small obstacle, for a panel had been
cut cleanly and neatly out, and through the opening thus made the
burglars got into the room, where they were confronted with a
double-locked door that gave access to the entrance hall. The
locks, however, were soon picked, as were other locks on other
doors, including what was known as 'the plate-room,' an unusually
strong room where the family silver and other valuables were
stored. Adjoining this room the butler, a middle-aged, powerful
man, slept, and he always kept a loaded gun and a revolver by his
bedside, and by one pull of a bell-rope within reach of his hand as
he lay in bed he could ring a bell in all the principal rooms of
the house. But, notwithstanding these precautions, a
ruffian&mdash;the door having been opened with skeleton
keys&mdash;crept stealthily in, removed the weapons, and cut the
bell-rope before the butler was disturbed from his sleep. All this
seemed to prove that the thieves were well acquainted with the
house and its arrangements.</p>

<p>When the butler did awake, owing to some noise, and realised
that a man was in his room, he reached out for the bell-rope, but
couldn't find it. He then sprang out of bed, but found both pistol
and gun were gone, and he immediately precipitated himself on the
intruder, whom he would speedily have overcome had others not
rushed in to their comrade's rescue; and on the butler uttering a
warning shout he was felled and stunned by a tremendous blow with
what was supposed to be a life-preserver. His cry, unfortunately,
failed to arouse the rest of the household, and the ruffians thus
had a clear course, and they made the best use of their time and
opportunities. Having effected an entrance into the plate-room,
they carried off something like three thousand pounds' worth of
silver and jewellery that was kept in a small safe let into the
wall, and which they succeeded in opening. Having secured the swag,
the cold-blooded villains did not proceed upstairs, but descended
to the kitchen, and obtaining entrance to the wine-cellar, they
drank half-a-dozen bottles of old port, three of champagne, and a
bottle of sherry, and ate up a sirloin of cooked beef, a loaf of
bread, and a bottle of pickles, which they got from the pantry.
Having thus refreshed themselves they left the house with the
valuables they had secured, taking with them also a solid and
massive gold cup that was kept in the drawing-room under a glass
shade. The cup was an heirloom, and had been in the family for many
generations.</p>

<p>Some time after the ruffians had gone the butler regained
consciousness so far as to be able to give an alarm, but the
thieves had had a good start, and were clear away. A doctor was at
once summoned to attend to the butler, who was found to be
suffering from concussion of the brain, and so terrific had been
the force of the blow that had felled him that there was a fracture
of the skull, and the doctor had the unfortunate man conveyed to
the hospital.</p>

<p>In the meantime information had been sent to the nearest police
station, and news was at once telegraphed to Scotland Yard, and I
received instructions to proceed immediately to Mr. Mayland's house
and make inquiries into all the details of the robbery. As may
readily be supposed, I found the household in a great state of
excitement, and Mr. Mayland's sister was suffering from nervous
prostration.</p>

<p>The way in which the burglars had gained entrance to the mansion
was obvious enough; but what was not so clear was the way the dogs
had been silenced. They were both noble animals, and had been
purchased specially with a view to their being house guards. That
they had failed in their duty was not due to any demerits of their
own, but to treachery and expertness on the part of the
thieves.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The way in which the dogs had been silenced
and killed was subsequently discovered, but in the interests of
justice I do not deem it prudent to make it known.]</p>

<p>I found that the housebreakers had left behind them a jemmy, a
packet of centre bits, a box of silent matches, and a large single
blade pocket knife with a massive horn handle, on which the
initials 'J. T.' were rudely carved. The first-named articles were
not likely to afford a clue, for they were the common
stock-in-trade of every burglar; but the knife I regarded with keen
interest, for I felt that it was likely to be of value. Indeed, a
knife of that kind was not altogether a common article&mdash;that
is, in a sense, for, though cheap, it was not of the shape and make
of those generally used by the lower and working classes, and it
struck me as being of foreign manufacture. I therefore regarded
this circumstance as strongly in favour of an arrest being made
that might have very important results; and so impressed was I with
this that I deemed it highly important to keep the finding of the
knife to myself, knowing as I did that if the incident was
mentioned in the papers it might very materially damage my chances
of following up the clue, by putting the rascals on their
guard.</p>

<p>The indignation that made itself manifest throughout London when
the burglary and outrage became known was very strong, and no
wonder, having regard to the number of robberies that had preceded
it. Of course, a demand was made on the part of the public that the
most strenuous efforts should be put forth to bring the malefactors
to justice. That the police were desirous of doing this goes
without saying, but as they did not possess superhuman powers they
could not perform impossibilities. That they had been baffled so
far served to show the cunning and organisation, no less than the
daring, of the burglars; but it was a moral certainty that the
forces of law and order would triumph in the end, for in a great
community of civilised people outrage and robbery cannot long run
rampant.</p>

<p>Day after day, however, went by, and the days became weeks, and
still the burglary at Mr. Mayland's house ranked as an undiscovered
crime. During all this time the butler remained in the hospital, at
one time his life being despaired of. But he gradually recovered,
although it was painfully evident that he would never be the same
man again. He was unable to give any account of the affair beyond
what I have already recorded&mdash;namely, that on being aroused he
instinctively felt for the bell-rope and found it gone. He then
sprang from the bed to secure the weapons, when he became conscious
of 'a shock to the head,' and remembered no more until there was a
partial return to consciousness, during which he realised that
something was wrong; and, struggling to the door, he raised an
alarm. As he could not furnish us with even the roughest
description of his assailant, it will be clear to the reader that
difficulties of no ordinary kind lay in our way. It was
significant, too, that the robberies ceased for the time at any
rate, and this seemed to point distinctly to organisation on the
part of the thieves, who, becoming alarmed at the hue and cry they
had raised, had resolved to remain quiet until the public had once
more been lulled into a sense of security, when probably they would
go to work again.</p>

<p>During all this time I had pursued an independent course. That
is, I had not identified myself with any fixed plan of my
colleagues. So far I had not been successful, nor had they. Several
arrests had been made, but as nothing could be proved against the
suspects they were liberated, and we had to confess ourselves
baffled. Speaking for myself, I was by no means discouraged. I had
faith in my star, and was quite sanguine that ultimately I should
be able to lay my hands on some of the robbers. In accordance with
a rule I always made in similar cases I frequented the haunts of
the criminal classes, knowing that it was there that clues were
most likely to be obtained. At that time, as indeed it does now,
Kent Street in the Borough, that is on the south side of London,
bore a very evil reputation. Many of its dens&mdash;for dens they
were&mdash;sheltered some of the vilest specimens of humanity of
both sexes, and children of tender years were here trained for
criminal lives.</p>

<p>Since the robbery at Mr. Mayland's I had frequented Kent Street
a good deal, hopeful that I might stumble across something that
would put me on the scent of those I was so anxious to capture. One
night I entered a public-house, in the bar of which a number of men
were drinking. It was a wretched night outside. The air was filled
with sleet and the atmosphere was bitterly cold, so that the
streets were all but deserted, and the public-houses were driving a
roaring trade. Amongst the men I recognised two or three criminals
well known to the police. One of them had served several terms of
penal servitude, and had only been out of prison about six months.
I had attired myself in such a way that I might have been taken for
a fellow exceedingly down on his luck, and ripe for any venture so
long as it promised money. As soon as I entered a dozen pair of
eyes were cast on me suspiciously and scrutinisingly, for in such a
neighbourhood a stranger is instantly spotted. I called for a
humble half-pint of four half,' and made pretence of having some
difficulty in finding in my pockets the necessary penny to pay for
it. My entrance had interrupted the conversation that had been
going on, but as I stood there, seemingly indifferent to all my
surroundings, the talk was resumed, and I soon gathered that the
subject was the death of a 'pal's' wife, who was referred to as 'a
bloomin' fine 'ooman.' This opinion, however, did not meet with
unanimous approval, for one fellow said, with a sneer on his ugly
face&mdash;</p>

<p>'Nell, mates, that ain't my idea. I believe she wasn't all
square.'</p>

<p>'How do you mean, Jimmy?' asked another fellow.</p>

<p>'Well, I mean as she would round on any bloke as she didn't
happen to like.'</p>

<p>Look here, old chum,' said the other man, with a smothered
menace, and something of a warning in his tone and manner, 'I
know'd Jan Thorson's wife well, and I ain't agoin' to hear anything
said agen her. I tell yer she was jannock, and many a good turn she
done for coves what was in trouble.'</p>

<p>This emphatic utterance found a general echo amongst the
company, with the exception of the man who had expressed an opinion
that she wasn't 'all square.' But, finding that he was in such a
small minority, he simply growled out an iteration of his views,
and then held his peace.</p>

<p>This fragment of conversation amongst these ruffians would have
possessed no earthly interest for me had it not been for the name
that had been uttered&mdash;that is, 'Jan Thorson.' It is a Danish
name, and it will be noted that the initials, J. T., corresponded
with those cut into the horn handle of the knife I had found at Mr.
Mayland's house after the robbery. Of course I did not overlook the
fact that there were hundreds of christian and surnames beginning
with J and T, but the coincidence in this case was sufficiently
remarkable to arrest my attention when taken into consideration
with other details, chief of these being the company I was in, and
the peculiarity of the name, which I knew to be Danish; and then I
suddenly remembered that the knife in my possession seemed to be a
foreign made knife. If that was really so it was significant.
Wishing to draw the men out, I said, speaking for the first time,
and addressing myself to the man whose opinion of Jan Thorson's
wife was at variance with his comrades&mdash;</p>

<p>'That's a curious name, mate, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'What name?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Why, the name of the woman you were talking about.'</p>

<p>'Thorson, you mean?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Well, it ain't a Hinglish name,' he remarked.</p>

<p>'Jan's a&mdash;what's the name of the place where he comes
from?' he asked, appealing to one of his pals.</p>

<p>'Blowed if I know,' was the answer. 'It's some furrin part.'</p>

<p>'Was his wife furrin?' I queried.</p>

<p>'Not she. She coined from Scotland.'</p>

<p>'And she's dead?'</p>

<p>'Yes. She was a bully sort.'</p>

<p>'Did she live about here?' I asked in a seemingly unconcerned
way.</p>

<p>'Well, she lived not a hundred miles from this,' the man
answered cautiously, and then as he looked at me from under his
lowering eyebrows he remarked, 'You don't doss in this
neighbourhood, mate, do you?'</p>

<p>'No. I've shanked it from the country.'</p>

<p>'And what lay are you on?'</p>

<p>'Blowed if I mind what it is; I ain't particular.'</p>

<p>I saw the men exchange glances with each other. Then one of them
called for more beer and offered me a drink, and as soon as the
fresh supply was consumed they went out, the one who stood the beer
saying as he went&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, so-long old pal, we may be dropping across yer
again.'</p>

<p>'You may,' I replied with some significance, although they did
not seem to notice it. As I had no particular interest in tracking
these men I did not follow them. What concerned me more was to try
and discover some particulars of Jan Thorson. That he lived
somewhere in the neighbourhood was pretty certain, or the death of
his wife would hardly have been a subject of conversation in the
pothouse; and if his wife was just dead, I did not think there
would be much difficulty in learning soma particulars, for she must
have been buried somewhere, and those who buried her would know
where the husband lived. So the following morning I set to work,
and, pushing my inquiries in the most likely quarters, I was soon
in possession of the information that Mrs. Jan Thorson had died
nine days ago, and three days ago had had quite an imposing
funeral, and was buried in Norwood Cemetery. She had resided with
her husband in a court of very evil repute off Kent Street.</p>

<p>My next step was to make the acquaintance of Jan himself, and I
ascertained that a favourite haunt of his was the bar-room of a
public-house in the Old Kent Road, and thither I betook myself,
with the result that in the course of a night or two I found myself
in the veritable Jan's company. He was a big and powerful fellow,
with a heavy beard, small blue eyes, and a strongly marked face.
His general appearance was by no means suggestive of the criminal.
He would have passed for a brewer's drayman, a waggoner, or a
ploughman, or any kindred calling of that nature, for his burliness
and fresh colour were suggestive of an open-air life, with hard
manual labour. That his looks were deceptive, however, I had no
manner of doubt, or I should not have found him in the company I
did find him in, for several of his companions were well known to
the police as 'bad characters,' and one was a ticket-of-leave
man.</p>

<p>The day before I had submitted the knife found at Mr. Mayland's
house to a well-known cutler in Piccadilly, and he had at once
pronounced it as being of Danish make. This was very significant,
and seemed to me that it could hardly be a coincidence, and I began
to think that Jan Thorson had been mixed up with the burglary at
Mayland's. I therefore determined to resort to a little ruse,
which, I hoped, might bring forth some result that would strengthen
my position, and enable me to follow the clue up. The ruse was
this. I called for some bread and cheese, and though a table-knife
was brought with it, I took out the horn-handled knife from my
pocket wherewith to cut the cheese and bread; and as I was sitting
at the same table as Jan, I took good care the knife should not
escape his observation, for I placed it on the table now and again
so that he could not help but see it, and all the time I watched
him narrowly. I saw him at last look steadily at the knife. He was
smoking a long pipe, and, removing the pipe from his lips, he
leaned forward a little the better to inspect the knife, and I said
to myself mentally, 'That fellow owned that knife as sure as I am
sitting here.' The expression on his face was one of amazement, and
at last he said&mdash;</p>

<p>'That is a curious sort of knife you have there, mate. Will you
let me see it?'</p>

<p>Although he spoke fairly good English, his foreign accent was
very pronounced. Of course I handed him the knife instantly, and
watched his face with the keenness of a hawk watching its prey. His
face betrayed him. He recognised the knife. The initials were his.
He handed it to one of his companions, and they muttered something
together. Then, turning to me, he asked&mdash;</p>

<p>'Where did you pick up that thing, mate?'</p>

<p>Unless I aroused his suspicions I had no alternative but to make
a deliberate misstatement, so I answered curtly&mdash;</p>

<p>'Bought it.'</p>

<p>'Where?'</p>

<p>'At a marine store dealer's.'</p>

<p>After a pause, during which he seemed to be pondering the matter
in his mind, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Are you open to trade? I've taken a fancy to that knife.'</p>

<p>'What will you give?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Two and a kick' (two and sixpence).</p>

<p>'It's a bargain,' I said, and he handed me the half-crown, and I
felt that he had given himself away, and that I was now in a fair
way of making a revelation.</p>

<p>This incident of the knife was certainly a most remarkable one,
and seemed to border almost on fiction, but real life, as every one
knows, is full of startling circumstances, that, viewed casually,
tax one's credulity. But some of the greatest criminals who have
ever disgraced the world have been tracked down owing to some
slight sign that has led to others, until, link by link, a chain of
evidence has been woven that has dragged the guilty person to his
doom.</p>

<p>Having got upon the track of Jan Thorson, my plan was to watch
him narrowly. I might, of course, have arrested him at once on
suspicion; but had I done that I should have made a mistake, for
not only would it have been a difficult matter, in all probability,
to get evidence against him, but the rest of his associates would
have taken alarm, and cleared out. Now, it was an absolute
certainty that Jan did not commit the burglary at Mr. Mayland's
single-handed, and it was almost as certain that the other
burglaries which had caused such a widespread feeling of uneasiness
throughout London had been the work of the same band, and a
detective would have been unworthy the name if he had done anything
premature which would have prevented him capturing all
concerned.</p>

<p>I found that there was nothing known of Jan Thorson in Scotland
Yard; but neighbourhood in which he lived had one of the worst
reputations in the Metropolis.</p>

<p>I soon learnt that Jan rented an apartment in the house of a man
named Samuel Birket, who ostensibly followed the occupation of a
wharf porter in Bermondsey. But Samuel had done his 'bit,' having
suffered six months' imprisonment for assault, and twelve months
for having stolen a gold watch from an officer's berth on board of
a steamer he was helping to unload at the wharf. Consequently, Mr.
Birket had graduated in the school of crime, and was likely to be
acquainted with the rogues about him. Since his last conviction,
however, he had kept out of trouble. Perhaps it would be better to
say that he had managed not to be found out in any evil doing he
may have been guilty of, for it wanted a good deal of faith to
believe that after being such a sinner he had suddenly become a
saint. Indeed, saints are not made out of such stuff as Mr. Samuel
Birket was composed of, for he was a great, coarse, hulking fellow,
with a hangdog, murderous expression of face and the money he
earned at the wharves he for the most part spent on drink, and it
was said that when 'Sammy' was drunk he was a caution to snakes and
the terror of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Besides Jan Thorson, Samuel had another lodger in the person of
an old man who was known as 'Bags,' but whose real name was John
Smith. And this gentleman got his living by buying and selling old
boots and shoes, umbrellas, hats, and cast-off garments of all
kinds. 'Bags' was an old man, upwards of seventy, without, as it
seemed, a friend or relative in the world&mdash;at any rate, none
that he owned to. So much did I learn of Bags, and though possibly
he was harmless enough, I could not help thinking that, in all
probability, he was not averse to doing a bit of fencing if it came
in his way. But the miserable manner in which he eked out his
existence showed that his transgressions in that respect must have
been light, unless the miser's greed prompted him, which was not
improbable. However, I felt little or no interest in Bags, and have
only made a passing reference to him as being a lodger of Mr.
Samuel Birket's. My object was to get at the history of Jan
Thorson. This much I learned&mdash;he claimed to be an engraver by
trade, but was out of employment. His wife had followed the calling
of a charwoman, and in that capacity it struck me that she might
have been of great assistance to her husband by giving him tips as
to likely houses to be cracked. However, that was mere surmise. I
could obtain no evidence of it.</p>

<p>Such information as I picked up was obtained in a very
fragmentary way, and the greatest caution had to be exercised, and
my object carefully concealed, for the class of people in that
neighbourhood were all more or less tarred with the same brush, and
if one had suspected that one of their neighbours was wanted, the
news would have spread like wildfire and everything been done to
frustrate justice. To use a simile, they were a pack of wolves, and
I had to assume the character of a wolf, for if they had thought I
was a hunter they would have cleared out. As regards Jan Thorson,
his movements were mysterious, and I could not apply for
information to either 'Sammy' or 'Bags,' for I felt sure that they
were not to be trusted. But there was a Mrs. Sammy; that is, Mr.
Samuel Birket had a wife, by no means an attractive lady. She had
long passed the prime of life, and her face was strongly marked
with drink and vice. She followed the humble occupation of a
washerwoman, going out to people's houses whenever she could get a
job.</p>

<p>The detective in the interests of justice often has to make
strange allies, and I felt that Mrs. Birket might prove of value;
but I was sure from her surroundings and connections she would have
to be approached very cautiously, and so I arranged the following
little plan. I was acquainted with a young couple who resided at
Kennington, which, for the benefit of such of my readers who may
not know London, I may state is situated on the south side also,
and not two miles from Kent Street; but Kennington is a highly
respectable neighbourhood. This couple had not very long been
married, and at my request the lady agreed to engage Mrs. Birket to
do a day's washing occasionally, and under my pilotage the servant
penetrated into the unsalubrious purlieus of Kent Street, and
requested Sammy's wife to call on her mistress with a view to an
engagement to do the family washing. Mrs. Birket lost no time in
starting off for Kennington, with the result that it was arranged
she was to go on a certain day, and if she gave satisfaction, she
would possibly be offered a job one day in every week.</p>

<p>On the first day that she began her work I was at the house, and
managed to get into conversation with Mrs. Birket. She had never,
as far as I knew, seen me before in her life, and I won her
confidence by making some inquiries as to how she had come by a
black eye from which she was suffering, and on her telling me that
'her man' had been 'bashing' her, I expressed disgust, and advised
her to give him into custody when he assaulted her again.</p>

<p>'Well,' she exclaimed, 'I should have to do that pretty often,
for he gets drunk two or three times a week, and always on a
Saturday, and if he gets a chance he always knocks me about.'</p>

<p>I found by careful probing that while she was willing enough to
speak of her husband's weakness in this respect, she was by no
means inclined to give any other information either about him or
their lodgers, so that I began to think that, after all, Mrs.
Birket would be of no use as an ally.</p>

<p>The following week she came to the house twice, and I had
opportunities of conversing with her, and I found that, under the
influences of a 'drop o' gin,' she was disposed to be more
communicative, though this went no further than a confession that
sometimes she forgot what was due to her womanhood, and indulged a
bit too freely, and that then she had a very nagging tongue, and
she and her 'old man' not infrequently had a pitched battle.</p>

<p>It suddenly dawned upon me that I might turn this knowledge to
account, for if I could manage to arrest Birket on some pretence
there was the possibility of my learning something about him and
his connection with Jan Thorson. For I went upon the hypothesis
that he could not be ignorant of Jan's doings, if Jan was what I
suspected him to be.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this idea, I called at the Birket's residence on
the following Saturday night without having previously informed the
lady of my intention. My acquaintance with her so far served me
that she readily admitted me to the house, on my telling
her&mdash;which was a fact&mdash;that my friends wished her to go
to Kennington on the Monday to help to clean their house down.</p>

<p>I had purposely made the hour late. It was after ten, and when
she asked me to go in she said&mdash;</p>

<p>'My Sam's in the kitchen as drunk as a fool, and as quarrelsome
as a wild cat.'</p>

<p>She said this by way of an apology, as it were, for taking me
into a foetid, squalid, dirty little room, containing a table and
chair and very little else. Scarcely had we entered the room when
Mr. Birket burst in upon us, and with an oath that was calculated
to make one's blood curdle he demanded money from his wife.</p>

<p>He was stupidly intoxicated, and in that condition when a man of
his disposition is as dangerous as an uncaged hyena.</p>

<p>'I've no money for you,' she snapped. 'You've boozed all your
own away, and you ain't going to have mine.'</p>

<p>This seemed to arouse him to fury, and suddenly he turned on me,
and asked who I was. She answered for me.</p>

<p>'He's a gent what's come from some people I work for to tell me
to go up on Monday to do some cleaning.'</p>

<p>Apparently this satisfied him so far, and, ignoring my presence,
he again demanded money from his wife, which she again refused, and
he muttered with another oath&mdash;</p>

<p>'I'll take it out of your hide, old woman, before the night's
finished.' Then he retired to the kitchen again.</p>

<p>'Does he mean what he says?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Does he!' she exclaimed. 'I should think he does. He'll half
murder me if he gets the chance.'</p>

<p>'Why don't you give him in charge?' I said.</p>

<p>'Well, I've often thought of doing that, and I've told him so,
too.'</p>

<p>'Don't think about it, but do it. Why should you let a ruffian
like that knock you about, though he is your husband?'</p>

<p>'I'm blowed if I don't give him in charge,' she said, 'if he
hits me again; for the fact is, to tell you God's truth, he ain't
my husband at all.'</p>

<p>This little revelation did not astonish me, and I saw that it
was calculated to work in my favour. As I had no further excuse for
stopping, but having a sort of intuitive feeling that there would
be a row between the man and woman before the night was over, I
resolved to see the policeman on the beat and tell him to be on the
alert. He was an intelligent man and knew the house well, and told
me that never a Saturday passed hardly but what there was a row.
And, sure enough, there was a row on this particular Saturday
night. It appears that about three quarters of an hour after I had
gone the woman left the house with a jug to go and get some beer
before the public-house closed. Birket, who had heard her go out,
rushed after her and again demanded money, which she again refused.
Thereupon he seized the jug and struck her a heavy blow upon the
head. Her screams brought the policeman to the spot, and, half-mad
with rage, and half-blinded with the blood that streamed over her
eyes, she gave Birket into custody. But the ruffian was so violent
that it took four policemen to convey him to the station. His
arrest was announced to me the first thing on Monday morning, and I
went down to the station where he was confined and visited him in
his cell. He was a most deplorable object. Pallid as death, with
every limb quivering from the effects of his debauch, his matted
hair hanging over his brows, and his eyes bleared and bloodshot, he
seemed an outrage on God's creation.</p>

<p>He looked up as I entered, and implored me to give him a drink
of beer or he would go mad.</p>

<p>I made this an opportunity for expatiating upon his folly, and
pointed out that drink had made a beast of him, and that if it had
not been for drink his wife would not have given him in charge.</p>

<p>With an oath he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'I didn't think she'd a rounded on me, but I'll have my revenge
for it if she comes agen me this morning.'</p>

<p>A little later he was conveyed to the police court, and, sure
enough, the woman did appear against him, for the policeman who had
arrested Birket took good care to see that she did come. She was
very ill from loss of blood, and so severe had been the wound that
she had to be conveyed to the hospital to have it stitched up, and
she now appeared in court with her head enveloped in bandages.</p>

<p>When she stepped into the witness-box Birket looked at her
ferociously, and for a moment or two she seemed intimidated; but,
encouraged by the magistrate, she told her story, which, being
corroborated by the policemen, and owing to his former convictions,
the magistrate denounced the prisoner as a dangerous ruffian, and
sentenced him to two month's hard labour.</p>

<p>As Soon as he was removed to the cells he said he wanted to see
a detective, and I was sent for.</p>

<p>'I told you,' he said, 'that if she came agen me I'd make her
smart. Her brother's one of the smartest cracksmen in London, and
he's done a lot of jobs lately.'</p>

<p>He informed me that if I went to a certain house in Southwark,
the address of which he gave me, at a particular hour in the
evening, I was almost sure to 'nab the brother and a lot of his
pals.'</p>

<p>I was elated at this information, as may well be imagined, and
that night, accompanied by a brother detective and half-a-dozen
plain-clothes men, I made a raid on the house indicated, with the
result that we arrested a whole gang of thieves, including a Jew
receiver. We also discovered in the house an immense quantity of
stolen property, consisting of plate, jewellery, watches, furs,
carpets, bedding, blankets, rolls of linen, knives and forks,
&amp;c. Not for a long time had such a haul been made.</p>

<p>The men were astounded as we burst in upon them, and at first
seemed disposed to fight; but, recognising the hopelessness of a
struggle&mdash;for they did not know but what we had a strong force
outside&mdash;they allowed themselves to be taken, and, handcuffing
them together, we hurried them off to the nearest station, two of
our number being left in charge of the house.</p>

<p>The following morning all the goods were removed in a van, and a
lot of the property was at once identified as the proceeds of
burglaries in Brixton, Clapham, Dulwich, and Hampstead.</p>

<p>Amongst the prisoners was a young man&mdash;a mere youth, for he
was not more than twenty&mdash;and I at once regarded this fellow
as a likely subject to turn Queen's evidence, and in the course of
a few days I had an opportunity of conversing with him, and
strongly urged him to save himself by giving information that would
be valuable to the prosecution. After some hesitation he said he
would do this, and I then questioned him as to whether he had been
concerned in the robbery at Mr. Mayland's house.</p>

<p>'No, I had nothing to do with it,' he answered; but I heard my
pals talking about it, for it was part of our gang what did
it.'</p>

<p>'Do you know a man named Jan Thorson?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Yes. He's a foreigner. I don't know where he comes from, but
he's a boss crib-cracker, and it was he what done the Mayland
job.'</p>

<p>I felt now that success complete would crown my efforts to break
up this infamous gang, for, besides Thorson, the prisoner gave me
the names of a dozen other men, several of whom were returned
convicts.</p>

<p>My first attention, however, was given to Jan Thorson; and,
armed with a warrant for his arrest, I proceeded to his lodgings,
only to find to my chagrin that the bird had flown. He had taken
flight as soon as he had heard of the arrest of the others, and
deemed it wise to clear out. I did not see Mrs. Birket, for she was
in the hospital, erysipelas having supervened to such an extent
that her life was in danger. A woman, who said she was Mrs.
Birket's cousin, was looking after the house, and she told me that
Thorson had gone away suddenly without saying where he had gone to.
But she expressed an opinion that he had gone to Liverpool, because
she knew that he had a brother there who kept a shop, and he had
sent her to a neighbouring public-house to borrow a railway
guide.</p>

<p>On the strength of this information I started for Liverpool as
soon as possible, determined to leave no stone unturned to track
the fugitive, for I felt that if he escaped the work would not be
complete, notwithstanding the numerous arrests we had made and the
large amount of property that had been recovered. On arriving at my
destination, the first thing I did was to search the directory for
the name of Thorson, for Mrs. Birket's cousin had told me that
Jan's brother kept a shop in Liverpool, but if he did it must have
been under another name, for Thorson did not appear. This was
somewhat of a disappointment, and made my task all the more
difficult. But without a moment's loss of time I had his
description circulated all over the town, and the police were
instructed to keep a sharp look-out. I had strong hopes of catching
Jan, for he was a very conspicuous and, in some respects, a
remarkable man, while his strong foreign accent, which he could not
possibly prevent, would be much against him. A reward of ten pounds
was offered for his betrayal, and I was hopeful that this would be
sufficient inducement for some of the low class people he might
associate with to give him up to justice. As I was obliged to
return to London in connection with the other arrests, I had to
leave the mater in the hands of the Liverpool police, but I felt
confident that if Jan Thorson was in Liverpool he would fall into
the net that had been spread for him sooner or later. When I got
back to town I had the proud satisfaction of learning that I had
been the means of bringing to light a most extraordinary conspiracy
against society, for other arrests had been made, making thirty
altogether; and it was now clear that these desperadoes had banded
themselves together to carry out a series of burglaries all over
the Metropolis, the proceeds of the robberies to be equally
divided. They had actually rented the house in Southwark where the
first arrests were made as a warehouse for the stolen goods, and
nearly every night the receivers used to go there to pay for and
carry off portions of the goods, for in order to avoid bringing
suspicion on their movements only a few things were taken at a
time. The aggregate value of the things amounted to several
thousand pounds, but there was every reason to believe a large
quantity had been disposed of beyond recovery. Several of the gang
had already suffered imprisonment, and they were known to be most
expert housebreakers, so that the public hailed this wholesale
capture with delight. The magistrate had sent all the prisoners for
trial, and we were busy getting evidence that would ensure their
conviction; for, notwithstanding that they were all guilty in a
greater or less degree, it was imperatively necessary to produce
such tangible evidence as would satisfy justice. However, there did
not seem much likelihood of our failing in this respect; for,
besides the young fellow I have alluded to as being willing to turn
Queen's evidence, two of the other prisoners volunteered to 'round
on their pals.' One of these two was accepted, and the result was
we were enabled to gather up details which, put together, made up a
story as startling as anything the annals of crime had revealed for
a long time. Indeed, it seemed pretty clear that we should
ultimately be able to prove that one at least of the prisoners had
been mixed up with a murder case in the city, when an old
woman&mdash;a caretaker in a city warehouse&mdash;had been
barbarously beaten to death by the ruffians to prevent her giving
an alarm. I may state here that the man was in the end convicted of
having taken a hand in the crime, and received a life sentence.</p>

<p>In the meantime, pending the coming trial, I was very anxious
about Jan Thorson, for from what we had now learnt we knew he was
the chief ringleader and a most dangerous pest to society, and to
let him escape was to leave the work unfinished. With a view,
therefore, of trying to get on his track I visited Mrs. Birket in
the hospital, where she was still detained, and still very ill, and
questioned her about Jan, but she assured me that she knew very
little about him, and I should be likely to learn more if I went to
'Bags,' the other lodger, at her husband's house, and so I lost no
time in getting at that individual. He was an old and miserable
sinner, ripe with age, and ready to fall into his grave, but still
clinging to life with that desperate grasp peculiar to such as he.
At first he denied all knowledge of Jan, with the exception of a
casual acquaintance through living under the same roof with him.
But as I had every reason to think the old rascal was keeping
something back, I threatened him with arrest, and that had the
effect of altering his story, and piece by piece I learned that
this hoary rascal had been a sort of jackall to Jan&mdash;that is,
in his capacity of buyer of old rubbish at gentlemen's houses he
was often enabled to gain valuable information about the premises,
and this information he sold to Jan. By hard pressing and threats I
further exacted from the rascal that he had communicated with Jan
since the latter's flight, Jan having written to him to sell some
stolen plate which was stored in a loft of Birket's house, and send
him half the money realised. This request had been carried out by
Bags, and he had sent the money to a house in a street off Ancoats,
Manchester.</p>

<p>As I had not much fear but what I could lay my hands on Bags
when I wanted him, for he was too old, too poor, and too feeble to
get far away, I left him free, and started for Manchester as soon
as I could get a train. I found that the house indicated in Ancoats
was one of evil repute, kept by a Dutch Jew, and in this wretched
place Jan Thorson was lurking. He had considerably altered his
appearance by shaving his face and dyeing his hair, so that a
stranger would have found a difficulty in recognising him from the
printed description that had been circulated. But I recognised him
at once, although, when I accosted him as Jan Thorson, and told him
I had a warrant for his arrest, he waxed indignant, and said that
his name was not Thorson, and that he had never been in London in
his life. Then I reminded him of the little incident of my selling
him his own knife, which he had dropped in Mr. Mayland's house, but
still he protested his innocence, though without avail. When I told
him I should take him notwithstanding, he changed his tone and
manner, and became ferocious, then hurled me against the wall of
the room by a terrific blow on the chest, sprang through a window
in a back yard, jumped over a wall almost with the agility of a
squirrel, and was off. But I was after him by the same route, and
though the blow he had given me had knocked the breath out of me, I
was determined he should not escape, though I died for it. I saw
him disappear at the end of the entry which is peculiar to the
backs of houses in Lancashire and some other parts of England where
rows of houses stand back to back. I tore after him, and, getting
into the street, raised a hue and cry, which was taken up by a
policeman, who sprang his rattle, and other policemen joined in the
chase, which became very exciting; but before I had gone far I
pitched on my face and fainted from the effects of the tremendous
blow the ruffian had given me. I was picked up and taken into a
surgeon's house close by, and in a little time, though suffering
great pain, was enabled to go to my hotel; and very shortly I had
the satisfaction of learning that Jan Thorson had been captured in
some brickfields off the Oldham Road, though not before a desperate
fight, during which he had nearly killed a policeman by hurling a
brick at his head. For this it was necessary that he should be
brought before a local magistrate, and, knowing that he was now in
safe hands, I returned to London, and was laid up for three or four
weeks.</p>

<p>When the trial of the gang came on, Jan Thorson was one of the
gang arraigned, and we were enabled to get together evidence which
clearly established the fact that he had been the prime mover in
the robbery at Mr. Mayland's, and that it was his hand which felled
the butler. And so this wild human beast, together with some of his
companions, was caged for life, and the others got sentences
ranging from five to twenty years. I may as well state that 'Bags'
escaped any punishment that might have been meted out to him as a
seller of goods knowing them to be stolen by shuffling off this
mortal coil. About a fortnight after my interview with him he was
found one morning dead in his bed. Probably the fright he had
received had accelerated his death.</p>

<p>Thus this gang of desperadoes was thoroughly broken up and
dispersed, and the wholesale burglaries ceased.</p>

VII. &mdash; TRAPPING A THIEF-TRAINER</h2>

<p>MANY years ago&mdash;more than I care to count&mdash;in the days
of my youth, I was travelling on the Continent, and at one of the
places where I stayed I was the guest of a Polish family, which
included several young ladies of very lively and inquiring
dispositions. Although well read, they had travelled but little,
and their notions of other peoples and other countries were
sometimes very amusing, and at times even grotesque. It was my
privilege to be much in their company, and the questions they put
to me with regard to England were often exceedingly puzzling, no
less than startling. One of them&mdash;the youngest&mdash;a
charming demoiselle of seventeen, took my breath away one day by
exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now tell me, Mr. Donovan, is it true, as I have heard, that in
your country there are regular training schools for young
thieves?'</p>

<p>I looked at her in astonishment, and said with a
smile&mdash;</p>

<p>'You don't wish me, of course, mademoiselle, to take that
question seriously?'</p>

<p>'Indeed, I do,' she remarked, with a pretty pout. 'Why, I have
even been told that French, and Germans, and Italians send children
over to your country to be specially trained in these schools, and
the tutors make quite a handsome living out of their calling.'</p>

<p>I laughed outright at this, although I was conscious that I was
guilty of rudeness, and I told the young lady that in many cases it
certainly was necessary to go abroad to learn news, and this was a
case in point. I was compelled to confess to entire ignorance of
the subject about which she was anxious to get information, and I
ventured on the assertion that whoever had told her that
'thief-training institutions' existed its England had either been
guilty of libelling the country or had been enjoying a little joke
at her expense.</p>

<p>This remark rather offended her, as it seemed to reflect on her
intelligence, and she said drily&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, well, sir, I suppose you are ashamed to own to the truth,
for I am satisfied that my informant was perfectly serious when he
made the statement; and, in fact, your own great novelist, Charles
Dickens, describes these schools.'</p>

<p>As I did not wish to incur the young lady's lasting displeasure,
I deemed it prudent not to prolong the discussion, and I told her
that personally I had no knowledge of such institutions; but I
would endeavour, for her satisfaction, to try and learn something
about them.</p>

<p>Of course, in my own mind&mdash;as I need scarcely
remark&mdash;I felt that the notion was a ridiculous one, and in
accord with many other absurd ideas that foreigners get with
reference to England.</p>

<p>Long after that happy time, and when that young lady had become
the mother of a numerous family, and after many wanderings over the
face of the globe, destiny cast my lines in Glasgow, where it was
my duty to deal with human crime in its various phases, her
question came back to me with startling force one day when, in the
course of an interview with my chief, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Somewhere, in this town, there is a regular training school for
young thieves, and you must try and root it out.'</p>

<p>Now, I was aware that for some time there had been quite an
epidemic of pocket-picking. The audacity displayed in committing
these petty thefts led to the inference that experts of no mean
order were engaged in the business and were reaping a good harvest.
Ladies were the principal victims, and even the sanctity of the
church did not protect them from the depredations of the
light-fingered gentry, for complaints were numerous of purses and
other things being lost by members of different congregations on
Sunday nights, for the thieves elected evening for their work. It
will be readily understood that under the circumstances
difficulties in the way of detection were very considerable, for
the operations of the pickpockets were spread over a wide area, and
they patronised theatres, 'buses, steamboats, trains, concerts,
public meetings, &amp;c. Complaints were numerous, and though the
ordinary police, as well as the detective staff, were instructed to
exercise unusual vigilance, no arrests were made. It soon became
clear to us, therefore, that we, the watchers, were being watched,
and that we had to deal with a gang of clever thieves, who were
pursuing their calling in a perfectly systematic manner, and using
every possible means to circumvent those who were so desirous to
make their acquaintance.</p>

<p>It was the height of summer&mdash;an exceptionally fine summer
for Scotland&mdash;and large numbers of tourists were daily passing
through the city. As most of these people were well provided with
money, the thieves had a rich mine at their disposal, and they
proved themselves quite capable of working it. Nor did they confine
the exercise of their craft to Glasgow alone, but they practised on
the stream of tourists that flowed from Edinburgh through the
Trossachs and Loch Lomond. They seemed to devote themselves to that
well-worn route, and, though the travellers suffered considerably,
the thieves showed that they had no particular partiality, and
natives and visitors alike were considered fair game; while church
or theatre, 'bus or steamboat, road or rail&mdash;it mattered not
which&mdash;was considered a good field by the enterprising gentry
to pursue their art in. I use the word 'gentry' in a general sense,
because we had good reason to believe that the plunderers were not
all of the male sex, for ladies suddenly found themselves bereft of
purses, trinkets, handkerchiefs, and such like things in places
where men or boys could hardly have penetrated without attracting
very marked attention, and it was perfectly obvious that the
rogues, whether male or female, were anxious to avoid putting
themselves in any position where they would be conspicuous.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of those best able to judge that these
operations were being conducted by a gang of exceedingly
well-trained young thieves, who had been regularly schooled in this
nefarious business, and when sufficiently well drilled they had
been sent out to work under the supervision of the trainer.
Complaints at last became so numerous that I received instructions
to give every attention to the matter, and endeavour to catch some
of the thieves. A staff of four plain clothes officers were placed
at my disposal, and I do not think it reflects upon us to say that
for some time we were unsuccessful in our efforts to secure a haul,
although the robberies went merrily on. People growled and
grumbled; the newspapers hurled the usual <i>brutum fulmen</i> at
the heads of the police, and the thieves, no doubt, were highly
delighted. At length, one afternoon I was coming down Loch Lomond
in one of the passenger steamers that was crowded with tourists,
when a cry was raised that a lady had been robbed of her purse,
which contained a considerable sum of money, besides some odds and
ends, including the half of a first-class return tourist ticket to
Manchester. This lady was one of a party of twelve, and with her
friends had been travelling in the Highlands. They joined the boat
at Tarbet, and the lady, whose name was Bradshaw, was certain she
had her purse there, because she opened it to take out sixpence to
give to a boy who had carried a bag and a bundle of wraps for her.
Soon after the boat had left the Tarbet pier Mrs. Bradshaw got into
conversation with a well-dressed woman of about sixty years of age,
who had a youth with her of about fourteen or fifteen, whom she
represented as her nephew. The lady became interested in the boy,
and talked to him for some time. At last the boy and his aunt went
to another part of the steamer, and about ten minutes later Mrs.
Bradshaw put her hand into her pocket to get her purse, as she
wanted to pay the steward for a bottle of lemonade he had brought
her.</p>

<p>Such was the story Mrs. Bradshaw told me, and when she had
finished I asked her if she would try and point out to me the woman
and boy who had spoken to her. After moving about the crowded deck
for some time, she suddenly nudged me, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'There they are.'</p>

<p>On one of the seats which she indicated I noticed a woman of
lady-like appearance, and considerably past middle age. She had
grey hair and a somewhat worn and haggard face. She wore
spectacles, and was very respectably dressed. The youth beside her
was probably fourteen, with sharp features, small restless eyes,
and an expression of what I should term cunning intelligence. His
general appearance and dress suggested the schoolboy home for his
holidays.</p>

<p>'Have you reason to think, Mrs. Bradshaw,' I asked, as we moved
on so as not to attract attention, 'that either the boy or the
woman robbed you?'</p>

<p>'Well, I am really puzzled how to answer you. I should be very
sorry indeed to cast suspicion on innocent people, and all I can
say is that the boy pressed very closely to me.'</p>

<p>The reader will readily see how difficult it was for me to act
on such meagre evidence as this. I was placed in a very delicate
position, but having regard to all the facts in connection with the
recent robberies it was clearly my duty not to miss the slightest
chance of bringing the guilty parties to justice. But in the
present instance there was nothing but the most meagre and flimsy
reason for suspecting the boy and the woman. As every one knows, it
is a very common thing for passengers travelling together like this
to get into conversation with each other, so in that there was
nothing suspicious; and, moreover, the boy and woman both had the
external evidences of respectability. They were both well dressed.
The woman had a bundle of rugs and umbrellas at her feet, and
carried a leather satchel with a polished steel chain. It seemed,
indeed, probable that she was what she represented herself to be,
that is, the boy's aunt, and that she was taking him for a holiday
tour.</p>

<p>Every one with the slightest knowledge of the law knows how
dangerous it is to accuse an innocent person of crime, and it is
very right that it should be so. Otherwise, perfectly innocent and
respectable people might soon have their reputations ruined by
reckless and unfounded charges. Certainly, I knew my business and
position too well to accuse the woman and her nephew of
pocket-picking on such slender evidence as the very barest
suspicion. Let it be understood, however, that this was only
professional caution on my part, for the mere appearances of
respectability did not lead me to conclude at once that the
suspected people were innocent. On the contrary, I was perfectly
well aware that some criminals cultivated respectability as their
best aid to carrying out their work; and so I was determined not to
lose sight of this interesting old lady and her nephew. I told Mrs.
Bradshaw that, unless she herself was prepared to give the woman
and boy into custody on suspicion of having robbed her, I could
take no action in the matter. But she was too intelligent not to
see the risk she would run by such a course, as in the event of her
suspicions being ill-founded she would render herself liable to
heavy damages. The alternative, therefore, was to bear with her
loss; and, having obtained from her a full and detailed description
of the lost purse and its contents, I promised to communicate with
her in the event of the property being found. I then resolved to
shadow the woman and boy.</p>

<p>When the steamer arrived at Balloch they disembarked with the
rest of the passengers, but, instead of following the stream to the
railway platform, they went to the little hotel, and when the train
started they were not in it, nor was I. Their staying behind was to
me a suspicious circumstance, and I was not disposed to leave them
there alone, so I engaged a bed at the hotel. That evening, in the
course of a conversation I had with the landlord, I learnt that the
old lady, who was known there by the name of Mrs. Donaldson, and
her nephew as Robert Lindsay, had been staying for a week, and made
the tour of the lake every day. She had stated that she belonged to
Glasgow, was a widow, greatly attached to her nephew, who was an
orphan, and she elected to give him a holiday in this way, as he
was very fond of the water.</p>

<p>To me the story seemed a little preposterous, for, though a
great many people do eccentric things, I came to the conclusion
that Mrs. Donaldson was actuated by other and more sinister motives
than merely to ride backwards and forwards every day on the steamer
to please her nephew, and I began to think that the scent was
getting warm. In reply to a question I put to the landlord which
solicited his opinion as to the lady's respectability, he somewhat
indignantly resented the imputation my question seemed to carry
with it, and he answered that he was sure she was respectable, but,
so far as I could gather, the only grounds for his faith were that
the lady, having only a very small quantity of luggage with her,
had readily consented to his request to pay her bill every morning
before going out.</p>

<p>I did not pursue the subject further, as he showed little
disposition to be communicative. In fact, it occurred to me that he
eyed me suspiciously, as if he were impressed with the idea that I
had some evil designs against his customer. I therefore did not
tell him who I was, nor what my business was, because, after all,
Mrs. Donaldson might be a most worthy person, and I should be doing
her a wrong by placing her under the shadow of suspicion.</p>

<p>The next morning broke lowering and gloomy, with threatening
rain. The Loch looked dark and sullen, and heavy banks of black
clouds enshrouded the hills. It was not at all a day calculated to
tempt one to a pleasure excursion, but when the train arrived with
its freight of excursionists and tourists, the interesting Mrs.
Donaldson and her equally interesting nephew, Master Robert
Lindsay, were ready to go with the crowd on board the steamer,
which was lying alongside the pier with her steam up, ready to
start as soon as all the passengers had embarked. The lady had
entirely changed her costume, and in such a way that any one who
had met her casually on the previous day would not now have
recognised her. The youth also wore a different suit, and was
enveloped in a large ulster. I was instinctively certain now that
the woman and lad were up to no good, but were setting out in
search of prey, and I resolved to keep a very sharp eye on them all
day.</p>

<p>Soon after the steamer started on her upward voyage the rain
came down in torrents, and the mists rolled over the face of the
Loch so as to utterly obscure the view. The majority of the
passengers went into the saloons to avoid the wet, but my lady
Donaldson and her nephew sat stoically by themselves on a form on
the upper deck, enveloped in rugs and sheltered by a large
umbrella.</p>

<p>I confess that I was a little puzzled to understand the meaning
of this, if it had any meaning; for if their sole object in
journeying was to relieve their fellow passengers of purses and
other trifles, they might have had ample and golden opportunity,
one would have thought, by mixing with the people who crowded the
saloons. And as I pondered on the incident, it suddenly occurred to
me that very probably they had spotted' me, as the saying is, and
knew they were being shadowed, and were trying to throw me off the
scent. This opinion strengthened later, for I was convinced by the
movements of the boy that he had been deputed by the woman to watch
me, and the artful manner in which he went about his task disclosed
to my practised eye trained cunning, and an artfulness altogether
unusual in a youth whose mind is not tainted with criminal notions.
I could now no longer doubt that this young gentleman and his
aunt&mdash;if she was his aunt&mdash;were on the prowl for
prey.</p>

<p>When the boat reached Inversnaid a large number of passengers,
who were going through the Trossachs, landed, and Mrs. Donaldson
and the boy with them. I was amongst the crowd, for I was resolved,
whatever the cost, not to let my 'suspects' escape me. The game had
become too interesting for that. Coaches were in waiting for the
passengers going forward, but Mrs. Donaldson and the lad made their
way to the hotel. A few other people, deterred by the soaking rain,
which had evidently set in for a spell, abandoned the idea of doing
the rest of the journey, and adjourned also to the hotel for
luncheon. I was glad of this, as it tended to make my presence less
conspicuous. The woman and youth soon gave unmistakable
indications&mdash;small in themselves, but they did not escape
me&mdash;that they were conscious that they were being watched. As
I did not wish to startle them too much, I went into luncheon, for
my appetite was keen. They did not put in an appearance, which gave
me no concern, as the coaches had gone, and so, as it seemed to me,
they could not get far away from me. I therefore enjoyed my
luncheon, and, lighting a cigar, strolled out to the doorway. I
whiled away a quarter of an hour or so, but saw nothing of Mrs.
Donaldson and her nephew, so I ventured to ask, in an unconcerned
sort of way, of an ostler, who was lounging about, if he had seen
them, and his reply rather flabbergasted' me.</p>

<p>'Oh ay,' he answered with native gruffness, 'they're awa'.'</p>

<p>'Away! What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Weel, they got a machine'* frae the guv'nor tae tak' them on
tae Stronachlacher.'</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Anglice</i>&mdash;conveyance of any
kind.]</p>

<p>'I honestly confess that my features dropped as I heard this
piece of information, for my suspects had for the moment outwitted
me. Stronachlacher, as most people know, is at the head of Loch
Katrine. Thence a steamer runs to the foot of the Loch, where it is
met by coaches that convey the passengers to Callender, and so on
to Edinburgh. It seemed obvious to me that Mrs. Donaldson and her
nephew had hurried on to catch the steamer that would be waiting
for the coach people, and that their intention was to reach
Edinburgh, thus giving me the slip. Turning to the stableman, I
asked: 'Have you another machine?'</p>

<p>'No,' was the gruff answer.</p>

<p>'But have you nothing you can let me have?' I asked with some
anxiety.</p>

<p>'No, they're a' oot.'</p>

<p>Here was a dilemma; but still I was determined not to be
baffled, and I sought out the landlord, told him who I was, and
insisted that it was imperatively necessary that I should go
forward without delay. The distance to cover was only about five
miles, but, though an excellent walker, I could not hope to reach
Stronachlacher in time to catch the boat.</p>

<p>'Well,' said the landlord after some reflection, 'I've got an
old screw of a horse in the stable, and if you like I'll clap a
saddle on him, and may be you will be able to save the boat.'</p>

<p>'Anything,' I answered, 'so that it will go.'</p>

<p>'The screw' was, consequently, brought out, and screw it was in
all conscience, as sorry a nag as I ever put my legs across, and
with, as it seemed to me, a disposition to lie down on the road.
But by dint of much coaxing, a good deal of heeling, and a liberal
use of a riding-whip the thoughtful landlord had provided me with,
I got the beast to put forth such pace as was in him, and we
reached the place just as the steamer was in the very act of
casting off her warps. I turned the nag over to the care of a
stableman at the Stronachlacher Hotel, as I had arranged to do,
and, making a rush, I saved the boat by the skin of my teeth.</p>

<p>I could not be unmindful of the fact that my hurried arrival was
somewhat undignified, and not in accord with my usual way of doing
business. But it was all owing to a slight miscalculation on my
part, and I resolved that such a thing should not occur again, and
I believe that never after was I caught napping in the same way. As
it was, I was not even sure if those I was so anxious to keep up
with were on board or not. But I felt that it was a hundred to one
that they were, and I decided to keep in seclusion, but with my
eyes open.</p>

<p>The steamer being smaller than the Loch Lomond boat, the crush
was greater, and, ensconcing myself at the stern, I reduced myself
to a state of placidity by means of a cigar, and gave myself up to
the enjoyment of the pure air, for the mists hid the scenery.</p>

<p>On reaching the landing-place I took up a position that enabled
me to see all the passengers that went ashore, and it was with a
keen sense of satisfaction that I noticed Mrs. Donaldson and the
youth amongst them. They almost brought up the rear, and I could
not help the mental ejaculation&mdash;</p>

<p>'You will have to be precious smart if you give me the go-by
again.'</p>

<p>They secured seats on one of the coaches, and I joined a party
who were going forward in a brake. On reaching the railway station,
I saw that those I was shadowing got into a Glasgow carriage, and I
secured a ticket for the same place, wondering what would be the
upshot of my little adventure. That the woman and the lad were
thieves I had not the slightest doubt in my own mind now, but
suspicion was not proof; and at this period I should not have been
justified in laying my hands on them, for had I done so it might
have been an exceedingly difficult matter to have got evidence to
warrant the course, and my reputation would have suffered.</p>

<p>When we reached Glasgow it was a pouring wet night. I was pretty
sure the suspects had not observed me since leaving Inversnaid, so
I took care that they should not do so, and no doubt they were
chuckling at the thought of having given me the slip.</p>

<p>On emerging from the station they hailed a cab, and drove off
southwards. I followed them in another vehicle. They proceeded
across the Clyde to a somewhat unsavoury quarter of the city, where
alighting they paid the cabman and dismissed him, and entered a
house, the number of which I was careful to note.</p>

<p>So far, then, my day's work had ended. Nothing more could be
done that night, for the hour was late, but I was satisfied with
what I had already accomplished, and I retraced my steps with a
feeling that I was in a fair way of making a revelation and
unmasking an impostor, for, after what I had seen of Mrs.
Donaldson's movements that and the preceding day, I would have
staked my existence against her honesty.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood to which I had tracked Mrs. Donaldson was
characterised rather by the squalor and poverty of its inhabitants
than by crime. It is true we had occasionally hunted out some petty
delinquent from that region, but the habitual criminal did not make
it his abiding-place.</p>

<p>Mrs. Donaldson's house was up seven flights of stairs, being the
top flat of a large tenement. From inquiries carefully pushed I
found that she had been living there about seven months, and very
little was known about her in the neighbourhood. But immediately
opposite was a baker's and huckster's shop, kept by a Mrs. Smith,
and this lady's opinion of Mrs. Donaldson was that she was 'a kin'
o' mystery, and evidently gey fond o' laddies, for there were a
wheen o' them aye gaun tae the hoose.'</p>

<p>This piece of information went far towards confirming my
suspicions that the woman Donaldson was a thief-trainer. This
opinion, of course, I kept to myself, for she was considered in the
neighbourhood to be respectable, and to arouse suspicions against
her might tend to thwart the ends of justice. The owner of the
house said that she paid her rent regularly, and had given a
first-rate reference when she took the place. He considered her to
be a very good tenant; but his standard of judging was evidently
the regularity with which she paid her rent. My course was to get
evidence against her that would justify me in arresting her, and
the question was how was that to be done. As far as I could see,
then, the only thing to do was to watch and wait, and keep her
closely under surveillance for a time. I found, however, that two
days after her little jaunt through the Trossachs she had taken
herself off again, and I failed to get any clue as to where she had
gone to, which was unfortunate, as I felt sure she had sallied
forth in search of victims once more, or otherwise she was trying
to put me off the scent.</p>

<p>If the woman was really what I suspected her to be, and in my
own mind I had not the slightest doubt about it, her offence was a
peculiarly heinous one, for it was difficult to imagine anything
more dreadful than a woman devoting herself to making criminals out
of children. The very thought of it caused one to shudder; and
though years before I was disposed to regard such a thing as rather
an invention of the fictionist, I knew now that the innate
wickedness of human nature would stop at nothing, not even at
corrupting the delicate mind of a child. My anxiety, therefore, to
know more about Mrs. Donaldson, and to stop her career if guilty,
may be imagined. It was a remarkable circumstance that during these
many days that I was trying once more to get on Mrs. Donaldson's
track there was an utter cessation of complaints about
pocket-picking in our neighbourhood. Now what was the reason of
this cessation? To my mind there was only one way of accounting for
it, which was that Mrs. Donaldson had by some means found out who I
was on the day I shadowed her through the Trossachs, and had deemed
it prudent to remain quiet for a time. It seemed to me the most
feasible explanation on thinking the matter over. About a fortnight
later I called on Mrs. Smith, the keeper of the baker's shop, to
ask if her neighbour had come back, and learnt that she had not,
but that a few days before a strange woman had called to ask Mrs.
Smith if she could tell her where Donaldson was. The two women got
into conversation, and the caller represented herself as
Donaldson's sister, and said, incidentally, that she expected that
her sister was at her house in Edinburgh. At this piece of
information Mrs. Smith was naturally surprised, and said that she
was not aware that Donaldson had a house in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' exclaimed the sister, 'she's lived there for
years.'</p>

<p>This statement served to still further increase Smith's
surprise, and, prompted more by curiosity than anything else, she
asked a number of questions, which elicited the information that
Mrs. Donaldson lived in a house in a wynd out of the High Street.
The name of the wynd was given, but, unfortunately, it had escaped
the memory of Mrs. Smith, and she could come no nearer to the
precise spot than 'a wynd off the High Street.'</p>

<p>When I learnt this news I felt that the little drama was
becoming somewhat mysterious, and promised to be more than usually
interesting. I resolved, therefore, to take more vigorous steps to
trace Mrs. Donaldson, and discover what her little game was. It was
pretty clear to me that she was a woman of great cupidity and
peculiar cunning, and hardly likely to be caught napping. But, on
the other hand, I was hardly likely to be beaten by such a woman. I
therefore took an early opportunity of going over to Edinburgh, and
though 'a wynd off the High Street' was indefinite enough in all
conscience, I was not discouraged. There are a dozen or more wynds
off the High Street of Edinburgh, as every one knows who has ever
been through that historic thoroughfare, and in those wynds are
hundreds of houses, sheltering possibly as many more hundreds of
human beings, so that with the meagre clue I had it seemed at first
sight very much like looking for a hair in a truss of straw; and
had I been less acquainted with the ways of the criminal classes,
and the <i>modus operandi</i> to be employed in order to get on
their track, I might have hesitated to attempt to find the lady I
was now so desirous of meeting. There was one thing that gave me an
advantage, which was I could recognise Mrs. Donaldson amongst ten
thousand people, unless she altered her appearance wonderfully.
Every lineament of her face was photographed on my memory, and I
was able to describe her accurately.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned, there are a great many wynds in the High
Street of Edinburgh, and a few at least have a far from enviable
reputation. One in particular at the time I refer to was studiously
shunned by any one having a reputation to lose. Its inhabitants
most certainly belonged to that class which prey upon their
fellows, and years before it had gained an evil name by reason of a
barbarous murder, a woman having been brutally kicked to death at
the foot of one of the noisome stairs that gave access to the
rookeries. The houses in this wynd were occupied by what is termed
in police circles a floating population&mdash;that is to say, the
majority of the people belonged to the vagrant classes. They were
there to-day and gone to-morrow. There were, of course, some old
residenters, but they were the tenants who for the most part let
lodgings for the night, the price ranging from a penny to
four-pence for the night's accommodation. Although I did not quite
expect to find Mrs. Donaldson in this wynd, I had an idea that I
might pick up some information about her, if she was what I took
her to be. The reason I did not think she would be found there was
that, from what little I had gleaned about her, I thought she was
not likely to conspicuously congregate with marked evildoers. She
carried on her business with evident caution, that was clear, or
she could not have succeeded in deceiving her Glasgow neighbours so
long. My first plan was to disguise myself as a tramp, and seek a
night's shelter in one of the dens that abounded in the wynd. It
was an objectionable thing to have to do. Not that it was a novel
experience, for I had often gone through it on previous occasions.
Indeed, a detective cannot hope to succeed in his profession unless
he is intimately acquainted with the ways and habits of criminals,
and how is he to gain that knowledge except by mingling with them
as one of their kind? In no other way can he understand their minds
and know their habits. In the course of my career I have had to
place myself in positions against which all my senses have
revolted; but the knowledge I have derived therefrom has been
invaluable to me, and has enabled me to succeed where others in the
same line have failed.</p>

<p>The most notorious of the lodging-houses in the wynd was kept by
an Irishwoman named Mary Dewey. She was a widow with a great many
black marks against her. She had been imprisoned two or three
times, and fined dozens of times for drunkenness and other finable
offences.</p>

<p>To her den I betook myself one night, and engaged a twopenny
'doss'&mdash;that is, for twopence I was to be privileged to make
one of two or three dozen others who stretched themselves on dirty
rags on the floor. To accurately describe the dreadful place and
its occupants, in which and amongst whom I was to pass the night,
would require a far more graphic pen than I possess, while it would
require the pencil of a Doré, a Fuesli, or a Wiertz to delineate,
in all their hideous details, the human ghouls who crowded and
jostled each other in the foetid den.</p>

<p>It was a long, narrow room, with three small windows in it, and
a fireplace at one end. But the chimney of this fireplace was
stuffed up with rags. Lying in rows on each side of the room, the
floor of which was black with dirt, were twenty-nine men and boys,
the youngest, perhaps, eleven or twelve, the oldest turned seventy.
And there wasn't a face there, not even the youngest, that was not
horrible in its look of depravity and wickedness. When the young
are early schooled in the ways of crime, the innocent look of
childhood speedily fades from the face, and gives place to a
peculiar expression, which is well known to those who have dealings
with criminals.</p>

<p>As an utter stranger amongst this crowd of outcast wretches, I
was regarded with great curiosity and some suspicion by such of
them as were awake, and many were the questions that were put to
me. Where had I come from? Where was I going to? What lay was I on?
I knew how to parry and answer these questions, and an old,
grey-headed sinner, who bore a strong resemblance to an ape, for
his face was weazened and shrivelled and covered with a stubbly
growth of rusty grey hair, while his mouth projected forward just
like a monkey's, asked me at last to go and doss' alongside of him.
As he was evidently an old hand, and likely to be well posted up in
all matters appertaining to his particular walk in life, I accepted
his invitation, and we were soon engaged in a whispered
conversation, and after a time, when he had grown confidential, I
ventured to ask him if he knew 'Mistress Donaldson, who faked
kiddies up to nick pigskins.'*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Faked kiddies up to nick pigskins. Taught
children to pick pockets.]</p>

<p>The old man reflected a few moments, and then said no, he did
not, but he 'kent a square pal,' who was 'fly,' and if I was good
for a wet (drink) he would take me to the pal in the morning, and I
might learn something. I told him I was good for two or three wets,
and soon after that the old fellow fell asleep, and I managed to
put the time over until, to my great relief, the rising hour came.
Then the old man and I started off to his 'pal,' a desperate old
villain, who kept a shebeen in an alley off the Canon-gate. This
fellow was known as 'The Jumper,' by reason, as I subsequently
learned, of his having jumped while suffering from deliriun tremens
from a window five storeys high, and escaped with only a bruise or
two. His real name, though he had quite a string of <i>aliases,</i>
was James Sinclair. He had been convicted times out of number for
all sorts of offences, and a few weeks after my introduction to
him&mdash;from information I was enabled to give&mdash;he was
pounced upon by the police for shebeening, and sentenced to a
considerable term of imprisonment.</p>

<p>On the occasion I am dealing with he was disposed to be very
morose and taciturn with me, but after I had paid for a bottle of
his villainous compound yclept whisky he became more communicative,
though he said he did not know Mrs. Donaldson. But on his asking
what 'kin' o' like body' she was, I was enabled to describe her so
accurately that he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'It's no Donaldson you mean. It's Mother Meldrum, and she stays
at No. 6 in &mdash;&mdash; Wynd, off the High Street.' When he
added, 'She has a place tae in Glesca,' I could no longer doubt
that it was the same woman.</p>

<p>As soon as I could get away from my undesirable companions I
went to the head Police Office to see if they knew anything of Mrs.
Meldrum, but they had never heard of the woman, and they said the
wynd mentioned was quite a respectable quarter as compared with
others in the neighbourhood. This was further evidence of the
creature's artfulness, and of the secrecy with which she conducted
her dreadful business, and I, as well as my colleagues, was of
opinion that there might be considerable difficulty in getting the
necessary legal evidence against her. I suggested that she would
have to be trapped in some way, but then came the question, how was
it to be done? At length an old policeman volunteered a suggestion.
He knew a man who had been a convict, but, after having served his
term, he became an informer, that is, he gave information often of
great value to the police, and, of course, he got paid for such
information. I need scarcely remark, perhaps, that the police
force, like the Government, the army, and the navy, is obliged to
have its paid spies. This informer, whose name I must withhold for
obvious reasons, although he has been dead for many years, but
still members of his family are living, had a son, a lad about
fourteen, and no doubt he might be obtained as a bait to draw the
wretched old woman.</p>

<p>Acting on this suggestion, I visited the informer, and said my
business before him. He entered into the spirit of the thing, in
view of the fact that he was to be well paid for his services, and
he brought his son in for me to make his acquaintance. The had was
a little fellow with a preternaturally sharp expression, and a
certain quick-wittedness which caused him to seem older than his
years. He was by no means a prepossessing lad, and it was difficult
to say then whether he was predisposed to good or evil.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It is satisfactory to be able to state that
I subsequently brought this lad under the notice of a well-known
charitable and philanthropic lady. Through her exertions he was
sent to school for three years, at the end of which time the lady
placed him on a farm in Canada. The last I heard of him was that he
was in business for himself and doing well.]</p>

<p>The lad expressed his willingness to lend himself to the scheme,
and having coached him well up in the part he was to play, he was
attired in some well-worn and ragged clothes. And that evening he
accompanied me to Mrs. Donaldson's, or Meldrum's, house. I
mentioned the Jumper's name by way of an introduction, and after
some little parleying I gained admittance to her house by telling
her I wished my boy to be well drilled. Of course, I had so far
disguised my ordinary appearance as to be under no apprehension
that she would recognise me as the person who had shadowed her on
Loch Lomond. She was a woman of quite a good address, and of such
plausibility that almost any one might have been deceived in her.
She talked to the boy for some time, and so well did he play his
part that she never once suspected him, and at last, turning to me,
she asked me what I would stand if she took him in hand. I asked
her to name a figure, and she at once said five pounds, but I told
her that was far beyond me, and suggested two, which she ultimately
decided to accept, and at my request she consented to give him his
first lesson then. So, leading the way into a back room, she
unlocked the door of a cupboard, and took therefrom a life-size
figure of a female, the dress of which was covered with tiny bells.
By means of a cord and hook from the head she suspended the figure
to a hook in the ceiling, and, putting a purse in the pocket of the
dress, told the boy he must try and take it out without so much as
sounding one of the bells on the dress, which, if shaken ever so
slightly, set the bells tinkling. Of course the lad was not
successful, for even an infinitesimal swaying of the suspended
figure caused the bells to jangle. At last the wretched old woman
got cross, and the boy began to cry. I thereupon suggested it might
be as well not to proceed further that night, and said I would call
again the next evening at six o'clock. I was exceedingly punctual
in keeping the appointment, but I called that time in a very
different character to what she expected to see me in, for as she
opened the door I stepped forward and said:</p>

<p>'My name is Donovan, I am a detective, and I arrest you on a
charge of training children for purposes of thieving.'</p>

<p>I don't know that I ever saw a person so utterly collapse as she
did. Her face became of a greenish pallor, and she appeared as if
she was going to fall. But suddenly, pulling herself together, she
began to make protestations of her innocence (she did not recognise
me at this time as the vagrant of the previous night), avowing,
with all sorts of solemn assertions, that she was a
highly-respectable woman. Then I told her that I had had ocular
demonstrations the preceding night of her wickedness, whereupon her
whole manner changed, and she became a perfect virago, pouring
forth such a torrent of abuse, couched in language so vile that I
could scarcely repress a shudder, used as I was to that sort of
thing.</p>

<p>With the assistance of two colleagues who were with me I
effected her arrest, but not without difficulty, for she resisted
desperately, displaying extraordinary strength and agility for a
woman of her age. We conveyed her to the station in a cab, and I
felt delighted that I had been able to cut this infamous creature's
career short. She seemed now to have become a totally different
person to the one I had seen on the steamer on Loch Lomond. From
the quiet, apparently staid, lady-like woman, she had changed to a
fury, desperation and despair alternating. That she was a
remarkably dangerous character could no longer be doubted, and it
was matter for congratulation that she had been brought to
book.</p>

<p>A search of her houses in Glasgow and in Edinburgh brought to
light the extensive ramifications of her business. But a still more
startling revelation was in store for us. From an old letter found
in a drawer, addressed to a Mrs. Mary Pullen, we were enabled to
prove that that was her real name, that she had suffered five
years' imprisonment for swindling, and that she was the wife of a
most notorious ruffian, who had been a thief from his earliest
youth, and who at the age of thirty-two had been convicted at
Manchester of killing a man in a fight, and sentenced to penal
servitude for life. His wife, Mrs. Pullen, <i>alias</i> Mrs.
Donaldson, <i>alias</i> Meldrum, and various other <i>aliases,</i>
had joined issues with a man in Manchester who had also been a
convict, and these two worthies worked together, the man sending
youths from Manchester to be trained by the woman. These things and
many more came out at her trial, the result being that she was duly
convicted and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. I tried
hard to trace the youth who was with her the day I first made her
acquaintance on Loch Lomond, and who, no doubt, relieved Mrs.
Bradshaw of her purse. My efforts, however, were fruitless, for no
doubt those interested in him kept him out of the way when they
heard that the woman had been taken. How many thieves this infamous
creature had made it is difficult even to guess at, but there was
general satisfaction expressed that she would not get the chance of
making any more. If the means I had taken to entrap her were
objectionable, there was surely never a case where the means were
more fully justified by the end than this one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pullen did not live to complete her sentence, for she died
five years later after a year and a half spent in the hospital
owing to cancer in the face. Those who had charge of her said that
she died penitent, and expressing horror for her wasted and wicked
life.</p>

VIII. &mdash; A PRECIOUS PAIR OF SCOUNDRELS</h2>

<p>FOR many years there stood at the corner of an important but not
altogether reputable thoroughfare in the south of London a large
block of buildings that had at one time been let as tenement
houses. The tenants, however, had long since departed, whither
heaven only knew, and the buildings stood a dark and melancholy
wreck. The property was in 'Chancery,' hence its mournful
appearance. Every pane of glass had been shivered to atoms by the
mischievous street arabs. The door was like the window-sashes,
paint-less and rotting. The water channels on the roof had become
blocked, and the water poured down over the front brick wall,
leaving tracks of blackish green slime. The area was the receptacle
for a heterogeneous collection of rubbish and filth. Dead cats and
dogs lay and festered there. There were heaps of rotting rags, old
boots and shoes, broken bottles, and the hundred and one things
that soon collect in a spot that it is no one's business to look
after. It was pitiable to see such a sight in London's wealthy
town. The land upon which the buildings stood was exceedingly
valuable, although it was close to the notorious 'New Cut,' the
home and haunt of some of the vilest specimens of humanity, male
and female, to be found in the whole of the Great Babylon. But a
new era was dawning, when the besom of the Metropolitan
improvements was bound to reach this unsalubrious spot, and sweep
some of its vileness away. So, notwithstanding the existence of
this sink of iniquity, land in the neighbourhood was of almost
fabulous value.</p>

<p>The buildings I am describing had had a curious history. They
dated back for over three hundred years, and had formerly been the
town houses (there were two houses) of people of fashion. And in
one of them there had once lived a nobleman who became a naval
commander, and distinguished himself in more than one of our great
sea fights, earning for himself a marble monument in England's
magnificent Valhalla &mdash;Westminster Abbey. At last the property
got into the hands of a miserly and eccentric man, named Baintree,
who was a builder by trade. But soon after he came into possession,
and during a terrible cholera year in London, a plague fell upon
the inhabitants of these houses, and something like two dozen
persons perished. The owner himself took the disease, and
succumbed; and it was then found that he had by will devised the
property to his only daughter&mdash;a woman thirty years of
age&mdash;and his sons, of whom there were four, were left
penniless. The first thing they did was to lock their sister up in
a lunatic asylum, and then they tried to upset the will, but failed
after three or four years of litigation. The will was confirmed by
the Court, and the woman was declared to be sane.</p>

<p>On her release, however, she soon showed that, if not legally
mad, she was eccentric to the very verge of insanity, and, having
cursed her brothers, and wished them all manner of evil, she took
up her residence in one of the houses, and declined to let the
other. For some years she led a lonely, solitary life, and allowed
her property to go to rack and ruin. As the window-panes got broken
she replaced them with brown paper or rags. As the chimney-pots
fell down she allowed them to remain, and she refused to spend a
single penny on paint or the most necessary repairs. She remained a
spinster, and her one hobby seemed to be to gather around her
dozens of cats, which, however, she starved; and she was constantly
figuring in the Courts, both for cruelty and for keeping her place
in an insanitary condition.</p>

<p>For thirty years this strange, human excrescence led a lonely,
useless life, and it was said that during that long period no one
but herself ever entered the portals of the houses. But one dark
and stormy night a visitor did enter&mdash;a visitor that comes to
us all, sooner or later. It was the Angel of Death. And days after,
the old woman not having been seen, the door was broken open, and
the explorers who had the hardihood to enter beheld a terrible
sight. On some filthy straw and old sacks in a corner of a bare
room the woman lay dead, and the gaunt and starving cats had been
feeding off her body. No will could be discovered, and it became
necessary to find an heir. It was known that three of her brothers
were dead. One had died in the workhouse, but what had become of
the fourth? He, being the youngest, had gone years ago to
Australia, and no one knew whether he was living or dead. And until
he turned up, if living, or his death was proved, there was nothing
for it but to put the property into Chancery. Every one knows what
that means. Although the Court of Chancery has untold millions
locked up, it will spend never a penny if it can help it, and so
the old woman's property, while waiting for an heir, went from bad
to worse, and mouldered to decay like the dead woman herself. Of
course it got an evil reputation, and people said it was haunted,
and one night murder put its curse upon it. A man and a woman got
in somehow, and the man murdered the woman. He fled, and was never
captured, and she, being an unknown waif, was buried in a nameless
pauper's grave.</p>

<p>So years passed, and the quest of the heir was still kept up,
for no proof was forthcoming of his death. At last a man and his
son offered to rent one of the houses, and by the advice of the
lawyers, who had got their claws upon the property, the Court
decided to accept the offer, and one of the solicitors was
appointed trustee to receive the rent. So in due time the windows
in the lower part of the house were repaired. A new door was put
up, together with a brass plate on the portal, that bore the
legend: 'John Arthur Heath-cote &amp; Son, commission agents.'</p>

<p>Now, there was one peculiarity in connection with the Messrs.
Heathcote, no one seemed to know where they came from, or what the
exact nature of their business was, for, after all, 'commission
agent' is a very elastic term, and may mean much or little. It is
presumable, however, that they had, to some extent, satisfied the
lawyers of their respectability, or, at any rate, of their ability
to pay their rent, as, after all, that was the main consideration
with the legal gentlemen. For they were anxious to see some money
coming in, so that they might get their little bills of costs
already incurred, and as they had prosecuted their search for the
heir by order of the Court, they were, of course, entitled to
payment as soon as there were any funds. So possibly, probably in
fact&mdash;very probably&mdash;they were not too inquisitive about
the strange tenants. Some months after Messrs. Heathcote had
entered on their tenancy of what had become known as 'Murder
Buildings,' a big robbery took place at a West-End mansion, and it
devolved upon me, as part of my duty, to inquire into the matter.
The property stolen consisted of a considerable quantity of real
silver plate, and some very valuable jewellery, including a diamond
brooch, a diamond tiara, and a diamond hair-pin.</p>

<p>In the course of time I was successful in getting a clue to the
thieves, and found that they were some of the most notorious
denizens of the notorious New Cut. It was my first practical
acquaintance with this unsalubrious spot,* and I found that it
exceeded even the worst description I had heard of it. The worst of
London's villainy and wickedness seemed to have concentrated there.
I was successful in tracking my men down, and arresting them,
though not without considerable trouble and some personal risk. But
though the thieves&mdash;four altogether&mdash;were captured, the
stolen property was not forthcoming, though every possible means
were used to trace it. It was, therefore, very obvious that the
wretches had disposed of it, and the only channel through which
they could have realised on it was a 'fence,' or receiver of stolen
property. Now, it was clear that whoever had bought it must have
been in a large way of business, because no little trader could
have dealt in such things. I don't mean altogether as regards the
price paid to the thieves, for, as is well known, the 'fences' only
give about one-eighth of the value for stolen things. But the
purchasers must have been well acquainted with the market, and able
to speedily dispose of the plate and jewellery. The things stolen
were valued at nearly ten thousand pounds, some of the diamonds
being perfect in their way. Now, diamonds are things that thieves
cannot readily sell, except to the 'fences,' who must, as I have
said, have a good connection.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Since then the New Cut has been vastly
improved, and many of the rookeries have been swept away. Now any
one may traverse the New Cut with perfect safety. Before, it was
not prudent for any respectably-dressed person to enter into
it.&mdash;THE AUTHOR.]</p>

<p>In the case I am dealing with there could be no question that
the articles had been quickly disposed of, and though a mitigation
of sentence was promised to any one of the gang who would disclose
the name of the 'fence,' not one would do so; for thieves know well
if they betray the purchaser of stolen goods their chance of
selling anything else in the future has gone for ever. As a matter
of fact, the professional g fences' are very rarely betrayed, and
it is always exceedingly difficult to get at them. In this case the
thieves could not be tempted, though, as a last resource, it was
hinted that it was in the bounds of possibility a free pardon might
be granted to an informer. But even this did not draw them, and so
the rascals were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment, and it
seemed as if the stolen property was irrecoverably lost.</p>

<p>To all connected with the case this was a source of very great
annoyance, and the owner of the property was much distressed, for
many of the things were souvenirs, and some had been given by
friends who were dead and gone. As regards the gold and the silver,
it was pretty certain that it had found its way immediately into
the melting-pot, that being the destiny of stolen precious metal,
for by this means identity is destroyed, and there is,
comparatively speaking, little difficulty in disposing of the
melted metal. With diamonds and other precious stones the case is
different. The slightest damage to them deteriorates their value.
And as stones of any note are pretty well known to dealers, who can
readily recognise them, great caution is necessary in dealing with
them in an unlawful way. Consequently they are generally sent
abroad as soon as possible, and it will strike the reader at once
that the 'fence' who trades in this class of property must be a man
of considerable means, and have a foreign connection. Generally,
precious stones that are stolen are ultimately disposed of by the
traders in stolen property in some of the Eastern countries.</p>

<p>The usual sources of information available to the police having
failed to give us any clue to the lost property, it seemed as if we
should have to be content with having caged the thieves for a
considerable period, and my chief said to me one morning in a
somewhat bantering spirit&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, Donovan, you've only half done your work. Of course, I
give you credit for the capture of the thieves, but had you
recovered the property you might have distinguished yourself.'</p>

<p>'I thank you for your small meed of praise,' I answered
caustically. 'You must not forget, however, that I cannot perform
impossibilities; no more can you or any other man.'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;true,' said he. 'But is it impossible to trace this
property?'</p>

<p>I was thoughtful for some time before I answered. Then I
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Even the possible at times seems so impossible that one may be
pardoned for feeling hopeless.'</p>

<p>'Ah, true; but a sanguine man should never allow himself to sink
to that condition of hopelessness. Seeing that we have to do with
rogues and thieves who, though cunning, generally do very stupid
acts, it ought not to be impossible to get a clue that would enable
us to ascertain what has become of the things. It is hardly likely,
of course, that we can ever recover them, but the information, at
any rate, will be valuable in our archives.'</p>

<p>These words had a marked effect upon me. They stimulated me to
renewed efforts. I never could bear the thought of failure in
anything I undertook, and as I had played a prominent part in
capturing the thieves who had committed this burglary, it seemed to
me clearly my duty to trace the stolen property. But then came the
question&mdash;' How was it to be done a' I confess that I could
not answer the question. One might grope about in the dark, as it
were, and by the merest chance stumble on a clue, but I was aware
that was only a remote contingency. No&mdash;it was clear to me
that some decided and systematic action was necessary, and I spent
a whole month in thinking out some plan that would promise the
probability of success.</p>

<p>At length, one very wet and dismal night, about half-past
eleven, a shivering, ragged, starved-looking wretch was making his
way along the New Cut, casting furtive glances about him as if he
were hunted, and drawing his rags about his body in a vain
endeavour to protect himself from the cold and the rain. Turning
down one of the side narrow streets that run off the Cut,' he
stopped before a squalid, dirty-looking house, over the door of
which, painted on a transparency, illumined by a feeble candle, was
the one word, 'Lodgings.' This house&mdash;long since swept
away&mdash;was a den of infamy, but it nightly afforded shelter to
a hundred or more debased and depraved wretches of both sexes, whom
it would have been a charity to themselves and their more
respectable fellows to have put out of the world by some merciful
euthanasy. However, this could not be in a so-called civilised
country. Of course, if they committed murder, which they sometimes
did, they were hanged when convicted, and for robbery and outrage,
by which they subsisted, they were shut up in gaol when robbery and
outrage could be proved against them. The stringent lodging-house
regulations that now obtain were not known then, and such plague
holes as I am describing enjoyed comparative immunity from
parochial sanitary officers.</p>

<p>The ragged man stopped before this house, seemed to reflect for
some moments, then knocked with the rusty, broken knocker that hung
on the cracked and paintless door. After he had knocked two or
three times again, and waited some minutes, the door was opened
cautiously a few inches, and a face appeared in the opening. A
wolfish, greedy face, with a sodden, greasy appearance, and red,
running eyes, from which all the eyelashes had fallen. It was the
face of a gaunt, dirty, unkempt man, who was revolting and
repellent as a human thing.</p>

<p>'What do you want?' he growled in a rusty, cracked voice.</p>

<p>'I want a lodging, master,' answered the stranger abjectly.</p>

<p>'Have you any rhino?'</p>

<p>'Yes, threepence.'</p>

<p>Thereupon the sore-eyed, wolfish man opened the door and
admitted the stranger, who was taken down a flight of wooden stairs
to the basement, which was two large cellars thrown into one. There
was a large open chimney without a grate, but an iron basket filled
with glowing coke supplied its place. The floor of the cellar was
the natural earth, full of ruts and holes. The walls had at some
time or other been whitewashed, but now they were stained,
blackened, and slimy with damp and mildew. The ceiling was black,
and festooned with cobwebs, and a 'slush lamp,' such as is used by
sailors in a ship's forecastle, was suspended by a chain. In the
centre of the floor was a very common wooden table, and forms were
ranged round the walls.</p>

<p>In this foetid, unwholesome den about two dozen men and boys
were gathered, some of them crowding round the burning coke for the
sake of the warmth. Three or four were seated at the table playing
cards with a pack of cards so greasy, black, and worn that it was
almost impossible to tell one card from the other; and the rest
were stretched out on the forms asleep, most of them face
downwards. They were a villainous, cut-throat looking crew, many of
them old gaol-birds, and all, without exception, even the youngest,
dangerous criminals. They were human pariahs, homeless and
friendless, who preyed upon society.</p>

<p>As the stranger entered all those who were awake turned and eyed
him suspiciously, and one big, lowbrowed vagabond
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'What cheer, Cully?'</p>

<p>'So, so,' the man answered.</p>

<p>'Where do you hail from?'</p>

<p>'I have the key of the street, mate.'</p>

<p>'Are you fly?'</p>

<p>'Rhombo, I've been doing the mill.'*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In prison.]</p>

<p>'What for?'</p>

<p>'For nicking a bloke's white turnip.'*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Stealing a silver watch.]</p>

<p>'Are you a furringer in the village?'*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* 'Are you a stranger in London?]</p>

<p>'Yes; I've been padding the hoof.'*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Been on the tramp.]</p>

<p>'Are you stumped?'*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Meaning, Are you without money?]</p>

<p>'I've got as much as will pay for a doss.'</p>

<p>The tramp having been thus cross-examined, as it were, and
proved himself satisfactory, he was not subjected to any more
questioning. The low-browed vagabond who had questioned him seemed
to be a person of importance in that assembly, and he was addressed
as 'Boss.' It was evident, too, that he was an old lag&mdash;that
is, a convict, and had served many a term of imprisonment. The
stranger seemed to pay great attention to him and to look up to
him, and the two having got chatting together they remained up
after the other waifs had sought sleep on the forms or the ground.
Then the stranger became more confidential, and asked the Boss if
he could put him on to a lay.</p>

<p>'You'll have to spot a crib and crack it,' answered the Boss
with a grim smile, meaning that the stranger would have to look out
for some place to rob.</p>

<p>'Ah, if my pal hadn't been lagged I wouldn't be hard up now,'
sighed the stranger dolefully.</p>

<p>'Who is your pal?'</p>

<p>'Big Scottie.'</p>

<p>'What, the covey what was tuk for nicking the sparklers
(diamonds) from the West-End crib?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'I know'd Scottie, too,' said the Boss reflectively. 'But he
warn't much of a pal.'</p>

<p>'Why?' asked the stranger sharply.</p>

<p>'He warn't rhombo.'</p>

<p>'How do you know?'</p>

<p>'Well, I've heard chaps say so.'</p>

<p>The stranger seemed to become very thoughtful for a time, and at
last remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>'I'm hanged if I don't think you're right.'</p>

<p>'Did he have you, mate?' asked the Boss pointedly.</p>

<p>'Well, he didn't exactly have me, 'cos, you see, I wasn't in the
swim with him; but I done him many a good turn, and he promised me
something out of the swag, but devil a stiver did I ever see. Then
I heard as he'd been tuk, but I don't think they got any of the
sparklers, did they?'</p>

<p>'You bet they didn't,' answered the Boss with a leer. 'Big
Scottie was too fly for the beaks.'</p>

<p>'But what did he do with the sparklers?'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know; but, you bet, he traded 'em.' Or buried
'em,' the stranger suggested.</p>

<p>'No fear!' exclaimed the Boss with a laugh of contempt, as
though he thought the stranger very simple.</p>

<p>'Did he trade 'em in the village?'</p>

<p>'You bet he did.'</p>

<p>'I don't believe it,' said the stranger musingly. 'Well, you're
a mug, that's what I've got to say.'</p>

<p>'Maybe I am, old man; but, look here, if you'll put me on a
"fence" that will take some of the same stuff, I know where I can
make a haul.'</p>

<p>The Boss looked at the stranger incredulously, and after a time
he asked with a sneer&mdash;</p>

<p>'Where is the place?'</p>

<p>The stranger placed his finger on his nose, as much as to say
you can't catch old birds with chaff, and he remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>'I'm fly, mate, and know how many beans make five. Now, I've got
the lay of a crib just as sure as you're there, and I tell you I
can get some sparklers if I knew where to part with 'em. You see,
it's no use making a haul of them things if a fellow can't fence
'em.'</p>

<p>'Right you are, old pal,' exclaimed the Boss, growing a little
excited, and extending his dirty paw for the other to grasp, which
he did. Then the Boss laid his left hand on the stranger's shoulder
in an easy, familiar, and confidential manner, and he said in a low
tone, 'Put me in the swim, and I'll stand by you to the death.
Every one as knows me knows as I'm right.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'll chum in along with you.'</p>

<p>'Bully for you,' and the Boss patted the stranger's shoulder.
'Now, where's your crib?'</p>

<p>'It's a big house this side o' York, and I'm nuts on a wench
there. The gemman's some'at to do with railways, and he goes away a
good deal, and his missus has any amount o' sparklers.'</p>

<p>The Boss waxed enthusiastic, and squeezing the stranger's hand
until he almost brought tears from his eyes, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>'I'm on that lay, old friend, and will stick to you like a
leech.'</p>

<p>'But where are we to fence the goods if we get 'em?'</p>

<p>'You leave that to me now. That'll be all right.'</p>

<p>'Well, mate, you ain't going to kid me like that.'</p>

<p>'Do you think I'm kidding?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Well, I tell you what I can do. I can take you to the same
"fence" what traded Big Scottie's sparklers.'</p>

<p>'Is he in the village?'</p>

<p>'Yes, old pal, and not a 'undred miles from this 'ere spot.'</p>

<p>'Whereabouts?'</p>

<p>'You're rhombo now?'</p>

<p>'Yes, rhombo as steel.'</p>

<p>'Do you know Murder Buildings?' the Boss asked mysteriously.</p>

<p>What, you mean the old woman's property what's gone to
ruin?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'I know it, then. It's away up the road here, not far from the
bridge.'</p>

<p>'That's it. Well, there's a covey and his son as calls
themselves Heathcote what's got one of them houses in Murder
Buildings. Though his real name ain't Heathcote. He's old Mo Davis
what used to keep a fencing shop down in Spitalfields. But he's
good to trade to any amount.'</p>

<p>At this information the stranger's face became pale as if with
sudden excitement, and his eyes brightened up as if with joy.</p>

<p>'Now mind you keep this dark,' pursued the Boss, 'for Moses is
very good to us chaps, and will trade anything from us, and there
ain't one of us what wouldn't die before we split on him. He is one
of the right sort, and he laughs at all the traps* in London, There
isn't one that suspects him.'</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Policemen.]</p>

<p>The stranger seemed perfectly delighted, and chuckled as he
remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>'You're a right sort o' pal, and you bet we'll know each other
better afore we've done.'</p>

<p>'Well, you'll find me jannock, old man, and I sticks to my
friends.'</p>

<p>The two shook hands again and, as the hour was late, they said
good night, the Boss having promised 'to stand breakfast in the
morning, when it was arranged that they should discuss the plan of
operations for cracking the crib near York. The Boss then coiled
himself up in a corner of the den, and the stranger utilised the
table for a couch, but, judging from his restlessness, it seemed as
if he was not quite used to such a hard bed. But it was not only
the bed&mdash;it was the place altogether. The thick, reeking
atmosphere, the fumes from the coke, the smoke from the slush lamp,
the effluvia that emanated from the unwashed bodies of the wretches
who were sprawled about, the snores that arose from all
sides&mdash;these things in conjunction disturbed him, and he could
not sleep. And after a time he got up, stretched himself, gazed
steadily for a time over to the corner where the Boss was coiled,
as if to assure himself that that worthy was locked in sleep, and,
being satisfied that such was the case, he crept cautiously out of
the filthy cellar, and made his way lightly up the wooden stairs
that, in spite of his efforts, creaked beneath his tread. However,
he gained the passage without any one giving sign that he had been
disturbed. So the stranger groped his way along the passage, and
managed, after a good deal of fumbling, to get the street door
open, and then he stepped out, drawing a great sigh of relief as he
breathed the cool morning air, which was deliciously pure as
compared with the awful atmosphere of the dreadful den he had just
left. With a sense of thankfulness he hurried away, and, after a
brisk walk of nearly an hour, he gained a villa house standing in a
neat garden near Clapham Common, which seemed a paradise after the
villainous region he had come from.</p>

<p>Reader, I was that stranger, and need I say that I was elated
and delighted at the discovery I had made.</p>

<p>The little scheme I had carried out, and the deception I had
practised on the Boss, were justified by results. Truly the end
justified the means in this case. The fearful place in which I had
spent those trying hours I knew as a rendezvous for thieves and bad
characters, and I felt tolerably certain that I should be able to
learn something that might be useful. For amongst these people
there is a remarkable freemasonry, and I deemed it highly probable
some of them would know of the 'fence' who, in thieves' jargon, had
traded the sparklers' stolen by Big Scottie and his pals. My
success had far exceeded my anticipations, and I congratulated
myself on the get-up and appearance of wretchedness which had
enabled me to deceive those human hawks. Of course I was astonished
to learn that Messrs. Arthur Heathcote &amp; Son, commission
agents, of Murder Buildings, were buyers of stolen property, and I
was still more astonished, perhaps, to find that Heathcote was
Moses Davis. I had never seen Moses Davis in my life, but I had
heard about him, and knew that there was a record against him in
Scotland Yard. I made it my business to look up this, and I found
that he was described as a notorious 'receiver,' and trainer of
young thieves. He had suddenly disappeared from Spitalfields,
however, and a memorandum was attached to the record to the effect
that he had probably gone abroad. He was believed to have
originally come from Holland.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult things in regard to bringing 'fences'
to justice is that of getting legal evidence against them. The
buyers of stolen goods are generally&mdash;not always, but
generally&mdash;Jews, and the craft and cunning, which are marked
characteristics of the lower class of Israelites, are often
developed in the fence' to a degree that may be said to be
perfection. He knows when he begins his nefarious business that he
does so in defiance of the law, and that if he is to be undisturbed
he must outwit the law. That may seem a difficult thing to do when
it is remembered how Argus-eyed the law is. But, difficult as it
is, the fence' does it. Not that he always continues to succeed,
for occasionally he is bowled over and suffers due punishment for
his crimes. But these buyers of stolen goods think that the hauls
made are well worth the risks run. And most certainly the gains are
great, though probably no greater than they would be in successful
legitimate trading. Now, as a rule, the fence' will buy anything
that has any real value. But his weakness is for gold and silver,
jewellery of all kinds, and precious stones. The reason of this
partiality will be obvious. In stones and jewels there may be large
value in little bulk, while gold and silver can so quickly be
changed into a condition, by means of the melting-pot, when it can
no longer be identified, that the 'fence' prefers these things
before all others. Of course it goes without saying that the
'fence' must have a market for the sale of the things he buys. If
no such market existed, the 'fence's' occupation would be gone; and
if there were no 'fences,' there would be fewer thieves. But, as a
matter of fact, the trade in stolen goods is a thoroughly organised
one, but carried of so secretly and with such caution as almost to
defy detection.</p>

<p>To make it clear to the reader how the business is managed, I
will instance a burglary of what I may venture to describe as of
the first rank. It has been decided by skilled cracksmen that the
residence of some wealthy person shall be visited. Before this is
done, however, the enterprising burglars have got to know a good
deal about the habits and movements of the people of the house, and
whether they keep much jewellery and money on the premises, and
whether the service of plate is real silver or merely electro. As a
rule, electro is not touched by members of the higher ranks of the
profession.' It is left for the area sneak, or the sham bellhanger
or plumber, who will nick' anything that will fetch the price of a
drink. The burglars' knowledge is gained in a variety of
ways&mdash;sometimes through the servants, at others through the
tradespeople's employés, who call at the houses for orders, and,
again, by a system of espionage on the part of the thieves
themselves. When such knowledge as may be useful in the enterprise
has been derived from some source or other, the fence' is notified
that on such and such a day he may expect some metal' and pea nuts'
(precious stones), so that he is all ready to receive the
goods.</p>

<p>The following letter is a fac-simile of one preserved at
Scotland Yard. It was written by a notorious burglar now undergoing
penal servitude for life for the very burglary he alludes to, and
the deer hold unkel (dear old uncle) was a no less notorious
'receiver,' now dead. This letter was found in the 'receiver's'
house by the police, who were fortunate in securing his
conviction:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">'Deer hold unkel me and a foo rorty ones is
agoing a hunting and shud as ow we maik a bag look out for igh hold
times there will be metal and pea nuts so blow yer bellers
(bellows) hold un and ixpect gud Woos at hanny moment so no more at
presint from ver afectinhate pal The Kid.'</p>

<p>Now let us suppose the gentlemen of the night have been
successful and made a good haul, and we will assume that three or
four are in the swim, for it is a notorious fact that burglars work
in gangs. The late Mr. Charles Peace&mdash;who regarded burglary as
a fine art, and whose life came to an untimely end at Armley Jail,
Leeds, one gloomy morning years ago&mdash;scorned companions, as is
well known, but he was quite an exception, and your professional
housebreaker is generally accompanied by one or more companions.
Well, having succeeded in their task, one of the number is deputed
trustee for the time being, and he hurries off to the 'fence,' who
appraises the goods, allowing from one-eighth to one-tenth of their
approximate value; pays for them in hard coin of the realm, then
immediately the silver goes into the melting-pot, which stands
ready in a bed of glowing charcoal. Stones are deftly extracted
from jewellery, and the gold is treated the same way as the
silver.</p>

<p>The ingots of gold and silver, together with the stones, are
then taken by the 'fence' himself, or a confidential agent, to some
part of the Continent&mdash;generally Holland, Belgium, or
Germany&mdash;where there is a ready market for them amongst
unprincipled traders. In the case of very large and very fine
stones they are sent direct to India or Persia, where, of course,
the 'fence' must have agents. It will thus be seen that, without
organisation and system, this illegal traffic could not be carried
on. Of course it does not always follow that the cracksman sells
the stolen goods to the 'fence,' for, knowing as he does that he
only gets a very small proportion of the value, he tries to obtain
more by pawning them or selling them to private individuals. But
this is such a risky mode of disposal, and so frequently leads to
detection, that it is generally beginners and greenhorns who resort
to it.</p>

<p>I hope I have now made it clear to the reader that the
difficulty of getting a conviction against the fence' is the
difficulty of getting actual proof, such as can be accepted in law.
For thieves will suffer almost any punishment rather than 'split'
on the fence,' while it is a very rare thing for a 'fence' to keep
stolen property on his premises many hours together. In the case of
gold, silver, and jewels, he has a secret hiding-place so cunningly
contrived that it defies discovery by the police.</p>

<p>In the case of the robbery I am dealing with I knew that big
Scottie, who had been convicted, must have been in league with a
'fence,' and in trying to devise some means of getting to know who
this was I hit upon the idea of visiting the thieves' kitchen in
the New Cut. I was too well acquainted with the ways and habits of
thieves not to know that there were possibilities of learning
something of value if I mixed with the pariahs as one of them. Much
of the success that has attended me in pry profession has been due
to my ability and willingness to assume disguises, and to suffer
inconvenience and discomfort for the time being. I have always gone
upon the principle that, to hunt well one must be intimately
acquainted with the habits of the animals to be hunted. And so I
have made the peculiarities of criminals a close study; I have
learned something of the form their craft and cunning takes; I know
their jargon and argo, and how they live and act towards each other
in their haunts. No man who does not know something of these things
can possibly be a successful detective. I must say, however, I was
peculiarly fortunate in my visit to the thieves' lodging in the New
Cut, and that an unusual turn of luck served me by putting the
'Boss' in my way. Necessarily I had to use some deception in order
to draw him, but I must maintain that that was well justified by
the end I had in view. My next step now was to work up the pedigree
of Heathcote &amp; Son,' and get such evidence against them as
would effectually put a stop to their nefarious business.</p>

<p>By a great deal of patient and persevering inquiring, and by
following up the most minute clues, I ascertained that Moses Davis
had been born in London, but, when about twelve years of age, he
had been taken by an uncle to the Hague, where he resided for
twelve years, and came under the notice of the police for various
nefarious practices. At last, when the country had become too hot
to hold him, he returned to London and became a 'receiver,' and a
trainer of young thieves, and in this capacity he brought himself
under the notice of the London police. But, when they showed their
anxiety to become more closely acquainted with him, he suddenly
disappeared from his haunts and went to Berlin, where he remained
some years, and suffered a term of imprisonment for forgery.</p>

<p>Soon after his release he once more returned to London in
company with his son, who was about four or five-and-twenty. For a
year or so after he had once more settled in the British Metropolis
he would seem to have lived in a very obscure way, and no
information was forthcoming with regard to his conduct during that
period. But that he was not indifferent during that time to what
was going on in London was proved by his presenting himself one
morning at the office of the firm of lawyers who were trying to
find the heir to the property known as Murder Buildings, and making
an offer to them to rent one of the houses on a yearly tenancy. He
gave his name as Arthur Heathcote, and stated that he had been in
business in Berlin as a commission agent, but had not been
altogether successful. He offered to pay a whole year's rent in
advance, and as the lawyers could not resist the temptation of this
offer, they closed with him, and in due time the notorious Moses
Davis and his son blossomed forth as 'Arthur Heathcote &amp; Son,
commission agents.'</p>

<p>So much did I learn of this interesting character, but let me
state that I kept my own secret for the time being, and did not let
it be known that Mr. Arthur Heathcote was the rascally Moses Davis,
'receiver,' thief-trainer, and thief. My business now was to get
sufficient evidence against him that would ensure his conviction as
a receiver of stolen property, and I knew that that was the most
difficult part of the whole business, for I could not go to him
myself with stolen property and ask him to buy it, nor could I
consort with thieves who had stolen property to sell, as the law
would not tolerate that. Nevertheless, I was resolved to have
'Messrs. Heathcote and Son' somehow or another, and to stop their
infamous trade. At last I resolved to call upon them, so as to gain
some personal knowledge of them. I perhaps need scarcely say that I
did not call in my capacity of detective, but attired in a
well-worn frock coat, a rusty chimney-pot hat, with the expression
of my face altered by smoke-coloured spectacles; and carrying a
small hand-bag, such as are used by lawyers and city men, I
presented myself at Heathcote and Son's business premises. I found
that one of the rooms had been fitted up as an office. There was a
counter, a desk, a stool or two, some pens and ink, and a few
letter and day books.</p>

<p>As I entered a young man came from an inner room, and his Jewish
origin was so clearly traceable in his cast of face that I had no
difficulty in recognising Mr. Davis's son. He was rather slovenly
dressed, had small, restless, beady eyes, and a wicked, crafty
expression generally.</p>

<p>'Are you Mr. Arthur Heathcote?' I asked.</p>

<p>'No; I'm Mr. Arthur Heathcote's son. What do you want?'</p>

<p>'I want Mr. Arthur Heathcote.'</p>

<p>'Well, he ain't here at present.'</p>

<p>'Where is he?'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know that you have any business to ask that
question,' said this vulgar young man, with a sneer.</p>

<p>'Oh, indeed. It's a pity Mr. Arthur Heathcote does not leave a
more agreeable person to represent him during his absence,' I said,
pointedly. 'You must have rather a curious class of customers to
deal with since you haven't yet learned the rudiments of
politeness.'</p>

<p>He did not seem to like this, and scowled at me angrily, and
said with a snap&mdash;</p>

<p>'Why don't you state your business?'</p>

<p>'I told you I wanted Mr. Arthur Heathcote. Your father, I
presume.'</p>

<p>'Yes, my father. Well, he's not here.'</p>

<p>'So you said before. But when will he be here?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. Perhaps not for a few days.'</p>

<p>'He's out of town, then?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Umph! That's unfortunate,' I said, musingly, and with an air of
keen disappointment, while I watched young Davis through my smoked
spectacles. Nevertheless, I was not disappointed, for I thought
that, cunning as this young fellow was, he might be trapped into
some admission that would tell against him. I saw him look at me
scrutinisingly, and at last he said in a milder tone to that he had
hitherto used&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, as the old man's not here you can't see him. But I'm his
representative; you may safely confide your business to me if it
concerns the firm.'</p>

<p>'It does concern the firm,' I answered quickly.</p>

<p>'Very well, then, I represent the firm.'</p>

<p>For some moments I acted as if I could not make up my mind what
to do. I assumed a very thoughtful attitude, and stroked my beard
after the manner of one who ponders deeply. Then I moved uneasily
about, and at last I asked&mdash;</p>

<p>'You do commission business, don't you?'</p>

<p>'Yes, all kinds.'</p>

<p>'That is, you buy and sell on commission, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Are you a buyer or seller?'</p>

<p>'A seller.'</p>

<p>'Well, what do you wish to trade?'</p>

<p>'White metal,' I answered, never taking my eyes off his face. I
saw an almost imperceptible smile display itself about his mouth, a
smile that seemed plainly to say, 'I know your little game, old
man. You needn't try to deceive me.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean by white metal?' he asked with a cunning look
in his eyes.</p>

<p>'Silver.'</p>

<p>'Silver; then why didn't you say so at once?'</p>

<p>'I thought you would have understood what I meant.'</p>

<p>'What made you think that?' (this very pointedly).</p>

<p>'Oh, I had no particular reason for thinking so,' I answered
carelessly.</p>

<p>'Are you in the trade?' he next asked.</p>

<p>'What trade?' I asked with a charming assumption of
innocence&mdash;of ignorance, any way, of his meaning.</p>

<p>'Why, the silver trade.'</p>

<p>'Oh, dear, no. I go in for all sorts of things&mdash;anything,
in fact, that will bring in the coin.'</p>

<p>'You must be a pretty knowing sort of a fellow,' he
remarked.</p>

<p>'Well, I fancy I know a thing or two.'</p>

<p>'Then I wish you would come to the point and tell me what you
really want, if you really know your own business.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, I know that.'</p>

<p>'You say you've got some silver to sell?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Any quantity of it?' he asked.</p>

<p>'A fairish amount.' As I showed no disposition to go on with the
conversation, he displayed some irritability again as he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Why don't you come to the point, man, and state plainly what it
is you want?'</p>

<p>'I've told you what I want. I want to sell some silver, and I
came here expecting to see your father.'</p>

<p>'Were you recommended to him?' he asked quickly.</p>

<p>'His name was mentioned to me,' I replied cautiously, 'as a
likely person to do business with me. But as he is not here now, if
you will tell me when he will be here I will come again.'</p>

<p>'He may not be here for three or four days yet, perhaps even
longer than that, for he is in Antwerp at present.'</p>

<p>'Antwerp!' I exclaimed, pricking up my ears. 'Could you give me
his address in Antwerp?'</p>

<p>For some moments the young fellow seemed rather puzzled what to
do, and, cunning and artful as he was, he did not seem equal to the
occasion. I therefore determined to get behind his barrier of
caution, such as it was, and though it was clear there was no other
person within earshot, I leaned over the counter and whispered in a
mysterious manner&mdash;</p>

<p>'Look here, cully, it's all right. I can put a good thing in his
way, and must see him. My business won't keep.'</p>

<p>'Why don't you tell me what it is, then?' he said, displaying
some anxiety.</p>

<p>'No, I won't do that. I prefer to see your father, and if you
give me his address I'll start for Antwerp to-night.'</p>

<p>Again and again did young Davis try to get out of me what my
business was, and what had sent me; but I was inflexible, and
fenced his questions in a manner that, so far from raising his
suspicions, was calculated to inspire him with confidence in me.
But I was careful not to mention anything about stolen goods. My
remarks were ambiguous, but so framed that his inference could
scarcely be any other than that I was anxious to dispose of a large
quantity of ill-gotten gains. At last, when he found I would not
yield, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, when I last beard from the old man he was staying at the
Hotel des Flandres.'</p>

<p>'At Antwerp?'</p>

<p>'Yes. But perhaps he's not there now, for he was going to
Brussels.'</p>

<p>My plans were soon formed. I did not waste any more time with
the son, but, merely remarking that I should, no doubt, see him
again, I wished him good day and left, and I laughed in my sleeve
as I thought how well he had played into my hands.</p>

<p>That night I started for Antwerp, feeling sure that Mr. Davis
was not in Antwerp on legitimate business, and I was resolved to
find out what his business was if mortal man could do so. I was
armed with official particulars of Moses Davis <i>alias</i> Arthur
Heathcote's career, and I also carried with me an official letter
to the chief of the Antwerp police.</p>

<p>It was a clear, warm morning as I entered the River Scheldt, and
I was elated at the prospect of being able to stop old Mo. Davis's
shameful trade. I had no eye for the picturesqueness that meets the
visitor who travels by boat that sixty-two miles of river, from its
mouth to the quaint old town of Antwerp, with its tall and
curiously built houses, on many of which the Spaniards have left
their mark. My mind was preoccupied with my mission, and my
eagerness to stop the career of the old rascal would not allow me
to think of anything else. As soon as ever I could get on shore, I
jumped into a cab, and drove to the Hotel des Flandres, and to my
delight learned that Moses Davis, under the name of Arthur
Heathcote, was staying there. My next step was to place myself in
communication with the chief of police and present my letter. That
functionary received me very graciously, and having listened
patiently to my story about the interesting stranger then within
the gates of the old city, he sent for one of his staff, who, he
informed me, was one of the sharpest detectives on the Continent,
and knew almost every notorious character in Europe, to say nothing
of those located within Antwerp itself. This person's name was
Gaspard Bompard, a most extraordinary individual. He was only about
five feet high, but thick set, and a suggestiveness about him of
enormous strength. Indeed, I very soon learnt that his strength was
almost phenomenal. He was, I think, the ugliest man I ever saw in
my life, and surely no human being ever more closely resembled a
monkey than he did. And yet he was married to a charming woman, who
was as handsome as he was ugly, and he was the father of twelve
children, all of whom were living. He was possessed of only one
eye, the other one having been gouged out by a ruffian whom Bompard
was endeavouring to arrest. That one eye saw more, however, than
tens of thousands of people see with both their eyes. Nothing
seemed to escape him. His powers of observation and quickness of
sight were simply marvellous. In spite of his somewhat forbidding
appearance, I soon found that he was really a good fellow and a
most agreeable companion, for he was full of witticisms, and had an
inexhaustible fund of anecdote and story. But, perhaps, not the
least remarkable trait in his character was his systematic and
business-like habits. As soon as he learnt my mission he requested
me to accompany hint to his house, and there he took from his
bookcase one of a number of manuscript volumes, his own
compilation, in which he had a record of criminals who had figured
in the courts in various parts of Europe. Each volume was
accurately indexed, and with very little searching he found a
record of <i>'Moses Davis. Religion, Jew. Origin, English. Place of
birth, London. Lived for some years with a relative in the Hague.
Arrested by the police for illicit trafficking, but escaped.
Supposed to have returned to London. Subsequently he resided in
Berlin under the name of Ephraim Cohen, was arrested there in
&mdash;&mdash; for forgery, and suffered five years' imprisonment.
Not known what became of him after that.'</i></p>

<p>I was able to supply the missing links of the man's career from
the time he left Berlin and returned to the British metropolis, and
then Bompard exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'You may depend upon it he has come here to trade with a
rascal&mdash;a Jew also&mdash;by name Maurice Abraham, who buys
stolen goods from abroad. He confines himself to jewellery and gold
and silver, and he does a very large business indeed. We know all
this, but hitherto we have not been able to get our claws upon him,
for you will well understand the difficulties in the way of proving
transactions of this kind are very great. But if you will take upon
yourself the responsibility and risk of swearing an information
against Moses Davis to the effect that, to the best of your belief,
he came here to sell the proceeds of the robbery you speak of, we
will have Maurice Abraham's house searched, and the possibilities
are we may get sufficient evidence to warrant an arrest of both
men.'</p>

<p>It did not take me long to make up my mind what to do. That was
to swear the necessary information. And that being done, and after
I had furnished the Antwerp police with a list of the stolen
things, a <i>posse</i> of police proceeded to Abraham's house, and
I accompanied them. The search was thorough and systematic, and
brought to light a large quantity of property that there was strong
reason for thinking was stolen. Some of this property consisted of
roughly cast ingots of gold and silver. But what interested me more
was the finding in an iron box, which Abraham was compelled to
open, some of the identical jewellery of which I had a list as
having been stolen from the house in London, and for which Big
Scottie and his companions were suffering penal servitude. The Jew
was asked to account for the presence of this. He made various
statements, and prevaricated very much; but at last, under great
pressure, and finding that the truth was out and could not be
gainsaid, he confessed having bought it from Arthur Heathcote, but
protested that he did not know it to be stolen property. Of course
the protest did not serve him, and as there was now direct evidence
of the trade he was carrying on he was arrested, and an hour later
the police, much to my delight, had secured Moses Davis, who was at
once lodged in gaol. As the formalities preceding his extradition
would occupy quite a fortnight, I hurried back to London and
secured a warrant for the arrest of the son. Then I went to Murder
Buildings, in company with four constables, to secure him.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the look of utter despair that came into
his face as he realised his position, and no less remarkable was
the look of ferocious hatred with which he regarded me.</p>

<p>'I will have your life for this!' he hissed in his impotent
rage.</p>

<p>I merely smiled, and told him that cunning in the long run
generally outleapt itself, and that it would, no doubt, be some
considerable time before he would have the chance of taking my
life.</p>

<p>This retort seemed to render him as fierce as a freshly-caught
hyaena, and he had to be handcuffed to two policemen. He and his
father had so long carried on their shameful business without being
brought to justice that they had come to think, no doubt, that the
law couldn't reach them; but the precious pair of scoundrels were
trapped at last, and the sudden realisation of the mistake they had
made was well calculated to madden them.</p>

<p>Having sent young Davis to the station in a cab, I remained
behind with two constables to search the premises, and we conducted
that search in such a thorough and systematic way that it seemed as
if nothing of consequence could have escaped. Nevertheless, for
some time we found nothing likely to be of service as evidence
against the prisoners. The wily rascals had apparently been at
pains to hide all trace of their calling. At last, however, we were
rewarded. My attention was attracted to a large square of the flag
pavement in the cellar, which struck me as having recently been
moved. On tapping this stone it gave off a hollow sound. We,
therefore, raised it, not without difficulty, for it was heavy, and
we then found that it masked a neatly-built brick pit, about six
feet long, three broad, and three deep. Here were crucibles,
ladles, ingot moulds, a charcoal furnace, and a supply of charcoal,
with an ingenious pair of circular bellows, worked with a handle
like a hurdy-gurdy. This pair of bellows was used, obviously, for
generating great heat in the charcoal furnace when the melting
process was going on. But a more important discovery than this was
a wooden box about a foot and a half square, and lined with block
tin. The box contained a most valuable collection of precious
stones of all kinds that had evidently been removed from jewellery.
There were gold watches and several gold and silver ingots, besides
a small old-fashioned gold casket set with precious stones. We
subsequently found that this casket was a family heirloom. It
belonged to the period of Henry VIII., and for over two hundred
years had been in possession of the representatives of one family,
from whom it had been stolen a few months previously. Why Davis and
his son had not extracted the stones and put the gold in the
melting-pot it is difficult to say; but probably they hoped some
day to sell it at a large figure to some Eastern potentate, for it
was just the sort of thing to take the fancy of a semi-civilised
monarch. As it was, it was restored, after a time, to its original
owner, who was delighted to get it back.</p>

<p>Three weeks after young Davis's arrest I brought his father
under an extradition warrant from Antwerp to London, and the two
worthies having been committed for trial, I was enabled to
accumulate such evidence against then that the old man got a life
sentence, and the son twenty years, and the Metropolis was thus rid
of this Precious Pair of Scoundrels.</p>

<p>Of Murder Buildings it remains for me to say that for four or
five years ruin, melancholy, and desolation continued to hang over
them, their evil reputation being enhanced by the unmasking of the
vile trade carried on by 'Messrs. Arthur Heathcote &amp; Son,
commission agents.' But at last an heir was found in the person of
the grandson of the youngest brother, who had gone to Australia,
married, and died there, leaving a daughter, who married a poor
man. This daughter sacrificed her life in bringing a son into the
world, and this son it was who succeeded to the property. Soon
after his claim had been thoroughly established the original
buildings were razed to the ground, and in their place rose a
stately pile, a portion of which is now a bank, the rest offices;
and the rents derived from the property enable the fortunate owner
to live in luxury and ease and ride in his carriage. From obscure
poverty he has become a man of wealth, influence, and position.
Such are the vagaries of fortune.</p>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>
IX. &mdash; THE SHADOWER SHADOWED<br>
A REMINISCENCE</h2>

<p>I SUPPOSE there are few men, perhaps none at all, who, at some
period of their career, have not had to confess themselves
failures. I was a failure once. It is long ago, and since then I
have been credited with a good many successes in hunting criminals
down. So I can tell this story against myself without my equanimity
being in any way disturbed.</p>

<p>It was in the pre-telephone days, and the birr and tingle of the
bell and the monotonous 'Are you there?' had not added another
disturbing element to one's life. After a busy day I had retired to
my den, where, in dressing-gown and slippers, and ensconsced in the
easiest of easy chairs, I sat weaving pleasant fantasies, as I
watched the smoke of a genuine Manilla curl gracefully
ceilingwards. Suddenly my dreams were rudely dispelled by the
abrupt opening of the door, and the appearance in the threshold of
the humble Hibernian servitor who was supposed to keep my
apartments clean and attend to my smallest wants. The name she had
received at her baptism was Nora, but I could never call her
anything but Bones, not from any fancied resemblance, be it
understood, to the coloured 'Brudder Bones' of the Christy
Minstrels, but because bones were a painfully prominent feature of
her anatomy. They were big bones, angular bones, full of knots and
twists. If ever I twitted her about her skeleton-like appearance,
she used to retort&mdash;</p>

<p>'Shure, sor, thims natural,' meaning the bones. All me people is
of the same build,' by which remark she wished me to understand
that her family were a fleshless race.</p>

<p>I knew nothing about her family, but it always occurred to me
that this sweet creature had bien built on a wrong principle.
Nature seemed to have constructed her at odd times, and had
evidently got confused as to the precise plan that should be
followed. As a natural scarecrow hung in a corn-field Bones might
have made her mark; but in any other capacity I always considered
that she was a mistake. However, she professed great attachment to
me, and so I tolerated her.</p>

<p>'If ye plaze, sor,' she exclaimed now as she burst
unceremoniously on my privacy, 'there's a gint. as is waiting for
yez below.'</p>

<p>'I wish the gint. below would take you, Bones,' I remarked
somewhat irritably, though I fear the point of the remark was lost
upon her, for she answered with an indignant toss of her
triangular-shaped head&mdash;</p>

<p>'Bedad, sor, I wudn't have anything to do wid him if every hair
av his head was gowd, for he's the ugliest blackguard, axing your
pardon, sor, that iver I've seen. And, thanks be to the Lord, sor!
I'm not so wanting in good looks meself that&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, Bones; you are a jewel,' I said, cutting her short, for I
knew that if I didn't do so she would go on for an hour. 'But now,
tell me, who is the gint. below? Is he black?'</p>

<p>'Divil a bit of black, sor. He is a kind of pea-green.'</p>

<p>'Ah, the gentleman below is generally supposed to be black. But
what does the fellow want?'</p>

<p>'Shure, sor, I don't know.'</p>

<p>'Well, what is his name?'</p>

<p>'I don't belave he's got a name, for I kep' on axing him, and be
said it didn't matter about his name; but he wanted to see yez very
pertickular.'</p>

<p>'Very well, then, you can show him up.'</p>

<p>So Bones retired, and a minute or two later the door was once
more thrown open, and the sweet creature announced in a strident
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>'The gint. from below.'</p>

<p>I must confess my first impression of the 'gint.' was far from
favourable, and I saw at once why Bones had described him as being
pea-green, for his complexion approximated more closely to that hue
than any other. Over one eye he wore a patch, and the other eye had
a twist in it. His mouth was extensive, and his ears had something
of an asinine quality about them. When Bones described him as being
ugly she spoke unadulterated truth, for I do believe he was the
ugliest man I ever saw.</p>

<p>'Good evening, guv'nor,' he said, as he twisted a billycock
uneasily about in his hands, while I looked at him, took his size,
and measured him up from top to bottom, and flattered myself that I
had thoroughly gauged him.</p>

<p>'Well, what's your business?' I inquired, by no means pleased
with the man or his manner. Bones still remained at the door, and I
saw that it was as much as she could do to keep her countenance as
she regarded this unprepossessing creature. I should mention that
he had a large bald patch on the top of his head, and the rest of
his cranium was fringed with what I should think was the fiercest
red hair that ever grew on human skull. Then, as to his dress, it
was no less notable than the man himself. It consisted of thick
lace boots, cord trousers two or three inches too short, a black
waistcoat with white spots on it, a black velveteen coat, and a
white choker; so that the fellow's general appearance was
suggestive of the peregrinating psalm-smiter, or the court and
alley gospel tub-thumper. In answer to my inquiry, he jerked his
bludgeon-shaped thumb over his shoulder in the direction of Bones,
the signification of which act I at once understood, and I told
Bones she might retire; and as she closed the door behind her I
heard her break into a loud guffaw.</p>

<p>'That woman ain't got much manners,' remarked my strange visitor
with a supreme disregard for grammar and polished speech.</p>

<p>'Well, come now, what's your business?' I demanded again in an
acidulated tone, for I felt very displeased, and did not like to
hear him say anything disrespectful of Bones, for whom I had a high
regard, despite her lack of flesh.</p>

<p>'You are Dick Donovan?' he asked with easy self-assurance.</p>

<p>'I am.'</p>

<p>'And you are a detective?'</p>

<p>'Yes, that's my calling.'</p>

<p>Here my gentleman dived a hand into the breast-pocket of his
coat, and produced a card the size of an ordinary playing-card, on
which was written in a fairly good round hand&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">MR. BILL SMITHERS,<br>
(Ex-cracksman),<br>
Evangelical Street Preacher, Sheffield.</p>

<p>As I read this, and looked at the one-eyed, big-mouthed,
long-eared, bald-headed, red-haired, rusty-voiced specimen before
me, I smiled as I remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>'So you are Mr. Smithers, the converted housebreaker, who joined
the Hallelujah Band in Sheffield, and who has been held up by that
body as a living example of the converts they can make out of the
most unlikely material?'</p>

<p>'The same, guv'nor,' answered Mr. Smithers with a grin, which so
distorted his face that it would have served admirably as a model
for a Gargoyle.</p>

<p>'Then, perhaps, you will now inform me, Mr. Smithers, to what I
am to attribute the honour of this visit?'</p>

<p>'Certainly I will, guv'nor. You won't mind my sitting down?' and
he suited the action to the word. Oh, pardon my oversight!' I said.
'I am so seldom honoured with the presence of such a distinguished
visitor that I am afraid I've somewhat lost my presence of
mind.'</p>

<p>'That's hirony, guv'nor, ain't it?' he remarked with another
grin.</p>

<p>'I suppose you mean irony? Well, it depends how you take it. But
come, let us to business.'</p>

<p>'Right you are, guv'nor.' He seemed to make a point of calling
me guv'nor. 'My business is this yere&mdash;I've come to offer you
my services.'</p>

<p>'Offer your services?' I said with an incredulous laugh.</p>

<p>'Yes. For two months you've been a trying to nab the covey what
stole the plate from Mr. Jones's, the member o' Parliament, out at
Hampstead.'</p>

<p>'How do you know?' I asked quickly, and becoming interested at
once. Mr. Jones was an exceedingly wealthy M.P., who lived at
Hampstead on his own estate, and a little more than two months
previously his house had been broken into during the absence of
himself and family, and a large quantity of valuable silver
articles had been stolen. During those two months I had used every
endeavour to get a clue to the burglar, but had utterly failed,
much to my annoyance. All the haunts of vice in the metropolis had
been visited, but without result, and I began to despair of
capturing the thief.</p>

<p>'Never mind, guv'nor, how I know; but, you see, I do know,' he
answered, once more screwing his face up into Gargoyle-like
ugliness.</p>

<p>'Well, go on,' I said, with suppressed excitement, and beginning
to regard the fellow with more respect, and to be less irritated by
his ugliness and impertinent familiarity.</p>

<p>'Of course you would like to cop the fellow what done it?'</p>

<p>'Of course I should,' I answered with emphasis.</p>

<p>'Then I'm the man that can give you the straight tip.'</p>

<p>'You?' Here I opened my eyes in pleased amazement, and was
almost disposed to seize the fellow's hand and wring it.</p>

<p>'Yes, guv'nor. You see, I goes a-preaching in the slums now,
a-trying to convert pore lost thieves and murderers, and in a place
I was a-visiting the other day I heerd as it was Yankee Jim as done
the job at Mr. Jones's house!</p>

<p>'Yankee Jim&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well, that's what his pals call him, because he's been across
the herring pond two or three times; but his proper name's Jim
Wickins.'</p>

<p>I had up to that moment never heard of Jim Wickins, or Yankee
Jim, but I did not deem it prudent to let my visitor know of that
fact, so I remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, I know Yankee Jim.'</p>

<p>'You know him?' exclaimed the visitor quickly.</p>

<p>'Well, that is, I know him by repute.'</p>

<p>'Just so,' and once more Mr. Smithers smiled his fascinating
smile.</p>

<p>'But are you sure he's the man that committed the burglary?'</p>

<p>'Sure! Just as sure as I'm talking to you, guv'nor.'</p>

<p>'Then I'll have Jim under lock and key before I'm a week
older.'</p>

<p>'Well, look you here, guv'nor. If I wasn't converted, I'd a bet
you a tenser that you won't.'</p>

<p>'Why?' I asked sternly.</p>

<p>'Why a Because Jim's one of the smartest dodgers in this
country, and the detective ain't born that could take him.'</p>

<p>'Oh, indeed!' I said, with a scornful laugh. 'Now that you have
been good enough to give me the information, I'm prepared to stake
my reputation that his capture is merely a question of days.'</p>

<p>'May be so if I help you.'</p>

<p>'You?'</p>

<p>'Yes, that's what I've come for. I've knowed Jim, I may say, all
my life; afore I was converted me and him used to do our biz
together, and I tell you, guv'nor, he's that smart he'd take your
eyebrows off without your knowing.'</p>

<p>'Then he must be smart,' I sneered.</p>

<p>'You take my word for it that he is. Well now, it's this way.
Jim ain't half a bad sort o' fellow, and I believe he can be
converted same as I am, so I'm going to give him into your hands;
and when he's done his bit, I'm a-going to work on him, and if be
ain't like wax in my hands then my name ain't Bill Smithers.'</p>

<p>'Well, I certainly appreciate your philanthropic motives,' I
answered, and in carrying out your programme you will be rendering
a service to the State, as well as bringing a lost sheep to the
fold. Now, tell me; where is Jim to be found?'</p>

<p>'Ah, that's it; that's where my services will come in. You see
Jim's that 'cute that you might be alongside of him and never know
it.'</p>

<p>'Then he must be 'cute,' said I with a contemptuous smile, and
feeling indignant that this fellow should think that I could be so
easily hood-winked by a common burglar.</p>

<p>'He <i>is</i> 'cute, guv'nor. His professional brethren calls
him&mdash;' Here Mr. Bill Smithers ran his knobby fingers through
his fiery red hair as if he had got into a mental difficulty.</p>

<p>'Can I help you?' I asked.</p>

<p>'What was the name of that bloke&mdash;he was a god, you know,
what used to change hisself?'</p>

<p>'What&mdash;do you mean Proteus?' I said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>'Ah, yes, that's him. Well, Yankee Jim's pals says he's a
Proteass because he can change hisself so.'</p>

<p>'Umph! He's very clever, no doubt; but he'll find, perhaps, that
the law is cleverer than he is. But you have not told me in what
part of the world Mr. Jim Wickins is sojourning at the present
moment.'</p>

<p>'No, I haven't, guv'nor; but I'm going to tell you now. He's in
Liverpool.'</p>

<p>'In Liverpool! Whereabouts there?'</p>

<p>'I think he's a-staying with his old mother in a street off
Scotland Road. I don't know the name of the street, nor the number
of the house, but I can find it, so you'll have to take me with
you, guv'nor, if you want to nab Jim.'</p>

<p>This proposal somewhat startled me, for Mr. Bill Smithers was
not a gentleman whose company I should care to be seen in. I
therefore suggested that the business might be managed without his
putting himself to the inconvenience to accompany me, and I
ventured to hint to Mr. Smithers that, as it was probable
preaching, however gratifying to his awakened sense of right, was
not as financially profitable as he could perhaps desire, I should
not fail to see that he received some substantial recognition for
his valuable services after Yankee Jim had been captured. Thereupon
Mr. Smithers clapped his hands upon his breast and turned his
crooked eye up to the ceiling; at least, I think he did, but, as a
matter of fact, one could not be quite sure where the eye was
turned, and as something like a benign expression spread itself
over his ugly face he said&mdash;</p>

<p>No, guv'nor, I ain't a cove of that sort. I'm a doing this out
o' kindness to Jim. You see, he's got an old mother, and a wife and
two youngsters, and if his career ain't stopped, he'll come to the
gallows as sure as eggs is eggs. When he's been convwicted for this
burglary, and has done his time, I intends to tackle him, and get
him to join the Hallelujah Band. That's what I'm a-aiming at, cos
you see it's me dooty to try and save them as is gone wrong, and I
tell you straight, guv'nor, I loves Jim better nor my own
brother.'</p>

<p>Here the visitor wiped a tear, real or imaginary, from his
crooked eye.</p>

<p>I must confess that Smithers' apparent disinterestedness, so far
as money was concerned, impressed me in his favour, and to such an
extent was this the case that I offered him a Manilla, and invited
him to taste some exceedingly good Scotch I had; but he put up his
hands in a deprecating way, and said he had given up all them kind
o' wices,' which assertion impressed me still more deeply. The
result was that after some further conversation I arranged to meet
Mr. Smithers the following day at Euston Railway Station, and
proceed to Liverpool in his company in search of Jim.</p>

<p>When he had taken his departure, Bones put in an appearance
again, and as she spread the cloth for my evening meal she
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, sor, if ever I saw a blackguard, that fellow that's just
gone's the one.'</p>

<p>'He <i>was,</i> Bones,' I answered reprovingly, and speaking in
the past tense, 'but now he's converted, and is a preacher, and not
at all a bad fellow.'</p>

<p>'A pracher! Arrah, be me sowl, but that bates all. What does he
prache?'</p>

<p>'Well, he preaches against all sorts of evil and sin, and tries
to convert people.'</p>

<p>'Convart,' exclaimed Bones; 'convart,' she repeated,
'spluttering with laughter; 'and is he trying to convart you,
sor?'</p>

<p>'Bones,' I said severely, 'put the supper on the table at once,
and then betake yourself to the lower regions. Your familiarity is
objectionable. You forget yourself.'</p>

<p>'Oh, very well, sor; but I only axed the question.'</p>

<p>'Then don't ax any more questions. I'm not sure that I want
converting. I'm not a burglar nor a forger, nor anything of that
kind.'</p>

<p>'And is that gint. a burglar and forger, and that kind o'
thing?' she asked pointedly.</p>

<p>I did not answer this question, but expressed by my severe looks
that I was displeased.</p>

<p>Bones made no further remark. She set the supper in silence and
then retired, much to my relief, for I wanted to think over the
good luck that seemed to have come in my way. I was a young man,
and might say I was on the threshold of my career. The robbery at
Mr. Jones's house had been of a very daring character, and I had
received instructions to try and capture the thieves. Success on my
part meant very much to me, while failure would, I knew, damage
what little reputation for cleverness I had earned. There was the
strongest possible reason for thinking that the stolen plate had
been concealed by the thieves in a somewhat extensive plantation
that adjoined Mr. Jones's estate. The result was I had had three
men watching that plantation day and night ever since the burglary,
for though I had myself spent days in searching the wood, I had not
been able to find the hiding-place of the silver, but that it was
there we were pretty certain, and we felt equally certain that the
thief or thieves would come back for it sooner or later. So far,
this surmise had not proved correct, and it seemed as if there was
to be no capture after all.</p>

<p>Now Bill Smithers was a somewhat noted character, for the
Hallelujah Band was the forerunner of the Salvation Army, but
confined its operations to the Midland counties, Sheffield being
its head-quarters. The leaders of the band had got hold of
Smithers, who had been a daring thief, and, having 'converted' him,
they carted him round the country, and, though an ignorant and
illiterate man, he was said to have the power of a certain rough
and fiery eloquence that told mightily on the class of people he
had to deal with. He had thus earned for himself a considerable
amount of renown. As regards Yankee Jim, I found on inquiries he
was posted at headquarters as one of the 'dangerous classes.' He
was described as an Englishman who had spent some time in America,
but no conviction in England had been proved against him. The
information about him had been sent from America, but no one in the
London force knew anything at all about him from personal
knowledge.</p>

<p>It will readily be understood how elated I was as I saw that I
should, in all probability, have the satisfaction of bringing this
rascal to justice; and I need scarcely say that, as I thought the
matter over, it seemed to me that, after all, the plate could not
have been hidden in the wood, for Yankee Jim would not have gone to
Liverpool and left it behind him. So, early the following morning,
I gave orders that the watchers at the plantation could be
withdrawn; and I made known to the chief at the Yard' that I had
got on the trail of the burglar, and hoped to be able to announce
his capture within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>'Well, it will be a feather in your cap, Donovan,' said the
chief. But how did you get the information?'</p>

<p>'Ah, you must pardon me, sir,' I answered with an air of
self-assurance, 'but that is my own little secret.'</p>

<p>'Oh, certainly,' he answered, as long as you bring law-breakers
to justice, we need not trouble ourselves about the means you
employ. Well, I wish you good luck, and if you capture the thief
and recover Mr. Jones's plate, you may depend upon it it will put
you a considerable way up the ladder.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, sir,' I said. 'I hope it will. Of course I cannot
say anything about the recovery of the plate, but the arrest of the
burglar is certain, I think.'</p>

<p>'That's all right,' replied the chief. 'The sooner the
better.'</p>

<p>As I had some time to spare I returned to my lodgings for my
portmanteau, and as Bones opened the door for me she
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'If you plaze, sor, the gint. as come last night&mdash;him as
does the praching&mdash;has been agin, and wants yez to be at the
station to catch the four o'clock train, as he cannot go by the
other train, bekase he's got some business on hand.'</p>

<p>This was rather annoying, as we had arranged to start at twelve,
and naturally I was all anxiety to be off. However, there was no
help for it, and I had to restrain my patience until the afternoon.
A quarter of an hour before the departure of the train I was at the
station, and found Bill Smithers there. He was more fearfully and
wonderfully got up than on the previous evening, for his cranium
was surmounted by a chimney-pot hat two or three sizes too small,
and surrounded with a deep band of crape. He wore a white choker
and a very rusty black frock coat, with well frayed black trousers
ever so much too short. He'd 'high-low' boots and white stockings,
the stockings showing over the tops of his boots, owing to the
shortness of his trousers. To complete his remarkable costume, he
wore black cotton gloves several sizes too large. He carried with
him a polished leather handbag that seemed pretty weighty, so that
I was led to inquire what he had in it, and he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, thems me clothes and Bibles.'</p>

<p>'Bibles!'</p>

<p>'Yes. I'm a-going to give them to the thieves in Liverpool.'</p>

<p>As the bag was a pretty bulky affair, the guard suggested that
it should go into his van, but Bill objected, saying he preferred
to look after its precious contents himself, and so he took it into
the carriage and put it under his feet, and, as it seemed to me, he
regarded it with the most affectionate interest the whole of the
journey. Of course I paid Bill's railway fare, besides supplying
him with such creature comforts as are generally considered
indispensable on a railway journey. On arriving at our destination
my travelling companion delicately hinted that his inner man would
be the better were it lined, and said something about Nature
abhoring a vacuum. I was not slow to take the hint, and suggested
dinner.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Bill thankfully, and smacking his lips, I ain't
much of a eater, but I confess I likes me dinner; for, though I am
converted, I still has little weaknesses of the flesh.</p>

<p>I did not feel altogether comfortable in Bill's company, for he
attracted a great deal of attention by his remarkable
costume&mdash;the green patch on one eye, the twist in the other,
his pea-green complexion and fiery red hair, to say nothing of his
dirty white stockings that so objectionably protruded themselves
from beneath the frayed bottoms of his polished trousers. My
<i>amour propre</i> was certainly not flattered, for I had no
desire to be taken for one of this creature's 'conversions.' I was
therefore about to dive into a restaurant close to the station,
but, with a benign smile, Bill said he knew a first-class house,
where as snug a dinner could be had as Liverpool could furnish.
Although I made a mild protest, I had no alternative but to give
in, and Mr. Smithers led the way to one of the best hotels in Lime
Street, where, like one to the manner born, he marched into the
coffee-room and, hanging his hat on a peg and drawing off his
cotton gloves, he placed his precious bag of Bibles on a chair
beside him, and as he sat down with an air of gratification, he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'All, this is comfort. Now what is it going to be?'</p>

<p>As I felt so thoroughly in his hands, I told him I could not do
better than allow him to order the repast. He was not slow to avail
himself of the permission, and I was astonished at the dinner he
<i>did</i> order. There were soup, fish, flesh, fowl, and sweets,
with a variety of vegetables and dessert. Then he rubbed his hands
together and sighed gratefully, remarking that he didn't know when
he had felt so hungry, and he supposed that the journey down from.
London was responsible for it.</p>

<p>As the waiter served the first course he inquired what wine we
would like. I intended to have contented myself with a humble
bottle of ale, and, as a mere matter of form, said to
Bill&mdash;</p>

<p>'Of course you won't take anything?'</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers smiled. I shall never forget his smile. It was a
thing well calculated to impress itself on anybody's memory. It was
a smile that involved the whole of his features, including the
crooked eye and the big ears. If one attempted to give a pictorial
representation of that truly remarkable smile, people would spry
that it was a gross exaggeration&mdash;that no one save a
professional clown or a born contortionist could possibly twist his
face into so many lines and wrinkles, and at the same time impart
to the features such an expression of <i>knowingness.</i> But Bill
did it, and his strange smile haunts me still.</p>

<p>'Well, I tell you what it is guv'nor,' he remarked
confidentially as he untwisted his face, 'I never in all my life
felt so like a bottle of fizz as I do to-day. Now do you think it
would be very outrageous for a converted one to so indulge the
carnal appetite?'</p>

<p>For the first time I began to think that Bill was a consummate
humbug; but, having regard to the service he was to render me, I
felt I could not deny him, so I answered in a somewhat crestfallen
manner&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, perhaps for once in a way it might be overlooked, though.
I think you ought to mortify the flesh rather than indulge it.'</p>

<p>'True, true,' said Bill with a sigh; 'but I feel very weak
to-day. After this I'll say farewell to worldly pleasures.'</p>

<p>I saw I could not get out of it, so I ordered the champagne, and
Bill ate, drank, and was merry. After the very sumptuous repast he
leaned back in his chair and laid his hands on his waistcoat,
saying it was wonderful what a 'rewyving' effect a good dinner had
on a fellow. I had to admit that I felt very comfortable myself,
and that one of my little weaknesses was a good dinner. Then Bill's
crooked eye rolled about, and his countenance assumed a lugubrious
expression, as he said mournfully&mdash;</p>

<p>'We ought not to feel so joyful when we consider the painful
errand we are on.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps not,' said I; 'but, then, remember that after this
Yankee Jim has served his time he is to be as wax in your hands,
and you are to convert him. A lost sheep gathered to the fold is a
matter for rejoicing over; and as you seem so sanguine about Jim's
conversion let us regard this little feast as having been partaken
of to specially mark Jim's change for the better.'</p>

<p>I knew, of course, that I was talking bunkum, but what did it
matter? The man I was talking to was a humbug. I was convinced of
it now, and so I was not very particular.</p>

<p>Having smoked a cigar, I told Bill that I thought the time for
action had arrived, and I suggested that in order to prevent any
possibility of Yankee Jim escaping, it might be advisable for me to
go to the head station and secure the services of a couple of plain
clothes policemen to accompany us to Scotland Road, which was an
evil neighbourhood, and the resort of some of the worst characters
to be found in Liverpool.</p>

<p>'Yes, it's not a bad idea,' replied Bill, looking very
thoughtful and grave, but first of all I will see if I can find
Jim. You see, he might not be at home; and if we were to go and he
was not there, we should not catch him. Our presence in such a
region would be sure to attract attention, and such is the
freemasonry amongst these people that Jim to a dead certainty would
be warned, and you might then as well try to catch a bird by
putting salt on its tail as catch Jim.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps you are right,' I remarked, but you may depend upon it,
if the fellow is in Liverpool, I'll have him.'</p>

<p>'He's in Liverpool&mdash;I'll take my oath to it!' exclaimed
Bill with energy, 'but all the traps in the town won't catch him
unless I deliver him into your hands.'</p>

<p>'Well, I wish you'd make haste and do it,' I said, 'for I am
getting impatient.'</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers glanced up at the clock.</p>

<p>'It's eight o'clock,' he remarked. 'Now I'll go, and in exactly
two hours' time you be at Lime Street Railway Station with the two
bobbies, and I'll meet you there and report progress. If Jim's at
home we'll go straight to his place, and if he isn't, you bet I'll
know where he is. So by-by till we meet again.'</p>

<p>He buttoned his coat up, put on his rusty hat, and took his bag.
I suggested he should leave it behind, but he said he would need
the Bibles. Then he went out into the night; and, as rain was
pouring down steadily, I addressed myself to another cigar and
congratulated myself on my good fortune, for I was perfectly
certain I should have secured Yankee Jim before many hours had
fled.</p>

<p>Soon after nine I called for the bill and settled it. It was
pretty stiff, but I did not begrudge the money. Then, hailing a cab
I drove to the police station, where, making known my business, and
showing my credentials and my warrant for Jim's arrest, two
trustworthy and stalwart plain clothes constables were placed at my
disposal. Of course I did not explain the <i>modus operandi</i>
that was being pursued for Jim's capture. I simply said that I knew
Jim was in Liverpool, and that I had been promised information that
would enable me to arrest him at his house. So the constables and I
went to the rendezvous, and promenaded up and down the departure
platform where Bill Smithers had promised to meet me. When eleven
o'clock chimed out from the town clocks I was still waiting, but
though I felt a little irritable and impatient I had no misgivings.
At half-past eleven a change had come over me. The constables
became inquisitive too, and annoyed me; but I was very reticent,
and they learnt nothing. When the solemn hour of midnight tolled an
uncomfortable sense of misgiving weighed upon me, and I returned to
the station, and made some cautious inquiries about Yankee Jim, but
was informed that they had never heard of such a character, so I
retired disconsolate and heavy-hearted to my hotel.</p>

<p>I think I passed the worst night I had ever experienced, and at
an early hour I set out to try and find some trace of Mr. Bill
Smithers, but when the day was ended my quest had not been
rewarded, and I felt then that I had been 'sold.' It was a bitter
draught to swallow, but I had to gulp it down, and by that night's
mail I returned to town. When I reported myself at headquarters I
was asked if I had made an arrest.</p>

<p>My answer was a monosyllabic 'No.'</p>

<p>'Not made an arrest!' exclaimed the chief in amazement. 'Why,
you were sure of doing so. You don't mean you've failed?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I answered sadly; 'I am bound to confess that I have
failed. I fear somehow I got on to a wrong track. Anyhow, I have
gained nothing by my journey to Liverpool, except experience.'</p>

<p>The chief was a little puzzled by my manner; but I was not
disposed to enter into explanations then, and, taking my departure,
I went straight to a telegraph office and wired to the headquarters
of the Hallelujah Band at Sheffield to inquire if they could tell
me where Bill Smithers was. Soon the answer cane back:</p>

<p>'He is here, where he has been for many weeks.'</p>

<p>'Has he not been in London the last few days?' I asked.</p>

<p>'No,' was the reply; 'he has not been out of Sheffield for the
last three months.'</p>

<p>My spirits went down into my boots, for I knew then that I had
been 'done brown.'</p>

<p>'Shure, sor, you're not looking well,' Bones remarked when I
reached my home.</p>

<p>'Oh, go to the &mdash;&mdash;.' I am afraid I very nearly said
something naughty, but checked myself in tune, and added: 'No, I am
not very well, Bones.'</p>

<p>'Begorra,' she exclaimed, 'it's that pea-green gint. what's done
it. I knowed it. Didn't I tell you he was a blackguard? Bejabers,
it's a moighty clever man what would desave me.'</p>

<p>'Bones,' said I with the air of a broken-hearted father
reproving a wayward child, 'go downstairs to your den and smother
yourself.'</p>

<p>She went downstairs, looking at me tearfully as she departed in
sorrow, not in anger; but the latter part of my command she did not
carry out. Three days later I received a letter bearing the
Queenstown postmark. It was dated on board the Cunard steamer
Scotia. The following is the letter. I have made no alteration
either in the spelling or the grammar:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Old Pal&mdash;<br>
<br></p>

<p>'I ain't a ungreatful covey, so I rites to thank you for your
kindness. You see wen I corled on you at your diggins I'd a been a
watching of you for many days; and as I ad that nice little haul of
old Jones' silver a hidden in a oiler tree in the wood alongside
his ouse, I knowed I'd be copped if I went to get it. So says I to
myself, says I, dick donovan will have to be kidded, and so as me
and bill smithers had been pals in the rorty old days I gets myself
up like him. Next mornin arter I churned in with you I was a
watching trim ere coves wat was a watching fur me at the wood, and
I sees em go away. Then I got the metal out of the oiler tree, and
stows it in my bag, and you travild along with it to Livirpul. Then
we had that rorty dinner, and, lor, ow I did injiy it, to bee
shore. It was reel andsome of you to do the thing so liberhal, and
I shall allers think of you with grattitood. At ten o'clock I was
a-sailing down the Mercy in the Coonardur, bound fur the land o'
the free, with me pore old muther and the missus and the kids. The
missus had Lakin the births too days afore, so, when you gets this,
we shall be on the billoy hocean a' injoyin' of oursel's. I 'ope
this yeer few lyres will find you well, as they leeves me at
prisint, so no more from your looving old pal, Yankee Jim, propper
name Jim Wickins.'</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe what my feelings were as I
perused this precious document. I had been outwitted by as clever a
scoundrel as ever the slums produced, but I confessed myself a
failure and an ass.</p>

<p>It is needless to say Mr. Jones's plate was never recovered, nor
was the thief ever captured. If the Atlantic cable had been in
existence the ending to this little sketch would have been
different. As it was, I held my peace, stood the chaff of my
comrades, who, without knowing the truth, knew I had failed;
explained to the persistent and inquisitive Bones that the gint.
from below' had annoyed me, but as he had gone to another world, I
should be all right soon. And gradually I recovered my spirits. It
was the first and last time in the course of a long career that I
was ever outshadowed.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>
X. &mdash; CAUGHT IN A TRAP<br>
A THRILLING EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p>IN the early part of the same year as that in which I became an
unwilling actor in the thrilling little drama the particulars of
which I am now about to relate, a series of extensive frauds had
been perpetrated on several well-known houses in London. It had
been my duty to try and hunt the criminals down, and I got on the
track of two men, whom I watched for a little while in order to
make sure I was justified in arresting them. They were both
Americans. At any rate they had come from America, and as they were
not known to the police either on this side or the other side of
the 'Herring Pond,' some caution and judgment had to be exercised
before pouncing on them for fear of committing an error. Ostensibly
they were partners in a business which they termed an 'English and
American agency,' their object being to bring merchants of all
kinds on both sides of the Atlantic into communication, as well as
to sell goods on commission. This, however, as subsequently proved,
was a mere blind, and both the gentlemen were engaged in
transactions of a very different kind, which, if they could only
have carried on uninterruptedly for a few years, would have enabled
them to have retired with a fortune. I was destined, however, to
spoil their little game, but as soon as I got unmistakable evidence
of their crime, one of the birds had flown. The other was arrested,
and it soon became clear that the two men had worked out an
extraordinary and systematic series of frauds, in which they must
have had a considerable number of confederates. Every effort was
made to secure the partner, but without avail, and the man in
custody would reveal nothing. There was not a shadow of a doubt
that they had possessed themselves of an exceedingly large sum of
money, and it was very desirable that we should discover what they
had done with it. But the man whom I had arrested absolutely
declined to give the slightest information either about himself or
those connected with him, and so we were baffled, and it was pretty
evident the fugitive had carried off all the valuables, as well as
papers and books. At any rate, not much was left behind that was
likely to aid us, but I managed to prove one fraud against the
prisoner, and he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Of
course I was very much annoyed that the other principal had slipped
through my fingers, and I confess that I did not entertain much
hope of capturing him. About a fortnight after the man I had
brought to book had been sentenced, I received a letter bearing the
London postmark, which was worded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">'From this day forth you are a marked man, and
your death warrant is signed. The knife or the bullet will sop your
career before you are many weeks older, and you will not have
another chance of getting any more fellows sentenced.'</p>

<p>This letter did not affect me in the least. I had often been
threatened before, and I knew that threatened men live long. I even
considered it a waste of time to try and find out who the stupid
writer was; and so the subject passed out of my mind. On the
morning of the 24th of December the daily papers announced that the
previous night a man had been arrested in Liverpool on suspicion of
being the partner of the convict then undergoing penal servitude
for the great frauds, and that Mr. Dick Donovan, 'the well-known
detective,' would start at once for Liverpool in order to identify
the man, and bring him to London should he prove to be the person
wanted. Of course we in the Yard' were already in possession of
this information, and equally, of course, I had received
instructions to go down to Liverpool, so that the papers were
correct.</p>

<p>I was not very pleased at having to leave town on Christmas Eve,
which I always liked to spend with my friends, and I said some
harsh things about the chance that rendered my going away on this
particular day necessary. However, there was no help for it, and I
arranged to leave by the night train; for duty was duty, and could
not be shirked.</p>

<p>It was a terribly bitter night. It had snowed during the day,
and as the evening came on a severe black frost set in. When I
reached the station I had about ten minutes to spare before the
starting of the train, and so sauntered leisurely down the
platform, hopeful that I might be able to get a compartment to
myself; but that did not seem probable, for, being Christmas Eve,
there were a great many people travelling. I had walked the length
of the train, and was proceeding back when a gentlemanly-looking
man, wearing kid gloves and a fur-trimmed overcoat, stopped in
front of me, and, politely raising his hat, said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Excuse me, but I believe you are Mr. Donovan?' That is my
name,' I answered; 'but you have the advantage of me.'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, my name is Richard Jack,' he said with a smile. 'I am
a solicitor in the city. I know you well by sight, though I have
never had any business with you. You are going to Liverpool, I
believe, if the papers are correct.'</p>

<p>'Yes, they are correct enough in this instance,' I returned.</p>

<p>'Then we'll travel together if you don't mind,' he replied.
'I've secured the corner of a first-class compartment, and tipped
the guard.'</p>

<p>He seemed a very pleasant, affable gentleman, and so I expressed
my willingness to become his travelling companion, and we moved
towards the carriage he indicated. As we came to the door we noted
that another man was seated in one corner of the compartment. He
had on a big fur cap, the flaps pulled down about his ears; he wore
a heavy overcoat, and had a rug wrapped round his knees.</p>

<p>'Confound it!' exclaimed Mr. Jack, 'I thought we should have had
the carriage to ourselves. Suppose we look for another?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' I said, 'it doesn't matter. Besides, the train is
pretty full.'</p>

<p>At this moment the ticket-collector came along, so we took our
seats, displayed our tickets, and in another minute the train was
steaming out of the station. The man in the fur cap seemed to be
already asleep, and was so muffled up that it was impossible to
distinguish his features. Mr. Jack was a little man, with a clean
shaved face, and had he worn a white band round his neck he might
have passed for a curate.</p>

<p>'So you are going down to Liverpool to see if you can identify
the man who has been arrested on suspicion of having been concerned
in the great frauds?' he remarked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I answered shortly, not caring to discuss the matter with
an utter stranger.</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;I don't think <i>you</i> will identify him,' he
said.</p>

<p>There was something in the way in which he uttered these words
that caused me to look at him, and for the first time a suspicion
flashed across my mind that my companion was not what he seemed to
be. What that something was would be very difficult to define.
Perhaps it was the emphasis he laid upon the <i>you,</i> or a
fancied menace in his tone of speaking. But whatever it was my
suspicions <i>were</i> aroused, and a heavy rug I had been in the
act of wrapping about my person I placed on the seat again so as to
have my limbs free. Then I glanced at the third man in the corner.
He seemed to be sunk in profound sleep. Both windows were up, and
were quite obscured with the condensed vapour. I tried to think
that my suspicions were ill-founded, but they would not be shaken
off, and I resolved to keep my eye on Jack, who sat opposite me,
and anticipate any movement of attack that he might display. The
train had already attained a high rate of speed, and I knew there
was a long run before the first stopping place would be
reached.</p>

<p>Presently my <i>vis-a-vis</i> took a flask from his coat pocket
and asked me if I would have a drink.</p>

<p>I declined, He pressed me; I declined, more emphatically; he
pressed me more resolutely, and the manner in which he did this
increased my suspicions. My persistent refusal annoyed him, and he
said sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>'You don't suppose, Mr. Donovan, I want to poison you, do
you?'</p>

<p>'Well, I can't tell,' I said with a laugh. 'It's as well to be
on the safe side. Why don't you take a drink yourself?' I asked as
he restored the flask to his pocket.</p>

<p>'Because I don't want one,' he growled.</p>

<p>'We seem to be in accord, then, on one point,' I remarked, 'for
I don't want one either.'</p>

<p>He made no reply, but rove his arm through the arm-rest at the
side of the window, and opened and shut his fingers five different
times, in a manner that led me at once to the conclusion he was
signalling to his confederate in the corner, for by this time I had
made up my mind that the other man was a confederate, and that I
was trapped. In about five minutes more the train plunged into a
tunnel, and at that moment Jack sprang at me. My suspicions and his
signals with his fingers had quite put me on my guard, and I was
prepared. I, too, was on my feet before he gained any advantage,
and, throwing my body forward, I struck him a tremendous blow with
my fist on the forehead. It was a down blow, for I had raised my
arm and brought it down like a hammer, as I was unable to strike
from the shoulder owing to my cramped position; but that blow
dropped him like an ox, and he fell in a heap on the seat.</p>

<p>This little scene had been enacted literally in far less time
than it has taken me to describe it, for it was all a matter of
brief moments. But the other man had risen and seized me by the
throat, and in a hoarse, deep voice, prefacing his remark with a
tremendous oath, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>'It was through you my brother got five years, and, by God, I'm
going to have your blood for it.'</p>

<p>I knew now that it was a struggle for life. During the trial I
learned that the fellow who was convicted had a brother, but we
could get no trace of him, and now this villain and his co-partner
in guilt had trapped me with a view to murdering me&mdash;firstly,
probably, as an act of vengeance; and, secondly, to prevent me
identifying the fellow who was in custody in Liverpool. But, thanks
to the fact of my suspicions having been aroused so early, I was on
my guard, and that had enabled me to stun one of my enemies.
Naturally a powerful man, the desperateness of the situation seemed
to give me additional power, and, swinging myself round with all my
might against my antagonist, I caused him to stagger and almost
lose his balance, which gave me a temporary advantage; but I saw
that he was armed with a revolver, and I realised that he, too, was
a powerful man. By a supreme effort he recovered himself. He had
seized me by the throat with his left hand, and still retained his
grip, digging his finger points into my throat. Putting the
revolver right against my face he pulled the trigger, but the
weapon missed fire. With a deep curse he pulled again, but with my
elbow I managed to strike his arm. The barrel of the pistol was
deflected, and the bullet went through the roof of the carriage.
Before he could fire a third time I got his hand from my throat,
and closed with him, and we both went down on the seat, though,
unfortunately, I was underneath; and he struck me on the head with
the butt end of the revolver until blood gushed over my face.</p>

<p>Putting forth all my strength, I managed to regain my feet, and
tried to get my hands round his throat. He prevented my doing that,
however, but he lost his hold of the pistol&mdash;it fell at my
feet, and I kicked it under the seat. Then we reeled against the
door of the carriage, and the glass of the window was shivered to
atoms, and the blast of cold air that rushed in refreshed and
strengthened me, and, getting my right arm free, I struck my
antagonist full in the face. Then in our fierce struggle we went
down on the seat again, but this time he was under, though he
managed to seize my wrists, and he twisted his legs about me, so
that I was powerless. The same cold blast of air that revived me
had also restored the man I had stunned, and he threw himself on
me.</p>

<p>'Knife the cur!' gasped the man I had down on the seat; 'knife
him, Bill.'</p>

<p>I was beginning to feel slightly faint from the effects of the
blow with the pistol, while the blood had flowed down over my eyes
to such an extent that I could hardly see. But I was determined to
sell my life as dearly as possible, and, releasing my hold of the
prostrate man, I turned and struck Bill twice in the face, first
with my right fist, then with my left. Throwing my body against
him, I knocked him down; then I sprang at the opposite
door&mdash;the right-hand one facing the engine; quick as thought I
let the window down, and tried to reach the communication cord. But
my enemies were too quick for me, though, luckily for me, the
limited space cramped their movements; but the little man, 'Jack,'
as he had called himself, 'Bill,' as his companion had styled him,
flung himself on me and, getting his arm round my throat, tried to
garotte me, but I hurled him with tremendous force against the back
of the carriage. I realised then that the other man was on his
knees on the floor, and I guessed in an instant he was trying to
recover the revolver from under the seat. His head was towards me,
and I dealt him a tremendous blow with my foot that seemed to stun
him. But Bill had recovered himself by this time, and with a snort
like that of a savage animal, he once more threw himself on me, and
we went down together on top of the other man.</p>

<p>For some moments&mdash;they seemed minutes to me, and long
minutes, too&mdash;we writhed, groaned, panted, snorted, twisted,
and wrenched, each with desperate endeavour to gain an advantage.
The train was rushing along at tremendous speed, and the roar that
it made, coupled with the fact that all the windows of the
carriages were closed on account of the intense cold, prevented the
people in the next compartment from hearing anything of the death
struggle that was going on, for truly it was a death struggle. I
knew that these ruffians were bent on taking my life, and in
self-defence I should not hesitate to slay them. If I could but
have recovered the revolver the odds would have been no longer
against me, but it seemed impossible. Bill had now pulled himself
together again and struck me about the face, but his cramped
position prevented his blows being effectual, and with a great
upheaving of my body I threw him off, regained my feet, and
literally jumped on Bill. The other man struggled up, seized me,
and once again we were locked in a deadly embrace. His aim was to
throttle me, but I succeeded in keeping his hands from my throat. I
was conscious, however, that my strength was undoubtedly failing
me, for I must have lost a tremendous quantity of blood, and it had
told upon me, added to the stupendous exertion I had been compelled
to make in order to hold my own. In such moments as these, so long
as the intellect is clear, thoughts flash through the brain with
incredible rapidity, and I realised that my peril was extreme, and
that I was truly face to face with death. All the details of the
scene as I have described them must have been worked out in a space
of time that was under ten minutes, though it seemed an hour or so
to me; but I knew that in something like an hour from London the
train was timed to stop, and as yet there was no diminution of
speed.</p>

<p>So far I had managed to hold my own against the diabolical
ruffians who had deliberately planned my assassination, but that I
had done so was due to my suspicions having been so early aroused,
which had caused me to be on the alert, and also to the fact that
'Bill' was a little, weak, delicate man, who single-handed would
not have had the ghost of a chance against me, for nature had
endowed me with a big frame and great muscular power. Then, again,
the confined space of the compartment had told in my favour, while
to the circumstance of the falling of the revolver I owed my life,
for the big rascal who had tried to blow my brains out had not had
an opportunity of recovering the weapon. Had he done so, there is
no doubt he would have shot me. I knew, of course, that such an
unequal struggle must end in favour of my antagonists. Any one to
realise to the full what my feelings were must go through a similar
experience to that of mine on that fearful Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>Thoughts of those who were near and dear to me rushed through my
brain, and I pictured how bitter and dark would be their Christmas
Day when they learnt that I had been murdered in the train. These
things racked me infinitely more than any personal fear. Indeed, I
may conscientiously say that I had no fear, and yet the situation
was awful enough.</p>

<p>For some moments the big ruffian was placed <i>hors de
combat,</i> so that the struggle was between me and Bill, whom I
was overpowering, but the big fellow recovered himself and began to
rise. With a mighty effort I hurled Bill prostrate into the seat;
then, springing to the door, I turned the handle, opened the door,
and attempted to get out, but one of them caught me by the coat,
and, slipping, I fell with my body half out of the open doorway.
The train was rushing along at a fearful pace, and I so far had my
presence of mind as to grip the footboard; but I knew perfectly
well that my life hung now by a rotten thread, for it seemed
absolutely impossible that any human being could fall from a train
flying along at that pace and not be smashed to pieces. The ground
was white with snow. I noted that, and I heard the grind and roar
of the wheels as they beat the steel rails, and I saw the trees,
and telegraph-posts, and hedgerows as they flew by; but, though I
took in all these things, I nevertheless seemed dazed and
bewildered. My legs were being held. I knew that because I could
not free them, but what the object of the villains was in holding
me I don't know, unless it was that they wished to make sure that I
was dead before they hurled me on to the track.</p>

<p>It seemed to me at this time as if I was dreaming all these
things. I have a perfect and distinct recollection of asking myself
if I was not suffering from a sort of nightmare. As in dreams, so
in the supreme moment when death stares us in the face, an immense
amount is crowded into a brief space. The whole of my past life
flashed, as it were, past my mental eyes; a thousand and one things
were all remembered perfectly distinctly, but all sense of anxiety
had left me, and mentally I began to get mixed up in my ideas; and
gradually there stole upon me a delightful and absolutely ecstatic
sensation of restfulness and repose. Memory was wiped out, and I
fancied that I was flying through space. I no longer heard sounds.
There was silence perfect and unbroken. A delicious, sweet, dreamy
langour had taken possession of me. How long a time it took for me
to experience the varying sensations I have so feebly described I
could not accurately determine. No doubt it might be measured by
seconds, but I only know that to me it appeared to be hours. After
the idea once came to me that I was flying through space, I never
once seemed to lose it until a deep voice sounded in my ear,
saying, 'Do you feel better now?'</p>

<p>That voice broke the spell, and from bliss I suddenly passed to
a condition of pain. Without being able to determine why, I was
seized with an agony of strange anxiety, though in my mind there
was no coherent thought, save it was that I was falling, falling,
and this had the effect of causing me to open my eyes. At first all
before me was a blurred mass, but gradually out of this mass human
beings were evolved, and the first one to become quite distinct to
my gaze was a white-capped, white-aproned woman with, as I thought
in the moment of transition from unconsciousness to consciousness,
an angelic face. I am not sure but what I had a kind of vague, hazy
notion that she was a veritable angel, and that I was really dead.
Gradually, however, the awakening faculties were enabled to give to
the surroundings their proper place and value, and then I realised
that the white-capped woman was a hospital nurse, that a doctor was
standing beside me with his fingers on my pulse, and that my head
was enveloped in surgical bandages, and that the whole of my body
was, as it were, a mass of pain. The doctor who was feeling my
pulse said again in a pleasant, kindly voice&mdash;</p>

<p>'Do you feel better now?'</p>

<p>I turned my eyes to him and saw a genial face, fringed with
silver hair.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I answered, and I was conscious that it cost me an effort
to utter that monosyllable. But, singularly enough, I had no
recollection then of what had happened, and I asked&mdash;</p>

<p>'What is the matter?'</p>

<p>'You shall know in a little while. You had better drink this,
and then go to sleep.'</p>

<p>A cup or glass was placed to my lips, and then ensued a blank.
When I awoke it was Christmas afternoon. The brain had regained its
normal functions, and all that I had passed through came back, and
I remembered every detail up to the moment that I hung out of the
doorway of the railway carriage. From that point I must fill in the
story by the narrative of others. The driver of an up-goods train
had observed me lying motionless in the six-foot way, for it
appears that my body was very conspicuous owing to the snow that
covered the ground. At the next station he reported the
circumstance, and as the spot where I was lying was not far off a
party of men were seat down the line to look for me. I was picked
up in a perfectly unconscious condition; in fact, they all believed
then that I was dead. I was conveyed back to the station and seen
by a local doctor, who pronounced my injuries serious, and as there
was no hospital there he advised that I be sent on to Rugby by a
goods train that passed in half an hour. This was done, and when I
came to my senses it was in one of the wards of the Rugby Hospital.
An analysis of the time proved that I must have been lying in the
six-foot way fully an hour and a half before I was rescued; and had
it not been for the snow the strong probabilities are that I should
not have been seen at all until daylight, but by that time I should
have been frozen to death. At first it was thought to be a case of
suicide, although at the railway station where I was first taken to
they ascertained immediately who I was by my letters, cards, and
papers.</p>

<p>Of course I soon told the story of the outrage, and described my
assailants as well as I could. But it appears that when the train
by which I had travelled drew up at Rugby the broken window of the
compartment attracted attention. The compartment was empty, but its
condition told a terrible, story. There was a bullet hole in the
roof; the cushions and linings were torn and rent; and there seemed
to be blood everywhere. All these things were suggestive of robbery
and murder, and whoever had been in that compartment had probably
got out when the train slackened speed as it came to Rugby. And so
Nemesis got on the track of my would-be murderers, Policemen were
sent out to scour the country, and the telegraph flashed the news
about, and the result was that before I recovered my senses the two
ruffians had been captured. They were found concealed in a hut in a
brickfield not far from the town. The big man was seriously injured
in jumping from the train, for, as was subsequently elicited, I had
broken some of his ribs, and he was weak and faint when he leapt,
the consequence being that he fell heavily, breaking one arm and
dislocating the other shoulder. Bill was more fortunate, but I had
mauled his face, and it was pulpy, bruised, and swollen, and two of
the fingers of his left hand were broken.</p>

<p>Both men were brought into Rugby in charge of the police and
taken to the hospital, and Bill, as his hurts had been dressed, was
transferred to the lockup; but the big fellow, who turned out to be
the brother of the rascal I had sent to penal servitude, was
detained in the hospital, which he was destined never to leave
alive, for three or four weeks later he was attacked by pneumonia,
which had a fatal termination.</p>

<p>It was, as may well be imagined, a sad and bitter Christmas Day
for me, and I felt verily as if I had come through the Valley of
the Shadow of Death. Although I had no bones broken, the wound in
the head gave some trouble, added to the shock and exhaustion, and
it was a fortnight before I was able to get about. The man who had
been in custody in Liverpool had been set at liberty in the absence
of evidence against him. But he had been carefully shadowed, and
when I was ready he was once more pounced upon, and I was able to
swear that he was the man we had so long wanted. Bill, one of my
assailants, turned out to be a notorious character, named William
Straker, who had been twice convicted for felony; and, being put on
trial for the outrage on myself, he was sent into penal servitude
for life.</p>

<p>We were enabled to prove that he and his companion had resolved
to kill me, and when they saw it announced in the papers that I was
going down to Liverpool they considered that no better opportunity
could offer. The plot was an artfully contrived one, but fate was
against them, and in my favour. Their intention was to induce me to
drink some drugged brandy, and then to hurl me out on to the track,
so that it might be thought a case of suicide, or that I had fallen
out while in a state of intoxication. But my refusal to drink the
brandy rather nonplussed them, and through Straker showing his hand
too soon I was warned in time. Nevertheless, I went through a
terrible ordeal on that, to me, ever memorable Christmas Eve, and I
think it will be readily admitted that I am guilty of no
exaggeration in saying that I came verily face to face with
death.</p>

XI. &mdash; THE ABDUCTION</h2>

<p>THE oft-reiterated assertion that history repeats itself is
exemplified every day of our lives; and a recent case of abduction
that has caused considerable sensation throughout the country on
account of the romantic features attending it, no less than for the
very remarkable decision in the Law Courts, recalls to my mind one
with which I had something to do years ago. It has generally been
supposed by all sorts and conditions of people that a man, within
reasonable limits, had full and absolute control over his wife.
This idea, in fact, has been crystallised in the public mind, and
up to a short time ago it is doubtful if any ordinary man or woman
could have been found who would have dared to dispute so
time-honoured a notion. However, we live in a world of change, and
we are constantly being startled by new readings of old laws. One
thing is perfectly obvious&mdash;the recent decision will, so to
speak, revolutionise the relations of man and wife, and the woman
who feels herself aggrieved by her husband may divorce herself from
his bed and board with no more trouble than that occasioned by
walking out of his house. This may be law, but it certainly is not
common sense; indeed, it is an outrage on common sense, nor is it
equity, because it is certain that if a man ventures to leave his
wife in the same way he will very soon be called upon, and that in
a very peremptory fashion too, to contribute towards her
support.</p>

<p>In the case which I am about to narrate it is perfectly certain
that no such interpretation of the law was thought of, or my story
would have had a different ending. The chief characters in the
story are a Mr. Joshua Balgazetty and a lady whose maiden name was
Lucy Arnold Finch. Mr. Balgazetty was a Belgian by birth, but for
many years had been settled in Manchester, and was a naturalised
Englishman, in some respects being more English than many natives
of the soil. At any rate, he believed in the inviolability of the
rights conferred upon a man by matrimony, and, as will presently be
seen, he fought for those rights in a very plucky manner. He was a
partner in an old-established Manchester firm, whose warehouse was
in Moseley Street, not far from St. Peter's Church. Mr. Balgazetty,
being a young man with ample means at his disposal, seems to have
led a somewhat free and easy sort of life up to a certain period.
Not that there was anything against his character; but he was fond
of gaiety, and, as every one knows who has ever been there, if
Manchester is a city of smoke and grime it is by no means lacking
in those resources for distracting the mind from the humdrum cares
of daily toil and duty. A man must be peculiarly constituted if he
cannot find something to his tastes in Manchester. With theatres
and music-halls it has always been well provided, while those whose
likings are more aesthetic will find them gratified in every
way.</p>

<p>In his bachelor days Mr. Balgazetty resided in luxurious
quarters, with a sister, his brother, and mother in Higher
Broughton, and he bore the reputation amongst his neighbours of
being a man of unblemished respectability, although there were
those who described him in vaguer terms as 'a man about town,' not
that that must be taken as reflecting on his honour.</p>

<p>One night during the run of a pantomime at the Theatre Royal,
under the late Mr. John Knowles' régime, Mr. Balgazetty made the
acquaintance of Miss Lucy Arnold Finch. This young lady resided
with her family at Bowdon, then one of the most rural and
charmingly picturesque neighbourhoods of Manchester, but now
vulgarised and ruined by the speculative builder, and country roads
and quiet lanes have given place to streets and alleys of shops and
houses. The Finches claimed to be a superior family of exceedingly
good connections. The family consisted of Mrs. Finch, who was a
widow, Lucy, a younger daughter, and two sons. Lucy, who was about
five and twenty, was the eldest. Her father had been a Manchester
merchant, and had been so successful all his life that he was
enabled to leave a fortune to his family. On the night in question
Mrs. Finch, with her two daughters and a lady friend, had driven in
their carriage from Bowdon to witness the pantomime, and the
coachman was instructed to be waiting at the chief entrance as soon
as the performance was over to take them home again. In the course
of the evening, however, it came on to snow heavily, and coachy,
thinking that he might as well be comfortable while his people were
enjoying themselves in the theatre, took the horse and carriage to
a livery stable out of Peter Street, and then he adjourned to a
hostelry, provided, as most Lancashire taverns are, with a cosy bar
parlour. Here he fell in with some cronies, and became so oblivious
of time and his duties that he allowed himself to be overcome by
various 'goes of something hot,' so that when the family wanted
their carriage it was not forthcoming. I have detailed this little
incident as showing upon what a slender thing a man and a woman's
destiny sometimes hangs. For it was entirely through coachy's
<i>laches</i> that Mr. Balgazetty and Miss Finch became acquainted.
When the performance was over repeated calls for 'Finch's carriage'
failed to produce any results, and the four ladies stood in the
vestibule of the theatre, a pitiable picture of lovely women in
distress. With knightly courtesy Mr. Balgazetty offered his
services if he could be of any use, and under the peculiar
circumstances Mrs. Finch was glad to avail herself of them. As the
last train to Bowdon had departed there were only two
alternatives&mdash;the one was to remain in town all night, or to
procure a carriage to drive back to Bowdon. If they remained Mrs.
Finch was afraid that the other members of her family would be in
terrible distress of mind, thinking some accident had happened, and
so she expressed an anxious desire to return if possible. Thereupon
Mr. Balgazetty gallantly declared that if there was a carriage in
Manchester to be had he would have it, and being well known at a
livery stables in Strangeways he drove in a cab to that quarter,
and was successful in getting a brougham and pair of horses, with a
man, and he returned to the theatre, where the ladies had been
allowed to wait. Of course, they were profuse in thanks to Mr.
Balgazetty for having procured them means of returning to their
home, and he received an invitation to call upon them. Equally, of
course, Mr. Balgazetty availed himself of this permission to go out
to Bowdon the following day to inquire how the ladies were. He was
cordially received, and, being struck with Miss Finch, it was not
long before he paid a second visit, and after that he was
frequently there.</p>

<p>The course of true love never did run smooth, and this case was
no exception. Indeed, one may venture to doubt if on the lad's side
there was true love at all. Or if there was it was destined soon to
change. One thing is clear, the family did not approve of Mr.
Balgazetty's attentions. As was subsequently to be revealed, Mrs.
Finch considered that Balgazetty's social position was not good
enough, and, being somewhat tainted with Puritanical ideas, she
came to the conclusion that his conduct as a young man had not been
ordered with that strict regard for the proprieties which she, from
her point of view, considered imperative. At any rate, when Mr.
Balgazetty made a formal proposal for the hand of Miss Lucy, her
mother emphatically declined to accede to it, and preferred a
request that Mr. Balgazetty would cease his visits. As to continue
them in the face of the opposition of the head of the house was not
expedient, he complied with the request, but as an ardent lover he
was not to be thus deterred from making a bold attempt to win a
bride. And as Miss Finch&mdash;at that time&mdash;was not averse to
his addresses, a clandestine correspondence was carried on. The
young lady, however, seems to have been much afraid of her mother,
and, though she consented to her lover paying his addresses, she
did not hold out any hope that his constancy would be requited. But
he not only persevered, he brought a persuasive eloquence to bear
that seems to have been irresistible, with the result that Miss
Finch consented to marry him secretly on the distinct understanding
that he should leave her at the church door, and not seek to claim
her as his wife until she had in the process of time broken the
news to her mother, and reconciled the lady to the inevitable.
These conditions were freely accepted by Balgazetty, whose ardency
would have prompted him at that period to have committed himself to
still sterner terms.</p>

<p>The marriage was duly solemnised at the Cathedral in a most
unconventional way. There were no bridesmaids, no best man, nor
anything of that kind, only two or three intimate friends of the
bridegroom. As soon as the wedding ceremony was ended Balgazetty
drove his wife in a cab to the Oxford Road Railway Station, where,
having wished him good-bye for the time being, she took the train
to Bowdon, and returned to her home as if nothing unusual had
happened.</p>

<p>Of course there are superstitious people who will say that such
a marriage, carried out in such a hole-and-corner way, could not
fail to be productive of unhappiness. Putting aside altogether a
belief in the undefinable, unhappiness was likely to ensue from the
mere fact that the lady's friends and relatives would come to the
conclusion that their feelings and authority had been set at
naught, and, as a consequence, bitterness could not fail to be
engendered.</p>

<p>A week or two after the marriage, Mr. Balgazetty, finding it a
difficult matter to refrain from holding communication with his
lawfully-wedded wife, decided, with her consent, to go abroad for a
few months. His firm had an agency in Buenos Ayres, and thither he
went. He was absent about fifteen months. For some time he kept up
a pretty regular correspondence with his wife: but at last she
wrote and said it would be advisable to cease the correspondence
for the time, and he consented to this.</p>

<p>On returning to Manchester he lost no time in communicating that
fact to his wife, but she failed to make any response, and two or
three other letters of his were productive of no better result.
Astonished and alarmed, he went over to Bowdon, and succeeded in
obtaining an interview with Mrs. Balgazetty, but to his amazement
she declared that, though she was lawfully his wife, she felt that
she could never be happy with him, and she had resolved never to
live with him. During his absence she had either voluntarily told
her mother of the marriage of that lady had found it out. But,
whichever way it was, Mrs. Finch and all the members of her family
were strongly opposed to the union, and accused
Balgazetty&mdash;most unjustly so, as was proved&mdash;of only
being desirous of obtaining possession of his wife in order to get
her fortune, which was very considerable, and they offered to
settle several hundreds a year upon him on condition of his signing
a bond whereby he would bind himself never to seek to claim his
wife. With indignation and scorn he rejected this, and insisted on
his wife coming to the home he had provided for her. He had taken a
villa in Whalley Range, then a delightful suburb of Manchester, now
much built upon, and had furnished it in a very handsome way, and
he promised his wife that no reasonable wish of hers should remain
unfulfilled. It was all unavailing, however. She was resolute, so
great was the influence of her family over her.</p>

<p>Finding that persuasion had no effect, Mr. Balgazetty resolved
to appeal to the law to recover that which the secular as well as
the ecclesiastical law had given him, and he accordingly sued his
wife for a restitution of conjugal rights, with the inevitable
result then that the lady was ordered to go to her husband's home
and fulfil her duties and obligations as his lawfully-wedded wife.
As she failed to comply with this order of the Court&mdash;setting
it at defiance, in fact&mdash;the injured husband resolved to carry
her off, but found that she had disappeared, and not only did her
relatives resolutely decline to say where she had gone to, but they
taunted him with having been completely outwitted.</p>

<p>It was a singularly cruel position for a man to be placed in,
for though he was married he had none of the comforts and
privileges which are a husband's due. His house was solitary, and
he was the butt for the caustic remarks of thoughtless and witless
people. At this stage of the strange little drama Mr. Balgazetty
applied to me to aid him to recover the fugitive wife, and as I was
greatly interested in the case, I readily took it up, for I could
not help thinking he had been very badly treated.</p>

<p>I found that the Finches were purse-proud people, and
exceedingly selfish to boot. So far as I could learn from
carefully-couched inquiries, they had no definite or distinct
charge to make against Mr. Balgazetty beyond that he had been
guilty of gross deceit in marrying Miss Finch secretly; and as at
that time she did not know her own mind, and had been misled by his
persuasive arguments, he had no right to attempt to force her to
live with him. My view of the case was exactly the reverse of this,
and I was very decidedly of opinion that having gone through the
marriage ceremony the lady was not entitled to change her mind and
say, without any sufficient cause, that 'though you are my husband
I won't live with you.' I therefore set to work to find out where
Mrs. Balgazetty had gone to.</p>

<p>At the very outset of my inquiries I was met with difficulties
of no ordinary kind, for I soon learned that every member of the
family was resolutely opposed to the wife going to her husband, and
her whereabouts was kept a profound secret, none of the servants
being allowed to know it. But the difficulties only served to put
me on my mettle, and having a thorough belief in the righteousness
of the husband's cause, and of the cruelty of the course pursued by
the Finches, I threw myself into the business with enthusiasm, and
was determined to find out the wife's hiding place. For some
considerable time, however, I was completely baffled, so jealously
was the secret guarded. But at length I discovered that at every
week's end some member of the family went away, and this aroused my
suspicions, and one Saturday morning I dot on the track of the
eldest son, and followed him to Blackpool. On his arrival he took a
cab and drove to a large old-fashioned louse, situated close to the
sea, and some short distance out of the town. On that house I set a
watch, and found that the long-sought-for Mrs. Balgazetty was
staying there. I was enabled to identify the lady from her
photograph, which her husband had supplied me with. She had
somewhat altered, but still I had no difficulty in recognising her;
and I learned that she was passing under the name of Miss Fanny
Heathcote, from Liverpool, and was supposed to be staying there for
the benefit of her health. It seemed a foolish piece of deception
to practise, for it could not be kept up indefinitely, and of
course it necessitated a great deal of useless falsehood. What her
views and the views of her family were it is difficult to say; but
probably they thought that Mr. Balgazetty's patience would soon be
worn out, and he would, no doubt, leave the country. But if that
was really their idea they were doomed to be woefully
disappointed.</p>

<p>I lost no time in hurrying back to the husband with the news of
my discovery, and he at once expressed his determination to carry
her forcibly to his house, for he felt sure that it would be
useless to try persuasion with her, for if it failed she would be
at once removed, and more care taken to guard her whereabouts for
the future.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to the carrying out of the little plot, I spent
several days at Blackpool in order that I might learn something
about the lady's habits, and I found that every afternoon she
promenaded pretty regularly at the seashore, and frequently in the
morning came into the town of Blackpool. Our plans were made
accordingly, and Mr. Balgazetty enlisted the services of his
brother and two gentlemen friends. Our idea was that we might carry
the lady off, but some perverse fortune prevented our meeting her
as we had hoped, and so I suggested a subterfuge, which was that a
telegram should be sent from Manchester couched in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p class="telegram">'Mother has been taken very poorly, and though
her illness is not serious she would like you to conic home. You
may do so with safety. Leave by the seven o'clock train this
evening, and I will meet you at Victoria Station. ROBERT.'</p>

<p>Robert was the name of one of her brothers, and I had no doubt
the effect of the telegram would be to bring Mrs. Balgazetty to
Manchester by the train indicated. That particular train had been
chosen because by the time it reached Manchester darkness would
have set in; and of course we wished as much as possible to avoid
anything like a scene on the platform. Confidently anticipating the
lady's arrival, her husband and his friends had a brougham in
waiting at Victoria, and while the others kept in the background,
Mr. Balgazetty was on the lookout, and when the train arrived the
lady was seen, very much to our delight at the success of the ruse,
to put her head out of the window of a first-class compartment,
expecting, of course, to see her brother on the platform. When the
train came to a standstill she opened the door and alighted,
glancing anxiously up and down, and, failing to find the person she
expected to see, she went to the luggage-van to claim a box she
had. At that moment the driver of the brougham, who had been taken
into his master's secret, stepped up to her and said, 'Beg your
pardon, Miss, but are you Miss Fanny Heathcote from Blackpool?'</p>

<p>She seemed a little startled and surprised, and, after some
hesitation, answered&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes, but who has sent you?'</p>

<p>'Oh, it's all right, miss,' replied the man with the air of one
who was not playing a part, 'here's a carriage waiting for you.'
With that he lifted her box and bore it away.</p>

<p>She followed him for a few yards when some misgiving seemed to
take possession of her, and she called to him to stop; but as he
did not heed her, she turned back to the platform in an anxious,
nervous way, as if with an idea of seeking assistance. But by this
time the platform was pretty well deserted, and at that moment her
husband stepped up to her. His appearance was, of course, a
revelation, and, starting back, she uttered a little cry.</p>

<p>'Lucy,' he said in a kindly tone, 'I am your lawful husband, and
it is your duty to accompany me to your home.'</p>

<p>Recognising, no doubt, that she had been trapped, she turned
flurried and excited towards a railway guard who was standing a few
yards off; and seemed as if she was going to appeal to him, when
her husband took her arm and attempted to lead her away, but with
another cry she wrenched herself free; and as the attention of
those about was beginning to be attracted, Mr. Balgazetty seized
her in his arms, and, in spite of her cries, bore her rapidly to
the carriage where his brother and friends were waiting. She
struggled and tried to prevent his putting her into the vehicle,
and had he been without assistance she would, probably, have
succeeded, for he was not a powerful man. As it was, she was thrust
into the carriage with no more force than was absolutely necessary,
and then the brougham was rapidly driven away to Whalley Range.</p>

<p>Mr. Balgazetty's house was an isolated one, not very far from
what was then known as 'Mee's Farm,' and commanding a view of the
Greenhay's Fields. During the journey the lady became very
hysterical, and on arriving at her destination she struggled so
much that she was only got out of the carriage with great
difficulty. Her husband treated her with every possible kindness
and consideration, but she vowed that she would not remain with
him, and the following day she succeeded, by means of a
considerable bribe, in getting one of the servants to take a letter
to the post. That letter was to her mother, and within a very short
time it brought the lady's brother and a number of their friends to
the house with the intention of recovering her and carrying her
off. Mr. Balgazetty, however, had fully prepared himself for this
contingency by laying in a stock of provisions, and he declared
himself ready to stand a siege of any duration. The wife's friends,
being greatly incensed at this unexpected opposition, enlisted a
number of roughs in their service, or perhaps, to be more
charitable, I will suppose that some of the numerous loafers who
are to be found in every community, and who, scenting plunder in
the air, tacked themselves on to the besiegers, and stormed the
house with sticks and stones, with the result that almost every
pane of glass was demolished, but an entrance was not effected, and
the besieged retaliated by drenching the mob with water by means of
large garden squirts and buckets. This, instead of cooling the
ardour of the rabble, incensed them more, and a very violent
attempt was made to obtain entrance into the premises. But, owing
to the means that had been taken to guard against anything of the
kind, the attempt was a failure. For several days, however, the
neighbourhood was kept in a state of intense excitement, and had it
not been for the efforts of the police there is little doubt that
the roughs would have demolished the building. Of course, during
this time the inmates of the house&mdash;which, besides Mrs.
Balgazetty, her husband, his brother, and friends, numbered several
domestics, and two large Newfoundland dogs&mdash;were kept close
prisoners, with the exception that they had access to the
stableyard at the back of the house, and so were enabled to attend
to the horses. The lady's friends had enlisted in their service a
number of men who were charged to watch the premises night and day
in the hope that the garrison would be starved out, and possession
of the lady thus obtained. It seems almost incredible that the
Finches should have displayed so much determination and obstinacy
in a case in which the law was decidedly against them, for the lady
herself had actually set at defiance the order of the Court for a
restitution of conjugal rights. It never occurred to any one, then,
to carry the Hunter to a superior Court, and charge the husband
with breaking the law by abducting his own wife; but I have no
hesitation whatever in saying that had this course been pursued a
verdict in favour of the husband would have been given. Public
sympathy was decidedly in his favour in spite of the demonstrations
made against him by the rough element. The affair, however, ended
in a way that the Finches hardly deemed possible. About a week
after the abduction a policeman brought me a letter. It had been
conveyed to him to give to me by one of the servants, and the
writer was Mr. Balgazetty. The purpose of it was to ask me to have
a cab waiting, at an hour and on a date mentioned, at a certain
spot, and to endeavour to draw off the attention of the watchers
long enough to enable the husband and wife to escape. The hour
chosen was midnight. I was fortunately able to succeed so well that
Mr. and Mrs. Balgazetty passed out through the stableyard, crossed
a field, and succeeded in reaching Moss Lane, where a cab was in
waiting, and they at once drove to an hotel near the Exchange, and
early the following morning proceeded to Liverpool.</p>

<p>It appears that during the week the lady was detained as a
prisoner in her husband's house, her feelings underwent an entire
change, and she became thoroughly reconciled to him, and promised
to go wherever he liked, and the little stratagem I have mentioned
was resorted to to get her away. The disgust and chagrin of her
relatives when they found she had gone may be imagined, for they
had not counted upon her yielding, and it completely nonplussed
them, so they had nothing for it but to submit with what grace they
could. The husband by a bold stroke had got possession of his wife,
and her good sense enabled her to yield to the force of
circumstances. I understand that her mother and her other relatives
never forgave her. When Mrs. Finch was on her death-bed, in spite
of her daughter's entreaties, she refused to see her. Such
obdurateness could only have been the result of wounded vanity and
stupid prejudice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Balgazetty's married life was not a very happy one, though
she had one of the best of husbands. But she was of an unsociable,
taciturn disposition, inclining to melancholy, and five years after
that eventful night when her husband abducted her she followed her
mother to the grave, leaving her husband with three young children.
By a cruel stroke of fate he did not long survive her, for one day
while hunting with the North Cheshire hounds he was thrown from his
horse, and so severely injured that, though he lingered for some
months, the accident resulted in his death.</p>
