<p class="intro">Apart from the names of the protagonists this
story is almost identical with the Vulmea story "Swords of the Red
Brotherhood". The manuscripts of both stories were found in Robert
E. Howard's papers after his death. The order in which he wrote
them is disputed. In his essay "The Trail Of Tranicos" (1967) L.
Sprague de Camp wrote: "There is reason to believe that the pirate
version came before the Conan one." On the other hand, Karl Edward
Wagner, in his introduction to "The Black Stranger" in <i>Echoes of
Valour</i>, claimed: "I have the photocopy of Howard's original
manuscript of 'The Black Stranger', which clearly shows Howard's
efforts to change the story from the Conan to the Black Vulmea
version."</p>

<h2><a id="stranger1" name="stranger1">I. &mdash; THE PAINTED
MEN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ONE moment the glade lay empty; the next, a man
stood poised warily at the edge of the bushes. There had been no
sound to warn the grey squirrels of his coming. But the gay-hued
birds that flitted about in the sunshine of the open space took
fright at his sudden appearance and rose in a clamoring cloud. The
man scowled and glanced quickly back the way he had come, as if
fearing their flight had betrayed his position to some one unseen.
Then he stalked across the glade, placing his feet with care. For
all his massive, muscular build he moved with the supple certitude
of a panther.</p>

<p>He was naked except for a rag twisted about his loins, and his
limbs were criss-crossed with scratches from briars, and caked with
dried mud. A brown- crusted bandage was knotted about his
thickly-muscled left arm. Under his matted black mane his face was
drawn and gaunt, and his eyes burned like the eyes of a wounded
panther. He limped slightly as he followed the dim path that led
across the open space.</p>

<p>Halfway across the glade he stopped short and whirled, catlike,
facing back the way he had come, as a long-drawn call quavered out
across the forest. To another man it would have seemed merely the
howl of a wolf. But this man knew it was no wolf. He was a
Cimmerian and understood the voices of the wilderness as a
city-bred man understands the voices of his friends.</p>

<p>Rage burned redly in his bloodshot eyes as he turned once more
and hurried along the path, which, as it left the glade, ran along
the edge of a dense thicket that rose in a solid clump of greenery
among the trees and bushes. A massive log, deeply embedded in the
grassy earth, paralleled the fringe of the thicket, lying between
it and the path. When the Cimmerian saw this log he halted and
looked back across the glade. To the average eye there were no
signs to show that he had passed; but there was evidence visible to
his wilderness-sharpened eyes, and therefore to the equally keen
eyes of those who pursued him. He snarled silently, the red rage
growing in his eyes&mdash;the berserk fury of a hunted beast which
is ready to turn at bay.</p>

<p>He walked down the trail with comparative carelessness, here and
there crushing a grass-blade beneath his foot. Then, when he had
reached the further end of the great log, he sprang upon it, turned
and ran lightly back along it. The bark had long been worn away by
the elements. He left no sign to show the keenest forest- eyes that
he had doubled on his trail. When he reached the densest point of
the thicket he faded into it like a shadow, with hardly the quiver
of a leaf to mark his passing.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged. The grey squirrels chattered again on the
branches&mdash;then flattened their bodies and were suddenly mute.
Again the glade was invaded. As silently as the first man had
appeared, three other men materialized out of the eastern edge of
the clearing. They were dark-skinned men of short stature, with
thickly-muscled chests and arms. They wore beaded buckskin
loin-cloths, and an eagle's feather was thrust into each black
mane. They were painted in hideous designs, and heavily armed.</p>

<p>They had scanned the glade carefully before showing themselves
in the open, for they moved out of the bushes without hesitation,
in close single file, treading as softly as leopards, and bending
down to stare at the path. They were following the trail of the
Cimmerian, but it was no easy task even for these human
bloodhounds. They moved slowly across the glade, and then one
stiffened, grunted and pointed with his broad-bladed stabbing spear
at a crushed grass-blade where the path entered the forest again.
All halted instantly and their beady black eyes quested the forest
walls. But their quarry was well hidden; they saw nothing to awake
their suspicion, and presently they moved on, more rapidly,
following the faint marks that seemed to indicate their prey was
growing careless through weakness or desperation.</p>

<p>They had just passed the spot where the thicket crowded closest
to the ancient trail when the Cimmerian bounded into the path
behind them and plunged his knife between the shoulders of the last
man. The attack was so quick and unexpected the Pict had no chance
to save himself. The blade was in his heart before he knew he was
in peril. The other two whirled with the instant, steel-trap
quickness of savages, but even as his knife sank home, the
Cimmerian struck a tremendous blow with the war-axe in his right
hand. The second Pict was in the act of turning as the axe fell. It
split his skull to the teeth.</p>

<p>The remaining Pict, a chief by the scarlet tip of his
eagle-feather, came savagely to the attack. He was stabbing at the
Cimmerian's breast even as the killer wrenched his axe from the
dead man's head. The Cimmerian hurled the body against the chief
and followed with an attack as furious and desperate as the charge
of a wounded tiger. The Pict, staggering under the impact of the
corpse against him, made no attempt to parry the dripping axe; the
instinct to slay submerging even the instinct to live, he drove his
spear ferociously at his enemy's broad breast. The Cimmerian had
the advantage of a greater intelligence, and a weapon in each hand.
The hatchet, checking its downward sweep, struck the spear aside,
and the knife in the Cimmerian's left hand ripped upward into the
painted belly.</p>

<p>An awful howl burst from the Pict's lips as he crumpled,
disemboweled&mdash;a cry not of fear or of pain, but of baffled,
bestial fury, the death-screech of a panther. It was answered by a
wild chorus of yells some distance east of the glade. The Cimmerian
started convulsively, wheeled, crouching like a wild thing at bay,
lips asnarl, shaking the sweat from his face. Blood trickled down
his forearm from under the bandage.</p>

<p>With a gasping, incoherent imprecation he turned and fled
westward. He did not pick his way now, but ran with all the speed
of his long legs, calling on the deep and all but inexhaustible
reservoirs of endurance which are Nature's compensation for a
barbaric existence. Behind him for a space the woods were silent,
then a demoniacal howling burst out at the spot he had recently
left, and he knew his pursuers had found the bodies of his victims.
He had no breath for cursing the blood-drops that kept spilling to
the ground from his freshly opened wound, leaving a trail a child
could follow. He had thought that perhaps these three Picts were
all that still pursued him of the war-party which had followed him
for over a hundred miles. But he might have known these human
wolves never quit a blood- trail.</p>

<p>The woods were silent again, and that meant they were racing
after him, marking his path by the betraying blood-drops he could
not check.</p>

<p>A wind out of the west blew against his face, laden with a salty
dampness he recognized. Dully he was amazed. If he was that close
to the sea the long chase had been even longer than he had
realized. But it was nearly over. Even his wolfish vitality was
ebbing under the terrible strain. He gasped for breath and there
was a sharp pain in his side. His legs trembled with weariness and
the lame one ached like the cut of a knife in the tendons each time
he set the foot to earth. He had followed the instincts of the
wilderness which bred him, straining every nerve and sinew,
exhausting every subtlety and artifice to survive. Now in his
extremity he was obeying another instinct, looking for a place to
turn at bay and sell his life at a bloody price.</p>

<p>He did not leave the trail for the tangled depths on either
hand. He knew that it was futile to hope to evade his pursuers now.
He ran on down the trail while the blood pounded louder and louder
in his ears and each breath he drew was a racking, dry- lipped
gulp. Behind him a mad baying broke out, token that they were close
on his heels and expected to overhaul their prey swiftly. They
would come as fleet as starving wolves now, howling at every
leap.</p>

<p>Abruptly he burst from the denseness of the trees and saw, ahead
of him, the ground pitching upward, and the ancient trail winding
up rocky ledges between jagged boulders. All swam before him in a
dizzy red mist, but it was a hill he had come to, a rugged crag
rising abruptly from the forest about its foot. And the dim trail
wound up to a broad ledge near the summit.</p>

<p>That ledge would be as good a place to die as any. He limped up
the trail, going on hands and knees in the steeper places, his
knife between his teeth. He had not yet reached the jutting ledge
when some forty painted savages broke from among the trees, howling
like wolves.</p>

<p>At the sight of their prey their screams rose to a devil's
crescendo, and they raced toward the foot of the crag, loosing
arrows as they came. The shafts showered about the man who doggedly
climbed upward, and one stuck in the calf of his leg. Without
pausing in his climb he tore it out and threw it aside, heedless of
the less accurate missiles which splintered on the rocks about him.
Grimly he hauled himself over the rim of the ledge and turned
about, drawing his hatchet and shifting knife to hand. He lay
glaring down at his pursuers over the rim, only his shock of hair
and blazing eyes visible. His chest heaved as he drank in the air
in great shuddering gasps, and he clenched his teeth against a
tendency toward nausea.</p>

<p>Only a few arrows whistled up at him. The horde knew its prey
was cornered. The warriors came on howling, leaping agilely over
the rocks at the foot of the hill, war-axes in their hand. The
first to reach the crag was a brawny brave whose eagle feather was
stained scarlet as a token of chieftainship. He halted briefly, one
foot on the sloping trail, arrow notched and drawn halfway back,
head thrown back and lips parted for an exultant yell. But the
shaft was never loosed. He froze into motionlessness and the
blood-lust in his black eyes gave way to a look of startled
recognition. With a whoop he gave back, throwing his arms wide to
check the rush of his howling braves. The man crouching on the
ledge above them understood the Pictish tongue, but he was too far
away to catch the significance of the staccato phrases snapped at
the warriors by the crimson-feathered chief.</p>

<p>But all ceased their yelping, and stood mutely staring
up&mdash;not at the man on the ledge, it seemed to him, but at the
hill itself. Then without further hesitation, they unstrung their
bows and thrust them into buckskin cases at their girdles; turned
their backs and trotted across the open space, to melt into the
forest without a backward look.</p>

<p>The Cimmerian glared in amazement. He knew the Pictish nature
too well not to recognize the finality expressed in the departure.
He knew they would not come back. They were heading for their
villages, a hundred miles to the east.</p>

<p>But he could not understand it. What was there about his refuge
that would cause a Pictish war-party to abandon a chase it had
followed so long with all the passion of hungry wolves?</p>

<p>He knew there were sacred places, spots set aside as sanctuaries
by the various clans, and that a fugitive, taking refuge in one of
these sanctuaries, was safe from the clan which raised it. But the
different tribes seldom respected sanctuaries of other tribes; and
the men who had pursued him certainly had no sacred spots of their
own in this region. They were the men of the Eagle, whose villages
lay far to the east, adjoining the country of the Wolf-Picts. It
was the Wolves who had captured him, in a foray against the
Aquilonian settlements along Thunder River, and they had given him
to the Eagles in return for a captured Wolf chief. The Eaglemen had
a red score against the giant Cimmerian, and now it was redder
still, for his escape had cost the life of a noted war- chief. That
was why they had followed him so relentlessly, over broad rivers
and hills and through the long leagues of gloomy forest, the
hunting grounds of hostile tribes. And now the survivors of that
long chase turned back when their enemy was run to earth and
trapped. He shook his head, unable to understand it.</p>

<p>He rose gingerly, dizzy from the long grind, and scarcely able
to realize that it was over. His limbs were stiff, his wounds
ached. He spat dryly and cursed, rubbing his burning, bloodshot
eyes with the back of his thick wrist. He blinked and took stock of
his surroundings. Below him the green wilderness waved and billowed
away and away in a solid mass, and above its western rim a
steel-blue haze he knew hung over the ocean. The wind stirred his
black mane, and the salt tang of the atmosphere revived him. He
expanded his enormous chest and drank it in.</p>

<p>Then he turned stiffly and painfully about, growling at the
twinge in his bleeding calf, and investigated the ledge whereon he
stood. Behind it rose a sheer rocky cliff to the crest of the crag,
some thirty feet above him. A narrow ladder-like stair of
hand-holds had been niched into the rock. And a few feet from its
foot there was a cleft in the wall, wide enough and tall enough for
a man to enter.</p>

<p>He limped to the cleft, peered in, and grunted. The sun, hanging
high above the western forest, slanted into the cleft, revealing a
tunnel-like cavern beyond, and rested a revealing beam on the arch
at which this tunnel ended. In that arch was set a heavy iron-bound
oaken door!</p>

<p>This was amazing. This country was howling wilderness. The
Cimmerian knew that for a thousand miles this western coast ran
bare and uninhabited except by the villages of the ferocious
sea-land tribes, who were even less civilized than their
forest-dwelling brothers.</p>

<p>The nearest outposts of civilization were the frontier
settlements along Thunder River, hundreds of miles to the east. The
Cimmerian knew he was the only white man ever to cross the
wilderness that lay between that river and the coast. Yet that door
was no work of Picts.</p>

<p>Being unexplainable, it was an object of suspicion, and
suspiciously he approached it, ax and knife ready. Then as his
bloodshot eyes became more accustomed to the soft gloom that lurked
on either side of the narrow shaft of sunlight, he noticed
something else&mdash;thick iron-bound chests ranged along the
walls. A blaze of comprehension came into his eyes. He bent over
one, but the lid resisted his efforts. He lifted his hatchet to
shatter the ancient lock, then changed his mind and limped toward
the arched door. His bearing was more confident now, his weapons
hung at his sides. He pushed against the ornately carven door and
it swung inward without resistance.</p>

<p>Then his manner changed again, with lightning-like abruptness;
he recoiled with a startled curse, knife and hatchet flashing as
they leaped to positions of defense. An instant he poised there,
like a statue of fierce menace, craning his massive neck to glare
through the door. It was darker in the large natural chamber into
which he was looking, but a dim glow emanated from the great jewel
which stood on a tiny ivory pedestal in the center of the great
ebony table about which sat those silent shapes whose appearance
had so startled the intruder.</p>

<p>They did not move, they did not turn their heads toward him.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said harshly; 'are you all drunk?'</p>

<p>There was no reply. He was not a man easily abashed, yet now he
felt disconcerted.</p>

<p>'You might offer me a glass of that wine you're swigging,' he
growled, his natural truculence roused by the awkwardness of the
situation. 'By Crom, you show damned poor courtesy to a man who's
been one of your own brotherhood. Are you going to&mdash;' his
voice trailed into silence, and in silence he stood and stared
awhile at those bizarre figures sitting so silently about the great
ebon table.</p>

<p>'They're not drunk,' he muttered presently. 'They're not even
drinking. What devil's game is this?'</p>

<p>He stepped across the threshold and was instantly fighting for
his life against the murderous, unseen fingers that clutched his
throat.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="stranger2" name="stranger2">II. &mdash; MEN FROM THE
SEA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BELESA idly stirred a sea-shell with a daintily
slippered toe, mentally comparing its delicate pink edges to the
first pink haze of dawn that rose over the misty beaches. It was
not dawn now, but the sun was not long up, and the light,
pearl-grey clouds which drifted over the waters had not yet been
dispelled.</p>

<p>Belesa lifted her splendidly shaped head and stared out over a
scene alien and repellent to her, yet drearily familiar in every
detail. From her dainty feet the tawny sands ran to meet the softly
lapping waves which stretched westward to be lost in the blue haze
of the horizon. She was standing on the southern curve of the wide
bay, and south of her the land sloped upward to the low ridge which
formed one horn of that bay. From that ridge, she knew, one could
look southward across the bare waters&mdash;into infinities of
distance as absolute as the view to the westward and to the
northward.</p>

<p>Glancing listlessly landward, she absently scanned the fortress
which had been her home for the past year. Against a vague pearl
and cerulean morning sky floated the golden and scarlet flag of her
house&mdash;an ensign which awakened no enthusiasm in her youthful
bosom, though it had flown trimphantly over many a bloody field in
the far South. She made out the figures of men toiling in the
gardens and fields that huddled near the fort, seeming to shrink
from the gloomy rampart of the forest which fringed the open belt
on the east, stretching north and south as far as she could see.
She feared that forest, and that fear was shared by every one in
that tiny settlement. Nor was it an idle fear&mdash;death lurked in
those whispering depths, death swift and terrible, death slow and
hideous, hidden, painted, tireless, unrelenting.</p>

<p>She sighed and moved listlessly toward the water's edge, with no
set purpose in mind. The dragging days were all of one color, and
the world of cities and courts and gaiety seemed not only thousands
of miles but long ages away. Again she sought in vain for the
reason that had caused a Count of Zingara to flee with his
retainers to this wild coast, a thousand miles from the land that
bore him, exchanging the castle of his ancestors for a hut of
logs.</p>

<p>Her eyes softened at the light patter of small bare feet across
the sands. A young girl came running over the low sandy ridge,
quite naked, her slight body dripping, and her flaxen hair
plastered wetly on her small head. Her wistful eyes were wide with
excitement.</p>

<p>'Lady Belesa!' she cried, rendering the Zingaran words with a
soft Ophirean accent. 'Oh, Lady Belesa!'</p>

<p>Breathless from her scamper, she stammered and made incoherent
gestures with her hands. Belesa smiled and put an arm about the
child, not minding that her silken dress came in contact with the
damp, warm body. In her lonely, isolated life Belesa bestowed the
tenderness of a naturally affectionate nature on the pitiful waif
she had taken away from a brutal master encountered on that long
voyage up from the southern coasts.</p>

<p>'What are you trying to tell me, Tina? Get your breath,
child.'</p>

<p>'A ship!' cried the girl, pointing southward. 'I was swimming in
a pool that the sea-tide left in the sand, on the other side of the
ridge, and I saw it! A ship sailing up out of the south!'</p>

<p>She tugged timidly at Belesa's hand, her slender body all
aquiver, and Belesa felt her own heart beat faster at the mere
thought of an unknown visitor. They had seen no sail since coming
to that barren shore.</p>

<p>Tina flitted ahead of her over the yellow sands, skirting the
tiny pools the outgoing tide had left in shallow depressions. They
mounted the low undulating ridge, and Tina poised there, a slender
white figure against the clearing sky, her wet flaxen hair blowing
about her thin face, a frail quivering arm outstretched.</p>

<p>'Look, my Lady!'</p>

<p>Belesa had already seen it&mdash;a billowing white sail, filled
with the freshening south wind, beating up along the coast, a few
miles from the point. Her heart skipped a beat. A small thing can
loom large in colorless and isolated lives; but Belesa felt a
premonition of strange and violent events. She felt that it was not
by chance that this sail was beating up this lonely coast. There
was no harbor town to the north, though one sailed to the ultimate
shores of ice; and the nearest port to the south was a thousand
miles away. What brought this stranger to lonely Korvela Bay?</p>

<p>Tina pressed close to her mistress, apprehension pinching her
thin features.</p>

<p>'Who can it be, my Lady?' she stammered, the wind whipping color
to her pale cheeks. 'Is it the man the Count fears?'</p>

<p>Belesa looked down at her, her brow shadowed.</p>

<p>'Why do you say that, child? How do you know my uncle fears
anyone?'</p>

<p>'He must,' returned Tina naively, 'or he would never have come
to hide in this lonely spot. Look, my Lady, how fast it comes!'</p>

<p>'We must go and inform my uncle,' murmured Belesa. 'The fishing
boats have not yet gone out, and none of the men have seen that
sail. Get your clothes, Tina. Hurry!'</p>

<p>The child scampered down the low slope to the pool where she had
been bathing when she sighted the craft, and snatched up the
slippers, tunic and girdle she had left lying on the sand. She
skipped back up the ridge, hopping grotesquely as she donned her
scanty garments in mid-flight.</p>

<p>Belesa, anxiously watching the approaching sail, caught her
hand, and they hurried toward the fort.</p>

<p>A few moments after they had entered the gate of the log
palisade which enclosed the building, the strident blare of the
trumpet startled the workers in the gardens, and the men just
opening the boat-house doors to push the fishing boats down their
rollers to the water's edge.</p>

<p>Every man outside the fort dropped his tool or abandoned
whatever he was doing and ran for the stockade without pausing to
look about for the cause of the alarm. The straggling lines of
fleeing men converged on the opened gate, and every head was
twisted over its shoulder to gaze fearfully at the dark line of
woodland to the east. Not one looked seaward.</p>

<p>They thronged through the gate, shouting questions at the
sentries who patrolled the firing-ledges built below the up-jutting
points of the upright palisade logs.</p>

<p>'What is it? Why are we called in? Are the Picts coming?'</p>

<p>For answer one taciturn man-at-arms in worn leathers and rusty
steel pointed southward. From his vantage-point the sail was now
visible. Men began to climb up on the ledges, staring toward the
sea.</p>

<p>On a small lookout tower on the roof of the manor house, which
was built of logs like the other buildings, Count Valenso watched
the on-sweeping sail as it rounded the point of the southern horn.
The Count was a lean, wiry man of medium height and late middle
age. He was dark, somber of expression. Trunk-hose and doublet were
of black silk, the only color about his costume the jewels that
twinkled on his sword hilt, and the wine- colored cloak thrown
carelessly over his shoulder. He twisted his thin black mustache
nervously, and turned his gloomy eyes on his seneschal&mdash;a
leather-featured man in steel and satin.</p>

<p>'What do you make of it, Galbro?'</p>

<p>'A carack,' answered the seneschal. 'It is a carack trimmed and
rigged like a craft of the Barachan pirates&mdash;look there!'</p>

<p>A chorus of cries below them echoed his ejaculation; the ship
had cleared the point and was slanting inward across the bay. And
all saw the flag that suddenly broke forth from the
masthead&mdash;a black flag, with a scarlet skull gleaming in the
sun. The people within the stockade stared wildly at that dread
emblem; then all eyes turned up toward the tower, where the master
of the fort stood somberly, his cloak whipping about him in the
wind.</p>

<p>'It's a Barachan, all right,' grunted Galbro. 'And unless I am
mad, it's Strom's Red Hand. What is he doing on this naked
coast?'</p>

<p>'He can mean no good for us,' growled the Count. A glance below
showed him that the massive gates had been closed, and that the
captain of his men-at-arms, gleaming in steel, was directing his
men to their stations, some to the ledges, some to the tower
loop-holes. He was massing his main strength along the western
wall, in the midst of which was the gate.</p>

<p>Valenso had been followed into exile by a hundred men: soldiers,
vassals and serfs. Of these some forty were men-at-arms, wearing
helmets and suits of mail, armed with swords, axes and crossbows.
The rest were toilers, without armor save for shirts of toughened
leather, but they were brawny stalwarts, and skilled in the use of
their hunting bows, woodsmen's axes, and boar-spears. They took
their places, scowling at their hereditary enemies. The pirates of
the Barachan Isles, a tiny archipelago off the southwestern coast
of Zingara, had preyed on the people of the mainland for more than
a century. The men on the stockade gripped their bows or
boar-spears and stared somberly at the carack which swung inshore,
its brass work flashing in the sun. They could see the figures
swarming on the deck, and hear the lusty yells of the seamen. Steel
twinkled along the rail.</p>

<p>The Count had retired from the tower, shooing his niece and her
eager protegee before him, and having donned helmet and cuirass, he
betook himself to the palisade to direct the defense. His subjects
watched him with moody fatalism. They intended to sell their lives
as dearly as they could, but they had scant hope of victory, in
spite of their strong position. They were oppressed by a conviction
of doom. A year on that naked coast, with the brooding threat of
that devil-haunted forest looming for ever at their backs, had
shadowed their souls with gloomy forebodings. Their women stood
silently in the doorways of their huts, built inside the stockade,
and quieted the clamor of their children.</p>

<p>Belesa and Tina watched eagerly from an upper window in the
manor house, and Belesa felt the child's tense little body all
aquiver within the crook of her protecting arm.</p>

<p>'They will cast anchor near the boat-house,' murmured Belesa.
'Yes! There goes their anchor, a hundred yards offshore. Do not
tremble so, child! They can not take the fort. Perhaps they wish
only fresh water and supplies. Perhaps a storm blew them into these
seas.'</p>

<p>'They are coming ashore in long boats!' exclaimed the child.
'Oh, my Lady, I am afraid! They are big men in armor! Look how the
sun strikes fire from their pikes and burgonets! Will they eat
us?'</p>

<p>Belesa burst into laughter in spite of her apprehension.</p>

<p>'Of course not! Who put that idea into your head?'</p>

<p>'Zingelito told me the Barachans eat women.'</p>

<p>'He was teasing you. The Barachans are cruel, but they are no
worse than the Zingaran renegades who call themselves buccaneers.
Zingelito was a buccaneer once.'</p>

<p>'He was cruel,' muttered the child. 'I'm glad the Picts cut his
head off.'</p>

<p>'Hush, child.' Belesa shuddered slightly. 'You must not speak
that way. Look, the pirates have reached the shore. They line the
beach, and one of them is coming toward the fort. That must be
Strom.'</p>

<p>'Ahoy, the fort there!' came a hail in a voice gusty as the
wind. 'I come under a flag of truce!'</p>

<p>The Count's helmeted head appeared over the points of the
palisade; his stern face, framed in steel, surveyed the pirate
somberly. Strom had halted just within good earshot. He was a big
man, bare- headed, his tawny hair blowing in the wind. Of all the
sea-rovers who haunted the Barachans, none was more famed for
deviltry than he.</p>

<p>'Speak!' commanded Valenso. 'I have scant desire to converse
with one of your breed.'</p>

<p>Strom laughed with his lips, not with his eyes.</p>

<p>'When your galleon escaped me in that squall off the Tralli-bes
last year I never thought to meet you again on the Pictish Coast,
Valenso!' said he. 'Although at the time I wondered what your
destination might be. By Mitra, had I known, I would have followed
you then! I got the start of my life a little while ago when I saw
your scarlet falcon floating over a fortress where I had thought to
see naught but bare beach. You have found it, of course?'</p>

<p>'Found what?' snapped the Count impatiently.</p>

<p>'Don't try to dissemble with me!' The pirate's stormy nature
showed itself momentarily in a flash of impatience. 'I know why you
came here&mdash;and I have come for the same reason. I don't intend
to be balked. Where is your ship?'</p>

<p>'That is none of your affair.'</p>

<p>'You have none,' confidently asserted the pirate. 'I see pieces
of a galleon's masts in that stockade. It must have been wrecked,
somehow, after you landed here. If you'd had a ship you'd have
sailed away with your plunder long ago.'</p>

<p>'What are you talking about, damn you?' yelled the Count. 'My
plunder? Am I a Barachan to burn and loot? Even so, what would I
loot on this naked coast?'</p>

<p>'That which you came to find,' answered the pirate coolly. 'The
same thing I'm after&mdash;and mean to have. But I'll be easy to
deal with&mdash;just give me the loot and I'll go my way and leave
you in peace.'</p>

<p>'You must be mad,' snarled Valenso. 'I came here to find
solitude and seclusion, which I enjoyed until you crawled out of
the sea, you yellow-headed dog. Begone! I did not ask for a parley,
and I weary of this empty talk. Take your rogues and go your
ways.'</p>

<p>'When I go I'll leave that hovel in ashes!' roared the pirate in
a transport of rage. 'For the last time&mdash;will you give me the
loot in return for your lives? I have you hemmed in here, and a
hundred and fifty men ready to cut your throats at my word.'</p>

<p>For answer the Count made a quick gesture with his hand below
the points of the palisade. Almost instantly a shaft hummed
venomously through a loop-hole and splintered on Strom's
breastplate. The pirate yelled ferociously, bounded back and ran
toward the beach, with arrows whistling all about him. His men
roared and came on like a wave, blades gleaming in the sun.</p>

<p>'Curse you, dog!' raved the Count, felling the offending archer
with his iron- clad fist. 'Why did you not strike his throat above
the gorget? Ready with your bows, men&mdash;here they come!'</p>

<p>But Strom had reached his men, checked their headlong rush. The
pirates spread out in a long line that overlapped the extremities
of the western wall, and advanced warily, loosing their shafts as
they came. Their weapon was the longbow, and their archery was
superior to that of the Zingarans. But the latter were protected by
their barrier. The long arrows arched over the stockade and
quivered upright in the earth. One struck the window- sill over
which Belesa watched, wringing a cry of fear from Tina, who cringed
back, her wide eyes fixed on the venomous vibrating shaft.</p>

<p>The Zingarans sent their bolts and hunting arrows in return,
aiming and loosing without undue haste. The women had herded the
children into their huts and now stoically awaited whatever fate
the gods had in store for them. The Barachans were famed for their
furious and headlong style of battling, but they were wary as they
were ferocious, and did not intend to waste their strength vainly
in direct charges against the ramparts. They maintained their
widespread formation, creeping along and taking advantage of every
natural depression and bit of vegetation&mdash;which was not much,
for the ground had been cleared on all sides of the fort against
the threat of Pictish raids.</p>

<p>A few bodies lay prone on the sandy earth, back-pieces glinting
in the sun, quarrel shafts standing up from arm-pit or neck. But
the pirates were quick as cats, always shifting their position, and
were protected by their light armor. Their constant raking fire was
a continual menace to the men in the stockade. Still, it was
evident that as long as the battle remained an exchange of archery,
the advantage must remain with the sheltered Zingarans.</p>

<p>But down at the boat-house on the beach, men were at work with
axes. The Count cursed sulphurously when he saw the havoc they were
making among his boats, which had been built laboriously of planks
sawn out of solid logs.</p>

<p>'They're making a mantlet, curse them!' he raged. 'A sally now,
before they complete it&mdash;while they're scattered&mdash;'
Galbro shook his head, glancing at the bare-armed henchmen with
their clumsy pikes.</p>

<p>'Their arrows would riddle us, and we'd be no match for them in
hand-to-hand fighting. We must keep behind our walls and trust to
our archers.'</p>

<p>'Well enough,' growled Valenso. 'If we can keep them outside our
walls.'</p>

<p>Presently the intention of the pirates became apparent to all,
as a group of some thirty men advanced, pushing before them a great
shield made out of the planks from the boats, and the timbers of
the boat-house itself. They had found an ox-cart, and mounted the
mantlet on the wheels, great solid disks of oak. As they rolled it
ponderously before them it hid them from the sight of the defenders
except for glimpses of their moving feet.</p>

<p>It rolled toward the gate, and the straggling line of archers
converged toward it, shooting as they ran.</p>

<p>'Shoot!' yelled Valenso, going livid. 'Stop them before they
reach the gate!'</p>

<p>A storm of arrows whistled across the palisade, and feathered
themselves harmlessly in the thick wood. A derisive yell answered
the volley. Shafts were finding loop-holes now, as the rest of the
pirates drew nearer, and a soldier reeled and fell from the ledge,
gasping and choking, with a clothyard shaft through his throat.</p>

<p>'Shoot at their feet!' screamed Valenso; and then&mdash;'Forty
men at the gate with pikes and axes! The rest hold the wall!' Bolts
ripped into the sand before the moving shield. A bloodthirsty howl
announced that one had found its target beneath the edge, and a man
staggered into view, cursing and hopping as he strove to withdraw
the quarrel that skewered his foot. In an instant he was feathered
by a dozen hunting arrows.</p>

<p>But, with a deep-throated shout, the mantlet was pushed to the
wall, and a heavy, iron-tipped boom, thrust through an aperture in
the center of the shield, began to thunder on the gate, driven by
arms knotted with brawny muscles and backed with blood-thirsty
fury. The massive gate groaned and staggered, while from the
stockade bolts poured in a steady hail and some struck home. But
the wild men of the sea were afire with the fighting- lust.</p>

<p>With deep shouts they swung the ram, and from all sides the
others closed in, braving the weakened fire from the walls, and
shooting fast and hard.</p>

<p>Cursing like a madman, the Count sprang from the wall and ran to
the gate, drawing his sword. A clump of desperate men- at-arms
closed in behind him, gripping their spears. In another moment the
gate would cave in and they must stop the gap with their living
bodies.</p>

<p>Then a new note entered the clamor of the melee. It was a
trumpet, blaring stridently from the ship. On the cross-trees a
figure waved his arms and gesticulated wildly.</p>

<p>That sound registered on Strom's ears, even as he lent his
strength to the swinging ram. Exerting his mighty thews he resisted
the surge of the other arms, bracing his legs to halt the ram on
its backward swing. He turned his head, sweat dripping from his
face.</p>

<p>'Wait!' he roared. 'Wait, damn you! Listen!'</p>

<p>In the silence that followed that bull's bellow, the blare of
the trumpet was plainly heard, and a voice that shouted something
unintelligible to the people inside the stockade.</p>

<p>But Strom understood, for his voice was lifted again in profane
command. The ram was released, and the mantlet began to recede from
the gate as swiftly as it had advanced.</p>

<p>'Look!' cried Tina at her window, jumping up and down in her
wild excitement. 'They are running! All of them! They are running
to the beach! Look! They have abandoned the shield just out of
range! They are leaping into the boats and rowing for the ship! Oh,
my Lady, have we won?'</p>

<p>'I think not!' Belesa was staring sea-ward. 'Look!'</p>

<p>She threw the curtains aside and leaned from the window. Her
clear young voice rose above the amazed shouts of the defenders,
turned their heads in the direction she pointed. They sent up a
deep yell as they saw another ship swinging majestically around the
southern point. Even as they looked she broke out the royal golden
flag of Zingara.</p>

<p>Strom's pirates were swarming up the sides of their carack,
heaving up the anchor. Before the stranger had progressed halfway
across the bay, the Red Hand was vanishing around the point of the
northern horn.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="stranger3" name="stranger3">III. &mdash; THE COMING OF
THE BLACK MAN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">'OUT, quick!' snapped the Count, tearing at the
bars of the gate. 'Destroy that mantlet before these strangers can
land!'</p>

<p>'But Strom has fled,' expostulated Galbro, 'and yonder ship is
Zingaran.'</p>

<p>'Do as I order!' roared Valenso. 'My enemies are not all
foreigners! Out, dogs! Thirty of you, with axes, and make kindling
wood of that mantlet. Bring the wheels into the stockade.'</p>

<p>Thirty axemen raced down toward the beach, brawny men in
sleeveless tunics, their axes gleaming in the sun. The manner of
their lord had suggested a possibility of peril in that oncoming
ship, and there was panic in their haste. The splintering of the
timbers under their flying axes came plainly to the people inside
the fort, and the axemen were racing back across the sands,
trundling the great oaken wheels with them, before the Zingaran
ship had dropped anchor where the pirate ship had stood.</p>

<p>'Why does not the Count open the gate and go down to meet them?'
wondered Tina. 'Is he afraid that the man he fears might be on that
ship?'</p>

<p>'What do you mean, Tina?' Belesa demanded uneasily. The Count
had never vouchsafed a reason for this self-exile. He was not the
sort of a man to run from an enemy, though he had many. But this
conviction of Tina's was disquieting; almost uncanny.</p>

<p>Tina seemed not to have heard her question.</p>

<p>'The axemen are back in the stockade,' she said. 'The gate is
closed again and barred. The men still keep their places along the
wall. If that ship was chasing Strom, why did it not pursue him?
But it is not a war-ship. It is a carack, like the other. Look, a
boat is coming ashore. I see a man in the bow, wrapped in a dark
cloak.'</p>

<p>The boat having grounded, this man came pacing leisurely up the
sands, followed by three others. He was a tall, wiry man, clad in
black silk and polished steel.</p>

<p>'Halt!' roared the Count. 'I will parley with your leader
alone!'</p>

<p>The taller stranger removed his morion and made a sweeping bow.
His companions halted, drawing their wide cloaks about them, and
behind them the sailors leaned on their oars and stared at the flag
floating over the palisade.</p>

<p>When he came within easy call of the gate: 'Why surely,' said
he, 'there should be no suspicion between gentlemen in these naked
seas!'</p>

<p>Valenso stared at him suspiciously. The stranger was dark, with
a lean, predatory face, and a thin black mustache. A bunch of lace
was gathered at his throat, and there was lace on his wrists.</p>

<p>'I know you,' said Valenso slowly. 'You are Black Zarono, the
buccaneer.'</p>

<p>Again the stranger bowed with stately elegance.</p>

<p>'And none could fail to recognize the red falcon of the
Korzettas!'</p>

<p>'It seems this coast has become the rendezvous of all the rogues
of the southern seas,' growled Valenso. 'What do you wish?'</p>

<p>'Come, come, sir!' remonstrated Zarono. 'This is a churlish
greeting to one who has just rendered you a service. Was not that
Argossean dog, Strom, just thundering at your gate? And did he not
take to his sea-heels when he saw me round the point?'</p>

<p>'True,' grunted the Count grudgingly. 'Though there is little to
choose between a pirate and a renegade.'</p>

<p>Zarono laughed without resentment and twirled his mustache.</p>

<p>'You are blunt in speech, my Lord. But I desire only leave to
anchor in your bay, to let my men hunt for meat and water in your
woods, and perhaps, to drink a glass of wine myself at your
board.'</p>

<p>'I see not how I can stop you,' growled Valenso. 'But understand
this, Zarono: no man of your crew comes within this palisade. If
one approaches closer than a hundred feet, he will presently find
an arrow through his gizzard. And I charge you do no harm to my
gardens or the cattle in the pens. Three steers you may have for
fresh meat, but no more. And we can hold this fort against your
ruffians, in case you think otherwise.'</p>

<p>'You were not holding it very successfully against Strom,' the
buccaneer pointed out with a mocking smile.</p>

<p>'You'll find no wood to build mantlets unless you chop down
trees, or strip it from your own ship,' assured the Count grimly.
'And your men are not Barachan archers; they're no better bowmen
than mine. Besides, what little loot you'd find in this castle
would not be worth the price.'</p>

<p>'Who speaks of loot and warfare?' protested Zarono. 'Nay, my men
are sick to stretch their legs ashore, and nigh to scurvy from
chewing salt pork. I guarantee their good conduct. May they come
ashore?'</p>

<p>Valenso grudgingly signified his consent, and Zarono bowed, a
bit sardonically, and retired with a tread as measured and stately
as if he trod the polished crystal floor of the Kordava royal
court, where indeed, unless rumor lied, he had once been a familiar
figure.</p>

<p>'Let no man leave the stockade,' Valenso ordered Galbro. 'I do
not trust that renegade dog. Because he drove Strom from our gate
is no guarantee that he would not cut our throats.'</p>

<p>Galbro nodded. He was well aware of the enmity which existed
between the pirates and the Zingaran buccaneers. The pirates were
mainly Argossean sailors, turned outlaw; to the ancient feud
between Argos and Zingara was added, in the case of the
freebooters, the rivalry of opposing interests. Both breeds preyed
on the shipping and the coastal towns; and they preyed on one
another with equal rapacity.</p>

<p>So no one stirred from the palisade while the buccaneers came
ashore, dark-faced men in flaming silk and polished steel, with
scarfs bound about their heads and gold hoops in their ears. They
camped on the beach, a hundred and seventy-odd of them, and Valenso
noticed that Zarono posted lookouts on both points. They did not
molest the gardens, and only the three beeves designated by
Valenso, shouting from the palisade, were driven forth and
slaughtered. Fires were kindled on the strand, and a wattled cask
of ale was brought ashore and broached.</p>

<p>Other kegs were filled with water from the spring that rose a
short distance south of the fort, and men began to straggle toward
the woods, crossbows in their hands. Seeing this, Valenso was moved
to shout to Zarono, striding back and forth through the camp:
'Don't let your men go into the forest. Take another steer from the
pens if you haven't enough meat. If they go trampling into the
woods they may fall foul of the Picts.</p>

<p>'Whole tribes of the painted devils live back in the forest. We
beat off an attack shortly after we landed, and since then six of
my men have been murdered in the forest, at one time or another.
There's peace between us just now, but it hangs by a thread. Don't
risk stirring them up.'</p>

<p>Zarono shot a startled glance at the lowering woods, as if he
expected to see hordes of savage figures lurking there. Then he
bowed and said: 'I thank you for the warning, my Lord.' And he
shouted for his men to come back, in a rasping voice that
contrasted strangely with his courtly accents when addressing the
Count.</p>

<p>If Zarono could have penetrated the leafy mask he would have
been more apprehensive, if he could have seen the sinister figure
that lurked there, watching the strangers with inscrutable black
eyes&mdash;a hideously painted warrior, naked but for a doeskin
breech-clout, with a toucan feather drooping over his left ear.</p>

<p>As evening drew on, a thin skim of gray crawled up from the
sea-rim and overcast the sky. The sun sank in a wallow of crimson,
touching the tips of the black waves with blood. Fog crawled out of
the sea and lapped at the feet of the forest, curling about the
stockade in smoky wisps. The fires on the beach shone dull crimson
through the mist, and the singing of the buccaneers seemed deadened
and far away. They had brought old sail-canvas from the carack and
made them shelters along the strand, where beef was still roasting,
and the ale granted them by their captain was doled out
sparingly.</p>

<p>The great gate was shut and barred. Soldiers stolidly tramped
the ledges of the palisade, pike on shoulder, beads of moisture
glistening on their steel caps. They glanced uneasily at the fires
on the beach, stared with greater fixity toward the forest, now a
vague dark line in the crawling fog. The compound lay empty of
life, a bare, darkened space. Candles gleamed feebly through the
crack of the huts, and light streamed from the windows of the
manor. There was silence except for the tread of the sentries, the
drip of water from the eaves, and the distant singing of the
buccaneers.</p>

<p>Some faint echo of this singing penetrated into the great hall
where Valenso sat at wine with his unsolicited guest.</p>

<p>'Your men make merry, sir,' grunted the Count.</p>

<p>'They are glad to feel the sand under their feet again,'
answered Zarono. 'It has been a wearisome voyage&mdash;yes, a long,
stern chase.' He lifted his goblet gallantly to the unresponsive
girl who sat on his host's right, and drank ceremoniously.
Impassive attendants ranged the walls, soldiers with pikes and
helmets, servants in satin coats. Valenso's household in this wild
land was a shadowy reflection of the court he had kept in
Kordava.</p>

<p>The manor house, as he insisted on calling it, was a marvel for
that coast. A hundred men had worked night and day for months
building it. Its log-walled exterior was devoid of ornamentation,
but, within, it was as nearly a copy of Korzetta Castle as was
possible. The logs that composed the walls of the hall were hidden
with heavy silk tapestries, worked in gold. Ship beams, stained and
polished, formed the beams of the lofty ceiling. The floor was
covered with rich carpets. The broad stair that led up from the
hall was likewise carpeted, and its massive balustrade had once
been a galleon's rail.</p>

<p>A fire in the wide stone fireplace dispelled the dampness of the
night. Candles in the great silver candelabrum in the center of the
broad mahogany board lit the hall, throwing long shadows on the
stair. Count Valenso sat at the head of that table, presiding over
a company composed of his niece, his piratical guest, Galbro, and
the captain of the guard. The smallness of the company emphasized
the proportions of the vast board, where fifty guests might have
sat at ease.</p>

<p>'You followed Strom?' asked Valenso. 'You drove him this far
afield?'</p>

<p>'I followed Strom,' laughed Zarono, 'but he was not fleeing from
me. Strom is not the man to flee from anyone. No; he came seeking
for something; something I too desire.'</p>

<p>'What could tempt a pirate or a buccaneer to this naked land?'
muttered Valenso, staring into the sparkling contents of his
goblet.</p>

<p>'What could tempt a count of Kordava?' retorted Zarono, and an
avid light burned an instant in his eyes.</p>

<p>'The rottenness of a royal court might sicken a man of honor,'
remarked Valenso.</p>

<p>'Korzettas of honor have endured its rottenness with
tranquillity for several generations,' said Zarono bluntly. 'My
Lord, indulge my curiosity&mdash;why did you sell your lands, load
your galleon with the furnishings of your castle and sail over the
horizon out of the knowledge of the king and the nobles of Zingara?
And why settle here, when your sword and your name might carve out
a place for you in any civilized land?'</p>

<p>Valenso toyed with the golden seal-chain about his neck.</p>

<p>'As to why I left Zingara,' he said, 'that is my own affair. But
it was chance that left me stranded here. I had brought all my
people ashore, and much of the furnishings you mentioned, intending
to build a temporary habitation. But my ship, anchored out there in
the bay, was driven against the cliffs of the north point and
wrecked by a sudden storm out of the west. Such storms are common
enough at certain times of the year. After that there was naught to
do but remain and make the best of it.'</p>

<p>'Then you would return to civilization, if you could?'</p>

<p>'Not to Kordava. But perhaps to some far clime&mdash;to Vendhya,
or Khitai&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Do you not find it tedious here, my Lady?' asked Zarono, for
the first time addressing himself directly to Belesa.</p>

<p>Hunger to see a new face and hear a new voice had brought the
girl to the great hall that night. But now she wished she had
remained in her chamber with Tina. There was no mistaking the
meaning in the glance Zarono turned on her. His speech was decorous
and formal, his expression sober and respectful; but it was but a
mask through which gleamed the violent and sinister spirit of the
man. He could not keep the burning desire out of his eyes when he
looked at the aristocratic young beauty in her low-necked satin
gown and jeweled girdle.</p>

<p>'There is little diversity here,' she answered in a low
voice.</p>

<p>'If you had a ship,' Zarono bluntly asked his host, 'you would
abandon this settlement?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' admitted the Count.</p>

<p>'I have a ship,' said Zarono. 'If we could reach an
agreement&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What sort of an agreement?' Valenso lifted his head to stare
suspiciously at his guest.</p>

<p>'Share and share alike,' said Zarono, laying his hand on the
board with the fingers spread wide. The gesture was curiously
reminiscent of a great spider. But the fingers quivered with
curious tension, and the buccaneer's eyes burned with a new
light.</p>

<p>'Share what?' Valenso stared at him in evident bewilderment.
'The gold I brought with me went down in my ship, and unlike the
broken timbers, it did not wash ashore.'</p>

<p>'Not that!' Zarono made an impatient gesture. 'Let us be frank,
my Lord. Can you pretend it was chance which caused you to land at
this particular spot, with a thousand miles of coast from which to
choose?'</p>

<p>'There is no need for me to pretend,' answered Valenso coldly.
'My ship's master was one Zingelito, formerly a buccaneer. He had
sailed this coast, and persuaded me to land here, telling me he had
a reason he would later disclose. But this reason he never
divulged, because the day after we landed he disappeared into the
woods, and his headless body was found later by a hunting party.
Obviously he was ambushed and slain by the Picts.'</p>

<p>Zarono stared fixedly at Valenso for a space.</p>

<p>'Sink me,' quoth he at last, 'I believe you, my Lord. A Korzetta
has no skill at lying, regardless of his other accomplishments. And
I will make you a proposal. I will admit when I anchored out there
in the bay I had other plans in mind. Supposing you to have already
secured the treasure, I meant to take this fort by strategy and cut
all your throats. But circumstances have caused me to change my
mind&mdash;' He cast a glance at Belesa that brought the color into
her face, and made her lift her head indignantly.</p>

<p>'I have a ship to carry you out of exile,' said the buccaneer,
'with your household and such of your retainers as you shall
choose. The rest can fend for themselves.'</p>

<p>The attendants along the walls shot uneasy glances sidelong at
each other. Zarono went on, too brutally cynical to conceal his
intentions.</p>

<p>'But first you must help me secure the treasure for which I've
sailed a thousand miles.'</p>

<p>'What treasure, in Mitra's name?' demanded the Count angrily.
'You are yammering like that dog Strom, now.'</p>

<p>'Did you ever hear of Bloody Tranicos, the greatest of the
Barachan pirates?' asked Zarono.</p>

<p>'Who has not? It was he who stormed the island castle of the
exiled prince Tothmekri of Stygia, put the people to the sword and
bore off the treasure the prince had brought with him when he fled
from Khemi.'</p>

<p>'Aye! And the tale of that treasure brought the men of the Red
Brotherhood swarming like vultures after carrion&mdash;pirates,
buccaneers, even the black corsairs from the South. Fearing
betrayal by his captains, he fled northward with one ship, and
vanished from the knowledge of men. That was nearly a hundred years
ago.</p>

<p>'But the tale persists that one man survived that last voyage,
and returned to the Barachans, only to be captured by a Zingaran
war-ship. Before he was hanged he told his story and drew a map in
his own blood, on parchment, which he smuggled somehow out of his
captor's reach. This was the tale he told: Tranicos had sailed far
beyond the paths of shipping, until he came to a bay on a lonely
coast, and there he anchored. He went ashore, taking his treasure
and eleven of his most trusted captains who had accompanied him on
his ship. Following his orders, the ship sailed away, to return in
a week's time, and pick up their admiral and his captains. In the
meantime Tranicos meant to hide the treasure somewhere in the
vicinity of the bay. The ship returned at the appointed time, but
there was no trace of Tranicos and his eleven captains, except the
rude dwelling they had built on the beach.</p>

<p>'This had been demolished, and there were tracks of naked feet
about it, but no sign to show there had been any fighting. Nor was
there any trace of the treasure, or any sign to show where it was
hidden. The pirates plunged into the forest to search for their
chief and his captains, but were attacked by wild Picts and driven
back to their ship. In despair they heaved anchor and sailed away,
but before they raised the Barachans, a terrific storm wrecked the
ship and only that one man survived.</p>

<p>'That is the tale of the Treasure of Tranicos, which men have
sought in vain for nearly a century. That the map exists is known,
but its whereabouts have remained a mystery.</p>

<p>'I have had one glimpse of that map. Strom and Zingelito were
with me, and a Nemedian who sailed with the Barachans. We looked
upon it in a hovel in a certain Zingaran sea-port town, where we
were skulking in disguise. Somebody knocked over the lamp, and
somebody howled in the dark, and when we got the light on again,
the old miser who owned the map was dead with a dirk in his heart,
and the map was gone, and the night-watch was clattering down the
street with their pikes to investigate the clamor. We scattered,
and each went his own way.</p>

<p>'For years thereafter Strom and I watched one another, each
supposing the other had the map. Well, as it turned out, neither
had it, but recently word came to me that Strom had departed
northward, so I followed him. You saw the end of that chase.</p>

<p>'I had but a glimpse at the map as it lay on the old miser's
table, and could tell nothing about it. But Strom's actions show
that he knows this is the bay where Tranicos anchored. I believe
that they hid the treasure somewhere in that forest and returning,
were attacked and slain by the Picts. The Picts did not get the
treasure. Men have traded up and down this coast a little, knowing
nothing of the treasure, and no gold ornament or rare jewel has
ever been seen in the possession of the coastal tribes.</p>

<p>'This is my proposal: let us combine our forces. Strom is
somewhere within striking distance. He fled because he feared to be
pinned between us, but he will return. But allied, we can laugh at
him. We can work out from the fort, leaving enough men here to hold
it if he attacks. I believe the treasure is hidden near by. Twelve
men could not have conveyed it far. We will find it, load it in my
ship, and sail for some foreign port where I can cover my past with
gold. I am sick of this life. I want to go back to a civilized
land, and live like a noble, with riches, and slaves, and a
castle&mdash;and a wife of noble blood.'</p>

<p>'Well?' demanded the Count, slit-eyed with suspicion.</p>

<p>'Give me your niece for my wife,' demanded the buccaneer
bluntly.</p>

<p>Belesa cried out sharply and started to her feet. Valenso
likewise rose, livid, his fingers knotting convulsively about his
goblet as if he contemplated hurling it at his guest. Zarono did
not move; he sat still, one arm on the table and the fingers hooked
like talons. His eyes smoldered with passion, and a deep
menace.</p>

<p>'You dare!' ejaculated Valenso.</p>

<p>'You seem to forget you have fallen from your high estate, Count
Valenso,' growled Zarono. 'We are not at the Kordavan court, my
Lord. On this naked coast nobility is measured by the power of men
and arms. And there I rank you. Strangers tread Korzetta Castle,
and the Korzetta fortune is at the bottom of the sea. You will die
here, an exile, unless I give you the use of my ship.</p>

<p>'You will have no cause to regret the union of our houses. With
a new name and a new fortune you will find that Black Zarono can
take his place among the aristocrats of the world and make a
son-in-law of which not even a Korzetta need be ashamed.'</p>

<p>'You are mad to think of it!' exclaimed the Count violently.
'You&mdash;who is that?'</p>

<p>A patter of soft-slippered feet distracted his attention. Tina
came hurriedly into the hall, hesitated when she saw the Count's
eyes fixed angrily on her, curtsied deeply, and sidled around the
table to thrust her small hands into Belesa's fingers. She was
panting slightly, her slippers were damp, and her flaxen hair was
plastered down on her head.</p>

<p>'Tina!' exclaimed Belesa anxiously. 'Where have you been? I
thought you were in your chamber, hours ago.'</p>

<p>'I was,' answered the child breathlessly, 'but I missed my coral
necklace you gave me&mdash;' She held it up, a trivial trinket, but
prized beyond all her other possessions because it had been
Belesa's first gift to her. 'I was afraid you wouldn't let me go if
you knew&mdash;a soldier's wife helped me out of the stockade and
back again&mdash;please, my Lady, don't make me tell who she was,
because I promised not to. I found my necklace by the pool where I
bathed this morning. Please punish me if I have done wrong.'</p>

<p>'Tina!' groaned Belesa, clasping the child to her. 'I'm not
going to punish you. But you should not have gone outside the
palisade, with these buccaneers camped on the beach, and always a
chance of Picts skulking about. Let me take you to your chamber and
change these damp clothes&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, my Lady,' murmured Tina, 'but first let me tell you about
the black man&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What?' The startling interruption was a cry that burst from
Valenso's lips. His goblet clattered to the floor as he caught the
table with both hands. If a thunderbolt had struck him, the lord of
the castle's bearing could not have been more subtly or
horrifyingly altered. His face was livid, his eyes almost starting
from his head.</p>

<p>'What did you say?' he panted, glaring wildly at the child who
shrank back against Belesa in bewilderment. 'What did you say,
wench?'</p>

<p>'A black man, my Lord,' she stammered, while Belesa, Zarono and
the attendants stared at him in amazement. 'When I went down to the
pool to get my necklace, I saw him. There was a strange moaning in
the wind, and the sea whimpered like a thing in fear, and then he
came. I was afraid, and hid behind a little ridge of sand. He came
from the sea in a strange black boat with blue fire playing all
about it, but there was no torch. He drew his boat up on the sands
below the south point, and strode toward the forest, looking like a
giant in the fog&mdash;a great, tall man, black like a
Kushite&mdash;'</p>

<p>Valenso reeled as if he had received a mortal blow. He clutched
at his throat, snapping the golden chain in his violence. With the
face of a madman he lurched about the table and tore the child
screaming from Belesa's arms.</p>

<p>'You little slut,' he panted. 'You lie! You have heard me
mumbling in my sleep and have told this lie to torment me! Say you
lie before I tear the skin from your back!'</p>

<p>'Uncle!' cried Belesa, in outraged bewilderment, trying to free
Tina from his grasp. 'Are you mad? What are you about?'</p>

<p>With a snarl he tore her hand from his arm and spun her
staggering into the arms of Galbro who received her with a leer he
made little effort to disguise.</p>

<p>'Mercy, my Lord!' sobbed Tina. 'I did not lie!'</p>

<p>'I said you lied!' roared Valenso. 'Gebbrelo!'</p>

<p>The stolid serving man seized the trembling youngster and
stripped her with one brutal wrench that tore her scanty garments
from her body. Wheeling, he drew her slender arms over his
shoulders, lifting her writhing feet clear of the floor.</p>

<p>'Uncle! shrieked Belesa, writhing vainly in Galbro's lustful
grasp. 'You are mad! You can not&mdash;oh, you can not&mdash;!' The
voice choked in her throat as Valenso caught up a jewel-hilted
riding whip and brought it down across the child's frail body with
a savage force that left a red weal across her naked shoulders.</p>

<p>Belesa moaned, sick with the anguish in Tina's shriek. The world
had suddenly gone mad. As in a nightmare she saw the stolid faces
of the soldiers and servants, beast-faces, the faces of oxen,
reflecting neither pity nor sympathy. Zarono's faintly sneering
face was part of the nightmare. Nothing in that crimson haze was
real except Tina's naked white body, crisscrossed with red welts
from shoulders to knees; no sound real except the child's sharp
cries of agony, and the panting gasps of Valenso as he lashed away
with the staring eyes of a madman, shrieking: 'You lie! You lie!
Curse you, you lie! Admit your guilt, or I will flay your stubborn
body! He could not have followed me here&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, have mercy, my Lord!' screamed the child, writhing vainly
on the brawny servant's back, too frantic with fear and pain to
have the wit to save herself by a lie. Blood trickled in crimson
beads down her quivering thighs. 'I saw him! I do not lie! Mercy!
Please! Ahhhh!'</p>

<p>'You fool! You fool!' screamed Belesa, almost beside herself.
'Do you not see she is telling the truth? Oh, you beast! Beast!
Beast!'</p>

<p>Suddenly some shred of sanity seemed to return to the brain of
Count Valenso Korzetta. Dropping the whip he reeled back and fell
up against the table, clutching blindly at its edge. He shook as
with an ague. His hair was plastered across his brow in dank
strands, and sweat dripped from his livid countenance which was
like a carven mask of Fear. Tina, released by Gebbrelo, slipped to
the floor in a whimpering heap. Belesa tore free from Galbro,
rushed to her, sobbing, and fell on her knees, gathering the
pitiful waif into her arms. She lifted a terrible face to her
uncle, to pour upon him the full vials of her wrath&mdash;but he
was not looking at her. He seemed to have forgotten both her and
his victim. In a daze of incredulity, she heard him say to the
buccaneer: 'I accept your offer, Zarono; in Mitra's name, let us
find this accursed treasure and begone from this damned coast!'</p>

<p>At this the fire of her fury sank to sick ashes. In stunned
silence she lifted the sobbing child in her arms and carried her up
the stair. A glance backward showed Valenso crouching rather than
sitting at the table, gulping wine from a huge goblet he gripped in
both shaking hands, while Zarono towered over him like a somber
predatory bird&mdash;puzzled at the turn of events, but quick to
take advantage of the shocking change that had come over the Count.
He was talking in a low, decisive voice, and Valenso nodded mute
agreement, like one who scarcely heeds what is being said. Galbro
stood back in the shadows, chin pinched between forefinger and
thumb, and the attendants along the walls glanced furtively at each
other, bewildered by their lord's collapse.</p>

<p>Up in her chamber Belesa laid the half-fainting girl on the bed
and set herself to wash and apply soothing ointments to the weals
and cuts on her tender skin. Tina gave herself up in complete
submission to her mistress's hands, moaning faintly. Belesa felt as
if her world had fallen about her ears. She was sick and
bewildered, overwrought, her nerves quivering from the brutal shock
of what she had witnessed. Fear of and hatred for her uncle grew in
her soul. She had never loved him; he was harsh and apparently
without natural affection, grasping and avid. But she had
considered him just, and fearless. Revulsion shook her at the
memory of his staring eyes and bloodless face. It was some terrible
fear which had roused this frenzy; and because of this fear Valenso
had brutalized the only creature she had to love and cherish;
because of that fear he was selling her, his niece, to an infamous
outlaw. What was behind this madness? Who was the black man Tina
had seen?</p>

<p>The child muttered in semi-delirium.</p>

<p>'I did not lie, my Lady! Indeed I did not! It was a black man,
in a black boat that burned like blue fire on the water! A tall
man, black as a negro, and wrapped in a black cloak! I was afraid
when I saw him, and my blood ran cold. He left his boat on the
sands and went into the forest. Why did the Count whip me for
seeing him?'</p>

<p>'Hush, Tina,' soothed Belesa. 'Lie quiet. The smarting will soon
pass.'</p>

<p>The door opened behind her and she whirled, snatching up a
jeweled dagger. The Count stood in the door, and her flesh crawled
at the sight. He looked years older; his face was grey and drawn,
and his eyes stared in a way that roused fear in her bosom. She had
never been close to him; now she felt as though a gulf separated
them. He was not her uncle who stood there, but a stranger come to
menace her.</p>

<p>She lifted the dagger.</p>

<p>'If you touch her again,' she whispered from dry lips, 'I swear
before Mitra I will sink this blade in your breast.' He did not
heed her.</p>

<p>'I have posted a strong guard about the manor,' he said. 'Zarono
brings his men into the stockade tomorrow. He will not sail until
he has found the treasure. When he finds it we shall sail at once
for some port not yet decided upon.'</p>

<p>'And you will sell me to him?' she whispered. 'In Mitra's
name&mdash;'</p>

<p>He fixed upon her a gloomy gaze in which all considerations but
his own self-interest had been crowded out. She shrank before it,
seeing in it the frantic cruelty that possessed the man in his
mysterious fear.</p>

<p>'You will do as I command,' he said presently, with no more
human feeling in his voice than there is in the ring of flint on
steel. And turning, he left the chamber. Blinded by a sudden rush
of horror, Belesa fell fainting beside the couch where Tina
lay.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="stranger4" name="stranger4">IV. &mdash; A BLACK DRUM
DRONING</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BELESA never knew how long she lay crushed and
senseless. She was first aware of Tina's arms about her and the
sobbing of the child in her ear. Mechanically she straightened
herself and drew the girl into her arms; and she sat there,
dry-eyed, staring unseeingly at the flickering candle. There was no
sound in the castle. The singing of the buccaneers on the strand
had ceased. Dully, almost impersonally she reviewed her
problem.</p>

<p>Valenso was mad, driven frantic by the story of the mysterious
black man. It was to escape this stranger that he wished to abandon
the settlement and flee with Zarono. That much was obvious. Equally
obvious was the fact that he was ready to sacrifice her in exchange
for that opportunity to escape. In the blackness of spirit which
surrounded her she saw no glint of light. The serving men were dull
or callous brutes, their women stupid and apathetic. They would
neither dare nor care to help her. She was utterly helpless.</p>

<p>Tina lifted her tear-stained face as if she were listening to
the prompting of some inner voice. The child's understanding of
Belesa's inmost thoughts was almost uncanny, as was her recognition
of the inexorable drive of Fate and the only alternative left to
the weak.</p>

<p>'We must go, my Lady!' she whispered. 'Zarono shall not have
you. Let us go far away into the forest. We shall go until we can
go no further, and then we shall lie down and die together.'</p>

<p>The tragic strength that is the last refuge of the weak entered
Belesa's soul. It was the only escape from the shadows that had
been closing in upon her since that day when they fled from
Zingara.</p>

<p>'We shall go, child.'</p>

<p>She rose and was fumbling for a cloak, when an exclamation from
Tina brought her about. The girl was on her feet, a finger pressed
to her lips, her eyes wide and bright with terror.</p>

<p>'What is it, Tina?' The child's expression of fright induced
Belesa to pitch her voice to a whisper, and a nameless apprehension
crawled over her.</p>

<p>'Someone outside in the hall,' whispered Tina, clutching her arm
convulsively. 'He stopped at our door, and then went on, toward the
Count's chamber at the other end.'</p>

<p>'Your ears are keener than mine,' murmured Belesa. 'But there is
nothing strange in that. It was the Count himself, perchance, or
Galbro.'</p>

<p>She moved to open the door, but Tina threw her arms frantically
about her neck, and Belesa felt the wild beating of her heart.</p>

<p>'No, no, my Lady! Do not open the door! I am afraid! I do not
know why, but I feel that some evil thing is skulking near us!'</p>

<p>Impressed, Belesa patted her reassuringly, and reached a hand
toward the gold disk that masked the tiny peep-hole in the center
of the door.</p>

<p>'He is coming back!' shivered the girl. 'I hear him!'</p>

<p>Belesa heard something too&mdash;a curious stealthy pad which
she knew, with a chill of nameless fear, was not the step of anyone
she knew. Nor was it the step of Zarono, or any booted man. Could
it be the buccaneer gliding along the hallway on bare, stealthy
feet, to slay his host while he slept? She remembered the soldiers
who would be on guard below. If the buccaneer had remained in the
manor for the night, a man-at-arms would be posted before his
chamber door. But who was that sneaking along the corridor? None
slept upstairs besides herself, Tina and the Count, except
Galbro.</p>

<p>With a quick motion she extinguished the candle so it would not
shine through the hole in the door, and pushed aside the gold disk.
All the lights were out in the hall, which was ordinarily lighted
by candles. Someone was moving along the darkened corridor. She
sensed rather than saw a dim bulk moving past her doorway, but she
could make nothing of its shape except that it was man-like. But a
chill wave of terror swept over her; so she crouched dumb,
incapable of the scream that froze behind her lips. It was not such
terror as her uncle now inspired in her, or fear like her fear of
Zarono, or even of the brooding forest. It was blind unreasoning
terror that laid an icy hand on her soul and froze her tongue to
her palate.</p>

<p>The figure passed on to the stairhead, where it was limned
momentarily against the faint glow that came up from below, and at
the glimpse of that vague black image against the red, she almost
fainted. She crouched there in the darkness, awaiting the outcry
that would announce that the soldiers in the great hall had seen
the intruder. But the manor remained silent; somewhere a wind
wailed shrilly. That was all.</p>

<p>Belesa's hands were moist with perspiration as she groped to
relight the candle. She was still shaken with horror, though she
could not decide just what there had been about that black figure
etched against the red glow that had roused this frantic loathing
in her soul. It was man-like in shape, but the outline was
strangely alien&mdash;abnormal&mdash;though she could not clearly
define that abnormality. But she knew that it was no human being
that she had seen, and she knew that the sight had robbed her of
all her new-found resolution. She was demoralized, incapable of
action.</p>

<p>The candle flared up, limning Tina's white face in the yellow
glow.</p>

<p>'It was the black man!' whispered Tina. 'I know! My blood turned
cold, just as it did when I saw him on the beach. There are
soldiers downstairs; why did they not see him? Shall we go and
inform the Count?'</p>

<p>Belesa shook her head. She did not care to repeat the scene that
had ensued upon Tina's first mention of the black man. At any
event, she dared not venture out into that darkened hallway.</p>

<p>'We dare not go into the forest!' shuddered Tina. 'He will be
lurking there&mdash;'</p>

<p>Belesa did not ask the girl how she knew the black man would be
in the forest; it was the logical hiding-place for any evil thing,
man or devil. And she knew Tina was right; they dared not leave the
fort now. Her determination, which had not faltered at the prospect
of certain death, gave way at the thought of traversing those
gloomy woods with that black shambling creature at large among
them. Helplessly she sat down and sank her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Tina slept, presently, on the couch, whimpering occasionally in
her sleep. Tears sparkled on her long lashes. She moved her
smarting body uneasily in her restless slumber. Toward dawn Belesa
was aware of a stifling quality in the atmosphere. She heard a low
rumble of thunder somewhere off to sea-ward. Extinguishing the
candle, which had burned to its socket, she went to a window whence
she could see both the ocean and a belt of the forest behind the
fort.</p>

<p>The fog had disappeared, but out to sea a dusky mass was rising
from the horizon. From it lightning flickered and the low thunder
growled. An answering rumble came from the black woods. Startled,
she turned and stared at the forest, a brooding black rampart. A
strange rhythmic pulsing came to her ears&mdash;a droning
reverberation that was not the roll of a Pictish drum.</p>

<p>'The drum!' sobbed Tina, spasmodically opening and closing her
fingers in her sleep. 'The black man&mdash;beating on a black
drum&mdash;in the black woods! Oh, save us&mdash;!'</p>

<p>Belesa shuddered. Along the eastern horizon ran a thin white
line that presaged dawn. But that black cloud on the western rim
writhed and billowed, swelling and expanding. She stared in
amazement, for storms were practically unknown on that coast at
that time of the year, and she had never seen a cloud like that
one.</p>

<p>It came pouring up over the world-rim in great boiling masses of
blackness, veined with fire. It rolled and billowed with the wind
in its belly. Its thundering made the air vibrate. And another
sound mingled awesomely with the reverberations of the
thunder&mdash;the voice of the wind, that raced before its coming.
The inky horizon was torn and convulsed in the lightning flashes;
afar to sea she saw the white-capped waves racing before the wind.
She heard its droning roar, increasing in volume as it swept
shoreward. But as yet no wind stirred on the land. The air was hot,
breathless. There was a sensation of unreality about the contrast:
out there wind and thunder and chaos sweeping inland; but here
stifling stillness. Somewhere below her a shutter slammed,
startling in the tense silence, and a woman's voice was lifted,
shrill with alarm. But most of the people of the fort seemed
sleeping, unaware of the oncoming hurricane.</p>

<p>She realized that she still heard that mysterious droning
drum-beat and she stared toward the black forest, her flesh
crawling. She could see nothing, but some obscure instinct or
intuition prompted her to visualize a black hideous figure
squatting under black branches and enacting a nameless incantation
on something that sounded like a drum&mdash;</p>

<p>Desperately she shook off the ghoulish conviction, and looked
sea-ward, as a blaze of lightning fairly split the sky. Outlined
against its glare she saw the masts of Zarono's ship; she saw the
tents of the buccaneers on the beach, the sandy ridges of the south
point and the rock cliffs of the north point as plainly as by
midday sun. Louder and louder rose the roar of the wind, and now
the manor was awake. Feet came pounding up the stair, and Zarono's
voice yelled, edged with fright.</p>

<p>Doors slammed and Valenso answered him, shouting to be heard
above the roar of the elements.</p>

<p>'Why didn't you warn me of a storm from the west?' howled the
buccaneer. 'If the anchors don't hold&mdash;'</p>

<p>'A storm never came from the west before, at this time of year!'
shrieked Valenso, rushing from his chamber in his nightshirt, his
face livid and his hair standing stiffly on end. 'This is the work
of&mdash;' His words were drowned as he raced madly up the ladder
that led to the lookout tower, followed by the swearing
buccaneer.</p>

<p>Belesa crouched at her window, awed and deafened. Louder and
louder rose the wind, until it drowned all other sound&mdash;all
except that maddening droning that now rose like an inhuman chant
of triumph. It roared inshore, driving before it a foaming
league-long crest of white&mdash;and then all hell and destruction
was loosed on that coast. Rain fell in driving torrents, sweeping
the beaches with blind frenzy. The wind hit like a thunder-clap,
making the timbers of the fort quiver. The surf roared over the
sands, drowning the coals of the fires the seamen had built. In the
glare of lightning Belesa saw, through the curtain of the slashing
rain, the tents of the buccaneers whipped to ribbons and washed
away, saw the men themselves staggering toward the fort, beaten
almost to the sands by the fury of torrent and blast.</p>

<p>And limned against the blue glare she saw Zarono's ship, ripped
loose from her moorings, driven headlong against the jagged cliffs
that jutted up to receive her....</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="stranger5" name="stranger5">V. &mdash; A MAN FROM THE
WILDERNESS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE storm had spent its fury. Full dawn rose in a
clear blue rain-washed sky. As the sun rose in a blaze of fresh
gold, bright-hued birds lifted a swelling chorus from the trees on
whose broad leaves beads of water sparkled like diamonds, quivering
in the gentle morning breeze.</p>

<p>At a small stream which wound over the sands to join the sea,
hidden beyond a fringe of trees and bushes, a man bent to lave his
hands and face. He performed his ablutions after the manner of his
race, grunting lustily and splashing like a buffalo. But in the
midst of these splashing he lifted his head suddenly, his tawny
hair dripping and water running in rivulets over his brawny
shoulders. He crouched in a listening attitude for a split second,
then was on his feet and facing inland, sword in hand, all in one
motion. And there he froze, glaring wide-mouthed.</p>

<p>A man as big as himself was striding toward him over the sands,
making no attempt at stealth; and the pirate's eyes widened as he
stared at the close-fitting silk breeches, high flaring-topped
boots, wide-skirted coat and head-gear of a hundred years ago.
There was a broad cutlass in the stranger's hand and unmistakable
purpose in his approach.</p>

<p>The pirate went pale, as recognition blazed in his eyes.</p>

<p>'You!' he ejaculated unbelievingly. 'By Mitra! You!'</p>

<p>Oaths streamed from his lips as he heaved up his cutlass. The
birds rose in flaming showers from the trees as the clang of steel
interrupted their song. Blue sparks flew from the hacking blades,
and the sand grated and ground under the stamping boot heels. Then
the clash of steel ended in a chopping crunch, and one man went to
his knees with a choking gasp. The hilt escaped his nerveless hand
and he slid full-length on the sand which reddened with his blood.
With a dying effort he fumbled at his girdle and drew something
from it, tried to lift it to his mouth, and then stiffened
convulsively and went limp.</p>

<p>The conqueror bent and ruthlessly tore the stiffening fingers
from the object they crumpled in their desperate grasp.</p>

<hr>

<p>Zarono and Valenso stood on the beach, staring at the driftwood
their men were gathering&mdash;spars, pieces of masts, broken
timbers. So savagely had the storm hammered Zarono's ship against
the low cliffs that most of the salvage was match-wood. A short
distance behind them stood Belesa, listening to their conversation,
one arm about Tina. The girl was pale and listless, apathetic to
whatever Fate held in store for her. She heard what the men said,
but with little interest. She was crushed by the realization that
she was but a pawn in the game, however it was to be played
out&mdash;whether it was to be a wretched life dragged out on that
desolate coast, or a return, effected somehow, to some civilized
land.</p>

<p>Zarono cursed venomously, but Valenso seemed dazed.</p>

<p>'This is not the time of year for storms from the west,' he
muttered, staring with haggard eyes at the men dragging the
wreckage up on the beach. 'It was not chance that brought that
storm out of the deep to splinter the ship in which I meant to
escape. Escape? I am caught like a rat in a trap, as it was meant.
Nay, we are all trapped rats&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I don't know what you're talking about,' snarled Zarono, giving
a vicious yank at his mustache. 'I've been unable to get any sense
out of you since that flaxen-haired slut upset you last night with
her wild tale of black men coming out of the sea. But I do know
that I'm not going to spend my life on this cursed coast. Ten of my
men went to hell in the ship, but I've got a hundred and sixty
more. You've got a hundred. There are tools in your fort, and
plenty of trees in yonder forest. We'll build a ship. I'll set men
to cutting down trees as soon as they get this drift dragged up out
of the reach of the waves.'</p>

<p>'It will take months,' muttered Valenso.</p>

<p>'Well, is there any better way in which we could employ our
time? We're here&mdash;and unless we build a ship we'll never get
away. We'll have to rig up some kind of a sawmill, but I've never
encountered anything yet that balked me long. I hope that storm
smashed Strom to bits&mdash;the Argossean dog! While we're building
the ship we'll hunt for old Tranicos' loot.'</p>

<p>'We will never complete your ship,' said Valenso somberly.</p>

<p>'You fear the Picts? We have enough men to defy them.'</p>

<p>'I do not speak of the Picts. I speak of a black man.'</p>

<p>Zarono turned on him angrily. 'Will you talk sense? Who is this
accursed black man?'</p>

<p>'Accursed indeed,' said Valenso, staring sea-ward. 'A shadow of
mine own red-stained past risen up to hound me to hell. Because of
him I fled Zingara, hoping to lose my trail in the great ocean. But
I should have known he would smell me out at last.'</p>

<p>'If such a man came ashore he must be hiding in the woods,'
growled Zarono. 'We'll rake the forest and hunt him out.' Valenso
laughed harshly.</p>

<p>'Seek for a shadow that drifts before a cloud that hides the
moon; grope in the dark for a cobra; follow a mist that steals out
of the swamp at midnight.'</p>

<p>Zarono cast him an uncertain look, obviously doubting his
sanity.</p>

<p>'Who is this man? Have done with ambiguity.'</p>

<p>'The shadow of my own mad cruelty and ambition; a horror came
out of the lost ages; no man of mortal flesh and blood,
but&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Sail ho!' bawled the lookout on the north point.</p>

<p>Zarono wheeled and his voice slashed the wind.</p>

<p>'Do you know her?'</p>

<p>'Aye!' the reply came back faintly. 'It's the Red Hand!'</p>

<p>Zarono cursed like a wild man.</p>

<p>'Strom! The devil takes care of his own! How could he ride out
that blow?' The buccaneer's voice rose to a yell that carried up
and down the strand. 'Back to the fort, you dogs!'</p>

<p>Before the Red Hand, somewhat battered in appearance, nosed
around the point, the beach was bare of human life, the palisade
bristling with helmets and scarf-bound heads. The buccaneers
accepted the alliance with the easy adaptability of adventurers,
the henchmen with the apathy of serfs.</p>

<p>Zarono ground his teeth as a longboat swung leisurely in to the
beach, and he sighted the tawny head of his rival in the bow. The
boat grounded, and Strom strode toward the fort alone.</p>

<p>Some distance away he halted and shouted in a bull's bellow that
carried clearly in the still morning. 'Ahoy, the fort! I want to
parley!'</p>

<p>'Well, why in hell don't you?' snarled Zarono.</p>

<p>'The last time I approached under a flag of truce an arrow broke
on my breastplate!' roared the pirate. 'I want a promise it won't
happen again!'</p>

<p>'You have my promise!' called Zarono sardonically.</p>

<p>'Damn your promise, you Zingaran dog! I want Valenso's
word.'</p>

<p>A measure of dignity remained to the Count. There was an edge of
authority to his voice as he answered: 'Advance, but keep your men
back. You will not be fired upon.'</p>

<p>'That's enough for me,' said Strom instantly. 'Whatever a
Korzetta's sins, once his word is given, you can trust him.'</p>

<p>He strode forward and halted under the gate, laughing at the
hate-darkened visage Zarono thrust over at him.</p>

<p>'Well, Zarono,' he taunted, 'you are a ship shorter than you
were when I last saw you! But you Zingarans never were
sailors.'</p>

<p>'How did you save your ship, you Messantian gutter-scum?'
snarled the buccaneer.</p>

<p>'There's a cove some miles to the north protected by a
high-ridged arm of land that broke the force of the gale,' answered
Strom. 'I was anchored behind it. My anchors dragged, but they held
me off the shore.'</p>

<p>Zarono scowled blackly. Valenso said nothing. He had not known
of that cove. He had done scant exploring of his domain. Fear of
the Picts and lack of curiosity had kept him and his men near the
fort. The Zingarans were by nature neither explorers nor
colonists.</p>

<p>'I come to make a trade,' said Strom, easily.</p>

<p>'We've naught to trade with you save sword-strokes,' growled
Zarono.</p>

<p>'I think otherwise,' grinned Strom, thin-lipped. 'You tipped
your hand when you murdered Galacus, my first mate, and robbed him.
Until this morning I supposed that Valenso had Tranicos' treasure.
But if either of you had it, you wouldn't have gone to the trouble
of following me and killing my mate to get the map.'</p>

<p>'The map?' Zarono ejaculated, stiffening.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't dissemble!' laughed Strom, but anger blazed blue in
his eyes. 'I know you have it. Picts don't wear boots!'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;' began the Count, nonplussed, but fell silent as
Zarono nudged him.</p>

<p>'And if we have the map,' said Zarono, 'what have you to trade
that we might require?'</p>

<p>'Let me come into the fort,' suggested Strom. 'There we can
talk.'</p>

<p>He was not so obvious as to glance at the men peering at them
from along the wall, but his two listeners understood. And so did
the men. Strom had a ship. That fact would figure in any
bargaining, or battle. But it would carry just so many, regardless
of who commanded; whoever sailed away in it, there would be some
left behind. A wave of tense speculation ran along the silent
throng at the palisade.</p>

<p>'Your men will stay where they are,' warned Zarono, indicating
both the boat drawn up on the beach, and the ship anchored out in
the bay.</p>

<p>'Aye. But don't get the idea that you can seize me and hold me
for a hostage!' He laughed grimly. 'I want Valenso's word that I'll
be allowed to leave the fort alive and unhurt within the hour,
whether we come to terms or not.'</p>

<p>'You have my pledge,' answered the Count.</p>

<p>'All right, then. Open that gate and let's talk plainly.'</p>

<p>The gate opened and closed, the leaders vanished from sight, and
the common men of both parties resumed their silent surveillance of
each other: the men on the palisade, and the men squatting beside
their boat, with a broad stretch of sand between; and beyond a
strip of blue water, the carack, with steel caps glinting all along
her rail.</p>

<p>On the broad stair, above the great hall, Belesa and Tina
crouched, ignored by the men below. These sat about the broad
table: Valenso, Galbro, Zarono and Strom. But for them the hall was
empty.</p>

<p>Strom gulped wine and set the empty goblet on the table.</p>

<p>The frankness suggested by his bluff countenance was belied by
the dancing lights of cruelty and treachery in his wide eyes. But
he spoke bluntly enough.</p>

<p>'We all want the treasure old Tranicos hid somewhere near this
bay,' he said abruptly. 'Each has something the others need.
Valenso has laborers, supplies, and a stockade to shelter us from
the Picts. You, Zarono, have my map. I have a ship.'</p>

<p>'What I'd like to know,' remarked Zarono, 'is this: if you've
had that map all these years, why haven't you come after the loot
sooner?'</p>

<p>'I didn't have it. It was that dog, Zingelito, who knifed the
old miser in the dark and stole the map. But he had neither ship
nor crew, and it took him more than a year to get them. When he did
come after the treasure, the Picts prevented his landing, and his
men mutinied and made him sail back to Zingara. One of them stole
the map from him, and recently sold it to me.'</p>

<p>'That was why Zingelito recognized the bay,' muttered
Valenso.</p>

<p>'Did that dog lead you here, Count? I might have guessed it.
Where is he?'</p>

<p>'Doubtless in hell, since he was once a buccaneer. The Picts
slew him, evidently while he was searching in the woods for the
treasure.'</p>

<p>'Good!' approved Strom heartily. 'Well, I don't know how you
knew my mate was carrying the map. I trusted him, and the men
trusted him more than they did me, so I let him keep it. But this
morning he wandered inland with some of the others, got separated
from them, and we found him sworded to death near the beach, and
the map gone. The men were ready to accuse me of killing him, but I
showed the fools the tracks left by his slayer, and proved to them
that my feet wouldn't fit them. And I knew it wasn't any one of the
crew, because none of them wear boots that make that sort of track.
And Picts don't wear boots at all. So it had to be a Zingaran.</p>

<p>'Well, you've got the map, but you haven't got the treasure. If
you had it, you wouldn't have let me inside the stockade. I've got
you penned up in this fort. You can't get out to look for the loot,
and even if you did get it, you have no ship to get away in.</p>

<p>'Now here's my proposal: Zarono, give me the map. And you,
Valenso, give me fresh meat and other supplies. My men are nigh to
scurvy after the long voyage. In return I'll take you three men,
the Lady Belesa and her girl, and set you ashore within reach of
some Zingaran port&mdash;or I'll put Zarono ashore near some
buccaneer rendezvous if he prefers, since doubtless a noose awaits
him in Zingara. And to clinch the bargain I'll give each of you a
handsome share in the treasure.'</p>

<p>The buccaneer tugged his mustache meditatively. He knew that
Strom would not keep any such pact, if made. Nor did Zarono even
consider agreeing to his proposal. But to refuse bluntly would be
to force the issue into a clash of arms. He sought his agile brain
for a plan to outwit the pirate. He wanted Strom's ship as avidly
as he desired the lost treasure.</p>

<p>'What's to prevent us from holding you captive and forcing your
men to give us your ship in exchange for you?' he asked.</p>

<p>Strom laughed at him.</p>

<p>'Do you think I'm a fool? My men have orders to heave up the
anchors and sail hence if I don't reappear within the hour, or if
they suspect treachery. They wouldn't give you the ship, if you
skinned me alive on the beach. Besides, I have the Count's
word.'</p>

<p>'My pledge is not straw,' said Valenso somberly. 'Have done with
threats, Zarono.'</p>

<p>Zarono did not reply, his mind wholly absorbed in the problem of
getting possession of Strom's ship; of continuing the parley
without betraying the fact that he did not have the map. He
wondered who in Mitra's name did have the accursed map.</p>

<p>'Let me take my men away with me on your ship when we sail,' he
said. 'I can not desert my faithful followers&mdash;'</p>

<p>Strom snorted.</p>

<p>'Why don't you ask for my cutlass to slit my gullet with? Desert
your faithful&mdash;bah! You'd desert your brother to the devil if
you could gain anything by it. No! You're not going to bring enough
men aboard to give you a chance to mutiny and take my ship.'</p>

<p>'Give us a day to think it over,' urged Zarono, fighting for
time.</p>

<p>Strom's heavy fist banged on the table, making the wine dance in
the glasses.</p>

<p>'No, by Mitra! Give me my answer now!'</p>

<p>Zarono was on his feet, his black rage submerging his
craftiness.</p>

<p>'You Barachan dog! I'll give you your answer&mdash;in your
guts&mdash;'</p>

<p>He tore aside his cloak, caught at his sword-hilt. Strom heaved
up with a roar, his chair crashing backward to the floor. Valenso
sprang up, spreading his arms between them as they faced one
another across the board, jutting jaws close together, blades half
drawn, faces convulsed.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen, have done! Zarono, he has my pledge&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The foul fiends gnaw your pledge!' snarled Zarono.</p>

<p>'Stand from between us, my Lord,' growled the pirate, his voice
thick with the killing lust. 'Your word was that I should not be
treacherously treated. It shall be considered no violation of your
pledge for this dog and me to cross swords in equal play.'</p>

<p>'Well spoken, Strom!' It was a deep, powerful voice behind them,
vibrant with grim amusement. All wheeled and glared, open-mouthed.
Up on the stair Belesa started up with an involuntary
exclamation.</p>

<p>A man strode out from the hangings that masked a chamber door,
and advanced toward the table without haste or hesitation.
Instantly he dominated the group, and all felt the situation subtly
charged with a new, dynamic atmosphere.</p>

<p>The stranger was as tall as either of the freebooters, and more
powerfully built than either, yet for all his size he moved with
pantherish suppleness in his high, flaring-topped boots. His thighs
were cased in close-fitting breeches of white silk, his
wide-skirted sky-blue coat open to reveal an open-necked white
silken shirt beneath, and the scarlet sash that girdled his waist.
There were silver acorn-shaped buttons on the coat, and it was
adorned with gilt-worked cuffs and pocket-flaps, and a satin
collar. A lacquered hat completed a costume obsolete by nearly a
hundred years. A heavy cutlass hung at the wearer's hip.</p>

<p>'Conan!' ejaculated both freebooters together, and Valenso and
Galbro caught their breath at that name.</p>

<p>'Who else?' The giant strode up to the table, laughing
sardonically at their amazement.</p>

<p>'What&mdash;what do you here?' stuttered the seneschal. 'How
come you here, uninvited and unannounced?'</p>

<p>'I climbed the palisade on the east side while you fools were
arguing at the gate,' Conan answered. 'Every man in the fort was
craning his neck westward. I entered the manor while Strom was
being let in at the gate. I've been in that chamber there ever
since, eavesdropping.'</p>

<p>'I thought you were dead,' said Zarono slowly. 'Three years ago
the shattered hull of your ship was sighted off a reefy coast, and
you were heard of on the Main no more.'</p>

<p>'I didn't drown with my crew,' answered Conan. 'It'll take a
bigger ocean than that one to drown me.'</p>

<p>Up on the stair Tina was clutching Belesa in her excitement and
staring through the balustrades with all her eyes.</p>

<p>'Conan! My Lady, it is Conan! Look! Oh, look!'</p>

<p>Belesa was looking; it was like encountering a legendary
character in the flesh. Who of all the sea-folk had not heard the
wild, bloody tales told of Conan, the wild rover who had once been
a captain of the Barachan pirates, and one of the greatest scourges
of the sea? A score of ballads celebrated his ferocious and
audacious exploits. The man could not be ignored; irresistibly he
had stalked into the scene, to form another, dominant element in
the tangled plot. And in the midst of her frightened fascination,
Belesa's feminine instinct prompted the speculation as to Conan's
attitude toward her&mdash;would it be like Strom's brutal
indifference, or Zarono's violent desire?</p>

<p>Valenso was recovering from the shock of finding a stranger
within his very hall. He knew Conan was a Cimmerian, born and bred
in the wastes of the far north, and therefore not amenable to the
physical limitations which controlled civilized men. It was not so
strange that he had been able to enter the fort undetected, but
Valenso flinched at the reflection that other barbarians might
duplicate that feat&mdash;the dark, silent Picts, for instance.</p>

<p>'What do you want here?' he demanded. 'Did you come from the
sea?'</p>

<p>'I came from the woods.' The Cimmerian jerked his head toward
the east.</p>

<p>'You have been living with the Picts?' Valenso asked coldly.</p>

<p>A momentary anger flickered bluely in the giant's eyes. 'Even a
Zingaran ought to know there's never been peace between Picts and
Cimmerians, and never will be,' he retorted with an oath. 'Our feud
with them is older than the world. If you'd said that to one of my
wilder brothers, you'd have found yourself with a split head. But
I've lived among you civilized men long enough to understand your
ignorance and lack of common courtesy&mdash;the churlishness that
demands his business of a man who appears at your door out of a
thousand-mile wilderness. Never mind that.' He turned to the two
freebooters who stood staring glumly at him.</p>

<p>'From what I overheard,' quoth he, 'I gather there is some
dissension over a map!'</p>

<p>'That is none of your affair,' growled Strom.</p>

<p>'Is this it?' Conan grinned wickedly and drew from his pocket a
crumpled object&mdash;a square of parchment, marked with crimson
lines.</p>

<p>Strom stared violently, paling.</p>

<p>'My map!' he ejaculated. 'Where did you get it?'</p>

<p>'From your mate, Galacus, when I killed him,' answered Conan
with grim enjoyment.</p>

<p>'You dog!' raved Strom, turning on Zarono. 'You never had the
map! You lied&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I didn't say I had it,' snarled Zarono. 'You deceived yourself.
Don't be a fool. Conan is alone. If he had a crew he'd have already
cut our throats. We'll take the map from him&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You'll never touch it!' Conan laughed fiercely.</p>

<p>Both men sprang at him, cursing. Stepping back he crumpled the
parchment and cast it into the glowing coals of the fireplace. With
an incoherent bellow Strom lunged past him, to be met with a buffet
under the ear that stretched him half-senseless on the floor.
Zarono whipped out his sword but before he could thrust, Conan's
cutlass beat it out of his hand.</p>

<p>Zarono staggered against the table, with all hell in his eyes.
Strom dragged himself erect, his eyes glazed, blood dripping from
his bruised ear.</p>

<p>Conan leaned slightly over the table, his outstretched cutlass
just touched the breast of Count Valenso.</p>

<p>'Don't call for your soldiers, Count,' said the Cimmerian
softly. 'Not a sound out of you&mdash;or from you, either,
dog-face!' His name for Galbro, who showed no intention of braving
his wrath. 'The map's burned to ashes, and it'll do no good to
spill blood. Sit down, all of you.'</p>

<p>Strom hesitated, made an abortive gesture toward his hilt, then
shrugged his shoulders and sank sullenly into a chair. The others
followed suit. Conan remained standing, towering over the table,
while his enemies watched him with bitter eyes of hate.</p>

<p>'You were bargaining,' he said. 'That's all I've come to
do.'</p>

<p>'And what have you to trade?' sneered Zarono.</p>

<p>'The treasure of Tranicos!'</p>

<p>'What?' All four men were on their feet, leaning toward him.</p>

<p>'Sit down!' he roared, banging his broad blade on the table.
They sank back, tense and white with excitement. He grinned in huge
enjoyment of the sensation his words had caused.</p>

<p>'Yes! I found it before I got the map. That's why I burned the
map. I don't need it. And now nobody will ever find it, unless I
show him where it is.'</p>

<p>They stared at him with murder in their eyes.</p>

<p>'You're lying,' said Zarono without conviction. 'You've told us
one lie already. You said you came from the woods, yet you say you
haven't been living with the Picts. All men know this country is a
wilderness, inhabited only by savages. The nearest outposts of
civilization are the Aquilonian settlements on Thunder River,
hundreds of miles to eastward.'</p>

<p>'That's where I came from,' replied Conan imperturbably. 'I
believe I'm the first white man to cross the Pictish Wilderness. I
crossed Thunder River to follow a raiding party that had been
harrying the frontier. I followed them deep into the wilderness,
and killed their chief, but was knocked senseless by a stone from a
sling during the melee, and the dogs captured me alive. They were
Wolfmen, but they traded me to the Eagle clan in return for a chief
of theirs the Eagles had captured. The Eagles carried me nearly a
hundred miles westward to burn me in their chief village, but I
killed their war-chief and three or four others one night, and
broke away.</p>

<p>'I couldn't turn back. They were behind me, and kept herding me
westward. A few days ago I shook them off, and by Crom, the place
where I took refuge turned out to be the treasure trove of old
Tranicos! I found it all: chests of garments and
weapons&mdash;that's where I got these clothes and this
blade&mdash;heaps of coins and gems and gold ornaments, and in the
midst of all, the jewels of Tothmekri gleaming like frozen
starlight! And old Tranicos and his eleven captains sitting about
an ebon table and staring at the board, as they've stared for a
hundred years!'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Aye!' he laughed. 'Tranicos died in the midst of his treasure,
and all with him! Their bodies have not rotted nor shriveled. They
sit there in their high boots and skirted coats and lacquered hats,
with their wineglasses in their stiff hands, just as they have sat
for a century!'</p>

<p>'That's an unchancy thing!' muttered Strom uneasily, but Zarono
snarled: 'What boots it? It's the treasure we want. Go on,
Conan.'</p>

<p>Conan seated himself at the board, filled a goblet and quaffed
it before he answered.</p>

<p>'The first wine I've drunk since I left Conawaga, by Crom! Those
cursed Eagles hunted me so closely through the forest I had hardly
time to munch the nuts and roots I found. Sometimes I caught frogs
and ate them raw because I dared not light a fire.'</p>

<p>His impatient hearers informed him profanely that they were not
interested in his adventures prior to finding the treasure. He
grinned hardly and resumed: 'Well, after I stumbled onto the trove
I lay up and rested a few days, and made snares to catch rabbits,
and let my wounds heal. I saw smoke against the western sky, but
thought it some Pictish village on the beach. I lay close, but as
it happens, the loot's hidden in a place the Picts shun. If any
spied on me, they didn't show themselves.</p>

<p>'Last night I started westward, intending to strike the beach
some miles north of the spot where I'd seen the smoke. I wasn't far
from the shore when that storm hit. I took shelter under the lee of
a rock and waited until it had blown itself out. Then I climbed a
tree to look for Picts, and from it I saw your carack at anchor,
Strom, and your men coming in to shore. I was making my way toward
your camp on the beach when I met Galacus. I shoved a sword through
him because there was an old feud between us. I wouldn't have known
he had a map, if he hadn't tried to eat it before he died.</p>

<p>'I recognized it for what it was, of course, and was considering
what use I could make of it, when the rest of you dogs came up and
found the body. I was lying in a thicket not a dozen yards from you
while you were arguing with your men over the matter. I judged the
time wasn't ripe for me to show myself then!'</p>

<p>He laughed at the rage and chagrin displayed in Strom's
face.</p>

<p>'Well, while I lay there, listening to your talk, I got a drift
of the situation, and learned, from the things you let fall, that
Zarono and Valenso were a few miles south of the beach. So when I
heard you say that Zarono must have done the killing and taken the
map, and that you meant to go and parley with him, seeking an
opportunity to murder him and get it back&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Dog!' snarled Zarono.</p>

<p>Strom was livid, but he laughed mirthlessly.</p>

<p>'Do you think I'd play fairly with a treacherous dog like
you?&mdash;Go on, Conan.'</p>

<p>The Cimmerian grinned. It was evident that he was deliberately
fanning the fires of hate between the two men.</p>

<p>'Nothing much, then. I came straight through the woods while you
tacked along the coast, and raised the fort before you did. Your
guess that the storm had destroyed Zarono's ship was a good
one&mdash;but then, you knew the configuration of this bay.</p>

<p>'Well, there's the story. I have the treasure, Strom has a ship.
Valenso has supplies. By Crom, Zarono, I don't see where you fit
into the scheme, but to avoid strife I'll include you. My proposal
is simple enough.</p>

<p>'We'll split the treasure four ways. Strom and I will sail away
with our shares aboard the Red Hand. You and Valenso take yours and
remain lords of the wilderness, or build a ship out of tree trunks,
as you wish.'</p>

<p>Valenso blenched and Zarono swore, while Strom grinned
quietly.</p>

<p>'Are you fool enough to go aboard the Red Hand alone with
Strom?' snarled Zarono. 'He'll cut your throat before you're out of
sight of land!'</p>

<p>Conan laughed with genuine enjoyment. 'This is like the problem
of the sheep, the wolf and the cabbage,' he admitted. 'How to get
them across the river without their devouring each other!'</p>

<p>'And that appeals to your Cimmerian sense of humor,' complained
Zarono.</p>

<p>'I will not stay here!' cried Valenso, a wild gleam in his dark
eyes. 'Treasure or no treasure, I must go!'</p>

<p>Conan gave him a slit-eyed glance of speculation.</p>

<p>'Well, then,' said he, 'how about this plan: we divide the loot
as I suggested. Then Strom sails away with Zarono, Valenso, and
such members of the Count's household as he may select, leaving me
in command of the fort and the rest of Valenso's men, and all of
Zarono's. I'll build my own ship.'</p>

<p>Zarono looked slightly sick.</p>

<p>'I have the choice of remaining here in exile, or abandoning my
crew and going alone on the Red Hand to have my throat cut?'</p>

<p>Conan's laughter rang gustily through the hall, and he smote
Zarono jovially on the back, ignoring the black murder in the
buccaneer's glare.</p>

<p>'That's it, Zarono!' quoth he. 'Stay here while Strom and I sail
away, or sail away with Strom, leaving your men with me.'</p>

<p>'I'd rather have Zarono,' said Strom frankly. 'You'd turn my own
men against me, Conan, and cut my throat before I raised the
Barachans.'</p>

<p>Sweat dripped from Zarono's livid face.</p>

<p>'Neither I, the Count, nor his niece will ever reach the land
alive if we ship with that devil,' said he. 'You are both in my
power in this hall. My men surround it. What's to prevent me
cutting you both down?'</p>

<p>'Not a thing,' Conan admitted cheerfully. 'Except the fact that
if you do Strom's men will sail away and leave you stranded on this
coast where the Picts will presently cut all your throats; and the
fact that with me dead you'll never find the treasure; and the fact
that I'll split your skull down to your chin if you try to summon
your men.'</p>

<p>Conan laughed as he spoke, as if at some whimsical situation,
but even Belesa sensed that he meant what he said. His naked
cutlass lay across his knees, and Zarono's sword was under the
table, out of the buccaneer's reach. Galbro was not a fighting man,
and Valenso seemed incapable of decision or action.</p>

<p>'Aye!' said Strom with an oath. 'You'd find the two of us no
easy prey. I'm agreeable to Conan's proposal. What do you say?'</p>

<p>'I must leave this coast!' whispered Valenso, staring blankly.
'I must hasten&mdash;I must go&mdash;go far&mdash;quickly!'</p>

<p>Strom frowned, puzzled at the Count's strange manner and turned
to Zarono, grinning wickedly: 'And you, Zarono?'</p>

<p>'What can I say?' snarled Zarono. 'Let me take my three officers
and forty men aboard the Red Hand, and the bargain's made.'</p>

<p>'The officers and thirty men!'</p>

<p>There was no shaking of hands, or ceremonial drinking of wine to
seal the pact. The two captains glared at each other like hungry
wolves. The Count plucked his mustache with a trembling hand, rapt
in his own somber thoughts. Conan stretched like a great cat, drank
wine, and grinned on the assemblage, but it was the sinister grin
of a stalking tiger. Belesa sensed the murderous purposes that
reigned there, the treacherous intent that dominated each man's
mind. Not one had any intention of keeping his part of the pact,
Valenso possibly excluded. Each of the freebooters intended to
possess both the ship and the entire treasure. Neither would be
satisfied with less. But how? What was going on in each crafty
mind? Belesa felt oppressed and stifled by the atmosphere of hatred
and treachery. The Cimmerian, for all his ferocious frankness, was
no less subtle than the others&mdash;and even fiercer. His
domination of the situation was not physical alone, though his
gigantic shoulders and massive limbs seemed too big even for the
great hall. There was an iron vitality about the man that
overshadowed even the hard vigor of the other freebooters.</p>

<p>'Lead us to the treasure!' Zarono demanded.</p>

<p>'Wait a bit,' answered Conan. 'We must keep our power evenly
balanced, so one can't take advantage of the others. We'll work it
this way: Strom's men will come ashore, all but half a dozen or so,
and camp on the beach. Zarono's men will come out of the fort, and
likewise camp on the strand, within easy sight of them. Then each
crew can keep a check on the other, to see that nobody slips after
us who go after the treasure, to ambush any of us. Those left
aboard the Red Hand will take her out into the bay out of reach of
either party. Valenso's men will stay in the fort, but will leave
the gate open. Will you come with us, Count?'</p>

<p>'Go into that forest?' Valenso shuddered, and drew his cloak
about his shoulders. 'Not for all the gold of Tranicos!'</p>

<p>'All right. It'll take about thirty men to carry the loot. We'll
take fifteen from each crew and start as soon as possible.'</p>

<p>Belesa, keenly alert to every angle of the drama being played
out beneath her, saw Zarono and Strom shoot furtive glaces at one
another, then lower their gaze quickly as they lifted their glasses
to hide the murky intent in their eyes. Belesa saw the fatal
weakness in Conan's plan, and wondered how he could have overlooked
it. Perhaps he was too arrogantly confident in his personal
prowess. But she knew that he would never come out of that forest
alive. Once the treasure was in their grasp, the others would form
a rogues' alliance long enough to rid themselves of the man both
hated. She shuddered, staring morbidly at the man she knew was
doomed; strange to see that powerful fighting man sitting there,
laughing and swilling wine, in full prime and power, and to know
that he was already doomed to a bloody death.</p>

<p>The whole situation was pregnant with dark and bloody portents.
Zarono would trick and kill Strom if he could, and she knew that
Strom had already marked Zarono for death, and doubtless, also, her
uncle and herself. If Zarono won the final battle of cruel wits,
their lives were safe&mdash;but looking at the buccaneer as he sat
there chewing his mustache, with all the stark evil of his nature
showing naked in his dark face, she could not decide which was more
abhorrent&mdash;death or Zarono.</p>

<p>'How far is it?' demanded Strom.</p>

<p>'If we start within the hour we can be back before midnight,'
answered Conan. He emptied his glass, rose, adjusted his girdle,
and glanced at the Count.</p>

<p>'Valenso,' he said, 'are you mad, to kill a Pict in his hunting
paint?'</p>

<p>Valenso started.</p>

<p>'What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Do you mean to say you don't know that your men killed a Pict
hunter in the woods last night?'</p>

<p>The Count shook his head.</p>

<p>'None of my men was in the woods last night.'</p>

<p>'Well, somebody was,' grunted the Cimmerian, fumbling in a
pocket. 'I saw his head nailed to a tree near the edge of the
forest. He wasn't painted for war. I didn't find any boot-tracks,
from which I judged that it had been nailed up there before the
storm. But there were plenty of other signs&mdash;moccasin tracks
on the wet ground. Picts have been there and seen that head. They
were men of some other clan, or they'd have taken it down. If they
happen to be at peace with the clan the dead man belonged to,
they'll make tracks to his village to tell his tribe.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps they killed him,' suggested Valenso.</p>

<p>'No, they didn't. But they know who did, for the same reason
that I know. This chain was knotted about the stump of the severed
neck. You must have been utterly mad, to identify your handiwork
like that.'</p>

<p>He drew forth something and tossed it on the table before the
Count, who lurched up, choking, as his hand flew to his throat. It
was the gold seal-chain he habitually wore about his neck.</p>

<p>'I recognized the Korzetta seal,' said Conan. 'The presence of
that chain would tell any Pict it was the work of a foreigner.'
Valenso did not reply. He sat staring at the chain as if at a
venomous serpent.</p>

<p>Conan scowled at him, and glanced questioningly at the others.
Zarono made a quick gesture to indicate the Count was not quite
right in the head.</p>

<p>Conan sheathed his cutlass and donned his lacquered hat.</p>

<p>'All right; let's go.'</p>

<p>The captains gulped down their wine and rose, hitching at their
sword-hilts. Zarono laid a hand on Valenso's arm and shook him
slightly. The Count started and stared about him, then followed the
others out, like a man in a daze, the chain dangling from his
fingers. But not all left the hall.</p>

<p>Belesa and Tina, forgotten on the stair, peeping between the
balusters, saw Galbro fall behind the others, loitering until the
heavy door closed after them. Then he hurried to the fireplace and
raked carefully at the smoldering coals. He sank to his knees and
peered closely at something for a long space. Then he straightened,
and with a furtive air stole out of the hall by another door.</p>

<p>'What did Galbro find in the fire?' whispered Tina.</p>

<p>Belesa shook her head, then, obeying the promptings of her
curiosity, rose and went down to the empty hall. An instant later
she was kneeling where the seneschal had knelt, and she saw what he
had seen.</p>

<p>It was the charred remnant of the map Conan had thrown into the
fire. It was ready to crumble at a touch, but faint lines and bits
of writing were still discernible upon it. She could not read the
writing, but she could trace the outlines of what seemed to be the
picture of a hill or crag, surrounded by marks evidently
representing dense trees. She could make nothing of it, but from
Galbro's actions, she believed he recognized it as portraying some
scene or topographical feature familiar to him. She knew the
seneschal had penetrated inland further than any other man of the
settlement.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="stranger6" name="stranger6">VI. &mdash; THE PLUNDER OF
THE DEAD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BELESA came down the stair and paused at the sight
of Count Valenso seated at the table, turning the broken chain
about in his hands. She looked at him without love, and with more
than a little fear. The change that had come over him was
appalling; he seemed to be locked up in a grim world all of his
own, with a fear that flogged all human characteristics out of
him.</p>

<p>The fortress stood strangely quiet in the noonday heat that had
followed the storm of the dawn. Voices of people within the
stockade sounded subdued, muffled. The same drowsy stillness
reigned on the beach outside where the rival crews lay in armed
suspicion, separated by a few hundred yards of bare sand. Far out
in the bay the Red Hand lay at anchor with a handful of men aboard
her, ready to snatch her out of reach at the slightest indication
of treachery. The carack was Strom's trump card, his best guarantee
against the trickery of his associates.</p>

<p>Conan had plotted shrewdly to eliminate the chances of an ambush
in the forest by either party. But as far as Belesa could see, he
had failed utterly to safeguard himself against the treachery of
his companions. He had disappeared into the woods, leading the two
captains and their thirty men, and the Zingaran girl was positive
that she would never see him alive again.</p>

<p>Presently she spoke, and her voice was strained and harsh to her
own ear.</p>

<p>'The barbarian has led the captains into the forest. When they
have the gold in their hands, they'll kill him. But when they
return with the treasure, what then? Are we to go aboard the ship?
Can we trust Strom?'</p>

<p>Valenso shook his head absently.</p>

<p>'Strom would murder us all for our shares of the loot. But
Zarono whispered his intentions to me secretly. We will not go
aboard the Red Hand save as her masters. Zarono will see that night
overtakes the treasure-party, so they are forced to camp in the
forest. He will find a way to kill Strom and his men in their
sleep. Then the buccaneers will come on stealthily to the beach.
Just before dawn I will send some of my fishermen secretly from the
fort to swim out to the ship and seize her. Strom never thought of
that; neither did Conan. Zarono and his men will come out of the
forest and with the buccaneers encamped on the beach, fall upon the
pirates in the dark, while I lead my men-at-arms from the fort to
complete the rout. Without their captain they will be demoralized,
and outnumbered, fall easy prey to Zarono and me. Then we will sail
in Strom's ship with all the treasure.'</p>

<p>'And what of me?' she asked with dry lips.</p>

<p>'I have promised you to Zarono,' he answered harshly. 'But for
my promise he would not take us off.'</p>

<p>'I will never marry him,' she said helplessly.</p>

<p>'You will,' he responded gloomily, and without the slightest
touch of sympathy. He lifted the chain so it caught the gleam of
the sun, slanting through a window. 'I must have dropped it on the
sand,' he muttered. 'He has been that near&mdash;on the
beach&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You did not drop it on the strand,' said Belesa, in a voice as
devoid of mercy as his own; her soul seemed turned to stone. 'You
tore it from your throat, by accident, last night in this hall,
when you flogged Tina. I saw it gleaming on the floor before I left
the hall.'</p>

<p>He looked up, his face grey with a terrible fear.</p>

<p>She laughed bitterly, sensing the mute question in his dilated
eyes.</p>

<p>'Yes! the black man! He was here! In this hall! He must have
found the chain on the floor. The guardsmen did not see him. But he
was at your door last night. I saw him, padding along the upper
hallway.'</p>

<p>For an instant she thought he would drop dead of sheer terror.
He sank back in his chair, the chain slipping from his nerveless
fingers and clinking on the table.</p>

<p>'In the manor!' he whispered. 'I thought bolts and bars and
armed guards could keep him out, fool that I was! I can no more
guard against him than I can escape him! At my door! At my door!'
The thought overwhelmed him with horror. 'Why did he not enter?' he
shrieked, tearing at the lace upon his collar as though it
strangled him. 'Why did he not end it? I have dreamed of waking in
my darkened chamber to see him squatting above me and the blue
hell-fire playing about his horned head! Why&mdash;'</p>

<p>The paroxysm passed, leaving him faint and trembling.</p>

<p>'I understand!' he panted. 'He is playing with me, as a cat with
a mouse. To have slain me last night in my chamber were too easy,
too merciful. So he destroyed the ship in which I might have
escaped him, and he slew that wretched Pict and left my chain upon
him, so that the savages might believe I had slain him&mdash;they
have seen that chain upon my neck many a time.</p>

<p>'But why? What subtle deviltry has he in mind, what devious
purpose no human mind can grasp or understand?'</p>

<p>'Who is this black man?' asked Belesa, chill fear crawling along
her spine.</p>

<p>'A demon loosed by my greed and lust to plague me throughout
eternity!' he whispered. He spread his long thin fingers on the
table before him, and stared at her with hollow, weirdly luminous
eyes that seemed to see her not at all, but to look through her and
far beyond to some dim doom.</p>

<p>'In my youth I had an enemy at court,' he said, as if speaking
more to himself than to her. 'A powerful man who stood between me
and my ambition. In my lust for wealth and power I sought aid from
the people of the black arts&mdash;a black magician, who, at my
desire, raised up a fiend from the outer gulfs of existence and
clothed it in the form of a man. It crushed and slew my enemy; I
grew great and wealthy and none could stand before me. But I
thought to cheat my fiend of the price a mortal must pay who calls
the black folk to do his bidding.</p>

<p>'By his grim arts the magician tricked the soulless waif of
darkness and bound him in hell where he howled in vain&mdash;I
supposed for eternity. But because the sorcerer had given the fiend
the form of a man, he could never break the link that bound it to
the material world; never completely close the cosmic corridors by
which it had gained access to this planet. A year ago in Kordava
word came to me that the magician, now an ancient man, had been
slain in his castle, with marks of demon fingers on his throat.
Then I knew that the black one had escaped from the hell where the
magician had bound him, and that he would seek vengeance upon me.
One night I saw his demon face leering at me from the shadows in my
castle hall&mdash;</p>

<p>'It was not his material body, but his spirit sent to plague
me&mdash;his spirit which could not follow me over the windy
waters. Before he could reach Kordava in the flesh, I sailed to put
broad seas between me and him. He has his limitations. To follow me
across the seas he must remain in his man-like body of flesh. But
that flesh is not human flesh. He can be slain, I think, by fire,
though the magician, having raised him up, was powerless to slay
him&mdash;such are the limits set upon the powers of sorcerers.</p>

<p>'But the black one is too crafty to be trapped or slain. When he
hides himself no man can find him. He steals like a shadow through
the night, making naught of bolts and bars. He blinds the eyes of
guardsmen with sleep. He can raise storms and command the serpents
of the deep, and the fiends of the night. I hoped to drown my trail
in the blue rolling wastes&mdash;but he has tracked me down to
claim his grim forfeit.'</p>

<p>The weird eyes lit palely as he gazed beyond the tapestried
walls to far, invisible horizons.</p>

<p>'I'll trick him yet,' he whispered. 'Let him delay to strike
this night&mdash;dawn will find me with a ship under my heels and
again I will cast an ocean between me and his vengeance.'</p>

<hr>

<p>'Hell's fire!'</p>

<p>Conan stopped short, glaring upward. Behind him the seamen
halted&mdash;two compact clumps of them, bows in their hands, and
suspicion in their attitude. They were following an old path made
by Pictish hunters which led due east, and though they had
progressed only some thirty yards, the beach was no longer
visible.</p>

<p>'What is it?' demanded Strom suspiciously. 'What are you
stopping for?'</p>

<p>'Are you blind? Look there!'</p>

<p>From the thick limb of a tree that overhung the trail a head
grinned down at them&mdash;a dark painted face, framed in thick
black hair, in which a toucan feather drooped over the left
ear.</p>

<p>'I took that head down and hid it in the bushes,' growled Conan,
scanning the woods about them narrowly. 'What fool could have stuck
it back up there? It looks as if somebody was trying his damnedest
to bring the Picts down on the settlement.'</p>

<p>Men glanced at each other darkly, a new element of suspicion
added to the already seething caldron. Conan climbed the tree,
secured the head and carried it into the bushes, where he tossed it
into a stream and saw it sink.</p>

<p>'The Picts whose tracks are about this tree weren't Toucans,' he
growled, returning through the thicket. 'I've sailed these coasts
enough to know something about the sea-land tribes. If I read the
prints of their moccasins right, they were Cormorants. I hope
they're having a war with the Toucans. If they're at peace, they'll
head straight for the Toucan village, and there'll be hell to pay.
I don't know how far away that village is&mdash;but as soon as they
learn of this murder, they'll come through the forest like starving
wolves. That's the worst insult possible to a Pict&mdash;kill a man
not in war-paint and stick his head up in a tree for the vultures
to eat. Damn peculiar things going on along this coast. But that's
always the way when civilized men come into the wilderness. They're
all crazy as hell. Come on.'</p>

<p>Men loosened blades in their scabbards and shafts in their
quivers as they strode deeper into the forest. Men of the sea,
accustomed to the rolling expanses of grey water, they were ill at
ease with the green mysterious walls of trees and vines hemming
them in. The path wound and twisted until most of them quickly lost
their sense of direction, and did not even know in which direction
the beach lay.</p>

<p>Conan was uneasy for another reason. He kept scanning the trail,
and finally grunted: 'Somebody's passed along here
recently&mdash;not more than an hour ahead of us. Somebody in
boots, with no woods-craft. Was he the fool who found that Pict's
head and stuck it back up in that tree? No, it couldn't have been
him. I didn't find his tracks under the tree. But who was it? I
didn't find any tracks there, except those of the Picts I'd seen
already. And who's this fellow hurrying ahead of us? Did either of
you bastards send a man ahead of us for any reason?'</p>

<p>Both Strom and Zarono loudly disclaimed any such act, glaring at
each other with mutual disbelief. Neither man could see the signs
Conan pointed out; the faint prints which he saw on the grassless,
hard-beaten trail were invisible to their untrained eyes.</p>

<p>Conan quickened his pace and they hurried after him, fresh coals
of suspicion added to the smoldering fire of distrust. Presently
the path veered northward, and Conan left it, and began threading
his way through the dense trees in a southeasterly direction. Strom
stole an uneasy glance at Zarono. This might force a change in
their plans. Within a few hundred feet from the trail both were
hopelessly lost, and convinced of their inability to find their way
back to the path. They were shaken by the fear that, after all, the
Cimmerian had a force at his command, and was leading them into an
ambush.</p>

<p>This suspicion grew as they advanced, and had almost reached
panic proportions when they emerged from the thick woods and saw
just ahead of them a gaunt crag that jutted up from the forest
floor. A dim path leading out of the woods from the east ran among
a cluster of boulders and wound up the crag on a ladder of stony
shelves to a flat ledge near the summit. Conan halted, a bizarre
figure in his piratical finery.</p>

<p>'That trail is the one I followed, running from the
Eagle-Picts,' he said. 'It leads up to a cave behind that ledge. In
that cave are the bodies of Tranicos and his captains, and the
treasure he plundered from Tothmekri. But a word before we go up
after it: if you kill me here, you'll never find your way back to
the trail we followed from the beach. I know you seafaring men.
You're helpless in the deep woods. Of course the beach lies due
west, but if you have to make your way through the tangled woods,
burdened with the plunder, it'll take you not hours, but days. And
I don't think these woods will be very safe for white men, when the
Toucans learn about their hunter.'</p>

<p>He laughed at the ghastly, mirthless smiles with which they
greeted his recognition of their intentions regarding him. And he
also comprehended the thought that sprang in the mind of each: let
the barbarian secure the loot for them, and lead them back to the
beach-trail before they killed him.</p>

<p>'All of you stay here except Strom and Zarono,' said Conan. 'We
three are enough to pack the treasure down from the cave.'</p>

<p>Strom grinned mirthlessly.</p>

<p>'Go up there alone with you and Zarono? Do you take me for a
fool? One man at least comes with me!' And he designated his
boatswain, a brawny, hard-faced giant, naked to his broad leather
belt, with gold hoops in his ears, and a crimson scarf knotted
about his head.</p>

<p>'And my executioner comes with me!' growled Zarono. He beckoned
to a lean sea-thief with a face like a parchment-covered skull, who
carried a two-handed scimitar naked over his bony shoulder.</p>

<p>Conan shrugged his shoulders. 'Very well. Follow me.'</p>

<p>They were close on his heels as he strode up the winding path
and mounted the ledge. They crowded him close as he passed through
the cleft in the wall behind it, and their breath sucked greedily
between their teeth as he called their attention to the iron-bound
chests on either side of the short tunnel-like cavern.</p>

<p>'A rich cargo there,' he said carelessly. 'Silks, laces,
garments, ornaments, weapons&mdash;the loot of the southern seas.
But the real treasure lies beyond that door.'</p>

<p>The massive door stood partly open. Conan frowned. He remembered
closing that door before he left the cavern. But he said nothing of
the matter to his eager companions as he drew aside to let them
look through.</p>

<p>They looked into a wide cavern, lit by a strange blue glow that
glimmered through a smoky mist-like haze. A great ebon table stood
in the midst of the cavern, and in a carved chair with a high back
and broad arms, that might once have stood in the castle of some
Zingaran baron, sat a giant figure, fabulous and
fantastic&mdash;there sat Bloody Tranicos, his great head sunk on
his bosom, one brawny hand still gripping a jeweled goblet in which
wine still sparkled; Tranicos, in his lacquered hat, his
gilt-embroidered coat with jeweled buttons that winked in the blue
flame, his flaring boots and gold-worked baldric that upheld a
jewel-hilted sword in a golden sheath.</p>

<p>And ranging the board, each with his chin resting on his
lace-bedecked crest, sat the eleven captains. The blue fire played
weirdly on them and on their giant admiral, as it flowed from the
enormous jewel on the tiny ivory pedestal, striking glints of
frozen fire from the heaps of fantastically cut gems which shone
before the place of Tranicos&mdash;the plunder of Khemi, the jewels
of Tothmekri! The stones whose value was greater than the value of
all the rest of the known jewels in the world put together!</p>

<p>The faces of Zarono and Strom showed pallid in the blue glow;
over their shoulders their men gaped stupidly.</p>

<p>'Go in and take them,' invited Conan, drawing aside, and Zarono
and Strom crowded avidly past him, jostling one another in their
haste. Their followers were treading on their heels. Zarono kicked
the door wide open&mdash;and halted with one foot on the threshold
at the sight of a figure on the floor, previously hidden from view
by the partly-closed door. It was a man, prone and contorted, head
drawn back between his shoulders, white face twisted in a grin of
mortal agony, gripping his own throat with clawed fingers.</p>

<p>'Galbro!' ejaculated Zarono. 'Dead! What&mdash;' With sudden
suspicion he thrust his head over the threshold, into the bluish
mist that filled the inner cavern. And he screamed, chokingly:
'There is death in the smoke!'</p>

<p>Even as he screamed, Conan hurled his weight against the four
men bunched in the doorway, sending them staggering&mdash;but not
headlong&mdash;into the mist-filled cavern as he had planned. They
were recoiling at the sight of the dead man and the realization of
the trap, and his violent push, while it threw them off their feet,
yet failed of the result he desired. Strom and Zarono sprawled half
over the threshold on their knees, the boatswain tumbling over
their legs, and the executioner caromed against the wall. Before
Conan could follow up his ruthless intention of kicking the fallen
men into the cavern and holding the door against them until the
poisonous mist did its deadly work, he had to turn and defend
himself against the frothing onslaught of the executioner who was
the first to regain his balance and his wits.</p>

<p>The buccaneer missed a tremendous swipe with his headsman's
sword as the Cimmerian ducked, and the great blade banged against
the stone wall, spattering blue sparks. The next instant his
skull-faced head rolled on the cavern-floor under the bite of
Conan's cutlass.</p>

<p>In the split seconds this swift action consumed, the boatswain
regained his feet and fell on the Cimmerian raining blows with a
cutlass that would have overwhelmed a lesser man. Cutlass met
cutlass with a ring of steel that was deafening in the narrow
cavern. The two captains rolled back across the threshold, gagging
and gasping, purple in the face and too near strangled to shout,
and Conan redoubled his efforts, in an endeavor to dispose of his
antagonist and cut down his rivals before they could recover from
the effects of the poison. The boatswain dripped blood at each
step, as he was driven back before the ferocious onslaught, and he
began desperately to bellow for his companions. But before Conan
could deal the finishing stroke the two chiefs, gasping but
murderous, came at him with swords in their hands, croaking for
their men.</p>

<p>The Cimmerian bounded back and leaped out onto the ledge. He
felt himself a match for all three men, though each was a famed
swordsman, but he did not wish to be trapped by the crews which
would come charging up the path at the sound of the battle.</p>

<p>These were not coming with as much celerity as he expected,
however. They were bewildered at the sounds and muffled shouts
issuing from the cavern above them but no man dared start up the
path for fear of a sword in the back. Each band faced the other
tensely, grasping their weapons but incapable of decision, and when
they saw the Cimmerian bound out on the ledge, they still
hesitated. While they stood with their arrows nocked he ran up the
ladder of handholds niched in the rock near the cleft, and threw
himself prone on the summit of the crag, out of their sight.</p>

<p>The captains stormed out on the ledge, raving and brandishing
their swords, and their men, seeing their leaders were not at
sword-strokes, ceased menacing each other, and gaped
bewilderedly.</p>

<p>'Dog!' screamed Zarono. 'You planned to poison us! Traitor!'</p>

<p>Conan mocked them from above.</p>

<p>'Well, what did you expect? You two were planning to cut my
throat as soon as I got the plunder for you. If it hadn't been for
that fool Galbro I'd have trapped the four of you, and explained to
your men how you rushed in heedless to your doom.'</p>

<p>'And with us both dead, you'd have taken my ship, and all the
loot too!' frothed Strom.</p>

<p>'Aye! And the pick of each crew! I've been wanting to get back
on the Main for months, and this was a good opportunity!'</p>

<p>'It was Galbro's foot-prints I saw on the trail. I wonder how
the fool learned of this cave, or how he expected to lug away the
loot by himself.'</p>

<p>'But for the sight of his body we'd have walked into that
death-trap,' muttered Zarono, his swarthy face still ashy. 'That
blue smoke was like unseen fingers crushing my throat.'</p>

<p>'Well, what are you going to do?' their tormentor yelled
sardonically.</p>

<p>'What are we to do?' Zarono asked Strom. 'The treasure-cavern is
filled with that poisonous mist, though for some reason it does not
flow across the threshold.'</p>

<p>'You can't get the treasure,' Conan assured them with
satisfaction from his aerie. 'That smoke will strangle you. It
nearly got me, when I stepped in there. Listen, and I'll tell you a
tale the Picts tell in their huts when the fires burn low! Once,
long ago, twelve strange men came out of the sea, and found a cave
and heaped it with gold and and jewels; but a Pictish shaman made
magic and the earth shook, and smoke came out of the earth and
strangled them where they sat at wine. The smoke, which was the
smoke of hell's fire, was confined within the cavern by the magic
of the wizard. The tale was told from tribe to tribe, and all the
clans shun the accursed spot.</p>

<p>'When I crawled in there to escape the Eagle-Picts, I realized
that the old legend was true, and referred to old Tranicos and his
men. An earthquake cracked the rock floor of the cavern while he
and his captains sat at wine, and let the mist out of the depths of
the earth&mdash;doubtless out of hell, as the Picts say. Death
guards old Tranicos' treasure!'</p>

<p>'Bring up the men!' frothed Strom. 'We'll climb up and hew him
down!'</p>

<p>'Don't be a fool,' snarled Zarono. 'Do you think any man on
earth could climb those hand-holds in the teeth of his sword? We'll
have the men up here, right enough, to feather him with shafts if
he dares show himself. But we'll get those gems yet. He had some
plan of obtaining the loot, or he wouldn't have brought thirty men
to bear it back. If he could get it, so can we. We'll bend a
cutlass-blade to make a hook, tie it to a rope and cast it about
the leg of that table, then drag it to the door.'</p>

<p>'Well thought, Zarono!' came down Conan's mocking voice.
'Exactly what I had in mind. But how will you find your way back to
the beach-path? It'll be dark long before you reach the beach, if
you have to feel your way through the woods, and I'll follow you
and kill you one by one in the dark.'</p>

<p>'It's no empty boast,' muttered Strom. 'He can move and strike
in the dark as subtly and silently as a ghost. If he hunts us back
through the forest, few of us will live to see the beach.'</p>

<p>'Then we'll kill him here,' gritted Zarono. 'Some of us will
shoot at him while the rest climb the crag. If he is not struck by
arrows, some of us will reach him with our swords. Listen! Why does
he laugh?'</p>

<p>'To hear dead men making plots,' came Conan's grimly amused
voice.</p>

<p>'Heed him not,' scowled Zarono, and lifting his voice, shouted
for the men below to join him and Strom on the ledge.</p>

<p>The sailors started up the slanting trail, and one started to
shout a question. Simultaneously there sounded a hum like that of
an angry bee, ending in a sharp thud. The buccaneer gasped and
blood gushed from his open mouth. He sank to his knees, clutching
the black shaft that quivered in his breast. A yell of alarm went
up from his companions.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' shouted Strom.</p>

<p>'Picts!' bawled a pirate, lifting his bow and loosing blindly.
At his side a man moaned and went down with an arrow through his
throat.</p>

<p>'Take cover, you fools!' shrieked Zarono. From his vantage-point
he glimpsed painted figures moving in the bushes. One of the men on
the winding path fell back dying. The rest scrambled hastily down
among the rocks about the foot of the crag. They took cover
clumsily, not used to this kind of fighting. Arrows flickered from
bushes, splintering on the boulders. The men on the ledge lay prone
at full length.</p>

<p>'We're trapped!' Strom's face was pale. Bold enough with a deck
under his feet, this silent, savage warfare shook his ruthless
nerves.</p>

<p>'Conan said they feared this crag,' said Zarono. 'When night
falls the men must climb up here. We'll hold the crag. The Picts
won't rush us.'</p>

<p>'Aye!' mocked Conan above them. 'They won't climb the crag to
get at you, that's true. They'll merely surround it and keep you
here until you all die of thirst and starvation.'</p>

<p>'He speaks truth,' said Zarono helplessly. 'What shall we
do?'</p>

<p>'Make a truce with him,' muttered Strom. 'If any man can get us
out of this jam, he can. Time enough to cut his throat later.'
Lifting his voice he called: 'Conan, let's forget our feud for the
time being. You're in this fix as much as we are. Come down and
help us out of it.'</p>

<p>'How do you figure that?' retorted the Cimmerian. 'I have but to
wait until dark, climb down the other side of this crag and melt
into the forest. I can crawl through the line the Picts have thrown
around this hill, and return to the fort to report you all slain by
the savages&mdash;which will shortly be truth!'</p>

<p>Zarono and Strom stared at each other in pallid silence.</p>

<p>'But I'm not going to do that!' Conan roared. 'Not because I
have any love for you dogs, but because a white man doesn't leave
white men, even his enemies, to be butchered by Picts.'</p>

<p>The Cimmerian's tousled black head appeared over the crest of
the crag.</p>

<p>'Now listen closely: that's only a small band down there. I saw
them sneaking through the brush when I laughed, a while ago.
Anyway, if there had been many of them, every man at the foot of
the crag would be dead already. I think that's a band of
fleet-footed young men sent ahead of the main war-party to cut us
off from the beach. I'm certain a big war-band is heading in our
direction from somewhere.</p>

<p>'They've thrown a cordon around the west side of the crag, but I
don't think there are any on the east side. I'm going down on that
side and get in the forest and work around behind them. Meanwhile,
you crawl down the path and join your men among the rocks. Tell
them to sling their bows and draw their swords. When you hear me
yell, rush the trees on the west side of the clearing.'</p>

<p>'What of the treasure?'</p>

<p>'To hell with the treasure! We'll be lucky if we get out of here
with our heads on our shoulders.'</p>

<p>The black-maned head vanished. They listened for sounds to
indicate that Conan had crawled to the almost sheer eastern wall
and was working his way down, but they heard nothing. Nor was there
any sound in the forest. No more arrows broke against the rocks
where the sailors were hidden. But all knew that fierce black eyes
were watching with murderous patience. Gingerly Strom, Zarono and
the boatswain started down the winding path. They were halfway down
when the black shafts began to whisper around them. The boatswain
groaned and toppled limply down the slope, shot through the heart.
Arrows shivered on the helmets and breastplates of the chiefs as
they tumbled in frantic haste down the steep trail. They reached
the foot in a scrambling rush and lay panting among the boulders,
swearing breathlessly.</p>

<p>'Is this more of Conan's trickery?' wondered Zarono
profanely.</p>

<p>'We can trust him in this matter,' asserted Strom. 'These
barbarians live by their own particular code of honor, and Conan
would never desert men of his own complexion to be slaughtered by
people of another race. He'll help us against the Picts, even
though he plans to murder us himself&mdash;hark!'</p>

<p>A blood-freezing yell knifed the silence. It came from the woods
to the west, and simultaneously an object arched out of the trees,
struck the ground and rolled bouncingly towards the rocks&mdash;a
severed human head, the hideously painted face frozen in a snarl of
death.</p>

<p>'Conan's signal!' roared Strom, and the desperate freebooters
rose like a wave from the rocks and rushed headlong toward the
woods.</p>

<p>Arrows whirred out of the bushes, but their flight was hurried
and erratic; only three men fell. Then the wild men of the sea
plunged through the fringe of foliage and fell on the naked painted
figures that rose out of the gloom before them. There was a
murderous instant of panting, ferocious effort, hand-to-hand,
cutlasses beating down war-axes, booted feet trampling naked
bodies, and then bare feet were rattling through the bushes in
headlong flight as the survivors of that brief carnage quit the
fray, leaving seven still, painted figures stretched on the
blood-stained leaves that littered the earth. Further back in the
thickets sounded a thrashing and heaving, and then it ceased and
Conan strode into view, his lacquered hat gone, his coat torn, his
cutlass dripping in his hand.</p>

<p>'What now?' panted Zarono. He knew the charge had succeeded only
because Conan's unexpected attack on the rear of the Picts had
demoralized the painted men, and prevented them from falling back
before the rush. But he exploded into curses as Conan passed his
cutlass through a buccaneer who writhed on the ground with a
shattered hip.</p>

<p>'We can't carry him with us,' grunted Conan. 'It wouldn't be any
kindness to leave him to be taken alive by the Picts. Come on!'</p>

<p>They crowded close at his heels as he trotted through the trees.
Alone they would have sweated and blundered among the thickets for
hours before they found the beach-trail&mdash;if they had ever
found it. The Cimmerian led them as unerringly as if he had been
following a blazed path, and the rovers shouted with hysterical
relief as they burst suddenly upon the trail that ran westward.</p>

<p>'Fool!' Conan clapped a hand on the shoulder of a pirate who
started to break into a run, and hurled him back among his
companions. 'You'll burst your heart and fall within a thousand
yards. We're miles from the beach. Take an easy gait. We may have
to sprint the last mile. Save some of your wind for it. Come on,
now.'</p>

<p>He set off down the trail at a steady jog-trot; the seamen
followed him, suiting their pace to his.</p>

<hr>

<p>The sun was touching the waves of the western ocean. Tina stood
at the window from which Belesa had watched the storm.</p>

<p>'The setting sun turns the ocean to blood,' she said. 'The
carack's sail is a white fleck on the crimson waters. The woods are
already darkened with clustering shadows.'</p>

<p>'What of the seamen on the beach?' asked Belesa languidly. She
reclined on a couch, her eyes closed, her hands clasped behind her
head.</p>

<p>'Both camps are preparing their supper,' said Tina. 'They gather
driftwood and build fires. I can hear them shouting to one
another&mdash;what is that?'</p>

<p>The sudden tenseness in the girl's tone brought Belesa upright
on the couch. Tina grasped the window-sill, her face white.</p>

<p>'Listen! A howling, far off, like many wolves!'</p>

<p>'Wolves?' Belesa sprang up, fear clutching her heart. 'Wolves do
not hunt in packs at this time of the year&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, look!' shrilled the girl, pointing. 'Men are running out of
the forest!'</p>

<p>In an instant Belesa was beside her, staring wide-eyed at the
figures, small in the distance, streaming out of the woods.</p>

<p>'The sailors!' she gasped. 'Empty-handed! I see
Zarono&mdash;Strom&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Where is Conan?' whispered the girl.</p>

<p>Belesa shook her head.</p>

<p>'Listen! Oh, listen!' whimpered the child, clinging to her. 'The
Picts!'</p>

<p>All in the fort could hear it now&mdash;a vast ululation of mad
exultation and blood-lust, from the depths of the dark forest.</p>

<p>That sound spurred on the panting men reeling toward the
palisade.</p>

<p>'Hasten!' gasped Strom, his face a drawn mask of exhausted
effort. 'They are almost at our heels. My ship&mdash;'</p>

<p>'She is too far out for us to reach,' panted Zarono. 'Make for
the stockade. See, the men camped on the beach have seen us!'</p>

<p>He waved his arms in breathless pantomime, but the men on the
strand understood, and they recognized the significance of that
wild howling, rising to a triumphant crescendo. The sailors
abandoned their fires and cooking-pots and fled for the stockade
gate. They were pouring through it as the fugitives from the forest
rounded the south angle and reeled into the gate, a heaving,
frantic mob, half-dead from exhaustion. The gate was slammed with
frenzied haste, and sailors began to climb the firing-ledge, to
join the men-at-arms already there.</p>

<p>Belesa confronted Zarono.</p>

<p>'Where is Conan?'</p>

<p>The buccaneer jerked a thumb toward the blackening woods; his
chest heaved; sweat poured down his face. 'Their scouts were at our
heels before we gained the beach. He paused to slay a few and give
us time to get away.'</p>

<p>He staggered away to take his place on the firing-ledge, whither
Strom had already mounted. Valenso stood there, a somber,
cloak-wrapped figure, strangely silent and aloof. He was like a man
bewitched.</p>

<p>'Look!' yelped a pirate, above the deafening howling of the yet
unseen horde.</p>

<p>A man emerged from the forest and raced fleetly across the open
belt.</p>

<p>'Conan!'</p>

<p>Zarono grinned wolfishly.</p>

<p>'We're safe in the stockade; we know where the treasure is. No
reason why we shouldn't feather him with arrows now.'</p>

<p>'Nay!' Strom caught his arm. 'We'll need his sword! Look!'</p>

<p>Behind the fleet-footed Cimmerian a wild horde burst from the
forest, howling as they ran&mdash;naked Picts, hundreds and
hundreds of them. Their arrows rained about the Cimmerian. A few
strides more and Conan reached the eastern wall of the stockade,
bounded high, seized the points of the logs and heaved himself up
and over, his cutlass in his teeth. Arrows thudded venomously into
the logs where his body had just been. His resplendent coat was
gone, his white silk shirt torn and bloodstained.</p>

<p>'Stop them!' he roared as his feet hit the ground inside. 'If
they get on the wall, we're done for!'</p>

<p>Pirates, buccaneers and men-at-arms responded instantly, and a
storm of arrows and quarrels tore into the oncoming horde.</p>

<p>Conan saw Belesa, with Tina clinging to her hand, and his
language was picturesque.</p>

<p>'Get into the manor,' he commanded in conclusion. 'Their shafts
will arch over the wall&mdash;what did I tell you?' As a black
shaft cut into the earth at Belesa's feet and quivered like a
serpent-head, Conan caught up a longbow and leaped to the
firing-ledge. 'Some of you fellows prepare torches!' he roared,
above the rising clamor of the battle. 'We can't fight them in the
dark!'</p>

<p>The sun had sunk in a welter of blood; out in the bay the men
aboard the carack had cut the anchor chain and the Red Hand was
rapidly receding on the crimson horizon.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="stranger7" name="stranger7">VII. &mdash; MEN OF THE
WOODS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">NIGHT had fallen, but torches streamed across the
strand, casting the mad scene into lurid revealment. Naked men in
paint swarmed the beach; like waves they came against the palisade,
bared teeth and blazing eyes gleaming in the glare of the torches
thrust over the wall. Toucan feathers waved in black manes, and the
feathers of the cormorant and the sea-falcon. A few warriors, the
wildest and most barbaric of them all, wore shark's teeth woven in
their tangled locks.</p>

<p>The sea-land tribes had gathered from up and down the coast in
all directions to rid their country of the white-skinned invaders.
They surged against the palisade, driving a storm of arrows before
them, fighting into the teeth of the shafts and bolts that tore
into their masses from the stockade. Sometimes they came so close
to the wall they were hewing at the gate with their war-axes and
thrusting their spears through the loop-holes. But each time the
tide ebbed back without flowing over the palisade, leaving its
drift of dead. At this kind of fighting the freebooters of the sea
were at their stoutest; their arrows and bolts tore holes in the
charging horde, their cutlasses hewed the wild men from the
palisades they strove to scale.</p>

<p>Yet again and again the men of the woods returned to the
onslaught with all the stubborn ferocity that had been roused in
their fierce hearts.</p>

<p>'They are like mad dogs!' gasped Zarono, hacking downward at the
dark hands that grasped at the palisade points, the dark faces that
snarled up at him.</p>

<p>'If we can hold the fort until dawn they'll lose heart,' grunted
Conan, splitting a feathered skull with professional precision.
'They won't maintain a long siege. Look, they're falling back.'</p>

<p>The charge rolled back and the men on the wall shook the sweat
out of their eyes, counted their dead and took a fresh grasp on the
blood-slippery hilts of their swords. Like blood-hungry wolves,
grudgingly driven from a cornered prey, the Picts skulked back
beyond the ring of torches. Only the bodies of the slain lay before
the palisade.</p>

<p>'Have they gone?' Strom shook back his wet, tawny locks. The
cutlass in his fist was notched and red, his brawny bare arm was
splashed with blood.</p>

<p>'They're still out there,' Conan nodded toward the outer
darkness which ringed the circle of torches, made more intense by
their light. He glimpsed movements in the shadows; glitter of eyes
and the dull sheen of steel.</p>

<p>'They've drawn off for a bit, though,' he said. 'Put sentries on
the wall, and let the rest drink and eat. It's past midnight. We've
been fighting for hours without much interval.'</p>

<p>The chiefs clambered down from the ledges, calling their men
from the walls. A sentry was posted in the middle of each wall,
east, west, north and south, and a clump of men-at-arms were left
at the gate. The Picts, to reach the wall, would have to charge
across a wide, torchlit space, and the defenders could resume their
places long before the attackers could reach the palisade.</p>

<p>'Where's Valenso?' demanded Conan, gnawing a huge beef-bone as
he stood beside the fire the men had built in the center of the
compound. Pirates, buccaneers and henchmen mingled with each other,
wolfing the meat and ale the women brought them, and allowing their
wounds to be bandaged.</p>

<p>'He disappeared an hour ago,' grunted Strom. 'He was fighting on
the wall beside me, when suddenly he stopped short and glared out
into the darkness as if he saw a ghost. 'Look!' he croaked. 'The
black devil! I see him! Out there in the night!' Well, I could
swear I saw a figure moving among the shadows that was too tall for
a Pict. But it was just a glimpse and it was gone. But Valenso
jumped down from the firing-ledge and staggered into the manor like
a man with a mortal wound. I haven't seen him since.'</p>

<p>'He probably saw a forest-devil,' said Conan tranquilly. 'The
Picts say this coast is lousy with them. What I'm more afraid of is
fire-arrows. The Picts are likely to start shooting them at any
time. What's that? It sounded like a cry for help?'</p>

<hr>

<p>When the lull came in the fighting, Belesa and Tina had crept to
their window, from which they had been driven by the danger of
flying arrows. Silently they watched the men gather about the
fire.</p>

<p>'There are not enough men on the stockade,' said Tina.</p>

<p>In spite of her nausea at the sight of the corpses sprawled
about the palisade, Belesa was forced to laugh.</p>

<p>'Do you think you know more about wars and sieges than the
freebooters?' she chided gently.</p>

<p>'There should be more men on the walls,' insisted the child,
shivering. 'Suppose the black man came back?'</p>

<p>Belesa shuddered at the thought.</p>

<p>'I am afraid,' murmured Tina. 'I hope Strom and Zarono are
killed.'</p>

<p>'And not Conan?' asked Belesa curiously.</p>

<p>'Conan would not harm us,' said the child, confidently. 'He
lives up to his barbaric code of honor, but they are men who have
lost all honor.'</p>

<p>'You are wise beyond your years, Tina,' said Belesa, with the
vague uneasiness the precocity of the girl frequently roused in
her.</p>

<p>'Look!' Tina stiffened. 'The sentry is gone from the south wall!
I saw him on the ledge a moment ago; now he has vanished.'</p>

<p>From their window the palisade points of the south wall were
just visible over the slanting roofs of a row of huts which
paralleled that wall almost its entire length. A sort of
open-topped corridor, three or four yards wide, was framed by the
stockade and the back of the huts, which were built in a solid row.
These huts were occupied by the serfs.</p>

<p>'Where could the sentry have gone?' whispered Tina uneasily.</p>

<p>Belesa was watching one end of the hut-row which was not far
from a side door of the manor. She could have sworn she saw a
shadowy figure glide from behind the huts and disappear at the
door. Was that the vanished sentry? Why had he left the wall, and
why should he steal so subtly into the manor? She did not believe
it was the sentry she had seen, and a nameless fear congealed her
blood.</p>

<p>'Where is the Count, Tina?' she asked.</p>

<p>'In the great hall, my Lady. He sits alone at the table, wrapped
in his cloak and drinking wine, with a face gray as death.'</p>

<p>'Go and tell him what we have seen. I will keep watch from this
window, lest the Picts steal to the unguarded wall.'</p>

<p>Tina scampered away. Belesa heard her slippered feet pattering
along the corridor, receding down the stair. Then abruptly,
terribly, there rang out a scream of such poignant fear that
Belesa's heart almost stopped with the shock of it. She was out of
the chamber and flying down the corridor before she was aware that
her limbs were in motion. She ran down the stair&mdash;and halted
as if turned to stone.</p>

<p>She did not scream as Tina had screamed. She was incapable of
sound or motion. She saw Tina, was aware of the reality of small
hands grasping her frantically. But these were the only sane
realities in a scene of black nightmare and lunacy and death,
dominated by the monstrous, anthropomorphic shadow which spread
awful arms against a lurid, hell-fire glare.</p>

<hr>

<p>Out in the stockade Strom shook his head at Conan's
question.</p>

<p>'I heard nothing.'</p>

<p>'I did!' Conan's wild instincts were roused; he was tensed, his
eyes blazing. 'It came from the south wall, behind those huts!'</p>

<p>Drawing his cutlass he strode toward the palisade. From the
compound the wall on the south and the sentry posted there were not
visible, being hidden behind the huts. Strom followed, impressed by
the Cimmerian's manner.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the open space between the huts and wall Conan
halted, warily. The space was dimly lighted by torches flaring at
either corner of the stockade. And about mid-way of that natural
corridor a crumpled shape sprawled on the ground.</p>

<p>'Bracus!' swore Strom, running forward and dropping on one knee
beside the figure. 'By Mitra, his throat's been cut from ear to
ear!'</p>

<p>Conan swept the space with a quick glance, finding it empty save
for himself, Strom and the dead man. He peered through a loop-hole.
No living man moved within the ring of torch-light outside the
fort.</p>

<p>'Who could have done this?' he wondered.</p>

<p>'Zarono!' Strom sprang up, spitting fury like a wildcat, his
hair bristling, his face convulsed. 'He has set his thieves to
stabbing my men in the back! He plans to wipe me out by treachery!
Devils! I am plagued within and without!'</p>

<p>'Wait!' Conan reached a restraining hand. 'I don't believe
Zarono&mdash;'</p>

<p>But the maddened pirate jerked away and rushed around the end of
the hut-row, breathing blasphemies. Conan ran after him, swearing.
Strom made straight toward the fire by which Zarono's tall lean
form was visible as the buccaneer chief quaffed a jack of ale.</p>

<p>His amazement was supreme when the jack was dashed violently
from his hand, spattering his breastplate with foam, and he was
jerked around to confront the passion-distorted face of the pirate
captain.</p>

<p>'You murdering dog!' roared Strom. 'Will you slay my men behind
my back while they fight for your filthy hide as well as for
mine?'</p>

<p>Conan was hurrying toward them and on all sides men ceased
eating and drinking to stare in amazement.</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' sputtered Zarono.</p>

<p>'You've set your men to stabbing mine at their posts!' screamed
the maddened Barachan.</p>

<p>'You lie!' Smoldering hate burst into sudden flame.</p>

<p>With an incoherent howl Strom heaved up his cutlass and cut at
the buccaneer's head. Zarono caught the blow on his armored left
arm and sparks flew as he staggered back, ripping out his own
sword.</p>

<p>In an instant the captains were fighting like madmen, their
blades flaming and flashing in the firelight. Their crews reacted
instantly and blindly. A deep roar went up as pirates and
buccaneers drew their swords and fell upon each other. The men left
on the walls abandoned their posts and leaped down into the
stockade, blades in hand. In an instant the compound was a
battle-ground, where knotting, writhing groups of men smote and
slew in a blind frenzy. Some of the men-at-arms and serfs were
drawn into the melee, and the soldiers at the gate turned and
stared down in amazement, forgetting the enemy which lurked
outside.</p>

<p>It had all happened so quickly&mdash;smoldering passions
exploding into sudden battle&mdash;that men were fighting all over
the compound before Conan could reach the maddened chiefs. Ignoring
their swords he tore them apart with such violence that they
staggered backward, and Zarono tripped and fell headlong.</p>

<p>'You cursed fools, will you throw away all our lives?'</p>

<p>Strom was frothing mad and Zarono was bawling for assistance. A
buccaneer ran at Conan from behind and cut at his head. The
Cimmerian half turned and caught his arm, checking the stroke in
mid-air.</p>

<p>'Look, you fools!' he roared, pointing with his sword.</p>

<p>Something in his tone caught the attention of the battle-crazed
mob; men froze in their places, with lifted swords, Zarono on one
knee, and twisted their heads to stare. Conan was pointing at a
soldier on the firing-ledge. The man was reeling, arms clawing the
air, choking as he tried to shout. Suddenly he pitched headlong to
the ground and all saw the black arrow standing up between his
shoulders.</p>

<p>A cry of alarm rose from the compound. On the heels of the shout
came a clamor of blood-freezing screams, the shattering impact of
axes on the gate. Flaming arrows arched over the wall and stuck in
logs, and thin wisps of blue smoke curled upward. Then from behind
the huts that ranged the south wall came swift and furtive figures
racing across the compound.</p>

<p>'The Picts are in!' roared Conan.</p>

<p>Bedlam followed his shout. The freebooters ceased their feud,
some turned to meet the savages, some to spring to the wall.
Savages were pouring from behind the huts and they streamed over
the compound; their axes flashed against the cutlasses of the
sailors.</p>

<p>Zarono was struggling to his feet when a painted savage rushed
upon him from behind and brained him with a war-ax.</p>

<p>Conan, with a clump of sailors behind him, was battling with the
Picts inside the stockade, and Strom, with most of his men, was
climbing up on the firing-ledges, slashing at the dark figures
already swarming over the wall. The Picts, who had crept up
unobserved and surrounded the fort while the defenders were
fighting among themselves, were attacking from all sides. Valenso's
soldiers were clustered at the gate, trying to hold it against a
howling swarm of exultant demons.</p>

<p>More and more savages streamed from behind the huts, having
scaled the undefended south wall. Strom and his pirates were beaten
back from the other sides of the palisade and in an instant the
compound was swarming with naked warriors. They dragged down the
defenders like wolves; the battle revolved into swirling whirlpools
of painted figures surging about small groups of desperate white
men. Picts, sailors and henchmen littered the earth, stamped
underfoot by the heedless feet. Blood-smeared braves dived howling
into huts and the shrieks that rose from the interiors where women
and children died beneath the red axes rose above the din of the
battle. The men-at-arms abandoned the gate when they heard those
pitiful cries, and in an instant the Picts had burst it and were
pouring into the palisade at that point also. Huts began to go up
in flames.</p>

<p>'Make for the manor!' roared Conan, and a dozen men surged in
behind him as he hewed an inexorable way through the snarling
pack.</p>

<p>Strom was at his side, wielding his red cutlass like a
flail.</p>

<p>'We can't hold the manor,' grunted the pirate.</p>

<p>'Why not?' Conan was too busy with his crimson work to spare a
glance.</p>

<p>'Because&mdash;uh!' A knife in a dark hand sank deep in the
Barachan's back. 'Devil eat you, bastard!' Strom turned
staggeringly and split the savage's head to his teeth. The pirate
reeled and fell to his knees, blood starting from his lips.</p>

<p>'The manor's burning!' he croaked, and slumped over in the
dust.</p>

<p>Conan cast a swift look about him. The men who had followed him
were all down in their blood. The Pict gasping out his life under
the Cimmerian's feet was the last of the group which had barred his
way. All about him battle was swirling and surging, but for the
moment he stood alone. He was not far from the south wall. A few
strides and he could leap to the ledge, swing over and be gone
through the night. But he remembered the helpless girls in the
manor&mdash;from which, now, smoke was rolling in billowing masses.
He ran toward the manor.</p>

<p>A feathered chief wheeled from the door, lifting a war-axe, and
behind the racing Cimmerian lines of fleet-footed braves were
converging upon him. He did not check his stride. His downward
sweeping cutlass met and deflected the axe and split the skull of
its wielder. An instant later Conan was through the door and had
slammed and bolted it against the axes that splintered into the
wood.</p>

<p>The great hall was full of drifting wisps of smoke through which
he groped, half-blinded. Somewhere a woman was whimpering, little,
catchy, hysterical sobs of nerve-shattering horror. He emerged from
a whorl of smoke and stopped dead in his tracks, glaring down the
hall.</p>

<p>The hall was dim and shadowy with drifting smoke; the silver
candelabrum was overturned, the candles extinguished; the only
illumination was a lurid glow from the great fireplace and the wall
in which it was set, where the flames licked from burning floor to
smoking roof-beams. And limned against that lurid glare Conan saw a
human form swinging slowly at the end of a rope. The dead face
turned toward him as the body swung, and it was distorted beyond
recognition. But Conan knew it was Count Valenso, hanged to his own
roof-beam.</p>

<p>But there was something else in the hall. Conan saw it through
the drifting smoke&mdash;a monstrous black figure, outlined against
the hell-fire glare. That outline was vaguely human; but the shadow
thrown on the burning wall was not human at all.</p>

<p>'Crom!' muttered Conan aghast, paralyzed by the realization that
he was confronted with a being against which his sword was
helpless. He saw Belesa and Tina, clutched in each other's arms,
crouching at the bottom of the stair.</p>

<p>The black monster reared up, looming gigantic against the flame,
great arms spread wide; a dim face leered through the drifting
smoke, semi-human, demonic, altogether terrible&mdash;Conan
glimpsed the close-set horns, the gaping mouth, the peaked
ears&mdash;it was lumbering toward him through the smoke, and an
old memory woke with desperation.</p>

<p>Near the Cimmerian stood a massive silver bench, ornately
carven, once part of the splendor of Korzetta Castle. Conan grasped
it, heaved it high above his head.</p>

<p>'Silver and fire!' he roared in a voice like a clap of wind, and
hurled the bench with all the power of his iron muscles. Full on
the great black breast it crashed, a hundred pounds of silver
winged with terrific velocity. Not even the black one could stand
before such a missile. He was carried off his feet&mdash;hurtled
backward headlong into the open fireplace which was a roaring mouth
of flame. A horrible scream shook the hall, the cry of an unearthly
thing gripped suddenly by earthly death. The mantel cracked and
stones fell from the great chimney, half-hiding the black writhing
limbs at which the flames were eating in elemental fury. Burning
beams crashed down from the roof and thundered on the stones, and
the whole heap was enveloped by a roaring burst of fire.</p>

<p>Flames were racing down the stair when Conan reached it. He
caught up the fainting child under one arm and dragged Belesa to
her feet. Through the crackle and snap of the fire sounded the
splintering of the door under the war-axes.</p>

<p>He glared about, sighted a door opposite the stair-landing, and
hurried through it, carrying Tina and half-dragging Belesa, who
seemed dazed. As they came into the chamber beyond, a reverberation
behind them announced that the roof was falling in the hall.
Through a strangling wall of smoke Conan saw an open, outer door on
the other side of the chamber. As he lugged his charges through it,
he saw it sagged on broken hinges, lock and bolt snapped and
splintered as if by some terrific force.</p>

<p>'The black man came in by this door!' Belesa sobbed
hysterically. 'I saw him&mdash;but I did not know&mdash;'</p>

<p>They emerged into the fire-lit compound, a few feet from the
hut-row that lined the south wall. A Pict was skulking toward the
door, eyes red in the firelight, axe lifted. Turning the girl on
his arm away from the blow, Conan drove his cutlass through the
savage's breast, and then, sweeping Belesa off her feet, ran toward
the south wall, carrying both girls.</p>

<p>The compound was full of billowing smoke clouds that hid half
the red work going on there; but the fugitives had been seen. Naked
figures, black against the dull glare, pranced out of the smoke,
brandishing gleaming axes. They were still yards behind him when
Conan ducked into the spaces between the huts and the wall. At the
other end of the corridor he saw other howling shapes, running to
cut him off. Halting short, he tossed Belesa bodily to the
firing-ledge and leaped after her. Swinging her over the palisade
he dropped her into the sand outside, and dropped Tina after her. A
thrown axe crashed into a log by his shoulder, and then he too was
over the wall and gathering up his dazed and helpless charges. When
the Picts reached the wall the space before the palisade was empty
of all except the dead.</p>

<h2><a id="stranger8" name="stranger8">VIII. &mdash; A PIRATE
RETURNS TO THE SEA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DAWN was tingeing the dim waters with an old rose
hue. Far out across the tinted waters a fleck of white grew out of
the mist&mdash;a sail that seemed to hang suspended in the pearly
sky. On a bushy headland Conan the Cimmerian held a ragged cloak
over a fire of green wood. As he manipulated the cloak, puffs of
smoke rose upward, quivered against the dawn and vanished.</p>

<p>Belesa crouched near him, one arm about Tina.</p>

<p>'Do you think they'll see it and understand?'</p>

<p>'They'll see it, right enough,' he assured her. 'They've been
hanging off and on this coast all night, hoping to sight some
survivors. They're scared stiff. There's only half a dozen of them,
and not one can navigate well enough to sail from here to the
Barachan Isles. They'll understand my signals; it's the pirate
code. I'm telling them that the captains are dead and all the
sailors, and for them to come inshore and take us aboard. They know
I can navigate, and they'll be glad to ship under me; they'll have
to. I'm the only captain left.'</p>

<p>'But suppose the Picts see the smoke?' She shuddered, glancing
back over the misty sands and bushes to where, miles to the north,
a column of smoke stood up in the still air.</p>

<p>'They're not likely to see it. After I hid you in the woods I
crept back and saw them dragging barrels of wine and ale out of the
storehouses. Already most of them were reeling. They'll all be
lying around too drunk to move by this time. If I had a hundred men
I could wipe out the whole horde. Look! There goes a rocket from
the Red Hand! That means they're coming to take us off!'</p>

<p>Conan stamped out the fire, handed the cloak back to Belesa and
stretched like a great lazy cat. Belesa watched him in wonder. His
unperturbed manner was not assumed; the night of fire and blood and
slaughter, and the flight through the black woods afterward, had
left his nerves untouched. He was as calm as if he had spent the
night in feast and revel. Belesa did not fear him; she felt safer
than she had felt since she landed on that wild coast. He was not
like the freebooters, civilized men who had repudiated all
standards of honor, and lived without any. Conan, on the other
hand, lived according to the code of his people, which was barbaric
and bloody, but at least upheld its own peculiar standards of
honor.</p>

<p>'Do you think he is dead?' she asked, with seeming
irrelevancy.</p>

<p>He did not ask her to whom she referred.</p>

<p>'I believe so. Silver and fire are both deadly to evil spirits,
and he got a belly-full of both.'</p>

<p>Neither spoke of that subject again; Belesa's mind shrank from
the task of conjuring up the scene when a black figure skulked into
the great hall and a long-delayed vengeance was horribly
consummated.</p>

<p>'What will you do when you get back to Zingara?' Conan
asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head helplessly. 'I do not know. I have neither
money nor friends. I am not trained to earn my living. Perhaps it
would have been better had one of those arrows struck my
heart.'</p>

<p>'Do not say that, my Lady!' begged Tina. 'I will work for us
both!'</p>

<p>Conan drew a small leather bag from inside his girdle.</p>

<p>'I didn't get Tothmekri's jewels,' he rumbled. 'But here are
some baubles I found in the chest where I got the clothes I'm
wearing.' He spilled a handful of flaming rubies into his palm.
'They're worth a fortune, themselves.'</p>

<p>He dumped them back into the bag and handed it to her.</p>

<p>'But I can't take these&mdash;' she began.</p>

<p>'Of course you'll take them. I might as well leave you for the
Picts to scalp as to take you back to Zingara to starve,' said he.
'I know what it is to be penniless in a Hyborian land. Now in my
country sometimes there are famines; but people are hungry only
when there's no food in the land at all. But in civilized countries
I've seen people sick of gluttony while others were starving. Aye,
I've seen men fall and die of hunger against the walls of shops and
storehouses crammed with food. Sometimes I was hungry, too, but
then I took what I wanted at sword's-point. But you can't do that.
So you take these rubies. You can sell them and buy a castle, and
slaves and fine clothes, and with them it won't be hard to get a
husband, because civilized men all desire wives with these
possessions.'</p>

<p>'But what of you?'</p>

<p>Conan grinned and indicated the Red Hand drawing swiftly
inshore.</p>

<p>'A ship and a crew are all I want. As soon as I set foot on that
deck, I'll have a ship, and as soon as I can raise the Barachans
I'll have a crew. The lads of the Red Brotherhood are eager to ship
with me, because I always lead them to rare loot. And as soon as
I've set you and the girl ashore on the Zingaran coast, I'll show
the dogs some looting! Nay, nay, no thanks! What are a handful of
gems to me, when all the loot of the southern seas will be mine for
the grasping?'</p>
