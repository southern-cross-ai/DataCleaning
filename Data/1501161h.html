<h2>The Happy Couple<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Max Afford</h2>

<hr>

<h3>First published in The Australian Women's Weekly, 29 May &amp;
5 June, 1948</h3>

<hr>

<p>IT WAS JUST TEN O'CLOCK when Steve Harper laid down his novel
and stretched himself in the deep armchair. He was tired of the
printed word and it was too early for bed.</p>

<p>He was deliberating whether he would take a stroll when the
telephone on the small glass topped table at his elbow rang
sharply.</p>

<p>Harper reached across and lifted the receiver.</p>

<p>"Harper speaking..."</p>

<p>A deep voice, subdued but authoritative, answered. "This is
Inspector Conway, of the C.I.B., Mr. Harper. Sorry to disturb you.
But we understand that you act as legal adviser to Mr. George
Wingate?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Wingate is one of my closest friends."</p>

<p>"So we understood." There was a slight pause before the unseen
speaker continued. "Could you come over to his flat straight
away?"</p>

<p>Little wrinkles of bewilderment formed between Harper's eyes.
"Of course, if it's necessary. But why...?"</p>

<p>The deep official voice said levelly, "Mr. Wingate committed
suicide in his own living-room about half an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Suicide!" The shocked, blank amazement that dulled Steve's mind
was concentrated into that sharp exclamation. "Of course, I'll come
right away...now!" Slowly he replaced the receiver. He did not
notice how badly his hand was trembling.</p>

<p>It was not until ten minutes later, when he sat behind the wheel
of his car, purring over the wet, dark roads, that the full
realisation of the tragedy came to him.</p>

<p>George Wingate...suicide!</p>

<p>It seemed ridiculous to mention the words in the same
breath&mdash;they were poles apart...night and day, black and
white, cowardice and courage! There must be some mistake!</p>

<p>Again and again his mind hammered that point home, yet in spite
of this some whispering caution told him it was true that the
natural order of things had been reversed, and that bluff, hearty
George Wingate had indeed taken his own life!</p>

<p>Steve had known Wingate since their days at school; they had
grown up together and chosen different professions while remaining
the best of friends.</p>

<p>It was the attraction of opposites&mdash;quiet, studious Steve
Harper had made an admirable foil for the happy-go-lucky, clowning
Wingate.</p>

<p>Life for this big man had seemed one long chuckle; one never saw
him without a smile or a cheerful word on his lips. At parties and
dinners it was always Wingate who kept the festivities going with
some funny story or crazy stunt.</p>

<p>People said he was irresponsible, a child who had never grown
up, yet there were few who were not charmed by his personality and
his immense and overwhelming zest for life.</p>

<p>Matrimony had sobered George Wingate but little.</p>

<p>When he married shy Olga Martino, the half-Russian, half-Italian
dancing teacher, people were amazed at the union. Olga, with her
pale, slavonic face and her sombre, brooding eyes, seemed an oddly
assorted mate for her intensely extroverted husband.</p>

<p>Steve, who had been best man at the wedding, secretly questioned
this union of substance and pale shadow, and at the same time
offered up a secret prayer that neither was making a mistake.</p>

<p>And his prayer was answered. After twelve months, the couple
seemed happier than ever.</p>

<p>True, there were occasions when Wingate's clowning and his love
of practical jokes aroused traces of irritation in his wife's
serious, reserved nature. But these were trivialities, to be
expected during the process of mutual adjustment.</p>

<p>Practically every person envied George Wingate, this prosperous,
cheerful man who found twenty-four hours too short for his
harum-scarum course through life.</p>

<p>And now...</p>

<p>Harper gave a little shiver and pressed the foot-brake, easing
the single-seater gently to the pavement. Climbing out, he stood
before the lighted block of flats for some moments.</p>

<p>From one of the windows floated dance music from a radio;
shadows cast on the blind of another showed a party in progress. It
was an incongruous setting for a violent death.</p>

<p>Even now, as he crossed the entrance hall and rang the bell of
the ground-floor flat, he had a half-conviction that it was some
fantastic error, that George, red-faced and ebullient, would answer
the door, clap him on the back, and ask him to name his drink.</p>

<p>But it was a stranger who ushered him inside, a stocky,
firm-jawed individual in quiet clothes who introduced himself as
Inspector Conway. The hushed silence in the flat told its own story
as the two men stood there together in the little entrance
hall.</p>

<p>Conway said quietly: "Good of you to come, Mr. Harper. Mrs.
Wingate asked me to ring you. It's a terrible blow to her." The
Inspector's eyes slid toward an adjoining door. "The whole thing
happened so suddenly. He was entertaining some friends at bridge
when it happened. I've sent them home..."</p>

<p>They passed from the tiny hall into the living-room. Harper had
just time to take in the two card tables and the scattered cards
when he saw Olga standing at the far end of the room.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of tragedy Olga Wingate remained one of the
most beautiful women Harper had ever seen. A long green frock
emphasised the ebon sheen of her smooth hair. Her eyes were so
large as to shadow her long face.</p>

<p>She gave a soft, choking cry and ran to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Steve...Steve..." She clung to him, and, comforting, he
placed one arm about her shoulders. "I can't believe it&mdash;I
can't! Not what they say...about George...of all people..." He
could feel her thin strong body trembling and twitching under his
arm.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" asked Harper quietly.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as though conscious of the Inspector's eyes on her,
Olga moved away from Harper. She seemed embarrassed at her
outburst, and now, as she strove for control, her tone was almost
wooden.</p>

<p>"We had the Morrisons and the Traceys for dinner. Afterwards, I
suggested bridge...you know how Emily Tracey loves a game! George
was in great spirits..."</p>

<p>For a moment, her level tone faltered. "He had drunk a little
too much at dinner," she went on, "and was more...more amusing than
ever..."</p>

<p>She paused. No one spoke.</p>

<p>"We...we played bridge until nine-thirty. Then George was dummy.
Major Morrison offered him a cigarette. George took it and rose
from the table. He said he had something to show us and walked into
the dining-room. He wasn't gone more than a minute. Suddenly we
heard a shot. We ran into the room...and there...on the
floor..."</p>

<p>The words choked suddenly in Olga Wingate's throat. She covered
her face with her hands and sank into a chair, rocking backwards
and forwards.</p>

<p>"Oh, Steve," she moaned. "Steve, you've got to help me! Why did
he do it? Why...?"</p>

<p>Inspector Conway attempted clumsily gentle words. Harper stood
miserably, shocked by the death of his friend, horrified by the
patent grief of this lovely woman. He made a mental effort to
clutch at something tangible in the dark chaos of his mind.</p>

<p>"He...he wasn't worried over
anything...finance...business...?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingate shook her head. She dried her eyes on a small
handkerchief and made another effort at control. "I know of
nothing, Steve...nothing at all unless..."</p>

<p>"Unless what?"</p>

<p>"It was some secret anxiety...something so serious he wouldn't
confide in me...for fear of upsetting me..." She broke off with a
quick, foreign gesture. "Yet that is silly! What could be more
upsetting than what has happened...?"</p>

<p>Harper turned from the woman to face the Inspector.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is suicide?"</p>

<p>Conway nodded. "No doubt about that, sir," he replied. "If there
was anything to suggest...the other, well, it might make the
business something less of a puzzle! But there isn't&mdash;the gun
was still in his hand when he dropped."</p>

<p>Steve reached for his cigarette case. "Might I have a look?" he
murmured. "He was my best friend, you know..."</p>

<p>"Of course. This way..."</p>

<p>The Inspector turned. Harper gave a brief glance at the woman
huddled in the chair, then he turned and followed the official
through the folding doors into the dining-room. Inside, Conway was
removing a sheet from the sprawled figure on the floor.</p>

<p>"It's not very pretty," he said briefly. "The charge got him
full in the face."</p>

<p>Steve Harper was not an emotional man. Years in his chosen
profession had taught him to mask his feelings very successfully.
But as he stood looking down at the body of his friend, his throat
closed and a sudden mist blurred his sight. He gave a shudder of
repulsion and turned away.</p>

<p>Conway muttered, "He must have held the gun about twelve inches
from his face." He gestured to the table. "There's the weapon."</p>

<p>Steve glanced at it. A black automatic about five inches long,
it seemed little more than a toy. Ridiculously small to have done
this majestic act; taken the life of one the world could ill afford
to lose. Yet, behind this tiny weapon had been a man's will. The
will to die.</p>

<p>Almost as though divining his thoughts, the Inspector said
quietly. "I'd call this one of the bravest suicides I know..."</p>

<p>Steve said bitterly, "Is there such a thing as a brave
suicide?"</p>

<p>Conway nodded. "Imagine staring at that barrel and slowly
pressing the trigger! That takes courage. Or lack of imagination!
Yet, from what I hear of this man..." His voice slowed,
stopped.</p>

<p>Harper was watching him, reading faint and puzzled doubt in the
grey eyes, seeing it etched in the wrinkled forehead.</p>

<p>"Something troubling you about this, Inspector?" he asked
quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"But you said it was straight out?"</p>

<p>"In some ways it is," Conway told him. "But in others...Look
here, Mr. Harper, does a man commit suicide on the spur of the
moment, like this? What sort of chap is it who laughs and talks
with his guests one minute and takes his own life the next? And
why? Where's the motive?"</p>

<p>A slight sound at the door made them turn suddenly. Olga Wingate
stood there, her eyes fixed on the body of her husband, that lovely
oval face a pale mask of horror. But in that moment Steve Harper
had a curious fleeting sense that the expression on the woman's
face was not caused by the sight of that disfigured thing on the
carpet.</p>

<p style="margin-right:1%; float:right; padding-left: 20px">
<img alt="" src="1501161h-images/HappyCouple-1.jpg">
</p>

<p>Something else had brought terror to that face, terror that was
tinged with...yes...anxiety.</p>

<p>Olga Wingate was afraid!</p>

<p>But even as he sought that ivory mask for confirmation, dark
lashes veiled the eyes, and Mrs. Wingate turned her face away. She
said huskily:</p>

<p>"Steve, would you...attend to everything? You know so much more
about these things...I'm going to lie down..."</p>

<p>She moved slowly from the room, one hand outstretched as though
feeling blindly. Behind her, Inspector Conway was replacing the
sheet over the body on the floor.</p>

<p>They buried George Wingate on the following day.</p>

<p>After the first shock, Harper's cold, analytical self was once
more in control. And during the twenty four hours that passed
between death and burial, he had driven his mind furiously.</p>

<p>Something was wrong! Something he had sensed in Mrs. Wingate's
face as she stood there listening to Inspector Conway's doubts.</p>

<p>Yet whatever way his thoughts turned, back they came to the one
indisputable fact&mdash;George Wingate had risen from that card
table, walked into his own dining-room and, without pause or qualm,
shot himself through the head with an automatic pistol!</p>

<p>"Almost as though he were hypnotised," muttered Harper, then
smiled wryly at his own imaginings. People are not hypnotised into
suicide, especially people like George Wingate.</p>

<p>The funeral was a melancholy business. After the ceremony, the
mourners returned to the flat, impregnated with that subtle perfume
of banked flowers hanging heavily like the very aura of death.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingate retired to her room to rest after the ordeal.
Friends drifted about in an aimless, subdued manner, talking hushed
trivialities, inwardly questioning when they might with decency
slip away.</p>

<p>Steve was relieved when the officiating minister brought him a
message that Mrs. Wingate would like to speak to him, and that she
would be waiting in her husband's study.</p>

<p>Harper slipped thankfully away from the living-room. But
Wingate's apartment, with its sporting prints and the college oar
decorating one corner, was empty. Steve did not linger
there&mdash;memories were too vivid. He would probably find Olga in
her own room.</p>

<p>He crossed the corridor and tapped softly. There was no answer.
He tapped again, then pushed open the door and peered inside.</p>

<p>Olga Wingate's bedroom was small, faintly scented, and bright
with satin cushions. But stronger than the perfume was the smell of
burning that sent Harper's eyes to the large bronze ashtray on the
small table near the bed.</p>

<p>But it was empty and polished clean. His wandering gaze moved to
the fireplace, flickered, halted.</p>

<p>The grate was half filled with charred paper, gently rustling
and faintly smoking.</p>

<p>Steve's first emotion was surprise. In this over-tidy, ordered
room, that blackened bundle in the grate was as incongruous as a
pair of hobnailed boots.</p>

<p>After surprise came curiosity. Was this the reason Olga had gone
to her room? What was it that must be burned without further
delay?</p>

<p>Quickly, he crossed to the grate and poking among the charred
fragments that flaked under his groping fingers found a small wedge
of paper that had escaped destruction. It was obviously the corner
of a letter; he could make out a few isolated words in bold
masculine handwriting.</p>

<p>Harper drew a sudden sharp breath, every latent suspicion
crystallising sharply in his mind. He turned over the small wedge
of paper. Again he read the words.</p>

<p>"...cannot fail. Ever your own...Mischa."</p>

<p>At the sound of footsteps he thrust the fragment of paper into
his pocket and moved quickly from the fireplace.</p>

<p>Olga Wingate entered. Seeing him, she stopped short and her
mouth set thinly. She could not quite control her voice when she
spoke.</p>

<p>"Steve! Whatever are you doing in here? I said George's
study..." Abruptly she paused and made a helpless little gesture.
"Oh, what does it matter?" The words were heavy with dull
resignation. "What does anything matter now?"</p>

<p>"I waited for you in the study," Harper said quietly. "When you
didn't come, I took the liberty of coming here. I hope you don't
mind."</p>

<p>"Mind?" She came forward, completely at ease now. "What a
strange thing to say, Steve. We're friends. Why should I mind?"</p>

<p>He countered her question with another. "What was it you wanted,
Olga?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingate crossed to a small cabinet, opened a drawer, and
took out a bunch of keys.</p>

<p>"These belonged to George," she said quietly. "You'll find his
private papers in the bureau in his study. If you'd relieve me of
the business responsibility..."</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"Later, I'd like to have a talk with you about...myself."</p>

<p>"Yourself?" Steve asked quickly.</p>

<p>Olga had taken a cigarette from the silver box. Now she was
lighting it, eyes on the match flame, avoiding his face. "I think
I'll go away, Steve. Travel and try to forget."</p>

<p>"There's no reason why you shouldn't. You're a rich woman
now."</p>

<p>Now the dark eyes came up, soft with anguished appeal.
"Steve...!"</p>

<p>Harper said coldly. "Well, it's true, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Those long, beautifully shaped hands made another gesture, this
time of distaste. "You should know that better than I. And I don't
think this is the time to discuss such things. I...I'd rather not
talk about them."</p>

<p>In that moment, Steve hated her.</p>

<p>Not trusting himself to speak, he nodded and turned away. He was
conscious that Olga was watching him, that she had glimpsed the
expression that crossed his face. He was aware that she was coming
to him and turned as he felt her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Steve..." her voice was gentle, soft as her swimming eyes.
"Steve, I know it's been a terrible shock to you. But don't take it
out on me. Try to remember that I'm suffering, too." She touched
her eyes with a damp handkerchief. "I was...very fond of him, too,
you know."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry..." Steve wanted to say more, but the words wouldn't
come. "Is there anything else?'</p>

<p>"Yes." Olga moved back to the bureau and took out that wicked
toy-like automatic. Holding it limply, she returned.</p>

<p>"Inspector Conway gave me this yesterday. I want you to take it
away&mdash;where I can never see it again!" And as he reached for
it, she drew a sharp breath of protest.</p>

<p>"Steve, be careful! Conway tells me it's still loaded! I
couldn't bear another...accident..."</p>

<p>Back in Wingate's study, Steve Harper lit a cigarette and sat
down in his friend's sagging armchair, watching the film of smoke
rise and curl in the air.</p>

<p>His mind was busy with that fragment of paper and the scrawled
words which already he knew by heart.</p>

<p>"...cannot fail. Ever your own...Mischa."</p>

<p>Inspector Conway had asked, "Where's the motive?" Was it here in
black and white? This man...the unknown Mischa and Olga Wingate.
Mischa, who signed himself 'Ever your own'"?</p>

<p>Here was logic at last. Olga had sought another man and Wingate,
proud to the last, had carried on with the enormous pretence, so
that not even his closest friend suspected the truth.</p>

<p>When had Wingate found out? Perhaps he had discovered the
letters&mdash;passionate letters which Olga had burnt in a frenzy
of guilt and remorse.</p>

<p>Steve could imagine the scene; Wingate incredulous, still
half-trusting, willing to be convinced; Olga sullen, evasive, until
some blundering remark touched her on the raw. Then flashing out
with the truth, bitter, seeking only to wound.</p>

<p>But how long had this been going on? Weeks...months...until at
last George Wingate could bear it no longer and rising that night
from the bridge table...</p>

<p>Harper moved irritably in his chair. No! He sought logic and
found only melodrama Olga might have acted like that but never her
husband. And there were too many loose ends.</p>

<p>Wingate, a fundamentally simple man, could never hide his true
feelings. Elated or depressed, the whole world knew of it. And
witnesses had sworn that on the night of the tragedy Wingate had
been unusually happy, without a care.</p>

<p>Yet, less than ten minutes later...</p>

<p>Groping in his pocket. Harper found the tiny wedge of paper and
scrutinised it afresh. If calligraphy was any guide, this Mischa
would be a bold, swaggering fellow. There was power and
ruthlessness in the thick, heavy downstrokes, arrogance in the
flowing signature.</p>

<p>And what was the significance of the words "Cannot fail..."?</p>

<p>Something jingled in his fingers. For the first time he became
aware that he was still holding the keys of George's desk, which
Olga had given him.</p>

<p>Crushing out his cigarette, Steve rose and crossed to the heavy,
old fashioned desk with its ribbed roller top. He set about the
task of finding individual keys to fit the locks of the drawers
down either side.</p>

<p>One by one the compartments yielded their
contents&mdash;business correspondence, cheque-book stubs, bills
unpaid and bills receipted, and once (subtle epitaph to his late
friend) a packet of funny picture postcards.</p>

<p>Among this collection was a small square of pasteboard that had
obviously accompanied a gift from Olga. Steve glanced at the prim,
well-formed handwriting before he put the card aside.</p>

<p>"George, darling&mdash;here's something after your own heart. I
picked it up this afternoon in town. You can trot it out to show
the Morrisons to-night. Love, Olga."</p>

<p>The significance of this message did not dawn on Harper until a
few moments later. He picked up the card and read the lines
again.</p>

<p>Then he shook his head. No erring wife had written in that tone
of gentle tolerance. Certainly not Olga, who was smoulderingly slow
to forget an injury or a quarrel.</p>

<p>If this gift had changed hands a few hours before the bridge
party yesterday&mdash;and the reference to the Morrisons proved
that beyond all doubt&mdash;then Steve's theory regarding an
estrangement was completely false!</p>

<p>Shrugging, Harper leaned forward and fitted a key into the last
drawer.</p>

<p>Inside were more letters: letters and photographs and cuttings
from magazines, advertisements relating to tricks and novelties
such as might gladden the heart of a schoolboy.</p>

<p>Steve spilt the contents across the desk top and thumbed through
them one by one. The folded circular was almost at the bottom of
the pile.</p>

<p>His mind busy with a dozen recollections of the past, now
brought vividly to the surface by a snapshot or a creased
invitation card, Steve's eyes flicked mechanically over the black
lettering.</p>

<p>Next moment he stiffened and with fingers that seemed suddenly
unmanageable unfolded the circular and spread it wide on the
desk...</p>

<p>"Oh, no..." said Steve Harper.</p>

<p>And then, as he read the printed words a second
time..."Yes...yes!" And now incredulity had given way to a
sickening realisation and a black, bitter rage that caused the
words on the circular to waver and swim.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Then, very deliberately, he folded the printed paper and rose to
his feet. He knew also exactly where to look for the last piece in
this crazy jigsaw. Yet no longer crazy, but now brutally,
ruthlessly clear with all the logic of perfect planning.</p>

<p>He went straight back to Olga Wingate's bedroom, paused outside
the door and knocked.</p>

<p>There was no answer. Without further summons, Steve entered,
closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>Where would she have hidden it? What, in this softly silken
room, offered the best chance of concealment?</p>

<p>His mind suggested a dozen places, but now he must think not
with his own brain, but with Olga's. Where would this strange
woman, having committed a murder with an unsuspected weapon, hide
the instrument?</p>

<p>An unsuspected weapon, he thought again.</p>

<p>Therefore the hiding-place could not be complicated, lest this
very fact arouse suspicion. It must be somewhere obvious, yet not
too obvious. A handbag, or a drawer, or even the pocket of a
jacket...</p>

<p>Steve crossed to the wardrobe against the wall and swung open
the door. A dozen frocks, neatly arranged on hangers, faced
him.</p>

<p>His exploring fingers riffled through them, disturbing a breath
of perfume that hung on the quiet air. They yielded nothing. He
closed the door sharply and moved to the bureau near the bed. But
five minutes' careful investigation there proved as fruitless as
before.</p>

<p>As he slammed the last drawer shut. Steve passed a worried hand
over his face, to find it wet with perspiration.</p>

<p>Then he saw the handbag.</p>

<p>It was square and black and shiny; it had a catch like a small
coiled snake which defied his trembling fingers for a few seconds.
Then the lid snapped back and he emptied its varied contents on to
the counterpane.</p>

<p>And there, among the phial of nail polish, the lipstick, the
mirror and compact, the small silver comb, and a dozen other
trivial articles, there it was.</p>

<p>At first glance it appeared to be a small automatic, twin of the
murderous weapon he still carried in his pocket. Steve picked it up
and, tightening his grip on the butt, pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>From the stocky barrel, a fat cigarette shot out, hit the bed
and ricocheted to the floor. With the pressure of his finger came
another and another until half a dozen cigarettes lay scattered on
the carpet.</p>

<p>Still holding the toy, Steve reached in his pocket and flicked
open the folded circular and read it for the third time. In bold
type, it was headed, "Astounding Novelty! Surprise Your Friends!" A
glowing description of the novelty followed.</p>

<p>"The Peerless Automatic Cigarette Case," Steve read on, "is the
exact size, shape, and weight of the genuine article. Fool your
friends! Harmless yet effective! The terror of Housebreakers! The
Surprise of a Lifetime!</p>

<p>"Astound your friends with the Ching Lung Soo bullet trick! Hold
the cigarette case about twelve inches from your face, press the
trigger, and catch the cigarette in your mouth..."</p>

<p>Steve Harper's fingers closed convulsively round the paper, his
mind a background of flickering words and dancing images!</p>

<p>"George, darling, here's something...I picked it up this
afternoon in town...show the Morrisons tonight..."; George,
slightly drunk, wandering happily into the living room...;
"...exact size, shape and weight of the genuine article...";
"...hold the cigarette case about twelve inches from your
face..."</p>

<p>"Steve!"</p>

<p>Olga Wingate stood just inside the door, watching him. For a
moment she had eyes for nothing save that pale, set face, then she
glanced down at his right hand.</p>

<p>Harper said nothing, but stood watching her...watching those
slim fingers crawl suddenly to her throat, almost as though she
felt the shadow of the noose fall across it. She seemed to swallow
before she spoke.</p>

<p>"So...you know...?"</p>

<p>Harper said, "You did this thing. You and this man, Mischa." It
was a statement.</p>

<p>Their glances met, locked. For five dragging seconds, the
tension stretched. Then she said quietly, "What are you going to do
about it?"</p>

<p>Steve Harper slipped the toy cigarette-case into his pocket. "I
have my duty, not only as friend, but as a citizen. I am going to
see you convicted of the crime of deliberate and calculated
murder!"</p>

<p>Olga Wingate merely looked at him and about that lovely mouth
there was gentle amusement. She came forward, sat down on the bed,
and tapped the counterpane.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Steve," she said.</p>

<p>His lean body tightened in an instinctive shrinking.</p>

<p>"You're evil," he whispered, "evil! You ought to be
destroyed!"</p>

<p>Olga Wingate said calmly, "You're making a fool of yourself,
Steve. It's all right to do it here. I don't mind! But watch what
you do...outside. Are you really prepared to have me arrested? To
go into court with a story about a ridiculous toy that committed
murder?"</p>

<p>"You changed that toy...for the real thing!"</p>

<p>That pale, oval face, child-like, bland, innocent, stared at
him. "But why should I? We were so happy together, George and I.
Everyone knew that! And what have you to prove otherwise? A few
words on a corner of a letter...words which I could explain in a
dozen innocent ways!"</p>

<p>Harper said bitterly: "And how would you explain the
substitution of weapons?"</p>

<p>"Substitution? What substitution? I know nothing of that, Steve.
But I think it quite likely that George confused the real thing for
the toy. So would the jury&mdash;particularly as I can bring
forward witnesses to prove that George had been...drinking that
night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingate stood up. Calm, poised, confident, she put out her
hand. "I think you'd better let me have that stupid toy before it
causes more trouble."</p>

<p>Steve Harper knew&mdash;and the realisation sickened
him&mdash;that this woman spoke the truth. What could he bring
forward to support his story? Suspicions&mdash;and a fragment of
charred paper. A clever lawyer could explain those scattered words
in a dozen innocent ways.</p>

"<i>I think you'd better let me have<br>
that stupid toy," Olga said,<br>
holding out her hand.</i></p>

<p>And Olga Wingate would have more than expert legal advice. Steve
could already visualise her appearance in court; she would choose
the blackest mourning to set off the pale, tragic face and the dark
eyes, luminous with unshed tears.</p>

<p>"Well, Stephen?"</p>

<p>His fingers closed around the article in his pocket. He said
quietly: "If I give this thing back to you, will you promise me one
thing?"</p>

<p>"What do you ask?"</p>

<p>"That you will get out of this country and never set foot in it
again as long as you live!"</p>

<p>Olga Wingate nodded and her expression was almost sedate.</p>

<p>"Mischa has made all arrangements for that. I told you I wanted
to travel...and forget." She held out her hand. "Now, may I have
George's little toy?"</p>

<p>Because there was nothing else to do, he handed it across. Olga
took it, balanced it carefully in her hand.</p>

<p>Steve asked abruptly: "When did you begin to hate him?"</p>

<p>"After we were married. Not long after&mdash;two months, perhaps
three. I realised what a bitter mistake I'd made. It was like being
married to a mountebank&mdash;a great fool who acted like a child.
It was all so different from what I expected..."</p>

<p>She paused. Harper did not speak. "It was, I think, the shame of
it all. When we visited friends they expected him to perform for
their amusement, and he, poor fool, loved it. The life of the
party&mdash;but what kind of a life for me?"</p>

<p>"And Mischa?"</p>

<p>"Leave Mischa out of this!"</p>

<p>Steve said bitterly, "Because he evolved this plan of
murder?"</p>

<p>"It was my plan&mdash;all mine! Mischa and I were
together&mdash;in the ballet! Those wonderful days! I'm going to
live them over again now."</p>

<p>Now the fire was back in her face, the color of it in her
cheeks, the blaze of it in her dark eyes. She came forward and
stood over him.</p>

<p>"You want to know the whole story? I bought this toy for George
and persuaded him to learn the trick of catching the cigarettes in
his mouth. Mischa's only part was to get the automatic and load
it.</p>

<p>"Last night I changed the toys before we started the bridge
game. I knew George could never resist showing off in front of
friends. He'd been drinking at dinner and his mind wasn't very
clear. So he left the bridge table, walked into the dining-room,
and picked up the loaded automatic."</p>

<p>A cynical smile curled on her lips. "He didn't even know the
difference!"</p>

<p>She threw back her head and chuckled.</p>

<p>"Imagine it, Stephen! George picks up the automatic. He must
have one practice shot before the performance. So he raises the
weapon and holds it so..." She held the object in her hand level
with her own dark eyes.</p>

<p>"And then, poor clown, he pulls the trigger...like this!"</p>

<p>In that closed room, the detonation shook the pictures on the
walls. The body of Olga Wingate dropped to the floor, the automatic
still clutched in her fingers. The faint reek of burnt powder hung
on the still air.</p>

<p>Stephen Harper said softly: "He didn't even know the difference,
Olga..."</p>

<p>And then suddenly he choked, feeling very sick. Rising, he moved
blindly from that silken room and the battered thing lying on the
floor.</p>

<p>In George Wingate's study it was quite five minutes before he
could steady his hand sufficiently to lift the receiver and dial a
number.</p>

<p>The voice of Inspector Conway sounded at the other end, a quiet,
authoritative voice, a little shocked out of its calmness as Harper
made his explanation.</p>

<p>"It all happened so suddenly, Inspector. I had given Mrs.
Wingate her husband's automatic and, abruptly, she turned it on
herself. Wingate's death probably played on her mind. You see...I
believe they were one of the world's happiest couples."</p>
