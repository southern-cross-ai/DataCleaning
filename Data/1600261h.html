  <p class="blurb"><i>A cry pierced the night, as the dwellers of Morris Street
  first felt the poison of an ancient fear&mdash;a horror from the homeland that
  they had foresworn. And the Devil, with unholy glee, loosed his killer to
  strike down Doc Turner, the champion of the oppressed.</i></p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">THE pushcarts were gone from Morris Street. It was very
  late, so late that even Andrew Turner's long day was done, and he was turning
  the key in the door of his ancient drugstore.</p>

  <p>A three-car "El" train thundered by overhead, the yellow oblongs of its
  lighted windows projecting duplicates of themselves on the debris-strewn
  sidewalk. Doc turned with a weary sigh, shambled off toward the hall bedroom
  that had been his home for more years than he cared to remember. His was a
  bent, feeble figure in his shabby overcoat, lonely on that deserted slum
  street.</p>

  <p>The kindly night cloaked with dimness the tenement's drab facades that he
  passed, so that they appeared not quite as stained, not quite as decrepit as
  daylight would reveal them. But the night could not make anything except a
  foul miasma out of the smell of stale food and stale bodies that is the odor
  of poverty. The old druggist turned a corner, neared the center of the
  block.</p>

  <p>A scream shrilled out of the night; a long, high scream of agony and
  grief! It twisted Doc to the broken-stepped stoop of the tenement from which
  it had come. It cut off, sharply, but he was already up those steps, was
  through the vestibule and in a dark, noisome hall.</p>

  <p>Then sound came again to guide Doc Turner up uncarpeted stairs and to a
  splintered door that was paintless and drab in the glimmer of a pinpoint gas
  jet.</p>

  <p>Only one with the lion-hearted courage his feeble frame enclosed would
  have dashed so unhesitatingly toward the source of that sound. For it was no
  longer a scream.</p>

  <p>It was a laugh, more fearful than any scream, a screeching laugh that held
  in it no gaiety, no reason even, but some un-nameable quality that melted the
  marrow of its hearers and chilled their spines with ancestral terror.</p>

  <p>Doc rattled the doorknob. The door was locked. He rapped. The laugh went
  on unchecked.</p>

  <p>The panel was so thin that even the old man's fist could smash a hole
  through it. He reached in, turned the key in the lock, went through into a
  room that was living room and kitchen combined. A whistling gas jet fitfully
  lit a table strewn with gay-colored tissue paper, with green-covered wire and
  green cloth cut in the form of leaves. A huge pasteboard box on the floor was
  half-filled with artificial flowers.</p>

  <p>He could see no one. The laugh came through another door, half-open, next
  to the broken stove.</p>

  <p>The room beyond was brightly lighted. It held a bed, and a crib crudely
  hammered together out of soapbox wood. A woman stood above that crib, and the
  mad laugh spewed out of her twisted, colorless lips. Her hair straggled
  wildly about her gaunt face, but not so wildly as her eyes stared into the
  crib as she laughed.</p>

  <p>Doc got to the little bed and looked down into it. He saw a six-month old
  infant, and he did not have to look twice to know it was stark in death.</p>

  <p>It lay wholly naked atop the snow-white sheets, its tiny sleeping garment
  bundled in a corner as the distrait mother had ripped it from the child to
  search for the injury that had taken it from her. The small body lay
  peacefully, not doubled up from a convulsion. There was no blue tinge of
  cyanosis at its finger and toe tips to show that heart failure had taken it.
  There was nothing to show how death had come... The only mark was a tiny
  scratch under the pink shell of its wee ear.</p>

  <p>That was not a scratch! It was a puncture, triangular in outline. It went
  deep, but it had not bled.</p>

  <p>Andrew Turner's eyes darted about the little chamber. No smallest detail
  escaped his keen scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"Phwat's happened here. Phwat..." Turner wheeled to a burly, blue uniform
  shoving in through the doorway, a lifted nightclub and a gun. Behind the
  policeman was a tall Swede in flapping nightshirt, emboldened to enter by the
  presence of the law.</p>

  <p>"Mis' Corrio bane kill her son," the blonde janitor gurgled. "He war born
  after her husband die, ant she worrk all day ant all night making flowers,
  ant she go crrazy from no sleep ant too little food."</p>

  <p>"No," Andrew Turner said. "Mary Corrio didn't do it. She came in to see if
  the baby were uncovered. She lit the light and she found him like that. It
  was then she went mad, and not before."</p>

  <p>"The window is shut tight an' locked," the cop objected. "An' I see yuh
  bruk in th' door, so thot was locked when yuh got up here, an' from the
  inside. The key's still in it. She <i>must</i> of done it."</p>

  <p>Doc shrugged. "You won't find the instrument that made that incision
  anywhere in the flat. Call your Homicide Squad and let them try."</p>

  <p>He was right. The detectives went over every inch of the flat's contents.
  They searched the areaway under its windows. They fairly tore the place
  apart. And they found nothing to tell how the thing had come to pass.</p>

  <p>They took the mother away, at last. It was dawn by then, and there was no
  sleep in him, so Andrew Turner went back to his store to ponder over the
  gruesome puzzle.</p>

  <p><br>
  WITHIN an hour news came to him that in a tenement five blocks away from that
  in which the babe had died a woman had waked to find her mate lying stiff and
  cold beside her. Under his ear the triangular puncture had turned black with
  the clotting of a single drop of blood. This time a leathery-faced old crone
  had stared with bleared eyes at that black stigma and whispered a word, and
  the word was whispering along Morris Street, along Hogbund Alley and all the
  other fetid blocks of the slum, and fear was spreading like the icy waters of
  a river overflowing its banks.</p>

  <p>The shadow of the long "El" trestle stalking above Morris Street on its
  high steel legs was no deeper than the shadow of the fear that brooded all
  day over the sleazy slum.</p>

  <p>It hushed the raucous cries of the pushcart hucksters. It underlay the
  swarthy skins of the tenement dwellers with a sick pallor. It stilled the
  noisy play of the tatterdemalion urchins and sent them early to seek safety
  in drab and cheerless rabbit-warrens they called home, where there was no
  safety.</p>

  <p>Morris Street was accustomed to the fears that poverty breeds; the fear of
  the landlord, of the installment collector and the gas man. The men of Morris
  Street were used to the eternal fear of being fired. The women chattered
  gossip in a dozen different languages, while beneath their sagging breasts
  the dread was heavy that little Giuseppe might at any moment be brought home
  crushed by some juggernaut truck because he had no place to play but the
  teeming gutters; or that eighteen-year-old Rebecca might some night not come
  home at all because she was tired of sewing long hours on silks and laces
  more fortunate girls would wear and had decided to wear them herself, at any
  cost.</p>

  <p>The brave hopes that had brought these aliens to a new land were
  unfulfilled, yet at least they had escaped the terror of marching armies,
  Dictatorships' omnipresent spies and inexplicable punishments. They had
  escaped the nightmare terror of mobs sweeping down upon the ghetto shrieking
  the <i>pogrom</i>, the massacre. And so they had found some small modicum of
  happiness, of contentment, some small measure of security, at the gray end of
  their rainbow.</p>

  <p>Now from out of the dark, whispered traditions of the homeland they had
  forsworn, a horror had come. And with it, a fear with which their stoicism
  could not cope.</p>

  <p>The police had been promptly on the scene of the second killing. They had
  asked innumerable questions; had searched, photographed, dusted their
  fingerprint powders over ramshackle furniture, paintless sills and
  thresholds, cracked and crumbling walls.</p>

  <p>The police had gone again. "We got plenty of clues," they had growled.
  "You jabberin' monkeys get on about your business, an' we'll nab the
  homicidal maniac who done this inside of twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>The people knew they lied. There had been no fingerprints, nothing to show
  how the killer had entered or left. The people didn't expect the cops to do
  anything but lie, for the denizens of the tenements were only kikes and wops
  and heinies; without money, most of them without votes; and along Garden
  Avenue the limousine tires of the wealthy were being slashed by some vandal.
  That outrage must be stopped, the Commissioner had announced, if he had to
  put his whole force on twenty-four-hour duty.</p>

  <p><br>
  THE cops wouldn't help them. The cops <i>couldn't</i> help them, the old,
  wise folks murmured, if they wanted to. In their terror and despair the
  people of Morris Street turned to the one man who had always before helped
  them in their times of stress and trouble; to a little white-haired man, who
  was frail in stature and muscle, who was bent and weary with his long years
  of service, but whose heart and courage were as great as all outdoors.</p>

  <p>"I promised them I'd stop it." Andrew Turner probed the edge of his
  prescription counter with a gnarled, acid-stained thumb. "But I don't even
  know what it is I'm supposed to stop."</p>

  <p>"Maybe they're wrong." Jack Ransom&mdash;stocky, barrel-chested,
  carrot-topped&mdash;was the old pharmacist's strong right arm in all of his
  forays against the wolves who prey on the helpless poor. "Maybe there won't
  be any more of these killings."</p>

  <p>"Dere vill be." The interjection was a thin pipe from an urchin who was
  washing graduates at the sink in the far corner of the backroom. "Ven de
  Golem starts een he dun't stop teel de man vot made heem keels heem."</p>

  <p>"You got them big ears and mouth of yours open again, brat!" Ransom
  glowered, swinging around. "Suppose yuh get the hell out of here."</p>

  <p>"No, wait." Turner laid his blue-veined, almost transparent hand on Jack's
  bulging biceps. "Where did you get that from, Abie? Who told you that?"</p>

  <p>"Mein grendmudder." Abe Ginsburg's hand went up to shove wet fingers
  through his black, tightly curled hair&mdash;and thumbed his immense
  proboscis, in passing, with a swift gesture of derision for Jack. "She says
  dot she voiked vunce for de <i>Vilner rebbi</i>, und he used to read eet to
  her from de Kabbala aboudt de Golem."</p>

  <p>"The Golem." The wrinkles on Doc's brow deepened. "That's the word I was
  trying to think of. Old Aaron Lubitz was so scared he forgot most of the
  little English he knows, and I couldn't make out half he said. The Golem.
  Seems to me there was a play about that, some time ago."</p>

  <p>"A movie, Doc. I saw it." Ransom left off glaring at Abe. "The Golem was a
  stone statue some guy made come alive, sorta like a Frankenstein monster. It
  used to go plunk-plunking around, killing people, an' you could hear it for a
  mile. It hasn't anything to do with this thing nobody can see or hear."</p>

  <p>"Sez you! Dot's only vun kind of a Golem, Meester Toiner." Abe twisted to
  the old man. "De void means anyt'eeng dot shouldn't be alive, only a man
  breathes life into eet. De devil teaches him how, so eet's alvays somet'eeng
  awful bad. Und dot's vot dees t'eeng ees."</p>

  <p>"Superstition. I..."</p>

  <p>"Eet ain't supersteetion! Eet's de troot. You esk my grendmudder. You esk
  anybody vot comes from de old country. Dey're all talkeeng from eet."</p>

  <p>The breathless earnestness in the lad's voice; the utter, terrible
  conviction in his wide-pupiled, black eyes, somehow brought the fear into the
  gleaming backroom of the ancient drugstore. For a long moment the dusty
  silence quivered with grisly dread. Then Doc's bony finger snapped against
  his thumb-pad.</p>

  <p>"That's it!" he exclaimed. "By Jove, that's it."</p>

  <p>"You've got something, Doc?"</p>

  <p>"You ought to have it too, Jack. It's superstition of course, but it's
  believed by some of the people around here, and the others will believe it
  before long."</p>

  <p>Turner drummed on the counter, white eyebrows beetling over faded-blue
  eyes in which excitement glinted, thin lips hardly moving under a bushy,
  nicotine-stained mustache.</p>

  <p>"Get the picture: A thing that kills mysteriously, and leaves no trace.
  It's neither human nor animal, and therefore invulnerable. It was made by a
  man, and only that man can halt its evil career. Do you perceive the
  implication?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! He'll get them good and scared and then he'll demand payment to
  call the thing off. He plans to drain them dry. But it isn't working, Doc,
  because they remember how you beat the Hex-woman and the Voodoo Papaloi and
  they know you can save them again."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. He knows that. That's why before he makes his demands there's
  got to be at least one more murder."</p>

  <p>The blood seeped from the surface of Jack's face, so that his freckles
  became black spots on a blanched background. "You mean..."</p>

  <p>"Me."</p>

  <p><br>
  RANSOM'S big hands fisted. "He wouldn't dare. They worship you, Doc.
  Superstition or no superstition, they'd tear him to little pieces the minute
  he revealed himself."</p>

  <p>"No." Turner's smile was bleak, grim as death itself. "They'll fight to
  protect him, against the police, against an army. You forget, son, that they
  will be utterly convinced that he is the only one who can control the Golem.
  That if he were slain the Thing would go on forever, killing their loved
  ones, their dear ones. They will not dare avenge my death. They dare not help
  me, even now. It was only because the poison of ancient fear hadn't had time
  to develop its full effect that they came to me this morning. We've got to
  battle this alone, you and I. The two of us..."</p>

  <p>"An' me too," Abie piped up. "Dun't fergit eet me."</p>

  <p>"Let's get going, then!" Jack's heavy voice blanketed the youngster's thin
  voice. "What are we waiting for?"</p>

  <p>Doc's fleshless lips twitched. "For the attack on me."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord...!"</p>

  <p>"It's the only thing we can do. The Golem's master won't show himself till
  I'm disposed of. We have no other way of telling where he will strike. We've
  got to leave the next move to him."</p>

  <p>"But..."</p>

  <p>"But nothing. I'm bait for the silent killer, and I'm going to be a most
  attractive lure. Go home, both of you. Go on, Abe, get out of here.
  Quick!"</p>

  <p>There were tears of vexation in the urchin's eyes, but he knew better than
  to argue with his employer when he used that particular tone. He wiped his
  hands, donned his frayed jacket and shuffled reluctantly out. There was a
  minute or two more of conversation between the others, and then Jack Ransom
  followed.</p>

  <p>"Doc" Turner was alone. The tumult of Morris Street, fading as midnight
  approached, was muffled by the pharmacy's closed door. The old man measured
  some liquid into a graduate, laid a pea-size gray bit of what looked like
  steel wool alongside it. He weighed two powders, sifted them into a mortar,
  started to mix them with a pestle.</p>

  <p>Andrew Turner's hands were very steady. He seemed to have forgotten the
  peril that threatened him in the routine tasks of his profession. But a tense
  quiet crept into the store. As if in apprehension of some weird doom, the
  very light shuddered...</p>

  <p><i>...And went out!</i> Darkness smashed into the little backroom...</p>

  <p>With a strange automatism, as though his startled brain had forgotten to
  turn off the impulse that had started it, the old druggist's pestle continued
  its rub, rub, rub, but every nerve in his frail body was intent. He was
  listening...</p>

  <p>The only sound within the store was the steady scrape, scrape of the
  pestle against the side of the little stone bowl. By the evidence of every
  recognized physical sense, Doc was still alone.</p>

  <p>But he knew he was not. The strange instinct danger teaches to those who
  meet it often enough warned him that something had moved, outside the
  prescription partition, just as the light went out. It wasn't moving now. It
  was waiting for him to come out to the fuse box near the display window, as
  would have been natural had he not anticipated just that ambush.</p>

  <p>Time dragged, in the stygian gloom, so that the sixty seconds of waiting
  for the killer's next move dragged out to infinity.</p>

  <p><br>
  A SLITHER of sound ended the pulsating silence! Not a footfall. A low whirr,
  quickly ended. A pulse throbbed in Andrew Turner's temple. But still he did
  not move. He was still waiting, matching the assassin's patience with his own
  iron composure. The impending battle must be fought on ground of his own
  choosing.</p>

  <p>Abruptly the mortar on the counter glowed, with a spectral green luminance
  that was wholly within the circular bowl! The low, menacing whirr sounded
  again. Closer! <i>Too close!</i></p>

  <p>Doc snatched up the tiny wad of metallic fibre, threw it into the liquid
  in the graduate, leaped away from the counter. Flame spouted out of the
  graduate, its yellow flare striking to every inch of the backroom. It glinted
  on something slender, reptilian, that lashed through the spot where Doc's
  head had been an instant before...</p>

  <p>That writhed now, blindly, a thumb-thick snake. Twisted as if it could not
  in the light see the victim at whom it had so unerringly struck in the
  dark.</p>

  <p>It was not a snake! It was nothing that by any rule of science should have
  had life at all! It was a writhing finger-thick cable of silvery metal
  spirally wound for flexibility, and its head was a sharpened inch of
  triangular file. <i>The killer was a length of electrician's BX cable
  magically endowed with lethal life!</i></p>

  <p>Doc gasped, sprang. Not away from the thing, toward it. His bony fingers
  clutched it. The demoniac file-head struck at his arm, missed, struck again.
  His grip slid up along the eerily animate metal to immobilize the steel fang
  that twice had killed in the dark, was fighting to kill again.</p>

  <p>The Golem's length undulated, jerked powerfully. It ripped through Doc's
  palms, scarifying them, writhed momentarily on the floor. And
  <i>vanished!</i></p>

  <p>That, at any rate, was explicable. The Thing had slid through a ragged
  opening in the floor where the sink's pipes came through from the
  basement...</p>

  <p>Muffled shot-pound from beneath his feet&mdash;a faraway
  shout&mdash;whirled Doc around. He hurtled through the curtained doorway in
  the partition, darted across the store-floor, slammed out the front door...
  in time to see a roadster shoot away from the curb, slew around the
  corner.</p>

  <p>"Gone!" Doc threw his arms wide in disappointment. "Skipped." He had had
  only a fleeting glimpse of the roadster's driver, but he knew it was his
  enemy. Impossible not to know it, for the squat figure crouched over the
  car's steering wheel had had no face. Only a black head and two eyes big as
  Jack's fists.</p>

  <p>Jack! The old man spun again, to the open iron doors, flat against the
  sidewalk, of the basement entrance. Turner flew down the stone steps into the
  store cellar. His feet thumped on level concrete, and then he was groping
  along a shelf for the flashlight that was kept there for emergencies.</p>

  <p>He found it. The white beam shot out, danced along dusty, unpainted pine
  shelves that were cluttered with surplus stock for the store above. Struck a
  wall of whitewashed foundation stone at the far rear and flickered down.</p>

  <p>The disk held steady. Spotlighted by it was Jack Ransom's crumpled,
  motionless body, a dribble of blood dying his red hair a deeper scarlet.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have let him try to handle it alone," Doc groaned in belated
  remorse. "I shouldn't have..." He knelt beside the flaccid form of his
  youthful friend, groped for and found a thick wrist, laid anxious fingertips
  against the pulse.</p>

  <p>Breath hissed from between the old pharmacist's teeth, the released breath
  of relief. That pulse beat evenly, strongly. A quick examination revealed
  that the wound under the carrot hair was only a deep furrow. The bullet had
  creased Jack, had only stunned him.</p>

  <p><br>
  DOC'S light drifted along a shelved row of gallon bottles, stopped at one
  labeled <SPAN CLASS="smcap">"Liq. Ammon. Aromat"</SPAN>. Turner got to it, twisted out its cork. The
  sweetly pungent odor of Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia stung his nostrils. It
  was the work only of a moment to soak his handkerchief in it, to return to
  Jack and shove the wet wad against his nose.</p>

  <p>The sturdy body stirred. Ransom's hand jerked up, batted Turner's away.
  Then Jack's eyes were open.</p>

  <p>"Doc! You're all right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But what happened here? How did you mess up?"</p>

  <p>"I went all the way around the block, and came back to hide in the doorway
  of the grocery next door, like we'd planned. But as I turned the far corner I
  saw your lights go out. I pelted up here as fast as I could go, saw that the
  cellar doors were open, dove down. I heard someone swear, far back, started
  to pull my gun. I caught my foot in something, stumbled. I guess that saved
  my life, because that was when the fellow took his lucky shot at me. It would
  have been luckier if my head hadn't dipped, just then."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't lucky, Jack." Doc said grimly. "It was damned good
  shooting."</p>

  <p>"Hell! It was pitch dark in here. He must have fired at sound, he couldn't
  see me."</p>

  <p>"He did see you, dark as it was. He saw you <i>because</i> it was dark.
  That man is dangerous, Jack, more dangerous than you have any idea, because
  he knows too much. And we've lost track of him. I was in danger enough
  before, but now I'm in far greater peril, because now he knows I can outthink
  him. He won't be caught by this trick again. I'm afraid he won't be caught by
  any..."</p>

  <p>"Meester Toiner!" Abie's anxious call came down into the cellar. "Meester
  Toiner. Ees dot you down dere?"</p>

  <p>"Abe! What the...!"</p>

  <p>"Oi..."</p>

  <p>The youngster darted down the steps, three at a time. "Oi," he panted, his
  swarthy countenance working, his birdlike eyes gleaming with excitement. "I
  know vere he vent. I know vere de <i>momser</i> ees got hees hideavay."</p>

  <p>Doc jumped up. "What do you mean?" His fingers dug into the urchin's
  scrawny arm. "How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Because he took me dere. He showed eet to me himselluf."</p>

  <p>Jack had managed to struggle erect. "Cut the comedy, you brat, and spill
  it."</p>

  <p>"Eet's like dees. I dun't like dot you sent me home und so I shneak beck
  to find ouidt vot you vas up to. I hide acrosst de stritt. I see dat car
  drive ahp und someboty go down in de cellar, baht I don't do noteeng because
  I t'ink maybe you vos figgering on dot. Den de lights go oudt und I shtart to
  get vorried, baht I see Jeck come runneenk. Den I see fire een de beck from
  de store, und hear somevun shoot in der cellar und I teenk, &lsquo;Abie, old
  keed&mdash;looks like Meester Toiner und Jeck beet off more den dey ken chew.
  Ees time fahr you to take ah hend.'</p>

  <p>"So I start acrosst de gutter, baht before I ken get accrost ah guy mitout
  no face chumps ouidt from de cellar und into der roadster. So I got eet time
  only to chump on de runnink board und skvat down ven it's swooshin' around de
  corner.</p>

  <p>"He vaggles all ofer de stritt, like he can't see vere he's goink."</p>

  <p>"He couldn't," Doc broke in. "Not very well. There was too much light. Did
  he pull off his goggles?"</p>

  <p>"Hees goggles?" Abe looked puzzled. "I dun't know. All I know ees he dun't
  go far. Only two blocks, to dat old haunted vooden house, down by de river.
  Ven he slows down I chump off und duck avay. Baht I see dot he drifes de
  roadster een de beck yard. Vot gets me ees he deedn't see me."</p>

  <p>"There was too much light," Doc repeated his baffling explanation. Then,
  before either of his hearers could demand what he meant, he was blurting,
  "We've got to get after him, Jack. Quick. Before he works out some other
  scheme to get me out of his way!"</p>

  <p>"Hell! All we got to do is call the cops..."</p>

  <p>"They aren't any good. Neither they nor any jury would ever believe the
  truth about him. We've got to handle this ourselves." Doc whirled, headed for
  the stairs. "I'll get something I need, and lock up, and we'll get
  going."</p>

  <p>Jack looked after the old man, scratched his head. "I dunno," he muttered.
  "Maybe he knows what he's talking about, but it sounds nuts to me. The guy
  saw me <i>because</i> it was dark. He didn't see <i>you</i> because it was
  <i>light</i>. I don't get it."</p>

  <p><br>
  FOG, rolling up from the River, wrapped the sagging old house in brooding
  mystery. It lay heavy and dank and clammy on the block sloping down to the
  waterfront street.</p>

  <p>The two vague figures picking a path through the piles of rusted iron in
  that backyard might have been ghosts, so silently did they move. But that
  soundless progress of theirs was purposeful. It led them to broken back steps
  of the derelict domicile, up to the little, square back-porch.</p>

  <p>"Oil the hinges while I pick the lock." Doc's command was an almost
  inaudible whisper. The furtive prowlers moved apart. There was the barest
  perceptible click of metal on metal, a slightly louder snap. Then the dark
  wall was gashed by a vertical darker slit.</p>

  <p>The door was heavier than they thought. But they were inside the house.
  Only the musty closeness of disuse told them that, and the feel of carpetless
  boards beneath their feet. As far as sight or hearing were concerned, they
  might be anywhere at all where there was no light, no sound.</p>

  <p>"What next?" Jack breathed.</p>

  <p>"Queer," the older man murmured. "It seems empty. Maybe Abe made a
  mistake."</p>

  <p>Jack gurgled incoherently. And then...</p>

  <p>"There is no mistake." The voice was startling, coming out of the
  darkness. "None at all." No less startling was the looped rope that suddenly
  was tightening around Turner's arms, pinioning them to his side. Another
  whipped around his ankles. Unseen hands fumbled, and he was lashed, helpless,
  in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

  <p>"I have been expecting you." Abruptly light spilled down from an unshaded
  bulb, and the Voice was no longer disembodied. "And I was ready for you."</p>

  <p>It was a ghastly apparition that spoke. A black robe was shapeless about a
  shapeless form. Fist-size goggles indented the ebony fabric of a black hood,
  but they were shoved high up, and beneath them glittering eyes peered out of
  narrow slits. Behind the grotesque figure a black curtain cut off a full
  three-quarters of the room.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you knew we would come!" Doc's voice was quavering, flat with
  defeat. "How could you?" Jack, he saw, was wound in a cocoon-like mesh of
  rawhide rope, like that with which he himself was bound. They had been
  helpless to prevent that in the sightless dark, but it was impossible that
  any ordinary human could have managed the swift trussing by feel alone.</p>

  <p>"I saw your spy leave my running board, and I let him go so that he would
  send you to me. I was certain you would not notify the police. They would
  laugh at your unbelievable story."</p>

  <p>"Clever!" Reluctant admiration squeezed the exclamation from Turner's
  pallid lips. "But I should have known the mind that created the Golem would
  outthink me."</p>

  <p>The black-robed figure bowed, mockingly. "That is praise indeed, from the
  man who so quickly solved my methods and came so near to checkmating me.
  Blinding me with light was a <i>tour de force</i>. How did you manage that so
  quickly? I made sure there was no flashlight in your backroom, and when you
  didn't come out to see what had gone wrong with the store lights, I thought I
  had you, even though I was forced to seek another aperture for the Golem to
  reach you."</p>

  <p>"I had gasoline ready in a graduate, and dropped a bit of activated
  platinum sponge into it&mdash;the principle of the flameless cigarette
  lighters, Jack. You understand, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah," the youth growled. "I understand that. But I don't understand why
  you two are gabbing like a pink tea party. What's this bloke going to do with
  us, now he's got us trussed up?"</p>

  <p>"This bloke," their captor chuckled, "is going to kill both of
  you&mdash;with black light. Like this."</p>

  <p><br>
  A BLACK-GLOVED hand appeared from the robe's ebony folds. It held something
  like a flashlight, somewhat bulkier. Its lens pointed at Jack's head but,
  oddly enough, did not light up.</p>

  <p>"Well," the redhead growled, "go ahead. What are you waiting for?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not waiting," the other responded, amusement threading his low tone.
  "You feel something on your left cheek?"</p>

  <p>"Huh! Damned if I don't!" There was astonishment in Ransom's explanation,
  the type of modified fear inspired in the bravest by the unknown. And then
  pain thinned his voice. "It's hot. <i>It's burning me!</i>" A circle of
  redness grew on that cheek, of redness that deepened momentarily,
  darkened...</p>

  <p>Something clicked. "That's what I'm going to do with you and your friend.
  The two of you will be found in the street tomorrow morning, burned to a
  crisp, and the mark of the Golem will be upon you. Morris Street's protectors
  killed by the Golem! Will Morris Street pay tribute to me then, or not?"</p>

  <p>"What is it, Doc?" Ransom groaned. "What devilish thing is that?"</p>

  <p>"An ultraviolet-ray lamp, projecting the upper end of the sun's spectrum
  that gives the most painful burns, although they are not visible to the naked
  eye. Black light. I took a chance on its being the ultraviolet he was using,
  and not the infrared, when I powdered some calcium tungstate and some powder
  containing an infinitesimal trace of radium bromide in the mortar. When the
  ultraviolet struck that, it glowed and warned me the Golem was about to
  strike. That's how I dodged it."</p>

  <p>"Brilliant, Doctor Turner! I knew I had met a foeman worthy of my
  steel."</p>

  <p>"You had to see to be able to direct the Golem so expertly, and you
  couldn't be using visible light because both your previous attacks were
  perpetrated in the dark. That was easy. But I'd like to know the secret of
  your weapon before I pass out. Mechanical, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Mechanical, of course." The black robe shrugged. "I think only you can
  fully appreciate its ingenuity. It can do no harm to show you how it works,
  because you will not live to make use of your knowledge. Here it is..."</p>

  <p>The man reached between the folds of the curtain behind him, brought out a
  seven-foot length of whirring, writhing cable. It was the snakelike thing
  with which Doc had fought in his prescription room, its file-head still
  virulent-looking as before. But there was a fan of metal rings at its other
  end, five of them, through which black gloved fingers slid.</p>

  <p>"Wires are attached to these rings," their owner murmured, "and run
  through the inside of the spiral cable to its further end. By pulling on the
  appropriate rings I can make the contrivance do anything I wish. See&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The thing writhed on the floor, arched up, looped around Jack's legs,
  around Doc's waist. Even though they knew now exactly what animated it, there
  was still a similitude of grisly, vicious life about it. It darted at the
  druggist's face, and he ducked. Then it thumped laxly to the floor.</p>

  <p>"You sent that up through the hole from my cellar to strike at me," Doc
  accused, "just like you sent it through cracks in the decrepit walls of
  tenement flats from vacant rooms next to them. You had a periscope, too, at
  the end of a hollow rod, with a violet-ray lamp lighting the mirror, like a
  surgeon's bronchoscope. I saw that peeping out, under the sink. Your goggles
  are nickel oxide glass, filmed with calcium tungstate and some radium salt,
  making a fluorescent screen that enables you to see by the light that to
  everyone else is darkness. That's the way you killed the father of a family
  and a little, helpless infant."</p>

  <p>The robed man laughed. "That's the way I killed them. But it's not the way
  I'm going to kill you." He moved suddenly, sweeping the partitioning curtain
  aside. "I've long wanted to try the full power of this contrivance on a
  human."</p>

  <p><br>
  A CEILING-HIGH machine stood revealed, an intricate mass of insulated wire
  coils, of gleaming copper buss-bars, of overgrown radio bulbs. But that which
  focused Jack's eyes and Doc's was a ten-inch glass lens jutting out of its
  very center. The great bulbous eye stared straight at them, ineffably
  menacing.</p>

  <p>The gloved hand curled about the handle of a huge switch. "I've confessed
  murder to you, my friends, but you won't repeat that confession on any
  earthly witness stand." The great copper bar started to move upward toward
  the waiting receptacle.</p>

  <p>"Don't," Andrew Turner screamed, his poise shattered at last. "Don't use
  that on us!" His cry was high-pitched, edged with hysteria.</p>

  <p>The killer laughed. The switch-knife moved faster. A fine spray shot out,
  apparently from Doc's chest itself. It struck the hood squarely, soaked it.
  Its wearer staggered. Made a last despairing effort to push home that switch.
  Thumped down on the floor and lay there motionless, like a gutted meal
  sack.</p>

  <p>"Phew," Doc gasped. "I thought I'd never be able to get my elbow worked
  around to press the atomizer bulb I had hidden under my coat. I expected him
  to tie my wrists together in the usual manner, not my arms to my sides."</p>

  <p>"Let's&mdash;get out&mdash;of here," Jack choked. "That ether smell is
  getting me, too."</p>

  <p>They had to fall to the floor and roll to the door, and it was only a bit
  of acrobatic dexterity on Jack's part that got the thick portal open. But
  then the fresh air of the Morris Street night revived them.</p>

  <p>"Here's that razor blade we stuck in the steps, Doc. It'll get us free in
  a second. Good thing you thought of that."</p>

  <p>"Seems to me," the old man said slowly, "it was a good thing I thought of
  a great many things tonight. Starting with how two murders could be committed
  in absolute darkness without a sound and without the killer entering the room
  where his victim lay.</p>

  <p>"It was a battle of wits, a chess game against death. That was a first
  class brain I was up against, Jack, and I'm a little proud of the fact that I
  could outmaneuver it sufficiently to get a confession of murder from its
  owner, and then escape with my own life. A little proud."</p>

  <p>"Gees, Doc. That's the first time I ever heard you hand yourself a
  bouquet. But I guess it's coming to you. Come on, I'm kinda eager to wrap
  this rawhide rope around that guy in there before he comes to. Maybe my brain
  is second-class, but it's good enough to figure out that the first-class one
  you're talking about won't be worth much after twenty or thirty thousand
  volts of juice gets done slicing through it."</p>
