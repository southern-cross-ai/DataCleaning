<h2>For the Sake of Enlightenment<br>
<br>
by<br>

(writing as Coutts Brisbane)</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Published in <i>The English review</i>, July 1929</h3>

<hr>

<p>At the corner where the street named Redolent-of-Virtue gave
upon the market-place of Sao-Ping, Dr. Hi Ho halted. Here was the
strategic point most favourable to his campaign. Though it was but
a little after daybreak, people from the surrounding country were
already trickling through the gate at the farther end, and soon
street and market would be crowded. It was a first-class pitch.</p>

<p>Dr. Hi Ho laid down his heavy pack and turned to the owner of
the shop by him, an obese person engaged in setting out to the best
advantage a varied store of wares, mostly damaged or of poor
quality, ranging from old clothes to packets of spices and musical
instruments.</p>

<p>"Honourable sir, this despicable person is a practitioner of the
estimable and venerable art of healing, come from very far to
benefit the people of Sao-Ping with his wisdom. Deign, therefore,
to allow him to display his sign and chart upon this shutter.
Besides acquiring merit by a benevolent action, you will assuredly
benefit by much custom from the crowd that will infallibly assemble
to witness the cures he shall perform."</p>

<p>The shopkeeper, by name Chow Ming, assumed a disdainful
countenance.</p>

<p>"Ten cash," he growled.</p>

<p>"A stick has two ends. This street has two corners. Four
cash&mdash;or I go over the way," replied Dr. Hi. "Also I will give
you a dose to relieve the constriction of your honourable head. And
see, already I attract attention."</p>

<p>Two peasants, loaded with garden produce, had halted at gaze.
Chow Ming yielded reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Four, then. Money down," he growled.</p>

<p>"The gods witness your disinterested benevolence," murmured Dr.
Hi sarcastically, and paid from a flaccid purse.</p>

<p>At once he became busy, and unrolling a wide scroll of tough
paper, hung it upon the shutter. It displayed a life-size outline
of a human figure, divided by thin red lines into a hundred spaces
of about equal area, each bearing a number. An inscription in red
and gold proclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Dr. Hi Ho, Healer of all pains. Stomachs
relieved, Blindness, Deafness, Epilepsy, Oppression after Meals,
and all other diseases cured. The Fee is small, the Relief
immediate and lasting. Dr. Hi Ho, Healer of Mandarins."</p>

<p>Dr. Hi next opened his pharmacy, a large box divided into one
hundred compartments, each numbered to correspond with a division
of the chart. He brought from one wide sleeve a little brazier of
bronze and revived the charcoal in it by blowing. Beside this he
set an assortment of knives and cautery irons, a small but
horrid-looking demon of brass, a silver spoon, graduated for
measuring doses, a silver tube, a large bundle of fire-crackers and
a gong. Then he squatted, ready for action.</p>

<p>Chow Ming, having completed his window dressing, came out
grunting dismally.</p>

<p>"My head still aches," he remarked pointedly. "A cure was
promised."</p>

<p>"It will not ache for long. Mine are potent and far-reaching
drugs," quoth Dr. Hi, and rose briskly. "Condescend to indicate the
exact seat of the pain."</p>

<p>Chow Ming rubbed his forehead. Dr. Hi glanced at the chart. That
region was numbered Four, therefore the doctor opened compartment
Four of the pharmacy, dug out a generous spoonful of grey powder
and grinned at his patient.</p>

<p>"Give yourself the trouble of opening wide your capacious and
magnificent mouth. So!" With the dexterity of long practice he
tossed the powder into the patient's gullet. "Go, take a cup of hot
tea," he added as Chow Ming spluttered and choked. "You will
quickly recover your accustomed serenity."</p>

<p>Ming departed, too full for words. One of the peasants, having
consulted with his friends and the four others who had joined them,
now stepped forward.</p>

<p>"I have two pains. What is the fee?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Where are the pains?" countered Dr. Hi.</p>

<p>"Here and here." The man indicated stomach and eyes. "I am dizzy
and there are strange spots that fly before me like soot from a
dirty chimney."</p>

<p>"Two cash," said Dr. Hi and thrust the largest of his cautery
irons into the heart of the glowing brazier. "For two cash only I
will relieve you. You shall skip like a young goat in the
spring."</p>

<p>"Will you not take a couple of water melons? I am a poor
man."</p>

<p>"Two cash!" insisted Dr. Hi with great firmness. "Mine are
mandarin medicines of great potency."</p>

<p>"What is that for?" The man pointed to the cautery heating in
the brazier. He seemed to distrust it.</p>

<p>"Am I to explain the secrets of my art to one void of
understanding?" grunted Dr. Hi testily. "If you do not want relief,
pass on. Others wait. But in a little while the earth will rock
beneath your feet, your head will whirl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is so already, great father!" moaned the man. "Cure me. Here
are the cash."</p>

<p>Dr. Hi smiled, glanced at his chart, identified the storm
centres, swiftly spooned a portion of powder from Number
Six&mdash;the eyes&mdash;another of Number Fifty&mdash;the
midriff&mdash;mixed them with the long index finger nail which he
used for writing, and bade the patient swallow. "Now, shut your
eyes!" he commanded as the man convulsively got the mixture down,
and as he obeyed drew the glowing iron from the brazier. "So!"</p>

<p>A wild howl of pain, a mad leap into the air. Swiftly and
dexterously Dr. Hi had applied the cautery to Number Fifty.</p>

<p>"Like a young goat, even as I said," murmured Dr. Hi blandly.
"Go, my son. In a little the demon that has oppressed you will
depart."</p>

<p>And he lit a fire-cracker and, as it banged, smote the gong,
while the sufferer was led off by his friends. The crowd thickened.
Many folks passed into the market, sold their wares and set about
shopping. With voice, gong, and crackers Dr. Hi advertised his
presence, praising himself and his medicines without stint.
Patients came in a steady stream and departed&mdash;mostly
writhing.</p>

<p>The lean purse grew heavy, some of the compartments of the drug
box had to be refilled from bags taken from the inexhaustible pack;
the big cautery iron, the doctor's favourite weapon, began to show
signs of wear.</p>

<p>But at last the rush slackened. The market was over, the folks
going home, and Dr. Hi had leisure to refresh himself with a bowl
of chop and a pot of tea brought from a neighbouring cook-shop. He
lit his pipe and leisurely began to pack up with a contented mind.
He had had an excellent day. He proposed to fare sumptuously at a
restaurant he knew of, the <i>Abundant-Bestower-of-Succulence</i>;
then he would hire a coolie and wheelbarrow and be trundled
comfortably to the neighbouring town of Sao-Hang in the cool of the
evening.</p>

<p>He had completed his packing and was preparing to move when a
man, who for the past two hours had been observing his activities
from the garden porch of a house of some pretensions on the farther
side of the street, crossed to his side.</p>

<p>"Is this lowly and ill-nurtured person permitted to speak with
the highly estimable Dr. Hi, on a matter concerning the health of a
trebly revered male parent?" he asked softly, after looking round
to make certain that none could overhear.</p>

<p>"Filial piety is the chief jewel in the necklet of the superior
virtues. Speak!" With one swift glance Dr. Hi had appraised his
man. He was clad in fine silks, his body was of a beautiful
rotundity, his cheeks were pendulous. A crimson birthmark upon his
forehead was the sole blemish of a moonlike countenance. Dr. Hi
judged him good for a fat fee. "I have other and finer medicines
for such as your revered and venerable progenitor," he added.
"Calcined tiger's claws, gall of serpents, musk from&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! Those I have watched at work with soul-bestirring effects
will suffice," said the filial one. "I have noted that for those
who suffer in various parts of the body, you mix powders of various
sorts."</p>

<p>"Such, my son, is what I have learned by close application and
long study. But, as I have said, for cases such as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My revered parent suffers all over. There is no part of him
that does not ache, from the crown of his head, filled with wisdom
and the maxims of the sages, to the tips of his melodious toes.
Therefore, I have considered. Other healers have treated but one
part of him at a time. My revered parent remains as before. Yet
perhaps if you were to administer to him <i>all</i> the medicaments
in your box, he would recover?"</p>

<p>"I think he would be more likely to become an ancestor, at once
and with noises as of not distant thunder," replied Dr. Hi dryly.
"Yet that is an experiment I have often wished to try for the sake
of my own enlightenment. It is for you, filial one, to decide. The
risk that you will be involved in the expense of a fitting funeral
is great. The expense of the experiment will also be great. One
thousand <i>taels</i> will defray it, and I must also enjoy the
hospitality of your honourable progenitor's palatial roof that I
may observe his progress, either towards the ancestral tomb or the
enjoyment of a ripe and long enduring old age."</p>

<p>"By what I have noted of the wondrous effects of <i>three</i> of
your dragon-subduing drugs administered together, I can have but
little doubt of what will follow the addition of the remaining
ninety-seven," murmured the dutiful son. "But since my revered
father is already at the very stirrup of the heaven-aspiring steed,
the experiment is worth trying. Follow me. You shall have your fee.
Then you shall exercise your unsurpassable skill and remain under
my roof while all the necessary ceremonies are performed."</p>

<p>Dr. Hi Ho lifted his pack and followed the filial one through
the portal and a well-tiled garden to an airy pavilion attached to
the rear of the house. Here, upon a bed of carved rosewood, propped
about by silken cushions and covered with quilts stuffed with the
superior down of wild geese, lay a man advanced beyond the middle
years of life and of a figure that assuredly exceeded the bounds of
the canon of Feng Tien, for his girth was greater by four
hand-spans than his height. He regarded his son and the doctor with
blinking eyes, but gave no other sign of animation.</p>

<p>"Behold, most honourable father, I have brought a physician
whose merit is written in letters of pure gold upon the scroll of
fame. He will undoubtedly cure you," said the dutiful son.</p>

<p>"If it is so ordained," murmured Dr. Hi, who had his doubts. "I
require more charcoal for my brazier," he whispered. "Also there
was a fee promised."</p>

<p>"All shall be brought. Speak soothingly to my father while I
procure it. His name is Wu Lung. Mine is Tin Lung. I go&mdash;yet
is the hot iron needful? Surely a hundred drugs should
suffice?"</p>

<p>"I shall proceed according to the rules of science!" replied Dr.
Hi magisterially, and turned towards the patient. "You are sure
that pains afflict you in every part of your magnificent body, O
revered Wu Lung?" he asked.</p>

<p>The patient blinked rapidly and apparently affirmatively, but
though his lips moved no sound came forth. Dr. Hi shook his head
and busied himself with his preparations. He took a large bowl from
his pack and with meticulous care measured equal portions from each
compartment of his drug box. Though each was small, the aggregate
made a goodly pile. He added water, stirred the mess, and once more
blew up his brazier.</p>

<p>The excellent Tin Lung returned with a basket of charcoal and a
heavy bag, and having made certain that the sum of <i>taels</i> was
correct and the pieces of good silver and fair weight, Dr. Hi at
once began his work.</p>

<p>With the aid of the filial Tin and an old woman servant of
sinister countenance but strong arms, he transferred the contents
of the bowl to the interior of Wu Lung, then settled down to await
results.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the results began to occur. They continued to
occur throughout the remainder of the day and far into the night,
while the patient heaved and howled and performed the most
extraordinary contortions, stimulated whenever he showed signs of
slackening in endeavour by well-directed touches of the cautery. It
was observable that his bulk was lessened by midnight, at which
time Dr. Hi Ho judged it well to allow him to subside into the
sleep of exhaustion.</p>

<p>All the next day the patient slept, which time Tin Lung, a prey
to filial grief, spent in bargaining with a well-deserving
undertaker; also he continued to sleep through the ensuing night.
On the following morning he awoke, greatly diminished. Dr. Hi Ho at
once ordered fitting nourishment, swallows' nest soup, rhubarb
stewed in butter, and a duck simmered in wine. These delicacies he
administered to the patient with excellent effect.</p>

<p>From that moment the recovery of the excellent Wu was rapid, and
ere the evening he was able to proclaim to several old friends who
had come to witness his last moments at the instance of Tin, that
the heaven-aspiring steed had for that time been returned to his
celestial stall with an empty saddle.</p>

<p>Three days later he was sufficiently restored to bestow upon Dr.
Hi Ho yet another thousand <i>taels</i> and the assurance of his
eternal gratitude, with which Dr. Hi took his departure.</p>

<p>Tin Lung, who, at his recovered parent's express desire,
accompanied the physician to the street gate, presented to him a
moonlike countenance wreathed in deep gloom, despite the successful
outcome of the experiment which he himself had inaugurated.</p>

<p>"May you shortly cease to have an existence!" he said with much
bitterness. "But for your ill-timed meddling with the decree of the
gods, my revered father would ere now have been relieved of the
burden of prolonged sojourn amongst us, while an excellent if
avaricious undertaker would have been providing Sao-Ping with the
spectacle of a superb and mind-elevating funeral of unsurpassed
magnificence."</p>

<p>"Refrain from these unfilial and evil-deserving observations!"
quoth Dr. Hi in stern rebuke. "Rejoice rather that you have been
the cause of enlarging the knowledge of this humble but earnest
student of the science of healing. Farewell. May your honourable
shadow cover a continually increasing area."</p>

<p>Whereupon Dr. Hi, wearing a benevolent smile, made haste to the
town gate where he joined himself to a well-armed company of
merchants, fearing that otherwise an overwhelming parsimony should
impel the filial Tin Lung to cause him to be intercepted and
relieved of his gains.</p>

<p>A full year of profitable endeavour had passed before Dr. Hi Ho
again visited the town of Sao-Ping. Once more he established
himself in the shadow of the benevolent Chow Ming. But scarce had
he banged his gong thrice ere he observed on the opposite side of
the street a beggar who glared at him with incredible malignity.
With some difficulty, for the fellow was of a meagre habit, Dr. Hi
recognized by the fiery birthmark upon his forehead the erstwhile
sleek and well-conditioned Tin Lung.</p>

<p>"How is this?" he inquired of the benevolent Chow Ming. "Is the
honourable and well-venerated Wu Lung again on the point of joining
his ancestors, and does Tin Lung adopt this dress and deprive
himself of sustenance to placate some demon who afflicts his
revered parent?"</p>

<p>"You yourself are the cause, honourable and gifted healer,"
replied Chow Ming. "Know that Tin Lung was but a late adopted son.
After that your skill removed Wu Lung from the very saddle of the
heaven-mounting steed, he grew strong and lusty. He wedded a
sprightly maiden. Now twin sons of a superior beauty and unexampled
strength of lungs adorn the hearth of Wu, and Tin Lung, having
given way to reviling the decree of the gods, has been cast forth
to earn his own bread."</p>

<p>Dr. Hi arose, repacked in haste, and sent a boy for his barrow
man. Then he beckoned to Tin Lung, who approached with a lowering
and evil-bespeaking countenance.</p>

<p>"A year past, O virtuous and filial one, your honeyed tongue
persuaded me to a certain experiment. It was successful, but of its
full fruition I have learned but now. The head mandarin of Ning-Po,
a very wealthy person, lacks a son to make the offerings. He has
proclaimed a reward of ten thousand <i>taels</i> to anyone who can
procure him that supreme felicity. I go in haste to earn it, yet it
is but fitting that you, through whom my feet were put upon the
path of enlightenment, should be rewarded according to your
surpassing merit."</p>

<p>Thereupon Dr. Hi mounted his barrow, dropped something into the
outstretched hand, and was trundled swiftly away, urging his man to
speed.</p>

<p>Tin Lung remained motionless and speechless. In his palm lay the
reward of merit&mdash;a single brass cash.</p>
