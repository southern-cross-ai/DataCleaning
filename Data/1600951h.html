<h2 align="center"><b>Introduction<a name="Intro"></a></b></h2>
<p>In  the following descriptions of track and field sports it has been assumed that  the reader is more or less familiar with the subjects treated, and cognizant of  the minor technicalities of athletic work and phraseology. These papers are not  intended to convey information to the layman of sport, but rather to aid and  instruct the young athlete who is so situated that he cannot secure the  personal training and instruction available to those who live in large cities,  or who attend schools and colleges where physical instruction forms part of the  regular work.</p>
<p>A  majority of the illustrations are direct reproductions from photographs taken  of the best and most experienced exponents of each special event, and the  accompanying text has in most cases been revised by the athletes represented.  In this way there is offered to the reader the clearest possible explanation  and description that can be obtained of the standard athletic events, and every  one who follows the directions and suggestions offered may feel confident that  he is working along the right track, and that when he eventually secures the  assistance of a trainer he will not find it necessary to start again at the  beginning and unlearn all that he has hitherto looked upon as the correct  method.</p>
<p>Because  of the widespread interest in the bicycle, it has seemed advisable to add a  chapter on bicycling for men and one on bicycling for women, and a few hints  and suggestions on the care of the wheel. The extracts from the A. A. U. rules  are used by courtesy of Messrs. A. G. Spalding &amp; Bros., and are taken from  the official hand-book of the Amateur Athletic Union. </p>
<h1 align="center"><b>Track Events</b></h1>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sprints"></a>The Sprints</b></h2>
<p>Of  all track-athletic events the sprints are the hardest to train for, yet the  easiest to perform. Being the easiest, there are consequently many more  athletes running the 100 and the 220 than there are competing in any other  single events; but among all these competitors there are comparatively few  really first-class men. To become such requires long and patient and careful  training, and a greater mastery of form than in almost anything else.</p>
<p>It  is a difficult task to tell on paper just what a man should do who wishes to  make a specialty of sprinting. There are so many small points of importance  that vary with individuals, that only a general description and a few broad  suggestions can be given here. At the same time, whoever accepts these  suggestions and heeds them may feel confident that he is working along the  right lines, and that if he will follow the advice here set down he will put  himself into condition to make rapid strides of progress as soon as he comes  under the management of a trainer. </p>
<p>No  one ought to begin to train for any athletic event much under the age of  sixteen. Until that time few boys are sufficiently developed physically to be  able to stand the strain of regular athletic work. At that age and afterward,  however, the muscles become firm, and are amenable to development and capable  of continuous careful exercise. You will hear a great deal of talk about &ldquo;wind&rdquo;  and &ldquo;breathing&rdquo; and &ldquo;lungs,&rdquo; and kindred subjects, when you first begin to  train as a runner. Pay no attention to these &ldquo;wind&rdquo; advisers. Your wind and  lungs will take care of themselves. In the first place, the lungs are not at  all the organs that you want to think of in this connection; it is the heart.  The heart is the organ that is affected by running. Run a hundred yards, and  you will find your heart beating faster than when you started. The exertion of  sending the blood more rapidly through the body is the cause of this. Therefore  a sprinter should first feel confident that he has a strong heart; he may then  set to work with no misgivings about his wind.</p>
<p>It  is not the lungs that are affected by cigarette smoking. It is the heart. Take  any smoker, and you will find that his heart beats to a different measure from  that of an abstainer. For this reason sprinters should avoid tobacco. Another  old-fashioned and exploded theory is that the athlete should run with his mouth  shut. That is not necessary at all. In fact, sprinters are taught nowadays to  run with their mouths open, and every first-class man in the event does so. It  must be plain to every one that a man can get more air into his lungs, and thus  facilitate the working of the heart, by inhaling through his mouth than through  his nostrils. Of late all the best long-distance runners have adopted this  breathing method, and find it the best.</p>
<p>The  training for the 100 yards and that for the 220 are almost identical, for an  athlete who runs one of these events almost invariably becomes proficient in  the other. In fact, the 220 is a long sprint&mdash;the word sprint meaning to run at  full speed the entire distance of a race. The most important feature of  sprinting, of course, is the start, and no runner can become too proficient in  this. Up to within five or six years the standing start was universal, but in  1889 or 1890 Lee, of the New York Athletic Club, introduced the crouching start,  and since then that has become the standard in America. In England some of the  professionals used it, but not until the London Athletic Club men came over  here in 1895 did British amateurs recognize the value of the crouch and adopt  it. But they did adopt it after the international games, and no doubt the  crouching start will soon become general among English amateurs.</p>
<p>The  position for the start is somewhat difficult to acquire and master, but once  this is accomplished an athlete is certain to knock off one-fifth of a second  from his best previous record. The first thing of importance is to fall into an  easy position, with the hands on the scratch-line and the starting foot from 6  to 9 inches back. The other foot should be from 2 feet 6 inches to 2 feet 9 inches  farther back. The runner should be raised up on his toes in an easy, springy  attitude. Illustration No. 1, on the opposite page, shows exactly how that  position is taken. Many runners lean on their knuckles, but a better way is to  have the hands open, and to rest on the extended fingers. This gives more  spring. In order to do this, and to keep hold of the running corks, fasten a  rubber band at each end of these, and slip this over the back of the hand.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page007.jpg" width="800" height="430"></p>
<p>When  the starter gives the word to &ldquo;set,&rdquo; the runner should lean forward as far as  he can without losing his balance, his head lifted so that he can get a full  and clear view of the track ahead of him. When the pistol sounds he shoots  ahead with all the force of both legs, but his first two strides are taken in a  crouching position. Do not attempt to stand erect at the very start. Let the  head and shoulders rise along a slanting line to their proper altitude, or  there will be an infinitesimal but still noticeable loss of time. As soon as  the runner has got into an erect position, however, and into his pace, he  should run with only the very slightest forward inclination of the body, but  with the chin, thrust well out. Illustration No. 2, on page 7, shows this well.  The arms should be swung across the body rather than alongside of it. This  gives better form and makes an easier stride.</p>
<p>Never  look backward while running. Many a race has been lost by that very act. Pay no  attention at all to the other competitors, but go it for all you are worth,  regardless of your rivals. Breathe naturally. Do not begin to stop until you  have passed the finish-line, but, this done, throw up your hands and try to run  up into the air. Illustration No. 3 demonstrates that idea.</p>
<p>The  man who naturally has a long stride has an advantage over his fellows, but the  man who has not a long stride need not attempt to increase his spread of leg.  An athlete can run much better with his natural stride than with an adopted  gait. Of course, when jogging for practice, it is best to lift the legs as well  up as possible, and thus develop whatever capabilities for a long stride you  may have, but do not strain yourself by trying to overdo the thing. The foot  should always come down straight upon the ground&mdash;that is, flat. This does not  mean that the heel should touch, for it must not by any means. Yet a man does  not run on his toes; he runs on the ball of his foot; and, in order that the  spikes of his shoes may enter the track to the best advantage, the sole should  strike flat, that the nails may dig well in and secure a firm hold.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page009.jpg" width="800" height="498"></p>
<p>For  a beginner who has never undertaken any systematic training in sprinting, and  who desires to become proficient in it, the following schedule, to be carefuly  carried out for three weeks, may be strongly recommended:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Practise  the start six times, running at speed only about 20 yards from the scratch.  Rest between each attempt, and end up by jogging 50 yards, finishing up the 100  at speed.</li>
  <li><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Jog  a quarter of a mile, for the purpose of developing the stride.</li>
  <li><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Run  75 yards at speed; rest, and then run 50 yards at speed.</li>
  <li><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Practise  the start ten times, running, as before, not farther than 20 yards each time;  jog 220 yards slowly for stride.</li>
  <li><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Run  50 yards at speed twice, with a rest between.</li>
  <li><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Run  a trial 100 yards on time, and, after a rest, jog around the track for 220  yards.</li>
</ul>
<p>To  an ambitious young athlete who feels he is a future record-holder this schedule  may seem altogether too light. There are no words strong enough, however, with  which I can urge him not to attempt to do a bit more at the beginning. What is  more, at the slightest sign of fatigue at this work quit for the day.</p>
<p><img src="1600951h-images/page011a.jpg" width="400" height="445" hspace="20" align="right">For  practising starts, where a pistol is unavailable, get some one to snap two  boards together. Don&rsquo;t start by oral command. Get in the habit of getting off  the mark at the crack of a pistol, or to a sound as nearly like it as possible.  The jogging around the track should be taken very slowly, and is intended  purely as a leg exercise and to develop the muscles of the calves and thighs. A  long, loose jog will lengthen the stride. When preparing for a contest, lay off  altogether the day immediately preceding it, and don&rsquo;t run your distance  against time for three or four days previously. Run only 50 yards at those  times if you are going into the 100, and try 150 if you intend entering the  220. In a 220 race you will find that you can make a stronger finish if you  ease up a trifle for five or ten yards at the 200-yard mark&mdash;although this is  merely <i>comparatively</i> speaking, for  this race is a dash from start to finish. It will be better not to experiment  with this suggestion until you have become a pretty good judge of pace.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page011b.jpg" width="800" height="489"></p>
<p>The  proper costume for a runner is a light jersey shirt with no sleeves, and  china-silk running-trousers that barely reach to the knees. If china-silk is  unavailable, cambric or cotton will do very well. Corks may be purchased of any  dealer in sporting goods. Working shoes should be made of horse-hide, with no  heels, and six spikes in the toes. The athlete should also have a pair of  calfskin shoes of the lightest possible make for use in competition only. While  at work it is well to wear light socks, as these make the shoe fit more snugly;  but in a race wear &ldquo;pushers&rdquo;; these are made of chamois, and cover the toes  from the instep downward.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Middle"></a>The Middle  Distances</b></h2>
<p>The  middle distances are the hardest events for an athlete to work at without the  assistance of a trainer; but this fact should not discourage the beginner,  because there is a vast amount of preliminary work that he can do which will  put him into such condition that when he does at last come under the care of a  coach he will be able to make rapid progress towards proficiency.</p>
<p>The  term &ldquo;middle distances&rdquo; is usually applied to the quarter and half mile races  only, for these have become recognized as the standards by amateur associations  and &nbsp;clubs. The quarter-mile is sometimes  set down on the card as a 440-yard dash&mdash;for it is practically a dash from  start to finish, as run nowadays&mdash;and the half-mile is frequently called the  880-yard run. It is becoming more usual, however, to look upon these events as  fractions of a mile.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page014.jpg" width="800" height="599"></p>
<p>The  preparatory work for the quarter should begin at the close of winter with walks  of from two to three miles across country, ending up with a half-mile jog and a  good rub-down. This sort of exercise should be taken every day for three weeks,  in order to harden the muscles and get the body into regular habits of physical  exercise. Let us presume that at the end of this time the weather has moderated  sufficiently to permit of outdoor work in light running costume. This should  consist of running at an easy gait distances longer and shorter than a  quarter-mile on alternate days. For instance, on Monday, run 220 and 300 yards  a couple of times, with a rest in between; on Tuesday run 600 yards or half a  mile; on Wednesday run the short distances again; and keep on doing this for a  month or more. Occasionally&mdash;say once a week&mdash;try 100 yards for speed, and about  every tenth day take a trial quarter on time.</p>
<p>The  most important of all things in running the middle distances is that the  athlete should become a judge of pace. He must know just how fast he is going.  It takes time, of course, to acquire this knowledge, but the good men in the  events know just how rapidly they are travelling around the track, and can tell  to a fifth of a second what their gait has been for any fraction of the course.  That is why these events are the hardest to run. The best way to acquire this  knowledge of gait is to get some one to hold a watch on you every time you run.  When you have not a trainer, however, this is not always possible. But there is  no reason why you should not hold the watch yourself. And it is well to keep a  record of your speed as it increases.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page015.jpg" width="800" height="511"></p>
<p>Frequent  runs of 150 and 300 yards on time will serve to show how your speed is getting  along, and, the distances being short, this will enable you to judge of pace so  that you can tell very closely how you are travelling over the various portions  of your distance. As has been said, the quarter as now run is a sprint from  start to finish, and the best thing to do in competition is to jump into the  lead at once and head the field all the way, if you can. As in the 100 and 220,  no heed should be given to the other competitors; and, above all things, never  look back.</p>
<p>There  is little more to be said in the way of instruction for this event, for it is  one that must be worked over according to the powers and capabilities of each  individual.</p>
<p>The  general training after the first four or five months is about the same as for  the sprints. As for the start, it is optional with the individual whether he  shall stand or crouch. Burke, the world&rsquo;s champion quarter-miler, who is  represented in the series of illustrations on the opposite page, uses the  standing start, but many others get off from the crouching position. The second  picture of the series gives a good idea of the pace and the general position of  the body, both of which are identical with sprinting form. The finish is  somewhat different. There is always plenty of space ahead after a quarter-mile  race (which, of course, has to be run on a curved track) for the runner to keep  on going as long as he wishes to, and thus he can pass the tape at top speed  and keep on as far as he likes. Many hundred-yard sprinters, coming down a  short, straight track, lose a fraction of a second of their speed by slowing up  too soon.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page017.jpg" width="800" height="427"></p>
<p>The  half-mile run requires even a greater judgment of gait than does the quarter,  and it is a much harder race to run, having now been developed into such a  speedy contest that a man should never attempt to enter any other event in  games where he runs a half-mile. Moreover, the athlete who adopts the half-mile  as his specialty should give up every other event and train continuously and  solely for that distance. He must get himself into such shape that he can tell,  to a fraction of a second, just how fast he is going. This is learned only by  having a watch going all the time, and while training there ought to be some  one on the track to shout the time every furlong or so.</p>
<p>The  preparatory work for this distance is similar to that of the quarter&mdash;that is,  there should be long and short work, over and under the distance, on alternate  days. A half-mile trial on time once in two weeks is sufficient. The start and  gait are the same as for the quarter. In the illustration of the start of the  half-mile race at the Intercollegiates of 1895, opposite, it is plain to see  that Kilpatrick is determined to get the pole if he can, while Sichel and  Kingsley, who have inside positions, are determined to keep them, even if they  have to take a sprinting start. Hollister, on the other hand, has apparently  made up his mind to let Kilpatrick set the pace, and then try to pass him. This  was wise of Hollister, because he knew Kilpatrick&rsquo;s habit was to run a very  fast first quarter, and he himself had been trained to sprint hard at the  finish. Thus he felt that if he could keep up with Kilpatrick for the first  three-eighths he could sprint past him at the finish. Hollister is shown  winning in the second illustration on page 19.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page019.jpg" width="487" height="750"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page020.jpg" width="420" height="478"></p>
<p>I  give this illustration of the tactics of half-mile racing to show how much  strategy has to be used in this event. You must know how your opponents run,  and you must distribute your energies over the race so as to counteract as far  as possible those of the other competitors. It would have been unwise for  Hollister to fight with Kilpatrick for the lead in this case, because the  latter could have run him off his feet. That is Kilpatrick&rsquo;s style. But by  letting Kilpatrick set the pace, Hollister had an easier time of it in the  first quarter, because he did not have to give any thought whatever to his  gait. When it came to the stretch, all he had to do was to sprint. Nevertheless,  the best general rule for a novice is to jump to the lead and hold it if he  can. When he gets to be a first-class man he can devote more thought to the  individual work of his opponents. One of the best things for any one working at  the half-mile is to attend every meeting he can and watch the work of other  half-milers. In fact, it is well for every athlete to follow big games, and  study his own event in the work of others. Big championship games should never  be missed if it is a possible thing to witness them. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MileRun"></a>The Mile Run</b></h2>
<p>The  mile run is about the only long-distance event practised by American school and  college athletes. In England the three-mile race is popular, and is one of the  standard events of the interuniversity field meetings, but it has not as yet  been adopted in this country. At the International games of 1895 it was on the  card, and Conneff won for the New York Athletic Club. Since then there has been  some talk of placing the event on the Intercollegiate schedule, but the  proposition to do so was defeated.</p>
<p>Training  for the mile run may be begun at almost any time of the year, but it is  presumed in all these short sketches that training will be started in the  winter-time and developed in the spring. Preliminary work in long-distance  running is of the simplest kind, consisting merely of walking and running at a  slow jog four or five miles every day until the spring season has fairly set  in. For this kind of work the best costume to wear are knickerbockers, heavy  shoes and stockings, a flannel shirt, and a sweater. This walking and running  across country will harden the muscles and gradually develop staying powers,  which can be acquired in no other way.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page023.jpg" width="800" height="509"></p>
<p>When  the weather has become warm enough to permit track work in light running  costume, the following scheme will be found a good one for steady training: On  the first day do a mile and a half at an easy jog; on the second day, run a  half-mile at a good pace, trying to do it in 2 min. 45 sec. (as the weeks pass  by the athlete should try to reduce this time for the half-mile down to 2 min.  30 sec. or below); on the third day run a quarter of a mile at speed; on the  fourth day cover three-quarters of a mile at an easy jog; on the fifth day do a  mile and a half again very leisurely; on the sixth day another quarter at  speed. Always lay off on Sunday, for one day&rsquo;s rest a week is necessary when  training for any event.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page024.jpg" width="529" height="600"></p>
<p>After  this method has been practised for several weeks, it will be well to take a  trial mile on time. But thereafter do not run trials more frequently than once  in ten days, and never make a trial within ten days of the date of a race.  Before a competition it is well to lay off for two or three days, and before  trying a mile on time during the practice season it is always best to lay off  the day before. In other words, do your trial mile on Monday, Sunday being the  regular lay-off day.</p>
<p>There  is little to be said about the strategy of mile-running. The mile-runner must  know just how fast he can run, and when he goes into a race he should cover his  distances regardless of what his rivals are doing. This is sometimes very difficult,  especially for younger runners who are not judges of pace, and who allow  themselves to be run off their feet in the first half-mile. It is true that the  first half-mile is always run at a greater speed than the second; but a  well-trained athlete, who knows exactly how fast he can do his event, should  not allow any opponent to make him go faster than he is in training for. A  number of athletes, knowing the average weakness of mile-runners, train  themselves to go a very fast half-mile at first, in the hope that they may run  their opponents, who have trained in a different way, off their feet. Those,  however, who are confident of their ability, and are judges of pace, will frequently  allow these fast fellows to get a quarter of a lap ahead of them, knowing very  well that in the second half-mile they will be able to close up and finish  strongly.</p>

<p>The  pictures on pages 24 and 25 show the stride of Conneff&mdash;the American and International  champion&mdash;and of Lutyens, the English Interuniversity champion, who was defeated  by Conneff in the International games of 1895. It is plain to see that the  Englishman&rsquo;s stride is much longer than Conneff&rsquo;s; but stride does not seem to  be such an important factor in long-distance running as it is in the shorter  distances. In fact, it will be noticed that most mile-runners are short, stocky  men, although, as a rule, their legs are much longer in proportion to their  bodies than is the case with other men. Conneff runs with his mouth open the  whole distance, and, as has already been stated, this is undoubtedly the best  method for runners to adopt, in spite of the old adage about breathing through  the nose. Conneff also runs with his arms hanging down, which is by far the  best way, as it relieves the chest and shoulders of the weight of the arms  (which counts in a long race), and the swinging of the hands low down seems to  give a forward impetus similar to that which a jumper gets when he uses  dumb-bells. The costume and footwear for long-distance running are the same as  for other distances, except, perhaps, that the shoes may be made a trifle  heavier if the athlete prefers. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Hurdles"></a>The Hurdles </b></h2>
<p>There  are two distances for hurdle races which have become recognized by the  Intercollegiate Associations and the larger athletic clubs as the standards for  this event. The shorter distance is 120 yards, the race being run over ten  hurdles, three feet six inches high, placed ten yards apart, the first and last  obstacles being respectively fifteen yards from the starting and the finishing  lines. The longer distance is 220 yards, the ten hurdles in this case being two  feet six inches high, twenty yards apart, and the first and last respectively  twenty yards distant from the start and finish. These two events are usually  spoken of as the &ldquo;high hurdles&rdquo; and the &ldquo;low hurdles,&rdquo; the distances being  invariably understood as given above.</p>
<p>Hurdling  requires skill, strength, spring, nerve, and a cool head; and to become a fast  hurdler you must devote several years of hard and faithful practice in this  particular event. The training for a beginner should be begun in the gymnasium  in the winter, with light calisthenics, rising on the toes, rising on the  heels, raising the legs, and practising the double jump on the toes. There is  also a peculiar exercise, which consists of raising one leg, bent at the knee,  forward, and the other leg, bent at the knee, backward, alternating the legs at  each motion; this serves to limber and strengthen the muscles that are used in  hurdling. An occasional short jog out of doors on fair days, and light  all-round work in the gymnasium, for general physical development, should be  made a part of this preliminary training. One of the best exercises that a  hurdler can possibly indulge in is to dance up and down on the spring-board for  ten or fifteen minutes every day. This develops that very necessary quality of  spring and suppleness.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page030.jpg" width="459" height="750"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page031.jpg" width="462" height="750"></p>
<p>When  the out-door training season begins, the first two or three days should be  spent in jogging up and down the track. After that take occasional sprints of  thirty or forty yards, without practising the start. On the third day practise  the start two or three times, and try clearing one high hurdle about three  times. On the fourth day do the same thing. On the fifth day place two high  hurdles on the track at their proper distances, and negotiate them two or three  times. On the sixth day repeat this performance with three hurdles.</p>
<p>After  this first week of out-door practice, whenever the hurdles are being jumped,  the athlete should rush at them with his utmost speed from the proper  distances, so as to become accustomed to them. The general training for a  hurdler should be about the same as that for the 100 and 220 yard dashes.</p>
<p>After  three weeks of this kind of preliminary work, the high hurdles may be placed in  position, and the hurdler may try going over the whole distance on time; but he  should never attempt this more than once or twice a week, doing his daily work  over not more than three hurdles.</p>
<p>There  are two things of vital importance for the hurdler to work at in order to  acquire speed: he should drive himself as fast as he can go from the crack of  the pistol until he stops running, and each hurdle should be rushed at as if it  were the last.</p>
<p>Speed  between the hurdles is of the utmost importance. The secret of obtaining this  lies in starting the foot which has crossed last over the hurdle forward for  the first step before the forward foot has reached the ground, thus making the  first step after the jump a very short one, yet a very quick one. This is a  difficult movement to learn, but the athlete will find that it will lower his  time perceptibly if he can master it. The instinctive act upon landing after  the leap is to take a long stride forward with a view to covering distance. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page032.jpg" width="800" height="204"></p>
<p>But  the athlete must restrain this inclination and force himself to take a short  step, even if he has to work over it for months, or he will never be able to  acquire skill or speed as a hurdler. That first short step after clearing the  hurdle gives the runner his impetus, and the other two steps easily follow. The  third step is shorter than the second in order that the runner may gather  himself slightly for the spring over the next hurdle.</p>
<p><img src="1600951h-images/page033a.jpg" width="300" height="239" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="right">The  ideal distance between steps in a high-hurdle race is shown in Fig. 1. The  runner alights about 7 feet 6 inches from the obstacle, and then takes the  short, quick step already mentioned (4 feet 10 inches); then he makes a long  step (5 feet 10 inches), and then another short step (4 feet 4 inches), which  brings him within 7 feet 6 inches of his next hurdle, and he makes that spot  his takeoff. A fatal fault of many beginners is to bring the forward foot down  in such a way as to cut off the length of the jump, as shown in Fig. 2. The  first foot should be made to shoot as far forward as possible along an  imaginary line, as shown in Fig. 3. As the last hurdle is cleared, the head  should be thrust forward as the athlete lands on the ground, and so held, for  this will greatly aid in the sprint for the tape.</p>
<p><img src="1600951h-images/page033b.jpg" width="453" height="240" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="left">Training  for the low hurdles is, in general, the same as that for the high hurdles. The  jump over the obstacle itself, however, is radically different, and it is for  this reason that many hurdlers who are invincible over the shorter distance are  frequently defeated in the longer.</p>
<p>In  clearing the low hurdles the athlete should endeavor not to jump. He must put  as little spring as possible into his effort, but should clear the obstacle by  a dexterous management of the legs. Here is where one advantage of the double-jump  exercise comes in. In the 220 race the body of the hurdler should be kept on as  constant a level as possible. In other words, his shoulders should move along  an imaginary straight line from start to finish.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page034.jpg" width="800" height="223"></p>
<p>Fig.  4 shows this more clearly perhaps than any description can. The line <i>AA</i> is the one that the shoulders should  follow; the line <i>BB</i> shows the motion  that should be avoided. With practice this form can be readily acquired, and it  adds greatly to the speed of the hurdler. The secret of the motion is to lunge  slightly forward at the hurdle and to clear the obstacle by a dexterous  movement of the legs. The movement is somewhat similar to that which a man  would make if he were suspended from the ceiling, his toes just touching the  floor, and a series of hurdles on a treadmill were passing under him. To avoid  being struck he would merely lift his legs, as he has learned to do in the  exercise described on page 29.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page035.jpg" width="800" height="697"></p>
<p>The  low hurdles being placed twenty yards apart, it is of course necessary to take  a greater number of steps between obstacles. Seven strides is the number to be  aimed at, although a runner with a short stride has to be content with nine.  The latter sometimes necessitates slowing up before each hurdle, which is  fatal; and consequently it is more advisable to train for eight strides, in  that case jumping from alternate feet. This makes a race upon a curved track  extremely difficult, and is a form that should be avoided, although there are  many men who are compelled to adopt it.</p>
<p>In  practice the athlete should never go over more than seven hurdles in  succession, except, perhaps, once in two weeks for a trial on time, because the  event is too exhausting.</p>
<p>The  footwear adopted by hurdlers is similar to the high-jumper&rsquo;s shoes. They are made of kangaroo-skin, and should be slightly heavier than sprinters&rsquo; shoes.  The heel should be constructed of quarter-inch leather with two spikes placed  at the extremities of diagonals drawn through the centre of the heel. This  precludes the possibility of bruising from the constant pounding on the jumping  foot. In the toes there should be the usual six spikes.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page037.jpg" width="800" height="382"></p>
<p>The  hurdles, whether the high or the low, should be cleared by as narrow a margin  as possible. From the standpoint of speed it is better to strike the top bar  lightly rather than to clear it by several inches, for this margin makes a loss  of time. The illustrations on pages 29 and 30 give a very good idea of the  position a man should train himself to assume when clearing the sticks. The eighth  illustration gives a very good idea of the distance of the landing-spot from  the hurdle, as shown also in Figs. 1 and 2. The single thing which probably  requires the greatest practice is to get the exact length of stride for the  various steps between hurdles. A good way to get this is to mark these spots on  the ground, and then go over the hurdles, lighting on these spots, until the  stride has become absolutely natural. But no cast-iron rule can be laid down  for any one. By aiming at this ideal the hurdler will gradually work into a  stride best adapted to himself.</p>
<p>In  running the high hurdles the athlete may use either foot he chooses at the  take-off, although it is better to become accustomed to jump from the right  foot. It is better, because in the low hurdles the successful man must jump  from the right foot. This is made necessary by curved tracks. There are few 220  straightaway courses, most low-hurdle  contests being conducted on a curved track; and it is practically impossible to  make any speed at all on such a path when jumping from the left foot. J. P. Lee  used to jump from the left and right foot alternately, and for that reason he  scarcely ever entered a contest on a curved track. He knew he could not win.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page038.jpg" width="600" height="505"></p>
<p>There  is a difference of opinion among the best men in this event as to whether the  standing start or the crouching start is the better. Those who take the upright  start assert that they can get off quicker and are in better condition to take  the first hurdle, which is only fifteen yards away, and say that it is  difficult to rise to the proper jumping position in such a short run. Those who  favor the crouching start deny this. This is a case where each individual must  decide for himself which method he prefers. Another vital point that must be observed  is to rush for the first hurdle with the utmost speed, for the way in which the  first obstacle is reached and cleared often decides the race. It may be well to  add that under no circumstances whatever should the hurdler look back over his  shoulder to see the position of the other competitors. This fault has lost the  leading man many a prize. A hurdle race is a constant drive from start to  finish.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MileWalk"></a>The Mile  Walk</b></h2>
<p>This  event is the least athletic of any on the intercollegiate or interscholastic  schedules, and will doubtless be dispensed with entirely in a year or two.  There are few exercises for the general run of men any better than  walking&mdash;walking across country, at a natural gait, head up, chest out, toes  turned out, and arms swinging easily at the sides. Such walking is natural and  healthful. &ldquo;Athletic&rdquo; or &ldquo;heel-and-toe&rdquo; walking&mdash;exaggerated stride, heel  pounding, toeing in, and all that&mdash;is artificial, and of no particular  benefit. It is not harmful, of course, because it is exercise, and all normal  exercise is beneficial.</p>
<p>The  muscles that require the greatest development for walking are the abdominal and  the fore-thigh muscles. Training should be begun as soon as the snow is off the  ground by taking walks across country. Begin, of course, by taking short walks,  in order to inaugurate a general hardening process, and each day when you come  to a good stretch of road, try two or three hundred yards of strict  heel-and-toe walking, giving especial attention to the free and rolling motion  of the hips. This motion is clearly shown in illustration No. 3 on this page.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page042.jpg" width="800" height="735"></p>
<p>To  become a successful walker it is absolutely necessary to be loose and supple  about the hips. The novice will notice pains about the abdomen at first, but he  need not feel in any way alarmed. He has not caught cold. He has merely set  some muscles to work that are not usually called upon to exert themselves under  ordinary circumstances, and for a week or two they will feel sore and lame.</p>
<p>After  a week of general unlimbering the walks should be extended, and distances  between five and ten miles should be covered. In all this walking the athlete  must train himself to set his foot down straight, for walkers may not toe out.  At the end of two or three weeks, begin the alternate work as told of in the foregoing  chapters for running events. That is, one day take a ten-mile walk at an easy  gait, and the next a three-mile walk as fast as you can travel, and keep this  up until you are ready to go on the track. But always rest on Sunday. One day&rsquo;s  rest out of seven is imperative.</p>
<p>When  work on the track begins, form is the principal thing to devote your attention  to. Take long, slow walks around the cinder-path, putting the feet down  straight and firmly, and devote all your energy to acquiring an easy stride, and,  as far as possible, a long, swinging one. Work at the hip motion until you are  master of it, and train yourself in the swinging of the arms until these become  a means of assistance rather than an annoyance.</p>
<p>The  only way to acquire speed in walking is to &ldquo;sprint&rdquo; (not a running sprint, but  a walking sprint) from 100 to 200 yards. Here again alternate work should be  done&mdash;that is, walk a half or three-quarters of a mile, and rest, then walk half  a mile, one day; and on the alternate days do short sprints several times, with  rests in between. Don&rsquo;t try to go a mile at speed until you have been at work  several months.</p>
<p>After  the first couple of weeks it may be well to take a trial half or quarter on  time, but this should never be done oftener than once in a week or ten days.  When you have gotten into condition at the end of four or five months, try a  mile on time, but thereafter never attempt to go the full distance at speed  more frequently than once in ten days or two weeks.</p>
<p>The  costume for walking is the same as for running, except that the shoes have no  spikes. The heels, too, are somewhat different, being built with a slight  projection of the sole at the back, so as to make the constant pounding on the  heel less severe.</p>
<p>It  seems almost needless to say here that walking differs from running in that one  of the athlete&rsquo;s feet must be constantly on the ground, he must not lift the  rear toe until the forward heel has struck, and the rear knee must lock. The  illustrations show the rear knee locked in every instance. By speaking of the  knee as &ldquo;locked&rdquo; is meant that the joint is closed.</p>
<p>In  a race it is always well to take the lead, if possible, and walk your own mile.  Before going into a contest the athlete ought to know pretty well how fast he  can cover his distances, and he should disregard his competitors as much as  circumstances will allow.</p>
<p>Walking  has fallen somewhat into disrepute of late, because unscrupulous athletes,  proficient in the heel-and-toe method, can frequently run without apparently  altering their form, and when the Judge of Walking is not at their very heels  they travel rapidly, but unfairly, over the course. But this is not sport. </p>
<h1 align="center"><b>Field Events</b></h1>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="HighJump"></a>The Running  High Jump</b></h2>
<p>It  may well be set down as an absolute rule that no one should attempt to start in  to train seriously for the running high jump until after he is eleven or twelve  years old. In fact, it is safe to say that no one under that age should ever go  into any kind of systematic athletic work, for ambition is liable to lead the  aspiring athlete into injurious over-exertion.</p>
<p>If  you want to take up high jumping as a specialty, spend the winter, or the  indoor season, in pulling weights, so as to strengthen the back and chest, and  in going through leg motions to fortify the limbs. No one can ever succeed as a  high jumper unless he has a well-developed chest and back, for the strain on  the dorsal muscles is practically what lifts the man over the bar. This sounds  very much like lifting one&rsquo;s self up by the boot-straps, but it is nevertheless  correct. The leg exercises are simple. There are two kinds. One is to lift  yourself up on your toes. Start in by doing it about twenty-five times every  day for a week; then increase the number until you get up to about three  hundred times. An expert high jumper can lift himself five hundred times  without much fatigue. A second exercise is the &ldquo;frog motion.&rdquo; This consists of  placing the heels close together and of squatting and rising. Do this a few  times only to start with, and gradually bring yourself up to the hundreds.  Exercise the chest with weights and dumb-bells. Strengthen the back by bending  over with the legs stiff, the arms thrown out in front until the finger-tips  touch the floor easily. Do not attempt any high jumping in the winter months  when learning, for running on a hard board floor is not a good thing, as one is  liable to slip and get injured. One week of practice in the open air is worth a  month of indoor work.</p>
<p>For  out-of-door practice the jumper should have two square posts about two inches  thick, made of almost any kind of wood, and bored with holes one inch apart up  to 5 ft. 8 in., and half an inch apart above that. The pegs should be three  inches long, and the bar, made of pine, should be about twelve feet long and  one inch square. The posts are placed eight feet apart, and it is usual to hang  a handkerchief over the centre of the cross-bar so that the latter may be seen  better. A jumper must <i>always</i> keep his  eye on the bar from the time he starts to run until he lands safely on the  other side of it. The runway should be eight feet wide and about forty feet  long. It should be made of cinders, well rolled, and ought to be kept dampened  so that it shall be springy. Beyond the posts the earth should be turned over  and raked so as to make a soft landing-place.</p>
<p>The  jumping costume should consist of a jersey suit rather than a linen blouse and  trousers, because the knit goods cling to the form and keep the muscles warm.  The trousers should never reach the knees, which have to be kept free. The feet  are encased in shoes made of kangaroo skin, laced in front like running-shoes,  and are worn without socks. The shoe of the jumping foot&mdash;that is, the foot you  take off with&mdash;is made several ounces heavier than the other, and is about as  heavy as a sprinter&rsquo;s footwear. The heel is made of one-quarter-inch  sole-leather, and has two spikes. Some men jump with one spike in the middle of  the heel; but this is very bad, because when the jumper alights his heel-bone  pounds on the spike, and this soon raises a stone-bruise. If you have two  spikes fixed at the extremities of a diagonal drawn through the centre of the  heel, this bruising is easily avoided. There are no spikes on the heel of the  other shoe, but the heel itself is made slightly thicker. In the toes of both  there should be six spikes. It may be well to say here that the jumping foot is  usually the left foot, although this is purely a matter of individual taste.  Page, Sweeney, Cosgrove, Baltazzi, and almost all of our successful jumpers,  however, take off with the left foot and stride over the bar with the right.  For the sake of uniformity and convenience, therefore, let us hereafter  understand jumping foot for left foot.</p>
<p>One  of the striking features of the series of illustrations of pages 58 and 59 is  that it proves that a high jumper practically steps over the bar with one  stride instead of flying over it in a compact bunch, as he appears to do when  watched by the naked eye. The bar in all these pictures was at 5 feet 8 inches,  and each photograph necessitated a separate jump. This alone is enough to show  in what excellent form the athlete worked, for a kinetoscope could not have  caught the separate actions in one leap to better effect than these photographs  have shown them in eight different leaps.</p>
<p>Good  form in high jumping is one of the prime requisites for success. It is only  within the past few years that much attention has been given to this feature of  the exercise, and it is no doubt for this reason that the record has been so  steadily climbing. The picture of G. B. Fearing, the Harvard high jumper, on  the opposite page, is reproduced from a photograph taken in 1892. He was a  splendid all-around athlete and a clever jumper, but he had no form. His sole  thought was to get over the bar, and form could take care of itself. As he  clears the bar in this picture both his feet appear to be curled up under his  body, and his head is thrown forward and down. He seems to be almost reclining  on his side, whereas Baltazzi, who is shown in the pictures on pages 58 and 59,  makes the leap with his body practically perpendicular, although he necessarily  bends forward in the motion which lifts the torso over the stick.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page053.jpg" width="512" height="750"></p>
<p>Fearing&rsquo;s  form, as displayed in this photograph, does not give the same idea of power and  assurance as that shown by Baltazzi. Sweeney, the world&rsquo;s champion, jumps in  the same manner as Baltazzi&mdash;in fact, Baltazzi acquired much of his style from  studying Sweeney. But there is one peculiarity about the champion&rsquo;s jump which  many people do not clearly understand, and so they have named his style the  &ldquo;Sweeney jump.&rdquo; Any man who could go as high as Sweeney would have to clear the  bar in the same manner. This peculiarity is shown in the photograph on the  opposite page, taken at the International Games on September 21, 1895. Here  Sweeney appears to be lying out flat on his back, instead of clearing the bar  in an upright position. The upright position is all very well to maintain up to  six feet, but above that every ounce of muscular power must be exerted in  raising the trunk&mdash;the head and shoulders become a secondary consideration.  Thus, although up to six feet Sweeney clears the bar in an upright position,  when it comes to a higher leap he springs as high as he can from the ground,  and then heaves his torso and shoots his legs forward, twisting his body in the  air until he comes into the position shown in the picture. He has to depend  entirely upon the momentum of his run and the mid-air twist on top of the bar  to get his shoulders and head over.</p>
<p>The  Englishmen who came over with the London Athletic Club team were amazed at  Sweeney&rsquo;s performance, and even after he had successfully cleared the bar at 6  feet 5 5/8 inches, thus making a new world&rsquo;s record, the Britishers were  sceptical until they had measured the height of the central point of the  cross-bar for themselves. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page055.jpg" width="444" height="750"></p>
<p>English  high jumpers, as a rule, have very little form. Ryan, the Irish champion, goes  over the bar with both feet at once. Almost all other Englishmen run towards  the bar at an angle, instead of straight down the runway, and &ldquo;cut&rdquo; over it,,  first one leg and then the other. This style is well illustrated in the  accompanying portrait of A. B. Johnson, who jumped for the London Athletic Club  in the International Games of 1895.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page057.jpg" width="554" height="650"></p>
<p>And  now to return to the detail of the high jump itself. There is no rule that can  be laid down as to how far away from the posts a jumper should start to run.  The nearer the better, because less power is then wasted in the approach.  Sweeney and Baltazzi both start about seventy-five feet back and run slowly  down to a point within three long strides of the posts. This point must be  measured and absolutely fixed by every jumper. He should then start in the  middle of the runway and swing slowly towards the right edge of the cinder  track, turning sharply to the left at this fixed point, and then taking his  three strides as rapidly and with as much force as he can compel. This brings  his left foot on the take-off, and gives his body a sort of twist that aids  greatly in getting over the bar. A man who jumps with his right foot should  swerve in towards the left edge of the track so as to get the &ldquo;lift&rdquo; on the  left side of the body.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page059.jpg" width="452" height="750"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page058.jpg" width="448" height="750"></p>
<p>The  first illustration of the series, on page 59, shows the jumper as he starts. He  takes an easy gait until he reaches his &ldquo;mark,&rdquo; then gets into his stride, and  the second illustration shows him springing from the take-off. This spot is  another that each individual must locate by experiment for himself. A good way  for a beginner to determine how far from the bar to take off is to stand before  it on one foot and lift the other until he can touch the cross-piece with his  toes. He takes off as far back as he can thus stand on one foot and touch the  bar with the other. This distance from the base-line between the posts to the  take-off is usually equal to the height of the bar from the ground. A veteran  can, as a rule, take off closer than this, but that is the result of long  practice and experience. If you jump or take off with the left foot, all the  work is done with that foot and that side of the body. If you jump with the  right foot, the conditions, of course, are reversed. The present description is  of a jumper who uses the left foot.</p>
<p>Upon  reaching the take-off, as shown in the second illustration of the series, the  heel strikes first, as may clearly be seen from the heavy mark underneath it,  and gives the power for the jump. The toe merely gives direction to the motion  imparted by the heel and the big shin muscle which connects with it. The leap  has now begun, and with the right foot rising the jumper begins to sail over  the bar. His line of travel is a perfect semicircle, beginning at the take-off,  and ending in the soft ground on the other side at exactly the same distance  from the base-line of the posts.</p>
<p>No.  3 shows him still rising from the ground, his right foot giving the direction  of the leap. The muscles of the arms and back are now just coming into play to  raise the torso and the left leg&mdash;and all the time the eye is firmly fixed on  the bar.</p>
<p>In  No. 4 the right foot is just passing over the handkerchief, and the arms and  back are seen straining with the exertion of bringing up the left leg. Notice  that muscle of the neck. It connects with the muscles of the side and abdomen,  and these harden like steel to force the quick motion that has to be made to  lift that side of the body. The strain on this neck muscle and the working of  the back and arms are even better displayed in No. 5, where the left leg is  almost up, and is about to clear the bar. Considerable practice is required for  this motion, because it has to be done very quickly. The left foot has to be  brought in very close to the right thigh, and yet the sharp spikes must be kept  from tearing the flesh. Note how the eye is constantly on the bar.</p>
<p>In  the next picture, No. 6, the bar has been cleared, the whole body is over, and  the right leg has dropped. It is now no more used, except as a balance for the  body, the entire work of the jump, as before stated, being done with the left  leg. The jumper&rsquo;s eye is still fixed on the bar, and not until he is well over  it, as shown in No. 7, does he remove his gaze. As he clears the stick his back  muscles give a twist to his flying form, and his right arm thrown into the air  aids him in turning, so that he will fall facing the bar. The left leg has now  passed the right, and is making ready to sustain the weight of the body on  landing, while the right is thrust slightly backward to maintain a proper  equilibrium. The strain on the back and arms is relaxed.</p>
<p>In  No. 8 he is just about to land, and the camera has given us a beautiful display  of the looseness of the arm muscles, showing the right arm still in the air and  about to drop as soon as the feet strike the ground. The body is lying along  the curve of the semicircle through which the jump has been made.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page061.jpg" width="763" height="750"></p>
<p>In  a competition each competitor is allowed three trial jumps at each height of  the bar, and if he fails on the third trial he is declared out. Running under  the bar in making an attempt to jump counts as a balk, and three balks count as  a trial jump; thus it is always better to balk rather than to attempt a jump if  you do not come squarely on your take-off. A competitor may decline to jump at  any height in his turn, but by so doing he forfeits his right to again jump at  the height declined. Many jumpers wait until the bar reaches a fair height  before entering a competition, thus reserving their strength, but this may only  be done by an athlete who is certain of his ability to clear the bar at that  height. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="BroadJump"></a>The Running  Broad Jump</b></h2>
<p>To  become a successful broad jumper the athlete must, to a certain extent, combine  the skill of the sprinter, the high jumper, and the hurdler, for broad jumping  is a sort of combination of the other three. Like every other athletic feat,  this one requires systematic work both of the body and the head, and  persistent, continuous effort before any kind of form can be developed.</p>
<p>The  first difficulty for the novice to overcome is the laying out of his run and  the arrangement of his take-off. These details are both of the highest  importance, for although he may be a good sprinter and a good jumper, these two  qualities are nullified if the take-off is uncertain.</p>
<p>The  run differs with almost every individual; each athlete must determine this for  himself by experiment. It is necessary to lay out two marks on the  cinder-track; the first one must be a given number of strides this side of the  take-off, and the second at a distance farther back, to suit the taste of the  jumper.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page065.jpg" width="800" height="725"></p>
<p>Bloss,  for instance, counts back nine strides from the take-off to his first mark, and  then goes back a dozen strides farther. Lyons, whose jump is illustrated by the  pictures on pages 66 and 67, goes back only eight strides from the take-off for  his first mark, and about a hundred and five feet to the start of his run. Let  us call, for convenience, the mark nearest the take-off the first mark, and the  other the second mark. These have been laid out, so that the jumper may feel  certain that if his jumping-foot, whether it be the right or the left, strikes  fairly upon the first it will also come squarely upon the take-off, and the  jump will be a good one. It sometimes happens in contests that the conditions of  the wind or of the track will be such that these marks will have to be slightly  altered; and every athlete should be careful to examine the runway before his  event is called, so as to be able to fix the points that he must depend upon  for his success.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page066.jpg" width="700" height="750"></p>
<p>The  position for the start of the broad jump is the same as that assumed by  middle-distance and long-distance runners, and is illustrated by the first  picture of the series on page 66. The jumping foot, in this case the right  foot, is on the starting-mark, with the other slightly in advance. The sprinter  starts down the track, measuring his strides carefully so as to come properly  upon the first mark, and then he sprints at his greatest speed down the cinder-path  to the take-off. If he has measured his distances correctly, he will land, as  is shown in illustration No. 3, with his jumping foot squarely upon the take-off.  If he feels that he has gotten out of his stride, it is better not to take the  jump at all, but to stop, for overstepping the mark by a few inches will ruin  the jump, and underreaching the mark will detract just that much from the  measure of his effort.</p>
<p>The  act of the jump itself is where the greatest strain of muscle and nerve is  required. Just before coming to the take-off, say at the last step, the athlete  should gather himself together and crouch as low as his great speed will  permit, and bring his jumping foot down as hard as possible upon the take-off,  at the same time throwing his hands forward and upward. Bringing down the foot  with such power serves to throw the body into the air, and this movement is  aided by the lifting of the arms. The hardest strain comes on the back muscles,  just as in high jumping. The eyes should be fixed on some distant high point  rather than on the ground where the jump will probably end. This seems to give a better &ldquo;aim,&rdquo; and in many cases adds an inch or so to the distance. The  fourth picture shows the jumper just after he has left the take-off. The next  sees him well on his way, with his legs curled up close under the chin, and his  arms reaching out far forward, so as to throw the balance as much as possible  in that direction. The sequence of the three lower pictures of the series gives  an excellent idea of the arc along which the broad jumper travels. As he comes  down, the jumper should hold his feet as far forward as he can, in order to  gain every inch that is to be had, and he should also keep his head and arms  forward, so as not to lose his equilibrium and fall backward, thus making his  jump void. The sixth picture on page 67 shows the correct attitude for the end  of the flight through the air, the feet being well ahead of the trunk, but the  arms and the head held so far forward that they will bring the body along, too,  as soon as the feet dig into the soft earth below. The feet should be kept well  together on landing in the jumping-box, and a good broad jumper will never  allow himself to fall forward on his hands, but will always resume his erect  position, and walk out of the soft earth instead of rolling out.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page069.jpg" width="613" height="750"></p>
<p>In  field competitions the jump is measured from the outer edge of the sunken board  which marks the take-off, on a line perpendicular to it, to the nearest break  in the ground made by any part of the person of the competitor. If the jumper  oversteps the take-off, or scratch-line, as it is called, and makes a mark in  the earth on the farther side of it, his jump is registered as a foul, but  counts nevertheless as a trial.</p>
<p>Training  for broad jumping consists mostly of hard practice in sprinting short  distances, say from seventy-five to a hundred yards. This is to acquire the  highest speed for the run. High jumping should also be practised, but the  athlete should not attempt to become proficient in the number of inches he can  clear, but rather in the form with which he covers a reasonable height. A spin  now and then over the hurdles will also do a great deal towards improving a  broad jumper&rsquo;s form. After the athlete has become more or less a master of his  event, he will find that half a dozen jumps two or three times a week will be  enough to keep him in practice, and I should advise him by all means to rest  for three or four days before going into a contest.</p>
<p>When  the time for jumping at a field-meeting arrives, never try to do the best work  on the first jump. Be satisfied to make your marks well and to catch the  take-off squarely. Do your very best on the second jump and thereafter. Before  making the first jump, however, try a spin around the track, and take one or  two short jumps on the grass, so as to be thoroughly limbered up; otherwise, if  you have not softened your muscles, you may injure yourself on your first  attempt, and be laid up, as a result, for weeks. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Hammer"></a>Throwing The  Hammer</b></h2>
<p>Throwing  the hammer and putting the shot are the only two weight events now practised by  college and school athletes, although many of the athletic clubs still retain  throwing the 56-lb. weight on their cards. The last named, however, is merely a  sort of exaggeration of the first, and only practicable for very large and very  strong men. With the other two events it is different. Strength, of course, is  a prime requisite, but to attain perfection in either of them the performer  must combine skill with muscular power.</p>
<p>The  intercollegiate rules which govern the throwing of the hammer require that the  hammer-head shall be a metal sphere, and the handle may be of any material. Up  to within three or four years the handle used to be made of hard wood, but  recently athletes have shown a preference for a flexible steel handle. The  combined length of the head and handle must not exceed 4 feet, and the combined  weight must be 16 pounds. The hammer is thrown from a circle 7 feet in diameter.  In making an attempt the competitor may assume any position he pleases, but he  must not step outside of this circle. In a contest each competitor is allowed  three throws, and the best three men in the first trial are allowed three more  throws. The measurement of a throw is made, from the nearest edge of the first  mark made by the edge of the hammer to the point of the circumference of the  circle nearest this mark. There are three kinds of fouls in hammer throwing, which  are not measured, but which count against the competitor as throws. They are:  letting go of the hammer in an attempt; touching the ground outside the circle  with any portion of the body while the hammer is in hand; or touching the  ground forward of the front half of the circle with any portion of the body  before the throw is measured.</p>
<p>The  principal thing for a beginner to realize is that it is necessary to assume the  easiest possible position when at work with the hammer, so as to give the  muscles the fullest play. When the hammer is thrown around the head it should  be kept as far as possible from the body; the arms should not be bent nor the  muscles tightened, and the shoulders should be allowed to move as easily as  possible. This ease of movement of course may only be obtained after long and  assiduous practice; and it is only fair to say at the start that proficiency in  throwing the hammer comes from long rather than from frequent practice. The  most successful athletes in this line have begun by practising half an hour  every day for weeks and months, trying rather to obtain control of the  instrument than length of throw.</p>
<p>As  this is an event which cannot be practised indoors, the winter season must be  given up to exercises that will strengthen the arms and the back, but outdoor  work may be begun as soon as the snow is off the ground. After a man has become  proficient in throwing the hammer, he will find an hour&rsquo;s practice two or three  times a week sufficient to keep him in form, and he ought to rest several days  at least before entering a competition.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page074.jpg" width="800" height="677"></p>
<p>The  detail of the throw proper is a thing that must be carefully studied by all who  wish to do well in the event. First, the athlete steps into the ring holding  the hammer, the head resting on the ground outside the circle. He secures a  firm grasp on the handle, leaning over so as to keep the iron head as far away  from his body as possible. This attitude is shown in the first illustration on  page 74. The second picture shows the hammer just as it is being lifted from  the ground to be whirled around the head. It is plain to see that the arms are  holding the instrument as far from the body as possible. As the heavy ball  gains in velocity it stretches out so that the arms and the handle form a  straight, horizontal line from the shoulders.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page075.jpg" width="800" height="647"></p>
<p>The  fourth picture demonstrates the attitude of the performer as he swings the  hammer about his head in order to gain the necessary momentum. The motion at  the start is slow, but becomes gradually faster and faster, so that the top  speed shall be reached just about as the athlete is ready to turn. It is the  usual custom to throw the hammer three times around the head before turning.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page076.jpg" width="800" height="648"></p>
<p>The  fifth picture shows this turn. When this act is performed the hammer should be  kept well behind the body, and the thrower should try to move his feet around  as fast as he can, and never under any consideration should he allow the hammer  to get ahead of the motion of his body; he must keep it following on behind, or  else the hammer will throw him instead of his throwing the hammer.</p>
<p>The  reason given for jumping around on the last turn is that a man when proficient  in this trick can gain about twenty-five feet on his throw. It is the Irish  method of throwing a hammer, and has been in use in Ireland for several hundred  years. The Scottish way of throwing, still in use in Scotland, is to stand  still. This used to be the method in vogue in this country, but within the last  ten years the A. A. U. adopted the Irish method, and two years ago the  Intercollegiate Association followed suit. A man who has become accustomed to  throw from a standstill has some trouble in getting accustomed to the turn, but  as soon as he has got the knack of the twist he will greatly prefer it over the  old method.</p>
<p>The  sixth picture shows the moment just previous to the final heave when the hammer  is to be let go. This should not be done with a jerk, but the handle should be  allowed to slip from the hands at the proper moment, otherwise any jerking will  destroy the momentum obtained. The last picture of the series, on page 77,  shows the attitude of the thrower after the hammer has left his hands, the  weight of his body being thrown backward, so as to prevent him from stepping  out of the circle.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page077.jpg" width="800" height="690"></p>
<p>The  hammer is thrown from a restricted circle, in the United States, in order to  make the event more scientific. A strong man with very poor form might make an  excellent throw sometime if he were allowed to follow it and to go where he  liked in his efforts. The circle prevents this go-as-you-please method, and  makes it necessary for athletes to acquire form; it also gives a definite place  to measure from, so that there can be no dispute as to the exact distance for  the measurer to lay off.</p>
<p>In  England, collegiate amateur athletes throw from a 30-foot circle. This gives  them a great advantage, for the more turns you can take before throwing, the  greater momentum you can get into your throw. The Englishmen use a  3-foot-6-inch handle, which, on the other hand, is a disadvantage to them,  since the centrifugal force is lessened as the square of the distance from the  centre.</p>
<p>If  athletes used a longer handle than the one accepted in America, which is 4 feet  long, they could not throw the hammer so well as they do now, unless the  performer were of unusual stature, because the head of the hammer would touch  the ground in the first few turns and at the final lift. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Shot"></a>Putting The  Shot</b></h2>
<p>Although  putting the shot and throwing the hammer are events usually performed by the  same man in an athletic competition, it is a fact, nevertheless, that the two  things do not go well together. The hammer develops the pulling muscles in the  back and arms, while the shot, on the other hand, develops the pushing muscles.</p>
<p>At  one time Hickok, intercollegiate champion from &rsquo;93 to &rsquo;95, devoted himself  exclusively to the shot, and soon got himself into such form that he could put  45 feet at any trial. Then he started in to practise with the hammer, and found  his best throw measured only 110 feet&mdash;his best former record being 130 odd. He  kept on systematically working then at both weights, but he soon noticed that  the shot went down as the hammer went up, so that in a month he could scarcely  do 40 feet. At the next Yale-Harvard contest he put the shot 44 feet, which he  considered a lucky performance&mdash;and it was&mdash;although before training for the  hammer event for the same contest he had put the shot over 45 feet. </p>
<p>To  become successful in this event requires long and persistent work, just as in  hammer-throwing. Shot-putting is a great science to develop, and it usually  takes several years before an athlete can really become proficient in the  event. The beginner must first strengthen his arms, giving particular attention  to the development of the triceps and deltoids. This is best accomplished by  work on the parallel bars, and by pounding a bag, as in boxing. The latter  exercise cultivates swiftness. Sprinting is also an important exercise for a  shot-putter, for it teaches him to be quick and light on his feet&mdash;a most  important feature of the general preparation. In addition to these things he  should, of course, constantly work at putting the shot&mdash;in the gymnasium in  winter, and on the field in the open-weather months.</p>
<p>The  shot is put from a 7-foot circle, along 4 feet of the circumference of which  is placed a board 4 inches high. This is the so-called front of the circle, and  the put is measured from this board to the nearest mark made in the ground by  the shot. A fair put is one that has been made without any part of the  competitor&rsquo;s body having touched in front of the circle or on the top of the  board before the measurement is made. A put is counted a foul if the competitor  steps over the front half of the circle or on the board before the measurement  of his put has been made&mdash;and the foul counts as a trial.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page082.jpg" width="454" height="750"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page083.jpg" width="449" height="750"></p>
<p>The  careful athlete will always spare his right arm as much as he can. For  instance, when he picks up the shot he will hold it in his left hand, and he  will do the same while he steps into the circle and gets his footing. After  this has been secured he will roll the shot over into his right palm&mdash;as shown  in illustration No. 3 on page 83&mdash;and then he is ready to start.</p>
<p>Assuming  as easy a position as possible, let the shot be well balanced in the right  hand. Do not grip it tightly. In starting off, as shown in the fourth  illustration, place the whole weight of the body upon the right leg, holding  your left arm forward as a balance. Then take a quick hop with the right leg,  all the time keeping the shot as near the shoulder as possible. Upon alighting  after the hop, touch your left foot to the ground&mdash;and it ought to fall very  close to the board rim. This is the position shown in the seventh illustration.  The eighth shows the next movement, which is the transposition of the feet.</p>
<p>The  correct attitude for getting across the circle on this hop is crouching. Then,  as soon as your left foot touches ground, you bring it swiftly backward,  throwing the entire right side of the body forward; and you turn half around,  so that the right shoulder will be in the exact direction in which the shot is  to be put. After the impetus upward has been given by the legs and body, shoot  the arm outward with all the force at your command, the motion being just such  a one as you would make with the clinched fist against the sparring-bag. This  motion&mdash;the change of feet, the lift, the turn, the thrust&mdash;is a very rapid one,  but the photographs illustrate it very well in the last two pictures of the  series. Furthermore, this movement must be perfectly uniform from beginning to  end, with no jerks and hitches; but it takes long practice to acquire a perfect  smoothness.</p>
<p>The  shot must be allowed to leave the hand easily, and the forward effort of the  put must be so regulated that the equilibrium of the performer will be  maintained. The perfect performer allows his body to bend forward just to that  point where, should he go half an inch farther, he would be forced to step out  of the ring.</p>
<p>The  beginner should practise with the shot for a good period every day. He should  work until he begins to feel tired, but after he has become master of the  event&mdash;say in a year or so&mdash;he need practise but two or three times a week, and  he will find that his form and powers are thus best retained.</p>
<p>In  England the university athletes put the shot from a 10-foot square instead of a  7-foot circle. This gives them a certain advantage over American athletes, for  they get a longer run, and thus more speed, and hence a greater momentum at the  end. Hickok can put the shot from two to three feet farther from a 10-foot  square than he can from a 7-foot circle, and with practice he believes that he  could do even better. If an unlimited run, or series of hops, were allowed, the  record for putting the shot would certainly be much greater than it is at  present; but there is no doubt that the average form of athletes who take part  in this event would be very much lower than it is now with the present  scientific restrictions. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="PoleVault"></a>The Pole  Vault</b></h2>
<p>Training  for pole vaulting should begin in the gymnasium early in the winter. The arm  and chest and dorsal muscles are the ones that must be developed, and these may  best be strengthened by work on the chest weights, rope climbing, dipping on  the parallel bars, and by using the travelling parallels. If you have no  gymnasium to work in, a good exercise is to stand four or five feet off from  the wall of your room and to fall forward on your hands and then push yourself  back into an erect position. Do this a few times at first, increasing the  number as you grow stronger. Sprinting is also as necessary an exercise for the  pole vaulter as it is for the broad jumper. When the weather moderates, work  should be begun and continued daily out-of-doors.</p>
<p><img src="1600951h-images/page088.jpg" width="400" height="542" hspace="20" vspace="30" align="left">For  practice the vaulter must have two square posts similar to those used by the  high jumper, only higher, bored with holes two inches apart above 6 feet, then  one inch apart up to 8 feet, and half an inch apart from there up. The pegs  should be between two and three inches long, and the bar of 1-inch pine should  be about eleven feet long. I say the &ldquo;bar,&rdquo; but it were better to say &ldquo;bars,&rdquo;  for the vaulter will do well to buy a dozen at a time, as they break very  easily. The posts are placed ten feet apart at the end of the runway, which should  be made from eight to ten feet wide, and as long as possible&mdash;say fifty feet.  Like the high-jumping and broad-jumping runways, it is made of cinders, rolled  down hard, and must be kept well dampened, so that it may be springy. Beyond  the posts the earth should be turned over and raked, so as to make a soft  landing-place. This landing-box is usually divided from the cinder-path by a  sunken board running perpendicular to the upright posts, and across their  bases.</p>
<p>The  costume for a pole vaulter should consist of an entire jersey suit, although  many of the best men seem of late to prefer linen trousers. The advantage of  jersey trousers or tights, however, is that they keep the legs warm, and,  consequently, the muscles more limber. The shoes are the regular jumping shoes,  made of kangaroo-skin, and fitted with six spikes in the toes and two spikes in  the heel of the foot that takes off. These two spikes should be fixed at the  extremities of a diagonal drawn through the centre of the heel, to prevent  stone-bruising.</p>
<p><img src="1600951h-images/page089.jpg" width="300" height="554" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="right">The  best vaulting-poles are made of selected, straight-grained spruce, and are  somewhat expensive, on account of the number of sticks that have to be  destroyed in the making of one good one. A good pole costs from $4 to $5. It  should be sixteen feet long, and fitted with an iron spike at the lower end.  Having purchased your pole, wind it with tape for a distance of three or four  feet along that part where it is to be held by the hands in vaulting.</p>
<p>When  you first begin to vault, it is best to place the bar at about 6 feet, and to  work over this height until you have mastered the knack of the event, which is  undeniably a complicated one. </p>
<p>As  in high and broad jumping, the athlete must lay out his take-off and his run.  No rule can be set down for either of these things. Some vaulters like a long  run, and depend entirely upon speed to carry them over the bar, while others  take a short sprint, and throw all their force and energy into the leap. But  whichever method is adopted, both the take-off and the starting-point remain  fixed spots on the runway, and must be experimented with until found, and then  carefully fixed.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page090.jpg" width="570" height="650"></p>
<p>Whether  in practice or in competition, and no matter at what height the bar may be, <i>always</i> measure your pole before  vaulting. This is done by stepping up to the posts and holding the pole upright  until it touches the bar. Let it fall back then, and grasp it with the lower  hand one foot below the point where it touched the cross-piece. For a vaulter  who takes off with the left foot, the lower hand is the left hand. For a man  who takes off with the right foot, it is just the other way. For the sake of  convenience and clearness, let us understand that we are now speaking of one  who takes off with the left foot.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page091.jpg" width="726" height="750"></p>
<p>Having  measured the pole, the athlete seizes it with both hands, thumbs up, the left  hand forward at the spot indicated, and the right hand from 2&frac12; to 3 feet  farther up. He then retreats to the spot which he has determined upon as his  starting-point. He stands in the middle of the runway, with the pole pointing  straight at the uprights, and he fixes his eyes on the bar. From this moment he  does not remove his gaze from that pine stick, or from the handkerchief which  may be hanging from it, until he has made his leap. He should never look to see  where he is placing the pole to vault. The pole will take care of itself.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page092.jpg" width="708" height="750"></p>
<p>For  going down the runway with the pole, styles differ. Some vaulters hold the pole  well up over the chest, while others (like Mr. Buchholz in the accompanying  illustrations) holds the pole well down. The novice will find it better to keep  his right or higher hand well up under his head. The athlete starts down the  runway at full speed, and when he reaches his take-off he plants the pole  firmly into the ground with all his force, and springs straight for the  cross-piece. The moment his body leaves the ground the right arm stretches  taut (illustration No. 3), and his body swings towards the pole. The motion of  the body as it rises is a turning one, the object being to twist and face the  pole, so that when the proper height is reached the back will be towards the  bar, so that the heels may be lifted over.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page093.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p>The  fourth illustration shows the vaulter halfway up from the ground to the bar,  which in this case was at 9 feet. He has turned half around, and by the time he  has nearly reached this height he is still farther around. (Illustration No.  5.) This picture shows the beginning of the working of the arms and of that  twist which is so necessary to carry the body over at great heights. The working  of the arms begins just before this twist is made, and consists of pulling with  the right arm and pushing with the left. This lifts the body, and the twist  carries it over, together with a strong push against the pole at the last  moment, when the athlete feels his upward motion is changing to a fall.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page094.jpg" width="800" height="676"></p>
<p>After  the pole has been let go, all is plain sailing. You have either made your vault  or you have not, and all you have to do is to fall free, or bring down the bar  with you. No effort that the athlete can now make to avoid the bar will avail  him, as the motion in mid-air is practically uncontrollable after the pole has  been abandoned. It is easy to learn how to fall limp into the soft earth below,  and there is never any danger attending this drop. It will be noticed in the  illustration that the twisting motion imparted on the hither side of the bar  turns the body so that the athlete falls with his back to the posts, having  performed one complete gyration in mid-air.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page095.jpg" width="800" height="684"></p>
<p>This  is not by any means a necessary element of the event, however, for many men  drop facing the runway.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page096.jpg" width="608" height="750"></p>
<p>It  is not permissible in vaulting in America to move the upper hand on the pole.  The lower hand may be brought up, and Hoyt, the Harvard vaulter who won that  event at the Olympic games of 1895, usually does this. In England, &ldquo;climbing  the pole&rdquo; is allowed, and athletes there frequently bring the lower hand up  above the other. Some of them manage to make better records by this method,  too. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page097.jpg" width="534" height="750"></p>
<p>When  training for this event the novice should not vault oftener than fifteen times  a day, and he should never work with the pole more frequently than three times  a week. On the intervening days he should do light work at sprinting. Take  every height three times, and then raise the bar, as it is frequently possible  for a man to clear a higher mark after failing at the point below. On one day  each week try to see how high you can go. </p>
<h1 align="center"><b>Bicycling</b></h1>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CycleMen"></a>Bicycling  For Men</b></h2>
<p>Although  bicycling may not properly belong in the same class with the track and field  sports treated in the foregoing chapters, it is yet a sport so universal and so  popular at the present day that it has seemed advisable to insert a few  chapters on the subject in this volume. It is a fact that with all the bicycle  riding done in this country to-day probably half the riders do not sit their  wheels correctly, and consequently increase their expenditure of physical labor  and derive less benefit from the exercise.</p>
<p>There  is perhaps still a question as to what is the proper position for the best and  healthiest bicycle riding. Some good riders sit in one position, have one  length of pedal stride, and use one kind of ankle motion; while others, who  ride just as well, believe in something entirely different, and prove it by  riding long distances or at great speed without either injury or discomfort to  themselves. The suggestions given here must stand, therefore, simply as  suggestions, which can only be proved by each individual to be correct after he  has followed them for some time, and has found them of benefit to himself. They  are followed by many good road riders and racers, and that is some recommendation;  and for the practical pleasure of wheelmen they are probably as good as can be  had.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page102.jpg" width="736" height="750"></p>
<p>In  the first place, it is taken for granted that the reader rides a bicycle for  pleasure, not as a business; that he is a road rider and not a racer on a cinder-track.  In other words, it is for the amateur road rider that these words are intended.</p>
<p>Whoever,  therefore, wishes to ride correctly, and with the greatest ease and power,  should, to begin with, take the ordinary upright position&mdash;such a position as  will correspond to the upright position assumed by any one who is walking, or  by a good horseman in the saddle, or by a cross-country runner in his run. The  prime requisite is that the lungs should have ample space to breathe in. The  chest ought to be thrust well out, the shoulders thrown back, and the head held  up, so that there will be no crowding of the veins that send the blood into the  head. This position is the same as that assumed when horseback riding.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page103.jpg" width="780" height="750"></p>
<p>Of  course, at first no one can keep himself in this position all the time, but you  should try to keep as near it as you comfortably can. Comfort is really the  basis of all such positions, and while, to a certain extent, comfort is the  result of habit, still an upright position is more natural to some riders than  to others.</p>
<p>This  upright seat is dependent on itself. That is to say, you should get in the  habit of taking it so easily that, supposing you could ride without handles,  you would sit thus nevertheless. In other words, you should not depend on your  grip on the handles for support. The hands and arms are not needed as you sit  in a chair, nor as you walk, nor as you ride a horse, except as guides, in one  case to guide the horse, in the other to maintain your equilibrium while  walking, and finally on the bicycle to steer the wheel and keep yourself  balanced on it. A glance at the illustrations on pages 102 and 103 will show  the difference between a correct and an incorrect road position. The incorrect  position shows a rider &ldquo;leaning&rdquo; on his hands and arms. This seat is a very  common one, unfortunately, and if you examine the next twenty riders you meet,  especially those who have ridden fifteen or twenty miles, you are likely to  find most of them in this condition. The arms are rigid, the body is leaning on  them. This thrusts the shoulders back until the shoulder-blades touch each  other. The lungs and neck are pushed forward, and almost every single muscle  and nerve in the upper part of the body is out of place. The result is that  neither heart nor lungs get a good opportunity for action, and the shape of  your upper body is slowly but surely being deformed. In the other position, the  correct one, the rider could at any moment take his hands from the handle-bar  and not alter his position in any way. The two contrasted speak for themselves.</p>
<p>It  may, of course, be said that when a rider becomes tired with riding, the  incorrect position is a great rest. In the first place, this is not true if he  has faithfully learned to ride in the upright seat. Then the other becomes  uncomfortable. In the correct position the wheelman has his arms a trifle bent  at the elbow, so that when he goes over any unevenness in the road his arms  give, and he avoids the shaking of his whole body by the jolting, to say  nothing of the certainty of giving his wheel an unpleasant shaking-up.</p>
<p>In  the most modern bicycles the position of the rider is almost that of a  pedestrian&mdash;that is, the pedals are almost under the saddle, so that he treads  directly up and down. This helps him in keeping his seat without the aid of  hands and arms, and it makes all the muscles of the legs and thighs work in  their proper places, and the whole action of the body becomes natural. All this  can be seen in the illustration of the correct position, and there can hardly  be a question that this is the natural position for a man to take when he  mounts his wheel for a run of a few miles. It naturally brings part of the  weight of the body on the pedals, relieves the very uncomfortable weight on the  saddle, and helps a rider to balance himself without the use of handle-bars,  thus avoiding the &ldquo;wriggling&rdquo; of the wheel, which is so tiresome and so  deadening to a steady road gait.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page106.jpg" width="800" height="687"></p>
<p>The  racing or &ldquo;scorching&rdquo; position is a difficult one to represent in a  photographic reproduction, because each man has his own particular ideas, and  as most men who race make a study of the subject, the result is that there are  many different theories. The general principle is, however, to get a strong  purchase on the handles, in order to give yourself greater power in thrusting  down on the pedals, and at the same time to curl up the body in order to give  as little resistance to the air as possible. Any one who has ridden against the  wind will realize what an enormous difference the air makes in his speed, and  this is, of course, multiplied when the rider is going at a record-breaking  gait.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page107.jpg" width="800" height="727"></p>
<p>But  there are correct and incorrect racing positions, and the two illustrations on  these pages will give a suggestion of them. A &ldquo;scorching&rdquo; position cannot be  taken on a bicycle where the saddle and handle-bars have been arranged for the  upright road position. In the correct scorching position, shown on page 106,  the handles are very low down, and the seat is raised and tipped forward, so  that the rider, while pulling up strongly on the handles, is practically only  leaning against the saddle, and putting all his weight on the pedals. The back  is curved rather than straight, because a much greater purchase can be obtained  in this way; and, indeed, the curved back makes a much more vigorous and  symmetrical attitude.</p>
<p><img src="1600951h-images/page108.jpg" width="300" height="686" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="left"></p>
<p>The  important point to remember is, that you cannot assume the scorching position  and the upright road position on the same bicycle without changing the  handle-bars. To start out for an afternoon run through the country in a  scorching position is absurd. A halfway position&mdash;one between the upright and  the scorching position&mdash;is worst of all.</p>
<p>Another  important point in road-riding is the height of the saddle above the lowest  point in the arc described by the pedals. Experience has shown that when the  pedal is at its lowest and you are sitting squarely on the saddle, your heel  should be on a level with the toe of the boot and your knee a trifle bent. Or,  to put it differently, it should be possible for you to place the arch of your  foot on the pedal and follow it around in its circle without absolutely  straightening your leg to its utmost. Or, still again, as other people describe  it, you should be able to put the toe of your shoe <i>under</i> the pedal and keep it there all the way round, the leg being  straightened at the longest stretch. </p>
<p>The  illustration representing this shows the correct length of stride, and by  referring to the cut on page 108 you will see what results when the rider has  raised his seat so high that he is obliged to let his toes point down with a  straight leg in order to follow the pedal around. The illustration,  representing too long a stride, shows by the wrinkles in the rider&rsquo;s trousers  and shirt that the rider is compelled to lower not only his hips but his whole  side and shoulder, and, of course, the same action is repeated alternately on  the other side. As these photographs were taken by an instantaneous slide, and  the riders were in motion, they are all actual positions during riding, and, as  such, illustrate exactly what happens in each case.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page109.jpg" width="657" height="750"></p>
<p>In  the matter of too long a stride there is real danger to health in the long-run.  The wheelman makes many thousand revolutions in a week, and many of us ride  throughout a good part of the year, and any one can see in a moment that this  constant working of all the vital parts of the body must be anything but  healthful. Furthermore, aside from the question of health altogether, a  wheelman becomes quickly tired out with his continual shifting. He may not know  what is the cause of his weariness, but it is sure to be partly due to his  riding in that way. There is no reason why a rider should want to have a long  stride. It does not give greater speed, and it actually detracts from the power  of his stroke.</p>
<p>And  now a word as to the ankle movement. The force applied through the foot to the  pedal at the moment when the latter is one-quarter way round the circle from  the top, or, in other words, half-way &ldquo;down,&rdquo; is the most valuable and  powerful. Just as in rowing, the strength put into the oar when it is exactly  at right angles with the boat is the most valuable. And, furthermore, the  earlier or later the strength is applied to the pedals the less and less  powerful it becomes so far as sending the wheel ahead is concerned. If you  press down hard when the pedal is nearly or fully down to its lowest point you  are scarcely sending the wheel ahead at all, and all your exertion goes for  nothing. Practically speaking, in order to get the best of your strength in at  the quarter-circle point you should begin to push, and push vigorously, the  moment the pedal has passed by its highest point. The push should be quick and  short, and should stop as soon as possible after the quarter-circle point has  been passed. There is an instant of rest there, and then the heel should be  raised a little, and a sharp upward and backward pull made on this same pedal  at the same instant that the downward push is being made on the other pedal  with the other foot. As a result, the rider is pulling up with one foot while  he is pushing down with the other, and there are therefore two distinct motions  with each leg during a single revolution of the pedal. Many riders only push  downward, and allow the pedals to rise of their own impetus, but they waste a  part of the force of each revolution by doing this&mdash;not one-half, perhaps, but  fully one-third of what they might easily put into it.</p>
<p>As  a result the heel takes a different position relative to the toe at different  parts of one revolution. At the top and bottom the two are on the same level,  but the heel goes down quicker than the toe and comes up quicker. This is very  tiresome for the beginner, and he soon finds the calves of his legs aching  sharply; but in time he will become accustomed to it, and the increased amount  of speed which he gets out of his machine will be surprising even to himself. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="BikeWomen"></a>Bicycling  For Women</b></h2>
<p>It  is fully as important that women should ride properly as it is that men should  do so, and if they will follow carefully the few words of instruction given  here they ought to find little trouble in becoming masters of the bicycle.</p>
<p>When  sitting on a bicycle a woman should assume an upright position, practically as  when walking. The saddle should be broad and flat, and, while most of the  weight of her body rests upon the saddle, it is nevertheless true that she  should put as much of her weight upon the pedals as possible; this not only  makes riding and balancing easier, but it distributes her weight over the  machine, both to her own comfort and to the safety of the wheel. Sitting  perfectly upright, she should be able to place the arch of her instep squarely  on the pedal when it is at its lowest point in the arc, and in that position  her knee should be practically unbent, although, it is perhaps a trifle better if  the knee is what might be called &ldquo;sprung&rdquo; a little. At all events, the body  should not sag from one side to the other as the pedals turn, and when the  rider is forcing the wheel ahead with the ball of the foot on the pedal, the  knee will never be straightened entirely if this rule is followed.</p>
<p>There  is no advantage whatsoever in trying to secure a long reach; it does not help  in any way, and it makes it more difficult to send the machine ahead either  faster or slower. This is particularly noticeable in going up a hill. Women, as  a rule, do not have the fault which many men have of leaning forward far over  the handle. They are more apt to sit upright than most men; but they have one  fault which should be corrected, and that is the position which the handles  occupy in relation to their bodies. A girl should sit upright, and when she  places her hands on the handles her arms should be slightly bent at the elbow.  It is a common thing, however, to see, the arms so much bent that the forearm  forms almost a right angle to the upper arm. This is not only uncomfortable,  but it deprives the rider of the purchase which she needs when forcing the  machine ahead or going up a hill. In other words, it is much more difficult to  pull on the handles when the arms are bent to a right angle than when they are  almost straight. On the other hand, the fault of leaning the weight of the body  on the handle-bars should be avoided with the utmost care, as that forces the  shoulders back and the chin forward on the chest, and in time distorts the  whole symmetry of the upper part of the body. </p>
<p>Mounting  and dismounting, especially the former, should not be tried until the novice  has learned to keep her balance easily while riding. Then mounting will come  more or less naturally, since the difficulty in this operation is not so much  to get on the machine, as to start the wheel soon enough after gaining the seat  to avoid falling off.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page115.jpg" width="781" height="750"></p>
<p>To  begin with, a woman should grasp both handlebars firmly. By means of the hands  the bicycle should be held absolutely perpendicular, neither leaning towards  her person nor away from it. Then, standing on the left of the machine, she  should step over the gearing with her right foot and place it on the right  pedal, which is moved just forward of its highest point in the arc, so that the  first pressure which comes on that right pedal will force the machine ahead as  fast as possible. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page116.jpg" width="622" height="750"></p>
<p>Having  placed her right foot on this pedal, without bearing any weight on it, she then  steps into the position over the gearing which will bring her weight as nearly  as possible immediately over the centre of gravity of the machine. Having  arranged her skirt so that it will be symmetrical when she mounts, she merely  rises by stepping up on the right-hand pedal, and sits into the saddle by a  slow, easy movement. Her weight on the right-hand pedal starts the machine  forward, pulls the saddle in under her, and gives the velocity to the bicycle  which she needs in order to keep her balance.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page117.jpg" width="579" height="750"></p>
<p>One  of the most important things about women&rsquo;s bicycle-riding is the ability to  dismount not only gracefully but at once in case of necessity. In  this, as in mounting, there is no jump anywhere. The rider simply catches the  left pedal as it begins to rise from the lowest point in the arc, and, bearing  her weight on that pedal, allows herself to be forced upward out of the saddle.  This not only brings her into a position to step out of the machine, but also  brings the machine to a standstill, or practically so, unless she is going at a  high rate of speed. When the pedal has nearly reached the top, and the machine  is as near a standstill as possible, she steps, still bearing her weight on the  left pedal, out on the left side of the machine, putting her right foot over  the left foot, and letting the right foot strike the ground first. Both  mounting and dismounting are slow, even movements; there is no quick jump about  them, and the motions are all gradual. As soon as you attempt to leap into the  saddle, or leap out of it, you are almost certain to disturb the equilibrium of  the bicycle itself, and then catastrophe is the result.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page118.jpg" width="593" height="750"></p>
<p>We  are just now in the midst of a change in ideas concerning a woman&rsquo;s bicycle  costume. No woman who has ridden ten times fails to complain of skirts, be they  never so well made. They catch in the rear wheel. They make a sail to catch all  the wind when the wind is blowing against you, and only a bicyclist knows what  a head-wind really means. They are continually in the way.</p>
<p>On  the other hand, trousers do not seem just the thing for girls to wear to-day.  Some time we may all come to the regulation knickerbockers for a bicycle  costume, but just at present a woman who wears them appears to be immodest. As  a matter of fact, however, modesty and ladylike behavior do not depend on the  costume, but on the bearing and character of the rider herself, and it is only  necessary for us to become accustomed to seeing women wearing any kind of a  bicycle costume to think it the proper thing, and probably some kind of  bloomers or divided skirt is less noticeable and more modest than a skirt which  flies about as you ride along the road. The best thing for a woman then is a  divided skirt which is close fitting, which cannot catch in either wheel or in  the gearing of the bicycle, or the ordinary gymnasium bloomers. Either of  these, especially the latter, is much better from a hygienic point of view,  since a great deal of the strain of forcing the machine ahead is saved by them.  In time we shall probably have a regular woman&rsquo;s bicycle costume, which will be  a combination of knickerbockers and bloomers, and then when people once become  accustomed to it, they will wonder how under the sun women ever rode with long  skirts.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page119.jpg" width="594" height="750"></p>
<p>As  to the question of how great a distance a woman shall ride in a day the answer  seems very simple. A woman must remember that she has not been accustomed to  severe physical exercise, that she would not start out at once to run five  miles without stopping, and that she consequently should not ride ten miles on  a wheel either the first time or the thirtieth time. This seems very simple to  read in print, but the fact is that most girls want to ride fifteen miles as  soon as they can get along on a road by themselves.</p>
<p>The  difficult thing is to stop just <i>before</i> you begin to feel the slightest sensation of weariness. There are girls who can  ride twenty, forty, or sixty miles in a day, but this is because they have  begun gradually, and increased their distances by degrees as their bodies got  into good condition. The average girl of fifteen ought not to ride more than  five miles in any one day until she has taken thirty rides within two months&mdash;that  is to say, until she has ridden at least once in every two days. Then she  should not exceed ten miles in a day, or at one time, until she has ridden a  bicycle half a year. After this she can estimate about what she can do without  tiring herself, and she can gradually work up to twenty miles at a time,  without ever having that fagged feeling which is a sure sign that the thing has  been overdone. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CareOfWheel"></a>The Care Of  A Wheel</b></h2>
<p>Considering  the great number of riders of the wheel at present, it is astonishing how few  really know anything about their mounts. A casual visit to any bicycle repair  shop will conclusively dispel all doubts as to the truth of this assertion.  Here you will find long lines of wheels awaiting repairs, some of the damages,  of course, being serious, but the majority are unruly valves, punctures, and  bearings out of adjustment. Particularly noticeable is the number of wheels in  which a slight knowledge of bicycle construction would have enabled repairs to  be made at home.</p>
<p>How  frequently one sees a rider, wrench in hand, dubiously surveying his wheel at  arm&rsquo;s-length, now tightening a nut here or loosening one there, in a vain  endeavor to fix in this manner something that is out of order and prevents his  wheel from running properly! But beyond this fact that something is wrong, he  has not the slightest idea of the nature of the trouble.</p>
<p>Or  again, another enthusiast is deluging every visible chink in his bicycle with oil  in the hope of finding some mysterious squeak, the location of which would be  an easy matter if the position of the different bearings were understood. It is  conceded without exception by all wheelmen that a fair knowledge of the  construction of a wheel is essential to its proper care.</p>
<p><img src="1600951h-images/page123.jpg" width="300" height="289" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="right">Perhaps  the most important thing to be considered is the care of the bearings. In the  advanced stage which bicycle construction has reached today there are a large  number of ball-bearings in a machine&mdash;in fact, there are balls wherever there is  friction, however light. These bearings should have careful adjustment. Perhaps  a glance at the sketch of a wheel bearing will make the construction clearer.  Of course the bearings of different makes of wheel vary, but the principle is  the same in all. The little steel balls are the only medium by which the weight  on the bearing is transmitted from the rim to the cone (hub and axle). To have  the bearing work properly and with the least possible friction, the cone must  not be screwed in so tightly as to jam the balls in the rim, or the wheel will  run hard; at the same time it must not be unscrewed so as to allow too much  play of the balls, or the wheel will &ldquo;wobble.&rdquo; Most bearings have a flattening  on the projection of the cone, between the hub of the wheel and the fork, that  can be caught by a wrench, enabling the cones to be tightened or loosened by  screwing this one only. Some have a thumb-screw in place of the device  mentioned, and other makes adjust the cones by screwing the axle.</p>
<p>In  the adjustment of a wheel&rsquo;s bearings, whether front or rear, a good test to use  against too tight a cone is to raise the wheel clear of the ground, and,  turning it so that the valve of the tire is on top, or nearly so, see if the  weight of the valve will cause the wheel to rotate so that the valve will  describe an arc, like a pendulum, each swing gradually diminishing in length.  If the cone is properly adjusted, the valve should swing back and forth for  some time. Of course the rear wheel will not swing as long as the front, the  valve having to impart motion to the sprocket and pedals. If the cones are too  loose, by gripping the wheel by the rim you will be able to slide it back and  forth on the axle. The most important bearings in the whole wheel are those of  the crank-axle. Here the whole strain of the propelling power comes. The  adjustment of these cones is on the same principle as that of the wheels; the  same test may be used as for the rear wheel. The two bearings in the  steering-head may be adjusted by screwing the cone of the top one, and, of  course, the wheel may be made hard steering or easy, to suit the taste of the  rider. This is not a matter of material importance. The adjustment of the pedal  bearings is not of so great importance, but it should be seen to that they run  evenly and quietly, as it is at this point that the propelling force is  applied. This is usually accomplished by tightening or loosening the outside  cone, which may be gotten at by removing the dust-cap.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600951h-images/page125.jpg" width="800" height="700"></p>
<p>Perhaps  it would be as well to speak here about the frequent mishap of a broken ball in  the bearings. As soon as one is found broken, waste no time in removing it; one  ball less will do no harm; but if the wheel is ridden with a broken one, it  will soon cut the cone and rim all to pieces.</p>
<p>A  word about oiling. Do not go to the excess of either too little or too much  oil. In the first case the cones and rim will wear more quickly and the  bearings run hard; and in the latter the oil will gum, causing hard running,  or, if it does not do this, it will ooze out of the joint, and, collecting the  dust, will become gritty and mar it. The amount and frequency of the oiling, of  course, depend on the use of the bicycle. For a wheel moderately used, a fair  oiling once a week will be found amply sufficient. Most of the bearings have  openings in which to apply the oil, and the oil should not be applied at any  other place than these. In the case of the head bearings, unscrewing the cone  of the upper one will expose it, and will permit the head to be raised so as to  expose the one on the crown for oiling. The pedals may be lubricated by  removing the dust-cap and applying the oil on the outside bearing, tilting the  machine so that it will run down to the inside one.</p>
<p>To  have the bearings in first-rate condition, they should be cleaned every month  or six weeks. In cleaning them the cone should be taken out, carefully wiped,  the balls put in kerosene oil to remove all possible grit, and the rim wiped  clean of all remains of previous oilings. The easiest ones to get at are those  of the front wheel and pedals. In the former case, all that is necessary is to  undo the nuts and spring the wheel out of the fork, unscrewing the movable cone  and taking out the axle. In the pedals, remove the dust-caps and the outside  cone, and slip the pedal off. The rear wheel is a little more troublesome, the  chain having to be removed from the rear sprocket before the wheel can be taken  out. To remove the chain, unscrew the small screw-bolt that holds two of the  links together. The bearings in the head will also be a little troublesome, as  it is necessary to remove the handle-bars and top cone and take out the front  fork. The only remaining bearings to be spoken of&mdash;those of the crank-axle&mdash;are  in some respects the most important to have clean, and at the same time the  most difficult to get at, as it is necessary to take off the cranks before the  axle can be removed or the bearings exposed. After the cranks are removed, the  rest is usually an easy matter.</p>
<p><img src="1600951h-images/page128a.jpg" width="300" height="283" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="left">To  give any general rule for the cranks&rsquo; removal is impossible, as there are so  many methods in use for attaching them to the axle; but to know the way to  remove the several prominent patterns may be useful. We will select four of the  general methods, and these will suffice to cover most of the ground. These may  be best understood from a study of the accompanying sketches. First, the most  common way of putting the cranks on with a key or pin is shown in Fig. 1. To  remove these, unscrew the nut on the pin and drive it out. This may be done at  home, but as a rule the pins are put in, or become wedged in, so tightly that  it is frequently advisable to have them driven out at a shop. In the absence of  proper punches, there is the chance of badly mutilating the pin in removal.</p>
<p><img src="1600951h-images/page128b.jpg" width="300" height="300" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="right"></p>
<p>The  second general class is the clamp attachment. There are several patterns in  use, but the one shown in Fig. 2 is most commonly seen. To free it from the  axle the bolt is removed, and it is frequently necessary to insert a wedge to  spring the clamps free from it.</p>
<p>In  the third class the crank fits in a continuation of the axle, usually  projecting a little, so as to permit locking with a nut, as in Fig. 3.  Sometimes it passes a little to one side of the centre, and, again, exactly  through it.</p>
<p><img src="1600951h-images/page128c.jpg" width="300" height="330" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="left"></p>
<p>The  fourth and general class is where the axle and cranks are made in two forgings,  as shown in Fig. 4 (the sketch represents a cross-section of the barrel), the  part shown being half, and the two sections fitting together by teeth. These  cranks are removed by unscrewing in the opposite direction to which they  revolve in the propulsion of the machine.</p>

<p>The  next part of the wheel we will turn our attention to is the chain&mdash;the medium  through which the motion is imparted from the driving-gear to the rear  sprocket. Frequently after a long ride on rough roads, or perhaps a few days of  usage, the chain will be found to have slackened up considerably. There are  many devices in use for taking up this slack&mdash;all of them, however, working on  the principle of moving the rear axle back and forth, and being more or less  improvements of a few general patterns.</p>
<p><img src="1600951h-images/page129b.jpg" width="250" height="254" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="left">In  the device represented by Fig. 5, after loosening the nut, the axle is moved  backward or forward by turning the screw in the proper direction.</p>
<p>If  it is desired to move the axle back (Fig. 6) the screw is tightened, or if it  is desirable to move it forward (nearer the cranks), the screw is unscrewed,  and the axle pushed forward by gentle taps with a wrench. In the method  represented by Fig. 7 the whole bar swings with the axle.</p>
<p><img src="1600951h-images/page129c.jpg" width="275" height="348" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="right"></p>
<p>This  adjustment is tightened or loosened in the same manner as the preceding one,  with the exception that the nut on the bolt holding the upper end of the bars  has to be loosened a trifle. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 8 the axle is  adjusted without the aid of a screw. When in the right place, it is held by the  tightening of the nuts, teeth in the washer engaging others around the edge of  the slot.</p>
<p>No  part of the machine collects the dirt more quickly than the chain, it being  found liberally sprinkled with grit after every ride. As long as it runs  smoothly and quietly it does no harm, though when it gets rather thick it would  be best to wipe it lightly with a rag or a stiff brush. When a chain is dry or  very dirty it shows a tendency to kink, at the same time producing a rattling  noise, joined with sharp snappings. When in this condition, it should have a  thorough cleaning. First wipe with a rag, and then remove the chain from the  sprockets; put it in kerosene oil to soak, wiping dry with a rag. The only troublesome  part of the cleaning operation will be to replace the chain. This is effected  by passing one of the ends of it over the rear sprocket, joining them with the  screw-bolt; then, catching some of the links on the top teeth of the front  sprocket, revolve it, and this will spring the chain on.</p>

<p>The  mention of a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; chain brings up the subject of chain lubricants. There are a  great many on the market, and riders differ in opinion as to their relative  merit. Two facts are clear, however. If a lubricant is too liquid it collects  grit very quickly; on the other hand, if too dry, it does not work in the  joints of the chain properly. Oil, for this reason, is obviously very bad, and  should only be used on the road when a chain unexpectedly runs dry or hard. The  prominent constituent of most lubricants is graphite, the different makes  varying usually in the amount of oil or other dissolving agent contained. Some  wheelmen recommend powdered graphite alone, but my experience has found a  mixture of graphite and oil having about the constituency of vaseline to be  very satisfactory. All lubricants, however, should be applied in the same  manner. Rest the step of the bicycle on a box or chair, so that the rear wheel  may revolve freely, and apply the lubricant rather sparingly; too much will  only serve to collect dirt. Spin the wheel rapidly for a minute, so as to  permit it to work into the joints, and then, slowly revolving, wipe the waste  off the top of the chain.</p>
<p>We  have now reached in our discussion of the bicycle a part just as essential to  the running ability as anything previously mentioned&mdash;the tires. On account of  the wear and tear upon the tires, from one cause or another, they require much  care. It is the tires that take up the jolts from the inequalities of the road,  and upon their proper degree of inflation depends the easy running of the  wheel. Quite a study may be made of this, the pressure varying for the  different uses the wheel is to be put to. Without exception the rear tire  should be harder than the front; if the latter is more tightly inflated than  need be, it creates unnecessary jarring, which manifests itself in a numbing of  the wrists. For riding over city pavements the softer the tires, without  endangering the rims, the less jolting; but on good roads hard tires are best,  as there is less friction, because a smaller surface is presented to the  ground.</p>
<p>From  the inflation we will turn to the valve, the most important part of the tire.  This is frequently a source of much annoyance from leakage. Whenever in doubt  as to the valve&rsquo;s effectiveness, immerse it in water, and the air-bubbles will  soon show the size and location of a leak, if there is one. <img src="1600951h-images/page132.jpg" width="250" height="426" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="left">In  all experiences with pneumatic tires you will find water the greatest enemy of  leaks, and in all cases where one is of sufficient size to be an annoyance,  water will surely locate it. The weak point in most valves seems to lie in the  plunger that closes the opening through which the air is admitted. Most valves  work on the principle explained in the sketch. When the air is forced in, the  plunger<i> A</i> is pushed down, admitting  the air into <i>D</i>, and so into the tire;  and when the downward stroke of the pump ceases, the spring <i>B</i>, assisted by the pressure of the air  in the tire, is supposed to push <i>A</i> tightly up against the partition <i>E</i>,  and so close the opening. Right here the trouble occurs. For various reasons  the spring sometimes does not push the plunger up, and if the pressure is not  sufficient to do it, when the pump is removed the air forced in with so much  labor blows out in a few seconds. In this case, first drop a little benzine in,  as perhaps the valve may be dirty or stuck in some manner; and if this has not  the desired effect, it will be necessary to remove the valve. This annoyance is  most commonly caused by the spring becoming too much compressed, but this may  be remedied by removing the spring and stretching it a little. Frequently the  plunger becomes jammed against <i>E</i>, and  in pushing it in it disappears entirely within the body of the valve. Here also  it is often necessary to take the valve apart.</p>
<p>Puncture  is a word that makes every wheelman wince. A little hole in the tire makes the  bicycle, which a few seconds before was a means of travelling, a useless  encumbrance. But in this case it does not always follow that it is an  encumbrance, for if a pocket repair kit is carried, or the rider can make the  best use of things at his disposal, some kind of stoppage of the escape of wind  can frequently be effected. The single tube, or &ldquo;hose-pipe,&rdquo; is the easiest to  patch up on the road. The leakage can usually be stopped by cementing a piece  of rubber over the puncture and binding it on securely with tire tape. Perhaps  if the rider is skilled he may effect a permanent repair by plugging it. Now a  hint to the rider who goes on the road with only a wrench in his pocket; and if  he is given to the chewing-gum habit, it may be of use. A very novel and  effective repair for a single-tube tire may be made by a little chewing-gum and  some bandages. After locating the opening, apply some freshly chewed gum and  work it in, leaving a fair-sized piece on the tire, and bind it with a  handkerchief, if nothing better offers.</p>
<p>Sometimes  it is difficult to locate a puncture when on the road. After examining the tire,  and noting the likely places, apply saliva at these spots, and when the right  one is found, bubbles will be noticed.</p>
<p>The  permanent repair of a double-tube tire is to patch the inner one. Let the air  out, and if the tire is &ldquo;cemented&rdquo; pull it off, and if a &ldquo;clincher,&rdquo; spring it  off, being careful in pushing the valve through the hole in the rim. If it is  the &ldquo;clincher&rdquo; pattern the inner tube may be readily removed, but if a  &ldquo;cemented&rdquo; tire it is a trifle more difficult. In the latter there is a slit  about eight inches long in the outer tube, where the valve comes through, which  is held together with lacing. Cut this lacing, and the two ends of the inner  tube will be seen to come together there. Fasten a string to one end, and,  catching hold of the other end, pull the tube out, being careful to leave the  string in the casing. When removed inflate tightly, and, grasping firmly a  section between your hands about a foot long, immerse in water and stretch to  the utmost; and if the puncture is in this section, this will sufficiently enlarge  it to permit the free escape of bubbles. Continue in this way throughout the  whole tube, and when the puncture is located, bite a little piece of the rubber  out from around it, so that it may be more readily found; let the air out, and  cut a piece of rubber to fit over the hole, covering the edges of the puncture  and this piece with a rubber cement made for this purpose; and when a trifle  dry, place the patch on and put a weight on top. Inflate and test in water for  leaks, and if all is right let the air out and fasten one end to the string,  which was carried into the outer tube on the removal of the inner one, and by  this haul it in place again, lacing up the slot with string. Inflate again,  and, after covering the rim of the wheel with cement, place it on and let it  dry, revolving the wheel with the rim and tire in water so as to make the  cement set.</p>
<p>The method of making permanent repairs in a hose-pipe  or single-tube tire is simple&mdash;namely, by plugging. A rubber plug with a head  like a rivet is covered with cement and inserted in the puncture, head inside  the tire; and when it sets, the projecting part on the exterior is trimmed off  evenly.</p>
