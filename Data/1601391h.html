  <p class="first">THE spirit of adventure, like that of jealousy, mocks the
  meat it feeds on, though there are certain captious critics who rend that
  familiar Shakespearean quotation in another form. But be that as it may, the
  fact remains, and so it came about that after a considerable pause the Gentle
  Buccaneers found themselves going again quite two thousand miles from their
  base. Things had been quiet enough since the episode of the <i>Grey
  Raider,</i> so that our adventurers were glad to be on the wing again. Now,
  everything was fish that came to their net, especially since Graydon had hit
  upon the happy idea that the <i>Gehenna</i> should establish herself as a
  central organisation for Red Cross funds. In other words, all the loot
  vicariously gathered in those golden seas henceforth would be transmitted
  anonymously to the American Red Cross Society. It was a sort of Robin Hood
  combination and a salve to conscience at the same time.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when the <i>Gehenna</i> fetched up alongside a certain island
  in the South Pacific and Endellion came in contact with a wily Oriental
  called Jim Shi and listened to his flowery tale about pearls and other
  gilt-edged articles of commerce, he was disposed to fall in with the
  suggestion of the Chinaman that they should visit the place called Shara and
  try their luck in the most strictly preserved piece of water in the world. It
  was Japanese water, that same, and usually carefully patrolled by a destroyer
  or two, but just now, with the big war on, and the traffic in pearls more or
  less at a standstill, these sacred covers were likely to be loosely guarded.
  Here, therefore, was an adventure after the heart of the Buccaneers, wherein
  personal danger and large areas of valuable loot were impartially
  distributed.</p>

  <p>Apparently Jim Shi knew all about it. He had evidently given the matter
  his careful consideration, and, indeed, he said frankly enough that he
  regarded the coming of the <i>Gehenna</i> as a direct interposition of
  Providence, or the Chinese equivalent for that same manifestation.</p>

  <p>Jim Shi was a wealthy Chinaman, and a sometime mandarin, who hinted pretty
  broadly that he had either left his country for his country's good, or that
  he had found the atmosphere of Peking not so salubrious as it had been at one
  period of his picturesque career. Therefore, he had retired from China,
  taking his loot with him, and, at the same time, accompanied by his daughter
  Lota, the vivacious and fascinating young woman who had learnt a great deal
  of Western diplomacy and its equivalent during a three years' residence in
  San Francisco.</p>

  <p>She was quite young, pretty, and fascinating, and, to say the least of it,
  liberal-minded. She presided gracefully and tactfully over her father's
  luxurious establishment on the little island, which practically belonged to
  him, and she was a great favorite with the Gentle Buccaneers. To begin with,
  she spoke English quite as well as they did, she played and sang divinely
  with a strong leaning towards the musical comedy and ragtime type of harmony
  which is almost the second nature of the Western girl. She was learned on the
  subject of cocktails, flippantly familiar with the sort of conversation that
  usually revolves round the "morning after the night before," in fact, a man's
  woman to her finger tips, so that before long she and the Gentle Buccaneers
  were the best of friends. It was she, as a matter of fact, who suggested the
  expedition, an enterprise that she had expressed her firm intention of
  joining.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am coming along, Mr. Endellion," she said. "On that you can bet
  your bottom dollar. I want adventure, and, like the little boy in your soap
  advertisement, I shan't be happy till I get it."</p>

  <p>All this with a laugh and a twinkle in her eye, which were very alluring,
  especially when the words were uttered by a Chinese girl, dressed in
  picturesque costume, with a Turkish cigarette between her red lips, and a dry
  Martini within reach of those dainty hands with the henna-dyed finger nails.
  Endellion was a professed woman-hater, but that solemn ritual of his
  certainly did not extend to the fascinating Lota, whom he regarded more as a
  colleague than a weaker vessel.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Lota will certainly come along," Jim Shi said to Endellion as the
  preliminaries were arranged. They were sitting out on the broad verandah in
  the moonlight, and the whole of the Buccaneers were gathered there, for they
  were sailing on the morrow for a more or less unknown destination nearly two
  thousand miles away. "Lota will never consent to stay behind."</p>

  <p>"She won't," Lota said emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, that's settled, then, anyhow," Shacklock remarked. "But, say,
  who's the pilot?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I have the pilot all right," Jim Shi murmured. "And remember, I have
  been to the little island of Shara before. I have seen the wonders of the
  place, and I know the treasure that lies there. And since the war began there
  has been no pearl-fishing in the bay at all."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but who's the pilot?" Wallace insisted.</p>

  <p>"Ah, he is a Japanese in my employ. A diver. He has been working there for
  years. And it is he who will be our pilot. You leave it to me,
  gentlemen."</p>

  <p>So, in the fullness of time they set out on board the Gehenna with a
  pilot, and made their way leisurely through those glorious seas to their
  destination. They were carrying a rather larger complement than Endellion
  liked, a dozen or so of Kanakas and perhaps a score of Chinese coolies that
  had appeared as if by magic almost as soon as the expedition had begun to
  take shape. They made rather a crowd on board the yacht, but they were fine
  sailors for the most part, and seemed to stand in considerable awe of Jim
  Shi. There was a workmanlike air about them, an unusual discipline that did
  not fail to show itself to Wallace, otherwise known as the Brigadier.</p>

  <p>"Now, where did the old man pick them up?" he asked Endellion. "They ain't
  any ordinary lot of Chinks. If those chaps haven't been in the Chinese navy,
  I'll eat 'em. Do you notice how familiar they are with a rifle?"</p>

  <p>Endellion lounged along the deck with his glass in his eye and a cigarette
  in his mouth, and shrugged his shoulders indifferently. For the time being,
  at any rate, he was little more than a passenger on his own ship, and
  therefore not in the least disposed to interfere.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what the devil does it matter?" he asked. "Besides, it will be all to
  the good if we have any trouble with some nosing Japanese destroyer. It's
  nothing to do with me. We're out here on a fine excursion with a bit of
  danger in it, and if it turns up trumps, why, it ought to mean at least
  twenty thousand to the American Red Cross. Be a patriot, old man, be a
  patriot, and if you can't be a patriot, don't be an ass."</p>

  <p>All the same the Brigadier was not entirely convinced. He went about from
  day to day with his eyes wide open, like "a chiel's amang them takin' notes."
  It rather disturbed him to see how Jim Shi had practically taken possession
  of the <i>Gehenna,</i> Jim Shi in a British naval uniform, no less, and
  evincing a knowledge of seamanship that was rather strange in a man who had
  spent most of his life ashore. And if Jim Shi was enthusiastic about
  anything, it was over the merits and beauties of the <i>Gehenna.</i> If he
  had a yacht like that, he said, before long he would he king of the South
  Pacific. But he lacked the couple of hundred thousand pounds or so necessary
  for the purchase of such a craft, and, that being so, he had to content
  himself with the role of temporary owner and Captain.</p>

  <p>It all sounded innocent and friendly enough, but the Brigadier was far
  from satisfied, though he would have found it difficult to put his suspicions
  into words. And so the time went on until one golden afternoon the
  <i>Gehenna</i> passed between two high cliffs of basaltic rock that shut in a
  long, narrow tongue of water that represented the finest pearl-fishing ground
  in the world. This shiny isthmus was flanked on either side by beaches of
  golden sand, and at the further end was locked in again by a rampart of the
  same black rock. There was not too much room for the <i>Gehenna</i> to enter,
  for there was a big sandbar across the mouth of the bay, with a deep channel
  only on the lee side. Nobody but an experienced pilot who knew every inch of
  the way could have steered the yacht safely to her anchorage ground.</p>

  <p>"Um," Endellion said as he looked around him. "I don't know that I am
  particularly enamored with this. It may be the finest pearl-fishing in the
  world, but there's not enough elbow-room for my taste. If we get caught here,
  we shall be like rats in a trap. We shan't even have a fighting chance."</p>

  <p>Jim Shi smiled reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that will be all right, Mr. Endellion," he said. "We can keep a watch
  post on top of the cliff yonder much more efficiently than you could from the
  deck of the boat. And we could warp out in an hour. And given the
  <i>Gehenna</i> half a league, there's not a gunboat in the Japanese navy that
  could touch her."</p>

  <p>All of which was perfectly true, so that Endellion did not contest the
  point. Therefore, he resigned himself cheerfully to the hands of his guide,
  and for the next day or two spent a good deal more time in the company of the
  fascinating Lota than is consistent with the shibboleths of a hardened
  woman-hater.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the pearl-fishing proceeded in earnest, and continued for the
  best part of a fortnight with quite lamentable results so far as the Red
  Cross was concerned. Day followed day with not more than a mere handful of
  pearls recovered from the vasty deep, and those of a quality not likely to
  cause any sensation on the market.</p>

  <p>Jim Shi shook his head and professed not to understand. It was here, he
  said, that he had seen enough pearls harvested in a month to supply the
  markets of Europe for years. Perhaps there had been an epidemic amongst the
  pearl oysters, perhaps some other enterprising adventurer had forestalled
  them. And again, there had been high seas running out in the open,
  accompanied by heavy gales, and perhaps this had disturbed the fishery. But,
  anyway, the pearls were not there.</p>

  <p>To all of which Wallace listened with a certain grim cynicism. He was the
  one of the Buccaneers who understood more of the language of the coolies and
  the Kanakas than all the rest of his colleagues put together. So one evening
  after dinner, when the rest of them were seated over their coffee and
  cigarettes in the cabin, he sneaked forward with a bottle of rum, and
  proceeded to open the hearts of a couple of the Kanakas who had been helping
  in the diving operations.</p>

  <p>They were shy enough at first, reticent and suspicious of the white man
  who asked many questions, but gradually as the generous spirit warmed them
  they became more communicative.</p>

  <p>"No pearls, here, master," the bigger of the Kanakas volunteered. "Been no
  pearls here for years. Just a few of 'em, but not worth coming all this way
  for. China master, he know that as well as we do."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he does, does he?" Wallace said softly.</p>

  <p>"Just so, boss. We came with him two year before, an' find nothing. All
  gone to American man, and Japanese man all finished. No doing, master."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Wallace crept away, turning over this problem in his
  mind. Now, what the deuce was that wily Chinaman about? Why had he dragged
  the <i>Gehenna</i> and her crew all this way on a wild-goose chase, and
  practically imprisoned them in this rock-bound lagoon? And why had he talked
  so glibly about the dangers of the expedition and the perils of Japanese
  destroyers unless it had been with the desire to appeal to their innate love
  of adventure? Unless, perhaps, he had designs on the yacht.</p>

  <p>Ah, that was it, no doubt. It came to Wallace like a lightning flash. Ever
  since the <i>Gehenna</i> had first bulked largely on the ex-Mandarin's vision
  he had talked about nothing else. He never lost an opportunity to get on
  board, he had studied the yacht with loving intention from her funnels to her
  keel. And had he not more than once declared that he would gladly sacrifice
  all he possessed to call himself the owner of a boat like the
  <i>Gehenna?</i></p>

  <p>The more Wallace thought over the matter the less he liked it. He
  reflected that the Buccaneers knew little or nothing of the Chinaman, and
  that there would probably have been no particularly friendly intercourse
  between them had it not been for Lota and her manifest charms. And then again
  Wallace thought of those well-trained, well-drilled coolies who were quite at
  home on board the craft. And he thought more especially of the little
  Japanese called Li, the taciturn Oriental who had hardly spoken a word since
  he came on board, and had taken over the <i>Gehenna</i> in the character of
  pilot.</p>

  <p>These suspicions Wallace confided to his companions an hour or so later,
  when Jim Shi and his daughter had retired and the Gentle Buccaneers had the
  cabin to themselves. At first Endellion was disposed to make light of what
  Wallace said, but gradually his arguments went home, and for a few minutes an
  uneasy silence reigned in the cabin.</p>

  <p>"But what do you make of it?" Endellion asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm dashed if I know," Wallace said. "At any rate, you can see for
  yourself that there are no pearls here, and those Kanakas were telling the
  truth when they said the fishing-ground had been worked out years ago. The
  question for you chaps who have got more brains than I have is, why did the
  Chinaman bring us here, and what does he expect to gain by it?"</p>

  <p>The Buccaneers looked from one to the other doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Can any of you chaps see where the catch comes in?" Endellion asked. "For
  I am hanged if I can. Still, there must be one somewhere, and I think the
  best thing we can do is to get out of it as soon as possible. So I'll tackle
  Jim Shi in the morning."</p>

  <p>Jim Shi was blandly regretful, profusely apologetic, but at the same time,
  raised no objections. He was almost like a Frenchman in his profuse
  apologies. He himself had been deceived, and so, he was quite sure, had his
  daughter. And Lota sighed and simpered with many sentimental glances from
  those fine eyes of hers, though she was cheered by the reflection that she
  had had quite a good time in the company of the Buccaneers. She would see
  them again some day, perhaps, and so forth and so on, to the great delight
  and comfort of most of the party with the exception of Endellion, who was
  still worried.</p>

  <p>He was worried all the more when he discovered how slack had been the
  watch which had been kept on the top of the cliff, and he was inclined to
  curse himself roundly when he regarded the big basalt rocks on either side
  and realised, perhaps for the first time, what a rat-trap he was in if
  anything happened to prevent the <i>Gehenna</i> from putting to sea. So,
  without saying anything to anyone, he made arrangements to get up anchor the
  following morning, and daybreak saw the nose of the yacht turned to the
  open.</p>

  <p>And that, sad to relate, was as far as she went. The pilot came on the
  bridge an hour later with a serious face and announced the fact that the
  narrow channel by the side of the sandbar had entirely silted up. There was
  not sufficient room, so the Japanese averred, to warp out a barge. What had
  happened he did not know, but the fact remained that the yacht was a prisoner
  as securely fixed there as if she had been towed by a submarine into a German
  harbor.</p>

  <p>Naturally enough, in the exciting pastime of pearl-fishing, nobody had
  noticed what had been going on, and, in any case, nobody could have expected
  it. But here they were landlocked in that long tongue of shining water with
  the high cliffs on three sides of them. If they could not get away, and that
  appeared to be absolutely impossible, then they would have to hang on there
  until the provisions were exhausted and slowly starve to death. That was
  unless help came along, which was extremely problematical.</p>

  <p>At the suggestion of Li, the pilot, Endellion went out himself in one of
  the ship's boats to assure himself that the catastrophe had not been
  exaggerated. Half an hour convinced him that Li's statement was no more than
  the truth. Then, for the next few hours, something like consternation reigned
  on the deck of the <i>Gehenna.</i></p>

  <p>True to his caste, Jim Shi was imperturbable enough, and so, too, was his
  daughter. If it was the will of the gods of the lagoon that they should all
  perish, then they must. With which Jim Shi helped himself to another cigar
  and sat himself with great comfort on the deck.</p>

  <p>"It is fate, Mr. Endellion," he said. "Some hidden trick of the sea,
  perhaps a slight earthquake somewhere. We shall have to pole the boats over
  the sandbar and leave the <i>Gehenna</i> here. She may be still in the lagoon
  when we get back, but I very much doubt it. If one of those Japanese gunboats
  comes along they'll blow her all to pieces. I hope that she is properly
  insured."</p>

  <p>"Not for a bob," Endellion said. "If you can tell me where I can insure
  what is practically a pirate ship, then I shall be greatly obliged."</p>

  <p>"Mayn't I be permitted to do it myself?" Jim Shi asked suavely. "As I got
  you into this mess, I feel that I must do my best to get you out of it. I ask
  you to sell me the yacht as she stands, of course, at a speculative price,
  and if I can manage to get her off again, then it will be all the better for
  me. It is a fair offer."</p>

  <p>"So it seems," Endellion said drily. "But I should like to consult the
  others first."</p>

  <p>Endellion went off coolly enough, but he was raging inwardly. That some
  diabolical trick was being played upon himself and his companions by this
  wily Oriental he did not doubt for a moment.</p>

  <p>"But what is it?" he asked the others. "How is it worked? That channel is
  silted up all right, and we are prisoners. Now I don't believe that Jim Shi
  and his coolies could have carried the sand there, and it certainly wasn't
  there when we got inside. I believe that blackguard of a pilot could tell us
  if he liked."</p>

  <p>"By gad, he shall," Wallace cried. "Now you leave him to me. I can speak
  enough of his language."</p>

  <p>An hour before dawn Wallace, revolver in hand, walked into Endellion's
  cabin with Li following reluctantly behind. Wallace closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Now, then, spit it out," he said.</p>

  <p>"Jim Shi is my master," Li suggested.</p>

  <p>"Something more than that, isn't he?" Wallace said encouragingly. "Don't
  be shy."</p>

  <p>"My master," Li repeated doggedly. "I work for him for two year. He pay me
  little, so little that I can hardly live, and then,
  excellencies&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You borrowed a bit," Wallace prompted.</p>

  <p>At this point Li found his tongue.</p>

  <p>"Two hundred of your pounds," he said. "To escape to my own country. For I
  was not so much a servant as a slave. And that great fat devil, he found out,
  and he threaten to lock me up in the prison house. Since that date he pay me
  nothing, he beat and starve me, so I have hardly no food till the big white
  yacht comes along, and then the fat devil grows kind. Because I know the
  secret of this place. Because I can make the channel to close himself and
  shut in the great white yacht so that she goes to sea no more. And then Jim
  Shi he buys the boat at his own price, and then when the times comes and the
  white men from the west are gone the channel he open to himself again and
  behold the ship belongs to my master."</p>

  <p>"Oh, so that's the game, it it?" Endellion said softly. "Now, my friend,
  how much?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't you worry about that," Wallace chipped in. "I have settled with
  our friend here. Now, Li, I am going to lock you in my cabin till the
  morning. Not that I mistrust you, but I want to be on the safe side. After
  breakfast you and I and the skipper are going up to the top of the lagoon on
  a little shooting expedition. You are going to show us where we can find a
  seal or two. And, incidentally, you are going to show us something else."</p>

  <p>"That's so, master," the impassive Li agreed. "You pay me and I serve you
  well. Give me money to get back to my own country, and I'll show you
  everything."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Wallace said. "Come along."</p>

  <p>With that he shepherded the little Jap in his own cabin and returned to
  Endellion again.</p>

  <p>"Let's have it," the latter said.</p>

  <p>"Well, the whole thing's an ingenious plant," Wallace explained. "We were
  lured here on purpose. That greasy old Chink wants the yacht, and, but for a
  bit of sheer luck, I guess he would have got it. Now, this game has been
  played before on a smaller scale, though it has only been possible since the
  pearls gave out. I didn't know what the game was in the least, but I have had
  my eye on our friend Li for a day or two and I didn't quite like the way he
  was shaping. So when the bottom fell out of everything this morning I thought
  I'd tackle him, and I did. I couldn't frighten him&mdash;you can't frighten a
  man who looks upon Hari Kari as a sort of luxury&mdash;so I dropped that tack
  and tried bribery instead. I told the little blighter that I knew there was a
  trick somewhere and offered him five hundred of the best and a passage to his
  native land if he would give the show away. You see, I knew he must know all
  about it, being the pilot. Then, by gad, he nearly wept on my neck and cursed
  Jim Shi by a thousand gods. Then I got the whole thing out of him. It's all
  right, old man."</p>

  <p>"Oh, is it?" Endellion said dubiously. "Then perhaps you had better tell
  me. This is the time when even my friend, Marcus Aurelius, is a little
  wanting."</p>

  <p>"I tell you it's all right," Wallace protested. "We can't get off
  to-morrow quietly with the Jap, then you'll see for yourself. I don't want to
  spoil your pleasure."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Endellion ceased his questions and retired to spend a sleepless
  night. They got off in the morning in one of the boats and pulled up under
  the head of the lagoon on the sand at the foot of the big frowning cliff. The
  tide was beginning to make, and already the sea was forming at the mouth of
  the caves along the cliff. Into one of these Li made his way, followed by his
  companions until he reached the dripping weed-clad wall at the far end. Then
  he stooped down and did something with a long rusty bar that appeared to be a
  lever, and as if by magic a hole appeared at the back of the cave showing a
  wide expanse of sea and wave and sky beyond. An immense fragment of rock
  balanced on its slippery base had turned sideways, and Endellion gasped as he
  began to grasp the inwardness of it all.</p>

  <p>"I think I begin to understand," he said. "Now, I wonder who hit upon that
  ingenious dodge? What clever adventurer found out the secret of that rocking
  stone?"</p>

  <p>"So you have tumbled to it?" Wallace asked.</p>

  <p>"I think so," Endellion said. "At half tide this cave is full of water,
  and so long as there is no outlet for the current the sand on the bar at the
  far entrance begins to silt up. With the strong tides running here the sand
  would silt enough in a week to keep the <i>Gehenna</i> here for ever. But in
  a long tongue of water like this directly that hole was made the strong tide
  would suck all that sand away in the course of a week. Isn't that right,
  Li?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right, master," Li said. "We leave him big hole open and in two or
  three days' time the bar is clear again. Ah, this is not the first time this
  what you call game has been played here. Chinamen he know the secret since
  nearly a century ago, and when I was diver here I learnt him, and because I
  thought it would please Jim Shi, I told him, too. And when the white
  excellencies come along with a big beautiful yacht Jim Shi tells me the story
  of the pearls, and they come here to see for themselves, and they come to
  stay as you'd say. But Jim Shi he no good. Much cruel man who care nothing
  for poor Japanese so long he make use of him. And when the excellency there
  with the glass in his eye promised me five hundred of your pounds and a
  passage home, then I tell the truth. And why, because I don't care damn for
  Jim Shi any more."</p>

  <p>This fairly lucid explanation being satisfactory, a seal or two was
  dispatched by way of giving proper local color to the expedition, and a
  quiet, thoughtful, though absolutely satisfied shooting party returned to the
  yacht. To one by one, in the seclusion of his cabin, was told the secret by
  Endellion.</p>

  <p>At any rate, there was no interference now with the natural flow of the
  tide that ran through the cave under an arm in the big cliffs, and for the
  next two or three nights the Gentle Buccaneers sat down to dine with their
  Oriental guests with an easy mind and the comfortable assurance that the
  fourth day would see them well out to sea again.</p>

  <p>It was a case of gathering roses whilst they might, a sort of false,
  reckless gaiety with the fear of starvation before their eyes, a kind of
  philosophy that Jim Shi openly applauded. He could afford to wait till the
  time came to drive a hard bargain with Endellion and therefore he was more
  than usually friendly.</p>

  <p>So, also, was the fascinating Lota until she came smilingly on deck just
  before breakfast on the fourth morning, followed by her father. But the
  smiles disappeared from the faces of both of them as if by magic when they
  found that instead of being still at anchor in the lagoon, they were moving
  smoothly and noiselessly over a golden sea as smooth as a mirror. Just for a
  moment Jim Shi's face changed, and there was a murderous gleam in his eye as
  he turned his head in the direction of the rigid Li, who was engrossed at the
  wheel. Lota smiled blandly at the Buccaneers, then turned away with a request
  that her breakfast might be brought to her in her cabin. With his glass
  firmly fixed in his eye and his hands in the pocket of his immaculate duck
  jacket, Endellion approached his guest.</p>

  <p>"A nice little surprise for you, I think," he said. "How gratified you
  must be, my friend, to think that you have not brought disaster upon those
  people for whom you entertain so high a regard. No explanations are
  necessary, a fact that I need hardly dilate upon. Now listen. I am going to
  put you on the first tramp steamer that comes along, together with your
  charming daughter. It is an exceedingly fortunate thing for you that she is
  here, because otherwise I should have had great pleasure in taking you by the
  scruff of the neck and throwing you into the sea. Now, then, come to
  breakfast."</p>
