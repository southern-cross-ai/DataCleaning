  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_I"></a>Chapter I<br>
  The  Fiddler</b></h2>
  <p>THE  railway is responsible for the transmutation of sleepy villages into noisy  manufacturing towns; of picturesque inns into gaudy hotels. Wheresoever that  iron road runs, hamlets, as vitalized by its touch, begin to throw out lines of  suburban villas, to gather into clumps of roaring factories; while the rustic  alehouse, of yore the parliament of rural politicians, swells into a bloated,  three-storey barrack, all glass, and glitter, and bare discomfort. The portly  host doffs his apron for the smart vulgarities of a publican, and trim Phyllis,  changing sex and attractiveness, shrinks to a lean, black-coated,  white-cravated scarecrow, avaricious of &ldquo;tips,&rdquo; and servile in demeanour. This  may be progress, but it is neither beauty nor comfort; and in stirring up  mediaeval sloth to modern activity, laudable though the task may be, the  utilitarian spirit of the age is apt to overlook the claims of eye and soul to  lovely sights and artistic suggestiveness.</p>
  <p>Yet,  as on the verge of the maddest whirlpool lie broad still pools wherein collect  flotsam and jetsam thrown off from the central gyration, so beyond the radius  of railroad and mushroom town lie somnolent parishes untouched by the restless  spirit of the nineteenth century. Here may be found the pleasant hamlets of old  time, huddled in a confusion of picturesque houses round the square-towered  church, grey and solemn. Here the market-place with cross and inn, yonder the  dwelling of the Lord of the Manor, showing red roofs and lean chimneys above  the park tree-tops. At the end of the crooked street a narrow bridge bestrides  a swift stream, and beyond, the dusty high-road, leaving behind its rusticity,  runs straightly towards the smoky towns which skirt the maelstrom of modern  existence. Such a village is Dalesford.</p>
  <p>Artists,  pioneers of the great tourist tribe as they are, knew it well, and often had  its quaint houses, its ivy-clad church, its gorse-besprinkled common figured on  the walls of the Academy. So sleepy, so peaceful, so idle it was, that here, if  anywhere, Thomson might have built his pleasant Castle of Indolence. Buried in  fertile pasture lands thirty miles from the nearest railway, Dalesford was  lamentably lethargic, and heard as in a dream the tumult of the century roaring  far away. Notwithstanding, its proximity to the high-road, it did not seem to  recognize that it was its bounden duty to increase its houses, to multiply its  population. Not a single dwelling had been erected there for the last  half-century, and its rural population was limited still to three hundred souls  (inclusive of the surrounding farms), as in the Middle Ages. No battles had  been fought in its vicinity, no great man had sprung from its inhabitants, no  industry of lace, or cloth, or straw-weaving was peculiar to the place. In a  word, Dalesford was, to all useful purposes, dead, and no artist in love with  its somnolent beauty ever wished it to be alive.</p>
  <p>Against  the high-road near the bridge stood the &ldquo;Lelanro Arms,&rdquo; a quaint little hostel  dating from the days of the Stewarts, and now presided over by Mistress Sally  Ballard. She, a comfortable old spinster, round and rosy as an apple, was  dubbed Mistress out of courtesy to her age and respectability. A famous  housewife was Mistress Sally, learned in pickling, and baking, and brewing; and  her inn was scrupulously clean and eminently comfortable. Here one slept in  low-ceilinged rooms, with diamond-paned casements, wherein were set pots of  mignonette and balsam; here the sheets smelt of lavender, and the breakfast-table  was set forth with freshly-caught trout, rich cream, and the sweetest of  home-made bread. Three maid-servants and an ostler formed the staff of this  unpretentious hostel, and these Mistress Sally governed with a rod of iron. But  she was a kindly creature, and her rule was beneficent.</p>
  <p>Hither  in the evening came labourer and farmer to taste the ale for which the &ldquo;Lelanro  Arms&rdquo; was famous. They sat in high-backed settles, with their tankards before  them, and discussed such scraps of news as came from the outside world until it  struck ten, when Mistress Sally, with many a laugh and jest, bundled them out,  so that they might not infringe the respectability of her house by keeping  midnight hours. The parish clerk, the verger, the steward from Lelanro Manor,  even the parson himself, knew that mellow taproom and the smack of the  home-brew. Painters in search of the picturesque stayed at the hostel of  Mistress Sally, and sketched its white-washed front, its high red roof, the  twisted stack of chimneys, and those rustic casements opening on to the village  green. Once a lean and hungry poet came, who abode a week in the best bedroom,  and then decamped without paying his bill, save in the following jingle:</p>
  <p class="verse">Oh,  Mistress Sally, ask me not<br>
    In kingly gold to pay my shot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have fallen on evil times:<br>
    But lest you should be harsh and wild<br>
    With one who is the Muses&rsquo; child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pay my debt in lordly rhymes.</p>
  <p>Over  which sufficiently bad verses Mistress Sally laughed till the tears bestreaked  her ruddy cheeks; and framing the &ldquo;lordly rhymes,&rdquo; she had them hung up in the  bar-parlour. Had the lean poet appeared again, he would no doubt have been  permitted to pay a second bill in the like coin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry for the poor creature and his bits of verse,&rdquo; said Mistress Sally, with a  large-hearted geniality.</p>
  <p>At  the sunset hour she stood under the porch, looking across the green, to where  the bridge spanned the stream. Already in twos and threes, with uncouth  salutations, the customers of the &ldquo;Lelanro Arms&rdquo; were passing within; and from  the windows of the taproom glimmered the flame of the early-lighted lamps.  Shrill-voiced children played round the old stone cross, but Mistress Sally,  heedless of their noisy pranks, stared at the gables of the distant Manor House  as they loomed menacingly against the clear evening sky. She had been a  still-room maid in the service of the Lelanros, and, as was natural, took a  deep interest in the family. What she was thinking of it is impossible to say,  but she pursed up her lips and wrinkled her brow in a manner which, to those  who knew her, betokened unpleasant thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  if you were burnt down,&rdquo; murmured the landlady, apostrophizing the distant  mansion; &ldquo;the fairy curse is on you and yours, though none know it but me. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  somewhat recondite speech, which hinted at family secrets, was interrupted by a  merry whistle. Across the bridge stepped a tall stripling with the tune of &ldquo;Garryowen&rdquo;  on his lips; and straightly he bore down on Mistress Sally, who had already  smoothed her brow to a hospitable smile. That amiable greeting took a yet more  approving twist as she saw before her as handsome a young man as ever had  crossed the threshold of her inn. Mistress Sally was no acidulated spinster to  scorn the male sex on the sour grape principle, and, in her own heart, she  secretly admired a strapping lad with a well-looking face. She had no fault to  find on this score with the new-comer.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page007.jpg" width="479" height="750"></p>
  <p>He  was over the middle height, with a well-knit figure, an aristocratic and rather  haughty countenance; but there lurked a twinkle in his dark eyes which did away  with the reserve impressed on lip and brow. Well worn as was his dress, a  shabby shooting-suit of brown corduroy, Mistress Sally saw that he was, as she  expressed it, &ldquo;every inch a gentleman.&rdquo; And notwithstanding the bundle on a  stick over his shoulder, and the fiddle under his arm, she acted on her first  impression and addressed him accordingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-even,  sir,&rdquo; said she, with a curtsey, &ldquo;it is bed and board you want, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  right there, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the wayfarer, taking his seat on a bench, and  placing bundle and fiddle beside him, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll have board before bed, as my  hunger is greater than my weariness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you like a broiled trout, sir, or a chicken nicely roasted? And there&rsquo;s a cold  round of beef in the larder fit for a lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  stranger flushed a trifle through the tan of his skin, and laughed in a  somewhat embarrassed fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said, with a half sigh, &ldquo;my purse will not permit of such  dainties. A pot of beer and some bread and cheese out here are all I require.  After that a bed for the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you a poet, sir?&rdquo; demanded the landlady, astonished at this moderation, and  mindful of the rhymes in the bar-parlour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  no, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered the other, with an amused smile. &ldquo;I have scribbled verses  in my time, but I do not claim to be a rhymer. As you see,&rdquo; he added, touching  the violin, &ldquo;I fiddle for my living.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mistress  Sally looked at his handsome face, considered his gently bred air, and smilingly  denied the truth of this remark. What is more, she supplied a reason for his  making it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand, sir,&rdquo; she said, with a broad smile. &ldquo;You are a young gentleman who  is doing this for a wager.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  charitable supposition, but incorrect. I am really and truly a simple fiddler,  tramping my way up to London. Look at my bundle, my clothes, my violin, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  at your face, sir,&rdquo; replied Mistress Sally, laughing. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t dress makes the  gentry. Oh, I&rsquo;ve lived with them in my time, sir. But as it pleases you to be  merry it is not my place to say anything, though I wish,&rdquo; added she, stepping  back into the doorway, &ldquo;that you would stay your stomach with something more  substantial than ale and bread.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man laughed as she disappeared, but the laugh gave place to a sad look  when he examined his lean purse. Therein were two half-crowns and a piece of  gold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifteen  shillings,&rdquo; the owner of this wealth said to himself, &ldquo;and I am still over a  hundred miles from London. Unless I earn more money with my fiddle I am afraid  it is many a meal I shall have to go without, and many a night I shall be  forced to sleep under the stars. Well, who cares? I am young and healthy, and  after all there is something pleasant in this Bohemianism.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke in a refined manner, and his speech and accent betrayed education. That  so apparently gently nurtured a young gentleman should be tramping the country  had puzzled more heads than Mistress Sally&rsquo;s. In spite of his denials the  rustics persisted in attributing his ragged attire and fiddling propensities to  eccentricity, and they firmly believed that he had plenty of gold on his  person, wherewith to ride in a coach and dress in gay raiment were he so  minded.</p>
  <p>At  every turn this greatness was thrust upon him till he grew weary of insisting  upon his poverty and humble birth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  old lady is as sceptical as the rest,&rdquo; said he, reclining full length on the  bench to rest his weary limbs. &ldquo;She thinks also that I am a lord in disguise.  Well, who knows? It may be so, though I am ignorant of birth and title and  wealth. Humph!&rdquo; he added, catching sight of the sign, &ldquo;that is a queer picture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One  of the numerous artists who visited the inn had painted the sign, discharging  his bill, as had the poet, by means of his art. The scene depicted was a stormy  sea, whereon tossed a cockle-shell boat. This held three figures, a lady with  outstretched arms standing up in the stern, a dead man lying in the bows, and  midway a rower toiling at the oars. In the distance a lurid sunset flamed  behind the gaunt towers of a castle. Beneath this mysterious picture was  written &ldquo;The Lelanro Arms&rdquo; and four lines of verse, which could not be  deciphered by the fiddler owing to the gathering darkness. It was an odd  picture to swing before a village inn, and required explanation.</p>
  <p>His  attention was drawn from the sign by the reappearance of the landlady with his  supper, to which she had added a small meat-pie. Seeing him colour at the sight  of this addition, Mistress Sally hastily disclaimed any wish to offend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  sure,&rdquo; said she in a kindly tone, &ldquo;a lad like you needs good food after a long  walk. You must eat well for health&rsquo;s sake, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good, ma&rsquo;am. But if I can&rsquo;t pay for my appetite?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  then you can give us a tune on your fiddle. I dearly love a country dance,  Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Warwick,  ma&rsquo;am. Algernon Warwick,&rdquo; said the stranger, smiling at her simple craft, &ldquo;and  I&rsquo;ll give you a tune with pleasure when I finish my supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  he did, greatly to the delight of the taproom topers and the children on the  green. No great hand at holding her tongue, Mistress Sally had already hinted  her impression that the fiddler was a gentleman on the tramp out of sheer love  for adventure; and every one was agog with excitement to hear what tunes this  lord in disguise&mdash;for some foolishly imagined as much&mdash;could draw from the  strings. Warwick proved to be a veritable magician of the bow, a strolling  Orpheus, and moved their heartstrings by the magic of his melodies. How that  fiddle talked, and cried, and laughed, and trilled, only those who were present  could tell. Mistress Sally nodded benignly in the porch, and tapped her foot to  the air of &ldquo;Chloe, come kiss me,&rdquo; or sighed when she heard the sad melody, &ldquo;Jenny  flouted Jessamy.&rdquo; Then again he played brisk country dances, to which the  delighted children footed it merrily; anon he changed to a minor key, so  mournful, that the wine-bibbers within shook their grizzled heads over their  cups; and finished with a wild Hungarian dance which stung slow, bucolic brains  to unaccustomed excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  brave fiddler,&rdquo; said Mistress Sally, when he laid by bow and instrument, &ldquo;and,  mind ye, a gentleman born, or I&rsquo;m no true woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_II"></a>Chapter II<br>
  A  Family Legend</b></h2>
  <p>THE  Dalesford folk had a reputation for credulity, and certainly deserved it in  this instance. Pleased with the fiddling, and looks, and pleasant manner of  Warwick, they were disposed to believe implicitly in any tale he chose to tell  them. He, knowing the value of silence, held his peace, and let Mistress Sally  say what she would; and, as the foolish woman was firmly convinced in her own  mind of his gentility, she soon promulgated this belief amongst the rustics. By  dawn a fine crop of stories had sprung up round the personality of the tramp,  and the gossips told one another that he assuredly must be an eccentric young  nobleman in disguise. For the nonce the Golden Age was come again, and the  Olympians walked familiarly amongst mortals.</p>
  <p>Mistress  Sally, whose naturally shrewd wits had been sharpened by contact with town-bred  servants, did not go so far as to dub her guest a lord; nevertheless she saw in  him a man of birth. That he fiddled round the countryside was no bar to this  belief, as she well knew that gentlefolk were eccentric, and, not unnaturally,  wearying of their grandeur, condescended at times to mix with the common herd.  Hence, hopeful that Warwick would confess his freak before he left the &ldquo;Lelanro  Arms,&rdquo; she gave him a bedroom far beyond his purse, and the next morning set  before him as excellent a meal as could be cooked. Warwick, who had descended  in the expectation of a repetition of the bread and ale supper, expostulated  vainly against this hospitality being thrust upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t pay for these dainties, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said he, when the landlady pressed him to  take a seat at the well-spread table. &ldquo;I have only fifteen shillings and a  fiddle in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt, sir,&rdquo; replied Mistress Sally, nodding meaningly, &ldquo;but if you wanted a  score of pounds at a pinch, I dare say your friends in London&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no friends in London&mdash;I have no friends in the world. Why will you persist  in ascribing to me a greatness which I do not possess? If I eat your goodies  and don&rsquo;t pay for them, you&rsquo;ll have me put in the stocks for a vagabond.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  forbid, Mr. Warwick!&rdquo; said the startled Sally. &ldquo;Sit down and eat, sir. If you  can&rsquo;t pay, it won&rsquo;t ruin me; and, after all, you&rsquo;re too young a lad to go  tramping on an empty stomach. Eat well, sir, and pay your bill with a tune on  your fiddle. I&rsquo;ve had worse payments in my time,&rdquo; finished she, thinking of the  poet&rsquo;s rhymes, which were certainly less congenial to her than the  heart-stirring strains of the violin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Warwick, taking his seat, &ldquo;I accept your offer. But never did I  expect to meet with such kindness in the world. I might starve in London before  any one would give me a crust of bread.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  heart,&rdquo; cried Mistress Sally, patting her breast, &ldquo;what wicked people! Why not  stay here a week, sir, and fiddle to the lads and lasses? They&rsquo;d give you a  trifle for your work, I&rsquo;ll be bound; and the bill at the &ldquo;Lelanro Arms&rdquo; won&rsquo;t  drain your purse, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very kind of you, dame, but I must push on at once. There is somebody waiting  for me in London who may do me a good turn; although,&rdquo; added he sadly, &ldquo;I am by  no means sure of his goodwill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  father, no doubt, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no father, no mother! I am an orphan,&rdquo; responded the young man, with a  sigh; &ldquo;but there, there!&rdquo; he added hastily, &ldquo;let us talk of other things. My  story is too common to be worth the telling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  baulked of her curiosity, Mistress Sally swallowed her disappointment as best  she could, and proceeded to retail the local news. Of this she was well  informed, as the inn was a rural Ear of Dionysius, into which was breathed all  the scandal of the neighbourhood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  Lelanro and Mistress Celia are up in London,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He is the owner of the  land hereabouts, and she is his grand-daughter&mdash;a fair and kindly young lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heiress  to the estates, no doubt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  replied the landlady, pursing up her lips; &ldquo;the estates go with the title to a  distant cousin of the family. With Lord Lelanro the direct line ceases, unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  what, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked Warwick, noting the abrupt pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind, sir. Every family has its skeleton, and it is not for me to show that of  the Lelanros. It is a fine house, is it not?&rdquo; she added, evidently desirous of  turning the conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  I saw of it,&rdquo; answered Algernon, falling in with her humour; &ldquo;a steep wall  rising from the banks of the stream; turrets and gables beyond, encircled by a  park. Why is the house defended in that fashion, Mistress Sally? Is the owner  misanthropic, or is he merely doubtful of the world&rsquo;s honesty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not partial to strangers,&rdquo; muttered the other reluctantly; &ldquo;at least, not at  the Manor. In London my lord keeps open house,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From  the way in which she spoke Warwick saw that the subject was distasteful, and  wondered what could be the reason of her obvious embarrassment. Evidently there  was some secret connected with house or inmates; and being a loyal servant of  the family, she was bent on saying as little as possible. Nevertheless, as  Warwick had kept his own counsel, he could not very well question her further  on her private affairs, therefore went on with his breakfast in silence.</p>
  <p>In  a few minutes Mistress Sally left the room, and returned speedily with a  portrait in a silver frame, which she placed proudly before her guest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is a picture of Miss Celia, sir,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;given to me by herself. Isn&rsquo;t  she a beauty, Mr. Warwick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very charming young lady,&rdquo; answered Warwick, examining the photograph, &ldquo;but her  expression is rather sad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo;  coughed Mistress Sally awkwardly, &ldquo;she has reason to look sad. All the Lelanros  are sad&mdash;after twenty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  after twenty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not the one to tell tales,&rdquo; said Mistress Sally, hastily snatching up the  picture. &ldquo;If my dear pretty Miss Celia is sad, that has nothing to do with you  or me sir. Let sleeping dogs lie. That is what I always say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  which significant remark she left the room for a second time, nor did she  re-enter it again, and Warwick guessed thereby that she was afraid of saying  too much. Indeed, her hints had already roused his curiosity, and he burned to  know the meaning of this ambiguous talk. The sadness which came to the Lelanros  when they reached the age of twenty years; the steep wall overhanging the swift  stream; the remark anent the failure of the direct line with the unspoken  reservation; all these things stimulated the desire of the young man to know  more of the Manor House, and of the family who dwelt therein. However, his own  immediate affairs soon withdrew his attention from such unnecessary matters.</p>
  <p>He  weighed his lean purse, counted and re-counted the three coins, and sighed to  think that he must part with one of them for the discharge of his night&rsquo;s &lsquo;entertainment.  Still, with twelve and sixpence he would do very well for the next few days,  and he trusted when this was spent to replenish his exchequer by music and  song. Having come to this conclusion he pulled out a clay pipe, and loading it  with a morsel of tobacco from his scanty store, he proceeded to indulge in the  luxury of a smoke. Then he picked up his bundle, tucked the fiddle under his  arm, and repaired in search of Mistress Sally, to say good-bye.</p>
  <p>She  was blocking the porch with her portly form, and turned to greet him with a  smile. In the bright sunlight, with her be-ribboned cap, rosy face, and buxom  figure, she resembled one of those delightful landladies who enliven the  optimistic pages of Fielding and Dickens. And why should she not resemble them?  she who was their lineal descendant and worthy representative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must go now, Mistress Sally,&rdquo; said Warwick, tendering his poor coin, &ldquo;and here  is all I can pay for board and lodging. A miserable return for so capital a bed  and supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put  it up, sir,&rdquo; said the good-hearted landlady, waving it away. &ldquo;Heaven forbid  that Sarah Ballard should take from those who need.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  in spite of his half-laughing, half-earnest expostulations, she absolutely  refused to take the money. Nay more, she handed him a small parcel of  provisions, for his midday meal, with a rubicund smile of goodwill and kindly  hospitality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  be hungry at noon,&rdquo; said she, forcing this into his hand. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a  meat-pie and bread and cheese and ale in there. And maybe, sir, you&rsquo;ll find a  trifle of tobacco,&rdquo; she added, with a shy smile. &ldquo;I see you spoil those white  teeth of yours by smoking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  had never before experienced such kindness, and was so deeply moved that he  hardly knew how to thank the hostess. However, he managed to stammer out a few  words, and shook her heartily by the hand, a salutation hardly relished by the  buxom landlady, who would have turned her rosy cheek willingly to the lips of  so handsome a traveller.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  ever I become that which you take me to be,&rdquo; said he earnestly, &ldquo;you may be  sure I shall return to thank you in other ways than mere words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  when you will, and you&rsquo;ll ever be welcome,&rdquo; responded Mistress Sally, and  patted him on the back as he stepped out into the sunshine.</p>
  <p>The  fiddler would have moved away at once, for it was already late in the morning,  when, looking up to note the weather tokens of the cloud-dappled sky, he again  caught sight of the queerly-pictured sign creaking overhead. Curious to know  the meaning of the representation, he asked Mistress Sally to afford him an  explanation. Which she did, nothing loth to retain him longer by her side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  picture, sir,&rdquo; replied Mistress Sally, with unconcealed pride, &ldquo;was painted by  a gentleman who is now great. I have been offered no end of money for it, Mr.  Warwick, as his name is signed to it, and that makes it valuable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the meaning of the picture?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read  the words, sir, and see what you make of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  mounted on the bench, and had no difficulty in deciphering the following  quatrain:</p>
  <p class="verse">To  those false lords my crown I gave,<br>
    Now they would have my head I ween;<br>
    Be Leal Andrew for aye, my knave,<br>
Be leal and row to save your queen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  words describe the picture,&rdquo; said Mistress Sally, when he stepped down, &ldquo;it is  the beginning of the Lelanro family. On the other side of the sign, Mr.  Warwick, you will see their arms; a boat on a sea with the motto &lsquo;Be Leal and  Row.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the story, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked Algernon, sitting down on the bench.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  the Queen of Scots fled from her enemies,&rdquo; said Mistress Sally, with the air of  one repeating a lesson, &ldquo;she came to the banks of a river hard pressed by her  false lords. One serving-man had she with her, and urged a ferryman called  Andrew, who dwelt on the banks, to put her and her serving-man across to where  her friends were gathered. The ferryman, hearing she was the Queen, told her on  his knees that he was known as Leal Andrew for his devotion to the House of  Stewart, and gladly took her in his boat. Half-way across the stream, the false  lords came to the bank and shouted to Leal Andrew that he should give up the  fugitive Queen. Her friends on the further side implored him to be no traitor  to his lawful sovereign. Leal Andrew rowed hard to save the Queen; but the  serving-man, a traitorous knave, tried to upset the ferry-boat so that the  Queen might fall into the power of her enemies. But Leal Andrew killed him and  again took to the oars, whereat Mary of Scotland cried, punning on his name, &lsquo;Be  Leal Andrew still&mdash;be leal and row to save your Queen.&rsquo; She was landed safely  and was saved, so the Lelanros took her words for their motto and their name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did they rise from ferrymen to lords?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  son of the Queen, James of England, rewarded Leal Andrew for his devotion, and gave  to him and his descendants the estates of Dalesford, which they have held ever  since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t quite understand the punning motto,&rdquo; said Warwick, in a perplexed tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Queen said &lsquo;Leal and row,&rsquo; which was a pun on his name, &lsquo;Leal Andrew,&rsquo; made by  altering &lsquo;e&rsquo; into &lsquo;o&rsquo; in the last syllable. The family now spell the name  Lelanro as you see it there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very interesting legend,&rdquo; observed Warwick, once more rising to his feet. &ldquo;I  suppose you tell it to every one, Mistress Sally? The Lelanros are a fortunate  family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  sighed the landlady, &ldquo;they have had bad luck to balance the good. If Leal  Andrew brought a blessing, his son brought a curse, which still endures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the curse, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too long a story,&rdquo; said Mistress Sally hastily; &ldquo;you had better go, sir, for  the sun is high, and see, the children are out from school. They&rsquo;ll be asking  you for a tune, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this hint Warwick again thanked the good-hearted landlady, and took his leave.  Half-way across the green he struck up a lively measure, whereat the  school-children followed dancing in his wake as he marched along. It was a  repetition of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_III"></a>Chapter III<br>
    Adventures Are To The Adventurous</b></h2>
  <p>ON  leaving that hospitable inn, it was Warwick&rsquo;s intention to push on towards  London; but so stimulated was his curiosity by the landlady&rsquo;s chatter about the  Lelanro family, that he determined to look again on that tantalizing wall,  which apparently concealed some strange secret. With this intent he retraced  his way across the bridge, still drawing onward by his fiddling the dancing  children, and strolled over the meadows in the direction of the Manor. Here,  anxious to rid himself of his innocent company, he sat down under a tree, and  played to their restless feet until they were fairly wearied out. Then he  nodded a kind farewell, and leaving them to pick buttercups till the  school-bell rang, he betook himself along the banks of the stream.</p>
  <p>This  rustic river, of no great width, parted two landscapes markedly dissimilar in  character. On the further side a forest of oak, and sycamore, and ash, and  birch covered a round swelling hill; and at its foot, numerous large rocks  thrust themselves from amid the green foliage into the turbid waters. Overshore  the stream fretted and whitened round the Titanic stones, but swept smoothly  onward, deep and silent, under the shadow of the bank whereon Warwick stood.  Thence spread fat meadow lands dotted with ancient trees, and divided by  flowering hedgerows, the rigid intersecting lines of which assimilated the  plain to a chess-board. Through this fertility the highroad meandered white and  dusty to where the vision was stayed by low-lying hills undulating against the  blue June sky. As a finishing touch to the contrast, the peaked roofs of the  Manor House showed themselves in the dip of the land, between forest slope and  low-lying meadow, linking, as it were, the mountain with the vale, past  savagery with present domesticity, being at once a feudal castle and a modern  mansion.</p>
  <p>After  a careless glance at this scene, which would have longer enchained the eye of  an artist, Warwick passed into the path which wound tortuously along the  flowery banks. Here the green arcade overhead was vocal with the song of bird  and hum of insect, while the murmur of the fretting water added a deeper note.  Through the boles of the trees which fringed the meadows in a single line he  now and then caught a glimpse of slowly-moving cattle, of scampering foals and  playful lambs. From such a pastoral landscape his attention was distracted by  the trout leaping after May-flies, and in the green twilight of the woods  beyond he saw the brown flash of a squirrel springing from one tree-trunk to  another. Across the stream flitted glittering dragon-flies and droning  bumble-bees, while aloft swallows whirled hither and thither; and from the  arching blue rained down the music of an invisible lark. The peaceful beauty of  the whole stole imperceptibly into the heart of the wayfarer, and for the  moment he questioned whether it would not be wiser to accept the offer of  Mistress Sally and make music for the villagers, than to tempt the blows of  Fate in far-off toiling, moiling London.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  I could be happy,&rdquo; thought he, leisurely strolling onward. &ldquo;No care, no  trouble, no dread, only rest and comfort, and infinite peace. Merely with a  violin and an ambition to be a musician, it is madness to go to London, where I  would be but a drop in the ocean. That man of whom my father spoke may not be  disposed to help me, and then what should I do?&mdash;I, with no friends, no money,  with not even a name; a waif, a tramp, a bastard for aught I know. Yet it would  be ignoble to rest in my present ignorance of birth and position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this stage of his musings the path rounded a curve of the river, and began to slope  gently upward. The gables of the Manor House were now close at hand, and  Warwick, mounting the declivity, found himself able to command a fine view of  the whole building. Surrounded on three sides by the woods, its mass lay  directly on the verge of the stream, which here flowed ominously swift under a  Cyclopean wall. From the waters, sullen in their gloom, these grey stones,  looking massive enough to resist cannon, rose abruptly for close on twenty  feet. Not a loophole, not a window, not even a chink was to be seen in its stern  front, and the whole length was draped with dark-green ivy, which accentuated  its forbidding appearance. Above this shot the red-tiled roofs, peaked and  steep, round turrets, pierced with narrow windows, and lines of machicolated  battlements grey with age; the whole jumbled together in picturesque confusion.  With the stream moat-like at its foot, and the wild woods on either side, this  curious building resembled a feudal castle, such as Dor&eacute; drew for the tales of  Rabelais. Here a robber chief might have dwelt; here a magician might have kept  in durance some enchanted princess; yet the building was set in the heart of  England, and promised no more extraordinary adventure than the commonplace  kind, incident to our prosaic and law-protected existence. Civilization kills  the romance of road, and river, and lonely country house.</p>
  <p>Much  struck with the sight of this wood-encircled castle dominating the swift  stream, Warwick looked at it long and earnestly, and finally he sat under a  shady oak to make his midday meal. After this he purposed to return to the  bridge, and so pursue his way to London along the high-road. Despite the  romance of the place, which engendered dreams and set strange melodies floating  through his brain, Warwick was too young and healthy to neglect the food  provided by Mistress Sally. He finished the meat-pie and the bottle of ale,  reserving the bread and cheese for his supper; then throwing himself full  length on the soft grass, he smoked luxuriously, and eyed wall and turret and  gable through the blue clouds which rolled from his pipe. Seen through so misty  a veil, the mansion became enchanted; and in the glamour of his dreaming brain  it was less a common country house than a castle of faery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  might be heir to a mansion like that,&rdquo; thought the romantic Warwick. &ldquo;Every one  seems to take me for a gentleman; so why should I not be one? I was born in the  humble booth of a fair, it is true; but my father could never discover his  place of birth. And how can he expect me to learn it from this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  reference was to a slip of paper which he took out of his pocket-book. Thereon  was written a name and a date&mdash;the name, &ldquo;Algernon&rdquo;; the date, &ldquo;December 24, 1857.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father said the secret could be solved by this,&rdquo; murmured the youth; &ldquo;but  though I have pored over it for hours, never have I been able to gain a hint of  its meaning. It may be a cryptogram, a rebus, a cipher, a Chinese puzzle, for  all I know. But a name and a date are poor material for a man to trace his  progenitors.&rdquo; He replaced the precious paper, which contained his future, in  the pocket-book, and leaning his elbow on the grass, he continued to  soliloquize aloud:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father&rsquo;s friend in London may reveal the truth; but it is hardly likely. If he  would not tell my father, he certainly will not tell me. Perhaps he cannot; but  at all events I&rsquo;ll see this Ballard as soon as I set foot in London. Ballard,&rdquo;  he added, starting up; &ldquo;why, that is the name of the kind landlady. I wonder if  she is any connection of my town friend? What a fool I was not to inquire!  However, it&rsquo;s not too late. I&rsquo;ll return for the night to the &lsquo;Lelanro Arms,&rsquo;  and question her closely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  suggestion of the &ldquo;Lelanro Arms&rdquo; turned his thoughts towards the family of that  name, and to the hints given by Mistress Sally concerning a mystery connected  with their mansion. A thousand fancies haunted the imaginative brain of Warwick  as he stared at the menacing wall, and he wondered greatly what mystery could  be concealed behind it. Stories occurred to him of great families cursed with  secrets engendered by the evil doings of former generations, secrets so  terrible that they drove all cheerfulness from the heart, and banished all  smiles from the face. No one knew what these secrets might be, yet they  tortured the heart of many a proud noble and long-descended squire. From what  he had heard and seen, it would appear that the Lelanros concealed some such  indefinable horror in house and heart, which blighted the existence of all who  bore their name. Mistress Sally hinted as much, and the mighty wall, so out of  keeping with the law-protected security of an English home, confirmed the hint.</p>
  <p>Dominated  by the thought, Warwick no longer beheld in the mansion a castle of faery, but  a blood-stained house, groaning under a curse. From the past came forth a power  to render it infamous and desolate. No smile was on the lips of its lord; no  stranger was admitted within its gates, and it loomed across the stream deadly  and sullen; accursed, to the inflamed fancy of this lad, as ever was the  dwelling of Atreus. Blue was the sky above it, green were the woods around it,  and limpid the stream that sparkled under the lichened wall; yet to Warwick it  scowled an abode of evil, a haunted mansion of crime and desolation. In the  bright sunshine he shivered at the thought of what tales those hoary walls  could tell, were they gifted with speech.</p>
  <p>To  dispel so gloomy a mood, he hastily seized his violin and improvised a merry  air, which was more in keeping with the glory of that summer day. The notes  chased one another in airy flight, and thrilled and trilled like a choir of  birds. Into the musician&rsquo;s soul Nature poured the suggestion of her fecund  beauty, and under flying bow and lithe fingers the strains echoed through the  warm air like the melodies of light tripping fairies. It was no passionate love-song,  no melody begotten by the thought of human pain and grief, but an elfish carol,  heartless and beautiful as Nature herself. She was the inspirer, and passing  from the soul of her interpreter to the instrument, she rendered herself  audible in silver cascades of hurrying notes. The voice of the stream, the  trill of the lark, sigh of wind, and rustle of leaves were all blent in the  magic strain, which rose and fell fitfully with joyous gladness.</p>
  <p>In  the interval of a brilliant passage, Warwick paused with a look of wonderment  on his mobile face, for in the distance sounded a sweet voice mocking the  cadences of his instrument. Pure and silvery as the note of a bird, it rippled  from over stream, and he became aware that some one was singing in emulation  behind the ivy-clad wall. To test the truth of the echo he hastily improvised a  sparkling run, and paused. The unseen singer took it up, and executed the whole  passage with faultless precision, in clear-sounding notes. He again swept the  bow across the strings; and again the human echo mocked his fantasy. Then  ensued a delicate duet, in which the notes of the violin trilled across the  stream, to be met midway by similar strains. Note for note the hidden voice  replied to the violin&rsquo;s melody. Then Warwick paused, and the voice sang alone;  he re-executed the melody, and so instrument and singer fluted together like  mocking-birds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is an adventure of faery,&rdquo; cried Warwick, when he could no longer provoke a  reply. &ldquo;I would give anything to see this caged bird.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  pictured to himself a delicate maiden prisoned behind those grim stones, and  laying down his violin, he descended the green slope to the banks of the river,  as though then and there intending to swim across and storm the prison. This  fantastic adventure appealed greatly to his fancy, and, parted from all  knowledge of the singer by wall and stream, he sat meditating on the flowery  marge. Nevertheless, despite his ardent curiosity, he had no intention of  swimming stream or of scaling wall, as it was not his business, or right, to  thrust himself into the affairs of the Lelanro family. All he decided to do was  to return to the inn, and, if possible, to learn from Mistress Sally what bird  was caged in that woodland castle. Such was his intent, but Fate took the  matter into her own hands, and thrust him forward on a path whence there was no  retreat.</p>
  <p>Wrapped  in his dreams of the hidden singer, he did not note how insecure was the bank  on which he reclined. The water had eaten away the under-part, and though  Warwick was ignorant of his danger, he was seated on a mere shell of matted  grass and earth, beneath which swirled the current. Unexpectedly his seat  collapsed, and before he could collect his scattered thoughts he found himself  swept into mid-stream, swimming for dear life. Notwithstanding the heat of the  day, the water was bitterly cold, and the youth, chilled and numbed by the sudden  immersion, was almost helpless in the grip of the current.</p>
  <p>Fortunately  Warwick was a good swimmer, but encumbered by his clothes, and cramped by the  cold wave, he could not regain the shelving bank whence he had fallen. The main  strength of the current rushed directly past the wall, and thither, in spite of  all his efforts, the youth was borne. Dreading lest his strength should give  way, he seized the roots of the ivy which, huge and gnarled, dipped in the  stream, and with a powerful effort drew himself upward from the water which  threatened to suck him down. Half bewildered by the shock, and the position in  which he found himself, he saw that he was fully committed to the adventure;  and, as there was no other means by which he could hope to save his life, he  clambered with difficulty up the natural ladder formed by the roots and sprays  of the ivy, Emerging at the top of the wall from shadow to sunshine, the change  was too sudden; and smitten by the fierce beams, he was seized with vertigo.</p>
  <p>But  a moment he balanced himself on the wall, and saw, as in a dream, the stream on  one side, a garden on the other, when, losing senses and hold, he reeled  dizzily and fell downward into what seemed to be a gulf of roaring gloom.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_IV"></a>Chapter IV<br>
  In  Lilliput</b></h2>
  <p>WHEN  Warwick came to himself, he was conscious of a dull pain on the top of his  head, and of a wet cloth lying across his forehead. Still confused, he did not  at once open his eyes, but lay silent and inert, endeavouring to pick up the  threads of life where recollection failed him. His soul, lately on an excursion  into the unknown, whence it had brought back no report, reunited itself to the  body with a sudden shock which thrilled his frame with pain and dread. Then  memory awoke, and he recalled his fall into the stream, his scaling of the  wall, and finally the utter blank which had whelmed him on the other side of  the parapet. Between that and this he could recall nothing. At some indefinite  period he had bestridden an ivied wall in the hot sunshine; but he could not  even guess at his present situation. So bewildered was his brain, that for the  moment he neither opened his eyes nor attempted to comprehend his position.</p>
  <p>While  thus lying, dead and buried, as it seemed to him, for he had no feeling of  contact with the actual world, a sweet voice began piping a song in low tones.  It was the same singing he had evoked with his violin; but now shrilled  delicately, as though the vocalist were afraid of rousing him from slumber. As  in a dream he heard the voice shape itself into song;</p>
  <p class="verse">Sir  James, tae guard his soul fra ill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hae plucked the rowan berry,<br>
  And walked him, in the moonlicht chill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where faery folk dance merry.</p>
  <p class="verse">Oh,  lay ye doon the rowan twig,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; taste oor wine o&rsquo; broom,<br>
Or mickle dole, on hairt an&rsquo; soul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll gie ye for a doom.</p>
  <p>Here  the ballad abruptly ended, as a deep voice jarred on the silvery sweetness of  the strain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray  be silent, Madam Tot,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;you will wake our patient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so, doctor,&rdquo; replied the singer lightly, &ldquo;his soul is not there, but in the  kingdom of faery with my kinsfolk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must try and bring it back to his body then,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;The lad has  been severely shaken by his fall; but as no bones are broken I trust he will  soon be all right. You stay beside him, Madam Tot, while I go for some wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send  Blunderbore to me,&rdquo; cried the lady, as the other departed. &ldquo;I wish him to see  after my summer-house, broken by the fall of this giant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  idea that he was a giant so tickled Warwick, that, notwithstanding his aching  head, he could not forbear a quiet laugh, and opened his eyes to see into what  odd quarter of the world he had wandered. The sight of the room in which he lay  made him doubtful of his sanity, and he began to think that he had been thrust  into a doll&rsquo;s house; everything was on so small a scale that he indeed felt as  though he were a giant in the land of Lilliput.</p>
  <p>He  was lying on the floor with his head resting on a tiny sofa, and on looking  upward he saw that the ceiling was so low that he could almost touch it by  simply stretching up his arm. Tables and chairs on the same miniature scale  were scattered about the apartment, and the doors and windows were commensurate  to the size of the chamber. The hangings were of green, as also was the carpet,  and everything betrayed daintiness and refinement, as though the room were  inhabited by a luxurious doll. It was little wonder that these dwarfish  surroundings confused the young man who so unexpectedly found himself amongst  them. To lose consciousness in the actual world, and recover sensibility in the  land of pigmies, is a rare, almost an inconceivable experience for the average  human being.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page029.jpg" width="800"></p>
  <p>The  doll herself, who was seated on a little chair, started up when she heard his  laugh, and hastened lightly towards him. This lady was a dwarf, not more than  three feet in height, but so beautifully proportioned that for the moment she  did not strike Warwick as anything out of the ordinary. But for her white hair  and wrinkled face he would have taken her for a child. She was dressed in a  green robe, with a silver belt, and wore a hat of the same hue, adorned with  white feathers. Leaning on an ebony cane, she nodded and smiled at Warwick;  while he could hardly forbear an exclamation of wonder at this perfect  reproduction of a human being on a smaller scale. Head, body, hands, feet, all  matched one another, and beyond the fact that she was three feet high instead  of five or six, there was nothing incongruous or repellent in her looks.  Evidently the chamber had been proportioned and furnished in accordance with  her stature; and so strong was the impression created by this congruity, that  Warwick looked upon himself, rather than on her, as an abnormal creature, and  felt that he had no right to intrude his clumsy bulk into the miniature world  presided over by this diminutive beauty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I in Lilliput?&rdquo; asked he faintly, with an amazed glance at the green-clad  faery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are in my chamber,&rdquo; replied the dwarf in a sweet, low voice, quite in keeping  with her tiny personality. &ldquo;You fell off the wall on to my summer-house; but  that its thatched roof broke your fall, you would have been killed; for you  tumbled,&rdquo; added the little lady solemnly, &ldquo;from an enormous height.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  laughed, as he quite conceived how infinitely high the wall would appear in the  eyes of this little creature; seeing that he, a full-grown man, found it  sufficiently lofty. He looked down at his limbs, which seemed unnaturally large  in this chamber, where everything was reduced to suit the physical requirements  of its dwarfish inmate, and wondered how he got in at the narrow and low door.  Madam Tot, as the doctor had called her, guessed his thoughts, and smiled  again, She had a very pretty smile, and revealed a row of pretty teeth as she  anticipated his speech by a ready explanation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blunderbore  found you, sir, and it was Blunderbore who put you into my room, at my request.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Blunderbore?&rdquo; demanded Warwick, with a vague recollection of some nurse&rsquo;s  story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is my guardian here,&rdquo; replied the lady in a dignified tone, &ldquo;and I call him  Blunderbore because he is so tall and strong. But his real name is Simon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he coming in here? I heard you tell the doctor to send him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madam  Tot threw up her tiny hands, and shrieked in a horrified manner&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear young man, Simon couldn&rsquo;t get inside that door. He&rsquo;s much over six feet in  height. It was as much as we could do to get you in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t you leave me in the garden then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I wanted you in here,&rdquo; replied the dwarf in a peremptory tone; &ldquo;you have  surprised a secret, sir, and you shall not leave this place until the will of  my brother is known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Madam Tot,&rdquo; expostulated Warwick, remembering that she had been so addressed, &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam  Tot, you rude person,&rdquo; shrieked the lady, stamping a tiny foot, &ldquo;how dare you  call me by that odious name! I am Miss Selina Lelanro.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  your brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  James, Lord Lelanro! You must call me Miss Lelanro! And now, sir, what were you  doing on my wall? No evasions, no lies, no fictions,&rdquo; cried she sternly, &ldquo;or I  will order Blunderbore to throw you into the river again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  warned, Warwick was about to attempt an explanation, when the door opened, and  a large head framed in red hair and red whiskers filled up the opening. The  owner was evidently kneeling in the passage outside, and, unable by reason of  his bulk to enter, adopted this mode of learning the commands of his dwarfish  mistress. This apparition of a head belonged, as Warwick rightly guessed, to  the redoubtable Simon, alias Blunderbore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Blunderbore,&rdquo; said Miss Lelanro, tripping forward, &ldquo;go and see after the roof  of my summer-house at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Madam Tot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Lelanro, you oaf!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Miss Lelanro,&rdquo; replied the head submissively; &ldquo;and what about the gentleman? Am  I to throw him into the river again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  been listening, I see, Blunderbore,&rdquo; said the dwarf disdainfully. &ldquo;No, you are  not to touch him. I shall attend to him with Dr. Pryce. But get the Blue Room  ready, as he will stay here till Lord Lelanro returns.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time Warwick guessed that he had surprised the secret of the Lelanros.  Some hereditary taint in the blood produced at intervals a dwarf in the family,  similar to the little being who now stood beside him. On account of their  deformity, these poor creatures, suffering through no fault of their own, were  shut up within the high wall; and the outside world was ignorant of their  existence. Warwick recalled the hints of Mistress Sally, and he no longer  wondered that a cloud rested on the faces of the Lelanro family. To have such  abnormal creatures prisoned in their country house was quite sufficient to  weigh on their spirits, and Warwick thought how many dwarfs, born to solitude  and disgrace, had inhabited this tiny chamber.</p>
  <p>He  expected that, alarmed at the secret being known to a stranger, the servants  who attended on the dwarf would not let him depart without the sanction of Lord  Lelanro; and foresaw that until the owner of the house returned from London, he  would be obliged to regard himself as a prisoner. The gigantic Simon, evidently  chosen to prevent such invasions of the dwarf&rsquo;s chamber, was quite powerful  enough to keep him there by force, and moreover there was the doctor to be  reckoned with. Warwick wondered what manner of a man he would prove to be, and  mentally considered how his story would be received.</p>
  <p>At  this moment the head of Blunderbore vanished in a magical manner, and Miss  Lelanro tripped back to the side of her unexpected guest with a resolute look  on her elfish face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  sir,&rdquo; said she, with an imperious tap of her ebony cane, &ldquo;what is your name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Algernon  Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you, Mr. Warwick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A wandering  fiddler!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  cried the lady, &ldquo;it was you, then, who played this morning!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Miss Lelanro; and it was you who sang?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was I. Your music pleased me very much, but I hardly expected the honour of a  visit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  assure you it was quite unintentional on my part,&rdquo; urged Warwick, anxious not  to offend this dainty lady. &ldquo;I fell into the river by accident, and was carried  away by the current. It swept me under your wall, and to save myself from being  sucked under, I gripped the roots of the ivy which overhangs the stream. Had I  not done so I should have been drowned. As it was I could not hang there  indefinitely, so I clambered up the wall, with no intention of invading your  privacy, but only intent on saving myself. The sun beating on my bare head turned  me giddy, and I fell into your garden; but I assure you, Miss Lelanro, I might  just as easily have tumbled out as in, and so into the stream again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  dwarf listened gravely to this explanation, with her head cocked on one side  like that of a pert sparrow. When he paused she nodded approvingly, and  supplied him with the sequel to his adventure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was in my garden, Mr. Warwick, and I saw you fall. It was fortunate I had left  my summer-house, else I might have been crushed under its ruins. My cry of  alarm brought Blunderbore to my assistance, and seeing that you were stunned he  carried you in here by my order. Then I sent for Dr. Pryce, who is now  attending to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I to consider myself your prisoner, Miss Lelanro?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are to consider yourself my guest,&rdquo;&rsquo; replied the little creature, with great  dignity. &ldquo;I have given orders that a chamber is to be prepared for you. Not one  like this,&rdquo; added she, looking round the doll&rsquo;s house with ludicrous  complacency, &ldquo;but a grown-up apartment furnished to suit your size. Dr. Pryce  will be here shortly to conduct you there, and in the meantime, Mr. Warwick, I  shall take my leave, to see Blunderbore repairing my summer-house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  apologize for my misfortune in having crushed it,&rdquo; said Warwick gravely, though  secretly amused by the dwarf&rsquo;s self-importance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all! not at all!&rdquo; replied Madam Tot, pausing at the door of her chamber to  wave a gracious pardon, &ldquo;it was not your fault. I exonerate you from all blame,  and I shall make your stay at the Manor as pleasant as I possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  she disappeared, Warwick fell to thinking of the strange situation in which he  had been placed by Fate. Certainly, in leaving the inn but a few hours  previously, he had not expected to find himself in such straits. Here he was,  in the secret portion of the Lelanros&rsquo; house, in possession of a knowledge  which they jealously concealed from the world; and he wondered how the head of  the family would deal with one who innocently had unmasked the curse which was  their hereditary burden. From these considerations, which were somewhat  unsatisfactory, Warwick&rsquo;s thoughts reverted to his violin lying under the oak  tree beyond the stream, and he resolved to ask Miss Lelanro to have it brought  hither by Blunderbore. It would at least solace his captivity, and moreover, as  the dwarf was fond of music, he could hope to entertain her on occasions.</p>
  <p>At  this point of his reflections Dr. Pryce entered the room. Though not a dwarf,  he was considerably under the stature of the average human being, and had no  difficulty in penetrating into the chamber. A mild, benign face he owned, with  kindly eyes and a white beard; yet he was so lacking in ordinary comeliness  that he resembled some gnome king, the father of the dwarfish faery in green.  With slow steps he advanced towards Warwick, and presented a glass of wine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drink  this, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; he said, placing it to the young man&rsquo;s lips, &ldquo;and then come  with me to your room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know my name, doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam  Tot has just told me your name and story,&rdquo; replied Pryce, stroking his beard. &ldquo;Your  entry here was purely accidental, yet none the less regrettable on that  account. But we will talk of these things later on. Meanwhile, leave the  chamber of Miss Lelanro, and come to your own quarters. Your head still aches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  badly, and I feel rather sick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,  ay! A sleep will do you good. Bend your head, Mr. Warwick, and your shoulders  also. Remember,&rdquo; added the doctor, smiling, as he assisted the young man to  leave the room, &ldquo;you are in the kingdom of Lilliput.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whether  it was a recurrence of his former vertigo, or that Pryce had put an opiate in  the wine, Warwick did not clearly know; but at the door of the chamber his  senses again left him, and his last recollection was of being picked up like a  child by the gigantic Blunderbore.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_V"></a>Chapter V<br>
    The New Gulliver</b></h2>
  <p>WISEACRES,  who are merely simpletons in disguise, are fond of declaring that romance is a  thing of the past; although by so foolish an assertion they unwittingly nullify  their claim to wisdom. Unable, by reason of their shallow understandings, to  take in other than external evidence, they deem romance to appertain  exclusively to courts of kings and picarooning expeditions; to require  doublets, and swords, and masks; to necessitate haunted chamber, lonely castle,  and picturesque inn; as though romance, which may be termed the miracle of  circumstance, were not independent of wardrobe, scene, and conjunction of  planets. Romance is as much with us to-day as ever it was with our forefathers;  but less apparent to the eye, less insistent in thrusting itself athwart the  current of daily life, it conceals itself under the mask of the commonplace. To  him who seeks shall it be given.</p>
  <p>In  the present instance Algernon Warwick, by no means heroic in circumstance or  requirement, found himself placed, almost against his will, in as romantic a  situation as was ever conceived by poet or novelist. To say that a handsome  youth, apparently a disguised noble, took shelter in a village inn, penetrated  through a wild forest, and scaled the walls of a feudal castle to rescue an  enchanted princess, is to treat the subject in the romance vein. To relate that  a fiddling tramp slept in a wayside hotel, trespassed on private property, and  feloniously gained admission into a country house, where he saw an undersized  lady, is to tell the same story in plain words. Yet the one description is  fitted for a faery tale, while the other, similar in all respects, smacks of  everyday life. In this way, when a story is related in plain prose, does your  wiseacre refuse to credit it with the elements of romance. Nevertheless,  romance it may be called.</p>
  <p>Warwick  considered his adventure by the light of an imaginative brain, and far from  scorning it as commonplace and prosaic, he adorned it with all the hues of  fantasy. Miss Lelanro was not an undersized lady, but a dwarf who doubtless had  elfish blood in her veins; the country house was an enchanted castle, Dr. Pryce  a fair representative of a kindly magician, and Blunderbore a giant, dull and spiteful.  In such wise can the alchemy of a youthful and poetic imagination transmute the  prosaic into the romantic.</p>
  <p>Yet  he had some excuse for so poetizing, for the strangeness of his surroundings  lifted his life out of the ordinary commonplace of existence. The dwarfish lady  was full of fancies concerning the reason of her tiny stature; and although Dr.  Pryce, hardened man of science as he was, professed to explain the matter on  physiological grounds, Warwick infinitely preferred the fantastic legend  related by Madam Tot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must know,&rdquo; said she, several days after his unexpected arrival, &ldquo;that one of  my ancestors, Sir James Lelanro, went to visit the old ferry-house of his  father, Leal Andrew. The hut was ruined and the boat gone, so, unable to cross  the river or to retrace his steps, Sir James wrapped himself in his mantle and  lay down on the bare ground to sleep till morning. By chance he had gathered a  twig of the rowan tree, which protects mortals from faery power, and also gives  them faery vision. With the rowan twig in his hand, Sir James woke at midnight  when the moon was full, and he saw the little people arrayed in green, holding  their revels. They danced and sang, and drank their wine o&rsquo; broom from goblets  of gold fashioned by the gnomes. Not knowing that Sir James by the magic of the  rowan twig could espy their solemnity, they paid no attention to his presence,  but skipped merrily in the moonshine. Remembering the story of the Musgraves,  one of whom thieved a crystal cup from the faeries, since called the Luck of  Edenhall, which brought fortune to the family, Sir James thought he would steal  a goblet also, so as to ensure a fair future to his race. With this idea he  stretched out his hand and picked up a faery cup lying on the grass. Then the  little people knew that he saw them, and with furious gestures demanded back  their golden goblet. Sir James refused to restore it, and as they were unable  to harm him because of the rowan twig, the chief faery pronounced a doom on him  and his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You  have stolen our cup,&rsquo; said the faery, &lsquo;and for that we will steal a child from  every generation of your family. It will be taken to faeryland, and we will  leave in its place a changeling who will work woe to you and yours.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  this speech the faeries vanished and Sir James fell asleep. He awoke to find  himself on the wet grass, amid the ruins of Leal Andrew&rsquo;s hut, with the golden  goblet firmly clutched in his right hand, and so took his departure from the  spot. Since then,&rdquo; said Madam Tot solemnly, &ldquo;the little people have stolen a  child from every generation of the Lelanros, and left in place of it a  changeling. I am no Lelanro, Mr. Warwick, though I call myself one, for the  real mortal is in faeryland, and I am the changeling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are then a faery,&rdquo; said Warwick, smiling at the belief of the little creature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  faery without the power of one,&rdquo; gravely replied the dwarf in all good faith. &ldquo;I  am of faery stature, I wear the livery of the little people, but my power is  taken from me, and I shall work no spells till I return at the end of my mortal  life to faeryland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what of the goblet which caused all this trouble? Does it still exist?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  A grandson of Sir James Lelanro sold it to supply the necessities of Charles  Stewart when he was in need of money. No one knows where the faery cup now is,&rdquo;  she added, &ldquo;but the changeling remains. Every generation of Lelanros has had  one of the little people placed in the cradle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hardly  had Madam Tot ceased speaking when, featherheaded and inconsequent as a child,  she ran off in chase of a white butterfly, and left Warwick in the company of  Pryce. They were in the garden under the shadow of the great wall, and at the  conclusion of the legend the young man turned towards the doctor with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  much for the ideal,&rdquo; said he inquiringly; &ldquo;now for the real. What is the reason  of this dwarfish strain in the Lelanro family?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid science cannot answer that question,&rdquo; replied Pryce, shaking his head;  &ldquo;it is one of the mysteries of Nature. The Lelanros are usually tall and  well-formed; but every now and then a dwarf is born.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  every generation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Sometimes a generation is free, and all the children attain ordinary stature.  But the strain is sure to come out again, even after the lapse of years. There  is physical as well as mental heredity, you know, Mr. Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe so,&rdquo; replied Warwick mechanically, for his thoughts were otherwhere. &ldquo;I  suppose these Lelanro dwarfs never marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly  not,&rdquo; said Dr. Pryce emphatically. &ldquo;Who would marry an abnormal creature like  that? It would be cruel and unwise. When a dwarf is born to the family it is  placed here, and its life is made as pleasant as possible. That little being is  far happier here than she would be were she allowed to be seen by all, and  mocked at for her deformity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she is not deformed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in the usual sense of the word,&rdquo; assented the doctor thoughtfully; &ldquo;but her  stature is against Nature. Were she fully grown she might be as hideous as  Caliban, and yet be able to mix with her fellow-creatures. As it is, the very  beauty of her diminutive person would attract attention and curiosity; and as  the Lelanros are a proud family, they naturally do not care to have one of  their members so regarded by the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  knows of the existence of Madam Tot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one, save myself, Simon, and Mrs. Yard, the female attendant. Our little friend  is kindly treated, and, as you see, she has every comfort. Do you not think  yourself that she is better here than exposed to the jeers of the world?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must say that I do. She seems a childish being.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is shrewd in some things, Mr. Warwick; but having no experience of life she is  still in the stage of childhood, although close on sixty years of age.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sixty  years of age,&rdquo; sighed Warwick sympathetically; &ldquo;a long time to pass in  captivity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg of you not to use that word, sir,&rdquo; said the doctor reprovingly, &ldquo;it is not  captivity to her; and you must not put such ideas into her head. Though,  perhaps,&rdquo; added the doctor, divining the reason of the sigh, &ldquo;you object to  your detention here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all, doctor. I am willing to remain till Lord Lelanro arrives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is coming here next week, Mr. Warwick, and he will then see you on the subject  of your unfortunate intrusion here. I hope you do not blame me for detaining  you, sir, as, all things being taken into consideration, I could act in no  other way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not at all angry with you,&rdquo; said Warwick, taking the hand of the elder man, &ldquo;and  I have no objection to pass a few weeks in the company of so accomplished a  scholar. But neither you nor Lord Lelanro need mistrust me, as my lips are  sealed by honour on all points regarding this place. I will breathe no word of  it to a soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  quite believe you, Mr. Warwick. From the moment you came I saw that you were a  gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid you saw wrong, doctor,&rdquo; replied the young man, flushing. &ldquo;I am not a  born gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  that I know nothing, Mr. Warwick; but you certainly give me a strong impression  that your birth is not so lowly as you would imply.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  day I shall tell you my story, doctor, and then you can judge for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  this promise the other was obliged to be content, although he could hardly  contain his very natural curiosity concerning this attractive young stranger.  Several times he had hinted at the advisability of Warwick making a confidant  of him; but with constant good-humour the youth declined to reveal his past  life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  necessary I shall relate my history to Lord Lelanro,&rdquo; said he decisively, &ldquo;and  it is very probable that, as I have unwittingly become possessed of his secret,  I shall place myself unreservedly in his hands. But till then, Dr, Pryce, I  prefer to keep my own counsel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was so much quiet determination in this reply, that Pryce could not but admire  the good sense of the young man. Notwithstanding Warwick&rsquo;s assertion of his  humble birth, the doctor could not believe that one so refined in looks and  manner could come of other than gentle blood. Moreover, in their frequent  conversations, Warwick showed himself to be a well-educated man; and in a  moment of negligence let slip the information that he had been at a prominent  public school. As wandering fiddlers do not as a rule attend such high  scholastic establishments, the good doctor settled in his own mind that Warwick  was a youth of good family who had run away from home, and feared to tell his  tale lest he might be reclaimed by his parents. Yet as he confessed to  twenty-two years of age, and was therefore beyond tutelage, this was hardly a  satisfactory explanation. Nevertheless, in default of a better it was accepted  silently by Dr. Pryce.</p>
  <p>Warwick  found his life at the Manor fairly pleasant. The domain of the dwarfs was shut  off from the rest of the house, and beyond the barrier so placed he was not  permitted to go. The high wall along the river completely excluded strangers on  that side, and heavy doors, stoutly barred, kept out prying servants from the  interior of the mansion. Madam Tot, as she was usually called, had a suite of  tiny apartments furnished commensurate to her size; but the rest of the wing  appertaining to the enclosed dwelling was arranged for the accommodation of  grown-up people. To Warwick was assigned a comfortable chamber, and he passed  most of his time in the study of Dr. Pryce, or in the garden, with Madam Tot  for company.</p>
  <p>That  garden amused and delighted Warwick. It was three acres in extent, and sloped  gently from the house to the huge wall which overhung the river. Everything  that art could do, was done to make it a pleasant domain; but all was on a  dwarfish scale, in keeping with the tiny stature of the manikin. There were  stunted trees of no great size, many low shrubs, and wide spaces of lawn,  interspersed with brilliant flower-beds. Statues of white marble, fashioned  like tiny dolls, stood on low pedestals. A miniature Venus smiled beside a  shallow pool, a dwarfish Bacchus grasped an infinitesimal bunch of grapes, a  pigmy Apollo bent a childish bow, and Hebe, less in stature than Madam Tot  herself, proffered a doll&rsquo;s cup from her pedestal. The efforts of the designer  of this miniature paradise had been directed towards a complete reduction of  everything to a size in keeping with the tiny personality of the dwarf.  Flowers, shrubs, trees, statues, summer-house, all were ideally small, and the  high walls surrounding this pigmy paradise looked inconceivably high in  comparison with the domain they enclosed. So rare a spectacle afforded Warwick  no little pleasure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Decidedly,  I am in the kingdom of Lilliput,&rdquo; said he, on the first glimpse of this garden;  &ldquo;it is not given to every one to be a Gulliver of the nineteenth century. Swift&rsquo;s  fantasy has come true in my case.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_VI"></a>Chapter VI<br>
    Madam Tot And Her Friends</b></h2>
  <p>WHEN  Warwick learned from Dr. Pryce that Lord Lelanro, informed of his unexpected  discovery of the family secret, was coming over from Paris for the express  purpose of an interview, he received the news with much satisfaction. Pleasant  and novel as was his position, he scarcely relished the idea of an indefinite  captivity; and, habituated by custom to constant wandering, to seeing fresh  faces and new neighbourhoods, he chafed at the narrow limits of his present  dwelling. He trusted that an explanation, and a promise of secrecy to Lord  Lelanro, would secure his freedom; and then he could resume his journey to  London. In the meantime, being somewhat of a philosopher, he made the best of  his anomalous position, and by so doing he gained the goodwill of those into  whose company he had been thrown by Fate. In such adaptability lies the true  secret of happiness.</p>
  <p>The  dwarfish lady in particular had taken a violent liking to Warwick; and, in  confidence, informed him that he was the handsomest man of her acquaintance. As  this was limited to three elderly men, none of whom were remarkable for good  looks, the compliment was rather pointless; for Warwick was more attractive  than Simon the guardian, Dr. Pryce the medical attendant, or Lord Lelanro, who  was even older than his unfortunate sister. These three with Mrs. Vard, a prim  antiquated dame who acted as personal attendant and nurse, formed the little world  of Madam Tot. In all her sixty years she had seen no other faces, save those of  two people who, having died, had been replaced by Simon and Pryce. It is then  scarcely to be wondered at that the handsome looks of an engaging youth like  Warwick awakened the femininity of the little creature.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  her visitor possessed accomplishments which ravished the soul of Madam Tot. He  played the violin, which had been sought for and restored to its owner by the  redoubtable Blunderbore; he told the most delightful stories, and he could set  the poetry&mdash;which the dwarf was constantly writing&mdash;to beautiful music. Nature,  which had denied the ordinary physical advantages of humanity to this being,  had gifted her with the soul of a poet, and she had a wonderful facility for  stringing verses on such trivial events as varied the monotony of her  existence. Sometimes Warwick would suggest a theme, such as &ldquo;The Faeries,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The  Stream,&rdquo; and accompany her on his violin, while Madam Tot would improvise  verses thereon, and, excited by music and inspiration, deliver them with the  dramatic fury of a diminutive Rachel. But she required many fatiguing  compliments at the conclusion of these displays, for she had a childish vanity  sufficient to fit out a dozen full-grown human beings.</p>
  <p>She  took it into her whimsical brain one morning that Warwick had not seen all the  glories of her dwelling, and so sought him in Dr. Pryce&rsquo;s library for the  purpose of showing him round the house. The young man, who had become very  friendly with the old one, was discussing the laws of heredity in relation to  the Lelanro dwarfs, a subject on which Pryce was enthusiastic, and being in the  full tide of argument, he was unwilling to humour the whim of the little  creature. Madam Tot saw this hesitation, and, a common occurrence with her,  became fractious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  Mr. Warwick!&rdquo; she cried, with the shrill voice she affected when angered. &ldquo;Am I  to be disobeyed in my own house, by my own servants&mdash;by my own guest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Madam Tot, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that name, I beg, sir. I am Miss Lelanro at present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  hinted that Warwick was out of favour, for only when she stood on her dignity  did the little lady insist on her rightful appellation. She paused before them,  tapping her ebony crutch on the oaken floor like an enraged faery godmother;  and Dr. Pryce, who was fearful of the effect of such uncontrolled passions on  her delicate frame, nodded to Warwick that he should accept the invitation; a  hint which he reluctantly accepted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Warwick will go with you, Miss Lelanro,&rdquo; said Pryce in a soothing tone; &ldquo;we can  finish our argument another time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall finish it, sir, when I so choose,&rdquo; replied the angered faery. &ldquo;I wonder  you are not afraid to offend me. Remember, I am a changeling, and if I would,  could punish you very severely. There are certain friends of mine,&rdquo; finished  she significantly, &ldquo;who do what I ask them. It is as well, doctor, not to  offend the good neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pryce  did not dare to smile at this fantastic speech, but, to soothe her injured  dignity, he asked pardon, which was granted after some sulking. Then the doctor  returned to his books, and Madam Tot, with great dignity, sailed out of the  room, with Warwick after her, like a mighty three-decker in the wake of a  tug-boat. He could not forbear a quiet smile at their contrast of bulk and  stature.</p>
  <p>Delighted  at gaining her ends, for she was very human in many ways, the little creature  chatted pleasantly, and made herself thoroughly agreeable, a thing which she  did not always choose to do. Her moods were various, and succeeded one another  with inconsequent rapidity. Sometimes she would be a smiling angel, at others,  sulk and pout like a naughty child; and not unfrequently she gave way to  causeless passions of tears. This whimsical nature was condoned by those around  as part of her affliction; and every care was taken to let her have her own way  when possible. This constant fostering of her failings frequently brought out  the worst of her traits. So provoking could she be, that Warwick oftentimes  wondered if after all she might not be kin to Robin Goodfellow, for she was as  tricksy, as wayward, as inconsequent as Oberon&rsquo;s henchman. Yet withal the human  side of her character, which she now displayed, was so engaging that the young  man could not but pet her, as he would an irresponsible child. Poor Madam Tot,  so fanciful, so changeable, so lovable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Pryce is a good creature,&rdquo; said she in a patronizing tone when they left the  library, &ldquo;but rather odd&mdash;rather odd. He holds views of which I by no means  approve. You might not think it, Mr. Warwick, but he disbelieves in ghosts,  faeries, witches, and goblins. Quite a sceptic, my dear, quite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  he been here long, Madam Tot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty  years, more or less. I had Dr. Gulder for a medical attendant before him. But  Gulder died, and Pryce came. I wasn&rsquo;t sorry, my dear, for Gulder was a dreadful  ogre. Oh, yes, I have reason to believe,&rdquo; said the little woman mysteriously, &ldquo;that  Gulder was descended from the giant who figures in the tale of Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb.  H&rsquo;m! yes. An ogre, Mr. Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time they had arrived at an ordinary-sized door, terminating a narrow  passage, and Madam Tot pointed upward to the handle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Open  it, please. I cannot reach so high. You are now about to see my ancestors. Not  the grown-up ones, but the little people such as I am. My portrait has lately  been added to the collection. Pryce, who is no mean artist, has reproduced my  delicate looks in a masterly manner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the strangest picture gallery which Warwick had ever beheld. Of no great  extent or height, nevertheless large enough for him to walk thereunder at ease,  it was roofed with glass, and on either side were five portraits, life-size, of  the Lelanro dwarfs. The whole ten representations resembled Madam Tot in a  marked degree; and it seemed as though Nature, in transmitting delicate body  and diminutive stature, had also impressed on each succeeding generation the  features of the former. In trunk hose, in farthingales, in wigs and hoops,  powder and patches, brocaded coats, and red-heeled shoes, the dwarfs, male and  female, were habited in the costumes of their various epochs, and all smiled  weird and uncanny-looking out of their several frames. Yet not one was  deformed, not one was ungraceful; instead of a gallery of dwarfs it might have  been a series of the delicate beings feigned to haunt stream, and wood, and  hill.</p>
  <p>Madam  Tot ran her cane along the pictures, and rattled off the names and histories of  her ancestors with great delight. It was noticeable that she termed none of  them dwarfs, but characterized them by the suave term of &ldquo;little people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Andrew  Lelanro, the son of Sir James who stole the goblet. He was the first of the  little people, and here is his sister Margaret, who was quite a beauty.  Malcolm, on the left, was a Jacobite, and would have fought for the exiled  House of Stewart had he been tall enough. Of course you know,&rdquo; said Madam Tot,  breaking off, &ldquo;that we have always been famous for our devotion to that  unfortunate family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I have heard how your ancestor obtained his estates and name,&rdquo; replied Warwick  gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  Leal and Row,&rdquo; said Madam Tot, with great satisfaction. &ldquo;Lelanro! I am proud of  belonging to so loyal, to so great a house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  looked sympathetically at the little woman, and wondered if she felt the  indignity of her dwarfish stature, which was the penalty of her greatness; but  he was soon corrected on that point. Apparently such an idea had never entered  her mind, and she regarded her unique personality as an honour rather than as a  misfortune.</p>
  <p>The  ineffable pride with which she talked of this dwarf and the other would have  been amusing, had it not been, to Warwick&rsquo;s mind, so pitiful. It reminded him  of the fable of the fox who lost his tail, for Madam Tot, not being as tall and  bulky as the rest of the human race, affected to despise such as overgrown  monsters, and lauded her own delicacy and diminutiveness. In the most  conscientious manner she repeated the history of each portrait, and finally  came to her own, before which she smirked and smiled with overweening pride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see I am painted in my favourite green colour,&rdquo; said she, simpering; &ldquo;it is the  livery of the good neighbours. You must notice, Mr. Warwick, that I stand in  the centre of a faery ring on a mushroom-spotted sward, in allusion to my  kinship with faery powers. By the way, there is a Ring of Elves in the garden,  Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; she added, following her last thought with noticeable  fiightiness. &ldquo;Come and let us seek it. Often have I seen them dance there in  the cold moonshine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was characteristic of the dwarf that she rarely followed a train of thought for  many moments, but let her actions be guided by the last idea which entered her  capricious mind. The suggestion of the faery ring delineated in the picture  withdrew her thoughts from further leading Warwick through the house;  therefore, in pursuance of her last whim, he found himself in the garden. Here  he looked down from his five feet odd on a miniature forest of shrubs and low bushes,  amid which moved the little lady, chattering shrilly as was her custom when  excited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yonder,&rdquo;  said she, pointing with her staff, &ldquo;is the ring of the good neighbours. Pryce&mdash;a  sceptic, my dear&mdash;says it is but a discoloration of the grass; but I know  better. He has no rowan-tree twig by which to see things as they are; but I,  akin to the people of peace, have a clearer vision, and I can see that here my  kinsfolk hold their solemnities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  this speech, made in all good faith, she showed Warwick a circular patch at the  side of the lawn; and skipped round it in emulation of the faeries till she was  out of breath.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page049.jpg" width="465" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am old now, my dear,&rdquo; she said pathetically, &ldquo;and cannot dance as I used to.  But a little time and the little people will carry me back to faery land, where  I shall see a great deal of company. I should like to take you with me, Mr.  Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  Madam Tot, would you lead me captive thither like a second True Thomas?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the dwarf&rsquo;s attention was already distracted by the sight of the gardener, who  advanced towards them, towering over Warwick as much as the youth did over  Madam Tot. Simon was a good-natured, stupid sort of creature, greatly given to  grumbling, as, despite the high wage he received, he did not care about being  penned up in the Manor House. His mistress saluted him with much vivacity,  complimented him on his restoration of her summer-house, and then related his  history to Warwick, with as much impertinence as though he were not present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simon  is a good creature,&rdquo; she said, digging at the legs of the huge man with her  cane, &ldquo;but very stupid, very dull, like all giants. My brother saw him at a  fair, where he earned his living in a caravan, and thinking he was tall enough  to protect me, hired him as a guardian to my domain. I call him Blunderbore  because he is so great an oaf. Here he gets good food, a good bed, he has a  kind mistress, and his beer, yet he wants to go out into the wide world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  ne&rsquo;er a lass here,&rdquo; growled the giant sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  you see,&rdquo; snapped Madam Tot, prodding him with fresh vigour, &ldquo;this Polyphemus  is in love; he wants a wife. Indeed, no, Blunderbore. I&rsquo;m not going to let you  marry, and people my garden with mountains of flesh; noisy children who would  crush my flowers. Get along with you. If you want to talk to some one, there&rsquo;s  Mrs. Vard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Blunderbore  growled out something to the effect that Mrs. Vard was an old hag, then moved  away to attend to his work; while Madam Tot, seizing her last idea, was all on  the alert to see Mrs. Vard, and, followed by Warwick, she skipped up the path  like a restless doll. At the door of the house they were met by the nurse, a  motherly old creature, with a kind, withered face, and white hair. Immediately  the dwarf rambled into a history of this last of the beings who populated her  world.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  nurse, Mrs. Vard, is eighty years of age, Mr. Warwick. She was with me when I  was born, and has been by my side ever since. I am only sixty, quite a child  beside her. I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll die soon,&rdquo; cried the dwarf, bursting into tears, &ldquo;and  then I shall be all alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  cry, my dear little one,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vard, picking her up as she would a child, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  last a long time yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till  I go back to faeryland, then,&rdquo; sobbed Madam Tot, who always spoke of her death  in this ambiguous fashion, &ldquo;but not before&mdash;not before. Who would put me to bed,  and sing me songs, and tell me stories, but you, Moggy Vard? I want no one but  you. I am extremely attached to you, dear. Send that person away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  allusion was to Warwick, who, thus ungratefully dismissed, returned to the  library, and left the dwarf to recover her smiles in the arms of the faithful  Moggy.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_VII"></a>Chapter VII<br>
    A Strange Story</b></h2>
  <p>IT  was with a certain feeling of uneasiness that Warwick looked forward to the  arrival of Lord Lelanro, for he was well aware that his presence at the Manor  House laid him open to disagreeable suspicion and weighty reproof. Though it  was true that the immediate cause of his intrusion was accidental, yet it was  difficult to explain how he had come to be in the vicinity of wall and stream,  without confessing to an undignified curiosity. The path by the river led to no  destination, and was far from the high-road, so Warwick could not account for  his presence in the Lelanro lands on the pretext that he was pursuing his  journey to London. If, therefore, as he expected, although on no reasonable  grounds, Lord Lelanro proved to be a severe man, he would be likely to read  this trespasser a sharp lecture, such as his pride could ill brook.</p>
  <p>Fortunately  Warwick was now fairly intimate with the good doctor, and, as this latter was  likely to know the idiosyncrasies of his master, the young man resolved to  consult him as to the best course to adopt. Hitherto he had not made a  confidant of Pryce, owing to a certain amount of inherent reserve; but in this  instance he broke through his natural distaste for talking of himself to a  stranger, and related as much of his past as he thought fit; reserving the pith  of the matter for the ear of Lelanro.</p>
  <p>As  usual, Pryce was in his study, an apartment of no very great extent, lined on  all four sides with well-bound books. The roof was domed, and divided by narrow  windows of stained glass, so that the daylight filtering through created a dim  twilight, fitted for the monastic quiet of the place. An oriel window,  emblazoned with family escutcheons, overlooked the domain of Madam Tot; and  where the bookshelves ceased, the walls were draped with antique tapestry,  woven with the loves of gods and goddesses. This apartment was luxuriously  furnished, yet the tints of draperies and carpets and cushions were so subdued,  and the atmosphere was so tenebrous, that the tone of the whole was such as to  chill a stranger at the outset. A magician&rsquo;s cave, an anchorite&rsquo;s cell could  not have inspired a greater spirit of discomfort.</p>
  <p>To  Warwick the study was not without a quiet charm of its own, for his imagination  found food for dreams and. fancies in the sober brown atmosphere. And  oftentimes when disposed to reflection, he would ensconce himself in the oriel  depths with a tome of ancient learning at his elbow. But again a revulsion of feeling,  a longing for wet wind and breezy down, and the memory of warm sunlight asleep  on purple uplands, would send him out into the garden, there to fret at the  narrow confines of his prison house. Then he would betake himself to his  violin, and express this nostalgia of the wilds in capricious strains,  passionate with longing and impatient desire. The passing of these fits of  Nature-worship always sent him back to books and dreams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hear,&rdquo; said he, laying down his violin on the oriel seat, &ldquo;that Miss Lelanro  expects her brother to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will be here at noon,&rdquo; replied Dr. Pryce, raising his eyes; &ldquo;and, I have no  doubt, he will at once listen to your explanation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he a severe man, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  looks so, Mr. Warwick, but at heart he is exceedingly kind. I had not been here  else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,  lad,&rdquo; responded the student with a sad smile; &ldquo;born to a life of strife and  temptation, with a nature that could ill withstand such things, I was fast  being sucked into the vortex of destruction when Lelanro stretched out his hand  and drew me to this safe-refuge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was good of him to do so. You have been here many years?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Over  twenty, sir. When Dr. Gulder died it was necessary that another medical  attendant should be obtained for the unfortunate little creature, and I was  chosen. Here I have been since, and here I hope to die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you not find it dull?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  youth! youth! youth!&rdquo; sighed Pryce, shaking his grey head, &ldquo;how well I know  what you feel. To your two-and-twenty years, Mr. Warwick, this quiet seems  dull, this house appears a prison. I never thought so myself. The iron of the  world had entered deeply into my heart before I sought refuge here, and I was  willing to give up riches, ambition, love, friends, everything for the sake of  peace. Some day you will feel as I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust not,&rdquo; replied Warwick, with a flush. &ldquo;Movement and freedom are to me the  breath of life, I like this quiet on occasions, but there are other times when  I long for my former wandering life; to tramp across limitless moors, to listen  to the waves breaking on rocky shores, to sleep in the moonlight to the lullaby  of the nightingale. That is life&mdash;here existence is akin to death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have travelled much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the last few years, yes,&rdquo; answered the youth carelessly; &ldquo;and as poverty has  made me acquainted with the rough side of the world, I have profited by its  teaching.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are indeed older than your years, Warwick. I have met with no lad at once so  judicious and thoughtful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  I was neither, to plant myself on the hither side of the stream, and meddle  with matters which concerned me not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  natural curiosity of youth,&rdquo; responded Pryce composedly; &ldquo;tell my lord the  truth, and I do not think you will find him over severe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is old, is he not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay!  He bears the weight of eighty years. A wise and renowned gentleman, sir, one  who has lived in cities and courts; who has borne his part in the councils of  kings and in the wars of the nations. Such a one, Mr. Warwick, is not likely to  judge hastily of your youthful folly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope not,&rdquo; said Warwick, slightly reddening; &ldquo;and when he hears my story I  trust he will find even more excuse. You know,&rdquo; added he after a reflective  pause, &ldquo;that I came advisedly to Dalesford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed.  It is an out-of-the-way village, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  seek in London a man called Ballard,&rdquo; resumed Warwick, paying no attention to  the remark, &ldquo;and as I have reason to believe he comes from this hamlet, I  thought it advisable to see the place for myself on my way to town. By taking a  slight detour I managed to strike it, and, to my surprise, I slept at an inn  kept by a landlady of the same name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will be Mistress Sally. Did you remark on the coincidence?&rdquo; said the doctor, a  trifle embarrassed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  To tell you the truth, I did not think of it until I had left the inn, and was  fiddling under the Manor wall. I intended to have returned and questioned  Mistress Sally, but that Fate interposed and placed me within these walls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  it be an impertinence on my part to ask your reason for seeking Ballard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  hesitated, and drummed fretfully on the table with his fingers, an anxious look  clouding his brow. At length he made up his mind to answer in the affirmative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  seek him as one who knows my birth and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  parentage,&rdquo; finished Pryce, seeing him hesitate again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I am aware of my parentage. There is no need to mention that now. When I tell  all to Lord Lelanro I will include you as a listener. My father did not know  whence he sprang, but he believed firmly that this man Ballard was possessed of  such knowledge. Therefore I wish to find him, and if possible to learn the  truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no clue to your birth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  placed before the student the paper inscribed with his name and the date of his  father&rsquo;s birth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, doctor, that bears the name &lsquo;Algernon&rsquo; and the date &lsquo;24 December, 1857.&rsquo;  The name is that of my father, and the date presumably that of his  birth&mdash;though, indeed, I have my doubts as to the latter being correct. Herein,  said my father before he died, is concealed the mystery of our race and  station.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  name, a date,&rdquo; said Pryce, examining this scanty clue. &ldquo;I can make nothing of  it. Wherever did your father obtain it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot tell you that, for I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!  It is a slight guide for so great a matter. You have tried to unravel it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hundreds  of times; but always without success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should give it to Madam Tot,&rdquo; said Pryce, smiling, &ldquo;she is passionately devoted  to charades, and riddles, and cryptograms. She, if any one, will discover the  solution of this. To my mind the junction of letters, and figures, hints at a  cryptogram; that is,&rdquo; added the student pedantically, &ldquo;a secret writing wherein  the letters are purposely thrown into confusion in order to conceal a secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have thought so myself,&rdquo; replied Warwick, restoring the paper to his  pocket-book; &ldquo;but it cannot be so, for, as you can see for yourself, there is  no confusion. Date and name are both intelligible enough, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  true, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; answered Pryce, drawing his brows together. &ldquo;Nevertheless  in anagrams, for instance, a readable and intelligent sentence can be composed  by transposing the letters of a name. In this case it is not impossible that,  by placing the letters of the name Algernon in a certain order, another name  may be evolved&mdash;possibly that of the family to which you belong. However, I am  no adept in such literary mysteries. Madam Tot is more likely to unriddle the  puzzle than I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  I shall put Madam Tot&rsquo;s capabilities to the test. Nature often puts great wits  in little heads. And now, Dr, Pryce,&rdquo; added Warwick hurriedly, &ldquo;I have told you  so much of my story as suffices for the present. In return let me hear of the  Lelanro family, and especially of the head of the house, so that I may know how  I stand. You say that Lord Lelanro is eighty years of age, and that he is  lenient in his judgments. What more?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has a grand-daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  said Mistress Sally, who showed me her portrait. A very charming young lady,  with rather a sad expression.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  sighed Pryce, shaking his head. &ldquo;Can you wonder that she is sad, knowing what  we know of Madam Tot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frankly  speaking, I do wonder. There is nothing repulsive about the dwarfish lady that  should make her relations shudder. And to speak frankly, doctor,&rdquo; continued  Warwick decisively, &ldquo;I see no need to shut up the little creature as though she  were a monstrosity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Lelanros do not like to own that they have such a freak in their family. They  are very proud, Mr. Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  very cruel! I think it is foolish to be sad on account of the pigmy, and to  imprison her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  one has his own way of looking at things,&rdquo; responded the doctor dryly, &ldquo;and the  Lelanros think these monstrous births a great infliction. Each member of the  family is told of the secret when he or she reaches the age of twenty, and as  Miss Celia was informed of it this year, naturally she thinks a great deal  about the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  looks sad on that account. Strange that a sensible human being should be so  foolish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not seem to feel any repulsion at the sight of a dwarf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Why should I?&rdquo; answered Warwick frankly. &ldquo;Madam Tot is beautifully formed, and  is a most engaging little creature. Moreover, I have seen&mdash;But there,&rdquo; he added  abruptly, &ldquo;you will hear my principal reason later on. What more of the Lelanro  family? Mistress Sally tells me that when the present lord dies his estates and  title go to a distant relative.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough, Mr. Warwick. The direct line ends with my patron. He had a son, a fine  young man, who was killed in the hunting field many years ago. His widow  afterwards gave birth to a posthumous child&mdash;to Miss Celia, and died also. Lord  Lelanro was much affected at the death of his heir, and he was greatly grieved  when the child proved to be a girl, knowing thereby that the title would pass  to his distant relation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did he not marry again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that I can&rsquo;t tell you!&rdquo; answered Pryce dubiously; &ldquo;but no doubt he has a reason  for continuing a widower.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  he no other children but the son who died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor looked oddly at Warwick as he asked this question, and did not answer  for some few moments. When he did so it was in an evasive manner, which was in  direct contrast to his ordinarily straightforward speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  may have been others, Mr. Warwick; but if so they died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!  I wonder if there were any dwarfs?&rdquo; muttered the young man to himself.</p>
  <p>Pryce  rose from his chair with a frown, and swung off sharply towards the window.  Seeing that he was unwilling to speak further on the subject, Warwick forbore  to make any comment on this silence; but nevertheless he reflected that here  was another secret connected with this strange family. An odd idea had entered  his brain, to which he hardly dared to give credence, yet there it stayed, and  there it ripened to fruition many weeks later. The germ was planted that day in  the study, when Pryce so awkwardly evaded a plain answer to a plain question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Warwick,&rdquo; said the doctor, coming towards him with the violin, &ldquo;now that we  have had our talk, play me a tune on this. If all other means fail to  propitiate my lord, fiddle yourself into his good graces, for he is as fond of  music as is his poor little sister yonder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  mechanically placed the instrument under his chin, and grasped the bow as he  moved towards the open window. A breath of scented air, borne over the wall  from the distant country, floated into the room, and carried with it that  imperative longing for fragrant meadows and dimpling streams which seized him  at times. Filled with this nostalgia of the woods, he drew the bow across the  strings, and forthwith there leaped out a silvery strain telling of his rustic  desires. The flutter of butterflies, the piping of birds at dawn, the  dew-sprinkled meads, blent themselves in that pure melody. Carried away by the  music rippling from the violin, Warwick closed his eyes, and let his soul float  in pursuit of homely dreams; the clink of the milk-pails, the blithe song of  the home-coming peasant, swaths lying yellow in the hot harvest sun; again he  felt the odour of mown hay in his nostrils, he heard the drowsy hum of the  mill-wheel, and listened to the gurgle of the water amid the rustling reeds. Ah!  it was a peaceful and beautiful dream transmuted into sound.</p>
  <p>A  rapid patter of little feet, and Madam Tot, attracted from afar by the music, trotted  into the room. In silence she looked up at the musician with a serious face,  and in his turn he opened his eyes, to find the little creature at his knee. To  please her he tuned a merry country dance fit for blowsy wench and stalwart  haymaker; but such rusticity did not please the ethereal soul of the  changeling. With a frown she lifted a tiny hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  yokel dance for me,&rdquo; she cried impulsively. &ldquo;I want neither rustic strain nor  harvest revelry. Think of the little people in the moonshine, who whirl in  wavering circles round and round. The owls hoot, the wind rustles the leaves,  and the faeries clad in green hold high solemnity. Play for the elves; no  rustic round for the peaceful neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wherewith  Warwick drew from his instrument a strain so fantastically beautiful that she  uttered a cry of surprise, and as the wild music waxed louder and more elfish  under the sweeping bow, she picked up her green skirts and footed it merrily.  With bound and whirl she spun in the sunlight, and still the strains echoed  through the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear,&rdquo; cried she, sinking exhausted to the floor, &ldquo;you must play in the  moonshine. Were I queen of the elves you should be my music-maker.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_VIII"></a>Chapter VIII<br>
    The Head Of The Family</b></h2>
  <p>RATHER  to his surprise Warwick was not at once accorded an interview by Lord Lelanro,  as he had anticipated. On the contrary a whole day elapsed before they came  together; and during that time the old gentleman questioned both his sister and  Pryce as to the personality and behaviour of the stranger. From each he  received an enthusiastic report, which prepossessed him in Warwick&rsquo;s favour;  and therefore he maintained a different attitude during the interview, to that  which he would have assumed had the young man been uncouth and uncultured. In  place of regretting this unexpected arrival, Lelanro, who had a use for the  youth, rather congratulated himself on the trick of Fate.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  the descriptions severally given by Madam Tot and the doctor interested him in  no small degree; for he found it difficult to reconcile the statement that  Warwick was a gentleman, and a public school boy, with the damning fact that he  tramped the country as an itinerant musician. On the instant this ex-ambassador  espied a mystery; and it was therefore with no little curiosity that he  repaired after dinner to the study of Dr. Pryce for the purpose of conversing  with his guest. In reality Warwick regarded himself as a prisoner, which  opinion would have considerably surprised the courteous old lord had he known  of it; for notwithstanding the abrupt entrance and lowly profession of the  youth, the mere fact that two such excellent judges as Madam Tot and Pryce  considered him to be of gentle birth, predisposed Lelanro to regard him in the  light of a guest.</p>
  <p>Warwick,  still in his poor clothes&mdash;for, with the exception of clean linen, he had been  unable to procure other garments&mdash;arose from his seat as Lord Lelanro  approached. He beheld a slender and stately old gentleman, carefully arrayed in  evening dress, and from his air of command he instinctively guessed the  identity of the new-comer. Notwithstanding the sore burden of eighty years,  Lelanro&rsquo;s form was not bent, nor was the fire in his blue eyes dimmed to any  appreciable extent. Although his crown was bald, yet there was a goodly circle  of white locks round his head; he wore a moustache jauntily pointed on the  upper lip, an imperial on the chin; both of these were snow-white, and in  conjunction with his clear skin, seamed with myriad wrinkles, fine as though  drawn by a needle, gave him an air of great distinction. Once Warwick  remembered to have seen a portrait of Charles Stewart, and here he beheld the  semblance of him in the flesh; nor, to complete the likeness, was wanting the  melancholy look that characterized those of that royal and unfortunate House.  Scandal hinted at a strain of Stewart blood in the veins of the Lelanros, and  certainly the appearance of the present holder of the title went far to confirm  the assertion.</p>
  <p>Ever  courteous, and now the more so as his guest was poor and unknown, Lord Lelanro  bowed in recognition of Warwick&rsquo;s respectful greeting, and motioned him to  resume his seat. A few moments previously Dr. Pryce had left the study, so that  the two were absolutely alone, and being seated by the table on which stood a  shaded lamp, Lelanro took advantage of the opportunity to read the face of his  guest. With a turn of his hand he so placed the shade that while he remained in  shadow the countenance of the young man was in the glare. Thus prepared to note  if the facial expression confirmed what the lips uttered, Lelanro proceeded to  open the conversation. Hitherto respect had sealed the lips of his younger  companion.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page063.jpg" width="620" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Pryce informs me that your name is Algernon Warwick,&rdquo; said the elder gentleman  in a mellow voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you entered my house by accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  lord, it was accidental in one way, but not in another,&rdquo; said Warwick,  determined to conceal nothing. &ldquo;But that my foolish curiosity drew me to view  the wall on the river&rsquo;s brink, I had not fallen in; and but for such immersion,  which in itself was an accident, I had not scaled the wall, and so surprised  your secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to see that you speak frankly,&rdquo; replied Lelanro, favourably impressed  by this candid admission. &ldquo;And may I ask what first roused your curiosity about  my house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  wall itself, my lord. I was coming to Dalesford along the high-road, and weary  with tramping on the hard stones, I took advantage of a bend in the highway to  walk across the fields. By so doing I shortened my journey, and soothed my sore  feet. In taking this short cut I passed by your house, and I was much  astonished at the massive wall which fronted the river.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  speak excellently, sir,&rdquo; said the old lord approvingly, &ldquo;and I note you  recognize the value of our English tongue. Proceed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  stayed for the night at the &lsquo;Lelanro Arms,&rsquo; my lord, and there I heard some  talk of your lordship&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  Mistress Sally lets her tongue run freely, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  no means, my lord,&rdquo; replied Warwick, distressed at the idea of inculpating the  friendly landlady; &ldquo;she said nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  looked a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  lord, though young in years, experience has taught me how to read faces. I do  not say that she looked in any pointed fashion; but I noted her embarrassment  when I mentioned the wall, and so my curiosity was revived concerning the  purpose for which it was built.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lelanro  looked vexed, and eyed the young man keenly, for although these frank  confessions disarmed his anger, he was nevertheless ill pleased at the  perspicuity of the youth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad all men are not so gifted,&rdquo; said he after a pause, &ldquo;else words would be  of no value to hide thought, for oftentimes face reveals what tongue would  hide. But do you not think, Mr. Warwick, that your curiosity was unwarrantable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  to that I can only throw myself on your lordship&rsquo;s mercy,&rdquo; replied the youth,  with flushed cheek.</p>
  <p>For  a moment or so Lelanro made no reply. He was pleased with the candour of the  young man, and also with his ingenuous manner; therefore, though ruffled at  what he could not but regard as a meddlesome curiosity, he forgave the fault  for the honesty of the speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are but a lad, I see,&rdquo; he remarked gently, &ldquo;and though I have the right to be  angry with the liberty you have taken, yet, as you admit your folly and court  blame, I will not be hard on you. Let us say no more about it, Mr. Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  your lordship will not impute blame to Mistress Sally,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! She is sufficiently discreet, though, indeed, she knows nothing but what  may be constructed out of gossip and imagination. I see plainly that your gifts  are beyond your years, and from what you have told me it would need a  remarkably self-controlled person to baffle those thought-reading eyes of  yours. Well, sir, your curiosity being thus roused, you took a second look at  the wall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  my lord; and I was punished by falling into the nver. I must confess, however,  that while playing on my violin, I heard Miss Lelanro singing beyond the wall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  further roused your curiosity,&rdquo; responded Lelanro dryly, &ldquo;and you resolved to  scale the wall, and release the enchanted prisoner ensconced behind it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really don&rsquo;t know what I should have done,&rdquo; said Warwick honestly, though his  cheek burned; &ldquo;but Fate took the matter out of my hands, and I had either to  climb the wall or let myself be drowned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  as self-preservation is the first law of nature you took the former  alternative. Well, Mr. Warwick, you have told your story honestly, and that  condones your fault in my eyes. I am a reader of character also, of much more  experience than you, and had you told a falsehood, not all your conversational  powers would have saved you from my anger. I dare say, with your perspicuity,  you guessed why I altered that lamp-shade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  see my face, was it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right,  sir! You are certainly no fool,&rdquo; replied Lelanro, with grim approval. &ldquo;Well,  sir, now that I know the truth, what am I to do with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  other made no reply, but hung his head in some confusion, while the old lord  revolved in his own mind the circumstances of the case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have surprised a secret which our race would fain hide,&rdquo; he continued, rising  and pacing the room. &ldquo;Many rumours are rife in the country and in town  concerning the monster kept in the Lelanro Manor House. You see for yourself &lsquo;tis  only a poor little dwarf, who is kindly treated and well looked after. So far  as humanity goes the whole world might know the truth; but in accordance with  the traditions of our family I do not choose to let it be known. You have  become wiser than your fellows, and I am puzzled to know what course to pursue.  I cannot keep you prisoner, and yet, if you go, who knows what you may say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  lordship need have no fear,&rdquo; retorted Warwick haughtily. &ldquo;I promise you that no  word shall pass my lips. Young as I am, my lord, you can confide in my honour  as profoundly as in your own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old nobleman stopped short and eyed the lad before him with some astonishment.  He was not ill-pleased at the haughty outburst, and contrasting it with the  former deference and humility of the young man, he was convinced that both his  sister and the doctor were right in their surmise. The youth had good blood in  his veins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will settle the question later on,&rdquo; said he after a pause; &ldquo;first, I would know  more about you, Mr. Warwick. May I ask who you are?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  wandering fiddler, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your name, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  Christian name, Algernon, was borne by my father,&rdquo; replied the youth, &ldquo;the  other was taken by me from the place of my birth. I was born, my lord, in the  town of Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo;  muttered Lelanro, caressing his chin, &ldquo;you speak, look, and act like a  gentleman, yet your statement&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proclaims  that I am not one! Very true, my lord! I put forward no claim to gentle birth,  yet as my father was ignorant whence he sprang, I may come of a good stock for  all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  was your father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  lord,&rdquo; said Warwick, with great confusion, &ldquo;you have a right to my confidence,  since you have forgiven my folly so kindly, and I shall tell you that which  hitherto I have revealed to no man. My father&mdash;my father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on, lad,&rdquo; said Lelanro kindly, seeing the shamed look in the lad&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;who  was your father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  bit his lip, and stammered out the words with an effort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was a dwarf, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Astonished  at so unexpected a reply, Lelanro turned pale, and sank into his former seat  with an ejaculation, which even his self-control could not prevent. Soon his  brow grew dark, and he frowned ominously at the young man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are mocking me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  my lord; I swear it is the truth,&rdquo; responded Warwick, with great emotion. &ldquo;My  father was a dwarf scarce higher than your poor sister, who exhibited himself  at fairs for his livelihood. He married one who called herself the Fair  Circassian, who made her living by showing her beauty to the crowd. I am the  offspring of the pair,&rdquo; gasped Warwick, with a painful contraction of the throat,  &ldquo;I was&mdash;I was born in a booth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your speech, your behaviour. These do not suit with such humble birth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  lord, I was educated at a public school for over ten years. My father was a  great believer in the possibility that he came of good stock, and so, desiring  to give me every advantage, he spent what money he possessed in aiding me to  achieve a position in the world. I was taken away while young and placed at the  school. I did not know the truth till two years ago, when I finished my  education. Then the money was spent, my father and mother were dead, and I was  thrown penniless on the world. To support myself I took up the profession of a  strolling fiddler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lelanro  rested his chin on his hand and looked straight at Warwick. He saw perfectly  well that the lad spoke truly, and was overcome with shame at having to make so  humiliating a confession. Signing him to stand up, he looked at him long and  earnestly, and found it difficult to believe that so well-grown and graceful a  lad could own a dwarf for a father. A trifle beyond the ordinary stature, he  was slender and well-made; and in looks and demeanour he showed himself to be  one with gentle blood in his veins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  strange confession,&rdquo; said Lelanro slowly; &ldquo;be seated, Mr. Warwick, and relate  your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_IX"></a>Chapter IX<br>
    The Tale Of A Nameless Man</b></h2>
  <p>BEFORE  Warwick could comply with the request of his host, Dr. Pryce quietly entered  the room, but seeing the pair in deep conversation, he hesitated to come  forward lest he should prove to be the inconvenient third. Noting his doubtful  attitude, Lelanro addressed himself with marked courtesy to his young  companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust, Mr. Warwick, you will have no objection to the presence of Dr. Pryce,&rdquo;  said he deliberately; &ldquo;he is completely in my confidence, and anything you may  say is as safe with him as with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  only have I no objection, my lord, but a promise made by me to Dr. Pryce some  days ago entitles him to hear all I have to tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  authorized, Pryce bowed, and seated himself at Warwick&rsquo;s elbow; when, without  further preamble, the young man proceeded to narrate the story of his early  years.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I said before, my lord,&rdquo; began Warwick, directing his conversation more  particularly to Lelanro, &ldquo;my father was a dwarf, and exhibited himself at fairs  and merrymakings, under the management of a man who called himself Autolycus.  That appellation, as you may guess, was taken from a drama of Shakespeare&rsquo;s,  and was doubtless chosen on account of its applicability to the profession of  him who assumed it. Autolycus, he called himself, and so he was known  throughout the Midlands, where he usually travelled with his show. This was a  collection of freaks, such as are to be found at every fair; and the booth  wherein these unfortunates were exhibited was a miserable though ingenious  structure, which could be taken to pieces and put together at will. With this  Autolycus travelled from fair to fair, and made, if not a fortune, at least a  comfortable competency. He was a stout, asthmatic man, who constantly wore a  dirty white overcoat, and a cravat of crimson worsted. But in spite of his  rough exterior he had a kindly heart, and it is to him that I owe my education.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  paid for it, I suppose, Mr. Warwick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  my lord; but seeing that I was a lad of intelligence, he suggested to my father  that I should be sent to a public school, which accordingly was done. But this  is anticipating,&rdquo; said Warwick hastily, &ldquo;as I have not told you of my father&rsquo;s  marriage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  show of Autolycus,&rdquo; resumed Warwick, after a pause, &ldquo;consisted of a fat woman,  a thin man, my father Algernon the dwarf, the Fair Circassian who afterwards  became my mother, and a double-headed nightingale. These, with a woolly horse  and a mermaid, proved sufficiently attractive to the gaping rustics, and drew  many a hardly-earned penny from their pockets. You smile, my lord, at my  recital of so queer a company, but notwithstanding their physical defects, they  were a kindly folk, and amongst them I spent a happy infancy and childhood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  pardon, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; observed Lelanro gently. &ldquo;I did indeed smile, but it was  at the idea of a lad of your parts beginning existence amid such humble  surroundings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  for my education I might have partaken also of their lot,&rdquo; replied Warwick,  with a deprecating smile. &ldquo;I had no claim to a higher position, save in the  imagination of my poor father, who always cherished the dream that he came of a  noble house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lelanro  and Pryce exchanged glances, and the former opened his mouth as if to question  the young man; but altering his mind, he made no remark, and signed to him to  continue his tale. Ignorant of this by-play, Warwick, whose eyes were fixed on  the ground, resumed his speech in a low tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father was a dwarf, similar in all respects to Miss Lelanro. Of the same  stature, he was, like her, beautifully formed, and very handsome in appearance.  His intelligence was remarkably acute, and as Autolycus, who was somewhat  dull-witted, consulted him frequently on business, the dwarf Algernon became a  person of great importance in the little community. He received an excellent  salary, both by reason of his attraction as a freak and his capability as an  adviser to the manager. Being of an economical nature, though, indeed, there  was nothing upon which one so cut off from humanity could spend money, he saved  his salary, and in the course of fifteen or twenty years he became fairly rich  for his position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How,  then, does it happen that his son is poor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  accumulation of those years was spent on my education, Lord Lelanro; and  furthermore, my mother, who was fond of dress, squandered a great deal of the  hoard in decking herself out in silks and satins and jewellery. She was, as I  have before stated, the Fair Circassian, a singularly handsome woman, proud of  her beauty, and vain in dressing herself out to the best advantage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  that we see the son,&rdquo; said Pryce softly, &ldquo;I can well understand that the mother  was beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  flushed at the compliment, and, without reply, he resumed his story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Originally  the daughter of a well-to-do farmer, she had wearied early of a dull existence  in a Midland county, and had joined the show of Autolycus to exhibit her  beauty, of which she was inordinately vain. Algernon, the dwarf, fell in love  with her, and she, knowing him to be rich for his position, married him, but  did not long enjoy the fortune for which she had sacrificed herself by wedding  with an abnormal creature. Within two years I was born in the town of Warwick,  and there, shortly after my birth, my mother died of puerperal fever. She was  buried there, and I was given my father&rsquo;s name and that of the town wherein I  first saw light. Hence you see, my lord, I am called Algernon Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I  understand; but what of your early childhood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Autolycus  had hoped that I would turn out to be a dwarf, and add to the attractions of  his show; but by some freak of Nature, as strange as that which begot my  manikin of a father, I grew tall and strong-limbed, and took after my mother  rather than after my sire. He said often that I greatly resembled her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Warwick made this remark with a sigh, Lelanro requested him to bend nearer the  lamp, and, when he did so, examined his face long and earnestly. Warwick was  rather embarrassed by this scrutiny, and was relieved when the old lord waved  him back to his former position. It was not till many weeks afterwards that he  learned the reason for this apparently irrelevant action.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  childhood was passed amongst the freaks,&rdquo; he continued hastily, &ldquo;and there I  learned to play the violin, and to all appearance I was doomed to lead no other  life than that of a minstrel to the show. But Autolycus was, as I have said, a  shrewd and kindly creature, and seeing that I was quick and intelligent, he  suggested to my father that I should be given a chance of improving my  condition by being educated at a public school. Algernon, the dwarf, eagerly  grasped at the idea, and by the aid of a gentleman of Reading, who had been  attracted by his clever brain, he succeeded in placing me at the Bedford  Grammar School. In the town of Bunyan I spent ten years of my life without  seeing my father. No one knew that I was the son of a dwarf, and even at the  age of ten years I had sufficient discretion to keep silence on that point. Indeed,  as the years passed I almost forgot the strange circumstances of my early life,  and looked upon them as the fantasy of a dream. Only when I was summoned to the  death-bed of my father, at the age of twenty, did I recognize that the dream  was a sad reality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  father died two years ago, then,&rdquo; said Lelanro thoughtfully, &ldquo;for, if I do not  forget, you told me you were now twenty-two years of age.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  my lord. Two years since I was called to Canterbury, and there I found my  father on the point of death. He informed me that all the money he had saved  had gone in my education, and that I would have to shift for myself in the  world. Still believing in his gentle birth, he advised me to seek out the man  whom he recollected as his earliest friend, and ask him if he knew anything of  the matter. I promised to do this, and when my father died I set out to find  Ballard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  find whom?&rdquo; cried Lelanro, starting from his seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ballard,  my lord. The friend of whom my father spoke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lelanro  sank back in his chair with so pale a face that Pryce hastily left the room,  and returned with a glass of wine. This somewhat revived the old gentleman, and  he recovered his speech and self-control, pleading in excuse for the loss of  the same, the recurrence of a memory in connection with the name. This clumsy  excuse did not satisfy Warwick, and he looked steadily at Lelanro as though to  read his thoughts. But the face, inscrutable as a mask from long experience,  baffled him, and he was forced to give up the attempt. Lelanro smiled faintly  as he noticed the youth&rsquo;s desire.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page073.jpg" width="574" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  cannot read my countenance, Mr. Warwick, for all your cunning,&rdquo; said he grimly.  &ldquo;A long life as an ambassador has taught me to control my feelings and  expression in the presence of the acutest diplomatists of Europe. I am not  Mistress Sally, to be read like a book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon, my lord,&rdquo; said Warwick, with some confusion. &ldquo;I had no right  to be so bold; but an idea crossed my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind your idea, sir!&rdquo; said Lelanro sharply. &ldquo;Go on with your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no more to tell, my lord. I went to London and sought Ballard at the address  given by my father; but he had gone abroad, and was not expected to return for  many months. As I had no friend in the world save Autolycus, and no means of  earning bread except by my fiddle, I returned to Canterbury, and there followed  the show for close on two years, playing in front of the booth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  your education, sir, that was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  could I do, my lord? I am well educated, it is true; but I have not a friend in  the world, and without help I could not procure a situation,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  school-fellows&mdash;your masters at Bedford&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  lord, I did not wish to apply to them for charity,&rdquo; replied Warwick proudly. &ldquo;I  should have been forced to tell them my story, and your lordship may guess how  painful that would have been to me. No, my lord. I earned my bread honestly by  my fiddling; and a month ago, thinking Ballard had probably returned, I left  Autolycus at Salisbury, and took my way to London. Three weeks later I came to  Dalesford, and your lordship knows the rest of my story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a strange story&mdash;a very remarkable tale,&rdquo; said Lelanro, who was again on his  feet, pacing the study. &ldquo;And you have no means whereby to discover whence your  father came?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  this paper with the name Algernon and the date of his birth. I may add that,  from what I know of my own age, the date is wrong by a decade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  it to me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  seemed to Warwick that, while his host examined the paper, Dr. Pryce watched  him somewhat anxiously, and appeared to be relieved when it was returned  without comment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think of the story, doctor?&rdquo; asked Lelanro abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with your lordship that it is a remarkable tale,&rdquo; answered Pryce  diplomatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may prove to be still more remarkable, for all we know,&rdquo; muttered Lelanro  thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>He  resumed his walk, while Warwick, wondering what would be the termination of  this strange interview, waited mutely to be addressed. Twice or thrice Lelanro  paused beside him, and then walked to the other end of the room, considering,  as was evident from his thoughtful expression, what would be the wisest course  to take under the circumstances.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are well educated, you say, Mr. Warwick?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I may say so, my lord,&rdquo; replied the youth modestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is your opinion, Pryce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is excellently educated, my lord, as I have had the opportunity of observing  within the last three weeks. A good classical scholar, well read in English,  conversant with the French tongue and literature, and fairly good in  mathematics.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  writes a good hand, Pryce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clear  and legible, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  Well, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; he added, turning to the expectant youth, &ldquo;you say you have  no friend in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  one&mdash;save Autolycus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I presume you are not averse to earning a decent wage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should be thankful to do so, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Mr. Warwick, I have taken a great fancy to you,&rdquo; said Lelanro genially; &ldquo;you  have told a straightforward and direct story, and you seem to be a lad of good  moral principles. Now I require a secretary; would you be willing to undertake  the duties?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  they are not beyond me, my lord, I should be honoured,&rdquo; replied Warwick, hardly  crediting his good fortune.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  a lad of your parts will find them easy, Mr. Warwick. I shall treat you as one  of the family, and introduce you to my grand-daughter, Miss Lelanro. You must  see about clothes and such-like things. To-morrow I shall speak of your wages  and duties; and, of course, Mr. Warwick, from this moment you are free to go  where you will. I need not request your silence on a certain subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not open my mouth on it, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  I see that I can rely on your discretion. But do not neglect my poor sister,  Mr. Warwick. She has few pleasures, poor little soul, and your music is a great  delight to her. Now, good-night, sir! To-morrow we will speak further of these  matters. Good-night again. I am delighted at having made your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  this kindly speech Lelanro shook Warwick heartily by the hand, and forthwith  left the apartment. Overcome by the thought of his good fortune, Warwick looked  after his retiring benefactor with humid eyes, and at length turned towards Dr.  Pryce, who was watching him keenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo;  he said in a trembling voice, &ldquo;you do not know what such kindness means to a  vagabond like me. I hope I may in some measure repay such uncalled-for  generosity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure you will, my dear lad,&rdquo; replied Pryce, patting him kindly on the  shoulder. &ldquo;From what I have seen of you, no one better deserves good fortune.  It lies in your own hands to make or mar. See that you make a good use of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust I shall,&rdquo; exclaimed Warwick fervently. &ldquo;But why is Lord Lelanro so kind  to a stranger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Pryce looked oddly at him, and replied with great conviction, qualified by a  certain reserve:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Mr. Warwick, as I said before, Lord Lelanro is one who never acts without  a reason. Depend upon it, he has an excellent motive for making you his  secretary, and in treating you as one of the family. Now, go and sleep on your  good luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_X"></a>Chapter X<br>
    Celia</b></h2>
  <p>OBSERVANT  of the unaccountable results of circumstance, of the capricious mutations of  existence, the Greeks, with a certain grim irony, symbolized such whimseys by  the figure of a woman poised on a twirling wheel. To the variability of the sex  they ascribed the apparently aimless selection of particular human beings, to  be raised or abased independent of merit or justice; by the ever-revolving  wheel they indicated the constant change which renders life an eternal  succession of unforeseen surprises. Nay, further to accentuate the hopelessness  of finding a reason for such fluctuation, they blinded the eyes of the woman  with a bandage. Here we have the ironic Trinity of Caprice; unreliable  temperament, helpless blindness, unstable position; and these, irresponsible,  shifty, whimsical, rule the world of mankind.</p>
  <p>By  such speculations did Warwick seek to account for the extraordinary change in  his fortunes; for in no logical way could he come to any reasonable conclusion.  He had arrived at Dalesford a fiddling tramp, nameless, friendless, penniless;  through the indulgence of an unwarrantable curiosity, he had narrowly escaped  death by drowning; and he had intruded himself where he was not wanted. All  these things pointed to punishment and disgrace; yet, in direct opposition to  their promise, they brought him an honourable position, a decent wage, and  several firm friends. It was little wonder, then, that he should abandon as  hopeless the solution of so hard a riddle, and place such untoward results to  the credit of the irresponsible Greek deity aforementioned.</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding  that Pryce assured him that Lord Lelanro had a sufficient reason for acting so  kindly, Warwick marvelled greatly at the favour which was shown to him.  Permitted to leave the special portion of the house inhabited by the dwarf and  her attendants, he was installed in a comfortable suite of apartments near  those of his host. In a few days a tailor arrived from London, who provided him  with all necessaries in the way of garments; and for the first time for two  years Warwick found himself clothed in accordance with his rather fastidious  requirements. He dined and spent the evening regularly with Lelanro, he  constantly accompanied the old gentleman in his walks, and when he was minded  to ride, found a horse placed at his disposal. In every way he was treated with  the greatest delicacy and consideration; so that daily his wonder grew as to  what could be the reason of this inexplicable kindliness. Had he been a young  gentleman of great estate he could not have fared better, or have received more  courtesy from the gentry, more respect from the servants. But for the actuality  of his surroundings he would have deemed it a dream.</p>
  <p>Then  again, he soon perceived that his duties were merely nominal; for with the  exception of replying to Lelanro&rsquo;s correspondents, a duty which scarcely  occupied two hours, he had the rest of the day to himself. With such leisure on  his hands he either walked and conversed with his patron, played the violin to  Madam Tot, or rode with Celia Lelanro.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page081.jpg" width="490" height="750"></p>
  <p>Ah!  she was indeed a goddess, worthy of the adoration of two-and-twenty; from the  first moment that he made his bow to her, Warwick surrendered himself a willing  captive to the glance of her blue eyes, to the fascination of her smile. But  two years younger than himself, she was infinitely his elder in knowledge of  the heart by virtue of her sex, and treated him in a sisterly manner, which  perplexed the lad in no small degree. Notwithstanding his good looks and  numberless opportunities, Warwick, by reason of his romantic temperament, knew  but little of the other sex. His ardent nature dowered woman with the  attributes of a goddess; and when he found no one who came up to so high an  ideal, he withdrew himself from contact with the actual being and worshipped an  abstract creature composite of perfections. In Celia Lelanro he found this  dream woman, incarnate in as pretty a mask of flesh as ever was worn by one of  Eve&rsquo;s daughters.</p>
  <p>In  contrast to Warwick&rsquo;s swart complexion and dark hair, she was blue-eyed, with  locks of a russet-brown. In no degree had the faery curse fallen on Celia  Lelanro, for she was as tall for a woman as he was for a man. Her oval face,  and skin of mixed red and white, seemed to the amorous lad the perfection of  beauty; and though he could have wished that her smiles were more frequent, and  her eyes more alight with merriment, yet he could recall no woman of high or  low degree who so strongly moved his heart-strings. The quaint delicacy of the  name &ldquo;Celia&rdquo; suited her well; and Warwick, snared by her charms, berhymed her  looks as earnestly and prodigally as ever Orlando did the sweet smiles of  Rosalind in the Forest of Arden. Having regard to quantity rather than quality,  Celia was as celebrated in verse as ever was Lalage, or Beatrice, or even the  belauded lady of Petrarch.</p>
  <p>In  the principal library of the Manor House, which was distinct from that occupied  by Dr. Pryce, Celia discovered a copy of verses incautiously left on the table  by the lovesick swain. With many a pretty blush and pouting laugh, the goddess  read the effusion composed in her honour, and highly approved of the mediocre  verse; perhaps because she was the subject of the song.</p>
  <p>It  was while she was reading the verses for the second time that Lord Lelanro  entered the room. Seeing her smiles, he stepped softly behind her, and caught a  glimpse of the poem.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  have we here, child? Some amatory nonsense?&rdquo; said he genially, &ldquo;and in the  handwriting of Mr. Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  grandpapa,&rdquo; replied Celia in some confusion, &ldquo;it is merely a copy of verses I  found on your table. They are addressed &lsquo;To Celia.&rsquo; I think,&rdquo; added Miss  Lelanro, laughing, &ldquo;that your new secretary is a poet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a musician&mdash;and a lover, if these rhymes speak from the heart. You must not  encourage him in such folly, child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Celia  was too astonished to reply immediately. She knew her grandfather to be one of  the proudest of men, and that he should jest on so distasteful a subject  surprised her not a little. And, indeed, she was slightly angered at the  presumption that she would condescend to encourage a penniless dependent in  such folly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  assure you, sir, that I never gave the matter a thought,&rdquo; she answered, with  curling lip. &ldquo;I regard Mr. Warwick as I do the other servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  speak harshly, Celia,&rdquo; returned her grandfather in a vexed tone. &ldquo;Mr. Warwick  has good blood in his veins, and with his talents he may rise to great things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope he may; but as to his good blood I am not so certain. By his own  confession he is a wandering musician.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  his own confession he does not know who he is, child. I wish I could find out,  for I assure you I am deeply interested in his welfare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  some emotion he walked to the window, and looked out on the park, which rolled  a sea of green almost to the verge of the terrace. The sky, delicately blue,  was dappled with summer clouds, and in the distance the square grey tower of  Dalesford Church bulked above the undulating line of the trees. The sight of so  fair a heritage suggested to Lelanro&rsquo;s mind the bitter thought that it must  pass soon from his direct line into the hands of an unloved relative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless!  unless!&rdquo; he muttered anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  what, grandpapa?&rdquo; asked Celia, rather astonished at this unusual perturbation. &ldquo;What  are you talking of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  child, nothing! I was thinking of matters pertaining to the welfare of our  family. By the way, Celia,&rdquo; he added, smoothing the frown from his brow, &ldquo;I  received a letter from Edgar Winyard, who asks if he may come down here for a  few weeks. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can I say?&rdquo; said Miss Lelanro, arching her brows. &ldquo;It is for you to decide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  this instance I should prefer your opinion, child. You cannot be ignorant of  Edgar&rsquo;s reason for wishing to pay this visit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not pretend to be ignorant, grandpapa. But as I have rejected him twice, I  think he should have more dignity than to persist in paying his addresses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  he is young and handsome, Celia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a bore,&rdquo; retorted the angry young lady, &ldquo;in spite of his good birth and  kinship with the Lelanros; he is a clodhopper who only cares for dogs and  horses. Tony Lumpkin and Bob Acres in one. Mr. Warwick is worth a dozen of such  as he.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  Mr. Warwick is my dependent,&rdquo; said her grandfather, with faint sarcasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  a gentleman for all that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  denied that a few minutes ago, Celia. But let us not talk of my secretary; it  is your cousin with whom we have to do. I shall invite him to the Manor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  persecute me, then,&rdquo; replied Celia crossly. &ldquo;Surely you do not wish me to marry  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  leave that to yourself,&rdquo; replied Lelanro delicately; &ldquo;but remember that at my  death Edgar becomes Lord Lelanro, and enters into possession of our estates.  You cannot but be aware of the advantage of listening to his suit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t marry him if he were King of England,&rdquo; retorted Miss Lelanro  decisively. &ldquo;Ask him if you will; but don&rsquo;t expect me to encourage him. Heir to  our estates, indeed! Oh, dear, I wish I had been born a boy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would have been better, certainly,&rdquo; replied the old lord, thinking of his dead  son; &ldquo;with your poor father died the chance of keeping the title and estates in  the direct line. Now they must go to Edgar, unworthy though he  be&mdash;unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  what, grandpapa? That is the second time you have used the word,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind, child! Leave me for a time, and ask Mr. Warwick to come here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Celia,  with great disdain, was about to refuse this commission, when Warwick  unexpectedly entered the room. Thereupon she swept out of the apartment, and in  passing flashed on him so indignant a glance that, struck to the heart, he  turned pale. At their last meeting she had been particularly kind, and, not  having offended her in the interval, he was greatly perplexed and pained by  this sudden change of front. Accustomed, however, to bridle his feelings, he  merely bowed as she passed through the door, and advanced gravely to where  Lelanro was seated at his desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was just wishing to see you, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; said the old gentleman kindly, &ldquo;to  tell you that my kinsman and heir, Mr. Edgar Winyard, is coming to stay with us  next week. I hope you and he will be friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  bowed without speaking, and marvelled again that Lelanro should show such  consideration for one who was but a dependent on his charity. He had little  time for reflection, however, as the next remark made by his patron turned his  thoughts in another direction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have often talked of your early life within the last few weeks, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo;  said Lord Lelanro reflectively, &ldquo;and I have several times been on the point of asking  you if you know the address of Autolycus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can learn easily, my lord. He makes Canterbury his headquarters, and a letter  addressed there will find him. Does your lordship wish to see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do; for reasons which I need not communicate to you at present. Will you,  therefore, be kind enough to ask him to call here, and grant me a personal  interview?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  my lord,&rdquo; replied Warwick, wondering at the oddity of the request. &ldquo;Shall I  write at once?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you please, Mr. Warwick. And I should take it as a favour if you would post the  letter yourself in the Dalesford office. I have a reason for not wishing it to  pass through the hands of the servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will attend to it at once,&rdquo; answered the secretary, and forthwith left the  room, with a puzzled look on his face. Lelanro gazed after him in silence, and  not until the door was closed did he speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it be as I think,&rdquo; said he aloud, &ldquo;alas for Edgar Winyard and his hopes!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_XI"></a>Chapter XI<br>
    Alehouse Gossip</b></h2>
  <p>IT  was with some depression of spirits that Warwick set about writing to  Autolycus, as the request of Lord Lelanro had suggested an unpleasant train of  thought. The young man laboured under the disadvantage of a too vivid  imagination, and, notwithstanding that he had evidence to the contrary, he began  to fancy that his patron suspected him of imposture. Else why should he desire  to see Autolycus, with whom he had nothing in common, and why should Celia, who  heretofore had smiled on him, now wrinkle her brow with disdain? On these  grounds Warwick thought that the days of fatness were at an end.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless,  he was satisfied that Autolycus would substantiate his apparently impossible  story on all points, and he had no hesitation in requesting the showman&rsquo;s  presence at the Manor House. Provided that the interview proved  satisfactory&mdash;and Warwick had no fears on that score&mdash;he would be once more  restored to favour. The silly fellow never for a moment reflected that Lelanro  was as kindly as ever, for the single frown of Celia had caused him to look on  all else with a jaundiced vision. But then he was a lover, and as such was  hardly responsible.</p>
  <p>That  Warwick, who did not lack sense, should surrender himself so entirely to Celia  within the short space of three weeks, may seem strange to those who believe  that love is a comfortable feeling born of lengthy companionship. But such  sober folk are wrong in their estimate, which reduces love to a mere domestic  liking. Were it so, Romeo had never loved Juliet; Antony had never been thrall  to Cleopatra; Paris had left Sparta unaccompanied by Helen; for love, the true  love, grows, like Jonah&rsquo;s gourd, in a single night, and of such complexion was  the passion of Warwick for the disdainful Celia. A single glance of her eyes  had laid him low at her feet, and there he struggled a helpless captive to her  charms.</p>
  <p>Love  o&rsquo;erleaps all obstacles, regards as nothing the barriers of caste, the  landmarks of wealth; so Warwick, under the influence of the divinity, already  cherished a mad hope that some day he might marry his angel. He was not yet  satisfied that she returned his devotion; he was aware of his unsatisfactory  position, of his lack of worldly gear, and the precarious nature of his  employment; yet, with the vivid imagination of two-and-twenty, already he saw  himself her husband. He had by this time reached the stage of calling Celia &ldquo;Her,&rdquo;  as though she were the only woman in the world.</p>
  <p>Now  he was informed by Lelanro that a kinsman was coming on the scene. Doubtless,  some handsome London spark, who would win the heart of Celia, and not regard  him, poor dependent as he was, even as a rival. Bitterly did Warwick blame  himself that he had not sought out Ballard and learned what he could of his  birth and position. Should he prove to be heir to a great name or to a wealthy  estate, he might hope to oppose equal worldly advantages to this interloping  Edgar. Then the rivalry between them would be more equable, and it would rest  with the best man to win the prize of Celia&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>When,  therefore, Warwick posted the letter to Autolycus, he repaired to the &ldquo;Lelanro  Arms&rdquo; with the intention of questioning Mistress Sally concerning her namesake  in London. She might be some connection, and, if so, she would know probably if  he had returned from abroad. Nay, more; if she were kin to Ballard of London it  was not unreasonable to suppose that she might know somewhat of his secrets,  and thus afford Warwick the information he needed. All this, however, was  vague, and Warwick halted before the hospitable inn without any clear plan of  action in his head.</p>
  <p>In  the porch stood Mistress Sally, as fair and fat as ever, with cherry-coloured  ribbons to her cap and a broad smile of welcome on her rosy face. Already the  news had reached Dalesford that my lord&rsquo;s new secretary was none other than the  handsome fiddler, and Mistress Sally curtsied to the ground to show her  reverence for Warwick&rsquo;s newly-acquired gentility.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am pleased to see you again, sir,&rdquo; said she, ushering him into a bright little  parlour; &ldquo;will you not try the ale you liked so at your last visit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,  dame,&rdquo; answered Warwick, taking a seat. &ldquo;It was for a chat and a tankard of  that very ale that I came hither. I have not forgotten your kindness, Mistress Sally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;La,  now!&rdquo; cried the gratified landlady; &ldquo;dear heart, ye were as welcome to bit and  sup as the flowers in May! Bide ye here, Master Warwick, and I&rsquo;ll bring ye a  pot of the best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  bustled out of the room, swelling visibly with pride at being so honoured; and  Warwick, left to himself, leaned out of the casement, looking across the  village green at the quaint stone cross. It was but two months since he had  last beheld it; yet within those eight weeks what changes had taken place in  his fortunes! Then he had been a penniless tramp with no prospects, now he had  an assured position and a chance of gaining name and fortune, and it may be,  should matters continue thus prosperous, a charming and high-born wife.</p>
  <p>From  the window he turned to the mantelshelf, drawn thither by that silver-framed  portrait which had excited his curiosity on a former occasion. There she  smiled, sweet and fair, a very angel in a white dress, and with a rapid glance  at the door to see that it was closed, Warwick hastily pressed the portrait to  his lips. As he could not kiss the original there was at least some pleasure in  caressing the counterfeit. He had just time to replace the picture in its  former position when buxom Mistress Sally re-entered with ale and victuals.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  bite of bread and cheese, sir,&rdquo; said she, setting down the tray; &ldquo; &lsquo;tis a long  walk to the Great House, and you a growing lad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think it is time I stopped growing at two-and-twenty, ma&rsquo;am? Sit down,  Mistress Sally, and while I eat, you talk. I remember we so divided the labour  at our last meeting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,  Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; nodded the landlady, taking a chair and placing two plump hands  on her knees. &ldquo;I mind me of that. And now you&rsquo;ve met your friends in London.  Oh. I knew it was your jest, sir, to pass as a fiddler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  laughed, and did not undeceive her. She evidently thought that he had become  acquainted with Lord Lelanro in London, and as he did not wish her to know of  his sojourn in the dwarf&rsquo;s chamber, he held his peace advisedly. Nothing loth,  the garrulous landlady rattled on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  real glad, sir, that you gave over that foolishness. A handsome young gentleman  like you has no need to tramp through rain and mud. But I saw you were of the  gentry the moment I set eyes on your bonny face. Oh, yes, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; added  she, complacently smoothing her apron, &ldquo;I have not lived in the Great House for  nought, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I live there myself, Mistress Sally. It is odd that it should be so. Lord  Lelanro is a kind friend to me, and so is&mdash;Miss Celia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  sweet young lady, is she not, Mr. Warwick? They do say she is to wed with Mr.  Winyard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wed&mdash;wed  with whom?&rdquo; stammered Warwick, turning pale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  heart, the turn you gave me then,&rdquo; replied Mistress Sally, laying a fat hand on  her comfortable bosom. &ldquo;Why, with Mr. Edgar, to be sure, sir. He is her cousin,  and heir to my lord; so the marriage will bring the two lines together. Why,  la, sir, you are as pale as a gooseberry. Just sip the ale, there&rsquo;s a dear man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  news, which confirmed Warwick&rsquo;s worst anticipations, moved him not a little,  and it was with some difficulty that he recovered his self-control. But he knew  that Mistress Sally was inquisitive and a gossip, so, anxious to give her no  opportunity of making mischief, he hastily took a deep draught of ale and  covered his dismay by a forced laugh,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be an excellent match, Mistress Sally,&rdquo; said he, with the colour returning  to his cheeks, &ldquo;and, no doubt, will take place soon. Mr. Winyard comes to the  Manor next week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  there now,&rdquo; smiled the landlady, delighted at the piece of news, &ldquo;if we won&rsquo;t  have a wedding before the year grows older! Though, indeed, sir,&rdquo; she added,  changing her tone, &ldquo;I had rather the groom was yourself than Mr. Edgar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not like him, then?&rdquo; said Warwick, his heart beating violently at hearing  his dearest thoughts put into words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  no, sir,&rdquo; replied Mistress Sally reluctantly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for me to speak against  the family; but Mr. Edgar is not a pleasant gentleman, and the Lelanros have  quite enough trouble without adding more to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively  Warwick knew that she referred to the faery curse and to the dwarfs; but  mindful of his promise to Lelanro, he showed no signs of such knowledge.  Nevertheless, he could not help wondering how Mistress Sally had heard of the  secret, and artfully strove to draw her out on the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  trouble have the Lelanros, Mistress Sally?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  landlady turned away her face and replied in an altered voice&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you live in the Great House, Mr. Warwick, you must be as wise as I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  I am not, dame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it is not for me to speak, sir. A still tongue makes many friends, as the good  parson told us only last Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Seeing  that she was obstinately determined on silence, Warwick tried another method to  extract information. He put into words a thought which had haunted his brain  ever since that momentous interview with Lelanro.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose, Mistress Sally, it is certain that Mr. Winyard will inherit the  estates?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, sir! Why should he not?&rdquo; asked the landlady, with some confusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  Lelanro has no other offspring, I suppose?&rdquo; questioned Warwick, keeping his eye  on her embarrassed face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  son, the Honourable Louis Lelanro, was killed in the hunting-field, sir, and  left Miss Celia. There was no boy of that marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  Louis Lelanro the only son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  heart!&rdquo; cried Mistress Sally, rising from her seat with affected surprise, &ldquo;every  one knows that he was the only son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was an evasive reply capable of being read in two ways. Warwick noted the  ambiguity, but, fearful of letting his own knowledge of the Lelanro secret  escape him, he did not further question the landlady. With a laugh he changed  the conversation, and brought up the topic about which he had called.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  name is Ballard, is it not?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sarah  Ballard, sir, spinster, and landlady of the &lsquo;Lelanro Arms.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you a relative in London?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To  Warwick&rsquo;s surprise the face of the woman went grey, and gasping for breath she  was forced to resume her seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; she said at length, looking inquisitively at Warwick. &ldquo;I had a brother,  Walter Ballard; but he is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;  echoed Warwick, who saw with dismay his cloud-built castles tumbling about his  ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. He died six months ago, in Italy, of the cholera.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  was a blow. The only man who could tell him anything was gone, and now it  seemed hopeless to think that he would be able to learn the secret of his  birth. From these dismal thoughts he was recalled by the voice of the landlady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you know I had a brother in London, sir?&rdquo; asked Mistress Sally sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I heard it at the Manor,&rdquo; replied Warwick after a pause. He did not think it  wise to trust this garrulous old lady with his secret.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  sighed Mistress Sally, with great relief. &ldquo;Maybe. I thought you might have  heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heard  what, dame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  sir. Nothing. My poor brother is dead and gone! What ill he did is buried with  him.&rdquo; With that she left the room, and Warwick, struck by her strange speech,  finished his ale thoughtfully. Evidently she did not wish to talk about her  brother, and from the expression of her face when his name was mentioned,  apparently she retained no pleasant recollections of him. Indeed, it seemed as  though Mistress Sally also had her secret, and was as jealous of its  preservation as were the Lelanros of their own.</p>
  <p>Utterly  bewildered by the attitude of the ordinarily genial landlady, Warwick left the  room to take his leave. In the distance he caught a glimpse of Mistress Sally  with an observant eye, but when he glanced in her direction, she disappeared.  With affected carelessness he slipped out of the inn across the green, and  again noted the cherry-coloured ribbons at the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  avoids me; she watches me,&rdquo; he thought, walking briskly homeward. &ldquo;On what  fresh mystery have I stumbled? I shall tell all to Pryce and ask his counsel.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_XII"></a>Chapter XII<br>
    Consulting The Wise Woman</b></h2>
  <p>BAFFLED  by the reticence of Mistress Sally, and dismayed by the intelligence of her  brother&rsquo;s death, Warwick returned to the Manor in no pleasant frame of mind.  Ballard, so far as he knew, was the only person who could enlighten him as to  the birth of his father; and now that his decease had put an end to obtaining  information in that quarter, Warwick saw nothing for it but to take up a  quiescent attitude. Yet the idea of remaining under a cloud all his life was so  repellent to his active brain that he made a final effort to arrive at the  truth.</p>
  <p>With  this idea he repaired to the dwarfs chamber the morning after his futile visit  to the inn, and endeavoured to ingratiate himself with Madam Tot, in the hope  that she would assist him to unravel the riddle of name and date. Therein,  according to his father, was concealed the name of the family whence he sprang,  and Warwick hoped that the dwarf&rsquo;s ingenuity might be exercised to some  purpose. She alone could aid him at this juncture.</p>
  <p>Rather  to his surprise Madam Tot received him with cold dignity, and declared plainly  that he had neglected her of late. Her grand-niece Celia was in the garden  also&mdash;for Madam Tot had left her room to sun herself, as was her custom&mdash;and to  Celia did the little lady address her observations, though the gist of them was  directed at Warwick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, my love,&rdquo; said the malicious little creature, &ldquo;I am of no consequence now.  A certain person can dispense with the company of one who nursed him back to  health and strength.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  assure you, Madam Tot,&rdquo; began Warwick; but could proceed no further, for he was  at once rebuked for his familiarity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am Miss Lelanro, Mr. Warwick; I beg of you to recollect that on all occasions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid you are out of favour,&rdquo; said Celia, stifling a laugh. &ldquo;What have you  been doing to so offend my great-aunt, Mr. Warwick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has been doing nothing, Celia,&rdquo; interposed Madam Tot, standing on tip-toe to  add to her dignity. &ldquo;I say nothing about Mr. Warwick or his behaviour. Oh dear,  no! I speak of a certain person who knows I am devoted to music, yet will not  bring his violin when asked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have my violin with me now,&rdquo; said Warwick, with a comically penitent expression  of countenance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  a certain person will play on that violin,&rdquo; continued the dwarf, still ignoring  her guest, &ldquo;I may be induced to overlook his rudeness. Otherwise,&rdquo; she added  with a frown, &ldquo;I shall instruct my kinsfolk, the people of peace, to pinch him  black and blue, and run pins into the tender parts of his body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cruel,  cruel aunt,&rdquo; laughed Celia, when Warwick ran off to get his violin, so as to  avert so terrible a doom. &ldquo;Why would you hurt the poor young man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,  my dear! It is necessary to teach him his place. I am afraid your grandfather  spoils him. Remember, love, he is one of the common people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  aunt, you said yourself he was a gentleman,&rdquo; replied Celia, with a sudden  blush.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, my love! His bearing is not plebeian. Still, we know nothing of him or  his.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  doesn&rsquo;t know himself,&rdquo; sighed Miss Lelanro rather regretfully. &ldquo;I wish he did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Evidently  she had quite forgotten the late conversation with her grandfather; or perhaps  she wished to make amends for her late disdainful behaviour. To speak the  truth, Celia was beginning to find that thoughts of Warwick were oftener in her  mind than they had any right to be. In vain she took herself to task for such  folly, and reminded herself of the difference between a young lady of rank and  an unknown foundling. Love, already firmly established in the citadel of her  heart, was not to be driven out by such feeble means; and with secret dismay  Celia felt that in the end she would be forced to surrender to this  rapidly-increasing passion. It was at present a struggle between Love and  Pride, in which the latter was now in the ascendant; but Celia, with some qualms,  admitted to herself that possibly the final victory would rest with the former.</p>
  <p>When  Warwick returned he found his charming mistress reclining on the grass before  the summer-house. Therein sat Madam Tot, like a little jade god, in her green  dress, looking stiff and rigid, with bent brows and pursed-up lips. Not a  glance did she vouchsafe to the offending Warwick; but at his approach she  observed haughtily to Celia that a certain person could play if he were so  minded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Otherwise,&rdquo;  said she crossly, &ldquo;a certain person had better take his departure. I want no  giants here&mdash;no man-mountains and silly monsters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Evidently  the spirit of perversity was instigating Madam Tot to evil on this particular  morning, so Warwick, as the David to her Saul, endeavoured to charm it away  with music. Leaning against the trunk of an elm&mdash;for his weight would have  crushed the fragile summer-house&mdash;he drew the bow across the strings, and  improvised as his fancy directed. Celia, under the shade of her parasol,  reclined on the grass, looking, with pensive face and white dress, like a  snowdrop amid the surrounding green. She was an accomplished musician herself,  and had heard many famous violinists, yet for delicacy of execution and power  of the melodic faculty, she was inclined to award the palm of pre-eminence to  this unknown fiddler. The inclination of her heart may have had something to do  with this generous recognition of unknown talent.</p>

  <p>With  his swarthy face and dark eyes, Warwick was singularly Italian in appearance;  but Celia likened him in her own mind to the second Charles, albeit his  features were less harsh than those of the Merry Monarch. But he had the  Stewart melancholy impressed on his face, and the Stewart grace inherent in his  every action. A singularly poetic figure he looked, dreaming over his violin in  the bright sunshine. Celia confessed to herself that he was the most charming  young man she had yet seen; and then frowned at so weak a confession, even  though it was but a mental one.</p>
  <p>All  she knew of the youth whose looks and deferential gallantry so strangely  stirred her heart, was that he had penetrated by accident into the seclusion of  her dwarfish great-aunt&rsquo;s domain, and that her grandfather, fearful lest the  secret might become common property, had kept him under his eye by making him  his secretary. She was ignorant that Warwick&rsquo;s father was a dwarf who had been  on show in a booth, and quite believed that he was the son of some gentleman,  and had run away from school or college in an excess of high spirits. Such a belief  tended rather to elevate his character in her eyes, for Celia dearly loved a  bold and independent spirit, such as this secretary seemed to possess.  Moreover, he excelled all the well-born young gentlemen she had met in  appearance, in talent, and in dignity. No wonder, then, in taking so romantic  and girlish a view of his personality, she prepared a fertile ground for the  upspringing of the flower of love.</p>
  <p>And  all this time the music rippled and ebbed on the still air with changeful  melody and fitful brilliancy. Madam Tot, her displeasure somewhat abated, now  relaxed the rigidity of her features, and with a tiny cheek on tiny hand sat  looking at the sweeping bow. Celia, her eyes on the daisied sward, mused and  dreamed herself into a dangerous frame of mind. Unexpectedly there broke forth  from the violin a strain of such tenderness and pathetic grace that she  involuntarily looked up to see what had inspired the musician. It was herself;  for Warwick&rsquo;s dark eyes, filled with passion, gazed on her fair face. With a  sudden flush she turned away her head, and at the same moment, fearful lest he  should have betrayed his secret, the musician laid down his instrument.</p>
  <p>The  situation would have been embarrassing to them both but that Madam Tot did away  with the feeling by clapping her tiny hands. She addressed Warwick directly,  and no longer spoke of him as &ldquo;a certain person,&rdquo; whereby he knew that the  capricious faery had taken him again into favour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Charming,  charming!&rdquo; cried the little creature, emerging from her summer-house like a  green butterfly from its chrysalis. &ldquo;You have certainly been trained in the  court band of Oberon. Some night, when the moon is full, we will go&mdash;you and  I&mdash;to the faery ring, and there you must play for the skipping of the elves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I come too, aunt?&rdquo; asked Celia, rousing herself from day-dreams; &ldquo;I should  dearly love to see the good neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear, you are not of us,&rdquo; replied Madam Tot gravely, &ldquo;and therefore you cannot  see our solemnities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  even if I plucked a rowan twig like Sir James?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; but the elves might be vexed at your on-looking. Only those who have faery  blood in their veins can be present. I have reason to think that Mr. Warwick is  of our kin,&rdquo; continued Madam Tot loftily. &ldquo;His father was certainly a changeling  like myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  chance shot was so near the mark, in one sense, that Warwick uttered an  ejaculation of surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that, Madam Tot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know many things,&rdquo; said the dwarf wisely. &ldquo;There are few matters I cannot  solve if I put my mind to them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish, then, that you would put your mind to this,&rdquo; said Warwick, handing her  the paper which contained the riddle. &ldquo;If you could only solve this enigma I  should learn my position in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madam  Tot glanced at the paper with a look of preternatural wisdom, then uttered a  shrill scream expressive of astonishment. Sliding down on to the grass she  devoured the paper with her eyes, glancing sharply the while at Warwick, who  took no care to conceal his astonishment at the effect thus produced. Celia  also exhibited some natural curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter, aunt?&rdquo; said she, leaning forward to get a glimpse of the paper; &ldquo;can  you guess the riddle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell no secrets of faeryland,&rdquo; retorted Madam Tot, putting the paper into her  pocket. &ldquo;When the full moon is on the faery ring I may reveal my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you know what the name and date mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Warwick, a wild thought  crossing his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have an idea,&rdquo; replied the dwarf mysteriously; &ldquo;but the riddle must be  unravelled carefully. Leave it to me, Mr. Warwick. I shall tell you all about  yourself at the full moon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Not  another word could they get out of her on the subject, for with one of her  whims she was determined to surround the matter with faery influence. Warwick,  informed by Pryce of her skill in deciphering cryptograms, assumed that she  found this special one sufficiently easy to solve at the first glance. The  information it conveyed seemed to astonish her considerably; but what it was  she refused to reveal until the moon was at its full. Vexed as he was at her  whimsicality, Warwick was forced to let her take her own way, as she alone  could read the riddle. Nevertheless he could hardly contain his curiosity, and  vainly remonstrated with Madam Tot on the irrational postponement of the  explanation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to know its meaning at once,&rdquo; he said rather angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall know it at the full moon,&rdquo; retorted the dwarf. &ldquo;I am not going to break  with the traditions of faeryland to please a poor mortal like you, even though  you have faery blood in your veins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  he indeed, aunt?&rdquo; asked Celia, humouring her quaint relative, with an indulgent  smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo;  said the little creature mysteriously. &ldquo;I know what I know, my love. We will  talk of other things, if you please. When does the Winyard ogre arrive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next  week, aunt,&rdquo; answered Celia, by no means delighted at the turn thus given to  the conversation. &ldquo;I hope you will be pleased to see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  no, Celia! A horrid, bold, swearing creature, who laughs at my delicate figure.  To think that he should inherit the Lelanro estates!&rdquo; sighed Madam Tot, with an  angry rap of her cane. &ldquo;Oh, if only my poor faery nephew had lived!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean my father,&rdquo; suggested Celia, holding out her hand for Warwick&rsquo;s assistance  to enable her to rise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I did not, child! He was a mortal like yourself, not a changeling like me and  my faery nephew. Ah, that changeling returned to faeryland in a few years,&rdquo;  added Madam Tot sadly, &ldquo;and left me to drag on a weary existence here. Summoned  on particular business by Oberon, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick&rsquo;s  heart beat violently as she made this speech, and the vague fancy which had  been in his brain of late now began to assume a definite shape. Emotion  prevented his immediate speech, and he was glad when Celia asked the question  he wished to have put himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought my father was an only child, aunt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madam  Tot looked at Celia with her sharp little eyes, and shook her head to intimate  that she would say nothing more. Celia pressed the question, whereupon she  became querulous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am tired; I am tired. Carry me into my house,&rdquo; she said crossly, and this Celia  was obliged to do. Taking the little creature in her arms, she walked up the  garden, with a kind nod to Warwick.</p>
  <p>He  leaned against the tree-trunk almost overwhelmed by the flood of light which  had broken on the darkness of his understanding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  faery nephew,&rdquo; he muttered, picking up his violin. &ldquo;Without doubt Celia&rsquo;s  father had a brother, and that brother was a dwarf. A dwarf,&rdquo; he repeated after  a pause. &ldquo;Ah, now I feel that I am on firm ground. I will see what Dr. Pryce  can tell me on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Though  not in the way he expected, the young man had learned from the dwarf news of  vital importance to his future.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_XIII"></a>Chapter XIII<br>
    Dr. Pryce Is Mysterious</b></h2>
  <p>NOT  until the evening did Warwick find an opportunity of conversing with the  doctor, for on the plea of requiring his assistance to arrange some papers,  Lord Lelanro kept him by his side for the greater part of the afternoon. It  seemed to the youth as though his patron desired to acquaint himself with every  turn of his character, to test his knowledge in every way, and to note his  bearing on all occasions. With inquisitive persistence he questioned the young  man of his early life, of his school training, of his ideas regarding the duties  of landowners, and, in fact, he ended by nearly exhausting Warwick&rsquo;s patience  as well as his knowledge. Nevertheless, his gratitude for constant favours  enabled him to bear amiably the trying senility of the old lord, and when  dismissed finally, he received many handsome compliments on his good-humour and  education.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to see that you have a respect for your elders, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; said  Lelanro, with great satisfaction. &ldquo;Believe me, you will lose nothing by  submitting blindly to my guidance. You have not yet heard from Autolycus?&rdquo; he  asked abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  my lord. I expect a letter to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inform  me of its contents without delay, Mr. Warwick. I am anxious to see this  protector of your youth on the earliest possible occasion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I ask, my lord, if it is because you doubt my honesty that you seek an  interview with Autolycus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all, not at all, Mr. Warwick. That my reasons for speaking with Autolycus  are connected with you I do not deny. But you quite misapprehend my opinion of  your character if you think for a moment that I do not implicitly believe all  that you have told me. I should think,&rdquo; added Lelanro, with some reproach, &ldquo;that  my efforts to make your stay pleasant would have interpreted my opinion  correctly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon, my lord,&rdquo; replied Warwick hurriedly. &ldquo;I have no right to ask  questions, as you no doubt are acting for the best. But the poor are ever  suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lelanro  patted the youth&rsquo;s flushed cheek with two wrinkled fingers, and laughed kindly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a few weeks you will understand my motives for acting thus,&rdquo; said he gently; &ldquo;believe  me, I have your welfare at heart. Now you can go, Mr. Warwick, but pray do not  forget to inform me about Autolycus when you hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  dismissed, Warwick bowed and, not without an effort, left the room. He felt  that he was surrounded by mysteries which concerned him closely, and dearly he  would have liked to question his patron. But the attitude of Lelanro indicated  a certain reserve; so Warwick, bridling his curiosity for the moment, sought  the society of Madam Tot, and fiddled away his thoughts till dinner-time.</p>
  <p>During  the meal Lelanro discussed politics, and strove to interest Warwick in the  intricacies of statecraft. The attempt was idle, as, Celia being near him, the  amorous young man had more ear for her musical laugh and frivolous talk than  for all the wisdom of eld. When love is in the heart, ambition is out of the  mind.</p>
  <p>After  dinner Warwick, tearing himself away from the too pleasant society of Celia,  hastened to the study of Dr. Pryce. On the threshold a new surprise awaited  him, for hardly had he reached the door when it opened suddenly, and the buxom  form of Mistress Sally appeared. She was as surprised to see him as he was to  set eyes on her at so late an hour, in so unexpected a position.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  heart,&rdquo; said Mistress Sally, patting her ample bosom with a fat hand, &ldquo;how you  startled me, sir! I have just been to see good Dr. Pryce to ask him about my  health, which, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; concluded the rosy-cheeked landlady, with an  affected sigh, &ldquo;is none of the best, I do assure you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  laughed at the palpable untruth, but nevertheless, having no reasonable excuse  to express his disbelief, he said a few kind words, and entered the study.  Mistress Sally saw the door close, and gazed on it for a few moments with a  bewildered expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it should be so,&rdquo; muttered the landlady to herself, &ldquo;I shall believe Walter  Ballard to have been more fool than knave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  which enigmatic sentence, she proceeded to the housekeeper&rsquo;s room for an hour&rsquo;s  gossip before returning to her snug inn. As was afterwards observed by the  housekeeper, Mistress Sally was singularly distraught during their cosy  conversation.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Warwick was seated near the desk, talking to Dr. Pryce, and trying to elicit  from that astute individual the reason for Mistress Sally&rsquo;s unexpected visit.  The attempt proved a failure, for Pryce was disinclined to make a confidant of  his visitor, and so carefully avoided giving the least information that Warwick  naturally felt a trifle hurt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know why you should withhold your confidence, doctor,&rdquo; said he, biting  his lip. &ldquo;You may be sure that I have a sufficient reason for asking these  questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  may have a sufficient reason for declining an answer, for all you know,&rdquo;  replied Pryce dryly. &ldquo;But if you inform me of your motive, I may be less  reticent. Now, I&rsquo;ll be bound, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; continued the doctor, bending  forward, &ldquo;that of late you have been building castles in the air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not deny it,&rdquo; said the young man, reddening. &ldquo;I am naturally of an observant  disposition, and from certain hints and from noting the actions of those around  me I am inclined to believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you have some claim to belong to the Lelanro family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  yes, doctor,&rdquo; replied Warwick, surprised at this correct interpretation of his  thoughts. &ldquo;I cannot deny that my mind has been busy with such a possibility.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  what grounds do you base this assumption?&rdquo; questioned Pryce calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hardly know how to answer that question. I have really only a vague belief  without much foundation. You know my story, Pryce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  And a very interesting story it is! Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I mentioned, it was not without design that I came to the village of Dalesford.  Ballard,&rdquo; said Warwick, with some emphasis, &ldquo;is not a common name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  no,&rdquo; replied Pryce dubiously, &ldquo;and yet you can hardly say it is uncommon. You  refer to the man in London?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Partly,  and to Mistress Sally also. I have discovered that he was her brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  her brother, Warwick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  He is now dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pryce  expressed no surprise at this intelligence, so that Warwick was more convinced  than ever that Mistress Sally had come on other than medical business to the  Manor. After a pause said the doctor:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  sir! Ballard of London is now dead, and I presume you have given up all thought  of discovering your real name and that of your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  no, Pryce! On the contrary, I have now a reasonable expectation of learning the  truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  I should be glad to know the grounds on which you base those expectations,&rdquo;  said Pryce dryly.</p>
  <p>He  settled himself comfortably in his chair, and looked anxiously at Warwick. The  young man hesitated for a few moments, then with a sudden resolution laid bare  his mind with youthful impetuosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Though,  indeed,&rdquo; said he, with some petulance, &ldquo;I do not rightly see why I should  confide in you, seeing that you hold aloof, and treat me-with suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear lad, I do not treat you with suspicion,&rdquo; cried Pryce, holding out his  hand. &ldquo;And I have a reason for holding aloof! You will learn what it is soon  enough. Meanwhile, let me hear your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  already know most of it,&rdquo; replied Warwick frankly; &ldquo;as I told you, my father  recommended me to seek out this Ballard in London as one likely to aid me in  the search for my family. Before I set off for London for the second time,  Autolycus told me that he had reason to believe that Ballard came from  Dalesford, and advised me to turn aside and see if he was there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  reason had he to believe that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  I cannot say, Pryce! Unless it was that, in one of his peregrinations, he  stayed at the &lsquo;Lelanro Arms,&rsquo; which as you know is kept by Miss Ballard. The  name might suggest a connection. Well, sir,&rdquo; continued Warwick, warming with  his theme, &ldquo;I questioned Mistress Sally and learned but little, yet I  discovered that this Ballard of London&mdash;Walter Ballard&mdash;was her brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  has that to do with the Lelanros?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  my opinion it has a great deal to do with the Lelanros,&rdquo; retorted Warwick, with  some heat. &ldquo;Only to-day Madam Tot, while talking her elfish nonsense, mentioned  incidentally that it was a pity her faery nephew had not lived.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  faery nephew?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know well enough, Pryce, though it pleases you to assume ignorance. I refer to  the brother of the late Louis Lelanro, the father of Miss Celia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t quite follow your argument,&rdquo; said Pryce dryly. &ldquo;However, I will concede,  for the sake of further discussion, that there was a faery nephew, by which, I  suppose, Madam Tot means a dwarf like herself. What then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  then! Can&rsquo;t you see the connection?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I am very stupid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  you are no such thing, Pryce. It is sheer obstinacy on your part. However, I  shall explain my belief. A dwarf was born to Lelanro, and unwilling to  incarcerate another inmate in the secret chamber, he took means to rid himself  of the unfortunate manikin. I believe that this Ballard was given the dwarf to  get rid of. Ballard took the poor creature away, and, I verily believe, sold  him to Autolycus, who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see,&rdquo; interrupted Pryce quietly, &ldquo;you think that your father, the dwarf, was  the son of Lord Lelanro, and that you are the cousin of Miss Celia and the heir  to the title and estates? I congratulate you on your imagination, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you find the idea so very ridiculous?&rdquo; demanded Warwick angrily. &ldquo;I confess I  do not. That a noble family like the Lelanros should have dwarfish children is,  to say the least of it, remarkable. These dwarfs are not monstrosities, but are  perfectly and gracefully formed&mdash;tiny men and women. My father, Algernon, was  the same. He was as handsome a dwarf as Madam Tot. The man who is supposed to  know my history comes from this village; he was, I believe, a confidential  servant of the Lelanros; and further, Madam Tot inadvertently admits that a  dwarf was born to her brother. Now, Dr. Pryce, all these facts make me believe  that I am sprung from none other than the Lelanros. And what is more, I believe  Lord Lelanro knows it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you think so!&rdquo; replied Pryce sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. Else why should he treat me with such unexampled kindness after hearing my  story? I showed him the paper bearing the date of my father&rsquo;s birth, and if  Madam Tot is to be believed, he must have known that he had a dwarf child born  that year. Again, he wishes to see Autolycus; for what reason if not to  question him concerning his purchase of the child from Ballard? With these  facts&mdash;and they are facts&mdash;to go on, can you wonder at my belief that I am really  a Lelanro?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pryce  rose from his seat with an embarrassed smile and took a turn up and down the  room. When he stopped, it was before Warwick, at whom he looked with some  interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a very clever young man, Mr. Warwick, and show an observant and logical  instinct far beyond your years. You should have been a detective, for you have  formed a very feasible case out of&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;  repeated Warwick, springing to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  out of nothing, where is the faery nephew born to Lord Lelanro and referred to  by Madam Tot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall show you,&rdquo; answered Pryce, going to his desk. &ldquo;That a dwarf was born to  Lelanro, I admit. But as to where he is, I can dispose of your doubts in that  direction without much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  saying, he took a key from the desk and motioned to Warwick to follow him.  Incapable of extorting the truth from this obstinate old man, the youth obeyed  in silence, and soon they found themselves in a long, dark passage, at the  farther end of which was a door. This Pryce unlocked, and they issued  immediately into a quadrangle of no very great extent, looking spectral in the  chill moonlight. Here and there on the greensward rose tiny headstones,  glimmering whitely in the cold shine, and Warwick had no need to be informed by  Pryce&rsquo;s next remark as to where he was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,  Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; said the doctor gravely, &ldquo;is the burial-ground of the Lelanro  dwarfs. From the first of those unhappy beings, born in the reign of Charles  Stewart, down to Luke, the dwarfish brother of the present lord, they are all  here laid to rest. After my lord&rsquo;s brother, however, another dwarf was buried  here. You shall see his grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  led the way to the end of the quadrangle and stopped before a small swell of  earth, at the head of which sparkled a white marble stone. In the bright  moonlight Warwick could plainly decipher the inscription, and fell on his knees  the better to discern it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,,&rdquo; said Pryce quietly, &ldquo;that it is erected to the memory of Albert Lelanro,  born in 1847 and died in 1848. Here, Mr. Warwick, lies the dwarfish son of my  lord, through whom you would connect yourself with the Lelanro family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  covered his face with his hands. The downfall of his hopes was complete.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_XIV"></a>Chapter XIV<br>
    The Heir</b></h2>
  <p>SOME  days after that enlightening visit to the dwarfs&rsquo; cemetery, Warwick entered the  library of Lord Lelanro, to find his patron in close conversation with a  stranger. This gentleman, young and prepossessing in appearance, he rightly  guessed to be Mr. Winyard, the kinsman and heir of the old nobleman. Conversant  with the fact that he was also a suitor for the hand of Celia, it was difficult  for Warwick to rid his mind of a certain unfounded prejudice, and to rightly  judge the new-comer. No man, however broad-minded he may be, is sufficiently  generous to look impartially on his rival&rsquo;s mental qualifications and physical  advantages. Warwick was only human after all, and, naturally enough, he was not  ready to admit in Winyard&rsquo;s bearing and speech any superiority to his own.</p>
  <p>Strictly  speaking, the advantage lay with himself, for he possessed an aristocracy of  looks which was absent in his rival. Well-born though Winyard assuredly was,  yet there must have been some plebeian strain in his family, for in appearance  and conversation and thought a certain coarseness was apparent, which could not  fail to be repellent to one so fastidious as Lelanro. Winyard seemed aware of  the barrier between them, for he was ill at ease in the presence of his  kinsman, although, by assuming a bluff, frank air, he tried to hide his obvious  nervousness. Warwick, who was preternaturally sharp in divining character, had  little difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that of all men Edgar Winyard  would be the type most obnoxious to his patron.</p>
  <p>Outwardly  the man was sufficiently well-looking. His figure, though bulky, was good, and  not burdened with superfluous flesh; his head, well set on his broad shoulders,  was covered with crisp yellow hair, and he owned a pair of apparently frank  blue eyes, rather belied by the sullen expression of a thin-lipped mouth. Yet  as this latter defect was hidden under a drooping moustache of a straw colour,  many people, misled by unabashed eyes and bluff manners, assumed Winyard to be  a rough, genial creature, a trifle unpolished, but honest to the core. Those  who held this opinion invariably changed it on further acquaintance.</p>
  <p>That  he was what is known as a &ldquo;horsey man&rdquo; could be guessed from his attire, which,  though sufficiently subdued for good breeding, betrayed, in an indefinable way,  the tastes of him who elected to wear it. Moreover, he had a way of straddling  his legs when standing, which reminded Warwick of a groom, and he could not  help thinking that the heir to the Lelanro title would have been more at home  in a stable-yard than in a library. At the first sight, perhaps unjustly, he  disliked the man; for the poles were not further asunder than were the idiosyncrasies  of this individual and himself. Time and a closer acquaintance only confirmed  the first impression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in, come in, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; said Lelanro, with an air of relief, &ldquo;Do you wish to  see me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  lord, this letter from Autolycus,&rdquo; replied Warwick, placing it in the hand of  his patron.</p>
  <p>Lelanro  seized it eagerly, but, with instinctive courtesy, introduced the young men to  one another before looking at it, although he was most anxious to lose no time  in making himself master of the contents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edgar,  this is my new secretary, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; said he, laying his hand on the youth&rsquo;s  shoulder, &ldquo;and this, Mr. Warwick, is my kinsman, Mr. Winyard, who will give us  the pleasure of his company for a week or so. You will excuse me if I leave you  to improve your acquaintance, as I wish to read this letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  saying he withdrew to the window of the library, where the light fell  strongest, and adjusting his pince-nez, carefully scanned the letter. Left to  their own devices, the rivals looked at one another, and by their stiff bearing  intimated that the introduction was a pleasure to neither. Warwick quietly  bowed, and waited for the visitor to speak, which he did almost immediately in  a most offensive manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you are my cousin&rsquo;s new secretary,&rdquo; said he, looking Warwick up and down as  though he were a horse. &ldquo;He is always picking up some new prot&eacute;g&eacute;. In nine  cases out of ten his swans turn out geese.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust I may prove the tenth, Mr. Winyard,&rdquo; replied Warwick, chafing at this  speech. &ldquo;I would indeed be ungrateful did I not repay Lord Lelanro&rsquo;s kindness  by all the means at my command.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you ride?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so! Lord Lelanro has kindly placed a horse at my disposal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  deuce he has!&rdquo; retorted Winyard, and turned insolently away with a muttered  remark about a beggar on horseback. Warwick caught the drift though not the  exact words, and clenched his hands to prevent himself speaking. For the moment  he was sorely inclined to retort sharply, but fortunately Lord Lelanro called  him to his side before he lost all command of his feelings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see by this letter that Autolycus is coming here next week,&rdquo; said Lelanro, who  looked pleased. &ldquo;I am obliged to him for his promptitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Autolycus?&rdquo; asked Edgar, with a yawn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  person whom I desire to see on business,&rdquo; answered Lelanro, annoyed at his  kinsman&rsquo;s want of tact. &ldquo;I think you will find Celia in the garden, Edgar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks.  I&rsquo;ll see if she&rsquo;ll come out riding with me. I suppose your secretary has to  attend to his duties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Warwick will stay with me, Edgar. I have a few words to say to him touching  this letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  bowed and retreated to a distant corner of the library, where he did his best  to control his anger at the insolent tone of Winyard. Marking his discomposure,  and easily recognizing the cause, Lelanro tapped his cousin on the shoulder as  he was stepping out on to the terrace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you will be friends with Warwick,&rdquo; said he politely, &ldquo;he is a young  gentleman of great promise and no mean intellectual acquirements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care for making friends of servants, Lord Lelanro.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Warwick is not a servant,&rdquo; retorted the old lord loftily; &ldquo;he is as well-born  as you or I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may be,&rdquo; replied Edgar, nettled by the reproof, &ldquo;but he seems far too  independent for his position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think so,&rdquo; said Lelanro dryly, &ldquo;and I am the best judge of such things.  I would advise you to be friendly with him, Edgar. It may be to your advantage  in the future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Winyard  walked slowly along the terrace with these significant words ringing in his  ears. He could not understand their meaning, as, confident of his heirship to  the Lelanro estates, he saw no reason why the friendship of a penniless  dependent should be advantageous to him. Yet there was a meaning in his cousin&rsquo;s  speech, which rather disquieted him, and he sought in vain for the reason which  could have induced their utterance. At what conclusion he would have arrived is  impossible to say, but for the moment his cogitations were put an end to by the  glimpse he caught of his cousin. She was walking across the lawn, clad in a  white dress suited to the heat of the day, and smiled under a pink sunshade  which imparted a rosy hue to her delicate complexion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you do, Edgar?&rdquo; said she, holding out her hand. &ldquo;I am glad to see you,  cousin. You are looking well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  as well as a man can be who has lost some thousands of late,&rdquo; replied the young  man moodily. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come down here to retrench a bit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Miss Lelanro, raising her eyebrows, &ldquo;then you did not come to see me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know I&rsquo;d go to the end of the world to see you, Celia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure of that, Edgar&mdash;if a horse-race did not detain you. How do you think my  grandfather is looking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;s in capital health. I believe he&rsquo;ll live for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope and trust he will,&rdquo; retorted Celia, with a flash of her bright eyes. &ldquo;You  seem to grudge him a long life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Edgar  did indeed grudge him a long life, as he was anxious to enjoy the title, and  finger the revenues of the estates as speedily as possible. But brutal as he  was, shame made him protest against the construction placed on his speech by  his quick-witted cousin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  I do not,&rdquo; he protested good-humouredly. &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll live to the age of  Methuselah. By the way, who is this young cub whom he calls his secretary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Warwick is not a young cub, Edgar, but a very charming young gentleman. He has  been my grandfather&rsquo;s secretary for over a month, and we all like him very  much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yourself  among the number, I suppose,&rdquo; muttered Edgar jealously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course! Why should I not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  too good-looking for a secretary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so. I can&rsquo;t bear ugly people&mdash;or cross people,&rdquo; added Celia, with a  swift glance at the scowl on her cousin&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Come, Edgar, do not let us  quarrel on the first day of your arrival.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no wish to quarrel, Celia. You know that your slightest wish is law to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  Then it is my wish that you behave in a friendly fashion to Mr. Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I? He is an insolent young beggar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry to hear it. And his insolence consists in what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s not what he says,&rdquo; fumed Edgar, &ldquo;the fellow is civil enough, but he looks  in such a high-and-mighty manner that there is no bearing him. One glance is  enough for me. I shall never like him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, I like him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see that,&rdquo; said Edgar sharply, &ldquo;and that is one of my reasons for objecting to  his presence in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think we had better leave the subject alone,&rdquo; said Celia, with great dignity, &ldquo;the  more so as we are not likely to agree upon it. Let us converse on other  matters. Madam Tot, for instance! Have you seen her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  Nor do I want to; the frightful little monster!&rdquo; Clearly Winyard was in too bad  a temper to measure his words, so Celia, who had experienced his rough humour  on former occasions, was in no mood to put up with a repetition. She therefore  withdrew herself from his society.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will be better by yourself, Edgar,&rdquo; said she, turning her back on the  discomfited young man, &ldquo;and though you despise Mr. Warwick as a servant, you  could do worse than take a lesson in breeding from him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  profuse apologies Edgar tried to detain her, but Celia, who was not easily  moved when she had once made up her mind, refused to remain longer in his  company, and walked haughtily away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confound  the fellow!&rdquo; growled Winyard, looking after the retreating form, &ldquo;he seems to  have bewitched them all. First Lelanro, now Celia, and I dare say that little  horror of a dwarf is as mad over him as the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was of two minds to seek out Warwick, and fasten a quarrel on him, but as he  had reasons, not unconnected with a loan of money, for keeping on good terms  with Lelanro, he decided not to raise the old gentleman&rsquo;s anger by annoying his  prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Disgusted at the caution he was forced to observe, Edgar strolled  round to the stables and passed the afternoon in the congenial society of the  grooms.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_XV"></a>Chapter XV<br>
    Bottom And Titania</b></h2>
  <p>FULL  justice has not been done to the character of Madam Tot, who, elfish creature  as she was, possessed a larger share of shrewdness than usually falls to the  lot of a full-sized human being. She was quick in seeing the good and bad  points of those with whom she came into contact; and, considering her very  limited experience of the world, she was an excellent judge of human nature. To  Warwick she took instinctively, as the kindly disposition and romantic  inclinations of the youth were quite in harmony with her own character; and,  moreover, his mastery of the violin was a powerful factor in securing her  regard. He was always ready to amuse her, and humour her whims, so that the  little creature soon became fondly attached to one possessed of so many  qualifications for winning her regard.</p>
  <p>Towards  Winyard, on the other hand, Madam Tot conducted herself with the utmost  haughtiness, and was more frank than pleasant in her speeches. The mere idea  that he was to succeed her brother, and become master of the Manor House, threw  her into fits of anger which incapacitated her for days. The little woman was  highly neurotic, and trifles, which would have hardly disturbed a strong-nerved  person, roused her to frenzy. Winyard, who was as earthy a creature as could be  met with, offended her greatly by his want of tact and his coarse jokes on her  infirmities. Consequently she requested her brother not to let him visit her  portion of the house when staying at the Manor; and Winyard had not set eyes on  the manikin for over three years.</p>
  <p>It  was therefore with some surprise that Celia, who knew her great-aunt&rsquo;s aversion  to the young man, was requested by Madam Tot to bring Winyard to see her that  afternoon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will only make you ill,&rdquo; expostulated Celia gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no! oh, dear, dear, no,&rdquo; replied Madam Tot, with shrill disdain; &ldquo;not now, my  love. Once upon a time such would have been the case, no doubt, but now I can  afford to laugh at his rudeness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  so, more than on former occasions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Celia,  you are asking me to betray the secrets of the good people,&rdquo; said the dwarf in  a tone of reproof. &ldquo;Not until the moon is full am I permitted to reveal that  which I know. Then, my love, you will see Edgar&mdash;the coarse creature&mdash;tumbled  down from his high estate. Oh, yes; I know what I know. The peaceful neighbours  are not to be insulted with impunity, child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Out  of all this jargon Celia could extract no sense, and as Madam Tot declined to  be more explicit, she was forced to depart in search of Edgar in a very puzzled  frame of mind. Why Madam Tot should desire to see one whom she professed to  dislike it was difficult to say; but in making the request she evidently had  some purpose which was inimical to Winyard. The dwarf had a great deal of  maliciousness in her character, and when provoked by any one, as in the present  instance, she would make herself uncommonly disagreeable. Celia foresaw that  Edgar would have a bad quarter of an hour should he accept the invitation.</p>
  <p>Winyard  expressed himself quite ready to do so, but made so many contemptuous remarks  concerning the unfortunate little being, that Celia, who was strongly attached  to her great-aunt, remonstrated with him on his painful candour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must remember, Edgar,&rdquo; said she reprovingly, &ldquo;that you, of all men, have the  least right to sneer at her infirmities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  so, my fair cousin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you are of our blood, and when you marry may have children likewise afflicted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I did I&rsquo;d kill them,&rdquo; said Edgar, in strong disgust. &ldquo;All those little reptiles  should be drowned, like kittens, at their birth. They are not human beings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope, Edgar, when you succeed my grandfather, you will reconsider your brutal  determination,&rdquo; said Celia angrily. &ldquo;You know that for generations our family  has produced dwarfs, and as you, being of our blood, will not be exempt from  the burden, it is only right and just that you should bear it as our  forefathers have done. If you take the title and estates, you have a right to  take the trouble also; or else,&rdquo; added Celia significantly, &ldquo;do not marry, and  so end the race.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall only marry one woman&mdash;yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I am afraid you will die a bachelor,&rdquo; retorted Celia disdainfully. &ldquo;I  would not marry you for all the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you would that cub of a secretary,&rdquo; said Edgar imprudently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  silent, sir! How dare you connect my name with his?&rdquo; cried Celia indignantly. &ldquo;I  am not likely to marry Mr. Warwick, or any one else, that I know of. Why do you  vent your spleen on him? He does no harm to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he does. He has supplanted me in my uncle&rsquo;s good graces. However, I do not  care. When I come to my own I&rsquo;ll kick him out of the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  quite strong enough to kick you,&rdquo; replied Celia coolly; &ldquo;and I would remind  you, Edgar, of the proverb anent cup and lip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, Celia? Your grandfather hinted some nonsense of that sort, now you  do so. I demand an explanation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have none to give you,&rdquo; said Miss Lelanro coldly, &ldquo;save that life is uncertain  and you may die before entering into your kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if that is all, I am prepared to take the risk,&rdquo; scoffed Edgar, greatly  relieved. &ldquo;I am quite satisfied, cousin. Neither you, nor your grandfather, nor  your precious secretary can rob me of title and estates. The law is stronger  than your wishes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  greatly regret that it should be so,&rdquo; said Celia, who found Edgar peculiarly  exasperating this afternoon; &ldquo;but here we are in Madam Tot&rsquo;s garden, so I beg  of you to bridle your tongue and give her the deference to which she is accustomed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  Infernal nonsense,&rdquo; growled Edgar, following his cousin towards the  summer-house. &ldquo;Deference to a little monster like that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Discarding  for a time her favourite green colour, Madam Tot was arrayed in a long garment  of bright yellow, and wore on her white hair a pointed hat, such as is affected  by the Welsh peasantry. In this odd attire, leaning her withered hands on an  ebony cane, with her black eyes sparkling maliciously, she looked like some  tiny witch full of venom and spite. The cackle of malignant laughter with which  she greeted Edgar, startled even the strong nerves of that sceptic, and he  could not but own to himself that, despite her size, Madam Tot would be better  to have as a friend than a foe. But he forgot this wise conclusion in a few  minutes, and proceeded to torment the dwarf as a boy does a monkey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-day,  Bottom the Weaver,&rdquo; said the dwarf, holding out her tiny hand, &ldquo;you can kiss  the fingers of Titania the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  unaccustomed good-humour Edgar threw himself down on the grass, and as her  little hand rested on his broad brown palm, he kissed it gallantly, thereby  winning an approving smile from Madam Tot, who was a great stickler for  ceremonial.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page121.jpg" width="800" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is some chivalry about you, after all, cousin,&rdquo; she said, with stately grace. &ldquo;I  am glad to see you. Celia, be seated on that bench.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  young lady did as she was bid, while Edgar reclined at her feet, and Madam Tot,  bringing out a doll&rsquo;s chair from the summer-house, seated herself before the  pair. So tiny was she, so odd and elfish in looks and ways, that Edgar, earthy  as he was, felt a shiver down his back at the idea that this uncanny creature  was of his flesh and blood. If he married it was more than likely that at least  one of his children would resemble this yellow and spiteful faery. No wonder he  shuddered at the bare idea of such a possibility.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  where is my dear Mr. Warwick, Celia?&rdquo; asked the dwarf, leaning her chin on the  top of her cane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  in the library with grandpapa, aunt. They are going through the Lelanro  pedigree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that for?&rdquo; growled Edgar crossly. &ldquo;Your secretary fellow has nothing to do with  our pedigree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo;  said Madam Tot, flashing a malicious glance on the puffy red face before her. &ldquo;I  see you do not like my Mr. Warwick, Bottom the Weaver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I  think he&rsquo;s an insolent cub,&rdquo; retorted Winyard, with insulting calmness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Celia doesn&rsquo;t think so, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&rdquo; said Celia, blushing at the remark. &ldquo;In  all things I find Mr. Warwick a courteous gentleman. Why Edgar speaks of him so  ungraciously I cannot conceive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you have no eyes, my love,&rdquo; retorted Madam Tot, pointing her cane at Edgar. &ldquo;This  gentleman is jealous of your appreciation of our friend&rsquo;s good qualities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jealous  of a servant; not I!&rdquo; replied Edgar, enraged at this thrust. &ldquo;Celia can admire  a dozen such for all I care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  indeed!&rdquo; snapped Madam Tot vivaciously. &ldquo;Then you and Celia are not minded to  marry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not,&rdquo; said Celia calmly. &ldquo;Edgar knows well that my decision was taken on  that point long before I saw Mr. Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you bring him in?&rdquo; said Winyard savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you seem to have got it into your head that I have fallen in love with Mr.  Warwick, and so altered my determination to marry you, which,&rdquo; added Celia,  looking steadily at her cousin, &ldquo;is by no means the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  dwarf, pleased at Edgar&rsquo;s discomfited look, laughed with shrill enjoyment,  which roused the black spirit in his breast, and caused him to turn fiercely on  the little creature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  quiet, you monkey!&rdquo; he said sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monkey!&rdquo;  repeated Madam Tot, angered by the epithet, &ldquo;how dare you call me monkey, you  coarse giant&mdash;you grovelling Caliban! I&rsquo;ll have you pinched black and blue&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  ride you with nightmare! I&rsquo;ll blight you with spells.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was on her feet by this time, waving her cane in impotent fury; her little face  convulsed with passion. Before Celia could intervene to appease the wrath  raised by Edgar&rsquo;s indiscreet speech, she suddenly calmed down, and cold malice  usurped the place of hot rage. Of the two moods Edgar preferred the latter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He!  he!&rdquo; she tittered maliciously, &ldquo;you sneer at my spells, no doubt! But I can  punish you in another way. Warwick is a cub, is he&mdash;a poor foundling&mdash;a paid  servant&mdash;and you are my lord and master&mdash;the future Lord Lelanro? Edgar Winyard,&rdquo;  she said, pointing her staff towards him, &ldquo;you shall go down, and he shall rise  up. Honour and happiness await him. Ruin and dishonour attend on your steps.  Take your last look at Lelanro Manor, sir, for never will you see it again. I  put a spell on you, creature! Without heart, or good breeding, or kindness, you  have insulted your kinswoman. She curses you! Within a month you will be in the  dust&mdash;there you will stay till a suicide&rsquo;s grave receives your dishonoured clay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Edgar  shrank from the glittering eyes and hurried speech of the dwarf; but before he  could summon up sufficient courage to reply, she darted into the summer-house  and closed the door. No words or entreaties of Celia could draw her forth, and  Edgar was unwillingly compelled to retire with the unenviable feeling that he  had behaved in a singularly ill-bred fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  advised you to behave yourself,&rdquo; said Celia as they left the garden, &ldquo;and  speaking candidly, I think you have acted in a most abominable manner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  provoked me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shouldn&rsquo;t let yourself be provoked,&rdquo; retorted Celia sharply; &ldquo;a poor little  creature like that can do you no harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not so sure of that,&rdquo; muttered Edgar uneasily. &ldquo;What the deuce does she mean by  her hints?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Celia  vouchsafed no reply to this speech, but having conducted Edgar out of the dwarf&rsquo;s  domain, she left him to his own devices. Indignant with his conduct, she  disliked the idea of remaining in his company, and so Edgar found himself  alone. As is usual with such natures, he blamed every one but himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is Warwick&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; he thought angrily, biting his nails. &ldquo;There is some  mystery about that intruder which is inimical to myself. I don&rsquo;t like Madam Tot&rsquo;s  hints, the horrible little witch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  will be noted that, much as Winyard affected to despise his dwarfish kinswoman,  he was in reality afraid of her malice, and inclined to gift her with a power  harming him which, so far as he knew, she did not posses. His conscience made a  coward of him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_XVI"></a>Chapter XVI<br>
    Love&rsquo;s Young Dream</b></h2>
  <p>AT  the age of twenty, Celia Lelanro should certainly have known better than to  fall in love with he grandfather&rsquo;s dependent within the space of a few weeks.  That Warwick should be in the same plight was scarcely to be wondered at, even  though he had the advantage o her in age by two years. In affairs of the heart  women are always older than men, and Celia, by all the traditions of her sex,  should have kept her feelings more under control. In place of such restraint  she let her passion have its way, and finally found herself hopelessly devoted  to the young man. Only when it was too late did she recognize that her future  happiness depended on a life-companionship with Warwick.</p>
  <p>The  presence of Edgar Winyard, in place of retarding, hastened the catastrophe, for  the contrast between the two aspirants to her favour was greatly to the  advantage of the secretary. If Winyard had the better birth, Warwick owned the  cleverer brain; and though the first was well dowered with wealth, the last  possessed the advantage of a handsomer face and figure. Moreover, while Edgar  was brusque and careless in his manner, the secretary was severely polite, and  always conducted himself with grave dignity. No doubt, from daily association  with Lord Lelanro, Warwick unconsciously imitated his stately reserve; but it  was certain that, as the days passed by, Celia saw in him an increasing  likeness to her grandfather. If appearance went for anything, Warwick was much  more the aristocrat than his more fortunately placed rival.</p>
  <p>Trained  by her grandfather, Celia admired his school of old-fashioned politeness, and  seeing it reproduced in Warwick, softened by a certain youthful vivacity, she  could not help comparing him to the disadvantage of the free-and-easy Edgar.  That young man was loud and assertive in demeanour, swaggered about the place  in an offensively bumptious manner, and frankly regarded the female sex as  indisputably inferior to his noble self. Celia had never liked him over-much;  but now that his lack of chivalry was accentuated by the neighbourhood of the  courteous Warwick, she grew positively to hate him.</p>
  <p>Being  in this frame of mind, it appeared probable that she would affect the society  of Warwick and frown on the efforts of his rival to win her smiles. In place of  doing so she acted in a directly opposite manner, for daily she tolerated the  advances of Edgar with feigned good-humour, and disdainfully refused to notice  the respectful admiration of the secretary. Had Warwick been better acquainted  with the female heart he would have seen that this haughtiness was intended to  mask a deeper feeling, but, unlearned in such recondite matters, he lost heart  at the neglect of his mistress, and became daily more jealous of the successful  Edgar.</p>
  <p>Hitherto  his sojourn at the Manor House had been very pleasant; but now, devoured by jealousy,  and tortured by the sight of Celia&rsquo;s disdain, he grew silent and unhappy. To  all appearance he might as well wish for the moon as for the smiles of Miss  Lelanro; and therefore he tried vainly to school his heart into acceptance of  the inevitable. Since the downfall of his air castles when shown the dwarfs&rsquo;  cemetery by Dr. Pryce, he had surrendered all hope of learning the truth  concerning his birth. Ballard was dead, and, so far as he knew, no one else  could reveal the truth. At this period of his life Warwick took a very gloomy  view of his future, as it seemed as though all things he most desired were  beyond his reach.</p>
  <p>Lord  Lelanro, seeing the youth&rsquo;s unhappy face, was uniformly kind, but made no  advances towards an explanation, and so long as Warwick fulfilled his duties he  seemed to overlook his individual woes. Exasperated by the indifference of his  patron, by the neglect of Celia, and the studied insolence of Edgar, who lost  no opportunity of making himself disagreeable, Warwick resolved to end the  matter by giving up a position which was one of constant pain. The only thing  which withheld him from doing so without further delay, was the thought of  Madam Tot, who he knew would sadly miss him and his music. Nevertheless he was  half determined to take his leave, and carry out his original intention of  going to London; but first he resolved to speak with the dwarf, of whose shrewd  brain he had a great opinion, and learn if possible the reason of Celia&rsquo;s  coldness.</p>
  <p>Another  reason which induced him to interview the little lady, was that she had not yet  resolved the riddle which he had submitted to her; or if she had done so, the  solution had not yet been placed before him. Failing Ballard, who was dead, and  his fancy of kinship with the Lelanros, which had been proved false by Pryce,  there only remained the chance of his descent being explained by that name and  date. Much as he hoped that the truth might be learned thereby, Warwick feared  there was but a slender chance of matters being set right in so frivolous a  fashion. &ldquo;Algernon, 24 December, 1857.&rdquo; Who could make anything of such solemn  trifling?</p>
  <p>Madam  Tot received him in her own special doll&rsquo;s house, where he had revived from his  swoon on that eventful morning. With a dexterity begotten by constant practice,  Warwick went down on his hands and knees, and wriggled himself gingerly through  the low door. His bulk took up the most part of the room, and Madam Tot hastily  cleared the tiny chairs and tables out of the way, lest they should be crushed  by this colossus. Owing to the narrow limits of the chamber, as compared with  ordinary rooms, surrounded by the miniature furniture placed beside the tiny  dwarf, whose near presence accentuated his size, Warwick seemed abnormally  large, and lay stretched on the carpet with his head resting on the sofa, like  Gulliver in the largest temple of Lilliput. In this instance truth was stranger  than fiction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Man Mountain,&rdquo; cried Madam Tot, who was well acquainted with the romance of the  great Dean, &ldquo;why have you sought me in my bower? The garden is better for you,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to speak to you particularly, Madam Tot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it is about your riddle, Mr. Warwick, I do not intend to tell you of it till  the moon shines full on the Faery Ring. That will be next week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you read the riddle?&rdquo; asked Warwick eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I have,&rdquo; retorted the dwarf disdainfully; &ldquo;it required but little skill  to make it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  what sense can you make out of a name and a date?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aha!  That is my secret. It makes sense sure enough as you will learn in six days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not tell me now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have my reasons, Man Mountain,&rdquo; retorted Madam Tot sharply. &ldquo;Why do you wish to  upset my plans?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I am going away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going  away!&rdquo; cried the little creature, with shrill dismay. &ldquo;Why! Has any one been  treating you badly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  that is&mdash;no one in particular,&rdquo; stammered Warwick, feeling himself at a  disadvantage, &ldquo;but I think I have stayed long enough at the Manor. It is time I  went out into the world to seek my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  fortune is not in the world, sir, it is here,&rdquo; replied Madam Tot, nodding her  head wisely. &ldquo;Do not seek in far lands what you may find on your own doorstep!  Ha! she added, with a sudden start, &ldquo;it is Edgar Winyard you complain of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  no, Madam Tot; I am not the man to let myself be upset by a boorish manner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a boor,&rdquo; assented the dwarf smartly; &ldquo;a, real Bottom the Weaver. I&rsquo;ve told  him so several times, but the creature hasn&rsquo;t read <i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Drean</i> and cannot see the application. So it&rsquo;s  not Bottom, pursued Madam Tot reflectively; &ldquo;is it Blunderbore or Pryce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hah!  do you mean to say that my brother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say nothing about Lord Lelanro,&rdquo; interrupted War wick hastily; &ldquo;he is kindness  itself. But I have my reasons for wishing to go, and if you will kindly tell me  the riddle I will make my arrangements and take my departure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  you will do no such thing,&rdquo; retorted Madam Tot angrily. &ldquo;Here you are and here  you shall stay. Don&rsquo;t be impatient, sir; wait and hope. All will come right,  and in a way you little dream of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know what I mean. I saw my brother the other day, and we talked you over&mdash;well  over,&rdquo; said she emphatically; &ldquo;he is satisfied, and so am I. Fate has great  things in store for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!  had she only one thing in store for me, I should be content,&rdquo; sighed Warwick  regretfully.</p>
  <p>Madam  Tot cocked her head on one side with a roguish look in her bright eyes, and  then clapping her tiny hands burst into an elvish laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Prythee  why so pale, fond lover?&rsquo; &rdquo; quoted she gleefully. &ldquo;Oh! so my great-niece has  been wringing your heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t  say so, Madam Tot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Man  Mountain, I am no fool! Don&rsquo;t judge my brain by my little body. I can see well  enough that you love Celia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; returned Warwick defiantly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  wants you to help it, you great goose?&rdquo; retorted the dwarf, smiling. &ldquo;If you  love the girl, why not tell her so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dare not! I am a nobody&mdash;a penniless outcast. How can I hope to aspire to the  hand of a great lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo;  said Madam Tot, with a twinkle in her shrewd eyes, &ldquo;no doubt you are right. As  Warwick the fiddler, you are no match for our family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  thought the little lady was rather heartless, and hastened to take his leave,  as it was apparent he would get no sympathy from so whimsical a being. Madam  Tot guessed his feelings, but in place of soothing them, merely laughed and  tittered as he withdrew from her chamber. There was a great deal of malice in  her nature, and she enjoyed the unhappy plight of her favourite. Yet when he  left her room she made some amends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Man  Mountain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Madam Tot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you leave the Manor till I read the riddle next week. Come to the faery ring  when the moon is full, and hear your fate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, Madam Tot,&rdquo; grumbled the disconsolate lover. &ldquo;I will wait a week. After  that I shall leave you for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  his retreating footsteps died away Madam Tot clapped her hands again, and  skipped lightly about her chamber, screeching with laughter. Evidently the woes  of Warwick caused her great amusement. At this moment a rap came at the  casement, and the dwarf opened it smartly, to find Celia&rsquo;s face smiling at her.  So low was the window, and so tall Celia, that she easily looked into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  away, you bad creature,&rdquo; snapped Madam Tot, slapping her relative lightly on  the cheek; &ldquo;you torturer of poor young men&rsquo;s hearts, go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aunt,&rdquo;  said Gelia, blushing at the hint conveyed, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has just left me, you flirt&mdash;you coquette&mdash;you siren without a voice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edgar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edgar,  indeed!&rdquo; replied Madam Tot in high disdain. &ldquo;As though I would let that great  creature into my bower! No, Celia, it was not Edgar, it was&mdash;Ah, you know well  enough! I&rsquo;m sure he loves you dearly, and you are too much of the woman, my  dear, not to have seen it long ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  that silly Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; cried Celia, blushing still deeper. &ldquo;What has he been  saying, aunt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  he is going away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going  away! Oh, he must not go away, Madam Tot,&rdquo; cried Celia, with a dismay which  directly contradicted her former speeches.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo;  said the dwarf, inspecting the girl&rsquo;s blushing face, &ldquo;so the wind blows that  way, my love. Well, well, I had rather you married Mr. Warwick, penniless as he  is, than that horrid stable creature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no question of marriage, aunt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  will be soon, Celia. Wait till the full moon shines on the faery ring. Now go away.  I want no more lovers&rsquo; tales. Be kinder to the young man, you wretched girl, or  you will lose him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Celia,  finding herself no match for this sharp tongue, walked away with her head in  the air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I were as tall as you,&rdquo; cried Madam Tot, determined to have the last word, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d  marry him myself. There!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_XVII"></a>Chapter XVII<br>
    Autolycus</b></h2>
  <p>ON  the Wednesday of the following week a gruff individual in a dirty white  great-coat, with a still dirtier white hat and a red worsted scarf hiding most  of his pimply countenance, presented himself at the Manor House, and requested  to see Mr. Algernon Warwick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Likewise,&rdquo;  continued this odd visitor, to impress the supercilious footman, &ldquo;the lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  thrust into Mercury&rsquo;s hand a stout piece of cardboard, inscribed &ldquo;Autolycus,  Proprietor of the Rarest Collection of Monstrosities in the Unbounded Universe&rdquo;;  and chuckled hoarsely as he conveyed further information&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Collecshun is set up on the village green, young man; and I hev known those  civil to Autolycus git on the free list.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  footman did not seem to be overwhelmed by this offer, but still supercilious,  departed, holding the card betwixt a dainty finger and thumb. During his  absence the showman took a seat, and breathing hard the while, examined the  stately hall in which he found himself. Autolycus had been in too many  cathedral towns to be impressed by the beauty of this interior; and in place of  admiring the arched roof, and lofty pillars, and chequered marble floor, he  sighed to think that amid these splendours Warwick would soon forget the Rarest  Collection in the Unbounded Universe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  a fiddler as he was,&rdquo; ruminated Autolycus, solacing himself with a peppermint  drop. &ldquo;He danced the public in even if they didn&rsquo;t want to go. It&rsquo;s a rum  start, this here, I wonder how he flew so high! Ah! I allays said he was a  heagle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  further reflections were put an end to by the footman&rsquo;s return, and he learned  that both Lord Lelanro and Warwick waited him in the library. Autolycus stumped  bravely after the still scornful domestic. Before he advanced into the room he  marked his disapprobation of this conduct by making a speech, short and to the  point&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Instead  of being a deadhead, young man, I&rsquo;ll charge double for your admission. No  sniffers are allowed in my show.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  might have added more, but that Mercury, having announced him, withdrew  promptly from such low company, and Autolycus found his hand in the warm grasp  of Warwick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to see you, Autolycus,&rdquo; said the young man heartily; &ldquo;let me introduce  you to Lord Lelanro, who is anxious to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  allays said you were a heagle,&rdquo; murmured Autolycus, taking in the improved  looks of his friend; &ldquo;an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve soared wunnerful. Ah, lord,&rdquo; he added, turning  to Lelanro, &ldquo;I hopes as I sees you well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am quite well, Mr. Autolycus, and I am glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  &lsquo;andle to my name, lord,&rdquo; said the showman, taking a seat. &ldquo;I got it out of a  play of Mr. Shakespeare, as you may have heerd &lsquo;on. There was no Mister there,  so I don&rsquo;t hold to tacking it on here. Well, Algeernon Warwick, you have  growed,&rdquo; he added, turning to the youth. &ldquo;Why, you could make a dozen of your  parent. That is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  Autolycus closed his mouth and winked mysteriously at Warwick, to know if he  could speak openly. The secretary soon reassured him on that point.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  Lelanro knows all my story, Autolycus,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;I told him of my  father, the dwarf, and of your kindness to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that wasn&rsquo;t much, Algeernon. I couldn&rsquo;t see a bright lad like you sink when &lsquo;twas  your natur&rsquo; to soar! A heagle, I said, allays a heagle. Well, lord, I&rsquo;ve come  with the whole show; it&rsquo;s down at the village, under charge of the missus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  I must go and see my old friend Mrs. Guss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Guss,&rdquo; repeated Lelanro, wondering why the wife&rsquo;s name was different to that of  the husband; &ldquo;your better half, Autolycus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  She thinks &lsquo;erself the better whole,&rdquo; growled the showman, who was evidently  under petticoat government. &ldquo;My name, lord, is Guss; but I call myself  perfessionally Autolycus. She, well known to the public as the Boundin&rsquo; Sylph,  now answers to the private name of Mrs. Guss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand,&rdquo; said Lelanro, smiling. &ldquo;Mr. Warwick, I think you may go down to  the village and renew your acquaintance with Mrs. Guss. I wish to speak with  this gentleman&mdash;alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  my lord,&rdquo; answered Warwick, wondering what could be the reason of all this  mystery; &ldquo;I will go at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  pray, Mr. Warwick, request Dr. Pryce to give me the pleasure of his company,&rdquo;  pursued Lelanro, accompanying his secretary to the door. &ldquo;I will give you my  reasons in a few days,&rdquo; he added in a lower tone, noting the young man&rsquo;s  wonder; &ldquo;you can trust me, Mr. Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should be ungrateful if I did not,&rdquo; replied Warwick, taking the hand held out  to him; &ldquo;I leave myself in your hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  the door closed behind him, Lelanro returned to his seat and looked with some  interest on Autolycus, who, unused to high society, strove to hide his  confusion by another peppermint drop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wonder no doubt why I have sent for you, Autolycus,&rdquo; said Lelanro slowly; &ldquo;but  the fact is, Mr. Warwick arrived at my house some time ago, and as I have taken  a great fancy to him, I made him my secretary,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  heagle, lord. That&rsquo;s what he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Warwick told me his story,&rdquo; pursued Lelanro, smiling at the remark, &ldquo;and I  notice that there is a mystery connected with his birth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  Autolycus could remark on this speech, Pryce entered the room, and having been  duly presented to the showman, took a seat beside Lelanro to assist at  extracting information regarding Warwick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like you to tell us, Autolycus,&rdquo; said Lelanro, when the introduction was  over, &ldquo;what you know of Mr. Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Autolycus  wiped his countenance with a red bandanna handkerchief, and looked sharply at  the two men before him. In spite of his eccentricities he was no fool, and  liked Warwick too well to make any revelation which, for all he knew, might be  hurtful to his future.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,  lord and doctor,&rdquo; said the showman, placing a stumpy forefinger in the palm of  his left hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know your game?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page135.jpg" width="496" height="750"></p>
  <p>The  reply to this leading question required some consideration. Lelanro was by no  means inclined to trust this man of the people with the secret of his house,  and so he framed a cautious answer, which, while satisfying the scruples of  Autolycus, yet preserved the dignity of the Lelanros.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  design no ill to Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; said he, after a pause. &ldquo;On the contrary, I wish  to do my best to advance his interests. But you must be aware, Autolycus&mdash;since  it pleases you to be called so&mdash;that unless I know all about the youth I cannot  hope to assist him as I should wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  fair enuff, lord,&rdquo; answered Autolycus, revolving this reply. &ldquo;I can tell ye all  I know, for there ain&rsquo;t anything as is best to hide. You know his story, I b&rsquo;lieve?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  know that his father was a dwarf, who married the Fair Circassian, and that he  was sent to a public school at your instance,&rdquo; said Pryce. &ldquo;That was a good  deed of yours, Autolycus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;,  nothin&rsquo;, lord and doctor. I said he was a heagle to soar, and wanted to &lsquo;elp  him. Not but what I was sorry to lose him, sirs. What a fiddler he is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  plays the violin excellently,&rdquo; said Lelanro impatiently; &ldquo;but about his father.  Where did you obtain this dwarf?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay! That&rsquo;s Algeernon, the Pigmy Napoleon; so we called him perfessionally, lord  and doctor. Ay, he was a draw! I never saw a freak like him. Beautifully made  he was, and could &lsquo;ave gone into a teacup.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you get him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  got him,&rdquo; repeated Autolycus slowly, &ldquo;from a man called Ballard; but where <i>he</i> got him I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pryce  and Lelanro looked at one another and seemed to approve of this speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what year did you receive this dwarf from Ballard?&rdquo; asked Lelanro anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was in 1849,&rdquo; replied Autolycus, scratching his head; &ldquo;leastways, I think so, &lsquo;cause  I lost money at Rochester that year, and the next Algeernon pulled it back for  me. Ay, lord and doctor, he was a draw, that Pigmy Napoleon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Warwick  has a paper given him by his father,&rdquo; said Pryce, &ldquo;in which the date of his  birth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  whose birth, doctor&mdash;Algeernon I. or Algeernon II.?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  first&mdash;the father. This paper says he was born in 1857; so that being the case  you couldn&rsquo;t have received him in 1849, before he was born.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; said Autolycus contemptuously. &ldquo;The Pigmy Napoleon, you  must know, gentlemen, was allays thinking himself a great person and descended  from crowned heads. He b&rsquo;lieved in that paper, which he said came from Ballard,  who sometimes came to see how he was; but it didn&rsquo;t mean much. He said that the  figures and the letters of the name Algeernon, which was his own, would prove  his rank; but he never could find out the meaning, and Ballard wouldn&rsquo;t tell  him. From what I know,&rdquo; added Autolycus emphatically, &ldquo;he was born in 1846, for  I got him in 1849, and he was then three years old. To be sure, I ain&rsquo;t certain  of his real age. He might have been two when I got him&mdash;these dwarfs are so  misleading from their smallness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how do you account for the eleven years&rsquo; difference inscribed on that paper?&rdquo;  asked Lelanro.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a riddle, sir. Leastways, Ballard said so; and I guess he altered the  figures from four to five to suit the finding out of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord  Lelanro nodded, to imply that the explanation satisfied him, and made two or  three memoranda on a slip of paper. Then he asked another question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  this man Ballard give you any explanation as to how he came by the dwarf?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted the showman gruffly. &ldquo;He was as deep as a well, and told  me to mind my own business. He had a share in Algeernon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  share!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  lord! I gave him so much on the takings, for the Pigmy Napoleon was a great  draw with the public. Now he&rsquo;s dead, and the rest of the show don&rsquo;t attract  like he did. I wish Ballard could have got me another dwarf like him. I&rsquo;d give  him the same price, I, would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk like that, man,&rdquo; said Lelanro, who looked rather pale. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to  hear these details.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Autolycus,  rather wondering at this unaccountable agitation, took another peppermint drop,  and, being wise in his generation, held his peace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ballard  is dead, is he not?&rdquo; asked Pryce, seeing the old nobleman was too upset to  speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,  doctor! I didn&rsquo;t know it when I told young Algeernon to go to Lunnon for the  second time. But when I wrote to that Ballard in Duke Street, a month ago, I  found out he was dead. Died in furren parts, gentlemen, as a valet to a  travelling gent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was this dwarf of yours married to the Fair Circassian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  St. Martin&rsquo;s Church, Canterbury,&rdquo; replied the showman. &ldquo;Oh, it was all  straight, lord. I wouldn&rsquo;t have profligacy in my caravan. Neither would the  missus. She&rsquo;s very, very moral, she is,&rdquo; concluded Autolycus, shaking his head.  &ldquo;As moral a Boundin&rsquo; Sylph as I ever did see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you a picture of this dwarf?&rdquo; demanded Lelanro, making another memorandum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  brought one with me, as I guessed from young Algeernon&rsquo;s letter you wanted to  see me about his father,&rdquo; replied Autolycus, producing a photograph from his  pocket, and laying it down before Lelanro. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to know, lord,  where Ballard got that dwarf? I&rsquo;d give a good deal to get another of &lsquo;em, male  or female. My stars, he was a draw&mdash;so beautifully made, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will do! that will do!&rdquo; said Lelanro sharply. &ldquo;Leave me for a time, Autolycus&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  see you later on and renew this conversation. Pryce, ring the bell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor did so, and when the footman appeared Autolycus was delivered into his  charge with instructions to look after his creature comforts. Pryce conducted  the showman to the door and dismissed him with a last warning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a word of this conversation to a soul,&rdquo; he said hurriedly.</p>
  <p>Autolycus  laid a stubby finger on one side of his red nose, to imply silence, and stumped  out of the room in the wake of Mercury. Dr. Pryce returned to find his patron  with a drawn face full of pain leaning back in his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  sin has found me out, Pryce,&rdquo; said Lord Lelanro, with a groan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough,&rdquo; replied Pryce coolly; &ldquo;still, you have a chance of making reparation  to the son for what you did to the father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think he&rsquo;ll forgive me, Pryce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Under  the circumstances,&rdquo; said the doctor, after a pause, &ldquo;I think he will forgive  you. I only hope,&rdquo; he added rather anxiously, &ldquo;that he will forgive me also,  for at your request, Lord Lelanro, I misled the poor boy by a false statement.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_XVIII"></a>Chapter  XVIII<br>
    Renunciation</b></h2>
  <p>AUTOLYCUS  had come and gone; but it did not seem to Warwick that his visit had resulted  in anything tangible. Ignorant of what had taken place in the library, he could  not understand why Lord Lelanro had sought speech with the showman; and as  nothing was said on the matter, he did not seek to force the confidence of  either Pryce or the old nobleman. Things went on as usual after the departure  of Autolycus, save that Edgar Winyard made himself more disagreeable than ever,  and Celia assumed a kinder manner. Warwick could not understand the reason of  her new-born geniality.</p>
  <p>After  the rebuke administered by Madam Tot, her great-niece had seriously examined  her mind, so as to ascertain beyond all doubt what were her feelings towards  Warwick. As she might have guessed, the examination showed her that she was  hopelessly in love with the young man; and as that love, according to Madam  Tot, was ardently returned, Celia foresaw for herself and him a very unhappy  future. As Celia she could not be happy without the love and companionship of  Warwick; as Miss Lelanro it was out of the question that she should attain such  blessings through the medium of so imprudent a marriage. She was the daughter  of a noble house, he a nameless orphan, penniless and obscure. It were less  difficult to join fire and water than these two in holy matrimony; yet in such  junction lay the future happiness of each.</p>
  <p>Edgar,  with the keen eyes of a jealous lover, guessed the feelings of his cousin  towards Warwick, and hated them both accordingly; Celia for her weakness,  Warwick for his insolent aspirations. Greatly as he would have liked to end the  matter by ridding the house of Warwick, such a course was out of the question  while the young man remained the favourite of Lelanro. Once or twice, indeed,  Winyard had hinted at the lad&rsquo;s presumption, but the old lord persistently  refused to believe that his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> could do anything wrong, and told Edgar plainly to leave such matters alone.  Celia also had reproved him sharply for remarks made in the same spirit, so  Edgar could do nothing but look on hopelessly and wrathfully at this interloper  assuming his place in the household. With the petty spite of a narrow  understanding he lost no opportunity of rousing Warwick&rsquo;s temper; but his  malice was thwarted by the supreme disdain manifested by the young man. Even  Winyard&rsquo;s thick hide of egotism was stung by this calm contempt.</p>
  <p>Though  Warwick held his own bravely, and strove by masking his emotions to keep things  smooth, yet he was very unhappy, and, thinking Celia was beyond his reach, he  resolved to end his folly by absenting himself from her presence. It was truly  the desire of the moth for the star, but in this instance the star had stooped  of late to the lowly sphere of the moth, and it was this point that most  troubled the unhappy lover. As an honourable man he could not win clandestinely  the love of his patron&rsquo;s grand-daughter.</p>
  <p>Sometimes  he had it in his mind to throw himself at her feet and implore her compassion;  but a constant memory of Lelanro&rsquo;s kindness prevented such folly, and in the  effort to preserve his honour, he was the more disdainful of the two. These  lovers were working at cross purposes, and consequently they felt daily more  unhappy, a state of things not ameliorated by the watchful hatred of the  inconvenient third.</p>
  <p>Madam  Tot was well aware of Warwick&rsquo;s passion for her great-niece, but  notwithstanding her pride, which was great, she did not seek to discourage the  wooing. Nay, more, on all possible occasions she brought the couple together in  her garden, and by looks and hints she seemed to desire to bring about an  understanding. Celia, who by this time had thrown prudence to the winds, was in  nowise disinclined to bring matters to a crisis, but Warwick, with a strength  of will far beyond his years, did his best to withstand temptation. At length  the effort became too great, and he sought Lelanro in order to confess his  unhappy feelings, and ask permission to withdraw from so dangerous a  neighbourhood.</p>
  <p>Had  this resolution been made known to Madam Tot, she would have been greatly  offended, as she desired Warwick to remain till she solved his riddle by the  faery ring when the moon was full. He, however, anticipating no benefit from  her revelation, was impatient of her whimsical fancy to blend the real with the  ideal, mortal doings with faery fantasy, and with youthful impetuosity he  poured out his heart to Lelanro, with a final request that he might leave  without delay.</p>
  <p>Strange  as it may appear, the haughty old nobleman did not seem angered at Warwick&rsquo;s  presumption in loving Celia, but heard him to the end with a benign smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you are resolved to leave me,&rdquo; he said, when the lad ended with hanging head  and flushed cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must, my lord. It is torture for me to stay here, and no good can come of a  hopeless passion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  that is very true,&rdquo; replied Lelanro smoothly; &ldquo;the disparity between your ranks  renders marriage impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so. But I am not to blame for loving her. King Cophetua loved a  beggar-maid, my lord; this passion of mine is the reverse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is honourable of you to tell me this,&rdquo; said Lelanro gravely. &ldquo;But you must know  that I can only answer in one way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am aware of that, my lord,&rdquo; replied Warwick bitterly; &ldquo;I never blinded myself  to the real aspect of the affair. The desire of the moth for the star. The moth  must go, and the star&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  of the star?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  wed another who is not worthy of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you mean Mr. Winyard,&rdquo; said Lelanro quietly, &ldquo;I can disabuse your mind on that  score. Celia does not love him, I do not respect him, so she will never become  his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  sighed Warwick, drawing a long breath, &ldquo;if only I had rank and position to  offer, there might be a chance for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think rank and position would weigh with Celia, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. I have not spoken,&rdquo; stammered Warwick, rather startled by so direct  a question; &ldquo;but yourself, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will talk of that another time,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, with a dry cough; &ldquo;in  the meantime I observe you have not asked me concerning my interview with  Autolycus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you learn anything from him, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  yes; I learned something of your family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  turned pale, for the idea that he would at last know who and what he was seemed  too good to be true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  family?&rdquo; he gasped, with a quick indrawn breath; &ldquo;did&mdash;did Autolycus know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  knew something. Dr. Pryce and myself knew the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what can you know about me?&rdquo; cried Warwick in despair. &ldquo;Do not raise my hopes  only to dash them to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  my boy; I shall not do that,&rdquo; said Lelanro, laying a kind hand on his shoulder.  &ldquo;I would tell you the truth now, but that I promised my poor little sister the  joy of breaking the news to you. She is so proud of that riddle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  riddle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely.  She has solved the riddle, which was an easy matter to her. Why, she will tell  you herself. You have had many strange adventures, Mr. Warwick; but the most  wonderful is yet to come. To-night you shall hear the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,  my lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I told you of my promise to my sister. The poor little creature, as you know,  Mr. Warwick, is fond of designating herself a changeling, and in her own  imagination participates in faery revels. To-night, as the moon is full, she  indulges in this freak, and then intends to let you know the truth. Afterwards,  you will come to Pryce&rsquo;s study and see me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  my lord, it is too serious a matter to me to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  be mixed up with the follies of Madam Tot, you would say,&rdquo; said Lelanro  quickly. &ldquo;Perhaps it is; but as she made the first discovery it is only right  that she should have the pleasure of communicating it at first hand. And after  all, Mr. Warwick,&rdquo; concluded the old man pathetically, &ldquo;you surely do not  grudge this trifling pleasure to so afflicted a creature. Be kind to her for my  sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  it be as you will, my lord,&rdquo; said Warwick, taking the hand held out to him. &ldquo;I  am quite agreeable to be informed as Madam Tot pleases; but when I know the  truth will I stay or go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall leave that to you, sir,&rdquo; said Lelanro, smiling. &ldquo;It depends on yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  on Miss Lelanro,&rdquo; hinted Warwick, with a daring which astonished himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case,&rdquo; said the old lord, pausing a moment at the door, &ldquo;you had better  speak to Miss Lelanro herself.&rdquo; And with that significant observation he passed  out of the room, leaving Warwick too surprised to make a remark. Left alone, he  sank into a chair, and strove to collect his scattered senses, which the  concluding speech of Lelanro had dispersed to the four winds of heaven. That so  proud a man as his patron should actually encourage him to woo Celia seemed  inexplicable. The only solution lay in the fact that Lelanro must be satisfied  that the race whence he sprang was equal to his own.</p>
  <p>Again  Warwick thought of the possibility of his father being one of the Lelanro  dwarfs, and himself heir to the estates; but this idea vanished when he thought  of the tiny grave with the date on the headstone. In the face of such evidence,  all chance of his hopes proving true was at an end, and he reluctantly  dismissed the thought that he was a Lelanro. Yet if the grave was strong  evidence on the one side, the fact that his father had been a dwarf was strong  evidence on the other; for it was impossible that so curious a circumstance  could be a mere coincidence. Warwick at length grew so bewildered that he did  not know what to think, and decided to leave the matter to time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whether  I be a Lelanro or not,&rdquo; said he hopefully, &ldquo;from what my lord says, I am  certainly of sufficiently good birth to aspire to the hand of Celia. That is  sufficient for me, and I ask no more of Providence.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_XIX"></a>Chapter XIX<br>
    Faery Music</b></h2>
  <p>THAT  same evening Winyard, undeterred by the memory of former refusals, proposed to  Celia for the third time. Aware of his pertinacious disposition, and having  some inkling of his intention, she had hitherto managed to evade an interview;  but now, finding herself alone with him in the drawing-room after dinner, she  submitted to her fate. Yet had not Edgar been blinded by self-conceit he might  have guessed what would be the result of his ill-advised application.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cousin  Edgar,&rdquo; said she, after he had solemnly asked her to be his wife, &ldquo;I am very  sorry that you should still hope for the impossible. Twice I have refused you,  and I do so now for the third time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  think of the advantages of our marrying,&rdquo; urged Edgar anxiously. &ldquo;I will be  Lord Lelanro within a measurable time, and own this property, so it is better  for you to become my wife than to lose your home at the Manor House.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would rather lose it than take you with it, cousin,&rdquo; retorted Celia sharply. &ldquo;I  wish to marry no one at present, least of all you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I love you, Celia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry to hear it, for once and for all I refuse to become your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Edgar,  tracing in this contemptuous refusal the influence of Warwick, lost his  temper, and made thoughtless remarks about Celia and the secretary, which  roused her wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  love that sneaking Warwick, Celia,&rdquo; he cried savagely, &ldquo;and would be willing  enough to marry him if he asked you. But you shall not marry him; I&rsquo;ll have him  turned out of the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will be your own fate if you speak like this,&rdquo; said Celia, rising to her feet  with a glowing cheek. &ldquo;Mr. Warwick is my very good friend, nothing more. If he  is poor and unknown he is at least a gentleman, which I regret to say you are  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  without further speech she turned her back on the discomfited lover and walked  towards the door. Enraged at her scorn, Edgar sped one last venomed shaft.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are going to meet the fellow now, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I am,&rdquo; replied Celia, with supreme disdain. &ldquo;Mr. Warwick is at present in the  company of Madam Tot, and I am going to see them both. If you so choose you can  employ your time in telling my grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  cousin could find nothing to reply to this last remark, and so permitted her to  leave the room without further speech. Left to himself, he raged impotently at  the thought that he could do no harm to this interloper; and at length, losing  all sense of wisdom in his hatred, he went in search of Lelanro, in order to  insist upon the instant dismissal of the presumptuous secretary. His  interference benefited in place of harming Warwick, and, by the irony of fate,  Edgar Winyard, who of all men would have declined the task, was the means of  restoring the man he hated to his rightful position in the world.</p>
  <p>It  was the night of the full moon, and Madam Tot, enamoured of her whimsical idea,  had summoned Warwick to the elfin solemnities at the faery ring. This, as has  been stated previously, was a circle of discoloured grass, which to her  distempered fancy was haunted by the peaceful neighbours. Whether she suffered  from hallucination, or whether she pretended to see her airy fancies embodied  in actual forms, it is impossible to say, but she certainly described what was  taking place to Warwick with a vividness which almost enabled him to behold the  fantasy with his own eyes.</p>
  <p>On  the plea that the little people did not like a mortal to espy on their  solemnities, she made Warwick sit down on the bench encircling the elm-tree  near the summerhouse, and hidden in the shade he looked out on the moonlit  sward, over which moved fantastically the tiny figure of Madam Tot. As a  compliment to the faeries she had assumed their favourite green colour, and  with a crown of roses, and her ebony staff held wand-fashion, she looked like  an actual inhabitant of Elf-land. Titania was not more graceful, Puck more  impish, or Queen Mab more airy than this odd little dwarf skipping about the  lawn to the music of the violin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you not see the little people,&rdquo; said she, running into the shade, &ldquo;yonder in  the cold moonlight? They whirl round and round in a ring with linked hands, and  flying hair. The green urchin, bonneted with a purple Canterbury bell, is  Oberon&rsquo;s lantern-bearer; that pale faery in filmy white is the queen of spring  flowers, as you can tell by her snowdrop crown. And oh! oh! oh!&rdquo; piped Madam  Tot, clapping her hands, &ldquo;just look at yonder red goblin with the grey beard  and pointed cap. My dear, he is a gnome, and digs gold in haunted caverns to  weld into faery rings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  him to bring me one,&rdquo; said Warwick, marvelling at the descriptive power of the  little woman, which almost made him credit her fancies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  spoke of it some time back,&rdquo; replied Madam Tot in a matter-of-fact tone, as  though the procuring of faery rings was quite an ordinary business; &ldquo;he will  bring you to-night&mdash;a wedding-ring!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  wedding-ring, Madam Tot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  my dear! A ring of red gold to bind you hard and fast to a fair lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is the lady?&rdquo; asked Warwick, divining some purpose in these foolish speeches.</p>
  <p>For  answer Madam Tot whirled herself in a magical manner, and while thus revolving,  shrilled out:</p>
  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Come  together, ne&rsquo;er to part,<br>
Hand to hand, and heart to heart,</p>
  <p>You  see, Man Mountain,&rdquo; she added, dropping into prose, &ldquo;I call and she comes.  Never deny that I am a witch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Across  the sward came Celia, looking pale and serious, for the late interview with  Edgar had somewhat disturbed her equanimity. The cunning dwarf had caught a  glimpse of her emerging from the house, and thus utilized the opportune arrival  for the fulfilment of the prophecy. With the moonlight glinting on her russet  hair, Celia in her white robe looked like a visitant from another world; and  Warwick could not remove his eyes from her passionless loveliness. Saluting her  with an elfish scream, Madam Tot danced up to her like a large doll.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  bid you welcome to the festival,&rdquo; said she, striving to reach Celia&rsquo;s hand; &ldquo;it  is by special permission of the neighbours of peace that you are here. To-night  they will bestow on you a rare boon. Take your place, my love, and watch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  due solemnity she conducted Celia to the bench, and intimated that she should  sit beside Warwick. Rather confused by the request Celia obeyed in silence, and  was glad to think that the shadows hid the blushes she felt rising hotly in her  cheeks. The young man, overcome with pleasure at her near neighbourhood, did  not venture a remark, and so these two sane people waited the behests of the  mad dwarf lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Play!&rdquo;  cried Madam Tot, raising her hand. &ldquo;I dance with my shadow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  swept the bow across the strings, and a ripple of notes gushed forth. With a  gasp of pure pleasure the dwarf sprang from shadow to light, and holding up her  quaint green dress, footed it as merrily as though she were sixteen instead of  sixty. She swayed, and swung, and whirled, and bowed, with waving hands and  nimble feet, till Celia almost fancied she saw a tiny witch at some Lilliputian  Walpurgis Night. With beck and bend she coquetted with her shadow, kissed her  tiny hands as it wavered on the sward, fled from it, pursued it, and spun in  circles after its retreating blackness. The music rose and fell, rippled  through the still air, and laughed and sang till one would have said the violin  was as elfish a thing as Madam Tot herself. Suddenly she whirled towards the  faery ring and sank in a heap in its centre. Warwick hastily laid down his  violin and rose as to help her; but she angrily called to him to keep back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will break the spell,&rdquo; she cried shrilly. &ldquo;I now listen to the dwarfs who bring  your marriage ring from the subterranean caves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  speaking, she laid her ear to the turf, while Warwick and Celia, in the deep  shadow of the tree, looked at one another, bubbling with silent laughter. The  oddity of the whole situation appealed to the romantic side of their natures;  but knowing the irritable nature of Madam Tot, they did not dare to show  disrespect by giving vent to their secret feelings of amusement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think she sees anything really?&rdquo; asked Celia in a low whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  may have hallucinations,&rdquo; replied Warwick in the same tone; &ldquo;and I think her  imagination is vivid enough to conjure up all the elves of England. Poor little  thing,&rdquo; he sighed sympathetically, &ldquo;it is a harmless pleasure in which she  indulges.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem very fond of Madam Tot, Mr. Warwick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is a quaint, lovable little creature,&rdquo; he answered softly. &ldquo;I shall be sorry to  leave her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you are not going?&rdquo; said Celia, with dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must. As soon as I learn the meaning of the riddle, I go,&rdquo; replied the young  man firmly; &ldquo;it is better for my peace of mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but  think how we&mdash;how I shall miss you,&rdquo; gasped Celia imprudently.</p>
  <p>Whether  it was the influence of the moonlight, the music, or the whole fantasy of the  scene, Warwick did not know; but almost without thinking, he enclosed Celia&rsquo;s  hands in his warm clasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you miss me, Miss Lelanro&mdash;Celia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you ask me that?&rdquo; she replied reproachfully. &ldquo;I would miss you more than any one  in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Celia, I am poor and unknown. I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, it is impossible; I dare not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you do not love me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do love you fondly&mdash;passionately. But you&mdash;you&mdash;Oh, Celia, have mercy on my folly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  slid off the bench on to the ground, and looked up to her with enamoured eyes.  She, having passed the Rubicon, forgot that she was Miss Lelanro and he a  servitor of her grandfather; she forgot social laws, social barriers, and, only  feeling in her own heart that she loved him above all men, bent down and kissed  him softly on the forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean it?&rdquo; he asked, hardly able to believe that his goddess had stooped  from her sphere.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you wish me to kiss you again, to prove that I do?&rdquo; she replied, smiling  through the gloom. &ldquo;I do mean it! I love you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  rose to his feet, unable to articulate another word, and clasped her in his  arms. In the warm gloom, heart beating on heart, lips laid to lips, they forgot  the barrier of caste and prejudice; it fell, they came together, and knew that  they loved, they adored each other. Youth and beauty and passion proved too  strong for social laws. Rash, foolish as it was, the knowledge had come on them  in its full strength. They loved.</p>
  <p>An  elfish titter made them spring apart, and they looked down to see Madam Tot  close beside them. But no frown was on her face, and instead of appearing to be  angry, she expressed her pleasure loudly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Things  have turned out well,&rdquo; she said, smiling; &ldquo;you will marry one another, and  become lord and lady of Lelanro Manor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can that be?&rdquo; asked Warwick in surprise. &ldquo;The riddle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  interruption!&rdquo; frowned Madam Tot, holding out her hand. &ldquo;Here is the faery ring  which the gnomes have brought for your wedding. Place it on Celia&rsquo;s finger, and  then I read your riddle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  ring she proffered, wherever it came from, was certainly tangible enough, and  Warwick, hardly knowing what he was about, slipped it on the slim finger held  out by Celia. She was smiling, and seemed to understand her great-aunt better  than did Warwick, who was too bewildered to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  faery circle binds you together for ever and ever,&rdquo; said the dwarf solemnly. &ldquo;Our  solemnities are at an end, and I return to the actual world. In the study of  Dr. Pryce my brother awaits you, so lead your bride thither, Algernon Lelanro.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  name did you say?&rdquo; cried Warwick, hardly crediting his ears, and looking from  the dwarf to Celia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are Algernon Lelanro,&rdquo; said the latter, smiling, &ldquo;and I am your cousin Celia.  Foolish boy, I knew it well, else I never would have listened to your wooing.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_XX"></a>Chapter XX<br>
    Algernon, 24 December, 1857</b></h2>
  <p>IN the  study the three who entered found a waiting three. Beside the desk sat Lord  Lelanro, looking proud and happy, yet with a glint of uneasiness in his eyes as  they turned toward Warwick. Dr. Pryce, shifting some papers, bent beside him,  and some few paces beyond, Edgar Winyard, looking anxious and expectant, leaned  against the wall. The trio were evidently awaiting the arrival of Madam Tot and  the newly-pledged lovers.</p>
  <p>Into  the warmth and mellow light of the room came Warwick, with Celia on his arm;  but so moved was he by the communication of his kinship with the Lelanros, that  he stood stock-still at the door, gazing open-mouthed at those who waited.  Celia touched his arm softly to intimate that he should advance, but, finding  the hint unheeded, she led him forward to where her grandfather sat in the  great chair. Madam Tot, blithe as a lark, acted as mistress of ceremonies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo;  she said, looking up at the head of the family, &ldquo;all has gone as you wished.  They have plighted their faith to one another, and on her finger gleams the  ring of faery gold. He,&rdquo; she added, pointing an emphatic forefinger at Warwick,  &ldquo;now knows that he is your grandson, my grand-nephew, and heir to the title and  estates of the Lelanros. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  an exclamation of rage and astonishment, Winyard started forward to interrupt  the explanation of the dwarf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  foolery is this?&rdquo; said he, directly addressing his kinsman. &ldquo;Why does that  malicious monkey call that fellow your grandson and heir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  it is the truth, sir,&rdquo; replied Lelanro haughtily; &ldquo;and I advise you to be more  careful of your expressions in speaking of my sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  matter, brother; no matter,&rdquo; tittered Madam Tot, with a malignant smile. &ldquo;I can  listen now to his coarse tongue. Through me he has lost title and lands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  nodded with great satisfaction, and was rewarded with a black scowl from  Winyard, who began to think that, after all, there might be truth in her  speeches. By this time Warwick, who, out of sheer bewilderment, hitherto had  kept silent, recovered his tongue, and advanced impetuously towards Lelanro.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the meaning of all this, my lord?&rdquo; he demanded anxiously. &ldquo;Is it a jest to  amuse Madam Tot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the truth, Algernon,&rdquo; replied Lelanro, addressing the young man for the  first time by his name. &ldquo;You are indeed my grandson&mdash;the offspring of my  dwarfish son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that son died,&rdquo; stammered Warwick, looking at Pryce. &ldquo;I saw his grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true enough,&rdquo; answered Pryce, lifting his head. &ldquo;You saw his grave, but that  grave was empty. Albert Lelanro, who resembled that little creature, was not  buried there, but was taken away by Ballard and given to Autolycus. He, and not  the father of Miss Celia, was the heir to the estates. You, as his son, inherit  his rights, and will succeed to my lord. The grave was made, and the tombstone  erected, to avert unnecessary questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a lie!&rdquo; cried Edgar, bringing his fist down on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the truth,&rdquo; retorted Pryce, in as assertive a tone. &ldquo;If you doubt me, ask  your cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  pointed to Lord Lelanro, and Edgar would have immediately questioned him as to  the rights of Pryce&rsquo;s assertion, when Madam Tot, unused to neglect, bustled  forward and claimed the attention of the company.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lift  me up on that chair,&rdquo; she said to Warwick in a peremptory tone, &ldquo;and look over  my shoulder. I will now explain to you the riddle, and show you how to make  Lelanro out of Algernon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Burning  with curiosity, Warwick lifted her into the seat, and looked at the paper which  she spread out on the table. Edgar also came closer, in order to see if there  was truth in these unpleasant declarations which robbed him of his expected  heirship. Only Celia, her grandfather, and Dr. Pryce held aloof; they knew well  the reading of the riddle, and did not require to assist at the explanation.  With the two young men looking down at that fatal piece of paper, Madam Tot,  delighted at the prominent position she now occupied, deftly unravelled the  riddle which had perplexed Warwick for so long.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wonder, perhaps, why I guessed this the moment you gave it to me,&rdquo; said the  dwarf, with an upward glance at Warwick; &ldquo;but I would not have done it so  quickly had I not invented the riddle myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  invented it, Madam Tot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  You know I am fond of such things,&rdquo; replied the little lady, enjoying his  wonder. &ldquo;I invented&mdash;or rather selected this name, which, by transposing the  letters, contains our family title, Lelanro.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how do you know which letters to transpose?&rdquo; asked Warwick curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  take the figures of the date of birth and place the letters in that order,&rdquo;  said Madam Tot complacently, &ldquo;It is true that your father was born on the  twenty-fourth of December, 1847, so to make the letters transpose rightly, I  was forced to add ten years to that date, and bring it up to 1857.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  my father was forty-three when he died,&rdquo; cried Warwick, noting the figures.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  surely did not go by this paper and think he was thirty-three, did you?&rdquo; said  the dwarf contemptuously; &ldquo;in that case, according to your age, you were born  when your father was only eleven years of age, instead of which, at the date of  your birth he was rightfully twenty-one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  in itself is quite sufficient to show the falsity of the whole thing,&rdquo; said  Winyard savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of the sort, Mr. Winyard,&rdquo; retorted Warwick promptly. &ldquo;I did not know my father&rsquo;s  age, neither did he. Foolishly enough he believed this paper to be true, but as  he was a dwarf, and scarcely so keen-witted as other folk, you can hardly blame  him. I saw the flaw of which Madam Tot speaks long ago, and it was that which  made me doubt whether the truth was to be found on this paper. I am not so  foolish,&rdquo; added Warwick indignantly, &ldquo;as not to know that this is 1890, and  that if my father had been born in 1857 I could not possibly be his son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you see the explanation,&rdquo; said Madam Tot quickly. &ldquo;Your father was born in  1847, and you when he was twenty-one years of age.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see that; but how do you transpose the letters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madam  Tot placed before him a piece of paper, on which was written the name Algernon  and the date 24 December, 1857.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read  that as &lsquo;Algernon, 24, 12, 1857,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;substituting the twelfth month  for December. Now run all the figures together without division, and they read 24121857,  Now, Mr. Warwick. How many numbers are there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good.  And how many letters are there in the name Algernon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good.  And in the name Lealanro, going by the old way of spelling it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  right,&rdquo; said Madam Tot, delighted at the way in which he followed her  explanation. &ldquo;Now I apply the figures to the letters. The first number is two.  What is the secoud letter of the name Algernon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;L.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  The second figure is four. What is the fourth letter of the name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;E.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you are, Mr. Warwick: Le. Now the first letter, &lsquo;a&rsquo;; the second again, &lsquo;l&rsquo;; the  first once more, &lsquo;a&rsquo;; the eighth, &lsquo;n&rsquo;; the fifth, &lsquo;r&rsquo;; and the seventh, &lsquo;o.&rsquo;  Now what does the whole spell?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lealanro.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. Which is the old spelling of our name Lelanro,&rdquo; cried Madam Tot,  clapping her hands. &ldquo;I invented the name Algernon out of it by adding ten years  to the birth, as you see. Ballard found the paper in my chamber, and I have no  doubt he gave it to your father, quite ignorant of the hidden meaning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  could not sufficiently admire the ingenuity of the dwarf, and complimented her  highly, at which she was much gratified. Then it was true that his name was  Lelanro, and that he was the grandson of his patron. With a flush of joy  overspreading his face, he advanced towards his grandfather and held out his  hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am grateful, sir, that you have restored to me my name and rank,&rdquo; he said, in a  voice of emotion, &ldquo;but I can never be sufficiently grateful for your kindness  when I was a poor and unknown wanderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not believe a word of all this rubbish,&rdquo; broke out Winyard before Lord  Lelanro could reply, &ldquo;and I shall not submit to be robbed of my rights in this  manner. I shall go to law over it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will do no such thing, sir,&rdquo; retorted the old lord, in a stern tone which  quelled the fiery anger of the young man; &ldquo;this is a family matter and must be  settled here. Not a word must be breathed outside these walls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  so?&rdquo; demanded Edgar insolently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  the father of that lad was a dwarf,&rdquo; said Lelanro, pointing to Warwick. &ldquo;Do you  think for a moment that I will let you take this matter before the House of  Lords, and permit the secret of our family to be known? Never! You will abandon  all claims to my title and estate, and receive instead a yearly income to be  fixed by me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if I refuse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  dare not refuse,&rdquo; replied Lelanro, in a dangerously quiet tone; &ldquo;if you did  question the rights of your cousin, and shame our family by betraying the  secret of the dwarf&rsquo;s chamber, you would gain nothing but beggary. The proofs  which make Algernon Warwick the heir are too strong to be controverted. Show  him the papers, Pryce, and let him decide at once what course he intends to  take.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Edgar  turned sullenly towards Pryce, who spread out the papers for his inspection. &ldquo;The  first,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a certificate of the birth of Albert Lelanro, a dwarf,  given by my predecessor, Dr. Gulder, in 1847. The next a confession by Walter  Ballard, stating that he took the dwarf from here by order of my lord, and  disposed of him to one George Guss, a showman, commonly known as Autolycus. The  third is a statement by Autolycus, stating that he received the dwarf Albert  Lelanro from Ballard, and called him Algernon from that paper so often referred  to. Here is also the certificate of Albert Lelanro&rsquo;s marriage at the Church of  St. Martin in Canterbury, with Emily Marby, commonly known as the Fair  Circassian. Again, the certificate of birth, date 1868, of Algernon Lelanro,  now known as Algernon Warwick, and finally an affidavit sworn by Autolycus,  that Algernon Warwick is the son of the dwarf, Albert Lelanro. You will see,  Mr. Winyard, that not a link is missing, and that our friend Warwick is really  and truly the grandson of your kinsman, Lord Lelanro.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Winyard  could not deny that the proofs were plain enough, and stood sullenly looking at  his successful rival. Madam Tot clapped her hands with glee at the solution of  the mystery which had perplexed Warwick for so long, and then the latter spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  is it that Ballard took away my father from this place?&rdquo; he said, looking at  Lord Lelanro with eager curiosity.</p>
  <p>The  old man flushed with shame, and he hung his head before the gaze of his  grandson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was my fault,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice, &ldquo;and one for which I must ask your  pardon. Albert, your father, was my eldest son; but when he was pronounced a  dwarf I could not bear the idea that he should succeed to the title and  estates, which were rightfully his, nor did I think it wise that he should be  kept in the dwarf&rsquo;s chamber, lest he should be discovered by accident, and in  after years, on learning the truth, might insist on his rights. I therefore  gave him to Ballard to take away, and this was done. I did not intend to lose  sight of him, but Ballard disappeared, and I could not trace him. Then my  second son, Celia&rsquo;s father, was born, and I thought myself sure of a successor.  But he was killed, and my sin was brought home to me, for then there was no one  but Edgar to inherit. I tried to find out what had become of the dwarf Albert,  but could not discover a trace of him. Then you appeared opportunely, and when  you told your story I thought that the dwarf father you mentioned might be my  son. Aided by Pryce I went to work and learned all you have heard; but the  truth might have remained undiscovered, had not the landlady of the &lsquo;Lelanro  Arms &lsquo; brought to Dr. Pryce her brother&rsquo;s, confession.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was why Mistress Sally was in this study on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Dr. Pryce, taking up the story; &ldquo;she did not guess the truth, being in  ignorance of your story. But the question you put to her on that day made her  fearful of keeping the confession of her brother any longer, so she brought it  to me. It was then that Lord Lelanro and myself knew that you were none other  than the heir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you told me that Albert Lelanro was dead,&rdquo; said Warwick reproachfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  at the request of Lord Lelanro,&rdquo; said Pryce rather shamefacedly. &ldquo;You must  forgive me for that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not want you to know the truth till I had proved you,&rdquo; said Lelanro  quickly. &ldquo;Had you been a boor, an untutored clown, I might have held my peace,  but when I saw you so clever, so well-bred, so handsome; in a word, so well  fitted to be my heir, I determined to reinstate you in your rightful position. I  have erred, Algernon,&rdquo; he added looking steadily at his grandson, &ldquo;but it was  for the honour of the family, and you must forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Warwick  held out his hand, too delighted at his good fortune to bear malice at such a  moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do forgive you, and Pryce also,&rdquo; he said heartily. &ldquo;I would indeed be  ungrateful did I withhold forgiveness after all your kindness to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old lord took the lad&rsquo;s hand and placed it in that of Celia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,  perhaps, will seal your forgiveness,&rdquo; he said, with a smile.</p>
  <p>Edgar  cast one look of hatred on the lovers, and fled from the room, pursued by the  mocking laughter of the dwarf.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="dwarf_XXI"></a>Chapter XXI<br>
    An Important Communication</b></h2>
  <p>ABOUT  two years after the events heretofore recorded, Warwick&mdash;as Celia continued to  call him&mdash;had occasion to write to his grandfather, who was then in Paris.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  regret to hear,&rdquo; he wrote among other things, &ldquo;that Winyard is dead. He did not  live long to enjoy the income you so kindly allowed him, and I am afraid it was  my succession to his place of your heir, that induced him to take to the  dissipated courses which have now terminated in his death by his own hand. But  if you, my dear grandfather, write about the end of one life, I have  information to impart concerning the beginning of another. Celia has just  confided to me that she trusts shortly to become a mother, and I am in great  hopes that it will be a son, so that the direct succession may be secured.</p>
  <p>As  is natural, I cannot help wondering if I shall be the father of a dwarf. My  father was one, as you know, so it is not improbable that the hereditary taint  will reappear in the person of my son or daughter. I trust that this will not  be so, and that it may be many a long day before the dwarf&rsquo;s chamber is  provided with another tenant. Still, I am anxious, and I shall continue to be  so until the matter is proved otherwise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Several  times I have consulted with Pryce, but medical science can give us no aid. Some  taint in our blood induces the reappearance of these extraordinary beings at  irregular intervals; but Pryce suggests that, as your generation produced Madam  Tot, and the succeeding one my father, it is not improbable that, my own  generation being free, the next one may be the same. How thankful both I and  Celia shall be if our expected child proves to be free from this terrible  curse! So terrible does it seem to me, that I often question whether it was  wise for you to lift me from my obscurity and let me marry Celia. If Winyard  had succeeded to the estates, being a distant relation, the taint might have  disappeared in his children; but Celia and myself being in the direct line, I  dread the worst.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  being the case, I should like you to come back at your earliest convenience, in  order to discuss the matter. If a dwarf is born, are we justified in shutting  up the unfortunate creature in the chamber? It seems to me to be rather cruel,  for though Madam Tot appears to be happy and content, yet she pines at times  for a breath of the outer world. Again, if our dwarfs were ugly monstrosities I  could understand the reason of their seclusion; but they are so perfectly made,  so intelligent, so attractive in every sense of the word that, beyond the fact  of their tiny size, I see no reason why our family should not openly avow their  existence. This point will bear a great deal of discussion, though, perhaps, it  may not be raised, as there is no use anticipating trouble, and the future  generation may be free from the taint.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;During  your absence I have amused myself by writing a record of my adventures from the  time I arrived, footsore and hungry, at Dalesford. It is astonishing how  interesting they prove to be, for the whole circumstances with which I was  brought into contact are so odd, that were they set forth in a novel, I doubt  whether they would gain credence. People would deny the existence of our  hereditary taint; they would scout the idea of a dwarf&rsquo;s chamber of a tiny size  and furnished, as is Madam Tot&rsquo;s, with doll&rsquo;s tables and chairs. No doubt they  would laugh to scorn her fanciful ideas regarding faeries and gnomes, and  ascribe them to insanity. As we know, this is not the case, for her fantasies  are but the result of an over-vivid imagination, and her brain is as clear as  crystal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mistress  Sally remains as ever my very good friend, and I rarely ride past the &lsquo;Lelanro  Arms&rsquo; without pausing for a tankard of her famous ale, and a few minutes&rsquo;  gossip. As you may remember, she was greatly amazed at my proving to be the  heir to your name, and, notwithstanding our care in concealing the truth, she  shrewdly suspects that I am the son of the dwarf who was taken away by her  brother. But in spite of her garrulity, she is as close as the grave on this  one point which affects our honour, and never by word or deed hints that she  knows of the secret chamber, or of the race of dwarfs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have often talked to Madam Tot about that ingenious puzzle which she  constructed out of our name. Had she only been able to do so without altering  the date of birth, I&mdash;might have discovered the truth sooner. As it was, the  taking of ten years from my father&rsquo;s life threw me all out; and, indeed, I have  often questioned myself as to whether, under the circumstances, I could  possibly be his son. Of course the adding of ten years proves that I was born  when he was twenty-one, instead of at the absurd age of eleven; so I am now  fully convinced to the contrary. Yet had not Madam Tot been present at that  important interview to explain her alteration of the date, grave complications  might have arisen concerning my identity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is just the same good little creature, as full of fancies and faery ideas as  ever. I play my violin often to her and then she is happy, while it is  ridiculous the care the tiny creature takes of Celia, who towers above her. She  passes most of her days in the summer-house, for she is much less inclined to  join in the faery revels than aforetime. There I found her yesterday weeping  bitterly, and after some persuasion she confided to me the cause of her  trouble.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  had hoped,&rsquo; she said mysteriously, &lsquo;that Oberon would have sent you and Celia a  faery changeling like myself so as to make you happy, but he will not do so.  Yesterday the little red gnome told me that the King of Faery had decided to  leave the human child and not replace it by a faery infant. So your child will  grow into a man mountain like yourself, and I who hoped for a faery playfellow  will be left desolate.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Though  this was but a fantasy of her brain, I was secretly glad to hear it, and I  trust that her prophecy may come true. Indeed, she says that when she dies, the  dwarfs chamber will be shut up, for Oberon, irritated at the way in which you  sent your son out of the house, had decided to give no more changelings to the  Lelanro family. Nay, more, he will signify his intention by taking back again  to faeryland the charmed cup which Sir James Lelanro stole from the little  people. But Madam Tot seems to have forgotten that the cup is not now in the  possession of our family.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  such fancies does Madam Tot beguile her weary days, and I am afraid she will  not live long. How happy would I be could I think she was likely to be the last  dwarf of our family; but I am by no means hopeful. Both from a faery and  scientific point of view, we are ignorant of the matter, and it must be left in  the hands of Providence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now, my dear grandfather, I trust you will return soon and see me about these  matters. Celia and Madam Tot send their dear love, and I remain, as ever,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  dutiful and affectionate Grandson,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Algernon  Lelanro.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="miss_j"></a><a href="#"></a>Miss  Jonathan</b><br>
<b>Chapter I</b></h2>
  <p>THE  United States has succeeded in creating a unique type of female beauty. Such  causes as climatic influence, mixture of race, social developments on the  dollar basis, and the equality of the sexes have resulted in the formation of  that charming being&mdash;the American girl. The Tree of Liberty planted by George  Washington in lieu of the cherry-tree he cut down has borne the blossom of Miss  Jonathan. She is indigenous to the soil of Manhattan, Boston, and the City of  the Capitol, and may be called the new Eve of a special race of the distaff  order. Her Adam is selected by preference from the English Peerage. <i>Aut Caesar, aut nullus</i>.</p>
  <p>The  apparent fragility of Miss Jonathan conceals a constitution of iron, her frothy  conversation hides a &lsquo;cute intellect. She can dance all night, ride, walk,  swim, play, and flirt all day, without dimming the brilliancy of her colouring  or dulling the edge of her wit. Enhancing her piquant beauty by perfect  costumes, she invariably contrives to interest the other sex by the charm of  her manner. Her sole defect is a liability to neurosis, which entails premature  old age, but this very defect in many cases is the cause of her preternatural  brilliancy. Take her for all in all, she is a smart angel. No other collocation  of words can express Miss Jonathan.</p>
  <p>This  description in the abstract is a characterization of Matty Kierman in the  concrete. She was a typical American girl, and as attractive a specimen as  could be found. Her beauty was great, her charm of manner greater, her astucity  of character greatest of all. A very April was she for smiles and tears, and unexpected  changes of temperament. Like a bee, she could sting&mdash;with glances and words;  like a bee she could make honey&mdash;the honey of conversation and charm. These two  qualities she exercised impartially, and by tossing men betwixt such extremes  in shuttlecock fashion she managed to secure a horde of distracted lovers. Can  you wonder at her success?</p>
  <p>The  female composite of oppositional qualities is always attractive to the male. By  the rapidity with which she can pass from one phase to the other&mdash;from sweetness  to acidity, from frowns to smiles&mdash;she keeps him in a constant state of alarm  and fearful pleasure. He woos danger, as it were, at the cannon&rsquo;s mouth. A  careless word ignites the powder, and his hopes, his pleasures, and his  comfortable assurance are shattered on the instant. He has scarce time to  contemplate one side of her character before she presents him with another. So  Cleopatra held chained the fickle Anthony. Novelty never stales, nor do  surprises weary.</p>
  <p>At  Newport, Mrs. Scheveningen took upon herself to read Matty a lecture. This  matron was thirty-five years of age, experienced in social observances, and in  the intricacies of the masculine character. She had not experimented with Mr.  Scheveningen&rsquo;s heart fifteen years before without knowing something of the  organ. Her learning instructed her how far she could advance into the enemy&rsquo;s  camp without cutting off her retreat. In plain English, she knew how to  manipulate the characters of men when rendered workable by love. This notable  information she imparted to Matty. The maid, wise in the conceit of twenty  years, did not take kindly to the instruction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not that I mind your flirting,&rdquo; said Mrs. Scheveningen, frankly; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no  harm in that, though it is playing with fire. Men can look after themselves,  and their hearts are tough enough where their vanity is concerned. But if you  mean business you must be careful. Now, there&rsquo;s Silas Winter, who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to marry him,&rdquo; interrupted Matty, pursing up her lips; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a dude.  I don&rsquo;t like dudes, they&rsquo;re so dreadfully like women. Dress, and scent, and  lisp, and vanity! How can you advise me to marry such a creature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is rich, you wretched girl, and you have no money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have enough to live on,&rdquo; replied Matty, carelessly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;d  marry your Winter creature for a home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must marry for something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll marry for love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sentiment!&rdquo;  groaned Mrs. Scheveningen, lifting her hands; &ldquo;and your face is your fortune.  You ought to marry a rich man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you call Silas Winter a man?&rdquo; said Matty, scornfully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear, he is rich, and he loves you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  always two to a bargain,&rdquo; rejoined Miss Kierman, calmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not rich, and I  don&rsquo;t love him. When I marry,&rdquo; continued she, with increasing colour, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  marry a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Scheveningen arose from her chair, and approaching Matty, tapped the tell-tale  cheek. Then she kissed her visitor warmly, and began to ask questions. The  situation explained itself between them without a word. At times the peculiar  feminine faculty of intuition amounts to genius.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is his name, dear?&rdquo; asked the elderly lady, insinuatingly. &ldquo;Who have you in  your mind&rsquo;s eye?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  answer, Matty led her questioner to a table, and pointed to a silver-framed  portrait, full length, of a young man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have that person in my mind&rsquo;s eye,&rdquo; said she, with a roguish glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My!&rdquo;  ejaculated Mrs. Scheveningen, taking stock of the photograph. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your cousin!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is my cousin, Leonard Conway, of The Firs, Kent, England,&rdquo; asserted Matty,  nodding her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with him. Hasn&rsquo;t he a noble brow? Isn&rsquo;t his  figure like that of The Dying Gladiator? And his face, my dear, perfect! Do you  think he and Silas belong to the same species? I don&rsquo;t. Or else the monkey has  not yet merged in the man. Silas is only the missing link so far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  she had digested these enthusiasms, Mrs. Scheveningen returned to her seat, and  entered a protest against them. It took her some time to recover her breath for  the purpose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Matty  Kierman, you can&rsquo;t be in love with a man whom you&rsquo;ve never seen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? There no law against it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  may be a fool!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  with that brow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt he has a bad temper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  that mouth, impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yery  likely he isn&rsquo;t a marrying man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Matty  looked at her piquant face in the mirror, was satisfied with the reflection,  and smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  long as he isn&rsquo;t married, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said she, touching a little curl  on her forehead. She was a young lady with an excellent opinion of her charms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  conceited little thing,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Scheveningen, &ldquo;do you think you can make  him fall in love with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  try, anyhow! That is, if I like him. All your objections are fair enough. I  shouldn&rsquo;t fall in love with a phantom; but as I&rsquo;m going over to England this  fall, I&rsquo;ll see my phantom in the flesh. If I find him desirable, I&rsquo;ll see if he  is a Saint Anthony, which he isn&rsquo;t with those eyes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Scheveningen began to laugh. Something struck her as excessively ridiculous; but  what it was Matty could not conceive, and she was curious accordingly. She  shook her friend in pretended anger, then kissed and coaxed her, and used  innumerable arts to learn the cause of such laughter. In the end Mrs.  Scheveningen wiped her eyes of their merry tears, and produced a letter. This  she shook at Matty in playful warning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will share the fate of Bluebeard&rsquo;s wife, you shall know all,&rdquo; said she,  solemnly. &ldquo;I have Leonard Conway&rsquo;s private opinion of you in this letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can he have an opinion of me when he doesn&rsquo;t know me and hasn&rsquo;t set eyes on me?  And how can you know his private opinion when he&rsquo;s an absolute stranger to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is easily explained,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Scheveningen, opening the letter. &ldquo;When I  heard that you were going over to The Firs this fall, I wrote to Minnie Dawson,  and asked her about the Conways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could have saved you the trouble,&rdquo; retorted Matty, disdainfully; &ldquo;they are our  cousins a hundred times removed. A Conway settled here about the time of the  Revolution. My mother is his descendant, and as the English Conways condescend  to acknowledge me as a relation, they have asked me to spend a few months in  the old country. They know nothing about me, and I have no doubt they are in a  state of mortal terror as to what kind of creature I may prove to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Scheveningen listened to this speech with an ostentatious air of polite  interest, but paid no attention to the information conveyed therein. On the  contrary, when Matty ended, she blandly took up the thread of her discourse  where she had dropped it a minute or so before. Matty felt inclined to slap her  friend for such indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was at school in England, you know,&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Scheveningen, sweetly, &ldquo;and  Minnie Dawson&mdash;then Minnie Butler&mdash;was the only English girl I ever liked. We are  bosom friends, and have corresponded for years. She knows Leonard Conway  intimately, so to post you up in all his idiosyncrasies I wrote for a detailed  report of his character. Here is Minnie&rsquo;s reply.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am all attention,&rdquo; said Matty, with a faint show of curiosity. She really  desired to know something of this unknown cousin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;You  ask me about Leonard Conway,&rsquo; &rdquo; read Mrs. Scheveningen, holding the letter  close to her nose; &ldquo; &lsquo;he is handsome, rich, talented, and, I am afraid, a  trifle priggish.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me the American translation of the last word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  prig,&rdquo; said the reader, thoughtfully, &ldquo;is a person who thinks himself  perfection, and who ostentatiously reveals his thoughts. A prig is an  intellectual Pharisee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have met creatures of that type,&rdquo; remarked Miss Kierman. &ldquo;New York is full of  them. What a nasty person your Minnie is to say that my cousin is priggish! I  don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Minnie  also says that Mr. Conway told her that you were coming, and what he thought  you would be like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Conway has doubtless created a monster after the fashion of Frankenstein!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Scheveningen, vivaciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  is your picture as a monster, my love. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  it in full,&rdquo; interrupted Matty, calmly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind how uncomplimentary it  is. I&rsquo;ll punish him some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Mr.  Conway told me that his cousin, Miss Kierman, was coming over,&rsquo; &rdquo; resumed Mrs.  Scheveningen, picking up her letter, &ldquo; &lsquo;and that he rather dreaded her coming.  He is so ignorant of American girls, my dear, that he fancies the girl of  fiction to be a true representation of the girl of reality. &ldquo;She will no doubt  use American slang,&rdquo; he said, referring to his cousin, &ldquo;and smoke cigarettes,  and flirt with a strong accent. No doubt she will hunt for a title, and  purchase a Peerage with her money.&rdquo; I strove to reassure him, but he persisted  in considering his cousin as a girl like Fuschia Leach in Ouida&rsquo;s novel. As a  rule he is reticent, and only our long friendship would have caused him to  speak freely. As Miss Kierman is a friend of yours, I am sure she is not what  Mr. Conway&rsquo;s fancy paints her. But these are his opinions. I am afraid he is  prejudiced against American girls.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>Matty  made no comment on this letter for the moment, but walked slowly towards the  window, with a smile on her lips. Then she turned to Mrs. Scheveningen with a  flush on her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess I&rsquo;ll make him sit up all round for that,&rdquo; she said, with a strong  American accent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Matty,  don&rsquo;t speak in that horrid Yankee manner,&rdquo; said Mrs. Scheveningen, in dismay. &ldquo;It  is the kind of way in which he expects you to talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a fact, anyhow,&rdquo; replied Matty, still affecting the American girl of fiction. &ldquo;What  he expects, that shall he have. I&rsquo;ll be the Fuschia Leach of real life. I&rsquo;ll  talk slang with an accent. I&rsquo;ll dress like an angel, and get round freely.  Cigarettes I&rsquo;ll smoke, though I hate them. My cousin shall see me just as his  fancy paints me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case you&rsquo;ll be back here in a month,&rdquo; said Mrs. Scheveningen, resignedly. &ldquo;I  never heard of such a mad idea. He&rsquo;ll simply detest you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Miss Kierman, determinedly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll fall in love with me,  notwithstanding my slang, my cigarettes, and my accent. Then I&rsquo;ll show myself  in my true colours and refuse to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  never gain him by showing the worst side of yourself, Matty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  try, at all events. My turquoise brooch against your ruby ring that I succeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I shan&rsquo;t encourage such mad folly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  afraid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  book the bet,&rdquo; said Matty smartly. &ldquo;I want your ruby ring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Scheveningen laughed, and ultimately yielded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, dear, I agree. But you&rsquo;ll lose your brooch, or else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  or else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  win my ring, and marry your cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I may win your ring, but I&rsquo;ll never marry a man who holds such opinions. Now,  good-bye, dear; I&rsquo;m going to buy <i>Moths</i>,  and study the part of Fuschia Leach.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Chapter II</b></h2>
  <p>THAT  Christmas Miss Kierman was the life and soul of the house-party at The Firs.  None of the solemn English people there assembled had met before with a  novelist&rsquo;s creation in the flesh, and they were startled and charmed  alternately. The men were enchanted, the women horrified. She charmed the first  by her beauty and vivacity; she alarmed the last by her freedom of speech and  disdain of conventionality. A new dictionary was required to explain the recondite  words which issued from her pretty lips. The possession of a fortune was  necessary to account for the splendour of her dresses. Perhaps Mrs.  Scheveningen could have explained this last, as she had financed Matty to a  considerable extent. But Mrs. Scheveningen was in New York, and in default of  enlightenment the house-party credited Matty with a large income. Such  fictitious wealth added to her charm.</p>
  <p>Leonard  Conway was half pleased, half vexed with his cousin. It was gratifying to his  perspicuity to see that he had not been mistaken in his estimate of her  character, appearance, demeanour, and behaviour. It was irritating that one so  utterly at variance with his ideal of female excellence should be so  attractive. Despite his thirty years, and knowledge of the world, and high  standard as to what qualities were requisite for a wife, Leonard found himself  strongly drawn towards this scatterbrain creature, who satisfied him on no  point, yet attracted him on all. To his mind she was the feminine counterpart  of the contradictory man in Martial&rsquo;s epigram. He explained this after his own  fashion to Mrs. Conway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like her, and yet I do like her, mother,&rdquo; he said, one day when Matty had  been particularly aggravating. &ldquo;She sets my teeth on edge with her slang one  minute, and charms me in spite of myself the next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is full of contradictory qualities,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Conway, who always agreed  with her idol Leonard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never met with the species before, so I can&rsquo;t classify her,&rdquo; said Leonard, in a  vexed tone. &ldquo;She puts me in mind of Heine&rsquo;s Sphinx. Her mouth caresses, her  claws wound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Leonard!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be shocked, mother. I only speak figuratively. You wouldn&rsquo;t like her for a  daughter-in-law, I suppose?&rdquo; he added, looking up suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I certainly should not,&rdquo; answered his mother, decisively. &ldquo;She would not make  you happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, she would&mdash;for a minute, and the next put me out of temper. But you need  not be afraid, mother; my head can look after my heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you would marry Isabella Montray,&rdquo; said Mrs. Conway, plaintively; &ldquo;she is  such a thoroughly good girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  such a thoroughly dull girl,&rdquo; retorted Conway. &ldquo;No, thank you, mother; I don&rsquo;t  want to go to the other extreme. If I could only find the happy medium between  Matty and Miss Montray, I should discover an ideal wife. The vivacity and  beauty of the one would go excellently with the pure English and good-breeding  of the other. But I am not likely to find such a combination,&rdquo; he finished,  with a sigh.</p>
  <p>In  point of fact, he was more attracted by Matty than he chose to acknowledge,  even to himself. She filled a void in his life, if not in a satisfactory  manner, at least in a way which showed him that he would never be happy without  her. On the other hand, he could never be happy with her. Altogether the  situation was unsatisfactory. He wished she would depart, then he hoped she  would remain. He sought her society one day, and resolutely avoided her the  next. It was most perplexing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish she would marry Kendrick and go away,&rdquo; he groaned in bitterness of spirit.  &ldquo;Those sort of girls always want a title. Kendrick would just suit her, and yet  who could wish her tied to such an idiot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was unjust. Lord Kendrick was shallow, but by no means an idiot. He was not  cultured, but he held his own in all out-door sports. He could shoot, fish,  ride, and row admirably; moreover, his skill at billiards was undeniable, and  he could dance exceedingly well. If not an Adonis, he was at least  good-looking. If not a Chesterfield, he possessed an average amount of  good-breeding, and his title and fortune covered the multitude of his sins.  That evening Matty spoke about him to her cousin. She could hardly fail to see  that both men were in love with her; therefore she played off one against the  other in her usual fashion. The comedy amused her greatly.</p>
  <p>There  was a ball taking place at The Firs. From far and near the provincials came to  partake of Conway&rsquo;s hospitality. He was greatly liked and respected in his  county, and had in him the making of a future Lord-Lieutenant. Looking at the  brilliant throng of his friends in the ball-room, and knowing how popular he  was with them all, confident in the possession of money, health, good looks,  and youth, he should have been supremely happy. Yet he was the reverse at this  moment, for Matty was playing off her witcheries at his elbow. Alternately she  shocked and charmed him. One moment he could have kissed her, the next he felt  a mad desire to shake her thoroughly. Matty guessed the duality of his  feelings, and perversely accentuated her assumed manner. She impaled her victim  on a pin, and watched him writhe with complacent satisfaction. &ldquo;Sweet is  revenge, especially to women.&rdquo; Who dare deny Byron&rsquo;s knowledge of the sex?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  Kendrick&rsquo;s spry in the leg line, I guess,&rdquo; she said, watching the energetic  revolutions of her titled lover. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as lively as a woodchuck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He  certainly puts his heart into his work,&rdquo; replied Leonard, coldly, &ldquo;but to dance  with one woman and to look at another at the same time is hardly likely to be  successful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a fact, anyhow. He&rsquo;s been sharp-shootin&rsquo; at me all night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you like him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some,  He&rsquo;s real sweet, and I love him hard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say much for your taste,&rdquo; said Leonard, taking advantage of his  cousinship to be rude. He felt that the remark was abominable; but Matty  exasperated him so much that he could not help putting his thoughts into words.  She guessed that his observation was wrung from him against his will, and only  laughed at his petulance. Had Silas Winter spoken so, she would never have  forgiven him; but it suited the requirements of her comedy to allow Leonard  free speech, therefore she rejoined smartly, in the same strain&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess you don&rsquo;t like my taste, or anything else Amurican.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon; I was rude. You know I like you, cousin Matty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Kierman measured off an inch on her fan to illustrate her next remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t cotton to me that much,&rdquo; said she, solemnly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your style, cousin  Leonard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I get you any refreshment?&rdquo; said Leonard, determined not to be drawn into an  argument.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!  I&rsquo;m pretty crowded, but I can squeeze another ice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leonard  winced. Her slang grated on his ears. Matty saw his repugnance to her imagery,  and smiled behind her fan. Unfortunately it was transparent, and Leonard saw  the smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you laughing at?&rdquo; he asked, as they elbowed their way to the supper-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  your gettin&rsquo; on stilts,&rdquo; she retorted, coolly. &ldquo;Sakes alive! you&rsquo;re as prim as  a school-marm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  evidently do not find favour in your eyes,&rdquo; he said, in a piqued tone. &ldquo;Of  course, I&rsquo;m not Lord Kendrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess that&rsquo;s so! He makes things hum when he spreads himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I&mdash;er&mdash;spread myself?&rdquo; asked Leonard, delicately. Matty paused, with a spoonful  of ice on its way to her mouth, and laughed gaily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not that sort! My! you are stiff! Why don&rsquo;t you marry that Montray girl? She&rsquo;s  your style!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is not my style,&rdquo; rejoined Leonard, with some heat. &ldquo;I prefer infinitely to be  with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  that&rsquo;s a pop, it&rsquo;s no go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, Matty?&rdquo; he asked, considerably taken aback.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean that I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to hook a Lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  need not put it so plainly, at all events,&rdquo; said Leonard, with strong  displeasure. &ldquo;My remark was not a pop, as you call it. Let me take you back to  the ball-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  passage of arms thus terminating, Conway resolutely evaded his cousin for the  rest of the night. The bittersweet pleasure to be obtained by dancing at her  heels was becoming so necessary to him as to be dangerous. In vain he told  himself that she was full of imperfections, that he could not possibly be happy  with so capricious a wife, that she would be a plaything for him rather than a  companion; all these strong arguments were nothing when opposed to the  overwhelming strength of the passion growing up in his heart. He became  mortally jealous of Kendrick, and was positively offensive to that well-meaning  young man for daring to hint that he admired Matty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  call Miss Kierman positively rippin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Kendrick, as they sat in a corner  of the smoking-room. &ldquo;She understands a fellow so well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shouldn&rsquo;t think you were very difficult of comprehension, Kendrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  I don&rsquo;t mind your sarcasms, Conway,&rdquo; replied the young man, good-humouredly. &ldquo;I  know you are cleverer than I am. I could never come within miles of you either  at Eton or Christchurch, but at least I know as much about women as you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leonard  knew that Kendrick&rsquo;s career had been anything but creditable since he had left  college, and felt inclined to retort sharply. Happily, his position as host and  a sense of good-breeding restrained him from such folly. He merely nodded his  head, and smoked on in grim silence, while Kendrick rambled aimlessly on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  marry one of those advanced women, I dare say, Conway, I can&rsquo;t bear &lsquo;em. There  was one after me the other day who talked astronomy. She said the stars were  ruled by the law of attraction, and that human beings were like stars. I saw  pretty well what she meant, and got away from her. She didn&rsquo;t attract me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  Miss Kierman attract you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should just think so,&rdquo; replied Kendrick, with simple enthusiasm. &ldquo;She can talk  to a fellow about things he knows. I like the way she puts things; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you refer to her American expressions, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  you&rsquo;re so particular, Conway. A man can&rsquo;t be always talking by the book. I like  Miss Kierman&rsquo;s way of talking, and I like her. We jump together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  one of her elegancies, I presume.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Good, isn&rsquo;t it? Oh! she&rsquo;s no end of fun! How long does she stay in England?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till  next August, I believe. She wants to have a season in town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad of that,&rdquo; said Kendrick, half to himself; &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be a chance for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this remark Leonard knew that his friend contemplated matrimony. The idea  displeased him greatly.</p>
  <p>He  could not make up his mind to marry his cousin himself, yet he did not relish  seeing her the wife of another. There was a good deal of the dog-in-the-manger  about Leonard at that time. He knew that from a worldly point of view he had no  chance against Kendrick, and felt enraged that she might choose to accept the  young Lord. Perhaps his doubts might have been set at rest had he heard Matty  talking to Mrs. Dawson in the seclusion of her bedroom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, when Julia Scheveningen told me of your absurd plot I disapproved of  it,&rdquo; said the latter: &ldquo;and I do so more than ever. You ought to show yourself  in your true colours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I shan&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; said Matty, obstinately. &ldquo;I came here with a certain  purpose, and I intend to carry it out. Leonard must be punished for the opinion  he expressed to you about me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish Julia had not shown you that foolish letter, Matty. I suppose you don&rsquo;t  intend to act this slangy part all your life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. When I make Leonard propose to me, slang and all, I&rsquo;ll tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  never propose to you in such a character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, he will! He&rsquo;s on the high road to a proposal now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  is Lord Kendrick,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dawson, mischievously. &ldquo;He has a title, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t marry him for fifty titles,&rdquo; interrupted Matty fiercely. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very  nice and kind, but, oh! so dull. Leonard is worth a dozen of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you love your cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Matty  made no reply, but pushed Mrs. Dawson out of the room. The remark was a true  one, but she was not going to strike her colours by confessing it to be so. In  her heart she was weary of the ridiculous comedy she was playing, and longed to  show Leonard that she was not a slangy, fast piece of vivacity, but a clever,  cultured, and well-bred girl. Yet with inconceivable obstinacy she persisted in  wearing the mask. But even if she did not, and he proposed?&mdash;&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll  marry him after all,&rdquo; she said, crossly, and went to bed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Chapter III</b></h2>
  <p>THE  next season Matty carried the Stars and Stripes triumphantly through Belgravia  and Mayfair. Mrs. Conway was astonished and somewhat dismayed by the social  success of the young lady whom she had undertaken to chaperon. Of a quiet and  retiring disposition, she was overwhelmed by her sudden access of popularity as  the guardian of Matty. Dozens of young men besieged her for introductions to  the American heiress, and her visiting list doubled itself during her stay in  town. Miss Jonathan, as some wit christened Matty, was decidedly the queen of  the hour. Wherever she went she was surrounded by a court of admirers, who  repeated her sayings and basked in the sunshine of her smiles. The triumphs of  New York were repeated in London on a larger scale. Matty bore her honours with  saucy dignity, and had&mdash;as she termed it in her choice vernacular&mdash;&ldquo;a real good  time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  caught on in the old country,&rdquo; she wrote rapturously to Mrs. Scheveningen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  just too lovely for anything! I believe it is within the limits of probability  that I can become a Peeress. Dukes are expensive articles, and beyond my purse,  but there is a certain Lord Kendrick who wants to marry me. He hasn&rsquo;t spoken  yet, but you know how easy it is to tell when a man&rsquo;s in that state of mind. He  is always by my side, and smiles and looks silly when I glance at him. The  other one does nothing but scowl. You know whom I mean. He is in a great rage  with me, which promises well for my little scheme. I am certain he also is on  the marrying tack. I fancy that ruby ring of yours will look very well on my  finger. But enough of men. Let me tell you of the fashionable frocks. They are worn&mdash;&rdquo;  and from discussing her position Matty drifted into masses of millinery and  elaborate explanations.</p>
  <p>From  her letter it could be seen how delicate was her position. Both Kendrick and  Leonard were more than ever in love with her, and showed their passions in  different ways. The one smiled, and followed Matty about like a poodle; the  other stood aloof, and looked on gloomily at the triumphs she was winning in  the fashionable world. Many a time did Matty wish to tell him all, and so put  an end to the embarrassing situation, but her foolish pride stood in the way of  her doing so. Long ago she had confessed to Mrs. Dawson that she loved Leonard,  but she declined to take that lady&rsquo;s advice, which was short and to the point.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explain,  and marry him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dawson, wisely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can I when he won&rsquo;t propose replied Matty, tearfully. &ldquo;He keeps away from me as  though I had the plague.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t propose so long as he thinks you are what you show yourself to be.  Display your true colours, my dear, and you will become Mrs. Conway in a  remarkably short space of time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I won&rsquo;t let him triumph over me in that way!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  give up all idea of your cousin, and marry Lord Kendrick,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dawson,  tartly.</p>
  <p>She  was seriously angry at Matty&rsquo;s perversity in keeping up the deception. Leonard  was a great favourite with her, and she could not bear to see him so unhappy,  when a single word on the part of Matty would have put things in a proper  light. But that she had promised Matty to keep silent, she would have told him  herself of the comedy his cousin was playing. This, however, she could not do,  and she found relief in scolding Matty for her folly. Meanwhile, Miss Jonathan  pursued her triumphant way, attended by the smiling Kendrick and the scowling  Leonard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be real mad at goin&rsquo; back to New York city,&rdquo; said Matty to her cousin at  the last garden party of the season; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s vury necessary that I should  recross the herring-pond.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that matter rests entirely with yourself,&rdquo; replied Leonard,  significantly.</p>
  <p>With  a sudden access of colour, Matty looked up at his face, but she saw that his  eyes were fixed on Kendrick, who hovered round Mrs. Conway some distance off.  The mistake annoyed her immensely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess you&rsquo;re too deep for me,&rdquo; she said, in pretended grievance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not usually find me so. Permit me to recall your remark that you intended to  marry a title. I think you are within reasonable distance of realizing your ambition.  Now, if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess Lord Kendrick can do his own courtin&rsquo;, without you chippin&rsquo; in,&rdquo; said Matty,  dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no wish to do so, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  you do get on stilts, cousin Leonard!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  you do tease me, cousin Matty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  looked at each other and smiled. Had they only been left alone at that moment,  it is probable they would have come to an understanding; but Fate, desirous of  protracting the misconception, sent Kendrick to interrupt them. He had been  eying them jealously for some time, and found comfort in the thought that they  were quarrelling as usual; but when he saw Matty smiling on her cousin, he  could bear it no longer, and so came forward as a spoilsport. Matty laughed at  the sulky expression of his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess you&rsquo;ve lost a dollar and picked up a cent,&rdquo; said she smartly. &ldquo;You do  look cross!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I am quite amiable, I assure you,&rdquo; replied Kendrick, with elaborate courtesy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Schucks!&rdquo;  said Matty, disdainfully. &ldquo;I can see without glasses, some.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leonard  looked at the pair with a reflective eye. So far as he could see, Matty had  quite made up her mind to be Lady Kendrick. The idea of losing her made him  wrathful. Notwithstanding her accent, her slang, her freedom, her want of  repose, and of many feminine traits which he valued highly, he was deeply in  love with her. There was something about Matty which he could not understand. At  times she forgot to play her part in the comedy, and on such occasions Leonard  had been charmed and fascinated beyond all expression. A chance word, a sudden  glance, a womanly action&mdash;all these betrayed a deeper nature hidden under the  frivolity of her exterior. But such words were rare, and just when he began to  wax sympathetic, she would flash back into the wayward Society beauty all  sparkle and surface brilliance. Then he was puzzled and angered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is like a diamond,&rdquo; he thought, strolling away and leaving her with Kendrick; &ldquo;as  brilliant and as hard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Conway, come and sit by me. I wish to speak with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned and saw Mrs. Dawson tapping a chair with the ferrule of her parasol.  Knowing she was a sympathetic soul, to whom he could freely confide his  troubles, he accepted her invitation readily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you are amused with this entertainment,&rdquo; said he, in a conventional  manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am more amused with that entertainment,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Dawson, glancing towards  Matty and her attendant cavalier.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you? I am not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would be more than human if you were, Mr. Conway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I blind? Am I a fool?&rdquo; said Mrs. Dawson, impatiently; &ldquo;or are you an ostrich,  burying your head in the sand, under the delusion that no one can see you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo;  replied Leonard, after a pause. &ldquo;But I did not know that my passion was so  patent to all the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I all the world?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a representative.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you marry her?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Dawson, abruptly.</p>
  <p>Leonard  reddened, pulled his moustache, and answered&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  won&rsquo;t have me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put  her to the test.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no chance against Kendrick,&rdquo; replied Conway, savagely. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a title.  Besides, much as I admire my cousin, she&mdash;she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  I know all about that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dawson, cutting him short. &ldquo;She falls short  of your standard of feminine excellence. I remember the picture you painted of  her last year, and how you expressed your detestation of the American girl.  Well, she is as you see&mdash;faulty, but charming. Yet, if you are in love with her,  don&rsquo;t let Kendrick carry her off. Marry her yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me tell you a parable, Mr. Conway. A certain man picked up a glittering stone.  Said he, &lsquo;It glitters and glitters, but it&rsquo;s only a piece of glass after all,  and not worth keeping.&rsquo; Then he threw it away, and it was picked up by his  neighbour. The neighbour did not throw it away, but examined it carefully. Then  said he, &lsquo;Lo! it is not glass, but a diamond worth a king&rsquo;s ransom.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;  replied Mrs. Dawson, with supreme disdain, &ldquo;Cannot you read my riddle? Are you  going to throw away the diamond because you believe it but worthless glass?  Take my advice, Mr. Conway,&rdquo; she added, earnestly, &ldquo;be the second man of my  parable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  Leonard returned home that evening, he thought long and deeply over Mrs. Dawson&rsquo;s  allegory. It seemed to hint at some mystery connected with Matty, of which she  was cognizant. He felt inclined to propose to Matty, and take the chances of  her being the costly diamond or the worthless piece of glass, but he dreaded  lest she should prove to be the latter rather than the former. His mother  called him into her boudoir before she retired that evening. She was radiant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  Kendrick asked me if he could speak to Matty to-morrow afternoon,&rdquo; she said,  smiling at her son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  he intend to propose,&rdquo; asked Leonard, with an odd feeling in his breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course he does. It will be a brilliant match for Matty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  she accept him, mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear, she would be mad to refuse,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Conway, impressively. &ldquo;Lord Kendrick  is young, handsome, titled, and wealthy. What more can the girl want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leonard  muttered something unintelligible, and left the room as quickly as possible.  The news dismayed him greatly. He was on the point of then and there seeking  Matty, with the intention of asking her to become his wife. Two circumstances  restrained him. The one was that Matty had gone to rest, the other that it  would not be fair to Kendrick. Conway thought of Mrs. Dawson&rsquo;s parable again,  and made up his mind what course to adopt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  she accepts Kendrick, I&rsquo;ll go on a shooting trip to Africa,&rdquo; he decided; &ldquo;but  if she refuses him&mdash;ah!&rdquo;&mdash;he drew a long breath&mdash;&ldquo;if she refuses him, I&rsquo;ll see if  Matty is the diamond or the piece of glass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Next  day he saw nothing of his cousin, as he resolutely kept away from home. All the  morning he remained at his club, and caught a glance of Kendrick looking  radiant with expectation of success. Not feeling inclined to speak with his  rival, he left the club, and went for a solitary stroll in the Park. Several  times he was greeted by friends of both sexes, but kept away from their  neighbourhood. He worried himself with thoughts of Kendrick&rsquo;s success, and  Matty&rsquo;s triumph in becoming a peeress. Not till that moment did he guess how  deeply he was in love with his cousin. Notwithstanding her many deficiencies,  he would gladly have made her his wife, but so far as he saw it was too late to  think of such a thing.</p>
  <p>In  the afternoon he could bear the suspense no longer, and returned home to learn  the worst. It was now close on five o&rsquo;clock, and Kendrick must have learned his  fate. Leonard entered the house with an assumption of calmness he was far from  feeling. As he ascended the stairs, Kendrick came hastily down, and brushed  past him without a word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say, Kendrick! I say&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord  Kendrick muttered a hurried excuse, seized his hat, and without waiting for the  footman to open the door, did so himself. On the stairs Leonard remained  transfixed with astonishment, yet with a feeling of exultation in his heart. He  took in the situation at a glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has refused him!&rdquo; he thought, joyfully. &ldquo;Now it is my turn!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  giving himself time for further consideration, he ran up-stairs and entered the  drawing-room.</p>
  <p>Matty  was looking out of the window, scarcely less white than was her dress, and  looked strangely at him as he entered. With the unerring instinct of a woman,  she guessed his errand from the expression of his face, and her heart gave a  throb of joy as it was borne in on her that Leonard had come to ask her to be his  wife. Now came the crucial test of her capability as an actress, and, strange  as it may appear, she determined in one swift moment of thought to finish the  comedy as she had planned. Perhaps the confident look on his face made her come  to this decision. No woman likes her answer in a case of this sort to be  thought certain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  thinks I&rsquo;ll drop like a ripe peach,&rdquo; she murmured, as he came towards her. &ldquo;Well,  we shall see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leonard  caught her hands passionately, while she nerved herself to play the part of a  heartless coquette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Matty,&rdquo;  cried her cousin, &ldquo;you have refused him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; she asked, snatching her hands away. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re too free,  cousin Leonard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  met Kendrick&mdash;I saw his face&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have declined the honour of becoming Lady Kendrick. Are you vury sorry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I am glad! I am delighted! I&mdash;I wish you to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Matty  looked at him with a well-simulated look of surprise. No one would have guessed  the power of her self-control from that careless glance at the man kneeling at  her feet. It was the moment of her revenge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wish to marry me?&rdquo; she replied, slowly. &ldquo;Well, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love you, Matty! I love you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sakes  alive, just hear him!&rdquo; laughed Matty, with mirthful eyes.</p>
  <p>Leonard  sprang to his feet with a scarcely suppressed oath. The remark grated on his  ears. A diamond! this slangy American flirt&mdash;rather was she the worthless piece  of glass! Still fascinated by the piquant beauty of her face, he made another  attempt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is no jest, Matty. Will you be my wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  wife! Well, I should smile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  finished it. Without a word, with a glance full of impotent anger, Leonard  swiftly left the room. Matty was triumphant, but looked anything but pleased at  the success of her comedy. Her smiles vanished as the door closed, and she sat  down on the sofa, biting her lip to keep back her tears. Still, in her foolish  pride she strove to console herself with the thought of her own firmness of  character.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  said I would bring him to my feet in spite of slang and eccentricity,&rdquo; she  muttered, defiantly; &ldquo;and I have done so! He is punished for the way in which  he spoke and I&rsquo;m quite satisfied. I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;quite&mdash;quite&mdash;sat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  proof of which she buried her face in the sofa-cushions and burst into tears.  She was hardly a minute in this humiliating position when she felt two strong  arms lift her up. With a cry she turned her tear-stained face upward, and  saw&mdash;Leonard.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page189.jpg" width="800" height="676"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Matty!  Matty! I cannot go! I have come back. Surely you love me as I love you! These  tears tell me so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  Matty&rsquo;s pride was gone by this time, and she leaned her head on his shoulder.  By finding her in tears he had her at a disadvantage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  you will marry me!&rdquo; urged Leonard, in a low voice. &ldquo;You must marry me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not fit to be your wife,&rdquo; cried Matty, striving to release horself. &ldquo;I use  American slang, I smoke cigarettes, I flirt with a strong accent, and I have  hunted for a title.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leonard  looked at her in amazement. She spoke good English, with hardly any  Transatlantic accent, and, moreover, she repeated almost word for word his opinion  of American girls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Dawson has been telling you my foolish speech regarding you,&rdquo; he said, gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I saw a letter she wrote to Mrs. Scheveningen about me. Your fancy portrait was  so ridiculous that I determined to punish you by realizing it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  cried Leonard, a sudden light breaking in upon him. &ldquo;Then you have been playing  a part?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  To punish you!&rdquo; said Matty, laughing, in spite of tears and anger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sufficiently punished. But now that you have finished your comedy, perhaps you  will condescend to accept me as your husband. True comedies always end in  marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I talk slang.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t at present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  smoke cigarettes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  only did that out of bravado.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough,&rdquo; said Matty, ruefully. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear smoking. But you forget I hunted  for a title.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  let it go when you caught it,&rdquo; replied Leonard, smiling. &ldquo;Come, Matty, we have  been at cross purposes long enough. I was anxious to marry the false Matty, I  am still more anxious to marry the real one. Will you be my wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Matty  looked up into his face with a smile, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Her  answer may be guessed from the text of the cablegram she sent next day to Mrs.  Scheveningen, in New York:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send  me your ruby ring, and expect a piece of my wedding-cake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>ALL  things considering, I scarcely think that my uncle acted in strict accordance  with his religious principles. As a man,&mdash;as an injured husband, doubtless, he  had&mdash;broadly speaking&mdash;some excuse for his conduct; but seeing that he was a  clergyman, and Rector of Polwheal, Cornwall, he should have forgiven his  enemies, and not have discounted his chances of salvation by plotting crime  on&mdash;as one may say&mdash;his deathbed. But the Tregarthens were never famous for  meekness of spirit; and after all, he gave the guilty pair at least one chance  of escape,&mdash;which they did not take. Had they done so, this story would not have  been written, nor would I have been so well-to-do as I am.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rdquo;  were his divorced wife Lillian, and Jack Westleigh, the man who had brought  about the intervention of the law. I cannot hold Uncle Tregarthen entirely  blameless in the matter: for he should have known better than to have married,  at sixty years of age, a girl whom he knew to be in love with her cousin. If  Westleigh had not been poor, Squire Lawton would not have objected to the match:  but a briefless barrister and a pauper spinster?&mdash;the idea was madness. Lawton  only acted within his fatherly rights, and wisely, when he forbade the cousins  to see, or even to think of each other.</p>
  <p>These  prohibitions, however, were of no avail, for Westleigh, in defiance of paternal  wrath, took up his quarters in the village and gained occasional glimpses of Lillian.  They corresponded also by letter, making use of an aged oak on the borders of  Lawton Park as an intermedium of communication. Into a hole in the trunk&mdash;a  disused tit&rsquo;s nest&mdash;Westleigh would slip a note, and next day return for the  answer which invariably awaited him in this strange post-office. Occasional  glimpses, still more occasional conversations, and continual letters went on  for six months between this Juliet and her Romeo; until the Squire, discovering  Love&rsquo;s roguery, ended the romance by marrying Lillian to Mark Tregarthen,  rector and eccentric.</p>
  <p>The  harsh-featured and whimsical old man was not attractive to the  nineteen-year-old girl, and Lillian, although she did not dare to disobey her  father, bitterly resented the match. Her married life was unhappy and short;  for, unable to agree with her aged husband, impatient of his eccentric habits  and domineering ways, she fled to London, and there sought the protection of  her lover. Uncle Tregarthen obtained a divorce; after which he refused to  mention the name of his disgraced wife, but retiring into his misanthropic  self, he became daily more odd in his conduct. These things happened ten years  before I became personally acquainted with Uncle Tregarthen, so I repeat them  from hearsay. In the sequel I took an active part, as will be seen hereafter.</p>
  <p>Uncle  Tregarthen was my mother&rsquo;s brother, but she had long since ceased to see, or  even to correspond with him. This was less her fault than his, for he  designedly cut himself off from the family, leading a misanthropic and solitary  life among his wild parishioners. These were mostly fishermen and miners, to the  saving of whose souls Uncle Tregarthen paid less attention than to his hobby  for collecting diamonds. He lived in a dilapidated rectory; he scrimped and  screwed his housekeeper and himself in the matter of food and creature  comforts; in all ways he behaved in a most miserly fashion, and devoted the  money thus saved to the purchase of gems. His private income, his stipend, his  savings in the matter of household and other expenses, were used solely for  this purpose, and Polwheal Rectory was looked on as the Golconda of Cornwall.</p>
  <p>Why  my uncle should have developed so expensive and useless a hobby I could never  understand. No one, save himself, saw his diamonds, which were locked up in an  iron safe let into the wall of his study: he did not even adorn his wife with  them during the short period of her married life. So long as they were in his  safe, he was satisfied; and for forty years he added to his collection, until  the value of the gems amounted to a fabulous sum&mdash;I am afraid to say how much.  The rough fishers, and still rougher miners, knew of his wealth, but none  attempted to steal the jewels. They were too attached to their eccentric parson  to think of doing so; therefore Mark Tregarthen&rsquo;s riches were as safe in that  house on the lonely Cornish coast as they would have been in the Bank of  England.</p>
  <p>I  regret to say that my father&mdash;a thriftless man of letters&mdash;was indifferently well  off, and when he died left my mother almost penniless, to bring me up as best  she could. In this strait she applied to her husband&rsquo;s well-to-do relatives for  assistance, and received monies from all save Uncle Tregarthen. He did not even  trouble to acknowledge the letter, much to the anger of my mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same, he may remember us yet,&rdquo; she said, after many fruitless applications,  extending over several years. &ldquo;I am his only sister, and you, Francis, his only  nephew; he must leave his money to one or the other of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  he marries himself,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mark  will never marry,&rdquo; replied my mother convincedly; &ldquo;he is a confirmed bachelor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Subsequent  events proved her to be wrong, for shortly we received the news of the marriage  to Lillian Lawton, which dashed our hopes to the ground. A year afterwards came  the intelligence of his divorce, which raised them again. Five years later a  letter from the eccentric himself came to hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been informed,&rdquo; began the letter abruptly, &ldquo;that your son Francis is now  twenty years of age. If he is not a fool&mdash;which he must be if he takes after his  father&mdash;I should like to see him. Send him to me at once; it will be the better  for him and for you.&mdash;Your brother, Mark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  response to this amiable invitation I obtained a month&rsquo;s holiday from the  office wherein I was then employed, and repaired to Polwheal, where I presented  myself before my eccentric relative. I found him a powerful-framed, grizzled  man, moody and suspicious: he beheld in me an etiolated youth with pale cheeks  and round shoulders, both induced by desk work. Neither of us approved of the  other&rsquo;s looks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  miserable whelp,&rdquo; said grim Uncle Tregarthen, &ldquo;you need Cornish air and out  door life to change you from tadpole to man. Write and resign your appointment  in your London den.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  my mother, sir: she depends upon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see to your mother,&rdquo; he retorted shortly; &ldquo;you stay here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  hesitated to accept this offer without confirmation, whereat, in a breath, the  dour creature blamed me for my distrust, and praised me for my caution.  Afterwards he instructed his lawyers to pay my mother fifty pounds quarterly,  conditionally that she never sought Polwheal Rectory, wherein I was henceforth  to take up my abode. With an eye to future favours, we accepted these somewhat  harsh terms, and for three years I dwelt with Uncle Tregarthen, a kind of  prisoner on parole. The old man was not unkind to me, but neglectful and  uncompanionable. He gave me no pocket-money, he rarely permitted me to travel  beyond the confines of the parish, and scrimped me, along with his other  dependents, in the matter of food and light.</p>
  <p>Shooting  was my great resource, and many a day did I, spend on the moors, solitary but  happy. My skill with the gun kept the larder supplied at the mere cost of  powder and shot; therefore the Rector rather approved of, than grudged my  sport. The out-door life developed my frame, the scanty fare kept me in  excellent health, and in a few years I became an uncommonly powerful man. As  will afterwards be seen, I owed my life to this rigorous training.</p>
  <p>What  puzzled me during my sojourn at Polwheal were the singular habits of my uncle.  Sometimes he went to London for the purpose of buying diamonds, at others he  attended to his parishioners; but for the most part he would disappear for  hours, and return covered with grime, and exhausted with toil. Where he went,  what he did, I could never discover; nor did I seek to force his secret, until  one day, as I returned across the moors, I fell in with him unexpectedly.</p>
  <p>The  place was on the verge of the sea-shore, and everywhere the ground gaped with  the shafts of disused mines. Out of one of these Uncle Tregarthen suddenly  appeared, and I had just time to slip behind a giant stone before he passed by  me groaning heavily. In the fast-falling night it was difficult to see plainly,  but I noted his pale face, his dragging gait, and I heard the laboured breath which  told of severe toil. My curiosity to know the meaning of these things got the  better of my prudence; and when the old man vanished, I slipped into the mouth  of the mine whence he had emerged.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page199.jpg" width="605" height="750"></p>
  <p>Within  all was thick gloom, but I was provided against that emergency. For the purpose  of exploring tin mines, I always carried matches and candles; so before diving  into the shaft I lighted up, and stuck my taper, miner-fashion, in my cap, with  a lump of clay. Forward I went, doubled up, for the roof was low, and advanced  cautiously lest I should fall into some snare. It was just as well I did so,  for the gallery ended in a yawning chasm, which led to the lower workings of  the mine. Down this hung a stout rope, attached to a massive rock at the lips  of the well; and I would have swung myself down, but that my candle fell from  my cap. I had no other light, so for the moment I was reluctantly compelled to  abandon the exploration.</p>
  <p>On  my return home bad news awaited me. Uncle Tregarthen had arrived an hour  previously, had called for brandy, and while lifting the glass to his lips he  had fallen dead. As I afterwards learned from the doctor, the old man died of  aneurism of the heart, induced by the overtaxing of his strength. I had no  doubt but what the Rector had worked hard at some manual labour while in the  depths of that mine, but his reasons for so doing I could not understand.  Sooner than I expected these came to light, and singular enough they were.</p>
  <p>At  once I communicated with my mother, who came to Polwheal in time to see the  last of her brother, before he was buried. After the funeral, the will was  read, and then we received an unpleasant surprise. I had always looked on  myself as the heir to the Rector&rsquo;s jewels, but to my dismay the diamonds were  left to the divorced wife Lillian and her lover: failing their acceptance of  the same the gems were to become my property.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if they would refuse,&rdquo; lamented my mother. &ldquo;There must be fifty thousand pounds&rsquo;  worth, Francis; and to leave them to that wicked woman! Can&rsquo;t we upset the will?  I&rsquo;m sure your uncle was mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so, mother: he was eccentric, but not mad. The will is likely to  stand the test of the law, so the only thing for us to do is to communicate  with Mr. and Mrs. Westleigh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have already done so,&rdquo; said the lawyer; &ldquo;they will be here this week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  were they not present at the reading of the will?&rdquo; I asked sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  they were abroad, and could not come earlier. I am sorry for you, Mr. Carson,  but you are young, and will soon make your way in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cold  comfort that,&rdquo; I rejoined bitterly. &ldquo;Uncle Tregarthen took me out of a  situation, and now turns me loose to live as best I can after five years of  idleness. I do not think I have been treated fairly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is scandalous,&rdquo; cried my mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so! quite so!&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;But the will is all right. I don&rsquo;t deny the  leaving of the property to the divorced wife is hard, but Mr. Tregarthen was  always eccentric.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the way, where are the jewels?&rdquo; I asked, out of mere curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the safe, I suppose,&rdquo; said the solicitor, selecting a key. &ldquo;I looked in there  the other day, and could not find them; but as a matter of fact my examination  was cursory&mdash;very cursory indeed. We will search for them now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Surprise  number one was the provisions of the will, surprise number two, the searching  of the safe. It was empty: no diamonds were therein concealed, and the three of  us stood looking at one another in dismay. Then Mr. Pryce, the lawyer,  suggested that the jewels might be concealed in some other part of the house,  so we made a close search. It was useless, for not a single gem could we  discover. The Rector had hidden his diamonds to some purpose, for no one knew  their whereabouts save himself&mdash;and he was dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear!  dear!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Pryce, &ldquo;this is most extraordinary. You have no idea where  they can be, Mr. Carson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the slightest. The only key to that safe was on the Rector&rsquo;s watch-chain all  the time I have been here. I have never seen the diamonds. Uncle Tregarthen did  not honour me with his confidence so far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  thought Pryce eyed me somewhat suspiciously, as though he thought I had stolen  the jewels. My mother saw his looks, and gave him a piece of her mind which  made him beat a hasty retreat. When he was gone, she turned to me&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Francis!  you have never seen the diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no idea where they can be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  said no more, for the situation, and the suspicions of Pryce, disturbed us  greatly, Mr. and Mrs. Westleigh, the legatees under the will, were to arrive on  the morrow&mdash;but where was the legacy?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>II</b></h2>
  <p>BUT  for the loss of the diamonds my mother and I would have left the Rectory before  the arrival of the Westleighs. I had no particular wish to meet my divorced  aunt, and my mother was of that aggressively virtuous matron type which dreads  contact with the fallen. Nevertheless we remained, as departure might  complicate matters, and I had my character to defend. Not only Pryce had  conceived a suspicion, but Mrs. Lowdy, the half-starved housekeeper, imbibed his  ideas, and looked askance at me. I never felt so uncomfortable as at that time.  It was bad enough to be thrown penniless on the world, through the whims of an  old man; but it was worse to be suspected of thieving the property which  morally, if not legally, I looked on as mine. There was something ironical  about such circumstances.</p>
  <p>Nor  was my discomfort lessened by the arrival of the Westleighs. He was a  fresh-coloured, insolent creature, loud-voiced and coarse-minded; she a pretty  woman who adored this male brute, and was a slave in consequence. That he loved  her in an animal sort of way I do not deny, but his selfish egotism would not  permit her to be happy. To my mind the second marriage of Lillian Lawton was  even more unfortunate than the first.</p>
  <p>My  mother was kind but cold to the wife; a compliment returned by Westleigh, who  was insolent and overbearing to me. For obvious reasons I kept my temper,  although he tried it sorely by pointed allusions to the loss of the diamonds.  With characteristic meddlesomeness Pryce had driven to the nearest railway  station, and had informed Westleigh of the loss, and of his doubts, so that  when the man arrived he was quite prepared to accuse me of the theft without a  shadow of foundation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  strange business this, Mr. Carson,&rdquo; he said, when we were alone after dinner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean about the diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid I cannot tell you, Mr. Westleigh. All the time I have lived with my  uncle, I have never even seen the jewels. I understood that he kept them in his  study safe&mdash;but they are not there now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know their value?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not the least idea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Westleigh  looked at me with a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you no doubt expected to be your uncle&rsquo;s heir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly!  The jewels ought to have been left to me. Your wife&mdash;excuse me, Mr. Westleigh,  for speaking so plainly&mdash;but your wife forfeited her claim to my uncle&rsquo;s  property by her behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!  No doubt you wish to make her suffer for that slip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  asked the question indignantly, for the man&rsquo;s insolence stung me cruelly. He,  like myself, was on his feet, and leaning one hand on the table, he bent  towards me with a frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean, Mr. Carson, that you know more about these jewels than you choose to  tell. Naturally you are aggrieved at being left out of the will, and I dare swear  you have taken steps to remove those diamonds to a safe hiding-place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was fortunate that Mrs. Lowdy entered the room at that moment, and compelled me  to restrain myself, else I should have sprang on the insolent brute, who so  coldly accused me of theft. As it was, I stood silently controlling my passion,  while Westleigh received a letter from the housekeeper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  late master asked me to give you this on your arrival, Mr. Westleigh,&rdquo; said  Mrs. Lowdy, with a curtsey, &ldquo;and having placed it in your hands, sir, I have  discharged my duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  then left the room, and after a doubtful glance at me, Westleigh tore open the  envelope. Wondering what Uncle Tregarthen could have to say to the man who had  wrecked his domestic happiness, I waited. Westleigh read the note&mdash;it was not  very long&mdash;and then turned towards me with a studied courtesy which was even  more objectionable than his insolence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ask your pardon for my late speech, Mr. Carson,&rdquo; he said, in a voice charged  with excitement, &ldquo;for I have suspected you wrongly. I know now where the  Tregarthen diamonds are hidden.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  Does that letter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  I could finish my remark he placed the note in my hands, and in the crabbed  Greek handwriting of my late uncle, I read as follows&mdash;&ldquo;The diamonds are hidden  for safety in the Trevethy Mine. Enter the shaft with the red star, follow the  rope, and it will guide you to the hiding-place. Take spade and pickaxe, for  the place is hermetically sealed. One thing only I ask of you. When you seek  the jewels, take with you my late wife Lillian. Both of you have wronged me  deeply, and you owe it to me to obey my last request. Seek the jewels together,  or leave them to my nephew, Francis Carson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no signature to this extraordinary letter, and I returned it to Westleigh  with a sudden enlightenment of the mind. This then was the reason of Uncle  Tregarthen&rsquo;s long absences&mdash;of his toil and grimy appearance&mdash;the reason of his  emergence from the shaft of the Trevethy Mine. The diamonds were concealed  therein. I wondered that I had not guessed as much, when they were missing from  the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  expect he was afraid of being robbed,&rdquo; said Westleigh, with a peculiar glance  at me, &ldquo;and so concealed the jewels in that mine. Well, we will seek them to-morrow&mdash;will  you come also, Mr. Carson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  if you wish it,&rdquo; said I quietly; &ldquo;but the letter stipulates that your wife  should go with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see her about it at once,&rdquo; he replied resolutely. &ldquo;No doubt she will make some  objection; but I am not going to lose a fortune simply because she is afraid of  descending a tin mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Westleigh anticipated, his wife was by no means willing to descend into the  depths of the Trevethy Mine. She appeared apprehensive lest the letter of the  dead man should conceal some sinister design; and indeed I had my doubts on the  matter also. A dour creature like Uncle Tregarthen was not likely to forgive an  injury: and his ostentatious pardon of the pair who had wronged him so deeply  seemed ironical. Mrs. Westleigh thought so too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid, Jack! I am terribly afraid,&rdquo; she cried, clinging to his arm, when he  broached the subject, &ldquo;evil will come of this. Let us give up the diamonds to  the nephew, and go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must take me for a fool, Lillian,&rdquo; replied her husband crossly. &ldquo;Give up fifty  or sixty thousand pounds? I&rsquo;ll do no such thing. We will go down this mine  tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! I shall not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall! You must! Don&rsquo;t be foolish: there can be no possible danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Westleigh thought differently and continued to object; but during the night the  stronger will dominated the weaker, and next morning she professed her  willingness to carry out the dead man&rsquo;s instructions. In the meantime  Westleigh had sent for Pryce, and when he arrived showed him the letter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  extraordinary,&rdquo; said the lawyer, when he had mastered its contents. &ldquo;I was  always under the impression that my late client kept the jewels in his safe.  That was evidently a blind, and he constructed a secret place in the Trevethy  Mine. Mr. Carson,&rdquo; he added, turning to me, &ldquo;I beg to apologize for my unjust  suspicions. I see now that you are innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  owe you no thanks for that, Mr. Pryce,&rdquo; said I bitterly. &ldquo;The evidence of this  letter is too strong for you to disbelieve; but you might have given me the  benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These  three people were all hostile to me, and but for my curiosity concerning the  hiding-place of the diamonds, I should have left Polwheal Rectory that day with  my mother. As it was I persuaded her&mdash;sorely against her will&mdash;to stay, and at  twelve o&rsquo;clock we set out for the Trevethy Mine to seek the jewels. As I passed  out of the door, Mrs. Lowdy plucked me by the sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ask your pardon, sir,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I suspected you wrongly; but you will be  rewarded for your trouble, Mr. Carson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, Mrs. Lowdy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  screwed up her mouth and nodded significantly. &ldquo;When they find the diamonds,  you come back to me, and I&rsquo;ll give you a message from the master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  I could ask for an explanation, she vanished into the house and shut the door,  while I ran on to join the party, now some distance ahead. I began to be  suspicious of the motives of my dead uncle. He had left a letter for Westleigh,  and a message for me; and I suspected that blindly we were carrying out some  design dangerous to some, if not to all of us. So strongly was this borne on us  that I determined to dissuade Westleigh from descending the shaft.</p>
  <p>There  was no difficulty in finding the main entrance to the Trevethy Mine. It was the  same whence I had seen the old man emerge on the day of his death. And to  distinguish it from the other gaping mouths a splotch of red paint was rubbed  on the grey stone face. Under the bright blue sky, on the verge of the rugged  shore, we stood, a party of five, looking at the yawning mine, down which we  had to descend to recover the jewels. Westleigh, as instructed by the letter,  had brought a pickaxe and shovel with him, and with these over his shoulder he  prepared to step into the mouth. Lillian with a sudden access of terror drew  back, and flung herself into the arms of my mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t, Jack! I daren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she wailed fearfully; &ldquo;there is danger. I am sure  there is danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rot!&rdquo;  cried Westleigh, seizing her roughly by the hand. &ldquo;You must come. I don&rsquo;t wish  to lose the jewels for your scruples. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think Mrs. Westleigh is right,&rdquo; I interposed. &ldquo;I feel sure that Uncle  Tregarthen has some sinister design in this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;  sneered Westleigh. &ldquo;You want the jewels for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pryce  took a pinch of snuff, and looked doubtfully at me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be as you say, Mr. Carson,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I never yet knew your uncle to  forgive his enemies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  go; don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said my mother, drawing back Lillian; &ldquo;let the diamonds be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  want them for your son,&rdquo; scoffed Westleigh; &ldquo;but they are mine by right, and I  mean to have them. Come, Lillian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shuddered, and gave one despairing glance around at sky, sun, and sea, then,  dominated by her husband&rsquo;s will, she followed him into the tunnel, leaving the  three of us looking at one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are afraid to go, I see,&rdquo; said Pryce, with a jeering look at me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  I answered, &ldquo;I intend to see this out. I suspect something is wrong, but if  Westleigh does not keep his eyes open I shall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silencing  my mother&rsquo;s objections with a kiss, I slipped into the gallery after Jack  Westleigh and his wife, and in a few minutes I found myself standing with them  on the lips of the hole which led into the bowels of the mine. The three of us  were now fully committed to the adventure. Would that we had foreseen the end,  and had retired while there was yet time!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>III</b></h2>
  <p>THE  situation was enough to try the nerves of a stronger woman than Mrs. Westleigh,  and she leaned against the sides of the tunnel faint with terror. Seeing this,  her husband administered a sup of brandy from his travelling flask, and so  braced her up for the adventure. She became as anxious as he to find the  jewels, and professed her willingness to descend into the shaft, whence she had  shrunk some minutes before. Taking advantage of this sudden access of courage  Westleigh made ready for the descent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be awkward for you to scramble down by this rope,&rdquo; he said, kneeling on  the edge of the shaft. &ldquo;Hullo! here&rsquo;s a rope-ladder; that&rsquo;s capital. Lillian, I  shall go down first, you follow me, and then if Mr. Carson chooses to come he  can do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Carson does choose to come,&rdquo; I said sharply; &ldquo;but how are you going to lower  this pickaxe and spade?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  this rope, of course,&rdquo; replied Westleigh, drawing up the cord which swung by  the rope-ladder. &ldquo;See, I&rsquo;ll tie them to the end and lower them so. The shaft is  not so deep as I thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  heard the clink of the iron as axe and spade clashed at the bottom of the  shaft. Afterwards, with a reassuring word to his wife, Westleigh cautiously  descended the rope-ladder, and bending over the yawning mouth I could see the  candle fastened in his cap, twinkling starlike in the thick gloom. After the  elapse of some minutes, he apparently reached the ground, for we heard him  shout faintly, and felt the guiding-rope violently shaken.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Mrs. Westleigh, it is your turn,&rdquo; said I; and as she started nervously back I  added encouragingly, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, I will tie the end of this rope to your  waist, and you will thus be supported while descending the ladder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  an effort she consented, and pulling the rope up I bound the end round her  waist. Then she swung herself fearfully on to the shaking ladder, and I let the  cord pay out slowly through my hands as she clambered down. In a few minutes  she accomplished the descent also, and like glow-worms the candlelights  glimmered at the bottom of the shaft. Without hesitation I gripped the rope,  and making no use of the ladder, I precipitated myself into the abyss.  Accustomed as I was to cliff climbing, it was easy work for me to descend, and  shortly I found myself standing beside the pale wife and the anxious husband in  the bowels of the earth.</p>
  <p>By  this time the effect of the spirit had died out in Mrs. Westleigh, and in the  wavering light of the candles her face looked curiously pale. Notwithstanding  her awe of Westleigh, I believe she would have fled, but that it was now too  late to retreat. Her husband, with flushed face and bright eyes, paid little  attention to her agitation, but he groped about for the rope, which, as mentioned  in Uncle Tregarthen&rsquo;s letter, would guide him to the place where the jewels  were hidden.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  it is,&rdquo; he cried in an exulting tone, picking it up from the side of the  gallery. &ldquo;Carson, look after my wife and follow me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Little  as I liked her I was sorry for the poor woman. She gripped my hand with the  courage of despair, and we hurried along the gallery after Jack Westleigh. The  tunnel proceeded in a horizontal direction for some distance until it stopped  short at another chasm, down which depended a rope-ladder. Our descent was  accomplished in the same manner as before, and again we walked on. I judged  that by this time we were under the sea, so that the adventure was even more  perilous than we had deemed it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;  I said, pausing a moment with Lillian&rsquo;s hand in mine, &ldquo;we are under the ocean.  Do you hear the reverberation of the waves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  all listened intently, and heard distinctly the rumble of the waters overhead,  the grating of the rocks grinding along the bed of the sea, and the drowsy  swell of the waves seething on the rugged beach. By the lights of the candles  we could see that the rocks within which we were entombed were quite dry, and  here and there a glint of light was struck from the veins of ore threading the  sides of the tunnel. The air was thick and muggy, so that we could hardly  breathe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Jack, I am afraid&mdash;I am afraid,&rdquo; moaned Lillian in wide-eyed terror; &ldquo;let us go  back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  After coming so far? Not if I know it,&rdquo; was his response, and he seized his  wife as she sank on the rocky floor. &ldquo;Get up and come along, you fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Passive  in his hands from sheer terror, she permitted herself to be led forward, and  after five minutes we emerged on to a kind of platform beyond which opened a  huge vaulted chamber. The rope descended here, and Westleig looked over to find  the expected ladder. There was none &ldquo;I must scramble down as best I can,&rdquo; he  grumbled slinging axe and spade over his shoulder. &ldquo;You can wait here, Lillian,  with Carson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I help you?&rdquo; I asked, as he gripped the rope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you,&rdquo; was his sneering retort, &ldquo;I would rather find the jewels alone; I  don&rsquo;t trust you, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Indignation  held me silent, and I busied myself attending to Mrs. Westleigh, while her  husband dropped into the darkness. The precipice proved of no great height, for  we saw his light suddenly steady as he touched ground ten feet below.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  rope runs to the right,&rdquo; he called up; and then we saw the glimmer of his  candle moving athwart the gloom. A shout of joy announced that he had reached  the end of his journey, and had found the treasure place. &ldquo;The old man has  bricked up the hole,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about four feet square; but I&rsquo;ll soon  have this wall down. It runs all along the side of the vault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  moment afterwards the blows of the pickaxe echoed in the vault, and Lillian on  her hands and knees peered into the gloom, watching the dancing light, as her  husband moved his head with every stroke. For a few minutes he plied the  pickaxe; then rose a cry of fear, the light went out, and we heard the roar of  many waters. Lillian shrieked aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help&mdash;help&mdash;Carson&mdash;Lillian!&rdquo;  cried Westleigh in muffled tones. &ldquo;I have let in the sea. I have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  waters broke down the brickwork which ran along the side of the vault, and  surged tempestuously into the hollow. They gripped Westleigh in their strength  and dashed him against the rocky sides. He gave one shriek, echoed by Lillian,  and then all was still save the roaring of the rapidly-rising waters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Westleigh, let me save you,&rdquo; I cried, seizing her in my arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! My husband! Ah!&rdquo; she screamed, as a dark body borne on the turbid waters  swept under the feeble glimmer of our candles. &ldquo;Jack! Jack!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  I could tighten my grip on her, before I could guess her purpose, she tore  herself from my arms, and hurled herself into the black pool, now streaked and  marbled with white foam. I heard her cry as she was swept into the darkness,  and I staggered back under the force of the incoming flood, which now was up to  my knees. I could save neither him nor her; I was in danger of losing my own  life, and in an agony of fear I turned and raced for safety along the lower  gallery. Even in that terrible moment I recognized the fearful vengeance which  had been meted out by Mark Tregarthen to the guilty pair.</p>
  <p>Quick  as I was in gaining the first shaft which led to the higher levels, the waters  were quicker still, and as I rapidly clambered up the rope-ladder, the salt  flood growled and bubbled at my heels. It forced its way up the narrow shaft at  tremendous speed, and the floor of the second gallery was already ankle-deep  before I had covered half the distance. At the last shaft the turbulence of the  flood somewhat abated, therefore I judged that I was on a level with the ocean;  but as I scrambled up the second ladder the waters still continued to swell,  though slowly. Halfway up they stopped, and rolled hoarsely from side to side.  With a prayer of thanksgiving for my escape I flung myself exhausted on the  floor of the tunnel which led to the open air. Of the three of us I alone had  saved my life.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page214.jpg" width="443" height="750"></p>
  <p>The  reason for my uncle&rsquo;s strange will, and stranger letter, can now easily be  guessed. He had forgiven neither his wife nor Westleigh, but by appealing to  their greed he had brought about the death of both. For years he must have  toiled constructing that brickwork which alone kept out the waters of the sea.  How he managed to accomplish so great a task unaided I cannot say; by what  means he pierced the ocean floor so that the waters should pour into the mine  the moment the brickwork was destroyed, it is impossible to guess. But the fact  remained that with inconceivable malignancy he had made Westleigh the  instrument of his own fate. By tempting him with the promise of the diamonds,  he had induced the wretched man to destroy, by his own free will, the only  barrier between him and death. I saw now why he wished Westleigh and Lillian to  go <i>together</i> to the mine: it was to  doom them to the cruel death which I had escaped so narrowly. The Trevethy Mine  was filled almost to the mouth with water, and in its grim depths were  concealed the corpses of those who had wronged the Rector of Polwheal. I  challenge fiction to produce a more gruesome tragedy than that which I have  narrated.</p>
  <p>On  recovering somewhat from my exhaustion, I staggered along the tunnel, and  emerged, battered, bruised, and grimy, into the glare of the sunshine. As in a  dream I saw my mother and Pryce rise in alarm from the stones whereon they were  seated; as in a dream I heard them ask for the Westleighs, and I heard my own  voice tell of the terrible catastrophe. Then I faintly saw their faces of  horror at the recital, and fell down in a swoon, almost as void of life as  those unhappy beings entombed in the watery depths below.</p>
  <p>And  now comes in the strangest part of this strange story. When I came to my senses  I was lying on my bed with my mother anxiously bending over me. With maternal  care she held some wine to my lips, and so efficacious was the draught that  soon I was able to sit up and converse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have been unconscious for over two hours,&rdquo; said my mother in response to my  inquiries; &ldquo;we carried you here, and then Pryce with some men went back to see  if the Westleighs could be rescued.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,  mother! They were both drowned before I escaped from the mine. I should have  been drowned also, but that I made use of my speed and my strength. What a  terrible vengeance Uncle Tregarthen prepared for those unhappy people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Terrible  indeed, Francis; but I always knew that my brother was vindictive, although I  did not think he would have sinned so wickedly on his dying bed. Lillian is  gone, Westleigh is gone, and the diamonds&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are gone also!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so sure of that,&rdquo; said my mother significantly, producing a letter from  her pocket. &ldquo;Mrs. Lowdy, who has followed Mr. Pryce to the mine, gave me this  for you. It is from your uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  opened the letter and read it aloud without further delay. The contents  astonished us both.</p>
  <p class="letter">&ldquo;NEPHEW  FRANCIS,&rdquo; began the letter, in my uncle&rsquo;s well-known handwriting. &ldquo;When you  receive this letter, I hope my guilty wife and her lover will be dead. I have  given them one chance of escape:&mdash;by appealing to their moral feelings as to  whether they deserve my money or not. If they can conquer their greed and  refrain from descending into the Trevethy Mine, doubtless they are alive still;  if, on the other hand, they have been shameless enough to claim the property of  one whom they have wronged cruelly&mdash;well, you know what has occurred. For years  I have brooded over my vengeance, for years I have toiled to build a slight  wall against the sea which threatened to flood the mine. How I discovered the  danger, how I accomplished the work, there is no need to say. Sufficient is it  for me to declare that my hate gave me strength and ingenuity to prepare this  trap. If they have fallen into it I am glad; if they are alive still, God will  punish them in His own good time. In any case the diamonds are yours. I did not  hide them in the Trevethy Mine&mdash;that was but a lure to accomplish my vengeance.  No! the jewels, to the amount of eighty thousand pounds, are hidden in the  trunk of the oak tree on the borders of the Lawton estate, where my wife was  accustomed to meet her lover. Put your hand into the tit&rsquo;s nest they used as a  post-office; there you will find a cord, at the end of which is a leathern bag  containing the jewels. If I have accomplished my revenge I feel no sorrow; if  they are dead I am glad. I shall welcome them to the next world with joy. They  sought wealth&mdash;they found death. Bless you, my boy&mdash;and curse them.&mdash;MARK  TREGARTHEN.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  is no more to be said. As directed by the letter I sought the oak, I found the  jewels, and these ultimately realized the sum of close on eighty thousand  pounds. The bodies of Lillian and Jack Westleigh were never recovered, as it  was found impossible to drain the mine. Thanks to my uncle&rsquo;s bequest, both my  mother and myself live in affluence and ease, but neither of us have ever  revisited Polwheal, which to us is fraught with horror. The horrible story of  my uncle&rsquo;s vengeance is still related at winter firesides; and no legend is so  popular, or so firmly believed, as that of the Dead Man&rsquo;s Diamonds.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="turquoise"></a>&lsquo;The Tale Of  The Turquoise Skull&rsquo;</b><br>
  <b>Part I</b></h2>
  <p>THIS  story has been told by three different men. Each has embellished it according  to his fancy, and constituted himself the hero. I object to these egotistical pilferers,  for I am alone entitled to tell, in the first person, the tale of the turquoise  skull. Should any one question my right to this principal r&ocirc;le, I can point out  that the forefinger of my left hand is missing. That loss substantiates my  statement. I should like to know if those other three story-tellers lack the  forefingers of their left hands. If not, they stand convicted of plagiarism.</p>
  <p>When  Harry Carstone and I went to the U. S. A. on a shooting excursion, we intended  to strike for the Rockies. It was by no deliberate design that we found  ourselves at Zacatecas. By a series of accidents which need not be set forth  here, we drifted aimlessly southward. From New York we travelled to New  Orleans, thence took ship to Vera Cruz, and, as a natural consequence, we  terminated our journey in Mexico City. And here we should have remained, had  not Fate, by her favourite device of feminine influence, lured us&mdash;or rather one  of us&mdash;to Zacatecas, If Harry had not followed Lola Tepeaca from capital to  province, he might now be alive. As it was, he left Mexico City for Zacatecas,  where he found Lola, the turquoise skull, and a grave. I came out of the affair  with my life and the loss of a finger. To save Harry I would have given  willingly the whole hand. But it was not to be; and although I punished Lola  for her evil deeds, such reprisal was but poor compensation for the death of my  college chum.</p>
  <p>Ostensibly  we sought Zacatecas in the mining interest, but I gave up my time to  sight-seeing, and Harry spent most of his with Lola. Only once did I accompany  him to her dwelling; then, seeing that I was an inconvenient third, I went no  more. As for Lola, she usually smoked cigarettes in a grass hammock swung on  the <i>azotea</i>, while Harry sat at her  feet and talked. I guessed what formed the gist of these conversations, from my  friend&rsquo;s flushed face and sparkling eyes at their conclusion. And, judging that  such trifling was unwholesome, I ventured a remonstrance, which he promptly resented.  Experience should have taught me the futility of interfering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t marry the girl,&rdquo; said I impatiently; &ldquo;she is half Indian, and wholly  diabolical.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harry  drew his brows together, as was his habit when annoyed, I remembered that sign  of temper at Eton when he went up for punishment. Still, he answered  temperately enough&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know she is a half-caste, but she is not the&mdash;the other thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  she, though! If ever I saw evil in a woman&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  need say no more, Frank,&rdquo; he interrupted, hotly; &ldquo;it is shabby to speak ill of  a woman behind her back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will say it to her face if you like, Harry. Believe me, she is no good, and she  will certainly get you into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can take care of myself. I am no fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a man, at all events,&rdquo; I retorted, &ldquo;and all men are fools where a woman is  concerned. Do you intend to present Lady Carstone with a half-caste  daughter-in-law?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is neither here nor there,&rdquo; said he sulkily, and turned on his heel to intimate  that my interference was uncalled for. Later on he left the hotel to call on  his Venus Pandemos. Having been thus rewarded for my mediation, I walked to the  Casa de la Estrella to visit Fray Benito. He was a Dominican monk of  archaeological tastes, with whom I had forgathered shortly after my arrival at  Zacatecas. His monastery&mdash;named after the star of Bethlehem&mdash;was a peaceful old  dwelling, with courts and corridors, a wonderful chapel, and an extensive  library. When Fray Benito was not praying in the chapel, he was reading in the  library; and here I found him wrestling with the crabbed Latin of a priestly  author.</p>
  <p>Our  friendship was based on a common love for archaeology; but as Harry&rsquo;s tastes  did not lie in that direction, he sought neither monastery nor monk; and  although I had observed casually that I had a companion, I had not thought it  necessary to inform the holy monk of the existence of Lola. It was only after  my fruitless appeal to Harry that I mentioned the name of the half-caste siren  to the Dominican. As a popular confessor in Zacatecas, he was likely to know  something of the lady, and a little timely knowledge of her peculiarities might  enable me to rescue Harry from her toils. This, then, was the main reason for  my visit, and after a few words of courtesy I introduced the subject, The pious  horror with which Fray Benito received the name of Lola served only to confirm  my fears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is this you tell me, Don Francisco?&rdquo; said he severely. &ldquo;Have you been led  astray by this daughter of evil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  reverend sir. I speak in the interest of my friend, who is now in her toils.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  help him!&rdquo; said the monk, crossing himself. &ldquo;She will lure him to death, as she  has lured others. Demon, <i>succuba</i>,  would that the Holy Office were still in existence, to burn thee to ashes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is she, Fray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  demon, Se&ntilde;or. Have you not heard of the turquoise skull?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No:  what is the turquoise skull?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is an instrument of evil possessed by this creature,&rdquo; said Fray Benito, with  much energy&mdash;&ldquo;the skull of a heathen king adorned with jewels, and inhabited by  evil spirits. With it she works her devilries. Twelve men has she slain. Holy  Mary forbid that your friend should the the thirteenth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page225.jpg" width="516" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t mean to say that she has murdered twelve men?&rdquo; I demanded uneasily. The  attitude of the monk frightened me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  knows how they die! She lures them with her beauty, and gives them the  turquoise skull as a token. Then they perish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do they perish?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,  Se&ntilde;or, I cannot tell you. There was an unworthy brother of our order who was  charmed by this <i>succuba</i>, and fell  away from his vows. In due time, as is her custom, she gave him the turquoise  skull. He bore it to his cell, and he was found next morning seated before  it&mdash;dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the skull?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  sprinkled it with holy water, and conjured the evil spirit who dwelt therein to  depart. But she came, the accursed one, and bore it away. Ay, my son, bolts and  bars and stone walls could not keep her out of the House of the Star. She  appeared like a demon in our midst, and disappeared with the skull. We buried  Fray Anselm at midnight. May his soul find peace!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  the conclusion of this story the friar betook himself to his prayers and his  rosary; and, seeing that my presence was distasteful, I left him to his  devotions.</p>
  <p>This  was the first I had heard of the turquoise skull, but I was to hear of it again  within an hour. This time it was from a <i>l&eacute;pero</i>.  There was no connection between monk and vagabond, yet both spoke of the same  thing. Fate is fond of duplicating incidents. My acquaintance with Don Panchito  Diaz de Grijalva&mdash;for so he styled himself&mdash;began by my saving his life. The <i>lepero</i> was crossing the road, when a  stallion beyond the control of its rider dashed round the corner. Had I not  instinctively rushed forward and dragged Don Panchito out of harm&rsquo;s way,  assuredly he would have been trampled to death. This he recognized, for, having  devoutly crossed himself, he shook his fist at the flying steed, and advanced  towards me with a lordly air.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page228.jpg" width="517" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo; I  lay myself at your illustrious feet, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said he in the stately Spanish tongue.  &ldquo;You are my preserver. All I have is yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  gift was no princely one, for his whole wardrobe could have been purchased for  half-a-crown. His skin was as ingrained with dirt as were his clothes. Beyond a  pair of leathern breeches, a ragged shirt, and a cloak, he wore nothing worth  mentioning save a tattered sombrero, which he held in his hand during our  interview. With his evil eyes, his shining teeth, and his long matted hair, he  appeared to be anything but a desirable acquaintance. But, in nowise conscious  of his defects, he rolled a cigarette and straddled impudently before me. A  finer specimen of the gaol-bird I never beheld, and as I was in no way desirous  of continuing the acquaintance I muttered some acknowledgment of his words and  turned to go. This, however, he would not permit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  my eyes deceive me,&rdquo; said he, stepping back a pace, &ldquo;or do I indeed behold the  renowned and noble Se&ntilde;or Don Francisco, who honours our city with his  magnificent presence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  admitted the identity, and turned my back upon him as before; but with no  better result.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,  Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said he reproachfully, &ldquo;you must allow Don Panchito Diaz de Grijalva to  pay his debts. I owe you my life: permit me to save that of your illustrious  friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that you say?&rdquo; I asked, considerably startled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Henriquez is devoted to Lola Tepeaca. Let him beware, lest she give to him the  turquoise skull.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  skull again! What do you know about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything,  your lordship. Was it not I who brought the skull to Lola from the holy hermit  Felix, who dwells yonder mountains? Assuredly it was. Eh, Se&ntilde;or! know you not  that he who possesses the turquoise skull surely dies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  does he die?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Truly  I know not, Se&ntilde;or. It is said that a fiend who slays dwells within the skull;  but of the truth of this I know nothing. Four days was I carrying it from the  hills, yet still I am alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Lola, who possesses it; she is alive also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  father of sin does not kill his best soldiers, Don Francisco: the demon who  dwells within the skull permits her to live and to work harm. Yet,&rdquo; added  Panchito, raising a significant forefinger, &ldquo;twelve has he slain. Beware, Se&ntilde;or,  and let not your illustrious friend take the love gift, lest he make the  thirteenth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with this Panchito took his departure, while I hurried back to the hotel,  filled with alarm at the danger hinted at by Fray Benito and the <i>l&eacute;pero</i>. Both had warned me, in words  almost identical, against the turquoise skull. And although I was not  sufficiently superstitious to believe in the existence of this demon, yet the  assurance that twelve men had fallen victims to the skull resolved me to warn  Harry against accepting it from Lola. But my information had come too late, for  when I opened the door there was the turquoise skull on the table, and over it  bent my friend.</p>
  <p>The  sight fitted in so dramatically with the stories I had heard, that it was  impossible to suppress an ejaculation of surprise. Harry looked up, and laughed  at my staring eyes and open mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  old fellow,&rdquo; he said cheerfully, &ldquo;you look a bit off colour. Have you been  sampling the wine of the country?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  in the name of heaven did you get that infernal thing?&rdquo; I stammered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  this skull? Queer, isn&rsquo;t it? Lola gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guessed as much: give it back to her at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  now, Frank, don&rsquo;t try me too far; I thought we had settled all that this  morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dropping  into a chair without making a reply, I stared at the blue object on the table.  It was a man&rsquo;s skull, completely encrusted with rough turquoises, save the  cavities of the nose and eyes, which were filled in with Durango rubies. These  red and jewelled orbs glittered in so uncanny a fashion as to cause me to  suspect the presence of tin-foil. I am fairly self-controlled, but when I  remembered how that gruesome skull, with its blue scalp and winking eyes, had  caused in some unknown way the death of twelve men, I own that I was unnerved.  Shaking and white, I clutched the table, whilst Harry eyed me in angry  surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the deuce is the matter, Frank? This skull&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  cause your death. Give it back to Lola.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  sun has been too strong for you,&rdquo; said Harry, with a clouded face; &ldquo;go and lie  down for an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was about to lift the skull, when I sprang up from my chair and dragged him  back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  touch it, Harry. Fray Benito says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  so that old monk has been gossiping to you about Lola, has he? When I said that  you knew him she told me how he hated her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she mention how this turquoise skull brought about the death of a priest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  nor would I have believed it if she had. How can this dead thing kill any man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  all events it has killed twelve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fray  Benito again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and not he only: a <i>l&eacute;pero</i> I met with  but an hour ago spoke with horror of that skull and of its owner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is becoming interesting,&rdquo; said Harry, drawing his chair close to mine. &ldquo;Tell me  what they say, Frank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Glad  of the opportunity, I recounted the conversations of Fray Benito and the <i>l&eacute;pero</i>. Harry listened attentively, but  made no remark until I had finished. Then he shrugged his shoulders and  laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never heard such nonsense in my life,&rdquo; said he disdainfully. &ldquo;It is a wonder to  me how a sensible man like yourself can swallow such monstrous fables. Twelve  men killed by that skull! Twelve fiddlesticks: it is merely a curious relic of  a by-gone civilization: the head of some old Aztec or Toltec king embalmed and  encrusted with gems. A hermit who knew Lola long before he retired from the  world sent it to her as a present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why does she give it to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is some secret connected with it, which she has asked me to discover if  possible. Look here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  handed me a slip of paper, on which were two lines written in Spanish. Having a  fair knowledge of the language and a capacity for rhyme, I improvised upon them  an English couplet:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Find  out my secret, and you then shall win<br>
Eternal happiness from that within.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  allusion to the beatitude of the victims, no doubt,&rdquo; said I bitterly. &ldquo;Who is  the author of these lines?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  hermit who sent the skull to Lola,&rdquo; replied Harry, taking back the paper. &ldquo;She  cannot discover the secret, so she has asked me to try.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust it will not cost you dear, Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  what possible harm can this skull do to me? Look at it. It won&rsquo;t bite you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Taking  no heed of his flippancy, I closely examined the bone of contention. The stones  were roughly imbedded in a kind of cement, and some were missing, while the  base was fashioned crudely of unpolished wood. Externally there was no evidence  to show that this ghastly object was of a harmful nature; yet, so influenced  was I by the warnings of the monk and the <i>l&eacute;pero</i>,  that I still regarded it with horror. For over an hour I discussed with Harry  the advisability of having nothing to do with Lola or her barbarous curiosity.  But my efforts were vain, for he obstinately refused to restore the thing to  its owner until he had discovered its secret. Wearied out by continuous  expostulation, I ceased to argue further, and let him carry it to his bedroom.  After all, I might be wrong. I must admit that the stories told by Fray Benito  and Don Panchito were improbable, so that it was not surprising that a prosaic  young man such as Harry should despise them. An imaginative strain, inherited  from Highland ancestors, led me to accept with less hesitation these romances  of a semi-civilized race. Nevertheless Harry&rsquo;s scepticism was not without its  effect upon me, and I retired to rest a trifle ashamed of my championship. But  in the morning&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page233.jpg" width="532" height="750"></p>
  <p>When  I entered his bedroom the turquoise skull was on the table, and seated before  it, fully dressed, was my poor friend&mdash;dead! The number of victims was now  thirteen.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Part II</b></h2>
  <p>THERE  is no need to dilate upon my profound grief. Harry Carstone had been my closest  friend at Oxford, as at Eton. Constant companionship had bound us together by  no common ties, and his unexpected death fell heavily upon me. I knew that it  would fall more heavily still upon the old couple at Carstone Hall. To them I  wrote all details of the death and burial, and then I addressed myself to the  task of punishing Lola, whom I regarded as the indirect cause of the tragedy.  It is at this point that I assume the principal r&ocirc;le.</p>
  <p>I  have mentioned the funeral as having taken place at Zacatecas; for although I  wished to have the corpse embalmed for transmission to England, such a course  proved to be quite out of the question. Whatever the cause of death was&mdash;and I  was utterly unable to determine it&mdash;the state of the body was such as to  necessitate a hasty interment. In twenty-four hours the remains of my poor friend  were committed to the earth, and I returned from the funeral, to take the  turquoise skull to Lola and to compel her to confess by what means it had  killed Harry. To my surprise the skull was gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  Se&ntilde;ora had come,&rdquo; explained the landlord, &ldquo;and had awaited the return of Don  Francisco in the sitting-room. But after a time she had changed her mind and  departed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had no doubt that it was Lola who had visited my hotel for the purpose of  recovering the turquoise skull. So long as it remained in her possession I  could not hope to solve the mystery of Harry&rsquo;s death; and how to get it back I  could not think. That the woman should dare to approach the scene of her crime  angered me greatly, and confirmed my determination to remain for retributive  justice. In turn Fray Benito and the <i>l&eacute;pero</i> commiserated with me, but I took neither into my confidence. The first, a  religious recluse, could be of no possible assistance, whilst I more than  suspected the other of having an understanding with her whom I designed to punish.</p>
  <p>Above  all was it important that I should regain possession of this turquoise skull.  If I could arrive at the secret hinted at in the couplet, I might succeed in  discovering the cause of the thirteen deaths, and so bring Lola within the  clutches of the law. If legal measures proved unavailing I intended myself to  mete out justice. She had killed Harry, and I would kill her. This savage  resolve, entirely foreign to my nature, was the result of the terrible tragedy  of the previous week. In some way I was determined to avenge the death of my  friend.</p>
  <p>Informed  by Panchito that it was Lola&rsquo;s invariable custom to request her lovers to solve  the secret of the skull, I hoped, by becoming one of these, to secure the  instrument of her crimes.</p>
  <p>Ignorant  as I was of the way in which the thing accomplished its mission, there was the  chance that I too might lose my life. But such a contingency did not deter me  from prosecuting my design. With great care I might come off harmless; and,  even did I not, I hoped before dying to destroy the skull, so that its list of  victims should terminate with my death.</p>
  <p>Thus  prepared for good or evil, I called upon Lola, whom I found in the garden in a  grass hammock, with her usual accessories of fan and cigarette. She exhibited  no signs of confusion or fear, but, with an audacity which revolted me, she  openly lamented the death of Harry. An accident, she termed it, as though she  did not know full well the hideous truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas,  Se&ntilde;or, that I should have given Don Henriquez the turquoise skull!&rdquo; she cried,  with feigned sorrow; &ldquo;but I knew not that it would cause his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you had experience to go upon, Senora.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lola  closed her fan with a snap, and became alive to the situation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  say you, Don Francisco?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  twelve friends of yours who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  died,&rdquo; said Lola, unfurling her fan with unnecessary violence: &ldquo;and what of  that? Am I responsible for their deaths? Truly no. Why should I slay those who love  me? Oh yes, Se&ntilde;or, I know well that Fray Benito has been talking. <i>Succuba</i>, sorceress, demon, those are the  words ever on his lips when he speaks of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough: that turquoise skull has gained for you no enviable reputation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  wherefore? It is only a skull.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  one that kills. Don Panchito&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  you know him, that scamp?&rdquo; she interrupted hastily: &ldquo;he could have prevented  all these deaths, for he knows the secret of the skull. I do not; hence I have  asked those who loved me to discover it. They have died, and so I bear the  blame; but it is all Panchito&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  procured the skull from Fray Felix, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Se&ntilde;or; he has been talking, I see. Tell me,&rdquo; she added curiously, &ldquo;do you think  that a demon dwells within the skull?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know best, Senora.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,  Don Francisco, you talk foolishly. I am quite in ignorance of the matter. The  skull is a dead thing. It cannot slay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless  it does slay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo;  she answered with a shrug; &ldquo;but how, I know not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not destroy it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dare not,&rdquo; said she, in a frightened whisper, &ldquo;It is the head of a dead king.  Who knows what curses the dead may send? Nay, I shall not destroy it. All I  wish is to discover its secret. But, alas! I cannot; and they who, to aid me,  have sought this knowledge, have perished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me try, Senora.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou,  Don Francisco? No, no: thirteen have died in the quest. Let there be no more.  Think of your poor friend. Ah me! how I have wept at his fate!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  affected sorrow and feigned ignorance did not deceive me. I saw that in truth  she was overjoyed at my offer, but feared to accept it too readily, lest she  might fall into a trap.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page239.jpg" width="800" height="526"></p>
  <p>When  I thought of how she had caused Harry&rsquo;s death I could have slain her then and  there. But I determined to punish her in a more deliberate fashion. I therefore  persisted in my offer; and after much hesitation she accepted it. Descending to  the <i>patio</i> with the skull under my  cloak, I heard a low laugh of satisfaction. It was Lola rejoicing over her  success in adding a fourteenth victim to her list.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-day  to you, to-morrow to me,&rdquo; muttered I to myself.</p>
  <p>On  the way to my hotel I met with Don Panchito. He planted himself in my way, and,  catching sight of the skull, he touched it significantly with his finger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  Lola wish you also to die?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Give it back, Don Francisco. There is  death under those blue stones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if you tell me the secret, Panchito.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  illustrious Se&ntilde;or, you saved my life, and I would most willingly save yours.  But I swear by the Virgin that I know not the secret. Who says so lies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Lola lies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Panchito  twirled his cigarette with a contemptuous smile. He had evidently a bad opinion  of the lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  she do aught else but lie, your worship? Eh! and what says she of the skull?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  little. But she asked me to search for a spring which opens it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,  Se&ntilde;or. She is too wise to search for the spring herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you are wrong. She has done so and failed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The <i>l&eacute;pero</i> looked at me dubiously. My  unaccountable defence of Lola led him to mistake my feelings towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you love Lola?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,  Panchito; I abhor the witch. I take this skull to learn its secret. I hope to  punish her for slaying my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good.  Did I know the secret, the knowledge would be yours. But you are as wise as I, Se&ntilde;or.  Yet, this much I can speak. In searching for the spring, should you feel pain  or see blood, you die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  I could demand an explanation Panchito folded his cloak around him and  disappeared. He had a way of coming and going which savoured of magic. On this  occasion I resented his unexpected vanishment, for it struck me that he hinted  more than he chose to tell. However, his advice was worth taking; and when I  unpacked the skull in my sitting-room I was particularly careful to handle it  lightly. The Angelus was ringing before I could persuade myself into attempting  the solution of this problem.</p>
  <p>Before  proceeding to an examination, I laid an axe on the table, for, if all other  means failed, I was resolved to smash open the skull and thus roughly end the  mystery. Thus prepared, I sat down and gently fingered the turquoise scalp in  search of the spring. My sense of touch is unusually delicate, but, though I  felt line after line of the stones, I could find no projecting knob to press.  Failing so far, I examined the ruby eyes, the wooden base, and lastly the ruby  nose. The gems of this latter were particularly irregular in their setting.  Being ambidexter, I held the skull with my right hand and pressed hard with the  forefinger of the left. Suddenly I felt a thrill of pain, and withdrew my  finger to see a tiny globule of blood swelling on the tip. In an instant I  remembered Panchito&rsquo;s warning. It explained itself. Blood-poisoning! That very  instant I chopped off my forefinger with the axe, before the venom had time to  pass the middle joint, and, with my maimed hand wrapped in a handkerchief, I  raced out of the hotel in search of a doctor.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page242.jpg" width="447" height="750"></p>
  <p>When  I returned, white with pain and loss of blood, I found the room occupied, Lola,  frowning and surprised, stood looking at the severed finger on the table. She  had come to survey my body and to recover the skull. My unexpected entrance  caused her to utter an ejaculation; but whether of regret, of wrath, or of  surprise merely, I was too perturbed to notice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see I am still alive, Se&ntilde;ora; and I know now how my poor friend died. You know  also, you infamous creature!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you cut it off?&rdquo; she stammered, still looking at the severed finger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  save my life. Else would I now he dead, and you would have taken back your  accursed turquoise skull, until you inveigled a new victim within your toils.  But this ends it: no more shall die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  she could guess my intent, I took up the axe and with one stroke cleaved the  skull in twain. Lola screamed and hid her face. From the interior of the  accursed thing poured a glittering stream of jewels. Diamonds, rubies,  sapphires&mdash;all kinds of gems&mdash;tinkled out on to the table, and rapped like small  shot on to the floor.</p>
  <p>The  Spanish woman stood aghast at the sight. With a pious exclamation she stooped  to pick them up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I cried: &ldquo;no, wretch! Look here&mdash;not there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  thrust forward the right hemisphere of the skull, and displayed the wicked  mechanism of the interior. A snake&rsquo;s fang, concealed at the back of the nose,  curved itself to the surface, and finally emerged between two rubies. At the  least pressure this spike, keen as a thorn, ejected venom. This, collected in a  small bag, was attached to the root of the fang, so that the poison could  trickle drop by drop to the deadly point. Never was there so ingeniously  fiendish an invention, and I wondered what devil could have designed it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Felix!&rdquo;  she gasped, looking white and sick: &ldquo;he then intended my death. Ah, what mercy  that I touched not the evil thing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a pity you did not,&rdquo; said I savagely, &ldquo;for then thirteen men might be alive  still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know of this, Se&ntilde;or; I swear I did not. Felix loved me, and fled to a  hermitage because I loved another. He sent me the turquoise skull as a gift,  saying that I should find eternal happiness if I succeeded in opening it. I was  afraid, Se&ntilde;or. I thought there was danger, and so I touched not the thing, and  asked my friends to open it. But you, Don Francisco, have discovered the  secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,  at the cost of my friend&rsquo;s life and my own finger. Leave those jewels!&rdquo; I  added, as she again bent to pick them up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are mine,&rdquo; she cried defiantly. Felix sent them to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  sent you death, not jewels,&rdquo; I retorted, angered at her heartlessness. &ldquo;Leave  them: you shall not take one with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked wrathfully at the floor and then at me. I was determined to punish her  for her callousness, but I saw that I should have to resort to strong measures  to do so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out,  you infamous creature&mdash;out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lola  saw the barrel of my revolver pointed at her, and, with a gasp of terror, she  fled from the room. That was the last I saw of her.</p>
  <p>I  took the skull and jewels to Fray Benito, and told him my story. He did not  evince much astonishment at it. Being a Mexican and a confessor, he was well  aware of the devilments of his countrymen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew this Felix,&rdquo; he said gravely: &ldquo;he was a wild and reckless youth, and he vowed  to punish this daughter of sin for her treatment of him. He became a recluse,  and while in the mountains he discovered a cave wherein the Aztecs laid their  dead chiefs. This is the skull of some mummy, adorned and packed with gems  after their barbarous fashion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the poisonous fang, Fray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt Felix placed it there for his revenge. He judged that the evil woman  would take his advice and press the skull to find the supposed spring. One  touch of that fang, and she would die. But she was too cunning to venture, Don  Francisco. From her knowledge of the sender&rsquo;s character, she suspected danger,  and so she let others die for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the jewels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Felix  probably found them in the cave of the dead. They were of no use to him;  doubtless he placed them in the cavity of the skull to embitter the dying  moments of her he hated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  you, Se&ntilde;or. Felix concluded that Lola Tepeaca would touch the snake-tooth and  thus open the skull and meet her death at the same time. Knowing her greed, it  would be an additional pang for her to see these jewels which she could not  live to enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a fiendish idea!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,  my son: human nature is very wicked. Do you intend to keep the jewels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I answered, with a shudder; &ldquo;they would constantly remind me of my poor friend&rsquo;s  death. You can make what use of them you please, father. Yet I shall keep a  few, with which to reward Panchito, without whose warning I had now been dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fray  Benito accepted the gift, and now Our Lady of the Star possesses a fine  necklace of variegated gems, which is the wonder of all visitors. They would  wonder still more did they but know the history attached to it.</p>
  <p>I  could do nothing to punish Lola further than depriving her of the jewels. The  Mexican lawyer to whom I submitted the case assured me that the evidence was  too indefinite to prove her guilty.</p>
  <p>On  moral grounds she surely merited death, but legally speaking she was as  assuredly innocent. So she escaped with her life. I often wonder whether she  went to the cave of Felix to cajole him into giving her fresh gems. If she did  I have no doubt he killed her. A man capable of inventing such a death-trap as  the turquoise skull would not hesitate to do what it had failed to accomplish.</p>
  <p>Once  again I heard of Lola. It was from Don Panchito, who accompanied me to the  railway station on the day I left Zacatecas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is just as well you are going, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said he significantly: &ldquo;Lola is wild at  the loss of the turquoise skull and its jewels. She asked me to knife you, but  I refused. Did you not save my life, and have you not given me precious stones?  Still, Se&ntilde;or, others may not feel as I do, and the cursed woman may cause you  to lose your life as well as your finger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  quite believed it. A woman who could doom thirteen men to death for the  gratification of her curiosity, would not stick at putting the fourteenth out  of the way. I have often regretted I did not shoot her at our last interview,  and so rid the world of a demon. But if she is in existence, the turquoise  skull is not. Neither is the forefinger of my left hand.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="green_stone"></a>The  Green-stone God and the Stock-broker</b></h2>
  <p>As a rule, the average detective gets twice  the credit he deserves. I am not talking of the novelist&rsquo;s miracle-monger, but  of the flesh and blood reality who is liable to err, and who frequently proves  such liability. You can take it as certain that a detective who sets down a  clean run and no hitch as entirely due to his astucity, is young in years, and  still younger in experience. Older men, who have been bamboozled a hundred  times by the craft of criminality, recognize the influence of Chance to make or  mar. There you have it! Nine times out of ten, Chance does more in clinching a  case than all the dexterity and mother-wit of the man in charge. The exception  must be engineered by an infallible apostle. Such a one is unknown to me &mdash; out  of print.</p>
  <p>This opinion, based rather on collective  experience than on any one episode, can be substantiated by several  incontrovertible facts. In this instance, one will suffice. Therefore, I take  the Brixton case to illustrate Chance as a factor in human affairs. Had it not  been for that Maori fetish &mdash; but such rather ends than begins the story.  Therefore it were wise to dismiss it for the moment. Yet that piece of  green-stone hanged &mdash; a person mentioned hereafter.</p>
  <p>When Mr and Mrs Paul Vincent set up  housekeeping at Ulster Lodge they were regarded as decided acquisitions to  Brixton society. She, pretty and musical; he, smart in looks, moderately well  off, and an excellent tennis-player. Their progenitors, his father and her  mother (both since deceased), had lived a life of undoubted middle-class  respectability. The halo thereof still environed their children, who were, in  consequence of such inherited grace and their own individualisms, much sought  after by genteel Brixtonians. Moreover, this popular couple were devoted to  each other, and even after three years of marriage they posed still as lovers.  This was as it should be, and by admiring friends and relations the Vincents  were regarded as paragons of matrimonial perfection. Vincent was a stockbroker;  therefore he passed most of his time in the City.</p>
  <p>Judge, then, of the commotion, when pretty  Mrs Vincent was discovered in the study, stabbed to the heart. So aimless a  crime were scarce imaginable. She had many friends, no known enemies, yet she  came to this tragic end. Closer examination revealed that the escritoire had  been broken into, and Mr Vincent declared himself the poorer by two hundred  pounds. Primarily, therefore, robbery was the sole object, but, by reason of  Mrs Vincent&rsquo;s interference, the thief had been converted into a murderer.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page254.jpg" width="610" height="750"></p>
  <p>So excellently had the assassin chosen his  time, that such choice argued a close acquaintance with the domestic economy of  Ulster Lodge. The husband was detained in town till midnight; the servants  (cook and housemaid), on leave to attend wedding festivities, were absent till  eleven o&rsquo;clock. Mrs Vincent, therefore, was absolutely alone in the house for  six hours, during which period the crime had been committed. The servants  discovered the body of their unfortunate mistress and raised the alarm at once.  Later on Vincent arrived to find his wife dead, his house in possession of the  police, and the two servants in hysterics. For that night nothing could be done,  but at dawn a move was made towards elucidating the mystery. At this point I  come into the story.</p>
  <p>Instructed at nine o&rsquo;clock to take charge of  the case, by ten I was on the spot noting details and collecting evidence.  Beyond removal of the body nothing had been disturbed, and the study was in  precisely the same condition as when the crime was discovered. I examined  carefully the apartment, and afterwards interrogated the cook, the housemaid,  and, lastly, the master of the house. The result gave me slight hope of  securing the assassin.</p>
  <p>The room (a fair-sized one, looking out on to  a lawn between house and road) was furnished in cheap bachelor fashion; an  old-fashioned desk placed at right angles to the window, a round table reaching  nigh the sill, two arm-chairs, three of the ordinary cane-seated kind, and on  the mantelpiece an arrangement of pipes, pistols, boxing-gloves, and foils. One  of these latter was missing.</p>
  <p>A single glimpse showed how terrible a  struggle had taken place before the murderer had overpowered his victim. The  tablecloth lay disorderly on the floor, two of the lighter chairs were  overturned, and the desk, with several drawers open, was hacked about  considerably. No key was in the door-lock which faced the escritoire, and the  window-snick was fastened securely.</p>
  <p>Further search resulted in the following  discoveries:</p>
  <p class="journal">1.&nbsp; A hatchet used for chopping wood  (found near the desk).<br>
    2.&nbsp; A foil with the button broken off (lying under the table).<br>
3.&nbsp; A green-stone idol (edged under the fender).</p>
  <p>The cook (defiantly courageous by reason of  brandy) declared that she had left the house at four o&rsquo;clock on the previous  day and had returned close on eleven. The back door (to her surprise) was open.  With the housemaid she went to inform her mistress of this fact, and found the  body lying midway between door and fireplace. At once she called in the police.  Her master and mistress were a most attached couple, and (so far as she knew)  they had no enemies.</p>
  <p>Similar evidence was obtained from the  housemaid with the additional information that the hatchet belonged to the  woodshed. The other rooms were undisturbed.</p>
  <p>Poor young Vincent was so broken down by the  tragedy that he could hardly answer my questions with calmness. Sympathizing  with his natural grief, I interrogated him as delicately as was possible, and I  am bound to admit that he replied with remarkable promptitude and clearness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you know of this unhappy affair?&rdquo; I  asked when we were alone in the drawing-room. He refused to stay in the study,  as was surely natural under the circumstances.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page256.jpg" width="639" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely nothing,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I went to  the City yesterday at ten in the morning, and, as I had business to do, I wired  my wife I would not return till midnight. She was full of health and spirits  when I last saw her, but now &mdash;&rdquo; Incapable of further speech he made a gesture  of despair. Then, after a pause, he added, &ldquo;Have you any theory on the  subject?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Judging from the wrecked condition of the  desk I should say robbery &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Robbery?&rdquo; he interrupted, changing colour. &ldquo;Yes, that was the motive. I had two hundred  pounds locked up in the desk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In gold or notes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The latter. Four fifties. Bank of England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are sure they are missing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. The drawer in which they were placed is  smashed to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did any one know you had placed two hundred  pounds therein?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! Save my wife, and yet &mdash; ah!&rdquo; he said,  breaking off abruptly, &ldquo;that is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is impossible?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will tell you when I hear your theory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You got that notion out of novels of the  shilling sort,&rdquo; I answered dryly. &ldquo;Every detective doesn&rsquo;t theorize on the  instant. I haven&rsquo;t any particular theory that I know of. Whosoever committed  this crime must have known your wife was alone in the house and that there was  two hundred pounds locked up in that desk. Did you mention these two facts to  any one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Vincent pulled his moustache in some  embarrassment. I guessed by the action that he had been indiscreet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to get an innocent person into  trouble,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;but I did mention it &mdash; to a man called Roy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a bit of a story. I lost two hundred  to a friend at cards and drew four fifties to pay him. He went out of town, so  I locked up the money in my desk for safety. Last night Roy came to me at the  club, much agitated, and asked me to loan him a hundred. Said it meant ruin  else. I offered him a cheque, but he wanted cash. I then told him I had left  two hundred at home, so at the moment, could not lay my hand on it. He asked if  he could not go to Brixton for it, but I said the house was empty, and &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t empty,&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believed it would be! I knew the servants  were going to that wedding, and I thought my wife, instead of spending a lonely  evening, would call on some friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and after you told Roy that the house  was empty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He went away, looking awfully cut up, and  swore he must have the money at any price. But it is quite impossible he could  have anything to do with this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You told him where the money  was and that the house was unprotected, as you thought. What was more probable  than that he should have come down with the intention of stealing the money? If  so, what follows? Entering by the back door, he takes the hatchet from the  wood-shed to open the desk. Your wife, hearing a noise, discovers him in the  study. In a state of frenzy, he snatches a foil from the mantelpiece and kills  her, then decamps with the money. There is your theory, and a mighty bad one &mdash;  for Roy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t intend to arrest him?&rdquo; asked  Vincent quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not on insufficient evidence! If he  committed the crime and stole the money it is certain that, sooner or later, he  will change the notes. Now, if I had the numbers &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here are the numbers,&rdquo; said Vincent,  producing his pocket-book. &ldquo;I always take the numbers of such large notes. But  surely,&rdquo; he added as I copied them down &mdash; &ldquo;surely you don&rsquo;t think Roy guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I should like to know his  movements on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you. He saw me at the Chestnut  Club about seven o&rsquo;clock and left immediately afterwards. I kept my business  appointment, went to Alhambra, and then returned home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me Roy&rsquo;s address and describe his  personal appearance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is a medical student, and lodges at No. &mdash;  Gower Street. Tall, fair-haired &mdash; a good-looking young fellow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And his dress last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wore evening dress concealed by a  fawn-coloured overcoat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I duly noted these particulars, and I was  about to take my leave, when I recollected the green-stone idol. It was so  strange an object to find in prosaic Brixton that I could not help thinking it  must have come there by accident.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the way, Mr. Vincent,&rdquo; said I, producing  the monstrosity, &ldquo;is this green-stone god your property?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never saw it before,&rdquo; replied he, taking  it in his hand. &ldquo;Is it &mdash; ah!&rdquo; he added, dropping the idol, &ldquo;there is blood on  it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tis the blood of your wife, sir! If it does  not belong to you, it does to the murderer. From the position in which this was  found I fancy it slipped out of his breast-pocket as he stood over his victim. As  you see, it is stained with blood. He must have lost his presence of mind, else  he would not have left behind so damning a piece of evidence. This idol, sir,  will hang the assassin of Mrs Vincent!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page260.jpg" width="462" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope so, but unless you are sure of Roy,  do not mar his life by accusing him of this crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I certainly should not arrest him without  sufficient proof,&rdquo; I answered promptly, and so took my departure.</p>
  <p>Vincent showed up very well in this  preliminary conversation. Much as he desired to punish the criminal, yet he was  unwilling to subject Roy to possibly unfounded suspicions. Had I not forced the  club episode out of him I doubt whether he would have told it. As it was, the  information gave me the necessary clue. Roy alone knew that the notes were in  the escritoire, and imagined (owing to the mistake of Vincent) that the house  was empty. Determined to have the money at any price (his own words), he  intended but robbery, till the unexpected appearance of Mrs Vincent merged the  lesser in the greater crime.</p>
  <p>My first step was to advise the Bank that  four fifty-pound notes, numbered so and so, were stolen, and that the thief or  his deputy would probably change them within a reasonable period. I did not say  a word about the crime, and kept all special details out of the newspapers; for  as the murderer would probably read up the reports so as to shape his course by  the action of the police, I judged it wiser that he should know as little as  possible. Those minute press notices do more harm than good. They gratify the morbid  appetite of the public, and put the criminal on his guard. Thereby the police  work in the dark, but he &mdash; thanks to the posting up of special reporters &mdash;  knows the doings of the law, and baffles it accordingly.</p>
  <p>The green-stone idol worried me considerably.  I wanted to know how it had got into the study of Ulster Lodge. When I knew  that, I could nail my man. But there was considerable difficulty to overcome  before such knowledge was available. Now a curiosity of this kind is not a  common object in this country. A man who owns one must have come from New  Zealand or have obtained it from a New Zealand friend. He could not have picked  it up in London. If he did, he would not carry it constantly about with him. It  was therefore my idea that the murderer had received the idol from a friend on  the day of the crime. That friend, to possess such an idol, must have been in  communication with New Zealand. The chain of thought is somewhat complicated,  but it began with curiosity about the idol, and ended in my looking up the list  of steamers going to the Antipodes. Then I carried out a little design which  need not be mentioned at this moment. In due time it will fit in with the  hanging of Mrs Vincent&rsquo;s assassin. Meanwhile, I followed up the clue of the  banknotes, and left the green-stone idol to evolve its own destiny. Thus I had  two strings to my bow.</p>
  <p>The crime was committed on the twentieth of  June, and on the twenty-third two fifty-pound notes, with numbers corresponding  to those stolen, were paid into the Bank of England. I was astonished at the  little care exercised by the criminal in concealing his crime, but still more  so when I learned that the money had been banked by a very respectable  solicitor. Furnished with the address, I called on this gentleman. Mr Maudsley  received me politely, and he had no hesitation in telling me how the notes had  come into his possession. I did not state my primary reason for the inquiry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope there is no trouble about these  notes,&rdquo; said he when I explained my errand. &ldquo;I have had sufficient already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page262.jpg" width="662" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, Mr Maudsley, and in what way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For answer he touched the bell, and when it  was answered, &ldquo;Ask Mr Ford to step this way,&rdquo; he said. Then turning to me, &ldquo;I  must reveal what I had hoped to keep secret, but I trust the revelation will  remain with yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is as I may decide after hearing it. I  am a detective, Mr Maudsley, and you may be sure, I do not make these inquiries  out of idle curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before he could reply, a slender,  weak-looking young man, nervously excited, entered the room. This was Mr Ford,  and he looked from me to Maudsley with some apprehension.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page264.jpg" width="603" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;This gentleman,&rdquo; said his employer, not  unkindly, &ldquo;comes from Scotland Yard about the money you paid me two days ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is all right, I hope?&rdquo; stammered Ford,  turning red and pale and red again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did you get the money?&rdquo; I asked,  parrying this question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From my sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I started when I heard this answer, and with  good reason. My inquiries about Roy had revealed that he was in love with a  hospital nurse whose name was Clara Ford. Without doubt she had obtained the  notes from Roy after he had stolen them from Ulster Lodge. But why the  necessity of the robbery?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did you get a hundred pounds from your  sister?&rdquo; I asked Ford.</p>
  <p>He did not answer, but looked appealingly at  Maudsley. That gentleman interposed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must make a clean breast of it, Ford,&rdquo; he  said with a sigh. &ldquo;If you have committed a second crime to conceal the first, I  cannot help you. This time matters are not at my discretion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have committed no crime,&rdquo; said Ford  desperately, turning to me. &ldquo;Sir, I may as well admit that I embezzled one  hundred pounds from Mr Maudsley to pay a gambling debt. He kindly and most  generously consented to overlook the delinquency if I replaced the money. Not  having it myself I asked my sister. She, a poor hospital nurse, had not the  amount. Yet, as non-payment meant ruin to me, she asked a Mr Julian Roy to help  her. He at once agreed to do so, and gave her two fifty-pound notes. She handed  them to me, and I gave them to Mr Maudsley who paid them into the bank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This, then, was the reason of Roy&rsquo;s remark.  He did not refer to his own ruin, but to that of Ford. To save this unhappy  man, and for love of the sister, he had committed the crime. I did not need to  see Clara Ford, but at once made up my mind to arrest Roy. The case was  perfectly clear, and I was fully justified in taking this course. Meanwhile I  made Maudsley and his clerk promise silence, as I did not wish Roy to be put on  his guard by Miss Ford, through her brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; I said, after a few moments&rsquo;  pause, &ldquo;I cannot at present explain my reasons for asking these questions, as  it would take too long and I have no time to lose. Keep silent about this  interview till tomorrow, and by that time you shall know all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has Ford got into fresh trouble?&rdquo; asked  Maudsley anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, but some one else has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; began Ford faintly, when I  interrupted him at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your sister is all right, Mr Ford. Pray  trust in my discretion. No harm shall come to her or to you, if I can help it &mdash;  but, above all, be silent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This they readily promised, and I returned to  Scotland Yard, quite satisfied that Roy would get no warning. The evidence was  so clear that I could not doubt the guilt of Roy. Else how had he come in possession  of the notes? Already there was sufficient proof to hang him, yet I hoped to  clinch the certainty by proving his ownership of the green-stone idol. It did  not belong to Vincent, or to his dead wife, yet some one must have brought it  into the study. Why not Roy, who, to all appearances, had committed the crime,  the more so as the image was splashed with the victim&rsquo;s blood? There was no  difficulty in obtaining a warrant, and with this I went off to Gower Street.</p>
  <p>Roy loudly protested his innocence. He denied  all knowledge of the crime and of the idol. I expected the denial, but I was  astonished at the defence he put forth. It was very ingenious, but so  manifestly absurd that it did not shake my belief in his guilt. I let him talk  himself out &mdash; which perhaps was wrong &mdash; but he would not be silent, and then I  took him off in a cab.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I swear I did not commit the crime,&rdquo; he said  passionately. &ldquo;No one was more astonished than I at the news of Mrs Vincent&rsquo;s  death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet you were at Ulster Lodge on the night in  question?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I admit it,&rdquo; he replied frankly. &ldquo;Were I  guilty I would not do so. But I was there at the request of Vincent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must remind you that all you say now will  be used in evidence against you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! I must defend myself. I asked  Vincent for a hundred pounds, and &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you did, to give to Miss Ford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From her brother, through Maudsley. He paid  the notes supplied by you into the bank. If you wanted to conceal your crime  you should not have been so reckless.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have committed no crime,&rdquo; retorted Roy  fiercely. &ldquo;I obtained the money from Vincent, at the request of Miss Ford, to  save her brother from being convicted for embezzlement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vincent denies that he gave you the money!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he lies. I asked him at the Chestnut  Club for one hundred pounds. He had not that much on him, but said that two  hundred were in his desk at home. As it was imperative that I should have the  money on the night, I asked him to let me go down for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And he refused!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He did not. He consented, and gave me a note  to Mrs Vincent, instructing her to hand me over a hundred pounds. I went to  Brixton, got the money in two fifties, and gave them to Miss Ford. When I left  Ulster Lodge, between eight and nine, Mrs Vincent was in perfect health, and  quite happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An ingenious defence,&rdquo; said I doubtfully,  &ldquo;but Vincent absolutely denies that he gave you the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Roy stared hard at me to see if I were  joking. Evidently the attitude of Vincent puzzled him greatly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is ridiculous,&rdquo; said he quietly. &ldquo;He  wrote a note to his wife instructing her to hand me the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is that note?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I gave it to Mrs Vincent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It cannot be found,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;If such a  note were in her possession it would now be in mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I against the evidence of those  notes and the denial of Vincent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he surely does not deny that he gave me  the money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He must be mad,&rdquo; said Roy in dismay. &ldquo;One of  my best friends, and to tell so great a falsehood. Why, if &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had better be silent,&rdquo; I said, weary of  this foolish talk. &ldquo;If what you say is true, Vincent will exonerate you from  complicity in the crime. If things occurred as you say, there is no sense in  his denial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This latter remark was made to stop the  torrent of his speech. It was not my business to listen to incriminating  declarations, or to ingenious defences. All that sort of thing is for judge and  jury; therefore I ended the conversation as above, and marched off my prisoner.  Whether the birds of the air carry news I do not know, but they must have been  busy on this occasion, for next morning every newspaper in London was  congratulating me on my clever capture of the supposed murderer. Some  detectives would have been gratified by this public laudation &mdash; I was not.  Roy&rsquo;s passionate protestations of innocence made me feel uneasy, and I doubted  whether, after all, I had the right man under lock and key. Yet the evidence  was strong against him. He admitted having been with Mrs Vincent on the fatal  night; he admitted possession of two fifty-pound notes. His only defence was  the letter of the stockbroker, and this was missing &mdash; if, indeed, it had ever  been written.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page268.jpg" width="763" height="750"></p>
  <p>Vincent was terribly upset by the arrest of  Roy. He liked the young man and he had believed in his innocence so far as was  possible. But in the face of such strong evidence, he was forced to believe him  guilty. Yet he blamed himself severely that he had not lent the money and so  averted the catastrophe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had no idea that the matter was of such moment,&rdquo;  he said to me, &ldquo;else I would have gone down to Brixton myself and have given  him the money. Then his frenzy would have spared my wife and himself a death on  the scaffold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you think of his defence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is wholly untrue. I did not write a note,  nor did I tell him to go to Brixton. Why should I, when I fully believed no one  was in the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a pity you did not go home, Mr  Vincent, instead of to the Alhambra.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a mistake,&rdquo; he assented, &ldquo;but I had  no idea Roy would attempt the robbery. Besides, I was under engagement to go to  the theatre with my friend Dr Monson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think that idol belongs to Roy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say. I never saw it in his  possession. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I firmly believe that if Roy had not  the idol in his pocket on that fatal night he is innocent. Oh, you look  astonished, but the man who murdered your wife owns that idol.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The morning after this conversation a lady  called at Scotland Yard and asked to see me concerning the Brixton case.  Fortunately, I was then in the neighbourhood, and, guessing who she was, I  afforded her the interview she sought. When all left the room she raised her  veil, and I saw before me a noble-looking woman, somewhat resembling Mr  Maudsley&rsquo;s clerk. Yet, by some contradiction of nature, her face was the more  virile of the two.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are Miss Ford,&rdquo; I said, guessing her  identity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am Clara Ford,&rdquo; she answered quietly. &ldquo;I  have come to see you about Mr Roy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid nothing can be done to save  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something must be done,&rdquo; she said passionately.  &ldquo;We are engaged to be married, and all a woman can do to save her lover I will  do. Do you believe him to be guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the face of such evidence, Miss Ford &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what evidence is against him,&rdquo;  she retorted. &ldquo;He is as innocent of the crime as I am. Do you think that a man  fresh from the committal of a crime would place the money won by that crime in  the hands of the woman he professes to love? I tell you he is innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr Vincent doesn&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr Vincent!&rdquo; said Miss Ford, with scornful  emphasis. &ldquo;Oh, yes! I quite believe <i>he </i>would think Julian guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely not if it were possible to think  otherwise! He is, or rather was, a staunch friend to Mr Roy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So staunch that he tried to break off the  match between us. Listen to me, sir. I have told no one before, but I tell you  now. Mr Vincent is a villain. He pretended to be the friend of Julian, and yet  he dared to make proposals to me &mdash; dishonourable proposals, for which I could  have struck him. He, a married man, a pretended friend, wished me to leave  Julian and fly with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page270.jpg" width="517" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely you are mistaken, Miss Ford. Mr  Vincent was most devoted to his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He did not care at all for his wife,&rdquo; she  replied steadily. &ldquo;He was in love with me. To save Julian annoyance I did not  tell him the insults offered to me by Mr Vincent. Now that Julian is in trouble  by an unfortunate mistake Mr Vincent is delighted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is impossible. I assure you Vincent is  very sorry to &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do not believe me,&rdquo; she said,  interrupting. &ldquo;Very well, I shall give you proof of the truth. Come to my  brother&rsquo;s rooms in Bloomsbury. I shall send for Mr Vincent, and if you are  concealed you shall hear from his own lips how glad he is that my lover and his  wife are removed from the path of his dishonourable passion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page272.jpg" width="577" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will come, Miss Ford, but I think you are  mistaken in Vincent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shall see,&rdquo; she replied coldly. Then,  with a sudden change of tone, &ldquo;Is there no way of saving Julian? I am sure that  he is innocent. Appearances are against him, but it was not he who committed  the crime. Is there no way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Moved by her earnest appeal, I produced the  green-stone idol, and told her all I had done in connection with it. She  listened eagerly, and readily grasped at the hope thus held out to her of  saving Roy. When in possession of all the facts she considered in silence for  some two minutes. At the end of that time she drew down her veil and prepared  to take her departure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come to my brother&rsquo;s rooms in Alfred Place,  near Tottenham Court Road,&rdquo; said she, holding out her hand. &ldquo;I promise you that  there you shall see Mr Vincent in his true character. Good-bye till Monday at  three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From the colour in her face and the bright  light in her eye, I guessed that she had some scheme in her head for the saving  of Roy. I think myself clever, but after that interview at Alfred Place I  declare I am but a fool compared to this woman. She put two and two together,  ferreted out unguessed-of evidence, and finally produced the most wonderful  result. When she left me at this moment the greenstone idol was in her pocket.  With that she hoped to prove the innocence of her lover and the guilt of  another person. It was the cleverest thing I ever saw in my life.</p>
  <p>The inquest on the body of Mrs Vincent  resulted in a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.  Then she was buried, and all London waited for the trial of Roy. He was brought  up charged with the crime, reserved his defence, and in due course he was  committed for trial. Meantime I called on Miss Ford at the appointed time, and  found her alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr Vincent will be here shortly,&rdquo; she said  calmly. &ldquo;I see Julian is committed for trial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And he has reserved his defence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall defend him&rdquo; said she with a strange  look in her face. &ldquo;I am not afraid for him now. He saved my unhappy brother. I  shall save him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you discovered anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have discovered a good deal. Hush! That is  Mr Vincent,&rdquo; she added, as a cab drew up to the door. &ldquo;Hide yourself behind  this curtain and do not appear until I give you the signal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wondering what she was about to do, I  concealed myself as directed. The next moment Vincent was in the room, and then  ensued one of the strangest of scenes. She received him coldly, and motioned  him to a seat. Vincent was nervous, but she might have been of stone, so little  emotion did she display.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have sent for you, Mr Vincent,&rdquo; she said,  &ldquo;to ask for your help in releasing Julian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I help you?&rdquo; he answered in  amazement &mdash; &ldquo;willingly would I do so, but it is out of my power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I assure you, Clara,&rdquo; he began eagerly, when  she cut him short.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, call me Clara! Say that you love me!  Lie, like all men, and yet refuse to do what I wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not going to help Julian to marry you,&rdquo;  declared he sullenly. &ldquo;You know that I love you &mdash; I love you dearly, I wish to  marry you &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is not that declaration rather soon after  the death of your wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My wife is gone, poor soul. Let her rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet you loved her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never loved her,&rdquo; he said, rising to his  feet. &ldquo;I love you! From the first moment I saw you I loved you. My wife is  dead! Julian Roy is in prison on a charge of murdering her. With these  obstacles removed there is no reason why we should not marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I marry you,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;will you  help Julian to refute this charge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot! The evidence is too strong against  him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know that he is innocent, Mr Vincent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not! I believe that he murdered my  wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You believe that he murdered your wife,&rdquo; she  reiterated, coming a step nearer and holding out the green-stone idol&mdash;&ldquo;do you  believe that he dropped this in the study when his hand struck the fatal blow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; he said, cooly glancing at  the idol. &ldquo;I never saw it before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think again, Mr Vincent &mdash; think again. Who  was it that went to the Alhambra at eight o&rsquo;clock with Dr Monson and met there  the captain of a New Zealand steamer with whom he was acquainted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was I,&rdquo; said Vincent defiantly, &ldquo;and what  of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This!&rdquo; she said in a loud voice. &ldquo;This  captain gave you the green-stone idol at the Alhambra, and you placed it in  your breast-pocket. Shortly afterwards you followed to Brixton the man whose  death you had plotted. You repaired to your house, killed your unhappy wife who  received you in all innocence, took the balance of the money, hacked the desk,  and then dropped by accident this idol which convicts you of the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>During this speech she advanced step by step  towards the wretched man, who, pale and anguished, retreated before her fury.  He came right to my hiding-place, and almost fell into my arms. I had heard  enough to convince me of his guilt, and the next moment I was struggling with  him.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page274.jpg" width="549" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a lie! a lie!&rdquo; he said hoarsely,  trying to escape.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is true!&rdquo; said I, pinning him down. &ldquo;From  my soul I believe you to be guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>During the fight his pocket-book fell on the  floor and the papers therein were scattered. Miss Ford picked up one spotted  with blood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The proof!&rdquo; she said, holding it before us.  &ldquo;The proof that Julian spoke the truth. There is the letter written by you  which authorized your unhappy wife to give him one hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Vincent saw that all was against him and gave  in without further struggles, like the craven he was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fate is too strong for me,&rdquo; he said, when I  snapped the handcuffs on his wrists. &ldquo;I admit the crime. It was for love of you  that I did it. I hated my wife who was a drag on me, and I hated Roy who loved  you. In one sweep I thought to rid myself of both. His application for that  money put the chance into my hand. I went to Brixton, I found that my wife had  given the money as directed, and then I killed her with the foil snatched from  the wall. I smashed the desk and overturned the chair, to favour the idea of  the robbery, and then I left the house. Driving to a higher station than  Brixton, I caught a train and was speedily back at the Alhambra. Monson never  suspected my absence, thinking I was in a different corner of the house. I had  thus an <i>alibi </i>ready. Had it not been for that letter, which I was fool  enough to keep, and that infernal idol that dropped out of my pocket, I should  have hanged Roy and married you. As it turns out, the idol has betrayed me. And  now, sir,&rdquo; he added, turning to me, &ldquo;you had better take me to gaol.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page278.jpg" width="487" height="750"></p>
  <p>I did so there and then. After the legal  formalities were gone through, Julian Roy was released and ultimately married  Miss Ford. Vincent was hanged, as well deserved to be, for so cowardly a crime.  My reward was the green-stone god, which I keep as a memento of a very curious  case. Some weeks later Miss Ford told me the way in which she had laid the  trap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When you revealed your suspicions about the  idol,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was convinced that Vincent had something to do with the  crime. You mentioned Dr Monson as having been with him at the Alhambra. He is  one of the doctors at the hospital in which I am employed. I asked him about  the idol and showed it to him. He remembered it being given to Vincent by the  captain of the <i>Kaitangata. </i>The curious look of the thing had impressed  itself on his memory. On hearing this I went to the docks and I saw the  captain. He recognized the idol and remembered giving it to Vincent. From what  you told me I guessed the way in which the plot had been carried out, so I  spoke to Vincent as you heard. Most of it was guesswork, and only when I saw  that letter was I absolutely sure of his guilt. It was due to the green-stone  god.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So I think, but to Chance also. But for the  accident of the idol dropping out of Vincent&rsquo;s pocket, Roy would have been  hanged for a crime of which he was innocent. Therefore do I say that in nine cases  out of ten Chance does more to clinch a case than all the dexterity of the man  in charge.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="jesuit"></a>The Jesuit  And The Mexican Coin</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;YOUR  reputation as a detective is known in Devon,&rdquo; said Lord Torinouth, &ldquo;therefore I  wish you to conduct the case. It could not be in better hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feel flattered by your preference, my lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;so I shall take charge of  it with pleasure. But you must give me a free hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  free hand, and as much money as you require. I see too much of the Pope&rsquo;s  influence in England to grudge aught likely to keep the Kempion estates out of  the priests&rsquo; hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amen  to that,&rdquo; I answered, being a Protestant myself; &ldquo;and now, my lord, give me  your version of the affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is now some six months old,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and not being so young as I was I am  apt to forget details. Roughly speaking, the story is as follows. Are you  ready?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment; my note-book. Thank you! Now I am all attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;James  Kempion died some three years back, leaving his estates to Francis his son. The  boy is now eighteen years of age, and he has a rent-roll of eight thousand a  year. His father, like all the Kempions, was a Roman Catholic, and quite under  the thumb of his confessor, Father Condy. Yet he defied the Church and the  priests sufficiently to marry a Protestant lady&mdash;Miss Lee, of Barnstaple. She  died, poor soul, in giving birth to Francis, and with her last breath she  implored Kempion to have the child brought up in the Anglican communion.  Despite the wrath of Father Condy, this was done. Being a Protestant myself,  and a firm friend to Kempion, I supported the lad. All went well till Kempion,  while on a visit to his brother in Mexico, chose to marry a second time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did not mention the brother before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  failing memory, sir. John Kempion, the brother of James, is a red-hot Papist,  and at present owns the estates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what about the heir, Francis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am coming to that,&rdquo; said Lord Tormouth grimly. &ldquo;As I said, James Kempion  married a second time a Mexican lady&mdash;I am not acquainted with her name or her  family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  Spanish descent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course! The fickle, faithless blood of Spain is in her veins. When Kempion  brought her home, she and the boy got on together capitally. Then James died,  and left his heir to the tender mercies of Father Condy and La Senora.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;La  Senora?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  she is called by the county side. When Kempion died John came back to the old  place, and remained for two years and a half. At the end of that time Francis  disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you said he was drowned while bathing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the common report, with which I don&rsquo;t hold. One evening Francis told his  stepmother that he was going to the beach for a swim in the moonlight. Since  then he has not been seen. They found his clothes on the sands, and, as the  current sweeps strongly round that point of the coast, it was supposed that he  had been carried out to sea,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  this idea of his death was generally accepted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  by all. Even by the lawyers. John Kempion, a Catholic&mdash;mark you, sir, a  Catholic&mdash;was the next heir to the estates, and entered into possession. It is  said,&rdquo; concluded Lord Tormouth ironically, &ldquo;that he intends to marry his  brother&rsquo;s widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose he can do so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page286.jpg" width="936" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do I know of their heathen customs, sir! La Senora comes from Mexico, and John  Kempion has lived there the greater part of his life. I am ignorant of their  notions of morality, but I am certain that, when the year of mourning for  Francis is out, there will be a match between John Kempion and La Senora. Then,  as now, Father Condy will reign supreme, and use the moneys for the Church&rsquo;s  benefit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you don&rsquo;t think Francis is dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I do not, and it is the truth of this which I wish you to prove. It is my  opinion, sir,&rdquo; continued Tormouth, tapping me on the knee, &ldquo;that the Jesuits  carried off Francis so as to avert the disaster of a Protestant head to the  Kempion family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  have murdered him, you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t go so far as that. I will do Father Condy the justice to say that outside  his religion he is a kind-hearted man. No, sir, Francis Kempion is not dead! He  is alive, but he has been spirited away by the Jesuits for their own ends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you want me to find Francis Kempion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye,  sir! Spare neither time nor money, but bring back my dear boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a difficult task you have set me, my lord,&rdquo; I answered ruefully. &ldquo;However, I  will do my best. Firstly, I should like to see the beach where the clothes were  found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  servant shall take you there to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Secondly,  it is necessary that I see the Kempion household.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  That is rather difficult. I am not on speaking terms with John. However, you  can call on the pretext of looking at their picture gallery. While there you  will doubtless see some of the family, and Father Condy. &lsquo;Tis a shabby method  of getting inside the gates, but in this affair we must not be squeamish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good, my lord! I shall commence work tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord  Tormouth&rsquo;s seat is, as every one knows, situate on the north coast of Devon,  within easy reach of Ilfracombe. It is built on a wooded hill which slopes down  to a sandy estuary, and opposite rises another hill crowned by Kempion Hall. I  had come down from London in response to his summons, and was not ill-pleased  to find myself among such beautiful scenery, even in December. Alas! though I  did not then guess, I had but little time to sojourn in that rural paradise.  The exigencies of the case sent me far across the ocean within a fortnight.</p>
  <p>Next  day, escorted by the confidential valet of Lord Tormouth, I crossed the  estuary, and found myself on the long stretch of beach fringing the Kempion  woods. A quarter of a mile&rsquo;s trudge brought us round a corner to a little bay,  almost land-locked by the silt at the narrow mouth. Standing at the corner I  could see the current swirl in a curve and, following the indentations of the  land, sweep out towards Lundy Island. It was from here, said the servant, that  Francis Kempion had started on that fatal swim.</p>
  <p>As  I surveyed the place I saw at once the circumstances which gave rise to the  doubts of Lord Tormouth. If Francis Kempion stepped into the water of the  little bay he certainly would not be so rash as to venture into the current  without noting the force of the sweep, as he must assuredly have done; he would  surely have been content to paddle about the safe bay in place of risking his life  in the outer waters. After this examination I was as certain as Tormouth that  Kempion was not drowned.</p>
  <p>If  so, he must have been drawn into the current, for I made sure that no man in  his senses would have ventured in of his own free will.</p>
  <p>The  servant, a very particular man, pointed out the exact spot where the clothes  had been found. I looked round carelessly enough, not expecting to find  anything connected with the unfortunate gentleman. As six months had elapsed  since his disappearance, this was hardly to be expected. My casual glances,  however, picked out a discoloured coin lying lightly on the sand. It proved to  be a Mexican peso, value four shillings and some odd pence. The discovery set  me thinking, and engendered a theory which later on I unfolded to Lord  Tormouth. Meanwhile I slipped the coin into my pocket, dismissed the servant as  no longer necessary, and walked up the hill to Kempion Hall.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page288.jpg" width="560" height="750"></p>
  <p>There  was some difficulty in seeing the pictures, as the family were in residence. I  represented that I was leaving the neighbourhood in twenty-four hours, so the  ancient housekeeper consented that I should walk through the gallery. Mr.  Kempion had gone to the Dower House, to see La Senora, said the garrulous old  lady, and only Father Condy was within doors. She accompanied me to the picture  gallery, and reeled off her changeless tale of the Kempion glories. In the  midst of such eloquence, a servant summoned her, and she left me, for the  moment, to my own devices. I walked slowly around, and ultimately faced three  portraits. Without doubt, they were those of James Kempion, his son Francis,  and La Senora. The men were handsome, and the lady was a charming brunette, who  smiled bewitchingly from the canvas.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page290.jpg" width="596" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that is Francis Kempion,&rdquo; I said aloud, looking at the brave, boyish face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is Francis Kempion,&rdquo; echoed a voice at my elbow. I turned, and saw the priest.  He was a tall, well-set man, with a keen face and restless eyes. &ldquo;What do you  know about Francis Kempion?&rdquo; said he sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  save that he was drowned,&rdquo; I answered&mdash;&ldquo;at least, so says the village gossip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  poor lad, he was&mdash;drowned,&rdquo; replied the Jesuit, bringing out the last word with  an effort which cast discredit on his training.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  Protestant, wasn&rsquo;t he, sir?&rdquo; said I, keeping my eyes on the picture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Kempions, sir, are devout sons of the true Church,&rdquo; he returned stiffly. &ldquo;I  perceive you are a stranger here.&rdquo; Then, in response to my bow, &ldquo;May I inquire  why you ask such a question?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Idle  curiosity, sir, nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the general opinion is in favour of Francis Kempion&rsquo;s death by drowning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Though for one who must have known every shoal and shallow of the coast, I  think it was unwise of him to have ventured into that current.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Father  Condy looked at me, and I at him. He was apparently trying to fathom my  meaning. However, I kept my face, and with a courteous bow he turned away.  Still looking at the picture, I caught a glimpse of his backward glance out of  the tail of my eye. Evidently my remark had aroused his suspicions.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page292.jpg" width="784" height="750"></p>
  <p>Near  the gates I met Kempion and La Senora riding homeward. When they saw me their  laughter ceased. She cast a cold look on me as I took off my hat, but a shadow  passed over his face.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page294.jpg" width="890" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder,&rdquo; thought I, setting my face gatewards&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder if John Kempion consented  to the kidnapping of his nephew so as to enjoy the property himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord  Tormouth was waiting eagerly for my return, and we talked for fully two hours.  He still clung to his idea that Francis had been spirited away by the Jesuit,  so that the Kempion revenues might revert once more to the Church. On the other  hand, I was inclined to suspect the present holder of the estates. In proof of  this I produced the peso. Lord Tormouth examined it, and shrugged his  shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think much of that,&rdquo; said he, turning it over; &ldquo;it might be a stray coin  of the Armada. &lsquo;Tis known that several treasure-ships of Mexican moneys were  wrecked on our coasts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  at the date, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eighteen  eighty-six,&rdquo; he read eagerly. &ldquo;Why! God bless me, sir! This coin was struck  last year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly!  Therefore it must have been brought from Mexico shortly before Francis  disappeared. I found it on the beach where he was last seen, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you think that his uncle had something to do with the kidnapping?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is my idea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he was in the house the whole evening. Francis went to bathe by himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  might have employed others to carry out his plans. John Kempion, you say, lived  most of his life in Mexico. Judging from the glimpse I had of his face, I  should say he was a trifle wild.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was a &lsquo;ne&rsquo;er-do-weel,&rsquo; as the Scotch say,&rdquo; replied Tormouth dryly, &ldquo;but he is  respectable now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you may be sure he knew a few desperate characters in Mexico who would kidnap  the lad for a small sum. One of them dropped that coin. It proves that its  owner must have come straight from Mexico. Such coinage is not common in  England, and so recent a one as that could not have got there by any other  means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be so,&rdquo; said the old lord doubtfully. &ldquo;But surely John Kempion would not  be such a scoundrel as to kidnap his own nephew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight  thousand a year is worth a crime,&rdquo; said I, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he did so the priest helped him. I won&rsquo;t give up my idea about the Jesuit. He  wanted a Catholic head to the family,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely Father Condy favoured the idea,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;but I think John Kempion  was the active party.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what do you propose to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  out to Mexico and make inquiries about John Kempion. If he employed some  Mexican desperado to kidnap Francis, the lad must have been taken out there. No  safer plan could be discovered. Beyond all law and order, without the pale of  civilization. Depend upon it, my lord, Francis Kempion is to be found in  Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  go at once,&rdquo; cried Lord Tormouth radiantly; &ldquo;draw on me for what moneys you  like. Start by the next boat, and spare nothing to find the lad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Within  a fortnight of this conversation I was on my way to Mexico. There is no  necessity to relate my wanderings in detail. They would spin out into three  volumes, and I have neither time nor space at command.</p>
  <p>So  far as relates to John Kempion, I struck his trail at Vera Cruz, followed it to  Zacatecas, and finished it at San Francisco. Thenceforward all was known to me,  as Lord Tormouth had related how Kempion, a guileless cattle-dealer, had left  the Golden Gate for the rocky Devon coast. He did not narrate the Mexican  history of the man. I found that out for myself.</p>
  <p>It  was a black record. I no longer wondered at the shadow on Kempion&rsquo;s face. A man  with a past such as his must have lived in perpetual fear of unwelcome visitors  turning up to spoil his respectability. Damocles was more comfortable under his  hair-suspended sword.</p>
  <p>In  six months I was back in London with a closely written pocket-book relative to  the career of John Kempion. The accidental dropping of the silver coin proved a  bad business for him. I remained in London to transact some necessary matters,  then I went West to report to Lord Tormouth. Before I related my story I asked  him what had transpired at Kempion Hall since my departure. His information  astonished me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not been away since you left Devonshire,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as I was determined to  keep a watch on Kempion and the Jesuit. In one way and another I learned all  that was going on. It did not require much ferreting out, as the scandal is now  patent to the whole neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  scandal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Touching  La Senora and a black countryman of hers, Don Miguel Pedroche.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;  I whistled, &ldquo;so <i>he</i> is here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  too well. So does John Kempion!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Tormouth reflectively, &ldquo;probably that is why he is afraid to kick Pedroche  out of the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  Is he staying at the Hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should just think so, much to the wrath of Father Condy. The priest can manage  Kempion, but not La Senora and her friend. Oh! it is a most reputable affair, I  assure you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord  Tormouth tapped his snuff-box, revived himself with a pinch, and continued the  story. It fitted in very neatly with what I already knew of Kempion and  Pedroche.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scarcely  had you departed,&rdquo; said his lordship, &ldquo;when this Spanish fellow came to the  Hall and quartered himself there. Neither Kempion nor Father Condy were very  pleased to see him, but the Senora made amends for the coldness of their  reception. Egad! she&rsquo;d have had him to stay with her at the Dower House but for  the priest&rsquo;s influence. I have seen the fellow, sir,&rdquo; continued Tormouth, in a  tone of disgust&mdash;&ldquo;I have seen the fellow kiss La Senora while they walked  together on the beach. Scandalous! most scandalous!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page296.jpg" width="481" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he her lover, think you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe so! The minx is not in love with John Kempion, as I thought. She is a  fool if she marries this Spanish pauper, though, to be sure,&rdquo; added Tormouth  thoughtfully, &ldquo;Kempion will have to support the pair of them. They know too  much for his comfort, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I am not so sure of the lady,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but certainly Pedroche knows about the  kidnapping of Francis,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Egad!  You don&rsquo;t say so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, and more. I say that he kidnapped the boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spanish  scoundrel!&rdquo; muttered my lord. &ldquo;At the instigation of Father Condy, no doubt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  At the instigation of John Kempion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wh-a-t!&rdquo;  said Tormouth angrily. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me, sir, that the man was  iniquitous enough to kidnap his own nephew?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so, my lord. This coin&mdash;this Mexican peso&mdash;dropped accidentally on the beach, was  the property of Don Miguel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  he been in these parts before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was on the beach the night Francis disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did he get there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  came in a yacht belonging to John Kempion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  know the man had a yacht! Didn&rsquo;t know the man had a sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Mexico he had a good many sixpences,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Oh, I could tell you some  strange facts about Kempion&rsquo;s career in those parts, but we had better stick to  the business in hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course! of course! How did the kidnapping take place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;John  Kempion, my lord, owned a schooner yacht with which he did business in the  Caribbean Sea. What that business was you may guess. His first mate was this  Pedroche.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  oh!&rdquo; said Lord Tormouth, with rising indignation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These  scamps made money and lost money. Business was bad when Kempion heard of his  brother&rsquo;s death, so he came home to see if he could not get the estates for  himself. Finding there was more law and order in England than in Mexico, he did  not care about risking hanging, so he decided to have the lad kidnapped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  he left Mexico he made a present of the schooner to Pedroche; and wrote him a  letter instructing him to come to the Devon coast and kidnap Francis. Pedroche  made his appearance at Falmouth as a Spanish gentleman travelling for pleasure.  If you remember, Kempion went to Plymouth about that time, where Pedroche met  him and arranged details. Francis was accustomed to swim in that bay every  night during the hot summer months, but he never ventured into the current.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what I said!&rdquo; exclaimed Tormouth triumphantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;During  the day that yacht lay behind Lundy Island, and crept shoreward when the night  fell. Thus few saw her, and those that did took no notice. No one would think  of connecting the disappearance of Francis Kempion with a gentleman&rsquo;s yacht.  The rest you can guess, my lord. A boat-load of scamps, commanded by Pedroche,  concealed themselves in the woods fringing the bay. When Francis was in the  water, they seized and carried him to Mexico. It was during the scuffle that  Pedroche dropped the coin which led to his undoing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page298.jpg" width="707" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  told you all this, sir?&rdquo; asked Tormouth, much agitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  gathered it from various sources, but principally from this gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  opened the door while speaking, and the next moment Francis Kempion was in the  old man&rsquo;s arms. Lord Tormouth prides himself on his self-control, but he broke  down altogether at this point. I felt rather queer myself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look first-rate, lad,&rdquo; he said, holding Francis at arm&rsquo;s length. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t  treat you badly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  during the voyage,&rdquo; replied Francis. &ldquo;Pedroche was very kind, but they held me  prisoner at Chihuahua, and I had rather a bad time of it there. Fortunately,  this gentleman found me out, and rescued me from their clutches. He wouldn&rsquo;t,  if Pedroche had been there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pedroche  had gone to England, I suppose, to make love to La Senora?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  quite that,&rdquo; I said significantly; &ldquo;he is her brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; said Tormouth, genuinely astonished. &ldquo;Then why is Kempion  jealous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he is not jealous, but enraged. The Spaniard, no doubt, conducts himself  insolently, and, having Kempion in his power, he can do what he likes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  biter bit,&rdquo; remarked Tormouth, with a rap at his snuff-box. &ldquo;By the way,  Francis, do you think La Senora is mixed up in this nefarious transaction?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure she is not,&rdquo; said the lad earnestly; &ldquo;she was very fond of me, and  behaved most kindly. My uncle alone is to blame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  it is not the priest, after all,&rdquo; observed the old lord irritably. &ldquo;I made sure  the Jesuit had something to do with it. Well! well! we will go over to-morrow,  and take back the rightful heir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a highly dramatic performance at Kempion Hall next day. Lord Tormouth  arranged the details. Francis was to appear at a given moment, and startle  Kempion in the midst of his lies. When we entered the Hall, the young man  pulled his slouch-hat over his eyes so as not to be recognized by the servants.  He need not have troubled. The present staff were strangers, as Kempion had  changed them during his occupancy. None of the old retainers approved of the  existing state of things. It was true that John Kempion resided at the Hall,  and La Senora dwelt in the Dower House two miles away; but the pair were always  together, constituting a scandal to their simple minds. The probability of a  marriage struck them as iniquitous. Father Condy thought so too, and had  frightened Kempion into acquiescence for the time being. Much as it pleased the  Jesuit to have a Catholic landowner under his thumb, he had anything but a  pleasant time in keeping matters respectable.</p>
  <p>The  butler announced myself and Lord Tormouth. Francis we left on the other side of  the drawing-room door for production when necessary. Rather startled by the  unexpected appearance of his enemy, Kempion arose to his feet, but La Senora  and Pedroche, who were also present, exhibited no surprise. They knew nothing  of Lord Tormouth&rsquo;s enmity to speak of, and received him as they would have any  other visitor. Both were smoking cigarettes, much to the disgust of the  punctilious old nobleman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother  of God!&rdquo; said La Senora, removing her cigarette, &ldquo;and who is this?&rdquo; She spoke  English very well, and so did her brother. They found the knowledge of tongues  useful in conducting shady transactions. I have no doubt, with that pretty  foreign lisp, La Senora had talked her way into the foolish heart of James  Kempion.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page302.jpg" width="510" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  Tormouth,&rdquo; said Kempion, looking very pale, as well he might, for he guessed  what was coming, &ldquo;why do you enter my house uninvited?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to speak seriously with you, Mr. Kempion, and also I desire to avoid  scandal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scandal,  my lord! That is an ugly word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know of an uglier,&rdquo; retorted Tormouth, whipping out his snuff-box&mdash;&ldquo;kidnapping!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pedroche  and La Senora glanced significantly at each other, but Kempion reddened with  anger. None of the family could keep their temper after provocation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have been looking into my life in Mexico,&rdquo; said he, with a harsh laugh. &ldquo;Plenty  of kidnapping there, no doubt, but what has that to do with England?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not alluding to Mexico, or to your villainies there, sir; I refer to the  loss of your nephew, Francis Kempion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was drowned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  poor child!&rdquo; sobbed La Senora noisily, &ldquo;he was drowned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pedroche  laughed, and she glanced fiercely at him out of the corner of her eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  loved him, Senora?&rdquo; said Tormouth, turning in her direction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I loved him! Ah, God! how I did love him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  all loved him,&rdquo; came the voice of Father Condy from some unseen corner, &ldquo;but he  is dead, poor soul. Why do you come here, my lord?&rdquo; he added, showing himself&mdash;&ldquo;why  do you come here to disturb the peace of this family?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think there is much peace under this roof,&rdquo; said Lord Tormouth quietly; &ldquo;but  I have no desire to prolong the scene, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  go,&rdquo; interrupted Condy, &ldquo;and take with you that spy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  complimentary allusion was directed at me, but I am used to being called names  in my profession, and I did not budge an inch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  spy, as you term him,&rdquo; observed Lord Tormouth, patting my shoulder, &ldquo;is a  detective who has found out your villainy. I allude to you, John Kempion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  mean you, my lord? I have been a villain, no doubt, but not for your calling.  By what right do you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the right of interest in Francis, your nephew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is deadl&rdquo; replied Kempion, &ldquo;drowned off the beach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw,  sir! Why keep up the farce? He is alive and well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alive  and well!&rdquo; echoed the other, with a dazed look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  mock me, sir,&rdquo; said my lord sharply. &ldquo;You know he is alive, and was kidnapped  by your orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Tis  a lie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  appeal to Don Miguel Pedroche!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  also say it is a lie, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Miguel. &ldquo;By all the saints, I saw not the  boy in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  he took a voyage with you to Mexico!&rdquo; said I. Pedroche looked surprised at my  knowledge, but said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not have my nephew kidnapped!&rdquo; cried Kempion fiercely. &ldquo;I have been a bad  enough man in my time, but of this charge I am innocent. I loved my brother and  my nephew, and I would have raised no hand against either. Why should I harm  the lad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you wanted the property.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not want the property. All I wished was to marry Mrs. Kempion here, and  return to Mexico; I hate your English life. Had I kidnapped the boy, I would  have been by my faith bound to have told Father Condy. Would he have kept  silent? Would he, a priest, have countenanced such injustice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tormouth  muttered something about priests being capable of all things, but was too  polite to say so out loud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  doubtless told Father Condy under the seal of confession,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;therefore,  by the rules of his Church, he was forced to hold his tongue. Besides,&rdquo; I  added, significantly, &ldquo;I have no doubt that Father Condy prefers a Catholic to  a Protestant at Kempion Hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wrong me,&rdquo; said the Jesuit, in a tone which made me feel mean. &ldquo;Mr. Kempion  made no such confession. Had he done so, I should have found means to have  righted the injustice done to the lad, Protestant though he be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  carry it off bravely, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Tormouth, in his most cutting tones, &ldquo;and,  had I not proof to the contrary, I might believe you. John Kempion,&rdquo; he added,  turning sharply, &ldquo;I say you kidnapped your nephew, and that Pedroche helped  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say you lie,&rdquo; retorted Kempion doggedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you welcome him back to rob you of your ease?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Willingly!  I take God to witness that the dearest wish of my heart is to see Francis  Kempion, my nephew, in his rightful position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  present had risen to their feet. La Senora was pale with terror, Kempion with  emotion. The face of Father Condy was set like a mask. Only Pedroche laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will never see him here,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Holy Mary, no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  response to a nod from Lord Tormouth, I opened the door. Francis strode into  the room, and confronted the baffled conspirators. Pedroche cursed in Spanish,  his sister shrieked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  is the lad himself,&rdquo; said Tormouth. &ldquo;Now, Kempion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  advanced, and took the young man by the hand, so as to assure himself that his  nephew was flesh and blood,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Welcome  back to your own, Francis,&rdquo; he said at length. &ldquo;I  am glad you have come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hypocrite!&rdquo;  muttered Tormouth, snapping the lid of his box.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can hardly believe your speech,&rdquo; said Francis coldly, &ldquo;seeing it was by your  orders I was carried off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  told you so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pedroche!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Spaniard tried to get out of the way, but Kempion was too sharp for him, and  had his grip on his throat in no time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  lying Spanish scoundrel!&rdquo; he swore, &ldquo;own up to the truth, or I&rsquo;ll choke the  life out of you! Did I order you to kidnap my nephew?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page306.jpg" width="575" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  gasped Pedroche. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kempion  hurled him on the floor, and faced us manfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  who is guilty?&rdquo; asked Tormouth, perplexed by the train of circumstances.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am,&rdquo; said La Senora, gliding forward with a look of rage on her face. &ldquo;Mother  of God! now this cub is back, I have lost all. Yes, I wrote to my brother,  and asked him to take away this fool. Was I to have but a few hundred pounds  while he had thousands? Well, I knew that if he were gone, John would make me  his wife, and all the money would be ours. Snake!&rdquo; she added, turning towards  Francis, &ldquo;always I hated you, but pretended to love, so that I could oust you  from here. John is innocent. I ordered it all. Miguel obeyed me; but now! now!  ah, cursed ones! you gain, and I lose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page308.jpg" width="505" height="750"></p>
  <p>She  rushed out of the room, followed by Father Condy. Evidently she had told all  this to the priest at confession, and he did not wish to be questioned about  it. His reign was over, as he well knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you believe me now?&rdquo; said Kempion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Tormouth and Francis simultaneously, &ldquo;we believe you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  there is nothing more to be said. This reptile has been the bane of my life. He  knew too much about my Mexican experiences for me to kick him out of here but  had I guessed his share in this black business, out he should have gone. By all  the saints, yes. As to Luisa, she is a woman, and not accountable for her  actions. Good-bye!&rdquo; and he strode towards the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are you going, uncle?&rdquo; asked Francis, blocking his way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Back  to the woods, lad. In spite of all, I shall marry Luisa, and be friends with  yonder scamp&mdash;it is my fate. Good-bye, nephew,&rdquo; he said, shaking the hand of  Francis. &ldquo;Do not think too badly of me. Come, Miguel, my brother-scamp, let us  depart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  caught Miguel by the arm and marched him, off. The door closed and we saw them  no more. The two Spaniards and Kempion went back to their own wild life, and no  doubt flourished under less rigorous laws. Father Condy went also. With a  Protestant at Kempion Hall he did not care about staying. Once more Francis entered  into his heritage, and now that Lord Tormouth looks after him there is no fear  of him being kidnapped a second time. As I was leaving, the old gentleman made  a remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry for John Kempion,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;there is more good in him than I thought.  But, had it not been for that Mexican coin, I might have deemed him a villain  all my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of  the reward he gave for finding Francis Kempion I say nothing. It concerns me  more than any one else.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="rainbow"></a>The Rainbow  Camellia</b></h2>
  <p>COUNTRY  solicitors have fewer opportunities than their urban brethren of handling  exceptional cases. The friction of metropolitan life develops numerous strange  episodes, which are of rarer occurrence in provincial centres. Human nature is  no doubt the same in country as in town; but the lack of a concentrated  population, by demanding less ingenuity on the part of the criminal, reduces  the level of crime. Moreover bucolic wits are not so keen as those sharpened by  the necessities of London life. Agrarian wrong-doers are usually commonplace rogues,  who sin in a crude fashion unworthy of notice. Crime, which in the capital is a  fine art, is in the country commonly the result of a childish outburst of  temper. These remarks apply peculiarly to the inhabitants of inland market  towns, and to the rural population of their intervening pasture-lands.</p>
  <p>Yet  at times a case not easily to be paralleled, even in the metropolis, comes  under the notice of a country solicitor. Such a one is that of the Rainbow  Camellia, which is, to my mind, unique in the annals of crime. It was simply a  case of theft, but sufficiently noticeable for the skilful way in which it was  planned and executed. My first intimation of the affair came from my wife, who  one morning entered the breakfast-room with a face expressive of consternation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fred,&rdquo;  said she, in an awestruck tone, &ldquo;do you remember Eliza Drupp the housemaid who  left six months ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  that the red-haired minx who smashed our best dinner-service, and who carried a  bottle of diamond cement in her pocket to mend breakages?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she has been arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not surprised. Whose dinner-service is it this time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  jest, Fred. I am very sorry for the poor girl, though she has been stealing.  Cook told me all about it. She is so excited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is excited, cook or Eliza?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cook,  of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  the dinner won&rsquo;t be fit to eat. I wish cook would gossip less, and attend more  to her stewing and frying. Give me my breakfast, Nell; I must be off early this  morning. Well,&rdquo; I added, as my wife poured out the coffee, &ldquo;and what has Eliza  Drupp been stealing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page315.jpg" width="800" height="465"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  rainbow camellia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  the whole plant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  only a bud. She went into the Gardens yesterday and picked it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Audacious  creature, she&rsquo;ll get six months for that. Old Bendel is on the Bench, and as he  is a prominent member of the Horticultural Society, Eliza need expect no mercy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what possessed her to do such a thing,&rdquo; said Nell reflectively; &ldquo;and  the worst of it is, that George Beanfield gave information about the theft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is George Beanfield, and why shouldn&rsquo;t he give information?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he kept company with her. It is a piece of spite on his part to punish Eliza  for taking up with the greengrocer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  congratulate you on your knowledge of kitchen gossip, Nell. But you have not  answered my question. Who is George Beanfield?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  gardener in the service of the Horticultural Society. I suppose he will be the  principal witness against poor Eliza. How can a man be so mean!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man scorned is as dangerous as a woman scorned my dear. Eliza should not have &lsquo;walked  out&rsquo; with the greengrocer. By the way, was George the man who used to hide in  the coal-cellar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  that was a soldier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  then he was the Gargantua who devoured all the cold meat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk nonsense, Fred. Go to your office, and if you hear anything of the case,  tell me when you come home. I am so sorry for poor Eliza.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was very charitable on the part of Nell. So far as I could remember Eliza Drupp  had been a sore trial, and I had frequently heard my wife express a hope that  the Drupp sins would come home to the Drupp sinner. Now that they had come in  the most satisfactory manner, she regretted the accomplishment of her wishes,  and pitied the recreant Eliza. I did not. It was impossible to pity a girl who  had cost me over twenty pounds in breakages.</p>
  <p>When  I reached my office, I received a message from Eliza, requesting me to step  round to her cell, and discuss, the matter. As fish did not come to my net in  sufficient quantities to make me despise even such small fry as Eliza, I  accepted the invitation, and speedily found myself in the presence of my former  housemaid. She was to be brought before Bendel that very morning, so there was  no time to be lost in learning what defence she proposed to make.</p>
  <p>To  judge of the heinousness of Eliza&rsquo;s offence, it is necessary to state that the  Horticultural Society of Foxton is the sole owner of the famous rainbow  camellia. That unique plant had been brought from China many years ago by a  vagrant Foxtonian, and it was the only one in existence on this side of the  world. The Foxton Society prided itself on the possession of this rarity, the  more so as such possession excited the envy of all rival societies. Of these  many had attempted to beg, borrow, buy or steal slips of the plant in order to  raise rainbow camellias on their own account; but hitherto not one had secured  even a single bud. It was reserved for Eliza to commit that crime.</p>
  <p>The  blossom was streaked with the seven colours of the rainbow&mdash;hence its name&mdash;and  as a further priceless qualification it emitted a distinct odour. Now as, with  this exception, a scented camellia is absolutely unknown, it was only natural  that the Foxton horticulturists should set a high value on their ownership. I  thought myself that their enthusiasm was exaggerated, as the prosperity of  Foxton did not entirely depend on the possession of that striped and scented  flower; but then I am not a flower-fancier, and I cannot appreciate the  passions of horticulturists. Those of Foxton were quite offensive in their  pride. If Eliza Drupp had stolen the Crown jewels the theft would have been a  mere venial transgression: but that she should cull a single bud of the rainbow  camellia placed her beyond the pale of ordinary sinners.</p>
  <p>Eliza  was tearful but voluble. She had been born within sound of Bow Bells, and  talked with a strong cockney accent, which became more marked with increasing  agitation. How this child of the London pavement had drifted to Foxton I do not  know, but she had served as housemaid in various houses for the last four years,  and was accustomed when out of a situation, which happened frequently on  account of her destructive propensities, to visit her parents at Hackney. Her  town graces and brazen good looks&mdash;our cook said they were brazen&mdash;attracted many  admiring swains. The vengeful George was one of these, but Eliza had jilted him  in favour of the more opulent greengrocer. Nemesis in the person of the  deserted gardener was now punishing her for such perfidy.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page318.jpg" width="520" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Ow  &lsquo;e&rsquo;s treated me shaimful,&rdquo; said the tearful Eliza; &ldquo;jest &lsquo;cause I wouldn&rsquo;t  taike &lsquo;im &lsquo;e shows me up loike this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you play with fire, Eliza, you burn your fingers as a natural consequence. But  this is not the point. Have you any defence to this charge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should soigh so, sir. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t trew es I stole thet measly kemmelliar. Whoy, it  was my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now, that&rsquo;s nonsense. The Foxton rainbow camellia is the only one of its kind  in England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t  the only one in the world anyhow, sir,&rdquo; retorted Eliza, with some heat. &ldquo;I hev  a rinebow kemmelliar et &lsquo;Ackney. If you don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;li&rsquo;ve me jest send up to my  father an&rsquo; see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean to say that you possess a plant of the same species?&rdquo; I asked, rather  astonished at this information.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Course  I do, sir. My brother &lsquo;e&rsquo;s a steward &lsquo;e is; &lsquo;e goes to Chiner on the Three Star  Loine, sir. &lsquo;E browght it to me fower years ago from furren parts &lsquo;e did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the flower you wore was off your own bush?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yuss.  I kim &lsquo;ere yesterdaiy from &lsquo;Ackney, an&rsquo; I browght it with me jest to see if  moine was loike this &lsquo;un &lsquo;ere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you wear it when you entered the Gardens?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, I &lsquo;ed it in a paiper beg, an&rsquo; when I was in the green&rsquo;ouse I takes it  hout. When I sawr it wure the saime, I pins it in moy dress. Then that bloomin&rsquo;  gonoph collared me. D&rsquo;ye see, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see, but how is it that a blossom is missing from the tree?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;no, sir. &lsquo;Tworn&rsquo;t me as took it, sir. You jist telergrarf to moy father at &lsquo;Ackney  an&rsquo; arsk &lsquo;im to bring down moy kemmelliar, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;ll do that, but as he cannot be down in time for the case to-day, I&rsquo;ll ask  for a remand, so that I may ascertain the truth of your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thenk  &lsquo;ee, sir. Em I to staiy &lsquo;ere, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope not, I will be security for your bail myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thet  is &lsquo;ensome on yer, sir. An&rsquo; if yer sees thet there George Beanfield, sir, jist  tell &lsquo;im as &lsquo;ow I&rsquo;ll scretch &lsquo;is eyes out of &lsquo;is &lsquo;ed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no necessity for me to deliver this agreeable message. She did so herself  when brought before the magistrate. Beanfield seemed to appreciate the  situation, and to congratulate himself that Eliza was restrained from violence  by two stout policemen. As long as possible he remained modestly in the  background, and it was with manifest reluctance that he came forward when  called upon to enter the witness-box. The lady in the dock glared at him with a  mixture of scorn and rage, and again proclaimed her determination to &ldquo;scretch &lsquo;is  eyes out.&rdquo; When ordered to be silent she relapsed into tears and said she was  being &ldquo;put upon.&rdquo; I had heard her make this remark before when gently corrected  for breaking three plates in succession.</p>
  <p>The  court was filled with infuriated members of the Horticultural Society, who  wished Eliza to be forthwith hanged and quartered. It was commonly reported  that my client had not only picked the flower but had also stolen a slip of the  plant, which she designed to sell to a rival society. Believing that Eliza thus  intended to rob Foxton of the glory of solely possessing the rainbow camellia,  the horticulturists thought no punishment too severe for so abandoned a  creature. I applied for a remand, which old Bendel (who was a rabid member of  the society) was disposed to refuse. I pointed out that, in the interests of  justice, the prisoner should be granted sufficient time to communicate with her  friends, and prove herself innocent of the charge. Bendel did not believe she  had a defence, and said as much, but after considerable argument I managed to  obtain an adjournment for three days. In the matter of bail I was unsuccessful,  as the magistrate declined to allow Eliza to be at large until the matter had  been legally threshed out. He was supported in this decision by his angered  confreres, who had already judged and condemned the delinquent housemaid. The  ultimate outcome of my application was the removal of Eliza to her former  captivity.</p>
  <p>When  instructing the parental Drupp by letter as to the misfortune which had  befallen his daughter, I suggested that, to clear her character, he should  forthwith bring with him to Foxton the Hackney camellia. As to the existence of  this plant I had my doubts, expecting that Eliza had mistaken the variegated  scentless camellia for the unique plant of Foxton. But the bush brought by  Drupp proved to be of the same genus. It was streaked with seven colours, it  was scented, and, as a proof that Eliza was innocent, it still bore the stem  whence the bud, alleged to have been stolen from the Foxton greenhouse, had  been reft. Her story thus proved to be true, but I thought it strange that, at  such a juncture, a blossom should also be missing from our local plant. The coincidence  was peculiar, the inference doubtful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Moy  daughter growed this &lsquo;ere,&rdquo; explained Drupp, who was quite as cockney in speech  as Eliza; &ldquo;et was browght from Chiner by moy son Sam, es is a stewart on the <i>Mendeloy</i>. Ses Lizer t&rsquo; me t&rsquo;other doy, &lsquo;  &lsquo;Oi&rsquo;ll jest tike a flower t&rsquo; Foxton an&rsquo; see if thet kemmelliar es th&rsquo; saime es  moine.&rsquo; Which she did, an&rsquo; now thi&rsquo;ve put &lsquo;er in quod. Oi &lsquo;opes, sir, es &lsquo;ow  thi&rsquo;ll let &lsquo;er orf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  so clear a defence I thought it extremely probable that they would let her off;  but as old Bendel was on the Bench I knew the fight would be a tough one. Had  Eliza worn the bud when she entered the Gardens, her innocence would have been  proved beyond all doubt. Still as the matter stood I had every hope of clearing  her character.</p>
  <p>When  Eliza was again placed in the dock the court was even more crowded than on the  former occasion. A rumour had originated&mdash;I know not how&mdash;that a plant similar to  that owned by the society would be put in evidence by the defence. As in duty  bound no horticulturist believed this fable. As well say there were two Queens  of England, as two rainbow camellias. The Foxton plant was displayed in all its  glory, and, lost in admiration, the onlookers exclaimed that there was none  like unto it. This biblical exclamation is suitable to the scene, for the plant  might have been the golden image of Nebuchadnezzar, so abjectly did its  worshippers grovel before it. The mere sight of the missing bud roused them to  wrathful denunciations against its ravisher.</p>
  <p>When  brought before the magistrate, Eliza wept loudly; but on the appearance of  George in the witness-box, she recovered her spirits, and called him names.  Then she again relapsed into tears, and sniffed provokingly during the  subsequent proceedings.</p>
  <p>Beanfield  deposed that Eliza was not wearing the flower when she entered the Gardens, but  he admitted that she had carried a paper bag, which he feebly conjectured to  contain biscuits. He had exchanged no words with her, as they were not on  friendly terms, but he declared that she had made a face at him, and had  derisively put out her tongue. When he saw her again, the bud&mdash;produced in  court&mdash;was fastened in the bosom of her dress. He at once inspected the rainbow  camellia, and found a blossom missing, upon which evidence he had given Eliza  in charge for theft.</p>
  <p>Another  gardener proved that no buds were wanting when he saw the plant half-an-hour  before Eliza&rsquo;s visit. He was followed by the President of the Horticultural  Society, who stated that outside China, to which the species was indigenous,  there was no rainbow camellia in existence. The bud produced in court could  only have been taken from the Foxton greenhouse. His assertion of the  uniqueness of the plant was received with great applause by his  fellow-horticulturists.</p>
  <p>Their  jaws dropped when old Drupp brought forward Eliza&rsquo;s specimen. At first they  insisted that the petals were painted, but when by direction of old Bendel the  plant was handed round, and handled, and smelt, and thoroughly examined, they  were reluctantly compelled to admit that it was a genuine rainbow camellia. The  admission almost drew tears from their eyes, and they mourned Ichabod! Ichabod!  The two plants placed on either side of the magistrate appeared to closely  resemble one another, save that Eliza&rsquo;s was the smaller of the two. I forgot to  mention that the Hackney plant had eight buds while the Foxton plant showed  twelve. As a blossom had been plucked from each, these were respectively  reduced to seven and eleven.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page326.jpg" width="516" height="750"></p>
  <p>Drupp&rsquo;s  evidence in conjunction with the production of the plant turned the scale in  favour of Eliza. It was all plain sailing when he opened his mouth. The plant  belonged to his daughter; it had been brought from China by her brother the  steward; under her care it had grown and flowered; and she had plucked a bud to  compare with the blooms of the Foxton bush. No link was wanting in the chain of  evidence to prove the innocence of the prisoner, and Bendel was reluctantly  compelled to discharge her without a stain on her character. I say reluctantly,  because he could not forgive Eliza for owning a duplicate of the Foxton fetich,  and, taking every possible advantage, he delivered a smart lecture to its  iniquitous possessor. There was no applause when Eliza left the dock.</p>
  <p>Restored  to freedom, she sought George Beanfield; but he, mindful of her threat, had  departed long since. He left the town, he even left the country, for a letter  addressed from the Continent was received by the president of the society,  which cleared up the mystery of the missing Foxton bud. George stated that in  attending to the plant he had accidentally knocked off a blossom and, fearful  of a reprimand, had burnt it in the greenhouse fire, The appearance of Eliza  with a similar bud to that destroyed had afforded him an opportunity of hiding  his delinquency, by making her the scapegoat. He did not offer any opinion as  to how he thought Eliza had become possessed of the blossom when the one  missing from the bush had been destroyed by himself.</p>
  <p>Thus  was the innocence of Eliza proved beyond all doubt, and, angered by the unjust  aspersions cast on her, she proceeded forthwith to turn the tables on her  accusers. The morning following her acquittal, she appeared in my office with a  wrathful countenance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  sir,&rdquo; said she viciously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m agowin&rsquo; to hev a action agin thim Gardins fur  lockin&rsquo; me up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the action never came off. The society, knowing it had no defence, owned that  it was in the wrong, and offered to compromise. Moreover they feared lest Eliza  should sell her plant to a rival society, and thus rob Foxton of the glory of  solely possessing the rainbow camellia. After some correspondence, they agreed  to settle the action for five hundred pounds, provided Eliza gave them her  plant. This she did, and having received her damages, and paid my fees, she  disappeared from Foxton.</p>
  <p>A  month afterwards my wife again brought up the subject of Eliza Drupp. As usual,  the cook was her informant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fred,&rdquo;  said she; &ldquo;Eliza Drupp?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what has she been doing now? Stolen another camellia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  She has married George Beanfield.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fellow who gave evidence against her? Impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true. Cook has this morning received a piece of the wedding cake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  all I can say is, that Eliza is of a most forgiving disposition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no patience with her,&rdquo; replied my wife. &ldquo;But I think she is ashamed to  return to Foxton. She and George have gone to South America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very sensible step to take,&rdquo; said I, weary of the subject. &ldquo;They can set up on  the proceeds of the trial At all events we have heard the last of Eliza Drupp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  remark was premature, for in less than twelve months I was again discussing  Eliza, and learning the reason of her eccentric behaviour.</p>
  <p>It  was on board the <i>Mandalay</i> that I  heard the truth concerning the matrimonial alliance of our former housemaid. I  was ordered to take a sea voyage for the benefit of my health, and as Nell  refused to come on the plea of being a bad sailor, I was obliged to make the  journey alone. One place was much the same as another to me, provided the  instructions of my physician were carried out; so, taking the first chance that  presented itself, I embarked for China on a Three Star Liner. The ship was  comfortable, the passengers sociable, and the table excellent, so the voyage  promised to be very pleasant. As a description thereof is not pertinent to the  story, I proceed at once to the episode which brought up again the name of  Eliza Drupp.</p>
  <p>Among  the stewards figured a red-haired creature, freckled and stumpy. He was neither  my table nor berth attendant, yet he never failed, when by accident I caught  his eye, to salute me with a knowing grin. This mark of recognition led me to  examine him closely, in the expectation of finding a former client or servant.  I could not recall his features, yet they seemed to be familiar to me. We were  in the Bay of Biscay when I spoke to him. The ship was rolling heavily, and on  my way to lie down in my cabin, I met with my red-polled friend. He smiled as  usual, whereupon I asked him if he knew me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir,&rdquo; said he with a grin, &ldquo;but &lsquo;Lizer knows y&rsquo;, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page330.jpg" width="499" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lizer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;  sister, sir, &lsquo;Lizer Drupp es was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that accounts for the familiar look of your face. You are her brother Sam.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir.  Shell I &lsquo;elp y&rsquo; long t&rsquo; y&rsquo; bunk, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this unexpected meeting the circumstances of the case recurred to my mind, and  I was pleased to meet with Sam. It was he who had brought the camellia to  Eliza, and I wished to learn where he procured it, and also why his sister had  married her enemy. Sam was not unlike my former client, but, owing to his  vocation, he had a less pronounced cockney accent. At times, however, the  Londoner peeped out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  is Eliza?&rdquo; I asked, when safely bestowed in my bunk. &ldquo;And where is Eliza?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Paraguay with &lsquo;er &lsquo;usband, sir. They&rsquo;re es &lsquo;eppy es th&rsquo; doy es long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is rather curious, Drupp, considering her husband was a witness in that case of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sam  interrupted me at this moment by laughing violently. I checked his untoward  mirth with a frown, whereupon he wiped his eyes and apologized.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Scuse  me, sir, but I ken&rsquo;t &lsquo;elp laufin&rsquo; when I thenk of thet &lsquo;ere caise. Y&rsquo; got &lsquo;Lizer  foive &lsquo;un&rsquo;red, y&rsquo; did, sir. She an&rsquo; George &lsquo;ave bowght a ranch in Paraguay an&rsquo;  are gitting on fine. Don Jorge &lsquo;e is now, sir, an&rsquo; &lsquo;Lizer&rsquo;s quite t&rsquo; laidy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  bad luck was the cause of her good luck,&rdquo; said I epigrammatically; &ldquo;it was a  fortunate thing for Eliza that you brought her that rainbow camellia from  China.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sam  grinned, and again apologized.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  y&rsquo;, sir, I didn&rsquo;t bring no camelliar fro&rsquo; Chiner, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how did Eliza become possessed of the second plant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;George,  sir; &lsquo;e got er a slip off t&rsquo; Foxton plant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;George!&rdquo;  repeated I in amazement; &ldquo;but he gave evidence against her. If he got her the  slip he must have known that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Course  &lsquo;e did, sir. It was all ploy-actin&rsquo;. &lsquo;Lizer wrote &lsquo;ome an&rsquo; told all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you can tell me all about it, Drupp. As I conducted the case I should like to  hear the sequel. It may explain why Eliza married Beanfield.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thet  it do, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, grinning. &ldquo;It were this waiy, sir. &lsquo;Lizer &lsquo;ad no money,  an&rsquo; George &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t enough to marry on. Th&rsquo;y wanted to git spliced, an&rsquo; so &lsquo;it on  a plan to git money. &lsquo;Lizer she was readin&rsquo; about a cove es got a thousan&rsquo; poun&rsquo;s  fur bein&rsquo; put in quod when &lsquo;e was innercent, so she ses t&rsquo; George, &lsquo;Cawn&rsquo;t we  try the saime gaime on an&rsquo; git enough t&rsquo; marry on?&rsquo; An&rsquo; George, sir, &lsquo;ad an  idear&mdash;&lsquo;e&rsquo;s a long-&rsquo;eaded chap, sir&mdash;fur bein&rsquo; a gardiner to t&rsquo; Foxton Society &lsquo;e  knew whot a lot th&rsquo;y thought of thet blessed camelliar. So &lsquo;e steals a slip an&rsquo;  tells &lsquo;Lizer to mek it grow, an&rsquo; to tell father es I browght it fro&rsquo; Chiner.  She arsked me t&rsquo; soy so, an&rsquo; not knowin&rsquo; &lsquo;er gaime I sid so. But I never knowed  anythin&rsquo; about it, sir. Then &lsquo;Lizer meks it grow es George ses, tho&rsquo; &lsquo;twas a  long toime growin&rsquo;. When t&rsquo; flowers come, she taiks one t&rsquo; Foxton an&rsquo; walks  into th&rsquo; green&rsquo;ouse an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see, it was all arranged between them so as to sue the society and get damages?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir.  George nipped off a bud an&rsquo; burnt it, &lsquo;e did. Then &lsquo;Lizer, wearin&rsquo; &lsquo;er own,  comes out an&rsquo; &lsquo;e puts &lsquo;er in quod.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  between the two of them they clear &pound;500?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir,  an&rsquo; then &lsquo;e marries &lsquo;er. D&rsquo;y&rsquo; see, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see, Drupp, and I must say they are a nice pair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thet  th&rsquo;y are, sir. I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a spilt their gaime &lsquo;ad I know&rsquo;d it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  delivering this opinion Drupp departed and I was left to ruminate over his  story. I quite believed that he was ignorant of the plot, but I was satisfied  that had he known he would only have held his tongue if well paid. It was  useless to give the benefit of the doubt to one who was of the same stock as  Eliza. That artful girl knew her family too well to entrust them with her  secret, and, less legal expenses, she and her fellow-conspirator got the whole  of the damages to themselves. Much as I condemned their rascality, I could not  but admire the cleverness with which they had planned and carried out their  scheme. They had deceived Drupp, they had deceived the society, they had  deceived me. Their comedy was extremely well acted, and ended quite to their  satisfaction. Therefore I say that country wits are at times equal to those of  townbred folks, for though the idea was Eliza&rsquo;s, the conception and execution  of the scheme emanated from the bucolic brain of George.</p>
  <p>I  told the whole story to my wife when I returned home, and she was very severe  on her former housemaid. Naturally enough she could not keep it to herself, and  in a short time the history of the deception soon became town talk. At first  the members of the Horticultural Society were angered at being so treated, but  as the delinquents were in South America, it was wisely concluded to let the  matter drop. They possessed both rainbow camellias, and, warned by the trickery  of George and Eliza, watched the plants with renewed vigilance. I do not think  that any one else will have the chance of stealing a slip of the Foxton fetich,  but should a third rainbow camellia make its appearance in the market, old  Bendel is quite resolved not to be hoodwinked a second time. He often regrets  that he did not give Eliza six months, but is too late now, as the conspirators  are farming in Paraguay. They ought to rear a rainbow camellia, if only to  remind them of their iniquity.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ivory_leg"></a>The Ivory  Leg And The Twenty-Four Diamonds</b></h2>
  <p>MEMBERS  of a family may be selfishly proud of their individual perfections, yet take a  collective pride in some special attribute or possession of their race. The O&rsquo;Gradys,  for instance, flatter themselves on owning a genuine Banshee; the Macsniffs  think highly of the hoary tower built by Noah Macsniff to escape a second Flood;  and the Fitztudors are proud of their royal descent from a frail ancestress and  a dissolute king. Such-like trifles give satisfaction to the most aristocratic  families, and raise them (in their own estimation) above the commonalty. These  do not recognize Adamic relationship otherwise than that they belong to the  human race.</p>
  <p>The  Dreuxfields, having made money by army contracting during the Peninsular War,  cast round for some fetich to boast of, to expatiate on, and to bore their  friends with. They had no ancestors worth talking about; their baronial halls  were a recent purchase, and the family ghost of the former proprietors, not  being a fixture, had passed away with the ancient stock. Ultimately they hit on  jewels as the most respectable things to be proud of, and, in pursuance of the  idea, they acquired twenty-four diamonds the like of which had never been seen  since Aladdin looted the Cave of the Lamp.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page340.jpg" width="523" height="750"></p>
  <p>These  were not all bought at once, or by one person. Such wholesale buying would have  reduced the whole affair to the level of a Bond Street purchase. The collecting  of these gems took time and money, and (possibly) the loss of immortal souls.  For the last fifty years every member of the family who could beg, borrow, buy,  or steal a particularly fine diamond, forthwith contributed the same to the  Dreuxfield fetich. Each jewel, worth no end of money, had a history, reputable  or otherwise, and, finally, four-and-twenty gems of the first water were  brought together to constitute the heirloom of the Dreuxfields.</p>
  <p>The  fetich ever consisted of these twenty-four diamonds, but the stones varied in  the setting according to the taste of the Mrs. Dreuxfield then in possession.  They glittered a tiara for display at St. James&rsquo;s, or flamed a jewelled belt  for a waist. Sometimes they separated into bracelets of twelve gems each, or  again collected into a necklace shooting twenty-four sparks of fire. In this  latter form they were now, as the present Mrs. Dreuxfield&rsquo;s fine neck and  shoulders formed an admirable background for the display of their splendour.</p>
  <p>Experts  valued the necklace at twenty thousand pounds, and it fully justified in worth  and appearance the pride of its possessors. All the thieves in London had seen  those diamonds going to Court on the fair neck of Mrs. Dreuxfield, and had  calculated the chances of getting them into their clutches. They never found an  opportunity of stealing them, however, as when not in use they reposed in the strong-room  of Dreuxfield Hall, Malvern, the key of which was attached to the Squire&rsquo;s watch-chain.  Yet, notwithstanding the impossibility of a successful raid, one famous  cracksman swore loudly that he would yet steal the jewels. So far he had not  succeeded. His name was Cracky Bill, of Whitechapel, and he was wanted by the  police. Cecil Dreuxfield, who had lately succeeded to the property, was a young  man of thirty, whose parents dying within a year of each other had left him and  his wife in possession of the Hall and the diamonds. With them lived Cecil&rsquo;s  sister Kate and Mrs. Dreuxfield&rsquo;s uncle, Josiah Onslow. The young couple were  handsome and agreeable, the sister was a pretty girl fond of the Curate, and  the uncle a bad-tempered ancient who owned an ivory leg. This latter curiosity  deserves special mention.</p>
  <p>It  is not every man who possesses an artificial limb made of ivory, and the Major  (he had retired from service of the H.E.I.C. with that rank) was as proud of it  as was Pelops of his ivory shoulder. Not born a Dreuxfield, he took no especial  interest in the necklace, and bestowed all superfluous pride on his ivory leg.  Onslow had imagination, and should have been a novelist. As it was, he told  stories about that leg which outvied the &ldquo;Arabian Nights.&rdquo; There were fifty  distinct narratives as to how he had lost his limb and gained the artificial  understanding. He never repeated himself, and lied like a journalist short of  news. The leg was turned like that of a pianoforte, and carved out of all  smoothness. If any one asked him if it was vegetable ivory he threw everything  handy at the head of the inquirer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vegetable  ivory, you qualified fool!&rdquo; he would roar, &ldquo;no! genuine ivory&mdash;elephants&rsquo; tusks,  bless me! The Rajah of Dum-Dum gave me the leg for losing my own in killing a  heavenly elephant that blessed nearly killed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  adjectives in this speech must be read contrariwise.</p>
  <p>Onslow  was not a nice man, and no great favourite with the young trio. He drank  sherry, which was bad for his liver, and played cards for stakes ruinous to his  meagre purse. Only the love Dreuxfield had for his wife prevented him turning  her relation out of doors. By dint of much self-control they put up fairly well  with his tantrums, and were glad when he visited London (which he did twice or  thrice a month) to lose money at his favourite pastime.</p>
  <p>No  one loved the old reprobate. Not even his servant, whom he bullied  unmercifully. Perhaps the present valet had not been long enough in his  situation to love the Major, for he was a new importation. Onslow rarely kept  his men longer than a month. The incessant exercise of dodging missiles wore  them thin. The new valet fared better, as he was deferential, and had been an  attendant in a lunatic asylum. Moreover, he took a great interest in the Major&rsquo;s  ivory leg, and, when it was unstrapped at night, he always carried it to his  own room to polish up for the morning. These little attentions pleased the  crusty old man.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page342.jpg" width="602" height="750"></p>
  <p>One evening in April the Curate came to dinner. He was a  handsome, earnest young fellow, much in love with Kate Dreuxfield. His  affection was returned, and it seemed probable that there would be a match.  Every one favoured the idea, save Major Onslow, who hated the Curate like  poison. All the scandal he could father about the parson he repeated to Cecil,  but as he had discounted his veracity by ivory leg stories, this gossip merely  provoked distrust. After dinner the Curate followed Kate into the drawing-room,  where he made love, with the consent and in the presence of Mrs. Dreuxfield.  Cecil, left alone with Onslow, drank his wine, smoked his cigar, and listened  to the Major raging. He was particularly offensive this evening, and his  speeches need expurgation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hate that sneaking parson,&rdquo; he began without preamble. Dreuxfield interrupted  him smartly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are in the minority then. Jenny, Kate, and myself think no end of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Particularly  Kate,&rdquo; sneered the Major. &ldquo;I suppose she will marry the fellow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  by the fellow you mean Clarence Newall, I have no doubt she will,&rdquo; retorted  Cecil, pointedly. &ldquo;I know of no man to whom I would so willingly give my sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you didn&rsquo;t like parsons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you thought wrong, sir. I am not aware of having manifested any particular  dislike to the Church. Besides, I was at college with Newall, and I know him to  be a good, honest fellow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  heard different stories,&rdquo; said Onslow, enraged by these contradictions; &ldquo;it is  said that Newall was in a fast set.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe;  but he was not fast himself. You are thinking of his cousin, Clive Newall&mdash;the  initials are the same, the natures are not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  believe in him, I see,&rdquo; said the Major, huffily, making for the door, &ldquo;but,  mark my words, he&rsquo;ll sell you yet. I never knew a parson that didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Newall  is quite sound, Major&mdash;as sound as that ivory leg you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  speech was interrupted by the banging of the door. Onslow did not like his leg  being made a jest of, and, moreover, finding he was getting the worst of it, he  retired to bed. By no means sorry to see the back of this cantankerous elder,  Cecil finished his claret, and went to the drawing-room. Here he found the two  ladies and Newall in eager conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Major has gone to bed, Jenny,&rdquo; he said to his wife. &ldquo;Lost his temper, as usual.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page344.jpg" width="588" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a cross old man he is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dreuxfield, shrugging her shoulders. &ldquo;Cecil  dear, I hope he has not vexed you. I really think we ought to take away his  ivory leg until he promises to behave better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind, Jenny,&rdquo; whispered Kate, &ldquo;he is going to town to-morrow, and will be away  some days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look tired, Newall,&rdquo; said Dreuxfield, patting his friend on the shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been busy to-day,&rdquo; answered the Curate, &ldquo;and, besides, I&rsquo;m rather worried  over a family matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  scamp Clive again?&rdquo; asked Cecil in a low voice.</p>
  <p>Newall  nodded, and would have continued speaking but that Kate interposed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you two talking about?&rdquo; she said; then, without waiting for an answer,  added, &ldquo;Oh, Cecil, I want you to show Mr. Newall the necklace. He has never  seen it, and you promised me this morning at breakfast to bring it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  to the next Drawing-room, Mr. Newall,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dreuxfield, amiably, &ldquo;and you  shall see it on my neck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think he would like a closer inspection,&rdquo; laughed Cecil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch it down  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo;  said Newall, eagerly, &ldquo;you have no idea how anxious I am to see the Dreuxfield  diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a curious odour,&rdquo; observed Dreuxfield, sniffing; &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t any drugs in your  pockets, have you, Newall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I know of,&rdquo; replied the Curate, smiling, &ldquo;but I was taking some medicine  to a parishioner to-day, and the cork came out of the bottle. No doubt some of  the contents were spilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that is it! You ought to be more careful. I declare you scent the room like  a&mdash;perambulating drug shop. Sweet! heavy! sickly&mdash;ah! ah! Chloroform!&rdquo; finished  Cecil, and departed for the strong room.</p>
  <p>It  seemed to Kate, who was watching his face, that her lover paled a trifle at  this last remark. The momentary emotion passed, but she thought it strange.  Then they fell to talking of the necklace and its worth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  declare,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dreuxfield, with a pretty shudder &ldquo;that I am always nervous  when going to the Drawing-room. To sit in a carriage with hundreds of curious  eyes fastened on those diamonds is enough to shake stronger nerves than mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see why you should fear, Jenny. No one can steal that necklace! It is too  well guarded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us hope no one will attempt so daring a theft. Ah! here comes Dreuxfield with  the jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cecil  placed the morocco box on the table and lifted the lid. In the lamplight a  glory streamed from the twenty-four gems. Even the two women, well accustomed to  the sight, could not restrain a little cry of delighted surprise. Newall drew a  long breath and gazed steadfastly at the glitter before him. The stones, but  slightly set and connected, flashed a circle of sunbeams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  king&rsquo;s ransom!&rdquo; he said, and turned away as if to shut out the too fascinating  sight. They amused themselves with the necklace for some time and then closed  the box. It was left on the table. Shortly afterwards the ladies retired to  bed, and Newall went up to the smoking-room with Dreuxfield. Hardly were they  outside the drawing-room door when Cecil uttered an ejaculation of annoyance.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page348.jpg" width="511" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a fool I am!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I quite forgot the necklace. You know where the  smoking-room is, Newall. Just go to it while I replace the diamonds in the  strong room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Newall  assented and moved away, while Dreuxfield went back for the necklace. The box  was still on the table, and a glance inside assured him that the jewels were  safe. Blaming himself for his inconceivable rashness in leaving the treasure  even for a moment, he went to the strong-room. It was on the ground-floor, and  approached by a long and somewhat dark passage. With the case under his arm  Dreuxfield fumbled at the lock of the door, when suddenly an arm was thrown  round his neck, choking the cry on his lips. A cloth saturated with chloroform  was clapped over his mouth, and he heard the morocco box clatter to the floor  as he lost his senses.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dreuxfield in her dressing-room chattered with Kate about the Curate, and  playfully bantered her on her chances of becoming a clergyman&rsquo;s wife. Then Kate  retired, and Mrs. Dreuxfield prepared for bed. Somewhat astonished at the  unusual absence of her husband, she was about to seek the smoking-room and  reprove him when she heard a loud cry. In a few minutes she was down-stairs,  and found Newall in the hall bending over the unconscious body of Cecil.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page350.jpg" width="568" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter?&rdquo; she cried, alarmed by this spectacle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; gasped Newall, with a remarkably pale face; &ldquo;he left me to put  away the jewels. I waited his return in the smoking-room. He did not appear,  and I went in search of him. He was lying unconscious by the strong-room door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  the time this breathless explanation came to an end, the whole household  thronged the hall. Last of all the Major, followed by his valet Jenkins,  stumped down the stairs, loudly excusing himself for so late an arrival.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jenkins  took my ivory leg to his room to clean,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I came down the instant  it was strapped on. Now what is all this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Explanations  were made, a doctor appeared on the scene, and Cecil sat up confusedly to give  his version of the episode.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chloroform!&rdquo;  exclaimed the doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  diamonds!&rdquo; said Dreuxfield. &ldquo;I have been robbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  explanation did not mend matters. The moment before they had been concerned for  the safety of their master, now each and all wondered what was the penalty for  robbery. Pale servants looked askance at one another, and the female domestics  shrieked themselves into hysterics. Kate kept her head and bore Mrs. Dreuxfield  to her room, leaving the men to deal with the matter. Unfortunately, at so late  an hour, little could be done, so there was nothing left for it but to wait  till dawn opened the telegraph office. Newall, finding himself useless in  advising and doing, went home in company with the doctor. Cecil and the Major  retired to bed, but not to sleep. Few eyes were closed at Dreuxfield Hall that  night, and the air was charged with terror and suspicion. The diamond necklace  was gone, but no one, least of all its owner, knew who had thieved it so  dexterously.</p>
  <p>The  next morning Dreuxfield wired for detectives and called in the local police. I  (who tell the story) was deputed to look after the case, and on arriving at  Malvern I was put in possession of the facts. From such statements I could not  guess who was the thief, and proceeded to examine the servants. The result was  unsatisfactory, and I tackled the gentry. Dreuxfield, his wife, and sister  could tell me nothing, and altogether the loss of that necklace was as deep a  mystery as ever I had to do with.</p>
  <p>It  rather added to my perplexity when I found that Major Onslow and his valet had  that morning gone to London. He had explained that he knew a man who would  elucidate any mystery better than a professional detective, and was going to  fetch him down. Then I inquired after the Curate, and Miss Kate produced a  hastily-scribbled note.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  went to town this morning,&rdquo; she explained, not without embarrassment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know on what business, Miss Dreuxfield?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  connected with a relative,&rdquo; said she, glancing at the note.</p>
  <p>I  must say the conduct of the Curate appeared suspicious. Dreuxfield very  unwillingly told me of the chloroform episode in the drawing-room. This did not  tend to exculpate Newall, so I examined the position of the smoking-room  relative to the strong-room. Both were on the ground-floor, and it was easy to  get from one to the other. I suppose my suspicions showed themselves in my  face, for Dreuxfield took me sharply to task.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know what you are thinking of,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;that Mr. Newall did not go to the  smoking-room, but when I returned for the jewels hid himself in the strong-room  passage. You are wrong. It is absolutely impossible that he should be the  thief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  his clothes were scented with chloroform, and by that drug you were rendered  senseless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  admitted Dreuxfield reluctantly, &ldquo;but that proves nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing!  Save that he must have had chloroform on him yesterday. Rather a curious drug  for a person to carry. Then he went to London this morning. That looks  suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose you&rsquo;ll say he took the necklace with him&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have known Newall for many years,&rdquo; said Dreuxfield earnestly, &ldquo;and I assure you  that he is incapable of such an act,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  sister, who had overheard our conversation, withered me with a glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Newall is a gentleman and a clergyman,&rdquo; she declared indignantly. &ldquo;I would as  soon think of suspecting my brother as him. To-morrow he returns, and he will  face the charge you have brought against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have brought no charge against him&mdash;yet,&rdquo; I answered, and so closed the  discussion.</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding  all my efforts I could discover nothing likely to lead to the arrest of the  thief. The servants all asserted their innocence, and supported one another  strongly after the fashion of their kind. In my own heart I suspected the  Curate, and waited with some impatience for his arrival. A personal interview  would simplify matters. Rather to the dismay of Kate Dreuxfield, he did not  return next day, thereby confirming my suspicions. The last train brought the  Major, full of stories about the Curate, none of which redounded to the young  man&rsquo;s credit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know why I went to town, Cecil?&rdquo; he asked Mr. Dreuxfield in my presence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  fetch some special detective of your own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was merely an excuse to keep Kate quiet. No! I followed Newall to town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the Curate, Major?&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; he answered triumphantly, &ldquo;that sneaking parson. I suspected he had  something to do with the robbery, and I am right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page346.jpg" width="906" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean to say Newall stole the necklace?&rdquo; asked Dreuxfield, looking very  pale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do! I have no positive proof, but strong suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  go for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, Mr. Dreuxfield,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;Let Major Onslow tell his story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  the robbery,&rdquo; said the ivory-leg gentleman, &ldquo;I thought the parson might have  had something to do with it, as I neither liked nor trusted him. If my  suspicions were correct, I fancied he would go to town next day, so at dawn I  sent out to learn his movements. Sure enough Newall was going to town by the  ten o&rsquo;clock train, so without saying anything I followed him. Strange to say,  he drove from Waterloo to my own lawyers. I waited till his interview was  finished, and then I saw my solicitor. He of course refused to reveal anything,  but he hinted sufficient for me to know that Newall intended to pay him a large  sum of money on that day. I then had no doubt that Newall had stolen the  necklace, and was about to raise money on it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interrupted Onslow, cutting short Dreuxfield&rsquo;s remark, &ldquo;you  believe in the fellow. I don&rsquo;t. I know, and you know, that he hasn&rsquo;t a  sixpence, and yet he traffics with lawyers over large sums of money. After that  discovery I left the office and hung about all day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  respectable employment,&rdquo; sneered Dreuxfield.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was in your interest,&rdquo; reproved the Major with dignity. &ldquo;In the afternoon I saw  this wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing coming back. While he was with the senior partner  a clerk left the office and took a hansom. I followed in another. He went to  the bank and presented a cheque for three thousand pounds. I saw the cheque, it  was signed by Newall. Now then,&rdquo; concluded Onslow triumphantly, &ldquo;where did  Newall get that money if not by pledging the necklace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dreuxfield  and I made no immediate comment. Things looked fishy for the Curate, and his  actions fitted in neatly with the suspicion that he was the thief. Meantime I  left Onslow to gloat over his perspicuity, and took Dreuxfield aside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I am about to say something rude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  away,&rdquo; he answered, looking rather pale, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be offended.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have examined all the servants, sir, and I am pretty certain that not one of  them is clever enough to have carried out this robbery. Suspicions point  towards Mr. Newall, yet for the moment let us give him the benefit of the doubt  and see who else could have stolen the jewels. Now if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Seeing  I hesitated, Dreuxfield anticipated my speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are thinking of Major Onslow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  yes! I hear a good deal of club gossip, and, to tell the honest truth, Major  Onslow does not bear a good character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know all that,&rdquo; said Dreuxfield bitterly; &ldquo;he is an old rogue who would sell  his soul&mdash;if he has one&mdash;to gratify his vices. Yet I don&rsquo;t think he is the thief.  He retired early to bed, and his valet took his ivory leg away. Without that  leg he could do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  his valet didn&rsquo;t take away his master&rsquo;s ivory leg?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you think the two of them are in it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say! Wait till I see the Curate. It seems to me that Major Onslow is  suspiciously active in getting evidence against him, At present I should like  to see the valet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo;  said Dreuxfield, returning to the old man, &ldquo;can we see Jenkins?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t come back with me,&rdquo; replied Onslow gruffly. &ldquo;I gave him permission to  see his relatives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  do you expect him back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a week! You don&rsquo;t think he stole the necklace, do you?&rdquo; finished the Major  defiantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said I, shirking the answer, &ldquo;but I have examined all the servants except your  man. It is only fair that he should have his turn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  here for a week and you&rsquo;ll see him,&rdquo; replied the Major ungraciously, &ldquo;or go to  my London club. He calls there every morning for my letters and sends them on.  I don&rsquo;t trust club servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I shan&rsquo;t trouble so much about him,&rdquo; I said, so our party of three broke up.</p>
  <p>It  was too late that evening to wire, but in the morning I sent a telegram to a  brother detective containing instructions to see Jenkins at the club. By noon I  received a reply, with which I went in search of the Major. On the way Miss  Dreuxfield stopped me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Newall is coming down this afternoon,&rdquo; she said, showing me a letter; &ldquo;he will  be here at four o&rsquo;clock. Then your suspicions will be explained away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so with all my heart. But I may mention, Miss Dreuxfield, that I brought  no specific charge against Mr. Newall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  spoke to the empty air, for by this time she was out of hearing. My hintings  had offended her mortally, but no one could have held the Curate guiltless in  the face of the evidence against him. Next I found the Major in the  drawing-room, and opened fire at once.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page356.jpg" width="626" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  servant is coming down by this afternoon&rsquo;s train, Major.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  sent for him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did! It is as well that I should hear what he has to say&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has nothing to say,&rdquo; growled the Major sulkily; &ldquo;he put me to bed and took my  ivory leg to his room. He wasn&rsquo;t near the strong-room, or even down-stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  assurance of that will be quite sufficient, so I am glad he is coming. Mr.  Newall is also on his way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope he won&rsquo;t have the face to show here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  he is coming down for the purpose. Miss Dreuxfield has advised him of your  accusations, and he desires to clear his character,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t be able to. I&rsquo;m certain he stole the necklace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had my own opinion about the robbery, and held my tongue. If the Major was  mixed up in the business with the valet, he had received due warning that  justice was on his track. Contrary to my expectations, he was by no means  startled. The man puzzled me.</p>
  <p>At  five o&rsquo;clock the train arrived, and with it Jenkins. My brother detective was  with him, and the three of us had a conversation. Then we went to Dreuxfield  Hall to see how Mr. Newall was getting on. He had come down by the same train,  and had at once gone off to look after his character. It was about time, seeing  the Major had done his best to spoil it.</p>
  <p>When  we arrived I left Jenkins and his escort outside in the entrance-hall, as I was  anxious to hear Newall&rsquo;s defence before producing the valet as a witness. All  the gentry concerned in the matter were assembled in the  drawing-room&mdash;Dreuxfield and his wife near the door opening on to the  conservatory, Onslow standing in the conservatory itself, Newall, with Kate  clinging to his arm, facing the three. He was quite pale, and looked savage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  absolutely deny the accusations of Major Onslow,&rdquo; he was saying when I entered;  &ldquo;no one knows less about the matter than I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  ahout the chloroform?&rdquo; sneered Onslow, &ldquo;and your hurried departure to town, and  the cheque for three thousand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  that I can explain except the chloroform. That is a mystery to me as to you. I  did spill some medicine in the afternoon, and I fancied that was the odour to  which Dreuxfield alluded. When he mentioned chloroform I was startled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo;  added Newall, gazing defiantly at the Major, &ldquo;I had that day received a letter  from my wretched cousin Clive saying he had embezzled some money, and  threatening to poison himself with chloroform unless I saved him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was why you turned so pale?&rdquo; said Kate breathlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  and that was why I went to town next day. It had nothing to do with the loss of  the diamonds. I drove to your lawyers and arranged to settle the matter by  paying the money. Fortunately, two months ago I inherited five thousand pounds,  on which I had hoped to have married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  shall marry,&rdquo; murmured Kate under her breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sold out some stock and got the money&mdash;paid it to my lawyer, who settled the  matter for my wretched cousin. I was arranging for his departure to the  colonies when I heard through Kate of Major Onslow&rsquo;s shameless accusations. I  came down here to refute them, and I have done so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to my mind,&rdquo; growled Onslow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think otherwise,&rdquo; said Dreuxfield, taking Newall by the hand. &ldquo;My dear fellow,  you are as innocent as I. Forgive me for having doubted you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Dreuxfield said words to the same effect, and Kate boldly kissed her lover  before them all. It was a pleasant sight save to the Major, who swore loudly.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page358.jpg" width="592" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  doesn&rsquo;t show who stole the necklace. If it wasn&rsquo;t Newall, who was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about yourself, Major?&rdquo; said I, coming forward. The four people turned round in  astonishment, and the Major, purple with rage, started forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, sir?&rdquo; he cried, with a few adjectives which I suppress. I went to  the door and led in the respectable Jenkins&mdash;handcuffed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean this, Major, that your valet is about the biggest thief in London. He has  been long wanted for several jobs, but he managed to evade the police. Thanks  to your information, he was captured at your club and brought down to give  evidence&mdash;against you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Against  me!&rdquo; said Onslow, growing grey. &ldquo;I swear I had nothing to do with the theft of  the necklace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a dead silence, and all waited for the next remark. It came from  Jenkins&mdash;from the respectable Jenkins, <i>alias</i> Cracky Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ladies  and gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, bowing collectively, &ldquo;I told the police I would give  evidence against the Major in order to be brought down here. But it is a lie.  My master is quite innocent, and,&rdquo; he added impudently, &ldquo;so am I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  won&rsquo;t save you, my man,&rdquo; said I sternly; &ldquo;your other pranks mean a lifer, so  you may as well confess your share in this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  the Major&rsquo;s innocent, at all events,&rdquo; said the rogue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, my man,&rdquo; muttered Onslow thickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&rdquo;&mdash;here he swayed to and fro,  then fell down in an apoplectic fit. There was a snap as he fell, and lo! a  marvel. The butt of the ivory leg had caught in an interstice of the  conservatory floor, and when he fell the leg smashed. Dreuxfield uttered a cry  of astonishment, and pointed to the ivory stump. From it fell a rain of  diamonds. The next-moment Newall and Dreuxfield were picking up the jewels, and  the women were loosening the neckcloth of the old man. I gripped Jenkins by the  arm and indicated the scattered jewels.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page360.jpg" width="535" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  lied! He is guilty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it,&rdquo; said the scamp coolly; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you run your head against a stone,  sir. Major Onslow hasn&rsquo;t been a bad master as masters go, and I&rsquo;m not going to  get him into trouble. He is quite innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how did the diamonds get into the ivory leg?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  put them there. It was this way. I wanted to steal those diamonds, and by means  of a forged character I entered the Major&rsquo;s service. Then I watched for a  chance to steal the jewels. I thought there would be no opportunity of getting  out of the house during the first alarm if they were stolen, so I looked about  for some safe place in which to hide them till I could take them to London at  my leisure. As I cleaned the Major&rsquo;s ivory leg every night, it gave me an idea.  I bored a hole half-way down the leg and dropped the diamonds in one by one.  They just filled the hollow nicely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you steal them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard Miss Dreuxfield say at breakfast that the master was going to show them  to Mr. Newall, so I watched. All my plans were made, and I waited by the  strong-room door with a chloroformed handkerchief. When he came along I used  it, and stole the jewels. In my own room I separated them one from the other,  and dropped them into the hollow of the ivory leg. Then I plugged up the end  with cotton wool and a round of ivory. The alarm was given, the Major called  for his leg, and I took it to him. He went down to the hall with the diamonds  safe in his ivory leg.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page362.jpg" width="637" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  cried Newall at this moment, &ldquo;you helped me off with my coat. Now I understand  the smell of chloroform.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sprinkled you with a little,&rdquo; replied Jenkins. &ldquo;You see, parson, I wanted to  get suspicion to fall on you. But for the smashing of the leg I wouldn&rsquo;t tell  all this. But I&rsquo;ve lost the diamonds and my liberty, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Major had by this time revived somewhat, and sat up to swear at his quondam  servant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  villain!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;oh, you villain!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this,&rdquo; said Jenkins, as we marched him out, &ldquo;this is gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jenkins  received the reward of his ingenuity, and passed the rest of his life in gaol  for this and other offences. He always regretted not having pulled off the  Dreuxfield fetich. The Major took himself away from Malvern, and declined to  have further dealings with the Dreuxfields. They were by no means sorry, and,  indeed, had no time to be, for shortly afterwards Kate Dreuxfield married  Newall, to the delight of all. I can imagine the Major&rsquo;s language when he heard  of the marriage. He wears a wooden leg now.</p>
  <p>The  twenty-four diamonds were at the last Drawing-room on the neck of their owner.  I have no doubt that, sooner or later, another attempt will be made to steal  them, but it is questionable whether any thief will be as ingenious as Cracky  Bill, alias Jenkins. But then, it isn&rsquo;t every valet and thief who chances on a  master with an ivory leg.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="cousin"></a>My Cousin  From France</b><br>
  <b>Chapter I</b></h2>
  <p>IT  has been stated&mdash;I know not on whose authority&mdash;that every one is more or less  mad in one special direction. When such particular insanity takes a form likely  to be injurious to individual existence, or to the well-being of the community  at large, the person so afflicted is forthwith placed under restraint in the  interests of law and order. Nevertheless, if a man be but reasonably unreasonable  (and the contiguity of these words is not so incongruous as may appear) he is  permitted to be at large, and to indulge in such freaks as please him. Among  such harmless weaknesses may be classed stamp-acquiring, picture-buying,  first-edition-hunting, china-gathering, and gem-collecting.</p>
  <p>Since  many men have many minds, and many minds have many predilections, the list can  be indefinitely prolonged; but as the tag-end of the above catalogue reveals my  crotchet there is no necessity to multiply examples. To confess my hobby is  requisite, as it begins and continues and ends this story. I am a  gem-collector.</p>
  <p>Women  are enthusiasts in collecting jewels for the adornment of their beauty; but my  weakness does not consent to such vanity. I wear neither ring, nor stud, nor  breastpin, nor jewelled sleeve-link.</p>
  <p>It  is true that, for the gratification of my whim, I purchase precious stones,  but, instead of glittering on my person, they repose on white cotton wool in  glass-covered trays. To each gem is appended a ticket inscribed with its  history and value, but this information is for the enlightenment of strangers.  I know my collection so well that, if needs be, I can, in the dark, lay my hand  on any particular stone. I experiment occasionally with my wits in this way.</p>
  <p>The  possession of these valuables inspired me with a wholesome dread of burglars.  My mother and I dwelt in a lonely house some distance from Lewes, and, mindful  of our isolation, we took every precaution for the preservation of the  collection. We had spring guns, electric alarms, patent locks, and various  other contrivances for the baffling of the thieving fraternity. I kept the key  of the strong-room on my watch-chain, and never slept without a revolver under  my pillow. Our house was defended and sentinelled like a fortress, but, as it  proved in the end, all to no purpose. I possess no collection of jewels now.</p>
  <p>After  such preamble I may as well confess that I am a bachelor. My father died while  I was forming the nucleus of the collection, and when I came of age my mother  urged me to marry. Being then bent solely on filling my treasury, I had no time  to affect the society of the other sex, and I refused to commit myself rashly  to matrimony; and, although my mother, disapproving of celibacy, talked matrimony  to me for quite ten years, I still held to my freedom. If she was obstinate, I  was more so, and at thirty-five years of age I was still single. Candour  compels me to confess that selfishness was at the bottom of such persistent  refusal.</p>
  <p>Often  did I point out to my mother the difficulty of obtaining a partner who would  fall in with our views. I might marry a woman who did not care for collecting  gems, or who might insist upon wearing those I possessed. She might even grudge  the expenditure of further money in adding to the hoard. To these objections my  mother turned a deaf ear, and still reiterated her request. Her pertinacity was  praiseworthy but wearisome. Twenty years of the cuckoo-cry &ldquo;Marry, marry, marry&rdquo;  is calculated to irritate the most good-natured of men. It was the sole point  on which we disagreed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is my niece, Oswald,&rdquo; said my mother one morning, hot on her favourite topic. &ldquo;Your  cousin, Mathilde Barbot&mdash;you know all about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me see,&rdquo; said I, polishing a newly-acquired cameo. &ldquo;Do I know all about her,  mother? H&rsquo;m, your sister, my aunt, married M. Barbot, who is a merchant at  Cairo. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who <i>was</i> a merchant at Cairo,&rdquo; corrected  my mother. &ldquo;You forget, Oswald, he died six months ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  he did, and sorry was I to hear it. He sent me that large turquoise yonder, and  very cheap it was. Well, mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is an orphan, Oswald.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that, mother. And a very rich orphan, too, as I have heard you say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is certainly well off. But money does not make up for love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  they say. Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  indifferent you are, Oswald. I wish you to particularly note what I say.  Mathilde, finding herself lonely in Cairo, has written to ask if she can come  to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  come here! To this house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why not, Oswald? She is your cousin and my niece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t deny the relationship, mother. But reflect. We have never seen her. She  may be an undesirable addition to our household. You are happy, mother, in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be still happier when you are married to a woman of whom I approve,  Oswald.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ho,  ho,&rdquo; I chuckled, now seeing her aim. &ldquo;And you approve of your niece as a  possible Mrs. Danefield?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think she will make you a good wife, Oswald. You need not laugh. For all you  know, she may he an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True;  and for all <i>you</i> know, she may be the  reverse. I should like to have some idea of what she is like. Why does not she  send her portrait?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did, but it was lost on the way. You know how careless those foreign officials  are. But we shall soon be able to judge of her for ourselves. She is at  Marseilles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed.  I understood you to say she was at Cairo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not been listening, Oswald,&rdquo; said my mother reprovingly. &ldquo;I mentioned some  time ago that she had left Cairo for Marseilles. Thence she goes to Paris to  stay a few days with her school-friend, Madame Charette. I am to write to her  at that address. Now, what am I to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  her to come, by all means. If she takes after your family, mother, she is sure  to be delightful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Foolish,  foolish boy,&rdquo; said my mother, beaming at the compliment; &ldquo;but to tell you the  truth, Oswald, I do not know whom she takes after. M. Barbot and I did not get  on well, and, influenced by her husband, my sister corresponded but rarely with  me. After her death M. Barbot was not very friendly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  sent me the turquoise, however. But how much do you know of Mathilde?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  that she was educated at the <i>Pension des  Anglais</i>, and is a quiet little creature. Thanks to her mother, she writes  and speaks English pretty well. This letter is admirably written for a  foreigner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  old is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five,  I believe. Ten years younger than you, Oswald. I always think,&rdquo; added my mother  artfully, &ldquo;that a wife should be ten years younger than her husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  mother, mother. You are driving me to the altar. I trust I shall like Cousin Mathilde,  but I cannot promise to fall in love with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oswald,&rdquo;  hinted my mother impressively, &ldquo;she is fond of gems.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  women are, for that matter, mother. I dare say she&rsquo;ll ask leave to wear the  cream of my collection before she&rsquo;s been a week in the house. Does she know  about my treasures?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course she does. Did not her father send you that turquoise? He doubtless told  Mathilde, for she used to write to me from school asking after her English  cousin and his jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  kind of her, mother. No doubt she thinks I own a gem-encrusted Aladdin&rsquo;s cave.  Do you wish me to cross over to Paris and escort her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  M. Charette is probably coming to London on business; so you can meet her at  Newhaven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. Ask her to send a portrait, so that I may be able to distinguish her in  the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  no portrait arrived. Probably it was never asked for, as my mother&rsquo;s memory is  not what it used to be. However, she duly wrote and invited Cousin Mathilde to  make her home with us. In due time a letter arrived, stating that the young  lady was staying in Paris with her friends, the Charettes, and would come over  to England, vi&ecirc; Dieppe, under the protection of the husband. A postscript  stated that she was anxious to salute her cousin Oswald, and to view his  collection. From this I argued an artful nature.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  it is hardly fair to say this, as her letters, written in fair English,  conveyed to my mind a timid, homely personality of no great beauty and much  common-sense. I talked so much about our French relative to my mother that she  assumed quite a concrete form in my mind. Small, delicately made, with gentle  ways and a low voice to match her downcast eyes&mdash;this was the imaginary portrait  I had drawn, and which had created an impression upon me. I actually considered  the possibility of a marriage in the near future, and pictured this trustful  creature winning her way into our hearts and creeping about the house like a  bright-eyed mouse. Strange to say, now that there was a probability of her  wishes being gratified, my mother warned me against being too sanguine. She  swung round like a weather-cock, and hinted at disappointment the very morning  I left to meet Mathilde at Newhaven.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust she will prove as delightful as you think, Oswald,&rdquo; said my inconsistent  parent; &ldquo;but we must not hope for too much. Remember we have never seen, her,  and she may be quite the reverse of what we expect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what I remarked a fortnight ago, mother. You then answered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  go, Oswald, or you will be late. I shall expect you home to dinner with  Mathilde.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  did my mother evade being worsted. Before I could further denounce her change  of front, she had me out of the house, and I drove off to Lewes greatly amused  at her inconsistency.</p>
  <p>Her  main objection was based on our ignorance of Mathilde&rsquo;s looks, nature, and  behaviour. I was extremely curious to see this bone of contention&mdash;if one dared  speak so disrespectfully of a young lady&mdash;and as the Dieppe packet swung into  its berth, I carefully examined the passengers&rsquo; faces.</p>
  <p>Not  a glimpse could I catch of the homely personality I expected to see, and I  began to think that Mathilde had not come. Indeed, convinced of her  non-arrival, I was about to repair to the telegraph office, when a tall young  lady, accompanied by a gentleman, planted herself before me, and held out her  hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  cousin?&rdquo; she exclaimed in French, then, noting my bewilderment, she added: &ldquo;Are  you not M. Danefield?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I am Oswald Danefield, and you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am Mathilde Barbot, your cousin. I recognized you by the portrait sent by your  good mother. Ah! it is good of you to welcome me. But I have been well guarded  since leaving Paris. Permit me&mdash;my cousin, M. Charette, the husband of my dear  friend Ad&egrave;le.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  smart-looking Frenchman grinned and bowed, and took off his hat with a  flourish. Although rather amazed by the difference between the real and the  ideal Mathilde, I was sufficiently self-controlled to return his greeting.  After a short conversation about the fatigues of travelling and the  embarrassment of luggage, we boarded the express. At Lewes M. Charette took a  polite farewell of me, an effusive one of Mathilde, and then proceeded on his  way to London. The carriage was waiting for us at the station, and having seen  to Mathilde&rsquo;s trunk, we drove home. On the steps my mother awaited our arrival.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am delighted to see you, my dear,&rdquo; said she to Mathilde.</p>
  <p>Our  guest looked puzzled for a moment, then replied in the most execrable English, &ldquo;I  haf no Inglis&mdash;I speak it bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Remembering  how my mother had boasted of Mathilde&rsquo;s linguistic acquirements I thought this  extremely strange.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Chapter II</b></h2>
  <p>I HAVE  not yet mentioned that my cousin was a beautiful woman. Such omission must be  set down to the bewilderment caused by my finding Mathilde so different from  what I had expected her to be. When our intercourse became more familiar, I had  time to examine her looks, to watch her behaviour; and by noting both, I strove  to arrive at a conclusion as to her character. All this took some weeks, and  over a month elapsed before I learned to accept her as a member of our circle.</p>
  <p>That  I am of a retiring disposition I put down to the quietness of my daily life,  the lack of feminine society, and to my absorption in my hobby. He who is  habituated to a placid existence is apt to feel nervous in the society of one  acquainted with the great world. I know not where Mathilde, whose existence had  been passed between school and Cairo, learned her airs and graces and aplomb,  but she was certainly better instructed in life than either my mother or  myself. We were both a trifle afraid of this stately woman, and noting this,  she did her best to remove the impression. No daughter could have been more  devoted to my mother; no sister could have been kinder to me.</p>
  <p>Yet  my mother&mdash;lenient as were her judgments&mdash;confessed to a certain distrust of  Mathilde. Despite the kindly disposition of the one and the deference of the  other, they did not get on well together.</p>
  <p>Probably  the absence of sympathy on the part of Mathilde had something to do with this,  but whatever it was, the result was decidedly unsatisfactory. The elder woman  actually went the length of lamenting the lack of confidence between them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know how it is, Oswald,&rdquo; she said, after an unusually trying day with  Mathilde, &ldquo;but I cannot get on with her. She might be a stranger instead of my  sister&rsquo;s child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Difference  of nationality, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she is half English. Yet there is not a drop of her poor dear mother&rsquo;s blood in  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Takes  after M. Barbot, no doubt, mother; I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m altogether pleased with her  myself. But you must make some allowance. Lewes after Cairo is rather a change.  It is our duty to make her comfortable&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  I&rsquo;m sure we do,&rdquo; said my mother in parenthesis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;and  to love her as much as possible. That is,&rdquo; I added hastily, for my mother  looked oddly at me, &ldquo;to love her as a relation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you don&rsquo;t love her in any other way, Oswald.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t; yet three months ago you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Times  are changed, Oswald. I would not like Mathilde as a daughter-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  certainly I would not care for her as my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  mother, finding the conversation unsatisfactory, went off to harry the  servants, who were never up to her standard of excellence. I retired to the  strong-room, busied myself with my jewels, and wondered if I could be brought  to love Mathilde. She was beautiful and graceful, no doubt, but there was  something feline about her that frequently inspired me with a distaste for her  mere presence, I fancy the dislike was mutual. In unguarded moments a glance  oftentimes revealed the feeling she so carefully kept hidden. Love, indeed!  There was but little chance of that between two who were the antithesis of one  another.</p>
  <p>While  I was thus musing, Mathilde made her appearance, and with characteristic  cunning, she saluted me with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, my cousin, but you promised to show me the new jewel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  spoke in French, as was her custom. Often did we ask her to speak English; but  she always excused herself on the plea of an imperfect acquaintance with the  language. The early death of her mother and the habit of M. Barbot to converse  in French with his daughter, doubtless accounted for her deficiency in this  respect. Yet for one who wrote such excellent English letters, I thought it  strange.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in, Mathilde,&rdquo; said I, picking up a gem. &ldquo;Here is the chrysoprase. Very fine,  is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but it is charming,&rdquo; she exclaimed, clasping her hands; &ldquo;and so rare a stone. I  never saw one before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  chrysoprase is little known. But you will find it mentioned in the Book of Revelation&mdash;I  forgot&mdash;you are a Catholic, Mathilde, and, no doubt, prefer breviary to Bible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you care for either, my cousin?&rdquo; said she, rather wickedly, whereat I affected  to examine the beauties of the gem. She had nothing to do with my religious  convictions. But, after a few minutes spent in looking at the collection, she  picked up the thread of conversation where it had dropped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I do not read my Bible,&rdquo; said she, looking round the room, &ldquo;I, at least, know  something of the &lsquo;Thousand and One Nights.&rsquo; Oh, yes. I have read the  translation of M. Galland. There is a story called &lsquo;The Wonderful Lamp,&rsquo; my  cousin. You have this lamp, no doubt, to possess such wonderful treasures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,  I have no attendant genie, Mathilde. All these jewels are bought and paid for,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is money here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  ten thousand pounds, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said she, drawing a long breath, &ldquo;and in francs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  hundred and fifty thousand francs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  cousin, you are a Monte Cristo! I wonder you are not afraid of thieves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> afraid of thieves, my cousin, and I  take every precaution against them. The walls and roof and door of this room  are of sheet-iron. As you see, the window is strongly barred; and I carry the  sole key which gives admittance on my watch-chain. No burglar could enter here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  thieves are so clever,&rdquo; she said wisely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you take the jewels, Mathilde,&rdquo; said I jokingly, &ldquo;and relieve me of the  responsibility?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not tempt me. Had I those jewels, I should wear them, and not waste their  beauty in this cell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear you have not the soul of a gem-collector, Mathilde.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  goes without saying, my cousin. I am a woman.&rdquo; And she was truly a woman in her  vanity and love of display. Yet, despite these defects, many would have yielded  to the influence of those dark eyes and to the invitation of those smiling  lips. But I was as ice under the fire of her glances. Perhaps my faculty of  love had died from sheer inanition; or, perhaps, the feeling of antipathy  neutralized it; but I certainly did not care for Mathilde. My mother was pleased  at my attitude, for she liked Mathilde as little as I did. There was a reason  for this, but we did not find it out till long afterwards. Then it was too  late.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Chapter III</b></h2>
  <p>TWO  months of this life proved unsatisfactory. It jarred. I cannot honestly blame  Mathilde, for she tried her best to be agreeable, but her efforts proved  futile. Our domestic machine, that used to run smoothly as on oiled wheels, was  now out of gear and jolted horribly. I felt it, my mother felt it, and I think  Mathilde felt it also, though she said nothing about it. Her transplantation  experiment was a distinct failure. She recognized that. The best thing she  could do was to leave us to relapse into our old ways, and go back to her alien  life. In the end that is what she did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  good aunt,&rdquo; she said, in the unemotional voice which was her greatest defect. &ldquo;You  are very good to me, and my cousin also is most amiable. But I must go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope there is nothing wrong, Mathilde,&rdquo; faltered my mother, feeling guilty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  that you or I can change, dear one. It is that my ways are not your ways. I am  of a different nature. I have been trained in a different fashion. Every moment  I do things which are not according to your English ideas. Your life is quiet  and charming and full of sweetness, but it is not my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  find it dull?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  dull; I find it impossible. See you, my aunt? I cannot explain. Perhaps my  cousin can?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid not, Mathilde.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know, I know,&rdquo; she said, nodding her head. &ldquo;It is hard to explain, but easy  to feel. I thank you both for your kindness, but next week I will return to  Adele Charette, at Paris. What say you, my aunt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not wish you to stay if you would rather go, my love; but if you think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it is settled,&rdquo; said Mathilde, in what I thought was a tone of relief. &ldquo;I shall  write for M. Charette to come over for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  offered to save M. Charette the trouble&mdash;it was the least I could do&mdash;but my  services were declined by Mathilde. She wrote to Paris, and in due time  received an answer that M. Charette was coming over on business, and he would  call at Lewes on his way back to escort her, as requested.</p>
  <p>When  the evening of her departure was settled&mdash;for she elected to go by the night  mail to convenience M. Charette&mdash;my mother became quite tearful. In the  tenderness of her heart she blamed herself for the girl&rsquo;s decision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  indeed, it is not my fault, Oswald. I have done my best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear mother, you are hospitality itself. For my part, I am pleased she is  going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  quiet life does not suit her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evidently  not. She prefers the society of Madame Charette and the gay city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>During  that week we were constant in our attentions to Mathilde, and, recognizing our  efforts to please her, she made herself extraordinarily agreeable. But the  result was a failure, and the old distrust still continued. We all three felt  that we were acting a comedy, and would be glad when it was over. The curtain  fell on a Wednesday, and on a situation that was as unexpected as it was  disagreeable.</p>
  <p>M.  Charette arrived shortly before dinner, and was made welcome. I cannot say that  I liked him. He was a slender man of the Negroid type, which offended my racial  prejudices. It was no news to me to learn that he came from Martinique. Frizzly  hair, opal-tinted nails, and thick lips betrayed his African blood. However, we  overcame our distaste for his society, and made his three hours&rsquo; stay as  pleasant as possible. All was prepared for the departure of my cousin. Her  large black trunk had been brought down-stairs, and deposited near the  strong-room. I ordered the brougham to be at the door at half-past nine, to  take them to Lewes, as they were to catch the ten-seventeen express for  Newhaven. These arrangements having been made, we sat down to dinner.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page378.jpg" width="900" height="633"></p>
  <p>Long  before the meal was over my mother was forced to seek her room. She complained  of feeling ill, and, with many excuses, retired to lie down. I was thus left to  entertain our guests, and cannot say I found much difficulty in doing so. The  two were capital company. Mathilde threw off her reserve in the presence of a  compatriot, and was quite brilliant in talk and speech. Being of an observant  nature, I noted the glances she exchanged with Charette, and began to pity the  absent wife.</p>
  <p>I  had a vague idea that all was not right&mdash;that Mathilde had not read her native  novelists for nothing; and that the Frenchman with the bold eyes and sniggering  laugh was a consummate scoundrel. I was glad my mother had left the table; I  was glad Mathilde was going; and I caught myself saying something about mixed  races and double faces.</p>
  <p>Dinner  over, Mathilde went to take leave of my mother, and we two men retired to the  smoking-room. Frankly speaking, I should have preferred that my cousin came  with us, as her conduct had so revolted me that I felt her mere presence to be  an insult to my mother. We had entertained the opposite of an angel unawares,  and I was glad she was going away.</p>
  <p>During  her absence Charette talked of himself, and in a hundred little ways betrayed  his low moral tone. I allow considerable latitude to some men in consideration  of their upbringing and natural instincts, but I object to rake their minds for  concentrated vice. My guest was an iniquitous scoundrel, and respectable as was  the room and employment, I felt as though I were assisting at some low orgy.  Some men have the faculty of poisoning the air by looks and words.</p>
  <p>I  was relieved when Mathilde made her appearance with the coffee, as it put an  end to the conversation of Charette. My cousin handed me a cup with her own  hands, mentioning that it was the last service she would be able to do me. Then  she accepted a cigarette from the Frenchman. I do not approve of women smoking,  but her doing so seemed in keeping with the tainted atmosphere of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have bidden my aunt adieu,&rdquo; said Mathilde, &ldquo;and all is ready to go. But we have  yet an hour. Could you not show M, Charette your jewels, my cousin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to-night; it is too dark to see them properly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was untrue, as the strong-room was lighted by electricity; but I could not  bring myself to show such a mark of friendship to Charette. He seemed the kind  of man who would knock one on the head, if he had the chance, and go off with  the whole collection. Of course, such an idea is absurd, and I merely mention  it as a proof of the disagreeable way in which Charette affected me. The scowl  with which he greeted my refusal strongly accentuated his Negroid traits, but  he possessed sufficient tact to pass the matter over lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  some other occasion, Monsieur may favour me,&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p>
  <p>I  was resolved that such other occasion should never arrive. The way in which  Charette and Mathilde looked at one another made me again pity the wife in  Paris. But at this moment I began to grow drowsy. Instead of tending to  wakefulness, the coffee induced me to sleep. It was most remarkable. I  struggled vainly against the lethargic feeling; but my head fell on my breast  and my eyes closed. The last thing I remember was Charette and Mathilde  whispering eagerly together. The next moment I was sound asleep. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Chapter IV</b></h2>
  <p>I AWOKE  next morning to find myself seated before the fireless grate. Bewildered by the  novelty of the situation, it was some time before I could collect my thoughts  sufficiently to account for my position. It was entirely opposed to my usual habits.  With some misgivings, I recollected the strange behaviour of Mathilde, and rang  the bell.</p>
  <p>When  the butler appeared he looked astonished at seeing me still in evening dress,  and even more so when I questioned him on the events which had taken place the  previous night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must have fallen to sleep in my chair, Bates. Why did you not wake me before  going to bed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beg  pardon, sir, but Mademoiselle Barbot told me not to disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Mademoiselle gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. She went with the French gentleman to catch the ten-seventeen express. I  hope, sir, that nothing is wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Bates; nothing is wrong. That will do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  went up to my bedroom, took a cold bath, and dressed myself for the day. All  the time my thoughts were busy with the unaccountable fact that I had slept in  the smoking-room. It seemed strange that Mathilde should be so solicitous for  my comfort. However, I had no reason to think anything was wrong; so,  dismissing the subject, I paid my usual morning visit to my mother, whom I  found much better. Afterwards I repaired to the strong-room. As usual, I opened  the door with the key attached to my watch-chain. Then I received a shock. The  cases were shattered; the jewels were gone; the place was as bare as the palm  of my hand. It was quite five minutes before I could force my brain to work, my  will to act. The loss of ten thousand pounds is apt to disarrange one&rsquo;s  faculties.</p>
  <p>Mathilde!  Charette! I kept repeating these names in a stupefied fashion, as though I  expected their owners to appear and restore the stolen jewels. Stolen?  Certainly. But by my cousin and her friend? Impossible! The mere idea was  terrible; yet she might have been coerced by Charette. With a brain as clear as  crystal&mdash;after the fashion of brains at such moments&mdash;I rapidly constructed a  theory to account for existent facts. Here it is:&mdash;</p>
  <p>Charette  had designed the theft, and had carried out the plans with the assistance of  Mathilde. She had drugged my coffee, and, while I slept, had stolen the key of  the strong-room from my watch-chain. The rest was easy. They had packed the  jewels in Mathilde&rsquo;s trunk, closed the strong-room door, replaced the key, and  had made off with their plunder. By this time they were in Paris.</p>
  <p>I  made no outcry, for as one of the culprits was my cousin, I deemed it advisable  to keep the matter quiet, at all events for the present. Locking the now empty  strong-room, I interrogated the butler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what time did Mademoiselle Barbot leave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  half-past nine, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly  one hour to clear the place,&rdquo; I thought, remembering Mathilde&rsquo;s remark; then  added aloud, &ldquo;Mademoiselle took her trunk with her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. It was placed on the brougham, according to your orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  was the irony of the thing. By my orders the means had been provided for their  flight. I have no doubt that the trunk was filled with my collection, but it  was useless to ask further questions; I made up my mind to a course and acted.  Ordering a portmanteau to be packed, I repaired to my mother&rsquo;s room. She was on  the point of descending to the breakfast-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you better this morning, mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much  better, thank you, Oswald; but I have a slight headache still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  have I. We have both been drugged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oswald!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true, mother. Your wine and my coffee were drugged, and while we were  asleep, Mathilde and her precious friend, Charette, have carried off all my  jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mathilde  rob you! Are you mad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  I. Come down to the strong-room, if you don&rsquo;t believe me, mother. It is quite  empty; she stole the key from my watch-chain, put the jewels in her trunk, and  drove off with it to the station in our brougham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  own niece! Oswald, what is to be done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to Paris this morning, and will call at the Charettes&rsquo;. I do not  suppose I shall find Monsieur at home but I shall put the police&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police, Oswald! Your cousin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do what I can to save her, mother, but I cannot afford to lose ten thousand  pounds without making an effort to regain it. Hush, mother; do not cry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  own niece, Oswald!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are well rid of her, mother. I think myself she is a bad lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  pass over my mother&rsquo;s lamentations and the futile theories she put forward to  prove the innocence of Mathilde. By noon I was on my way to Paris with Mathilde&rsquo;s  letter, written from the Charettes&rsquo; address to accept our invitation. She  little thought when she penned that letter that it would some day prove a trap  to catch her. By such trifles do we weave nets for our own snaring.</p>
  <p>There  is no need to describe the journey. I duly arrived at my destination, left my  portmanteau at the nearest hotel, and then, notwithstanding the lateness of the  hour, drove at once to the Charettes&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>There  I received a shock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both  Monsieur and Madame Charette were away,&rdquo; explained the concierge. &ldquo;They had  been gone some days, but the mad Mademoiselle Barbot was still within.&rdquo; This  information pleased me. I should at least be able to reproach Mathilde with her  wickedness. But why did the concierge call her mad? The epithet was  inapplicable to so ingenious a schemer.</p>
  <p>However,  I wasted no time in vain inquiries, but mounted the stairs and rang at the door  of the Charettes&rsquo;. A pretty little maid, who looked as though she had been  crying, made her appearance. I saw at a glance that she was no servant, and  shaped my speech accordingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, but is Mademoiselle Barbot within?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am Mademoiselle Barbot, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  announcement took away my breath. I looked at her in astonishment, and in that  brief glance felt satisfied that she had spoken the truth. There was a far-off  resemblance to my mother in her face, and in all respects she was the  bright-eyed little mouse of whom I had dreamed. But if this were the real  Mathilde, who was the false one? I lost no time in learning that fact.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am Oswald Danefield.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  cousin?&rdquo; she cried in English, which, by the way, she spoke excellently well. &ldquo;Oh,  how thankful I am to see you! Come in, Oswald; I have so much to tell you.&rdquo; She  led me into an untidy room, and, giving me a chair, sat down near me. Then, for  the first time, I saw that she looked ill and worn. The remark of the concierge  occurred to my mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do they call you mad, Mathilde?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  why, indeed, Oswald?&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;I am not mad. I came here to stay with  Ad&egrave;le Charette and her husband; but when I wanted to leave, on receiving your  dear mother&rsquo;s letter, they said I was mad and shut me up in a little room. I  have been there for two months, watched by old Madame Charette. Not once did I  see Ad&egrave;e or her husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  you not have escaped?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Oswald. The old woman kept the door locked, and, when I cried out, she told the  tenants I was mad and was shortly to be removed to an asylum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is the old woman now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. She went away this morning. I found the door of my room open and  came out. To-night I was going to write to you, but now there is no need. Oh,  Oswald, how I have suffered! What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  means robbery, Mathilde. Was Ad&egrave;le a tall, dark, handsome woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  She was my friend at school, and I loved her so. To think she should be so  cruel! But you talk of robbery, Oswald?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. You spoke of my jewels to your friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Was it wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  wrong, as it turns out,&rdquo; said I grimly. &ldquo;Ad&egrave;le Charette impersonated you, and  has been staying with us for the last two months. Last night her husband joined  her. They drugged me and went off with ten thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how could she impersonate me?&rdquo; cried Mathilde, astonished at this recital. &ldquo;She  knew no English.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  she accounted for that in a very ingenious way. Besides, we had never seen you,  nor had we your portrait. There was no reason to think that Ad&egrave;le was not the  real Mathilde.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  how wicked. But M. Charette was a terrible man, and made Ad&egrave;le as evil as  himself. She was not so at school.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust not, for the credit of the school. But now I know that you are not the  thief, I shall set the police on the track of the three Charettes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,  a thief?&rdquo; said Mathilde indignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Under  the name of Ad&egrave;le Charette only. I thought it was my cousin who stole the  jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is terrible. And now, Oswald&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I shall take you back to England, my dear. It was a pity you spoke about the  jewels, else they might never have conceived and carried out their clever plot.  No wonder my mother and I did not like Ad&egrave;le. However, we may yet catch and  punish them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brave  talk, indeed: but we never did catch them. The three baffled the French police,  escaped to Spain, and thence sailed for South America. In those lawless lands  south of the Line they were safe from pursuit, and now, I have no doubt, they  are living on the proceeds of their nefarious scheme. It was cleverly conceived  and cleverly carried out. They learned all necessary details from the  unsuspecting Mathilde, and framed their plans accordingly. I now understood the  glances which passed between my so-called cousin from France and M. Charette.  Also how we had failed to love her. She was as evil as was her husband. They  were a well-matched pair, and no doubt the mother (whom I learned was a  quadroon from Martinique) was as bad as either. However, it was no use lamenting;  the game was played out, and I had lost my collection.</p>
  <p>I  have never had the heart to begin another. The risk is too great. I took my  real cousin back to Lewes, and she became a member of our household. Great was  the indignation of my mother when she learned how we had been deceived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  wonder I could not love her, Oswald. It was instinct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700231h-images/page386.jpg" width="899" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  found no difficulty in loving the second Mathilde Barbot. In fact, out of evil  came good. Deprived of my collection, I turned my thoughts to matrimony, and,  much to my mother&rsquo;s delight, I married Mathilde. She became my hobby, and I  have no fear of her being stolen. However, as I miss my jewels and I am unable  to form another collection, I propose to devote myself to stamps. There is just  as much interest and less risk.</p>
