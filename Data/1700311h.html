    A Foggy Night</b></h2>
  <p>AT  two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, during the month of August, sounds of music could  be heard proceeding from a brilliantly lighted house in Park Lane, where a ball  was being given by the Countess of Kerstoke. True, the season was long since  over, and though the greater part of London society had migrated, swallow-like,  to the south of Europe in search of warm weather, still there were enough  people in town to justify the ball being given, and a number of celebrities  were present.</p>
  <p>Outside  it was dull and chill, with a thick yellow fog pervading the atmosphere, but  within the great ball-room it was like fairyland with the brilliant light of  the lamps, the profusion of bright flowers, and the gay dresses worn by the  ladies. The orchestra, hidden behind a gorgeous screen of tropical plants, was  playing the latest waltz, &ldquo;A Friend of Mine,&rdquo; and the sigh and sob of the  melody as it stole softly through the room seemed to inspire the dancers with a  voluptuous languor as they glided over the polished floor. The soft frou-frou  of women&rsquo;s dresses mingled with the light laughter of young-girls and the  whispered confidences of their partners, while over all dominated the haunting  melody with its weird modulations and suggestions of sensuous passion.</p>
  <p>Near  the door of the ball-room a young man of about thirty years of age was leaning  against the wall in a lazy attitude, idly watching the dancers swinging past  him; but judging from the preoccupied expression of his face his thoughts were  evidently far away. He was tall, dark-haired, with a short-cut well-trimmed  beard, piercing dark eyes, a firmly compressed mouth, and judging from his  swarthy complexion, together with a certain crisp curl in his hair, he  evidently had some negro blood in his veins. Suddenly he was roused from his  meditations by a touch on his shoulder, and on glancing up saw before him a  stout elderly gentleman with white hair, a ruddy face, and rather a Silenus  cast of countenance.</p>
  <p>The  one was Spencer Ellersby, only son of a wealthy West Indian planter, and the  other Horace Marton, a well-known society man generally called The Town-crier,  from the fact that he knew all the current scandals and retailed them with  elaborate embellishments to his numerous circle of friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey!  Ellersby, my boy,&rdquo; said The Town-crier, on the alert to acquire fresh  information, &ldquo;have you come back once more to England, home and beauty,  hey?&mdash;been all over the world I suppose, hey?&mdash;going to publish a book of  travels&mdash;hey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  I,&rdquo; replied Ellersby in the slow, languid manner habitual to him, &ldquo;every one  who goes half a dozen miles nowadays publishes a book of travels under some  fantastic title. I prefer to be renowned for not having done so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Broke  no new ground&mdash;hey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  indifferently. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the instincts of Columbus, so the old ground was good  enough for me. I&rsquo;ve done Africa in a superficial manner, called on our American  cousins, passed the same compliment to our Australian ditto, in fact, done the  usual thing with the usual result.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey!  what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  sense of being bored&mdash;I agree with Voltaire to a certain extent, &lsquo;this is the  best of all possible worlds,&rsquo; but one does get a little tired of it&mdash;however, I  have satisfied your curiosity, now return the compliment. I&rsquo;ve been away from  England for two years so know nothing of life in town. Come, unfold&mdash;tell me  all&mdash;scandals, deaths, marriages, divorces, in fact all the gossip of the hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was an occupation after The Town-crier&rsquo;s own heart, so he launched out into a  long description of folly and fashion varied by sermons and scandal, which  being spiced with a little maliciousness, proved quite an amusing discourse.  Ellersby listened in silence with a quiet smile on his lips, every now and then  giving vent to an ejaculation as he heard some special morsel of news.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ought to write your memoirs, Marton,&rdquo; he said, dryly, &ldquo;they would be as  gossiping as Pepys&rsquo;, as scandalous as De Grammont&rsquo;s, and as amusing as either,  but go on&mdash; anything more? Who are the new beauties?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey!&mdash;oh!  one was here to-night, Lady Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  old Balscombe married,&rdquo; said Ellersby, in a surprised tone. &ldquo;I thought he loved  no one but himself&mdash;so! and who is my lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what every one wants to know,&rdquo; replied Marton, eagerly; &ldquo;he picked her up down  in the country somewhere, but she&rsquo;s got no pedigree&mdash;no money, no talents&mdash;  nothing but personal beauty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  is worth all the rest put together, to a woman,&rdquo; interrupted Ellersby,  cynically. &ldquo;What is she like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Town-crier reeled off an auctioneer-like description at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tall,  fair, blue eyes, beautiful complexion, magnificent figure, and the devil&rsquo;s own  temper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nice  set of qualifications, especially the latter,&rdquo; murmured Ellersby. &ldquo;Balscombe  fond of her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey!&mdash;oh,  yes&mdash;madly! won&rsquo;t let her out of his sight, but he had to to-night as he&rsquo;s off  down to his place in Berkshire on business, tried to make her ladyship come  too, but she wouldn&rsquo;t because of this dance. Good Lord, fancy a dance at this  time of the year! but Kerstoke&rsquo;s wife was always slightly cracked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  Lady Balscombe reciprocate her husband&rsquo;s adoration?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marton  raised his eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and leered significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly&mdash;hey!&rdquo; he replied, chuckling. &ldquo;Calliston is first favorite there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  the deuce&mdash;I thought he was in love with old Balscombe&rsquo;s ward, Miss Penfold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  he is; but he makes love to the wife just to keep his hand in. I wouldn&rsquo;t be  surprised if it ended in the Divorce Court.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you are generally right in your surmises,&rdquo; retorted Ellersby; &ldquo;but what would  Miss Penfold say to that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey!&mdash;oh,  she&rsquo;d be glad,&rdquo; replied Marton; &ldquo;bless you, she cares more for Myles Desmond&rsquo;s  little finger than she does for the whole body of Calliston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know Myles,&rdquo; said Ellersby, promptly, &ldquo;a rattling good fellow, was with him  at Cambridge, but we somehow never hit it off&mdash;trying to make a fortune by his  pen, I hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  and hasn&rsquo;t made a penny yet, so he acts as secretary to his cousin, Lord  Calliston&mdash;he&rsquo;s next heir to the title, you know&mdash;hey!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much  chance he&rsquo;ll have of it,&rdquo; replied Ellersby, contemptuously. &ldquo;Calliston&rsquo;s sure  to marry and have heirs, unless he kills himself in the meantime with drink;  but, to revert to our former conversation&mdash;the Balscombe menage seems slightly  mixed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey!&mdash;rather.  It stands this way,&rdquo; explained Marton, eagerly: &ldquo;Balscombe&rsquo;s jealous of his  wife on account of Calliston&mdash;Lady B&mdash;&mdash; is jealous of Calliston on account of  Miss Penfold, and that young lady does not care two straws for the whole lot of  them in comparison to Myles Desmond.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sounds  like the second act of a French play,&rdquo; murmured Ellersby, yawning. &ldquo;Well, when  I see Lady Balscombe, I&rsquo;ll give you my opinion of her looks; meantime, you must  be dry after all that talking, so come and have a drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are you stopping?&rdquo; asked Marton, as they went to the supper-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guelph  Hotel, Jermyn Street,&rdquo; said Ellersby, &ldquo;only for a few days till I get my rooms  fixed up; I&rsquo;ve brought such a lot of things home that my chambers look like an  old curiosity shop. What are you having?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Champagne,&rdquo;  replied Marton. &ldquo;Oh, I say, dear boy,&rdquo; seeing his companion, with a small glass  full of brandy, &ldquo;that looks bad at this hour! Hey&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interrupted Ellersby, impatiently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only taking this to-night  because I don&rsquo;t feel up to the mark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marton  said no more, but after parting with his companion went back to the ball-room,  and meeting a friend, confided to him that poor Ellersby was going to the dogs  through drink.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brandy  neat, dear boy&mdash;hey!&rdquo; said the old reprobate. &ldquo;Bad habits these young fellows  pick up abroad&mdash;hey! Look used up, by Jove! Gal in it, dear boy&mdash;hey! Oh,  shocking!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  The Town-crier evidently did not intend to give the returned wanderer a good  character.</p>
  <p>Ellersby  was now tired of the ball, so bade good-night to his hostess, who was a queer,  thin, little woman, wearing a wig, a low-cut dress, and many jewels, giving one  the general impression that she was mostly bones and diamonds.</p>
  <p>After  taking leave of this bizarre figure Ellersby put on his coat and went outside  into the street, where he stood for a few moments, undecided whether to take a  cab to his hotel or to walk. The fog was very thick, and the gas lamps shone  through it like dull yellow stars, while the chill breezes of the night seemed  to penetrate the body of the young man, accustomed as he had been of late to  tropical climates.</p>
  <p>In  spite of the apparent discomforts offered by a walk at such a time, Ellersby  determined to risk it, thinking it would give him a certain amount of  amusement, akin somewhat to the unraveling of a puzzle, to find his way through  the fog to Jermyn Street. Smiling at the oddity of the idea of finding pleasure  in a cold walk on a foggy night, he lighted a cigar and, buttoning up his coat,  took his way down Park Lane toward Piccadilly.</p>
  <p>There  is a strange feeling in the complete isolation one experiences in fog-land&mdash;the  thick yellow mist hiding everything under its jealous veil until the pedestrian  finds himself adrift as it were on a lonely sea, and though on every side he is  environed by millions of human beings, yet the fog creates for the moment a  solitude as in those enchanted cities of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ellersby  managed to find his way to Piccadilly, and was soon swinging along the pavement  at a good round pace. Every now and then ragged figures with sinister faces  would loom suddenly out of the fog on the watch for unwary wanderers, but the  nomadic life of Ellersby having wonderfully sharpened his faculties, he was  always on his guard against the evil advances of these night-birds.  Occasionally he could hear a cab drive slowly past, the driver cautiously  steering his horse down the familiar street, which as if by magic had suddenly  assumed an unreal appearance, transforming Piccadilly into a vague immensity  resembling the steppes of Russia.</p>
  <p>With  his ears alert for every sound, and his eyes peering anxiously into the veil of  gray mist, Ellersby hurried along, managed to cross the street, and, by some  miracle of dexterity which he placed at once to the credit of instinct, turned  down St. James&rsquo;s Street, and it was here his first mishap occurred, for just as  he rounded the corner he came against a young man hastening in the opposite  direction at a rapid pace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the stranger, quickly, &ldquo;but the fog is so dense I could  not see&mdash;excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  he was about to hurry away, when Ellersby, recognizing the voice, stopped him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, Desmond,&rdquo; he said, gayly, &ldquo;and give an old friend a word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Desmond  seemed annoyed at being recognized, and looking sharply at the face of the  other, gave vent to an ejaculation of surprise, which however had not a very  delighted ring in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ellersby,  by Jove!&rdquo; he said, in a hesitating manner. &ldquo;I thought you were in Persia or in  Patagonia. Who the deuce would have expected to see you in Piccadilly on such a  devil of a night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  been to a ball,&rdquo; explained Ellersby, &ldquo;and thought I&rsquo;d walk back to my hotel  just to renew my acquaintance with London fogs. It was a mad freak, but  amusing. Come to my hotel and have a night-cap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,  awfully,&rdquo; said Desmond, hurriedly, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m in a hurry. Where are  you staying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guelph  Hotel, Jermyn Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo;  said Desmond, with a start. &ldquo;Jermyn Street &mdash;all right, look you up to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment,&rdquo; observed Ellersby, detaining him. &ldquo;Tell me where is Calliston? I  want to see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much chance,&rdquo; replied Desmond, shaking his head; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone off to-night down  to Shoreham&mdash;yachting, you know. Wants to go to the Azores; well, see you  to-morrow; good-night&mdash;I&rsquo;m in a deuce of a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke rapidly, &nbsp;with nervous agitation  quite at variance with his usual demeanor, as Ellersby knew, and as he went off  quickly and was swallowed up by the fog, the latter resumed his walk with a  quiet laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  woman, I bet,&rdquo; he said to himself, as he made his way cautiously along. &ldquo;Fancy  Venus on such a discouraging night as this&mdash;the rosy mists enveloping the  goddess are charming, but a London fog&mdash;ah, bah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stood on the pavement, wondering how he could strike Jermyn Street, and was  about to attempt to cross on the chance of his luck guiding him, when suddenly  the tall form of a policeman loomed out of the fog and flashed the bright light  of a lantern on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  just in time, policeman,&rdquo; said Ellersby, in a relieved tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got slightly  astray in this fog, so you must guide me to the Guelph Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  across the street, sir,&rdquo; replied the policeman, touching his helmet, and he  stepped off the pavement, followed by Ellersby.</p>
  <p>They  soon got into Jermyn Street, and went along the left-hand side toward the  hotel. Though the fog was still thick, Ellersby in the vanity of his heart  thought he could now find the way for himself. He gave the policeman half a  crown, and going along a few yards, went up what he supposed were the steps of  the hotel. The policeman stood in the same place, ready to render his services  as a guide should he be required, when suddenly he was startled by a cry from  Ellersby.</p>
  <p>The  young man had gone up the wrong steps, and was standing on the top when the  policeman hurried up, while at his feet was a bundle of what looked like,  clothes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say, policeman,&rdquo; said Ellersby, in an agitated tone, &ldquo;here is a woman&mdash;I believe  she&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead  drunk, more like, sir,&rdquo; replied the policeman, skeptically, ascending the  steps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Ellersby, &ldquo;I have shaken her and she will not waken. Her face is quite  cold&mdash;just look!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  policeman, somewhat startled out of his professional phlegm, turned the light  down on the figure of the woman which was lying in the door-way. It was that of  a female with a fair face and golden hair, dressed in a long sealskin jacket,  and a silk dress, with a fashionably shaped hat on her head. Her well-gloved  hands were tightly clinched, and her eyes, wide open, were staring straight up  at the horrified discoverers. There did not seem to be any wound or blood  about, but her face was swollen, and appeared to be of a dark purple color,  with the tongue slightly protruding between the teeth. It was not by any means  a pleasant sight, and both men felt a sensation of horror</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  dead, sure enough, sir,&rdquo; said the policeman at length, and blew a whistle. To  this call there was an answer, and soon another policeman made his appearance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  looks as if she had been strangled,&rdquo; said Ellersby, who was much upset by the  discovery, &ldquo;her face is so purple and her tongue protruding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  first policeman bent down and looked at the neck of the corpse, but could see  no marks of violence, so he shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  know, sir,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It looks a queer sort of case. We&rsquo;ll take the body to  the hospital, and see what the doctors say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  the meantime the other policeman had gone for aid, and in a few minutes two  more made their appearance with a stretcher, upon which the body was placed and  taken to the nearest hospital.</p>
  <p>In  accordance with a request made by the policeman, Ellersby gave his card, so  that he could be called on to appear at the inquest, and then went to the  Guelph Hotel, which was only a short distance up the street.</p>
  <p>When  he arrived he had a glass of brandy neat, for he felt quite sick with the  horrible sight he had witnessed, and all through the night his sleep was broken  by visions of the beautiful face distorted with agony.</p>
  <p>In  truth, it was a tragical termination to a night&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_II"></a>Chapter II<br>
    The News Of The Day</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;HASH&rdquo;  was a weekly paper, owned by one American, edited by another, and conducted on  strictly American principles. It mostly consisted of sharp, incisive  paragraphs, strongly epigrammatic in their phraseology, and attention was drawn  to these by startling sensational headings. The staff of this journal composed  two men besides the editor, and there was a good deal of paste and scissors  work in connection with the production of a number. As to the name, &ldquo;Hash,&rdquo; it  requires some explanation.</p>
  <p>The  word &ldquo;hash&rdquo; is used in America to designate a certain dish much in favor with  lodging-house keepers in the land of the free, wherein all the unconsidered  trifles left over from the six dinners of the week are made into a savory stew  to serve for the seventh, and, being highly spiced and deftly concocted, is apt  to deceive an inexperienced novice in lodging-house cookery, inasmuch as he  deems it a dish formed of new ingredients, a mistaken view, as can be seen from  the foregoing explanation.</p>
  <p>The  proprietor of &ldquo;Hash,&rdquo; therefore, did, in a literary sense, that which is often  done in a culinary one, for, by stealing items of news from other sources and  making them into spicy little paragraphs, he succeeded in producing a very  readable paper, much in favor with Londoners.</p>
  <p>If  there was any new scandal or shocking occurrence, &ldquo;Hash&rdquo; was sure to have a  bright and witty description of it, and consequently sold capitally. It was in  this paper that the following items of interest were told to the public a week  after the discovery of the body in Jermyn Street:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re  at it again. When will the British aristocracy learn that they must not covet  their neighbor&rsquo;s wife? Another elopement has taken place, which will doubtless  end as usual in the Divorce Court. Same old game.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Last  Monday Lady B&mdash;left her home and went off with Lord C&mdash;, an intimate friend of  the lady&rsquo;s husband. It generally is the intimate friend who is on the racket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  guilty couple have sailed in a yacht for foreign climes, and the indignant  husband, Sir K&mdash;B&mdash;is inquiring for their whereabouts. If he calls at our office,  we will lend him articles of warfare, and do our best to put him on the track.  There is nothing new or original about this comedy&mdash;they all do it. It&rsquo;s getting  a trifle monotonous, and we should suggest something new in the elopement  line&mdash;a mother-in-law, for instance. Good old mother-in-law!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  the pursuing husband comes up with the flying lovers, we will give a report of  the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  the same number of &ldquo;Hash&rdquo; a longer article appeared, headed:</p>
  <p>Cain  was an amateur in the art of murder, but then he had no one to copy from, so  his clumsiness must be excused. The crime of Jermyn Street, however, is an  admirable example how civilization can improve the difficult art of taking life  in a skillful manner. The whole affair is quite dramatic, so we will divide  this tragedy into acts, and place it before our readers.</p>
  <p><i>Act I.</i>&mdash;Scene, Jermyn Street; foggy morning; half past two.</p>
  <p>Enter  Spencer Ellersby on his way to hotel from ball. In dense fog he mistakes his  hotel&mdash;goes up wrong steps; there finds body of dead woman. Utters a cry of  horror&mdash;cue for policeman, who enters; views body by lantern light&mdash;sealskin  jacket, silk dress, fair hair, beautiful face&mdash;sounds whistle; enter other  policemen, who exeunt with body in one direction, while Spencer Ellersby goes  off in the other.</p>
  <p><i>Act II.</i>&mdash; Scene, hospital. Present, inspector, policeman, and  doctor.</p>
  <p>Doctor  examines body&mdash;finds no evidence of violence, except slight discolored mark on  one side of neck&mdash;opinion of inspector that something, chain probably, has been  wrenched off by assassin&mdash;is also of opinion that death could not have been thus  caused. Doctor says death is caused by blood-poisoning&mdash;evidence being, swollen  condition of body, protruding tongue, discoloration of skin&mdash;thinks it must be  poison&mdash;makes minute examination&mdash;finds on neck slight scratch just on jugular  vein, greatly inflamed &mdash;is of opinion that assassin has wounded victim in neck  with poisoned dagger or knife. Inspector takes description of body for purpose  of having hand-bills printed to distribute about city&mdash;<i>exeunt omnes</i> with body to Morgue.</p>
  <p><i>Act III.</i> is so long that we will drop the dramatic style and  tell it in our own fashion. Our special reporter was at the inquest, and the  following are the results of his inquiries:</p>
  <p>The  body of the deceased was examined by the jury, and the following articles of  clothing were put in evidence:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.  Sealskin jacket.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Silk dress. Gloves.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Under linen (not marked).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Hat (brown and blue velvet intertwined, clasped with  silver crescent).</p>
  <p>Evidence  of Spencer Ellersby:</p>
  <p>Independent  gentleman. Been traveling for some years, and only returned to England a month  ago. Was at Countess of Kerstoke&rsquo;s ball on Monday last&mdash;left at a few minutes  past two o&rsquo;clock&mdash;walked along Picadilly; met a friend in St. James&rsquo;s Street&mdash;spoke  to him for a few moments. When he left him, met policeman, who guided him  through fog to Jermyn Street&mdash;left policeman and went up steps, thinking it was  Guelph Hotel&mdash;found there body of deceased&mdash;called policeman, and body was taken  to hospital. Does not know deceased in any way.</p>
  <p>Evidence  of Constable Batter:</p>
  <p>Corroboration  of evidence of former witness.</p>
  <p>Evidence  of Dr. Fanton:</p>
  <p>Examined  body of deceased&mdash;well nourished. Deceased had evidently been in good health.  Should say she had been dead at time of examination about three hours. Death  appeared to have been caused by paralysis. The blood was disorganized,  therefore he judged deceased had been poisoned, and disorganization was caused  by action of virus. The veins were congested&mdash;lungs full of blood, congealed,  and of a dark color. The face was swollen, and of a dark purple  appearance&mdash;tongue also protruded. Small wound on neck over jugular vein, in  itself not sufficient to cause death. Thought from all appearances that the  assassin had inflicted wound with poisoned dagger or knife, hence appearance of  body. If a powerful poison, it would act in a very short time, as the blood in  jugular vein went straight to the heart. Poison would act in about ten  minutes&mdash;if deceased had been excited, in even a shorter time.</p>
  <p>This  closed the evidence.</p>
  <p>Inspector  said all inquiries had been made to find name of deceased, but no clew had as  yet been obtained. The case had been placed in the hands of Detective Dowker,  who was present.</p>
  <p>Coroner  summed up.</p>
  <p>Woman  had been found dead&mdash;proved by evidence of Policeman Batter and Mr. Ellersby.</p>
  <p>Poison  administered through wound in neck by means of dagger, knife, or lancet. No  evidence to show who had inflicted wound.</p>
  <p>Jury  would please return verdict in accordance with evidence.</p>
  <p>The  jury consulted for a few minutes and returned verdict. That deceased had come  to her death by violence by the hand of some person or persons unknown.</p>
  <p>This  is the whole statement of the case which we have entitled The Piccadilly  Puzzle, and we will now make our own comments thereon.</p>
  <p>In  the first place, from all appearances, the deceased was evidently a lady and  not a street walker. We know that many street walkers are ladies who have  fallen into that state of degradation, but this unknown woman was not one of  them in our opinion, for as far as we can learn she bore no marks of  dissipation which such a life would inevitably cause. Again, if she had been an <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of the streets she would have  been known to the police, but none of them were able to identify her. True, her  face had been swollen and disfigured by the action of the poison, so that in  any case it would have been difficult to recognize the features, still her  dress and figure might lead to identification, but no result had been arrived  at. The deceased, therefore, to all appearances, was a lady. Jermyn Street is  not a particularly busy thoroughfare at any time, and after eleven o&rsquo;clock it  is comparatively deserted, therefore the assassin must have decoyed his victim  there to accomplish his crime in safety. He might have had an appointment to  meet her, and while talking to her in the door-way, had he embraced her, might  doubtless have wounded her with the poisonous weapon. She would only feel a  pin-prick, and then he could watch the poison do its work. She would become  confused and then giddy, entertaining no idea that she carried death in her  veins. Then passing into a comatose state she would sink to the ground in a  dying condition. Her companion had then probably left her, satisfied that she  could not call out. There seems to have been a great deal of devilish ingenuity  about the committal of the crime, and this brings us to the consideration as to  the position in life held by the assassin.</p>
  <p>We  hold that he is a gentleman, or at least an educated man, possibly a medical  man, a medical student, or a <i>dilettante</i> in toxicology. A common assassin would have decoyed his victim into a house and  murdered her in a more brutal manner, by cutting her throat or battering her  head with a poker, but this strange assassin, secure in the possession of a  weapon more deadly, engages his unhappy victim in confidential talk, and whilst  embracing her causes her death in a sure manner. It is a Judas-like crime, the  kiss of friendship and the heart of treachery, therefore we say the criminal  who possesses these refined and fiendish instincts must be an educated man, and  also one who must have no little knowledge of poisons to employ the subtle drug  he did. The nature of the poison can not be discovered, as the simple scratch  corrupted the blood and there are no local signs to tell what kind was  employed. As to the motive of the crime, it may have been love, it may have  been jealousy, perhaps robbery, as no money or jewelry were found on the body,  and there was a mark on the neck as though a chain had been roughly wrenched  off. What we have set forth is mere conjecture, for the assassin may be a  woman, but we think this improbable. No woman would have the nerve to commit  such a crime in the open street&mdash;true, the assassin was favored by the fog,  which hid his or her crime behind an impenetrable veil, but still the risk was  enormous.</p>
  <p>But  be the assassin man or woman, there is no doubt we have in our midst a human  fiend who, possessed of a deadly weapon, namely, a poisoned dagger, can commit  crimes with impunity? A slight scratch given in a certain portion of the body  and the victim is doomed. Who is to point out the assassin, unless he or she is  actually seen committing the crime. We have not yet heard the end of the  Piccadilly Puzzle, but it will take all the acumen and ingenuity of the London  detective to trace this secret assassin, and our only dread is lest some other  victim may fall before his or her terrible weapon.</p>
  <p>But  though the assassin of this unknown woman may escape the consequences of this  crime, sooner or later he will thirst again for blood, and the second time he  may not be so fortunate. Let him remember</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_III"></a>Chapter III <br>
    Dowker&mdash;Detective</b></h2>
  <p>Mr.  DOWKER was a long lean man of a drab color. His hair was thin, of a neutral  tint, his eyes a watery blue, and his somewhat large mouth, drawn down at the  corners, betokened a lachrymose nature. He wore grayish clothes always a little  threadbare, and large thick-soled boots, chosen rather for utility than beauty.  His head-gear consisted of a sad-colored soft hat pulled well over his eyes,  from under which his scanty hair hung in a depressing manner. In fact, he had a  somewhat sketchy appearance, as if he had been outlined and waited to be filled  up with color, but this stage of development, which would have turned him into  a thing of beauty, was never arrived at, and his general appearance was dismal  in the extreme. He wore a beard, that is, several tufts of straggly hair were  planted in patches over his face, but did not seem to flourish. He never  smiled, and frequently sighed, so that his manners as well as his appearance  were not calculated to inculcate cheerful thoughts.</p>
  <p>But  notwithstanding this unprepossessing exterior, there was no cleverer man in  London, and the most dexterous criminal would rather have had any other  detective after him than this apparently unpromising thief-catcher. The outward  resemblance of a man is not invariably the index of his mind, and the Puritan  physiognomy of Mr. Dowker was a very serviceable mask to the acuteness and  brilliancy of his intellect. Consequently, when the Piccadilly Puzzle case  promised to be such a difficult one to unravel, it was placed in the hands of  Mr. Dowker and the whole affair left entirely to him. Dowker was pleased at  this tribute to his cleverness, and sighed in an approving manner as he rapidly  reviewed all the evidence which had come under the eyes of the police.</p>
  <p>In  the first place it would be necessary to discover the name of the deceased, and  then by finding out the manner of her life, the motive of the crime might be  discovered, pointing to the criminal. The clothing was not marked in any way,  but on examining the hat, Dowker found from a ticket on the inside that it had been  purchased at the shop of Mme. Rene in Regent Street; so, wrapping up the hat in  paper, he betook himself to the establishment of that lady, as the first step  in the chain of evidence which he hoped to complete by the discovery of the  assassin.</p>
  <p>Mme.  Rene&rsquo;s establishment was one of the smartest in London, and was well known to  the feminine world, who were accustomed to pay the exorbitant sums demanded  there for goods which could have been bought much cheaper elsewhere, but then  they would not have been stamped with Mme. Rene&rsquo;s approval, and that omission  was to declare that the article was unfashionable. Mme. Rene&rsquo;s trade mark being  thus indispensable, ladies never ventured to go anywhere else if they could  possibly manage it, and Mme. Rene flourished greatly.</p>
  <p>Dowker  entered the shop and asked to see Mme. Rene, to whose presence he was conducted  at once, for the detective was well-known there, having been frequently  employed by madame in missions of a delicate nature, principally concerning  ladies of high rank and diamonds.</p>
  <p>Madame  herself was short and stout, with a thoroughly English face, and indeed she had  been born within the sound of Bow Bells, but took her French name for trade  purposes. Her voice was sharp and shrill, and her black eyes bold and piercing&mdash;a  thorough woman of business, who knew the value of money and time, so wasted  neither.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Mr. Dowker,&rdquo; said madame, when the detective had taken his seat in her private  office and closed the door, &ldquo;what is the matter now? I was just going to send  for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about?&rdquo; asked Dowker, with a sigh. &ldquo;More trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Lady  Balscombe&rsquo;s run away with Lord Calliston, and she owes me a lot of money, so I  want to know the chances of getting paid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any  security?&rdquo; inquired the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes&mdash;I&rsquo;m not such a fool as to lend ladies money without security,&rdquo; said madame,  with a shrill laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a diamond necklace, but I think it belongs to  Sir Rupert Balscombe&mdash;part of the family jewels&mdash;I suppose I&rsquo;d better go and see  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that would be the wisest plan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  sniffed the lady, frowning, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. On the one hand he may pay me my  money and redeem the necklace, on the other he may kick up a row, and I don&rsquo;t  want my dealings in this way made public. I&rsquo;d have a whole army of husbands  down on me&mdash;just like men&mdash;they go to the Jews themselves to get ready money, and  when their wives do a bit of borrowing with their milliners, they make a fuss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not sell the necklace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I&rsquo;m going to do as soon as I hear from Lady Balscombe. I suppose she&rsquo;ll be  divorced, and marry Calliston&mdash;more fool she, for he&rsquo;s a scamp&mdash;then she&rsquo;ll want  to redeem the necklace quietly; but I don&rsquo;t know where to write to her. Where  have they gone to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hear in a yacht to the Azores,&rdquo; said Dowker, who knew everything; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll turn  up again, I&rsquo;ve no doubt&mdash;then you can see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  an idiot she was to give up such a fair position!&rdquo; said madame, who looked at  the whole affair from a purely worldly point of view. &ldquo;She was nobody when Sir  Rupert picked her up, and he gave her everything&mdash;she made ducks and drakes of  his money&mdash;they fought, and the result is she&rsquo;s gone off with Calliston&mdash;a man  who is the biggest scamp in town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know, got a little crib in St. John&rsquo;s Wood,&rdquo; said Dowker, who had no  hesitation in talking plainly to this woman, who knew as much about fast life  as he did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I hear&mdash;never saw his mistress, but hear she&rsquo;s a beautiful woman&mdash;there will be a  row when she hears his latest escapade; but he&rsquo;ll get tired of Lady Balscombe  and go back to the St. John&rsquo;s Wood establishment&mdash;they always do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  the whole affair will end as usual,&rdquo; said the detective with a sigh, &ldquo;in a  public scandal and divorce; but I want to see you about this,&rdquo; and taking the  hat out of the parcel, he laid it before madame. It was rather  striking-looking&mdash;black straw, with brown and blue velvets twisted together and  caught on one side with a slender silver crescent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; said madame, glancing at it. &ldquo;Rather good style, I think. What do  you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  name of the person you sold it to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&mdash;rather  a difficult question to answer&mdash;some one might have bought it and taken it away  with them, but if they left an address I&rsquo;ll soon find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  touched a bell, and a girl appeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send  Miss Brail to me&mdash;she&rsquo;s invaluable,&rdquo; explained madame to Dowker, when the girl  had vanished. &ldquo;Such a wonderful memory, forgets nothing. I find her useful in  my deals with ladies&mdash;a milliner&rsquo;s business is not all bonnets and hats, as we  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  more than the world does,&rdquo; responded Dowker, with as near an approach to a  smile as he allowed himself.</p>
  <p>Miss  Brail made her appearance, and decided the question at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was sold to a lady about two months ago&mdash;somewhere in St John&rsquo;s Wood,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  she a real lady?&rdquo; asked Dowker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she was more like a servant,&rdquo; responded Miss Brail, doubtfully; &ldquo;I should say a  lady&rsquo;s-maid,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it sent?&rdquo; asked madame, impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the  address is in the book,&rdquo; answered Miss Brail, and went out to get the book. In  a few moments she returned, and announced:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lydia  Fenny, Cleopatra Villa, St. John&rsquo;s Wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  spite of his habitual phlegm, Dowker started, on perceiving which, madame  dismissed Miss Brail at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you start?&rdquo; she asked, curiously, when the door had closed.</p>
  <p>Dowker  sighed in his usual manner, and taking out his handkerchief, twisted it up into  a hard ball, a sure sign that he was impressed in some way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cleopatra  Villa is Lord Calliston&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said madame, in rather an amazed tone, &ldquo;what a curious thing we should have been  speaking about him! I suppose this Lydia Fenny is the lady&rsquo;s-maid there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the lady&rsquo;s-maid,&rdquo; corrected Dowker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  this hat,&rdquo; touching it, &ldquo;was sold by you to Lydia Fenny&mdash;she is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  the victim of the Jermyn Street murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  Mme. Rene sprung to her feet, greatly agitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wanted to find out the name of the dead woman in order to get a clew to the  perpetrator of the crime,&rdquo; explained Dowker, rapidly. &ldquo;This hat was on the head  when the body was discovered. It had a mark inside showing it was bought here,  so I came here to find out to whom it was sold. You tell me Lydia Fenny, so the  logical conclusion is that Lydia Fenny is the victim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all very strange,&rdquo; said madame, rapidly looking at him with keen eyes, &ldquo;but it  may not be Lydia Fenny at all. Other hats might have been made similar to this  one, or Lydia Fenny might have lent or given the hat to another person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is only one way of finding that out,&rdquo; said Dowker, wrapping up the hat and  rising to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  make inquiries at Cleopatra Villa. Good-day,&rdquo; and the detective went out,  leaving madame transfixed with astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo;  she said at length. &ldquo;I wonder if Lord Calliston&rsquo;s got anything to do with this  murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_IV"></a>Chapter IV<br>
    The St. John&rsquo;s Wood Establishment</b></h2>
  <p>CLEOPATRA  VILLA was a pleasant house and a very expensive one, as Lord Calliston found to  his cost. But then the presiding deity, by name Lena Sarschine, was very  beautiful, and insisted upon having her dwelling fitted up in a corresponding  manner, so Calliston gave way, and spent a small fortune on this bijou  residence.</p>
  <p>Dowker  knew a good many of these little paradises with their worldly wise Eves, the  existence of whom was not supposed to be known to the polite world, so he felt  quite at ease when upon ringing the bell he was admitted to the garden by a  solemn-looking man-servant. He was well acquainted with Calliston&rsquo;s life both  public and private&mdash; neither side being very reputable&mdash;but then, with such  advantages of wrong-doing as the world now offers, &lsquo;tis hard to be virtuous.</p>
  <p>Calliston  had come into the title while in his childhood, and, the estate having been  well looked after during his minority, he found plenty of money to spend when  he came of age, and he certainly did spend it. Horse-racing and yachting were  his two principal pleasures, but curiously enough his name was never mixed up  with any well-known woman, and few of his friends knew except by hearsay of the  divinity who dwelt in Cleopatra Villa. Calliston had fallen in love with her  down in the country some years before, and bringing her up to town installed  her in the bijou residence, which she rarely left. Occasionally she went to the  theater, and sometimes drove in the park, but at such rare intervals that few  people knew who she was. Calliston was very jealous of her, and seldom asked  his friends to supper; but she was reported by the few who had been thus  honored to be a very beautiful woman with charming manners. The general opinion  was that he would end up by marrying her, when his entanglement with Lady  Balscombe became known, and henceforward he was seen more by that lady&rsquo;s side  than in the neighborhood of St. John&rsquo;s Wood.</p>
  <p>Dowker,  from some mysterious source only known to himself, was cognizant of all this,  and had now come down to discover what connection the establishment of St. John&rsquo;s  Wood had with the murder in Jermyn Street.</p>
  <p>He  knew that Calliston had gone off with Lady Balscombe, so said he had a message  from him and would like to see Miss Sarschine. The servant showed him into a  magnificently furnished drawing-room, where he awaited the appearance of the  lady, intending when she entered to ask her all particulars about her maid  Lydia Fenny, with a view to discovering the perpetrator of the crime. Being of  an inquiring turn of mind, Dowker arose from his seat when the door was closed,  and folding his hands behind his back strolled about the room, his lank,  gray-clad figure seeming sadly out of place.</p>
  <p>It  was not a very large apartment, but luxuriously furnished, the walls being hung  with pale-green silk draped in graceful folds and caught up here and there with  thick silver cords. The carpet, also of a pale-green, was embroidered with  bunches of white flowers, and the window-curtains were of soft white Liberty  silk. There were two windows on one side in deep recesses filled with  brilliantly tinted flowers, white blossoms predominating, and at the end of the  room were folding-doors opening into a conservatory filled with ferns, in the  middle of which a small fountain splashed musically into a wide marble basin.  There were low velvet-covered lounging-chairs all about, tables covered with  bric-a-brac and photographs in oxidized silver frames, while here and there on  the carpet were skins of bears and tigers. Contrary to the usual custom in  drawing-rooms, there was only one mirror, a small oval glass over the  mantel-piece framed in pale-green plush. In the corners were high palms and  other tropical vegetation, with white marble statues peering from out of their  green leaves, and in one corner a handsome grand piano, on the top of which lay  a lot of sheet music. The room was illuminated by two or three tall brass lamps  with bright green shades smothered in creamy lace, and just over the piano were  a number of quaint-looking weapons arranged in a fantastic fashion. Highland  broadswords, Indian daggers, and Malay creeses were all grouped round a small  silver shield handsomely embossed, and though at first they seemed somewhat out  of place against the rich silk hangings, yet when the eyes became accustomed to  them the effect was not unpleasant.</p>
  <p>Dowker  took a leisurely survey of the apartment and then returned to his seat to await  the appearance of Miss Sarschine and to think over the curious aspect the  Piccadilly case now presented.</p>
  <p>His  cogitations ran somewhat after this fashion.</p>
  <p>The  time of the discovery of the body by Mr. Ellersby was about half past two&mdash;the  medical evidence at the inquest was to the effect that the deceased had been  dead about two hours, so allowing a margin for possible inaccuracies, the crime  must have been committed about midnight, at which time there would be a certain  amount of traffic through Jermyn Street. But then the spectacle of a man  talking to a woman in a door-way of a house would hardly attract much  attention, and if the murderer had accomplished his purpose by means of poison  there was no doubt the fanciful description given by &ldquo;Hash&rdquo; would be tolerably  correct. Supposing the assassin to have wounded his victim by means of a  poisoned weapon, she would have become confused and giddy, finally passing into  a comatose state, in which she would quietly expire. Therefore, there would be  no screaming to attract the attention of passers-by, and albeit in any case  lying down would have aroused curiosity, yet the fog was so thick on that night  that no one would see the position of the criminal and his victim.</p>
  <p>Now,  the next question was why did Miss Sarschine not make inquiries after her  maid&mdash;a week had elapsed since the murder, and the girl&rsquo;s absence for that time  would certainly seem unaccountable. On her non-appearance her mistress would  watch the papers to see if anything had happened to her. She would then notice  the Jermyn Street murder, and from the description given would have no  difficulty in recognizing her servant. Since, though she had without doubt  become cognizant of the fact that Lydia Fenny was dead, she had not come  forward to identify the body, Dowker pondered over the reason she had for this  reticence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  can&rsquo;t have committed the crime herself,&rdquo; said Dowker, in a puzzled tone, &ldquo;as  she would hardly do so in such a public place. But why has she been so quiet?  Again, she couldn&rsquo;t know anything about poisoned weapons. No, she must have  some other reason for holding her tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment his attention was caught by the display of weapons on the wall, and  with a short exclamation he walked across the room and looked sharply at them.  They were arranged in a fantastic pattern, each side being the same, but here  Dowker noticed with much curiosity that one side was incomplete, a Malay creese  having been removed. He looked at the other side and there were certainly two  arranged crossways, but on the other there was only one. Dowker was startled by  this discovery, as it seemed to point to the fact that the crime had been  committed by the missing creese. He knew the Malays were a savage nation, and  without doubt poisoned their daggers, so the absence of one of these would  argue that this had been the weapon used. He gingerly touched the point of a  creese with the tip of his finger, and then drew it hastily away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be poisoned,&rdquo; he muttered, looking at his finger to assure himself he had  not broken the skin. &ldquo;I wonder if it is&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Glancing  hastily round the room to make sure he was alone, he took a creese from the  wall on the other side, so that the pattern was now equalized, and trusted to  this fact to hide his abstraction of the weapon. Then he took some old letters  out of his pocket, and tearing them up into strips carefully swathed the blade  of the creese to prevent possible accidents, and slipped the parcel into his  breast-pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go and see a doctor,&rdquo; he muttered to himself as he buttoned his coat, &ldquo;and try  the effect of this on a dog; if the symptoms of death are the same, that will  be proof conclusive that the missing dagger was used to commit the crime. Once  I establish that, I&rsquo;ll soon find out the guilty party, as it must have been  some one in this house, especially as Lydia Fenny was a servant here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  walked back again to his chair and had just sat down when the door opened and a  woman entered. Not at all pretty, medium height, dark hair and eyes, and a  sharps active-looking face, which, however, was disfigured by marks of the  small-pox. She was dressed in a well-made dark costume and wore a knot of  crimson ribbon round her throat. Dowker surveyed this lady carefully, and  instantly came to the conclusion that this was a fellow-servant of Lydia  Fenny&mdash;certainly not Miss Sarschine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang  it,&rdquo; muttered Dowker, &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t make love to that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  new-comer advanced as Dowker arose to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  want to see Miss Sarschine?&rdquo; she asked, looking at the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  have I the pleasure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I am not Miss Sarschine, but I can let her have any message you wish delivered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  not I see the lady herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can not; she is out of town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Dowker looked rather blank. This then was the reason Miss Sarschine did not  come forward to identify the body.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  whom is your message?&rdquo; asked the woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From&mdash;from&mdash;Lord  Calliston,&rdquo; said Dowker, in a hesitating manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  impossible,&rdquo; replied the woman, curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Lord Calliston is away yachting, and Miss Sarschine is with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  indeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  was beginning to feel rather nonplused, as he was now at a loss for an excuse  for his presence, so he tried another plan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you read the papers?&rdquo; he asked, sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes;  not often,&rdquo; said the woman, somewhat taken aback. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have particular reasons for the question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not bound to answer your question. May I ask your name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dowker&mdash;detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  woman started at this and looked a little curiously at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  any of the servants of this house missing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  me! Have any been lately dismissed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  do you allude to any particular servant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  Lydia Fenny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  woman started again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is dead. If you had read the papers you would have noticed the Jermyn Street  tragedy. She is the victim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is some mistake,&rdquo; said the woman, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; replied Dowker, coolly taking out the hat from the newspaper. &ldquo;Do  you know this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  the sight of the hat the woman became violently agitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  where did you get this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was on the head of the woman who was murdered.&rdquo; The other gave a cry and  staggered back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my God!&rdquo; she said, under her breath, &ldquo;what does it all mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mean?  It means that Lydia Fenny is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  she cried, vehemently, &ldquo;not dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I am Lydia Fenny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  stared at her aghast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she went on, rapidly, &ldquo;the hat is mine. How did you find out I was the owner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went to Madame Rene and she told me you bought it from her. But who was the  dead woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydia  Fenny gave a cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid to say&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid to say. How was she dressed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a sealskin jacket, a silk dress, and that hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydia  wrung her hands in despair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must be true,&rdquo; she moaned; &ldquo;it is the dress she wore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  wore?&rdquo; asked Dowker, in an excited tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  mistress&mdash;Miss Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  case seemed to be more mysterious than ever; instead of the maid it was the  mistress. Dowker took a photograph of the deceased and gave it to Lydia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is that?&rdquo; he asked, eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Sarschine,&rdquo; she replied, quickly. &ldquo;But what is the matter with her face?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swollen  by poison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poison?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  On Monday last she was found lying dead in Jermyn Street, killed by a poisoned  dagger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Last  Monday night!&rdquo; said Lydia, with a gasp, &ldquo;that was the last time I saw her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here,&rdquo; said Dowker, quietly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better tell me all about it. I am employed  in the case, and I want to discover who murdered your mistress; so tell me all  you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydia  Fenny, who seemed to possess strong nerves, sat down and began to speak  deliberately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell you everything, and help you to bring the murderer of my poor  mistress to justice; but I don&rsquo;t know any one who would have killed her. She  lived a very quiet life and had few friends. Lord Calliston came here very  frequently, and she was very much in love with him.</p>
  <p>Where  she came from I don&rsquo;t know, as I have only been with her about a year, but he  often told her he would make her his wife, and she was always imploring him to  do so. About three months ago he met some great lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Balscombe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that was the name&mdash;and fell in love with her. He neglected Miss Sarschine, and  she reproached him. There was a lot of trouble and quarreling between them, and  Lord Calliston stayed away a good bit. Three weeks ago I went away for a  holiday, and when I came back I found my mistress in a terrible state. She had  discovered in some way that Lord Calliston had determined to elope with Lady  Balscombe and go off to the Azores in his yacht. Miss Sarschine was mad with  rage; she said she would kill them both; and then thought she&rsquo;d play a trick  upon Lord Calliston and go off with him instead. This was on Monday last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  time of the murder,&rdquo; murmured Dowker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  went to Lord Calliston&rsquo;s rooms in Piccadilly and found out from his valet that  he intended to leave town that evening for Shoreham, where his yacht was lying,  and that Lady Balscombe was to follow him early next morning. So she came back  here and, waiting till the evening, dressed herself and put on my hat as less  conspicuous than her own. She intended to catch the ten minutes past nine train  from London Bridge Station and, go right on board Lord Calliston&rsquo;s yacht, and  insist upon his sailing and leaving Lady Balscombe in the lurch. She went out  about seven with that intention, and since then I have heard nothing of her. I  thought she had carried out her scheme and gone off with Lord Calliston to the  Azores.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you not hear of the Jermyn Street murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  casually, but I never thought of connecting it with my mistress, and all the  servants here live very quietly, so they would never think Miss Sarschine was  the victim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was she doing in Jermyn Street?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you. Lord Calliston has rooms in Piccadilly, so perhaps she went  there first, and then through Jermyn Street on her way to the station.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not know any one who had a grudge against her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no  one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  arose to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will call and see you again,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but meanwhile give me Lord Calliston&rsquo;s  address in Piccadilly, and I will find out if Miss Sarschine was at his rooms  on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydia  Fenny, who was now crying, gave the necessary address and followed him to the  door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment,&rdquo; said Dowker, stopping. &ldquo;Where is the dagger that used to be on the  wall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydia  looked round for the weapons and gave a cry of astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  are gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have the one; but the other&mdash;where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Sarschine took it down on Monday, and said if Calliston did not take her with  him she&rsquo;d kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kill  him&mdash;not herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  she had no idea of committing suicide. What are you going to do with the other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try  it on a dog, and find out if the symptoms of death are the same, then I will  know the companion dagger to this was the cause of your mistress&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  who would take it from her and use it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I&rsquo;ve got to find out. She must have met some one in Jermyn Street who  killed her with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can&rsquo;t be suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly.  The wound is in the jugular vein in the neck, so it could hardly have been  self-inflicted. Besides, she would not choose a public street to die in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  shall I see you again?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  I have found out what took place in the Piccadilly chambers on Monday last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Dowker departed, very well satisfied with the result of his inquiries.</p>

    The Piccadilly Rooms</b></h2>
  <p>CALLISTON  occupied a suite of rooms in a side street leading off Piccadilly; and very  comfortable apartments they were, being luxuriously furnished in the prevailing  fashion of the day. His sitting-room was hung with dark-red curtains and carpet  to match, and the furniture being of a kind designed to promote ease and  comfort, it looked very snug, particularly at night. There was a desk in one  corner of the room piled, up with a disorderly heap of papers. Over this were  fencing-foils and boxing-gloves, arranged against the wall, and the pictures  mostly consisted of photographs of pretty women and paintings of celebrated  horses. There was a small table near the fire-place on which lay pipes,  cigar-boxes and tobacco-jars, and on the sideboard a spirit stand, which was  much in favor with Calliston&rsquo;s friends. A small book-case contained an  assortment of French novels, principally of the Zola and Mendes school, and,  judging from the shabby appearance of the books, must have been pretty well  read. The whole apartment had a dissipated air, and the atmosphere was still impregnated  with a faint odor of stale tobacco smoke. Opening off this apartment were a  dressing-room and bedroom, and though the whole <i>m&eacute;nage</i> was somewhat limited, yet it made up in quality what it  lacked in quantity.</p>
  <p>When  Calliston was away, his Lares and Penates were looked after by a worthy lady,  who rejoiced in the name of Mrs. Povy, an appellation which has in its sound a  certain aroma of Pepys&rsquo; Diary, but Lord Calliston and his friends not being  acquainted with the ingenuous pages of the quaint Samuel, were unaware of this,  so Mrs. Povy was generally known by the name of Totty. She was elderly, very  stout, with a round red face, the tint of which was due to health and not  drink, as she seldom imbibed anything stronger than tea. Totty was addicted to  a kind of regulation uniform, consisting of a black dress, a huge white apron,  and a muslin cap, set coquettishly on the side of her elderly head. She was one  of those quaint old motherly creatures who never offend, no matter what they  say, and she frequently lectured Calliston on the irregularity of his life,  which that noble lord accepted with an amused laugh.</p>
  <p>The  late Mr. Povy had long since departed this life, and having been what is  vulgarly known as a warm man, had left Totty comfortably off, so that lady  occupied her present position more from choice than necessity. She had a gruff  voice, and her casual remarks had the sound of positive commands, which she  found of great use with refractory servants.</p>
  <p>Totty  learned from the papers that Lord Calliston had gone off to the Azores with  Lady Balscombe, and expressed her disapproval of his action in the most  emphatic manner to Mrs. Swizzle (a friend of her youth) as they sat over their  four-o&rsquo;clock tea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said Totty, fixing her eyes pensively on the little black tea-pot, &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t no  good being a reformatory. The way I&rsquo;ve talked to him about his goings-on and  now look at his goings-off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  he couldn&rsquo;t help himself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Swizzle, who was tall and thin, and spoke  in a kind of subdued whistle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  never tried to, I&rsquo;ll be bound,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Povy, wrathfully. &ldquo;Not as he&rsquo;s  always bin after married pussons, for I know there is a gal as he pays for her  board and lodging.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;,&rdquo;  whistled Mrs. Swizzle, curiously. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  you mind,&rdquo; returned Totty, screwing up her mouth. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a gal as no decent  woman &lsquo;ud speak to her&mdash;silks and satings and wasting of money&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;ve no  patience with &lsquo;em! Kettles is snow in whiteness with gals&rsquo; morals now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment there came a ring at the door, and Totty hurrying away to attend to  it, Mrs. Swizzle made the best use of her time by eating up the buttered toast  as rapidly as she could.</p>
  <p>When  Mrs. Povy opened the door she was confronted by a lank figure in gray, which  was none other than Dowker, come to prosecute his inquiries concerning Miss  Sarschine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  inquired Totty, gruffly, annoyed at being disturbed, &ldquo;and what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  gazed on the substantial figure before him and sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  few words with you about Lord Calliston,&rdquo; he said, softly.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Povy shook with wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ain&rsquo;t no spy or gossip,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And if that is what you want to find out,  this ain&rsquo;t the shop&mdash;so walk, out,&rdquo; and she prepared to shut the door. But  Dowker was too sharp for her, and placed his foot inside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, my good lady,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean any harm to Lord  Calliston, and what I want to speak to you about is important.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Curiosity  got the better of Totty&rsquo;s wrath, so after a time she consented to speak to  Dowker privately, and to this end led him upstairs to Calliston&rsquo;s rooms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  quiet here,&rdquo; she said, closing the door. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ask you into my own room, as  a perticler friend of mine is drinking tea with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  will do capitally,&rdquo; replied Dowker, glancing round the room. &ldquo;And now, as my  curiosity may appear rude and you may refuse to answer some of my questions, I  may as well tell you who I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who are you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Povy, uneasily; &ldquo;a noospaper or a politics?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dowker&mdash;detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Povy&rsquo;s naturally red face became white.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  up?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Has Lord Calliston bin doing anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; replied Dowker, soothingly. &ldquo;I only want to obtain some information about  Miss Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know that kind of pusson,&rdquo; said Totty, angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind if you know her or not,&rdquo; retorted Dowker, sternly, &ldquo;but answer my  questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Povy sniffed and would have refused, but there was something in the detective&rsquo;s  eye which quelled her, so she yielded an ungracious assent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  did Lord Calliston leave town for his yacht?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  a week ago&mdash;on Monday last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was his yacht lying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  Shoreham. He went to London Bridge Station to catch the ten minutes past nine  train. His yotsh was to leave next morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he go alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  far as I know,&rdquo; retorted Totty. &ldquo;If Lady Balscome went with him you can see it  in the papers. I know no more than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  often did Miss Sarschine call on Monday,?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once,  in the afternoon, to see Lord Calliston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he was out; so she said she&rsquo;d call again in the evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but Lord Calliston had gone about eight o&rsquo;clock to catch his train. I suppose  she thought he wouldn&rsquo;t go till next morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she know he was going to elope with Lady Balscombe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she see any one when she came the second time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Desmond, my lord&rsquo;s cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  time was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  twelve, between eleven and twelve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  pondered a little. So she called here to see Calliston just before she was  murdered, and saw Desmond. Now the question was, what had Desmond to do with  the affair?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  Mr. Desmond here on that evening by accident?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He told me he had come to give Miss Sarschine a message from Lord Calliston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did not overhear their conversation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo;  growled Totty, indignantly. &ldquo;I never listen; but when she was leaving they were  having a row.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think at ten minutes after twelve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she go out alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Mr. Desmond followed shortly afterward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he say anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not a word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dowker  felt puzzled. It was evident Desmond had given her a message from Calliston  that made her angry, and she left the house in a rage, but then this did not  connect any one with a design to murder her. Suddenly he remembered that  Ellersby had mentioned that he had met Desmond coming up St. James&rsquo;s Street a  short time before the body was found. Was it possible that he had killed Miss  Sarschine and was then coming away from the scene of his crime? Impossible,  because the doctor said the woman must have been dead some hours. And yet he  might have killed her and gone down St. James&rsquo;s Street to avert suspicion, and  then come up again when he thought the coast would be clear. Unfortunately, he  had met Ellersby and then&mdash;well, Dowker made up his mind he would go and see  Ellersby, find out what he could about the meeting, and afterward call on Myles  Desmond. He, perhaps, might give some satisfactory explanation of his interview  with Miss Sarschine, and account for his presence after the interview. If he  did not, well, it would appear suspicious.</p>
  <p>While  these thoughts were rapidly passing through his mind, Totty had her eyes  fastened eagerly on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  now I&rsquo;ve answered all your questions,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell me what  it all means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Povy became quite excited, for she had a keen relish for horrors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;!  Who&rsquo;s dead&mdash;not Lord Calliston?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Miss Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Sarschine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  She was murdered shortly after she left these rooms and after her interview  with Mr. Desmond.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he is innocent, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Povy, eagerly. &ldquo;What on earth should he  want to kill her for? Besides, he&rsquo;s in love with Miss Penfold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  and she, I understand, was going to marry Lord Calliston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;d ever have married him,&rdquo; said Totty, disbelievingly; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s  that fond of Mr. Desmond as never was. Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  attend to business,&rdquo; replied Dowker; &ldquo;and by the way, where does Mr. Desmond  live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ain&rsquo;t going to arrest him for this murder?&rdquo; shrieked Totty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  &mdash; no &mdash; there&rsquo;s no evidence,&rdquo; retorted Dowker, lightly. &ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Primrose  Crescent, in Bloomsbury,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Povy.</p>
  <p>The  detective took the address and went down-stairs, followed by Mrs. Povy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t think Mr. Desmond did it, sir?&rdquo; began Totty, &ldquo;for a more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think anything,&rdquo; said Dowker, putting on his hat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear soon  enough what is done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he hurried away Mrs. Povy shut the door and returned to her room, where she  implored Mrs. Swizzle to mix her a glass of brandy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  &lsquo;ad such a turn,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;as never was. Oh, it&rsquo;s a blessing Povy died  afore he saw his wife mixed up with them nasty police.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_VI"></a>Chapter VI<br>
    A Successful Experiment</b></h2>
  <p>DOWKER  walked along Piccadilly, thinking deeply about the curious aspect the case was  now assuming. As far as he could make out, Myles Desmond was the last person  who saw Miss Sarschine alive, and he having gone out a few minutes after the  interview, it seemed as though he had followed her. The only thing to be done  was to see Ellersby, and as he was stopping at the Guelph Hotel Dowker went  along in that direction. He followed the same path as he surmised the dead  woman must have taken, but what puzzled him was the reason she had for going  into Jermyn Street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  she found out Calliston had gone off with Lady Balscombe,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;the  most obvious course would be for her to go home, but she evidently did not  intend to do so. I wonder if she walked or took a cab? Walked, I suppose. Let  me see, it was a foggy night and she got lost, that is the explanation,. But  then this man or woman she met; it must have been a friend, as she would hardly  have stopped talking to a stranger, unless indeed she asked the way. Lord,&rdquo;  ejaculated Mr. Dowker, suddenly stopping short, &ldquo;fancy if this murder turns out  to be the work of some tramp; but no, that&rsquo;s bosh; tramps wouldn&rsquo;t use a  poisoned dagger&mdash;unless they took the one she carried. Hang it! it&rsquo;s the most  perplexing case I was ever in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had by this time arrived at the Guelph Hotel and sent up his card to Mr.  Ellersby. The waiter soon returned with the information that Mr. Ellersby was  in and would see him, so he went upstairs and was shown into a sitting-room. At  one end near the window sat Spencer Ellersby in a comfortable arm-chair smoking  a pipe and reading a French novel. A remarkably unpromising-looking bulldog lay  at his feet and arose with an ominous growl as Dowker entered the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lie  down, Pickles,&rdquo; said Ellersby to this amiable animal, who obeyed the command in  a sulky manner. &ldquo;Well, Mr. Dowker, what do you want to see me about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  case, sir,&rdquo; said Dowker, taking a seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  of course,&rdquo; replied Ellersby, shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;I guessed as much. I  thought I&rsquo;d be done with the whole affair at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  far as it then went, sir,&rdquo; said the detective, quickly; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve found out a  lot since that time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  indeed! The name of the assassin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet, sir&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do that later on&mdash;but the name of the victim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?  and it is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lena  Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  heard of her. Who is she, what is she, and where does she live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was Lord Calliston&rsquo;s mistress,&rdquo; replied Dowker. &ldquo;I think that answers all the  other questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum!  A cottage in St. John&rsquo;s Wood&mdash;gilded vice, and all the rest of it. And what was  she doing in Jermyn Street that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, sir. That&rsquo;s one of the things I&rsquo;ve got to discover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what else have you found out, and how did you manage to acquire your  information?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was easy enough,&rdquo; said Dowker, confidentially. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just tell you all, sir,  for I want you to give me some information.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Delighted&mdash;if  I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  to the finding out, sir. The hat worn by the dead &lsquo;un had a ticket inside,  showing it was made by Madame Rene, of Regent Street. I went there, and found  out it had been sold to a woman called Lydia Fenny, of Cleopatra Villa, St.  John&rsquo;s Wood. I, thinking Lydia Fenny was the victim, went there and found that  she was alive, and had lent the hat to her mistress last Monday night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curious  thing for a maid to lend her mistress clothes,&rdquo; said Ellersby, smiling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  generally the reverse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think she did it for a disguise, sir,&rdquo; explained Dowker, &ldquo;because Miss  Sarschine went to Lord Calliston&rsquo;s chambers in Piccadilly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  get information concerning his elopement with Lady Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  deuce!&rdquo; said Ellersby, in astonishment. &ldquo;This is becoming interesting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be still more so before it&rsquo;s done. I found out from Lydia Fenny that Miss  Sarschine discovered her lover was about to elope with Lady Balscombe, so went  to his chambers to prevent it. She arrived too late, as Lord Calliston had gone  down to Shoreham by the ten minutes past nine train from London Bridge Station.  Instead of Lord Calliston she found Mr. Desmond, his cousin, and I suppose he  told her she was too late, for there was a row royal, and she left the chambers  at twelve o&rsquo;clock or thereabouts. Desmond followed shortly afterward, and that  was the last seen of her alive, as far as I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  Didn&rsquo;t Miss Sarschine return home when she discovered Calliston had gone off  with Lady Balscombe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you, sir; nor what took her to Jermyn Street, unless she got lost in  the fog, or there was another man in the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?  Nonsense! what other man could there have been?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Dowker, slowly, &ldquo;there was Mr. Desmond.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo;  said Ellersby, springing to his feet. &ldquo;What rubbish! I&rsquo;ve known Myles Desmond  all my life, and he&rsquo;s not the fellow to commit such a crime!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  I understand before you found the body you met Mr. Desmond coming up St. James&rsquo;s  Street?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spencer  Ellersby swung round in a rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confound  you!&rdquo; he said, in an angry tone, &ldquo;do you want me to give evidence implicating  my friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  did not lose his temper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but I want to know what took place between you on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply  nothing. He was in a hurry, and seemed annoyed at my stopping him, but that was  only natural on such a beastly night. I asked him to call on me here, and also  asked where Calliston was; he told me yachting, and then he went off. Nothing  more took place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Dowker, thoughtfully. &ldquo;It was curious he should have been there at the  time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see it at all. If you ask him, I&rsquo;ve no doubt he&rsquo;ll give you a good  account of himself. Besides, he had no motive in murdering Miss Sarschine; he  is in love with Miss Penfold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t say he deliberately murdered her,&rdquo; said Dowker, quietly, &ldquo;but there might  have been an accident. You see this?&rdquo; taking the Malay creese out of his pocket  and unwrapping the papers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  a dagger. Is that the&mdash;&rdquo; said Ellersby, recoiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but I shrewdly suspect it&rsquo;s the neighbor to it. Down at Cleopatra Villa there  were a lot of these sort of things hanging against the wall, arranged in a kind  of pattern. One side of the pattern was incomplete, and I found out from Miss  Fenny that Miss Sarschine had taken one of the daggers with a view to trying it  on Calliston if he did not give up his design of eloping. She was mad with rage  or she would never have thought of such an idea. Well&mdash; can not you guess what  follows? she has the dagger with her&mdash;doubtless shows it to Myles Desmond during  her stormy interview with him, and leaves the house in a rage. He follows her  to try and take such a dangerous weapon from her&mdash;meets her in Jermyn  Street&mdash;struggles to get it, and in the scuffle wounds herself; consequently she  dies, and Myles Desmond keeps quiet lest he should be accused of murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seems  possible enough,&rdquo; said Ellersby, resuming his seat, &ldquo;but I doubt its truth.  However, the only thing to be done is to see Desmond, and find out what took  place at Calliston&rsquo;s rooms. But tell me, what are you going to do with that  other dagger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to find out if it&rsquo;s poisoned,&rdquo; said Dowker, handling it gingerly. &ldquo;If it  is, it will show that the other weapon was the one with which the crime was  committed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you allow me to look at it?&rdquo; said Ellersby, stretching out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  replied the detective, and rising to his feet, he walked across to Ellersby to  give him the dagger. Unluckily, however, just as he was handing it to him he  stepped on Pickles, who with a growl of rage made a bite at his leg. In the  sudden start Dowker let go the dagger, which fell upon Pickles&rsquo; back,  inflicting a slight wound.</p>
  <p>The  detective gave a yell as the bulldog gripped him, but Ellersby pulled Pickles  off, and Dowker, hobbling to a chair, sat down to nurse his wounded leg. It was  not much hurt, however, as Pickles had got a mouthful of trousers instead of  flesh.</p>
  <p>Alarmed  as Dowker had been by the accident, he was not more alarmed than Ellersby, who  sprung to his feet with an oath and rang the bell sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn  it!&rdquo; he said, furiously, &ldquo;if that dagger is poisoned the dog will die! How  could you be such a fool?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  be the same, sir, if a devil of a dog bit you,&rdquo; said Dowker, sulkily, not at  all displeased at having the question of the dagger tested at once. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very  sorry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry  be hanged!&rdquo; said Ellersby, savagely. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t lose that dog for a hundred  pounds. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; to the waiter that entered, &ldquo;send for a doctor at once&mdash; don&rsquo;t  lose time, confound you!&rdquo; at which the astonished waiter vanished promptly.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  all this time Pickles was lying down trying to lick his wound, and evidently  wondering what all the fuss was about. Dowker watched him intently, and in a  short time saw the dog was becoming drowsy. Ellersby picked up the dagger and  was about to hurl it furiously back to Dowker, when the detective jumped up in  alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I believe it is poisoned&mdash;look!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ellersby  looked, and saw Pickles trying to rise to his feet. He evidently knew something  was wrong with him, for he commenced to whine, and a glaze came over his eyes.  His master knelt down beside him and dried the blood off the wound with his  handkerchief, but it was too late. The dog opened his jaws once or twice, tried  to rise to his feet, staggered, and fell over on his side, to all appearances  dead. On seeing this, Ellersby jumped to his feet and began to rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  devil take you and your case!&rdquo; he said, furiously; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve killed my dog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  very sorry, sir,&rdquo; said Dowker, crossing and picking up the dagger; &ldquo;it was an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  expensive accident for me,&rdquo; said Ellersby, bitterly; &ldquo;at all events it proves  the dagger was poisoned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Dowker, in a delighted tone, &ldquo;so the crime must have been committed with  the other weapon, for if one was poisoned, it&rsquo;s only common sense to assume the  other was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had apparently quite forgotten the loss sustained by Ellersby, for there was no  doubt the bulldog was quite dead.</p>
  <p>That  gentleman looked at him in disgust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  go to the devil,&rdquo; he said, irritably, &ldquo;and thank your stars I don&rsquo;t make you  pay for this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  murmured something about an accident, then, slipping the fatal dagger, once  more covered in paper, into his pocket, he took his departure. On his way down  he met the doctor coming up, and once outside, he was beside himself with joy  at having proved the creese to be poisonous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call and see Mr. Desmond.&rdquo;</p>

    A Literary Aspirant</b></h2>
  <p>PRIMROSE  CRESCENT lies just off Tottenham Court Road, and though a short distance away  the great thoroughfare is full of noise and bustle, everything is comparatively  silent in this crescent. Milk-carts are the most frequent vehicles, and  occasionally a rakish-looking hansom makes its appearance, while ragged  mendicants sometimes pay the neighborhood a visit, and troll out lively ditties  in gin-cracked voices. The organ-grinder is not an unknown personage either,  and his infernal machine may frequently be heard playing the latest music-hall  melodies as he glances round in search of the humble brown.</p>
  <p>The  houses are somewhat dismal; tall&mdash;very tall, built of dull-hued red brick, with  staring windows and little iron balconies, meant for show, not use. No  Bloomsbury Juliet can lean over the ornamental iron-work and whisper sweet  nothings to Romeo; if she did, Juliet would forthwith be precipitated into the  basement, where dwells the servant of the house in company with the domestic  cat, and the love-scene would end within the prosaic walls of a hospital</p>
  <p>There  are a good many boarding-houses to be found in Primrose Crescent, where city  clerks, literary aspirants, and coming actors are to be found. A touch of  bohemianism pervades the whole street, and perhaps in the future, neat tablets  let into the walls of the houses will inform posterity that Horatio Muggins,  the celebrated poet, and Simon Memphison, the famous actor, resided there. But  fame is as yet far from the quiet street, and the dwellers therein are still  struggling upward or downward as their inclinations may lead them.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Mulgy was the landlady of one of these boardinghouses, and by dint of hard work  and incessant watchfulness managed to keep the wolf from the door; but, alas!  the wolf was never far off, and it took all Mrs. Mulgy&rsquo;s time to keep him at  his distance. The basement of her mansion was devoted to the kitchen, the  presiding deity of which was a pale, thin-looking servant, with a hungry eye  and a deprecating manner, who answered to the name of Rondalina, which sounded  well and cost nothing. She used to ascend from the kitchen like a ghost from  the tomb, wander about the house to minister to the wants of the boarders, and  then return to the grave, or rather the kitchen, once more. A rising musician  occupied the ground-floor, who went to bed very early in the morning, and got  up very late in the afternoon. He was writing an opera which was to make his  name, but meantime devoted his spare moments to instructing small children in  the art of music, which tried his temper greatly, and rendered him morose. On  the first-floor dwelt Mr. Myles Desmond, whose occupation was that of a  journalist, and, being good-looking, smartly dressed, and well connected, was  Mrs. Mulgy&rsquo;s trump-card in the way of lodgers. Above was the habitation of a  maiden lady, by name Miss Jostler, who called herself an artist, and painted fire-screens,  Christmas cards and such like things with conventional landscapes and flowers.  In the attics lived several young men who, having no money and plenty of  spirits, formed quite a little colony of bohemians, being principally concerned  with theatrical and literary life.</p>
  <p>It  was a queer place altogether, and the individuals were a kind of happy family,  except that they did not mix much with one another, but they all paid their  bills comparatively regular, and so Mrs. Mulgy was content.</p>
  <p>It  was to this place that Mr. Dowker took his way the day after his interview with  Ellersby. As he had seen Mme. Rene, Lydia Fenny, Mrs. Povy, and Mr. Ellersby  all in one day, and obtained valuable information from each, he thought he  would defer his call on Mr. Desmond, and spent the night in arranging all the  evidence he had acquired during the day. The result was very satisfactory to  himself, and he wended his steps toward Mr. Desmond&rsquo;s abode in a very happy  frame of mind.</p>
  <p>It  was about eleven o&rsquo;clock, and Myles Desmond sat in his sitting-room scribbling  an article for a society journal, called &ldquo;Asmodeus,&rdquo; published for the express  purpose of unroofing people&rsquo;s houses, and exposing to the world their private  life. Not that Desmond did such a thing, he would have scorned to violate the  sanctity of private life, but he wrote for all kinds of magazines and papers,  and as &ldquo;Asmodeus&rdquo; paid well, he now and then wrote them a smart essay on  existing evils, or a cynical social story.</p>
  <p>He  was a tall young man, with reddish hair and mustache, a clever, intellectual  face, perhaps not actually good-looking, but a face that attracted attention,  and when he chose to exert himself, he could talk excellently on the current  topics of the day. His breakfast lay on the table, untouched, he having only  swallowed a cup of coffee, and then pushed the table-cloth aside to make room  for his papers. Dressed in an old smoking suit, he leaned one elbow on the  table occasionally, ran his fingers through his hair and wrote rapidly, only  stopping every now and then to relight his pipe. He was engaged in writing an  essay on &ldquo;Cakes and Ale,&rdquo; and satirizing the vices of a new school of  novelists, who, in their desire to become pure and wholesome, had gone to the  other extreme and taken all the masculine vigor out of their productions.</p>
  <p>Myles  looked worn and haggard, as if he had been up all night, and every now and then  his swift pen would stop as he pondered over some thought. There was a ring at  the bell below, but he took no notice. This was followed shortly afterward by a  knock at the door, and Rondalina glided in, saying a gentleman wished to see  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Show  him in,&rdquo; said Myles, not looking up. &ldquo;Wonder who it can be,&rdquo; he muttered, as  Rondalina went out. &ldquo;Hang those fellows, they won&rsquo;t even let me have the morning  to myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  the door opened he glanced up and saw that the new-comer was not a friend, but  a tall, gray man whom he did not know. Myles paused with his pen in his hand,  and waited for his visitor to speak, looking at him interrogatively meanwhile.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Dowker&mdash;for of course it was he&mdash;closed the door carefully, and advancing to the  table, introduced himself in two words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dowker&mdash;detective!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If  Myles looked haggard before, he looked still more so now. His face grew pale,  and he shot an inquiring glance at his visitor, who stood looking, mournfully  at him.</p>
  <p>Then,  throwing down his pen in an irritable manner, he arose to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Mr. Dowker?&rdquo; he said, a little nervously. &ldquo;You want to see me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do&mdash;very particularly,&rdquo; replied Dowker, coolly taking a seat, &ldquo;and believe you  can guess what it&rsquo;s about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Myles  drew his brows together and shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Jermyn Street murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Myles  gave a kind of gasp, and turned away toward the mantel-piece, ostensibly to  fill his pipe, but in reality to conceal his agitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  he said, in an unsteady voice, and what have I to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I want to know,&rdquo; said Dowker, imperturbably.</p>
  <p>Myles  Desmond glanced keenly at him, lighted his pipe, resumed his seat at the table,  and leaning his elbows thereon, stared coolly at the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  speak in riddles,&rdquo; he said, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  answered Dowker, meaningly, &ldquo;perhaps you can guess them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  till you explain them more fully,&rdquo; retorted Desmond.</p>
  <p>It  was evidently a duel between the two men, and they both felt it to be so.  Dowker wanted to find out something which Desmond knew, and Desmond on his side  was equally determined to hold his tongue. The cleverest man would win in the  end, so Dowker began the battle at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  woman who was murdered was your cousin&rsquo;s mistress, Lena Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;  said Desmond, with a start of surprise. &ldquo;May I ask how you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is not the point,&rdquo; retorted Dowker, quickly. &ldquo;I have satisfied myself as to the  identity of the murdered woman&mdash;you were the last preson who saw her alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  at Lord Calliston&rsquo;s chambers, between eleven and twelve o&rsquo;clock on Monday  night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  says I saw her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Povy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Myles  Desmond&rsquo;s lip curled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to have obtained all your information beforehand,&rdquo; he said, with a sneer; &ldquo;perhaps  you&rsquo;ll tell me what you want to know from me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First&mdash;did  you see Miss Sarschine on Monday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I did, but in the afternoon, not at night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Mrs. Povy said she called on you there, on Monday night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Povy is mistaken; I did not see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see any one at that time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  my business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me,&rdquo; said Dowker, ironically, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s mine also. You had better answer my  questions or you may find yourself in an uncommonly awkward fix.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  so you mean to accuse me of Lena Sarschine&rsquo;s murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends,&rdquo; replied Dowker, ambiguously. &ldquo;Tell me what you did on Monday night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Myles  thought a moment, and seeing his perilous position resolved to answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went to the Frivolity Theater, then to the office of the newspaper, &lsquo;Hash,&rsquo; and  afterward&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went along to Lord Calliston&rsquo;s rooms, about half past ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought so. And why did you go there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to commit a crime,&rdquo; retorted Desmond, coolly, &ldquo;but only to arrange some papers  for my cousin&mdash;he had gone down to Shoreham by the ten minutes past nine train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see him off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how did you know he went?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he said he was going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  Lady Balscombe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing about that,&rdquo; said Desmond, coldly, &ldquo;he went&mdash;as far as I know&mdash;by  himself. I was at his chambers to arrange his papers, and after I had done so I  left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  no one call while you were there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  reluctantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  a woman,&rdquo; evasively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Sarschine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;No,  it was not Miss Sarschine, that I can swear to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  who was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one having anything to do with this case&mdash;a friend of my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must know the name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  refuse to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Both  men looked steadily at one another, and then Dowker changed the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you quarrel with your friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is my business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  and what time did your friend leave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shortly  after twelve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Went  a few minutes afterward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  came home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  a time&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you go in the meantime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  refuse to answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I can tell you&mdash;down St. James&rsquo;s Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Myles  Desmond uttered an oath, and asked sharply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  told you that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one; but Mr. Ellersby met you coming up shortly after two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I did meet him there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you not go straight home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Desmond  seemed to be trying to think of something&mdash;at last with an effort he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was afraid my friend might get lost in the fog, and followed her down St. James&rsquo;s  Street, then I lost sight of her, and after a time came up St. James&rsquo;s Street,  where I met Ellersby. I did not see my friend again, so I came home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did not see your friend after she left Lord Calliston&rsquo;s chambers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I did not!&rdquo; said Desmond, with a sudden flush.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a lie,&rdquo; thought Dowker, eying him sharply, then he said out aloud:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have answered all my questions except the most important ones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have answered all I intend to answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you refuse to give me the name of the woman whom you saw on Monday night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Povy is certain it was Miss Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I said before, Mrs. Povy is mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know I can arrest you on suspicion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no grounds to go upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were the person who last saw the deceased alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me. I deny that I saw the deceased at all on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Povy can prove it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let Mrs. Povy do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  grew angry&mdash;the self-possession and coolness of this young man annoyed him&mdash;so he  resolved for the present to temporize.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well, Mr. Desmond, I suppose you can give a good account of yourself on that  night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  to the proper authorities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo;  said Dowker, and walked out of the room. When he got into the street he  strolled along a little way, thinking deeply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confound  him! He knows something,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and refuses to tell. I won&rsquo;t  lose sight of him, so I must get that little devil, Flip, to look after him. I&rsquo;ll  look him up now, and start him at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just  as he was about to put this resolve into execution he saw the door of the house  he had just left open, and the servant came out with a piece of paper in her  hand, which the keen-eyed detective saw was a telegraph form.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo;  said Dowser, to himself. &ldquo;I wonder if Desmond&rsquo;s sending that. I&rsquo;ll just find  out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rondalina  went along to the little post-office at the end of the street, and turned in.  Shortly afterward, Dowker followed, and, going to the counter, took a telegraph  form as if to send a telegram. The girl was attending to some one else, and  Rondalina, with the telegram opened out before her, was waiting her turn. Dowker  dexterously leaned across her to get a pen, and glanced rapidly at the  telegram, which he read in a moment:</p>
  <p class="telegram">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;PENFOLD,<br>
  &ldquo;&#8453; Balscombe, Park Lane,<br>
  &ldquo;Meet me Marble Arch three o&rsquo;clock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;MYLES.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  sent a fictitious telegram, and then strolled leisurely out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo;  he said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the girl he wants to marry. I wonder what are  his reasons for seeing her to-day. I&rsquo;d like to overhear their conversation. Can&rsquo;t  go myself, as he knows me, so Flip will be the very person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Dowker departed to find Flip.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_VIII"></a>Chapter VIII<br>
    A Juvenile Detective</b></h2>
  <p>FLIP  was a small dried-up-looking boy, born and brought up in a London slum. He had no  parents&mdash;at least, none that he could remember, and had he been asked how he  came into existence, he would probably have answered Topsy-like that he &ldquo;growed.&rdquo;  His mother and father had both deserted him at an early age, giving him nothing  to remember them by, not even a name, so he was thrown on the world a squalling  brat. Nevertheless, he managed to get along somehow to the age of fifteen, at  which period of his life Dowker chanced on him, and his prospects began to  improve.</p>
  <p>Dowker,  underneath his drab exterior, concealed a kind heart, and, having met Flip one  night in the rain, had taken compassion on the miserable morsel of humanity,  and given him a cup of coffee to warm him and a roll of bread to satisfy his  hunger. Flip was so touched at this disinterested kindness that he attached  himself with doglike fidelity to the detective, and tried to serve him to the  best of his small ability.</p>
  <p>Having  had to fight his way in the world, Flip had developed a wonderful sharpness of  intellect at a very early age, and Dowker turned this hunger-educated instinct  to good account, for he often set the little urchin to follow cabs, run messages,  and do other small matters which he required. Flip performed all these duties  so well and promptly that Dowker began to take an interest in him, and set to  work to cultivate this stunted flower which had sprung up amid the evil weeds  of the slums. He had a meeting place appointed with Flip in Drury Lane, and,  whenever he wanted him, went there to seek him out. Flip listened to his patron&rsquo;s  instructions carefully, and, having a wonderfully tenacious memory of an  uncivilized kind, he never forgot what he was told. In return for services  rendered, Dowker gave him a shilling a week, and on this small sum Flip managed  to exist, with occasional help from casual passers-by.</p>
  <p>Dowker  did not give him an education or dress him in decent clothes, as he thought this  would spoil his instinct and appearance, both of which were essentially useful  in their own particular way, so Flip remained ragged and ignorant; but it was  his patron&rsquo;s intention to give him a chance of rising in the world when he grew  older.</p>
  <p>He  had no name except Flip, and the origin of that was a mystery&mdash;no clothes except  a pair of baggy trousers and a tattered shirt&mdash;and his home was a noisome den in  the purlieus of Drury Lane. His language was bad, so was his conduct; yet this  small scrap of neglected humanity had in him the makings of a useful member of  society. There are many such in London, but the Christians of England prefer to  help the savages who don&rsquo;t want them to the savages who do. The Chickaboo  Indians have existed for centuries without morals, religion, or clothes, and  can very well exist for a longer period while the ragged denizens of the most  civilized city in the world are being relieved.</p>
  <p>Every  one in London knows Drury Lane, that quaint, dirty narrow street leading to the  Strand. The very name conjures up the shades of Siddons and Garrick, and the  neighborhood is sacred to the Dramatic Muse. Who has not seen that  weather-stained picturesque house from the window of which gossipy old Pepys  saw Mistress Nell Gwynne leaning out and watching the milkmaids go down to the  Strand Maypole for the pleasant old English dance. But, alas! Nell and the  milkmaids with their quaint chronicler have long since passed into the outer  darkness&mdash; even the Maypole has become but a memory, yet the grim tumble-down  house still remains in the dirty lane.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tis  a far cry from Charles to Victoria, and the merry milkmaids with their clinking  pails have given place to frowsy old women, battered-looking young ones, and a  ragged mixture of men and boys. Not an unpicturesque scene, this  dilapidated-looking crowd, slouching over the rugged stones, and an artist  would have stopped and admired them, but Dowker was not an artist, so looked  not for scenic effect, but for Flip.</p>
  <p>Flip  was sitting considering at the edge of the pavement with his feet, for the sake  of coolness, in the gutter, and his eyes fixed on three dirty pennies lying in  his own dirty brown palm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Am,&rdquo;  said Flip, deliberating over the expenditure of his fortune. &ldquo; &lsquo;Am an&rsquo; bread,  an&rsquo; a swig o&rsquo; beer&mdash;my h&rsquo;eye, wot a tuck h&rsquo;out I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave. &lsquo;Ere,&rdquo; suddenly, as  Dowker touched him with his foot, &ldquo;what the blazes are you kicking? Why I&rsquo;m  blest if &lsquo;taint the guv&rsquo;nor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  jumped to his feet, and slipped the pennies into the waistband of his trousers,  which did duty with him for a pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s  h&rsquo;up, guv&rsquo;nor?&rdquo; he asked with a leer. Flip&rsquo;s leer was not pleasant&mdash;it had such  an unholy appearance, &ldquo;more larks&mdash;my h&rsquo;eye, I thort I&rsquo;d never twig you agin. &lsquo;Ave  you bin h&rsquo;over the gardin-wall arter a prig?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  your tongue,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Dowker, sharply. &ldquo;I want you to do something for me&mdash;are you  hungry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much,&rdquo; said Flip, coolly, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t mind a &lsquo;am san&rsquo;wich.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  cast a sharp glance at the ragged little figure walking beside him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  have you been getting money?&rdquo; he asked</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  h&rsquo;eye, it&rsquo;s a rigler game,&rdquo; said Flip, rubbing his grimy hands together, as  they turned into a ham and beef shop, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell yer all&mdash;&rdquo;am I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave, an&rsquo;  bread.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Being  supplied with these luxuries at the expense of Dowker, Flip stuffed his mouth  with a liberal portion and then began to talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Larst  Monday,&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo;  said Dowker, suddenly recollecting the date of the murder, &ldquo;yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  the Monday afore,&rdquo; said Flip, &ldquo;it were at nite, h&rsquo;awful foggy, my h&rsquo;eye, a  rigler corker it were. I was as &lsquo;ungry as a bloomin&rsquo; tyke an&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t find you  nohow, so h&rsquo;up I goes to Soho to see h&rsquo;old Jem Mux, you know&rsquo;s &lsquo;im, guv&rsquo;nor,  the cove as keeps the Pink &lsquo;Un.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Same  game,&rdquo; said Flip, &ldquo;e gives me sumat to eat when I arsks it, so I goes h&rsquo;up to  cadge some wictuals; I gits cold meat, my h&rsquo;eye, prime, an&rsquo; bread an&rsquo; beer, so  when I &lsquo;ad copped the grub, I was a-gitten&rsquo; away h&rsquo;out of the bar when a swell  cove comes in&mdash;lor&rsquo; what a swell&mdash;fur coat an&rsquo; a shiny &lsquo;at. Ses &lsquo;e to the gal,  ses &lsquo;e, &lsquo;Is that &lsquo;ere sparrin&rsquo; comin&rsquo; orf this evenin&rsquo;?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;in  the drorin&rsquo;-room.&rsquo; &lsquo;Right you h&rsquo;are,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;e, &lsquo;I want to see it afore I leave  Hengland. I was a-goin&rsquo; down to my yotsh,&rsquo; ses &lsquo;e, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll put it orf till  to-morrow as I wants to see this set-to,&rsquo; then &lsquo;e twigs me an&rsquo; ses &lsquo;e, &lsquo;Are you  cold?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses I.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ungry?&rsquo; &lsquo;Not much,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo; &lsquo;Ere&rsquo;s some tin for you,  you pore little devil,&rsquo; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m blessed if &lsquo;e didn&rsquo;t tip me a sov, so I&rsquo;ve bin  livin&rsquo; like a dook on it since I sawr you&mdash;nice game, ain&rsquo;t it, guv&rsquo;nor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>During  this recital Dowker had not paid much attention till Flip spoke of the yacht,  then he suddenly pricked up his ears, for it dawned on him that this unknown  benefactor of Flip&rsquo;s might possibly be Lord Calliston.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monday  night he was going out of town,&rdquo; murmured Dowker, &ldquo;but he was always a sporting  blade, so perhaps he stopped for this fight and then went down next morning. I  wonder where he met Lady Balscombe. Ah, well, it&rsquo;s nothing to do with the  murder at all events; but I&rsquo;d like to know if he really did leave town on the  night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  he turned to Flip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  the swell see Jem Mux?&rdquo; he asked, sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo;  said Flip; &ldquo;an&rsquo; Jem &lsquo;e called &lsquo;im my lord, so &lsquo;e must &lsquo;ave been a blooming  blinding toff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  lord,&rdquo; repeated Dowker, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Oh! no doubt it was Lord Calliston. I  wonder if he&rsquo;s had anything to do with the death of his mistress; it&rsquo;s curious  if he stopped in town all night that he didn&rsquo;t go back to his chambers. About  what time was this?&rdquo; he asked, aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  nine,&rdquo; said Flip, promptly, &ldquo;or harf parst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nine,&rdquo;  echoed Dowker; &ldquo;then in that case he must have stayed in town all night, as the  last train to Shoreham is about half past. I&rsquo;ll look into this business, but  meantime I want to find out Desmond&rsquo;s little game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Flip  had now finished his meal and was waiting impatiently for instructions from his  chief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s  h&rsquo;up, guv&rsquo;nor?&rdquo; he asked, his black beady eyes fixed on the detective.</p>
  <p>Dowker  glanced at his watch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  about two,&rdquo; he said, replacing it, &ldquo;and I want you to meet me at the Marble  Arch about a quarter to three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot  for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  follow a lady and gentleman and overhear what they say,&rdquo; said Dowker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  show you whom I mean. Don&rsquo;t lose a word of their conversation, and then repeat  it all to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  fly,&rdquo; said Flip, with a wink, and then this curiously assorted pair departed,  Dowker to his office for a few minutes, and Flip to wend his way to the  rendezvous at the Marble Arch.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_IX"></a>Chapter IX <br>
    The Language Of Love</b></h2>
  <p>MAY  PENFOLD was a very pretty girl, tall and fairhaired, with a pair of merry blue  eyes, and a charming complexion. Her parents died when she was young and left  her to the guardianship of Sir Rupert Balscombe, who certainly fulfilled his  trust admirably. He had her well educated both intellectually and physically,  so when she made her <i>d&eacute;but</i> in London  society she was much admired. An accomplished musician and linguist, a daring  horsewoman and a kindly disposition, it was no wonder that she was much sought  after; but when, added to these gifts, it was also discovered that she possessed  twenty thousand a year in her own right, she became the catch of the season,  and many were the attempts made by hard-up scions of noble houses to secure her  hand in marriage.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>But  alas, for the contrary disposition of womankind, she would have none of the  gilded youth but fixed her affections on Myles Desmond, a poor Irish gentleman,  with nothing to recommend him but a handsome face, a clever brain, and a witty  tongue. In vain Lord Calliston asked her to be his wife; she coolly refused  him, telling the astonished nobleman that neither his morals nor his manners  were to her liking, and informed Sir Rupert that she intended to marry Myles  Desmond.</p>
  <p>The  baronet was furious at this declaration, and as May was under age and could not  marry without her guardian&rsquo;s consent, he forbade Myles the house, and ordered  his ward not to speak to him. But see how the duplicity of love can circumvent  the watchfulness of guardians. May and Myles met secretly in the park, at  garden-parties, and at balls, whenever they chose, and so cleverly did they  manage their meetings that Sir Rupert never for a moment suspected the truth.  He wanted his ward to marry Calliston, but when that fickle young man ran off  with Lady Balscombe he changed his tone altogether, and had May been clever  enough to have taken advantage of his dismay, he would doubtless have consented  to her union with Myles despite the disadvantages of the match. Sir Rupert was  paralyzed at the scandal caused by his wife&rsquo;s elopement.</p>
  <p>He  was deeply in love with her, and having known Calliston from his boyhood, it  had never entered his head that such a thing could happen. He was a very proud  man, and when he discovered the elopement he shut himself up in his library,  refusing to see any one. The guilty pair had gone to the Azores, and knowing  that sooner or later they would return to England, he awaited their coming with  the intention of divorcing his treacherous wife and punishing her seducer.</p>
  <p>Sir  Rupert having taken up this position, May was left a good deal to herself, and  as the whole affair caused such a scandal she, as a ward of Balscombe, refused  to go out into society until some definite settlement of the matter had been  arrived at. She had written several times to Myles asking him to see her, but  on some plea or another he had always refused to come, much to her  bewilderment. When she received his telegram asking her to meet him at the  Marble Arch, she was delighted; and slipping out of the house in Park Lane,  went to keep her appointment.</p>
  <p>At  this time of the year there were comparatively few people in town who knew her;  nevertheless, for the sake of safety, she dressed herself plainly in a dark  dress and wore a thick veil which concealed her face. Thus disguised she had no  fear of being recognized, and arrived at the rendezvous about five minutes past  three o&rsquo;clock. There she found Myles waiting for her, and they walked together  into the park, feeling perfectly secure from interruption or detection. But  they did not know that they were being shadowed by a small ragged boy who was  apparently playing idly about them.</p>
  <p>Dowker  recognizing Myles pointed him out to Flip and departed at once, lest he should  be seen by Desmond; so when Flip saw May join the young Irishman he knew it was  the couple whose conversation he was there to overhear, and followed them  promptly.</p>
  <p>Myles  and Miss Penfold walked a short distance into the park and then seated  themselves for awhile&mdash;two ordinary-looking figures not calculated to attract  much notice, for, the day being cold, Myles was muffled up in a large ulster,  and May&rsquo;s dress, as previously noticed, was not conspicuous.</p>
  <p>Flip  sat down on the grass at the back of them, apparently engaged in spelling out a  dirty bit of newspaper, but in reality drinking in every word the lovers  uttered.</p>
  <p>They  were continuing a conversation begun when they first met.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  this man suspect you?&rdquo; said May, evidently referring to Dowker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid so,&rdquo; he replied, gloomily, &ldquo;and I can not open my mouth to defend  myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  my only defense would be an explanation of the events of that night, and I can  not explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  remained silent, at which the girl turned pale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there any reason&mdash;strong reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that reason&mdash;a woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Myles  bowed his head.</p>
  <p>Miss  Penfold grew a shade paler and laughed bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A pleasent  reason to give me,&rdquo; she said, with a sneer. &ldquo;I have given up all else for your  sake, because I thought you loved me, and you&mdash;you&mdash;talk of another woman to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is nonsense,&rdquo; he answered, impatiently. &ldquo;There is no love in the case; it  simply involves the breaking of a promise given to a woman, and you would be  the last to ask me to do that. Can you not believe in my honor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I believe in any man&rsquo;s honor?&rdquo; she replied, sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends who the man is,&rdquo; answered Myles, quietly. &ldquo;It is simply a case of  Lovelace over again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  would not love thee dear so much,<br>
    Loved I not honor more.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It  is absurd&mdash;quixotic&mdash;ridiculous&mdash;to talk about honor in these days, I grant you,  but unfortunately I inherit loyal blood, and&mdash;well, I must ask you to trust me  till I can speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you will speak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  if it comes to the worst,&rdquo; he replied, with a slight shiver.</p>
  <p>The  girl gave him her hand, which he took and pressed slightly. So thus, mutely,  they made up their quarrel.</p>
  <p>All  the foregoing conversation about honor was Greek to Flip, who, after some  cogitation, came to the conclusion it was a scene out of a play. But now they  began to talk on a subject more suited to his comprehension.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May,&rdquo;  said Myles, &ldquo;I want you to tell me all that Lady Balscombe did on&mdash;on that  night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  night when she eloped?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me see,&rdquo; said May, knitting her pretty brows, &ldquo;we went to a ball&mdash;to Lady  Kerstoke&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Between  nine and ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what time did you leave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  early&mdash;about half past ten; in fact, we were there only a few minutes. Lady  Balscombe said she had a headache and went home. You know our house is only a  few doors away. I expect she only went there to avert suspicion as to her  elopement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  happened when she came home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was a woman waiting to see her in her boudoir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  woman?&rdquo; repeated Desmond; &ldquo;who was she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know; I didn&rsquo;t even see her. She saw Lady Balscombe and then left the  house, between eleven and twelve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  maid told me,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what time did Lady Balscombe leave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. I did not see her again that night. She went to bed because of her  headache, and, I suppose, departed early in the morning to catch the train to  Shoreham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was Sir Rupert all this time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had been down in Berkshire, but arrived some time before twelve&mdash;he and Lady  Balscombe had quarreled lately and occupied different rooms. Besides, he went  off to his club on arriving in town, so he would not know of her flight till  the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she leave a letter for him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose  so; but why do you ask all these questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I want to save my neck, if possible. The woman who was murdered is said to be  Lena Sarschine, whom I saw during the day. I saw a woman in Calliston&rsquo;s rooms  on the same night, whom the detective thinks was the same person. Now, between  the time I left the chambers and the time I met Spencer Ellersby, I was  wandering about the streets, and, as I spoke to no one, I can not prove an <i>alibi</i>. Ellersby met me coming up St.  James&rsquo;s Street, and the scene of the crime was not far off, so, if I am  arrested, circumstances will tell very hard against me. Nobody will believe my  assertion that I did not see the dead woman that night, and I can not prove it  without breaking my promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see what you mean; but what has Lady Balscombe to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply  this: I am anxious to find out if Calliston really left town on that night,  because I want to know if he had anything to do with the death of his mistress.  He left his chambers to catch the ten minutes past nine train from London  Bridge; but did he catch it? I think not, because he would not have left town  without Lady Balscombe, and from your own showing, she did not leave her house  till early on Tuesday morning. So I think Calliston must have remained in town  at some hotel, where she joined him, and they went down to Shoreham by the  first train in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you don&rsquo;t think Calliston killed this woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; he answered, thoughtfully. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think so, but I  would like to have all his movements on that night accounted for. As for  myself, I am in a very awkward position, for, if arrested, I can not extricate  myself from it till Calliston returns.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  till his yacht comes back I can not prove my innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you are innocent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  can you doubt me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was certain of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope the jury of twelve good and lawful men will be as certain,&rdquo; he replied,  grimly, as they walked away.</p>
  <p>Flip  followed them at a distance, but only caught scraps of conversation which seemed  to him to be about trivial matters. So, with all the conversation he had heard  in the park indelibly inscribed on his brain, Flip darted away, to give his  patron an accurate report and thus add another link to the chain which was  gradually encircling the murderer of Lena Sarschine.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_X"></a>Chapter X<br>
    The Missing Link</b></h2>
  <p>FLIP,  having a wonderfully tenacious memory, did not forget the conversation he had  overheard between Myles and Miss Penfold; so going to his patron&rsquo;s office, he  repeated it in due course to Dowker. The result was that the detective became  much exercised in his mind over the whole affair. He could not understand  Desmond&rsquo;s refusal to tell the name of the woman he saw on the night of the murder.  True, Desmond denied it was Lena Sarschine, but then his denial went for  nothing, as he would do so to save himself from suspicion. Mrs. Povy said Lena  Sarschine had been there between eleven and twelve, and it was unlikely she  would be wrong, seeing how well acquainted she was with the appearance of the  dead woman. But then, judging from the drift of Desmond&rsquo;s remarks, his refusal  to speak was dictated by a desire to screen the honor of a woman. If so, it  could not have been Lena Sarschine, for she had no honor to lose, and his  refusal to speak would be a piece of quixotism, which he, as a man of the  world, would be one of the first to recognize. At this moment, a sudden thought  flashed across Dowker&rsquo;s mind&mdash;could it have been Lady Balscombe herself who had  the interview with Desmond? Here, indeed, would be a strong motive for Desmond  to keep silence, as the visit of a lady to a bachelor&rsquo;s rooms at night would  endanger her reputation. Lady Balscombe had, it is true, flung reputation to  the winds, but on Monday night it would not have been too late to save her, so  if she had seen Desmond, he might have tried to persuade her to give up the  elopement, and failed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I see it all,&rdquo; said Dowker, musingly. &ldquo;She was to have met Lord Calliston  on that night to go down by the nine train, but went to the ball first to avoid  suspicion. He got tired of waiting for her, and went off to The Pink &lsquo;Un. She  would have let him know her plans by telegram, and called at his rooms after  the ball to explain. He was away and did not get the telegram, so when she  arrived at the rooms she found Desmond. He tried to persuade her to go back;  she refuses, and after some angry words goes out in a rage, stays all night  somewhere, and goes down to Shoreham in the morning, but all this does not  explain Lena Sarschine&rsquo;s death. It can&rsquo;t be possible that Lady Balscombe killed  her&mdash;no, it can&rsquo;t be that&mdash;there is no connection between the two,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  ran over in his mind the principal items of the conversation as reported by  Flip, and his thoughts took a new turn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Balscombe did not leave her house in Park Lane till after midnight, so that  would not have given her time to be at Lord Calliston&rsquo;s chambers and have an  interview with Desmond, therefore it can not have been her. I wish I could find  out the name of the woman who saw Desmond, and I&rsquo;d also like to know the name  of the woman who saw Lady Balscombe on that night, and discover what was the  exact time Lady Balscombe left the house&mdash;let me see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  took out his note-book, and wrote the following memoranda:</p>
  <p>1. To  find out name of woman who called at Calliston&rsquo;s chambers on Monday (night of  murder) between eleven and twelve.</p>
  <p>This  could only be proved by Myles Desmond himself, as Mrs. Povy asserted it was  Lena Sarschine, and Desmond denied it; therefore there was a  deadlock&mdash;affirmation and denial.</p>
  <p>Memo.&mdash;To  see Desmond and find out name of visitor.</p>
  <p>2. To  ascertain appearance, and, if possible, name of woman who visited Lady  Balscombe on night of murder, as it might possibly have some bearing on case.</p>
  <p>A  servant in Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s house could probably furnish this information.</p>
  <p>Memo.&mdash;To  try and find out said servant.</p>
  <p>3. To  discover exact time Lady Balscombe left her house on Tuesday morning, also  ascertain subsequent movements. This would also have to be discovered through a  servant&mdash;as to finding out subsequent movements, discover, if possible, train  she left London by, and what she did between time of leaving her house and  leaving by train.</p>
  <p>Memo.&mdash;These  discoveries must be left to future developments of case.</p>
  <p>4. To  find out what has become of missing dagger.</p>
  <p>Possibly  this might be discovered in Desmond&rsquo;s possession.</p>
  <p>Memo.&mdash;Search  his room&mdash;secretly&mdash;employ agent&mdash;say Flip.</p>
  <p>5. To  search out early life of Lena Sarschine!</p>
  <p>Might  be discovered in a small measure from Lydia Fenny, who, being confidential  maid, might possibly have gathered information from casual remarks.</p>
  <p>Memo.&mdash;To  see Lydia Fenny.</p>
  <p>Having  thus arranged his plan of action satisfactorily, Dowker turned his attention to  Number Four of his memoranda, and proceeded to tell Flip what he wanted him to  do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see this?&rdquo; asked Dowker, showing Flip the dagger he had abstracted from  Cleopatra Villa.</p>
  <p>Flip  intimated by a vigorous nod of his head that he did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got an idea,&rdquo; explained Dowker, smoothly, &ldquo;that a dagger very similar to this  is to be found in the possession of Mr. Myles Desmond, the gentleman you saw  today, so I want you by some means to get into his rooms and find out if it&rsquo;s  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Flip  screwed his face into a look of profound thought, and then smiled in a  satisfied manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do it, guv&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; he said, sagaciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;  asked Dowker, curious to learn how this juvenile detective proposed to deal  with the problem.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  doss on his doorstep to-night,&rdquo; said Flip, &ldquo;and when he comes &lsquo;ome do a &lsquo;perish&rsquo;&mdash;you  knows&rdquo;&mdash;in an explanatory tone&mdash;&ldquo;say I&rsquo;m dyin&rsquo; for victuals&mdash;&rsquo;e&rsquo;ll take me inside,  and when I gits there you leave me alone, guv&rsquo;nor, I&rsquo;m fly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you can manage it as you please,&rdquo; said Dowker. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you prick yourself  with it, as it&rsquo;s poisoned; and, Flip, if you bring me this dagger without him  knowing about it, I&rsquo;ll give you half a sov.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Done,  guv&rsquo;nor!&rdquo; said Flip, joyfully, and bidding adieu to his patron, went off to get  something to eat and prepare his plan of action.</p>
  <p>It  was now about six o&rsquo;clock and very dark, the sky being overcast with clouds.  Soon it began to rain steadily, and the streets became sloppy and dismal. Flip  drew his rags round him, shivered a little in a professional manner, and then,  going off to a cook-shop he patronized in Drury Lane, had a hunch of bread and  a steaming cup of coffee for a small sum.</p>
  <p>Being  thus prepared for his work, Flip wiped his mouth, and, sallying forth into the  dirty lane, took his way up to Bloomsbury, combining business with pleasure by  begging on the road.</p>
  <p>Turning  into Primrose Crescent, he soon found the house he wanted, and curling himself  up on the doorstep, waited patiently for chance to deliver Myles into his  designing hands.</p>
  <p>The  rain continued to pour down steadily, and as it was now dark, Flip could see  the windows all along the street being lighted up. The gas-lamps also shone  brightly through the rain, and were reflected in dull, blurred splashes on the  pavements. Occasionally a gentleman would hurry past with his umbrella up, and  a ragged tramp would slouch along singing a dismal ditty. It was dreary  waiting, but Flip was used to such times, and sat quite contented, thinking how  he could lay out his promised half sovereign to the best advantage, till his  quick ear caught the sound of footsteps inside.</p>
  <p>This  was his cue, so he immediately lay down on the wet stones and commenced to moan  dismally. Myles opened the door, and would have stumbled over him, for he was  right in front of the entrance after the fashion of the clown in the pantomime,  only he caught sight of him in time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Halloo,&rdquo;  said Myles, crossly, &ldquo;what the deuce is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Flip  made no reply to this, but groaned with renewed vigor, upon which Desmond, who  was a kind-hearted man, bent down and touched the ragged little figure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you ill?&rdquo; he asked, gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lor&rsquo;&mdash;awful&mdash;my insides,&rdquo; groaned Flip, pressing his dirty hands on his stomach. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t  &lsquo;ad a bit for days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Myles  was doubtful as to the genuineness of this case as he knew how deceptive tramps  are, but as the poor lad did seem in pain, and it was raining heavily, he determined  to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you rise?&rdquo; he asked, sharply; &ldquo;if so get up and come inside. I&rsquo;ll give you  something to do you good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  many groans and asseverations of extreme pain Flip struggled to his feet, and  aided by Myles went inside, up the stairs, and was at last safely deposited on  the hearth-rug in front of the fire, where he lay and groaned with great  dramatic effect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  give you some hot port wine,&rdquo; said Myles, going to the sideboard and taking out  a glass and a bottle, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ll have to go down-stairs and get some hot  water&mdash;you wait here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Flip  groaned again and gyrated on the floor like a young eel; but when the door had  closed behind his benefactor, he sprung to his feet and took a survey of the  room.</p>
  <p>It  was a large and lofty apartment, with a pair of folding-doors on one side,  which, being half open, showed Flip that the other room was a bedroom.</p>
  <p>There  was a sideboard in the sitting-room and near this a writing-table, toward which  Flip darted and commenced to turn over the papers rapidly with the idea of  finding the dagger hidden underneath.</p>
  <p>Nothing  however rewarded his efforts, and though he looked into the sideboard, examined  the book-case and lifted up the covers of the chairs, he found no sign of the  weapon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  be in the bedroom,&rdquo; thought Flip, scratching his head in perplexity, and  wondering how he could get in, when suddenly it occurred to him that he had not  examined the mantel-piece.</p>
  <p>There  was not a moment to be lost, as Myles might return at any moment, so in a  second Flip scrambled up on a chair, and was eagerly looking among the  ornaments on the mantel-piece.</p>
  <p>There  was a mirror framed in tarnished gold, and in front of this a tawdry French  clock under a glass shade, two Dresden china figures simpering at one another,  and two tall green vases at each end. Flip saw nothing of what he wanted till  he peered into one of these vases, when he saw something looking like steel,  and drew forth a slender shining blade with no handle.</p>
  <p>Wonder  if this is what the guv&rsquo;nor wants,&rdquo; he said to him, turning it over gingerly, &ldquo;t  &lsquo;ain&rsquo;t got no &lsquo;andle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  thought for a moment, and then, as he had been so lucky with one vase looked  into the other, and found a cross handle&mdash;he joined the two and they fitted  perfectly. Being certain this was what Dowker wanted, he was thinking how he  could take it, when he heard Myles ascending the stairs. Jumping down he hid  the broken blade and the handle securely among his rags, being very careful not  to prick himself as he remembered Dowker&rsquo;s warning about the poison, then he  lay down on the hearth-rug again, and was groaning loudly when Myles entered  with the hot water.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Feeling  bad?&rdquo; asked Myles, sympathetically, pouring out some port wine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Awful,&rdquo;  groaned Flip, feeling not a bit of compunction at the treacherous part he was  playing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold I think&mdash;cold and &lsquo;unger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,  drink this,&rdquo; said Desmond, kneeling down beside him, and giving him the  steaming tumbler. &ldquo;It will do you good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,  guv&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; said Flip, gratefully, feeling if the broken blade was all safe, &ldquo;it &lsquo;ull  warm me up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Desmond  lighted his pipe and sat watching the ragged little Arab drinking the hot wine,  never thinking for a moment that he was nourishing a viper&mdash;a viper that would  turn and sting him. Honest himself, he never suspected wrong-doing in others,  and while succouring this outcast he did not know he was doing an evil thing  for himself.</p>
  <p>After  Flip had finished the wine he declared he felt better, and with many  asseverations of gratitude took leave of his benefactor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  little devil!&rdquo; said Desmond as he closed the door and saw the ragged little  urchin scudding away into the darkness, &ldquo;he seemed very bad&mdash;well I&rsquo;ve done one  good action, so perhaps it will bring me a reward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  did, and the reward was that next morning Myles Desmond, of Bloomsbury,  journalist, was arrested for the murder of Lena Sarschine.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_XI"></a>Chapter XI<br>
    Another Complication</b></h2>
  <p>THOUGH  he had arrested Myles Desmond, Dowker was by no means certain that he had got  hold of the right man. Judging from the conversation reported by Flip, Desmond  himself appeared to have strong suspicions about Calliston, and Dowker in his  own mind became convinced that there was some connection between the elopement  of Lady Balscombe and the murder of Lena Sarschine.</p>
  <p>He  wanted to find out the name of the woman who visited Lady Balscombe on the  night of the murder, for a sudden thought had presented itself that this  unknown visitor might have been Lena Sarschine. But the idea seemed absurd, for  a woman of such a character as Lord Calliston&rsquo;s mistress could hardly have the  audacity to visit Lady Balscombe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  yet,&rdquo; pondered Dowker, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;these two women both loved the same man,  and a free-lance like Lena Sarschine would not hesitate for a moment in  slanging any woman who took her man away&mdash;but why did not Lady Balscombe kick up  a row and order her to leave the house?&mdash;I&rsquo;m hanged if I can get to the bottom  of this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  length Dowker decided that the best thing to be done would be to find out from  some servant of the Balscombe household all that took place subsequent to Lady  Balscombe&rsquo;s departure. First, however, he decided on seeing Lydia Fenny and  finding out if Lena Sarschine had let fall any hint of calling on her rival.</p>
  <p>Lydia  Fenny received the detective eagerly, as she evidently loved her mistress and  wanted to do all in her power to further the ends of justice. As there was no  time to be lost, Dowker plunged at once into the subject matter of his visit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  Miss Sarschine state on the night of &nbsp;her  murder where she was going?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Lydia, &ldquo;as I told you before she said she was going to Lord Calliston&rsquo;s  rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nowhere  else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  she did not make any remark that would lead you to believe she was going to  Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Balscombe&rsquo;s!&rdquo; echoed Lydia, in astonishment, &ldquo;why what would she want to do  there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, but I think she was there on that night,&rdquo; and Dowker detailed to  Lydia the conversation overheard by Flip, at the conclusion of which she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose you want to find out from the servants if Miss Sarschine was there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  do you know any of the servants?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One&mdash;Lady  Balscombe&rsquo;s maid&mdash;Anne Lifford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Dowker; in a satisfied tone. &ldquo;Can you ask her to come along here and see  you? I can find out all I want to know from her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dare say I can get her to come here to-day, as her mistress being away she can  not be busy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;  replied the detective, &ldquo;send for her at once. I will wait here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; said Lydia, and was leaving the room when Dowker called her back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  you let me see your mistress&rsquo;s private desk?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo; demanded Lydia, rather taken aback.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I want to look over her papers; from them I can gather her past life, and find  out if any one had a motive in killing her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Lydia, after a pause, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think then that Mr. Desmond is guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can I tell?&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;as far as I can see he had no motive, and one does  not commit murder for sport&mdash;but come, show me her desk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydia  looked at him doubtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know if I ought to let you see her private papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  laughed in a subdued manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; he said, lightly, &ldquo;she is dead, and we want to find out who killed  her&mdash;looking at her papers can not do any harm and may save the life of an  innocent man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydia  Fenny hesitated no longer, but leading the detective to the end of the drawing-room  showed him a recess wherein was placed a very handsome desk of the ordinary  office character. Dowker tried some of the drawers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Locked,&rdquo;  he said, quietly. &ldquo;Have you the keys?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  she had them with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  made up his mind to commit a burglary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bring  me a-chisel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  once,&rdquo; replied Lydia Fenny, going, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll also send for Anne Lifford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  left the room, and Dowker sitting down in front of the desk examined it  carefully. It was one of those table desks with a knee-hole in the center and a  row of drawers on each side. At the back were a number of pigeon holes  containing papers, and these Dowker examined, but found nothing more than bills  and blank sheets of paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever  private papers she&rsquo;s had,&rdquo; said Dowker, on discovering this, &ldquo;are in these  drawers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydia  Fenny arrived with the chisel and a small hammer, both of which she handed to  Dowker, telling him at the same time she had sent for Anne Lifford. Dowker  nodded carelessly and began to force open the drawers.</p>
  <p>After  half an hour&rsquo;s hard work this was the result of his labors:</p>
  <p>First,  a bundle of old letters addressed to &ldquo;Miss Helena Dicksfall, Post Office,  Folkestone,&rdquo; signed F. Carrill.</p>
  <p>Second,  a photograph of a handsome white-haired old man, on the back of which  photograph was written, &ldquo;Your loving father, Michael Dicksfall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Third,  a photograph of Lena Sarschine, taken in a white dress with a tennis racket in  her hand.</p>
  <p>Dowker  examined the photographs carefully, and then coolly read all the letters, of  which there were about ten. After doing this, he turned to Lydia Fenny who had  been watching him all the time, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can read a whole story in this: the name of your mistress was not Lena  Sarschine, but Helena Dicksfall&mdash;she lived at Folkestone with her father,  Captain Michael Dicksfall, and a lady she calls Amelia, whom I take to be her  sister. Lord Galliston went down to Folkestone, saw her and fell in love&mdash;all  these letters show how he conducted his intrigue, which he did under the name  of Frank Carrill. He loved Miss Dicksfall but did not wish to marry her; at  last he persuaded her to run away with him, and at last she did so. Ashamed of  her position, she changed her name to Lena Sarschine so as to conceal her  identity. The portrait of the old gentleman is that of her father, Captain  Michael Dicksfall, and this one is herself.&rdquo; Lydia Fenny listened in silent  amazement to the way in which he had pieced the story together, and then taking  the portraits in her hand she looked at them long and earnestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, at length, laying down the photographs with a sigh. &ldquo;It is Miss  Sarschine, but it must have been taken some time ago, for I never saw her in  that dress, and I have been with her for about a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  was about to make a reply when the door opened and a woman entered. Tall, thin,  with a pale face, dark hair, and an aggressive manner, dressed in a green  dress, and bonnet to match.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  observed Lydia, on seeing her, &ldquo;is this you, Anne?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  looked sharply at the new comer, whom he now knew to be Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s maid,  and she returned his gaze with a look of suspicion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  sir,&rdquo; she said, at length, in a rather harsh voice, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll know me  again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  laughed, and Lydia hastened to introduce him to Miss Lifford, who, being an  extremely self-possessed young person, took the introduction very calmly,  though she manifested some surprise when she heard Mr. Dowker&rsquo;s calling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  gentleman,&rdquo; said Lydia, when they were all seated, &ldquo;wants to ask you a few  questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  for what?&rdquo; asked Miss Lifford, indignantly, &ldquo;my character I hope being above  policemen&rsquo;s prying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not a policeman,&rdquo; explained Dowker, smoothly, &ldquo;but a detective, and I want to  know all that took place on the night your mistress eloped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are,  your employed by Sir Rupert?&rdquo; asked Anne, grandly, &ldquo;because though I knows they  fought bitter, yet wild bulls won&rsquo;t drag anything out of me against my  mistress, she being a good one to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want you to say anything against your mistress,&rdquo; replied Dowker, mildly, &ldquo;but  I am investigating this case of murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;  echoed Miss Lifford, in a scared tone, &ldquo;who is murdered&mdash;not Lady Balscombe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Lydia, bursting into tears, &ldquo;but my poor mistress, Miss Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  person of no repute,&rdquo; sniffed Anne, coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  her alone,&rdquo; said Lydia, passionately. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead, poor soul, and even if she  was not married, she was better than Lady Balscombe, carrying on with Lord  Calliston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  indeed, miss,&rdquo; said Anne, rising indignantly. &ldquo;This is a plot, is it, to mix up  Lady Balscombe with your mistress? I won&rsquo;t have anything to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  caught her wrist as she arose, and forced her back into her chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  answer what I want to know,&rdquo; he said, sternly, &ldquo;or it will be the worse for  yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Upon  this Miss Lifford began to weep; and demanded if she was a slave or a British  female, to be thus badgered and assaulted by a policeman. At last, after some  difficulty, Dowker succeeded in making her understand that what he wanted to  know was not detrimental to her mistress, upon which she said she would tell  him what he required. So Dowker produced his note-book and prepared to take  down Miss Lifford&rsquo;s evidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo;  asked Dowker, &ldquo;do you remember the night when Lady Balscombe eloped?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  being a born fool, I do,&rdquo; retorted Miss Lifford, sharply. &ldquo;Such goings-on I  never saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you tell me all that took place on that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Lifford sniffed thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was a ball they was going to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  were going to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Balscombe and Miss Penfold. They did go, and left shortly before ten, but  before I had time to turn round, they were back again, as Lady Balscombe said  she had a headache.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  so I suppose she went to bed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you suppose wrong,&rdquo; retorted Anne, triumphantly, &ldquo;for there was a pusson  waiting to see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  lady?&rdquo; asked Dowker, eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; retorted Miss Lifford, sharply. &ldquo;She had a veil on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you describe her dress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Lifford thought a moment, while Lydia bent forward anxiously to hear her  answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  hat trimmed with blue and brown velvet, and a sealskin jacket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydia  Fenny sunk back in her seat with a groan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my poor mistress!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  mistress!&rdquo; echoed Miss Lifford, turning sharply. &ldquo;It could not have been Miss  Sarschine who called on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I&rsquo;m certain it was,&rdquo; said Dowker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  impertinence!&rdquo; muttered the virtuous Anne.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind,&rdquo; said Dowker, sharply, &ldquo;go on with your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Lifford sniffed indignantly and resumed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Balscombe returned at half past ten and went up to her dressing-room, where  this&mdash;this lady was waiting for her. Miss Penfold went to bed. I don&rsquo;t know how  long the lady was with my mistress, as I was told that my mistress would not  require me again that night; but I waited about in case I should be wanted, and  saw the lady leave the house shortly after eleven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Sarschine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;at  least, the lady in the sealskin jacket, and you say it was Miss Sarschine, so I  suppose it was. I then went to Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s room, but found the door  locked, so as I thought she had gone to bed I went downstairs to get my supper.  When I came upstairs again about twelve, the door was still locked, so I went  to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Balscombe could not have gone out in the meantime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  because I asked the footman if any one had gone out or come in, and he said no  one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  could not have gone out without attracting the notice of the servants, I  suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  they would have recognized her at once. I think she waited till every one was  in bed and then went off to meet Lord Calliston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you are sure she did not leave till after twelve?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  swear it anywhere,&rdquo; returned Miss Lifford impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case,&rdquo; muttered Dowker, &ldquo;it could not have been Lady Balscombe who saw Mr.  Desmond at Lord Calliston&rsquo;s chambers, so it must have been Lena Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you want to know anything more?&rdquo; asked Miss Lifford, icily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Tell me, what was Lady Balscombe like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Lifford laughed contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You ought to, as she was one of the beauties of  the season. Her portrait was all over the place. Why,&rdquo; catching sight of the  photograph on the study-table, &ldquo;you have one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  handed her the photograph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you say that is Lady Balscombe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  certainly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nonsense!&rdquo; said Lydia, &ldquo;why, that is Miss Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never saw Miss Sarschine,&rdquo; retorted Miss Lifford, &ldquo;but I know that&rsquo;s Lady  Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never saw Lady Balscombe,&rdquo; replied Lydia, angrily, &ldquo;but I know that&rsquo;s Miss  Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  looked from one to the other, and then slipped the photograph into his pocket  along with the letters and the other photograph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  only one way of settling this,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call on the  photographer and ask him who it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  gave Anne Lifford some money, and then left the house wrapped in thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is a new complication,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;this resemblance&mdash;they must be very  like one another if their maids mix them up like this&mdash;and then Lena Sarschine  calling on Lady Balscombe, I wonder if there can be any relationship between  them&mdash;not likely&mdash;a lady of title, and a woman of light character&mdash;well,&rdquo; finished  up Dowker, philosophically, &ldquo;I think the best thing for me to do is to discover  as much about Lena Sarschine&rsquo;s previous life as possible, and to do this, I&rsquo;ll  run down to Folkestone, and look up Captain Michael Dicksfall.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_XII"></a>Chapter XII<br>
    Family History</b></h2>
  <p>MR.  DOWKER was not a man to let grass grow under his feet, so he went straight to  the photographer whose name was on the back of the portrait found in Lena  Sarschine&rsquo;s possession, and ascertained without much difficulty that it was  that of Lady Balscombe.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  what the deuce was that portrait doing in her desk?&rdquo; he muttered, as he left  the gallery, &ldquo;and why should Lydia Fenny mistake it for her mistress? I wish I  could get a picture of Miss Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  he could not manage this, for, according to Lydia Fenny, Miss Sarschine would  never consent to have her portrait taken, so that he had no means of learning  if there was such a wonderful resemblance between the two women, except by  personal description, which was not by any means satisfactory.</p>
  <p>Under  these circumstances there was only one thing to be done&mdash;see Captain Dicksfall,  the father of Lena&mdash;so putting a few things together Dowker caught the afternoon  train to Folkestone from Charing Cross.</p>
  <p>Dowker  duly arrived at Folkestone and took up his abode in an hotel in the Sandigate  Road, where he ordered himself a pleasant little dinner and made the  acquaintance of a fatherly old waiter who knew every one and everything.</p>
  <p>Barbers  have the credit of being most notorious gossips, videlicet Figaro, and the  barber in &ldquo;The Arabian Nights,&rdquo; but, as a matter of fact, they are not worse  than waiters, who generally hear everything that&rsquo;s going on in their locality,  and, being of a garrulous nature, do not keep their knowledge to themselves.</p>
  <p>This  waiter at the Prince&rsquo;s Hotel rejoiced in the name of Martin, and, hovering  about Dowker, armed with a napkin and a pint bottle of Heidsieck, managed to  satisfy that gentleman&rsquo;s curiosity concerning the existence of Captain Michael  Dicksfall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir&mdash;know him well, sir&mdash;by sight, sir,&rdquo; he said, brimming the empty glass with  champagne. &ldquo;H&rsquo;old gentleman, sir&mdash;bin in the army&mdash;&rsquo;ad two daughters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  daughters?&rdquo; repeated Dowker, eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir&mdash;Miss Amelia and Miss Helena, sir&mdash;twins&mdash;as fine-looking gals as you ever  saw, sir&mdash;tall, &lsquo;andsome, and golden &lsquo;air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  indeed!&rdquo; replied Dowker, indifferently. &ldquo;And are they living with Captain  Dicksfall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir,&rdquo; said Martin, gravely. &ldquo;You see, sir, Miss Helena fell in love with a gent  who was stopping at the Pavilion, sir, and went off with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was his name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  know, sir. He called himself Carrill, but they do say it was not his right  name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  pondered a little over this. It was as he had thought after reading the  letters. Lord Calliston had masqueraded at Folkestone under the name of  Carrill, and had inveigled Helena Dicksfall away from home, and kept her in St  John&rsquo;s Wood as &ldquo;Lena Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the other young lady,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;Miss Amelia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she made a good match, sir,&rdquo; replied Martin. &ldquo;Married Sir Rupert Balscombe,  sir, about a year ago. But I did &lsquo;ear, sir, as &lsquo;ow she &lsquo;ad bolted last week,  sir, with Lord Calliston&mdash;same blood, sir; it will come out,&rdquo; and Martin  departed to attend upon an important customer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Same  blood,&rdquo; repeated Dowker, musingly. &ldquo;I wonder if he knows it&rsquo;s the same man?  Calliston evidently had a <i>penchant</i> for the family, for there seems to be no doubt that Miss Sarschine and Lady  Balscombe were sisters. So he kept one and made love to the other! Queer&mdash;deuced  queer! Well, I think I had better look up Captain Dicksfall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  finished his wine, and putting on his hat, went out into the cool evening and  strolled leisurely along the Leas, first having taken the precaution of putting  Dicksfall&rsquo;s address in his pocket.</p>
  <p>There  were a great number of people on the Leas, and that pleasant promenade was  crowded with youth, beauty, and fashion. Charming girls in charming dresses,  well-dressed men, happy-looking boys, and here and there a shaky-looking  invalid, formed the greater part of the assembly, so that Dowker found a good  deal of amusement in watching the passers-by. The lift was hard at work  lowering people to the beach below or taking them up to the higher level, and  the pier was full of gayly dressed idlers, who looked like pygmies from the  heights above. Very pleasant and amusing to an unoccupied man, but Dowker being  down on business, and not pleasure, turned away from the pleasant scene and  went up past Harvey&rsquo;s statue toward the heart of the new town.</p>
  <p>He  had no difficulty in finding Captain Dicksfall&rsquo;s cottage, which was a comfortable-looking  place with a small garden in front. A neat maid-servant admitted him into a  dusky passage, and from thence showed him into a small drawing-room, at the end  of which, near the window, Captain Dicksfall lay on a sofa, looking out on to  the quiet street. A haggard, pale face, worn by suffering, but which had once  been handsome. He lay supinely on the sofa in an attitude of utter lassitude,  covered by a heavy rug, and his slender white hands were toying with a book  which was lying on his lap.</p>
  <p>He  turned fretfully when Dowker entered, and spoke in the querulous voice of an  invalid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it, my good man?&rdquo; he said, peevishly. &ldquo;Why do you come and disturb me at  this hour? My doctor has ordered complete rest, and how can I get it if you  trouble me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Selfish  old chap,&rdquo; thought Dowker, but without saying a word he took his seat near the  invalid and commenced to talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry to trouble you, sir,&rdquo; he said, respectfully, &ldquo;but I wanted to see you  about your daughters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  daughters!&rdquo; echoed Captain Dicksfall, angrily. &ldquo;You are making a mistake, I  have only one&mdash;Lady Balscombe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  felt disappointed. Only one daughter! If so, Lena Sarschine could be no  relation of Lady Balscombe, and his theory about the possible motive for the  committal of the Piccadilly crime would fall to the ground. But then the name,  Helena Dicksfall&mdash;the portrait of the old gentleman before him. It must be true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understood you had two daughters, sir, Lady Balscombe and Miss Helena  Dicksfall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  the devil are you to intrude yourself into my private affairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  came at once promptly to the point.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  name is Dowker. I am a detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Captain  Dicksfall struck his hand angrily down on the pillow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sent  by Sir Rupert, I presume?&rdquo; he said, with a sneer. &ldquo;He wants to get a divorce,  and you have come to me for evidence. I know nothing&mdash;my daughter was always a  good daughter to me, and if Sir Rupert had treated her well, this elopement  with Lord Calliston would never have taken place. He is to blame&mdash;not she.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not come from Sir Rupert,&rdquo; said Dowker, coldly, &ldquo;but from Scotland Yard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  death of your other daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Captain  Dicksfall started up with a groan, and stared wildly at Dowker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  God! Is Helena dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Helena?&rdquo; asked Dowker, stolidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  daughter&mdash;my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you said you&rsquo;d only one, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sick man turned away his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had two,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone, &ldquo;but one, the eldest, ran away with some  scamp called Carrill. Since then I have heard nothing of her, so I always say I  have only one.</p>
  <p>Dowker  thought for a few moments. It was a very delicate position to occupy, and,  feeling it to be so, for a moment he was doubtful as to how to proceed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain  Dicksfall,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;I know I am only a common man and you are a  gentleman; it is not for such as me to speak to you about your private affairs,  but this is a matter of life or death to a human being, and, if you hear my  story, I am sure you will not refuse to help me by telling me what I want to  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dicksfall  was looking at the detective with a somber fire burning in his unusually bright  eyes, then with a sigh he lay down and prepared to listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me what you wish,&rdquo; he said, languidly, &ldquo;and, if possible, I will do what you  require.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon,  Dowker told him the story of the Jermyn Street murder, the elopement of Lady  Balscombe, and the reasons he had for believing that the two incidents were  connected in some mysterious way. He also informed him of the arrest of Myles  Desmond, and of the doubts he entertained concerning his criminality.</p>
  <p>At  the conclusion, Dicksfall was silent for a minute, then turned toward the  detective, and clasped his thin fingers nervously together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a proud man,&rdquo; he said, with a touch of pathos, &ldquo;and do not care about  telling the world, my private affairs; but in a case like this I think it is  only right I should put myself aside for the sake of clearing the character of  an innocent man. What do you wish to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  Lena Sarschine your daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  answer Dicksfall pointed to a small table near at hand, upon which was a  morocco frame containing two portraits. Dowker took them to the window and  looked at them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both  of the same lady?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>Dicksfall  smiled faintly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not the first who has been deceived,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh. &ldquo;No! One is my  daughter Helena, who, from your story, I believe to be Lena Sarschine, and the  other is Amelia, Lady Balscombe&mdash;twins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  examined the photographs closely, and was astonished at the likeness, which was  further aided by both of them being dressed exactly alike.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is wonderful,&rdquo; he said, and no longer marveled at the way in which Lydia Fenny  and Anne Lifford had confused the identity of the portrait found in Lena  Sarschine&rsquo;s desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been living here for many years,&rdquo; said Dicksfall, in a low voice, &ldquo;and my  two daughters lived with me. Their mother has been dead a long time. About  three years ago, a young man, who called himself Carrill, came here and stopped  at the Pavilion Hotel. He obtained an introduction to me by some means, and  appeared to be struck with the beauty of Helena. I thought he was going to  marry her, when I heard rumors as to the fastness of his life, and also that he  was not what he represented himself to be. I taxed him with it, but he denied  the accusation, yet so transparent was his denial that I forbade him the house.  The result was that Helena ran away with him, and, until the time you spoke to  me of her and told me his real name, I did not know it, and never entertained  any suspicion as to his real rank in life. I was so angry that I forbade Helena&rsquo;s  name to be mentioned in my hearing, and always said, as I did to-night, that I  had only one daughter&mdash;my daughter Amelia, married to Sir Rupert Balscombe last  year, and I thought that she would, at least, not follow the example of her  sister. Now, however, I know all, but to tell you the truth, I blame Sir  Rupert; for her elopement, as I know she was a kind daughter, and I am sure she&rsquo;d  have made a good wife. He was very jealous of her, and had a fearful temper, so  I dare say he drove her to it. From what you say, I suppose my poor Helena,  went to see her sister on the night of the elopement to dissuade her from going  with Lord Calliston, and surely she had the best right to speak of one who had  ruined her own life, but evidently her arguments were of no avail, and she called  at Calliston&rsquo;s chambers to remonstrate with him. He was not there, and she went  out to her death, and then Amelia eloped with him, as you have told me. I was a  fast man in my youth, and the sins of the father are being visited on the  children.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this does not clear up the mystery of Lena Sarschine&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  call her by that name,&rdquo; said Dicksfall, angrily. &ldquo;It is the name that shames  her. No; you are right, it does not explain her death, but I do not know, from  what you say, what motive Myles Desmond could have had in murdering her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe he did,&rdquo; said Dowker, bluntly, &ldquo;but I want to find out your  daughter&rsquo;s past life. Had she any lovers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dicksfall  flushed a deep red.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was always a good daughter to me,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;but I believe she was  very much admired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know the name of any one who admired her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was clearly nothing more to be gained from Dicksfall, so Dowker respectfully  said good-bye and took his leave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  all events,&rdquo; he said to himself, as he wended his way back to his hotel, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  found out one thing&mdash;Lena Sarschine and Lady Balscombe were sisters, and both  loved the same man. What I&rsquo;d like to know is, whether Lady Balscombe killed her  sister out of jealousy. D&mdash;n it, I&rsquo;m getting more perplexed than ever. This  visit, instead of clearing up the mystery, deepens it. I think I&rsquo;ll see Sir  Rupert Balscombe and ask him about things; as his wife is mixed up in it, I&rsquo;ve  a right, and I&rsquo;d give anything to save that young fellow&rsquo;s life, because I&rsquo;m  sure he&rsquo;s innocent,&rdquo;</p>

    Myles Desmond Finds Friends</b></h2>
  <p>MYLES  DESMOND was not a particularly good young man, but good enough as young men of  the present generation go. He was a healthy, cheery, enough-for-the-day-is-the-evil-thereof  sort of fellow, and considered himself decidedly hardly treated at being  arrested on such a serious charge as that of the murder of Lena Sarschine.</p>
  <p>According  to the cynical creed prevailing nowadays all his friends should have turned  their backs on him now he was in trouble, but there is a wonderful lot of  undiscovered good even in friends, and none of them did. Instead of calling him  names and laughing at his misfortune, Desmond&rsquo;s friends took up his cause  warmly, and both in clubs and drawing-rooms he was heartily commiserated. Many  people, both in his own set and in the literary circle of which he had become a  member, had taken a liking to the bright, kindly young man, and emphatically  declared that the whole thing was a terrible mistake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Myles  Desmond a murderer!&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;why as soon say the Archbishop of Canterbury  is an atheist.&rdquo; So as certain grasses only give out perfume when crushed, Myles&rsquo;s  misfortune brought all his friends around to help him if need be.</p>
  <p>And  he sadly needed help, poor fellow, for his position was a very critical one,  the evidence against him being as follows:</p>
  <p>1. He  had last seen Lena Sarschine alive on the night of the murder.</p>
  <p>2. He  had been met in St. James&rsquo;s Street by Ellersby not far from the scene of the  crime.</p>
  <p>3. He  had in his possession the dagger with which the crime was, to all appearances,  committed.</p>
  <p>Myles  answered these accusations as follows:</p>
  <p>1. He  had not seen Lena Sarschine on that night, but another lady whose name he  refused to divulge.</p>
  <p>2. His  presence in St. James&rsquo;s Street on the night in question was purely accidental.</p>
  <p>3. And  the dagger found in the vase was one he had taken from Lena Sarschine on the  afternoon of the day she had called to see Calliston about the elopement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you all about that dagger,&rdquo; explained Myles to Norwood, his solicitor. &ldquo;I  was at Calliston&rsquo;s rooms on the Monday afternoon, looking over his papers, when  Lena Sarschine came in like a mad woman to see Calliston. I tried to quiet her,  but she refused to be pacified, and pulling out the dagger, said she would kill  Calliston first and Lady Balscombe afterward. I tried to take it from her, and  she flung it away&mdash;neither of us knew it was poisoned, or I don&rsquo;t think we would  have been so reckless over it. In falling, the dagger rested slantwise from the  floor to the fender, and in springing to get it I put my foot on it and broke  the handle off. In case she should get it again, I put the pieces in my pocket  and took them home&mdash;I left them on a side-table, so if they were found in the  ornaments some one must have placed them there&mdash;and Lena Sarschine went away on  that day, and since then I have seen nothing of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  who was the lady you saw on that night?&rdquo; asked his solicitor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not tell you,&rdquo; replied the young man, doggedly. &ldquo;I gave my word to the lady  I would not say she had been there till I had her permission, and till I get it  I can not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  will you get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  Calliston returns in his yacht.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  in that case,&rdquo; said Norwood, &ldquo;you must mean Lady Balscombe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Norwood, quickly, &ldquo;but you say your permission to speak must come from  a lady, and the only lady on board the yacht is Lady Balscombe, as she ran away  with Lord Calliston. Come, tell me, was it Lady Balscombe you saw on that  night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t answer you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  that Norwood could do could not get any other answer from the obstinate young  man, so in despair the lawyer left him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  impossible to perform miracles,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, as he went back to his  office, &ldquo;and if this young fool won&rsquo;t tell me the whole truth, I can not see  what I can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  arriving at his office he found a lady waiting to see him, and on glancing  carelessly at the card handed to him by his clerk, started violently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Penfold,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by Jove! she was engaged to Lord Calliston. Now I wonder  what she wants?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young lady made her appearance, and the door being closed, soon enlightened him  on that point.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are Mr. Desmond&rsquo;s lawyer?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have that honor,&rdquo; replied Norwood, rather puzzled to know what she had come  about.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  take a great interest in Mr. Desmond,&rdquo; said the girl, hesitating, &ldquo;in fact, I&rsquo;m  engaged to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I thought Lord Calliston&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  Calliston is nothing to me,&rdquo; she broke in, impatiently. &ldquo;I never did like him,  though my guardian wished me to marry him, and I love Myles Desmond, if I did  not I would not be here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  of course I feel sure he is innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Innocent!  I never had any doubt on the subject, but I want to know what chances there are  of proving his innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be a difficult matter,&rdquo; said Norwood, thoughtfully, &ldquo;as I can get him to  tell me nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it he refuses to tell you?&rdquo; asked Miss Penfold,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  name of the lady whom he saw at Lord Calliston&rsquo;s chambers on the night of the  murder. I believe myself it was Lady Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Balscombe!&rdquo; echoed May, in astonishment, &ldquo;why, what would take her there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  she went to meet Lord Calliston. The reason why I think it&rsquo;s she is that Mr.  Desmond says he promised the lady he saw that he would not speak without her  permission, and then he tells me he can not speak till Lord Calliston&rsquo;s yacht  comes back; and as Lady Balscombe is the only lady on board, it must be her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why should he refuse to tell you it was her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Norwood  shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it&rsquo;s hardly the thing for a lady to visit a chambers at that hour of the  night&mdash;her reputation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  reputation!&rdquo; repeated May Penfold, contemptuously, &ldquo;he need not try to save it  now, and considering she&rsquo;s thrown it away by eloping with Lord Calliston; but  what else is there in his favor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  principal thing is the dagger,&rdquo; said Norwood; &ldquo;he told me he took it from Lena  Sarschine and brought it home&mdash;so if his landlady or any one else put it away,  they must have seen it&mdash;and so it will show the truth of his story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  in order to find out it will be best to see his landlady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;but  I don&rsquo;t know where he lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do&mdash;Primrose Crescent, Bloomsbury. You go there and find out what you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  may as well try,&rdquo; said Norwood, thoughtfully, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a forlorn  hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forlorn  hopes generally succeed,&rdquo; replied May, with a confident smile. &ldquo;So you go to  his lodgings, and then let me know the result of your inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Norwood  agreed to this, and after Miss Penfold had departed called a cab and drove to  the address of Myles Desmond. Rondalina, more wan and ghost-like than ever,  opened the door and informed the lawyer that Mrs. Mulgy had gone out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a pity,&rdquo; said Norwood, in a disappointed tone. &ldquo;Are you the servant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; replied Rondalina, dropping a courtesy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you attend to all the lodgers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  then perhaps you can tell me what I want to know,&rdquo; said Norwood, cheerfully. &ldquo;Take  me up to Mr. Desmond&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rondalina,  being a London girl, was very sharp, and looked keenly at Mr. Norwood to see if  he had any design of burglary. The scrutiny proving satisfactory, she led him  upstairs, and showed him Desmond&rsquo;s sitting-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  then,&rdquo; said Norwood, taking a seat, &ldquo;I want you to answer me a few questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rondalina  looked frightened, and said, &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; in a mechanical manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo;  asked Norwood, &ldquo;do you dust this room and put things straight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you remember seeing a broken dagger about the place&mdash;a blade and a handle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rondalina  twisted her apron up into a knot and thought hard, then intimated she had seen  it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;and  when did you see it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  a week or so ago, sir,&rdquo; replied Rondalina. &ldquo;Mr. Desmond, sir, he comes in at  five o&rsquo;clock when I was a-layin&rsquo; of the cloth for dinner, and ses he &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t  a-goin&rsquo; to stay in for dinner, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; h&rsquo;out,&rsquo; then he takes the  knife from his pocket, being broken in two, and throws the bits on the table,  and goes out to put his clothes on. I takes the dinner things down-stairs, and  when I comes up he was gone, so I sets to work an&rsquo; tidies up the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the dagger still on the table?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  knife, sir,&rdquo; corrected Rondalina; &ldquo;yes, sir, it were, and I puts the bits in  the h&rsquo;ornaments so as to keep &lsquo;em out of the way of the children, an&rsquo; I &lsquo;ope  it weren&rsquo;t wrong, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not at all,&rdquo; replied. Norwood, &ldquo;but tell me, did Mr. Desmond come back on that  night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir&mdash;but not till late, sir&mdash;three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. He &lsquo;adn&rsquo;t his  latch-key, so I &lsquo;ad to git h&rsquo;up and let him in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  he sober?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite,  sir, only he seemed upset like, and goes up to his room without saying a word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was all the information obtainable from Rondalina, so Norwood departed from the  house very much satisfied with what he had discovered. He drove straight to  Park Lane and told May Penfold all Rondalina had said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; he said, in conclusion, &ldquo;this evidence will prove one thing&mdash;that Desmond  could not have committed the crime with that dagger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I suppose they&rsquo;ll say he did it with another,&rdquo; said May, bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  they do so they will damage their own case,&rdquo; replied Norwood, coolly, &ldquo;for  Dowker swears the crime was committed by this special dagger, and if Desmond  did not use it&mdash;as can be proved by the evidence of the servant&mdash;no one else  could have done so; by the way, you say Sir Rupert was down at Berkshire on  that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was,&rdquo; replied May, &ldquo;but he came up by a late train, and then went to his club  shortly before twelve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he in?&rdquo; asked the lawyer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but you will be able to see him about five o&rsquo; clock,&rdquo; said Miss Penfold, &ldquo;he  has been shut up in his library since the elopement of his wife, but had to go  out to-day on business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  call then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want to see him about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am anxious to ascertain if he knew his wife&rsquo;s movements on that night, and  whether she left the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think he can tell you that, as his wife and he were on bad terms and  occupied different rooms; besides, even if you find out that Lady Balscombe  visited Lord Calliston&rsquo;s chambers on that night, it won&rsquo;t save Myles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know so much about that,&rdquo; replied Norwood, cheerfully, &ldquo;it will help to  unravel this mystery, and when everything is made plain I&rsquo;m certain Myles  Desmond won&rsquo;t be the man to suffer for this crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_XIV"></a>Chapter XIV<br>
    My Lady&rsquo;s Husband</b></h2>
  <p>IN  the brilliant comedies of Wycherley, Moliere, Goldoni, and Lope de Vega the  betrayed husband is always made the scapegoat for the sins of the lovers, and  all the sympathies of the dramatists are with the pretty wife and the gay  deceiver. This was the case with poor Sir Rupert, for though his friends pitied  him heartily for the manner in which his wife had behaved, yet they also  laughed at him for the way in which he had allowed Calliston to carry on the  intrigue under his very nose. Sir Rupert thought Calliston&rsquo;s visits were to his  ward, but in reality she was merely used as a stalking-horse to conceal the  designs of the young man on Lady Balscombe. When the blow came and the lady  eloped, no one was surprised except the unsuspecting husband, who, having  raised his wife from an obscure position to a brilliant one, and given her all  she could wish for, never dreamed for a moment she would reward him in so base  a manner.</p>
  <p>Sir  Rupert, however, had no idea of playing the complacent husband in this case,  and at once proceeded to take steps for a divorce. The difficulty was to serve  the guilty pair with citations, for as the yacht had gone to the Azores there  was no chance of doing so until she returned to England, or until she touched  at some civilized port easy to be reached by the long arm of the law.</p>
  <p>The  baronet sat in his library reading a letter from his lawyers, who informed him  that Calliston&rsquo;s yacht, the &ldquo;Seamew,&rdquo; had put into a French port for repairs as  she had been disabled in a storm, and that they had sent over a clerk to serve  the citations at once. The intelligence seemed to afford Sir Rupert the  greatest pleasure, and he threw down the paper with a grim smile. He was a  tall, fine-looking man of forty-nine, with a soldierly carriage and iron-gray  hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  won&rsquo;t find life with Calliston so happy as she did with me,&rdquo; he muttered,  walking up and down the room. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not marry her after she is free, and then  she&rsquo;ll go from bad to worse. I was a fool to make her my wife; with the  instincts she&rsquo;s got she would have been just as satisfied with being my  mistress&mdash;come in,&rdquo; he said aloud, as a knock came to the door.</p>
  <p>It  opened and Miss Penfold entered, followed by Norwood, at the sight of whom Sir  Rupert seemed surprised, but said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  gentleman wishes to speak with you, Sir Rupert,&rdquo; said May, advancing toward the  baronet. &ldquo;He is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  lawyer, I know,&rdquo; replied Sir Rupert, coldly pushing a chair toward his ward, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  seen him in court&mdash;and what is the object of your visit, sir?&rdquo; he said, turning  to Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  called to see you about this arrest of Myles Desmond for the murder of Lena  Sarschine,&rdquo; says Norwood, placing his hat on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing about him,&rdquo; replied the baronet, looking angrily at May. &ldquo;Why do  you come to me for information?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  we want to save Mr. Desmond&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; said May, boldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  life&mdash;a murderer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is no murderer,&rdquo; said the young girl, quickly. &ldquo;Appearances are against him,  but he is innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you love the fellow still,&rdquo; said Balscombe, contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  much that I&rsquo;m going to marry him,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may do so, if he escapes the gallows&mdash;which I doubt,&rdquo; retorted the baronet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not doubt,&rdquo; interposed Norwood, quietly; &ldquo;I am certain Mr. Desmond is  innocent and could clear himself but for some absurd idea of honor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what&rsquo;s all this got to do with me?&rdquo; asked Balscombe, haughtily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply  this: that I have reason to believe Lady Balscombe had something to do with the  case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Balscombe!&rdquo; echoed Sir Rupert, turning pale with fury. &ldquo;Take care, sir, take  care. My affairs have nothing to do with you, and Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s folly is  quite apart from this&mdash;this murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think not,&rdquo; answered Norwood, quietly, &ldquo;for in my opinion Lady Balscombe left  this house and went to Lord Calliston&rsquo;s chambers on the night of the murder and  saw Mr. Desmond.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  Mr. Desmond tell you this?&rdquo; said Balscombe, in a nervous voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Desmond refuses to tell anything,&rdquo; rejoined Norwood; &ldquo;but I am certain it  was Lady Balscombe, and as you came up from Berkshire on that night I thought  you might tell me at what hour Lady Balscombe went out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am no spy on my wife&rsquo;s movements,&rdquo; retorted the baronet, haughtily. &ldquo;I came up  from Berkshire, it is true, and understood from my servants that my wife was in  her room. As we were not on good terms I did not see her, but went straight to  my club. From there I did not return till about three in the morning. I then  went to bed and did not know of Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s flight till next morning when  it was too late to stop her. So, you see, I can tell you nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Norwood  was about to reply when a knock came to the door and the servant, entering,  gave a card to Sir Rupert, which he glanced at and then handed to Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  is the detective who has the case in hand,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;Perhaps, if you  question him you may find out what you want to know. Show the gentleman in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dowker&rsquo;s  a clever man,&rdquo; said Norwood, when the servant had retired; &ldquo;he arrested  Desmond, so I presume he has come here to get evidence against him. Now, Miss  Penfold, we must put our wits against his.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and between the two stools poor Desmond will fall to the ground,&rdquo; replied the  baronet, with a cold smile. &ldquo;Here is your detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Dowker, being announced by the servant, entered the room quietly, and bowed first  to Miss Penfold and then to Sir Rupert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you do Mr. Norwood?&rdquo; he said, calmly. &ldquo;I did not think to meet you here, but  I suppose we&rsquo;re on the same errand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  quite,&rdquo; replied Norwood. &ldquo;You want to destroy Myles Desmond. I wish to save  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you are wrong,&rdquo; said Dowker, placing his hat beside a chair and taking his  seat. &ldquo;I want to save him also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Save  him?&rdquo; cried May, starting up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  because I believe him to be innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why arrest him?&rdquo; asked Norwood.</p>
  <p>Dowker  shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  evidence against him was too strong to permit him being at large, but from what  I have learned lately I have reason to believe he is not the guilty man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  remark, coming from such a source, produced the profoundest impression on the  mind of May Penfold, and Norwood himself seemed relieved, while the baronet  stood on the hearth-rug and looked stolidly on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we can work together?&rsquo;&rsquo; said the lawyer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  to prove the innocence of Mr. Desmond,&rdquo; replied Dowker. &ldquo;And in doing so we  will discover the real criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now,&rdquo; observed Balscombe, in a cold voice, &ldquo;having settled this little matter  about helping Mr. Desmond, whom I sincerely trust will be proved innocent of  this charge, perhaps, Mr. Dowker, you will inform me the reason of your visit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  sir,&rdquo; replied Dowker, deliberately. &ldquo;I want to ask you some questions about  Lady Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Two  of his listeners looked at him in surprise, struck by the singularity of the  coincidence that he should have called on exactly the same errand as they did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to know,&rdquo; said Dowker, &ldquo;if you are aware that your wife called at Lord  Calliston&rsquo;s chambers on the night of the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  says so?&rdquo; asked Balscombe, harshly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one,&rdquo; replied the detective; &ldquo;but did she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not tell you,&rdquo; said Sir Rupert; and he gave the same account of his  movements on the night in question as he had done to Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said Dowker, stroking his chin; &ldquo;so you were in town after all on that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir  Rupert looked uncomfortable under the steady gaze of the detective, and blurted  out, somewhat confusedly, that he was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you,&rdquo; questioned Dowker, turning to Norwood, &ldquo;think it was Lady Balscombe that  Desmond saw?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  because he said he could not get permission to speak except from the lady on  board the &lsquo;Seamew&rsquo; and the lady we know is Sir Rupert&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Lady Balscombe did not leave this house till after twelve o&rsquo;clock, and as the  woman saw Mr. Desmond before that time it could not have possibly been Lady  Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know my wife did not leave till after twelve?&rdquo; demanded Balscombe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  the evidence of her maid, Anne Lifford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she told me the same thing,&rdquo; interposed May; &ldquo;and if that is so, well&mdash;&rdquo; she  looked at the other three in helpless confusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  Mr. Desmond refuses to give us any information,&rdquo; said Dowker, &ldquo;the only thing  to be done is to wait and find out the truth from Lady Balscombe herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  could she know about this woman&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; asked Sir Rupert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  might not know much,&rdquo; replied Dowker, significantly, &ldquo;but enough to show in  what way her sister met her death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  sister!&rdquo; echoed the others in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have ascertained Lena Sarschine to have been the sister of Lady Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you mad?&rdquo; said the baronet, angrily. &ldquo;Do you know who my wife was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. The daughter of Captain Michael Dicksfall of Folkestone. He had two  daughters&mdash;twins&mdash;one, Miss Helena Dicksfall, ran away with Lord Calliston three  years ago and became his mistress under the name of Lena Sarschine; the other,  Miss Amelia Dicksfall, married Sir Rupert Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  baronet sunk into his seat, looking pale and haggard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  God!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;this is worse and worse. I knew Amelia had a twin sister,  but understood she was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead  as Helena Dicksfall, not as Lena Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  Lady Balscombe have had any interest in her sister&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; asked Norwood, in  a puzzled tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t make her out to be a murderess!&rdquo; said Sir Rupert,  vehemently. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s bad enough as it is, but surely she would not go so far  as&mdash;as&mdash;murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Dowker, brutally; &ldquo;they both loved the same man; and when  women are jealous, well &mdash;there&rsquo;s the devil to pay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment a servant entered with a telegram which he handed to Sir Rupert.  Tearing it open the baronet glanced hastily over it and then sprung to his  feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  we will know the truth,&rdquo; he said, triumphantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; asked May, trembling in every limb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply  this,&rdquo; said her guardian, crushing up the telegram in his hand, &ldquo;the &lsquo;Seamew&rsquo;  is on her way to England.&rdquo;</p>

    A Startling Discovery</b></h2>
  <p>PERHAPS  among all his friends Myles had no warmer supporter than Spencer Ellersby. The  young man appeared to be genuinely sorry that his evidence about meeting  Desmond in St. James&rsquo;s Street should be used against him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang  it!&rdquo; he said to Marton, as they were seated at their club, &ldquo;if I had only known  how it would have been twisted, I&rsquo;d not have said a word, but that detective  fellow got it out of me somehow&mdash;brute of a fellow&mdash;killed my dog, you know,  Pickles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I hear they&rsquo;ll not be able to prove the dagger in Desmond&rsquo;s possession was the  one used,&rdquo; said Marton. &ldquo;Good for poor old Myles&mdash;hey!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it&rsquo;s d&mdash;d rubbish, the whole thing,&rdquo; retorted Ellersby, hotly. &ldquo;What the  deuce should Myles kill this woman for? she was nothing to him; more likely  Calliston knows about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he&rsquo;ll soon be asked, at all events,&rdquo; said Marton, with a chuckle. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Seamew&rsquo;s&rsquo;  back at Brighton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  cried Ellersby, astonished. &ldquo;And Lady Balscombe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she&rsquo;s on board also,&rdquo; said Marton. &ldquo;Sir Rupert has gone down, I hear, to see  his wife. What a deuce of a row there&rsquo;ll be, hey!&rdquo; and the old reprobate rubbed  his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  there is one thing to be said,&rdquo; observed Ellersby ringing for a brandy and  soda: &ldquo;Calliston can&rsquo;t marry Miss Penfold now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the better for Desmond, dear boy, hey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see that,&rdquo; retorted Ellersby, coolly; &ldquo;even if Desmond&rsquo;s acquitted, he&rsquo;ll  have a stain on his name. She won&rsquo;t marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;  said The Town-crier, all on the alert for news. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply  this: that I&rsquo;m going to have a look in at the heiress myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fact;  the matrimonial stakes are open to any one, and I don&rsquo;t see why Miss Penfold  shouldn&rsquo;t marry me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  might if Desmond was out of the way; but as it is &mdash;pish!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; retorted Ellersby, lighting a cigarette. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with  her, and I&rsquo;m going to ask her to be my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bet  you a hundred to one she don&rsquo;t have you,&rdquo; said Marton, producing his  pocket-book.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo;  and the bet was booked immediately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  hang it,&rdquo; said Marton, when this little transaction was concluded, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not  fit to marry&mdash;Drink, dear boy&mdash;bad thing, hey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ll give all that sort of thing up when I&rsquo;m married,&rdquo; replied Ellersby,  carelessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  have to give up half your life then,&rdquo; retorted his friend, rudely, &ldquo;for you  always seem to be at the brandy bottle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ellersby  laughed, in nowise offended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you had had as many agues and fevers as I have, you&rsquo;d be at it too; but you  needn&rsquo;t be afraid; when I become benedict I&rsquo;ll take the pledge. By the way,  come and see my new rooms; I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;em all done up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right,  dear boy, right!&rdquo; said Marton, and the two gentlemen left the club chatting  about the Piccadilly murder and the possible result thereof.</p>
  <p>While  this interesting conversation was going on, Sir Rupert, Dowker, and Norwood  were all in a first-class carriage on their way to Brighton. As Marton had  informed Ellersby, the &ldquo;Seamew&rdquo; had returned to England the previous day, and  now the trio were going down to see if Lady Balscombe could give them any  information likely to solve the mystery of the murder of Lena Sarschine. Of  course Sir Rupert fully recognized the truth of the proverb &ldquo;Every man for  himself,&rdquo; but now the guilty passion of his wife appeared a secondary  consideration to the desire of saving an innocent man from a shameful death.</p>
  <p>On  the way down, Norwood told Dowker the discovery he had made about the dagger,  at which the detective was much astonished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If,  as you say,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;the lodging-house servant can prove the broken  dagger was in the house all the time, it certainly can not have been the weapon  used, and yet it corresponds in every particular with the other weapon I took  from Cleopatra Villa. I can quite understand Miss Sarschine taking it and the  manner in which it came into Desmond&rsquo;s possession, but if this was not the  weapon used, where is the weapon that was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are plenty of these daggers,&rdquo; suggested Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;but  the coincidence in this case is that the dagger found in Mr. Desmond&rsquo;s rooms,  which came from the house of the murdered woman, was poisoned, and Lena  Sarschine was killed by a poisoned instrument.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  were no other daggers taken from the house I suppose?&rdquo; asked Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I know of,&rdquo; replied the detective; &ldquo;but I am convinced that the whole  secret of this crime lies in the conversation between Mr. Desmond and Lady  Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not say my wife is guilty of this murder?&rdquo; said Sir Rupert, angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say nothing,&rdquo; replied Dowker, evasively, &ldquo;till I see Lady Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  the trio arrived at Brighton it was growing late, so they went to the Ship  Hotel and had something to eat. Finding out from the waiter that the &ldquo;Seamew&rdquo;  was lying a short distance from the pier they went down, and hiring a boat  rowed to the yacht. When they climbed up on the deck they were accosted by one  of the officers, who wanted to know their business.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  want to see Lord Calliston,&rdquo; said Balscombe, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid that&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; replied the officer, &ldquo;as he went up to town to-day  on business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there not a lady on board?&rdquo; asked Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;you  mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind telling us her name,&rdquo; said Balscombe, shortly, feeling a horror at hearing  his wife&rsquo;s name mentioned. &ldquo;Can we see her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will ask,&rdquo; answered the officer, and he went downstairs to the cabin, from  which he soon reascended with the news that they could go down.</p>
  <p>Dowker  went first, followed by Norwood and Sir Rupert, all feeling in a strange state  of excitement at the prospect of the coming interview.</p>
  <p>The  cabin was small, but luxuriously fitted up in pale-blue silk, and the walls  paneled in oak, with small medallions of seascapes around. A lamp hanging from  the ceiling shed a soft mellow light over all, and on the table below was a  work-basket and some embroidery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has been working, I see,&rdquo; whispered Balscombe with a sneer as they entered into  the cabin. No one was present, but suddenly they heard the rustle of a dress,  and a curtain at the end of the cabin parted, admitting a woman&mdash;a tall,  fair-faced woman, with shining golden hair.</p>
  <p>At  this sight Norwood and Dowker turned to look on Sir Rupert, to watch the effect  of the sight of his wife on him, when they saw he was pale as death and had  made a step forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wish to see me?&rdquo; asked the lady, advancing toward the group.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;  cried Sir Rupert, in a choked voice. &ldquo;You are not Lady Balscombe,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo;  in surprise. &ldquo;No!&mdash;I am not Lady Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  and Norwood turned suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lena  Sarschine!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_XVI"></a>Chapter XVI<br>
    More Revelations</b></h2>
  <p>IF  there ever were three men taken aback, those three were certainly in the cabin  of the &ldquo;Seamew.&rdquo; As for Miss Sarschine, she stood looking calmly at them with  an expression of surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you kindly tell me what you want?&rdquo; she asked, quietly. &ldquo;Is it to see Lord  Calliston?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Dowker, who had somewhat recovered himself, &ldquo;we wanted to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  see me?&rdquo; she said, with surprise,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  at least, Lady Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Sarschine smiled contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand what you mean,&rdquo; she said, coolly. &ldquo;You thought that Lord Calliston  had eloped with Lady Balscombe&mdash;so he intended to have done, but I changed his  plans and eloped instead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  where did you leave Lady Balscombe on the night you visited her?&rdquo; asked  Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not answer that question till I know who you are,&rdquo; she said, boldly,  frowning at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell you,&rdquo; said Sir Rupert, who had hitherto kept silent. &ldquo;This gentlemen  is Mr. Norwood, a solicitor&mdash;this Mr. Dowker, of Scotland Yard&mdash;and I am Sir  Rupert Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you  Sir Rupert Balscombe?&rdquo; she said, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  sister&rsquo;s husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know Lady Balscombe was my sister?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  found it out,&rdquo; interposed Dowker, &ldquo;from your father, Captain Dicksfall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father,&rdquo; she murmured, turning pale, &ldquo;you have seen him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  she said, coldly, &ldquo;now you have found out my relationship with Lady Balscombe,  what do you want to see me about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  murder,&rdquo; said Dowker, in a deep voice.</p>
  <p>She  sprung forward with a sudden cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  murder&mdash;her&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean that the victim of the Jermyn Street murder, whom we thought to be you,  turns out to be Lady Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  wife!&rdquo; said Sir Rupert, with a groan, burying his face in his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God!&mdash;it&rsquo;s  too horrible,&rdquo; cried Lena, and sunk down into a chair. &ldquo;Amelia dead&mdash;murdered&mdash;by  whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what we want to find out,&rdquo; said Norwood, coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  enemies had she?&rdquo; muttered Miss Sarschine, half to herself&mdash;&ldquo;none that would  desire her death&mdash;I can not understand. I can not&rdquo;&mdash;then suddenly struck by a thought,  she asked, &ldquo;Why did you think the dead woman was I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  she was dressed in your clothes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  yes!&rdquo; she said, feverishly. &ldquo;I can understand now&mdash;I can understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you see her last?&rdquo; asked Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  her own house in Park Lane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you leave her there ?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  she left me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  cried Dowker, a light breaking in on him. &ldquo;Now I understand&mdash;you changed clothes  there, and she left the house first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did&mdash;to go to Calliston&rsquo;s rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought so!&rdquo; said Norwood, with a cry of triumph. &ldquo;It was Lady Balscombe  Desmond saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Desmond!  Desmond!&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;What has he to do with this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply  this&mdash;he is now in prison on a charge of murdering Lena Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see&mdash;you mistook my sister for me&mdash; But murder&mdash;I can&rsquo;t understand&mdash;I can&rsquo;t  understand,&rdquo; and she pressed her hand across her forehead.</p>
  <p>Sir  Rupert looked up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen  to me,&rdquo; he said, sternly; &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s life hangs on your evidence, so tell us all  that happened between you and my wife on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a carafe of water on the table, and filling a glass from it Lena drank it  up quickly, and then turned with ashen face to the three men, who sat cold and  silent before her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell you all,&rdquo; she said, in a shaky voice, &ldquo;and you can form your own  conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  three settled themselves to listen, and she began to speak, in a trembling  voice, which gradually became steadier, the following story:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  need not tell you my early history, as you already know it. When I left  Folkestone I went abroad with Lord Calliston, and when we returned he took the  house for me in St. John&rsquo;s Wood. I stayed with him, because I loved him, and he  promised to marry me&mdash;a promise he has since fulfilled. When my sister became  known in London as Lady Balscombe, I soon found it out from Calliston, and then  implored him to make me his wife. He laughed, and said he would. Then my sister  fell in love with him&mdash;not he with her, I swear, for he loves no one but me, and  in the end she persuaded him to elope with her. I discovered the fact from my  maid, who learned it from Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s maid, Anne Lifford, and in despair I  went to see Calliston, and implore him to give up the mad idea. Blinded with  rage and despair, I took a dagger from the wall of my drawing-room, intending  to kill Calliston if he did not agree to give up my sister&mdash;sounds melodramatic,  I know, but look what I had at stake! Calliston was not in, and I only saw Mr.  Desmond, who tried to persuade me to go home again. He tried to get the dagger  from me, and I flung it across the room. By accident he put his foot on it, and  broke it. So seeing it was useless, I made no further attempt to get it, and he  put the pieces in his pocket. Then I went home in despair, but could not rest.  I went out with the intention of catching an early train to Shoreham,  concealing myself on board the yacht, and then confront my sister when she  arrived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I thought I would call and implore her to give up my lover. She had gone to a  ball, but I waited for her, and when she came into the room revealed myself. We  had a stormy scene&mdash;she refused to give Calliston up, and, at length, the only  thing I could obtain from her was this&mdash;that she would go to Calliston&rsquo;s  chambers, ask him if his love was for her or me, and when she got his answer  return to me at Park Lane. I agreed to this, but proposed, as she would compromise  herself in going to a bachelors rooms at that hour of the night, that she  should put on my clothes, and, as we were very like one another, she could pass  herself off for me in the event of discovery. We changed clothes, and she went  away while I remained and locked myself in her room. I waited nearly all night  for her return, but as she did not come I left the house about four o&rsquo;clock in  the morning and went to London Bridge Station, where I caught the  five-forty-five train to Shoreham. I was dressed in Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s clothes,  and went straight on board the yacht without awaking suspicion, as they were  expecting my sister. I went into my cabin, and fell asleep, worn out with the  events of the night. When I woke, about ten o&rsquo;clock, I found we were on our  way, and that Lord Calliston was on board. Being told that Lady Balscombe was  on board asleep, he did not trouble himself to see me, or else he would have  discovered the truth, but said I was not to be disturbed, and gave orders for  the yacht to start. When he did see me I need hardly tell you his surprise. I  told him all, and we had a terrible battle over things. He wanted to go back to  England, but I swore I&rsquo;d throw myself overboard if he did, so he yielded, and  in the end we made it up. We started for the Azores, but the yacht became  disabled in a storm, and put in to a French port, where we were married by the  English consul. Then we started back for England and arrived yesterday. Lord  Calliston went up to town on business, and I remained here&mdash;so that is all I  know of the affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you are now Lady Calliston?&rdquo; said Sir Rupert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he has done me that justice at last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I hope you&rsquo;ll have a happier life and end than your sister,&rdquo; said the baronet,  bitterly. &ldquo;But even what you have told us does not solve the mystery of her  death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  solves a good many things, however,&rdquo; said Dowker, cheerfully; &ldquo;it proves the  truth of Mr. Desmond&rsquo;s statement about the dagger, and shows us how it was Lady  Balscombe went to Lord Calliston&rsquo;s chambers instead of Miss  Sarschine&mdash;I beg pardon, Lady Calliston&mdash; But tell me, madame, did your husband  know of the murder before he left England?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  how could he?&rdquo; she said, in surprise. &ldquo;He came down to Shoreham by an early  train and the yacht left at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he would be sure to see about it in the morning papers?&rdquo; suggested Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  would only see the announcement, but no details,&rdquo; said Dowker, &ldquo;and thinking  Lady Balscombe was on board the yacht and Miss Sarschine at home, he would  never think either of them was the victim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  gentlemen,&rdquo; said Sir Rupert, turning his haggard face toward them, &ldquo;now we have  discovered the dead woman to have been my wife, what is the next thing to be  done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  Lord Calliston,&rdquo; answered Dowker, promptly. &ldquo;I want to know all his movements  on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t suspect him,&rdquo; said Lena, turning on him like a tigress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said I did,&rdquo; he replied, quietly. &ldquo;I merely want to find out his  movements, and I dare say he&rsquo;ll have no hesitation in giving an account of  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she, replied, wearily, &ldquo;and now, as I&rsquo;ve told you all, you&rsquo;ll  permit me to retire. I&rsquo;m quite worn out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  bowed to the three men, then left the cabin slowly. When she disappeared,  Dowker shook himself briskly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  gentlemen, we must go back to town at once and see Lord Calliston. I want an  account of all his movements on that night, and I already know where he was at  nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;  asked Norwood, curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the Pink &lsquo;Un, Soho, to see a boxing-match&mdash;afterward I don&rsquo;t know where he went,  but I must have a satisfactory explanation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you don&rsquo;t think he murdered Lady Balscombe?&rdquo; said the baronet.</p>
  <p>Dowker  looked wise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he replied, significantly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he murdered Lady Balscombe, but he  might have murdered Lena Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean he might have mistook my wife for his mistress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_XVII"></a>Chapter XVII<br>
    The Prodigal&rsquo;s Return</b></h2>
  <p>MRS.  POVY was delighted to see Calliston back again, but she was not going to betray  any exultation, as she did not think him worthy of it, so received him with  great dignity and formality. Lord Calliston, a tall, slender, dissipated young  man, noticed the restraint of her manners and commented thereon at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter with you, Totty,&rdquo; he asked, jocularly. &ldquo;You are as cross as two sticks&mdash;any  one been proposing to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t have them if they had,&rdquo; snapped Totty. &ldquo;No, my lord, there ain&rsquo;t  nothing the matter with me as far as I&rsquo;m aware.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Mrs. Povy, that&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; returned Calliston, disbelievingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re cross  about something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  ain&rsquo;t to be wondered at,&rdquo; burst out Totty, wrathfully. &ldquo;Not &lsquo;avin&rsquo; bin brought  up to being badgered and worrited by policemen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Calliston  turned round in his chair, and looked at her keenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  I say, my lord,&rdquo; replied Totty. &ldquo;After you &lsquo;ad gone some policeman, called  Dowker, or Bowker, came here and wanted to know all about you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Dowker!&rdquo; said Calliston, thoughtfully, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the detective that arrested poor  old Myles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know all about it then, my lord?&rdquo; said Totty, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  couldn&rsquo;t be in London twenty-four hours without knowing something of the Jermyn  Street affair,&rdquo; replied Calliston, coolly. &ldquo;I know that a woman was found dead,  and they arrested my cousin as the murderer, thinking the woman was Lena  Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Povy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it was Lady Balscombe that was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I thought she went off with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she didn&rsquo;t&mdash;shows I&rsquo;m not as black as I&rsquo;m painted,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;but  the worst of it is they seem to think I&rsquo;m mixed up in the affair, and the  detective was down at Brighton yesterday to see me. I quite expect a call from  him this morning to find out what I know about the row.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t think Mr. Desmond guilty, do you, my lord?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Povy, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pish!  what a question to ask,&rdquo; said Calliston, contemptuously; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been with our  family for a long time, Mrs. Povy, and you ought to know our character by this  time. Halloo!&rdquo; as a knock came to the door, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  door opened and his valet entered, soft-footed and deferential.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  gentleman to see you, my lord,&rdquo; he said, handing Calliston a card.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  I thought so,&rdquo; said Calliston, glancing at the card; &ldquo;show Mr. Dowker up,  Locker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Locker  retired, and Mrs. Povy was about to follow his example when Calliston stopped  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  go, Mrs. Povy,&rdquo; he said, authoritatively, &ldquo;you saw this man before, so you can  hear our interview&mdash;I may have to ask you something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Totty  acquiesced obediently, and went over to the window while Locker, showing Mr.  Dowker into the room, retired, closing the door after him. Calliston opened the  conversation at once:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  name is Dowker&mdash;you are a detective&mdash;you want to see me about the Jermyn Street  murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  correct, my lord,&rdquo; replied Dowker, quietly, though rather astonished at the  business-like tone assumed by Calliston. &ldquo;I want to ask your lordship a few  questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;  said Calliston, abruptly. &ldquo;Oh, so you didn&rsquo;t find out everything from the lady  you saw on board the yacht?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know I was down at Brighton?&rdquo; asked Dowker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply  enough,&rdquo; answered Calliston. &ldquo;I received a telegram from my sailing-master  informing me of your visit. You saw Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;&rdquo; here he glanced at Totty as if  doubtful to announce his marriage, &ldquo;Miss Sarschine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I saw Miss Sarschine,&rdquo; replied Dowker, with an emphasis on the last word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she doubtless told you of her visit to Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  of Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s visit to these rooms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Correct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  what do you want to know from me?&rdquo; demanded Calliston.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Dowker ran his hand round the brim of his hat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want an account of your lordship&rsquo;s movements on that night,&rdquo; he said, smoothly.</p>
  <p>Lord  Calliston sprung to his feet with a burst of laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heavens!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t think I killed Lady Balscombe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  said nothing, but looked discreetly on the ground, upon which Calliston  frowned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  carry the joke too far,&rdquo; he said, harshly. &ldquo;I am a very good-natured man, but  there are limits to one&rsquo;s good temper. In some cases I would decline to answer  your very impertinent questions, but as I want to save my cousin&rsquo;s life, if  possible, I will tell you what I know. Be seated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective bowed and took a seat, while Calliston turned to Mrs. Povy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can go now,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t let me be disturbed until I ring the  bell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a minute,&rdquo; observed Dowker, as Mrs. Povy passed him. &ldquo;You told me it was Miss  Sarschine visited Mr. Desmond on that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so it was,&rdquo; retorted Totty, defiantly, pausing at the door. &ldquo;If I was massacred  this minute I&rsquo;d swear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  are you so certain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I saw her face&mdash;as if I didn&rsquo;t know it! and another thing, she wore the same  dress and jacket as she did when she were here in the afternoon&mdash;get along with  you,&rdquo; said Totty, viciously, &ldquo;telling me I&rsquo;m telling lies, an&rsquo; am old enough to  be your mother, only my sons &lsquo;ud be men and not skeletons,&rdquo; and with this  sarcastic allusion to Dowker&rsquo;s leanness, the indignant Mrs. Povy departed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Dowker, thoughtfully, not paying any attention to her last remark, &ldquo;it was  the resemblance and the change of clothes made her make the mistake&mdash; humph&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  then, Mr. Dowker,&rdquo; said Calliston, tapping the table, impatiently, &ldquo;where do  you want me to begin from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  the time your lordship arrived at The Pink &lsquo;Un.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Calliston stared at him in  astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  the deuce did you know I was there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easily  enough,&rdquo; replied the detective, coolly; &ldquo;the little urchin you gave money to  told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  devil!&rdquo; said Calliston, in a vexed tone. &ldquo;One seems to be surrounded with  spies. Perhaps you can tell me how I spent the rest of the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I leave that to your lordship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it&rsquo;s easily done,&rdquo; retorted the young lord, coolly. &ldquo;I left these rooms  intending to go to Shoreham by the ten minutes past nine train from London  Bridge&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  Lady Balscombe to meet you there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;she  intended to go first to the Countess of Kerstoke&rsquo;s ball in order to avert  suspicion, and then was to come down to Shoreham by the first train in the morning  &mdash;about five-forty-five. At all events, I left here about eight o&rsquo;clock in order  to go down, when I looked in at my club for a few minutes, and heard of a  sparring match coming off at The Pink &lsquo;Un, and was induced by some friends to  go. I thought I&rsquo;d not bother about going down by the nine-ten train, as I could  catch the early train in the morning, and go down with Lady Balscombe, so I  went to The Pink &lsquo;Un, and saw the match &mdash; then I thought I&rsquo;d go home to my  rooms. Just as I got to them a woman came out of the door-way, and rushed away  like a mad thing. If you remember, it was a foggy night, but I was close enough  to recognize the dress, and thought it was Lena Sarschine. Just as I was  puzzling over her sudden appearance a man passed me quickly, and went after the  woman&mdash;they both disappeared in the fog, and I thought I&rsquo;d better follow and  find out what was up. I lost myself in the fog, and after wandering about for a  couple of hours I managed to get a cab and go to my club; there I met some  fellows, and as I had to catch an early train, did not think it worth while to  go to bed. I fell asleep, however, on the sofa, and the end of it was I went  down to Shoreham by a late train, and came on board the yacht. They told me  Lady Balscombe was on board, so I ordered the yacht to start at once, and it  was only when we were right out that I found out my mistake&mdash;until I came back  to England, I had no more idea than you that Lady Balscombe had been murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  listened to all this with the deepest interest, and then asked Lord Calliston a  question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  was the man who passed you in pursuit of the woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  should I know?&rdquo; replied Calliston, fidgeting in his seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did not know him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  could I recognize any one on such a foggy night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  you any idea who it was?&rdquo; persisted Dowker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I had,&rdquo; said Calliston, reluctantly. &ldquo;It is only fancy, mind, because I did not  see the man&rsquo;s face, but I thought his figure and bearing resembled some one I  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the name of that some one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Rupert Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  uttered an ejaculation of astonishment and summed up the whole thing in his own  mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cock-and-bull  story,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;He has learned since it was Lady Balscombe  whom he saw and wants to put the blame on to the husband&mdash;pish!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Calliston, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a grave accusation to make,&rdquo; said Dowker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not making any accusation,&rdquo; retorted Calliston, violently. &ldquo;I only think it was  Sir Rupert. I&rsquo;m not accusing him of anything. Is that all you want to know? If  so, you&rsquo;ll oblige me by leaving my rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Both  men arose to their feet and looked at one another, and so absorbed were they  that they did not hear the door softly open behind them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet, Lord Calliston,&rdquo; said Dowker, calmly. &ldquo;I want to know what you did those  two hours you were in the fog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do!  nothing, except walk about looking for the woman I thought Lena Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you found her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  what jury would believe that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean to accuse me of this murder?&rdquo; asked Calliston, furiously, clinching his  fists.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  accuse you of nothing,&rdquo; retorted Dowker, coolly. &ldquo;I merely put a case to  you&mdash;here is a man, yourself, going to run off with another woman, when his  mistress, as he thinks, comes to stop him&mdash;he sees her leave his chambers in a  furious rage, follows her&mdash;what is more natural than that he should meet her,  and she heap reproaches on him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a minute,&rdquo; interrupted Calliston, with a sneer; &ldquo;your picture is very tragic  but quite wrong. Suppose I did meet the woman who left my chambers, I would  find not Lena Sarschine but Lady Balscombe, the very woman I wanted to meet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  rubbed his head, being for once in his life nonplused by a man as clever as  himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does sound wrong I confess,&rdquo; he said ruefully, &ldquo;still you are in an awkward  situation. If you did not kill Lady Balscombe, what is the name of the person  who did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lena  Sarschine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a third voice that uttered the name, and both men turned round to see Lena  Sarschine looking at them with blazing eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  she said, advancing toward Dowker, &ldquo;I knew you suspected Calliston when you  came to the yacht yesterday, and I came up to prevent him meeting you. I am too  late for that, but not too late to prevent you arresting an innocent man. You  want to know who murdered my sister&mdash;I did&mdash;I was mad with rage, and jealousy, I  followed her from her own house and saw her leave these rooms, we met and she  told me she was going down to Shoreham and defied me, so I killed her with this  dagger,&rdquo; and throwing a small silver-mounted stiletto at the detective&rsquo;s feet,  her unnatural strength gave way and she sunk on the floor in a dead faint,  while the two men stood looking blankly at one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  God!&rdquo; said Calliston. &ldquo;this is terrible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Dowker, &ldquo;if it is true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you believe it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  one word!&rdquo;</p>

    What Myles Desmond Thought</b></h2>
  <p>IMPRISONMENT  is not calculated to raise a man&rsquo;s spirits, consequently poor Myles, having now  been shut up for some weeks, was in rather a dismal frame of mind. Norwood  informed him from time to time of the discoveries that were being made, so, in  spite of his quixotic ideas concerning the promise he had made to Lady  Balscombe, there seemed every chance that he would soon be released from his  perilous position.</p>
  <p>After  the discovery that Lady Balscombe was dead and not Lena Sarschine, Norwood,  accompanied by May Penfold, went to tell Myles about it in the hope that this  being the case he would now tell all about his interview with the deceased, and  thus possibly throw some light on the mystery. Myles was delighted to see May  and clasped her fondly to his breast, while Norwood, finding the meeting of two  lovers somewhat trying, busied himself with his notes at the other end of the  cell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew you would not forsake me, May,&rdquo; said Myles, tenderly, &ldquo;you at least do not  believe me guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not,&rdquo; replied May, &ldquo;nor does any one else&mdash;Mr. Dowker, my guardian, and  Mr. Ellersby all swear you are innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ellersby!&rdquo;  said Myles, in surprise, &ldquo;I thought after meeting me on that night he would  think I had committed the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he does not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not think Ellersby would prove such a friend,&rdquo; said Desmond, heartily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ll consider him so much of a friend when I tell you he wants  to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  marry you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  he came yesterday morning to see me and asked me if I would marry him.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you&mdash;what did you answer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you ask?&rdquo; she said, looking at him reproachfully. &ldquo;I told him I was engaged to  you&mdash;he said he had heard so but was not certain if it was true, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on,&rdquo; said Myles, seeing she hesitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he said you were in a dangerous position, but that if I promised to marry him  he would do his best to prove your innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can he do that?&rdquo; asked Myles, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered May; &ldquo;that is what he said; then I refused him again and  said your innocence would be proved without any assistance from him. After that  I left the library, and shortly afterward he went away. Since then I have not  seen him and I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very kind of Ellersby wanting to help me,&rdquo; said Myles, kissing May, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t  think it was honorable of him to make your hand the price of his help, knowing  you were engaged to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was not certain of that. You know every one thought Lord Calliston was my  future husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  can hardly think so now,&rdquo; said Myles, in a rather husky voice, kissing her on  the cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  soon as you are ready to attend to business, Mr. Desmond,&rdquo; said Norwood, coming  forward, &ldquo;I have some serious things to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on!&rdquo; replied Desmond, listlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said that on the return of Calliston&rsquo;s yacht you would be released from the  promise you made to the lady whom you saw on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  answered Myles, uneasily, &ldquo;I did, but I don&rsquo;t think the yacht will return for a  long time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are wrong&mdash;the &lsquo;Seamew&rsquo; is at Brighton now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Calliston?&rdquo; gasped Desmond, a grayish pallor overspreading his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Calliston  is in London&mdash;and Lena Sarschine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lena  Sarschine?&rdquo; mutters Myles, with a quick indrawn breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  We know now that Lady Balscombe was the woman who left the rooms in anger, and  was murdered in Jermyn Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True!  True!&rdquo; murmured Desmond, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  knew Lady Balscombe was murdered, and not Lena Sarschine?&rdquo; asked May, with a  cry.</p>
  <p>He  bowed his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I saw Lady Balscombe on that night. She was dressed in Lena Sarschine&rsquo;s  clothes, and came to see Calliston. He was not there&mdash;I was. She told me of the  visit of her sister to her house, and how she had come to learn the truth from  Calliston&rsquo;s own lips. I told her it was true that Lena Sarschine&mdash;or rather,  Helena Dicksfall&mdash;was Calliston&rsquo;s mistress. She was mad with anger, and wanted  to go straight back to her sister. Knowing if she did the two women would have  a row, and things might become serious, I tried to quiet her, but was  unsuccessful. In spite of all I could do, she rushed away outside, and though I  followed her in a few minutes, I was unable to find her, as she had disappeared  in the thick fog. I went along Piccadilly as quickly as I could, thinking she  had gone home, but after getting to Park Lane and not finding her, I thought I  had lost her on the way, as she could not have walked as quickly as I did. I  did not ask for her at Park Lane, as that would have let the servants know she  was out, and I wanted to save her good name. I went back again along  Piccadilly, down St. James&rsquo;s Street, in a vain hope of finding her. I was  unsuccessful, as you may guess, so was coming up St. James&rsquo;s Street on my way  back to Park Lane, when I met Ellersby, as you know. After that I gave up the  chase in despair and went home. Next morning I heard of the murder in Jermyn  Street, and saw by the description of the dress it was Lady Balscombe, but as  the idea got about it was Lena Sarschine, I did not seek to contradict it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  asked Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  very strong reasons,&rdquo; replied Desmond, coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  your very strong reasons connected with the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  not you tell them to me now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you give me a few minutes to think I will let you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good,&rdquo; said Norwood, cheerfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you not tell us all this before?&rdquo; asked May.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Lady Balscombe made me promise I would not tell of her visit,&rdquo; said Myles. &ldquo;When  she found out Calliston had been playing her false she left in a rage, saying  she would go back to her house, and not jeopardize her position in society for  his sake. If I had told you of her visit I would have had to tell you all the  rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  place your neck in a noose for the sake of any woman?&rdquo; said Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would not have done so,&rdquo; replied Myles. &ldquo;If it came to the worst I would have  told all, but I wanted to remain true to my promise as long as I could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whom  did you think Calliston had gone off with?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  first I thought no one,&rdquo; replied Myles, slowly, &ldquo;but when you came and  questioned me about Lena Sarschine, I remembered the change of clothes, and, of  course, knowing they were twins&mdash;for Lady Balscombe told me all on that night&mdash;I  guessed that Lena Sarschine had taken her sister&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far so good,&rdquo; said Norwood. &ldquo;But now for your strong reasons not to tell the  real name of the dead woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Myles  grew pale again, and bit his nether lip fiercely. Then he turned toward May and  took both her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you bear a shock?&rdquo; he asked, looking searchingly at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she replied, faintly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heavens!&rdquo; thought Norwood. &ldquo;Surely he isn&rsquo;t going to confess he murdered the  woman himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Myles  paused a moment, and was then about to speak, when the door of the cell was  opened and Dowker entered in a state of suppressed excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-morning,  Miss Penfold and gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, rapidly. &ldquo;I have some news&mdash;good news&mdash;for  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  what?&rdquo; asked Norwood, curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  Jermyn Street case,&rdquo; replied Dowker. &ldquo;I have been to see Lord Calliston, and  found out his movements on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  they incriminate him?&rdquo; asked Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  they did it would not much matter,&rdquo; replied the detective, &ldquo;for I have  discovered the real criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  cried Norwood and Miss Penfold, while Myles said nothing, but fixed his eyes  eagerly on Dowker&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;she  has confessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She!&rdquo;  cried May. &ldquo;Is it a woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is&mdash;Lena Sarschine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lena  Sarschine!&rdquo; echoed the three in astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same. She has confessed that she followed her sister on that night and killed  her through jealousy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  weapon did she use?&rdquo; asked Desmond, disbelievingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo;  replied Dowker, and produced the dagger Lena had thrown at his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you believe this story?&rdquo; asked Desmond.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  first I did not believe one word,&rdquo; answered the detective slowly, &ldquo;but I am now  doubtful, as I don&rsquo;t see what she would gain by confessing herself guilty of a  crime she had not committed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can tell you what she would gain,&rdquo; said Desmond, vehemently. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;she loves  Calliston devotedly, and thought you were trying to bring home the crime to  him. Did she overhear your conversation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  of it,&rdquo; admitted Dowker, reluctantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  that explains all,&rdquo; said Myles, triumphantly. &ldquo;She thought Calliston was in  danger of being arrested for the murder, and swore she did it in order to save  him. Remember, she has an excitable nature, and her nerves are overstrung with  the horror of her sister&rsquo;s death. Ten to one she did not know what she was  saying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this dagger?&rdquo; began Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pish!&rdquo;  retorted Myles. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that toy had anything to do with it. Find out  if it&rsquo;s poisoned, for I&rsquo;ll stake my existence it is not. No; Lena Sarschine did  not commit the crime!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to be, very certain,&rdquo; said Dowker. &ldquo;Perhaps you can tell me who did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you for certain,&rdquo; retorted Desmond, &ldquo;but I have my suspicions. You  wanted to know my reasons for not divulging the identity of the deceased,&rdquo; he  went on, turning to Norwood, &ldquo;I can now give them, as this self-accusation of  Lena Sarschine&rsquo;s is too absurd to be allowed to stand. I told you I did not see  Lady Balscombe again on that night. I told a lie&mdash;I did. When I left the house  to follow her and see that she got home safely, I went along Piccadilly, as I  told you. Under a gas-lamp I saw Lady Balscombe standing talking to a man. They  were quarreling, and the man&rsquo;s voice was raised in anger. Suddenly I saw the  man put his hand to her throat and wrench something away. Lady Balscombe gave a  cry and fled across the street in the direction of St. James&rsquo;s Street, followed  by the man. They were swallowed up in the fog, and I saw no more of them. It  was the direction they took that led me into St. James&rsquo;s Street on that night.  If you remember, there was a mark on Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s neck, as if something had  been wrenched off, so you can now understand the reason. I believe the man  inflicted the fatal wound at the same time. She fled from him, went blindly  down St. James&rsquo;s Street, into Jermyn Street, and sunk in a dying condition on  the steps where she was found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you recognize the man?&rdquo; asked Dowker, who had been listening intently to this  story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who was it?&rdquo; cried the trio.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Rupert Balscombe,&rdquo; said Myles.</p>
  <p>May  fell into Norwood&rsquo;s arms with a stifled cry, but Dowker began to speak rapidly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  Lord Calliston also said he saw him going after Lady Balscombe. By Jove! so he  is the criminal after all. What a fool I&rsquo;ve been&mdash;I&rsquo;m off!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  to?&rdquo; asked Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to find out where the locket and chain is that Sir Rupert wrenched off his  wife&rsquo;s neck.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_XIX"></a>Chapter XIX<br>
    What Dowker Discovered</b></h2>
  <p>AFTER  hearing the revelations made by Lord Calliston and Myles Desmond, concerning  the movements of Sir Rupert Balscombe on the night of the murder, Dowker had no  doubt in his own mind that the baronet was guilty of the crime. Rumor, speaking  truly for once, said they lived unhappily together owing to Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s  numerous infidelities, and it was only the honor of his name that prevented Sir  Rupert applying for a divorce. Now, however, he had done so, as his wife&rsquo;s  apparent flight with Lord Calliston was of too glaring a character to be  overlooked even by the most complacent husband.</p>
  <p>Dowker,  however, did not believe in the genuineness of the application, merely looking  upon it as a clever piece of acting on the part of a wily scoundrel to cloak  his crime. In the detective&rsquo;s opinion, Sir Rupert had simulated rage on hearing  of his wife&rsquo;s apparent iniquity, had applied for a divorce, knowing she was dead,  and had gone down to the yacht with a full knowledge that he would not see Lady  Balscombe. In fact, all through he had acted a very clever part, in order to  ward off suspicion that he was guilty of the crime of murder.</p>
  <p>What  Dowker now wanted to find was the locket which Sir Rupert had wrenched off his  wife&rsquo;s neck, and also the weapon used in the committal of the crime. It had  been clearly shown that the Malay creese taken from Cleopatra Villa could not  have been used by any one, so the baronet must have had some dagger of his own,  which was now doubtless in his possession. If these two things could be found,  their discovery, coupled with the evidence of Calliston and Desmond, would be  quite sufficient to prove Sir Rupert guilty, unless, indeed, he could prove  himself innocent, of which there did not seem to be much chance.</p>
  <p>Dowker  did not go at once to Park Lane as he was anxious to know how Lena Sarschine,  or rather Lady Calliston, was after her hysterical confession of guilt, so he  drove down to Cleopatra Villa, and on being shown into the drawing-room was  confronted by Lord Calliston. That young nobleman looked haggard and worn out,  so that in spite of his conduct, which had led to the murder of one woman and  the self-accusation of another, the detective felt sorry for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want now?&rdquo; he asked, irritably. &ldquo;Have you come to arrest my wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  wife,&rdquo; said Dowker, pretending to have heard this for the first time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Calliston, boldly; &ldquo;we were married in France and she is now my wife. I  don&rsquo;t believe her guilty of this crime&mdash;do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told you this morning I did not,&rdquo; said the detective, quietly. &ldquo;It was only a  statement made by her to save you, because she thought you were guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you say?&rdquo; asked Calliston, abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you had asked me this morning, I should have said the circumstances were  suspicious,&rdquo; said Dowker, smoothly, &ldquo;but now I can say heartily that you are  innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know I am?&rdquo; demanded Calliston, ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I have found out the real criminal, at least, one I believe to be the real  criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Rupert Balscombe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Sir Rupert Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought so,&rdquo; said Calliston, bitterly. &ldquo;I know he hated his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  had he not reason?&rdquo; asked Dowker, significantly.</p>
  <p>Calliston  flushed and turned his face away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not a saint,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice, &ldquo;and though my conduct may appear to  you to have been wrong I could hardly help myself; it would have taken a  stronger man than myself to withstand the temptation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  replied Calliston, turning toward the detective, &ldquo;I have married the only woman  I ever really cared about, and we are going a tour round the world as soon as  she is well&mdash;that is&mdash;if she ever does get well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she then so ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brain  fever,&rdquo; replied Calliston, curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  very sorry to hear it,&rdquo; said Dowker, quietly, &ldquo;for she is a noble woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Calliston  made no reply, but flung himself down on a couch and buried his face in his  hands; so, without saying another word, Dowker left the room and made his final  exit from Cleopatra Villa.</p>
  <p>It  was now about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, so Dowker drove to the Park Lane  mansion and asked for Sir Rupert Balscombe. The footman told him the baronet  was out, but added, on hearing his name, that Miss Penfold had given orders if  he called that he was to be shown into the library, as she wished to see him.  Dowker was pleased at this as he wanted to ask May some questions, and followed  the servant in a very pleased frame of mind.</p>
  <p>May  Penfold was seated by a small table talking eagerly to Mr. Norwood, who sat  near her with a pocket-book open on his knee. When Dowker entered May arose and  went forward in a curiously eager manner. Her face was very pale, and there  were dark circles under her eyes, but her features wore a very hopeful  expression, for she was now certain of saving her lover, though on the other  hand she might lose her guardian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  so glad you&rsquo;ve come, Mr. Dowker,&rdquo; she said, quickly. &ldquo;Mr. Norwood and myself  have been talking over the position of the case and we want your assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will be delighted to give it,&rdquo; answered Dowker, gravely, taking a seat. &ldquo;I am  anxious to make Mr. Desmond all the reparation in my power, as I was the  unconscious cause of all his trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  only acted according to your duty,&rdquo; said Norwood, in a business-like tone; &ldquo;the  evidence against my client was very strong, but the evidence against Sir  Rupert&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  stronger still,&rdquo; finished the detective. &ldquo;Exactly; but we have to find out that  evidence. Lord Calliston and Mr. Desmond can swear they saw him in Piccadilly  following his wife, and the latter saw him wrench the locket off his wife&rsquo;s  neck; now I want to find that locket, and also&mdash; if possible&mdash;the dagger with  which the crime was committed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Norwood  shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may be certain he would not keep dangerous evidence like that about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me; I think he would, because, taking the case as a whole, it would have been  impossible to bring his guilt home to him but for the circumstance of his being  recognized by Lord Calliston and Mr. Desmond; even if he did not keep the  dagger he would certainly retain the locket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  asked May.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he would never dream that there would be any question of the locket being  brought in evidence&mdash;had it not been for the mark on the neck of the wrenching  off, no one would have ever known that Lady Balscombe wore a locket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  but I knew,&rdquo; said May, eagerly; &ldquo;she had a large gold locket with a thin gold  chain&mdash;she always wore it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did she attach such value to it?&rdquo; asked Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know; but she wore it morn, noon, and night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you describe it?&rdquo; demanded Dowker, knitting his brows.</p>
  <p>May  Penfold thought a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was an old-fashioned piece of jewelry,&rdquo; she said at length; &ldquo;I never saw it  very closely, as Lady Balscombe kept it to herself, but it had two curls of  hair&mdash;light and dark&mdash;twined together on one side, and on the other I think there  was a portrait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think Sir Rupert and Lady Balscombe were so fondly attached as all  that&mdash;it&rsquo;s more probable it was Lord Calliston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you any idea where Sir Rupert could have put it?&rdquo; asked Dowker, glancing round  the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the least in the world,&rdquo; replied May. &ldquo;He might have it in his bed room or  dressing-room&mdash;or it might be here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo;  echoed both the men, rising.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Sir Rupert was always in this room,&rdquo; said May. &ldquo;He mostly sat at this desk, so  perhaps he placed it in one of the drawers thinking no one would ransack his  private papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  desk she alluded to was a massive piece of furniture, beautifully carved. There  were innumerable drawers down each side&mdash;a morocco covered writing-board, and at  the back of this, more drawers&mdash;while the center was a fantastic piece of  carving, representing the head of Shakespeare with characters from his dramas  all round him. Owing to the elaborate carving the wood was wonderfully massive  and thick, so that the whole desk looked a remarkably handsome piece of  furniture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  belonged to Lady Balscombe&rsquo;s father, Captain Dicksfall,&rdquo; said May, as they  looked at it, &ldquo;and he gave it to Sir Rupert as a wedding present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  bent down and pulled at the drawers, but they were all locked, whereupon he  straightened himself and looked somewhat disconsolate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much chance of getting in there,&rdquo; he said, in an annoyed tone, &ldquo;and we can not  break open the drawers as we have no authority to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May  Penfold laughed a little maliciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  spite of your being a detective,&rdquo; she said, lightly, &ldquo;I am able to help you&mdash;the  mouse will gnaw the net and release the lion. If Sir Rupert has hidden the  locket anywhere, it will be in the secret hiding-place of this desk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there one?&rdquo; asked Norwood, looking at it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I was examining the desk one day, and Lady Balscombe told me there was a secret  drawer which nobody knew but herself&mdash;not even Sir Rupert, as her father had not  told him about it on presenting the desk. I asked her where it was, but she  refused to tell me, and said I could find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you try?&rdquo; asked Dowker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I did&mdash;I am a woman, and therefore curious,&rdquo; replied May, with a smile, &ldquo;I  discovered it one day by accident, so I will now show it to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment,&rdquo; said Norwood. &ldquo;If Sir Rupert did not know of the existence of this  secret place he can hardly have hidden anything in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May  Penfold&rsquo;s face fell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;that&rsquo;s  true,&rdquo; she replied, dismally, &ldquo;however, I will show it to you, and then we will  find some means to open these other drawers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  end of this will be a search-warrant,&rdquo; said Dowker, decisively.</p>
  <p>May  did not reply; but leaning on the desk, pressed her fingers on the ears of the  Shakespeare head&mdash;a sharp click was heard&mdash;and she lifted out the whole face of  the carving, disclosing a wide place, but with no depth, so that any articles  placed therein would have to stand on end. As she removed the carving Dowker  gave an exclamation and bent forward, for there before them was an old-fashioned  locket, a slender gold chain, and an arrow-head. The three looked at one  another in silence, which was broken by Dowker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo;  he said, taking up the locket, &ldquo;is without doubt what you allude to, Miss  Penfold&mdash;see, there is a fair curl and a dark curl of hair on this side, and on  the other the face of a man&mdash;or rather a boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  indeed the face looked like that of a boy&mdash;smooth face&mdash;black hair&mdash;clearly cut  features and dark eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  can it be?&rdquo; said May, gazing at it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen that face before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  have I,&rdquo; answered Dowker, with decision; &ldquo;there is something in it familiar;  but is this the locket you have seen Lady Balscombe wear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and  this is the chain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far so good,&rdquo; said Norwood, taking up the arrowhead: &ldquo;but what is this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  looked at it for a moment, and then smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would advise you to take care of that,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s poisoned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poisoned!&rdquo;  echoed Norwood, and quickly replaced it in the drawer, &ldquo;how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I am certain that it is the weapon with which the crime was committed&mdash;we were  misled by the Malay creese, but this is a certainty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you think Sir Rupert guilty?&rdquo; asked May, in dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Rupert is jealous of his wife&mdash;he follows her on that night, knowing she is  going to elope&mdash;meets her in Piccadilly, and is seen following her by one  witness&mdash;is overheard having angry words with her by a second, who also sees him  wrench a locket off her neck&mdash;his wife is found dead&mdash;and in a secret drawer,  known only to Sir Rupert, yourself, and the dead woman, is found the locket and  the weapon with which the crime was committed. I think the case is clear  enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  will you do now?&rdquo; asked Norwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put  them back for the present,&rdquo; said Dowker, replacing the locket and chain, &ldquo;and  wait here for Sir Rupert. I will question him. He will deny it. Then I will  confound him by showing him the evidence of his guilt. Will you kindly replace  the carving, Miss Penfold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May  did as she was told in silence, for though this discovery would save her lover,  yet she was deeply grieved at the thought of what it meant to her guardian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  his wife had been a good woman this would not have happened,&rdquo; she said,  bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  all people good I&rsquo;d have no occupation,&rdquo; said Dowker, dryly.</p>
  <p>At  this moment they heard footsteps outside and a man talking, whose voice May  immediately recognized.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  Mr. Ellersby,&rdquo; she said, quickly. &ldquo;He has come to see Sir Rupert about my  marriage. I can not meet him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  can I,&rdquo; said Dowker, &ldquo;as I want to see Sir Rupert alone. Is there no place  where we can wait?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  here,&rdquo; said May, and walked to the end of the room, where there was a door  leading to a smaller apartment, before which hung a curtain. &ldquo;Let us all go in  here till he is gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dowker  and Norwood took up their hats and went after her into the room, leaving the  library quiet and deserted.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_XX"></a>Chapter XX<br>
    The End Of It All</b></h2>
  <p>SPENCER  ELLERSBY, well dressed, nonchalant, and languid, entered the room with a smile  on his face, which faded quickly when he found there was no one present to  receive him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you said Miss Penfold was here,&rdquo; he observed, sharply, turning to the  footman who was showing him in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  she was, sir,&rdquo; stammered the servant, in some confusion, &ldquo;and two gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo;  muttered Ellersby to himself, taking a chair, &ldquo;some of those empty-headed men  about town, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think Miss Penfold must have gone up to the drawing-room, sir,&rdquo; said the  servant, turning toward the door. &ldquo;Will I take your name up, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Ellersby, with a yawn. &ldquo;I want to see Sir Rupert just now, so I&rsquo;ll wait  here till he comes in, and go upstairs afterward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good, sir,&rdquo; said the footman, and was just retiring when Sir Rupert, looking  jaded and worried, entered the room, upon which Ellersby rose to his feet, and  the footman going out, closed the door behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Sir Rupert,&rdquo; he said, carelessly, &ldquo;I am so glad to see you, as I thought I&rsquo;d  have to wait for some time. I must apologize for coming into this room, but  your servant said Miss Penfold was here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you seen her?&rdquo; said Sir Rupert, moodily, taking his seat in front of the desk  and swinging round the seat so as to face his visitor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he made a mistake. She is up in the drawing-room, so I am going to see her  later on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile?&rdquo;  demanded the baronet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to see you,&rdquo; finished Ellersby, smoothly, resuming his seat.</p>
  <p>Balscombe  raised his eyebrows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very important subject&mdash;marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose  marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  have I to do with your marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  great deal,&rdquo; replied Ellersby, calmly, &ldquo;because I want to marry Miss Penfold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo;  said Balscombe, pointedly, &ldquo;quite impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  so?&rdquo; asked the other, coolly. &ldquo;I have a good position, plenty of money, and my  character is good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  moral character?&rdquo; sneering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that,&rdquo; with a laugh, &ldquo;is no better nor worse than other young men, so I would  like your answer. Will you favor my suit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,  in the first place, my ward is going to marry Myles Desmond.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marry  Myles Desmond!&rdquo; replied Ellersby, with a sneer. &ldquo;A man lying in prison under  a charge of murder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will be proved innocent of that charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  my business,&rdquo; retorted Balscombe, with a scowl.</p>
  <p>Ellersby  laughed in a most irritating manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that is your first objection,&rdquo; he said, lightly. &ldquo;Pray what is your second?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  answer Balscombe turned to his desk, and unlocking a drawer, took therefrom a  bundle of old letters tied with a blue ribbon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is my second objection,&rdquo; he said, holding them up. &ldquo;Perhaps you recognize these  letters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Spencer  Ellersby turned pale and half rose from his seat. &ldquo;Where did you find them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the secret drawer of this desk,&rdquo; replied the baronet. &ldquo;My wife, thinking I did  not know the hiding-place, put them there for safety; but her father told me  about the secret drawer when he gave me the desk, and one day I opened it idly,  not expecting to find anything, when I found these.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ellersby  laughed discordantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what are those wonderful letters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  need not pretend ignorance,&rdquo; said the baronet, coldly. &ldquo;These are letters  written by you to my wife at Folkestone, under her maiden name of Amelia  Dicksfall, and which prove that you were her lover long before she met me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  acknowledge it,&rdquo; said Ellersby, insolently. &ldquo;And what have you to say about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply  this,&rdquo; replied Balscombe, rising, &ldquo;that you may thank God that I do not kill  you where you sit. But my wife proved to be such a worthless woman, she is not  fit to be defended, and knowing this, you have the daring to ask me for my ward&rsquo;s  hand. Do you think I would give her to you, a scoundrel, a profligate? Never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you will,&rdquo; said Ellersby, coldly, &ldquo;for the very good and sufficient  reason that I can force you to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know well enough,&rdquo; sneered the other. &ldquo;If the police ask me who committed the  Jermyn Street murder, I can tell them who did it&mdash;Rupert Balscombe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  scoundrel&mdash;do you mean to say I killed my wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can swear it&mdash;and I will, too, if you don&rsquo;t give me your ward!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a cursed lie!&rdquo; cried the baronet, white with fury; &ldquo;where are your proofs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Open  that hiding-place, and you&rsquo;ll find them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir  Rupert gave a stifled cry, and staggered back against the desk, while Ellersby  looked at him with a smile of triumph. The three listeners in the other room  were standing close to the door, with greedy ears drinking in every word of  this strange conversation.</p>
  <p>The  baronet with an effort recovered himself, and, turning to the desk, touched the  secret spring and took down the carving. There lay the locket, the chain, and  the fatal arrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is the locket you wrenched off your wife&rsquo;s neck on that night,&rdquo; said Ellersby,  pitilessly, &ldquo;and there is the poisoned arrow-head with which you committed the  crime!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Balscombe  took out the objects and looked at them vacantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  devilry is this?&rdquo; he said, fiercely. &ldquo;This is the locket, I know&mdash;the locket  that contains your hair and your picture, curse you! But the arrow-head&mdash;I know  nothing of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  who would believe you?&rdquo; replied the other, mockingly; &ldquo;it is in your secret  drawer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you know this hiding-place?&rdquo; demanded Balscombe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said I knew it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but you said your evidence was in there, so you must have seen these things  before. I believe you put the arrow-head there yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I, indeed?&rdquo; said Ellersby, with a sneer. &ldquo;Where would I get the arrow-head? don&rsquo;t  blame me for a crime you committed yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did  not commit it!&rdquo; shouted Balscombe, in a frenzy. &ldquo;I acknowledge I knew of my  wife&rsquo;s intended elopement, and came up from Berkshire to prevent it. I was too  late, and went to Calliston&rsquo;s rooms to see him. I missed the door in the fog,  and when I found it, the first thing I saw was my guilty wife leaving the  house. I followed her and caught up to her&mdash;she shrieked, and I gave way to my  just anger. I knew she had this locket, and thought it contained Calliston&rsquo;s  portrait, not yours, so wrenched it off her neck to make sure. She ran away  across the street and I lost her in the fog. I swear I saw no more of her on  that night till I read of her death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  knew it was your wife that was dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was not certain. I heard the &lsquo;Seamew&rsquo; had sailed with Lady Balscombe on board,  and thought that the dead woman was some wretched street-walker with whom my  wife had changed clothes; but I was not certain she was dead till I saw Lena  Sarschine on board the &lsquo;Seamew&rsquo;&mdash;then I knew my wife was the victim of the  Jermyn Street tragedy, but I swear I did not kill her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ellersby  laughed scoffingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it is to your interest to say that&mdash;but who will believe you with such  strong evidence against you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I suppose you mean to denounce me?&rdquo; said the baronet, coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if you agree to give me the hand of May Penfold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not force her inclinations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but you are her guardian and can influence her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I refuse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do so at your own risk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that risk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Means  hanging to you!&rdquo; said Ellersby, brutally.</p>
  <p>The  two men stood looking fixedly at one another, and for a few moments there was a  dead silence, while the three listeners waited with beating hearts for the end  of the conversation which seemed to promise the solution of this extraordinary  mystery.</p>
  <p>Balscombe  remained for a time in deep thought, and then looked up with a look of  determination in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  decline to accede to your demand,&rdquo; he said, firmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you must take the consequence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am prepared to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ellersby  paused for a minute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you tell me the reason for your decision?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,  because I am innocent of the crime you accuse me of, and second, I believe you  placed this poisoned arrow-head here in order to implicate me in the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can speak openly to you,&rdquo; said Ellersby, coolly, &ldquo;because you are in my power.  I did place the poisoned arrow-head there, in order to secure evidence against  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it was you killed my wife!&rdquo; cried Balscombe, stepping toward him with the arrow-head  in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said I did!&rdquo; retorted Ellersby, audaciously; &ldquo;but I can tell you this&mdash;I  met your wife on that night after you left her, and I asked her for those  letters, as they compromised both her and myself. She told me where they were  and described the hiding-place to me. Last time I was here I searched and  discovered the secret, but the letters were not there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  They were removed by me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I see; but if I did not find the letters, I found something better&mdash;the locket  with my portrait which you took from your wife&rsquo;s neck on that night; so, as I  wanted to marry Miss Penfold and wanted you to help me, I placed there the  arrow-head so as to force you for your own safety to help me. I have succeeded,  and you must do what I order, or swing for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  devil!&rdquo; cried Balscombe, madly. &ldquo;It was you who murdered my unhappy wife&mdash;do not  deny it! I can see it in your cowardly face; I will accuse you before the  world, and hang you for your crime!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  who will believe your word against mine? There is no evidence against me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  own confession!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  not include a confession of murder; what I have said to you in private I will  deny in public&mdash;you have no witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  lie! here are three!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two men turned round with a cry, and there, on the threshold of the room stood  May Penfold, with a look of triumph in her eyes; and behind, Dowker and  Norwood. Ellersby saw he was lost, and with a harsh shriek made a bound for the  door of the library; but before he could reach it Balscombe threw himself on  him and bore him to the ground. The two men rolled on the floor fighting  desperately, and then Dowker joined in to assist in securing Ellersby, when  suddenly his struggles ceased and he became quite passive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all over,&rdquo; he said, quietly, with a livid face, as Balscombe arose to his feet.  &ldquo;I will escape you yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will not escape the gallows!&rdquo; cried Balscombe, panting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I will,&rdquo; sneered Ellersby, with a ghastly smile; &ldquo;and by your own act. You  forgot you had the poisoned arrow-head in your hand, and you have wounded me&mdash;  see!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  held up his right hand, and there they saw a long red, ragged wound where the  weapon had torn him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  ten minutes I will be a dead man,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;Not all the science in  the world can save me now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse  it!&rdquo; cried Dowker, in a rage, while the other three remained silent with  horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you are angry at my escaping from you,&rdquo; said Ellersby, with his usual cynicism.  &ldquo;Console yourself, my astute thief-catcher, my capture would not have redounded  to your credit, as you were quite on the wrong scent. You suspected Desmond,  Calliston, Lena Sarschine, and Balscombe; every one but the right one. I have  fooled you to the end, and, now I am caught, will yet escape your clutches.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>May  Penfold stepped; toward him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you have sinned so deeply,&rdquo; she said, in a low tone, &ldquo;you had better make  reparation while you may and confess all, so as to release Myles from prison.  Meanwhile, I will go for a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  signed her feebly to remain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doctor can do me any good,&rdquo; he said, faintly, &ldquo;but I will tell all. Mr. Dowker  will, perhaps, write it down, and if I&rsquo;m not too far gone, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll sign it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will write your confession,&rdquo; said Norwood, and, sitting down at the desk, he  took up a pen and waited.</p>
  <p>It  was a strange scene. Ellersby lying on the floor with his eyes half closed,  Balscombe leaning, against the desk, with his clothes all torn and a white,  haggard face, and May Penfold standing beside Dowker, looking with pitying eyes  on the dying man at her feet.</p>
  <p>As  he knew he had not long to live, Ellersby commenced at once:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am, as you know, the son of a West Indian, and came to England to be educated.  I was brought up, in early childhood, by a negro nurse, and before I left  Barbadoes she gave me an arrow-head, which, she told me, was steeped in deadly  poison, and that one scratch would kill. Something to do with their Obi  business, I suppose. She told me to use it on my enemies, but I was not so  savage as she was, though I have got negro blood in my veins, and I did not  bother much about it. I finished my education and went into society. One time,  while down at Folkestone, I met Amelia Dicksfall, and loved her&mdash;you do not know  how I loved her&mdash;with all the mad passion of a creole. She led me on till I was  her slave and then refused to marry me, for at least two years&mdash;for what reason I  was then ignorant, but now I know it was because she wanted to marry a title,  and kept me in hand so as to become my wife if she failed to realize her  ambition. I went abroad and when I returned a short time ago, I found she had  married Balscombe. I saw her and reproached her with her treachery, but she  only laughed at me. Then I heard how she carried on with Calliston and swore I  would kill her if she preferred him to me. She denied that she cared for him,  and then I heard about her projected elopement and determined to make one more  appeal to her. If that failed I took an oath I would kill her with the poisoned  arrow-head. I thought I would see her on that night, so, dressing myself in  evening dress, I put the arrow-head in my pocket and went along to Park Lane. I  was told she had gone to the Countess of Kerstoke&rsquo;s ball and, thinking this was  a mere subterfuge on her part, I thought I would go to Calliston&rsquo;s chambers and  see him. I went along to his rooms in Piccadilly, but as I did not know where  they were it was some time before I found them. I was going in when I saw  Balscombe waiting about, and wondered what he was doing there. While thus  waiting a woman came out, and I recognized Lady Balscombe at once. I saw Sir  Rupert go after her and witnessed their dispute under the lamp. I saw him  wrench off the locket, and then Lady Balscombe fled. I followed, and found her  wandering vaguely about in the fog. She recognized me, and we had a stormy  interview. I insisted on her coming to my hotel and going away with me in the  morning, pointing out that now her husband had seen her coming out of Calliston&rsquo;s  chambers he would apply for a divorce. I then asked her about the letters and  she told me where they were. I said I would get them, and then Sir Rupert,  would never know with whom she had gone away. She agreed to go with me, and  went as far as Jermyn Street; then she refused to go further, saying she loved  Calliston and hated me. She insisted on going down to Shoreham in the morning,  and taunted me so that I got mad with anger and determined to kill her. So I  apparently agreed to what she said and asked her to kiss me for the last time.  She did so, and when I was embracing her I wounded her in the neck with the  poisoned arrow-head. She thought it was only a pin pricking her, but when she  was dying I told her what I had done and said, that now she could never be any  other man&rsquo;s mistress or wife. She died shortly afterward, and then I thought  about saving myself, so went along to the Countess of Kerstoke&rsquo;s ball, in order  to prove an <i>alibi</i> should it be  necessary. In coming back I went up the steps where I had left her to see if  she was still there, thinking the body might have been discovered. It was still  lying there, however, so I called the policeman. The rest you know. As to the  arrow-head, I placed it in there in looking for the letters, in order to throw  the blame on Balscombe, because I knew all his movements on that night were in  favor of the presumption of his having committed the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused at this point, for his eyes were becoming glazed and his voice was faint  and weak. Norwood had written out the words that had fallen from his lips, and  now brought the paper and pen, in order for him to sign it. The dying man  raised himself on his elbow with an effort and signed his name with difficulty  in the place indicated by the lawyer. When this was done, Balscombe and Norwood  affixed their signatures as witnesses; then the latter placed the confession in  an envelope.</p>
  <p>The  action of the poison being very rapid, Ellersby was now in a half-comatose  condition, his eyes being closed and his breathing stertorous. He began to  speak again in a drowsy voice, which sounded as if he was far away:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the irony of Fate . . . brought me here . . . to my death. I came to conquer  and remain to die. . . . The old Greeks were right. . . . Man ... sport of Fate  . . . Nemesis . . . wins hands down ... if there is . . . world . . . beyond .  . . I . . . I . . . find . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  slow, monotonous voice stopped here, and his head fell back; to all appearances  he was asleep, but the onlookers knew it was his last earthly sleep, and when  he awoke it would be in another world.</p>
  <p>The  calm, placid light of the evening stole softly through the windows and shone on  the still face of the dead man, and on the awe-struck spectators.</p>

  <p>THE  Piccadilly puzzle being now solved, nothing remained but to settle all matters  in connection therewith, which was speedily done. The publication of the whole  story caused a great deal of excitement, and of course all the newspapers  quoted the well-known proverb that &ldquo;Truth is stranger than fiction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Myles  Desmond was released from prison, and became a kind of hero, owing to the  fortitude with which he had sustained his unpleasant position. Sir Rupert gave  his consent to May Penfold&rsquo;s marriage with him, and it took place at St. George&rsquo;s,  Hanover Square, with great splendor, and the happy pair departed to the  Continent for their honey-moon. On their return Myles published a novel he had  written, which was a great success, and being in an independent position, owing  to his wife&rsquo;s fortune, he had the peculiar satisfaction of writing to please  himself, and not the public.</p>
  <p>Lord  Calliston did not remain in London long, as the part he had played in the  terrible drama was not by any means an enviable one; so as soon as Lena  Sarschine, now Lady Calliston, recovered from her illness, they went away to  the South Seas in the &ldquo;Seamew,&rdquo; where among the gorgeous scenery of the islands,  they soon forgot the one tragic episode of their lives.</p>
  <p>Sir  Rupert did not marry again, but left London for his place in the country, where  he shut himself up like a hermit, and steadily refused to see any one. His  faith in womankind was gone, and not having any heirs, a distant cousin is now  eagerly waiting for his demise, as he is anxious to enjoy the Balscombe estates  and the large income appertaining thereto.</p>
  <p>Flip  was taken off the streets by Dowker, and put to school, where his natural  sharpness was wonderfully developed, and he is now looking forward to the time  when Dowker intends to instruct him in the mysteries of the detective craft and  make him his successor.</p>
  <p>As  to Dowker, he was a good deal disappointed at the unlooked-for termination to  the case, for had it not been for the accident of overhearing the conversation  in the library, he would most certainly have done his best to hang Sir Rupert  Balscombe. As it turned out that the baronet was innocent, he felt only too  glad that he had been saved from the committal of such a terrible crime as  condemning a guiltless man to an ignominious death, but to this day, he always  refers to the Piccadilly Puzzle as the most extraordinary case that ever came  under his experience.</p>
