<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>Chapter 1 -- DEATH OF A KING</h2>

<p>Mr Law applied his uncanny gifts of calculation to a stocktaking
of the events.</p>

<p>The great king by whose orders he had once been turned out of
France lay dead. In this there was no matter for wonder; for His
Majesty was old, and kings, be they never so great, are mortal. Yet
natural though the fact might be, not merely France but the whole
civilized world held its breath in contemplating it. This king, at
whose frown, according to Madame de Sévigné, the very earth
trembled, had reigned so long, so imposingly and so absolutely that
he had assumed in men's minds a quality of immortality.</p>

<p>Nor was it only his body that had perished. His glory had
perished with it. The veneration in which he had been held was
transmuted abruptly into execration and contempt. His subjects, no
longer awed by the majesty of his existence, remembered only the
hardships and sacrifices his splendours had imposed upon them,
considered only the hardships and sacrifices they inherited from
his rule in a nation that his magnificence left bankrupt and
exhausted.</p>

<p>His very obsequies had been marked by an indecency of
jubilation. His body's last journey to the vaults of St Denis had
been taken through a countryside where booths and tents had been
set up for the junketings and rigadoons in which it was accounted
fitting to celebrate his passing. He was scarcely cold before his
will, which in life none had dared to thwart, was set at nought,
and his testament, his last dispositions for the governing of
France during the minority of the great-grandchild who was to
succeed him, was torn up before the assembled Parliament.</p>

<p>His nephew, Philippe of Orléans, assumed alone the office of
Regent, which by dead Majesty's bequest should have been shared
with the Duke of Maine, one of the dead Majesty's many
bastards.</p>

<p>Later, when Philippe of Orléans came to view at closer quarters
the burden ambition had urged him to assume, it is possible that he
may have wondered had he not been guilty of a rashness. In the
moment of its assumption, however, he knew only satisfaction in his
triumph.</p>

<p>This death of Louis XIV was to govern, as death will, the course
of many lives besides his nephew's; but none perhaps more signally
than that of John Law, the Laird of Lauriston, with which it had no
apparent connection. The news of that death and of the
circumstances attending it reached Mr Law in Turin, where in the
autumn of 1715 he was paying court to Victor Amadeus of Savoy. His
passport to the Savoyard's favour had been a letter from His
Majesty's brother-in-law, Philippe of Orléans. The warmth of that
letter's commendation by so exalted a personage provided
mystification for King Victor Amadeus when contrasted with what was
known of Mr Law. For, be it said at once, the Laird of Lauriston's
was a disturbing history. A fugitive from England, where he had
sensationally broken prison a dozen or more years ago, after having
been sentenced to death for a duel in which he had killed his man,
he had since been a wanderer in Europe, with no means of livelihood
other than gaming, by which it was notorious that he had amassed a
fortune. Report computed this at four or five million livres, and
whilst the figure was certainly exaggerated, it was no more to be
doubted that he was rich than that he could add to his wealth
whenever he chose to approach the tables.</p>

<p>In France it had been his mysterious skill with cards and dice,
and the vast sums he had won by holding a bank at faro at the house
of that famous courtesan, La Duclos, which had led to his being
requested by Monsieur d'Argenson, the King's Lieutenant-General of
Police, to leave the country. There was no suggestion that he
loaded his dice or marked his cards. It was universally recognized
that his play was scrupulously correct, and that his good fortune
was to be attributed solely to a mathematical genius and an
incredible ability and speed in estimating odds. He played by a
martingale of his own invention, a system for which he claimed
ultimate infallibility when practised by himself, however, it might
fail at the hands of less gifted calculators, and to facilitate his
reckoning he employed gold counters of the value of eighty livres,
especially minted for him.</p>

<p>Upon his expulsion from France, and perhaps because of it, had
followed a similar lack of appreciation of his activities in the
states of Venice, Florence and Genoa; and so notorious was he
become that it is unlikely that without the credentials supplied
him by the Duke of Orléans he would have been allowed to linger in
the dominions of King Victor Amadeus as a more or less honoured
guest. Something may certainly have been due to the singular charm
of a personality which commanded the favour of His Savoyard Majesty
as it had earlier commanded that of his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Very tall and spare and of an excellent shape, he moved with the
easy grace of a man proficient in every bodily exercise. His
countenance was of a patrician cast, which, after all, did not
belie his origin, for if his father--from whom no doubt he
inherited his mathematical skill--was no better than an Edinburgh
goldsmith and banker, his mother, whom his looks favoured, issued
from the noble house of Argyle. An early attack of the smallpox
had, as sometimes happens, left his face of a pallor that added
curiously to its attractiveness and deepened the air of mystery
that seemed to cloak him. <i>Il était trop beau</i>, said of him a
French contemporary, and so the women seemed to have found him,
largely to his undoing in his early years, when, after his father's
death, he took his share of the family fortune to London, and
dissipated it there in three or four years of reckless living.</p>

<p>Brought face to face with destitution, he sought salvation in
that mathematical genius of which quite early in his father's
counting-house he had given startling proof. He was to apply it
further and ever more masterfully in a measure as he was matured by
study, experience and observation in the course of his wanderings
through Europe. As a result he gave the world a treatise on
finance, <i>Money and Trade Considered</i>, which had gone far to
win him the regard of that gifted dilettante, the Duke of Orléans,
and at present procured him at least the tolerance of King Victor
Amadeus.</p>

<p>He had sought more than this at the hands of His Majesty, and
seeking it he had been careful to abstain in Turin from cards and
dice. He flew at higher game than either could provide. The
finances of Savoy were in a sad disorder. The incessant wars of
Louis XIV had ruined not only France but all her neighbours. In the
repairing of those fortunes Mr Law perceived a game on a more
engrossing and exhilarating scale than any that the tables could
provide. Unfortunately, he failed to persuade His Majesty to let
him play it. After some timid flirting with Mr Law's ideas, King
Victor Amadeus had declared himself with finality.</p>

<p>"My friend, I fully agree with Monseigneur d'Orléans. Your
system appears to be everything that is shrewd and excellent. But
appearances, we know, may prove deceptive. It is my duty to
mistrust my judgment in a matter so profound and complex. If the
system should, after all, be wrong, then ruin must follow, and I am
not powerful enough to ruin myself.</p>

<p>"I trust that you will see in my decision no reason to terminate
your sojourn in Turin. Though I shall understand if, accounting now
that you waste your time here, you should wish to take your leave
of us."</p>

<p>It was whilst he was still asking himself whether this was no
more than a courteous dismissal that word came to him of those
events in France. It was brought by William Law, who arrived in
Turin in response to a summons from his elder brother whilst still
in the optimistic persuasion that he would be given the direction
of the finances of Savoy. Fortuitously William Law was accompanied
by a Spanish financier named Pablo Alvarez, a man with whom the
Laird of Lauriston had been intimate during his days in Amsterdam,
when he was sounding the mysteries of Dutch banking.</p>

<p>Don Pablo had been in Genoa, soliciting for himself the
representation of the Bank of St George in England, whither he was
going. In this he had failed, as he might have known he would, for
the Genoese were of all people the most mistrustful. He professed
himself compensated, however, by meeting there his old friend
William Law, who had come by sea, on his way to Turin, and he had
seized the chance to accompany him so as to offer his duty and
service to the Laird of Lauriston.</p>

<p>"After all," as he explained, "I have travelled scarcely a
league out of my way; for with or without the sponsorship of the
Bank of St George, I am still for England, and Turin lies on my
road. I journey overland. Tediously slow, perhaps; but then my
entrails revolt at the very smell of a ship."</p>

<p>A short, paunchy, hairy man, his yellow face of a Semitic cast,
his heavy jowl blue from the razor, the financier expressed himself
in a rapidly flowing French that was slurred and sibilant and eked
out by a profusion of Spanish gesture that at moments made him
grotesque. If he could serve Don Juan in England, let Don Juan give
him his commands. England, through the activities of the South Sea
Company, offered great opportunities to men who knew their way
through the labyrinth of finance. Apart from that, England was
rendered by its wealth a banker's paradise; it was not, Don Pablo
thanked God, a country like France, reduced to beggary by the
warring follies of a king who was now in hell.</p>

<p>They sat in a salon of splendours on the mezzanine of the Palace
of Carignano. Eastern rugs glowed on the elaborate wood mosaics of
the polished floor; arresting portraits adorned the walls, an
Infanta of Spain, a prince of the House of Savoy, the children of
King Charles I of England, all three by Van Dyck, besides some
choice pieces by lesser masters. Heavy gilded furniture, precious
porcelains and sparkling lustres completed a background of the
magnificence that Mr Law accounted proper to his own subdued
elegance.</p>

<p>The talk swung back the Spaniard's strictures to French affairs,
and now it was that Mr Law learnt in detail how black was France's
inheritance from the glorious sun-king whose effulgence had dazzled
the world.</p>

<p>"Faith," he said when all was told him, "the only thing that
surprises me is that you should still think of England when France
must offer so rich a field to a man of your gifts." His French was
as harsh as Don Pablo's was liquid, but it was no less fluent.</p>

<p>"France!" Don Pablo was explosively scornful. "You have not been
listening to me. Can penury offer a field to a financier? And then
its government! In order to tear up the testament of King Louis and
secure the regency for himself exclusively, the Duke of Orléans has
been driven to make strange concessions. So as to purchase the
suffrages of the dukes and peers, he has restored to them
privileges which it was the work of Richelieu and Louis XIV to
suppress. Instead of governing by secretaries of state, he has set
up a council of regency for each department; unwieldy bodies to
which he has appointed those whose support he required so as to
exclude the Duke of Maine from the share in the regency ordained by
the late king. Having accomplished this, Monsieur d'Orléans lets
the rest go to the devil. So long as he is left in peace to his
orgies, his supperparties and his women, whoever chooses may govern
France.</p>

<p>"You conceive the conflicts that follow and the ensuing
confusion in a country already crippled by the lack of money. Yet
you suggest that fortune is to be sought there! My friend, you want
to laugh."</p>

<p>The opening of one of the wings of the tall double doors
constrained Mr Law to postpone his answer.</p>

<p>A woman in blue and gold of a richness almost excessive
displayed herself upon the threshold. Moderately tall, her slim
firm waist surged from the ballooning hoop to the swell of a breast
in the display of whose white curves there was no reticence. Her
dark, chestnut hair was partly confined by a lace cap, the last
adaptation of the expiring fontange. Beneath this the face, very
fair of skin, conveyed an impression of gentle purity, corrected
only for the discerning by cheek-bones that were a shade too high
and lips that were a shade too full.</p>

<p>A moment she remained at gaze; then, smiling without
effusiveness, smiling perhaps because she knew that smiling became
her, she drifted forward on invisible feet. In English, her voice
rich and musical, she gave her brother-in-law welcome without
excessive cordiality. "Laguyon has only just told me that you had
arrived, Will."</p>

<p>"My dear Catherine!" William Law almost as tall as his brother
and no less shapely, advanced to meet her, took her hands and bent
to kiss them.</p>

<p>"I wish that I could be more glad to see you. But I fear that we
have only disappointment for you. John will have told you that his
swans are, as usual, less than geese. Less even than farm-yard
ducks." Over her brother-in-law's shoulder her eyes seemed to
discover at last the Spaniard, and her brows were arched. "But is
it possible? Don Pablo Alvarez, is it not?"</p>

<p>Don Pablo bowed himself as nearly double as his paunch
permitted. "Honoured in your recollection, madame. My humble
homages." His English was even more execrable than his French.</p>

<p>"I am to suppose," she said as she surrendered a hand to his
lips, "that John's folly is to answer for your presence, too."</p>

<p>"John's folly! Ho, ho, madame, do you, then, discover folly in
him? Might it please God I be as foolish!"</p>

<p>This she construed as contradiction, and did not care for
it.</p>

<p>"Give thanks that you are not. But I keep you standing." She
found herself a chair, draped her hooped skirts about her, and
talked petulantly on. "Has John told you that we are packing? It's
an occupation at which I seem to spend my wretched life. We are to
go on our travels again. You shall tell me, Don Pablo, that I am
married to the Wandering Jew."</p>

<p>"Never shall I tell you that. Never! The Wandering Jew he
travelled for punishment, and that could not be for any man who has
your ladyship for travelling companion."</p>

<p>Her shrug implied repudiation of the laboured compliment. "It
will need more than gallantry to teach me resignation. I was not
reared to be dragged with my children across the world. Nor is it
as if we were willing travellers. We go because we are shown the
door. My pride will not accommodate itself--what woman's would?--to
being expelled from one country after another. You will agree that
it is too much to ask of a poor lady."</p>

<p>To his discomfort Don Pablo suspected too much earnest in what
he had supposed a jest. He glanced uneasily at Mr Law, to behold
him standing in the cold indifference of one who does not choose to
hear. It was left for William, conciliatorily, to furnish a
reply.</p>

<p>"You'll not be forgetting, dear Catherine, that John has been
hardly used by fate. Exile has been forced upon him; and the life
of an exile is seldom other than restless."</p>

<p>"Pray, Will," said Mr Law's level voice, "do not be at the
trouble of making yourself my apologist. Catherine, unfortunately,
has abundant grounds for complaint, as she has long since persuaded
herself and me. I am not to deny it."</p>

<p>"You could not," said madam, flushing.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," Mr Law continued evenly, "we are to take thought
for our guests."</p>

<p>"I do not need to be told. Will's room has been waiting for him.
As for Don Pablo..."</p>

<p>The Spaniard broke in. "Do not give me a thought, dear madame.
Alas, my plans shall not permit that I spend more than this night
in Turin, and my baggage is at the Albergo Biancamano. I sleep
there. For one night, you will see, it would be unpardonable to
discompose you."</p>

<p>She remained ungraciously silent, wherefore, "It shall be as you
please," said her husband. "But at least you'll dine with us."</p>

<p>"That, at least," she was quick to confirm, perhaps because of
the opening it afforded for lamentation. "We have seen little
enough company during these dreary months in Turin."</p>

<p>Don Pablo never heeded the plaint. "I ask myself who would
refuse the invitation. I am too well acquaint' with the delights of
your table."</p>

<p>She rose. "I will give orders. By your leave, Don Pablo, and
yours, Will."</p>

<p>Mr Law, with formal courtesy, held the door for her, and she
passed out, leaving them to resume the discussion her coming had
interrupted. But it was not until later, after they had supped,
that this gave indication of the fruit it was to bear.</p>

<p>As Don Pablo expected, he found Mr Law's table in harmony with
the subdued magnificence of his environment. His cook was a
Bolognese, and there are no greater masters of the gastronomic art,
as the Spaniard, whose appetite was gluttonous, protested in order
to excuse his excesses. They drank Falernian with the crayfish, a
well-sunned red Tuscan with the stuffed ortolans, and with the
sweets there was champagne.</p>

<p>Served in mellow candlelight by footmen who moved noiselessly
under the direction of Laguyon, the incomparable steward, the
course of the repast assumed a character almost ritualistic.</p>

<p>When at last the cloth was raised and madam had retired, Don
Pablo sat back with buttons eased, to voice his wonder.</p>

<p>"Enviable man. Most enviable of men, there is much you might
have taught Lucullus. A so noble board, and a so noble and
beautiful lady to grace it!" Enthusiasm drove him into Spanish.
"<i>Dios mio</i>! What are you but the pampered child of Madame
Fortune?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes her fool," said Mr Law, and to turn the conversation
spoke once more of France, and thus renewed the Spaniard's
scorn.</p>

<p>"I've said what I think of that bankrupt country, where for
every one who dies of indigestion nine die of starvation. To speak
of seeking fortune there is a poor jest. Does one extract something
from nothing?"</p>

<p>"From the illusion of nothing I have known much to be extracted
by a little skill."</p>

<p>"Oh, agreed, where there are illusions. But here are none. Here
is reality; naked reality; naked is, indeed, the word. You smile.
You don't believe. In that case, my friend, why do you not explore
that hunting-ground for yourself?"</p>

<p>"You forget that France is closed to me."</p>

<p>"It may have been. But you'll hardly find it closed now, ruled
by a profligate who has all the vices and wears them proudly. Do
you suppose he will care that you were turned out by the police
when you offered your services to King Louis?"</p>

<p>"No, no. I was turned out because I won too much at faro. But
before that the king had rejected my system when the Duke of
Orléans brought it to his notice. The bigoted lecher, who was in a
perpetual state of deadly sin, declined my services because I am
not a Catholic."</p>

<p>"Mother of God! If that was all, could you not have gone to
Mass, like Henri Quatre. Or are you by chance religious?"</p>

<p>"Not even superstitious."</p>

<p>"Do not let us exaggerate. There was never yet a gamester
without superstition. You all make votive offerings to Madame
Fortune upon whom you all depend."</p>

<p>"Make an exception in my favour. I prefer to depend upon my
methods. And these depend upon a study of the laws of chance."</p>

<p>"So I've heard you boast. A contradiction in terms. Chance knows
no laws. Chance is the negation of law. That is elementary."</p>

<p>"In logic, perhaps. But not in fact."</p>

<p>"<i>Vamos</i>, <i>hombre</i>! If a thing is demonstrable in
logic, must it not occur in fact?"</p>

<p>"Have you always found it so? Have you never speculated upon
probabilities?"</p>

<p>"But probability is estimated by intelligent inference from
given facts."</p>

<p>"So is the turn of a card or the fall of the dice. If it were
not, you would not have dined so well tonight. For a dozen years
and more I have lived, and lived <i>en prince</i>, by cards and
dice. Fortune may be blind, but it is possible to take her by the
hand and guide her. The art of winning lies in the study of why men
lose. Indeed," he ended on a more pensive note, "that may be the
whole art of life. I do not know." His long countenance darkened.
He took up a decanter. "Let me fill your glass, Don Pablo. This
Tokay is from the cellars of an emperor."</p>

<p>"And worthy of them, or I'm no judge." The Spaniard raised the
full glass in a hairy paw, and fondly observed the wine glowing
like a topaz in the candlelight. "However fortune comes to you, Don
Juan, I pledge you its continuance."</p>

<p>Mr Law raised his glass in his turn. "May you find in England
all that you seek there."</p>

<p>William Law, watching him, observed the shadow that had crossed
his face, and added it to other trifles he had noticed. But it was
not until Don Pablo departed, and the brothers were alone together,
that he came to utter his concern.</p>

<p>Mr Law had reverted to the subject of France and to what that
day he had learnt of her affairs. "The news may be timely. Philippe
of Orléans' old interest in my system may not be dead. Nor is
Orléans merely the debauched prince of Don Pablo's account. A
voluptuary certainly, yet a man of unusual vision and of many
talents. I certainly might find my profit in the French distress.
With no other aim in view it is worth a thought. It may even permit
me to make amends to you for having brought you to Turin on a
fool's errand."</p>

<p>"That need give you no concern. I was weary of Amsterdam, and I
am quite ready to take a chance with you in Paris."</p>

<p>"It will perhaps be best that I first test the ground there
alone. There is much to consider. Catherine, for instance. She will
make me scenes, of course. But that she will do in any event. So as
well may she rage at my going there as elsewhere. All's one to her
so that she may glory in martyrdom and flaunt her agonies to
reproach me." He laughed without mirth.</p>

<p>His brother's light, shrewd eyes were grave. "Then it is...it is
always the same?"</p>

<p>"How else should it be? Human beings do not change save by
deterioration."</p>

<p>William Law came slowly to stand beside his seated brother. He
had the same dark complexion as the Laird of Lauriston, and the
same long if less aquiline cast of countenance. Of the two you
would judge him the gentler and kindlier, and therefore the less
resolute.</p>

<p>He spoke on impulse, a hand affectionately on his brother's
shoulder. "I am sorry, John. I'd like fine to see you happy."</p>

<p>"Happy? What is happiness? I have often wondered. Once, indeed,
I thought to grasp it; but it went like water through my
hands."</p>

<p>"Which means that you still rate the shadow above the
substance."</p>

<p>Frowning, Mr Law looked up into his brother's troubled eyes.
"Substance?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Catherine," Will answered, to add almost impatiently: "Is not
she the true substance, the woman who came to comfort you in your
hour of bitterest need, when you were a fugitive, exiled, outcast
and discredited, the woman who threw away all for love of you, just
as you had thrown away all out of infatuation for a worthless
shadow? And do you still suffer that shadow to stand between you,
to darken your life with Catherine? Do you..."</p>

<p>Peremptorily, Mr Law raised a checking hand--a long, beautiful
hand in its froth of lace. His tone, however, was dispassionate.
"No, no, no, Will. All that is over and done with. I put it behind
me when Margaret Ogilvy took up the succession to the Countess of
Orkney and became King William's mistress; when I understood how
vainly I had killed Beau Wilson and thrust my neck into a noose.
How else could it have been?" He laughed with reflective
bitterness. "Could I have married Catherine else?"</p>

<p>"That is where you deceive yourself. Bear with me, John, if I
speak my mind even to your hurt. It makes me angry to see you
wasting yourself on needless suffering."</p>

<p>"Suffering? For my sins you would say." Mr Law was ironical.</p>

<p>"No less. You took Catherine to wife in the bitter hour of your
disillusion, took her and the love she brought you as an antidote
to the poison in your soul..."</p>

<p>"I did not know her then."</p>

<p>"I am thinking that you did not know yourself. You'd be grateful
for the devotion she brought you, touched by it, and maybe
realizing how she had cast all away in coming to you, you'd be
accounting it no less than a duty to marry her. But it was not
gratitude Catherine craved of you."</p>

<p>Mr Law spoke on a sigh, quietly, almost humbly. "Perhaps it was
all I had to give. And God knows I gave it unstintingly
until..."</p>

<p>"Until?"</p>

<p>"Until Catherine herself rejected it, revealed herself exacting,
shrewish, cross-grained, intractable--as you've seen for yourself.
She became--or maybe she was born--mistrustful and suspicious.
These are qualities that grow by what they feed on. Resentful, all
things to her are fuel for grievances..."</p>

<p>"Has she no grounds for resentment?" Will interjected. "Do you
conceive that she has no intuitions, no sense of the ghost that
walks beside you, the memory of the woman who was Beau Wilson's
wife until you made her a widow and King William made her Countess
of Harpington in her own right?"</p>

<p>Mr Law looked up, still without sign of impatience. His smile
was at once sad and quizzical. "You had ever a weakness for
Catherine, Will. In you she possesses a stout advocate."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking she needs one, as you do, as you both do, if this
state of unhappiness is not to be perpetuated. I tell you, John,
that woman loves you. She'll be labouring under a sense of defeat
and frustration that sours her nature, whilst you feed it by
resenting in your turn a state of things you have created. You'll
say it is no affair of mine..."</p>

<p>"I haven't said so."</p>

<p>"You should know I am speaking from the love I bear you, John. I
can't remain indifferent when you are suffering."</p>

<p>"I understand. That is why I let you talk. It may well be, as
you say, that I have no more than I have earned, and that I have no
right to repine. I do not know. But suffering is too big a word. It
is only the weak who linger in unhappiness. Life holds many
interests for a man apart from love."</p>

<p>"But not for a woman. Have you ever thought of that?"</p>

<p>It was a moment before Mr Law answered. Then, without raising
his voice, but on a note that made of the question a command,
"Shall we drop the subject, Will?" he said. "There are other
matters to engage us. This question of France which you interrupted
to make philosophy on marital relations. Give me your views on that
instead. It will be more profitable."</p>

<p>Thus enjoined, conquering reluctance, William Law abandoned his
forlorn hope of arguing harmony into his brother's household.
Coming, however, to the matter of his brother's financial schemes,
he displayed himself less competent to give advice. If John were
satisfied that he could command the Regent's ear to the extent of
persuading His Highness to give him in France the scope he sought,
William was as ready and willing as ever to abandon every other
interest in order to place himself at his brother's disposal.</p>

<p>They talked late into the night, or, rather, Mr Law talked,
expounding at length those banking notions which he had carefully
elaborated whilst hoping to conquer the hesitations of King Victor
Amadeus. When at last he stood up and spoke of bed his decision was
taken.</p>

<p>"I'll pack no later than tomorrow and set out within the week.
But I'll first test the ground before I summon you to join me. If
the Regent should look upon my system with as much favour as when
last I saw him, why then a golden prospect should lie before
us."</p>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>Chapter 2 -- THE REGENT IN
COUNCIL</h2>

<p>On a dull morning of late October of that year 1715 a gathering
of nobles and some others awaited the Regent in a spacious
tapestried chamber of the Palais Royal, that palace built by a
cardinal to express his grandeur and ceded by him to his king, as
had happened once in England to another great palace built by a
prelate.</p>

<p>Dominant in this assembly, as was proper considering its
purpose, were the members of the Council of Finance, all of whom
were noble, and four of whom were dukes: the ascetically handsome,
haughty Noailles, who was President of the Council and conceived
himself, not without some reason, of great authority in financial
matters; the rather epicene La Vrillière, who discharged the
functions of secretary; the dapper little Duc de Saint-Simon, who
was perhaps closest in the intimacy of the Regent, and who
accounted an understanding of finance beneath the dignity of a
gentleman; and the still foppish old Maréchal Duc de Villeroy, lean
of shanks and with red-raddled cheeks, who was governor of the
infant King and who shared some of Saint-Simon's scorn of too close
an acquaintance with affairs. Of the remaining eight, the most
notable, on the score of his self-assertiveness and entire devotion
to Noailles, was Rouillé du Coudray, a gross untidy fellow with the
flushed, veined countenance of the heavy drinker.</p>

<p>With these members of the Council of Finance there were this
morning eight Councillors of State, including the Marquis
d'Argenson, the King's Lieutenant-General of Police, who from his
sinister looks was known in Paris as the Damned, and the
well-favoured, portly Chancellor d'Aguesseau, a jurist of talent
and of an integrity that had become proverbial and was now
imperilled only by too great a loyalty to Noailles.</p>

<p>Whilst some of these gentlemen of quality lounged about the oval
council-table and others formed groups in the embrasures of the
tall windows that overlooked the vast courtyard, some thirteen
other men, who had been especially summoned, held themselves
modestly apart in the background, as became persons conscious of
their commoner clay. They were France's leading bankers and
merchants, sober in dress and demeanour if we except that financial
giant Samuel Bernard, whose long, lean person was gaudily
ostentatious in purple coat, gold waistcoat and elaborate periwig.
He, it is true, could claim nobility; for he had been knighted by
Louis XIV for valuable pecuniary services. But because there was in
France a sharp discrimination between the noble and the merely
ennobled, he had wisely decided that his place was among his
fellow-bankers.</p>

<p>To the councillors this invasion of their debates by these
enriched plebeians was an abominable desecration. Only the parlous
state of the finances could bring them resentfully to submit to it.
It was intolerable that gentlemen of birth should be constrained to
debate in the presence of vulgarians, particularly remembering the
acrimony in which their contentions commonly developed. It was an
acrimony springing inevitably from the divergence of their views on
the remedies to be applied and from the sharp rivalries by which
their political ambitions moved them. Wrangle as they might,
however, they had made no progress towards the solution of the
problem of a national debt amounting to two and a half milliards;
for when out of a revenue of one hundred and forty-five million
livres they had discharged the annual expenses of government
amounting to one hundred and forty-two millions, they were left
with a bare three millions out of which to find the interest for
that monstrous balance.</p>

<p>From the outset the Duke of Saint-Simon had ingenuously urged
the convocation of the States-General and the declaration of a
national bankruptcy, as the only way to save the country from a
revolution. He took the view that a prince should not be bound by
the liabilities of his predecessor, and that the edicts of a king
who had been lodged in the vaults of St Denis were, like himself,
so much dust. He pointed out what everybody knew, which was that
commerce was languishing, industry paralysed, unemployment swelling
daily, the land devastated by war, agriculture ruined and famine
already stalking the countryside; and he concluded that there could
be no improvement until the finances were set in order, which could
be attained only by making a fresh and unencumbered start.</p>

<p>The old Duke of Villeroy's prescription had been a capital levy.
But d'Aguesseau, the Chancellor, called in to give upon this the
benefit of his renowned wisdom and experience, had demonstrated
that even if they set the levy as high as one-tenth they must find
the result far from commensurate with its inevitable aggravation of
the miseries and injustices under which the country was already
groaning. He submitted, however, an alternative. For years there
had been no surveillance of the farmers of the taxes, and it was
known that they had taken advantage of this immunity so as to grind
the very bones of the King's subjects. Let their affairs be
investigated by a special Chamber of Justice, as had been done
under Sully, a hundred years ago, and let them be made to disgorge
their illicit plunder. The yield should be rich.</p>

<p>This was a matter still under consideration together with that
of an arbitrary and not very honest reduction in the interest on
the State Bonds and a still less honest devaluation of the
currency. This last was an old expedient. The louis d'or had
changed its value a score of times in almost as many years. The
latest depreciation, of one-fifth, had enriched the Treasury by no
more than seventy millions, too paltry a proportion of the vast
indebtedness to compensate for the further depression and
disorganization of trade which had followed.</p>

<p>There matters stood on that October morning when a disgruntled
Council of Finance was saddled with the unwelcome collaboration of
a band of <i>roturiers</i>. And there was worse. As if it were not
enough to constrain these proud fastidious gentlemen to display the
sores of the body politic to that plebeian audience, their
lordships knew that they were summoned for the further derogation
of listening to the opinions of a foreigner of no account, a man of
whom no good was known, an adventurer who once already had been
expelled from France. They mistrusted mysterious men, and
mysterious they regarded this fellow who for years had lived
entirely by gaming, a man of obscure origin, known for a dissipated
past, a tragic duel and a romantic evasion from prison.</p>

<p>It certainly did not mitigate his offence in their eyes that he
should in the past few weeks have brought the Duke of Orléans so
completely under the yoke of his spurious charms as actually to
have been a guest at one of those supper-parties of the Regent's
which were the scandal of Paris and to which only the most intimate
were bidden.</p>

<p>For the rest, his very personality, his good looks and a bearing
that so admirably blended pride and urbanity, were regarded as
fraudulent by men who without actually possessing these attributes,
regarded them as the exclusive right of persons of their
station.</p>

<p>They were brought from their lounging attitudes and ill-humoured
mutterings by the sudden opening of the tall double doors and the
loud voice of an usher, announcing:</p>

<p>"His Royal Highness!"</p>

<p>The Duke of Orléans, in grey velvet, a star of diamonds on his
breast, short of stature, despite his high heels, and of a
plumpness that was increasing as he approached his fortieth year,
came in briskly, florid and smiling, rolling a little in his gait,
and smelling faintly of musk.</p>

<p>He was followed closely by a man who, by contrast, was of more
than common height and of a singular ease of carriage.</p>

<p>There was a scraping of chairs and shuffle of feet as the
assembly stood respectfully to receive the Prince.</p>

<p>The late King, who loved to savour his power, would have come in
with leisured majesty, measuring his steps, hat on head; he would
have considered them with the cold contemptuous eyes of a god; he
would have taken his seat, leaving them standing until he had
delivered himself of an address amounting to no more than a
statement of his will, which none would dare to gainsay.</p>

<p>But the Regent had changed all this. Easy-going, affable,
careless of etiquette and impatient of ceremony, he came to the
head of the table, with that friendly smile on his pleasant
countenance to set them at their ease, a friendly plump white hand
to wave them to their chairs.</p>

<p>"Be seated, messieurs. Be seated."</p>

<p>He was bare-headed, and framed in the black periwig, to
correspond with his own black hair and eyebrows, his full
countenance with its shapely nose and generous, indolent mouth, was
still uncommonly attractive, despite the high congested colour with
which persistent excesses were stamping it.</p>

<p>When this congestion, combined with the shortness of his neck,
had led Chirac, his physician to warn him that his hard-living
might end in an apoplexy, all that he had found to answer with his
careless laugh was: "And then? Do you know of a pleasanter
death?"</p>

<p>His expression, singularly winning, gathered an increase of
gentleness from the short-sightedness of his blue eyes, one of
which was perceptibly larger than the other.</p>

<p>However much his exterior might announce the careless
voluptuary, Mr Law was right in accounting exceptional his mental
endowments, and if nature had but accorded him the energy to match
them and the strength of will to keep his self-indulgence within
reasonable bounds, his fame must have stood high. His Bavarian
mother spoke truly enough when she said that the fairy godmother
who attended his birth had bestowed upon him all the talents save
only the talent of making use of them.</p>

<p>Under his insistent gesture the nobles rustled into their
places, whereupon His Highness indicated the stranger on his
left.</p>

<p>"Messieurs, I bring you my friend, Monsieur le Baron Lass."</p>

<p>Thus he translated the Scottish title of Laird, possibly with
intent to command from these stiff-necked gentlemen the
consideration due to birth, whilst "Lass"--to rhyme with
"<i>Hélas</i>"--was the pronunciation the Scot's name obtained in
France.</p>

<p>"I have brought him," the Regent pursued, "in the belief that
the great mathematical talents which have made him famous in all
Europe, and his exceptional understanding of finance may prove of
assistance to us in our difficult deliberations."</p>

<p>Then, looking beyond the councillors, who, cold-eyed and some
with curling lip, remained glumly silent, he addressed the group of
professional financiers, modestly huddled in the background. "With
the same object I have required the presence of you other
gentlemen, who are foreign to our Council so that we may have the
advantage of your expert views upon the expositions with which the
Baron has consented to favour us."</p>

<p>He sat down, leaving Mr Law to bow stiffly to the company before
taking his own seat on the Regent's immediate left, imperturbable
under the scrutiny of which he was the object. These gentlemen
loved him no better for his indefinable air of grandeur in harmony
with the flawless elegance of all his appointments.</p>

<p>His full-skirted coat of heavy ribbed silk of the colour of
cinnamon was fastened only at the waist by three of the small gold
buttons that ran in a close-set line from neck to hem. His bulging
ruffles were of the finest Malines, and an emerald of great price
glowed on his Steenkirk of black satin. The lean patrician
countenance between the heavy wings of his black periwig was
sternly placid.</p>

<p>As d'Argenson was to express it later, to the deep mortification
of Saint-Simon: "Our nobility is proclaimed by our clothes--this
rascal's is imprinted on his skin."</p>

<p>The amiable Regent continued the commendatory introduction.
Monsieur Lass, who had his full confidence, and who had now closely
studied the details furnished him of the state of France's unhappy
affairs, came to them to propound a definite system. His Highness
would say no more than that he should not have troubled Monsieur
Lass to appear before them if he did not regard this system as
worthy of their earnest consideration.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lass, the word is with you."</p>

<p>Mr Law, still cool under those hostile eyes, perhaps, indeed,
stimulated by them, came to his feet again, and very quietly, his
tone conversational, his delivery so easy and fluent that his harsh
foreign inflexions were scarcely remarked, began to address
them.</p>

<p>"His Royal Highness has done me the honour to acquaint me not
only, as he has told you, with the financial difficulties of the
kingdom, but also with the various proposals which have been urged
by this Council for their solution. Of these proposals some, I
understand, have already been put into practice and have proved
sterile, or very nearly so. Before two proposals vastly more
far-reaching in their effects I am informed that you hesitate, and
in my view this hesitation does credit to your judgment."</p>

<p>The old Duke of Villeroy sniffed audibly in resentment of a
commendation which he accounted an impertinence. It earned him a
repressive frown from His Highness, and the utter indifference of
Mr Law.</p>

<p>"One of these proposals is the declaration of a national
bankruptcy, the other is the establishment of a Chamber of Justice
by which it is hoped to bleed the tax-farmers of their illicit
gains in recent years.</p>

<p>"The first--the repudiation of the debts of His late
Majesty--must provoke the bitter resentment that ever waits upon
dishonest practices in those who govern."</p>

<p>"Dishonest!" It was an angry interjection from Saint-Simon, who
had fathered the proposal. He glared at the Scot out of a swarthy
countenance suddenly congested. His black brows, naturally arched,
flanking his beak of a nose, lent him the expression of an angry
owl.</p>

<p>"That is what I said. If I am to be understood, if I am to be of
service, I must call things by their proper names. Euphemisms may
serve to gloze a fact; they do not alter it. I describe repudiation
as dishonest because since the King never dies, the King's debts
remain the King's debts. They are the debts not of the individual,
but of the office."</p>

<p>Before Saint-Simon could utter the rejoinder his fretful air
announced, the Regent had forestalled him. "Parbleu! that is the
phrase that I have sought but failed to find. It gives you,
messieurs, in a dozen words the complete and final argument." He
waved his plump white hand. "But I interrupt you, Monsieur
Lass."</p>

<p>"Nor," said Mr Law, "is dishonesty all that can be urged against
it. Repudiation must create such confusion as to bring the affairs
of the Kingdom to a chaos from which it is difficult to discern the
issue. You will have witnessed the bankruptcy of an individual, and
you will have seen the utter ruin and destitution--almost the
obliteration--of that individual's family. But can you picture the
national ruin, the terrible disruption that must attend the
bankruptcy of the State. It needs imagination to perceive the full
horror of the spectacle. But I will endeavour to help you to
perceive it if you wish it."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary," said the Duke of Noailles, who had never
favoured the course, whilst Saint-Simon with an ill-humoured shrug
sat back in his chair.</p>

<p>Having received that assurance, Mr Law passed on to deal with
the question of the Chamber of Justice. In equity, he admitted,
there could be no objection to it, nor yet in expedience. Because
of the odium in which tax-gatherers are ever held the measure would
certainly be received with public jubilation.</p>

<p>If, however, they would look closely into what happened under
King Henri IV, when Sully set up such a tribunal, they would
discover that so heavy were the expenses it entailed, so
considerable the army of administrators to be salaried, and so vast
the corruption almost inevitable in their ranks, that most of the
plunder merely passed from one set of robbers to another.</p>

<p>The profit to the State, he concluded, was negligible and
certainly far from compensating for all the labour involved.</p>

<p>"By Your Highness' leave!" The interruption came from the
Marquis d'Argenson. Big, swarthy, and masterful in his startling
ugliness, some part of his sixty-three years dissembled by his
heavy black periwig, the Marquis had developed during twenty years
as Lieutenant-General of Police all the attributes of the
bloodhound and in his heavy-jowled countenance something of a
bloodhound's traits.</p>

<p>It dismayed him to hear this adventurer whom once he had turned
out of France, calmly and authoritatively sweeping away the notion
of prosecutions which as Lieutenant-General he instinctively
cherished.</p>

<p>The Regent's nod, giving him leave to speak, brought him to his
feet. He delivered himself shortly, in a deep booming voice that
well became the forceful eloquence he could at need command, so
that as an advocate he was without a rival.</p>

<p>"To what Monsieur le Baron says of the operations of the
<i>Chambre Ardente</i> under King Henri IV I am prepared to
testify. But his <i>a priori</i> contention--nay, his gratuitous
assumption--that what happened then must happen now is
inadmissible. His only evidence is his opinion." He sat down,
conceiving that on this point at least he had checked his man.</p>

<p>A gentle smile quivered on Mr Law's thin lips. "Monsieur le
Marquis will be acquainted with the saying that history repeats
itself. His great experience of mankind will inform him, I am sure,
that men do not change however circumstances may vary." The tone of
his insistence was so courteous as to be innocent of offence.
Without waiting for the Lieutenant-General to reply, he went
straight on: "However, this, too, is an opinion of my own, to which
each of you will attach the importance that seems good to him.</p>

<p>"Let me return for my purposes to the question of bankruptcy.
The notion of its necessity held, gentlemen, by some of you, is--I
do not hesitate to make the assertion--based upon a fundamental
error: the belief that the nation is, in fact, in a bankrupt
state."</p>

<p>Saint-Simon expressed his astonishment in a sour laugh. "And can
you say that it is not?"</p>

<p>"With all the emphasis at my command," he announced, and went on
to do so. They might say of a nation possessing the almost
inexhaustible resources of France that it was bankrupt only by the
utter misconception of what constitutes wealth. The Treasury might
be empty, and the State without money to meet its needs. But money
was not wealth; it was merely the vehicle for its circulation; like
blood, which without being life, nevertheless, carries life and
warmth to every part of the body.</p>

<p>The wealth of a nation lay, he asserted, in the industry and
productivity of her people, in the fertility of her soil, in the
freedom and volume of her trade, in the genius, inventiveness and
application of those who develop her arts and crafts or direct her
commerce. "When you come to agree with this, as agree you surely
must, you will perceive as I do that France is rich beyond all need
for concern."</p>

<p>He paused there as if for a reply, and the Duke of Noailles,
sauve and courtly, took advantage of it to address the Regent.</p>

<p>"What Monsieur Lass has said is too evident for any here to wish
to quarrel with it. But what he describes is potential wealth,
whilst our need--our urgent need--is for actual, immediate wealth;
in short, for ready money with which to meet our pressing
engagements."</p>

<p>The Regent inclined his head in acknowledgment, and his smile
invited Mr Law to answer.</p>

<p>"If it were not my purpose," said the Scot, "to show how wealth
that is potential may be rendered actual, my presence here would be
an idle impertinence. Give me your patience, messieurs."</p>

<p>With a seductive fluency of speech and a lucidity of phrase that
cast full light into the dark corners of his theme, Mr Law
expounded.</p>

<p>He began with the admission, which here seemed supererogative,
that where currency is in short supply for purposes of trade and
the hire of labour, productivity, which was the creation of wealth,
must of necessity be retarded. It followed, therefore, that for a
nation's prosperity, its supply of currency must always be equal to
its needs.</p>

<p>Impatient shrugs and one or two short laughs scorned the notion
of bringing an obscure foreigner to weary them with such a
disclosure of the obvious. Monsieur de Noailles, as if losing
interest, drew a sheet of paper forward, dipped a quill and began
to sketch.</p>

<p>But soon came matter that was to startle him and the others out
of their scornful impatience.</p>

<p>Mr Law invited them to cast a glance at the banking methods of
Holland, methods which had built up her great prosperity. "Methods
which will be familiar to you gentlemen of this Council," he
unwarrantably assumed, "and even more familiar perhaps to you other
gentlemen who are professedly merchants and bankers. It is in those
methods that I discover authority for my own theories."</p>

<p>This brought him to the contention that if it was correct to
hold that the present crisis in the affairs of France resulted from
the lack of currency, then the first measure in order to mobilize
the nation's resources was to increase it. If they regarded this as
impossible, it was only because, wedded as they were to the notion
of a metal currency, they did not at all perceive that gold and
silver were not necessities. Paper could not only take their place,
but it could do so with manifest advantages to trade, since paper
is conveniently portable, easily circulated and readily
replaced.</p>

<p>At this Villeroy exploded. "Paper the equivalent of gold and
silver! God save us! That absurdity is too easily exposed. A louis
d'or from which you have effaced all imprints still retains its
value as a piece of gold. Can that be pretended of paper?"</p>

<p>"No. But if the paper is known to be convertible into gold on
demand its value will be the same."</p>

<p>He elaborated this by the contention that in order to render
paper acceptable all that was necessary was to establish credit,
and so came to his proposal for the accomplishment of this. It lay
in the foundation of a State Bank on the model of the famous Bank
of Holland, but more perfected and of wider scope. Such a bank
would possess the privilege of issuing paper money, which he would
term banknotes; it would discount commercial bills, open accounts
for traders, make transfers of funds from one centre to another,
support trade and agriculture by loans, collect the taxes and
thereby abolish the bad and wasteful system of tax-farming, provide
the royal revenues, and become the depository of gold and silver
specie as funds of guarantee for its paper issues.</p>

<p>"Thus," Mr Law ended, "a general credit may be established that
will offer advantages to every party in the State."</p>

<p>Pausing there, he observed on almost every countenance
scepticism, and on some even consternation. The proposal was too
empirical, too revolutionary, as it seemed, for the stomachs of
these gentlemen.</p>

<p>Noailles had suspended his sketching, and was favouring Mr Law
with a stare of undisguised contempt. But it was left for the
coarse-mouthed Rouillé du Coudray, who as Director of Finance was
Noailles' chief coadjutor, to voice the general thought, and voice
it brutally in a sneer.</p>

<p>"You have used the word <i>credit</i> very freely. I wonder what
exactly it means to you. It should be interesting to hear."</p>

<p>"Credit is essentially faith," was the simple answer.</p>

<p>"Ah! Faith." Coudray laughed noisily. "That is the art of
believing things for which there is no evidence. Do you expect
French merchants to be moved by it?"</p>

<p>"Not if it were confined to your definition. Confidence is yet
another term for faith, and I should certainly expect merchants to
be moved by that. Just as we freely lend money to a person when we
are confident of repayment, so we may lend money to an enterprize
from faith in its future profits.</p>

<p>"It may be within your knowledge--it is certainly within that of
those gentlemen engaged in commerce--that the capital of bankers
and merchants is decupled by the trust they enjoy, which removes
the need for immediate payments. What is possible to every trader
would certainly be possible to the State. If the State becomes the
universal banker, and centralizes all values, the public fortune
will similarly be decupled, and your difficulties are solved.</p>

<p>"But let me widen the definition of credit still further. It is
an anticipation of the future, which it sets in circulation as a
value; or, in other words, it is the simple perception of a value
which has not yet been evoked into activity, not yet been
mobilized, but which, nevertheless, exists and in which we believe.
And this belief is one that may be aroused and stimulated; for it
is a fact that credit possesses this advantage over specie, that
whilst specie cannot be augmented by the mere perception of value,
credit may be so increased almost without measure."</p>

<p>Du Coudray's harsh sneering voice was uncompromising in its
censure. "A gamester's reasoning."</p>

<p>"Just that, pardieu!" old Villeroy agreed, a grin of disgust on
his faded face. "It's the least that can be said of it." And the
snap of the lid of his snuff-box seemed to add viciousness to the
assertion.</p>

<p>The Chancellor d'Aguesseau intervened, to ask a question. "Give
me leave, Highness." His mellow voice was quietly deliberate.
"Setting aside for the moment the question of currency, we have not
yet heard to what extent and by what means it would be applied to
the mobilization--as Monsieur le Baron expresses it--of those
resources which he rightly discovers in the State."</p>

<p>"Will you tell them, Monsieur Lass?" the Regent invited.</p>

<p>"Without difficulty. The aim would be to form a central board to
direct and control all great commercial undertakings, to provide
occupation for the poor--that is to say, the workers--by the
encouragement of mining, fishing, manufacture and the rest, and to
effect a sensible reduction in the rates of interest."</p>

<p>In a voice that crackled with indignation the old Maréchal flung
in the question: "Is it, then, proposed that the King should turn
banker and trader? Such a thing may be possible in the country of
Monsieur Lass; but in France..." A gesture concluded the sentence,
words failing him in which to express his disgust.</p>

<p>It stung the Regent into sharpness. "Not the King, Monsieur le
Maréchal. The State. Pray perceive the difference."</p>

<p>"His late Majesty," grumbled Villeroy, "did not perceive it. We
have it upon his authority that the State is the King."</p>

<p>Ignoring the retort, the Regent nodded to the Chancellor, whose
glance again begged leave to speak.</p>

<p>"The opinion, monseigneur, which I feel it my duty to express,"
said d'Aguesseau, "is that to found a system of finance upon the
basis proposed would be to plunge the State, and consequently the
entire nation, into all the risks of commercial speculation without
the guarantees of that enterprise, zeal and prompt resolution which
able and experienced men of affairs--and others do not survive to
count--are alone able to bring to their undertakings. Shopkeeping
and government are activities that call for very different
qualities and very different knowledge. To combine the two is to
succeed in neither."</p>

<p>Considering the Chancellor's great reputation for
clear-sightedness and his renowned integrity, and hearing the
general murmur of agreement with him, Mr Law already perceived here
his defeat. Yet with unimpaired placidity he was waiting for that
murmur to exhaust itself when support came from the last quarter in
which he would have sought it. D'Argenson had reared his great
black head, heavy eyebrows knit above bold eyes, to apply a check
to the hasty scorn that was threatening to bring the meeting to an
end. He drawled in sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Are we not in danger, monseigneur, in yielding to emotions, no
doubt lofty in themselves, to overlook that we are no longer in a
position to afford them?"</p>

<p>"I should have thought so," His Highness answered on a sigh.
"Another consideration which I would have you bear in mind,
whatever may be decided, is that Monsieur Lass leaves us in his
debt by his readiness to come before the Council. You will remember
this, if you please, gentleman. You will remember also that his
views are the fruit of studies probably deeper than those of any
man of our day, pursued by a mind of singular and well-known
mathematical acuteness." He looked round, and d'Argenson
purposefully caught his eye.</p>

<p>"You have something to add, Marquis?"</p>

<p>"The Chancellor, no doubt rightly, in his wisdom, has confined
his censure to that part of the Baron's system which is concerned
with commercial enterprise. And to that extent I am in agreement
with him. But since he has not touched upon the banking methods
expounded by Monsieur Lass, it will be that he has nothing to
oppose to it. It remains, however, that to carry out that part of
the system time will be needed, much time, the time between sowing
and reaping, and it would still remain to discover what provision
there can be for our immediate needs, which are of a distracting
urgency."</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Marquis," said Mr Law, "has overlooked that which I
imagined to be implicit in my exposition.</p>

<p>"All royal revenues would be paid into the State Bank by the
tax-farmers, and to the extent of those payments the bank would
issue to the Treasury its notes in the values most convenient for
circulation. All those to whom the State is indebted would receive
from the Treasury payment only in these notes, which they may at
their pleasure exchange for specie at the bank, none, however,
being compelled to retain them or even to accept them in the course
of trade."</p>

<p>And now, at last, the Duc de Noailles, the President of the
Council, its oracle in money matters, tossed aside his pen, and
expressed himself. "In that case, Highness, I perceive no purpose
in these banknotes."</p>

<p>"And yet," he was answered by Mr Law, "I do not hesitate to
assert that once their utility is realized, with assurance that
specie may be had for the paper whenever desired, men will eagerly
prefer it to coin. The incomparably greater facility of handling
currency in this form alone will make it preferable. And once
confidence in the paper is established you will perceive that the
bank, by an issue of notes equivalent to the amount of specie it
holds, will double at once the capital which it may apply to
financial operations. For every million in gold, which it will
retain as a fund of guarantee, it may confidently, and safely issue
a million in paper currency." He paused for a moment before adding:
"That, I think, is all that I can profitably tell you."</p>

<p>With a glance that begged the Regent's leave, he resumed his
seat, dabbing his lips with a fine handkerchief.</p>

<p>The Regent cleared his throat. His expression was not happy.
"You have heard Monsieur Lass, and whatever views you may hold on
his system for the alleviation of our difficulties, you will wish
to felicitate him upon the clarity with which he has explained it.
Before the Council pronounces upon it, I should be glad to hear the
opinions of you others, of the world of trade and finance who have
been good enough to attend. If you please, messieurs."</p>

<p>A merchant named Lenormand and one other after him pronounced at
once in favour of the establishment of the proposed bank. A third,
less downright, opined that it might be useful at some time other
than the present. And then the opulent contractor, Samuel Bernard,
perhaps because annoyed at not having been allowed to speak first,
as he accounted due to his rank amongst them, and so as to put down
those who had usurped that privilege, condemned the system in
uncompromising terms. Using arguments similar to those of the
Chancellor, he stigmatized it as dangerously speculative, and
because of his renowned financial ability, he swept with him every
remaining member of his class.</p>

<p>After the last of them had spoken, the Regent thanked them for
their attendance, and gave them leave to depart.</p>

<p>They went out backwards, bent double and clustered ludicrously
together as if for mutual support under the haughty eyes of the
nobles.</p>

<p>When the doors had closed upon them, His Highness required the
votes of the members of the Council and invited the Duke of
Noailles, as its president, to lead the way.</p>

<p>Mr Law leaned back in his armchair, and dabbed his lips again.
It was the only sign he gave of any feeling, and this was not
readily to be interpreted. In his shrewdness he could have no doubt
that already the dice had fallen against him. The deadly cast made
by d'Aguesseau had been confirmed by Bernard, who was destined
before long bitterly to regret that presumptuous condemnation. Yet
one desperate attempt Mr Law made, with the Regent's leave, to
amend the throw before it was too late.</p>

<p>"It is no more than a word of warning against permitting the
views of Samuel Bernard and his kind to impress you unduly. You
will not overlook, gentlemen, that a system such as mine would make
an end of the enrichment of all Samuel Bernards. Their monopolies
would be wrested from them to be vested in the State. His hostility
to my system is the measure of his fear of its success. Do me the
justice, gentlemen, to bear that in your minds. Then you will be
doing yourselves justice also."</p>

<p>He had done, and he sat back again, to hear Monsieur de
Noailles.</p>

<p>His Grace courteously confessed himself persuaded of the utility
of the proposed bank, but he could not find that the time was
suitable for its establishment, particularly in view of the
opposition of the merchants, whose support must be considered
essential to its success.</p>

<p>He urged that, instead, the Council should devote itself to
economies and the suppression of all useless or avoidable
expenditure. This and the perception of the attention devoted to
affairs by His Highness should suffice gradually to restore the
nation's confidence in the government.</p>

<p>The Chancellor followed with the simple assertion that he was
completely in agreement with Monsieur de Noailles, and that nothing
that he had heard could cause him to change the opinion he had
already expressed.</p>

<p>Rouillé du Coudray was another who could add nothing to what he
had said already, and he repeated it: "Which is that what we have
heard is a gamester's proposal, as might be expected, considering
the source of it. The views of Monsieur Lass are perhaps natural in
a man of his nationality."</p>

<p>Whilst His Highness was frowning his disapproval of this
offensiveness, the others who followed to damn the system, damned
it at least in the more courteous terms employed by Noailles.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Saint-Simon was even generous in his opposition. "I
account it excellent in itself and likely enough to succeed in a
republic or in a strange kingdom such as the English, where the
sovereign cannot levy a tax without the vote of Parliament; a
country where letters of <i>cachet</i> are unknown, and where a
certain Mr Locke is permitted impudently to set up a natural right
in opposition to divine dynastic right; a country in which the
finances are governed solely by those who furnish them and who
furnish them to the extent and in the manner which they think
proper. But I can see no success for a system of that kind in an
absolute monarchy such as France."</p>

<p>Only the voice of d'Argenson, in all that Council, was raised in
Mr Law's favour. Unintimidated by the unanimous body of contrary
opinion, and at no pains to dissemble his contempt for it, the
Lieutenant-General forcefully opined that the bank of Monsieur
Lass' happy conception, properly regarded, would be, in fact, His
Majesty's cash-box, and would permit them to sweep away the
tax-farmers with immense profit to the State.</p>

<p>It was a conception certainly worth a trial, and, if properly
conducted, the Lieutenant-General could not doubt that it would
have the effect of easing their difficulties.</p>

<p>It was a stout defence delivered by d'Argenson with jaw
out-thrust and that defiance of contradiction which made him so
formidable an advocate. But his single voice, however, sonorous and
forcible, could not stifle that of the main body of the
Council.</p>

<p>The Regent sighed once more in reluctant resignation, and looked
ruefully at Mr Law. It no longer needed the apologetic expression
of that full, pink face to tell the Scot that his cause was lost.
He could not conceive it to lie in the nature of this amiable,
easy-going prince, whatever his personal convictions, to exert
himself to the extent of successfully opposing the hostility
confronting them.</p>

<p>Once only in his short career since the late King's death had
His Highness roused himself from his moral indolence to do battle.
That was when he had demanded of the Parliament the destruction of
the will of Louis XIV with its provision that Madame de Montespan's
legitimized bastard, the Duke of Maine, should share with the Duke
of Orléans the Regency of France and the guardianship of the young
King.</p>

<p>With the vigour and something of the majesty of his departed
uncle he had then constrained the Parliament to exclude the Duke of
Maine from those offices, leaving himself in the sole possession of
the Regency.</p>

<p>All that, however, as Mr Law reflected, was a battle fought and
a victory won for his own prerogatives, and nothing less was ever
likely to rouse him again to a similar display of energy.</p>

<p>He sat in silence for some moments after the last member of his
Council had spoken, his chin in the laces at his throat, his brow
rumpled in thought.</p>

<p>It may be that this was one of those moments in which he cursed
the political expediency which had led him to set up the various
councils, of which the Council of Finance was one, instead of
governing by ministers who could more easily be governed in their
turn. At last he expressed himself in a weary tone.</p>

<p>"The Marquis d'Argenson, messieurs, has perfectly uttered my own
opinion. It is an opinion, let me say, to which I have been guided
by that masterly essay <i>Money and Trade</i>, of which Monsieur
Lass is the author, and of which each of you has had the advantage
of being furnished with extracts. Had it been otherwise, had I
taken a less confident view of the advantages offered by his
system, I should not have put Monsieur Lass to the trouble of
coming before you to explain it.</p>

<p>"Still believing in it, as I do, it follows that I must deplore
that with the single exception of Monsieur d'Argenson, you should
pronounce against it. However, your unanimity leaves me no choice,
profoundly though I regret it. It remains for me only to declare
the project abandoned and that we must look elsewhere for the
solution of our difficulties."</p>

<p>Abruptly, with a hint of weary ill-humour, he ended: "There is
no reason why I should detain you longer today, messieurs. You have
my leave to withdraw."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>Chapter 3 -- THE EARL OF
STAIR</h2>

<p>There is no gamester worthy of the name who cannot lose without
change of countenance. And although John Law had played for a stake
not of mere thousands, but of millions, his placidity did not
desert him.</p>

<p>His Highness had detained him after dismissing the Council, and
it was as if to express an undiminished sense of esteem that he
leaned upon the Scot's arm as they passed along the noble gallery
leading to the main staircase, whilst graciously expressing his
personal chagrin at the issue of the affair.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more unexpected than Mr Law's reply. "If
I share to the full your regret, monseigneur, it is only because I
see you deprived of services by which I had counted upon resolving
your grievous difficulties."</p>

<p>For a moment the Regent was taken aback by what he accounted an
arrogant fatuity, and Mr Law was made aware of it by a lessening of
the ducal weight upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Ah!" His Highness drew breath audibly, and there was a pause
before he added in a cooler voice: "at least you relieve me of the
fear that you have suffered a disappointment. But let us not yet
despair. It may well be that with the increasing embarrassment in
our affairs which seems inevitable, these gentlemen may be brought
to reconsider today's unfortunate decision."</p>

<p>They were within a dozen paces of the head of the great
staircase. The Duke checked. "Meanwhile, do you ask for
nothing?"</p>

<p>"I thank Your Highness." Mr Law bowed under those friendly eyes.
"I am in need of nothing."</p>

<p>"<i>Corbleu</i>!" The Regent's smile broadened. "To hear a man
say that, is to renew my faith in human nature. I trust that you do
not yet think of leaving us."</p>

<p>"Not until Your Highness tells me that I can be of no
service."</p>

<p>"Faith, I hope that I shall never tell you that." He moved on
again towards the wide marble stairs, where an officer was in
attendance. "Here is Major de Contades. He will accompany you. You
shall hear from me soon again. Meanwhile, my dear Baron, in any
need remember that I am here with an undischarged obligation."</p>

<p>Thus dismissed, Mr Law departed, not without hope.</p>

<p>He was becomingly, if only temporarily, installed in a handsome
house in the Rue de Grenelle, which his steward Laguyon had found
and rented for him. He came home that day to learn from his wife
that in his absence they had been visited by the Earl of Stair.</p>

<p>Mr Law's brows were raised. "Johnny Dalrymple? What a plague
should he want with me?"</p>

<p>"To bid you welcome to Paris."</p>

<p>"Since when has he owned it?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, to pay his respects to you. What's to frown at? He
was very civil. He is to bring Lady Stair and Lady Sandwich to
visit me and some other of his English friends here."</p>

<p>Mr Law shrugged, and found himself a chair. "<i>Timeo Danaos et
dona ferentes</i>."</p>

<p>"Is that Spanish?"</p>

<p>"No. Virgil. It means, 'I fear the Greeks when they are bearers
of gifts'."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that for Lord Stair?" She spoke with the
indignation to which nowadays she was quickly moved when he
expressed opinions in conflict with her own. "I can't think why you
should. A very proper man."</p>

<p>"I have known few more improper."</p>

<p>"We do not judge by the same standards."</p>

<p>"I have long suspected it."</p>

<p>"He will not be of the quality among which you usually seek your
friends."</p>

<p>"God be thanked."</p>

<p>She looked at him disdainfully, and he observed with an odd
detachment how very attractive she was in a gown of peacock blue,
her body springing shapely and slender from the billowing
petticoat. He wondered impersonally whether Dalrymple had found her
to his taste and made her aware of it. For a grievance which he had
not mentioned to his brother was that she was too responsive to
gallantry. Had he done so, William, as her advocate might have
answered that it was natural she should desire him to remark that
other men were eager to pay her the court which he denied her.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll know," she said, "that Lord Stair is in Paris
as the English ambassador."</p>

<p>"It would surprise me less if he were an English spy. The best I
know of him is that he's a damned whig. There's little good in an
English whig. In a Scottish one there is none. And that, I repeat,
is the best I know of him. The worst isn't fit for your ears,
although, God knows, you're no prude. Besides, he'll supply it you,
himself, if you afford him the occasion. Ah well! If all he told
you of his purpose in visiting us was a desire to be civil, we
shall have to wait until he comes again in order to discover the
true reason."</p>

<p>She shrugged and moved away in annoyance. "I vow you delight in
being provoking. It is fortunate that I know how to keep my temper.
I suppose things have not gone well for you at the Palais Royal
this morning."</p>

<p>"A good guess," he admitted smoothly.</p>

<p>"No guess at all. You advertise it by your bad manners. So
you've failed again? It was to have been foreseen, of course."</p>

<p>"Spare me your sympathy."</p>

<p>"La! Did you expect it? At least I can congratulate you upon
taking my advice not to bring Will to France. You are saved the
humiliation you suffered in Turin. A pity you don't heed me more
often. But, to be sure, I know that you despise my intelligence.
Not the least of your errors that. Heigho! And what now? Do we go
on our travels again?"</p>

<p>Of all her tirade this was the only question that he answered,
speaking quietly. "Not yet awhile. His Highness offers me the
hospitality of France for the present."</p>

<p>"Until you forfeit it, I suppose, in the usual way."</p>

<p>"Until then, of course. Meanwhile," he added with scarcely
perceptible sarcasm, "we may be vouchsafed the occasion to improve
our acquaintance with Lord Stair."</p>

<p>They had not long to wait for this. His lordship came again no
later than the morrow: a short, spare man, still young, of Mr Law's
own age, with a handsome, if crafty, face and an assurance of
manner that bordered normally upon arrogance and procured him few
friends. This, however, was subdued on the present occasion. His
low-lidded eyes, set on the very surface of his face, under arching
brows, glowed flattering homage of Madame's beauty as he bowed over
her hand.</p>

<p>"I vow your graciousness renders me importunate," he
murmured.</p>

<p>Mr Law, under his wife's anxious glance, was formally polite.
"Your lordship honours us."</p>

<p>"That is too civil, my dear Baron."</p>

<p>Suspecting raillery behind the smile, Mr Law was quick to curb
it.</p>

<p>"I am a baron only in French. That is how His Highness chooses
to translate a Scottish title for which there is no precise
equivalent in France."</p>

<p>"A translation that does credit to His Highness' good sense. I
am proud to know, sir, that he honours you with his
friendship."</p>

<p>"Do not let us exaggerate."</p>

<p>"It were an affectation of modesty in you to disclaim so
notorious a fact. As the representative here of King George I must
rejoice in it."</p>

<p>"You'll have a great faculty for rejoicing, sir, to rejoice over
so little."</p>

<p>"So little? You don't know what you are saying. Wait until you
learn how much it is."</p>

<p>Laguyon appeared, ushering two footmen in claret and silver who
bore between them the elements of a chocolate service. It was, Mrs
Law announced, the hour of their collation. My lord would do them
the honour to drink a cup of chocolate.</p>

<p>"Ma'am, it is to overwhelm me," Stair protested. "I feel more
than ever that I come untimely."</p>

<p>She simpered. "Most timely, my lord, and very welcome." Sipping
his chocolate at the goat-legged table over which Mrs Law was now
presiding, his lordship came at last to the reason for his
presence.</p>

<p>"If I am here to ask a service of you, Mr Law, I am in the
fortunate position of being able to give service in return."</p>

<p>Upon this Mr Law offered no comment; but looking up from his cup
his cool glance plainly invited my lord to continue.</p>

<p>"I have had the misfortune to incur the displeasure of the
Regent, who, to our great regret, continues to give shelter in
France to the Pretender. There was an unfortunate incident some
months ago, at the time of the late Jacobite rising in Scotland,
brought about..." He paused. "We are private here, and if I speak
freely it is entirely in confidence." He resumed. "Brought about, I
was saying, by the Regent's having broken faith with us. He had
given me his word that should James Stuart attempt to cross France
so as to embark to put himself at the head of the rebels, he would
be detained. His Highness was, as the French say, swimming between
two waters. On the one hand he did not wish to provoke King George;
on the other, he did not wish to hinder the Pretender, lest a
successful rebellion should place him on the throne. Because I had
reason to suspect this, we were not content to rely upon His
Highness' word, but kept watch for ourselves. Perhaps you know the
rest."</p>

<p>"I have heard of an attempt by a Colonel Douglas to intercept
and assassinate the Pretender as he was making for Brittany."</p>

<p>"Assassinate!" Lord Stair was shocked. "Oh, no, no. That is just
the vulgar calumny."</p>

<p>"Your lordship should know, since it is understood that Colonel
Douglas was acting upon your orders. But if you had caught your
man, I don't see what else you could have done with him."</p>

<p>My lord smiled ruefully. "That, of course, was the popular view,
just as it was, as you've said, that Douglas acted upon my
orders."</p>

<p>"Monstrous," murmured Catherine. "But so natural to vulgar
rashness."</p>

<p>"I thank you, ma'am. Your intuitions are as I should expect in
you. However, Colonel Douglas, who was well viewed in Paris and in
favour at court, has left France in disgrace, and some part of that
disgrace attaches, I grieve to say, to me, with hampering
consequences."</p>

<p>Again Mrs Law afforded him her sympathy. "That is shameful!"</p>

<p>"You give me heart, ma'am." Gratitude gleamed from his hooded
eyes. "Formerly I was growing in favour with His Highness, but
since he has lent an ear to slander he refuses to receive me in
private and turns his back upon me in public." He became proudly
disdainful as he added: "For myself this is no matter. But it
happens that I have a duty here, a conciliatory duty, which I am
finding it impossible to discharge. It is in this that I solicit
your aid."</p>

<p>"My aid?" Mr Law looked blank, whilst Catherine was protesting
effusively: "Of course he'll be proud to lend it."</p>

<p>My lord set down his cup, wiped his lips with a napkin, and
explained himself. If now that Mr Law's credit with the Regent
stood high he would employ it in the British interest, his lordship
might be able to do something for Mr Law no less valuable in
return.</p>

<p>"I am dull," said Mr Law. "I do not perceive exactly what my
voice could plead even if my favour with the Regent were as high as
you suppose."</p>

<p>"Will you suffer me to instruct you?"</p>

<p>"I am sure that it is all that he needs," the lady assured him,
to earn again his lordship's warmest smile.</p>

<p>"Brutally stated, the argument to be employed, is that one
usurper should support the other."</p>

<p>"Brutal, as you say. One usurper will be King George, though
that your lordship should say so robs me of breath. But the other?
I don't discern him."</p>

<p>"The other, a usurper at present <i>in posse</i>, may well
become a usurper <i>in esse</i> if the young Louis XV should die;
for Philip of Spain, as the son of the Grand Dauphin, can show a
stronger claim to the throne of France than Philippe of Orléans,
and Philip of Spain is not without a party here, a party which is
likely to grow under the fostering of the Duchess of Maine. That
hot-tempered little grandchild of the great Condé makes no secret
of her designs."</p>

<p>He went on to divulge that lately a guest at the magnificent
country seat of the Duke of Maine at Sceaux, and whilst appearing
absorbed in the extravagant junketings, the literary tournaments,
the Venetian water parties, the masques and the play-acting
conducted by the Duchess, he had used his eyes, his ears and his
wits.</p>

<p>After all, the folk at Sceaux, histrionic in all things, were of
a monstrous indiscretion. Her grace did not hesitate to avow that
she was on fire to avenge not only her husband's exclusion from the
regency, but even more fiercely the project to deprive the bastards
of the rights of Princess of the Blood conferred upon them by Louis
XIV when he legitimized them.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Maine had dreamed of being one day Queen of
France. That dream Philippe of Orléans had shattered. She was
saying openly and on every occasion that when one has once acquired
the ability to succeed to the crown, rather than suffer the robbery
of it, one should set fire to the four corners of the kingdom.</p>

<p>"And this is not mere talk," Lord Stair went on. "From what I
have seen I have reason to believe that she is actively
corresponding with Philip of Spain. The Prince of Cellamare, the
Spanish ambassador, is nowadays a frequent visitor at Sceaux. If
you were to acquaint the Duke of Orléans with that, in proof of
your devotion to him, he would believe you moved to serve his
interests and would be the more ready to listen when you dissuade
him from supporting the Pretender, so that in his own possible need
he may, in return, count upon King George to give no support to the
King of Spain. You will not be the only one to urge this upon the
Regent, but the more of those whose wits he trusts become the
advocates of this course, the more likely will he be to follow
it."</p>

<p>Mr Law was left in no doubt that Stair must be under
instructions to bring about an offensive and defensive alliance
between England and France, and that he perceived a way of
furthering this object by flaunting before the Regent the menace of
Spain. He smiled thoughtfully as he shook his head.</p>

<p>"You put too high an estimate on the confidence I enjoy. It has
been exaggerated to you. In fact, such as it may be, it has just
suffered a setback. And, anyway, the Regent may believe in me
financially, but not politically. So I am spared the trouble of
adding that I am without eagerness to serve England or her
King."</p>

<p>Stair's eyebrows became still more arched. "You're not telling
me that you're a Jacobite."</p>

<p>"No, my lord. I am an exile on quite other grounds."</p>

<p>"That was in King William's day."</p>

<p>"But the ban has never been lifted. Actually, I am less an exile
than a fugitive. A fugitive from what passes for justice in
England."</p>

<p>"After all, Mr Law, you killed a man," my lord protested.</p>

<p>"In a duel."</p>

<p>"But an irregular duel, without the proper complement of
witnesses. No matter. I spoke of advantages to yourself in serving
us. What if I could promise you a pardon and freedom to return to
England as the price of your service?"</p>

<p>"I should answer that I have lived so long out of England that I
feel more at home abroad."</p>

<p>"In short, you refuse?" His lordship's face had darkened. It was
plain that he strove with a temper which opposition was never slow
to stir.</p>

<p>"If I am to be entirely frank, let me say that I have hopes of
my own to gratify, and that I will not jeopardize them by
advocating those in which I have no interest."</p>

<p>His lordship breathed hard. "I may thank you at least for your
candour." Then he laughed. "I could show you, I think, that your
hopes might best be served by serving mine. It is not only the
Regent's affairs which will prosper from an understanding with King
George, but those of all whose interest it is that His Highness
should continue in the regency. And you, Mr Law, I take it, are of
these. Give it thought, sir. Take your own time. You may perceive
your profit in it."</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer, he swung to Catherine, whose
darkened countenance gave him added hope. "I'll never believe,
ma'am, that you share your husband's indifference to life at home
in England, where so many would be proud to welcome you."</p>

<p>"You are too kind, my lord. And, indeed, having lived a
vagabond, nothing could please me better."</p>

<p>Lord Stair displayed enchantment. "Let us then make an alliance
to conquer this curmudgeon. I dare swear that he will thank us in
the end."</p>

<p>"You hear his lordship, John."</p>

<p>Mr Law roused himself from the thoughts sown by Stair's last
words. "I hear," he said, and laughed carelessly.</p>

<p>My lord was content to leave the matter there. Deftly he swung
the talk into channels concerned with the delights of English
fashionable life, of the attractions and gaieties of which its
great wealth made it prodigal. By contrast existence, he vowed, was
almost colourless in poverty-stricken France. He bewailed that duty
constrained him to continue abroad, and eagerly looked forward to
the day when, that duty accomplished, he might return to the
pleasures of London.</p>

<p>He so visibly inflamed the lady by the pictures he painted, by
the triumphs he promised her at home, that when at last he departed
it was in the conviction that he left a zealous advocate to plead
for him.</p>

<p>"Think over what I have told you," he said, as he took his leave
of Law, "and especially your own profit in it. Upon reflection I am
sure that you will perceive it."</p>

<p>He had not left the house before Catherine was bringing her guns
to bear upon her husband. Was he quite mad, she wondered, that he
could hesitate before this chance of rehabilitation.</p>

<p>"I do not hesitate," was the cold comment that drove her to
fury.</p>

<p>"You mean that your mind is made up; that nothing will shake
it?"</p>

<p>When he admitted that this was the case so far as concerned a
return to England, the storm of her anger crackled in unmeasured
terms about his head. What perversity was it that governed him? His
plans for France had failed, as she knew they would. What, then,
retained him? Was there some woman here who had cast a spell upon
him? He had always, she vowed, been the willing prey of women.
Always <i>un homme à femmes</i>.</p>

<p>Was that the reason for his present obstinacy? If it was not,
then to what was he sacrificing her? Was he resolved that her
entire life should be a martyrdom? And what of their two children,
born abroad? Were they never to know the homeland, never to enjoy
the advantages of an English rearing?</p>

<p>Well might she curse the day she had wed a gamester, to whom her
happiness, her peace of mind, her very life were as mere stakes
upon a board.</p>

<p>He heard her out in an impassivity that fed her fury. The lovely
face grew pinched and shrewish, the voice that could be so musical
and caressing became strident, and at moments coarse insults gave
an added venom to her plaint. Thus until at long last she grew
conscious of making no impression upon the panoply of his
indifference, whereupon she sat down to weep.</p>

<p>Time had been when her tears had melted him; but that was in the
days when he had stormed in answer to her storming; that was before
contempt for her licences of temper, for the lack of restraint in
her invective, had killed his feeling where she was concerned.</p>

<p>He had learnt that to dispute with her was merely to furnish
unworthy fuel to her tantrums. He had learnt, too, that if nowadays
she was seldom really amiable, her outbursts were as brief as they
were wild. Within an hour or so of utterances that would seem to
open an unbridgeable chasm between them, she would meet him as
normally as if the surface of their peace had never known a
ripple.</p>

<p>He spoke quietly now, as he turned to go. "Some day, Catherine,
I may find you more tiresome than I can endure. Until then I will
do as I can."</p>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>Chapter 4 -- MR LAW'S BANK</h2>

<p>In the months that followed, months of waiting in the hope of
being yet served by opportunity, Mr Law did little more than
cultivate relations that might, if he were fortunate, be of
ultimate service.</p>

<p>Knowledge of his great favour with the Regent opened wide the
doors of that fastidious <i>beau monde</i> for himself and
Catherine. She, taking full advantage of this, was soon launched
upon amiable distractions. In addition to her husband's fame she
enjoyed the patronage of the British ambassador and his lady, and
in herself she commanded attention by a beauty and vivacity
typically and delicately English that still seemed to preserve the
freshness of girlhood. All this came timely to reconcile her to her
Parisian sojourn.</p>

<p>As for her husband, his closest associates in those days were
the Marquis d'Argenson, who had stood his friend before the
Council; the Duke of Antin, who enjoyed the distinction of being
Madame de Montespan's only legitimate child; the Count of Horn,
that engaging libertine who was a member of one of the noblest
houses in Europe; and the Abbé Dubois, between whom and himself the
link was purely one of mutual ambition.</p>

<p>Dubois, of whom the Duke of Saint-Simon has left us in his
encyclopaedic mémoirs a repulsive portrait, was of a very different
stamp from the other three. Of the lowest extraction--the son of a
poor apothecary of Brive la Gaillarde--but of great talent,
exceptional parasitical instincts, and an unparalleled audacity, he
had known how to profit by a succession of happy chances.</p>

<p>Appointed reader to the Duke of Orléans whilst his Grace was
still Duke of Chartres, he had found his foot on the first rung of
a ladder from which nothing could thereafter shake him. It was said
that he had won the good graces of the young duke by a servility so
base as not even to have scrupled to become his pander, guiding his
first essays in those arts of debauchery which in the public eye
had obscured the great and varied ability of his pupil.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, now that Philippe of Orléans was Regent of
France and--having flung the bastards from the right of
succession--heir presumptive to the throne, Dubois was become,
under the Duke, the greatest man in the State.</p>

<p>His clerical title was a mere usurpation. For any man who could
boast no birth, the title of Abbé served in some small degree to
supply the lack, conferring a vague social distinction which had
been of advantage to Dubois in his early days. His claim to it
rested upon no more than that like many a seminarist who never
ripened into priesthood, he had taken minor orders at a time when
he was still destined for the Church. That he was no priest did not
deter him from seeking further ecclesiastical honours.</p>

<p>Hoping to become a second Mazarin--who also was no priest--he
aspired to wear like Mazarin the red hat of a cardinal. For the
ultimate gratification of this ambition two things were necessary;
political eminence and wealth.</p>

<p>The first he had acquired and was rapidly increasing; for the
second, with the vision that made him what he was, he recognized in
John Law a manipulator of the philosopher's stone, whom it might
repay him to support.</p>

<p>It was to him that Mr Law, whose vision was no less acute,
turned at last for assistance in creating opportunity when weary of
waiting for opportunity to manifest itself.</p>

<p>The Abbé was lodged in the Palais Royal, in the very quarters
which he had tenanted as a modest tutor to the young Duke. But he
had very materially embellished them, and he was known to keep an
excellent table. A wizened little man in black cassock and
skull-cap, his lean sharp face was deeply lined and sunken of
cheeks as if most of his molars were missing. His hair was red and
his pink-rimmed eyes were uncannily piercing. He was accounted by
many to resemble the satirist Arouet, whom the Duchess of Maine was
patronizing and who later was to call himself Monsieur de
Voltaire.</p>

<p>He received Mr Law with effusive purrings, gave him the best
chair and called for wine to refresh him, and then anticipated his
purpose by an admonition.</p>

<p>"It is not by sitting patiently at home, my dear Monsieur Lass,
that one conquers the world. The world does not offer itself like a
slut to be possessed. It is necessary to go forth and subdue
it."</p>

<p>"I perceive it," said Mr Law. "That is why I come to ask you if
you can find me a pretext for reawakening the Regent's slumbering
interest in me."</p>

<p>"A pretext! One doesn't find pretexts. One invents them.
<i>Inveniam viam aut faciam</i>." He glanced at the ormolu
timepiece on the mantelshelf. "I will accord you ten minutes in
which to invent one now. Then I shall take you to His Highness, and
I shall expect a man of your wit plausibly to justify the
intrusion."</p>

<p>Casting about him for this justification, Mr Law opportunely
recalled not so much the Earl of Stair's neglected request for
political assistance, as the information gleaned from his lordship
on the events at Sceaux; and by the time the Abbé had introduced
him to the Regent's presence he had cynically discovered that in
this lay all the pretext he required.</p>

<p>A prince who was glad to dispense with etiquette on every
occasion received him without ceremony in his laboratory, perhaps
the oddest of the many settings with which the Regent of France
provided himself. It was a chamber plainly furnished, with bench
and furnace, fantastic retorts, cabinets of phials, and mysterious
utensils.</p>

<p>His Highness, in a coarse smock, to protect his finery, was
amusing himself with the chemical research which added an addiction
to occult practices and even to the distillation of poisons to the
scandalous reputation he enjoyed.</p>

<p>"My dear baron, I have to reproach you with neglecting me."</p>

<p>This was encouraging. "I have been hoping for monseigneur's
commands. If I intrude without them now, it is because that has
come to my knowledge with which I account it my duty to acquaint
Your Highness."</p>

<p>"Why speak of intrusion? You find me at work upon a mere
decoction of herbs. If I am not," he laughed, "at the alchemist's
more serious business of making gold, it is because for that I
prefer to put my faith in such arts as yours. But sit, baron. Sit."
He indicated a three-legged stool, and found a perch for himself on
the edge of a table. "So you bring me news, do you?"</p>

<p>Mr Law, in some inward shame of his own disingenuousness,
disclosed what he had learnt of the plotting at Sceaux, without,
however, revealing the source of his information.</p>

<p>To Mr Law's surprise, and perhaps to his relief, the Regent was
content to laugh. "Is that all? My faith, let them conspire by all
means if it amuses them. I am aware of it, and I prefer that the
cripple and his dwarf should plot rather than employ their
poetasters to write scandalous doggerel about me. There's one of
them, a disgustingly witty fellow named Arouet--an ordure--thinking
things over in the Bastille at this moment. It is sad to punish men
for the offences of that little <i>cabotine</i> of a duchess. But
what would you?"</p>

<p>Thus, in amused contempt, he would dismiss the matter, alluding
to the Duke and Duchess of Maine in the terms commonly applied to
them by His Highness' outspoken Bavarian mother--as the cripple and
the dwarf--because the duke was lame and the duchess had never
outgrown the inches of a child.</p>

<p>Even when Mr Law found it expedient to add that the Spanish
ambassador was taking a hand in the present activities, the Regent
was merely moved to further scornful amusement. "Cellamare! Bah!
The old rake is probably an aspirant for her grace's favours,
exiguous though they be and he plays comedy to humour her. I esteem
your solicitude, my dear Baron; but it's all not worth a thought.
You disappoint me. The sight of you brought the hope that you might
be seeking me with some irresistible argument for the Council. And
speaking of money, I hear that a few nights ago you eased the Count
of Horn of five thousand louis. A handsome, round sum. Has he paid
you?"</p>

<p>"I have his note of hand."</p>

<p>The Regent laughed. "To be sure you believe in paper. I wish you
could persuade my Council to do the same."</p>

<p>This, thought Mr Law, was his cue. He might wait in vain for a
better.</p>

<p>"Persuasion is vain against obstinacy. But I might possibly
prevail by demonstration."</p>

<p>"Demonstration?" The Regent looked at him with keener interest.
"Have you a demonstration in mind?"</p>

<p>Mr Law had. "Grant me a charter, monseigneur, to found a private
bank at my own risk, and by it I will undertake to prove my
case.''</p>

<p>"A private bank, eh?" The Regent, chin in hand, took thought.
"It will need money, my friend."</p>

<p>"Six millions should suffice as a beginning."</p>

<p>"Do you possess six millions?"</p>

<p>"I possess two. I can create another two by an issue of
banknotes for that amount, to which the original two in gold would
serve as a fund of guarantee. This would give me four millions. The
remainder I could coax into existence."</p>

<p>"In God's name tell me how."</p>

<p>"By an issue of shares--of, say, five thousand livres each."</p>

<p>"And who will buy them?"</p>

<p>"Those who are wise enough to have faith in me."</p>

<p>"It is possible that there may not be much wisdom in
France."</p>

<p>Mr Law revealed that he had an inducement to offer. He would
make his shares payable in four instalments, one quarter in gold
and three quarters in State Bonds, which he would accept at their
face value although at the moment they were worth not more than one
half of it. He would count upon this to render his shares
attractive at least to the bondholders, whilst to render his plan
attractive to the Regent there was the prospect of absorbing some
of the bonds and to that extent relieving the State of some part of
the burden it carried. Nor was that all: in order to create an
actual demand for his bank-notes he would make them payable in
specie of the weight and value which it enjoyed at the time of its
issue. Thus, being guaranteed against any fresh debasement of the
coinage, this novel paper currency would possess the allurement of
a stability with which gold was no longer credited.</p>

<p>The Regent was impressed. He consented to discuss it further and
at great length, until filled with increasing wonder of this
wizardry, as he accounted it, he ended by promising Mr Law his
charter for a private establishment in which, after all, the State
would be nowise compromised.</p>

<p>Mr Law departed well content, summoned his brother to Paris, and
without waiting for his arrival set about seeking a house for his
purposes.</p>

<p>He found it in the Rue Quincampoix, a moderately wide street,
some four hundred yards long, situated between the Rue Saint-Martin
and the Rue Saint-Denis. It did not enjoy the best of reputations,
being tenanted chiefly by money-changers, usurers, and men
describing themselves as bankers, who were no better than
pawnbrokers. The house he found, however, was large and roomy, and
there in early May of that year 1716, when he received his charter,
he set up his establishment, under the designation of the Banque
Générale and the patronage of the Regent.</p>

<p>It became at once the object of the hostility of Noailles and
his following, who feared that this <i>Banque Générale</i> might be
no more than a stepping stone to that financial ascendancy which Mr
Law's exposition to the Council of Finance and his favour with the
Regent seemed to foreshadow. Under the Duke's inspiration, the
pamphleteers went to work to shape public opinion. They poured
scorn upon the undertaking. The <i>Gazette de la Régence</i> in
terms of raillery invited the world to laugh at a folly doomed to
failure.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Bank made headway. Mr Law knew what he was
doing. His money-changing and his discounting of bills offered
rates so advantageous that very soon the usurers of the Rue
Quincampoix were in danger of being put out of business. Easy too
were the rates at which he advanced money on reasonable security,
whilst his paper issue, mistrusted at first, came gradually to
commend itself to traders, as he had reckoned, on the score of its
convenience, particularly as a means of making remittances.</p>

<p>In establishing the credit of this paper the government itself
took a hand. It made use of the banknotes for its payments, and
once the public discovered with what promptitude these were cashed
confidence awoke. Lastly, when it came to be fully appreciated that
the notes were immune from any of those devaluations of specie
which had been so disorganizing to commerce, Mr Law's paper was so
far preferred that men actually brought gold to the bank to be
exchanged for it. Soon it was being sought so eagerly that by the
end of the year it actually stood at a premium of one-tenth above
specie.</p>

<p>The pamphleteers were at last silenced, and the <i>Gazette</i>,
no longer pointing the finger of derision, ate its words and
confessed that the bank was growing in favour.</p>

<p>Commerce, which had been languishing, began to derive a stimulus
from the liberal assistance which Mr Law supplied. Merchants were
encouraged to increase their productivity by advances enabling them
to extend their acquisition of raw materials and to increase the
number of hands employed. This was the triumph of the gamester who,
depending upon the astuteness of his calculations and his ready
estimation of a merchant's prospects, was ready to balance the risk
of loss in one quarter with the certainty of gain in another.</p>

<p>When at the end of the year he announced a dividend of eight per
centum, confidence rose to enthusiasm. The premium on the Bank's
paper went higher still, and with a capital of six millions now in
gold, Mr Law discovered no inconvenience in increasing to sixty
millions his issue of banknotes. With this capital he spread the
financing of traders in an ever-widening circle, extending his
operations into the provinces, where he set up branches of the
bank.</p>

<p>The demonstration of the value of his revolutionary banking
system was complete, and he could now laugh at the financiers of
the school of Samuel Bernard, who had denounced it as an
application of the methods of the gaming table, which if lucky
today might well crash tomorrow.</p>

<p>Because the Regent was displaying in the success of the Banque
Générale something akin to the pride of a parent, Noailles
perceived in it an ever increasing menace to his ambitions. He
regarded his presidency of the Council of Finance merely as a stage
towards the coveted office of first minister, and if he should be
deposed from the former, his chances of the latter would be gravely
diminished. So he seized upon the argument of the financiers and
used it secretly but diligently to sap the foundations of the bank.
He persuaded Rouillé de Coudray and even d'Aguesseau to work with
him to the same end.</p>

<p>"Duty and honour alike," was his text, "demand that we put down
this foreign adventurer, this gamester who has the effrontery to
bring the morals of faro into French banking."</p>

<p>With that same specious argument he was able also to stir the
Parliament into hostility of the foreigner.</p>

<p>In the matter of intrigue, however, Mr Law, on his side, did not
stand idle. Well aware of how Noailles was working against him, he
gave attention to a little countermining.</p>

<p>He began with Dubois, whom he had already bribed with a
substantial present of shares in the Bank, and who, in order to
frustrate the aims of Noailles which were a menace to his own, was
concerned to promote the banker's interests.</p>

<p>The wide mouth of this Richelieu in embryo was stretched in a
grin. "Count on me, my dear Baron. With a little patience we shall
dispose of Monsieur de Noailles. Meanwhile there are two men who
would be glad to lend a hand. The first is d'Argenson, with whom I
know that you stand well. To him let your complaint be chiefly of
d'Aguesseau, who is Noailles' chief collaborator. Destroy
d'Aguesseau and you leave Noailles drained of half his blood; and
to destroy d'Aguesseau I know of no one more eager than d'Argenson.
The Marquis covets the Chancellorship. So enlist him. Then there is
Saint-Simon. He bears Noailles a Satanic malice, and will be glad
to lend a hand. We'll think of others. Meanwhile, go to work upon
those two."</p>

<p>Mr Law saw d'Argenson that very day and complained of the
Chancellor's hostility.</p>

<p>"Ah! d'Aguesseau!" There was scornful laughter in the great
voice. "An able man, but he goes in awe of dukes. That is the heel
of this Achilles. Noailles does as he pleases with him. Decidedly,
my dear Lass, the Regent must be put on his guard against their
slanders. That comes within my province as Lieutenant-General."</p>

<p>To make a friend of Saint-Simon, the sometime apostle of
bankruptcy, it sufficed to announce that Noailles was proving
himself an enemy.</p>

<p>"I confess to you frankly, Monsieur Lass, that I am ignorant of
all that concerns finance. After all, it is a confession which a
French noble need not blush to make. But I am assured by those who
understand these matters that you give proof of uncommon ability
with your Bank, and I am sure that you need not allow the jealous
hostility of Monsieur de Noailles to trouble you. I shall certainly
say so to His Highness."</p>

<p>"Honoured by your support, Monsieur le Duc," Mr Law flattered
him, "I may certainly dismiss all uneasiness."</p>

<p>And so when, presently, the Regent issued an edict authorizing
the collectors of taxes to receive payment in notes of the Banque
Générale, and the Parliament, suddenly mutinous, refused to
register it, Dubois, the secret Mentor and confidential agent of
the Regent, accounted it his duty to inform his indignant master
that Noailles had been the chief promoter of the Parliament's
presumption. At the same time it was no less the duty of the
Marquis d'Argenson, as the King's Lieutenant-General, regretfully
to make known to His Highness that the Chancellor, in rendering
himself the catspaw of Monsieur de Noailles in the attempted
resistance of the Royal Edict had been guilty of nothing less than
a betrayal of his trust. Finally Monsieur de Saint-Simon, his dark
face primly set, offered His Highness the opinion that if the Duke
of Noailles took a greater interest in finance than became a
gentleman, it was clear, at least, that he knew no more about it
than a gentleman should.</p>

<p>Each was gratified, and perhaps surprised, that his comments
should be received by His Highness without levity. Confirmed in his
intentions by the advice of men so trustworthy as these three, the
Regent peremptorily ordered the Parliament in the King's name to
register the edict without further discussion or delay. Against
this haughty insistence it was idle for Noailles and his friends to
argue that in such a matter the Parliament should bow only to an
order from the Council. The Parliament intimidated by the Regent's
firm tone, indeed, shocked now by its own temerity, but deeply
resentful of Law, whom it held responsible for the rebuke, supinely
yielded.</p>

<p>Well pleased, Mr Law bore the news to his brother, who was now
at work in that busy hive of the Rue Quincampoix, and presiding
over its activities.</p>

<p>William Law glowed with satisfaction. "I am thinking that is
fine. It'll make your work complete."</p>

<p>"Complete?" Mr Law tossed his head in derision. "We've no more
than cleared the table for the game I hope to play when I am dealt
the cards."</p>

<p>His brother's enthusiasm diminished. He was by nature cautious.
"Will we not rest content with what we have? So far all is soundly
planned. We've a superb system of credit, so strong that you
command a capital of over sixty millions, which cannot but
increase. Man, is not that enough for you?"</p>

<p>"God save us, Will, am I just a peddling merchant, scheming to
earn a living? Faith, it seems you don't know me yet. What do I
care for the money? It's the game that counts. And there was never
a game for such stakes as the one you shall see me play."</p>

<p>Will, who had none of the gamester's temperament, considered him
soberly. "I think, John, that I should love you even if you were
not my brother. Yet I'll not be concealing from you that there are
times when I think you're very near detestable."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>Chapter 5 -- EXTREME-UNCTION</h2>

<p>The cards for which Mr Law waited were not dealt him until a few
months later. But dealt him they were at last, and the deal
supplied a climax to the exasperation of Monsieur de Noailles and
his friends.</p>

<p>Ever since the days of Richelieu and Colbert, the monopoly of
maritime commerce and colonial exploitation had been granted for a
term of years to such companies among others as the Compagnie de
Chine, the Compagnie du Sénégal, the Compagnie du Canada.</p>

<p>In the autumn of this year 1717 Crozat, who had controlled a
company for the exploitation of Louisiana and the Valley of the
Mississippi, finding it unprofitable, surrendered the
concession.</p>

<p>At once Mr Law perceived the chance to begin to realize his
dream. This comprised no less than the ultimate gathering into one
establishment under his hand the banking, the administration of the
public revenues and the direction of all monopolies, so that the
State should become one vast commercial undertaking over which he
would preside. It had all been foreshadowed in that system of his
which the Council of Finance had rejected.</p>

<p>Already something of a power in the State by virtue of the rapid
and phenomenal success of his Bank, accounted a magician in finance
and reputed of inexhaustible wealth, he could now afford to ask,
without circumlocution, to be accorded the concession relinquished
by Crozat.</p>

<p>The Regent began by demurring. "You will not be aware of the sad
account of the colony which Crozat renders. He reports it in a
state of misery, the colonists idle and incompetent, the troops
mere brigands without discipline, and all a prey not only to
endemic fevers but to actual famine."</p>

<p>Mr Law had been aware of it all and was not dismayed. "I did not
suppose that Monsieur Crozat would abandon a colony that is
thriving. If it is not, that merely casts discredit upon his
methods. Men should not set their hands to undertakings beyond
their strength. I have been at pains to inform myself, and I find
the land of Louisiana of an unparalleled fertility, its products of
an abundance unknown in the old world, its minerals, including gold
and silver, of a richness beyond those of Mexico or Peru.</p>

<p>"Give me the control of this colony, monseigneur, and I will
undertake to rid France of all her debts in a very little time. If
I promise confidently I may boast that Your Highness has not found
me given to vain promises."</p>

<p>He went on to reveal the extent to which the enterprise was
already plotted in his mind. The bait he dangled before the eyes of
the Regent was again, as when he had won the Regent's sanction for
his bank, the prospect of a further amortization of State Bonds;
but he employed it now in far bolder measure. To finance the scheme
he would require, he announced, a hundred million livres.</p>

<p>"God save us!" ejaculated the Regent.</p>

<p>Composedly, Mr Law explained. He would found a company, issuing
two hundred thousand shares of five hundred livres, a price that
would bring them within the reach of all. To initiate operations,
however, twenty-five millions in cash was all that he would
require. For the balance he would accept payment for the shares in
State Bonds at their face value, which was practically twice their
current worth.</p>

<p>The temptation to transfer depreciated capital at par into so
golden an investment should, in itself, ensure the subscription of
the shares, and so provide the necessary initial fund of
twenty-five millions in cash. It would be for the earnings of the
company, in a measure as it expanded under proper management, to
produce the balance of the hundred millions represented by the
issue.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the public debt would thus be reduced by one
hundred and twenty-five millions. In return for what, by this
manipulation, amounted to an advance from the company to the State,
the Treasury should pay the company an annual interest of three
millions, which would be added to the company's profits for
division among the shareholders.</p>

<p>"In short," Mr Law summed up, "the State will be surrendering to
its creditors the property and trade of Louisiana in exchange for
an additional twenty-five millions from them in cash for the
establishment of the colony."</p>

<p>His Highness began by confessing that his senses reeled in their
endeavour to comprehend a scheme of such complex and unparalleled
audacity. But by the time his keen mind had fitted each of its
component pieces into the design he was filled with wonder by its
ingenuity and dazzled by its promise.</p>

<p>It was impossible to hesitate. Eager to see the plan at work,
eager to gather its rich fruits, and more than ever confirmed in
his belief in the genius of Law, the Regent, without even troubling
to lay the matter before the Council, granted the concession by an
edict in which the company was named the <i>Compagnie des Indes
Occidentales</i>.</p>

<p>The astuteness of a gesture which had the appearance of an
altruistic endeavour to liquidate a part of the public debt was
soon revealed in the enthusiastic response from the holders of
State Bonds. These, as he had calculated, were ready enough to
avail themselves of the heaven-sent chance he offered, and to
provide the initial capital that he required.</p>

<p>In the rest of the public, however, the tales of fabulous
riches, of inexhaustible mines of gold and silver, of precious
stones of enormous size, even of a great rock of emerald, aroused
little ardour.</p>

<p>The shares once issued were changing hands at less than half
their face value, which was but natural, considering that by the
terms on which they had been acquired, this was their actual
cost.</p>

<p>Mr Law, however, did not intend this state of things to endure.
With a clear perception of those arts, not yet understood, of
manipulating markets, he worked diligently through his agents to
create those fluctuations in value which are a lure to speculators.
By this stimulation of interest, and by the timely invention of
options and of that extension of credit known as a carry-over, he
was contriving, if but slowly, to improve the value of the
stock.</p>

<p>In the meantime he was active in other directions. He had taken
over from Crozat the ships employed in the traffic with Louisiana,
and he was adding to them so as to possess a fleet equal to the
trade which he expected.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the end of that year 1717 provided abundant other
matter to engage his energies.</p>

<p>The expansion of his financial position from the ever-increasing
prosperity of his Bank and the launching of his company, now
popularly known as the Company of the Mississippi, brought with it,
as was to be expected, an extension of the jealous hostility of
Noailles and his associates.</p>

<p>These included most of the members of the Council of Finance,
all of whom felt that the growth of Mr Law's influence and power
was diminishing their own.</p>

<p>They had further grounds for this in the lessening of the
Regent's former easy-going amenability to their views, as a result
of his increased esteem for Mr Law, who had relieved him of so many
cares and was always ready now to provide supplies for his
outrageous extravagances.</p>

<p>Drastic measures became necessary in the view of Monsieur de
Noailles if this insolent foreigner were not to extinguish them
completely.</p>

<p>Antagonism at last boiled over when Mr Law, by exposing the
iniquity and sheer fruitlessness of the salt tax, known as the
<i>gabelle</i>, urged its abolition so convincingly that the Regent
was persuaded to carry this proposal to the Council.</p>

<p>Respect for the Regent's royal blood scarcely sufficed to
prevent the indignation from exploding into uproar, and even if
subdued, it was, nevertheless, so bitter that His Highness,
shirking strife, did not insist. Instead, he retained the Duke of
Noailles when the Council broke up.</p>

<p>"My dear Duke, I did not press the matter further today," he
said, "because, to be frank, I do not feel myself able to do
justice to the arguments in favour of this abolition."</p>

<p>"The arguments of Monsieur Lass, I presume."</p>

<p>His Highness refused to perceive the sneer. "I was about to say
so, and to add that it is my wish that you should hear them from
Monsieur Lass himself."</p>

<p>Noailles was all frosty dignity. "If you bring an advocate,
monseigneur, permit me also to bring one, a man who will be equal
to meeting the arguments of Monsieur Lass."</p>

<p>His Highness was more than usually gracious. If Monsieur de
Noailles would offer him supper tomorrow night at La Roquette, he
would bring Monsieur Lass, and they could discuss this matter
amiably at table.</p>

<p>To that supper party at the Duke of Noailles' mansion of La
Roquette his Grace invited not only the Chancellor, which was what
the Regent had expected, but also Rouillé du Coudray.</p>

<p>It was not until the end of supper, of a quality to satisfy even
the fastidious Regent, with a wine of Cyprus to mellow their moods,
that His Highness begged them to hear the reasons of Monsieur Lass
for the abolition of the <i>gabelle</i>.</p>

<p>The Scot was taking a moment to choose his words when, at an
imperious glance from Noailles, the Chancellor smoothly interposed.
"They must be weighty reasons, indeed, that would induce the King
to forgo so profitable a source of revenue."</p>

<p>Mr Law's reply was prompt. "If the tax were that, I should not
advocate its abolition." He turned to the Duke. "As head of the
Council of Finance, your Grace will know what was the yield of the
tax in the last year."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, Monsieur Lass, can you suppose that I carry
such figures in my memory?"</p>

<p>Mr Law met this contempt with a polite smile. "In that case I
have the advantage of you, Monsieur le Duc; perhaps an unfair
advantage; for I carry them in mine. In the last year the
<i>gabelle</i> yielded to the Treasury the paltry sum of twenty
thousand livres."</p>

<p>"That is absurd," shouted du Coudray.</p>

<p>"Worse," said Mr Law. "It is ludicrous. Not even a thousand
louis."</p>

<p>"You misunderstand me intentionally," Coudray resented.</p>

<p>"Of course," Noailles agreed. His handsome dark face was
suddenly flushed. "You are not to suppose, Monsieur Lass, that we
can accept your figures."</p>

<p>The Regent languidly interposed. He had thrust back his chair,
and sat with an elbow on one of its arms, a hand held before his
face as a screen to the glare of candlelight reflected on the
polished table as in a brown pool.</p>

<p>One of his eyes had recently been damaged, by a blow, according
to some, from a tennis racquet, according to others from the fan of
Madame de la Rochefoucault, with whom he had made too free. Despite
his doctors' efforts--or perhaps because of them--it continued
inflamed, and his sight was impaired.</p>

<p>"If you say, my dear Noailles, that you do not carry the figures
in your mind it does not seem to me that you are in case to reject
those of Monsieur Lass. Actually I have, myself, examined them, and
I am able to tell you that they are entirely correct."</p>

<p>Noailles sat back, biting his lip, momentarily baffled.
D'Aguesseau, smooth and ready, came to his aid. "That sum, as
Monsieur Lass has said, is ludicrous. But far from being an
argument for abolishing the tax, it seems to me to be a reason for
prosecuting its collection more vigorously, so that it becomes
again the profitable source of revenue which it certainly should
be."</p>

<p>"Of course," Noailles impatiently supported him.</p>

<p>"It is the only answer," said Coudray.</p>

<p>Mr Law looked from one to another of them. Slowly he shook his
head. "A labour of Sisyphus. It is beyond accomplishment."</p>

<p>D'Aguesseau and Noailles spoke together, in a burst of
indignation. "Beyond accomplishment!" to which du Coudray added his
jarring laugh.</p>

<p>"Give me leave, sirs," said Mr Law. "I have still some figures
for you. There are--the number almost defies belief, being the
equivalent of a couple of armies--no fewer than eighty thousand men
employed by the State in the collection of the <i>gabelle</i>." He
gave them time to gasp their amazement and then went on: "These
<i>gabeleurs</i>, these wretched Jacks-in-Office, are proving
ruthless in the execution of their odious tasks; they do not
hesitate, I am informed, at any horror when through the penury of
the people they encounter difficulties in collecting moneys which
have little purpose beyond providing their own emoluments."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lass," cried Noailles, "you are permitting yourself to
defame officials of the French Government."</p>

<p>The Regent interposed with a laugh so as to dispel what might be
the elements of a storm. "Let me protect my good Monsieur Lass
before you disembowel him with your irrelevancies. For myself, I
hope I shall never regard honest criticism as ill-mannered."</p>

<p>"Your Highness' indulgence is notorious." Noailles' sarcasm was
so manifest that it had a sobering effect upon the Regent.</p>

<p>"You should be thankful, Monsieur le Duc," he said, with a
sudden hardening of his tone which served to recall Noailles to his
duty.</p>

<p>It was left for Mr Law to attempt to soothe these ruffled
spirits. "Let me confess to having said perhaps more than is
becoming. It is the more unpardonable because unnecessary. It is
only a bad case that needs to be urged intemperately. To return to
it, we should remember that whilst the <i>gabelle</i> exists in
most of the French provinces, it does not exist in all. This serves
to aggravate the grievance felt by those who are the subjects of
it."</p>

<p>Noailles was again impatient. "That is merely frivolous. To be
aggrieved is the normal state of the taxpayer."</p>

<p>"That," said Law composedly, "is a reason for avoiding a tax
that is not only unjust, but so futile that the tax-gatherers are
the only ones to profit by it. You have, as I have said, eighty
thousand of these. Eighty thousand, living by extortion upon their
fellow-countrymen. Eighty thousand unproductive souls, who if
driven, instead, to become productive by honest work, as artisans,
craftsmen, mariners, agriculturists and the like, must contribute
to the wealth of the State instead of merely preying upon it."</p>

<p>It was a long moment before any of his three opponents, taken
aback as they were by so novel a point of view, could find an
answer.</p>

<p>Then, at last, d'Aguesseau addressed himself to the Regent.
"Admitting, Highness, that there may be some force in what Monsieur
Lass has said, the remedy would seem to lie, as I have already
pointed out, in more vigorous measures to collect the tax."</p>

<p>The Regent's sidelong glance invited Mr Law to answer.</p>

<p>"My remedy is simpler and more remunerative. Of all commodities
there is none in such universal use as salt. Since it is something
that every man must have, it should be one of the most productive
sources of revenue instead of a mere waste as at present. Let the
King buy up the salt pans, equitably compensating the owners, and
render salt a free, taxless commodity of which each may purchase
what he will. These purchases would very soon produce the cost of
the salt pans, after which there should be a substantial revenue.
That is the remedy I suggest."</p>

<p>The Regent, pink-faced, benign, sat back, still shielding his
eyes with his hand, and watched them with amused interest.</p>

<p>Slowly the Chancellor shook his head, his face grave, his tone
quietly courteous. "Such a proposal could come only from one who is
a stranger to our country. There is in France no law under which we
can expropriate a man's possessions."</p>

<p>"It would not be impossible to make one," ventured His Highness
blandly.</p>

<p>"Not impossible," d'Aguesseau agreed. "But, with submission,
Highness, not easy. Too many principles would have to be
jettisoned. The Parliament would be in its duty in resisting the
registration of such a law."</p>

<p>"But if it is to benefit the State?"</p>

<p>"The Parliament may well hold that such benefit is outweighed by
the dangerous precedent that would be established."</p>

<p>Noailles, still flushed, his voice shaking with annoyance,
impatiently broke in. "So much for the legal aspect of the matter.
But there is a graver side. The proposal amounts to this, that the
King is to deal in salt. He is to become a tradesman. Is that the
Baron's conception of royal dignity in France?"</p>

<p>Du Coudray was no less uncompromising.</p>

<p>"It is evident that whatever may be possible in England or in
Scotland, Monsieur Lass is not aware that in France a simple
nobleman may not, without derogating, do that which he proposes
that the King should do."</p>

<p>Noailles came back to turn the knife in the wound. "As you say,
Coudray, he does not understand. So we may at least acquit him of
intentional offensiveness."</p>

<p>"Messieurs, messieurs!" The Regent removed his hand from his
eyes to wave it in protest. "Here are too many words. Far too many.
I think you forget, Noailles, that Monsieur Lass is your
guest."</p>

<p>"I fear," said the Duke with an instant assumption of
contrition, "that I have again been guilty of allowing my respect
for the crown to carry me too far."</p>

<p>Mr Law, quite at his ease, permitted himself a laugh. "If that
is an apology, Monsieur le Duc, I accept it freely." And whilst
Noailles was inwardly writhing at the covert mockery, he went on:
"You have no cause, Monsieur le Duc, nor you, Monsieur du Coudray,
to visit your heat upon me. The profitable solution which I
perceive to this matter of the <i>gabelle</i> had so far commended
itself to His Highness that it is by his wish that I have explained
it to you."</p>

<p>"Just so," said the Regent. "Just so. And the strictures you
have passed become my affair, since mine is the responsibility. In
the interpretation that it is proposed to make a tradesman of the
King, I perceive some ingenuity, but nothing else. A displaced
ingenuity. Almost, I might say, a disingenuous ingenuity."</p>

<p>His pleasant laugh took some of the sting out of his words. But
enough remained to place Monsieur de Noailles under the necessity
of defending himself. "Yet to me, monseigneur, it remains a fact
and a matter for indignation."</p>

<p>"Let it so remain then. I am not to instruct you. Perhaps
because my blood is royal it does not feel the need to boil so
readily. What troubles me is the Chancellor's view of the legal
aspect of the measure. I suppose, Monsieur d'Aguesseau, that you
would account it the duty of your office to put that view to the
Parliament."</p>

<p>"I fear so, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"At need, in fact, you would have to insist that the Parliament
adopt it."</p>

<p>"Honestly holding it, myself, monseigneur, that would be my
painful duty."</p>

<p>The Regent sighed, and rose from the table. "<i>Eh bien</i>! We
must endeavour to avoid placing you under the necessity of
performing a duty you find so painful." The Chancellor, suspecting
ambiguity, looked up quickly, to meet only a bland smile. "I think
we perfectly understand each other."</p>

<p>In the coach, as he drove away from La Roquette, with Mr Law,
His Highness laughed softly. "I certainly think we perfectly
understand each other, Monsieur d'Aguesseau and I. It is the bad
faith of their arguments that has decided me, and I should think
that they will be perceiving for themselves that what they have
received from me is their extreme unction."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>Chapter 6 -- THE COUNT OF
HORN</h2>

<p>If Mr Law had any doubt of what the Regent meant by extreme
unction, that doubt was resolved before the week was out.</p>

<p>To the Chancellor His Highness sent on the morrow the Duke of La
Vrillière, to demand of him his seals. D'Aguesseau, startled by
this abrupt dismissal from office, begged to be allowed to see the
Regent. But La Vrillière had his instructions.</p>

<p>"I am required to assure you that it could serve no purpose. His
Highness relieves you of an office the duties of which, you have
indicated, might in certain circumstances become painful. It is
important that the seals be held by one who in any conflict with
the Parliament will account himself the representative of His
Highness. He also suggests to you that you withdraw from Paris to
your estate at Fresnes."</p>

<p>Perceiving in this exile time extent of his disgrace,
d'Aguesseau attempted no further argument.</p>

<p>All that it remained for him to do before departing was to send
word to Noailles of what was happening as a result of the intrigues
of the abominable Monsieur Lass, thus putting the Duke in the way
of receiving also his <i>viaticum</i>.</p>

<p>Noailles not unnaturally went off at once to the Palais
Royal.</p>

<p>However his Grace might have intended to broach the matter, he
found his cue when he beheld the Chancellor's seals on the Regent's
writing table.</p>

<p>He affected surprise. "Will Your Highness permit me to ask if
this means that d'Aguesseau has resigned his office?"</p>

<p>"At my request," was the gentle answer. "It grieved me, but it
would grieve me still more to have him troubled, as he told us that
he must be, by his conception of duty. So as to spare the poor
gentleman I have required his seals."</p>

<p>"Your Highness, no doubt, will already have chosen his
successor."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lass has suggested that d'Argenson would be an
excellent Chancellor; indeed, just the man to handle the Parliament
if it should again show itself mutinous. Don't you agree,
Noailles?"</p>

<p>It was beyond the Duke's histrionics to dissemble his annoyance.
By that question in an artless tone, it seemed to him that he was
mocked. He flushed as he answered: "I am so far from agreeing, and
so aware of what is taking place, that I beg your Highness' leave
to resign my commission of the Finances."</p>

<p>The Regent thrust out a lip in polite regret, smiling at the
same time, so as to mark its insincerity. "As you please, my dear
Duke."</p>

<p>From red that he had been, Noailles turned white in mortified
astonishment. He stood a moment undecided. Then, not trusting
himself to make any answer, he abruptly bowed. "I take my leave,
monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Do you ask for nothing?"</p>

<p>"For nothing, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Ah!" The Regent sighed. "I have reserved a place for you on the
Council of Regency."</p>

<p>"I shall make little use of it."</p>

<p>The Regent, however, refused to be offended by this insolence.
"As you please," he said. "You have my leave."</p>

<p>Noailles went off to pour his rage into the ears of all who
esteemed him or who would listen. The sum of his grievance was that
France, governed by a cabal, was permitting her finances to fall
more and more under the control of a foreign adventurer, a gamester
who had been turned out of every country in Europe. Under the
indolent regency of Philippe of Orléans, France was heading for
irreparable disaster.</p>

<p>All this coming from a man hitherto regarded as one of the chief
supporters of the Regent, could not fail to make its impression.
The Parliament was peculiarly stirred to resentment by the manner
in which the case was presented to it by Noailles, by some of his
friends, and by the vindictive Duchess of Maine, acting through
Pompadour, Malézieu and other of her devoted agents.</p>

<p>But whilst a powerful party of nobles and place-seekers hostile
to Law was coming into existence, Mr Law, warned by Dubois, who
kept his ear to the ground, was creating a party of supporters just
as high-placed. Admitted freely now to Court, and moving there with
the ease of one in the exercise of an imprescriptible right, his
handsome person, and courtly manners won him friends on every
hand.</p>

<p>In addition, his friendship was already proving profitable. For
the singular foresight of his calculating mind had obtained a
decree by which members of the nobility, debarred by their ranks
from sullying themselves by participation in trading concerns, were
permitted without derogation to acquire stock in the Mississippi
Company. And his manipulations of that stock, with a view to
bringing its value steadily upwards until it should arrive at par,
gave many opportunities for quick profits, in the indication of
which he was extremely generous.</p>

<p>Then there were such other monopolies in existence as the China
Company, the East India Company, the Company of Sénégal, none of
which was prospering, and upon all of which Mr Law had an eye,
counting upon being able presently to bring them under his control.
So he, too, rallied his friends and supporters among whom were the
Duc d'Antin, the Prince de Conti, the Duc de Bourbon, the Duc de la
Force, and, oddly enough, considering the man's intimate relations
with Noailles, the Count of Horn.</p>

<p>Horn, as it chanced, was at the moment deeply indebted to Mr
Law. He had lately sought his advice, which was but a way of
seeking his assistance. He had, he said, unexpectedly received an
important sum of money which he desired to place, and he would be
grateful for the guidance of Monsieur Lass in such a matter.</p>

<p>Mr Law was moved by no particular affection for this handsome,
dissipated idler, a younger brother of the Prince of Horn, and
related to half the princely houses of Europe, which had not
prevented his dismissal in disgrace from the Austrian Army. It was
reported that recently, whilst in England, he had married a lady of
great wealth, who, however, had not accompanied him to France, and
Mr Law assumed that this might account for the possession of that
sum of money which Horn described as considerable.</p>

<p>It did not favourably impress him that despite this sudden
affluence, there should be no mention by the Count of that old debt
of five thousand louis which long ago he had lost at faro to Mr Law
and for which the Scot still held his note of hand.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, pursuing his policy of making friends in high
places and considering the great connections of this young
libertine, Mr Law was prepared to guide him. He had lately been
looking into the affairs of the Compagnie de Gambie, another of the
colonial monopolies, and he had found them in such desperate case
that the owners of the stock would be glad to dispose of it for a
tenth of its face value. He had decided that eventually he would
assume control of it and add it to his other undertakings.</p>

<p>He advised a purchase of this stock to Horn. "Buy all you can of
it, proceeding discreetly. It should make you a fortune."</p>

<p>The Count accepted the advice, and as if his regard for Law were
increased by gratitude, he became more assiduous than ever as a
visitor in the Rue de Grenelle.</p>

<p>Catherine Law, sharing, as was natural, the social eminence to
which her husband was attaining, had become in those days less
querulous, mellowing under the flattering attentions of the
distinguished company that came to pay its court to the financial
wizard whom the Regent delighted to honour.</p>

<p>Not that she chose to acknowledge in this anything for which to
thank a husband who gave her no other cause for gratitude. She had
ways--and they were none too subtle--of conveying to him that she
had merely come to occupy the position that was rightly her due and
to which ultimately she must inevitably have arrived by the right
of her own qualities.</p>

<p>It was a point of view which he, wrapped in his cold aloofness,
never attempted to dispel. Holding it, she accounted it her duty to
entertain with splendour, and set herself to convert the mansion in
the Rue de Grenelle into a Mecca of the <i>beau monde</i>.</p>

<p>One of the many parties that she gave, and this at her husband's
own suggestion, was to celebrate the Marquis d'Argenson's
appointment to the Chancellorship, an elevation for which the
Marquis did not conceal that he was indebted to the arts exercised
by Mr Law in connection with the salt tax.</p>

<p>The guests--a score or so--were brought together from different
quarters of life's higher levels. Diplomacy was represented by Lord
and Lady Stair; the Regent's circle by the Marquis of Canillac and
the Count of Horn; the blood-royal by that malicious young
hunchback the Prince de Conti, and the robe by d'Argenson
himself.</p>

<p>Then there were such prominent men as the gay Duc d'Antin, who
as Madame de Montespan's one legitimate child, accounted himself
superior to his adulterine half-brothers who had the King for
father, and there was Hector de La Grange, the banker, a man of
fine presence, engaging manner and great wealth, who was everywhere
received.</p>

<p>Over a princely entertainment Mr Law presided with that suave
charm of which he was master. It may be doubted if his table could
be matched in any house in Paris. Its plate of gold and silver and
choice ceramics, like the exquisite Murano glass, were appointments
which had come with him from Savoy, together with his Bolognese
cook, his cellarer, and his impeccable maître d'hôtel.</p>

<p>Darkly handsome and unostentatiously elegant from the curls of
his brown wig to the red heels of his shoes, he was seated at that
gleaming board between the angular haughtiness of the Countess of
Stair and the warm loveliness of Madame de Sabran, neither of whom,
as it happened, was paying much heed to him.</p>

<p>Lady Stair was concerned with the observation of her husband,
who placed between Catherine Law and the beautiful Madame Raymond,
was neglecting his hostess in his over-assiduous attention to his
other neighbour. Madame Raymond might contrive to preserve the
diffident airs of a vestal; but Lady Stair was more impressed by
her too-revealing décolletage, which also appeared to hold the
hooded eyes of the ambassador. Her ladyship's lips grew pinched as
she watched.</p>

<p>Catherine Law might have resented the neglect of his lordship,
usually so effusive to her, had she been less deeply engaged on her
other side by Horn. Under his provocation, laughter rippled from
her in a continuous, if subdued, stream, and so engrossed were they
in their own mirth that they had no ear for d'Argenson, who was
being cruelly witty on the score of the misfortunes that were
overtaking the financier Simon Bernard.</p>

<p>It was d'Argenson's way to discover amusement in most things,
since rare in his view were the things that escaped the imprint of
human folly. In Simon Bernard he now perceived that most diverting
of spectacles, a man hoist with his own petard. Because the
financier had feared for his interests, he had led the opposition
of his compeers to Law's system when it was before the Council. As
a result the Council had been thrown back on its other expedients
for raising money, and of these the chief was the squeezing of the
tax farmers.</p>

<p>D'Argenson likened them to grapes in the press, left with only
their skins. Bernard, a master of corruption, had run round in
panic from one to another of the Regent's intimates, offering
millions to any who would employ his influence to the end that
proceedings against him should be abandoned.</p>

<p>"Evidently," said d'Argenson with relish, "the Hebrew knight
failed to find a friend at Court. For he's a ruined man today, and
actually in fear for his life."</p>

<p>"If he did not find a friend at Court," said La Grange, "he
certainly found an <i>escroc</i>, to pose as a friend and accept a
million for services that were never rendered."</p>

<p>This riveted attention upon the banker; for in what he said
there was the hint of a story spiced with scandal. Even Horn ceased
to be merry for Catherine's delight.</p>

<p>"How do you come to know that?" asked d'Argenson.</p>

<p>"From Bernard himself. The unhappy man came to solicit my
assistance and had the impudence to offer me a bribe. He complained
bitterly that a nobleman, one of the Regent's roués had accepted a
million from him and had not lifted a finger to help him."</p>

<p>"A nobleman, did you say?" croaked the Prince de Conti.</p>

<p>"So Bernard described him."</p>

<p>"An ignoble man," said Mr Law, "would describe him better."</p>

<p>"One of the Regent's roués, you said," cried Canillac, who was
himself a member of that happy band. "I hope he named him."</p>

<p>"The odd thing is that he did not. Nor did I press him. But he
did let fall that the scoundrel is a count."</p>

<p>"A count!" cried de Conti. "Faith, Horn, there are not so many
of you that you should let it lie there. It brings you all under
suspicion."</p>

<p>"Under suspicion of what?" Horn was contemptuous. "If what this
Jew says is true, he was well served for his impudence in
attempting to bribe a gentleman. But probably it is all a lie."</p>

<p>"Bernard may be a thief, but he's not a liar," said d'Argenson.
"Nor can I agree with you, Monsieur de Horn, that his impudence in
offering a bribe would excuse a gentleman for robbing him."</p>

<p>"Let us be content to disagree then, Marquis," was the easy
answer, which put an end to the topic and left the flow of
conversation to become general again.</p>

<p>Mr Law was remembering the tale of a considerable sum of money
for the placing of which the Count of Horn had sought his advice,
and all things considered he was wondering might he not have been
mistaken in assuming that the money came from England and the
wealthy Countess, and whether Horn, who had never troubled to
discharge to him a debt of honour of five thousand louis, might not
be the Count accused by Bernard of having practised this
swindle.</p>

<p>He was haled out of his thoughts by Lady Stair's voice, charged
with acid, murmuring in his ear: "Your wife and my husband, Mr Law,
are manifestly in the mode which makes the wives of other men and
the husbands of other women more attractive."</p>

<p>"Has it still the power to surprise your ladyship?"</p>

<p>"And to disgust me. But perhaps I am plebeian in my views."</p>

<p>"If it is plebeian to be virtuous. I do not know."</p>

<p>She turned her head so as to look him fully in the face, and he
found himself pitying her for her unattractiveness. Close-set eyes
in which there was no sparkle flanked a lean high-bridged nose;
patches on chin and cheekbone dissembled in each case a wart; her
mouth was coarsely shaped and her chin receded. She resembled he
thought, nothing so much as a hen. But she was dressed with care
and taste. Diamonds gleamed on the dull flesh of her bosom.</p>

<p>"You do not know?" she echoed. "Does that mean that you do not
care? If so, you are oddly changed since you left England."</p>

<p>"It means, my lady, that I discover no reason for caring."</p>

<p>"Do you not?" She turned her head again, and looked straight
down the table at Catherine and Horn, who again were engrossed in
their mirth, their heads almost touching. "Do you not?" she
repeated. "You amaze me."</p>

<p>What she suggested was as clear to him as her own meanly,
malicious nature, embittered by her husband's promiscuous
gallantries, and taking satisfaction in uncovering the weaknesses
of others. And yet it was impossible to deny that there was some
justification for her hints. That the relations between Catherine
and Horn were innocent enough he could not doubt, just as he could
not suppose that they would remain so if Horn pursued his usual
courses. He recalled how, at one of the Regent's supper parties,
when first he had met Horn, and when oral licence knew no bounds,
the young Count had boasted in nauseating detail of his <i>bonnes
fortunes</i>.</p>

<p>Lady Stair was again commanding his attention. "For myself I
could dare to give a name to the count who accepted Bernard's
bribe. I know of only one man of that rank capable of such a
meanness."</p>

<p>"You leave me to guess why you should be so sure."</p>

<p>Her lips tightened in a sour smile. "All the world knows that he
is hard-driven by necessity. A gamester, and an unlucky gamester,
he is crushed by debt. Such men are always ripe for bribery."</p>

<p>As it was the Stairs who had first brought the Count of Horn to
his house, Mr Law found this peculiarly distasteful.</p>

<p>"Your ladyship is singularly well-informed."</p>

<p>"Not singularly. It happens that the gentleman in his
fortune-hunting has married into my family--oh, a distant kinswoman
of whom I have no cause to be proud, yet whom I can pity, poor
deluded soul. He dazzled her, I suppose, with his good looks and
high connections. Anyway, she married him a year ago in England."
Her tinkling laugh was charged with malice. "He conceived her a
wealthy woman, as, indeed, she is; but her wealth is so cunningly
tied up by entails and the like that he cannot come by a shilling
of it save by her consent. So that of those two she is not by now
the only disillusioned one." Again there was that faint ripple of
cruel laughter.</p>

<p>"Poetic justice," said Mr Law. "And she remains in England?"</p>

<p>"She has certainly shown no eagerness to join him. But she is in
Paris now. She arrived some days ago. But I doubt if she will pay
his debts for him. And I am told that he owes money everywhere. I
believe that you, too, are one of his victims, Mr Law."</p>

<p>"Oh, an insignificance."</p>

<p>She raised her brows and stared at him. "I heard it put at five
thousand louis. A hundred and fifty thousand livres. Do you call
that an insignificance, Mr Law? La! I wonder by what yardstick you
measure wealth."</p>

<p>Mr Law laughed. "I do not trouble to measure it. My business is
to create it."</p>

<p>"Like the alchemists."</p>

<p>"More successfully, I dare assert."</p>

<p>"You'll need the success if you allow such men to owe you such
sums. In your place I should compel him to disgorge whilst he still
has something left of Bernard's million. Perhaps you find me
vindictive. I am when I think of my kinswoman. My hope for her is
that she may leave him and return to England since he no longer
possesses a roof under which to shelter her. He has been living
near St Philippe du Roule in the lodgings of a certain Colonel de
Mille, a soldier of fortune, a man of his own kind, who was with
him in the Austrian service, and turned out of it at the same
time."</p>

<p>Mr Law was growing weary of her scandal-mongering. "Ah, well, he
should be able to find a roof of his own now. I have advised him a
purchase which should yield him a fortune before the year is
out."</p>

<p>But the lady's venom was not yet exhausted. "And he repays you
by making love to your wife. It is what I should expect of
him."</p>

<p>"Let me assure your ladyship that he wastes his time."</p>

<p>"It is for you to make sure of that," she said, and at last gave
attention to her other neighbour, leaving him free to devote
himself to Madame de Sabran, who was warmly genial to all men.</p>

<p>Later, when they had risen from table and passed into the salon,
the Count of Horn came urging Mr Law to make a faro bank.
Considering what Mr Law had just learnt the moment was ill-chosen.
He shook his head. They were standing apart from the others.</p>

<p>"There are," he said, "two excellent reasons why I should not: I
do not care to make a bank in my own house, and it is my practice
never to play with a debtor."</p>

<p>Horn, taken aback, flushed before he answered with a laugh:
"That is to deny a man his revenge."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. From me any loser may have all the revenge he pleases.
But not until he has paid his last losses. There is a bagatelle of
five thousand louis for which I hold your paper, Count."</p>

<p>"And you are pressing me for payment?"</p>

<p>Law suspected the impertinence of a sneer.</p>

<p>"By no means. Take all the time you need."</p>

<p>"You should know that every louis I possess is in the Compagnie
de Gambie."</p>

<p>"How much have you contrived to buy?"</p>

<p>"All that I could pay for. Some seven thousand shares at about
one hundred livres."</p>

<p>"Take them to my bank, hypothecate them for half their cost, and
with the proceeds make a further purchase."</p>

<p>"If one could be quite sure..."</p>

<p>"I think you may be. But be discreet, or we shall have the price
rising prematurely."</p>

<p>"Depend upon me. And now, this faro bank?" D'Argenson and La
Grange were approaching. He appealed to them. "Come and persuade
the Baron to give us a deal at faro."</p>

<p>"You would waste your breath," Mr Law assured them. "It is too
distasteful to me to win money from my guests."</p>

<p>"Must it be forgone?" La Grange asked him.</p>

<p>"Not forgone. But it might happen, and I dare not have it happen
under the eyes of Monsieur d'Argenson."</p>

<p>"Will you always rally me for what is past?" grumbled
d'Argenson. "The fact is that I actually acted as your advocate
with the King. I protested to him that having had you watched I was
convinced that your play was as scrupulously fair as your luck was
uncanny."</p>

<p>"Your agents did not watch me closely enough."</p>

<p>"Eh?" D'Argenson was startled.</p>

<p>"Otherwise they would not have attributed all to luck. They
would have perceived that mere luck could never be so consistent.
No, no. I am never tired of announcing that I win by avoiding the
errors by which men lose."</p>

<p>"Do you never suspect, Baron," asked La Grange, "that that is
something which your good fortune has deceived you into
believing."</p>

<p>"Let me show you a thing," said Mr Law. "It is a crude, simple,
elementary thing, perhaps, but it will serve to demonstrate
calculation's part in gaming. In all your experience as
Lieutenant-General, Marquis, have you ever known a punter win at
lottery dice?"</p>

<p>"I'll not pretend to have taken much interest in the game. So
that I can't answer you."</p>

<p>"Then you'll never have observed that the high prizes that tempt
the punters are on numbers so improbable as to be almost
impossible, whilst on the probable ones the prizes amount to a mere
return of the stakes."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said d'Argenson, "how it can be said of
any numbers that they are probable."</p>

<p>"If the casts are honest," added La Grange, "one number is as
likely to be thrown as another."</p>

<p>"So they say who lose their money."</p>

<p>From the drawer of a lacquered cabinet he took a dice box, and
moved to a card table, about which his guests came clustering.</p>

<p>"Here are seven dice: the number used in these lotteries. With
these any number may be thrown from seven to forty-two. Let me make
a cast with them."</p>

<p>He rolled them from the box, and when they had come to a
standstill the dots added up to a total of twenty-three. "Imagine
that to be the main, and accept it, or any of the three numbers
immediately following, as constituting a nick. My wager is that I
will throw one of those four numbers out of the forty-two that may
be thrown."</p>

<p>"If you are really serious," said Horn, "I will lay you a
thousand louis to a hundred against it."</p>

<p>Mr Law shook his head. "Afterwards I should be accused of
robbing you."</p>

<p>Lord Stair interposed. "Let others share the risk with the
Count. I'll gladly bear a part of the wager."</p>

<p>"As I will," said d'Antin.</p>

<p>Still Mr Law refused. "Afterwards, if you still wish it. But for
this first cast I'll accept no more than a wager of ten louis to a
louis from the Count of Horn."</p>

<p>On the word he rolled the dice from the box. When they had
settled it was d'Argenson who called the score in a voice of
stupefaction. It was again twenty-three.</p>

<p>"Twenty-three!" echoed Horn. "<i>Mordieu</i>, that was a near
escape." His laugh was strained as he lugged out his purse. "Faith,
it was worth ten louis to see you do it."</p>

<p>"If the dice are honest," said d'Argenson, "you deal in magic.
How else could you make them roll as you bid them?"</p>

<p>"Only the magic that lies in numbers for those that understand
them. With seven dice the number of possible combinations is in the
region of no less than forty thousand. But there are only seven
chances of throwing seven and the same number of chances of
throwing forty-two; that is to say, there are only seven
combinations out of forty thousand that will give either of those
numbers. But there are some twenty thousand combinations that will
add up to any of the four numbers I have chosen. In that simple
fact lies the deception. The odds, low at the extreme numbers,
increase steadily in favour of the caster in a measure as you
approach the mean ones."</p>

<p>He took up Horn's ten louis. "If now you care to wager your
thousand louis against my hundred, I shall be happy to oblige
you."</p>

<p>The Count shook his head, and laughed. "Faith, I should thank
you for having made the lesson so cheap."</p>

<p>"I wonder have you really learnt it. If so you will realize that
the principle is always the same, no matter what the number of dice
employed. If remembered at hazard, a quick calculation of the odds
of any throw will make fortune your servant in the long run,
however, at moments she may fail you."</p>

<p>D'Argenson wagged his big head. "I begin to think that the old
King was right. You know too much about these things."</p>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>Chapter 7 -- WARNINGS</h2>

<p>Throughout that spring, the affairs of his Bank were expanding
in every direction and the Mississippi Company gradually increasing
in credit. If the shares were still well below their face value of
five hundred livres, this was no more than natural, considering the
temptingly reduced terms on which they had been issued.</p>

<p>Mr Law moved without haste now that he felt assured of
ultimately prevailing, and he devoted a deal of attention to
tightening relations with the Regent. In this he encountered no
difficulty. He was encouraged more cordially than ever to frequent
the Palais Royal, and was always received there by His Highness
with easy affability.</p>

<p>Sometimes he renewed acquaintance with the Regent's laboratory,
and discovered how wide was that versatile prince's knowledge of
chemistry and medicine. Sometimes he was entertained in the tennis
court. His prowess there was such that the Regent, who delighted in
the game but was an indifferent performer, would match him against
Biron or Canillac or another of his best players and watch with
interest the Scot's display of mastery. At another time it would be
in the <i>salle d'armes</i> that Mr Law would be required to
exhibit a skill in swordsmanship that took full advantage of his
height and uncommon reach.</p>

<p>On one occasion he was again admitted to that inner circle of
intimates with whom the Regent made up those supper parties of
which the fame, distorted by calumny into infamy, was being bruited
through the land. Here His Highness set aside the last remnant of
his royalty, to become the boon companion of guests whose motley
quality was a surprise to Mr Law and diminished his pride in being
among them.</p>

<p>Biron and Canillac were of these, as well as the Duke of Brancas
and three or four others of those whom the Regent described as his
<i>roués</i>, and who gloried in the description, besides less
regular guests such as the Count of Horn and the actor Bouldac.</p>

<p>To the ladies of the great world, including Madame de Parabère,
the Regent's present <i>maîtresse-en-titre</i>, appropriately
named, it was said, Marie-Magdalène, Madame de Sabran, who had
formerly held that exalted office, Madame de Phalaris, who was
presently to succeed to it, and--amazingly to Mr Law--the Regent's
own daughter, the Duchess of Berri, were added a couple of
opera-girls, whose conduct, scandalously loose, was almost a
pattern of decorum to their nobler sisters.</p>

<p>Servants were excluded, so as to abolish all restraint. If in
one sense this was desirable enough, in another it left speculation
of what occurred behind those closed doors to paint a picture far
more scabrous than any that reality could have presented. Yet the
reality in the eyes of Mr Law, who was not squeamish, was scabrous
enough.</p>

<p>The abundant, rich and varied cold buffet, which the servants
spread before departing, was supplemented by hot dishes cooked upon
the spot by means of spirit stoves and kitchen batteries entirely
of silver. Here, whilst Madame de Sabran fried exquisite little
Italian sausages in one pan, Madame de Parabère made an <i>omelette
royale</i> in another, with cocks' combs and carps' roes, and
explained to the astonished Mr Law that the secret of its
excellence lay in an extravagance of butter.</p>

<p>At table all ate to excess, following the example of the Regent,
whose peculiar notion of gastronomic hygiene was to make this his
only square meal of the day, his dinner consisting of no more than
a cup of chocolate.</p>

<p>They drank to an excess even greater, and in a measure as the
wine flowed, the talk loosened. Witty at first and ranging
indifferently over a variety of topics, it would quickly become
ribald, and then, more limited in subject, licentious and even
<i>grivois</i>. And in a measure as the wit faltered the laughter
grew, and in lack of restraint the pretty young Duchess of Berri
was without a rival in that abandoned company.</p>

<p>By four o'clock in the morning, the Regent in his armchair
amiably somnolent, leered upon a drunken company and at last
announced that it was time for bed.</p>

<p>Mr Law, almost the only one to walk without a stagger, and
thereby increasing the Regent's regard for him, courteously
declined the further proffered hospitality coyly pressed upon him
by one of the opera-girls, and came out into the chilly dawn by the
little side door that opened upon the Rue de Richelieu. He awoke
his chairmen who waited there, and had himself carried home,
reflecting that a wise man should sup as rarely as possible with
princes.</p>

<p>It resulted from his having been presented to the gay Duchess of
Berri in such intimate surroundings that he received a few days
later an invitation for himself and Catherine to a ball at her
Grace's Palace of the Luxembourg, where she assembled the very
flower of the Court.</p>

<p>There, at some time after midnight, the Regent with the
imposingly lovely Madame de Parabère on his arm, sauntering through
the succession of splendid scented antechambers, all gaily lighted
and gaily peopled, came upon his daughter punting at a faro table
under the guidance of Mr Law. The tall, dark Scot, resplendent in
gold brocade, white stockings and red-heeled shoes with glittering
buckles, leaned over her Grace's chair, directing her play.</p>

<p>The dealer was the elderly Marquis de Dangeau, a player of
skill, who had the repute of enjoying the favour of Fortune.
Tonight, however, it appeared that neither skill nor luck availed
him against the Duchess and the famous martingale of Mr Law, by
which her punting was governed. Gold and notes flowed in a steady
stream across the table, to swell the pile that rose before her
Grace.</p>

<p>The Regent paused, a hand familiarly on Law's shoulder. "In the
intervals of mending my fortune I find you engaged in making my
daughter's. I would I had more friends as devoted to my
family."</p>

<p>"Your Highness suffers from no lack of friends," said Mr
Law.</p>

<p>"But they--alas!--suffer from a lack of your Midas' touch."</p>

<p>"Is that so enviable? King Midas found it a curse."</p>

<p>"He lived in other times. Today, though I hate to confess it,
there is nothing that gold will not do for you."</p>

<p>"I cannot boast that I have found it so," said Mr Law.</p>

<p>"He is lugubrious," said the Duchess. "Like a victim of
unrequited love."</p>

<p>The Regent pinched her cheek. "You assume too much, Jouflotte.
But I interrupt. Continue to strip the Marquis naked."</p>

<p>"Fie! He is no longer of an age to bear the exposure."</p>

<p>The Regent laughed, and sauntered on with Madame de Parabère,
and very soon thereafter Dangeau got up to announce that he had had
enough, and that whoever cared for it might take his place.</p>

<p>The Duchess waited for no more. She rose, ordered an elegant
stripling who attended her, discharging the functions of an
equerry, to collect her winnings, and commanded Mr Law's escort to
the ballroom.</p>

<p>Side by side the tall Scot and the gay, plump little Duchess,
who was a blaze of diamonds upon shimmering white, passed from room
to room through the dense courtier throng, and so came to the
threshold of the ballroom, whence fiddles, flutes and hautbois were
giving forth the strains of a minuet. Here, in a space which
deference for him had made, stood the Regent with Madame de
Parabère, observing the scene.</p>

<p>In the middle of the great ballroom a square had been cleared
and was maintained by four lackeys, one at each corner, serving as
posts for a heavy rope of scarlet silk which offered a barrier to
the glittering throng. Within that square a half-score of couples
were treading the measure.</p>

<p>"We are too late," said the Duchess. "It was my hope, Baron, to
step it with you, in token of my gratitude."</p>

<p>"And in defiance of your rank?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, I can sometimes be my father's daughter."</p>

<p>The Regent spoke over his shoulder. "Too often, alas! For I am
hardly the model father. But is it possible that you have denied
Dangeau his revenge?"</p>

<p>"He owned defeat, and fled the field. As for me, as a gambler I
am ruined; for I vow that I shall never again dare to sit down to
faro unless Monsieur Lass is beside me."</p>

<p>But the Regent was no longer listening. Madame de Parabère had
claimed his attention for an approaching couple. The man richly
dressed in black was short, elderly and wizened, his sallow face
deeply lined. Short as he was, yet he was under the necessity of
stooping so as to catch the words of his companion whom from her
stature you might suppose a child had not her face corrected the
impression, a sharp, petulant face with a pointed chin and dark,
staring eyes. They were the Prince of Cellamare, the Spanish
ambassador, and the Duchess of Maine; and the sight of them in such
intimate conversation awakened memories in Mr Law of what the Earl
of Stair had told him. It appeared to have a similar effect upon
Madame de Parabère, for she was murmuring to the Regent: "You see?"
adding almost indignantly the question, "How does she dare to be
here?"</p>

<p>The couple in their passage had come close, and the little
golden-haired woman's fierce expression changed abruptly, as she
caught sight of them and found herself observed. She broke off in
her speech to Cellamare, and paused to drop a curtsy to the Regent,
who, smiling, acknowledged it by an inclination of the head and a
lift of the hand. As she passed on with her escort, he answered
Madame de Parabère's question.</p>

<p>"Faith, is my daughter to close her doors to my brother-in-law's
wife?"</p>

<p>"When she permits herself to threaten you."</p>

<p>"Shall I take account of the outbursts of a lady in a temper?"
He spoke with his easy tolerance. "If I were to deal vindictively
with all those who inveigh against me, I could fill the Bastille
from the attendance here tonight."</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir, for your opinion of my guests," said his
daughter.</p>

<p>"It is that he must make light of everything," Madame de
Parabère complained. "Will you tell me, Philippe, what that little
dwarf has to do with the ambassador of Spain that she should be so
close and intimate with him?"</p>

<p>"Fie, madame! What are you suggesting? Monsieur de Cellamare may
no longer be as young as Madame du Maine's friends might wish.
Still, if she displays a taste for the antique, who are we to sit
in judgment."</p>

<p>Madame de Parabère became prim. "That is not amusing. If that
woman had her way, you would be at war with Spain by now."</p>

<p>"Likely enough," he agreed. "So we may laugh when we reflect how
much there is to frustrate such wickedness. There is no lack of
those who wave this bogey before my eyes. Even Monsieur Lass, here,
has been guilty of it, and now behold milord Stair, another of the
same fraternity."</p>

<p>His lordship, all in white, with the star of the Thistle on his
breast and Madame Raymond on his arm was drawn by the Regent into
his group. He was all compliments and felicitations for the Duchess
on the splendour of her ball, full of glib adulation for the
Regent, and then permitted himself a flattering allusion to Mrs Law
which was calculated to sting.</p>

<p>"I do not remember to have seen the Baroness in such beauty as
tonight. Monsieur de Horn is likely to have a dozen challenges on
his hands before morning from the gallants whose eagerness he is
frustrating."</p>

<p>"You should beware of the Comte de Horn, Monsieur Lass,"
tittered Madame Raymond. "A very dangerous man."</p>

<p>Mr Law smiled. "But we'll hope not rash."</p>

<p>"Hope!" She tittered again. "Hope is the dream of those that
wake. So says Lord Stair."</p>

<p>"He reads too much poetry," said Mr Law.</p>

<p>"Horn writes it," the Regent warned him. "For a gentleman, a
rather gifted rhymster. It ensures him a welcome at Madame du
Maine's poetical court at Sceaux."</p>

<p>"Take heed, Baron," the Duchess rallied. "He looks as if he
might be making verses now."</p>

<p>Following the direction of her glance across the thronged
ballroom, to a semi-circular alcove, his eyes had found his wife.
She occupied a little rounded settle placed under a white statue of
Diana, and the lower half of her face was screened by her fan.</p>

<p>Her petticoat of lace frills and rosebuds on a ground of ivory
satin filled the settle on either side of her, so that there was
room for no one else. But over the back of it, his youthful head
almost touching hers at moments, leaned the Count of Horn, in an
attitude infinitely more intimate than any in which he might have
sat beside her.</p>

<p>Mr Law was at his ease. "If that be so, I can trust Madame Law
to supply him with all the rhymes for impudence that he may
need."</p>

<p>"Sublime faith!" Stair mocked him.</p>

<p>"And fortunate for Monsieur de Horn," laughed the Duchess.
"Monsieur Lass, if what we have heard is true, has not always been
quite so trusting."</p>

<p>"I have not always had the same grounds for trust," said he.
"But give me leave. It is possible that this good Monsieur de Horn
is waiting to be relieved." Bowing, he detached himself from the
group, leaving the Duchess in the care of the Marquis de Canillac,
and was gone.</p>

<p>Stair's eyes followed him balefully. He found himself suddenly
alone with Madame Raymond. The Regent and his ladies had moved off
into the ballroom, where the minuet was now coming to its end.</p>

<p>"Insolent upstart," he muttered under his breath.</p>

<p>Tinkling laughter answered him from his companion. "Horn will
lower his crest for him. It's but a question of time with that
<i>homme à femmes</i>, once he's committed to the chase."</p>

<p>"I wish him luck, and, faith, he'll need it. The Laird of
Lauriston can be dangerous."</p>

<p>She was scornful. "So I've heard. But he does not look dangerous
now. At least he seems to know his place."</p>

<p>Mr Law had joined his wife and Horn, and could be seen
addressing the Count with every sign of courteous affability before
offering his arm to Catherine.</p>

<p>"You must beware, my dear, of abusing the graciousness of
Monsieur le Comte by too long an encroachment upon his
attention."</p>

<p>Horn wondered, was he mocked, but deemed it best to take the
speech at its face value. "Sir," he protested, "you state the
opposite of the fact. The encroachment was mine; the graciousness
madame's."</p>

<p>"That is to smother all in condescension. We take our leave,
monsieur."</p>

<p>He bowed. Catherine sank in a curtsy, extending a languid hand.
Horn, raising her by it, bore her fingers to his lips, with a
murmured "Serviteur!"</p>

<p>Not until they were home, and the sleek Laguyon had ministered
to their needs and been dismissed, whilst Catherine, herself, was
on the point of withdrawing, did Mr Law offer any comment.</p>

<p>"A moment, Catherine, if you please. I have a word to say."</p>

<p>On her way to the door she paused and half turned. The
ungraciousness of her tone was normal and calculated. "Will it not
keep until morning? My woman is waiting to undress me."</p>

<p>"I will make it brief," he assured her, coldly courteous.
"Indeed, no more than a word. A word of warning."</p>

<p>"Of warning?" Her brows were puckered.</p>

<p>"Against abusing this graciousness of Monsieur de Horn. That was
how I described it to him. But I doubt he has no sense of irony.
Probably little sense of any kind. A mere animal."</p>

<p>She had swung completely round and was staring at him. A sudden
pallor overspread her face. There was a queer light in her eyes, a
queer smile parting her full lips, almost an eagerness in her
voice. "My God! Is it possible that you are jealous?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. It is not possible. But I do not care to be the butt
of ribaldries. I do not care to be told, as I was told by Lord
Stair's Madame Raymond, that Monsieur de Horn is a dangerous man.
You will oblige me, Catherine, by remembering it."</p>

<p>The abrupt change in her expression might have been revealing
had he been properly attentive. The queer, almost eager little
smile perished on lips that were suddenly distorted. From pale that
they had been, her face and neck were scarlet now. Her eyes blazed.
From the depths of her indignation she seemed unable to draw
words.</p>

<p>But he was not looking at her. "It may profit you also," he was
adding, "to remember another man who was reputed dangerous."</p>

<p>"Is that a threat?"</p>

<p>"To Monsieur le Comte, perhaps."</p>

<p>Her anger boiled over at last. She struck to wound, blindly.
"You fool! Do you think a man of his blood would cross swords with
a...a...professional gambler?"</p>

<p>He smiled and sighed as he answered. "So that already you
compare me to my disadvantage with your <i>cicisbeo</i>. No matter.
You are warned. I'll not detain you. I have no more to say."</p>

<p>"But I have," she cried, which need not have surprised him; and
thereafter she said it, pouring over him a torrent of words that
held little sense. "I am warned, am I? Of what am I warned? What is
there, do you suppose, that I can fear? Nothing that you could do.
Embroil yourself if you choose with the Count of Horn. He will
break you for your pains; break you like the rotten make-believe
you are. Who are you, what are you, to match yourself with a man of
his quality, to vent your evil spleen for no better reason than
because he chooses to be my friend?"</p>

<p>Her anger mounting ever, fanned perhaps by the cold impassivity
in which he stood before her, she raged on: "Am I to deny myself
all friends because I have the misfortune to be your wife? Your
wife! When I am not even that. Your victim; your prisoner. You are
a fool to suppose a woman would submit to it. And, anyway, you had
better understand that I am not that woman. And what manner of
husband are you that you dare to reproach me with encouraging
gallantries? Why should I not, if it suits my inclination? What
fidelity do I owe you? How many infidelities of yours have I not
endured and condoned in these miserable years? You warn me, do you?
Let me warn you in my turn that I am no man's slave and no man's
chattel. I belong to myself. Understand that. I'll have the
bestowal of myself as to me seems best."</p>

<p>She paused there a moment, staring at him; as if waiting for his
reply. But as he offered none, either in defence or in
remonstrance, she finally exploded, sobbing: "So now you, too, are
warned."</p>

<p>On that she swung round again, and swept weeping in fury from
the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>Chapter 8 -- INVITATIONS</h2>

<p>Those summer days were busy days for Mr Law, perfecting his
measures for the entire control of all French colonial possessions,
of America, Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the news from Louisiana was far from good. Of the
precious metals in which the land had been described as rich,
little or nothing was yet being extracted; no more was heard of the
fabulous ubiquity of precious stones, the reports of which had
served to build up the credit of the Mississippi Company and
attract buyers for the shares.</p>

<p>None of this perturbed Mr Law. The gold and silver and the gems
might or might not exist; but the fertility and productivity of the
land were facts upon which he could confidently count to yield the
riches he promised to his shareholders. Meanwhile he was careful to
suppress the unfavourable reports he had received, lest their
publication should have an unnecessarily discouraging effect not
only upon the stock of the Mississippi Company but upon that of
those other companies which it was already rumoured that Mr Law
would shortly be controlling.</p>

<p>His social consequence standing already so high under the
Regent's patronage, earned him in those summer days an invitation
to spend a week at Sceaux.</p>

<p>It came as a surprise, for whilst he had enjoyed the honour of
presentation to the Duke and Duchess of Maine, he could hardly
conceive that the pursuits to which he owed his fame would commend
him to a lady who, outside of the noblesse, sought only wits and
men of letters, both to promote and to share in the delights of her
court at Sceaux.</p>

<p>"<i>Semper sursum</i>," was his comment to Catherine, with whom,
as was usual, relations had resumed their coldly courteous normal
after the explosion on the night of the Duchess of Berri's ball.
"<i>Semper sursum</i>. Ever upwards. I may be the ignoble
adventurer you like to account me, but it remains that I carry you
from height to height. Our company is desired by her Grace of
Maine, no less, the lady with secret aspirations to be Queen of
France."</p>

<p>He thrust before her the scented note from the Duchess'
secretary Malézieux. It was charged with the device of a hive and a
bee, emblems of the Society of the <i>Mouche-à-miel</i>, the
invention and presidency of which made up the affectation under
whose cover her Grace pursued the more dangerous affectation of
conspiring.</p>

<p>Catherine looked it over coolly. "Ah, yes," she said. "The Count
of Horn had told me to expect it."</p>

<p>She made the statement with such calm that her husband not
unreasonably suspected defiance. Despite his warning she had
continued to encourage the Count's frequent visits in the Rue de
Grenelle and his regular attendance upon her on every occasion of
their frequent meetings elsewhere.</p>

<p>Latterly Mr Law's brother had mentioned to him that there was
talk of her constantly being seen with Horn among the fashionable
riders who frequented that chestnut-bordered avenue along the
river, the Cours la Reine. Mr Law fully aware of this, observing
it, knowing himself deliberately defied, continued amiably
indifferent, adding no word to the representations he had made. It
was a silence that left Catherine vaguely uneasy, secretly
tormented by suspense, and it was in a passionate desire to end it
that she flung down the name of Horn like a gage of battle.</p>

<p>"The Count of Horn?" he echoed reflectively. "So that is the
explanation. I was puzzled to think why our company should be
desired at Sceaux, and hardly flattered."</p>

<p>"Not flattered? You are exigent. We could be paid no higher
compliment short of a command to Versailles."</p>

<p>"That, of course, will be the view of Monsieur de Horn. It does
not accord with mine. I owe my loyalties to His Highness, the
Regent, and unlike your Monsieur de Horn, I give my loyalties where
they are due."</p>

<p>"What do you imply against him?"</p>

<p>"That affecting devotion to the Regent, he would do better to
hold aloof from that court of discontent, the household of the
Maines, where calumny of His Highness is the least of the offences,
and treason the worst. It is of a piece with all the rest I know of
your Monsieur de Horn, an <i>escroc</i>, contemptible and
faithless. If you felt the need to pick a gallant, it would have
been more flattering to me to have picked one less
disreputable."</p>

<p>"I was not concerned to flatter you."</p>

<p>"You make it evident."</p>

<p>"Nor does slander affect my esteem for a great gentleman."</p>

<p>"Slander?" He uttered a short laugh. "A rascal who was kicked
out of the Austrian Army, an <i>escroc</i> who is in everybody's
debt, a swindler who takes money--a million--from Bernard the Jew
for corrupt services which he neglects to render. That is your
great gentleman. Be proud of deserving his attention."</p>

<p>"Lies will not diminish that pride. And when we go to
Sceaux..."</p>

<p>"We do not go to Sceaux."</p>

<p>Dismay loosened her mouth. "How? Not go to Sceaux? You would
dare to refuse what amounts to a royal command?"</p>

<p>"I have given you my views on Sceaux and its activities. That
should suffice."</p>

<p>"Very well. As you please." She stood tense and quivering. "But
understand that whether you go or not, I certainly shall."</p>

<p>"Ah!" He merely sighed. "That would give rise to comment. I
mean, if you went without me."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you will perceive also the propriety of
accompanying me."</p>

<p>He strove with his impatience. "I have tried to tell you that
loyalty to His Highness makes it impossible that I should go."</p>

<p>"That is but a pretext. The Duke and Duchess of Maine were at
the Duchess of Berri's ball at the Luxembourg. How, then, can you
talk of disloyalty in good relations with those whom even the
Regent's daughter receives? Besides, there is no reason why I
should be bound by such ties of loyalty as yours."</p>

<p>"Or any other ties, it seems."</p>

<p>"Or any other ties," she agreed. "So make your decision without
regard for me. For whatever you may decide, I shall certainly be
the Duchess of Maine's guest." She turned to go. "You
understand?"</p>

<p>Very quietly he answered her. "I understand that I have Monsieur
de Horn to thank for this defiance, and that he becomes too
troublesome. It has never been my way to prevail with you by
violence, Catherine, and since I cannot prevail with you by reason,
I must hope to do better with your Count."</p>

<p>She turned again, to face him, and she had lost some breath,
"Are you mad? How do you suppose that he will receive you? Do you
dream that a man of his station will tolerate your
impertinences?"</p>

<p>"Reassure yourself. I shall be strictly pertinent."</p>

<p>She gave him a long, silent look of dislike. Then she shrugged.
"You must rush upon your ruin if you will."</p>

<p>On that she left him, and it was some moments before he moved.
He was roused by the clock on the overmantel striking the hour of
ten, the hour at which almost invariably he paid his morning visit
to the Rue Quincampoix, to cast his expert eye over the operations
of the day and issue instructions for the guidance of his brother,
who remained as his deputy on the spot.</p>

<p>Suddenly realizing that he was late, he cast off the gloomy
absorption in which Catherine had left him and was moving towards
the door, when it was opened by a footman. With a murmured apology,
the man would have withdrawn again, but that Mr Law checked
him.</p>

<p>"What is it, Gilles?"</p>

<p>"Pardon, monsieur. I am seeking Madame. It is that Monsieur le
Comte de Horn is here."</p>

<p>"Here? Then why do you not introduce him?"</p>

<p>"He is below, monsieur, on horseback. I am sent to inquire if
Madame will be riding with him this morning."</p>

<p>Mr Law glanced at the timepiece. He drew a bow at a venture.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Comte is rather early."</p>

<p>"I think not, monsieur. This is his usual hour."</p>

<p>It was what Mr Law desired to know. These morning rides, then,
slyly undertaken in his absence, were something of a regular
practice. No wonder that tongues were wagging and that a rumour of
scandal had reached the ears of his brother.</p>

<p>From the tranquillity of Mr Law's countenance, the footman could
gather no hint of the indignation within him. "Ask Monsieur le
Comte to give himself the trouble of coming up."</p>

<p>The footman bowed himself out, to return presently ushering the
visitor. Horn, booted, spurred and handling a riding switch, came
in briskly, his manner effusive. "My dear Baron! I had no thought
to intrude upon you. It is Madame la Baronne whom I seek, for the
honour of escorting her should she choose to ride this morning. I
trust I do not disturb you."</p>

<p>"In fact," said Mr Law, "you begin to disturb me a good
deal."</p>

<p>"How?" The handsome face became serious, the tall figure was
drawn stiffly to its full height.</p>

<p>"It occurs to me that Madame may have been riding with you too
often lately." He spoke with the utmost urbanity. "It is giving
rise to talk. You would not know that, of course. But now that I
tell you, I am sure you will agree that she should decline the
honour for the future."</p>

<p>The young Count, at his ease, smiled with a touch of insolence.
"I understand. If you assure me that it is Madame la Baronne's
wish, I must regretfully bow to it."</p>

<p>"I can assure you that it is mine," said Mr Law. Quickly,
without giving the other time to speak, he went on: "And there is
another matter on which I am glad of a word with you. I understand
that it is by your good offices that we are honoured with an
invitation to Sceaux. It is flattering, but unhappily my affairs,
as you will understand, do not permit me to be absent from Paris
just at present. We shall, therefore, be reluctantly constrained to
decline that honour also."</p>

<p>The Count's face had darkened; his manner became more distant.
"That your affairs should keep you here was more or less to be
expected. A money-changer--your pardon, a banker--must wait upon
his clients. But, to be frank, my dear Baron, I perceive in that no
reason to deny Madame la Baronne the entertainment Sceaux will
offer her. The Countess of Horn, who returned a little while ago
from England and who is a compatriot of the Baroness, will be
accompanying me to Sceaux, and we shall be happy to have your lady
with us."</p>

<p>"Even so, however, too much honour. I do not choose that my wife
should go without me."</p>

<p>For all that from the outset Horn had been conscious of the
hostility under the courtly phrases, the steel under the silk, he
was now momentarily at a loss. He stumbled a little in his protest.
"For that, in the circumstances, I think I have the right to ask a
reason."</p>

<p>"It is the same as the reason why I do not wish that Madame la
Baronne should ride with you again."</p>

<p>Horn flushed. His temper was beginning to slip from him. "Do you
know, my dear Lass, that I begin to find you almost offensive."</p>

<p>"Is it possible? It is an impression that I have earnestly
sought not to convey."</p>

<p>"Then let me tell you that you fail. I have no more to say to
you, I think." He bowed perfunctorily. "I shall have the honour to
wait upon Madame la Baronne, to take her wishes in the matter of
Sceaux."</p>

<p>"A moment, Monsieur le Comte. It is foolish not to perceive that
my wishes are those that count, and you are already aware of them.
I fear you compel me reluctantly to inform my servants that you are
not again to be admitted."</p>

<p>The Count's face was suddenly white. He lost his head. Perhaps
he forgot how deeply he stood in this man's debt; or perhaps, in
his passion and arrogance, he did not choose to remember it. His
hand tightened on his whip. "<i>Canaille</i>!" he said, through his
teeth, and yielding to an impulse of passion he slashed at Mr Law's
face.</p>

<p>Only by promptly raising his arm did the Scot save his
countenance. Even as he parried, his hand closed over the whip and
a swift wrench snatched it from Horn's hand. Mr Law bowed, calmly
ironical.</p>

<p>"So much was not necessary, monsieur. But at least it has the
advantage of being definite. My friends shall wait upon you today."
And he cast the whip at the Count's feet.</p>

<p>"On me? Your friends? My God! Have you the impudence to conceive
I'll meet you? Do men of my quality fight with money-changers? It
may be done in England, or, perhaps, in Scotland."</p>

<p>Mr Law looked at him steadily without replying, whilst Horn
continued.</p>

<p>"It does not happen in France, let me tell you, my good fellow."
He shook and slobbered in rage, and all the while Mr Law, with the
imperturbability of the complete gamester in the face of whatever
stake may be on the board, continued steadily to stare at him. "For
low rascals who forget their place a gentleman has a cane or a
whip, as you've discovered."</p>

<p>He stooped to recover his whip, whereby he lost some dignity.
Then resuming it, he turned on his heel and stalked towards the
door.</p>

<p>"At your pleasure," said Mr Law. "After all, there are weapons
more suitable than the sword for <i>escrocs</i> and cheats and such
folk who forget the obligations birth imposes. I shall see that you
discover it, Monsieur le Comte."</p>

<p>But the Count had already reached the threshold, and gave no
heed.</p>

<p>"Well, well! You go off with the honours," Mr Law called after
him. "For today."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>Chapter 9 -- THE GAMBIE STOCK</h2>

<p>Mr Law came on a Monday morning of July into the room above
stairs, which he had made his own in the Rue Quincampoix. It was
the best room in the house, spacious and furnished so as to provide
a characteristic setting for its fastidious tenant. A heavy
Aubusson carpet covered the floor. Two tall Venetian mirrors in
rococo bronze frames rose above swag-bellied consoles in marquetry
and ormolu, and between them on the sage-green panelling there was
a replica from the master's hand of the triple portrait of the
First Charles, which Van Dyke had painted for the purposes of
Bernini.</p>

<p>An affection for the Stuarts was natural in a well-bred Scot
even when a kinsman of Argyle's. A rustic scene by Watteau, gay
with colour and sunshine, and a couple of mezzotints by Carpi
decorated the opposite wall. A great writing table of rosewood, on
cabriole legs with massive ormolu incrustations, stood in the
middle of the floor. The windows--there were two of them, opening
on to a narrow balcony--stood wide to the warmth of the morning and
the sounds of the street below.</p>

<p>The establishment there of Law's Banque Générale had already
created in the Rue Quincampoix an activity very different from that
which it had formerly known. It had been increased by the
foundation of the Mississippi Company and the traffic in its
shares, and this increase had steadily grown and was being further
swollen of late by the confident rumours that Monsieur Lass would
shortly be assuming the control of other named colonial monopolies,
in the depreciated stocks of which men were already dealing
freely.</p>

<p>Mr Law seated himself at his writing table, which was quite
bare, save for an inkstand in black onyx and silver, a silver
pounce box and a tray of cut quills. In a moment, by the door which
he had left open, his brother followed him into the room.</p>

<p>"Good morning, John."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Will. You have your notebook, I see."</p>

<p>"As you requested. And what of Catherine? Have you no word from
Sceaux?"</p>

<p>"No direct word, since she went in spite of my wishes. It was
not to be expected." He spoke without heat. "But I receive my
reports. By these Catherine is a great success with the wits of
Sceaux."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Yet, greatly as I esteem her, I should hardly be
describing Catherine as witty."</p>

<p>"Would you not? My dear Will, in a woman a fair face and a white
breast are a form of wit that's most esteemed by men. She does not
appear to be quite such a success with the women. Her conduct with
Monsieur de Horn, I hear, lacks reticence, though why that should
fail to commend her to the <i>beau monde</i> is not readily to be
understood. Perhaps her sisters, made censorious because suffering
from neglect, are virtuous in spite of themselves."</p>

<p>William, something of a puritan, considered him with grave
disapproval. "Will you really be as patient as you pretend?"</p>

<p>"I have no cause to be other."</p>

<p>"Whilst the Count of Horn..."</p>

<p>"Makes love to my wife. But so far, I am credibly informed, he
suffers frustration. Madame de Horn, whose presence there made it
possible that Catherine should go to Sceaux, appears to be seeing
to it that her husband shall have no undue grounds for satisfaction
therein."</p>

<p>Will's face was dark, his mouth scornful. "Do you really care so
little? If that were my only warranty of my wife's virtue, I'd as
lief have none."</p>

<p>"But then, you're not married, Will. No matter." A wave of his
fine hand dismissed the subject. "Let us come to business. I asked
you to bring your notebook so that you might tell me how much stock
in the Compagnie de Gambie has been bought by Horn."</p>

<p>Will drew a chair to the other side of the writing table, sat
down and opened his book. "I know that he originally purchased
seven thousand shares at a cost of seven hundred thousand livres,
because he hypothecated them here for half their value in order to
buy another thousand at four hundred and fifty livres. His total
holding today is of eight thousand shares for which he has paid
rather more than a million and a quarter."</p>

<p>"And of this, then, he owes three hundred and fifty thousand to
the bank. The balance probably represents all that he possesses in
the world; indeed, rather more, for he'll have no lack of debts.
Tell me, what is the value of his holding today?"</p>

<p>"The stock will be standing at five hundred. He could sell his
shares for two millions. A braw profit." Then Will laughed
unpleasantly, "You go beyond my understanding. It is not every day
that a man'll be making the fortune of his wife's gallant. Will it
be your notion of how to protect her?"</p>

<p>"You think that humorous? Maybe it is. But as a prophecy I have
no opinion of it. Tell me what is the issued capital of the
Compagnie de Gambie."</p>

<p>Will referred to his book. "It is of six millions in shares of a
thousand livres."</p>

<p>"And of these Horn now holds two-thirds."</p>

<p>"Ay. Such is his faith in you."</p>

<p>"Where is the balance of two thousand shares?"</p>

<p>"We, ourselves, hold nearly half. The remainder is with the
general public."</p>

<p>"And the present price is five hundred livres?"</p>

<p>"Thereabouts; that is, if you can find sellers. But they're none
so easy to discover at present in view of the expectations. Before
the rumour started that we are to take control, you could have
bought your fill at a hundred livres."</p>

<p>"We must scotch that rumour," said Mr Law quietly, to Will's
surprise, and went on to astonish him further. "You'll offer a
hundred of our shares today at four hundred and fifty, and another
hundred tomorrow at four hundred. After that, we'll see."</p>

<p>"But, man," protested Will, "if you want to sell our stock,
there's no need to lower the price."</p>

<p>Mr Law smiled. "Say it's a caprice of mine. Let McWhirter attend
to it."</p>

<p>"McWhirter!" For a moment Will was speechless. "But that's to
tell the world that you're the seller. You see the inference?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I see it fine." Mr Law took snuff delicately, and proffered
the open box to his brother. "Didn't you hear me say I am wanting
to scotch that rumour. This should do it."</p>

<p>"But you'll be throwing away a fortune," cried Will in pain.</p>

<p>Mr Law snapped down the lid of his snuffbox. He dusted some
fragments from the lace at his throat. "What's a fortune more or
less? A few millions are of no great account."</p>

<p>What sharply followed does not need many words. By Wednesday
morning Angus McWhirter, known to be Mr Law's man, was offering the
stock of the Compagnie de Gambie at three hundred, and by Wednesday
evening word ran in the Rue Quincampoix that there could be no
foundation for the rumour that Mr Law was interested in that
Company. Upon learning this, Mr Law's instruction were that
McWhirter should offer five hundred shares at two hundred.</p>

<p>"But we don't possess them," his brother protested. "We've
scarcely a share left."</p>

<p>Mr Law smiled. "Yet we may sell in the confident expectation of
a further fall."</p>

<p>His brother's eyes were round. It was a novel notion for him
that a speculation may be as profitable on a falling as on a rising
market. It was something new in the art of gambling, and if it did
not now succeed, that was only because the last buyer vanished when
McWhirter made his offer.</p>

<p>By that evening the clerks of the money-changers in the Rue
Quincampoix were vainly offering the stock of the Compagnie de
Gamble at prices which had successively fallen to fifty livres.
When the market opened on the following day there were one or two
speculative buyers at ten livres. The stock had become practically
worthless.</p>

<p>"I hope you're satisfied," said Will indignantly. "Judiciously
handled this stock might have produced four or five millions for
us."</p>

<p>"I am quite satisfied. Indeed, I would not sell my satisfaction
for twice that sum."</p>

<p>On the Saturday of that fateful week Catherine returned to
Paris, as airy and as much at her ease with her husband, as if
there had been no difference between them on the subject of her
absence. It may have surprised her that Mr Law accepted without
comment or allusion to her defiance the act of oblivion which she
passed over it. For the rest she came back a little intoxicated by
her success in the rarefied atmosphere of Sceaux. She boasted of
the attentions shown her by the Duke of Maine, and of the court
paid her by so many of the gallants among her fellow guests. She
had been made a Companion of the <i>Mouche-à-miel</i>, the order of
chivalry founded by the Duchess of Maine, and she displayed with
pride the gold medal of the order with the bee on one side and the
head of the Duchess on the other, and with scarcely less pride she
announced that the famous Malézieu had written some verses in her
honour.</p>

<p>Upon this Mr Law's comment was bittersweet. "I rejoice that he
still discovered in you sufficient honour upon which to hang his
rhymes."</p>

<p>"Honour?"</p>

<p>"Say virtue, if you prefer it."</p>

<p>"Must you always be churlish?"</p>

<p>"Is it churlish to rejoice in the unlikely?"</p>

<p>"The unlikely!" Her exclamation combined indignation with
alarm.</p>

<p>"You would give Malézieu and his ineffable kind every reason to
believe it so, and no doubt Monsieur de Horn would be at pains to
afford them added cause."</p>

<p>"You believe that!" Her eyes were black pools in the sudden
whiteness of her face.</p>

<p>"I believe that you have something for which to thank the
Countess of Horn, although you may not yet perceive it."</p>

<p>"I will not pretend to misunderstand you. I wonder, John, is
there any insult your mind will spare me." Then abruptly, casting
off all defiant mockery, she surprised him by pleading. "John! If I
were to say that I am sorry for not heeding you, sorry that I went
to Sceaux..."</p>

<p>"You would leave me wondering what was the experience that
chastened you."</p>

<p>She drew nearer, under the strong urge of a conciliatory
impulse. "I did not know when I went that he had quarrelled with
you, that he had struck you and then refused to meet you in terms
of further insult."</p>

<p>"It should not surprise you. It is what you foretold. But I see
that he informed you of it. Expecting your applause."</p>

<p>"Can you suppose that he received it?"</p>

<p>"Can you assure me that he did not?"</p>

<p>"Does it need that I assure you?"</p>

<p>"Your memory is short. You'll have forgot, it seems, the terms
you used with me when I desired you not to go to Sceaux."</p>

<p>Her face puckered. She twisted one hand in the other. "If you
knew, John, how bitterly I regret it all."</p>

<p>Matter and manner filled him with increasing wonder by their
unusualness.</p>

<p>After a moment she added: "At least I have signified it plainly
to Monsieur de Horn, and I hope that I shall never see him
again."</p>

<p>"Ah! It is likely, then, that you will not." He moved towards
the door. With his hand upon the knob, he turned to add with a grim
smile: "Do not be troubled about me as concerns Monsieur de Horn.
He is paid."</p>

<p>"Paid?" she questioned. But he went out without explaining.</p>

<p>Of that payment Monsieur le Comte was made aware on the
following Monday, when he, too, came back from Sceaux. He found a
note awaiting him from the Banque Générale, requesting him to give
himself the trouble of calling upon the director on a matter of the
utmost urgency.</p>

<p>Considering, however, the state of his relations with Mr Law it
was not his intention ever again to set foot within the Bank. Nor,
he might and did congratulate himself, was there the need. His
operations in the stock of the Compagnie de Gambie, for which it
amused him to think that he had to thank Mr Law, were already
showing him a rich profit. Already he had virtually doubled the
money he had received from Bernard, that other fool of a
financier.</p>

<p>For the moment, and in order to spare himself embarrassments,
all that was necessary was that he should give a broker of his
choice an order on the Banque Générale for the stock it held in his
name. The man he chose was one Hoquet, a money-changer, whose
counting house was actually in the Rue Quincampoix, a man with whom
he had had some dealings in the past.</p>

<p>Before his airy announcement that he proposed to transfer to the
care of the Sieur Hoquet all his effects with the Banque Générale,
a matter of a million and a half, the banker abased himself and was
voluble in assurances of how well the interests of so exalted a
client would be served. But when he had cast an eye over the
Count's order on the Banque Générale, the pursy little man's
expression changed. Knowing his place, he addressed his noble
client in the third person.</p>

<p>"Is this the total of Monsieur le Comte's effects?"</p>

<p>"The total." Horn was complacent. "It should represent today a
good round sum. At what do you now quote the Compagnie de
Gamble?"</p>

<p>Hoquet blew out fat lips in deprecation. "Monsieur le Comte will
have been out of Paris lately, I suppose. Actually the last sales
made were at thirty. That was two days ago. On Saturday."</p>

<p>"At thirty?" Horn's brows darkened in bewilderment. Then they
cleared. "Oh! At thirty louis."</p>

<p>There was a hollow laugh from the banker. "Livres, monsieur.
Thirty livres."</p>

<p>This made Horn stare in speechless amazement. Slowly the colour
mounted to his face. "What the devil are you saying? Are you drunk
by any chance?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Hoquet drew himself up as stiffly as his podgy figure
permitted, whilst Horn raged on.</p>

<p>"When I left Paris, ten days ago, the stock stood at five
hundred and was rising daily. How can it possibly be at thirty
today? What ails you, my man?"</p>

<p>"Ah! I was right in supposing that monsieur had been out of
Paris, not to know what has happened. There has been a collapse in
this stock during the past week." He cast an eye over the figures
on the sheet. "Faith, monsieur would be fortunate today if he could
realize a thousand crowns on this."</p>

<p>"A thousand crowns! Six thousand livres!" Horn's face was
grey.</p>

<p>"I doubt if monsieur could get even so much. The stock is
virtually worthless."</p>

<p>"Worthless! My God!" However much his rank might urge a
dignified impassivity, the Count found it impossible to contemplate
impassively the incredible melting away in a few days of a fortune
of a million and a half. "Oh, but that is impossible." He jerked
himself to his feet. "Impossible, name of God! How can such a thing
happen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, this stock has been unreasonably inflated by an
assumption that Monsieur Lass would take over the monopoly of
Gambie and add it to the Mississippi."</p>

<p>"That was no assumption," roared Horn. "I know it to have been
his intention."</p>

<p>"Monsieur is no doubt right. But clearly it is his intention no
longer, for he has been selling what stock he already possessed.
That is what has caused this <i>dégringolade</i>."</p>

<p>"Give me that paper." The order upon the Banque Générale was
almost snatched from Hoquet's hands. "You shall hear from me again
when I have seen Monsieur Lass."</p>

<p>He stamped out, violently swinging his long cane, and went down
the street, to storm into the Banque Générale, breathlessly
clamouring for Monsieur Lass.</p>

<p>An elderly clerk conducted him upstairs to Mr Law's handsome
room. It was not, however, Mr Law who presently came to him there,
but a gentleman almost as tall and dark, of the same courtly
fastidiousness in his dress and placid urbanity in his manner.
Announcing himself the servant of Monsieur le Comte, he professed
himself grateful for this prompt response to the note in which he
had prayed for the honour of a visit.</p>

<p>Horn cut him short. "It is Monsieur Lass I have come to see. Be
good enough to call him."</p>

<p>"But Monsieur le Baron is not here. Permit me to present myself.
I am his brother and his deputy in the direction of the Bank."</p>

<p>"So there are two of you in this thieves' kitchen?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur says?"</p>

<p>Horn spoke of his stock in the Compagnie de Gamble, indignantly
repeating what Hoquet had told him, and still more indignantly
demanding to know if it were true, and, if so, how it came to be
true that a fortune of a million and a half had vanished in a
week.</p>

<p>William Law was grave. "I am afraid that it is rather less than
the truth. For not only has your million and a half vanished, as
you say, but it has swept with it a matter of three hundred and
fifty thousand livres which the Bank lent you on the stock of your
original purchase. That is the present extent of your debt to us,
which," added William Law pleasantly, "we shall be glad to have you
settle at your early convenience."</p>

<p>Limp, white-faced, chap-fallen, Horn stared at the smiling
banker, who so urbanely announced to him his utter ruin. At last,
"Have you the courage," he cried, "to add mockery to your tricks?
Have you the effrontery to say that I am in your debt?"</p>

<p>"You would surely not have the Bank be at the loss of the
advance it has made you?"</p>

<p>"To the devil with your Bank and its loss. What of my loss?"
There was foam at the corners of his lips, his eyes had become
blood-injected. "What of the swindle that has been practised on me?
My God! you villains, do you imagine I will submit? I bought this
stock in Gambie on your brother's recommendation, on his assurance
that he would be taking control of the company and that its stock
would rise, as rise it did at first."</p>

<p>"At best," he was answered, "that could be no more than an
opinion. In such matters no man can be infallible."</p>

<p>"That he was to assume direction of the Compagnie de Gambie was
no matter of opinion. Was it a lie?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you what was in my brother's mind. But if he told
you that, he must so have intended at the time. In finance a change
of intention is always possible and may result from a variety of
causes."</p>

<p>"So that is how you explain this...this cursed swindle."</p>

<p>"I do not think," said William with frosty dignity, "that it can
profit us to continue this discussion."</p>

<p>"Do you not?" The Count stared at him for a speechless moment
out of a grey face from which the normal beauty had been distorted.
Then, abruptly, he broke into laughter, made horrible by rage. "My
dear sir, I begin to find you an amusing scoundrel. Not only am I
to be at the loss of a million and a half, but I am to pay your
rascally Bank a further three hundred and fifty thousand livres for
the privilege of being robbed by you. I'll see you and your damned
brother broken on the wheel before you have another liard of mine.
And broken on the wheel I'll see you in any case. Do you dream that
I'll suffer myself to be robbed in this impudent manner?"</p>

<p>William had risen, and was crossing the room. He opened the
door.</p>

<p>"Your servant, Monsieur le Comte!"</p>

<p>From the manner in which Horn gripped his cane, the banker
thought him about to strike with it. But perhaps he remembered in
time what the last blow of that kind was costing him.</p>

<p>"You shall hear from me soon again, you scoundrels," he
bellowed. "The Regent shall hear of it. He shall have the whole
story. His Highness is my kinsman. Perhaps you rascals had
forgotten that. But as God lives I'll make you remember it to your
cost."</p>

<p>He flung out still raging, to find a hackney coach in which he
had himself carried at once to the Palais Royal.</p>

<p>He arrived there, as it appeared to him, at a fortunate moment.
But the appearance was to prove deceptive. The Regent, newly risen
from the council table, was able and willing to see him at once,
and he was ushered into the Duke's study, the light and rather gay
room in which his versatile Highness sometimes painted, sometimes
wrote music and sometimes gave himself to the study of the works of
others in a variety of fields. The Abbé Dubois, lately promoted to
be Secretary of State for foreign affairs, was with him when Horn
was introduced.</p>

<p>"Ah, Joseph! What is there for your service?" Thus the Regent,
familiarly, with a lift of the hand.</p>

<p>Horn's patronymics were Antoine-Joseph, and to all his intimates
he was Antoine. It was characteristic of His Highness that he
should find ironical amusement in the use of the second name, so
much at variance were its chaste associations with Horn's
proclivities.</p>

<p>Still quivering with an indignation which reflection had merely
deepened, indifferent to the presence of Dubois, caring, indeed,
nothing who might hear of Law's infamy, he poured out his tale of
the shameful swindle of which he was the victim.</p>

<p>The Regent, seated at his ease, heard him at the outset with a
gravity which diminished as the account proceeded. When it was
done, to Horn's horror, His Highness actually laughed.
"<i>Corbleu</i>! Do you seriously tell me, Joseph, that you
disposed of a million livres?"</p>

<p>"I do not think that even Lass will deny that."</p>

<p>"I wish you would give me the secret of where you find your
millions. How did you come by it?"</p>

<p>There was a splutter of laughter from Dubois, who permitted
himself every liberty.</p>

<p>"You hear. Even my good Abbé finds it amusing."</p>

<p>"But not so amusing," chuckled Dubois, "as might be the
answer."</p>

<p>"Ah! You seem to know something of this, Abbé. What is the
mystery, my dear Joseph?"</p>

<p>Horn glared venomously at Dubois, whose malice put him
momentarily out of countenance. "There is no mystery, monseigneur.
That I have been subjected to a foul swindle is plain enough."</p>

<p>His Highness' arched brows were further arched. "But unless I
know how you became possessed of a million, how can I believe that
you were swindled of it?"</p>

<p>The Count took refuge in dignity. "Is not my word sufficient,
monseigneur?"</p>

<p>Still the Regent playfully rallied him. "For a million? That's a
deal with which to load your word, my friend."</p>

<p>"Your Highness is amused at my expense."</p>

<p>"But no, but no. It is your tales that are amusing: one, that
you possessed a million; the other, that my friend Lass has robbed
you of it. Faith, I don't know which is more unlikely."</p>

<p>The Count breathed hard. "I see that Your Highness refuses to
take me seriously." He was quivering with anger. "I beg leave to
withdraw."</p>

<p>"Eh?" The Regent's plump, smooth face became suddenly sober.
"What the devil's this, monsieur? You do not happen to be hiding
something so as to abuse my faith? To be dealing in half truths?"
Surprising a sly grin on Dubois' lips, he asked him bluntly, "What
do you know of this, Abbé?"</p>

<p>The Abbé was rubbing his hands, his back arched like a cat's;
the wide, almost lipless, mouth became further extended. "Very
little. Nothing of what Monsieur Lass may have done. But enough to
assure Your Highness that Monsieur de Horn is not exaggerating when
he says that he possessed a million. There's a whisper that he had
it from Samuel Bernard."</p>

<p>The Count bit his lip, perhaps to stifle the curse that rose to
it.</p>

<p>"From Bernard? From that scoundrel?" His Highness was now
entirely serious. "And for what, if you please?"</p>

<p>With all the air of hastening to Horn's assistance, Dubois
calculatedly made matters worse. "Oh, but just one of those little
presents with which financiers seek to win favour at Court."</p>

<p>The Regent scowled. "Is it possible that you accept such
presents, Comte? I refuse to believe that you are without the
prejudices with which a gentleman is born."</p>

<p>The Count quivered as if struck. Inwardly sick with rage and no
longer master of his wits, he was shamed into the blunder of a lie.
"It should scarcely be necessary. It is surely inconceivable that I
should accept presents from any Samuel Bernard. This was a loan,
Highness."</p>

<p>"A loan?" His Highness' short laugh suggested incredulity. "I
should have thought that even more inconceivable. But no doubt you
were able to give him good security."</p>

<p>"Naturally, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Naturally, of course." The Regent waited. "Well? You do not
choose to tell me what it is?"</p>

<p>"I did not realize that Your Highness was demanding to
know."</p>

<p>"Demanding? Of course I don't demand. How could I? But there is
an oddness here which I thought you would be anxious to explain.
Bernard is in gaol. He has been squeezed in the press of justice
until he could drip no more ill-gotten gold. In the circumstances I
should expect him to be eager to collect all his resources."</p>

<p>But Horn was not to be pinned. "I have no doubt that he is, and
that is now my danger, thanks to this cold-blooded swindle by
Lass."</p>

<p>"You mean the danger that Bernard will realize on the security
he holds." As if in kindly interest, he added: "Would that be so
disadvantageous to you? I cannot judge without knowing the nature
of it."</p>

<p>"Its nature?" Horn contrived another wriggle. "If you must know,
monseigneur, it is a security supplied by my wife."</p>

<p>"You are fortunate in your lady. Not her jewels, I hope."</p>

<p>"Not her jewels. No." He was recovering his self-possession, and
feeling reassured. "What matters is that she should not be at the
loss of it, which is why I have been so bold as to ask Your
Highness for justice against this man, Lass."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. Against my friend Lass," the Duke corrected. "He told
you, you say, that the Compagnie de Gambie would be passing into
his control?"</p>

<p>"It was on this assurance that I bought the stock."</p>

<p>"Borrowing for the purpose from Samuel Bernard?"</p>

<p>"Precisely, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"And, of course, you possess the stock?"</p>

<p>Horn laughed unpleasantly. "I hypothecated it to the Banque
Générale for a loan to lay out on further stock, and repayment of
this is now claimed from me. It is all part of the swindle."</p>

<p>There was a clucking sound from Dubois.</p>

<p>"What is it, Abbé?"</p>

<p>"The folly of some noblemen when they adventure into the kingdom
of finance. They are as naked children exposed to the blasts of a
cold, calculating world."</p>

<p>"You mean of cold, calculating swindlers," cried Horn.</p>

<p>"But--<i>mon Dieu</i>!--who has swindled you, monsieur? The
stock is there which Monsieur Lass advised you to acquire."</p>

<p>"Haven't I said that it is worthless?" Horn was impatient. "For
a week past Lass' own agents have been selling the stock. Does that
look as if he were to acquire control of the company?"</p>

<p>"Neither the Abbé nor I can answer that at present," said the
Regent. "So that when all is weighed I see no help that I can
render you. But what I can do, my dear Horn, I will. The security
which you tell me is held by Bernard actually, like all his
property, now belongs to the State, and to the State Bernard shall
be required to surrender it.</p>

<p>"The State, as you know, my dear Count, is far from affluent in
these days; but it can still, in exceptional cases, afford some
generosity, and I shall see to it that the State restores your
property, or, rather, your lady's property. I could not suffer the
Countess of Horn to be at such a loss."</p>

<p>The resolve was characteristic of this generous, extravagant,
improvident prince, who not only had never learnt to refuse, but
who could bestow with prodigality without even waiting to be
asked.</p>

<p>Horn, however, was in no case to savour this generosity. Nothing
could more profoundly embarrass him. He perceived how, blinded by
anger, he had rushed into a trap.</p>

<p>He should have foreseen that the Regent, so fully aware of
straitened circumstances which his bounty had more than once
relieved, should wonder how he had come by a million, and
inevitably ask him. He should have foreseen that the question was
one that could not be met, save by plunging into this morass of
falsehood, from which there was no escape without disgrace.</p>

<p>Willingly, indeed, almost gladly, would he now have abandoned
his million as the price of extricating himself and effacing all
his misrepresentations.</p>

<p>Speechless, pale and with beads of sweat along the line where
wig met brow, he stood before the Regent, who smiled as he waited,
and before Dubois, who also smiled, but in sheer derision.</p>

<p>"I hope," said His Highness, "that this will content you without
the need to trouble Monsieur Lass." Over his shoulder to Dubois he
added: "You will make a note, Abbé, to have Bernard questioned
tomorrow in this matter."</p>

<p>Desperately, under the stress of fresh necessity, Horn
floundered further. "Surely that will be idle. Bernard will deny
it, of course."</p>

<p>The Abbé looked shocked. "Deny it?" he cried. "Deny that you had
a million from him? How could he deny it? How do you suppose that I
happened already to know it?"</p>

<p>A grin tightened the skin of that lean face as he paused before
answering his own question. "You see, Monsieur le Comte, we have
seized Bernard's papers. That is where I found the record of it.
Perhaps it had not occurred to you."</p>

<p>"Did you find..." impulsively Horn was beginning, when he
stopped. "No matter. I..."</p>

<p>"You were about to ask, I think, did we find a record of the
consideration he received. There was a note in cipher. It did not
suggest a security."</p>

<p>The Regent looked at the Abbé with sudden sharpness. "How can
you say that, unless you can also say what it did suggest?"</p>

<p>Dubois was softly rubbing his hands again, a gesture that Horn
found hateful. "But I am quite prepared to say so, Highness,
although the notion may seem absurd, and Monsieur le Comte will no
doubt deny it. It suggested--how shall I say it?--it suggested that
Bernard made this payment for services rendered, or to be
rendered."</p>

<p>"Impossible," said the Regent. "What services could be in
question?" He looked from the Abbé to the Count.</p>

<p>"Several instances were discovered," the Abbé slyly answered
him, "of large sums paid by these <i>maltôtiers</i> to persons of
influence at Court for--ah--protection."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean bribes," said the Regent, scandalized. "But
you are not implying that Monsieur le Comte..." He broke off to
look keenly at Horn. "You say nothing! Is it possible that you
don't deny it?"</p>

<p>The Count was at the end of denials, whose ultimate futility had
become all too plain, serving only to deepen his defilement. He
stood with bowed shoulders, a scowl of defeat on his white face.
"To what end?" he asked, with sullen defiance, and shrugged as he
spoke.</p>

<p>It was a moment before the Regent appeared to interpret the
man's attitude. At last, "My God!" he said, and emotion brought him
to his feet. "Is this really possible?"</p>

<p>Avoiding the Regent's glance, Horn partly raised his arms, and
let them fall heavily to his sides. It was a gesture of despair.
"I...I was hard pressed," he growled.</p>

<p>"So hard pressed that you, a gentleman, took a bribe from this
thieving Jew. And did you even earn it? I do not remember that you
interceded for him."</p>

<p>"I...I had not so much effrontery."</p>

<p>"Not so much effrontery? Really! But you had effrontery enough
to come here complaining that you had been defrauded of this
million which you obtained by fraud. You had effrontery enough to
stoop to falsehood..."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur!" It was a cry at once of pain and of anger.</p>

<p>But the easy-going Regent was for once implacable. "Is that too
much to say? How do you suppose that men of honour will describe
it?"</p>

<p>He went on without waiting for an answer, "I have known you
guilty of irregularities in the past, monsieur. More than once for
the sake of your blood I have helped you to extricate yourself from
situations that imperilled your honour. But that you should lie to
me like a lackey! That is something that I will not condone. I am
ashamed for you. But there!"</p>

<p>He sighed, and let fall some of the sternness that was so
foreign to him and in which his indolent nature was uncomfortable.
"It is useless to say more. I will do you the justice to suppose
that I could say nothing that you will not already have said to
yourself. You are permitted to go."</p>

<p>Almost sorrowfully he added: "And, of course, you will
understand that you cannot again be received here."</p>

<p>The Count bowed low in silence, his face twitching. He moved
backwards towards the door and in silence went out.</p>

<p>The Regent sat down on the clavichord stool, with his back to
the instrument. He took snuff to soothe himself. "Poor devil!" he
sighed.</p>

<p>"Your Highness wastes pity," said Dubois. "A <i>mauvais
sujet</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah! And what are you, Abbé? Have you never taken a bribe? How
much does Lord Stanhope pay you to keep me well disposed towards
England?"</p>

<p>Dubois swelled indignantly. "I have never taken a louis that was
not to further your interests."</p>

<p>"Oh, to further our interests, of course. And, anyway, you were
not born a gentleman. So it's no great matter. You may perceive
that the condition has its disadvantages."</p>

<p>"A scoundrel," said the Abbé sententiously, "is a scoundrel
however he may be born."</p>

<p>"That is what madame my mother says when she speaks of you. Like
you, she lacks charity, which may be pardonable in a woman but is
abominable in a priest--even a nominal one. That poor devil was
hard driven by temptation, which is something you have never
known."</p>

<p>"Oho! Have I not, monseigneur?"</p>

<p>"I do not mean that it is temptation you have never known. What
you have never known, is to be hard driven by it. You have always
yielded readily. But no matter. It is not you who gives me concern.
It is this unfortunate fellow of whom necessity has made a rascal.
I hope that he will have the good sense to leave Paris for a
while."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Horn, however, had no such notion. If the shame in
which he left the Palais Royal was deep, deeper still was the rage
at having been so trapped, and the object of this rage was, of
course, the Laird of Lauriston. He took the view, not only that Mr
Law had cruelly defrauded him, but that it was Mr Law's credit with
the Regent which had denied him redress and turned the tables upon
him by uncovering his questionable transaction with Samuel Bernard.
Utter disgrace must follow upon the disclosure of this as the
reason for his expulsion from Court, as if there were not already
enough to bear in the complete financial ruin which, in an excess
of irony, had overtaken him at the very moment when financial
redemption had seemed firmly within his grasp.</p>

<p>In his desperately vindictive mood and in casting about him for
means to gratify it, he thought of his friend de Mille, and sought
him out in his mean lodging opposite Saint Philippe du Roule.</p>

<p>A large man of a rather raffish exterior, mitigated by an air of
command, acquired in the course of his military career, it was one
of the Colonel's delusions, based upon a couple of easy victories
over fledgelings, that he was something of a swordsman. Therefore
the Count's commission flattered him. Ignorant of that sinister
side of Mr Law's past history, it did not occur to de Mille that a
money-changer might be an awkward opponent on the field of honour.
But he wondered why Horn's deadly animosity should not fire him to
act for himself, and he said so.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand that I am in disgrace with the Regent on
this man's account?" Horn asked, by way of explanation. "If I were
to defy the edicts I should not be forgiven."</p>

<p>"Whilst I may defy them and go hang."</p>

<p>"Arrange it so that the provocation comes from Lass, and since
there is no prejudice against you, that will be a sufficient
answer. I can contrive a hundred louis at once when it is done, and
in the future, when I am in funds, you can count upon me as in the
past."</p>

<p>De Mille's resources in those days permitted him neither to
refuse a hundred louis nor to decline to oblige a man to whom he
owed so much and to whom in the future he hoped to owe so much
more.</p>

<p>He sought his opportunity, and was some days in finding it. It
was provided at last by merest chance when he happened to be one of
a party at the Duke of Antin's, which included also Mr Law. After
supper a half-dozen of them sat down to dice for easy stakes. De
Mille, himself, was not of the players, but hovering about the
table as an onlooker he presently perceived his chance. Mr Law had
made a cast, called the main, doubled the stakes, thrown again and
won.</p>

<p>"Uncanny!" said the Colonel with an unpleasant laugh. "Permit
me." He leaned over, picked up one of the dice, and indifferent to
the stares of amazement, balanced it by its corners between finger
and thumb. "In effect, it does not turn," he said in tones of
surprise, and tossed it back on to the table.</p>

<p>On the deadly silence there was the sharp clap with which Mr Law
set down the dice box. "What does that mean, Colonel de Mille?"</p>

<p>"A habit of mine," said the Colonel with his impudent laugh.
"It's prudent to test the tools of a professional gamester."</p>

<p>D'Antin heaved himself up in anger. "Are you crazy, Colonel, or
merely more drunk than usual?"</p>

<p>But Mr Law had lost none of his placidity. "He is neither, my
dear Duke. He is merely provocative, the bully swordsman hired to a
job."</p>

<p>"Do you say that of me?" roared de Mille. Nor was his anger
simulated. The cold contempt of Mr Law's quiet voice had cut him to
the soul.</p>

<p>"It's no more than you deserve," d'Antin condemned him.</p>

<p>The Colonel wrapped himself in dignity. "I'll venture to remind
you, monseigneur, that I am your guest, and that my affair is with
your foreign friend."</p>

<p>Mr Law smiled. "You admit to an affair, then?"</p>

<p>De Mille was cautious. It was for him to take and not to give
offence. "Quite enough has been said."</p>

<p>"Too much in fact," cried d'Antin, whilst the others looked on
in forbidding silence.</p>

<p>"As you say, Monsieur le Duc; too much. My friends shall wait on
you, Mr Law, so that we resume the discussion on another plane. I
take my leave, monseigneur." He bowed, first to the Duke and then
to the company, and stalked out with airs of righteous
indignation.</p>

<p>D'Antin was distressed. "My dear Lass! That this should happen
in my house!" And he added: "You are under no necessity to meet
that fellow."</p>

<p>"Could I deny myself the pleasure?" laughed Mr Law.</p>

<p>The meeting took place in the Bois de Boulogne two days later,
with d'Antin as Mr Law's second. As a spectacle, the
onlookers--most of whom had been at the Duke's party--found it
disappointingly brief. At the end of not more than a half-dozen
disengages, Mr Law, putting aside a high thrust, stepped inside his
opponent's guard, and drove his blade through the Colonel's
sword-arm.</p>

<p>Whilst the surgeon in attendance was bandaging the wound, Mr Law
stood close to the wincing de Mille. "It would have taken me even
less time to run you through the body, my Colonel. Let me advise
you not to recommence; for you cannot expect me again to be at so
much trouble."</p>

<p>That was humiliation enough for a swordsman who accounted
himself a <i>ferrailleur</i> to be feared. But there was worse in
store for him that evening when Horn came to see him. The Count
stared in disgust at the sling in which the arm was carried.</p>

<p>"What the devil is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"It means," he was sourly answered, "that you were wise to
employ a deputy. I suppose you knew that the fellow is a damned
fencing master."</p>

<p>"Bah!" snapped the Count. "I thought you were a swordsman."</p>

<p>And that was all the comfort the Colonel had from an employer
who was far too much in need of comfort for himself. In his almost
despairing quest for it Horn bethought him of Noailles and of
Noailles' implacable hatred of Law, who had so mortally wounded him
in his vanity and his ambition. For it was, of course, to Law that
his Grace attributed his dismissal from the Council of Finance, his
loss of influence with the Regent, and the frustration of his hopes
of becoming the First Minister of the Crown.</p>

<p>If any man in France would help the Count of Horn to the
vengeance for which his wrongs cried out to heaven, that man was
surely Noailles, who out of his own rancour might not trouble to
look too closely into Horn's grounds of quarrel with the
financier.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10 -- THE PLOTTERS</h2>

<p>The Duke of Noailles' lean, dark face was flushed with interest,
his normal forbidding haughtiness relaxed as he listened to the
Count of Horn. The tale was none too clear in detail, but in
general it ran that the scoundrelly Scot had tricked the Count by
deliberate falsehood into the investment of a million, and that of
this he had cold-bloodedly swindled him, so that the Count was now
facing ruin.</p>

<p>There were several things that a man less passionately
prejudiced than Noailles might have required to know. As it
happened, the Duke's eagerness to believe in Mr Law's turpitude
left him without even the curiosity to learn how a man so
notoriously in everybody's debt as Horn had come to be possessed of
so much money.</p>

<p>Having told his muddled tale, the Count raved on. "This foreign
adventurer, this cursed thief has become a danger to us all. The
Regent is so bewitched and bedevilled by him that he dances to any
tune the scoundrel pipes. Your Grace knows how from the wings he
directs the Council of Finance, until dignity would no longer
permit a noble of your rank to continue as its president.</p>

<p>"It was the intriguing of this spawn of Satan that sent
d'Aguesseau into exile. It was at his rascally prompting that
d'Argenson was made chancellor. And every day he wins some fresh
concession from the infatuated Duke of Orléans. The town is full of
rumours of what he is about to do, as if he were already
Comptroller-General."</p>

<p>Noailles exploded. "Ah, that no, my God!" He had listened with
swelling anger to each of Horn's denunciations, each of which
confirmed his own convictions. The assumption on which Horn ended
provided so natural a climax to them that the Duke's feelings
amounted to panic. "That never, by God!"</p>

<p>"It should not be," Horn agreed. "But...How to prevent it? What
law in France could be invoked against him? What court?"</p>

<p>"Court?" Noailles echoed, and stared at him with dull eyes.
Suddenly the light of inspiration flashed from them. "There is the
Parliament. It has always resented him, ever since Argenson the
Damned was made Chancellor by his offices. It would ask nothing
better than to bring him down."</p>

<p>For a moment Horn was uplifted. Then he shrugged. "To bring him
down! I dare say. But what can the Parliament do against the
Regent. This is France, not England."</p>

<p>"Do you say so?" The tone rebuked him. "As for what it can do,
that is to be studied. Certainly it is far from impotent.</p>

<p>"You'll remember that no royal edict--that is, no edict of the
Regent's--is good until the Parliament has registered it. You'll
remember also that the Parliament is the supreme court of justice
in France, with power to move directly against any malefactor. Let
us take counsel with the President de Mesmes. Something will be
decided."</p>

<p>De Mesmes proved but too willing to consider what might be done.
Not only was he, too, filled with rancour of Mr Law, but, a vain
man, he had been drawn by his gallantry into participation in the
Duchess of Maine's plots for the overthrow of the Regent.</p>

<p>If he welcomed the chance to strike at Law, he welcomed it the
more joyously in that it enabled him to strike through him at the
Duke of Orléans. He did not hesitate to reveal to Noailles that
there were no lengths in reason, or even out of reason, to which he
was not prepared to go. Of course for the good of France.</p>

<p>He took some days to consider and to consult a few of his
colleagues, all of whom were in sympathy with his views, and then
came bearing the considerable fruits of it, to a little gathering
at the Hôtel de Noailles. To meet him the Duke had summoned his
coadjutor Rouillé du Coudray, whilst the Count of Horn was present
as the interested originator of the movement.</p>

<p>De Mesmes, a large, portly, pock-marked man, rather priestly of
manner, soft-voiced and with a slight lisp, expounded at length the
rascally plan with which rancour and treason inspired him. It was
elaborate and yet simple.</p>

<p>"Against the Banque Générale as originally constituted no
complaint is possible, no case could be made. For we are agreed, of
course, that we must proceed strictly within the framework, not
necessarily of existing laws, but at least of incontestable
legality.</p>

<p>"Having carefully examined all the transactions by Monsieur
Lass, I am of the opinion that the surest ground upon which to
assail him would be that of probity."</p>

<p>Horn struck the table vehemently. "I'll pledge my honour for his
dishonesty."</p>

<p>"Your honour!" sneered Coudray, with his usual sourness. "We
want evidence, not pledges; and Lass is not the fool to leave
evidence strewn about."</p>

<p>"We may dig some up," said the President with an oily smile,
"however carefully he may have buried it. For instance, we may
reasonably require to know what has become of the State bonds the
bank received against shares in the Mississippi Company. Parliament
will appoint a commission to investigate. The slightest
irregularity there, would be a criminal matter, and Lass would be
lost."</p>

<p>"Don't build on it," growled Coudray. "Lass is a gamester who
boasts that he wins because he understands why men lose. He has the
type of mind any chess player might envy. He can see a dozen moves
ahead in every direction. Not the sort of man to leave traces of
any malversations."</p>

<p>Noailles shrugged impatiently. "<i>Non semper arcus</i>..." He
murmured, and left the quotation there.</p>

<p>"Precisely, Your Grace," lisped de Mesmes. "And, anyway, we need
not depend upon that alone. If no irregularity should be
discovered, we pass on to examine one by one the transactions
between Monsieur Lass and His Highness, and we discover that the
last money edict is illegal because the Bank usurps some of the
functions of the royal accountants in the administration of
national finances."</p>

<p>"Illegal, is it?" wondered du Coudray with scepticism.</p>

<p>De Mesmes became prim. "It represents a startling departure from
all that is by law established. If there is no actual law against
it, there is certainly no law to sanction it."</p>

<p>"There are no laws to sanction anything," growled du Coudray.
"Laws are made only to prohibit. As a lawyer, Monsieur le
President, you should know that. I'll observe only that if you make
your laws as you proceed, you'll have no difficulty in convicting
Lass of anything you choose. But you may have considerable
difficulty in persuading the Attorney-General to take the
responsibility of being your mouthpiece in this <i>ad hoc</i>
legislation to serve your ends."</p>

<p>De Mesmes' ready answer showed how well considered was the plan.
"The Attorney-General will not be concerned or necessary. His place
will be taken by the commissioners. It will be their business to
recommend a decree rescinding the offending edict. They will
declare it illegal, and--another thing which has just occurred to
me--on the authority of His late Majesty, they will declare it
illicit and illegal for any foreigner or huguenot to concern
himself directly or indirectly in the administration of the
national finances, and discover crime where this has occurred. The
Regent being inviolate, it becomes necessary to provide a
deputy."</p>

<p>The President displayed his teeth in a grin at this conceit.
"For that office we have under our hand this man Lass, guilty, if
not of malversation, as may well be, at least of having seduced the
Regent into taking these illegal courses."</p>

<p>Noailles shook his head. "You don't conceive that His Highness
will permit any measures against Lass."</p>

<p>"Of course not," grumbled Horn.</p>

<p>Again that oily smile overspread the President's big face, and
he showed how completely the plan had shaped itself from their
talk. "Knowledge of our measures will reach His Highness too late.
The commission will act in secret, and in secret the Parliament
will issue a writ of <i>prise</i>-<i>de</i>-<i>corps</i>. Once Lass
is brought to the Palace, he need never leave it again. He can be
tried, sentenced and even hanged within its precincts."</p>

<p>Horn was breathless, Noailles aghast, and Coudray sardonically
amused. It was the Duke who spoke, his tone irritably dubious.
"These are extreme measures."</p>

<p>"But effective," chuckled Horn, now flushed with evil
satisfaction. "Nothing less will serve than to present His Highness
with an accomplished fact."</p>

<p>"But not necessarily with a corpse. Surely, Monsieur le
President, it should suffice to banish him."</p>

<p>De Mesmes shook his head. "You are reckoning without His
Highness."</p>

<p>"So are you," du Coudray mocked him. "He'll certainly require an
account of you. He may even require your head."</p>

<p>"There are a hundred and thirty of us." The President was
scornful. "What satisfaction can he demand?"</p>

<p>Coudray laughed. "It certainly may be difficult to hang the lot
of you, as you'll deserve."</p>

<p>"Therefore he can't hang a single one of us, for if there's
guilt we shall all be equally guilty. You may safely leave it in my
hands, Monsieur le Duc. All I ask of you is the utmost secrecy.
This foreign adventurer has too long been a thorn in our flesh. It
is time to make an end."</p>

<p>But Noailles was sombre. "I don't like it," he said. "Much as I
detest Monsieur Lass and his ways, I'll have no part in this."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary that you should, Monsieur le Duc. The
Parliament will bear the burden lightly in the service of France.
As I have said, it will possess the authority of Louis XIV, who
expelled this same Monsieur Lass from the Kingdom."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11 -- THE COUNTESS OF
HORN</h2>

<p>With no suspicion of the plot that menaced his very life, Mr Law
was quietly pursuing the even tenor of those studies by which his
system was to achieve its ultimate all-embracing scope.</p>

<p>To keep pace with his expanding fortunes and consequence, Mr Law
had by now removed himself to the Hôtel de Nevers, that handsome
palace built by Mazarin in the Rue Vivienne.</p>

<p>The great success of the Banque Générale, the high credit of the
paper it emitted, and the facilities which this provided for
commerce both at home and abroad were by now abundantly reflected
in that increased prosperity which Mr Law had affirmed would follow
upon the free and ample circulation of currency. Not only in trade,
but in agriculture, too, both of which had been dangerously
languishing, there was every sign of healthy activity as a result
of the Bank's judicious loans.</p>

<p>At Mr Law's magical touch the Mississippi Company, worthless
under Crozat, and although not likely for some time to show
returns, was already proving by the gradual appreciation of its
shares, those theories on credit which Mr Law had so lucidly and so
vainly expounded to the sealed minds of the Council of Finance.</p>

<p>All this was predisposing the Regent naturally enough to allow
the Scot to undertake the control of France's other languishing
overseas monopolies: the East India Company, the China Company, the
Sénégal Company, and the like.</p>

<p>And whilst completing arrangements for this, Mr Law's
conceptions were opening out still wider horizons to the Regent's
dazzled view.</p>

<p>He propounded a revolution in taxation. He would suppress all
those internal customs' barriers, which were mere stumbling blocks
to trade; he would abolish altogether the arbitrary taxes: the
<i>taille</i>, the <i>gabelle</i>, the <i>corveés</i>, and the rest
of those ancient, unpopular, complicated, vexatious imposts which
paralysed commerce and required for their collection an army of
parasites who fed upon the substance of the State whilst themselves
producing nothing.</p>

<p>He would replace all this by a single uniform tax of one per
centum on every man's revenue, a tax which could hurt no one; for,
as he argued, the wealthy would have no reason to conceal his
wealth, and the poor man would dare to become wealthy without the
dread of being arbitrarily preyed upon.</p>

<p>There would be an end of barriers, of inquisitions, of
collectors, of tax farmers, and with them of all those vexatious
conflicts constantly resulting from the necessity under which men
found themselves so as to guard their rights from predatory
servants of the State.</p>

<p>Then, just as salt and tobacco became State monopolies, there no
longer appeared to be any reason why trade in general should not be
treated in the same way and brought under State control, to the
profit of the nation as against the profit of the individual. The
valid objections to this which had been urged by d'Aguesseau were
not permitted to obscure the grandiose dream.</p>

<p>The Regent, listening to Law, questioning him, pressing for
details and impressed by the glittering pageantry of wealth and
universal prosperity which the Scot evoked, found himself
regretting that he should lately have allowed d'Argenson to
purchase the general farming of the revenue.</p>

<p>The Chancellor had actually found his inspiration in Law's
flotation of the Mississippi Company. He had acquired the rights
for an annual payment of forty-eight millions, and he had
associated with himself a group of able financiers--the four
brothers Paris--Duverney--launching a company which he called the
Anti-System. For this he had found the necessary capital the more
readily since he was able to assure the investors of a definite
fixed return.</p>

<p>For Mr Law this was a minor obstacle to that complete control at
which he aimed, and he dismissed it for the present as of no
immediate importance. His projected activities in the realm of
taxation must follow, and not precede, the expansion of the
Mississippi Company by amalgamation with it of the other colonial
trading companies. Of this it was at last decided that he should
prepare a complete scheme for the Regent's consideration.</p>

<p>He was at work upon this one afternoon, in the room which he had
made peculiarly his own in the Hôtel de Nevers and to which he had
transplanted the rich furnishings of his own personal office in the
Rue Quincampoix: the rosewood and ormolu writing table, the
Aubusson carpet, the Van Dycks, the Watteaus, the Consoles, the
Venetian mirrors and the rest. Saving that between the pilasters
with gilded capitals the walls were panelled in embossed Cordovan
leather, you might suppose yourself still in the Rue
Quincampoix.</p>

<p>There was, it is true, less hubbub from the street, which lay
beyond the spacious courtyard, and it was of a different character.
Through the tall, open windows, subdued by distance, came
intermittently the cry of a bellows mender, a water carrier, a
rat-catcher, or the shriller note of a fishwife, but there were
none of the unceasing deafening vociferations of the Rue
Quincampoix.</p>

<p>Absorbed in his calculations, Mr Law heard not so much as the
beat of hooves on the kidney stones and the creaking of a coach.
Not until it rumbled and clattered to a standstill in his spacious
courtyard did it disturb him into momentarily raising his head.</p>

<p>Laguyon, soft-footed and soft-voiced, came in, with the quiet
announcement: "Pardon, monsieur. Madame la Comtesse de Horn begs
urgently to see you."</p>

<p>"The Comtesse de Horn!" It certainly surprised him. He was only
vaguely aware of the existence of such a person. "But I do not know
the lady."</p>

<p>"Madame la Comtesse desires particularly to be received, sir.
She begs me to assure you that her errand is of the gravest. Short
of that, sir, I should not have ventured to disturb you."</p>

<p>"Of the gravest? Pish! The language of exaggeration. However,
you may bring her in."</p>

<p>The lady whom Laguyon introduced was of slender build and more
than middle height, cloaked in grey from neck to heel, her head
covered by what in England would have been called a Nithsdale
hood.</p>

<p>Mr Law rose and bowed. "Madame La Comtesse!"</p>

<p>Over her shoulder she watched the departure of the servant, and
not until the door had closed did she fully confront her host. She
thrust back her hood, her cloak rippled open, and she stood
revealed.</p>

<p>Mr Law fell back a pace, and for a long moment, this man, so
imperturbable in all circumstances, stared at her with dilating
eyes and parted lips, the natural pallor of his dark face slowly
deepening to the colour of lead.</p>

<p>Yet here was no Gorgon so to petrify him. No man who has written
of her, and many have done so, has failed to describe her as of an
uncommon beauty. It dwelt in no particular conformance with
accepted canons, but was of a more elusive, spiritual kind, a
radiance that glowed in her dark brilliant eyes, in the smile that
seemed ever about to break on her generous mouth.</p>

<p>Her russet hair, defying fashion, was dressed low, and a heavy
ringlet hung upon the white neck and shoulders that surged from a
rose-coloured bodice. Pallor was her norm, but not so deep as at
this moment when it made her eyes seem black. The rise and fall of
her breast betrayed a quickened breathing, and the faint quiver
perceptible on her lips told of an agitation that seemed poised
between laughter and weeping.</p>

<p>Mr Law's startled eyes were without lustre as, frowning, he
considered her.</p>

<p>"The Comtesse de Horn I was told..."</p>

<p>"I am the Countess of Horn," she said, in English.</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"Improbable, of course. Nevertheless the fact."</p>

<p>He took a step forward, his head craned. She made a gesture of
opening her arms, a gesture as of drawing a curtain apart so as to
make a fuller revelation of herself.</p>

<p>He passed a trembling hand across his eyes. His voice was husky.
"Fact, do you say? But you are Margaret; the Lady Margaret
Ogilvy."</p>

<p>"I was...in another life, when you were known as Jessamy John."
Then her voice assumed an edge of irony as she added "I am glad
that you have not quite forgotten me, although I am sure that you
will have tried."</p>

<p>The sting of it restored to him his self-possession. He
stiffened into his normal self. If irony was to her taste he knew
how to supply it in abundance.</p>

<p>"You were?" he said. "Ah, true! King William made you...Countess
of Orkney, was it? No, no. That was his other paramour, Elizabeth
Villiers. You...Of what did he make you a countess? Or was it a
duchess?"</p>

<p>The quiver of her lips was quickened. For a fleeting moment they
bore a grin of rigor, those lips to which he had known laughter to
come so readily and so irresistibly, from a nature wholly joyous.
She let her arms fall to her sides, as if nerveless and gazed at
him piteously through a blur of unshed tears. "Does it matter, what
I was or may have been? Let it suffice that it is as the Countess
of Horn that I am here."</p>

<p>"It will not surprise you if I understand less than ever why you
should have come."</p>

<p>"If you did, your welcome might be different. I have no purpose
but to save your life."</p>

<p>"My life! I seem to remember...No matter, I am not aware that it
is in any danger."</p>

<p>"That is why I have come. To make you aware of it." And, bitter
in her turn, she added, "Nothing less would have brought me."</p>

<p>Upon that, abruptly, in the baldest terms, she gave him her
message. The Parliament was to issue a writ for his arrest that
very day. It was to be executed at once. It was proposed to take
him secretly before the tribunal of La Tournelle, to try him,
sentence him and put him to death out of hand, before the news of
his case could get abroad, so as to make sure of no rescuing
intervention.</p>

<p>It was a moment before scornful laughter succeeded his
surprise.</p>

<p>"What wild, fantastic tale is this? And if so secret, madam, how
does it come within your knowledge?"</p>

<p>"The Count of Horn is in the plot. Sometimes he is indiscreet.
You may have noticed that, for I understand that you have been
intimate with him, though--God knows--you make odd bedfellows. Also
he drinks too much, and in his cups he boasts imprudently." It did
not escape Mr Law that there was a fierce contempt in her voice.
"Last night he boasted to me that with the Duke of Noailles'
assistance he is using the Parliament so as to destroy you. The
President de Mesmes, he declares, is a puppet whose strings are
pulled by him and the Duke."</p>

<p>Mr Law, on the edge of a sneer at this conception of wifely
duty, was stricken silent by an instant's consideration of a tale
that hung faultlessly together. Horn's vindictiveness working upon
the rancour of Noailles, and the Duke's employment of his influence
with a Parliament resentful of Mr Law's vast and increasing
influence, were facts that could not be dismissed. Whilst it might
seem incredible that the court of Parliament should dare to proceed
to such extremes, yet, when Mr Law came to think of it, he
discovered that he was utterly ignorant of the powers possessed by
that body or of the extent to which they might be exercised.</p>

<p>"But, in God's name, madam," he cried at last, his mind still
resisting conviction, "this cannot be done without some charge
against me. In what is it pretended that I have offended?"</p>

<p>"By unduly influencing the Regent in financial matters and the
danger that you, a foreign adventurer, should obtain control of the
State finances. That is to be the indictment, with perhaps
something more that I did not understand, something about
malversation of State bonds."</p>

<p>There was an end to his doubts. His prompt mind was swinging to
consider the action to be taken, when her next words showed that it
had already been considered for him.</p>

<p>"You have not an hour to lose. They may arrive at any moment now
to arrest you. They must not find you."</p>

<p>"Not find me? Am I to run away?"</p>

<p>"You'll lose less breath by that than by what they intend."
Almost was he more taken by her turn of phrase, that trick of
illuminating expression which he so well remembered, which had so
delighted him of old, than by what she actually told him.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand?" she said. "They are resolved to hang
you. The rest--trial and sentence--will be so much comedy."</p>

<p>"Myself, I hardly find it comic. But...Oh, they would never
dare. Why, it would be murder."</p>

<p>"Of course. But murder clothed in the robes of the judiciary,
wearing the mask of lawfulness. Will you wait for it?" She came a
step nearer in her impatience. "Don't you perceive what they fear
that they should act secretly? The Regent's intervention. Your only
safety lies in the Palais Royal until the Regent can handle them.
Come, John. I've told you there is no time to lose."</p>

<p>He took a moment yet to consider, then turned to cross to the
bell-pull. "I'll order my carriage."</p>

<p>"You'll be safer in mine," she told him. "It is at the door.
Your liveries might even cause you to be seized upon the way."</p>

<p>He realized, of course, the prudence of this, and yielded out
for fear for his life; yet reluctant to accept a gift at her hands,
he faltered a little as he said: "You are very good."</p>

<p>Delivered of her scarcely veiled suspense, she laughed in
relief, and it was in this laughter, displaying her strong, white
teeth, lighting a face to which her colour was returning, that her
full beauty and allurement were revealed. "I came to rescue you,
and it is not my way to do things by halves." But even as she spoke
that radiant laughter perished on her lips, and observing this, he
wondered. She drew her hood over her head again, and her tone
became peremptory. "Come, John. We had best make haste."</p>

<p>He was moving to hold the door for her when from below came the
rumble of another coach entering the courtyard, and, as he checked
to listen, the tramp of feet brought to a halt by a word of
command.</p>

<p>They looked at each other wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"My God!" she exclaimed in distress. "Am I too late?"</p>

<p>He stepped swiftly to the window, and looked down. "Archers," he
said as he turned again to face her. Whatever he may have felt, he
displayed no alarm. He even smiled. "It certainly makes your
information appear correct."</p>

<p>She wrung her hands. "John! John! You are caught."</p>

<p>"No, no. Not yet. Wait."</p>

<p>He was standing in thought when Laguyon came in quickly, his
lean face reflecting alarm. "Monsieur, there is an officer below,
asking for you, with a detachment of archers and a carriage."</p>

<p>"So I've seen." He was quite calm. "Desire him to give himself
the trouble of waiting a few moments. Say that I shall not keep him
long. Then bring me my hat and cane and wait for me in the
gallery."</p>

<p>As Laguyon departed, Mr Law turned to the Countess, who stood
dismayed and trembling. "You are going?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Of course. But not as you suppose. There is fortunately a
service entrance in the Rue Colbert. Since they have no reason to
believe me alarmed, they are not likely to be guarding it. My
steward will conduct you to your carriage. You will add to my debt
if you will drive away in it and round to that back entrance. I
shall be waiting for you there. Come."</p>

<p>He crossed again to the door that led to the anteroom.</p>

<p>"You are sure, John? You are sure?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There is no cause to doubt. Come."</p>

<p>He was to remember afterwards that in opening the door, his ears
had caught the quick, silken rustle of a gown. In the preoccupation
of the moment he paid no heed to it.</p>

<p>They crossed the anteroom and emerged upon the balustraded
gallery to find Laguyon already at the head of the marble stairs
with Mr Law's hat and cane.</p>

<p>"The officer is waiting, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Very well. Ask him to be patient for yet a moment longer.
Meanwhile you will reconduct Madame la Comtesse to her
carriage."</p>

<p>He remained at the stairhead until the rumble of wheels below
announced her departure. Then he went briskly on, and quitted the
gallery by a narrow doorway on his right.</p>

<p>When her coach drew up at the entrance in the Rue Colbert, he
was waiting. The vehicle rolled away at speed as soon as he had
jumped in, turned into the Rue des Bons Enfants and so gained the
Rue Saint Honoré.</p>

<p>With the danger now behind him, Mr Law became increasingly
conscious of the oddness of his situation and of the presence of
this lady who sat so stiffly erect beside him, the lady whom he had
met with insult and to whom it might well be that he now owed his
life. In all this there was much that he did not understand, much
that he required to know, yet knew not how to ask.</p>

<p>"You have placed me deeply in your debt," he murmured. "Which is
detestable to you, of course."</p>

<p>"I could not be so ungracious as to agree."</p>

<p>"Could you not? Lord! Must we be formal, John?"</p>

<p>Whilst he observed how free she was with his name, he could not
bring himself to make use of hers. "Is it formal to acknowledge
what we owe? Let me hope that at least it will have no...no
unpleasant consequences for you."</p>

<p>"Why should there be consequences?"</p>

<p>"From what you have told me, it is...your husband who is the
instigator of the action against me."</p>

<p>"And from that you'll be inferring that my regard for you is
greater than my regard for the Count of Horn."</p>

<p>"I should not permit myself the liberty of drawing inferences
concerning you."</p>

<p>"You have never done so, have you?" There was a hardening of her
tone.</p>

<p>He took a moment's thought before answering firmly: "Never."</p>

<p>"Really! Never? Well, you should know."</p>

<p>"Nor am I vain enough, I hope, to draw the inference that you
suggest."</p>

<p>"You may save your tears. The disloyalty I practise in helping
you sits lightly on my conscience. And not for the first time. I
served you as well as I could at Sceaux by guarding your wife. It
is fortunate that Margaret Ogilvy was only a name to her, that she
had never met me face to face, or my task might not have proved so
easy."</p>

<p>She broke off on a sudden subdued cry of alarm.</p>

<p>She had drawn aside the leather curtain, and put her head out of
the coach, to withdraw it instantly.</p>

<p>They were approaching the open space before the Palais Royal,
and by the tall iron gates she had caught sight again of the blue
coats and red facings of a group of archers. She supposed them
posted there by the Parliament for just such an eventuality, and
said so.</p>

<p>Mr Law, however, was not perturbed. "It is not likely," he said.
"But set me down at the side door in the Rue de Richelieu."</p>

<p>She pulled the cord, and to the footman, who came to the window
as the coach was checked, she gave the order. They swung to the
right, and halted presently at the door by which Dubois, in the
days when he was content with the role of pandar, was in the habit
of introducing the little ladies brought there to beguile the
leisure of the young Duke.</p>

<p>A footman let down the step, but Mr Law was not pressed to
descend.</p>

<p>"Make haste," she urged him, "before you are seen."</p>

<p>"I am without words..." he was beginning.</p>

<p>"All the better. There is no time for them."</p>

<p>"They must keep then until I see you again."</p>

<p>"Will that be necessary?"</p>

<p>He was jolted. "There is so much I should wish to know."</p>

<p>"But nothing you would be the happier for knowing." She touched
his hand lightly. "Goodbye, John. Believe that I am glad to have
served you. Go now."</p>

<p>He swung round so as to face her squarely, and in the
wistfulness of her eyes he found encouragement to insist. He was
deeply moved. "Let me see you again."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "It is not even likely that there will be
the occasion. I am but a bird of passage. Lately come, I shall
shortly go again. Give thanks as I do for my brief passage. I was
sent to play Providence. That is all." She held out her hand. "Let
us part friends, John--for old times' sake." Her voice broke on the
words.</p>

<p>"Friends!" he echoed, with a touch of bitterness. Then, at last,
he used her name. "Margaret!" He bore her gloved fingers to his
lips, sprang from the coach and vanished through the little doorway
into the palace.</p>

<p>The footman put up the step and swung to his place behind. The
coach rolled away. Behind its leather curtains the woman sat
rigidly erect, staring straight before her with eyes that the tears
were blinding.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter 12 -- THE BED OF
JUSTICE</h2>

<p>Mr Law sought in the first instance the Abbé Dubois and put him
in a rage as much by the news he brought as by the fact that the
Abbé's own spies should have left him in ignorance of what was
being plotted. Having exhausted profanity, his reverence applied
his wits. "By whom were you warned?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Does it matter?"</p>

<p>"It matters that we should know if the thing is true."</p>

<p>"If I were not persuaded of that I should not be using back
doors, and I should not be here now."</p>

<p>The ferrety little eyes peered sharply. The Abbé stroked his
hollow cheeks. "No. I suppose not. No. And here, you are safe. But
you can't remain indefinitely. Of course you don't wish to. No. But
before you go again we must see that the Parliament is brought to
order once for all. There's more in this, I tell you, than just
your own case. Let me consider."</p>

<p>Not until a couple of hours later did Dubois send the Regent a
prayer for audience, and conduct to him not only Mr Law, but also
the Duke of Saint-Simon and the Chancellor d'Argenson, both of whom
he had summoned to the Palais Royal by making free with the
Regent's name.</p>

<p>His Highness had just dined, that is to say, he had just
consumed the cup of chocolate that constituted his noontide meal,
to be taken only when the main labours of the day had been
performed. It happened that this afternoon Madame de Parabère kept
him company in his study, whilst he sought relaxation in painting.
Monsieur de Parabère had lately died, which Saint-Simon, in his
charitable way, regarded as the most considerate thing he had ever
done. His magnificent lady bore her widowhood with manifest
resignation.</p>

<p>Three oranges on a green dish and a jug of blue Delft ware
supplied the elements of the still-life composition that engaged
His Highness. Perhaps because he was encountering difficulties he
turned the less reluctantly from his easel to face his
visitors.</p>

<p>"What is this, Abbé?" he grumbled. "Am I never to rest?"</p>

<p>Madame de Parabère stirred in her armchair.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she suggested, "one of these gentlemen can tell you
whether I am right about that shadow."</p>

<p>"It is not likely. Still, take a look, Messieurs." He waved his
mahlstick towards the model. "Can any of you tell me what is the
colour of the shadow cast by that vase?"</p>

<p>Mr Law took it upon himself to furnish another question by way
of answer. "But is a shadow ever anything but black?"</p>

<p>The Regent shrugged and flung upwards a glance of hopeless
invocation. "The ignorance of the clever!" he sighed.</p>

<p>"Just so," said Dubois. "The clever are clever because of their
ignorance of things which it is not worth while to know. Monsieur
Lass at the moment is concerned with shadows far deeper than any
that your Highness can paint."</p>

<p>The Regent set his mahlstick across the pegs of his easel,
thrust his brushes into a vase, laid down his palette, and slewed
round to face them.</p>

<p>"So be it. Let us, then, talk of something that you understand.
It is evident that you come with news; experience suggests that it
is probably disagreeable. Ah me!"</p>

<p>It fell naturally to the lot of Mr Law, as the person chiefly
concerned, to enlighten His Highness. It had the effect of
darkening with weary disgust that florid countenance.</p>

<p>"Incredible," he said. "Outrageous! I should not believe it but
for what happened two days ago. A messenger from de Mesmes waited
upon me with a request for the suspension of the money edict,
warning me that the Parliament would not disperse until it had my
answer. I replied that nothing would please me better than that its
members should sit until they rotted.</p>

<p>"Of course, Baron, Monsieur de Noailles has never forgiven you
for losing him the presidency of the Council of Finance, whilst
Monsieur de Horn brought me a complaint that you had robbed him of
a fortune, and the Parliament dislikes you because it fears in our
financial plans a threat to its authority. Even so, what you tell
me lends them an incredible temerity. You'll have some evidence
that they actually seek your life?"</p>

<p>"I have it from a trustworthy source, which I am not able to
disclose."</p>

<p>"And they would really set my will at naught, would they,
rescind my edicts and present me with a <i>fait accompli</i> of
that magnitude?" Elbow on knee and chin in hand, the Regent sat
forward, frowning. "Incredible!" he said again.</p>

<p>Madame de Parabère laughed. "Haven't you discovered that it is
always the incredible that happens? Yet here it is not so
incredible as you suppose. Your excessive good nature, Philippe, is
the encouragement of those gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Ah!" He looked at her with crooked smile. "Little raven, you've
been listening to Saint-Simon."</p>

<p>"No, no," the Duke protested. "Madame merely sees what is
obvious to everyone but Your Highness." With the familiarity he had
ever employed with the Regent since the days when they had been
playmates, he now continued: "Your easy-going ways have robbed you
of all authority with those mutineers, and where a frown of yours
should suffice to quell them, you may now have to employ
artillery."</p>

<p>"They're drunk with vanity and presumption," boomed d'Argenson.
"They keep encroaching, and they grow by what they feed on."</p>

<p>Saint-Simon took up the tale. "They're conceiving themselves not
a Parliament in our sense, but a Parliament in the English manner,
which is a legislative assembly representing the entire
nation."</p>

<p>"With powers," Mr Law reminded the Regent, "to bring even the
King to account, as happened in the case of Charles the First."</p>

<p>"<i>Peste</i>! I don't think that is quite in the best taste,"
the Regent reproved him.</p>

<p>But the words were almost smothered by Saint-Simon in his haste
to add: "They will justify themselves by representing what they do
as done in the interests of France. Governing bodies are never more
suspect than when they plausibly urge the interest of the people
and act under the mask of public benefaction."</p>

<p>"It will need great firmness, monseigneur," said Dubois.</p>

<p>The Parabère laughed. "You'll have to supply him with it,
Monsieur l'Abbé."</p>

<p>But His Highness was less amiable than usual. "Chut! Quiet!" he
growled at her. "Jests are out of season." His face displayed
weariness and irritation. "In God's name, what can I do? Summon the
States-General?"</p>

<p>D'Argenson was prepared with advice. "A bed of justice will
suffice, Highness." And he went on to remind them that the last one
held to recall the Parliament to a sense of its duty had been
attended by the late King, who came to it unceremoniously in a grey
riding-suit, so as to mark his lack of respect for the assembly,
and brandishing a riding-switch with which he had all the air of
threatening its members. It was high time, thought d'Argenson, to
renew a salutary impression which by now had worn off.</p>

<p>From this they came to a discussion of the details of that bed
of justice which is a matter of history. You will remember the
craftiness with which it was planned, so as to take the members
entirely by surprise, even to the extent of not holding it at
Versailles, but of bringing the King to the Tuileries.</p>

<p>By this expedient the Regent avoided giving the members notice
until they were already in session in their own palace, leaving
them no more than the time necessary to reach the royal presence.
This last-moment summons constrained them--one hundred and
fifty-three red-robed magistrates--to come on foot by streets that
were lined with troops as an intimidating display of royal
power.</p>

<p>There, in the Tuileries, two days after it had been planned in
the Regent's study, in the presence of the enthroned royal child,
mantled in ermine, sceptre in hand, supported by the princes of the
blood, the bastards and the peers, d'Argenson, as Chancellor and
mouthpiece of the King, scarcely concealed the satisfaction with
which, in his own phrase, he set about washing the heads of those
too-daring gentlemen of the robe.</p>

<p>His voice resonant, his tone harshly denunciatory, he began by
reminding them that they were a judicial and not a legislative
body, and that to assume the functions of the latter amounted to a
usurpation involving the severest penalties. He based his
definition upon citations by Kings Francis I and Charles IX,
unequivocally confirmed by the late King Louis XIV whom they would
remember as having come before them without any sort of ceremony,
and with an unpleasant grin he let fall a reminder of the existence
of the Bastille.</p>

<p>Next he announced to them that the decree by which they had
presumed to repeal the royal edict for the banking of revenue had
been quashed by the Council of Regency, and that any attempt to
publish their decree would amount to a breach of the law and be
attended by condign punishment.</p>

<p>The King, he thundered, required them to cease from abusing the
right of remonstrance graciously restored to them by the Regent.
Unless they preferred to be again deprived of it, let them keep
within the limits of that which concerned their functions; let them
confine themselves to processes of law between His Majesty's
subjects, and not again intrude, as they had lately presumed to do,
upon affairs of State.</p>

<p>He ended on the minatory assurance that lack of compliance would
be attended by the severest pains and penalties to each one of
them, and that in the event of any repetition of their offence they
could not hope to be treated with the leniency which His Majesty
graciously and clemently showed them on this occasion.</p>

<p>They might scowl and writhe under the fierce contemptuous rasp
of d'Argenson's tongue, under his covert threat of the Bastille for
some of them, under the undisguised and sneering smiles of the
peers, but their courage broke and withered, and they bowed their
heads in sullen obedience.</p>

<p>The Chancellor had entered into no details of the offence
contemplated against Mr Law, nor had the Scot's name been so much
as mentioned. Nevertheless, the gentlemen of the Parliament
perfectly understood that it was their sinister project concerning
him which had brought upon them the humiliation of that bed of
justice.</p>

<p>If, understanding, they hated Law the more, yet at the same time
they came to fear him as they had never feared him until now. They
assumed that in some way, forewarned of what was plotting, he had
exercised upon the Regent an influence great enough to have
produced their shameful discomfiture.</p>

<p>Apprehensive of yet worse to follow, they sent their
Vice-President Blamont to offer Mr Law their excuses that,
misguided by prejudiced counsellors, they should have contemplated
a course the error of which they now perceived with profound
regret.</p>

<p>To Monsieur de Blamont they joined the old Maréchal de Villeroy,
who had been in the plot because he resented the government of
French finances by any foreigner, and the Duke of Aumont, who had
been working in the interest of the Maines. In addition to offering
the Parliament's apologies, they came to beg Mr Law to employ his
good offices so as to bring about their reconciliation with the
Regent.</p>

<p>Mr Law, who had now tranquilly returned to the Hôtel de Nevers
after two nights spent in Dubois' quarters at the Palais Royal,
chilled that deputation by his frosty urbanity. In tones that
expressed the very opposite he professed to value their
representations and assured them that he would do their errand to
the Regent. Thus he dismissed them, without, however, quite
removing from them the haunting fear of the Bastille.</p>

<p>Actually the moment chosen to approach him could hardly have
been less favourable. He had returned home a few hours earlier to
be confronted with an indignant Catherine, who desired peremptorily
to know where he had spent the last two nights. His answer had been
short and simple: "At the Palais Royal."</p>

<p>Her lip had curled in sarcastic unbelief. "And the Countess of
Horn? Was she there, too?"</p>

<p>Of the resentment provoked by her constant and groundless
suspicions his cold exterior had never given sign; nor did he give
it now, when the resentment she aroused was deeper and more bitter
than it had ever been.</p>

<p>"If I thought that you ask for information I should supply it.
But for questions that are mere ill-natured rhetoric I have no
answers."</p>

<p>"Indeed! And her ladyship's visit to you here? What sort of
rhetoric was that?"</p>

<p>"She brought me information of the first importance."</p>

<p>"A woman you pretended not to know?"</p>

<p>"It was no pretence."</p>

<p>"Indeed, a shorter word describes it better. It was just a
lie."</p>

<p>He sighed. "I wonder if the delight of others in your womanhood
has ever equalled my frequent regrets that you are not a man."</p>

<p>"Delight in my womanhood! What do you mean?" Indignation
crimsoned her from neck to brow. "Whom do you mean? Whom have you
in mind?"</p>

<p>"I seem to remember that there has already been mention between
us of the Count of Horn."</p>

<p>"The Count of Horn? You know that the Count has had of me no
more than my fingertips." The lovely, delicately featured face was
mottled and disfigured by anger. She stamped her foot. "You are
creating a diversion, to draw me away from your...your wickedness,
your falsity, your relations with this woman, whom you say you did
not know, yet who called you John and carried you off in her coach,
slyly, when you slunk out to join her at the back entrance. Perhaps
you thought I didn't know. Whither did she carry you? Dare you tell
me? Or would you prefer to tell the Count of Horn?"</p>

<p>"I have already told you. To the Palais Royal."</p>

<p>"You laugh! God a' mercy! You want to serve me tit-for-tat. I
think I begin to understand you."</p>

<p>"If only I could return the compliment."</p>

<p>"Or perhaps," she raged on, without heeding him, "you actually
find that carroty-headed woman to your taste. Go your ways, then. I
shall know what to do. I claim a like liberty."</p>

<p>For a moment he was tempted to tell her what, owing to a
laudable reticence in the Countess of Horn, she had not yet
discovered, that this lady was that Margaret Ogilvy for whose sake
he had killed Beau Wilson.</p>

<p>But he realized in time that the knowledge, far from producing a
surcease of her jealous frenzy, would supply it with additional
fuel, and might drive her to incalculable lengths. So he held his
tongue and left her to the wild surmisings of his infidelity, which
his icy demeanour made her ever, and, as Will would have told him,
not unnaturally, prone.</p>

<p>It may have been fortunate for him that in those days there was
much else to engage his mind and so provide not only relief from
his unhappy domestic circumstances, but a balm for old wounds, an
anodyne to the pain aroused in him by that renewed if fleeting
contact with Margaret Ogilvy.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13 -- TREASONABLE
PRACTICES</h2>

<p>A small group of disgruntled gentlemen, brought together to
condole with one another were exchanging heated words in the
library of Monsieur de Noailles' mansion at Vincennes. They were
the men chiefly concerned in the Parliament plot: the President de
Mesmes and the Vice-President Blamont, shaken to the soul of them
and still in fear of arrest, the old Maréchal de Villeroy,
persuaded that he was in like case, the young Duc d'Aumont, that
lackey of the Maines, representing their interests, and the Count
of Horn, the bitterest of them all in his disappointment.</p>

<p>They were almost lachrymose until Noailles, provoked by a sneer
from Horn, made the assertion that their failure could have
resulted only from betrayal.</p>

<p>"My God, here's shrewdness!" mocked the Count. "Where we lacked
it was in not foreseeing that with such a multitude ours would be a
secret of Polichinelle."</p>

<p>"A multitude?" said de Mesmes. "There were not ten men with
knowledge of what was actually intended. Besides ourselves, the
Vice-President Blamont, and the Councillor Beaumanoir, the only
others who knew our full intent were the Duke and Duchess of Maine,
and they would certainly not betray it."</p>

<p>"It's not so much a matter of betrayal as of indiscretion," said
d'Aumont.</p>

<p>"That," quavered the old Maréchal, "is the least that can be
said."</p>

<p>"It's the most," d'Aumont insisted.</p>

<p>"I ask myself," said Horn, "who can have talked."</p>

<p>"Do you ask yourself or do you ask us?" Noailles demanded.</p>

<p>The Count's hackles went up. "After all, you are right. Why
should I ask myself?"</p>

<p>"Because you may know the answer."</p>

<p>"Is that an innuendo?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be quite plain. If anyone has talked it's likeliest to
be you. You drink too much, Count, and men who drink too much
commonly talk too much."</p>

<p>"Ah, but this is more than I'll endure. It amounts to an
accusation, and that without a grain of evidence."</p>

<p>D'Aumont struck in to avert a quarrel. "Gentlemen, are we to
wrangle over something which, if done at all, will have been done
by inadvertence and cannot now be undone? I am sure that the
sensible course is to stand together so as to repair matters, and
find other ways to achieve our aim."</p>

<p>"A timely reminder, Monsieur le Duc," de Mesmes approved, whilst
Villeroy was asking, "What have you in mind?"</p>

<p>"Why, this is how I see it. Lass' crazy schemes will be the ruin
of France."</p>

<p>"We discovered that some time ago," sneered Noailles. "In fact,
before we planned to have the Parliament deal with him."</p>

<p>"The difficulty," grumbled Villeroy, "lies in bringing it home
to the dog. The least that one can say is that his gambling
ventures prosper."</p>

<p>"For the moment," said d'Aumont. "It's commonly the case for a
while with gamesters. The danger is that even if they didn't
prosper, the Regent would still support him."</p>

<p>"By God, Duke, you never said anything truer," was Horn's bitter
comment, remembering his own case.</p>

<p>Noailles was not conciliated. "If we are to content ourselves
with stating the obvious we shall make no progress."</p>

<p>"We shall make no progress in any case as long as the Regent
shields him," said d'Aumont. "That's obvious, too. But it's as well
to state it. It perhaps points the way."</p>

<p>"In God's name," quavered Villeroy, "the way to what?"</p>

<p>The others were staring round-eyed at d'Aumont. He nodded,
tight-lipped. "I see that you understand. Well, there it is, and we
may as well face it. As long as the Regent is where he is, Monsieur
Lass will keep his heel on our necks."</p>

<p>Noailles grew stern. "As long as the Regent is where he is? Let
us understand you. Are you proposing that the Regent be
removed?"</p>

<p>D'Aumont affected a laugh. "I am proposing nothing. I am plainly
stating a situation."</p>

<p>This was too much for Noailles. He came to his feet. "A plain
statement that is an invitation to treason."</p>

<p>Again d'Aumont laughed. "An invitation to nothing. It is not for
me to be inviting. Yet since treason is mentioned, it might be well
to consider whether the greater treason, the treason to this
France, which we all agree a foreign adventurer is ruining, should
not forbid us to remain inert. But, I repeat, I merely indicate. I
do not advocate."</p>

<p>Noailles' quick answer forestalled any other. "It is well for
you, Monsieur le Duc, that you circumscribe that treasonable
opinion. You make it plain that to talk further at present is at
best a waste of time. I trust that no one else could even bear to
look along the road of which Monsieur d'Aumont says that he merely
indicates the existence."</p>

<p>D'Aumont became voluble in protesting his repugnance to any
measures against the Regent. Actually, all his aim was to bring
home to them how idle it was at present to talk of concerting
measures for dealing with Monsieur Lass. It convinced none of them;
but at least it enabled them to dine together in harmony and amity
at Noailles' table.</p>

<p>Least of all did it convince Horn. He had been at Sceaux, and in
that atmosphere so openly and poisonously hostile to the Regent, he
had seen how close was d'Aumont in the councils of the Duchess. It
was clear enough to him that d'Aumont sought to exploit the present
situation in her service, and being actuated by none of Noailles'
high-principled loyalty, the Count knew no reason why he should
scruple, in the pursuit of his vindictiveness against Law, to hurt
a Regent who had so brutally dismissed his plaint.</p>

<p>Therefore, having contrived to return to Paris in the Duc
d'Aumont's coach, he went straight to the heart of the matter,
applauding the Duke's clearsightedness and agreeing that the
Regent's protection of Lass was in the present circumstances an
outrage to be resented by every true Frenchman.</p>

<p>Of course, d'Aumont agreed with warmth. "In fact, when all is
weighed, we discover that it is not really Lass who is ruining
France, but the Duke of Orléans."</p>

<p>"The shrewd old King foresaw it," Horn agreed, "when he provided
otherwise for the Regency."</p>

<p>"You are not alone in perceiving it. There are those with no
interest at heart but that of France, whose proper aim is to right
this wrong."</p>

<p>"I rejoice to hear it. More, I should always be ready to bear a
part in so laudable an undertaking. It would be an honour and a
duty."</p>

<p>Now, however much Horn might be regarded as a debauched fribble,
it remained that by virtue of his lofty connections his name was of
weight in Europe, and would be of particular weight in Spain, to
which the Maines were looking for redress of their wrongs. Hence,
when he expressed himself so frankly, d'Aumont perceived no reason
not to be equally frank.</p>

<p>"The Parliament, overborne by the Duke of Orléans, has removed
the Duke of Maine from the Regency. Against that there is now no
appeal. He could be restored only by the King of Spain, who stands
nearest to the throne of France, and as the late King's grandson,
is actually the real heir presumptive, and therefore the natural
Regent. He should be invited to take the office and then govern by
deputy."</p>

<p>"And that deputy," said Horn, to whom much was now clear,
"would, of course, be the Duke of Maine."</p>

<p>"Of course. There would then be an end to these abuses, to this
dissolute governing by harlots, rakes, and money-changers."</p>

<p>"Not before it is needed, by God," said Horn, with virtuous
fervour. "Count upon me for one."</p>

<p>"I rejoice to do so. You not only perceive the right, you wish
to uphold it. That, my dear Count, is the true nobility."</p>

<p>It remained for d'Aumont only to persuade Horn to pay another
visit to Sceaux and offer himself to the Duchess, who would give
him a glad welcome and enrol him in the growing army that under her
direction was working to this noble end.</p>

<p>Having pledged himself, Monsieur de Horn went home to request
his Countess to prepare for this jaunt into the country on the
morrow. He found her deep in Montesquieu's <i>Lettres Persanes</i>,
which had lately appeared, wearing a gown of shimmering silk of
palest green without panniers, so that her admirable shape and
lovely length of limb were not dissembled.</p>

<p>Under its crown of lustrous russet hair her face and neck and
breast were of a creamy pallor. All this and the brilliant eyes and
vivid lips that seemed ever laughter-laden, which once had
disturbed the senses of a king by no means ardent, and once had
driven the Count of Horn to such distraction as almost to have
changed his nature, made him deplore the lack of affection in the
gaze with which she returned his own.</p>

<p>"To Sceaux," she said. "I wonder what attraction you find there
that you should wish to return so soon. Or is the Baroness Lass
again to be of the company?"</p>

<p>"The Baroness Lass!" His tone and grimace were convincing
denial. "Reassure yourself, madame. It will not be the sort of
attraction you will be suspecting."</p>

<p>"Suspecting!" She smiled, with a flash of perfect teeth. "I am
not suspecting. I was asking. But it is of no importance."</p>

<p>He was goaded by her calm into a full and boastful disclosure of
the part he hoped to play in pulling down the Regent, so that he
might afterwards square the account with that thieving dog of a
compatriot of hers who had robbed him of a fortune.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she suggested, "it was his way of forestalling your
attempt to rob him of a wife."</p>

<p>His annoyance was the sharper, because of the truth he discerned
in this, a truth he was not even concerned to dissemble. "I would
to God I had never seen the sickly creature."</p>

<p>Her laugh was not in the least wifely. "You thought to grasp a
wanton, and found a prude. A thorny prude. My dear, I commiserate
you. These vexations are occasionally inevitable in such a career
as yours. As for this revenge you contemplate, it is no affair of
mine. And, of course, my opinion will not weigh with you. Yet I am
impelled to say that you would be better advised to keep away from
the Maines and their plots, or you may end by suffering more than
mere banishment from Court."</p>

<p>He stood over her, tall, handsome, and sneering. "You are
right," he said.</p>

<p>She raised her brows. "Surprising admission!"</p>

<p>"I mean you are right that your opinion will not weigh with
me."</p>

<p>"Forgive me. I was stupid. I am stupid sometimes."</p>

<p>"Often. But it is no matter. This is Monday. We shall go to
Sceaux on Thursday."</p>

<p>"You mean that you will go."</p>

<p>"And that you will accompany me. Her Grace will be glad to
welcome us again."</p>

<p>"Maybe. But I don't think I care to be welcomed by her Grace. I
lack your interest in her honey flies. And in any case, I shall be
leaving in the morning with Lady Stair for Saint Germain, and we
shall not return until Saturday."</p>

<p>"You refuse, then, to come with me."</p>

<p>"I have been endeavouring to say so--politely."</p>

<p>He clenched his hands. "You are resolved to infuriate me."</p>

<p>"Must we exaggerate? It is only that I do not care for the
posturing company at Sceaux, and that I am pledged to Lady
Stair."</p>

<p>Her mocking air, even more than her words, made him bid her go
to the devil and stalk out in fury.</p>

<p>It was intolerable that a man of his birth and station should be
unable to constrain a mutinous wife, or even be in a position to
threaten that he would close the Paris house and dismiss the
servants. Such a threat in his straitened circumstances would be a
<i>brutum fulmen</i>; for of the house, which was hired, it was she
who bore all the costs of maintenance.</p>

<p>If on their first meeting in London two years ago her
provocative beauty had enthralled him just as his own good looks
and lofty birth had made him acceptable to her, yet but for the
great wealth of which she disposed and the great estate of
Harpington, of which she bore the title, it would never have
occurred to him to seek her in wedlock.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had been less than prudent in neglecting to make sure
of the exact tenure of that wealth. Because he was entirely
mercenary he must be at more than ordinary pains to avoid revealing
the fact; and as a result it was not until after marriage that
money came to be discussed between them. Trusting in a husband's
rights over a wife's property he had known no misgivings. The
greater, therefore, was the shock that awaited him.</p>

<p>In the rich Harpington estates he discovered that she possessed
no more than a life interest, with trustees who had it in their
power to exercise a measure of control over the considerable
revenue she derived from it; so that even this could not be
accounted free, and certainly not free enough to permit him to
control more of it than she chose to allow.</p>

<p>In the cruel light of that discovery, it seemed to the Count
that he had overrated both her beauty and her charm. Disillusioned,
he cast aside the mask of amativeness, cursed the fates which had
tricked him into marriage, and resumed his normal ways of life
rather sooner and more flagrantly than he might otherwise have
done.</p>

<p>As for her, equally disillusioned, she regretted that she had
not given heed to her brother, Stephen Ogilvy, who had been under
no misapprehension concerning either his sister or her very ardent
wooer. He knew the bruised condition of her heart, and how
vulnerable it left her to an approach that came arrayed in
deferential tenderness. He justly appraised the appeal to her
senses of Horn's external graces and the claim upon her vanity of
the wooing of a man of his almostly princely station. And he judged
it a fire that would be soon burnt out.</p>

<p>An attempt of his to dissuade her from the marriage had almost
led to a rupture between them. But when things fell out as he had
foreseen and much sooner than he had foreseen, it was he who had
shown her the weapons she possessed in her revenues and exactly how
to wield them for her self-protection.</p>

<p>Thus she had remained mistress of the situation. The
establishment in the Rue d'Argenteuil was maintained because she
chose to maintain it. For the rest, she practised no petty meanness
with her husband. From time to time she even supplied him with sums
of money for his needs, most of which he had gamed or else spent on
other women. In this he had been quite flagrant, and had she
reproached him, she would have stirred in him no emotion but
surprise.</p>

<p>He would amusedly have reproved an outlook more proper to the
wife of a tradesman in viewing the world of fashion. But she did
not reproach him. She amazed herself when, the mask being off,
after so brief an experience of marriage, she found herself
contemplating his true countenance with utter indifference; more,
almost, it seemed, with relief, as if the revelation severed a bond
that had secretly been irking her, and gave her back her freedom.
Understanding followed, and with it a measure of shame.</p>

<p>Stephen had been right. Horn had never touched more than her
senses. That bruised heart of hers, as Stephen knew, was quite
incapable of love, although to a man of worth she would have given
that duty and loyalty which the Count of Horn could certainly not
command.</p>

<p>So that his raging departure from her presence left her
supremely indifferent, whilst the prospect of his departure from
Paris was vaguely uplifting.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter 14 -- ADVENTURES OF
CATHERINE</h2>

<p>On the following morning, of a sultry day of August, the Count
of Horn went riding on the Cours la Reine, where the world of
fashion was wont to parade on horseback and in coaches, seeking the
cool by the river and the shade of the chestnuts.</p>

<p>He was without purpose beyond the need for action and movement
that assails so many when out of humour. He came to suppose,
however, that he must have been inspired by fate to take horse that
morning, for ahead of him, on a beautiful white mare that was by
now as well known as her rider, he beheld the slim, elegant,
upright figure of Catherine Law.</p>

<p>She rode attended by a groom, who followed a couple of lengths
behind her. That she should ride there was no matter for surprise,
for it was the frequency with which he had trotted down the Cours
la Reine beside her which had first supplied food for scandal.</p>

<p>But that she should presently greet him with a smile of alluring
welcome was matter for surprise, indeed, considering the fierce
terms on which at Sceaux, for his excessive enterprise, she had
last dismissed him.</p>

<p>In his amazement he drew rein so violently as almost to bring
his horse upon its haunches. Then, finding that she, too, had
halted and that she maintained the invitation of her smile, he
ranged alongside of her, hat in hand, his head humbly bowed.</p>

<p>"This is gracious, madame. Exalting. It permits me to hope that
I am forgiven a rashness into which I was betrayed by worship?"</p>

<p>"I have forgotten it," she said, and added: "I have something to
say to you. You may ride with me if it be your pleasure."</p>

<p>"My pleasure! Oh, madame, the poor word to express my
emotion."</p>

<p>She laughed lightly, and touched her mare with her whip. As they
moved forward side by side, she glanced over her shoulder to make
sure that her groom remained out of earshot.</p>

<p>"Let me confess at once," she said, "that I have ridden here
daily for a week in the hope of meeting you."</p>

<p>This was to carry him from amazement to amazement.
"Madame..."</p>

<p>"That is not to be misunderstood. Circumstances have arisen to
suggest that we should become allies."</p>

<p>"Ah, that with all my heart, madame."</p>

<p>"There is the need," she gravely assured him. "Great need. For
our own protection." And she added the reason without waiting to be
asked. "Your Countess, Monsieur le Comte, is on terms that are too
intimate with my husband."</p>

<p>He was so taken aback as to forget his manners. "Ah, bah! To
what gossip have you been listening? She does not so much as know
him."</p>

<p>"Does she not? Yet she comes to visit him at the Hôtel de
Nevers, and she calls him by his Christian name. I tell you what I
have discovered. If she tells you that she does not know him, that
is further evidence of the guilty nature of their relations."</p>

<p>The oath with which he received the news was merely an
expression of his surprise. "Pray when was this?" he asked, his
tone still incredulous.</p>

<p>"A fortnight since. On Monday of the week before last."</p>

<p>Reflecting that that was the day on which the agents of the
Parliament had gone to the Hôtel de Nevers to arrest Law, only to
find that their bird had flown, he asked himself was it possible
that he now held, at last, the explanation of that flight.</p>

<p>If what Catherine told him were true, it must be that he had to
thank his Countess for warning Law. But how, he asked himself
further, could she have known what was intended? At once he found
the answer. He remembered how he had boasted to her what, by his
contriving, would be done to the Scot. Noailles, it seemed, after
all, had not been without grounds on which to suspect him of
indiscretion.</p>

<p>He drew rein in his sudden agitation. "Ah! The traitress," he
exclaimed. "She betrays me, then!"</p>

<p>He appalled his companion by a fury of which she entirely
misconceived the source. "No, no. That is not what I say. It is
impossible to believe that it is already so."</p>

<p>"Not for me. God! What a fool I've been not to have guessed it."
But in a measure as she conveyed conviction to him she found it
slipping from herself.</p>

<p>"I will not...I do not wish to believe it," she protested. "All
my hope is that there is yet time to prevent this thing. That is
why I appeal to you. Between us we could...Surely we could
frustrate their wicked hopes."</p>

<p>"Their wicked hopes?" He perceived at last how they were at
cross-purposes. "Shall we ride on?" he invited, and after they had
set their horses in motion again he remained silent, taking
thought.</p>

<p>"You see," she said presently, "what I mean when I say that we
should be allies?"</p>

<p>"Of course I see." He was in no haste to clear up her
misapprehension. In fact he was beginning to wonder what profit he
might find in it. Meanwhile he drew a bow at a venture. "And
there's something else I see: that the jade has all but ruined me
by her jealousy. By all time devils, madame, between your husband
and my wife it is likely to go hard with me, as with you. We are
both abused. You may well speak of an alliance. What else is left
us if we are to prevail against those betrayers?"</p>

<p>He checked, perceiving that his vehemence was drawing upon them
the inquisitive, questioning eyes of some of those they passed. He
drew still nearer and dropped his voice. "This is not a matter that
we can discuss in public here in the Cours la Reine. It is too
grave. Tell me, when can I come to you?"</p>

<p>This scared her. "Not to the Hôtel de Nevers. John would
know."</p>

<p>"For that I care nothing. But I cannot enter his house
considering what lies between us, nor can I ask you to come to
mine. What then?" He considered for a moment. "I have a sure
friend, one Colonel de Mille, a Piedmontese, who has a lodging he
would lend me in the Place du Roule. It is opposite the Church of
St Philippe, over a glover's shop, at the sign of a red hand."
Without waiting for her assent he added the question: "When will
you come?"</p>

<p>She changed colour; her breathing quickened. "But I could not.
You must see that I could not. It is impossible."</p>

<p>"Ah, madame, what is it that you fear? Detection? Take your
precautions. Come at dusk in a hackney coach."</p>

<p>"But if it were to become known? What would be thought? Oh, you
should not propose it."</p>

<p>"Nor should I if I knew of a safe alternative. But if we are to
resolve this ugly thing, if we are to study how to fight this
infamy, a meeting there must be. Perhaps you have a friend whom you
can trust."</p>

<p>She had not, she confessed, almost in tears, and so, yielding to
a little more persuasion, driven by jealousy, stifling misgivings,
she consented to come that evening to the Place du Roule.</p>

<p>She took the precaution of going veiled and closely hooded and
in a hackney coach, as Horn had suggested, to that dingy house.</p>

<p>A slatternly old woman admitted her to the gloom of a narrow
passage, where the air was fouled by a conjunction of evil smells.
With a leering assurance that she was impatiently awaited by the
Colonel's friend, the woman led the way up a creaking staircase.
The mephitic atmosphere took Catherine in the throat, and with the
dim illumination and the repellent guide, brought her a sense of
being soiled and degraded by the adventure.</p>

<p>Her pulses quickened by a vague apprehension and in ever-growing
reluctance, she came to the room above, where the Count awaited
her. It was small and meanly furnished, but at least it was well
lighted by a four-branched candlestick set on a shabby console
under a flyblown mirror. The young Count, tall, handsome and very
brave in blue velvet with thin gold lace, seemed in himself to
supply an adornment that partly redeemed the sordid setting.</p>

<p>He moved eagerly to receive her, yet with a reassuring
deference. He was voluble in gratitude to her for coming, conducted
her to a settee of faded tapestry, and offered her wine from a
flask which with a dish of cakes had been placed beside the
candlebranch.</p>

<p>"No, no. Nothing, I thank you." She was definite in her rather
breathless refusal. "You'll understand that I must not stay. My
coach is waiting. You will have given thought to our case. You will
have decided what measures we should take."</p>

<p>"Thought!" he echoed. "I have thought of nothing else since I
left you this morning; but a decision is not so easy. My wife has
gone to Saint Germain. She had left when I returned, so that I had
no chance to speak to her. The only way I could find to serve you
would be definitely to remove her to the country, to place the
little fool beyond the reach of your abominable husband."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Yes." Her hands were joined, her eyes raised eagerly
to his. "Yes. That might be the way."</p>

<p>"Ah!" He sighed, and sank to the settee beside her, yet leaving
as much distance between them as the seat permitted. "But it is not
certain. I could try persuasion, and I will. Unhappily I lack the
means to compel obedience, especially since your husband, out of
his cursed jealousy, has reduced me by his swindling tricks so that
I have hardly a louis to call my own."</p>

<p>"Out of jealousy?" She was puzzled. "Because of your wife?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Because of you, madame."</p>

<p>"Because of me?"</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you did not even suspect that you are the
innocent cause of my misfortunes? It should be plain. Monsieur Lass
does not want for perspicacity. He was quick to perceive how it
was--how it is--with me, how deeply I have come to worship
you."</p>

<p>"And he resented it?"</p>

<p>There was a sudden note of eagerness in her voice which he could
not understand. It was as if this were news that she would welcome.
He shrugged. "Naturally. Whatever licence he may claim in the
pursuit of his own gallantries, however indifferent he may be,
madame, to your feelings, yet he will not suffer himself to be made
ridiculous. He regards you as his chattel, and he will brook no
damage to his property."</p>

<p>Her flush, her angry gasp told him how swift was the action of
this poison. So he continued to pour it: "That, in fact, is what he
had the effrontery to tell me. Yet when I offered him the
satisfaction usual between gentlemen, even waiving the question of
my birth and station, the poltroon refused it."</p>

<p>"You...You would have fought for me!" She was in consternation.
"You would have put your life in danger..."</p>

<p>"Could I employ it more nobly? If you do not know that it is the
least that I would do for you, then you do not know me at all, and
it is no wonder that you have misunderstood me." There was a
disquieting throb of passion in his voice. "In effect, however,
Monsieur Lass preferred the weapons of his loathly trade, and by
those he has accomplished my ruin. But although my worship of you
has cost me more than a million, you are not to suppose that I
regret a louis of it. For I swear to you, that having conceived
this worship, I would not be without it to recover twice what I
have sacrificed, which is, in fact, every louis I possessed."</p>

<p>Here, coming from a man of such noble parts, was matter to
quicken the pulses of any but the most level-headed woman; and in
some measure it quickened Catherine Law's. Her glance was troubled.
"You...you are not to speak so." If it was a protest, it was also a
prayer.</p>

<p>"Why not? Why are we ever required to repress the truth?" In his
warmth he drew a little nearer. "What is there to impose restraint
upon me, married to that cold, treacherous compatriot of yours, or
upon you whose husband has no sense of any duty to you?" She was
raising a hand to check him, but he swept impetuously on. "We are
fools, Catherine; fools to be troubling to prevent something that
may not be prevented, that it may already be too late to
prevent."</p>

<p>"No, no!" It was almost a wail. "I'll not believe that. And,
fools or not, we must persevere. It is what I came here to consider
with you."</p>

<p>"And I have considered it from every aspect, but can find no
course of action."</p>

<p>"But you spoke of removing the Countess of Horn from
Paris..."</p>

<p>"And I warned you that I cannot constrain her."</p>

<p>"Yet you will endeavour? Is there no inducement you could offer,
no attraction elsewhere with which you could tempt her? Oh, give it
thought, I beg you. Surely, surely you can discover a way to set a
barrier between them."</p>

<p>"Because you ask me I must. Give me a little time yet. Perhaps
Lady Stair would help me. She has become attached to Margot, and if
I represent that it is a question of saving her from the designs of
Lass..."</p>

<p>"You have it," she broke in. "That surely is the way."</p>

<p>"Let me consider further," he begged, and drew nearer still, so
that he brought up against her.</p>

<p>As if the contact were frightening, she came instantly to her
feet.</p>

<p>"I must go." Again she was a little breathless. "It is not safe
to linger. I...I might be questioned."</p>

<p>With hands that trembled, she hastily lowered her veil and drew
up the hood of her long cloak, whilst he stood deferentially before
her. He could not but observe that he had scared her, and he was
too skilled to increase her fears by any rash insistence. "We must
confer soon again," he said. "As soon as I have found a way."</p>

<p>She looked round that abominable room, and inwardly shuddered at
the thought of a return to it. "I pray that it may not be
necessary. It is not safe. If it were known...If I were
followed..."</p>

<p>"Yet it would be wise that you should know what I propose. It
might well require your assistance. I'll send you word. Oh, but
guardedly, have no fear." He took up the candlebranch. "I will
light you down."</p>

<p>When he had watched her flutter like a frightened bird to her
coach, he climbed the stairs again, never heeding the obscene
cackle of the hag who kept the house, or her comment on the unusual
brevity of beauty's visit. Back in de Mille's room, he held the
candlebranch aloft to survey it. He realized that it could arouse
only repugnance in a dainty, fastidious soul nurtured in the
sybaritic luxury with which her husband surrounded her. But if he
took no satisfaction in quarters that certainly made up no Temple
of Venus, yet he thought he might rest content with the comedy he
had played, with the richness of his invention, and with the
restraints he had imposed upon it and upon himself.</p>

<p>No later than the morrow Fate played into his hands by
furnishing him a sound pretext for asking her to come to him again.
It happened that he visited the opera in a party organized by
Madame de Sabran, and that the Regent also chanced to be present,
accompanied in his box, as had sometimes happened of late, by Mr
Law.</p>

<p>Espying the Count of Horn, and perhaps not merely offended to
see him, but annoyed that he should be in the company of one of the
Regent's own leading favourites, His Highness spoke to La
Vrillière, who was in attendance.</p>

<p>"Is that man without the wit to take a hint, or is it out of
effrontery that he lingers here? See that he receives an order in
the morning to take himself into the country and not to come within
fifty leagues of the Court unless he is bidden. You may add that if
he is still reluctant to leave Paris we can find him a lodging
here. In the Bastille."</p>

<p>Of this, word came to Catherine Law towards noon of the next
day, in a note conveyed to her as she was stepping into her
carriage, by a flower girl, in a bunch of carnations.</p>

<p>When a footman would have thrust her aside, the girl raised her
voice in appeal, holding up her posy. "<i>Mes beaux oeillets</i>,
<i>madame</i>! Fresh from the gardens of Horn. From the gardens of
Horn, madame!"</p>

<p>To Catherine's servants this might be without significance; but
not to Catherine. "Let her come," she ordered. Taking the posy, she
bore it to her nostrils. "They are sweetly perfumed, child." She
gave her a piece of silver, and left her calling down blessings
upon the gracious lady's head.</p>

<p>Sitting well back in the coach, Catherine unwrapped the paper
sheath from the stems of the flowers, and found within it the note
she expected:</p>

<p>Calamity has descended upon me, to thwart my endeavours. I am
ordered into immediate exile, and must go not later than tomorrow.
This no doubt at the prompting of JL, who desires my removal. It is
important that we confer before I leave. I shall be waiting this
evening.</p>

<p>It bore no signature, and none was needed. It filled her with
dismay. Once the Count were removed, and assuming that his wife did
not accompany him, there would be no one and nothing to stand
between the Countess and Catherine's husband. The circumstance,
conveyed in the note, that Horn's exile was of John Law's
contriving, was only too credible and desperately alarming.</p>

<p>So, repellent though the notion might be of again visiting that
horrible house in the Place du Roule, Catherine braced herself to
it.</p>

<p>She was not to suspect that the rage of the gentleman she found
awaiting her was purely histrionic. Nothing could have appeared
more natural than that he should be distraught to find himself
banished at the instances of a cunning rival who desired a clear
field. She was not to suspect his secret certainty that the only
betrayal of which his wife was guilty was the betrayal to Monsieur
Lass of the Parliament's intrigue against him. True, he could
discover no explanation of why she should have warned her fellow
countryman, other than sheer malice towards himself; but with this
he was satisfied, convinced, in spite of Catherine's details, that
the Countess could have had no previous acquaintance with Law.</p>

<p>"Ah, madame," was his plaint, "this is monstrous, terrible. We
are the victims of a wicked pair who enjoy the advantage of being
well served by authority. As surely as I owe my banishment to your
husband, just as surely has he been prompted to procure it by my
wife. Not content with having ruined me utterly, with having robbed
me of my last liard, that wicked man is now to rob me of my
honour."</p>

<p>He stood over her, a tragic figure, whilst she once more
occupied the faded settle, and reflected genuinely his spurious
grief. From a velvet bag she drew a bundle of banknotes. "This
banishment," she said, "from what you've told me is made worse by
your financial distress. This may relieve it at least a little. It
is only three thousand louis, all that I can bring you now without
being detected."</p>

<p>"Madame!" There was horror in his voice. It was an outcry of
protest or refusal.</p>

<p>"It belongs to you. It is a little part of all that of which you
have been robbed, so you need not scruple to take it. Do not offend
me by refusing."</p>

<p>"Madame!" he cried again, and it was almost a sob. He sank to
the settle beside her, impulsively he caught her wrists and bore to
his lips the hand that held the notes. "The money...What is the
money to me? But the gesture...My God, Catherine, that is
everything. It brings me to tears that you should have this thought
for me."</p>

<p>"Take it. Take it," she insisted.</p>

<p>"In my need I am so mean as to allow myself to be persuaded. But
I take it only as a loan..."</p>

<p>"No loan. It belongs to you, and you shall have more."</p>

<p>The promise was easy of fulfilment out of her husband's
unstinting liberality.</p>

<p>"Yet from you, it must be no more than a loan. For what Monsieur
Lass owes me I shall render my accounts to himself when the time
comes." He took the bundle and tossed it carelessly on to the
console behind them. Then he was again kissing the hands he had not
relinquished, kissing them with a passionate fervour that began to
disturb her. She sought to withdraw them; but his clasp was firm.
"Your goodness intoxicates me. That you should have had this lovely
thought of me, of my necessities, moves me to the depths of my poor
soul. How shall I prove my gratitude; my gratitude and my deep
love?"</p>

<p>Again she strove to release her hands. "If we are to be
allies..." she was beginning, and her tone was of intercession.</p>

<p>"Allies certainly. But more, far more than allies. Let me prove
my devotion, my worship. What need those betrayers matter to us
when we have each other?"</p>

<p>"You are not to speak so, monsieur."</p>

<p>"How else? And why not? Our loyalties should be only for each
other? Ah, Catherine!" He loosed her hands at last, but only to
embrace her and draw her, struggling, against him.</p>

<p>White and trembling, a piteous entreaty in her lovely eyes, her
hands now straining against his breast, she implored him to be
calm, to release her. "I should not have come," she said. "I should
have known to what I exposed myself. Do not make me sorry that I
trusted you."</p>

<p>Instantly he let her go. He drew back, and rose. "How can you be
at once so kind and so cruel? You give thought for my trivial
needs." He waved a contemptuous hand towards the money on the
console. "Yet you deny my deeper ones." Abruptly he was on his
knees beside her. "Ah, Catherine, have you no pity? You see me
almost swooning at your feet, yet you repulse me. You give me
money! Dear God, do you think I thank you for that when you deny me
all else, when you withhold yourself? I was grateful only whilst I
supposed that it was an earnest of your love, of your response to
the passion that is burning me up."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" she murmured, as she might have urged a child.
"This is not right..."</p>

<p>"Not right!" He was tempestuous. "Then all is wrong. Is it not
right to listen to our hearts? Catherine, dear Catherine, in all
the world there is nothing that is more right." Again his arms
enlaced her, his head upon her breast, and whilst she stiffened,
she no longer attempted to release herself. "Why need it vex our
minds," he continued, "if those disloyal ones should have their
way, when it is ours to avenge ourselves by repaying them in the
same coin?"</p>

<p>He raised his head and leaned forward, boldly seeking her lips.
But from this her hands again defended her. Troubled by his gusty
passion, and panting in his clasp, she still protested. "If...If I
knew that repayment was due--if I were certain."</p>

<p>"Can you still doubt it?"</p>

<p>"I must. We have no proof. After all, it is only what we
suspect." Then on a firmer tone: "I am an honest woman," she
declared, "and very loath to be other. Only...only proof of John's
infidelity could change me. If I had that I should not care. But
before I am an outraged wife who avenges herself, I must be certain
of the outrage." She broke from him. It was as if she had found an
argument that put an end to hesitancy. She thrust him violently
away, moved aside and rose. "If your note brought me dismay, it
also brought me hope that you had found a way to...to prevent the
accomplishment of this betrayal. If that is not so, I must wonder
why you should have brought me here again."</p>

<p>Horn realized at last that he was dealing with a woman who under
all her levity still loved her husband enough to recoil from
infidelity. But in spite of that, and whilst inwardly raging, he
persisted. "I brought you so that I might warn you of what has
happened to me."</p>

<p>"And nothing more?"</p>

<p>"There was my need, my overwhelming need, to see you again
before I go."</p>

<p>To this she chose to pay no need. "Have I at least your promise
that you will endeavour to take the Countess of Horn away?"</p>

<p>He looked down on her from his fine height, and his dark liquid
eyes were sadly reproachful. "How you crucify me!" he complained.
"How you are at pains to let me see that all your concern is for
this worthless husband of yours."</p>

<p>"My concern is for myself, as I have shown you. And now you must
let me go. Tell me only where you are to be found if I should need
you."</p>

<p>He sighed and passed a hand wearily across his brow before
replying. "I shall go to Sceaux when I leave tomorrow."</p>

<p>"But that is not fifty leagues away."</p>

<p>"No. I must take the risk, so that for your sake I shall still
be near you if you should need me, as I shall constantly pray that
you may."</p>

<p>"But you will be in danger."</p>

<p>"Gladly if it earns me your sweet concern." He shrugged the
notion away. "If I go from Sceaux before you send for me, you shall
have word of it."</p>

<p>She bowed her head, murmuring her thanks. Her hands were drawing
up her hood. "Now light me down the stairs."</p>

<p>He did not move. He was pondering her with glowing eyes.
"Already! What an anxiety to be gone, to leave me. Ah, give me the
sweetness of your presence for a few moments yet. I do not even
know when I shall see you next. Do not be so avaricious of
yourself."</p>

<p>Her uneasiness was mounting once more under this torrential
pleading, apprehensive of worse to follow. His hand pulled down the
hood which she had now adjusted. His arms were again about her.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she begged.</p>

<p>But his clasp held her so tightly against him that she could not
even struggle. "Ah, Catherine, Catherine, don't deny me."</p>

<p>Paralysed in that firm embrace, which pinned her arms to her
sides, half swooning in panic, she felt herself lifted bodily and
borne helpless across the chamber.</p>

<p>"For pity's sake let me go," she feebly moaned. "Oh, this is
base! Base!"</p>

<p>His only answer was a whisper fierce and urgent. "Hush!
Hush!"</p>

<p>He reached the settle, and flung her down upon it. To do so,
however, his hold slackened, and as if revived by that measure of
release, once more she strove against him.</p>

<p>They fell to wrestling so furiously that the slamming of the
street door went unheeded by them.</p>

<p>It was not until a fumbling, clattering step upon the stairs and
a raucous snatch of song came to disturb his frenzy, that he
suddenly checked and fell back a pace to listen. Whilst, as for
her, those approaching sounds, which in that place at any other
time must have filled her with panic, now actually brought
relief.</p>

<p>Horn rapped out an ugly oath, and after a moment's breathless
listening pause, turned and sped to the door, with intent to make
it fast. But already he was too late. As he reached it, it was
flung violently open, and a large, gaudy man of middle age stood
blinking on the threshold.</p>

<p>At the spectacle that met him--the Count breathless and livid,
and the lady frantically restoring order in her disarray, whilst
panting and trembling she supported herself against the end of the
settle from which she had risen--a slow grin took shape on Colonel
de Mille's flushed face.</p>

<p>"Seems I intrude," he chuckled. He strove to be solemn, failed,
and loosed a cackling laugh. He advanced a pace or two, reeled
slightly aside on unsteady feet, swept off his hat, and bowed.
"<i>Serviteur</i>, madame." He turned sheepishly to Horn. "Devil
take me, Monsieur le Comte, I'd forgot you were here."</p>

<p>"Devil take you, indeed, you sot," snarled Horn.</p>

<p>"Eh, now that's damned uncivil. I don't care for it."</p>

<p>As they faced each other in truculence, Catherine perceived that
her way to the door was clear. With shaking hands she dragged the
hood over her head, pulled her cloak about her, and sped to the
threshold. Instinctively Horn moved to intercept her, only to find
the Colonel in his way.</p>

<p>"Stand aside, you drunken dog."</p>

<p>Far from obeying, annoyed by the epithet, de Mille leaned upon
him, using his weight, which was considerable. "Sorry if I intrude.
As I've said. Sorry. Curse me for a marplot if you will. That I can
forgive. But don't be uncivil. Don't say I'm drunk. And don't call
me a dog. I might bite you." Still stupidly barring Horn's way to
the door, he chuckled again. "What's troubling you? Your poor
little shy pullet? Bah! Let her go if she wants to. Never hold a
woman against her will. I never do. Not worth it. Poor sport. Let
her go."</p>

<p>The sounds from below told Horn that, in fact, she was as good
as gone already. For a moment he stood cursing de Mille.</p>

<p>Then abruptly he turned aside with a laugh that still held some
anger. "You were damned inopportune, Mille. But perhaps it's no
matter. She has yet to conquer her coyness. That will keep for
another occasion."</p>

<p>But Catherine, huddled shuddering and panting in the depths of
her hired coach, was crying aloud, "Oh, vile! Vile!" and vowing
that no other occasion should there ever be.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15 -- THE ROYAL BANK</h2>

<p>Amazing as must ever be the public history of the Laird of
Lauriston, it becomes yet more amazing when we acquaint ourselves
with his secret history as it now develops.</p>

<p>By the winter of 1718 his operations had become of an incredible
scope and complexity; yet he elaborated and directed them with a
mind that must at times--as we have evidence--have been distracted
by the thought of Margaret Ogilvy. It has been suggested, and no
doubt with truth, that only by deep immersion in affairs could he
find surcease of the tormenting longings resulting from his brief
encounter with this woman who had been the lodestar of his early
years. His awareness that the Count of Horn had gone into
banishment and that his Countess remained alone in Paris, in itself
presented him with temptations which only by sweat of soul could he
subdue.</p>

<p>It also happened that the Regent's attachment to him--his
infatuation, as some describe it, for the Scot and all his
arts--should have been increased by the Parliament's intrigues and
the peril which had overhung him. Then, too, the subjugation of the
Parliament which had followed out of that affair had so
immeasurably strengthened the Regent's own position that he need no
longer hesitate to indulge the Scot in the prosecution of those
wider financial schemes of whose soundness Mr Law had been
labouring to persuade him. In order to make him quite safe by
placing him above such dangers in the future, his Bank, to the
profound disgust of Noailles and his friends, was by royal edict
raised into a State institution. Its title was changed from Banque
Générale to Banque Royale, and its notes were supported by the
King's guarantee.</p>

<p>And now, at last, Mr Law was enabled to widen his vast horizons
by a charter which joined to the Mississippi Company, and placed
similarly under his absolute control, those other French colonial
trading companies, the Compagnie des Indes Orientales, the Companie
de Chine and the Compagnie du Sénégal. This amalgamation was given
the title of the Compagnie des Indes, but was destined to continue
to be popularly known as the Compagnie du Mississippi.</p>

<p>For the operations of this imposing concern, which was to hold
the monopoly of the entire overseas trade of France, fresh and vast
capital would be required, and for its acquisition Mr Law employed
to the full those financial arts of which he had given such
abundant proof and which none dared now, as formerly, to
deride.</p>

<p>The upward move in value of the Mississippi stock was still only
gradual, and it had not yet reached par, despite the marvels still
related of the inexhaustible wealth of Louisiana.</p>

<p>If this state of things did not trouble Mr Law, who took long
views, it certainly troubled his more cautious brother. William Law
could foresee no early likelihood of improvement when he pondered
the poor accounts that secretly reached them from overseas, so
grimly in contrast with the glowing reports that were still being
circulated. He pointed to the stagnation of the Mississippi stock
when compared with the brisk movement of the stock of d'Argenson's
anti-system, which was earning for its shareholders dividends of
from twelve to fifteen per centum.</p>

<p>The elder Law derided his brother's timorousness. "Did you
suppose that a land that has been so criminally neglected could be
rendered immediately productive? The wealth is there. Perhaps not
in the gold and precious stones which were just a glittering lure
to dazzle dullards, but certainly in the actual land. You'll not
expect mere soil to attract minds that are just mud. But, depend
upon it, we'll soon be seeing it yield its riches.
Overwhelmingly."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said William, without conviction. "Faith, it's what
we'll be hoping. Meanwhile would it not have been better to wait at
least until the Mississippi stock is at par before burdening
ourselves with these other enterprises?"</p>

<p>"That stock will be at par when I so choose, which will be when
we launch this Compagnie des Indes."</p>

<p>"I'd like fine to see it," said William, and wagged a dubious
head.</p>

<p>"So you shall," his brother assured him, and went confidently to
work to make good the assurance.</p>

<p>For his purposes he invented that expedient which has since come
to be known as the option, and announced that before the end of the
year the Royal Bank would take up the Mississippi stock at par. Two
hundred shares at this level represented one hundred thousand
livres, and this he undertook to pay for these two hundred, which
at the moment might be purchased in the Rue Quincampoix for sixty
thousand.</p>

<p>So as to render binding the engagement, he announced the deposit
at once with the Bank of forty thousand livres, which he must
forfeit if he failed to fulfil his pledge.</p>

<p>Since it was manifest that he could choose to do so only if
there were less loss in sacrificing the deposit, it was concluded
by a public gaping in astonishment that Monsieur Lass had the best
of reasons for knowing that the value of the stock was about to
rise. This alone sufficed to awaken a demand for it, which in
itself sufficed to send the price upwards.</p>

<p>The real appreciation, however, was not to come until Law played
his second and master card in this deep gamble. His issue in the
new and all-embracing Compagnie des Indes was of fifty thousand
shares with a par value of five hundred livres each, so as to make
up a capital of twenty-five millions.</p>

<p>He placed, however, a premium on the shares, so that they were
purchasable at five hundred and fifty livres in gold, thus
producing a total of twenty-seven and a half millions. Of this only
fifty livres were payable on application for each share, the
balance of five hundred to follow in twenty equal monthly
instalments, and the original fifty livres to be forfeited in the
event of failure to complete.</p>

<p>In this manner Law, taking inspiration from the gaming table,
attracted the gambler, who, by staking a comparatively trifling
amount on the chance of a rise in value, became the potential owner
of a block of securities representing a substantial sum.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Having invented this allurement, he now
imposed the further condition that shares in the new venture should
be available only to shareholders in the original Mississippi
Company, and that in order to acquire one of the new India
Company's shares, known as <i>daughters</i> it was necessary to
prove possession of four of the old, described as
<i>mothers</i>.</p>

<p>It followed that those who wished to subscribe to the India
Company were compelled first to procure themselves the necessary
Mississippi stock. From his knowledge of human nature, he conceived
that this obstacle would prove a whet, and he was justified by the
immediate sequel. The price of the old stock took at last a
vigorous upward movement, and soon the Rue Vivienne was blocked by
carriages and the Hôtel de Nevers besieged by persons of quality,
who came to beg of Mr Law the favour of allocation before the lists
should close.</p>

<p>A story ran that the Regent, requiring a lady-in-waiting to
accompany one of his daughters to the Court of Savoy, and
mentioning that he did not know where to find a duchess for the
purpose, was answered that he would find all the duchesses he could
want in Mr Law's anteroom, and there might take his choice.</p>

<p>At the same time the Rue Quincampoix was resounding from dawn to
dusk with the cries of less illustrious buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>Gathering momentum in its rise under this fierce demand, the
price of the stock went soaring beyond par. The more it soared the
more eager were the buyers, and soon the price stood at seven
hundred and fifty livres, representing an appreciation of
fifty-five per centum on the face value.</p>

<p>The effect was enormously to enhance the already solidly
established credit of Mr Law. It was seen that he had made good all
his assertions concerning the Mississippi Company, just as he had
earlier triumphed over the mistrust and ridicule with which his
Bank had been assailed.</p>

<p>William Law was robbed of breath as he contemplated the reckless
ease with which his brother's genius extracted millions from
nothing more than faith in what he might achieve with them. Again
he would have had his brother rest content and apply himself
exclusively to the development of the stupendous enterprise for
which all these millions had been assembled.</p>

<p>But that supreme gamester aimed at the control of a far wider
field, every stage in the conquest of which he was carefully
plotting whilst waiting to be served by opportunity.</p>

<p>It was not long delayed. It came, as he counted that it would,
when the spendthrift Regent stood again in need of money.
Settlements were sought by his bastard, the Chevalier d'Orléans,
there was an estate required by Madame de Parabère, and Jouflotte
was clamouring for money to maintain her more than royal
splendours. His amiable Highness, who had never aquired the art of
refusing, turned to Monsieur Lass as the natural provider. Monsieur
Lass was ready to oblige. His Highness might have fifty millions
when he pleased. All that Mr Law would require in exchange would be
an assignment to the Company of the administration of the mint, and
the faculty of minting.</p>

<p>His Highness did not hesitate. He granted the assignment for a
term of nine years, in ever-mounting esteem of this alchemist who
conjured millions out of air. At least, that is what his brother
now asked him was he prepared to do in order to pay for the
concession. "For the Mississippi Company, let me tell you, John,
cannot spare fifty millions for such a purpose."</p>

<p>As usual, Mr Law smiled upon his brother's qualms. "It was never
in my reckoning that it should. The public will provide the money
as readily as before."</p>

<p>And readily the infatuated public did provide it when for his
purposes Mr Law made a fresh issue of shares in the India
Company--this time to be styled the <i>granddaughters</i>--of the
nominal value of five hundred livres but at a premium of no less
than five hundred.</p>

<p>He was emboldened to this daring step by the rapid absorption of
his previous issue, and this time in order to acquire the new
shares he made it necessary to hold four <i>mothers</i> and one
<i>daughter</i>, whilst the lists were open for only twenty days.
The further attraction of a promise of a dividend of twelve per
centum, caused the stock to be avidly subscribed.</p>

<p>The acquisition of the mint was no more than a subtle
preliminary to the destruction of d'Argenson's anti-system and the
absorption of its privileges. This, however, must wait until the
public should have digested the heavy meal which Mr Law had just
served up.</p>

<p>In the meantime he quietly added to his other undertakings the
monopolies of salt and tobacco, and he obtained an edict forbidding
remittances from one part of France to another to be made in
specie, enforcing the use of banknotes for the purpose.</p>

<p>It was an edict that must have proved highly dangerous to any
who enjoyed a credit less absolute than his had now become.
Actually it was covered by the specious pretext of making for
greater security, and so as to render this manifest Mr Law added to
his other financial inventions that of the endorsement, by which a
banknote could be made payable only to the person named on it.</p>

<p>It followed from this and similar measures that now, three years
after the inception of his activities, virtually all the coin of
the realm, amounting to some seven or eight hundred millions, had
passed into the vaults of the Royal Bank, whilst its colossal paper
issue carried the country's commerce.</p>

<p>At the turn of the year the Rue Quincampoix became a humming
hive of activity, from dawn to dusk, and every little
money-changer's office there functioned as a succursal of Mr Law's
Temple of Mammon, dealing with the overflow from the Royal Bank of
the ever-increasing numbers who were eager to buy or sell.</p>

<p>Trade, which apprehension and lack of confidence in the
financial policy of the government had rendered stagnant, was
flowing freely once more, employment was being found for the idle
hands of starvelings, and the wages of the poorest labour had
already doubled.</p>

<p>If the dawn of prosperity was as yet no more than breaking, it
already sufficed, after all the misery endured, to cause the nation
to hail Monsieur Lass as its saviour and to pour blessings upon his
name.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16 -- RE-ENTER DON
PABLO</h2>

<p>Mr Law sat making calculations upon a large sheet that was
already black with figures, besides three thumbnail sketches of a
woman's head that might have been recognized by those who knew her
well as that of the Countess of Horn.</p>

<p>To him thus absorbed was announced the Earl of Stair.</p>

<p>His lordship in sky-blue, with stockings rolled above the knee,
may not have been easy on the eye but he certainly commanded it. He
sauntered in swinging a cane, doffed his tricorne, made a leg, and
professed himself Mr Law's obedient servant.</p>

<p>"I protest, sir, that if you continue to rise at your present
rate you will soon be beyond the reach of us lesser mortals."</p>

<p>"Your lordship rallies me. Pray tell me how to serve you."</p>

<p>"I thank you. I should not dare. I find you housed like a
prince."</p>

<p>"Say like a cardinal. This house was once Mazarin's."</p>

<p>"Is not a cardinal a sort of prince, and one who knows how to
live and how to build? There is no such noble staircase as yours
either at Kensington or St James's, and the tapestries with which
you adorn it would be worth a king's ransom. But then a million to
you is as a guinea to me. Permit me to envy you."</p>

<p>"Why not? It's a form of flattery. Were you seeking a million or
so?"</p>

<p>The question, coldly asked, shattered the earl's air of banter.
"Could you tell me where to find one?"</p>

<p>"At need, if that were the object of your visit, as it is in
these days the object of most of my distinguished visitors: the
<i>auri sacra fames</i>. However, it were to do your lordship
injustice not to suppose that you will have a nobler purpose. Will
you not sit?"</p>

<p>"In effect," said his lordship. He hung his cane on a button,
drew forth his snuffbox, tapped it, proffered it, and thereafter
found himself a chair and crossed his elegant legs. "In your wide
fields of financial acquaintances do you number, I wonder, a
Spaniard named Pablo Alvarez?"</p>

<p>"Pablo Alvarez?" Veiling his surprise, Mr Law paused a moment
before answering. "I know him. Yes. I believe he is in London at
present."</p>

<p>Stair shook his head. "For once you are at fault. He was, but he
has decamped. He is bankrupt and charged with frauds in connection
with the South Sea Company. London wants him."</p>

<p>"For what purpose?"</p>

<p>"Why, to hang him, I presume. He has been traced through Holland
to France. No doubt he will be seeking to reach Spain, where he
could account himself safe. But the present difficult relations
between France and Spain, will prevent him from crossing the
frontier without a passport. That is something with which he may
not have reckoned. I have just seen the Regent, to beg that this
man, if he presents himself, should not only be refused a passport,
but be arrested and handed over to us. His Highness proved
difficult. He would give me no undertaking." He sighed. "I fear
that for all my efforts I have never succeeded in winning his
affection. That is why I now come to you."</p>

<p>"To me! Your lordship jests. Can I do what the Regent
won't?"</p>

<p>"You might guide the Regent's mind. You certainly possess the
secret of it. It is common gossip that who would obtain anything
from His Highness should ask it of Monsieur le Baron Lass. Which is
as it should be." Stair smiled. "The man who holds the purse should
call the piper's tune."</p>

<p>"All that's but blether," said the Laird of Lauriston.</p>

<p>"Ay. Maybe. The question is will you move His Highness to oblige
us."</p>

<p>Mr Law, his face expressionless, again took a moment to
consider. "As you please. I'll see what I can do. But understand
that I promise no result. I shall use my own judgment
entirely."</p>

<p>"With that I must be content, I suppose. My gratitude may not be
much to you, but, such as it is, I hope you will condescend to earn
it by this service." He rose to go.</p>

<p>"The million you were asking for would be more easily
provided."</p>

<p>Lord Stair looked at him with narrowing eyes, hesitating. "And,
for that matter, far more welcome, I can assure you." He paused
before adding with a laugh that betrayed embarrassment: "I suppose
you could not tell me where to find it."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Mr Law spoke carelessly, as one to whom the bestowal
of millions was negligible. It amused him perhaps to beat down the
arrogance of station with the arrogance of wealth. "Why not? Buy a
thousand shares in the India Company."</p>

<p>"But they are a thousand livres apiece. My dear Law! That would
cost me a million."</p>

<p>"It need cost you little more than a thousand louis. For all you
need deposit is fifty livres for each share as a first instalment.
Before the second instalment falls due the stock will at least have
doubled in value. You can then sell enough to provide the second
payment, and before the third is due you will have made your
million or more. I'll waive in your case the qualifying shares, and
instruct my man McWhirter accordingly. You'll find him at the Bank
in Rue Quincampoix."</p>

<p>Stair's hooded eyes had become very prominent. "And if your
prognostications do not come true?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You may lose your thousand louis. But you can depend upon my
word."</p>

<p>"It's a gamble, of course."</p>

<p>"Hardly. A gamble implies a risk, and there's none here. But
maybe you're over-virtuous to gamble even when there is no
risk."</p>

<p>His impecunious lordship stroked his long chin, reflecting.
Slowly he asked: "Where do you say I'll find this India Company
stock?"</p>

<p>"At the office of the Bank, in the Rue Quincampoix. Ask for
Angus McWhirter, a brother Scot, who's my man of confidence. I'll
give you a note to him."</p>

<p>Lord Stair stepped down completely from the chilly heights of
pride, on which he habitually dwelt. For once he was rendered
almost effusive. When presently he took his leave, he did so
warmly, professing himself Mr Law's profound debtor and with a last
recommendation in the matter of the Spanish bankrupt.</p>

<p>Although he had betrayed no sign of it, it was distressing to Mr
Law to learn of the troubles of his old friend Alvarez, and it was
still on his mind when, two days later, and just as he was about to
go to dinner, his brother surprised him by ushering into his room
the very man who had supplied the motive for Lord Stair's
visit.</p>

<p>Don Pablo Alvarez, a trifle more corpulent than when last seen,
four years ago, in Turin, his sallow face more deeply lined,
advanced upon Mr Law with open arms trumpeting his gladness to see
him again, and swearing that as he was passing through Paris he
could not forgo the joy of coming to embrace him.</p>

<p>It was not a joy that at the moment Mr Law could share. He
suffered the embrace with fortitude. "I wish I could return the
compliment," he said. "But then, my dear Pablo, I happen to know
the trouble that accounts for your presence."</p>

<p>"Trouble! Ay, and what trouble! <i>Dios mio</i>, what trouble,
my friend!" His black eyes were wistful as a hound's. "But will you
tell me how the devil you come to know of it already?"</p>

<p>"From the British ambassador. He has asked me to persuade the
Regent to have you arrested and sent back to London should you
happen to be found in France."</p>

<p>The Spaniard stood a moment speechless in dismayed amazement.
Then he exploded. "Mother of God! Will they go to such lengths as
that?"</p>

<p>"Reassure yourself," said Mr Law. "I have no intention of
obliging my Lord Stair."</p>

<p>Alvarez resumed a breathing momentarily suspended. "<i>Valgame
Dios</i>! I should have known that. For an instant I felt the rope
round my neck." He eased his cravat as he spoke.</p>

<p>Mr Law thrust him into a chair, soothed him with assurances of
friendship and assistance, and asked for an account of his
troubles. Volubly, the Spaniard related how he had been caught and
ruined over South Sea stock. He had accounted it crazily
overpriced, and had sold what he didn't possess, convinced that a
fall was inevitable and must enable him to cover his transactions.
But instead of falling, as any but a fool would have expected, the
cursed worthless stock had risen further. He ended by swearing that
if anything was certain in this world it was that the South Sea
stock was a bubble that would very soon be pricked.</p>

<p>"But not soon enough for you," said William, "and meanwhile it's
yourself is the bubble that's been burst."</p>

<p>"And so you bolted," said Mr Law. "Well, well, if we can't be
honest we should at least be prudent."</p>

<p>"D'ye call me dishonest?" Don Pablo was almost lachrymose.</p>

<p>"Don't you? Or is it honest to sell what you don't possess, and
then decamp with the money?"</p>

<p>"What money? I take God to witness I had none of their money. It
is they who were clamouring for mine, since I couldn't deliver the
stock. And now, it seems, they're yelling for my blood as if that
will reimburse them."</p>

<p>"A preposterous world."</p>

<p>Don Pablo took him seriously. "It's not for you to find fault
with it, you that had the wisdom to come to Paris. Would to Heaven
I had come with you when you urged it. The greatest man in France
today after the Regent, controlling its finances, dispensing
millions, courted by princes, housed here like a king. Ay, ay! Who
wouldn't envy you?"</p>

<p>"Let us rather talk of yourself, Pablo. You'll be on your way to
Spain. But things are not easy between France and Spain at the
moment. You'll need a passport if you're to cross the
Pyrénées."</p>

<p>"Cellamare is providing."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The Prince of Cellamare. Naturally it was to him I went for
help on arrival here. He is arranging for me to travel as a valet
to a young Spanish priest who is returning to Madrid."</p>

<p>"I see. And when does this priest of Cellamare's set out?"</p>

<p>"In a day or two as soon as he returns to Paris. He's away at
Sceaux at present."</p>

<p>"At Sceaux!" Mr Law's expression became suddenly alert. "At
Sceaux, eh? Do you happen to know what a Spanish priest should be
doing in that carnival-haunt?"</p>

<p>Don Pablo shrugged. "How should I? Cellamare didn't mention it.
All he told me was that this abbé--Porto-Carrero is his
name--arrived from Madrid a couple of days ago and will be
returning at once."</p>

<p>"So! He arrived from Madrid a couple of days ago and will be
returning at once, and in the meanwhile he spends his time--his
couple of days--at Sceaux." Don Pablo was puzzled by Mr Law's
apparent amusement. "I thought it singular that your proud, almost
unapproachable, grandee of Spain should be concerned to help an
absconding bankrupt. But now things begin to open out. Your abbé
begins to look like a messenger--a messenger between Spain and
Sceaux. Is not that odd?"</p>

<p>"But the man's a priest."</p>

<p>"That is what is odd. If he were not a priest the case would be
less curious. And this messenger is not only a priest but a man of
birth. Porto-Carrero is no common name. Now, why should such a man
be running messages? Don't you guess the answer?"</p>

<p>"Whatever do you mean? What answer is to be guessed?"</p>

<p>"That these are not messages to be entrusted to a common
courier."</p>

<p>"Surely that's just an assumption," William interjected.</p>

<p>"To be sure it is. But there's no lack of ground for it when you
know what goes on at Sceaux. They plot there; they dabble gaily in
high-treason; the little Duchess has said that she wants to set the
kingdom ablaze under the feet of the Duke of Orléans. In the
intervals of their madrigals and serenades and play-acting and a
deal of harlotry, they conspire to overthrow the Regent and bring
in the King of Spain."</p>

<p>"My God!" Don Pablo gasped. "But if it's known..."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's known. But the Regent laughs at their plotting,
accounts it so much <i>cabotinage</i>, shrugs his shoulders at the
scurrilous verses her Grace's hireling poetasters write to defame
him. He may have been right, so long as all the plotting was just
so much buffoonery, but what you now tell me suggests that Spain is
actually responsive. It becomes serious. Perhaps Alberoni sees his
profit in advancing the plans of the Maines. I don't think the
Regent would laugh at that."</p>

<p>"Man!" ejaculated William. "That's just what he'll be doing if
you carry that tale to him. Its foundations are over-slight. Ye'll
need some proof before ye bring so heavy a charge."</p>

<p>Upon reflection Mr Law was to agree with this. "We must provide
it," he said. "Where are you lodged, Pablo?"</p>

<p>"At the Spanish embassy. The Prince of Cellamare has offered me
the hospitality of his house until Porto-Carrero is ready to
leave."</p>

<p>Mr Law looked at his brother. "That alone should convince you.
Or do you think it natural in the haughty Cellamare to take
absconding financiers to his bosom? As for you, Pablo, you shall go
back to the embassy in my carriage, and my advice to you is to lie
close until you leave. If you should come to see me again take your
precautions. And now let us go to dinner."</p>

<p>Don Pablo did come again, in the dusk of the following evening.
Obedient to Mr Law's injunction he came secretly in a closed sedan
chair. His compelling purpose was that he needed money, although he
wrapped this up in the desire to take his leave of his old friend.
He reported that the Abbé de Porto-Carrero had returned that
morning to the embassy from Sceaux and would be setting out for
Madrid early on the morrow together with a Spanish gentleman named
Monteléon, who had arrived from the Hague.</p>

<p>Mr Law supplied his financial needs with that princely
liberality and contempt for money in which it was his way to deal,
and desired him a safe journey into Spain.</p>

<p>"You are assured, I hope," he said, "that you are safely covered
by inclusion as a servant in your abbé's passport."</p>

<p>"Oh, entirely. As the Abbé de Porto-Carrero's valet I share his
diplomatic immunity; for he will be carrying embassy
dispatches."</p>

<p>To Mr Law this was the last link in his chain of assumptions.
There was about him for a moment the stillness of deep thought
following upon sudden revelation. "Embassy despatches, eh?" he said
at last, his eyes intent. "Then I was hardly wrong in guessing him
a messenger."</p>

<p>"And hardly right," laughed Don Pablo. "For he is certainly not
the kind of messenger you imagined."</p>

<p>To this there was no reply. But after the Spaniard, effusively
grateful, had departed, Mr Law called for his carriage, and went
off to the Palais Royal and Dubois, demanding that he be procured
an instant audience with the Regent.</p>

<p>The little Abbé laughed at him. "Not if Paris were blazing,"
said he. "His Highness has gone to supper, and the door is locked
for the night."</p>

<p>"It must be unlocked," Mr Law insisted, and he went on briefly
to tell Dubois what, according to his deductions, was afoot. "Let
these men set out by all means," he ended. "But they should
instantly be followed and arrested."</p>

<p>Dubois was now well on the way to the fulfilment of his ambition
to become a second Richelieu. Therefore this matter should concern
him closely. Nevertheless, he laughed more freely than ever.
"Arrested! Arrest two gentlemen, both of them men of quality, upon
no more than these vague suspicions of yours?"</p>

<p>"My suspicions may be suspicions, but they are not vague. Where
is your common sense? You say they are persons of quality. Since
when has an ambassador--even a Spanish ambassador--used persons of
quality for his couriers?"</p>

<p>The Abbé shrugged. "Come, come, my friend. These gentlemen are
going to Spain. It does not seem to me remarkable that they should
oblige Cellamare by carrying his letters."</p>

<p>"But don't you see that they are letters which this
Porto-Carrero appears to have come to France especially to fetch?
Probably in answer to letters that he brought. Don't all the
circumstances point to that? All the way from Madrid to spend four
days in France and three of them at Sceaux, which is bubbling at
present with treason. You have your spies, Abbé, and so have I. It
happens that there is a vindictive young gentleman named Horn at
Sceaux in whose movements I take an interest, and I know what I am
saying of their occupation there in these days."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes." Dubois was becoming impatient. "I know all that and
more. And so does the Regent. Let us say that all your assumptions
are correct. What is certain is that the Regent would never
sanction any action upon them; nor do I see what action we could
take."</p>

<p>"I have told you. Seize the person of this young priest, and get
his papers."</p>

<p>"My dear Baron!" Dubois was scandalized. "You can't realize what
you are saying. Papers under the ambassadorial seal are
inviolate--sacred. Wars have been fought for less than the offence
you propose. And, anyway, why so hot? If His Highness chooses to
laugh at these plots, why need you trouble about them."</p>

<p>Mr Law strove with his impatience. "My dear Abbé, you do less
than justice to your repute for shrewdness. As long as the plotting
is merely at Sceaux--the windy histrionics of a silly duchess--you
and I could laugh with the Regent. But haven't we something more? A
messenger has come from Madrid. The Spanish ambassador is in the
business. Doesn't this mean that King Philip begins to take the
matter seriously? And you want to know why I'm so hot. If whilst
the Regent laughs they cut the ground from under his feet, what
would happen to me? My friends of the Parliament nearly hanged me
once. And, for that matter, what would happen to you, Abbé? Do the
Maines and their friends love you so much that you would feel safe
if the Regent were overthrown?"</p>

<p>"It's all a surmise," Dubois insisted, but more thoughtfully.
"And I certainly dare not take such extreme and dangerous action on
no better grounds. To seize embassy papers..."</p>

<p>"But if they contain evidence of treason?"</p>

<p>"We can't prove that until we possess them, and we dare not
possess them until we have proved it. Amusing, perhaps. But it's a
deadlock, and I certainly dare not break it."</p>

<p>"Is that your last word?"</p>

<p>"More, my friend. It's an epilogue."</p>

<p>"Then I must do as I can."</p>

<p>Dubois was alarmed. "What the devil's in your mind?"</p>

<p>"That I must do it for you."</p>

<p>"Are you quite mad?" Dubois had changed colour. "You may be a
daring gamester, Baron. But this is a gamble that should daunt even
you. You will be staking your head on it."</p>

<p>"Oh! My head!"</p>

<p>"At least your career. It would ruin you. For God's sake take
thought, man. Leave matters that don't concern you."</p>

<p>"I've endeavoured to show you that they do concern me."</p>

<p>"But not to the extent of running into this danger. I beg you to
be warned, my friend."</p>

<p>"Very well." Mr Law became abrupt. "We'll say no more. And now,
another matter. Lord Stair called on me a few days ago..."</p>

<p>"About a defaulting bankrupt? I know. He told me that he had
sought your aid. What is your interest in that?"</p>

<p>"The bankrupt is an old friend of mine, and I should like to
oblige him. There is a document I require from you concerning
him."</p>

<p>When he had stated it the Abbé was bewildered. "You become more
mysterious than ever. Do you wish to assist Stair, or don't you?
Devil take me if I understand you."</p>

<p>"You will eventually. Meanwhile oblige me as I ask. You see that
it can do no harm. France has no interest in this man."</p>

<p>Because this, at least, was clear, the Abbé made no further
difficulty. But he remained profoundly puzzled and even vaguely
alarmed when Mr Law had left him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter 17 -- CELLAMARE'S
SATCHEL</h2>

<p>Don Pablo's journey was proving by no means a happy one.</p>

<p>As much the aristocratic young abbé as his companion, who was
the son of the last Spanish ambassador to the Court of St James's,
treated the banker with even less courtesy than they would have
shown him had he, indeed, been the lackey he pretended to be. Thus
the pretence became more than a reality. He rode outside the coach,
beside the driver, as tight-wrapped as he could contrive against
the cutting December winds, cursing the supercilious young men so
snug inside a coach that was nearly of the size of a room.</p>

<p>His only comfort was in the thought that he was now well on his
way to the Spanish frontier and safety. This, at least, until
Poitiers was reached. Here, as the coach was lumbering over the
bridge that crossed the Clain, he became aware that a small troop
was coming briskly up behind them. In this there was nothing to
disturb an ordinary man in ordinary circumstances. But Don Pablo's
circumstances were made extraordinary by his unquiet
conscience.</p>

<p>Kneeling on the box seat of the coach, he peered back over its
roof at the approaching troop: a half-dozen, red-coated musketeers
led by an officer and with a well-mounted, cloaked civilian riding
in the rear.</p>

<p>Spurring forward, they swarmed about the coach as it came to the
open ground beyond the bridge, and a command to halt in the King's
name converted Don Pablo's mounting fears into grim certainty.</p>

<p>The vehicle rocked to a standstill, and the sharp-faced young
priest thrust out his head to demand a reason for this
interference, assuming it to be an error, and announcing himself as
the Abbé de Porto-Carrero of the Spanish embassy, on his way to
Spain.</p>

<p>The officer could not have been more courteous. If that were
really the case he would beg Monsieur l'Abbé to forgive this
momentary interruption of his journey. They were in pursuit, on
behalf of the British authorities, of an absconding bankrupt named
Pablo Alvarez, and their information led them to believe that he
travelled in this coach.</p>

<p>The Abbé simulated indignation, and in his nervousness lost his
wits to the extent of denying knowledge of any such person. He was
accompanied only by Monsieur de Monteléon and a valet, as their
papers showed.</p>

<p>The officer dismounted, and one of his troopers opened the door
of the coach. Beyond the little ring of horsemen some idlers of the
town, their numbers increasing, stood agape.</p>

<p>The Abbé proffered his papers. He was a short, dark complexioned
young man of peremptory manner. His companion, lean and lanky by
contrast, remained silent and of a disarming languor.</p>

<p>The officer scanned the two documents he had been handed. "All
in order," he said, but he still retained them whilst speaking to
the civilian rider, who had edged his horse forward, so that he was
at the other's shoulder. "Take a look at them, monsieur. Do you
recognize either as your man?"</p>

<p>The civilian leaned from the saddle to inspect each in turn.
"No," he announced. "You may allow them to proceed,
lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Porto-Carrero, and held out his hand for the
papers.</p>

<p>"There is a servant mentioned here," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Naturally." His reverence was supercilious. "I should not
travel without one." A careless hand indicated him. "He is there,
on the box."</p>

<p>"Permit me to take a closer look at him. Oblige me by climbing
down, my good fellow."</p>

<p>Alvarez came to ground quaking to hear the civilian, speaking
incredibly with the voice of Mr Law. "It is your man, lieutenant.
This is Pablo Alvarez."</p>

<p>"<i>Voilà</i>!" The officer laughed. "The ruse had almost
succeeded, Monsieur l'Abbé." With sarcasm he added: "I suppose he,
too, will be a member of the embassy."</p>

<p>Porto-Carrero became violent. "I know nothing of him. I hired
him in Paris a week ago."</p>

<p>"To be sure. To be sure. Get back to the box, my man. You'll all
come along with us."</p>

<p>He slammed the door of the coach upon the still voluble and
excited Abbé, and gave brisk orders. They went forward, and made
for the Auberge Poitevin, Don Pablo accounting himself lost and
understanding nothing of his monstrous betrayal by Mr Law.</p>

<p>In the inn yard, under the staring eyes of landlord and
chamberlain, ostler and drawers, with maidservants hanging out of
windows and idlers forming a background, the travellers were
invited to alight and to consider themselves under arrest.</p>

<p>Porto-Carrero, now grown abusive, was threatening France with
all but a Spanish war to avenge this outrage, whilst the tall
civilian quietly ordered the luggage from the boot to be brought
indoors where it might be examined.</p>

<p>"It will cost you dear, I warn you," screamed the Abbé, beside
himself. "Our passports prove us of the embassy, and our persons
and baggage are sacred."</p>

<p>But Mr Law's exasperating calm was not disturbed. "The only one
of you known to us is a defaulting bankrupt escaping to Spain.
You'll not find it odd that we must discredit your assertions
notwithstanding your passports. Passports may be counterfeited. You
will be so good as to let me have that satchel, Monsieur l'Abbé?"
He held out his hand for the leather case which Porto-Carrero's arm
was hugging to his side.</p>

<p>The ghastliness of the Abbé's face and the froth bubbling at the
corners of his mouth as witnesses to his panic must have assured Mr
Law that all his assumptions were justified. "This, sir, contains
embassy despatches. It bears the arms of the Spanish embassy and
the embassy's seals. Look for yourself, sir."</p>

<p>"That is my intention." Mr Law possessed himself of the satchel.
"There could be no more convenient receptacle for a defaulter's
plunder. In these days of banknotes a million could be carried
between these covers."</p>

<p>Monteléon put off his languor to intervene. He was very haughty.
"You are surely out of your senses, sir. Because a rascal has
imposed himself upon us so as to travel with us, gives you no
reason for this violence. I warn you, sir, that you interfere with
these despatches at your peril. Your grave peril. We will return to
Paris with you, and the Prince of Cellamare shall answer for us.
That surely will satisfy you. You cannot be so ignorant as not to
know that if you refuse and break those seals the consequences will
be very serious for you."</p>

<p>All this oratory, however, seemed wasted upon that obtuse
civilian.</p>

<p>"Whether we are to disturb the Spanish ambassador on your
behalf, and whether you return to Paris with us will depend upon
what I find in this satchel."</p>

<p>In his own room in the inn, with the two still protesting young
men and their pretended servant in attendance under guard, Mr Law,
with scant respect for the arms of Spain which they bore, broke
both seals and lock and emptied the contents of the embassy satchel
on the table at which he sat.</p>

<p>It was, he realized, the boldest gambling throw he had ever
made, and if his deductions were wrong and these papers innocent of
treason, the consequences would be as grave as Dubois had warned
him.</p>

<p>But his deductions were not wrong, and the appalling evidence in
his hands by far exceeded his every expectation. As he glanced
through those documents and verified their nature, the two young
men, the Abbé in black, Monteléon in mulberry velvet, no longer
protested. They stood before him, stricken and silent as a couple
of detected thieves.</p>

<p>At last he looked up, as stern of eye as of tone. "Lieutenant,
you will remove these three men, and lock them up for the night in
separate rooms, so that they remain, as they would say,
<i>incommunicado</i>. I'll take order about them in the
morning."</p>

<p>There was a word of command, and realizing that further protests
would now be unavailing, the Abbé and his companion went out,
hangdog, between their guards.</p>

<p>Alone, Mr Law gave closer attention to the material spread
before him.</p>

<p>First there was a note from the Prince of Cellamare to Cardinal
Alberoni, detailing the enclosures which His Eminence was requested
to bring to the notice of King Philip. It began with the sentence,
"<i>I have waited until the vines were ripe before attempting the
vintage</i>, <i>and ripe I think Your Eminence will now account
them</i>." It went on to outline the plan of campaign to be
conducted by King Philip's uncle, the Duke of Maine. The Regent
would be abducted by sure men, an easy matter, considering his
careless, unguarded habits. Of what should be done with him when
abducted there was no mention. It was a detail to be left, no
doubt, to the discretion of the King of Spain. Immediately
thereafter His Majesty should enter France, and he would be
assisted by the regiment of the Duke of Richelieu, which was in
garrison at Bayonne. They could count upon the support of the
Parliament of Paris and of the nobility of Brittany, the hereditary
foes of England, a kingdom which it was the Regent's evil policy to
ally with France. King Philip would then be proclaimed Regent, to
which office, as the grandson of Louis XIV, he had the paramount
right, and he would be represented by the Duke of Maine, who as
King Philip's Lieutenant would discharge the functions of the
regency.</p>

<p>If this had been all, it would have been enough. But there was
much more. Incredibly there was the draft of a letter which King
Philip was invited to address to the infant Louis XV, in the
following terms:</p>

<p>MY BROTHER AND NEPHEW--Never since Providence placed me on the
throne of Spain have I lost sight of the obligations of my birth.
Louis XIV of eternal memory is always before my mind. I seem always
to hear that great prince saying to me at the moment of our
separation, 'The Pyrenees exist no longer'.</p>

<p>Your Majesty is the only descendant of my elder brother. My dear
Spaniards, who love me tenderly and are assured of the love I have
for them, are not jealous of the sentiments I evince for you. I
flatter myself that my personal interests are still dear to a
nation at whose breast I was nourished. How, then, can your
faithful subjects regard the treaty that is being signed against
me, or, rather, against yourself? Ever since your exhausted
finances have been unequal to bearing the current expenses of
peace, it has been sought to ally Your Majesty with England, my
most mortal enemy, so as to make war upon me. To those conditions I
shall never subscribe. They are unbearable to me.</p>

<p>Mr Law was not impressed by the epistolary manner which the
poetasters of Sceaux sought to impose upon His Majesty of
Spain.</p>

<p>He turned to a list, in the same hand as that letter, of the
influential nobles upon whose support King Philip might
confidentially count. In addition, several others, not named in the
list, among whom the Duke of Aumont, the Duke of Polignac, the Duke
of Richelieu, the Marquis of Pompadour, and the Count of Horn, had
each written in his own hand a letter offering loyalty and service
to the King of Spain.</p>

<p>Here, thought Mr Law, was abundant matter to check the Regent's
amusement at the conspiracies of Sceaux, matter that might well
bring a dozen fine heads to the block, among which would be that of
his own bitterest enemy. It was also matter that would make him
safe from those dread consequences of violating the sacredness of
ambassadorial seals which Dubois had so deeply feared.</p>

<p>Well content, he locked all away, and called for supper. Later,
towards midnight, with a cloak over his arm, informed of where Don
Pablo had been bestowed, he went to pay him a visit.</p>

<p>He dismissed the man on guard before the Spaniard's door. "Go
take your ease. I may be some time with this prisoner. I will send
for you again when I have done."</p>

<p>He unlocked the door, and went in. The room was lighted by two
candles flanking the remains of a meal and a jug of wine. Don
Pablo, seated dejectedly on the edge of the bed, his head in his
hands, and possibly a vision of the gallows at Tyburn before his
eyes, looked up out of a yellow face. Recognizing his tall visitor,
he flung an angry oath at him, and started up.</p>

<p>"You amuse yourself with me, <i>por Dios</i>!"</p>

<p>"And I hope that I shall amuse you also," said Mr Law. "To begin
with, here is a passport for you, and here a cloak with a hood, in
which to wrap yourself. I've removed the sentry, so as to leave you
free to remove yourself. If you go by the back staircase you are
not likely to meet anyone, for the household is abed. It will not
matter very much if you are seen; but it will save me trouble if
you are not. The post house is in the next street. Knock up the
postmaster, get yourself a horse, and ride for Spain as if the
devil were after you. If you deal generously with the postmaster
he'll not trouble you with questions. And I've brought you another
thousand louis in good notes of the Royal Bank.</p>

<p>"Don't stay to thank me, for it is I who am obliged to you. Your
default and bankruptcy have done me a great service.</p>

<p>"I said I hoped to amuse you, but you had better wait to laugh
until you are over the frontier. Good night, a good journey, and
better fortune, my dear Pablo. Go with God."</p>

<p>"Oh, my friend!" Don Pablo stood shaking before him. "And I
thought, God forgive me, that you had betrayed me. Oh, my friend,
my friend!" He choked on the words, and suddenly burst into
tears.</p>

<p>"<i>Que verguenza</i>!" Mr Law reproved him. "Oh, shameful! Is
this how you laugh? Steady, man! It's not a time for blubbering, or
for lingering. Come, my friend. Blow your nose, and be off."</p>

<p>Don Pablo seized Mr Law's hand, wrung it, kissed it, and
drenched it in tears. "God reward you! My saviour!"</p>

<p>Mr Law took him by the shoulders, and thrust him towards the
door. "The tale will be that you escaped in the dead of night by
the window. And so fare you well, my Pablo, until your next
bankruptcy."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter 18 -- THE LETTER</h2>

<p>Three days later, Mr Law was back in Paris with his two
captives, seeking the Abbé Dubois at the Palais Royal.</p>

<p>It was two o'clock on a cold, winter morning when he arrived
there, and the Abbé was already abed. Mr Law, however, insisted
upon his being awakened, and whilst rearing his night-capped head,
and hissing and growling like an angry cat, yet Dubois consented to
receive this untimely visitor.</p>

<p>"Devil take you, Baron, couldn't your business wait until
morning?"</p>

<p>"You shall be the judge of that," was the cool reply by a man in
whom the Abbé discerned a certain jauntiness oddly at variance with
his habitual impassivity.</p>

<p>Mr Law set down his large sable muff, and from under his
fur-lined pelisse produced a black leather satchel bearing a coat
of arms in gold and two broken seals.</p>

<p>At the sight of this Dubois' face lengthened and his eyes
dilated. In his excitement he tore off his nightcap. "My God, what
have you done?" he croaked. "Have you dared, after all, and despite
my warnings?"</p>

<p>"Here," said Mr Law, "is the answer." He poured the contents of
the satchel on to the bed. "But for me all would have gone snugly
to Madrid under the embassy seals. Instead, there you have the
lot."</p>

<p>It was not quite true, for Mr Law had abstracted, for ends of
his own, the Count of Horn's incriminating letter.</p>

<p>In an anxiety that left no breath for further questions, the
Abbé pounced with trembling hands upon the papers. As he read the
first of them he sucked in his hollow cheeks into which the colour
came slowly creeping. When he had read the last he looked up. His
pale eyes were glittering. He grinned. "<i>Pardieu</i>! You've been
lucky," he cried. "For you might have had to pay with a broken neck
for these broken seals."</p>

<p>"I am always charged with luck when I prevail by calculation.
Bah, my dear Abbé, I never gambled on a greater certainty, because
for once in my life I cogged the dice. You see, I did not go after
Monsieur de Porto-Carrero, but after an absconding bankrupt. I
overtook him at Poitiers, travelling as the servant of a Spanish
abbé. Of course I arrested him as well as his companion, the Abbé,
and another gentleman. And, of course, I went through their
luggage, solely in the hope of recovering some of the plunder.
Could I have done less? In such a case, dealing with detected
criminals, I could not be restrained by an embassy seal which might
have been counterfeited. And here you have what I providentially
discovered."</p>

<p>"So that's the tale, is it?"</p>

<p>"Unless your reverence can think of a better."</p>

<p>"Not I, faith! It will serve. It will serve admirably. Where art
your prisoners?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Porto-Carrero and his companion are in the cellar
of the Hôtel de Nevers, at your orders. As for the bankrupt, he
unfortunately escaped during the night."</p>

<p>"Ah! That would be the Spaniard for whom you had me supply a
passport. How vexatious that he should have slipped through your
fingers."</p>

<p>"Vexatious, of course. But he's no matter. He served his
purpose. Without him all this would never have been discovered. So
that we are in his debt. All we need remember is that he has proved
the agent of Providence."</p>

<p>Dubois thrust a bony leg from the bed, swathed himself in a bed
gown, and gathered up the papers. "Come to His Highness, Monsieur
Providence," he said.</p>

<p>But Mr Law shook his head. "Not I. You may have all the credit,
Abbé. I have no wish to appear in the role of policeman, and
there's no need to mention my name. You will allude to me simply as
your agent, which is what in effect I was. Monsieur l'Abbé!" He
made a leg, and went out.</p>

<p>An hour later, the Regent, rolling from supper, unbuttoned, and
with a deep flush on his face, discovered Dubois in his anteroom,
shivering in a bed gown, by the fire.</p>

<p>The Abbé was annoyed by the mirth his appearance provoked. "I am
not here to amuse Your Highness."</p>

<p>"It is on such occasions that you best achieve it." His Highness
hiccoughed. "And why the devil are you here?"</p>

<p>Dubois flourished the satchel. "To bring you a packet of
treason."</p>

<p>"At three o'clock in the morning? That's treason in itself. For
shame! There will never be a cardinal's hat for you by these crude
methods. Never. Go to bed."</p>

<p>"Will Your Highness be pleased to realize that I should not be
here at this hour if the matter were not of fearful urgency?"</p>

<p>But the Regent, who seldom knew how to be grave, certainly
carried too much wine for gravity now. "What is of fearfuller
urgency, is that I should get to bed. To the devil with you and
your treasons, Monsieur l'Abbé. Good night."</p>

<p>Laughing and bawling for his valet, the Duke staggered into his
bedchamber, leaving the Abbé scandalized and fuming at having
deprived himself of sleep merely to witness this levity.</p>

<p>His revenge came, however, on the following morning, when
closeted with the Regent in the room known as the Winter Cabinet,
at the end of the Little Gallery, he spread before him the
ambassadorial papers.</p>

<p>His Highness, freshly shaved, perfumed and powdered, brisk and
debonair, had turned from the fire by which he was standing to
greet the Abbé flippantly. Had his reverence, he asked, really been
so discourteous as to try to keep him from his bed last night or
had he merely dreamed it. But his manner changed when he had
glanced through Cellamare's letter. By the time the other exhibits
had been examined he was more serious than Dubois had ever known
him, a thundercloud darkened the fleshy, fresh-complexioned
face.</p>

<p>The rest of this Cellamare affair, whose discovery was so
signally to enhance Dubois' credit, both at home and abroad, is in
the history books. King Philip's ambassador, coming suavely to
request the return of his satchel, was placed under arrest that
same day; his papers were seized and closely examined by Dubois, as
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Le Blanc, the Secretary
of State for War, after which the Prince was escorted under guard
to the frontier. On the following morning a detachment of
musketeers was sent down to Sceaux to arrest the Duke and Duchess
of Maine, and a good deal of china was broken by the tempestuous
Duchess, who stood on her toes to increase her child-like height,
and screamed that she was a granddaughter of the great Condé, in
the vain hope of intimidating the officer who demanded her
surrender.</p>

<p>"You may arrest me," she declared, "but you will never subdue
me."</p>

<p>She was packed off--like Eve, as one chronicler has it, expelled
from her terrestrial Paradise--to Dijon, there to cool down and
think things over, and thence, a few months later, subdued or not,
to be pestering the Regent with letters in which, derisorily, she
protested loyalty.</p>

<p>Her feeble Duke, inveighing passionately against his wife for
having led him by the nose into this treasonable quagmire, was
locked up in the fortress of Donkers in Picardy.</p>

<p>As for the others, those betrayed by Cellamare's list and those
yet more signally betrayed by their own letters, they were, with
the exception of some who contrived to escape, rounded up and
lodged in the Bastille to await the Regent's pleasure.</p>

<p>The Count of Horn was not of these, because his letter to King
Philip remained in Mr Law's possession. Equipped with it, very late
at night, following upon the day that had seen the Regent unleash
the hounds of his justice, the Scot had himself conveyed in a sedan
chair borne by men in plain liveries and preceded by a
lantern-bearer to the house in the Rue d'Argenteuil that was
tenanted by the Countess of Horn. Perhaps in an excess of prudence
he announced himself to the porter as Monsieur du Jasmin, begging
to be received by the Countess despite the lateness of the
hour.</p>

<p>As he conceived, the name did not mystify her for more than an
instant. After all, it was an easy guess that "Monsieur du Jasmin"
must stand for "Jessamy John." Less easy was it to guess why he
should come seeking her. She was already abed, and there was a
moment of tremor and hesitation before she consented to rise and
receive him.</p>

<p>He was conducted by a footman, not to the salon, but to her
boudoir, a graciously intimate room as seen in the subdued
candlelight. Its rococo panels framed a brocade of a faded
rose-colour and it was furnished with a deal of chinoiserie, of
lacquered cabinets and choice porcelains. There was a clavichord in
satinwood and a tall harp beside it. An Indian carpet covered most
of the floor.</p>

<p>She came to him in a peignoir of white silk that clothed her
from neck to heel and lent height to her slim stature. Her russet
hair, piled high, was without cap or powder. There was surprise and
something akin to alarm in the dark eyes that intently considered
him as he made his bow. He was urbanely formal.</p>

<p>"You are gracious to receive me, madame. I trust that my errand
will justify the intrusion and excuse the hour of it. Had I not
been detained this evening by the Regent I would have come much
earlier."</p>

<p>Her questioning eyes continued to regard him in silence,
waiting, whilst he loosened his pelisse and let it hang open,
disclosing the richness of his dress, of stone-coloured velvet with
narrow gold lace.</p>

<p>She spoke at last, formal in her turn. "Put off your cloak. Come
nearer to the fire. The night is cold."</p>

<p>He drew a paper from his muff, then left it with his pelisse and
tricorne on a chair, and went forward as he was bidden, but ignored
the hand that waved him to a kidney-shaped settee. "I have come to
discharge a debt," he announced.</p>

<p>She smiled. "I am aware of none."</p>

<p>"I should be insensible, indeed, if I were not. Pray look at
this." Frowning, she took the paper, and the frown deepened as she
read that letter in her husband's hand to the King of Spain. She
raised bewildered eyes. "I do not understand."</p>

<p>Very briefly he told her of the plot which history knows as the
Cellamare Conspiracy. "There are several such letters at this
moment in the Regent's possession, for which those reckless penmen
will be fortunate if they do not pay with their heads. That can
happen only if His Highness should display a clemency rare in
princes when dealing with such plots against them. Meanwhile, the
writers of those letters, saving only de Nesle and Pompadour, who
have fled and are being hunted, and Monsieur de Horn, whose letter
I have been able to subtract from the package before it reached the
Regent, are already in the Bastille."</p>

<p>"But..." She broke off, and it was a moment before she again
found words. "You are singularly generous. Indeed, I do not
understand why you should do this for the Count of Horn. I can
hardly suppose that you love him."</p>

<p>"But I must suppose that you do."</p>

<p>"Is that your reason?"</p>

<p>"It should suffice. But I have said that I discharge a debt. You
may have forgotten that I owe you my life. I am glad to be able to
repay in kind."</p>

<p>"Your life?" Her eyes were round; her expression so startled as
to puzzle him.</p>

<p>"When you warned me of what the Parliament intended."</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" She seemed to breathe more freely. It was as if she
had supposed him to allude to something else.</p>

<p>"I do not exaggerate. Return that letter to your husband. Thus
we are quits."</p>

<p>"To your great relief, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Naturally. I have always, I hope, been scrupulous to pay my
debts." He paused a moment, and then added: "There is no reason to
prolong this intrusion. If possible it will be best if you do not
tell your husband how you have recovered the letter for him. You
will suffer me to take my leave, madame."</p>

<p>He bowed and was already turning aside to recover cloak and hat
when she checked him. "A moment, John. This letter...If it should
be discovered that you abstracted it...would you not be
compromised?"</p>

<p>"If it were discovered. But there is no fear of that so long as
you do not tell the Count that you had it from me, and no need for
concern."</p>

<p>"But there is. There must be. Is it not treason to conceal
treason?" She was suddenly resolute. "I will not have you do
it."</p>

<p>"Not do it? You have not understood that nothing less will save
your husband?"</p>

<p>"My husband!" The curling lip, and the slow scorn with which she
invested the ejaculation, took him by surprise. "You know my
husband. You used to be a judge of men, John. Can you suppose that
I would have you put perhaps your very life in peril for such a
man?"</p>

<p>His amazement deepened and brought discomfort with it. He was
reminded of something that Lady Stair had said, and words and tones
that had vaguely mystified him on the day when Margaret had carried
him in her coach to the Palais Royal. He answered lamely, "It is
not for the Count of Horn that I do this. It is for you."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. For me. Once before you put your life in danger for
me, to deliver me from the vile designs of a worthless man. Let
that suffice. It is not a sacrifice I could accept twice in a
lifetime, and certainly not for the sake of the Count of Horn. Take
back this letter."</p>

<p>"Madame, I beg you to reflect..."</p>

<p>"It needs no reflection. Oh, I see. I shock you by my lack of
wifely duty, my sheer disloyalty. There are other loyalties in
life. There is loyalty to one's own self, to one's own heart and
soul and dignity. Other loyalties must be earned before these can
be subdued."</p>

<p>His face had darkened. "I hear you with regret," he said. "Oh,
and with reluctance..."</p>

<p>"Reluctance to have me unveil my life to you. I understand."</p>

<p>"No, no. It is just that I hoped you had found happiness."</p>

<p>"Happiness?" She uttered a little mirthless laugh. "I have come
to wonder what it might be," she said, and reminded him of
something he had said once to his brother in much the same words.
"I caught a fleeting glimpse of it once; a mirage, a
will-o'-the-wisp that flashed and vanished."</p>

<p>Because he thought that he understood the allusion his
discomfort deepened.</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure I have not been lucky in my husbands," she went
on, "for which I have only my sorry wits to blame. I am paid as a
fool should be. Once, John, you thought well of me."</p>

<p>Emotion caught him and betrayed him out of his aloofness. "Once
I loved you," he amended, and saw the colour flood into her pallid
face.</p>

<p>"How deceived you must have been in me. For I am just a poor
creature to be so easily deceived by outward glitter." She sank to
the chair, by which she had been standing, and leaning forward, her
elbows on her knees, she continued reflectively, a quiet bitterness
in her words.</p>

<p>"Ned Wilson should have sufficed to cure me. Yet when the Count
of Horn wooed me I was so foolish as to hope that with him I might
yet repair the wreckage of my life. My brother Stephen warned me.
You remember Stephen. He was your friend. He warned me, but I
preferred to trust my silly intuitions.</p>

<p>"Only when I was fast in wedlock did I come to know the Count of
Horn to be what Stephen said and what you know he is: a profligate,
a fortune-hunter, an animal, who wooed me because he believed me to
be a wealthy woman. He was not wrong, for I am wealthy; very
wealthy; and yet he was wrong because my wealth is beyond his
reach, protected from him by an entail. You see, I have a son."</p>

<p>The announcement was as a sword through his flesh. She saw him
wince and lose some colour. "Does that hurt?" she asked with a
sudden plaintive tenderness, as if sorry for the wound she dealt.
"You did not know?"</p>

<p>"I did not," he answered, and asked: "King William's son?"</p>

<p>The pain in her eyes showed him that he had stabbed her in his
turn. The ghost of a smile fluttered on her lips. "Did you suppose
that I had known other lovers? Yes. King William's son. The estates
of Harpington are entailed upon him. I enjoy in them no more than a
life interest."</p>

<p>He was master of himself again. "In that at least, then, I may
congratulate you."</p>

<p>"And commiserate me in all the rest. Now that I've laid so much
bare to you. But then I wanted you to know. I wanted you to
understand why I will not have you take a risk for the Count of
Horn. That you should have wished to do so for my sake is a thought
that I shall treasure, John; perhaps the greatest treasure I shall
ever have now. Do not deny it me by insisting that you merely
sought to pay a debt. Confess that this was not altogether
true."</p>

<p>The pleading note was more than he could resist. "Not altogether
true, perhaps," he gently agreed.</p>

<p>"You thought to save me sorrow, supposing this man Horn to be
dear to me." She stood up. "Instead..." She choked on the word. It
became a sob, and for a moment afterwards she was silent, steadying
herself. "Forgive me. Your action has stirred depths that I thought
were stilled for ever. Was there ever, I wonder, so much irony in
any woman's life. To have been the wife of two men and the mistress
of a third, and yet in all my life to have loved but one man, to
whom I have been neither."</p>

<p>Between longing and indignation he was sorely shaken. "I hear
you say it, and yet how to believe it? When once it was in your
hands to choose, you chose otherwise."</p>

<p>"It was never in my hands to choose. What help had I?" she
demanded almost fiercely. "What help when...?"</p>

<p>There, abruptly, she broke off. She turned from him to stare
into the fire, so that he could no longer see her eyes.</p>

<p>"When what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"When..." She seemed to grope. Then in a low voice she added:
"When you had killed my husband."</p>

<p>"Was that why you did not follow me to Holland? Why you ignored
my appeal, left even my letters unanswered?"</p>

<p>She took time to answer, as if she hesitated. "Was it not
enough?" she asked at last. "What would the world have said?"</p>

<p>"The world! Need we have been concerned with the world? And
what, after all, could it have said? That I had killed your husband
because for his own foul profit he was complacently ready to
procure you to the King and all but made a jest of it in his
cups."</p>

<p>Still she did not meet his glance. "That...that would have been
accounted a pretext," she faltered.</p>

<p>For a moment he stared at her in silent amazement. "Am I really
to believe that such a thought prevailed? Yours was an intrepid,
self-reliant soul. You were all courage, Margaret."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it needed courage to let you go." As abruptly as she
had turned aside, she swung to face him again. "Oh, do not let us
pursue it. It wounds too deeply. You must take back this letter,
John, for I will not have you place yourself in danger."</p>

<p>"There is no danger."</p>

<p>"Do you think to deceive me? You may be a great man in France
today, the close friend of the Regent, courted by the noblesse,
dispenser of millions, invested with almost kingly power, but all
that would not suffice to shield you from the consequences of
treason."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "Let me take the risk of it. I am used to risks. I
have lived by them, and prospered. Besides--reflect!--what can I do
now? You'll see that I have burnt my boats. Can I go to the Regent
and say 'here is a letter which I purloined from the packet'? That
would be ruin, indeed, for he would be left wondering how many more
I had purloined. If I were to take back that letter it could only
be to destroy it."</p>

<p>"I see," she acknowledged gravely.</p>

<p>"And dismiss your fears; for the only risk I run is that you or
the Count of Horn should denounce my theft; and that," he added
with a smile, "of course you dare not."</p>

<p>"Had I not better burn it, then?"</p>

<p>"If you wish, but it would be wiser first to show it to the
Count, so that he may have proof that it has not reached the
Regent's hands."</p>

<p>She stood for a moment still hesitating; then she loosed the
neck of her peignoir, folded the paper and slipped it into her
bosom.</p>

<p>His eyes, intent upon her graceful movements, were hungry, and
his face was drawn as if with pain.</p>

<p>Meeting his glance again she gave him a wistful smile. "What you
have done, John, is magnanimous, all things considered. It is
worthy of you."</p>

<p>"It might be magnanimous if it were done to serve the Count of
Horn."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I would not deny myself the consolation of
knowing that it was done for me."</p>

<p>"Nor I the satisfaction of having done it. And now...if you will
give me leave...It is very late."</p>

<p>He waited for her to offer him her hand. Instead she stood
straight and stiff before him, her eyes dim, her lips tremulous.
"It is not likely that you will come again. And I dare not ask it,
unless you should ever need me. Nor is that likely. But if ever it
should be..." She made a pathetic little gesture of arms and body
that was fully expressive, and abruptly held out her hand. "There
is nothing I would not do for you, John."</p>

<p>He was bearing her hand to his lips when it was suddenly
snatched away. Startled, he straightened himself to find her gazing
at him through tears.</p>

<p>"I wonder, John, would you bestow a crumb of comfort on a poor,
lonely woman to whom you are very dear; leave her a memory to
cherish, a heartbeat about which to weave her daydreams. Take me in
your arms, John, and hold me close for just a little moment. Throw
just an instant's bridge across the abyss between us. Could
you?"</p>

<p>"Margaret!"</p>

<p>He strained her against him so that every line of her became
impressed upon him. He bent his head and kissed her on quivering
lips that were very readily surrendered.</p>

<p>"It will be fifteen years next month since you so held me," she
murmured. '"We were almost children then. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Do I remember!" He kissed her again before she gently put him
from her.</p>

<p>"Now go," she said.</p>

<p>His obedience was instant. "Goodbye, Margaret. God have you in
His keeping."</p>

<p>She watched him as he gathered up cloak and hat and muff and
went quickly from the room, and it was for long thereafter that he
was so to remember her, standing like a straight, white pillar,
sad-eyed, where he had left her.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter 19 -- THE HONOUR OF THE
COUNT OF HORN</h2>

<p>Paris had been agog that same evening with the news of
yesterday's arrest of the Prince of Cellamare and the hunt for the
others in the conspiracy in which he had been engaged. When word of
it reached the ears of Colonel de Mille, who was aware from Horn's
indiscretions of the Count's part in those dangerous activities, he
conceived it a friend's duty to get word of it to Horn so that
betimes he might place himself in safety. Because uncertain of the
Count's whereabouts, not knowing whether he was still at Sceaux, he
decided to seek the Countess in order to inform himself. Although
it was very late when he reached this decision he made up his mind
to go to her at once, even if it should entail dragging her from
her bed.</p>

<p>Coming down the Rue d'Argenteuil at about an hour after
midnight, he beheld issuing from the Count's house and silhouetted
against the light of a lantern, a tall figure, which he supposed to
be Horn's. He lengthened his stride and raised his voice.</p>

<p>"Hi! Monsieur le Comte! Hi!"</p>

<p>But paying no heed, the tall figure stepped into a waiting sedan
chair. The chairmen took up their burden, and with the
lantern-bearer marching ahead, the chair moved off.</p>

<p>Still shouting and still unheeded, the Colonel reached the
house. The porter, to whom he was known, paused in the act of
closing the door to inform him that the Count of Horn was not in
Paris and that the gentleman who had just left was a Monsieur du
Jasmin.</p>

<p>"Monsieur du Jasmin!" the Colonel echoed. "An odd name. Was he
seeking Monsieur le Comte?"</p>

<p>"No, my Colonel. He was visiting Madame la Comtesse."</p>

<p>"Parbleu!" said de Mille, and checked on a further exclamation
of shocked surprise.</p>

<p>What next he did was in obedience to his instincts for never
neglecting to gather information that might conceivably be turned
to account. He went off at speed on the trail of that sedan chair,
guided by the lantern that was swinging now in the distance. It
might be profitable to know who, in effect, was this Monsieur du
Jasmin, who visited Madame at midnight.</p>

<p>The porter closed and locked the door at last, for the night as
he supposed. But within some ten minutes he was brought back to it
by a loud knocking. This time he was confronted by a man heavily
cloaked, who thrusting him aside stepped past him and let the cloak
fall open as soon as he was within.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Comte!" ejaculated the porter in surprise. "Why,
only a moment ago Monsieur le Colonel de Mille was here and I told
him that you were not in Paris."</p>

<p>Horn paid no heed. His manner was fevered, breathless. "Madame
la Comtesse?" he asked sharply. "She is at home?"</p>

<p>"Madame will have retired for the night, I think."</p>

<p>That appeared to be enough, for the Count went leaping up the
wide, dimly lighted staircase, two steps at a time.</p>

<p>His wife's maid stood before him in the antechamber with word
that Madame la Comtesse was in bed. With a mumbled answer he took
up a lighted candlebranch from a side table, and still cloaked and
hatted entered the bedchamber unannounced.</p>

<p>The Countess was reclining, propped by pillows, her soul still
quivering from the emotional storm through which she had passed.
She raised herself and turned sharply to survey this rude
intruder.</p>

<p>"You!" she said, and a subtler ear than his might have gathered
from the monosyllable that none could have been less welcome at
that moment. "Why are you here? What do you want? Why do you break
in on me in this gross way?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to forgive me," he rasped. She saw that he was pale
and that there was a wildness in his air. "It's not a time for
madrigals. If I've ventured to break the ban and come to Paris, it
should not be necessary to tell you that the matter is serious.
It's a case of life and death in fact."</p>

<p>"Whose life, pray, and whose death?"</p>

<p>"Whose? <i>Mordieu</i>! Whose but mine? I am in mortal danger,
madame. So let that excuse my brusqueness."</p>

<p>"Is it also the reason why you keep your hat on?"</p>

<p>"It's not my hat that matters, madame, but my head."</p>

<p>"Whilst you retain it you might at least uncover it.
Still..."</p>

<p>"Oh, curse my hat!" He swept it off and cast it from him with an
obedience that might have surprised her if she had not already
guessed the source of his manifest panic and the reason for his
presence. "I am a hunted man. I am entangled in that cursed plot of
the Maines and that old fool Cellamare. You'll have heard that it
has been discovered. Cellamare and the Maines and some others have
already been arrested. The evidence is in the hands of the Regent,
and amongst it there's a letter I was mad enough to be persuaded to
write to the King of Spain. Unless I can place myself at once
beyond the reach of the Lieutenant-General I am a dead man."</p>

<p>"Then why are you here? Why have you ventured into Paris?"</p>

<p>It was a moment before he could control the rage that surged in
him at this cool indifference to the deadly peril he disclosed. At
last he found his voice to answer her. "I...I had to come. I need
your help. I am without money, and I must have money if I am to
escape. For God's sake don't look at me like that, Margot. It's not
the moment. I know my faults. I know I've a cursed nature. But
underneath it all I've loved you, Margot, and if you'll help me
now, in this desperate pass, I swear to God you shall have no cause
to complain of me hereafter. Our separation need be only temporary,
and..."</p>

<p>"That is what I fear," she interrupted. An ineffable smile
curled her lip. "The past exists. The future does not. And I know
you too well by now to suppose that once this danger is behind
you..."</p>

<p>"Don't say it, Margot. Don't say it!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, there is no need. Instead I might ask you for a better
reason than you have given why I should help you."</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried, his temper rising again. "Do you realize
what you are saying? What sort of a woman are you? Can you lie
there unmoved on your bed when my very life is threatened? After
all, madame, I am your husband."</p>

<p>"You remember it, do you?"</p>

<p>"I do," he roared, whipped to passion by this outrageous
coldness. "And I have a husband's rights. The right to command what
I have been weakly content to beg from you."</p>

<p>She smiled into that flushed, distorted face, those blazing
eyes. "I said that I might ask you for a better reason than you
have given. Not that I should ask it. Nor need you suppose that I
am moved by the reason that you give me now, which is not so much a
reason as a sort of threat. You shall have what you need. Not for
your reasons, but for my own."</p>

<p>Before that promise he judged it wise to smother his wrath. His
tone became conciliatory.</p>

<p>"They will be sound reasons, I am sure, Margot. I know the
goodness of your heart."</p>

<p>She slipped from the bed to seek in the drawer of a little table
a small bunch of keys. Whilst rummaging there, because standing
between him and the candlebranch which he had set down, her night
rail was rendered diaphanous by the light. At this vision of her,
his expression changed. The sensualist awoke in him, subduing even
his anxieties. He fetched a sigh. His voice was suddenly soft as a
caress.</p>

<p>"How lovely you are, Margot!"</p>

<p>The words and the tone sent a shudder through her very soul. She
moved swiftly aside so that a tall secretaire became interposed
between them, screening her to the height of her breast. She bent
to insert the key, leaving visible no more than her russet
head.</p>

<p>He came nearer by a step. His voice continued subdued, on a
pleading note. "After all, my dear, why so much rancour? There may
have been differences between us; but they are only a ruffling of
the surface. Underneath, God knows, we are made to understand each
other. I could never tell you all that you inspire in me. I may
have committed follies. I know I have. I admit it readily. But if
you conceived the tenderness of my feelings for you, you would be
more patient with me. For I love you so much, my dear. In the
moment that I first beheld you I knew you for my woman."</p>

<p>He had been advancing as he spoke, until now there was only the
secretaire between them, and a great fear of him such as she had
never known, a fear and a sense of nausea arose in her. She strove
to control the tumult of her breast, to dissemble the horror that
shook her at the thought of being so utterly in his power, at the
mercy of this untimely amorousness.</p>

<p>From a drawer of the secretaire she had taken a rouleau of gold
pieces and a bundle of banknotes. In a secret recess under that
same drawer lay Horn's letter to King Philip. Already her fingers
were upon the spring that governed it, with intent to give him the
letter, and so deliver him from his worst fear, when she checked on
the sudden perception of the potent weapon she possessed against
her needs.</p>

<p>She commanded herself, sternly to meet his glance and to keep
her voice level. "Here you should find a thousand louis. It is all
that I have under my hand. It should suffice you for the present."
She placed the money on top of the secretaire. "Take it, and please
go."</p>

<p>He stuffed the rouleau into one pocket, the notes into another.
His eyes were intent upon her. "I open my heart, then, in vain to
you. 'Take it and go,' eh? Dismissed like a dog. And what if I
should not choose to go? I have some right here, I believe."</p>

<p>She steeled herself to answer coldly. "That is possible. But
your danger is certain. This is the last place to which you should
have come, certainly the last in which you should linger, for it is
the first in which you will be sought since they have failed to
find you at Sceaux."</p>

<p>"At Sceaux?"</p>

<p>"Were you not there? And have not all who were at Sceaux already
been arrested? If they are hunting you, as you say, having failed
to find you there, this is the next place where they will look for
you."</p>

<p>For a moment he appeared daunted. Then, recovering, with an
abrupt gesture of disdain, "Ah, bah!" he cried. "At this hour? Even
the Lieutenant-Criminel must sleep sometimes."</p>

<p>"Do you deceive yourself with that?" She drew a bow at a
venture. "The Baron de Nesle was of your party, was he not? He must
have fled from Sceaux at the first rumour of discovery, and like
you he made the mistake of coming to Paris. He was dragged from his
bed by the Lieutenant's archers at three o'clock yesterday
morning."</p>

<p>His change of countenance announced that the shaft had gone
home. "Thousand devils! Is that true?"</p>

<p>It was not. But he had shown her that the falsehood might safely
be maintained. "How else should I know that de Nesle was one of
you? Ah! You begin to see that every moment is spent here at your
peril. You'll go at once unless you want to put the rope round your
neck with your own hands."</p>

<p>He shuddered at the image this evoked. And then, on an
inspiration, to the lash of fear she added that of cupidity. "So
lose no time. Let me have word of where you are, so that I may send
you further supplies."</p>

<p>That made an end of his desire to linger, indeed, of all desire
but the desire to be gone. She must be right, he admitted with a
foul oath. And at last, with curt thanks, less for the favours
received than for the hope of more to follow, he recovered his hat
and departed, leaving her almost swooning in relief from the
loathing he had inspired.</p>

<p>It had begun to snow when he reached the street, and
close-wrapped in his cloak he made his way down to the Rue St
Honoré. In that great artery, after a moment's hesitation, he
turned westward, and followed the long length of it and so up the
faubourg to St Philippe du Roule. It had occurred to him that he
should be safe for the night with his friend de Mille.</p>

<p>Despite the hour he was not kept waiting at the Colonel's door.
It was opened to him almost at once by de Mille in person, still
fully dressed and carrying a candle, which his hand sheltered from
the draught.</p>

<p>He expressed his surprise in an oath. "Is it you, Count? Come
in, come in. A moment sooner and you'd not have found me. I am only
just home. And it's your affairs have kept me abroad on this foul
night."</p>

<p>In the vestibule the Count shook the snow from cloak and hat.
"My affairs?"</p>

<p>"To be sure. I've news for you. But come up."</p>

<p>He went ahead, holding his candle high, to light his guest.</p>

<p>Above in the dingy room that brought memories to Horn of his
last frustrated interview with Catherine Law, the Colonel poured
him a glass of Burgundy and laced it with brandy. "This will warm
you, and, faith, you'll need warming."</p>

<p>Horn took it gratefully enough, assuming that de Mille alluded
to the chill of the place, for there were only cold ashes in the
untidy grate. He drank the half of it and smacked his lips. "What
is this news of yours?"</p>

<p>"You won't like it." The Colonel paused, then, brutally,
announced: "You're a cuckold. That's the news."</p>

<p>Horn stared at the half-sneering grin on those thick lips.</p>

<p>"You're drunk, de Mille, of course. That's not the sort of jest
I care for."</p>

<p>"Jest! Listen, my friend. You'll know that that business of the
Maines has blown up?"</p>

<p>"Of course I know it. I slipped away from Sceaux only just in
time to avoid being caught there. But what has that to do with
it?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. I happened to go to the Rue d'Argenteuil to ask
where I might find you, so as to warn you. It was long after
midnight when I got there, just as a man whom I supposed at first
to be yourself was slinking out of the house. From the porter I
learnt that he had been with Madame la Comtesse--a fellow calling
himself du Jasmin. As your friend, in your interest, I desired to
know who might be the gentleman with so odd a name. I went after
his chair. And where do you suppose it led me? To the Hôtel de
Nevers! This man who was shut up with madame in the dead of night,
and who gives a false name, is your dear friend Lass. I leave you
to draw your own conclusions."</p>

<p>Horn stood very still, his white face set and inscrutable. It
was natural that his first thought should be for Catherine Law's
announcement that it was the Countess of Horn who had betrayed to
Law the Parliament's intentions. Whilst this he had believed, her
further assertion that there was an intimacy between Law and the
Countess he had, for ends of his own, merely affected to believe.
If, when de Mille's tale was added to that, still more were needed
to convince him, he conceived that he had it in the utter
indifference to his danger which his wife had just manifested and
in the contemptuous manner of her response to his prayer for
assistance. No wonder that the traitress, still throbbing from the
embraces of her lover, should have used him with that insulting
coldness.</p>

<p>Upon this conviction passionate speech burst from him at last.
"As God lives I'll kill that scoundrel with my hands. He shall find
that I am not the man to lie still under dishonour."</p>

<p>"That's right. Think of your honour." And the Count, moving
savagely about the chamber, was too distraught to ask himself if he
was mocked by this Colonel who knew so much about him. "A spry
fellow your Scot, and a humorous. Whilst you're at pains to seduce
his wife, he pays you in advance and in kind. If anyone but you
were in question I could almost admire his impudence."</p>

<p>"I don't admire yours," growled Horn. "Devil take your foul
tongue." He continued to pace the room in his simmer of rage. "I'll
kill the loathly dog. Kill him. But first I'll have a word to say
to Madame la Comtesse, which that slut shall remember for as long
as she lives."</p>

<p>Thus the outraged Count of Horn proposed. But after a raging
sleepless night in de Mille's quarters, by an unhappy coincidence,
he reached the Rue d'Argenteuil next morning at the same time as a
detachment of military police that happened inopportunely to be
seeking him there.</p>

<p>Denied the satisfaction of even seeing his Countess and
delivering himself of all that he had rehearsed, he was thrust into
a coach and driven off to the Bastille.</p>

<p>Naturally he feared the worst, and it was not until some days
later that he learnt to his surprise that he was imprisoned, not as
he had supposed for his share in the Cellamare conspiracy, but
simply for rupture of ban. In the perquisitions made at Sceaux it
was discovered that he had been present there, and it was only
because he was within the fifty leagues to which he had been
banished that his arrest had been ordered, that he had been sought
and found in the Rue d'Argenteuil, and had been flung into prison
without any sort of trial. He was mystified but far from relieved.
Impatient to be revenged, he recalled that someone had said that
vengeance is a dish best eaten cold, and he took what comfort he
could from that.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter 20 -- THE PUBLIC DEBT</h2>

<p>Vast though they were beyond anything known in the realm of
finance, the achievements hitherto of the Laird of Lauriston were
dwarfed by the expansion he was to give them whilst the Count of
Horn was languishing in gaol.</p>

<p>It may be that in the pursuit of ever more colossal undertakings
he sought an anodyne for the heartache that he had brought away
from his last interview with the Countess of Horn. It may even be
that since she had avowed her feelings for him he was driven,
despite the abyss between them which he could not hope to bridge,
to rise to heights that should overpower imagination, and so render
him an object of secret pride to her. Such aspirations have been
known. Or, more simply, it may be that he was driven by a boundless
ambition, which was not to be satisfied until he had brought the
entire economy of France within his audacious grasp. More probably
the source of his incredible activities is to be sought in a
conjunction of these spurs, and it is as much beyond surmise as it
is idle to determine the respective part of each.</p>

<p>Following upon the immuring of her husband in the Bastille, an
imprisonment for which she had every reason to be thankful as for a
deliverance, the Countess of Horn left Paris, the house in the Rue
d'Argenteuil was closed, and, as Mr Law was to learn from Lady
Stair, she had retired to a château acquired by her in Dordogne. He
guessed that this withdrawal might be not merely out of respect for
the proprieties imposed by her husband's increased disgrace, but
out of dictates of prudence as concerned Mr Law himself. He bowed
to it in a resignation blent with approval, and flung himself
passionately into work.</p>

<p>As a result, whilst the Count of Horn sat gnawed by
vindictiveness within four walls, whilst the Duke of Noailles and
his following and the Parliament of Paris were rancorously watchful
for opportunity to destroy this foreign adventurer, whilst
Catherine Law alternated between exalted gaieties and ill-natured
suspicions of a husband from whom she derived her ever-mounting
eminence in the <i>beau monde</i>, the splendid star of the Laird
of Lauriston, ever more effulgent, climbed steadily towards its
zenith.</p>

<p>By now the monopoly of the trade with all French possessions in
America, Asia and Africa was firmly within his grasp. He was adding
to his fleet, by building and purchase, until soon now it should
number some seventy ships. He was developing the commerce in
Canadian pelts, which was beginning to assume importance, and he
was master of the monopolies of salt and tobacco.</p>

<p>Leaving all this precariously balanced upon his system of credit
at a time when the conditions of credit were only imperfectly
understood, he gave his attention to obtaining additional powers,
with the ultimate aim of assuming the office of Comptroller-General
of the Finances which was held by d'Argenson.</p>

<p>As a preliminary step, now that he had buttressed his position
by the control of the mint, and in order to obtain the farming of
the taxes, he intoxicated the Regent by a staggering proposal to
take over the national debt, the colossal burden of which, still
amounting to fifteen hundred millions and costing the Treasury an
annual interest of eighty millions, he now judged his credit strong
enough to bear. Only from a man who had already displayed Mr Law's
financial wizardry could the Regent have taken such a proposal
seriously.</p>

<p>When His Highness had recovered from his stupefaction, he
consented at least to hear the details of the scheme, and summoned
d'Argenson to attend that exposition.</p>

<p>Closeted with those two in the Palais Royal on a day of August,
Mr Law juggled with figures, countered arguments and smothered
objections until both the Prince and the Comptroller-General were
dizzy.</p>

<p>His proposal when summarized was that on condition that he be
granted the farming of the taxes and paid for the necessary loan an
interest at the rate of three per centum, equal to only fifty
millions yearly and therefore representing an annual saving to the
State of thirty millions, he would issue notes for the necessary
capital amount, and with these the State creditors would be paid
off in a given order.</p>

<p>He would issue, he announced, as a commencement one hundred
thousand shares nominally of five hundred livres, and when the
Regent, thrusting out a dubious lip, wondered if he could count
upon their being absorbed, Mr Law revealed the lure by which he
proposed to attract the public. It was a lure that amounted,
indeed, to nothing less than a constraint.</p>

<p>The monopolistic net into which he had swept up by now all the
great trading concerns, grouping them under the aegis of the India
Company, had left the national debt as virtually the only other
available medium of investment. Once this was taken over by the
Company, the investing members of the public, the <i>rentiers</i>,
would have no choice but to place their money with it if they were
to continue to enjoy an annual return. It was of an overwhelming
simplicity.</p>

<p>Convinced, at last and the conviction growing to enthusiasm, the
Regent was brought to consent.</p>

<p>It was in vain that d'Argenson, no longer of a booming
eloquence, but almost spluttering in indignation, still opposed the
measure. Before him lay the prospect of being deprived of his tax
farm, and, as Comptroller-General of the Finances, of being left
with no finances to control.</p>

<p>"Your Highness cannot fail to perceive that this is merely a
substitution of the India Company for the State; no more, in
effect, than a dangerous conversion of the bonds of the public debt
into shares in the company of Monsieur Lass. Nor can Your Highness
neglect the interest of the shareholders in the tax farms, to whom
we have been paying a dividend of twelve per centum. Is it just
that their annuities should be arbitrarily reduced to three per
centum?"</p>

<p>"Not arbitrarily," said the Regent. "You assume that they will
reinvest in the shares of the Company. They are under no compulsion
to do so."</p>

<p>"I think Monsieur Lass has made it clear that they will have no
alternative. If this project is carried into effect, the India
Company will become the only subject of investment in France, and
it is precisely upon this that Monsieur Lass is counting--that the
enormous capital of a milliard and a half cast out of investment in
the State can find no other refuge but in the shares of his
Company. Can Your Highness imagine that these annuitants will rest
content with a rate of interest that must of necessity be
enormously reduced?"</p>

<p>The Regent looked questioningly at Mr Law, who had been
listening with a smile, and left him to answer the objection.</p>

<p>"That is an assumption for which there is no real warrant,
Marquis. The interest of three per centum which is to be paid by
the State to the Company for a loan will produce forty-eight
millions annually. The tax farms yield, as you should know, a
profit of sixteen millions; the balance necessary to produce the
eighty millions which the bond-holders have been receiving and will
receive again, can well be spared from the profits of the
Company."</p>

<p>"That," said the Marquis, violently "is to build on something
that does not yet exist."</p>

<p>"Your pardon, Marquis. It exists and must exist increasingly as
trade develops."</p>

<p>"Must! I perceive no such assurance." D'Argenson's dark
countenance was flushed with indignation. "What your all-embracing
company may do is still in the realm of speculation. And I tell you
frankly, sir, and you, monseigneur, if you will permit me, that to
place this tremendous monopoly of trade in the hands of the State
is an experiment fraught with appalling dangers. The stimulus of
competition among merchants, which is the real mainspring of a
nation's wealth, is abolished; those experienced traders will be
replaced by inexperienced officials of Monsieur Lass' appointing.
Disorganization must follow, and extravagance will become unbridled
once the consequences of it are imposed upon the nation as will be
all those losses which independent merchants must avoid or
perish."</p>

<p>"I seem to hear again," said Mr Law, "the late Chancellor
d'Aguesseau. It will be in your memory, Marquis, that when he urged
those very arguments, yours was the only voice that opposed
them."</p>

<p>"Not so," d'Argenson contradicted him. "My support was for your
banking system only. None envisaged such a monstrous
all-encompassing grasp as this upon the nation's economy. I declare
it a madness to expose the country to the dangers inherent in so
sudden a disturbance of the generally accepted financial practice,
and I can foresee only disaster."</p>

<p>"Yet the arguments against my banking system were similar. Their
fallacy has been exposed by results, just as the fallacy of these
will be exposed. And meanwhile the State's obligation to find an
annual interest of eighty millions is a burden lightened almost by
half at a stroke."</p>

<p>This last was the consideration that made an end of d'Argenson's
dialectics, but by no means of his fierce resentment. On the
contrary, it was immeasurably increased by the blow to his pocket
as well as to his pride, for the anti-system was now irrevocably
smashed and the great profits he had derived from the tax farms
were lost to him.</p>

<p>Remembering how he had supported Law's banking proposals at a
time when all opinion had been against him, d'Argenson looked
malevolently upon the Scot as a snake that he had nourished in his
bosom. Defeated both as a financier and a lawyer, he went from the
Palais Royal that day as Mr Law's bitterest enemy.</p>

<p>Later, at the Hôtel de Nevers, when Mr Law announced this
triumph to his brother, far from arousing in him an exultation
comparable with his own, he was met by dismay framed in arguments
akin to those of d'Argenson and advanced with far greater
frankness.</p>

<p>The steady, prudent, younger Law was aghast at a project of such
perilous magnitude. Aware that his brother had been contemplating
this scheme, which he regarded as a terrifying gamble, he had put
his trust in the Regent's fundamental acuteness and had been
confident that His Highness would reject it. Even now he could
scarcely believe that audacity and plausibility should so far have
overborne prudence and carried the day.</p>

<p>He sat glumly in his chair, listening to a paean of victory,
that brought sweat to his brow. Instead of the fanfare of trumpets
which Mr Law believed that he deserved, a groan was all he got from
William.</p>

<p>"It frightens me," said he.</p>

<p>"It must be that you don't yet understand. In simple terms, I am
replacing a credit that is old and moribund by one that is new and
vigorous."</p>

<p>"How long will it retain its vigour when supporting this
terrific load--a couple of milliards added to what we already
carry? It's a load that will crush us."</p>

<p>Mr Law derided him. "Cassandra foretelling the doom of
Troy."</p>

<p>"But I'll hope, not like Cassandra, unheeded by the doomed."</p>

<p>"Doomed! Pray consider, Will, that once we have the edict and I
complete the conversion we shall have raised an establishment that
will unite in itself the banking, the commerce and the
administration of all the finances of France. It will constitute
the most formidable financial power that was ever wielded."</p>

<p>"That is what daunts me: this monopoly of powers such as are
exercised only with difficulty even when normally distributed. Are
you equal to it?"</p>

<p>"With your help, Will."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, my help is yours for the bidding; every ounce
of it. But you'll need a deal more. Lord! Whither will it all lead
us in the end? I'd feel better if I saw aught in the trend of
things in Louisiana to encourage us. The Mississippi's proving no
Pactolus. Will it ever? Aye, smile, John. You account me fearful, I
know. The fact is I haven't your gambler's nerves."</p>

<p>"Confess at least that I've not fumbled the dice so far."</p>

<p>"I do, John. I'll say that you've the devil's own skill in
reckoning the chances. But--God's sake," he groaned, "could you not
be content with what we have? Is there no end to your greed?"</p>

<p>"Greed!" Mr Law was provoked into laughter. "What greed do I
display? I can plunge my hands into millions, yet what do I take
for myself? What possessions have I acquired beyond that little
property of Guermande down in Brie, to humour Catherine, so that
between whiles she may play the châtelaine? The train that I keep
in Paris may be princely, but it is no more than I could maintain
on the fortune I brought with me into France. Greed, forsooth! I've
told you before, Will, that with me the game is all. And," he
added, with a sudden grimness, "it is all I have. Why grudge it
me?"</p>

<p>"It's not grudging it you I am. It's fearing it may break you in
the end."</p>

<p>Mr Law shrugged. "A soldier knows that he risks his life. That
does not prevent him from being a soldier. Each of us must dree his
weird as his nature bids him." Airily he quoted Montrose: "'He
either fears his fate too much or his desserts are small, that
dares not put it to the touch to gain or lose it all'."</p>

<p>"Ah, well. Ye ken what came of that."</p>

<p>"Maybe I'll build better than did he."</p>

<p>"If you think it canny to build on sand, which is what I doubt
you're doing."</p>

<p>"The sand will turn to rock once the yield from overseas begins
to flow."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay. But will it flow in time?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't it?"</p>

<p>Will sighed, and mopped his brow. His deliberate Scottish
accents were gloomy. "I'm thinking ye'll need to work a miracle,
like Moses when he struck water from his rock."</p>

<p>"With this difference, that whilst he merely brought forth water
I shall bring forth gold. Meanwhile there's work to be done against
the granting of the edict."</p>

<p>That edict was promulgated before the end of the month, and
registered by Parliament in smothered anger. It cancelled the
existing lease of the tax farms and conveyed them to the India
Company. It ordered the reimbursement of capital to the
shareholders in the farms as well as to all annuitants in the
public debt. The holders of these securities were to present
themselves at the Treasury, each to obtain a quittance for the
amount of his holding, which he was immediately to take to the
India Company to be discharged there either in gold or banknotes as
he wished.</p>

<p>Considering the premium established by now upon the paper
currency it was confidently reckoned that this would be preferred
to specie, and the Regent had agreed that to meet the consequent
requirements Law should print a sufficiency of notes. These were
subsequently to be destroyed in a measure as they were paid in to
the India Company for the purchase of the shares of the new
issue.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter 21 -- THE GOAD</h2>

<p>At about the time of the publication of that edict which was to
hoist John Law to the very pinnacle of achievement, rendering him
the economic master of France and wielder of an intoxicating power,
the Earl and Countess of Stair paid a visit to the Laird of
Lauriston and his lady which was not without importance. On the
part of his lordship the visit, under its social aspect, possessed
an official significance.</p>

<p>Mr Law was by now too great a man to be overlooked by foreign
powers. The vast dominion he had gathered into his hands, so that
all the trade of France and her colonies must flow as he directed,
made it desirable not only for individuals but even for nations to
conciliate him.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence that the Earl of Stair had received
instructions from his government in this sense. He came, then, with
proposals of commercial relations to be established between England
and France, with offers of service to Mr Law in England, not merely
general but also particular in the matter of lifting the ban
against him.</p>

<p>Mr Law received these inspired advances with a perfect,
noncommittal suavity, inwardly unmoved.</p>

<p>With the angular Countess, however, it was a very different
story. The news she gave him left him placid only on the surface.
Her kinswoman, the Countess of Horn, had just arrived in Paris,
brought back from the Dordogne by the need to concert with Lord
Stair as British ambassador measures concerned with her English
estates.</p>

<p>"She is not likely to remain here long, nor to show herself,
considering the imprisonment of her disgraceful husband."</p>

<p>She paused as if awaiting Mr Law's comment, her close-set,
shrewish eyes intent upon his discouraging impassivity. As he
offered none beyond an acknowledging inclination of the head, she
went on.</p>

<p>"Madame de Horn has confided to me that you are a very old
friend--a friend of the days of that scapegrace Beau Wilson."</p>

<p>The sly smile and the unfortunate allusion were both detestable
to him. His sternness induced her to offer him a sigh. "It was as I
feared. The poor soul has no more fortune in her second husband
than in her first. But there! I tell you this because it is my
dearest wish that in her unhappy circumstances she should quit
France and go home to England, and I have thought that you, as her
friend and having her interests at heart, might add your
persuasions to mine. I have a hope that your influence might bring
about what all her friends desire for her."</p>

<p>"I fear that your ladyship flatters me by exaggerating that
influence," he answered gravely.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it, Mr Law. I protest I can't. And, anyway, I
hope that you will make the attempt--unless," she added, with a
renewal of the smile he found so hateful, "unless, of course, you
should prefer that she remain in France."</p>

<p>"It is beyond me to imagine why your ladyship conceives I might
prefer it."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Her smile grew into a laugh. The shrill note of it drew
Catherine's attention from his lordship, and Mr Law was almost
startled by her pallor.</p>

<p>"What is amusing, Lady Stair?"</p>

<p>Her ladyship was arch. "That is a secret, my dear; and a wise
wife should not pry too closely into her husband's secrets."</p>

<p>"Lady Stair confesses her lack of wisdom," his lordship jested.
Catherine did not heed him. Her eyes were searching her husband's
face. They found its stony composure suspicious. But she kept her
questions until their visitors had left.</p>

<p>"Lord Stair tells me that the Countess of Horn is back in
Paris." Her voice was strained and unsteady. "Does that happen to
be Lady Stair's amusing secret?"</p>

<p>"That is how she was so foolish as to describe it."</p>

<p>She considered him with a crooked smile. "I marvel at the
effrontery of that woman to show herself here when her husband is
in disgrace in the Bastille."</p>

<p>"Did not Dalrymple tell you that she came especially to seek his
good offices in the matter of her English property?"</p>

<p>"He told me that. Yes. And something else that I have been far
from suspecting: that her property in England is the estate of
Harpington. Isn't that the title of the woman who was your mistress
until she became King William's?"</p>

<p>Mentally he reeled under the blow. Outwardly he miraculously
preserved his self-control. "That I would have married her had the
chance been mine you have always known. That she was ever my
mistress is a lie. You have never ceased to attribute mistresses to
me, Catherine, and I have never wasted breath to deny your
suspicions, however fatuous. But where Margaret Ogilvy is concerned
I tell you again that it is blackest falsehood."</p>

<p>"That will be why you are so sharp-set to defend her whilst so
indifferent in the case of others."</p>

<p>"To be sure suspicion must feed upon itself and swell by what it
feeds on."</p>

<p>"Suspicion! If it's a suspicion it feeds upon what you supply.
Why did you never tell me that this woman is Margaret Ogilvy? Why
conceal it if you had nothing else to conceal? And she had the
effrontery to seek you here--here in my house! Suspicion, you say!"
She laughed bitterly. "You had better know that it is a suspicion
shared by the Count of Horn. Indeed, not a suspicion--a conviction
for which he will yet call you to account. You'll tell me perhaps
that it is only suspicion that for the sake of that abominable
woman you murdered Edward Wilson?"</p>

<p>"Murdered!" He shrugged despairingly, shaken from his calm. "It
was, then, to a murderer and a seducer that you came in Amsterdam?
Believing so much evil of me yet you did not hesitate to seek
me."</p>

<p>"Because I loved you--God help me for a fool. I followed you to
comfort you in your need. To my undoing."</p>

<p>"You came to comfort me?" His lip curled. "To comfort me with
the tale that the woman I loved was the King's mistress?"</p>

<p>"To cure you of your infatuation for a strumpet, as it should
have done if you had any proper pride. To care for you in your
loneliness and exile, as God knows I have cared for you, only to be
so illrequited that I have wished myself dead these years." Then in
a sudden increase of passion she railed at him. "Go to your woman.
Go! She is here in Paris, waiting for you. Why else has she come?
Do you think I don't realize that the need to consult Lord Stair is
no more than a pretext? Go to her then! Go!"</p>

<p>She flung out of the room on that, and he made no attempt to
stay her, realizing how far beyond the reach of argument she was
placed by the violence that possessed her spirit.</p>

<p>He was left in an emotional disturbance as deep as any that he
had known in a dozen years and more. It rested upon the anger he
had repressed and perhaps a little upon the knowledge that Margaret
was again within his reach. The temptation to seek her must in any
case have assailed him, but it could never have been as
overmastering as it was rendered by the cruel terms in which
Catherine had loosened such tenuous bonds of duty to her as he
still retained.</p>

<p>It was in this distracted state of mind that he came to his
work-room, where he found his brother and Angus McWhirter
waiting.</p>

<p>"We're here to see you, John, about opening the lists for the
new issue. I've drawn up the notice we discussed, for your
approval. Make sure that the terms are correct, then settle the
amount to be issued, so that Angus may take it to the Bank."</p>

<p>Mr Law, at his writing table, bent over the sheet his brother
placed before him. The figures swam under his blood-injected eyes.
He passed a hand wearily across his brow, as if to brush away the
emotions that were clouding thought. He read the document
twice.</p>

<p>"It should serve, I think," he said at last, as he handed it
back.</p>

<p>His brother stared at him. "God's sake, John! Are you
ailing?"</p>

<p>"Ailing? No."</p>

<p>"But the figures, man. You've not settled them."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. The figures." He thought a moment, only to discover
that he was in no case to think. He recalled that he had decided
and agreed with the Regent that, in order not to deluge the market,
the issue should be a gradual one. "Say we make it a half-milliard.
That should suffice for a commencement. A third of the total, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>He wrote the figure at the foot of the document, and again
proffered it.</p>

<p>"And the terms?" asked William. "Are you settled in your mind
that they are to be as before; that is, with faculty to acquire
them by instalments? Yesterday you mentioned a doubt."</p>

<p>"Did I?" He raised a dull glance. He sought to recall what the
doubt could have been, failed, and shook his head, his manner
incomprehensibly vague. "No. I think it will serve. As before. Why
not? You can publish it in the morning, Angus, and make ready for a
siege."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, I'll be ready, never fear, Mr Law."</p>

<p>They left him, and he sat back to think, but not of the gigantic
operation he was launching. Had his mind been on that, and his
brain of its normal clarity, he could not have failed to perceive
that he had made his first miscalculation, and one that carried in
itself the seeds of disaster.</p>

<p>But his mind was swinging like a pendulum between Catherine and
Margaret, between resentment and longing, each emotion serving as
fuel for the other. Catherine charged Margaret with being his
mistress, and by the malevolent intensity of her persuasion almost
begot in him the desire to make it true.</p>

<p>There was yet another poison Catherine had distilled for him,
that now served to quicken this desire. The need to consult Stair,
she had said, had been no more than a pretext to bring Margaret
back to Paris, within his reach. It might be so. He did not quite
believe that it was, not even when he recalled the leers of Lady
Stair. But he certainly desired to believe it.</p>

<p>According to Catherine that rascal Horn was of the same mind as
herself. So that his wife and Margaret's husband shared the foul
conviction. If he were to yield to the temptation that assailed him
now at the thought of Margaret's accessibility, he would be doing
no more than justify those two in their persuasion...</p>

<p>That was the goad that drove him, soon after dark, alone and on
foot to the Rue d'Argenteuil.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter 22 -- REVELATION</h2>

<p>It did not occur to Mr Law on this occasion to employ a <i>nom
de guerre</i>. Boldly he had himself announced by his own name, and
the footman who bore the announcement returned almost at once to
conduct him to that same boudoir of rose damask panels and black
and gold chinoiserie in which she had last received him.</p>

<p>She stood before him in the informal sacque in which ladies of
fashion took their ease at home. It was cut low at the neck and of
the colour of <i>feuille morte</i>, which, save for its lack of
lustre, almost matched her russet hair.</p>

<p>She smiled as she greeted him. "How did you learn that I am in
Paris?"</p>

<p>"I wish that I could say that some subtle sense brought me the
knowledge. But, in effect, it was nothing subtler than my Lady
Stair."</p>

<p>"Why have you come?" was her next question.</p>

<p>"For this," he said, and gathered her into his arms and kissed
her lips.</p>

<p>She did not deny him. But she cut short the embrace and put him
from her, with a half-reproof. "This is not wise."</p>

<p>"Nor wisely intended."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Her glance was keen. A feverishness in his manner made her
suddenly solemn. "Will you not sit?" she invited, and herself sank
to a chair, spreading her gown. "You will have some deeper
reason."</p>

<p>He remained standing over her. "Reason is not concerned. I
merely obey the instinct to come to you as soon as I learn that you
are within reach."</p>

<p>She disregarded this. It was plain that her casualness was
forced, she was ill at ease.</p>

<p>"Had you delayed until tomorrow you would no longer have found
me. The business with Lord Stair that brought me is done, and there
is no reason for me to stay."</p>

<p>"That is utterly to crush the wild hope I fostered."</p>

<p>Again she scrutinized him, and her lip quivered. "It cannot be
that you are making love to me, John," she said between question
and assertion.</p>

<p>"Is it odd that I should? Is there good reason why I should
not?"</p>

<p>"It is you now who talk of reason. But I, too, have my
instincts, and they rebel. Come, John, let us be sane. I know that
I am to blame for this. I was wanting in discretion when last you
were here. I suffered my feelings to master me for a moment. But I
trusted you, and trusting you I believe it could have no sequel. Do
not spoil that. Please, John. Do not diminish my esteem for
you."</p>

<p>"Esteem!" He was aggrieved. "You had another word for it when
last I was here."</p>

<p>"I have said that I lacked discretion. And now you are proving
it." Her tone was sad. "Be generous, my dear. You found me in an
hour of weakness, a poor distraught woman with a fresh, raw wound
to add to the many life has dealt me. At such times we are apt to
leave a slack rein to our feelings."</p>

<p>"What has changed since then?" he demanded. "Has Horn become
more worthy, or Catherine less of a shrew? Is either of us less
lonely or alone?"</p>

<p>"That is nothing to the matter. It draws us no nearer to each
other."</p>

<p>"Not if we are fools," he cried, and sank to one knee beside
her, grasping the hands that lay limp in her lap. "Margaret my
dear, must we be fools, indeed? Are we never to draw strength and
comfort from each other in the loneliness in which each of us is
wasting?"</p>

<p>Her agitation deepened. Her eyes looked almost black in the
whiteness of her face. "What do you know of loneliness who hold an
empire in your strong hands? Does not that suffice you, without
seeking a poor woman for your toy?"</p>

<p>"That is a cruel thing to say to me."</p>

<p>"Cruel! If you cannot understand that the cruelty is yours, you
do not know what cruelty means. Did I lay bare my heart in an
unguarded hour so that you should come and tear fresh wounds in
it?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Margaret. To heal the old ones, and to heal my own at the
same time. Why will you deny me?"</p>

<p>"God knows I would deny you nothing, John. I am yours if you
want me, but...Oh, God!" she wrenched her hands from his and
covered her face, sinking back into her chair. "I have prayed that
you never would. Not this way." There was anguish in her voice. "I
suppose that I have given you cause to think me a woman whom you
can ask to be your mistress. That is what wounds: that you should
so regard me."</p>

<p>Mortification and frustrated longings wrung from him
unpardonable words. "To be sure I am not a king. You shudder as if
in horror. But you had no horror of the Dutchman after I, like a
fool, had removed the husband who for his profit would have yielded
you to him."</p>

<p>She uncovered her face again, to look at him, and he beheld it
charged with pain and anger. "And now you insult me! You dare to
reproach me with that. You dare because you never understood. You
had neither the wit nor the faith that would have made you
understand.</p>

<p>"Did you never ask yourself why you were not hanged as
sentenced, nor yet why Mr Bentinck should have opened for you the
prison door and provided for your escape, on the sole condition
that you left England at once and never returned in King William's
lifetime? Did you not? Then I will tell you.</p>

<p>"When you lay under sentence in Newgate I went to the King to
beg your life. He questioned me on my relations with you. But that
is no matter. He was kind, with a kindness that frightened me. He
would consider, he said, and I should hear from him. I did. He sent
his lackey Bentinck to offer me your life and liberty...on
terms."</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" cried the man at her feet, overcome by sudden
revelation, moved now in his turn to hide his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>Her lips twitched in a crooked smile that was like a grin of
pain.</p>

<p>"You begin to understand. The bargain I was offered revolted me.
I cursed that smug Dutch gentleman, and called upon God to punish
him and his master. Then I thought of you, and took fright. I
reflected that my life was ruined in either case, and that yours,
at least, might be saved. And your life was the price I accepted
for my harlotry."</p>

<p>So far she had spoken in a low voice that was charged with
sorrow. And now its pathos deepened. "I was not born to be a
harlot, John, as you should know. I was a woman of a high pride and
of the dignity that comes of virtue fiercely guarded. Yet a harlot
I became for your sake, so that for years you might loathe me, and
in the end reproach me with it as you have done tonight."</p>

<p>"Margaret!" The name broke from him in a sob. He bowed his head
almost to the ground. He took the hem of her gown and bore it to
his lips. "I am not worthy even of so much. As God hears me I would
rather that I had hanged. How could I guess? How could I
guess?"</p>

<p>At the agony in his voice, the humility of his act, all passion
fell from her. Her hand moved over his head in a caress. Very sadly
and quietly she spoke. "Had your faith been stout enough there
would have been no need to guess."</p>

<p>"Do me justice," he cried, starting to his feet. "When Bentinck
came to me in Newgate there was no mention of you."</p>

<p>"And you never asked yourself why he should come at all, and
offer you so much."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I did. And I supposed it common justice; that they
recognized the sentence as excessive, yet did not wish to admit it
openly. I killed Wilson in a fair encounter, as any court of honour
must have adjudged, and gentlemen are not to be hanged for that,
whatever the edicts."</p>

<p>"Yes," she admitted slowly. "There is that. It is what I have
thought."</p>

<p>"If I had known, if he had dared to tell me, I must have cast my
life back in his teeth."</p>

<p>"Which is why he did not tell you. Afterwards...why should I
have given you knowledge of something that was past mending? It
could serve only to torment you, as it torments you now when a gust
of anger left me without the generosity or good sense to continue
to hide it."</p>

<p>"Never think that." At last he looked at her again, and found
her in tears. "The only present shame is mine for...for having
provoked the avowal. Yet, however this thing may haunt me, in my
soul I must be glad of the knowledge. For there you are enshrined
again, wholly pure as you were in the days when I had no thought of
you that was not of worship. Of your charity, Margaret, forgive me
for this hour."</p>

<p>"I do, in thankfulness."</p>

<p>He stood straight and squarely before her. "And now,
Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Now?" She contrived to smile up at him through her tears. "It
is time, I think, to say good night." She stood up. "Good night and
goodbye, my dear. It will be best for both of us that it should be
goodbye. Finally goodbye."</p>

<p>"If I believed that, life would have little purpose left."</p>

<p>"You say that in the weakness of the moment. There is abundant
purpose in your life, John, and I doubt not that I shall find some
in mine."</p>

<p>Tenderly she brought him to take his leave. "It shall be my
constant prayer," he said, "that the life you have preserved for me
may be worthy of the dreadful sacrifice you made."</p>

<p>"I thank you for that. They are healing words." She took his
head between her hands, drew it down and kissed him on the lips.
"God have you ever in His keeping, my dear."</p>

<p>It was a prayer that was not immediately to be answered, for he
departed in torment, and in torment abode in the days that
followed. Only the knowledge that she had quitted Paris kept him
from yielding to the overpowering need to see her again, and left
him moving like a sleep walker whilst the greatest hazard of his
gambler's life was being played.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter 23 -- THE ZENITH</h2>

<p>It required a shock to snatch him out of his somnambulism, and
it was McWhirter who supplied it a week later.</p>

<p>This henchman of his came to the Hôtel de Nevers one morning of
mid-September in a fever of jocund excitement.</p>

<p>"Man," he declared, "ye bade me be ready for a siege, and the
devil's own siege it is. D'ye not know what's toward in the Rue
Quincampoix? The issue of shares is going fast. There was never
such a garboil. It's just Bedlam yonder, so it is. The street is
agog with <i>agioteurs</i>, and the price this morning stands at
three thousand livres. Six times the original value, no less. It's
fair cluttered out of my senses I am, with all the world clamouring
to buy."</p>

<p>"All the world?" echoed Mr Law, his quick instinct, suddenly
aroused, already scenting in McWhirter's exultation something that
was amiss.</p>

<p>"Ay. All the world. I'm thinking we'll scarce need the extra
printing of notes. Though, to be sure, there's an awkward side to
it. A mob of annuitants who've cashed their receipts at the bank
are bleating and protesting for shares at the price of issue as
their right, and at this rate we shall soon have none to sell
them."</p>

<p>"God's death!" thundered Mr Law, now thoroughly awake. "When
were the lists opened?"</p>

<p>"A week since, of course."</p>

<p>"Upon whose authority?"</p>

<p>McWhirter stared open-mouthed, amazed at so much vehemence in a
man whose imperturbability had passed into a byword. "Why, upon
whose authority but your own?"</p>

<p>"Mine!" Mr Law looked at him in horror. "When did I give
it?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't it in the note of terms Mr William and I laid before
you?"</p>

<p>Elbow on the table, Mr Law took his head in his hands.</p>

<p>"And where's the great harm, after all?" wondered the
crestfallen subordinate.</p>

<p>"The harm! And the shares stand already at three thousand
livres. If this rage of speculation continues where is it going to
land us? Damn the <i>agioteurs</i>!"</p>

<p>McWhirter, accounting the explosion merely rhetorical, stood
silent, wondering and waiting.</p>

<p>Mr Law groaned. He struck the table with his fist. "However did
I come to overlook it?"</p>

<p>He perceived, of course, that what he had foreseen--the factor,
indeed, upon which he had built--that the State creditors for the
fifteen hundred millions must avail themselves of the only
available channel of reinvestment in the India Company--had been
equally foreseen by every speculator of ordinary astuteness.
Foreseeing it, they had made haste to buy the shares in order to
make the State creditors pay dearly for them when they came to
reinvest. And the operation was made easy for them by the fact that
a comparatively small cash deposit sufficed to give them possession
of a share. It was not that he had overlooked the inevitability of
this. He had seen it as clearly as the mischief that might follow
out of it, and he had intended to provide before the lists were
opened. The omission was due to the obfuscation of his mind, coming
from his scene with Catherine, at the moment of considering the
note of terms.</p>

<p>He commanded himself now, so that he might grapple with this
complication. "Measures must be taken at once, Angus. The State
creditors have every reason to complain. It is a scandal that they
should be mulcted in this fashion so as to make fortunes for men
who are gambling on a certainty. In one way or another the mischief
must be checked before it goes further. Meanwhile, let the Bank
hold what shares remain. Announce that the subscriptions are
complete. Ask Mr William to come to me this afternoon."</p>

<p>The decision he took was to open at once a new subscription list
for the second half-milliard, which he had not intended to offer
for some months to come, whilst establishing by edict now, as he
should have done earlier, that these shares could be acquired only
against Treasury receipts for bonds surrendered. In this way, by
eliminating the intermediary stage of converting the receipts into
currency, he ensured that the bond-holders must have the first
call.</p>

<p>As a remedial measure it was sound enough, but it was belated.
The harm had been done and an impetus given to unbridled
speculation the end of which it was impossible to foresee.</p>

<p>In the meantime the price of the India Company shares continued
upwards, and even the State bonds, which had been at a depreciation
of sixty per centum, were now above par and virtually unprocurable
in view of the further impending conversion.</p>

<p>Considering what had happened to the first issue and the sharp
rise that had taken place, the announcement of the second lists
resulted in a no less feverish activity in the Rue Quincampoix. The
price racing upwards from the three thousand livres which had
startled Law, was soon standing at six thousand.</p>

<p>The neighbouring streets of Saint Denis and Saint Martin were
encumbered with waiting coaches, and in the Rue Quincampoix itself
pandemonium reigned about the Bank, not only by day but throughout
the night, so that in the end the dwellers in the neighbourhood
complained of it. Barricades had to be set up at both ends of the
street, guarded by troops when closed, which was from nine o'clock
at night until nine o'clock on the following morning, and opening
and closing to the sound of a bell.</p>

<p>At the Treasury Offices from morning to night there were long
queues of bond-holders, in a frenzied scrimmage to surrender their
bonds and obtain their receipts, so as to convert them into the
soaring shares at the earliest moment.</p>

<p>Outside the Hôtel de Nevers the Street was blocked by the
carriages of persons of quality, who, taking advantage of their
social rank or personal relations with Mr Law came directly to him
to procure the part of this Golconda to which their holdings of
State bonds entitled them.</p>

<p>Because into the edict constituting the Company Mr Law had
astutely prevailed upon the Regent to introduce an article
providing that no derogation should attend the possession of its
shares, a nobility, impoverished like the King by the prodigality
and wars of Louis XIV, besieged the mansion of this worker of
financial miracles. All that was proudest in France made
antechamber to him, suing for admission to his august presence, so
that it might court his favour.</p>

<p>At his hands the Duke of Bourbon exchanged his Treasury receipts
for a block of shares of a value already so enhanced that he was
enabled to pay his debts and begin to rebuild his magnificent
Château of Chantilly. He was sought by the hump-backed, irascible,
young Prince de Conti, fiercely complaining that having obtained at
the time of the first issue his receipts for an exceptionally heavy
holding of depreciated bonds, he had been too late to convert them
into shares even at treble their original value. He had fortunately
abstained--fortunately, that is, if Monsieur Lass would now do him
right and grant him out of the second issue those shares at their
face value.</p>

<p>His was, of course, the case of many an annuitant, lacking,
however, the Prince's exalted rank to embolden him to carry his
case into the holy of holies of that Temple of Mammon.</p>

<p>Mr Law obliged him, and de Conti departed from the Hôtel de
Nevers vowing himself for ever Mr Law's devoted servant and bearing
away shares which he could already sell in the Rue Quincampoix for
eight times their value, and thus realize at once a fortune.</p>

<p>Similarly, and with greater willingness, Mr Law favoured his
friend the Duke of Antin, who had also been left by the first issue
with his receipts unconverted, and there were many others of the
best and proudest blood of France, such as the Prince of Rohan, the
Prince of Guémenée, the Duke of La Force, and the Duke of La
Vrillière, who left the Hôtel de Nevers pledged by gratitude
eternally to his service.</p>

<p>Whilst these noble clients besieged him in his Sybaritic study,
their ladies crowded Catherine's salon, bearing gifts and
invitations whereby to swell the adulatory court that was being
paid the House of Law.</p>

<p>As an expression of the great social consequence she had now
attained Catherine was presently moved to give a white ball for
their daughter, then in her thirteenth year. It was eagerly
attended by the most brilliant gathering the Court could furnish,
actually graced by the Duchess of Berri, the foreign embassies, and
even the Papal Nuncio, who publicly embraced the winsome little
heroine of the fête.</p>

<p>The child's hand was being sought in marriage for the sons of
some of the noblest houses in France, whilst her little brother, of
the same age as the King, was commanded to Versailles to become His
Majesty's playmate.</p>

<p>These intoxicating triumphs, through which Catherine moved with
splendours almost royal, attended ever by a turbaned black boy from
Sénégal--a gift from the Duke of Antin--to carry her purse or fan,
were not without their effect upon her and even aroused in her a
sense of gratitude for the husband whose greatness had procured her
them. Her attitude towards him became more conciliatory than it had
been for years, and this came the more readily to her since
learning that the Countess of Horn's visit to Paris had been of the
briefest.</p>

<p>Knowing that the Countess had left almost as soon as she had
arrived, Catherine had reached the conclusion that there might,
after all, be no grounds for at least some of the charges she had
flung at her husband in such unmeasured and offensive terms.
Penitent, she sought by submissiveness to offer amends.</p>

<p>He did not make it easy. Sardonic of lip and eye, he observed
her timid advances, and once, when she pressed them to the point of
wearying him, he let her know that he was not deceived, that he
attached no false value to them. In his impatience he became almost
brutally bitter.</p>

<p>"Do not you, too, dear Catherine, be at the trouble of wooing
the mighty Baron Lass, the patron of princes, the hierophant of
Mammon, the director of empire, who tomorrow may be His Majesty's
Comptroller-General. Do not be dazzled, my dear, by the greatness
of which you share the effulgence. To you I am just John Law of
Lauriston, Jessamy John, as they used to call me."</p>

<p>Her eyes were piteously reproachful. "I would to God you were.
Why will you be so unkind? Why hold such mean suspicions of my
motives?"</p>

<p>"Is the right to harbour mean suspicions yours alone?"</p>

<p>This was a home thrust. It gave her pause. She even went so
far--and it was far to go for a woman of her pride--as to confess
some fault and to sue frankly for his forgiveness.</p>

<p>Aware of how much this must cost her, and at the same time
uneasy in his conscience, the end of it was that he was so far
moved as to comfort her with an assurance which in other
circumstances he would have disdained to offer.</p>

<p>"It is a suspicion," he said, "with which you need not again
torment yourself. Whatever Margaret Ogilvy may have been to me in
the past, before I became your husband, let me tell you again that
she was never my mistress. Since I am under no necessity to say
what is not true and seek no profit from it, you need not hesitate
to believe me. And I can add, if it will make an end of all this,
that I am never likely to see Margaret Ogilvy again."</p>

<p>The flush that mounted to her cheek, the sudden quickening of
her glance and its wistful gentleness went through him like a
sword.</p>

<p>"There was no greatness about you, John," she plaintively
reminded him, "when I came to you in Amsterdam. You were a broken
man in those days. You should remember that. It will teach you how
false are your reproaches now."</p>

<p>But although he humbled himself by admitting that he remembered
it, the persuasion abode with him that the departure from her
habitual frowardness was due to satisfaction in the social eminence
to which he had raised her with himself.</p>

<p>It was an eminence that had not yet reached its zenith, though
fast approaching it.</p>

<p>The absorption of the India Company's second issue of shares was
so rapid and left so many still unsatisfied that he could perceive
no reason to delay opening the third and final list. Accordingly he
did so in October, and witnessed the same avidity to subscribe.</p>

<p>Once more there was a clamant mob of nobles in his antechambers,
and amongst them came again the Prince de Conti. The little
hunchback proved of those to whom appetite comes with eating. Not
content with having amassed a fortune by the favour Law had shown
him at the time of the second issue he came now demanding
participation in the third on the same terms.</p>

<p>Urbanely Mr Law denied him. "On the last occasion, monseigneur,
there was reason why I should oblige you. Today I must first think
of all those who have not yet realized their conversions. You will
see that I should be blameworthy if I neglected their just
claims."</p>

<p>The grasping Prince, however, cared nothing about that. No plea
of justice was likely to put him off. He urged his rank, spoke
forcibly of the value of his favour, as a gross hint of the harm
that might be wrought by his disfavour.</p>

<p>Mr Law remained unmoved, unless it be by a contempt which he
scarcely dissembled. "It was my hope that I had won that favour on
the last occasion. Do me right, monseigneur."</p>

<p>Baffled, the Prince took at last a sullen leave, forgetting on
this occasion to profess himself Mr Law's servant.</p>

<p>With that third issue, the operation which Mr Law had originally
intended to spread over a year was completed in little more than
two months, and the national debt of fifteen hundred millions was
liquidated, to the inexpressible and marvelling satisfaction of the
Regent.</p>

<p>More than ever enthralled by Law's genius, His Highness now at
last invited him to assume the exalted office of His Majesty's
Comptroller-General, and since it was not permissible for any man
who was not a Catholic to hold an office of State, Mr Law duly
qualified by changing his religion and going to Mass, to the great
scandal of McWhirter as well as of Catherine. Thus he became <i>de
jure</i> what already he had been <i>de facto</i>, and d'Argenson
was further incensed and embittered by removal from that office and
the need to content himself with the retention of the Seals as
Chancellor.</p>

<p>The Laird of Lauriston perceived clearly enough, and not without
uneasiness, that for this swift achievement of his aims following
out of the liquidation of the national debt, he had to thank his
initial false step, which alone had permitted the <i>agioteurs</i>
to take advantage of the situation and steal a march upon the
legitimate State creditors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the avalanche of speculation which they had started
rolled on so irresistibly that by Christmas the shares of the India
Company were changing hands at the staggering figure of fifteen
thousand livres, which was thirty times their face value. A frenzy
of gambling ensued, the like of which had never been witnessed, and
this was by no means confined to the stock of the Company. From the
remotest provinces of France, and even from abroad, there was so
steady an invasion of Paris by fortune-seekers, that soon the city
with a quarter of a million more than its ordinary inhabitants
could scarcely house them. Here were further chances for the
speculators. They snatched up all available lodgings in
anticipation of the vast demand for them, which must raise the
rents to fantastic heights. They bought up the necessities of life,
perceiving that the cost of living must inevitably increase for the
same reason. The Dukes of La Force, d'Antin and d'Estrées,
forgetting the obligations of their birth, embarked through
nominees in the wholesale purchase of cloth, candles, chocolate,
coffee and sugar, whence a scandal followed. Similarly, seats on
the coaches from the country were bought up in advance by
speculators, and legitimate travellers were compelled to wait weeks
before they could be accommodated.</p>

<p>In the Rue Quincampoix grotesquely exaggerated rents were paid
for any booths wherein business might be transacted; a cobbler who
owned a stall there, found himself growing rich by letting it to
<i>agioteurs</i>; the hunchback Bombario, trading upon the
superstition that accounted it lucky to rub against his hump, hired
out his misshapen body and the hump itself as a writing pulpit upon
which transactions might be recorded in the street, and was reputed
by this means to have earned a hundred and fifty thousand livres in
a few days.</p>

<p>Trade flourished as never before. Reckless expenditure followed
inevitably upon the easy amassing of fortunes, and the merchants of
Paris, especially those who dealt in precious wares, in gold and
silver plate, in jewels which were being extensively imported from
England, and in costly fabrics, were enriching themselves by
dealings on a scale and at fabulous prices that had never existed
even in their dreams.</p>

<p>Coachbuilders and horse dealers could scarcely meet the demand
that assailed them, often from men who yesterday would have been
glad enough of shoe leather with which to go on foot.</p>

<p>Those with land to sell could obtain three and four times the
prices in which six months earlier they would have rejoiced. Routs
and balls, fêtes and junketings, fireworks and gaming engrossed
this jubilant and suddenly enriched people, noble and simple
alike.</p>

<p>Theatres, dance halls, restaurants and gaming houses were
thronged by folk with money to burn. The Opera was packed every
night from floor to ceiling and never had displayed such brilliance
of costumes and such glitter of jewels, whilst the enormous
increase of carriages in the streets rendered life perilous for
those who still went on foot.</p>

<p>The demand for labour had grown with this surge of affluence,
and because of the great influx from the provinces and from abroad,
which had increased by one-third the population of Paris, with a
consequent insufficiency of essentials to meet the swollen demand,
a rise in wages had followed.</p>

<p>The artisan who had been content with fifteen sous a day was now
earning sixty, and was, therefore, a jubilant supporter of Mr Law,
slow to perceive that since bread which had cost a sou for two
pounds was costing now four sous a pound, with other commodities
similarly augmented, his increased prosperity was no better than an
illusion.</p>

<p>For the purveyor of all this phenomenal opulence, the magician
whose genius had, by an avalanche of paper currency, lifted France
out of the slough of bankruptcy and want into this unprecedented
prosperity, there was almost deification. Whenever he rolled
through Paris in his superb coach, with its magnificent bays in
silver harness and a couple of footmen behind in his livery of
claret and silver, if men stopped short of genuflecting to him, at
least hats were swept off and cheers for him resounded such as had
seldom resounded for anyone under the rank of a king. If he showed
himself in the Rue Quincampoix a guard was necessary to hold off
the mob that might have crushed him to death out of sheer
worship.</p>

<p>Yet whilst outwardly imperturbable, urbane and splendidly
liberal to all, in his mind he was not quite easy. Himself a
gamester by careful calculation, he looked askance upon all these
inexpert gamesters who, without reckoning the odds or possessing
the ability to do so, plunged blindly and recklessly into
speculations for which that momentary inattention on his part had
supplied the impulse.</p>

<p>When presently the labouring classes came to understand that
their swollen wages no longer kept pace with the price of
necessities, swollen in their turn by the increase in wages, they
clamoured for still higher pay, which, being granted, was followed
again by still higher prices.</p>

<p>Observing this, the Laird of Lauriston realized the elusive
natural law--unperceived or else ignored by those who for their own
ends have sought the favour of the masses by inspiring claims to
higher pay--that the value of an individual in any community is a
relative value which no power on earth can change, and that
attempts to change it violently must be attended by direst
consequences.</p>

<p>He understood that to pay the individual more than that subtly
determined relative worth was merely to lower the purchasing power
of money, for it led inevitably to a readjustment of all other
values, so as to conform with the one that had been altered.</p>

<p>Realizing this, Mr Law perceived that he was now confronted with
a new and disquieting phenomenon, the phenomenon of inflation, for
which there was as yet no name. He perceived here the first sweeps
of a vicious spiral which he possessed no means of checking, and
the end of which was not to be foreseen in the artificial
circumstances which his system had created.</p>

<p>Then, too, the news from Louisiana, upon which his main hopes
were founded, continued to be anything but good, and so far but
little of its potential wealth had crossed the ocean. It was a
subject upon which the steady, sober William Law was being brought
to despair.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me, John, how and where we are to find a dividend
that will bear any relation to the price at which the stock is
standing?" His tone was irritable. "What will be happening when the
holders realize it?"</p>

<p>Mr Law preserved a wooden countenance. "You start at
shadows."</p>

<p>"Shadows is the very word, and devil a substance to cast
them."</p>

<p>"The men who buy at these inflated prices are expressing their
faith in the future. They perceive what you overlook: that whilst
the wealth of the Mississippi may be inexhaustible, time must be
allowed for the development of this young colony. Time must be
allowed between sowing and reaping. Let that be our motto. It
should enhearten the sober and perhaps restrain the reckless."</p>

<p>"You speak glibly of the reaping. Have you seen the last reports
from Duchamp?"</p>

<p>"I have. They were best put in the fire before others see them.
They're not for general consumption. We don't want a panic."</p>

<p>"You hope to postpone it?"</p>

<p>"I count upon averting it. All I need is time. Let me have that,
and the harvest will follow."</p>

<p>"Time!" William was moved to impatience. "Time! That is the cry
of every bankrupt, always praying desperately for the unexpected to
come to his rescue."</p>

<p>"Damn you for a pessimist," said Mr Law, but he smiled
indulgently. "Come, Will. Courage! A little faith!"</p>

<p>But William Law was out of faith that morning. "I seem to hear
King Philip II crying, 'Time and I are one.' But if you put your
trust in time, at least contrive that it be better employed by the
colonists than is now the case."</p>

<p>"Ay, there's something in that," Mr Law agreed. "I'll take
thought."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter 24 -- MURDER</h2>

<p>Early in the following year the easy-going Regent proclaimed an
amnesty for the Cellamare plotters, and whether touched or merely
amused by the letters of the Duchess of Maine, with their
professions of devotion and loyalty so oddly at variance with her
conduct, he restored her Grace to liberty and allowed her to make
her peace with him. This she found easier than making it with her
husband, who continued to blame her plotting for his
tribulations.</p>

<p>The Bastille opened its ponderous gates for the conspirators of
Sceaux, and with them came also the Count of Horn, released from
that duress, but still under the ban requiring him to keep himself
not less than fifty leagues from Court.</p>

<p>He re-entered the world practically without means, for he had
lived at his own charges in prison, and by denying himself no
luxuries had exhausted the moneys he had received from the Countess
before his arrest.</p>

<p>In the Rue d'Argenteuil he found her house closed, and he learnt
in the neighbourhood that Madame la Comtesse was in the Dordogne.
This by rendering still more desperately urgent his necessities,
deepened his hatred of Mr Law in whom he beheld the author of all
his woes.</p>

<p>As a result it happened that in the course of that chilly March
morning Colonel de Mille, whilst frugally breaking his fast on
bread and olives, a marinade of artichokes and a jug of <i>petit
vin</i>, was surprised by the advent of a rather dilapidated Count
of Horn. Not only was the young nobleman pallid and puffy from long
imprisonment, but his once elegant suit of biscuit-coloured satin
was crumpled and stained, his stockings soiled and his wig out of
curl.</p>

<p>Recovering from his astonishment the Colonel embraced him,
felicitated him upon his release, gave him a chair and the freedom
of his breakfast.</p>

<p>"I keep Lent, you see, like the good Christian that I am
not."</p>

<p>The Count eyed the olives and the artichokes, sniffed the wine
disdainfully, and professed himself without appetite.</p>

<p>"Money is my need," he announced. "I am going down to the
Dordogne to square accounts with Madame la Comtesse as soon as I've
squared them here with that rascally lover of hers. A settlement is
overdue. But as I've a soul to lose I'll see that they pay with
interest."</p>

<p>"That's laudable," said the Colonel, "provided you don't expect
me to finance the enterprise. No moment could be less propitious. I
may perhaps command ten louis, and you're welcome to the half of
it. But I doubt if that will take you as far as the Dordogne."</p>

<p>"You're laughing at me, I suppose," growled Horn.</p>

<p>"My child, I weep over you. And over myself. I'm a dried-up
source. Though, if I can't supply money, I can supply advice. Begin
with Lass by all means; but go about it in the proper manner. Put
your sword to his throat, and demand the return of your million.
He'll account his life cheap at the price. For what's a million to
that usurer? In these days he flings millions from the window for
all the world to catch."</p>

<p>"Damn your jests."</p>

<p>"It's a jest with the germ of earnest in it." The Colonel took a
pull at his wine, grimaced over its sourness, and wiped his coarse
lips. "On my honour it is what I should do in your place. It's the
only way to deal with a thief who enjoys that fellow's power. His
Majesty's Comptroller-General. That's where he's climbed whilst
you've been in gaol. You talk easily of squaring accounts with him.
Do you suppose you can call out a man of that eminence? Faith, my
way is the only way, and may God damn me but I'm so hard-driven
myself these days that if you take it I'll lend a hand for a share
in the plunder."</p>

<p>"Can you be mad enough to propose it seriously?"</p>

<p>"Sane enough. Though I confess it's nearer to purse cutting than
I've come yet in my evil days. It's perhaps not to be done just as
I suggested. That is merely the scheme in the raw. It needs
shaping. Let us consider."</p>

<p>They considered so effectively that on the following morning Mr
Law's secretary, Lacroix, placed before his master a letter which
occasioned him some thought.</p>

<p>McWhirter was with him at the time, having come from the Rue
Quincampoix for his daily orders. He had to announce the safe
arrival of a cargo of spices from the Indies which should prove
highly profitable, and a small parcel from China of bohea which
might be transhipped for sale in England where a beverage prepared
from that curious roasted herb was beginning to find favour with
the quality.</p>

<p>When all this was settled, Mr Law handed over the letter Lacroix
had brought him.</p>

<p>Signed "Duchatel," it announced that the writer was a holder of
five hundred shares in the India Company which circumstances were
compelling him to liquidate at once. For so large a parcel he could
not expect to command the full value of the day, and to cast it
upon the market must almost inevitably produce a fall in the price.
Also he had the best of personal reasons for not wishing it to be
known that he was the seller, for which reason also he confessed
that the name he gave did not disclose his real identity. Therefore
he offered these shares privately to Mr Law for an immediate
payment at the reduced price of seven million livres. If, as he
hoped, Mr Law was interested, and, in view of the secrecy desired
by the seller, would attend in person to make the purchase at noon
on Friday next at the Cerf Volant in the Rue Quincampoix, he would
be placing one of the noblest families in France under a profound
obligation.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!" said McWhirter when he had read. He went over the
letter a second time, more carefully. "Ay, ay!" he said again, and
looked up. "Will the shares be forgeries now?"</p>

<p>Mr Law shook his head. "In that case he would not wish to deal
with me personally. A broker would be more easily deceived."</p>

<p>"Ay. True enough. And what for would he wish to deal with you in
person?"</p>

<p>"He gives a reason: secrecy."</p>

<p>"To be sure. Ah well, then, there's a good half-million profit
for you."</p>

<p>"It's too much."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking the same. But there's no lack of fools in the
world."</p>

<p>"Nor of knaves," said Mr Law. "Still, we'll not cast away a
half-million on suspicion. You shall attend for me at the Flying
Stag, Angus. I'll give you a note to say that you're my man of
confidence, and that this gentleman may trust you in every way as
he would myself."</p>

<p>What de Mille had left out of his calculations was that in no
circumstances would a man of the Comptroller-General's present
consequence attend in person to transact an operation of this
nature.</p>

<p>Never doubting that the bait must bring Mr Law to the
appointment, the Colonel waited confidently in a room above-stairs,
accompanied by a rascal named Lestaing, who stood to him much as
he, himself, stood to the Count. Horn was not with them, since his
presence must at once have put Law upon his guard. He waited in the
adjoining room, to intervene only if it should become
necessary.</p>

<p>McWhirter presented himself punctually.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Duchatel?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Your servant, Monsieur le Baron." The Colonel bowed; but when
he had straightened himself, he stared. This man was almost as tall
as Law and affected the same type of black periwig. But that was
all the resemblance. "You are not Monsieur Lass," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"His deputy. This will explain." McWhirter proffered his
note.</p>

<p>The Colonel glanced over it. "I see." He considered for a
moment, and concluded that whilst this might not be Law, the money
was Law's, which was all that mattered. "Have you brought the
money?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have it here." The Scot tapped his bosom where it bulged.</p>

<p>In the next heartbeat the Colonel was upon him.</p>

<p>He had whipped a small but serviceable bludgeon from his pocket,
and as he stepped forward he aimed at McWhirter's head a blow that
must have stunned him had the Scot's reflexes been less prompt.
McWhirter swerved his head out of the line of the descending
weapon, which fell, instead, upon his shoulder, partly numbing
it.</p>

<p>Before de Mille could repeat the blow he found himself grappled
in so tight a hug that he was unable to use the bludgeon again.
Close-locked they swayed across the room, hurtling against a table,
which went over with such a thud and crash of the crockery standing
on it that it must have resounded through the house.</p>

<p>The Colonel tripped over one of the legs of it and went down
upon his back, with McWhirter on top of him, whilst in that
interlocked fall the bludgeon slipped from his fingers and rolled
beyond his reach. He now found a knee on his chest, pinning him to
the floor, and sinewy hands reaching for his throat.</p>

<p>"Lend a hand, Lestaing," he roared. "Lend a hand, damn you!"</p>

<p>But Lestaing had taken fright at the noise. He had pushed open
the lattice and was already astride the sill. Without heeding de
Mille's urgent cry, he lowered himself, hung a moment by his hands,
and then let himself drop to the yard and made off, to be seen no
more.</p>

<p>McWhirter's hands had found the Colonel's throat, whilst he
glared at him with one eye through the curls of a periwig that had
become displaced, and was covering half his face.</p>

<p>"Lie still, you thieving bandit, till the archers come for you,"
he growled, and to ensure obedience bumped the Colonel's head upon
the floor. "Lie still."</p>

<p>So much noise warned Horn that things were not going smoothly,
and brought him in a rush from the adjoining room. He beheld the
Colonel in distress under the knees of his opponent, whom he
supposed to be Law, for the displaced wig was acting as a mask.</p>

<p>At sight of the enemy whom he was there to despoil, apparently
in the act of strangling de Mille, all the Count's rancour boiled
up to rob him of his wits. As much to bring help to the Colonel as
to gratify his passion of hatred he acted upon blind instinct,
whipped out his sword and passed it from side to side through the
man's body.</p>

<p>The Scot went limp, and as the Colonel heaved him aside and rose
gasping for air and drenched in blood, McWhirter writhed and
coughed dreadfully for a moment before sinking to lie still and
prone upon the floor.</p>

<p>Standing over him, Horn snarled: "So, you dog, you are paid at
last." Then across the length of the body Horn and de Mille looked
at each other, their faces ghastly.</p>

<p>"You fool!" gasped the Colonel, with a hand on his heaving
chest. "You cursed fool! What have you done?"</p>

<p>Horn was grinning horribly. "I've saved your life," said he, to
whom the question seemed ungrateful.</p>

<p>"And you're waiting for me to thank you, I suppose. By God, let
us get out of this whilst we can and if we can, or we'll hang for
it."</p>

<p>He stooped to recover his hat from the floor, then lurched
across the room to depart. But a thunder of steps rumbling up the
stairs made him check and turn. "The window," he panted, and
started for it. Horn who was nearer to it was the first to throw a
leg over the sill. But not soon enough. The door was flung open,
and the landlord followed by three of his lads swept in.</p>

<p>One glance at the body prone in a puddle of blood upon the floor
was enough. Whilst two of them sprang across the room to seize the
Count before he could drop from the window, the other two laid
hands on de Mille, who was now too limp even to struggle.</p>

<p>In grasping the sill, Horn had lost his hold of the sword, with
which he might have offered a murderous resistance. Disarmed,
panting, distraught, he suffered himself tamely to be captured.</p>

<p>It was not until the archers were marching the pair away to the
prison of La Tournelle that Horn was to realize the full extent of
the catastrophe that had overtaken him. If he had left the Flying
Stag under arrest for murder, he had borne with him at least the
satisfaction of having made an end of the scoundrel who had robbed
him of his money and seduced his wife.</p>

<p>Upon that he would base his defence when he came to take his
trial; and considering the powerful enemies created for his
Majesty's Comptroller-General by his rise to power, the Count of
Horn should not want for friends to support him, to plead his
righteous cause, and to justify him. He could count upon such great
nobles as the Duke of Noailles, the Duke d'Aumont, the Marquis
d'Argenson and the whole body of the Parliament, and in the end of
it all he could already see himself hailed as the deliverer of
France from the evil thrall of a foreign adventurer, a Scottish
Jew.</p>

<p>It all became so clear and inevitable to him, that as he trudged
alongside of the hangdog de Mille, through the Rue de Venise into
the broader thoroughfare, he was in danger of exulting.</p>

<p>It was only when they were halfway down the Rue Saint-Martin
that this heroic dream was suddenly shattered. They had been thrust
aside by their guards to make way for a magnificent coach, drawn by
a pair of superb bays, and with footmen behind in claret and
silver. As it passed them the leather curtain was drawn aside, and
a long, stern, handsome face framed in a black periwig looked out
of the window.</p>

<p>It was the face of Mr Law--of Mr Law, whom the Count of Horn had
left dead in a pool of blood on the floor of a room above-stairs in
the Flying Stag--on his way to pay one of his occasional visits to
the Banque Royale in the Rue Quincampoix.</p>

<p>As the Comptroller-General's brilliant eyes, frowning inquiry,
rested for a moment on the prisoners under guard, the Count of Horn
felt his stomach turn over within him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>Chapter 25 -- THE WHEEL</h2>

<p>It was not as the saviour of a nation that the Count of Horn
took his trial with Colonel de Mille. The indictment pronounced
them just a couple of common thieves and murderers, and as thieves
and murderers both were sentenced to be broken alive upon the
wheel.</p>

<p>In counting upon dukes and peers to stand by him, at least, Horn
was not disappointed. And not only dukes and peers, but princes,
too, beginning with his own brother the Prince of Horn, came
pleading to the Regent. But all the plea the circumstances of his
conviction permitted was that he might be hanged or beheaded. Thus
it was sought to spare him the infamy of the wheel, an infamy that
must besmirch members of all his family, and so deeply in Germany,
where he had great connections, that for three generations none of
them might be admitted to any noble chapter or hold any office
under the State.</p>

<p>The Regent, deeply shocked by the outrage, displayed unusual
sternness and rigour, accounting it his duty to stand firm and
allow the law to take its course.</p>

<p>He quoted Corneille to the pleaders. "It is the crime that makes
the infamy," he answered them, "and not the scaffold."</p>

<p>He was reminded that Horn had once been in the circle of his own
intimates and that, in fact, he was actually a remote kinsman of
the Regent's.</p>

<p>"Very well," he answered. "I must bear my share of the
ignominy."</p>

<p>The Abbé Dubois and the Duke of Saint-Simon were exhorted to
employ on the condemned man's behalf their great influence with His
Highness. Dubois was too busy at the time preparing himself to be
received into holy orders, so that he might be installed Archbishop
of Cambrai, as a preliminary to receiving at last the coveted red
hat.</p>

<p>Saint-Simon, however, who was about to go into the country, to
spend Easter on his lands, tells us in his memoirs that he did
intercede, using every argument he knew, and that he actually wrung
a promise from the Regent that Horn should be spared the wheel, and
be beheaded instead.</p>

<p>But as after the Duke's departure there was no announcement of
any modification in the sentence, it was widely concluded that
other influences were at work against the doomed man.</p>

<p>It was recalled that Angus McWhirter was one of Law's chief
lieutenants, and also that there had been a long and bitter feud
between Law and Horn. Hence, and considering that Law's influence
with the Regent was paramount, it was not unnaturally
concluded--and there was no lack of those to encourage the
conclusion--that it was the Comptroller-General's counsel that
sustained an inflexibility so unusual in the easy-going Regent.</p>

<p>Appeals for intervention had been addressed to Law from every
quarter. Amongst the many who had sought him were the Prince de
Conti, who had last parted from him in anger and with injurious
terms, because of unsatisfied greed, the old Duc de Villeroy, who
had always been his enemy, and even d'Argenson, to whom he had
become detestable since the ruin of the anti-system and the
Marquis' loss of the Comptrollership.</p>

<p>To all of them, without entering into details, Mr Law replied
that finance and not justice was his department and that he would
account it an unpardonable presumption in himself to submit their
pleas to His Highness.</p>

<p>Villeroy, turning pale with anger under his rouge, had begged
that if Monsieur le Baron would not intervene in Horn's favour, at
least, he should abstain from intervening against him, whereupon Mr
Law had pulled the bell cord and requested a footman to escort
Monsieur le Maréchal-Duc to his coach.</p>

<p>D'Argenson, hectoring as was his nature, had stormed that
Monsieur le Baron was treading a dangerous path.</p>

<p>"I have endeavoured to make it clear," said Mr Law, always
urbane, "that in this matter I tread no path at all.''</p>

<p>"That is precisely what is dangerous," shouted the Marquis, and
stamped out.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Conti had similarly prophesied that Monsieur le
Baron would ruin himself if he did nothing to arrest the doom of
the Count of Horn.</p>

<p>"That should be a matter for regret to you, mon prince," said Mr
Law, thus by implication reminding the malicious little hunchback
of how richly he had profited by Mr Law's prosperity.</p>

<p>"Nay, sir--for rejoicing, if you persist in your aloofness."</p>

<p>In this manner those three who detested him, and now detested
him the more for having been under the necessity of appealing to
him, departed in a still deeper rancour because of what they
accounted the arrogance of a refusal that had lacerated their
overweening pride.</p>

<p>The last to seek him in this matter were Lord and Lady Stair.
Horn had been a close friend of theirs. It was they, in fact, who
had introduced him to Law's household. To strengthen themselves
they sought to enlist the aid of Catherine, and induced her to lend
it. She recalled her tender passages with the Count and was
disposed to condone his attempts upon her virtue, charitably and
femininely attributing them to the excessive ardours she had
aroused in him and had even encouraged until they became too
ardent.</p>

<p>Together the three sought Mr Law in his study, and when they
found him coldly unresponsive to their prayers, Lord Stair had
recourse to a crowning argument.</p>

<p>"My dear Law, it is being widely said that you have intervened
already, in a contrary sense; that Monsieur de Saint-Simon had
obtained a promise that Horn should be spared the wheel, but that
you have since persuaded His Highness to disregard it. That, my
friend, is not an imputation under which you can comfortably
lie."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Why not! You admit, then, that it is true."</p>

<p>"I do not. But if it were, who could blame me? The murdered man
was a valued friend and loyal servant. I should be doing poor
justice to his memory if I raised so much as a finger for the least
mitigation of the punishment of his assassin."</p>

<p>"That I can understand. But you do yourself no good service if
you permit the general belief to be confirmed by the
execution."</p>

<p>"A mere argument of expediency, my lord."</p>

<p>And then her ladyship made an unfortunate contribution to the
discussion. "Have you never killed a man, Mr Law?"</p>

<p>Mr Law's grey eyes were stern in a face whose natural pallor was
deepened by indignation. But his voice, if charged with bitter
irony, was level. "Is it possible that your ladyship insults me by
comparing an act of mine in the way of honour with a brutal murder
committed by a thief?"</p>

<p>Stair accounted it necessary to hasten to his wife's aid. "No,
no," he cried. "But when you charge Horn with being a thief you are
forgetting that he believed he was recovering his own, of which he
was under the impression--of course the mistaken impression--that
you had defrauded him?"</p>

<p>"Is that also to be laid to my charge?"</p>

<p>"You should not ignore that it might be. Horn was talkative. He
complained bitterly and widely."</p>

<p>"And because he was a liar and defamer as well as a thief and a
murderer, I am now to plead for him. Let me tell you something
which is not generally known, in which you may discover yet another
reason for my intervention. Horn believed that it was I, myself,
who had gone to the Flying Stag, whither he sought to lure me by a
letter in a false name. He came into the room only when McWhirter
and de Mille were struggling on the floor. He could not see
McWhirter's face because his wig had fallen across it. So that when
Horn passed his sword through McWhirter he believed that he was
passing it through me."</p>

<p>"Oh!" It was an outcry of horror from Catherine, who sprang to
her feet, her face suddenly white.</p>

<p>Mr Law turned to her. "You said?"</p>

<p>"Oh, John!" She was fiercely vehement. "You'll believe that if I
had known this I should never have joined Lord and Lady Stair to
plead with you. I should never even have brought them to you. Why
didn't you tell me?"</p>

<p>Mr Law stared at her for a moment, surprised by her vehemence.
Then he shrugged. "It is not important. I should not trouble to
mention it now but that his lordship constrains me."</p>

<p>Catherine sank to her chair again, a limp figure of distress,
whilst Lord Stair gravely inclined his head. "Of course, there is
no more to be said."</p>

<p>Lady Stair, however, would not yet accept defeat. Her pale, mean
eyes had glowed in contempt upon Catherine. Malice deepened her
ladyship's resemblance to a hen. "There is one fact you would be
wise to consider, Mr Law, for your own sake. The Count of Horn was
talkative, you say. So he was. And he told the world not only that
you had defrauded him, but that you had seduced his wife."</p>

<p>There was a low moan of horror from Catherine, whilst his
lordship threw up his hands in despair. But Lady Stair went
ruthlessly on: "When you say that he killed your agent, believing
him to be you, you say something which, if known, must be held to
extenuate the deed. It must be held a crime of passion, a thing
done, not in the course of a theft, as has been supposed, but to
vindicate his honour." On a queer note of triumph she flung out the
question: "Now will you think it worth while to use all your
influence with His Highness?"</p>

<p>There were beads of sweat on Mr Law's brow, along the line of
his wig. He drew a handkerchief from the pocket of his coat of
heavy, purple Indian satin, and passed it across his forehead. Yet
his voice still preserved its quiet level. "Your ladyship will
perceive that what I have just told you--of the mistake that Horn
made--is known to no one else. Your ladyship will hardly be
threatening to publish it unless I do as I am bidden?"</p>

<p>"Good God, no!" cried Stair. "How could my wife have such a
thought? You would insult her by supposing it. She only points out
to you what will be concluded if it transpires."</p>

<p>"It cannot transpire save from one or the other of you. And if
it should," he added, his eyes glittering upon Lord Stair, "I
should require a severe account of it."</p>

<p>The ambassador's face flushed scarlet. It was a moment before,
bowing stiffly, he answered. "Always and in all things at your
service, Mr Law."</p>

<p>He turned to his wife, now breathless in panic of the mischief
she had wrought. "Come, madam, we take our leave." He bowed again
coldly to Law and then to Catherine. "Madam, your humble
obedient."</p>

<p>When in frosty dignity they had departed, Catherine looked at
her husband through a blur of tears. He stood by his writing table,
deep in thought, a frown darkening his brow.</p>

<p>"John, was it true what that woman said?"</p>

<p>"What did she say? She merely repeated a falsehood put about by
that shameless man Horn."</p>

<p>"A falsehood?"</p>

<p>Because he scorned to lie to her, he answered: "As it happens.
Yet it might have been true and would have been true but that
Margaret would not have it so."</p>

<p>"Oh, John!" she cried.</p>

<p>He looked at her with his bitter smile. "What's to surprise you?
Yourself you believed it true. You taunted me with it when
suspicion was your only evidence. And why this wail of outraged
virtue? Have you nothing on your side with which to reproach
yourself? Or is it possible that you still do not realize how much?
Trace all this mischief to its source. Or don't you know where to
find it? Then I will tell you.</p>

<p>"Knowing Horn's evil repute you encouraged his gallantries.
Against my wishes you went to Sceaux in order to afford him
opportunities, and but that his Countess watched over you, it is
likely that you would have succumbed."</p>

<p>Fiercely she broke in. "Did Margaret Ogilvy say so? Did she tell
you that?"</p>

<p>"Where was the need? Yourself you told me, when on your return
from Sceaux you said that you never wished to see the Count of Horn
again. Whether you have seen him since or not you will know better
than I. I have not spied upon you."</p>

<p>Again she interrupted fiercely. "Because you did not care. Do
you make a virtue of it?"</p>

<p>He paid no heed, but went relentlessly on, "Your laudable
resolve not to see Horn again was taken too late, the harm was
already done. It happened earlier, when the flagrancy of his
pursuit of you and your encouragement of it were giving rise to
scandal.</p>

<p>"With the innuendoes of Lady Stair in my ears I thought it time
to take steps to protect my honour. I requested him to cease
attentions to you which were becoming too assiduous. You will
recall that he attempted to strike me, and taking the will for the
deed I demanded the ordinary satisfaction that obtains between
gentlemen. He refused it with fresh insult. But I happened to have
other weapons for this needy gallant, this <i>canaille</i>, whom I
had put in the way of fortune; and whilst he was making love to you
at Sceaux I broke him.</p>

<p>"After that he was driven by vindictiveness upon his doom. First
he allied himself with my enemies, then, when that failed him, he
set a trap for me into which poor Angus went to be murdered. And
now I am warned that unless on Tuesday he is spared the wheel, I
shall be charged with basest motives for having urged the Regent to
show no mercy."</p>

<p>His bitter laugh cut her like a whip. "Do you begin to see,
Catherine, the havoc your easy smiles have wrought?"</p>

<p>She was rocking herself in anguish, her hands locked between her
knees. "I thought you did not care," she wailed. "That is what
drove me, goaded me. If you had cared, John, do you suppose any
other man would have had those smiles? Those smiles that you call
easy?"</p>

<p>"You are my wife. You bear my name. You are the mother of my
children."</p>

<p>"Have you always remembered that, John?" She asked the question
plaintively.</p>

<p>"Always, though never given credit for it. Always, though
constantly charged with imagined infidelities. Always until lately,
when temptation snapped the bond of duty your levity had worn thin.
However, as I've said, to that temptation it was denied me to
succumb.''</p>

<p>"For that, at least, I suppose I may thank God," she cried.</p>

<p>"And Margaret Ogilvy," said he, as he sat down at his writing
table. "It was the virtue of this woman you miscall that made the
barrier."</p>

<p>She sat for a moment miserably considering, then spoke very
quietly. "At least you have been honest with me, John, and I owe it
to you to be honest in my turn. When I suspected--when you gave me
cause to suspect your relations with the Countess of Horn, I sought
the Count again. I deliberately used his...his interest in me, in
the hope of forming an alliance with him, so that he might place
his wife beyond your reach. I was desperate...desperate to save us
both, John. Can you understand?" Without waiting for his answer,
she went miserably on to make a full avowal of her aborted
association with Horn.</p>

<p>Whilst his countenance remained impassive, yet, despite himself,
his heart was touched by a confession which but for his
preconceptions might well have vouchsafed him more than a glimpse
of the true state of her feelings for him beneath their habitually
shrewish surface. For a spell when the tale was told there was
silence between them, save for the quiet weeping of the woman
huddled miserably in her chair.</p>

<p>When at last he spoke again it was very gently. "Dry your tears,
Catherine. What is done is done, and it shall never again be
mentioned by me. I accept my part of the blame. Do not imagine that
I don't perceive it, and how much we are both of us the sport of
destiny."</p>

<p>She roused herself to look at him. He sat erect, staring sternly
before him, his hands gripping the arms of his chair. She was all
humility. "You can be generous, John. More generous perhaps than I
deserve. But what now?"</p>

<p>"Now?"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Do? Why, nothing."</p>

<p>"But you must. You know that woman Lady Stair. You know her
malice. Do you think it will allow her to keep silent, that she'll
not tell the world that McWhirter was killed in your place? Hasn't
she warned you of what would then be believed? Oh, why, why did you
tell them?"</p>

<p>"It was a folly, I confess. I perceived my error as soon as the
words were out. But I was hard driven, as you saw."</p>

<p>"If it were put about that the Count of Horn thought he was
killing his wife's lover, that would partly rehabilitate him as she
said."</p>

<p>"Does it matter? He is naught."</p>

<p>"My God, don't I know it? Am I thinking of him? I am thinking of
you, John. His rehabilitation will be at your expense. Don't you
see?"</p>

<p>"I see," he said. But what he suddenly saw was that it would
also be at the expense of Margaret's good name.</p>

<p>"Then you will go to the Regent?"</p>

<p>"It will be better," he said, his tone flat and dull. "Yes. I
will go." He rose. "I will tell Laguyon to order my carriage."</p>

<p>In passing, he paused, looking down upon her, touched by an
anxiety for him, of which he had long since ceased to believe her
capable. Meeting her raised, piteous glance, he smiled wistfully,
and his fingers lightly touched her dark brown head. "Poor
Catherine," he said, and sighed. "Fate has had great sport with us
both."</p>

<p>She swung round in eagerness to answer him; but he was gone
before she could find words, and it was late when he returned, to
discover her waiting in a fever of impatience. His dark look
proclaimed his failure before he spoke.</p>

<p>"A wasted effort," he announced. "I have never known His
Highness so hard. There is no obstinacy like the obstinacy of a
weak man. He would scarcely listen to me. For once he was in a mood
of nobility. 'It is being said already,' he told me, 'that in this
realm there is one law for the noble and another for the
simple.</p>

<p>"'It shall not be said in the case of a brutal murder by a
vulgar thief.'</p>

<p>"I did not leave it there. I told him that I begged leniency for
my own sake. I told him that it was being bruited that out of
vindictiveness it was I who was urging His Highness to this
severity. He was angrily ironical. 'We shall bear the blame
together, then. You should be happy in the association.' And that
was his last word."</p>

<p>On the following Tuesday--the Tuesday of Easter Week--in the
Place de Grève, the high-born Count of Horn and Colonel de Mille
suffered the dreadful, brutal punishment of being broken alive upon
the wheel.</p>

<p>On the day after that, as the Regent drove through the streets
of Paris, he was greeted by acclamations of a fervour he had never
yet known.</p>

<p>For his stern undiscriminating justice the populace hailed him
as its protector. It was being said--according to the Regent's
German mother--that however lenient His Highness might be towards
offenders against himself, he forgave nothing that was done against
a subject.</p>

<p>Mr Law sneered when it was reported to him. "He will now account
himself justified of his severity."</p>

<p>But when later in the day Mr Law himself drove forth, he was
shocked to find himself the object of similar demonstrations of
respect and affection, and he took shame in the thought that it
sprang from the belief that the Regent's severity was largely due
to his advocacy.</p>

<p>Again he sneered as he spoke to his brother who rode with him,
"He said that we should share the blame. Meanwhile we share the
plaudits. And, faith, one is as distasteful as the other."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter 26 -- FAREWELL</h2>

<p>Arising out of all this, a queer mood of disgust with all things
was still upon John Law when, a week or so later, he learnt that
Margaret was again in Paris.</p>

<p>He was perhaps justified in accounting it no less than a duty to
present himself at the house in the Rue d'Argenteuil; but it is not
to be pretended that inclination had no part in it.</p>

<p>On this occasion there was neither porter nor footman to admit
him. He was conducted by the Countess of Horn's maitre d'hotel
through a house enshrouded as if it were untenanted. Only the
boudoir, where he was again received, had been cleared of its
mantlings and was gay as of old with its damask and its
lacquers.</p>

<p>There Margaret came to him, straight and lissom in her black, a
mourning assumed out of regard for the circumstances rather than
for the actual dead.</p>

<p>"I thought that you might come," she said, with a wan smile, and
put forth her hand.</p>

<p>He bowed over it and bore it to his lips. "Did you hope it?" he
asked.</p>

<p>She gave him a slow, searching look before replying. "I scarcely
know. All this has distracted me so much that my senses are a
little numbed."</p>

<p>They sat down, with half the room between them. "I am merely
passing through Paris," she informed him. "Pausing only to set
affairs in order. Naturally I shall not now stay in France. The
name of Horn has been made too infamous." She paused before adding:
"In all this miserable affair the only ray of light for me is your
escape from the fate that man intended for you."</p>

<p>The words took him by surprise. His long face became grim. "I
see that Lady Stair has lost no time."</p>

<p>"She came this morning to condole with me."</p>

<p>"And to bring you matter calling for still deeper
condolence."</p>

<p>"She told me that it is widely known that you persuaded the
Regent to show the Count no mercy."</p>

<p>"That was kind of her. Did you believe it?"</p>

<p>"That you so persuaded the Regent?" She smiled with tight lips.
"No. I happen to know you, John."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Margaret. It is as well that you should learn the
actual truth. I all but embroiled myself with His Highness by
pleading with him to be lenient."</p>

<p>She opened wide her lovely eyes. "That, in all the
circumstances, is more, far more than was to be expected."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "It was proper that I should think of you and of
the danger of this thing which Lady Stair has told you is widely
known. I feared that if I sat still, your name might come to be
smirched together with mine. As it is, unless her ladyship's tongue
is bridled it may yet happen."</p>

<p>"You mean that men will say you were my lover, and that the
Count of Horn's real purpose was to kill you so as to avenge his
honour. It is a half-truth and might so easily have been a whole
one. But for me it is no matter." Her tone was listless. "I am
going out of it all, away, home to England."</p>

<p>"Is the decision irrevocable?"</p>

<p>"Do you know a better?"</p>

<p>He had thought he did; a nebulous thought that had brought him
to her. But now her steady questioning glance served to clear his
mind and spread reality before him. He had known that she could not
remain in France; he had dimly considered that she was now free
and, as he conceived, alone and defenceless, whilst, himself, in
his present revulsion and for her sake, ready to abandon all that
he had so laboriously built.</p>

<p>It had been vaguely in his mind that they might go together, to
Italy or Spain or Holland, and together at last attempt to
re-fashion their lives. But her eloquent almost challenging eyes
told him all that had been obscured from his distorted perceptions,
reminded him that he had nothing to offer save that which she had
already firmly rejected, made him understand that their
circumstances were nowise altered by Horn's death, as at a
superficial glance it had seemed, or, if altered, were altered only
by the erection of a fresh barrier.</p>

<p>As if she read his mind, this is what she told him when
presently she spoke.</p>

<p>"I wonder, John, if the world has known a story more ironical
than ours. 'The very events that have removed the obstacles between
us have replaced them by chasms that may not be crossed."</p>

<p>"If it were not for Catherine," he said, "I could build a
bridge."</p>

<p>"A bridge across two graves." Sadly smiling, she shook her head.
"Do not deceive yourself. To do so merely sharpens torment, denies
you peace. One of my husbands died by your hand, the other for his
association with you. Even if you were now free to marry, how
should we dare? We should be constrained to live in hiding,
shunned, aware of the contempt that would everywhere be ours, and
living thus we might come in the end to hate each other. Take the
thought of that, if not as a balm, at least as a cautery for your
wounds. I should be on my knees to you, John, for pardon, for
having come again into your life to unsettle it, if I had not the
excuse that I came to rescue you when you were in danger."</p>

<p>"That you came I shall never regret," he cried, "whatever the
present pain. It brought me to knowledge of your great sacrifice,
it restored to me the reverence in which once I held you, and the
loss of which left me without reverence for anything. For that, at
least, I am thankful."</p>

<p>"Then keep the thought of it to sweeten your memory of me, as my
memory of you will be sweetened by that assurance. Seek happiness
in Catherine, John, for I know that Catherine loves you and for me
that knowledge would be a barrier if there were no other. For,
believe me, there is no happiness to be built upon another's
sorrow."</p>

<p>"Catherine!" he cried, in repudiation. "Should I have come to
you as I did a year ago if I believed it? Catherine loves herself
too well to have any love to spare. Of me she loves no more than
the splendours I provide her. I cannot think that if misfortune
overtook me I should find Catherine at my side."</p>

<p>"I wonder if you are not mistaken. In my heart and from what I
saw at Sceaux I believe you are. But even if I should be wrong, you
have still your children. Find your happiness in them, as I hope to
find mine in my son. He will always remind me of you, for it was
for your sake I got him. And now, dear love, it must be farewell
between us. You were born to be fortunate, as I was born to be gay.
Do not be false to your nature as fate has made me false to
mine."</p>

<p>He realized that this was the irrevocable end. There was no more
to say.</p>

<p>For the last time, and for a moment only, he held her in his
arms. Then he went forth to meet the storm of which the first
unsuspected clouds were gathering.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter 27 -- MUTTERINGS OF THE
STORM</h2>

<p>Whilst the people who had acclaimed Mr Law for his princely
liberality and for the prosperity which he had brought to their
humble ranks, were acclaiming him more loudly still for what they
believed to have been his part in the justice done upon the Count
of Horn, the quality began to look askance upon him for the same
reason.</p>

<p>Whilst artisans and others, whose daily earnings had by now been
quintupled by the grace of John Law, were doffing their hats when
he passed and shouting "Long live Monsieur Lass," the nobles, many
of them enriched by him, were beginning to mutter his name with
execration.</p>

<p>However much Horn, in their eyes, may have merited death, yet
they began to tell one another that it was time to look to their
privileges when a foreign adventurer usurped a power that could
insist upon the infamy which had attended Horn's execution. For
this was the tale, sedulously disseminated by the vindictive
d'Argenson, and soon to take the still uglier shape that Horn had
been wrongly convicted; that he was not the thieving murderer he
had been represented, but an avenging husband whose misfortune it
had been to mistake his man.</p>

<p>It was his friend the Duke of Antin who brought Mr Law the
warning that this tale was spreading.</p>

<p>"Of course I know it for a foul lie," said his Grace. "But how
to prove it? The world loves a foul lie, and the fouler it is, the
better it loves it."</p>

<p>D'Antin had the rare experience of beholding the imperturbable
Mr Law livid with anger. "The truth was proved at the trial. And
here is the evidence." He sought and produced from amongst his
papers the Duchatel letter.</p>

<p>"Conclusive enough, in all faith," the Duke agreed. "What can be
done to make it known, I'll do. But slander is of rank and hardy
growth."</p>

<p>"I am aware of the source of it," said Mr Law. "But, of course,
it is too late to seal it up."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he went off to the British Embassy, demanded to
see Lord Stair, and made his plaint in uncompromising terms.</p>

<p>"This abominable tale, my lord, is a mean return for the profit
you have had from me so as to repair your down-at-heel
circumstances. I warned your lordship that if this thing were put
about I should require a strict account of you."</p>

<p>They faced each other across Stair's writing table, the tall
Scot and the short one. The ambassador strove with his dignity. His
face was white, his prominent eyes bulging with wrath. He spoke
stiltedly. "I resent your terms, sir. Yet I'll condescend to assure
you that the rumour is not of my circulating."</p>

<p>"Will you condescend to assure me that it is not of your wife's?
Or do you take shelter behind her ladyship's petticoats? If you
deny that between you you are responsible for the slander, I shall
give you the lie. For by my own indiscretion, it was known only to
you that McWhirter was mistaken for me."</p>

<p>Stair's livid face, attempting a lofty smile, achieved a
death's-head grin. "You will have the decency, sir, to remember my
office here, and that it precludes me from asking
satisfaction."</p>

<p>"The Count of Horn took some such tone with me when I required
him to cease his attentions to my wife. I broke him for it, as I
shall break you, my lord."</p>

<p>"Break me!" gasped his lordship, and laughed in derisive
anger.</p>

<p>But Mr Law had already turned on his heel and was striding from
the room.</p>

<p>He went straight to the Palais Royal and Dubois. He urged his
demands peremptorily. "Monsieur l'Abbé, that man Stair is
circulating a lie that hurts my honour."</p>

<p>The Abbé looked up at him, startled by the absence from his tone
of its normal urbanity. "And what, pray, can I do about it?"</p>

<p>"If nothing suggests itself, I'll tell you. He denies me
satisfaction, sheltering himself behind his office. Strip him of
it."</p>

<p>"Strip him of it? In God's name, how can I do that?"</p>

<p>"How? Are you not Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs?
Require Lord Stanhope to recall him."</p>

<p>"God save us!" Dubois was appalled. "What are you asking? You
know there are limits..."</p>

<p>"There are none. You are slow to understand. These slanders may
endanger me, and I am not to be endangered. I carry on my back the
whole burden of the finances of France, like Atlas shouldering the
world. If through the malice of that man I am made to stumble,
there will be chaos. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>The Abbé scratched his fulvid head, sucked in his hollow cheeks.
"But you are asking for extreme measures, Monsieur Atlas."</p>

<p>"No less. You'll take them, or you may never get to Cambrai, and
there'll be no red hat for you."</p>

<p>"And now, God forgive you, I believe you are threatening
me."</p>

<p>"No. I'm warning you. Or shall I ask His Highness to do it?"</p>

<p>"But no, but no," the Abbé soothed him. "You'll understand, at
least, that I could not take such a step without the Regent's
authority."</p>

<p>"For that all you need do is to explain the gravity of the case.
His Highness doesn't want to see the finances in confusion, as they
will be if I am overthrown by a campaign of slander. So make it
clear to him. If necessary let him know that either Stair goes or I
resign the Comptrollership. But you'll find that so much will not
be necessary. Good day to you, Monsieur l'Abbé."</p>

<p>He stalked out, and Dubois went quavering to the Regent.</p>

<p>"I should never have believed that Monsieur Lass could be so
violent," he lamented, in delivering his message.</p>

<p>It took effect the more readily because His Highness had no
affection for the ambassador, and a courier set out that very day
to inform Lord Stanhope that the Earl of Stair was no longer
<i>persona grata</i> at the Court of France. Privately, Lord
Stanhope was acquainted by Dubois with the fact that Stair had
become obnoxious to Mr Law. It was enough. For such by then was
Europe's view of the financial preponderance acquired by France and
such the respect for its architect that no foreign government
accounted it prudent to incur the Comptroller-General's
displeasure.</p>

<p>Within the week the Earl of Stair had the mortification of being
recalled and the further mortification of knowing whence the blow
descended. He made what mischief he could whilst packing his bags,
and let it be widely known by whose agency he was being sent home
in disgrace.</p>

<p>Although there was little love for him, and, as the Regent's
mother wrote, the Regent was glad to be rid of him, yet his recall
served, as he reckoned, to deepen in Court circles the growing
resentment of the pride and power of a Scotsman, so swollen that he
could break ambassadors at his will. Law became the more detested,
because it was now perceived how much he was to be feared, and this
detestation began to study ways to sap the ground under his
feet.</p>

<p>The Regent, aware of that wave of weighty hostility against his
Comptroller, threw all his prestige into the scales against it,
honouring Law in public on every occasion, and showing himself
frequently with him in his box at the Opera. If, as a consequence,
none dared to display open incivility, yet the campaign against him
was preparing underground, led by his whilom friend and now
bitterest enemy, the dispossessed d'Argenson.</p>

<p>The Marquis' shrewdness perceived that vast and imposing though
the financial edifice of Mr Law's construction might be, the frenzy
of speculation had rendered it top heavy. This frenzy continuing,
the shares of the India Company had reached by now the monstrous
price of twenty thousand livres, which was forty times their issued
value.</p>

<p>Just as this nourished the hostile hopes of d'Argenson and his
associates, so it renewed the fears of the prudent William Law.
Armed with a sheet of figures, he sought his brother on a day of
spring, a little while after Stair's recall, the day on which the
shares had reached that phenomenal level.</p>

<p>"I've brought you a statement for the year, John, which you
should study. It shows a profit on overseas trading of seventeen
millions, with another seven millions from benefits on tobacco,
salt and minting. Add to this sixty-three millions between interest
on the national debt and profit on the tax farms, and you have a
total revenue of some eighty millions. This might provide a
dividend of five per centum on the capital for which the shares in
the India Company were originally issued. Will you tell me what is
the imperceptible fraction of that available for the ten milliards
which is the present capital value of the stock?"</p>

<p>Mr Law studied the sheet cursorily, and tossed it back. "You are
telling me that for a reasonable interest on that capital we
require four or five hundred millions, whereas at present we
possess but eighty. That is merely to renew the old arguments."</p>

<p>"Do you know of any fresh ones?"</p>

<p>"As I've told you before, those who buy at these prices must
understand what are the present resources. They are easily
computed. It follows, then, that they buy for the sake of future
profits from the colonies when developed."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, when developed. But when will they be developed to the
extent of offering an adequate return on a capital value such as
this? You promised to take order about the colonists of Louisiana.
But nothing's done. Every report shows that native labour is
proving useless without proper direction, whilst the white
population is composed of wastrels who will not work. The riches on
which you count remain locked in the soil."</p>

<p>"I've not overlooked it. In fact, I've prepared a plan, and have
waited only until I could persuade the Regent to let me adopt
it."</p>

<p>He disclosed it. It was a plan clearly inspired by the system of
press gangs that obtained in England for the navy. Now that he
possessed the Regent's authority he would apply it in France, so as
to populate the colonies.</p>

<p>He would see Le Blanc, the present Lieutenant-General of Police,
and decree a round-up of all useless idlers, gaol birds, thieves,
able-bodied beggars, vagabonds, prostitutes and the like, and ship
them out to find an honest outlet for their activities on the
Mississippi plantations. Thus he would give those wretches the
chance of a fresh start in life, whilst cleansing France of their
undesirable presence and enriching her by the fruits of their
labours in the New World.</p>

<p>It dissipated some of William's gloom. "I like it fine. I'll
allow it's a canny notion." Then with a return of his misgivings,
"I would you had thought of it earlier," he grumbled. "If you had
had the notion two years ago, we might be garnering the fruits by
now. As it is...what if overblown faith should turn to panic? Have
you thought of that?"</p>

<p>"It has never been out of my reckonings since those crazy
speculators got to work to drive the price to these wild
levels."</p>

<p>"Can you provide for it?"</p>

<p>Mr Law shrugged irritably. "They say I work miracles. But, after
all, I am not God. I can only hope that they will possess
themselves in patience until shipments from Louisiana bring us that
abundance. Meanwhile, we'll do as we can. A little judicious
manipulation of the market, by making gambling easier, may keep
them entertained."</p>

<p>"Do you sleep o' nights, John?"</p>

<p>"Peacefully."</p>

<p>"Ay, ye've the gamester's temperament. Would God I shared it. I
might sleep easier myself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps my handling of the stock will help you."</p>

<p>Craftily he went about it. He brought down prices by apparently
forced liquidations which compelled weak holders to sell, and then
allowed them to rebound, only to drive them down once more. These
fluctuations rendered speculation wilder than ever, but, thus
deliberately encouraged, they achieved the immediate object of
distracting attention from the lack of dividends by supplying quick
gains for the fortunate operators.</p>

<p>But whilst Law gave his attention to this pumping so as to keep
the ship afloat until harbour should be reached, d'Argenson went
about intensifying the storm by which he hoped to wreck it.</p>

<p>He decided to open his campaign with an attack upon Law's paper
money. He computed that the banknotes in circulation represented
some two thousand five hundred millions, which was three times the
value of France's minted gold. This grossly excessive paper
currency, which rendered Law's position extremely vulnerable,
resulted from the original omission to provide that only
bondholders of the national debt should have the right to subscribe
for the respective issue of the India Company stock.</p>

<p>As a consequence, by the time a great many of them had been paid
off in notes, they were unable to acquire shares unless prepared to
pay the inflated prices demanded by the speculators who had
snatched them up. Out of reluctance to do this they had clung to
their banknotes, so that these had not come to the India Company to
be cancelled as was projected, but remained to swell to a dangerous
extent the circulation.</p>

<p>Quietly at first, but sedulously, d'Argenson's agents spread the
tale that Law was depositing for himself abroad large quantities of
the French gold he had obtained in exchange for worthless paper.
Alarm spread quickly and a run on the bank for specie was led by
the Prince de Conti, who by the favour of Mr Law had amassed an
enormous fortune.</p>

<p>In order to turn his paper into coin the Prince came to the Rue
Quincampoix ostentatiously with three wagons, upon which he loaded
the gold and the silver which he drew from the Bank. The effect of
this spectacular action was to spread the general alarm upon which
de Conti reckoned. The share market was suddenly paralysed, and the
operators fell into queues to besiege the Bank with their demands
for specie.</p>

<p>For a moment it looked as if this avalanche must sweep away Mr
Law and his system. But the public had to deal with absolute power
which could be yielded with unscrupulous skill, and Mr Law was
prompt to wield it. By an immediate edict he officially depreciated
specie in contrast with paper, by one tenth, and he was prepared,
if necessary, to depreciate it further.</p>

<p>It was not necessary. In counter-panic the run ceased abruptly.
Those who had queued to withdraw their gold, now queued as
impetuously to return it.</p>

<p>At Mr Law's instances the Prince de Conti was severely
reprimanded by the Regent and all but threatened with impeachment
for his part in a conspiracy which might seriously have imperilled
the finances of the State. Peremptorily he was ordered to return at
least two-thirds of this specie to the Bank.</p>

<p>The position being restored, and in order to prevent a
repetition, a further edict was promulgated delimiting the amount
of specie to be possessed by any private person, completely
forbidding its exportation, and restricting its use in trade to
small payments only. At the same time an injunction was placed upon
the manufacture of plate and articles of gold and silver beyond a
certain weight.</p>

<p>It was one of those desperate measures of compulsion which
governments in difficulties have occasionally adopted, and which,
of whatever immediate result have never ended otherwise than in
disaster. Its effect now was to sow disquiet in the public mind. Of
this, d'Argenson, foiled in his first assault, took advantage to
attack in another quarter. This time it was against the India
Company that he unmasked his batteries.</p>

<p>Operations happened to be favoured for him by a spreading
scandal resulting from the activities of Mr Law's press gangs,
which by now were operating throughout France. The measure, wise
and provident in itself, if belatedly adopted, was being grossly
ill-conducted.</p>

<p>The men charged with the impressments, and commonly known by now
as the Bandoleers of the Mississippi, were executing them with a
brutality that shocked the country. The fundamental dishonesty so
commonly displayed by underlings in the exercise of government
authority, especially in the case of coercive measures, was
actively at work.</p>

<p>By the peculation of those responsible, hordes of unfortunates
of both sexes, carted to Bordeaux for shipment, were left on the
way without proper nourishment or shelter, so that many of them
perished miserably.</p>

<p>The survivors were embarked in overcrowded floating hells to be
further decimated by disease and death, whilst those hardy enough
to reach Louisiana alive, instead of labouring, were soon pursuing
in the New World the activities which had made them infamous in the
Old. And even this inhumanity was not the worst of it.</p>

<p>The Bandoleers of the Mississippi were not slow to perceive in
their functions the opportunity for further and still more
remunerative corrupt practices. They no longer confined their
impressments to rogues and vagabonds. Many a respectable citizen
found himself caught up in that infamous net to the end that he
might ransom himself by payment.</p>

<p>The knowledge of these abominations spread rapidly, and the
blame for them was assigned to Law at the prompting of his enemies.
The mutterings of a storm of execration swelled up and at last
broke upon him. Instead of the acclamations to which he had become
accustomed on his public appearances, he was greeted now by
obloquy, and more than once his carriage was pelted with filth and
stones.</p>

<p>As indomitable in the face of this as he had been imperturbable
in the face of plaudits, he took immediate steps to put an end to
the abuses. The press gangs were abolished, and agents were
dispatched to Germany, Italy and Switzerland, to recruit
industrious labour of experience on the land with the offer of two
hundred and eighty acres in Louisiana free of all rent and imposts
for three years.</p>

<p>Even the gloomy William admitted the excellence of this measure,
if not one that could ease the battle against time which must be
more strenuously joined than ever now that the activities of
d'Argenson were becoming apparent.</p>

<p>The Marquis was rendering the public conscious of the
ludicrously inflated value of the India Company stock, with the
assertion, which it was now impossible to contradict, that it would
be many years before any return might be expected, if indeed ever,
considering the scandalous failure of the colonizing
experiments.</p>

<p>He reminded the world of the high rate of interest he had paid
on the stock of the anti-system, which Mr Law had crushed and
replaced by a stock that bore no fruit at all. He and his friends
eloquently advocated those who held these fictitious values should
convert them into stable ones: houses, land, jewels and the
like.</p>

<p>The eloquence did its work. The confidence already shaken by the
enforced measures, was shaken further by that insidious advocacy,
and holders of the stock began to realize. Gathering momentum, the
realization came to sweep the Rue Quincampoix like a wind of
catastrophe, bringing about a rapid fall in the price of the
shares.</p>

<p>When they had dropped from twenty to twelve thousand livres,
William Law beheld in this the beginning of the verification of
those fears which had been his ever since his brother had extended
his operations from banking to the monopoly and direction of the
nation's commerce. He adjured his brother, at least, to save the
Bank by sacrificing the Company.</p>

<p>"The Bank," he contended, "is built on solid foundations, and
can withstand these seas tossed by speculation. Let the gamblers of
the India Company take their chance. If they lose, they can blame
only their own rashness."</p>

<p>The advice was sound; but Law faced with these malign influences
was no longer the cool gamester of former days. Anger and anxiety
robbed him of his clarity of vision, dulled his gift of unerring
calculation.</p>

<p>The man who had thriven by studying why others lose and by his
accurate estimation of the odds, was made as reckless as the
commonest punter, and, like the commonest punter, practised a
desperate tenacity in the face of this adverse fall of the cards.
So it was with something of defiance that he rejected his brother's
advice and chose, instead, to have recourse to expedients.</p>

<p>Greatly daring, he made an ostentatious appearance on foot in
the Rue Quincampoix, arrayed in the robes of his office of
Comptroller-General and attended by a brilliant retinue of nobles,
which included the Duke of Antin and the young Duke of Bourbon.</p>

<p>The odium visited upon him as a result of the operations of the
press gangs had faded by now from the public memory, so notoriously
short, and his appearance in the panoply of his high estate,
handsome, serene and masterful, became the occasion of a
demonstration above all his expectations. D'Argenson, who had hoped
that he would be beaten to death for his daring, might gnash his
teeth in disappointment.</p>

<p>He paused in an almost royal progress to greet some of the more
prominent <i>agioteurs</i> and hold them in talk. Airily he
announced that very soon the Regent would be promulgating fresh
edicts of great advantage to the Company. Further profitable
properties, he assured them, were shortly to be added to its
already vast possessions, whilst the new colonists setting out for
Louisiana were industrious men chosen for their expertness in
cultivation. Although an immediate yield was naturally not to be
expected, the India Company's foundations were too sound to leave
in the discerning any doubts of its ultimate success. The fall in
values could, therefore, be no more than a passing phase, and those
deluded men whose timidity had produced it would soon have reason
for regrets.</p>

<p>Remembering that his every forecast, even when most derided, had
never failed to be fulfilled, his words were attended by a revival
of confidence and a recovery began at once.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter 28 -- CATASTROPHE</h2>

<p>Coming home from that triumph in the Rue Quincampoix, Mr Law
found Catherine awaiting him in a fever. At sight of him, serene,
if faintly flushed, she ran to meet him with something between a
laugh and a sob.</p>

<p>William was with her, and no whit less anxious. Both spoke at
once.</p>

<p>"Thank God you are safe, John."</p>

<p>"Safe?" He smiled, a little quizzically, upon this breathless
solicitude. "Why, what was to be feared? Of course I am safe, and
so, too, I think," he added, with a glance at William, "is the
India Company. Before I left the Rue Quincampoix to the old cry of
<i>Vive Monsieur Lass</i>, the stock was already rising again."</p>

<p>"You'll want to talk to Will," said Catherine. "I'll leave you
now that I know that all is well with you. But I'll come back when
he has gone."</p>

<p>He watched her from the room, his smile enigmatic.</p>

<p>The anxiety for him which she betrayed supplied a climax to a
change that had been apparent in her ever since that talk of theirs
following upon the last visit of Lord and Lady Stair. Penitence for
her unwitting part in the events which had aroused the hostility
against him and perhaps the assurances he had given her, had served
to soften her. Her shrewishness had melted into a humility by which
she sought to make amends.</p>

<p>"We grow considerate," he said, as the door closed upon her.</p>

<p>William's manner was a reproof in itself. "All morning the poor
soul has been in hell for you, John. She was like a wild thing when
she learnt where you had gone and the risk to which you might be
exposed. She was bitter with me for having let you go, as if I or
anyone under God could ever hold you back."</p>

<p>"Fearing, I suppose, what d'Argenson was praying for: that I
should be torn in pieces."</p>

<p>The kindly William was reproachful. "Are you sure that you don't
want for kindness towards her? A little tenderness and there's
nothing you couldn't do with her. If I hadn't always known it, I'd
have learnt it from her distress this morning."</p>

<p>Mr Law sighed. "A little tenderness and the termagant would
reappear. There would be a renewal of her eternal groundless
suspicions to fire her jealousies again. She's suffering from
conscience at the moment. A passing ailment." He was pacing the
room as he talked, and talking as if he thought aloud. "I think I
know my Catherine by now."</p>

<p>William shook his head dolefully. "You constantly convince me
that you don't. Will you never perceive how you fail to do her
justice? Jealousy, after all, has its roots in affection."</p>

<p>"In affection for one's self. I know."</p>

<p>"Sometimes perhaps, and sometimes for another. It may not always
be easy to distinguish, especially if you come to it with notions
preconceived that distort your vision. Have you ever thought that
jealousy is a torment, dear, to some women?"</p>

<p>"What then? Am I to be patient with that?"</p>

<p>"If you contribute to it."</p>

<p>"Is it possible that I have now become an <i>homme à femmes</i>
in your eyes, too, Will? I thank you."</p>

<p>"There is your past," William reminded him. "That overgay youth
of yours."</p>

<p>"That! Bah! The past is done with."</p>

<p>"The past is never done with. It is always and in all things
there, to explain the present. Only by infinite patience could you
have brought her to forget it."</p>

<p>"Patience! Faith, Will, I've always been accounted a patient
man. But no patience is without limits. I bore with her groundless
jealousies until they distracted me; then in self-protection I made
myself impervious and insensible to them."</p>

<p>"And thereby sharpened them the more. She would explain your
indifference in only one way. That made her resentful, and out of
resentment she became shrewish; because she was shrewish you
armoured yourself in yet stouter indifference. And so, each
reacting upon the other, the gulf between you has steadily
widened."</p>

<p>Mr Law stood still and looked at his brother, the quizzical
smile once more on his thin lips. "You seem to be describing the
inflation of values that is exercising us. But what is this, Will?
Has Catherine made you more than ever her advocate?"</p>

<p>"By her conduct this morning," William agreed emphatically. "If
you had seen her distress as I did, her very anguish at the thought
of your peril, you could never doubt her affection for you. I was
with her, John, and I tell you again as I've told you before that
under all the seeming levity of her nature, under all her
frowardness, that woman loves you. I'll never believe but that by
gentle handling you could shape her to your will."</p>

<p>Still looking at him, with a lift of the brows, Mr Law took
thought a moment; then slowly shook his head. "If I could believe
that..." he began, and there broke off with a laugh. "No, no, Will.
You overlook the alternative: that her distress was rooted in fear
that if I were destroyed, the social eminence so dear to her would
be destroyed with me. There would be an end to her salon, with its
throng of nobles and its sprinkling of abbés and chevaliers, to pay
their court to her; an end to playing the châtelaine at Guermande;
an end to her lackeys, her equipages, her black boy, and the rest.
Matter enough in all that to alarm Catherine."</p>

<p>William's eyes were sadly reproachful. "I'm wondering what proof
of your error would satisfy you."</p>

<p>"I wonder with you," said the elder Law. He laughed again,
without mirth, and upon that the discussion closed, for they were
interrupted by the entrance of Laguyon to announce that dinner was
served.</p>

<p>William stayed to dine with them, and the talk at table was of
the morning's events in the Rue Quincampoix, with Catherine
listening in alternating dread and satisfaction and an occasional
interjection.</p>

<p>The stout and even gay confidence Mr Law derived from those
events put heart anew into his doubting brother, so that when
William departed it was in the conviction that he had been unduly
mistrustful of the future, and that under the stimulus John had
applied to the market and under his astute guidance a recovery
might yet follow to give them the time they needed.</p>

<p>It did follow, and in the ensuing weeks the shares rose
gradually once more from the point to which they had fallen. By the
time, in the late summer when they had recovered to fifteen
thousand livres, the belief was general that the slump had been no
more than the manifestation of a transient and groundless
panic.</p>

<p>At this level of fifteen thousand, however, a halt was called by
the insidious underground campaign which d'Argenson had never
relaxed. His strength lay in the fact that he fought with weapons
of reality against a system built upon illusion.</p>

<p>Again both the timorous and the astute gave heed to the
Chancellor's skilfully disseminated argument that in realization
lay the only safe escape from an edifice that must inevitably
crash. The recovery d'Argenson described as the mere up-leap of an
expiring flame, and he went to work to prove it so.</p>

<p>When eventually the stock began once more to sag, and in a
measure as it sagged, the price of commodities underwent a fresh
increase, raising the level of wages with it, and these again
driving the price of commodities still higher. And now the falling
stock began ominously to drag down with it the value of the
banknotes.</p>

<p>The beginning of a general loss of confidence set in.</p>

<p>Despite the edicts putting the paper currency at a premium over
specie, it was being secretly exchanged at an ever increasing
discount for gold and silver, which were being hoarded for the sake
of their inalienable intrinsic value.</p>

<p>Fresh edicts, imposing fines and even imprisonment upon anyone
holding more than five hundred livres in gold, were being secretly
ignored. For no people will allow itself to be shamelessly
plundered of its own without resisting. Rewards offered for
delations and the domiciliary perquisitions that were being made
aroused hot indignation, both against the Comptroller-General and
against the Regent by whom he was supported.</p>

<p>Mr Law could no longer close his eyes to the mounting dangers of
the situation. Considering that there were no real values to be set
against that half-milliard in banknotes that remained uninvested in
the hands of the creditors of the State, coercion was his only
remaining weapon with which to combat the growing depression.</p>

<p>In despair he had further recourse to it. He subjected specie to
a fresh devaluation, made the use of paper currency obligatory,
imposed still harsher restrictions upon the manufacture of gold and
silver articles of every kind, and forbade the use of jewels into
which the paper currency was now being rapidly converted.</p>

<p>The result was that the government became entangled in and
hobbled by the endless regulations which a government must impose
when it attempts to interfere with the free and natural flow of
values.</p>

<p>He was too astute not to be aware of the perils such measures
must invoke; but he continued to take a gamester's chance, and
rather than leave the India Company to its fate, as William
pleaded, refused to divorce it from the Bank, which, once delivered
of that incubus, might well have weathered the storm.</p>

<p>He still trusted desperately to time for his salvation in
despite of those who were cogging the dice against him. But when in
its slump, the price of the shares had come down to ten thousand
livres, his enemies came out into the open. The general confusion
which was ensuing and the increasing reluctance to accept the paper
currency compelled the summoning of a Council of State to deal with
the situation.</p>

<p>It met under the presidency of the perturbed Regent, in that
same tapestried chamber of the Palais Royal, in which four years
ago Mr Law had first expounded the system by which he proposed to
rescue France from financial embarrassment. Its members were almost
the same, including even the Duke of Noailles, who, whilst no
longer of the Council of Finance, was still a member of the Council
of State.</p>

<p>The Marquis d'Argenson, covering his malice with a mask of
concern, and condoling with Monsieur Lass upon these adverse winds
of fortune which were threatening destruction to a system that once
had seemed of such fair promise, came with a plan worked out to the
last detail calculated to accelerate its ruin.</p>

<p>He expounded that a situation which he described as ominous
resulted at once from the inflated value of the India Company's
stock and from the greatly excessive amount of paper money in
circulation.</p>

<p>Whilst censuring in veiled terms the forced measures which were
aggravating the ruinous course, he proposed that it should be
arrested by pinning at five thousand livres the price of the shares
and reducing gradually, month by month, the value of the banknotes,
so that by the end of the year they should have reached a definite
reduction of one-half their face value, at which it might be hoped
to stabilize them.</p>

<p>Aghast at such a proposal, still more aghast at the manifest
favour with which it was received, and perceiving the malice by
which it was dictated, Mr Law controlled his indignation only with
difficulty as he started up to protest against it.</p>

<p>"The Chancellor blames my forced measures for a state of things
which he proposes to amend by forced measures infinitely more
outrageous. I warn Your Highness and all you gentlemen that the
decree for which the Chancellor now asks will precipitate a
catastrophe. It will create a panic whose repercussions may be
appalling. And since his intelligence is too acute not to perceive
it, I make bold to ask is that what Monsieur d'Argenson
desires?"</p>

<p>"A shameful question," Noailles reproved him.</p>

<p>"Indecent," mumbled old Villeroy. "Indecent is the least that
one can say of it."</p>

<p>It required the intervention of the Regent to subdue the storm
of outcries that beat about the Comptroller-General's head.</p>

<p>"Messieurs! Messieurs!" The Regent waved plump white hands to
repress them. Then, gently, he remonstrated with Law. "My dear
Baron, you must not, in the heat of the moment, impute to Monsieur
le Marquis base motives which I know him to be incapable of
harbouring."</p>

<p>Mr Law bowed his head. "I will withdraw a question which Your
Highness assures me I was wrong to ask." He had recovered from his
gust of anger. "As for the value of the India Company's stock, if
it is definitely fixed, as Monsieur le Marquis proposes the least
that can follow will be a further loss of confidence in it. Left to
itself, the stock should ultimately find its real value, and this
value in time--and before long, once the new colonists have shown
their worth--may easily be as high as speculation has set it."</p>

<p>Someone laughed. Mr Law, however, paid no heed.</p>

<p>"When we come to the paper currency, however, it is easy to
demonstrate the disastrous error of the Chancellor's proposal. Do
not be deluded into believing that any decree will succeed in
gradually reducing its value. Once the intention is known, the
notes will depreciate immediately, amid not merely by the one-half
that is ultimately intended. Consider now, I beg, that there are in
circulation some two milliards in round figures.</p>

<p>"Of this, for one and a half milliards the Bank holds real
value, in specie, in trade credits and in fiscal revenues. That
leaves only a half-milliard--one quarter of the total--for which
there is not cover, a half-milliard that would have been destroyed
had it returned to the Bank through the India Company, as it must
have returned had not the swift rise brought about by speculation
prevented State creditors from buying the stock save at prices they
were unwilling to pay."</p>

<p>"By whose fault?" growled d'Argenson.</p>

<p>"Oh, I will admit the fault," said Mr Law. "It was my one
miscalculation in all this."</p>

<p>"Your one established miscalculation," Noailles amended.</p>

<p>"As you please, Monsieur le Duc." Mr Law was disdainful. "I am
not to quibble. Permit me keep to the point. For the sake of this
excessive one-quarter in the issue of notes it is proposed to
depreciate the value of the total in circulation by one-half. Whom
will that profit? Does it even make sense?"</p>

<p>"Not to me, messieurs," said His troubled Highness, and he
looked round the board for support, but found only
Saint-Simon's.</p>

<p>The little Duke, who is often prim but rarely coarse, tells us
of the terms in which he denounced the proposal. "It amounts," he
said, "to what in matters of finance and bankruptcy is known as
<i>montrer le cul</i>. By the proposed decree we should exhibit it
so uncovered that all would be accounted lost far beyond the
reality."</p>

<p>But d'Argenson thundered that even this was better, in the face
of the facts, than that the State should continue to support a
falsehood which was fast becoming evident to all the world.</p>

<p>"And therefore," said Law, with biting sarcasm, "it is proposed
to represent the falsehood as greater than it actually is. As a
means of combating falsehood that possesses at least the virtue of
originality."</p>

<p>D'Argenson's retort was violent. "Sneers, sir, are not
argument," he cried, his heavy jowl thrust forward. "There are
facts to be faced. They are not to be swept aside by sarcasm. We
are confronted with the natural, the inevitable reaction from a
transient prosperity--transient because false--induced by your
system. The situation is desperate. Perhaps you do not yet choose
to realize how desperate. It can be met only by desperate
measures."</p>

<p>The Council's support was hot and unanimous, with the single
exception of Saint-Simon; and even Saint-Simon did not further
press the objection he had raised. Having expressed it, he
conceived that he had done all that could be expected of him or
that was permitted him by his resentment of Law's intervention, as
he believed, in the case of the Count of Horn.</p>

<p>The end of it was that, however reluctant--for his faith in his
Comptroller-General had as yet been only slightly impaired by the
events--the Regent felt himself compelled to bow to the fierce
unanimity of his council, and Mr Law went home in angry
despair.</p>

<p>He was justified of this by what followed as soon as it became
known that the edict had gone to the Parliament to be registered
and what were the measures it decreed.</p>

<p>Whilst the profiteers--the "realizers," as they were called--who
had converted into real estate and tangible values the fortunes
they had made were more or less secure, the great mass of the
people raised a storm of protest at this menace of arbitrarily
cutting in half the value of the paper money of which their hands
were full. Rich and poor alike, believing themselves ruined,
assumed that Law was the real author of the edict. Uproar against
him, and against the Regent for abetting him, were immediate and of
a violence that swelled rapidly to formidable proportions.</p>

<p>A mob, made up from every class of society, in which the most
clamant and virulent were the market women, blocked the approaches
to the Hôtel de Nevers, not, as before, to acclaim Monsieur Lass
and hold out its hands for the wealth of which he had been the
dispenser, but to heap curses upon his name and to deafen him with
its howl of threats and denunciations. It was held in check only by
the stout gates of the courtyard until a detachment of musketeers,
dispatched by the Regent, cleared the street and remained on guard
there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another mob was clamouring about the Palais Royal,
swarming the iron railings to express in similar fashion its anger
with the Regent.</p>

<p>Such was the general fury in the days that followed, so alarming
were the street scenes, so hostile the siege of the Bank's
premises, also guarded now by troops, and so scurrilous the
lampoons and pamphlets inciting the people to fresh violence that
d'Argenson himself began to be appalled by the storm he had
raised.</p>

<p>When after five days of this turbulence, it still showed no
signs of abating, he took his courage in both hands, and went off
to wait again upon the Regent.</p>

<p>He had learnt that the Parliament in its latest session, in
order to gratify its abiding rancour of Law, by whose influence it
had been humbled, and at the same time to present itself in the
cherished role of the people's buckler, had decided to refuse to
register the offending edict.</p>

<p>The Regent received the Chancellor in his private cabinet,
attended only by the elegant La Vrillière. His manner was unusually
stern.</p>

<p>"I hope that having let hell loose upon us, you are now
persuaded of your lack of wisdom, Monsieur le Marquis."</p>

<p>The big man bowed himself double. Agitation had mottled his
rugged, swarthy face. "A desperate disease, monseigneur, demands a
desperate cure."</p>

<p>"So you said before the Council. I fear you lack originality. Do
you think to soothe me with stale apophthegms out of
Montaigne?"</p>

<p>"If that were all, I should be less distressed, monseigneur."
And at once he related what the Parliament was preparing.</p>

<p>His Highness received the news with a gust of angry laughter.
"So! My old friends of the robe have discovered a way to win the
popularity of the mob."</p>

<p>"Your Highness expresses it exactly. May I respectfully submit
that you should deprive them of that satisfaction by anticipating
them: cut the ground from under their feet by, yourself, revoking
the edict."</p>

<p>"You submit that respectfully, do you?" His Highness shook with
anger. "If you had been half as respectful in submitting your
demand for the decree, we might have been spared this disgraceful
uproar. You will permit me to tell you, Marquis, that I find your
submission impudent?"</p>

<p>D'Argenson was now shaking in his turn. "Your Highness will do
me the justice to remember that to a man the Council shared my
view."</p>

<p>"But you were the advocate, Monsieur d'Argenson, and not even to
be restrained by the arguments of Monsieur Lass, who precisely
foresaw what must follow. A panic of appalling repercussions was
what he foretold. And we have it. A wise man would have remembered
the overwhelming proofs of prescience we have had from the Baron in
the past. If I had been the king I should have insisted that he be
heeded. Unfortunately I am only the Regent. However, it is idle to
look back. This vicious edict shall be revoked, and we'll hope that
it may do something towards arresting the evil. La Vrillière, you
will give yourself the trouble of conveying that at once to the
President de Mesmes."</p>

<p>At the same time, in the kindly hope of reassuring Law, whose
distress he conceived, the Regent sent word of what he had done on
his own responsibility: that the edict was cancelled and that the
banknotes and the shares in the India Company were to be left at
their current values.</p>

<p>Upon Law's mind the messages produced an effect the very
opposite of that which was intended. Infuriated, he rang for
Laguyon, and ordered his carriage.</p>

<p>Hearing of this, Catherine stood suddenly before him. Pale and
worn and red-eyed from weeping, her delicate winsomeness had been
sorely ravaged by the terror of these last days. "Where are you
going, John?"</p>

<p>"To the Regent."</p>

<p>She remonstrated fearfully. She implored him not to leave the
house. "The people's mood is horrible. They are like wild beasts. I
am frightened, John. Only this morning, and in spite of the guards,
I heard them shouting 'Death to Lass'!"</p>

<p>"Death to Lass!" he echoed, and laughed. "A month ago it was
'Long live Monsieur Lass'. Why heed the voice of the rabble with
its 'Hosanna' today and 'Crucify' tomorrow'?"</p>

<p>"I will not let you go," she cried.</p>

<p>"Not let me?" He was suddenly stern. He seemed to grow taller
under her pleading eyes. "That is mere folly, Catherine. Unless I
act, unless I check the capers of those lunatics about the Regent,
it will be the death of Lass, indeed."</p>

<p>He went past her to the door. But as he reached it, he turned.
She was looking after him wild-eyed, huddled in the chair to which
she had sunk, and her lips moved quiveringly, as if she were
praying.</p>

<p>The spectacle touched him, and he may well have asked himself in
that grim moment, when whilom adulatory friends were all falling
away, leaving him to stand lonely and alone to face the seething
hatred of thwarted greed, whether his brother might not be right,
whether there was not here, as William protested, a faithful heart,
under the levity and shrewishness which perhaps his indifference
had provoked.</p>

<p>To reassure her he put on a confident smile, and his tone was
suddenly gentle. "Courage, Catherine. Have no fear for me. I assure
you there is not the need. I shall not be long away."</p>

<p>The grounds for her fears were soon to become apparent. Outside
the Hôtel de Nevers the street was made safe enough by the guards.
But in the space before the gates of the Palais Royal a small crowd
of demonstrators was noisy, and execrations rained upon Mr Law when
his liveries were recognized. To enter the palace by the ordinary
way it would be necessary to drive through that mob, and since this
might be provocative, he ordered his coachman to go on and set him
down at the side entrance in the Rue de Richelieu.</p>

<p>He was obeyed, but the crowd came rolling in the wake of the
carriage, swollen as it went by word that the detested Monsieur
Lass was now within reach of its vengeance.</p>

<p>A half-hour later, to the Parliament then in session, the
President de Mesmes was able to announce the glad tidings that the
carriage of Monsieur Lass had been smashed to fragments in the
street. Jubilation, however, was presently tempered by
disappointment when further word was brought that unfortunately the
Comptroller-General had no longer been in the vehicle when it was
wrecked.</p>

<p>In fact, when the ugly incident took place, Mr Law was closeted
with Dubois, demanding to be taken to the Regent, and inveighing
against a revocation that could only serve, in his view, to pile
confusion upon confusion.</p>

<p>To Dubois, no longer a merely titular abbé, but by now an
ordained priest and Archbishop of Cambrai, to the see of which he
had lately been raised, the reason for Mr Law's indignation was
anything but plain. On the contrary, if there was poison in a given
measure, a contrary measure should supply the antidote. The Regent
was distressed enough already. Monsieur d'Argenson was with him at
that moment, having been commanded, and Dubois displayed what he
termed reluctance to trouble His Highness further on so vain an
issue.</p>

<p>Mr Law's mood became savage. "You call it vain? My dear
Archbishop, don't scruple to quarrel with me if it's to your
profit. You will merely be in step with all those I have enriched.
The gold with which I have gorged them has nauseated them, and they
are now vomiting their spite over me."</p>

<p>"My God, my God! What are you saying? How you wrong me!" The
weasel face was puckered in real distress. He looked more than ever
like Monsieur de Voltaire. He had made great profit out of the
system, and whether grateful or not had no wish to quarrel with one
who if goaded might make revelations that would be awkward for any
man, but doubly awkward for an archbishop. "Come to the Regent,
then, if you insist. But upon your own head the consequences."</p>

<p>As it happened, engaged in a fresh discussion of the situation
with the Chancellor the disquieted Regent actually welcomed Mr
Law's arrival. His reception was of an affability seasoned with
condolence.</p>

<p>"Ah, Baron, Monsieur d'Argenson is telling me that things
continue to take an ugly shape."</p>

<p>Mr Law was blunt. "They'll take a still uglier one as a result
of this revocation."</p>

<p>Behind him Dubois clucked deprecation. Monsieur d'Argenson
breathed hard, whilst the Regent became haughty.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what alternative remained considering the
public clamour? Here!" He picked up a sheet from his writing table
"Read this filth."</p>

<p>It was a lampoon of more than ordinary scurrility, telling the
Regent what to do with his paper money. Mr Law ignored it.</p>

<p>"There never was an alternative to the edict, monseigneur, once
it had done its mischief. All that remained was to ride out the
storm it raised. Storms after all have a way of spending their
fury. But now..." He spread his hands in a gesture of protest and
hopelessness. "We cannot even count upon that. The hope is
shipwrecked on this admission of dishonesty."</p>

<p>"Dishonesty!" Both Regent and Chancellor uttered the indignant
exclamation together.</p>

<p>"Dishonesty," Mr Law insisted. "What else? To revoke an edict
that halved the value of the currency is to confess that the edict
was unnecessary. If unnecessary, if the banknotes may retain their
face value, how is the attempted reduction to be regarded but as a
dishonest means of profiting the Treasury?"</p>

<p>The Regent sat down suddenly, blank dismay on his face. He
looked at d'Argenson and his voice shook. "Here is something that
you left out of your calculations, Marquis."</p>

<p>"But...in the face of the public clamour..." d'Argenson was
faltering when Mr Law broke in without ceremony.</p>

<p>"It is something that escaped the Council also. I foretold what
must follow, that the people would not be content to accept the
course of a gradual reduction, but would at once account the notes
discredited, and that, faced with the dread of ruin, the public
indignation would be terrible. Was anything else to be
expected?"</p>

<p>D'Argenson reared his great head to meet the attack. Eyes
blazing in a livid face, he confronted Law. "For the author of that
ruin, sir, you permit yourself a singularly bold tone."</p>

<p>"It is yourself is the author of the ruin. When machinations to
discredit the paper currency by a run on the bank for specie had
been foiled, you had recourse to this still more disastrous
expedient, dissembled by linking the notes with the depreciation of
the India Company's stock."</p>

<p>The Chancellor turned angrily to the Regent. "I beg Your
Highness to protect me from these imputations."</p>

<p>"How?" The Regent, already half-won by Law's forcefulness,
looked coldly at the Marquis. "Are you no longer able to protect
yourself? You have but to answer Monsieur Lass."</p>

<p>"Then I answer without fear of contradiction that if I advised
the edict it was because the ruin had already overtaken us. Your
Highness knows that we must go much further back to discover the
source of this disaster. It springs from a crazy attempt to convert
France into a single colossal stock company. The effect of such a
system has been to enrich rascals of every class; to ruin the
middle class, which is the most honest, industrious and useful
class of all; to confuse the conditions of life, corrupt the public
morals, and pervert the national character. That is what has been
achieved by assuming control of commerce and removing it from the
hands of the experienced merchants who had formerly conducted it on
their own responsibility and at their own risk."</p>

<p>"Even if all that were true, which I am not prepared to admit,"
said Mr Law, "it still applies only to the India Company; and even
then the ruin, which involved only the speculators, was by no means
irreparable. But so far as the Bank is concerned, these allegations
are utterly false. As I showed the Council, the Bank is
fundamentally sound."</p>

<p>"With an issue of paper of a half-milliard beyond its
resources!" roared the Chancellor, beside himself.</p>

<p>The Regent smacked the table, to call him to order. "Monsieur le
Marquis, I do not like raised voices."</p>

<p>The Chancellor, in confusion, bowed his apologies. Mr Law became
still more incisive. "Let me remind you again that that is only a
quarter of the total issue, and that for the remainder, as I
demonstrated, the Bank holds solid value. In no case was a cut of
one half to be justified by a shortage of less than one quarter. As
for this quarter, given time and prudence it could gradually be
absorbed."</p>

<p>"Do you say so?" d'Argenson sneered. "Then you may easily prove
it by taking time and prudence. By the revocation of the edict the
situation is restored."</p>

<p>"Restored? Is it possible that you still believe it? Have you
already forgotten my contention that by this revocation we shall be
branded with dishonesty?"</p>

<p>"We have only your word for that, Monsieur Lass.''</p>

<p>"And when has my word not been verified by the ensuing
facts?"</p>

<p>"By God! Your modesty!" ejaculated the Marquis.</p>

<p>But Mr Law never heeded him. His tone, invested with a slow
forcefulness, preserved its quiet level. "At the meeting of the
council I forecast that the edict would raise a storm. That storm
may have exceeded your expectations. It has not exceeded mine. It
reduced the paper currency at a stroke to half its value. My
present forecast is that the revocation will render it quite
worthless.''</p>

<p>"<i>Peste</i>! I hope not," cried the Regent.</p>

<p>D'Argenson could still assert himself "Your Highness need fear
no such consequences."</p>

<p>The Regent's glance sought Dubois, who had remained a silent
witness. "In God's name, Archbishop, why don't you say something?
Have you no views?"</p>

<p>The fact was that for some moments the Archbishop's attention
had been elsewhere. He had been intently listening to a swelling
murmur outside which had escaped the other three, engrossed as they
were. He raised a forefinger, his eyes wide with apprehension.
"Harken!" he enjoined.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke there was a resounding crash, and the murmur,
swelling suddenly, announced itself clearly as the roar of an angry
multitude.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said d'Argenson, "that the courtyard has been
invaded."</p>

<p>The Regent rose. "Come with me," he commanded, and passed from
his cabinet to the gallery that overlooked the court.</p>

<p>From one of its windows they beheld the place packed by a
violently clamant mob. In the foreground, three stretchers were
displayed, and on each there was a human body.</p>

<p>La Vrillière out of breath came hastening along the gallery. In
gasps he brought out his ugly news. In the storming of the Bank
that morning by a crowd that demanded specie for its paper, three
men had been crushed to death. The mob had brought the bodies to
the Palais Royal, as if to justify by them their angry
demonstration. He also brought word that Mr Law's carriage had been
reduced to fragments, but that coachman and footmen, at least, were
safe within the palace.</p>

<p>"God help us!" said the Regent, but without any sign of fear.
For all his softness, he was not without personal courage. "Find Le
Blanc. Tell him to clear the courtyard. Let it be done without
unnecessary violence. Come, messieurs."</p>

<p>Followed by the three he returned to his cabinet and flung
himself ill-humouredly into the chair at his writing table.</p>

<p>"Well, Chancellor?" His voice rasped harshly. "Do you still
insist that we need not fear the consequences foretold by Monsieur
Lass?"</p>

<p>Within the frame of his black periwig the Chancellor's rugged
swarthy countenance was almost green. For once his booming
eloquence failed him. He stuttered before he brought out the
answer: "Do me right, Highness! After all, the edict was your
own."</p>

<p>"I see. So now you place the responsibility upon me. But I am
not the King, as I told the Council. I am only the Regent, and I
govern by a Council, whose unanimity I am not to withstand. In this
disastrous affair the Council was swayed by you, by reliance upon
your foresight, by faith in your calculations." He paused, his
glance sternly upon the Chancellor, who for once in his life stood
mute, confounded. Then he went on: "I will not ask, monsieur, how
far those calculations were inspired by prejudice, to use no
harsher word. But I must require of you that you bring me the seals
of your office this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Your Highness!" gasped the broken Chancellor.</p>

<p>His Highness waved a hand. "You have my leave to withdraw."</p>

<p>After a moment's palsied hesitation d'Argenson bowed low, bowed
as if under a crushing weight. Then drawing himself up, and without
so much as a glance at the others, he marched heavily out of the
room.</p>

<p>If his vindictiveness had opened an abyss for Mr Law, he was,
himself, the first to hurtle into it in disgrace, his career
shattered, his great ambitions wrecked.</p>

<p>There was a silence after he had gone. Then the Regent,
dismissing the dark thoughts that absorbed him, looked at Dubois.
"Monsieur de Cambrai, you will send today to Fresne, to require
d'Aguesseau to return. In this pass we need a man of known
integrity in the Chancellorship. I pray that it may serve to
restore some confidence. That is all that I can do." His glance
shifted to Law. "And now, Baron?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mr Law was again miraculously calm. "Your Highness will, of
course, require me to resign the Comptrollership."</p>

<p>"If it is your wish to relinquish the helm at such a
moment."</p>

<p>"Not if Your Highness thinks I can still be of service."</p>

<p>"I know of no one else whose knowledge of finance I would more
surely trust."</p>

<p>Mr Law bowed. "Your Highness is very generous. Very magnanimous.
My system, as your Highness perceives, has been laid in ruins.
Still, if you command me, monseigneur, I will study means to make
what repairs may yet be possible."</p>

<p>"May God guide and prosper you in that," was the lugubrious
prayer, on which the Regent dismissed him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>Chapter 29 -- THE NADIR</h2>

<p>Unobtrusively and unrecognized, Mr Law made his way back to the
Hôtel de Nevers, and the waiting, distracted Catherine.</p>

<p>He greeted her with an ease that belied his feelings, "You see
how idle were your alarms."</p>

<p>"Idle!" Her voice was shrill with reproach. "Do you think I do
not know that your carriage was smashed to matchwood, and that it
is only by the mercy of God that you were not in it at the
time?"</p>

<p>"You haven't realized yet that I work miracles."</p>

<p>She seized his arms as if she would shake him. "How can you
laugh, John, at such a time? How can you?"</p>

<p>"Calm, my dear. Be calm. The masses are fickle, mere emotional
animals, never long of the same mind. This mood will pass, and all
will again be well. Before long you'll hear them shouting '<i>Vive
Monsieur Lass</i>,' as before. Meanwhile, I've taken thought for
you. You will leave tonight for Guermande with the children, and
remain there until this storm blows itself out."</p>

<p>"Go to Guermande? I?" She spoke as if scandalized. "And leave
you here to face these dangers alone?"</p>

<p>"Dangers! Faugh! Do not let us exaggerate."</p>

<p>"You would have me believe that there are none. Then why do you
wish me to go?"</p>

<p>"Because I shall have a more tranquil mind for what is to do if
I know that you and the children are safely away from these
disturbances."</p>

<p>"And I? Should I be tranquil if I went? Should I know a single
moment's peace, wondering whether you are alive or dead? I remain
here, John. Understand that. Of the two evils it is the less."</p>

<p>This unusual resoluteness took him by surprise. He still sought
to persuade her to leave Paris for a while; but in the end, finding
all insistence vain, he yielded reluctantly to her determination to
remain. Deeply touched by it in that hour of trouble and by its
renewed implication of an affection in which he had long since
ceased to believe, he recalled his brother's last representations
to him, and for a moment wondered again whether it was possible
that William's sight was clearer than his own. He might have given
it deeper thought had his mind not been commanded and obsessed by
the need to consider means of arresting the cataclysm that was
overtaking them.</p>

<p>To this he applied himself at once, and what could be done he
did, so that the Regent, with revived hope had reason presently to
praise the prodigies by which his Comptroller-General still sought
in these unutterably difficult circumstances to direct the finances
of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>His plan for absorbing the excessive banknotes lay in the
re-creation of a public debt for those four or five hundred
millions, offering it to the State creditors who had failed to
purchase India Company stock, and whose hands remained full of
paper currency for which they could find no investment. Meanwhile,
in order to gain time, he delimited by edict the use of specie by
restricting the amount to be withdrawn from the Bank on any given
day. At the same time he shortened the banking hours, and enjoined
leisureliness upon the cashiers in exchanging the paper offered.
Where formerly he had arbitrarily depreciated specie in order to
enhance the value of paper, he now took the opposite arbitrary
course of raising the value of specie by one-third, so that less
should be required to meet the daily tender of banknotes.</p>

<p>He laid other plans calculated to restore credit once the
situation had been stabilized. His hopes of winning out were
strengthened by the cessation of the fury of the fickle populace,
which had so far spent itself that he could once more show himself
in public without danger of being stoned. He was even seen once or
twice at the opera in the Regent's box.</p>

<p>A few weeks, however, served to show that all hope of recovery
was vain illusion.</p>

<p>In those last throws of the gamester to retrieve what was lost,
he was to find that d'Argenson and his party had cogged the dice
too heavily against him before being reduced to impotence. The
Chancellor's edict and its revocation had so ruined the credit of
the paper currency that no conceivable measures could restore it.
Merchants were refusing to accept it, or if they accepted it at all
they did so at their own valuation, and this fell so low that
within a month of d'Argenson's edict the louis d'or was selling for
a hundred and twenty livres. Those who retained specie in
contravention of the edict employed it secretly for the purchase of
their requirements. The prices of commodities which had soared
under prosperity, continued still to soar in adversity because of
money's loss of purchasing power. Bread was selling at five sous a
pound, which was ten times its normal cost, with meat, butter, eggs
and wine in proportion. For cloth previously purchasable at fifteen
livres the ell, one hundred and twenty-five livres was being
paid.</p>

<p>This catastrophic alteration of values bore most heavily upon
the industrious bourgeois, the backbone of the State's prosperity
in every age, and upon the labouring classes, which were no longer
able to find employment. As all this became swiftly aggravated,
producing chaos in the national life, the tide of execration
against Law and the Regent, which for a moment had receded, rolled
up again, storm-tossed once more when that universal misery had
fully succeeded the universal false prosperity of a year ago.</p>

<p>Obscene lampoons against the Regent became of daily publication,
and once again neither he nor Law could drive through the streets
without being exposed to insult and to the danger of violence.</p>

<p>At last there came a day of early autumn when after a peculiarly
hostile demonstration against the Regent during a performance of
<i>Phaeton</i> at the opera, Mr Law confessed himself defeated and
the game lost, and made admission of it to his brother.</p>

<p>"Not only must I own defeat, but by owning it I may do a last
service to the Regent. I owe it to him for the loyalty with which
he has supported me through all."</p>

<p>William Law was too fully and dolefully in agreement with him to
argue, nor did he wish it, for in the pass to which things were
come he almost found relief in this decision.</p>

<p>So once more and for the last time the Laird of Lauriston sought
the Regent, and found him in gloomy consultation with Dubois.</p>

<p>"Ah, Baron," His Highness greeted him, "I was about to send for
you. You will have heard what happened to me last night at the
opera. Not the rabble this time, but men of good condition, people
of quality, the last support remaining me in this crisis."</p>

<p>"That is what brings me, monseigneur." Mr Law was becomingly and
sincerely solemn. "Your Highness needs a whipping boy. That is the
only office I can now fill with advantage to you."</p>

<p>"Eh?" His Highness was startled.</p>

<p>"I am here, may it please Your Highness, to resign the
Comptrollership."</p>

<p>"You have taken fright, then, have you?"</p>

<p>The Scot's long, noble countenance wore a melancholy smile. "No,
monseigneur, not fright. I have become poignantly aware that it
will be in Your Highness' best interests. Your Highness will
announce that you have dismissed me."</p>

<p>"I see. I am to fling you to the lions, eh?"</p>

<p>"The measure will be so generally approved that the lightnings
of public wrath will be deflected from Your Highness' head."</p>

<p>"To strike yours instead, Baron. I do not happen to be made of
that kind of wood. I do not accept your resignation."</p>

<p>"Permit me to observe, monseigneur, with the utmost submission,
that it is as much Your Highness' duty to accept it as it is mine
to offer it."</p>

<p>"And you will permit me to observe, Monsieur le Baron, that I am
not to be instructed in my duty."</p>

<p>Mr Law, nevertheless, went on instructing him. "Your Highness
stands for France. I stand only for myself, and do not matter. Once
you have dismissed me--who am regarded as the cause of all this
evil--some calm will be restored; then a reaction will follow, and
make it possible to carry out the plan I have outlined, and others
which your Council will be able to devise, for restoring
order."</p>

<p>The Regent pondered gloomily. "Devil take it, I am to play the
coward, then; cast all the blame upon you, and shelter myself
behind you. That is the sum of your advice. <i>Eh bien</i>, my dear
Baron, it is not how I conceive it. The responsibility is equally
mine."</p>

<p>"Not equally, monseigneur. The application of the system
devolved solely upon me, and I am guilty of two miscalculations.
The first was not to have provided against the speculative buying
of the India Company's stock before the State creditors had been
given the opportunity to acquire it. The second was not to have
foreseen how frenziedly the greed of profit would drive up that
stock once speculation in it had begun. The ill will that has
precipitated this ruin was beyond my control. But had I avoided
those two errors and perhaps others, it is possible that ill will
would have been denied opportunity. In time the exploitation of
Louisiana might have become, as I still confidently believe that it
will, a source of inexhaustible wealth to France."</p>

<p>The Regent looked at Dubois, dull-eyed. "Can I possibly do this,
my friend, and preserve my self-respect."</p>

<p>The Archbishop's lean face twitched. "Since Your Highness asks
me, I do not hesitate to say that you can do nothing else. Monsieur
Lass has supplied--nobly supplied, if I may say so--the sword that
cuts this Gordian knot. As he points out, monseigneur's duty to
France asks no less."</p>

<p>"No less than that I acquire some rehabilitation at the Baron's
expense! <i>Parbleu</i>, it's a noble thing to be a prince. And the
Baron, Archbishop? What is to become of him? Not even his life may
be left him once it is assumed that he is in disgrace and that the
full force of public hatred may be loosed upon him."</p>

<p>"Do not be concerned, monseigneur. I shall not be here to meet
it. My brother, who, I am relieved to think, shares none of this
execration in which I am now held, will remain for as long as Your
Highness considers necessary in winding up the Bank." He paused a
moment, whilst the Regent, with rumpled brow, sat staring gloomily
before him. Then he resumed. "Because of slanders that may spring
up when I am gone, Your Highness will bear with me if I add that
whilst I have made the fortunes of many I have taken no thought for
my own. With opportunities to enrich myself such as probably have
never been afforded to any man, I will ask Your Highness to believe
that I have not placed a single louis out of France. The Bank's
reserve of gold will prove it. Such wealth as I have acquired here,
which, apart from my lands of Guermande, may amount to some ten
millions, I leave behind."</p>

<p>"Ah, that, no!" the Regent impulsively protested. "So much is
not necessary, my dear Lass."</p>

<p>"Most necessary, Highness, for my honour. It will remain in
order to shield me from defamation."</p>

<p>Sadly the Regent bowed his head, and for a moment there was
silence. "If I let you go," he said at last, "it is in the hope
that I may recall you once all this has died down, once order is
restored, once the yield of Louisiana, due to your enterprise,
shall, as I hope, have repaired our finances. You see, my friend,"
he ended on a sad smile, "I still have faith in you."</p>

<p>He stood up, and held out his hand. Mr Law accepted it and bore
it to his lips. "My heart is full of gratitude for those words,
monseigneur." Then, erect once more, placid as ever, elegant and
commanding, he added: "Whenever Your Highness thinks that I may
serve you, a word will bring me."</p>

<p>But his smile as he spoke was sardonic, for he was too fully
assured that his repute could never survive the full discredit
which he now invited in payment of his debt to a prince who had so
fully trusted him.</p>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>Chapter 30 -- THE PASSPORT</h2>

<p>He sat once more, at dusk, in that spacious, lofty, handsome
room of his, panelled in dark Cordovan leather, between pilasters
with gilded capitals, enriched by its choice pictures and sumptuous
furnishings, whilst a mob, athirst for his blood, now that he was
stripped of all his greatness, howled bestially under his windows,
held at bay only by the Regent's musketeers. For word had gone
forth that he was dismissed with ignominy--flung to the lions, in
the Regent's own words--and the leonine rabble, regarding him as a
legitimate prey, was avid to avenge upon him the ruin and misery of
France.</p>

<p>With him, pale and uneasy, were William Law, his secretary
Lacroix, a confidential clerk from the bank named Normand, who had
taken McWhirter's place, and the directors of the two principal
amalgamated companies. They were receiving his final instructions,
which he delivered pacing the long chamber, his shoulders bowed,
his hands behind his back.</p>

<p>When the last word on the subject of finance was spoken,
Lacroix, Norman and the others took a distressed, affectionate
leave of him, and the brothers were left alone together.</p>

<p>"And so, Will, we reach the end. An ignoble end. By way of the
Capital we come to the Tarpeian Rock. It may be that I should have
given heed to the geese when they cackled their warnings. It may be
that I sought to grasp more than a man may hold: that I should have
remained content, as you begged me, with the Bank, and not sought
the manipulation of a country's commerce. It is even possible that
d'Argenson said no more than is true when he borrowed the more
honest opinion of d'Aguesseau that the business of government is to
govern and not to trade. Yet if the matter had been fairly tested
perhaps the result might have been different. I do not know. But I
must think so for my credit's sake."</p>

<p>William, watching him, listening in distress, was too generous
to say that the end was no more than he had foreseen. "Conjecture
will be idle now, John," was all he said. "For the rest, you may
leave it to me to clear things up for the best."</p>

<p>His brother paused in his pacing to lay an affectionate hand
upon his shoulder. "God knows, Will, I am sorry to leave you the
burden of this last task."</p>

<p>"You have no choice, and you need take no thought for me. What,
after all, is my task when compared with yours? Our concern now is
how to get you away. You hear those infernal wolves. How they've
changed their howl since a year ago, when they packed the street to
shout 'Long live Monsieur Lass!' Given the chance they'll eat you
alive."</p>

<p>"Faith, it might be best."</p>

<p>"And Catherine?"</p>

<p>Mr Law turned away with a gesture of helplessness. "Best for
her, too, poor soul. Prosperous, the master of fortune, I was of
little account to her. Perhaps of no more account than I deserved
to be. Broken, I shall be of none."</p>

<p>"You make too sure, John."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "We judge the future from the past."</p>

<p>"So we do. But how much may you not have contributed to that
past? I have urged you more than once to ask yourself."</p>

<p>"And I have been asking myself just that. Making an examination
of conscience, as they say in the faith which I embraced for
worldly advantage. But I haven't found the answer. And now there
are more urgent matters to engage us. We haven't much time. Let us
come to the essentials."</p>

<p>He had spoken impatiently. When he resumed again he was more
deliberate.</p>

<p>"Once it is known that I have gone, this siege will cease and
Catherine's way will be clear. For the rest...she has her jewels.
Their value is considerable. There is this palace." Wistfully he
looked round at the room's opulent appointments which he had
assembled with such appreciative care, to render it a mirror of his
own fastidious mind. "Then there is the property of Guermande. It
is all that I am asking the Regent to allow me to retain, so that I
may make some provision for her. When sold the proceeds should not
be negligible. There are the children, too. God knows I am no more
of a success as a father than as a husband or a financier."</p>

<p>"And you, John? What provision have you made for yourself?"</p>

<p>Mr Law shrugged. "I take with me eight hundred louis in gold.
More than enough for immediate needs."</p>

<p>"And after that?" William spoke in dismay.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Madame Fortune will provide, unless she has now jilted
me for good and all. Anyway, it is all that I take away of the two
millions that I brought to France. I still have my wits, though,
from what has happened, you may doubt it."</p>

<p>William's glance was sorrowful. "Are you to go back to your
gamester's trade?"</p>

<p>"When did I relinquish it?"</p>

<p>"But to live by the turn of a card, the fall of the dice!"</p>

<p>"Always provided that I get away with my life. If I don't I
shall be spared the trouble. And there is one thing I forgot. I am
without a passport. Obtain me one tomorrow from His Highness, and
send it after me to Guermande. I'll stay there till it comes."</p>

<p>He slipped away late that night, after the mob, grown tired of
its bloodthirsty clamour, had gone home to bed.</p>

<p>Despite William's earnest pleading, he took no leave of
Catherine, fearing emotional remonstrances, judging it best for
both of them in all the circumstances. She did not even know that
he had gone until the following morning, when William handed her
the letter her husband had left for her, in which he sued her
pardon for his past shortcomings and for all the distress with
which, by the malignity of fortune, he was now visiting her.</p>

<p>She wept as she read, and wild and stormy were her upbraidings
of William for not having warned her of his brother's
intentions.</p>

<p>By then Mr Law was well on his way to Brie and the Château de
Guermande, which he scarcely regarded any longer as his own. With
Grandval and his wife, the couple who were its caretakers, for only
servants, he waited there three days impatiently for the passport
that should enable him to leave France and go once more upon his
travels. He remembered how Catherine in the past had so frequently
taunted him with the complaint that she was married to the
Wandering Jew. This time, at least, he would spare her the
grievance that he dragged her with him from land to land.</p>

<p>He thought of her and the children with some wistfulness in that
time of brooding, pondering how different life might have been had
she been more patient with him and he with her. He almost surprised
himself by the sense of loneliness the absence of wife and children
brought him. A failure in all things, he told himself, it was as a
husband and a father that he had failed most abjectly. His boy, he
reflected, had been the playmate of the little king; his girl,
scarcely in her teens, had been sought in marriage by some of the
best blood in France. Hereafter, with obscurity for only prospect,
they might come to curse him for having raised them to those dizzy
heights merely to cast them down again into obscurity.</p>

<p>If in his present loneliness and in his groping for a future the
daydream of seeking Margaret in England crossed his troubled mind,
it scarcely now presented itself in the guise of a temptation.
Pride alone would have forbidden him to go empty-handed to one to
whom even when his hands were full he had not dared at the last to
offer himself. But there was more than pride to forbid it. There
was the memory of those words of hers, that happiness is not to be
built upon another's sorrow. And he now believed that happiness
with Margaret, even if attainable, would bring Catherine a grief
that was not merely, as once he might have supposed, of lacerated
vanity.</p>

<p>On the dull evening of his third day of waiting at Guermande he
was moodily pacing the terrace when a great travelling carriage
drawn by four splendid horses, came swaying through the now
leafless park.</p>

<p>He stood still in the chill air, puzzled, to watch its
approach.</p>

<p>As it swept to a halt at the foot of the terrace steps, he made
out on its panels the arms of the Duke of Bourbon, and his wonder
was increased. The postilions drew rein, the single footman swung
himself to the ground to open the door and let down the step, and
then his amazement reached its climax as he watched Catherine
alight, followed by the two children.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood as if petrified. Then, when light and
lissom as a young girl she sprang up the steps, he roused himself,
and hurried halfway down to meet her. He caught her by the
shoulders and whilst she was between laughter and tears he showed
her a face that was drawn with pain.</p>

<p>"Catherine! Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"To bring you your passport," she answered lightly, as if it
were a jest.</p>

<p>"Was that necessary? Would not a courier have served?" His tone
was gently reproachful. "It was to spare us this--to spare both of
us--that I left without farewells. Now...Oh, but come in, come in.
It is cold and you will be tired. I will call Grandval."</p>

<p>Confused, bewildered, he moved towards the house, the children,
two well-grown striplings, clinging to him, one on each side, and
Catherine keeping pace with them. The footman followed with
valises.</p>

<p>She was telling him that the Duke of Bourbon, like a true
friend, of which few remained them, had sent his travelling
carriage as a parting gift to John Law. But to this, his mind in
travail, he scarcely gave heed.</p>

<p>The elderly Grandval and his buxom wife came hastening to meet
them and to take his orders.</p>

<p>At last, in the rather sombre hall of the château, with its
ponderous Louis XIII furnishings, the children having been carried
off in the care of Grandval's wife, he and Catherine faced each
other, and with a hand that shook she proffered him a parchment.
"The passport," she said, and her quivering voice broke on the
word, her eyes watched him anxiously.</p>

<p>He took it, and put her in a high-backed chair beside the
massive oak table. Infected by her malaise, he was at a loss for
words. "I think," he said at last, because he must say something,
"that you always loved Guermande. It is dull now. But in spring and
summer you know how beautiful it can be. I hope that you will be
happy here. If not, you can sell it. It is yours. It...it is all
that remained me in France, or anywhere. Not much after what has
been, what might have been. But..."</p>

<p>"Far more than I need. More than I want," she answered him. "It
is not only at this time of year that I should find it dull. Dull
and lonely. Very lonely." She rested her head against the back of
the chair, and closed her eyes as if in weariness of body and of
soul. She was very white, her travelling cloak had fallen open, and
under the muslin fichu her bosom rose and fell in deepening
agitation.</p>

<p>He considered her with wistful concern. "You are tired," he
said. "A glass of wine will revive you. Grandval will be bringing
it."</p>

<p>He unfolded the parchment, and to scan it in the fading daylight
he turned his back to a high window. An exclamation broke from him.
"Why, what is this? You are included here."</p>

<p>She spoke as if suffocating. "Is it not my right?"</p>

<p>"Your right!" He laughed. "But is it a right that you would wish
to claim at such a time?"</p>

<p>She sat up, and gathered strength. "The time above all entitled
me to claim it. That is why I have, myself, brought you the
passport. I do not choose to be left behind."</p>

<p>He stared at her, and saw the tears roll down a face that for
all its pallor preserved an odd composure. A strange gift hers, he
thought, to weep without grimacing.</p>

<p>"You told Will once," she went on, "that all that I loved in you
were the splendours you provided. It was the cruellest of many
cruel things you have thought of me, and the most unjust. I am here
to prove it." Then in a quickening tone, she asked him, as she had
asked him once before: "What splendours were yours when I came to
you in Amsterdam so many years ago? You were then a broken
proscribed fugitive, John, as you are now. I came to you then
because I thought that you must need a woman's breast to weep on.
And that is why I come to you now. But for your distress at this
ruin of your ambitions, I could thank God that it has overtaken us.
For it gives me this opportunity to prove your error." Very softly,
she ended: "If you want me, John, we will go on our travels
together again. If not..."</p>

<p>He sank to his knees beside her and put his head in her lap. He,
too, was weeping.</p>
