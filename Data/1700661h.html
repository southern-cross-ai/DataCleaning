  The Flask Which Held But A Drop</b></h2>
  <p>It  was the night before the wedding. Though Sinclair, and not myself, was the  happy man, I had my own causes for excitement, and, finding the heat of the  billiard-room insupportable, I sought the veranda for a solitary smoke in sight  of the ocean and a full moon.</p>
  <p>I  was in a condition of rapturous, if unreasoning, delight. That afternoon a  little hand had lingered in mine for just an instant longer than the  circumstances of the moment strictly required, and small as the favor may seem  to those who do not know Dorothy Camerden, to me, who realized fully both her  delicacy and pride, it was a sign that my long, if secret, devotion was about  to be rewarded and that at last I was free to cherish hopes whose alternative  had once bid fair to wreck the happiness of my life.</p>
  <p>I  was reveling in the felicity of these anticipations and contrasting this hour  of ardent hope with others of whose dissatisfaction and gloom I was yet  mindful, when a sudden shadow fell across the broad band of light issuing from  the library window, and Sinclair stepped out.</p>
  <p>He  had the appearance of being disturbed; very much disturbed, I thought, for a  man on the point of marrying the woman for whom he professed to entertain the  one profound passion of his life; but remembering his frequent causes of  annoyance&mdash;causes quite apart from his bride and her personal attributes&mdash;I kept  on placidly smoking till I felt his hand on my shoulder and turned to see that  the moment was a serious one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have something to say to you,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Come where we shall run less risk  of being disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  wrong?&rdquo; I asked, facing him with curiosity, if not with alarm. &ldquo;I never saw you  look like this before. Has the old lady taken this last minute to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  he prayed, emphasizing the word with a curt gesture not to be mistaken. &ldquo;The  little room over the west porch is empty just now. Follow me there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a sigh for the cigar I had so lately lighted I tossed it into the bushes and  sauntered in after him. I thought I understood his trouble. The prospective  bride was young&mdash;a mere slip of a girl, indeed&mdash;bright, beautiful and proud, yet  with odd little restraints in her manner and language, due probably to her  peculiar bringing up and the surprise, not yet overcome, of finding herself,  after an isolated, if not despised, childhood, the idol of society and the  recipient of general homage. The fault was not with her. But she had for  guardian (alas! my dear girl had the same) an aunt who was a gorgon. This aunt  must have been making herself disagreeable to the prospective bridegroom, and  he, being quick to take offense, quicker than myself, it was said, had probably  retorted in a way to make things unpleasant. As he was a guest in the house, he  and all the other members of the bridal party&mdash;(Mrs. Armstrong having insisted  upon opening her magnificent Newport villa for this wedding and its attendant  festivities), the matter might well look black to him. Yet I did not feel  disposed to take much interest in it, even though his case might be mine some  day, with all its accompanying drawbacks.</p>
  <p>But,  once confronted with Sinclair in the well-lighted room above, I perceived that I  had better drop all selfish regrets and give my full attention to what he had  to say. For his eye, which had flashed with an unusual light at dinner, was  clouded now, and his manner, when he strove to speak, betrayed a nervousness I  had considered foreign to his nature ever since the day I had seen him rein in  his horse so calmly on the extreme edge of a precipice where a fall would have  meant certain death not only to himself, but also to the two riders who  unwittingly were pressing closely behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walter,&rdquo;  he faltered, &ldquo;something has happened, something dreadful, something  unprecedented! You may think me a fool&mdash;God knows I would be glad to be proved  so, but this thing has frightened me. I&mdash;&rdquo; He paused and pulled himself  together. &ldquo;I will tell you about it, then you can judge for yourself. I am in  no condition to do so. I wonder if you will be when you hear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  beat about the bush. Speak up! What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  gave me an odd look full of gloom, a look I felt the force of, though I could  not interpret it; then coming closer, though there was no one within hearing,  possibly no one any nearer than the drawing-room below, he whispered in my ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have lost a little vial of the deadliest drug ever compounded; a Venetian  curiosity which I was foolish enough to take out and show the ladies, because  the little box which holds it is such an exquisite example of jewelers&rsquo; work.  There&rsquo;s death in its taste, almost in its smell; and it&rsquo;s out of my hands and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ll tell you how to fix that up,&rdquo; I put in, with my usual frank decision. &ldquo;Order  the music stopped; call everybody into the drawing-room and explain the  dangerous nature of this toy. After which, if anything happens, it will not be  your fault, but that of the person who has so thoughtlessly appropriated it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  eyes, which had been resting eagerly on mine, shifted aside in visible  embarrassment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!  It would only aggravate matters, or rather, would not relieve my fears at all.  The person who took it knew its nature very well, and that person&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  then you know who took it!&rdquo; I broke in, in increasing astonishment. &ldquo;I thought  from your manner that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he moodily corrected, &ldquo;I do not know who took it. If I did, I should not be  here. That is, I do not know the exact person. Only&mdash;&rdquo; Here he again eyed me  with his former singular intentness, and observing that I was nettled, made a  fresh beginning. &ldquo;When I came here, I brought with me a case of rarities chosen  from my various collections. In looking over them preparatory to making a present  to Gilbertine, I came across the little box I have just mentioned. It is made  of a single amethyst and contains&mdash;or so I was assured when I bought it&mdash;a tiny  flask of old but very deadly poison. How it came to be included with the other  precious and beautiful articles I had picked out for her <i>cadeau</i>, I can  not say; but there it was; and conceiving that the sight of it would please the  ladies, I carried it down into the library and, in an evil hour, called three  or four of those about me to inspect it. This was while you boys were in the  billiard-room, so the ladies could give their entire attention to the little  box which is certainly worth the most careful scrutiny.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was holding it out on the palm of my hand, where it burned with a purple light  which made more than one feminine eye glitter, when somebody inquired to what  use so small and yet so rich a receptacle could be put. The question was such a  natural one I never thought of evading it, besides, I enjoy the fearsome  delight which women take in the marvelous. Expecting no greater result than  lifted eyebrows or flushed cheeks, I answered by pressing a little spring in  the filigree-work surrounding the gem. Instantly, the tiniest of lids flew  back, revealing a crystal flask of such minute proportions that the usual  astonishment followed its disclosure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You  see!&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;it was made to hold <i>that</i>!&rsquo; And moving my hand to and fro  under the gas-jet, I caused to shine in their eyes the single drop of yellow  liquid it still held. &lsquo;Poison!&rsquo; I impressively announced. &lsquo;This trinket may  have adorned the bosom of a Borgia or flashed from the arm of some great  Venetian lady as she flourished her fan between her embittered heart and the  object of her wrath or jealousy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  first sentence had come naturally, but the last was spoken at random and almost  unconsciously. For at the utterance of the word &lsquo;poison,&rsquo; a quickly suppressed  cry had escaped the lips of some one behind me, which, while faint enough to  elude the attention of any ear less sensitive than my own, contained such an  astonishing, if involuntary, note of self-betrayal that my mind grew numb with  horror, and I stood staring at the fearful toy which had called up such a  revelation of&mdash;what? That is what I am here to ask, first of myself, then of  you. For the two women pressing behind me were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;  I sharply demanded, partaking in some indefinable way of his excitement and  alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gilbertine  Murray and Dorothy Camerden:&rdquo;&mdash;his prospective bride and the woman I loved and  whom he knew I loved, though I had kept my secret quite successfully from every  one else!</p>
  <p>The  look we exchanged neither of us will ever forget.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Describe  the sound!&rdquo; I presently said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I can only give you my impression of it. You, like  myself, fought in more than one skirmish in the Cuban War. Did you ever hear  the cry made by a wounded man when the cup of cool water for which he has long  agonized is brought suddenly before his eyes? Such a sound, with all that goes  to make it eloquent, did I hear from one of the two girls who leaned over my  shoulder. Can you understand this amazing, this unheard-of circumstance? Can  you name the woman, can you name the grief capable of making either of these  seemingly happy and innocent girls hail the sight of such a doubtful panacea with  an unconscious ebullition of joy? You would clear my wedding-eve of a great  dread if you could, for if this expression of concealed misery came from  Gilbertine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean,&rdquo; I cried in vehement protest, &ldquo;that you really are in doubt as to  which of these two women uttered the cry which so startled you? That you  positively can not tell whether it was Gilbertine or&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not; as God lives, I can not. I was too dazed, too confounded by the  unexpected circumstance, to turn at once, and when I did, it was to see both  pairs of eyes shining, and both faces dimpling with real or affected gaiety.  Indeed, if the matter had stopped there, I should have thought myself the  victim of some monstrous delusion; but when a half-hour later I found this box  missing from the cabinet where I had hastily thrust it at the peremptory  summons of our hostess, I knew that I had not misunderstood the nature of the  cry I had heard; that it was indeed one of secret longing, and that the hand  had simply taken what the heart desired. If a death occurs in this house  to-night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sinclair,  you are mad!&rdquo; I exclaimed with great violence. No lesser word would fit either  the intensity of my feeling or the confused state of my mind. &ldquo;Death <i>here</i>!  where all are so happy! Remember your bride&rsquo;s ingenuous face! Remember the  candid expression of Dorothy&rsquo;s eye&mdash;her smile&mdash;her noble ways! You exaggerate the  situation. You neither understand aright the simple expression of surprise you  heard, nor the feminine frolic which led these girls to carry off this romantic  specimen of Italian deviltry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are losing time,&rdquo; was his simple comment. &ldquo;Every minute we allow to pass in  inaction only brings the danger nearer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  You imagine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  imagine nothing. I simply know that one of these girls has in her possession  the means of terminating life in an instant; that the girl so having it is not  happy, and that if anything happens to-night it will be because we rested  supine in the face of a very real and possible danger. Now, as Gilbertine has  never given me reason to doubt either her affection for myself or her  satisfaction in our approaching union, I have allowed myself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  think that the object of your fears is Dorothy,&rdquo; I finished with a laugh I  vainly strove to make sarcastic.</p>
  <p>He  did not answer, and I stood battling with a dread I could neither conceal nor  avow. For preposterous as his idea was, reason told me that he had some grounds  for his doubt.</p>
  <p>Dorothy,  unlike Gilbertine Murray, was not to be read at a glance, and her trouble&mdash;for  she certainly had a trouble&mdash;was not one she chose to share with any one, even  with me. I had flattered myself in days gone by that I understood it well  enough, and that any lack of sincerity I might observe in her could be easily  explained by the position of dependence she held toward an irascible aunt. But  now that I forced myself to consider the matter carefully I could not but ask  if the varying moods by which I had found myself secretly harrowed had not  sprung from a very different cause&mdash;a cause for which my persistent love was  more to blame than the temper of her relative. The aversion she had once shown  to my attentions had yielded long ago to a shy, but seemingly sincere  appreciation of them, and gleams of what I was fain to call real feeling had  shown themselves now and then in her softened manner, culminating to-day in  that soft pressure of my hand which had awakened my hopes and made me forget  all the doubts and caprices of a disturbing courtship.</p>
  <p>But,  had I interpreted that strong, nervous pressure aright? Had it necessarily  meant love? Might it not have sprung from a sudden desperate resolution to  accept a devotion which offered her a way out of difficulties especially  galling to one of her gentle but lofty spirit? Her expression when she caught  my look of joy had little of the demure tenderness of a maiden blushing at her  first involuntary avowal. There was shrinking in it, but it was the shrinking  of a frightened woman, not of an abashed girl; and when I strove to follow her,  the gesture with which she waved me back had that in it which would have  alarmed a more exacting lover. Had I mistaken my darling&rsquo;s feelings? Was her  heart still cold, her affection unwon? Or&mdash;thought insupportable!&mdash;had she  secretly yielded to another what she had so long denied me and&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  quoth Sinclair at this juncture, &ldquo;I see that I have roused you at last.&rdquo; And  unconsciously his tone grew lighter and his eye lost the strained look which  had made it the eye of a stranger. &ldquo;You begin to see that a question of the  most serious import is before us, and that this question must be answered  before we separate for the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do,&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p>His  relief was evident.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  so much is gained. The next point is, how are we to settle our doubts? We can  not approach either of these ladies with questions. A girl wretched enough to  contemplate suicide would be especially careful to conceal both her misery and  its cause. Neither can we order a search made for an object so small that it  can be concealed about the person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  this jewel must be recovered. Listen, Sinclair. I will have a talk with  Dorothy, you with Gilbertine. A kind talk, mind you! one that will soothe, not  frighten. If a secret lurks in either breast our tenderness should find it out.  Only, as you love me, promise to show me the same frankness I here promise to  show you. Dear as Dorothy is to me, I swear to communicate to you the full  result of my conversation with her, whatever the cost to myself or even to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I will be equally fair as regards Gilbertine. But, before we proceed to such  extreme measures, let us make sure that there is no shorter road to the truth.  Some one may have seen which of our two dear girls went back to the library  after we all came out of it. That would narrow down our inquiry and save one of  them, at least, from unnecessary disturbance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a happy thought, and I told him so, but at the same time bade him look in  the glass and see how impossible it would be for him to venture below without  creating an alarm which might precipitate the dread event we both feared.</p>
  <p>He  replied by drawing me to his side before the mirror and pointing to my own  face. It was as pale as his own.</p>
  <p>Most  disagreeably impressed by this self-betrayal, I colored deeply under Sinclair&rsquo;s  eye and was but little, if any, relieved when I noticed that he colored under  mine. For his feelings were no enigma to me. Naturally he was glad to discover  that I shared his apprehensions, since it gave him leave to hope that the blow  he so dreaded was not necessarily directed toward his own affections. Yet,  being a generous fellow, he blushed to be detected in his egotism, while  I&mdash;well, I own that at that moment I should have felt a very unmixed joy at  being assured that the foundations of my own love were secure, and that the  tiny flask Sinclair had missed had not been taken by the hand of the one to  whom I looked for all my earthly happiness.</p>
  <p>And  my wedding-day was as yet a vague and distant hope, while his was set for the  morrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must carry down stairs very different faces from these,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;or we  shall be stopped before we reach the library.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  made an effort at composure, so did he; and both being determined men, we soon  found ourselves in a condition to descend among our friends without attracting  any closer attention than was naturally due him as prospective bridegroom and  myself as best man.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
    Beaton&rsquo;s Dream</b></h2>
  <p>Mrs.  Armstrong, our hostess, was fond of gaiety, and amusements were never lacking.  As we stepped down into the great hall we heard music in the drawing-room and  saw that a dance was in progress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is good,&rdquo; observed Sinclair. &ldquo;We shall run less risk of finding the library  occupied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I not look and see where the girls are? It would be a great relief to find them  both among the dancers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t allow yourself to be inveigled into joining them. I could  not stand the suspense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  nodded and slipped toward the drawing-room. He remained in the bay-window  overlooking the terrace.</p>
  <p>A  rush of young people greeted me as soon as I showed myself. But I was able to  elude them and catch the one full glimpse I wanted of the great room beyond. It  was a magnificent apartment, and so brilliantly lighted that every nook stood  revealed. On a divan near the center was a lady conversing with two gentlemen.  Her back was toward me, but I had no difficulty in recognizing Miss Murray.  Some distance from her, but with her face also turned away, stood Dorothy. She  was talking with an unmarried friend and appeared quite at ease and more than  usually cheerful.</p>
  <p>Relieved,  yet sorry that I had not succeeded in catching a glimpse of their faces, I  hastened back to Sinclair, who was watching me with furtive eyes from between  the curtains of the window in which he had secreted himself. As I joined him a  young man, who was to act as usher, sauntered from behind one of the great  pillars forming a colonnade down the hall, and, crossing to where the  music-room door stood invitingly open, disappeared behind it with the air of a  man perfectly contented with his surroundings.</p>
  <p>With  a nervous grip Sinclair seized me by the arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  that Beaton?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly;  didn&rsquo;t you recognize him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  gave me a very strange look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  the sight of him recall anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were at the breakfast-table yesterday morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you remember the dream he related for the delectation of such as would listen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  it was my turn to go white.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought at the time that it sounded more like a veritable adventure than a  dream; now I am sure that it was such.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sinclair!  You do not mean that the young girl he professed himself to have surprised one  moonlit night standing on the verge of the cliff, with arms upstretched and a  distracted air, was a real person?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. We laughed at the time; he made it seem so tragic and preposterous. I do  not feel like laughing now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  gazed at Sinclair in horror. The music was throbbing in our ears, and the  murmur of gay voices and swiftly moving feet suggested nothing but joy and  hilarity. Which was the dream? This scene of seeming mirth and happy promise,  or the fancies he had conjured up to rob us both of peace?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beaton  mentioned no names,&rdquo; I stubbornly protested. &ldquo;He did not even call the vision  he encountered a woman. It was a wraith, you remember, a dream-maiden, a  creature of his own imagination, born of some tragedy he had read.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beaton  is a gentleman,&rdquo; was Sinclair&rsquo;s cold reply. &ldquo;He did not wish to injure, but to  warn the woman for whose benefit he told his tale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Warn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  doubtless reasoned in this way. If he could make this young and probably  sensitive girl realize that she had been seen and her intentions recognized,  she would beware of such attempts in the future. He is a kind-hearted fellow.  Did you notice which end of the table he ignored when relating this dramatic  episode?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you had we might be better able to judge where his thoughts were. Probably you  can not even tell how the ladies took it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I never thought of looking. Good God! Sinclair, don&rsquo;t let us harrow up  ourselves unnecessarily! I saw them both a moment ago, and nothing in their  manner showed that anything was amiss with either of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  answer he drew me toward the library.</p>
  <p>This  room was not frequented by the young people at night. There were two or three  elderly people in the party, notably the husband and the brother of the lady of  the house, and to their use the room was more or less given up after nightfall.  Sinclair wished to show me the cabinet where the box had been.</p>
  <p>There  was a fire in the grate, for the evenings were now more or less chilly. When  the door had closed behind us we found that this same fire made all the light  there was in the room. Both gas-jets had been put out and the rich yet  home-like room glowed with ruddy hues, interspersed with great shadows. A  solitary scene, yet an enticing one.</p>
  <p>Sinclair  drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Mr. Armstrong must have gone elsewhere to read the evening  papers,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
  <p>I  replied by casting a scrutinizing look into the corners. I dreaded finding a  pair of lovers hid somewhere in the many nooks made by the jutting book-cases.  But I saw no one. However, at the other end of the large room there stood a  screen near one of the many lounges, and I was on the point of approaching this  place of concealment when Sinclair drew me toward a tall cabinet upon whose  glass doors the firelight was shimmering, and, pointing to a shelf far above  our heads, cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  woman could reach that unaided. Gilbertine is tall, but not tall enough for  that. I purposely put it high.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked about for a stool. There was one just behind Sinclair. I drew his  attention to it.</p>
  <p>He  flushed and gave it a kick, then shivered slightly and sat down in a near-by  chair. I knew what he was thinking. Gilbertine was taller than Dorothy. This  stool might have served Gilbertine if not Dorothy.</p>
  <p>I  felt a great sympathy for him. After all, his case was more serious than mine.  The bishop was coming to marry him the next day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sinclair,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;the stool means nothing. Dorothy has more inches than you think. With  this under her feet, she could reach the shelf by standing tiptoe. Besides,  there are the chairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  true!&rdquo; and he started up; &ldquo;there are the chairs! I forgot the chairs. I fear my  wits have gone wool-gathering. We shall have to take others into our  confidence.&rdquo; Here his voice fell to a whisper. &ldquo;Somehow or by some means we  must find out if either of them was seen to come into this room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  that to me,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Remember that a word might raise suspicion, and that in a  case like this&mdash;Halloo, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  gentle snore had come from behind the screen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are not alone,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;Some one is over there on the lounge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sinclair  had already bounded across the room. I pressed hurriedly behind him, and  together we rounded the screen and came upon the recumbent figure of Mr.  Armstrong, asleep on the lounge, with his paper fallen from his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  accounts for the lights being turned out,&rdquo; grumbled Sinclair. &ldquo;Dutton must have  done it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dutton  was the butler.</p>
  <p>I  stood contemplating the sleeping figure before me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must have been lying here for some time,&rdquo; I muttered.</p>
  <p>Sinclair  started.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably  some little while before he slept,&rdquo; I pursued. &ldquo;I have often heard that he  dotes on the firelight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a notion to wake him,&rdquo; suggested Sinclair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will not be necessary,&rdquo; said I, drawing back, as the heavy figure stirred,  breathed heavily and finally sat up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg pardon,&rdquo; I now entreated, backing politely away. &ldquo;We thought the room  empty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Armstrong, who, if slow to receive impressions, is far from lacking  intelligence, eyed us with sleepy indifference for a moment, then rose  ponderously to his feet and was, on the instant, the man of manner and  unfailing courtesy we had ever found him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can I do to oblige you?&rdquo; he asked; his smooth, if hesitating tones, sounding  strange to our excited ears.</p>
  <p>I  made haste to forestall Sinclair, who was racking his brains for words with  which to propound the question he dared not put too boldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, Mr. Armstrong, we were looking about for a small pin dropped by Miss  Camerden.&rdquo; (How hard it was for me to use her name in this connection only my  own heart knew.) &ldquo;She was in here just now, was she not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  courteous gentleman bowed, hawed, and smiled a very polite but unmeaning smile.  Evidently he had not the remotest notion whether she had been in or not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry, but I am afraid I lost myself for a moment on that lounge,&rdquo; he  admitted. &ldquo;The firelight always makes me sleepy. But if I can help you,&rdquo; he  cried, starting forward, but almost immediately pausing again and giving us  rather a curious look. &ldquo;Some one was in the room. I remember it now. It was  just before the warmth and glow of the fire became too much for me. I can not  say that it was Miss Camerden, however. I thought it was some one of quicker  movement. She made quite a rattle with the chairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  purposely did not look back at Sinclair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Murray?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Armstrong made one of his low, old-fashioned bows. This, I doubt not, was out  of deference to the bride-to-be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  Miss Murray wear white to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  muttered Sinclair, coming hastily forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it may have been she, for as I lay there deciding whether or not to yield to  the agreeable somnolence I felt creeping over me, I caught a glimpse of her  skirt as she passed out of the room. And that skirt was white&mdash;white silk, I  suppose you call it. It looked very pretty in the firelight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sinclair,  turning on his heel, stalked in a dazed way toward the door. To cover this show  of abruptness which was quite unusual on his part, I made the effort of my  life, and, remarking lightly, &ldquo;She must have been here looking for the pin her  friend has lost,&rdquo; I launched forth into an impromptu dissertation on one of the  subjects I knew to be dear to the heart of the bookworm before me, and kept it  up, too, till I saw by his brightening eye and suddenly freed manner that he  had forgotten the insignificant episode of a minute ago, never in all  probability to recall it again. Then I made another effort and released myself  with something like deftness from the long-drawn-out argument I saw impending,  and, making for the door in my turn, glanced about for Sinclair. So far as I  was concerned the question as to who had taken the box from the library was  settled.</p>
  <p>It  was now half-past eight. I made my way from room to room and from group to  group, looking for Sinclair. At last I returned to my old post near the library  door, and was instantly rewarded by the sight of his figure approaching from a  small side passage in company with the butler, Dutton. His face, as he stepped  into the full light of the open hall, showed discomposure, but not the extreme  distress I had anticipated. Somehow, at sight of it, I found myself seeking the  shadow just as he had done a short time before, and it was in one of the  recesses made by a row of bay trees that we came face to face.</p>
  <p>He  gave me one look, then his eyes dropped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Camerden has lost a pin from her hair,&rdquo; he impressively explained to me. Then  turning to Dutton he nonchalantly remarked. &ldquo;It must be somewhere in this hall;  perhaps you will be good enough to look for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  replied the man. &ldquo;I thought she had lost something when I saw her come out of  the library a little while ago holding her hand to her hair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  heart gave a leap, then sank cold and almost pulseless in my breast. In the hum  to which all sounds had sunk, I heard Sinclair&rsquo;s voice rise again in the  question with which my own mind was full.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  was that? After Mr. Armstrong went into the room, or before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  after he fell asleep. I had just come from putting out the gas when I saw Miss  Camerden slip in and almost immediately come out again. I will search for the  pin very carefully, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Mr. Armstrong had made a mistake! It was Dorothy and not Gilbertine whom he had  seen leaving the room. I braced myself up and met Sinclair&rsquo;s eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dorothy&rsquo;s  dress is gray to-night; but Mr. Armstrong&rsquo;s eye may not be very good for  colors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is possible that both were in the room,&rdquo; was Sinclair&rsquo;s reply. But I could see  that he advanced this theory solely out of consideration for me; that he did  not really believe it. &ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we can not prove anything  this way; we must revert to our original idea. I wonder if Gilbertine will give  me the chance to speak to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will have an easier task than I,&rdquo; was my half-sullen retort. &ldquo;If Dorothy  perceives that I wish to approach her she has but to lift her eyes to any of  the half-dozen fellows here, and the thing becomes impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is to be a rehearsal of the ceremony at half-past ten. I might get a word in  then; only, this matter must be settled first. I could never go through the  farce of standing up before you all at Gilbertine&rsquo;s side, with such a doubt as  this in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will see her before then. Insist on a moment&rsquo;s talk. If she refuses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  he here put in. &ldquo;We part now to meet in this same place again at ten. Do I look  fit to enter among the dancers? I see a whole group of them coming for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will in another moment. Approaching matrimony has made you sober, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was some time before I had the opportunity, even if I had the courage, to look  Dorothy in the face. When the moment came she was flushed with dancing and  looked beautiful. Ordinarily she was a little pale, but not even Gilbertine,  with her sumptuous coloring, showed a warmer cheek than she, as, resting from  the waltz, she leaned against the rose-tinted wall and let her eyes for the  first time rise slowly to where I stood talking mechanically to my partner.</p>
  <p>Gentle  eyes they were, made for appeal, and eloquent with a subdued heart language.  But they were held in check by an infinite discretion. Never have I caught them  quite off their guard, and to-night they were wholly unreadable. Yet she was  trembling with something more than the fervor of the dance, and the little hand  which had touched mine in lingering pressure a few hours before was not quiet  for a moment. I could not see it fluttering in and out of the folds of her smoke-colored  dress without a sickening wonder if the little purple box which was the cause  of my horror lay somewhere concealed amid the airy puffs and ruffles that rose  and fell so rapidly over her heaving breast. Could her eye rest on mine, even  in this cold and perfunctory manner, if the drop which could separate us for  ever lay concealed over her heart? She knew that I loved her. From the first  hour we met in her aunt&rsquo;s forbidding parlor in Thirty-sixth Street, she had  recognized my passion, however perfectly I had succeeded in concealing it from  others. Inexperienced as she was in those days, she had noted as quickly as any  society belle the effect produced upon me by her chill prettiness and her air  of meek reserve under which one felt the heart-break; and though she would  never openly acknowledge my homage and frowned down every attempt on my part at  lover-like speech or attention, I was as sure that she rated my feelings at  their real value, as that she was the dearest, yet most incomprehensible, mortal  my narrow world contained. When, therefore, I encountered her eyes at the end  of the dance I said to myself:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  may not love me, but she knows that I love her, and, being a woman of  sympathetic instincts, would never meet my eyes with so calm a look if she were  meditating an act which must infallibly plunge me into misery.&rdquo; Yet I was not  satisfied to go away without a word. So, taking the bull by the horns, I  excused myself to my partner, and crossed to Dorothy&rsquo;s side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you dance the next waltz with me?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>Her  eyes fell from mine directly and she drew back in a way that suggested flight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall dance no more to-night,&rdquo; said she, her hand rising in its nervous fashion  to her hair.</p>
  <p>I  made no appeal. I just watched that hand, whereupon she flushed vividly and  seemed more than ever anxious to escape. At which I spoke again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me a chance, Dorothy. If you will not dance come out on the veranda and look at  the ocean. It is glorious to-night. I will not keep you long. The lights here  trouble my eyes; besides, I am most anxious to ask you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; she vehemently objected, very much as if frightened. &ldquo;I can not leave the  drawing-room&mdash;do not ask me&mdash;seek some other partner&mdash;do, to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wish it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was panting, eager. I felt my heart sink and dreaded lest I should betray my  feelings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not honor me then with your regard,&rdquo; I retorted, bowing ceremoniously as I  became assured that we were attracting more attention than I considered  desirable.</p>
  <p>She  was silent. Her hand went again to her hair.</p>
  <p>I  changed my tone. Quietly, but with an emphasis which moved her in spite of  herself, I whispered: &ldquo;If I leave you now will you tell me to-morrow why you  are so peremptory with me to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  an eagerness which was anything but encouraging, she answered with suddenly  recovered gaiety:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, after all this excitement is over.&rdquo; And, slipping her hand into that of a  friend who was passing, she was soon in the whirl again and dancing&mdash;she who had  just assured me that she did not mean to dance again that night.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    A Scream In The Night</b></h2>
  <p>I  turned and, hardly conscious of my actions, stumbled from the room. A bevy of  young people at once surrounded me. What I said to them I hardly know. I only  remember that it was several minutes before I found myself again alone and  making for the little room into which Beaton had vanished a half-hour before.  It was the one given up to card-playing. Did I expect to find him seated at one  of the tables? Possibly; at all events I approached the doorway and was about  to enter when a heavy step shook the threshold before me and I found myself  confronted by the advancing figure of an elderly lady whose portrait it is now  time for me to draw. It is no pleasurable task, but one I can not escape.</p>
  <p>Imagine,  then, a broad, weighty woman of not much height, with a face whose features  were usually forgotten in the impression made by her great cheeks and falling  jowls. If the small eyes rested on you, you found them sinister and strange,  but if they were turned elsewhere, you asked in what lay the power of the face,  and sought in vain amid its long wrinkles and indeterminate lines for the  secret of that spiritual and bodily repulsion which the least look into this  impassive countenance was calculated to produce. She was a woman of immense  means, and an oppressive consciousness of this spoke in every movement of her  heavy frame, which always seemed to take up three times as much space as  rightfully belonged to any human creature. Add to this that she was seldom seen  without a display of diamonds which made her broad bust look like the bejeweled  breast of some Eastern idol, and some idea may be formed of this redoubtable  woman whom I have hitherto confined myself to speaking of as <i>the gorgon</i>.</p>
  <p>The  stare she gave me had something venomous and threatening in it. Evidently for  the moment I was out of her books, and while I did not understand in what way I  had displeased her, for we always had met amicably before, I seized upon this  sign of displeasure on her part as explanatory, perhaps, of the curtness and  show of contradictory feelings on the part of her dependent niece. Yet why  should the old woman frown on me? I had been told more than once that she  regarded me with great favor. Had I unwittingly done something to displease  her, or had the game of cards she had just left gone against her, ruffling her  temper and making it imperative for her to choose some object on which to vent  her spite? I entered the room to see. Two men and one woman stood in rather an  embarrassed silence about a table on which lay some cards, which had every  appearance of having been thrown down by an impatient hand. One of the men was  Will Beaton, and it was he who now remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has just found out that the young people are enjoying themselves. I wonder upon  which of her two unfortunate nieces she will expend her ill-temper to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  there&rsquo;s no question about that,&rdquo; remarked the lady who stood near him. &ldquo;Ever  since she has had a reasonable prospect of working Gilbertine off her hands,  she has devoted herself quite exclusively to her remaining burden. I hear,&rdquo; she  impulsively continued, craning her neck to be sure that the object of her  remarks was quite out of earshot, &ldquo;that the south hall was blue to-day with the  talk she gave Dorothy Camerden. No one knows what about, for the girl evidently  tries to please her. But some women have more than their own proper share of  bile; they must expend it on some one.&rdquo; And she in turn threw down her cards,  which up till now she had held in her hand.</p>
  <p>I  gave Beaton a look and stepped out on the veranda. In a minute he followed me,  and in the corner facing the ocean, where the vines cluster the thickest, we  held our conversation.</p>
  <p>I  began it, with a directness born of my desperation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beaton,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;we have not known each other long, but I recognize a man when I see  him, and I am disposed to be frank with you. I am in trouble. My affections are  engaged, deeply engaged, in a quarter where I find some mystery. You have  helped make it.&rdquo; (Here a gesture escaped him.) &ldquo;I allude to the story you  related the other morning of the young girl you had seen hanging over the verge  of the cliff, with every appearance of intending to throw herself over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was as a dream I related that,&rdquo; he gravely remarked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I am aware of. But it was no dream to me, Beaton. I fear I know that young  girl; I also fear that I know what drove her into contemplating so rash an act.  The conversation just held in the card-room should enlighten you. Beaton, am I  wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  feeling I could not suppress trembled in my tones. He may have been sensitive  to it or he may have been simply good-natured. Whatever the cause, this is what  he said in reply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a dream. Remember that I insist upon its being a dream. But some of its  details are very clear in my mind. When I stumbled upon this dream-maiden in  the moonlight her face was turned from me toward the ocean, and I did not see  her features then or afterwards. Startled by some sound I made, she crouched,  drew back and fled to cover. That cover, I have good reason to believe, was  this very house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  reached out my hand and touched him on the arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  dream-maiden was a woman?&rdquo; I inquired. &ldquo;One of the women now in this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  replied reluctantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was a young woman and she wore a long cloak. My dream ends there. I can not  even say whether she was fair or dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  recognized that he had reached the limit of his explanations, and, wringing his  hand, I started for the nearest window, which proved to be that of the  music-room. I was about to enter when I saw two women crossing to the opposite  doorway, and paused with a full heart to note them, for one was Mrs. Lansing  and the other Dorothy. The aunt had evidently come for the niece and they were  leaving the room together. Not amicably, however. Harsh words had passed, or I  am no judge of the human countenance. Dorothy especially bore herself like one  who finds difficulty in restraining herself from some unhappy outburst, and as  she disappeared from my sight in the wake of her formidable companion my  attention was again called to her hands, which she held clenched at her sides.</p>
  <p>I  was stepping into the room when my impulse was again checked. Another person  was sitting there, a person I had been most anxious to see ever since my last  interview with Sinclair. It was Gilbertine Murray, sitting alone in an attitude  of deep, and possibly not altogether happy thought.</p>
  <p>I  paused to study the sweet face. Truly she was a beautiful woman. I had never  before realized how beautiful. Her rich coloring, her noble traits and the  spirited air, which gave her such marked distinction, bespoke at once an ardent  nature and a pure soul.</p>
  <p>I  did not wonder that Sinclair had succumbed to charms so pronounced and  uncommon, and as I gazed longer and noted the tremulous droop of her ripe lips  and the faraway look of eyes which had created a great stir in the social world  when they first flashed upon it. I felt that if Sinclair could see her now he  would never doubt her again, despite the fact that the attitude into which she  had fallen was one of great fatigue, if not despondency.</p>
  <p>She  held a fan in her hand, and as I stood looking at her she dropped it. As she  stooped to pick it up, her eyes met mine, and a startling change passed over  her. Springing up, she held out her hands in wordless appeal&mdash;then let them drop  again as if conscious that I would not be likely to understand either herself  or her mood. She was very beautiful.</p>
  <p>Entering  the room, I approached her. Had Sinclair managed to have his little  conversation with her? Something must have happened, for never had I seen her  in such a state of suppressed excitement, and I had seen her many times, both  here and in her aunt&rsquo;s house when I was visiting Dorothy. Her eyes were  shining, not with a brilliant, but a soft light, and the smile with which she  met my advance had something in it strangely tremulous and expectant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to have a moment in which to speak to you alone,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;As Sinclair&rsquo;s  oldest and closest friend, I wish to tell you how truly you can rely both on  his affection and esteem. He has an infinitely good heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did not answer as brightly and as quickly as I expected. Something seemed to  choke her, something which she finally mastered, though only by an effort which  left her pale, but self-contained and even more lovely, if that is possible,  than before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; she then said, &ldquo;my prospects are very happy. No one but myself knows how  happy.&rdquo; And she smiled again, but with an expression which recalled to my mind  Sinclair&rsquo;s fears.</p>
  <p>I  bowed; some one was calling her name; evidently our interview was to be short.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am obliged,&rdquo; she murmured. Then quickly, &ldquo;I have not seen the moon to-night. Is  it beautiful? Can you see it from this veranda?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  before I could answer, she was surrounded and dragged off by a knot of young  people, and I was left free to keep my engagement with Sinclair.</p>
  <p>I  did not find him at his post nor could any one tell me where he had vanished.</p>
  <p>It  was plain that his conduct was looked upon as strange, and I felt some anxiety  lest it should appear more so before the evening was over. I found him at last  in his room sitting with his head buried in his arms. He started up as I  entered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  he asked sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have learned nothing decisive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  exchanged some words with both ladies and I tackled Beaton; but the matter  remains just about where it was. It may have been Dorothy who took the box and  it may have been Gilbertine. But there seems to be greater reason for  suspecting Dorothy. She lives a hell of a life with that aunt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Gilbertine is on the point of escaping that bondage. I know; I have thought of  that. Walter, you are a generous fellow;&rdquo; and for a moment Sinclair looked  relieved. Before I could speak, however, he was sunk again in his old  despondency. &ldquo;But the doubt,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the doubt! How can I go through this  rehearsal with such a doubt in my mind? I can not and will not. Go tell them I  am ill and can not come down again to-night. God knows you will tell no  untruth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  saw that he was quite beside himself, but ventured upon one remonstrance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be unwise to rouse comment,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If that box was taken for the death  it holds, the one restraint most likely to act upon the young girl who retains  it will be the conventionalities of her position and the requirements of the  hour. Any break in the settled order of things&mdash;anything which would give her a  moment by herself&mdash;might precipitate the dreadful event we fear. Remember, one  turn of the hand and all is lost. A drop is quickly swallowed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frightful!&rdquo;  he murmured, the perspiration oozing from his forehead. &ldquo;What a wedding-eve!  And they are laughing down there; listen to them. I even imagine I hear  Gilbertine&rsquo;s voice. Is there unconsciousness in it or just the hilarity of a  distracted mind bent on self-destruction? I can not tell; the sound conveys no  meaning to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has a sweet, true face,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and she wears a very beautiful smile  to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  sprang to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; a smile that maddens me; a smile that tells me nothing, nothing! Walter,  Walter, don&rsquo;t you see that, even if that cursed box remains unopened and  nothing ever comes of its theft, the seeds of distrust are sown thick in my  breast, and I must always ask: &lsquo;Was there a moment when my young bride shrank  from me enough to dream of death?&rsquo; That is why I can not go through the mockery  of this rehearsal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you go through the ceremony of marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must&mdash;if nothing happens to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  spoke involuntarily. I was thinking not of him, but of myself. But he evidently  found in my words an echo of his own thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it is the <i>then</i>,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Well may a man quail before that <i>then</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did go down stairs, however, and later on, went through the rehearsal very much  as I had expected him to do, quietly and without any outward show of emotion.</p>
  <p>As  soon as possible after this the company separated, Sinclair making me an  imperceptible gesture as he went up stairs. I knew what it meant, and was in  his room as soon as the fellows who accompanied him had left him alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  danger is from now on,&rdquo; he cried, as soon as I had closed the door behind me. &ldquo;I  shall not undress to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Happily  we both have rooms by ourselves in this great house. I shall put out my light  and then open my door as far as need be. Not a move in the house will escape  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will do the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gilbertine&mdash;God  be thanked&mdash;is not alone in her room. Little Miss Lane shares it with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Dorothy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she is under the strictest bondage night and day. She sleeps in a little room  off her aunt&rsquo;s. Do you know her door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  shook my head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will pass down the hall and stop an instant before the two doors we are most  interested in. When I pass Gilbertine&rsquo;s I will throw out my right hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  stood on the threshold of his room and watched him. When the two doors were  well fixed in my mind, I went to my own room and prepared for my self-imposed  watch. When quite ready, I put out my light. It was then eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>The  house was very quiet. There had been the usual bustle attending the separation  of a party of laughing, chattering girls for the night, but this had not lasted  long, for the great doings of the morrow called for bright eyes and fresh  cheeks, and these can only be gained by sleep. In this stillness twelve o&rsquo;clock  struck and the first hour of my anxious vigil was at an end. I thought of  Sinclair. He had given no token of the watch he was keeping, but I knew he was  sitting with his ear to the door, listening for the alarm which must come soon  if it came at all.</p>
  <p>But  would it come at all? Were we not wasting strength and a great deal of emotion  on a dread which had no foundation in fact? What were we two sensible and, as a  rule, practical men thinking of, that we should ascribe to either of these  dainty belles of a conventional and shallow society the wish to commit a deed  calling for the vigor and daring of some wilful child of nature? It was not to  be thought of in this sober, reasoning hour. We had given ourselves over to a  ghastly nightmare and would yet awake.</p>
  <p>Why  was I on my feet? Had I heard anything?</p>
  <p>Yes,  a stir, a very faint stir somewhere down the hall&mdash;the slow, cautious opening of  a door, then a footfall&mdash;or had I imagined the latter? I could hear nothing now.</p>
  <p>Pushing  open my own door, I looked cautiously out. Only the pale face of Sinclair  confronted me. He was peering from the corner of an adjacent passageway, the  moonlight at his back. Advancing, we met in silence. For the moment we seemed  to be the only persons awake in the vast house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought I heard a step,&rdquo; was my cautious whisper after a moment of intense  listening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  pointed toward that portion of the house where the ladies&rsquo; rooms were situated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is not what I heard,&rdquo; was his murmured protest, &ldquo;what I heard was a creak in  the small stairway running down at the end of the hall where my room is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of the servants,&rdquo; I ventured, and for a moment we stood irresolute. Then we  both turned rigid as some sound arose in one of the far-off rooms, only to  quickly relax again as that sound resolved itself into a murmur of muffled  voices. Where there was talking there could be no danger of the special event  we feared. Our relief was so great we both smiled. Next instant his face and, I  have no doubt, my own, turned the color of clay and Sinclair went reeling back  against the wall.</p>
  <p>A  scream had risen in this sleeping house&mdash;a piercing and insistent scream such as  raises the hair and curdles the blood.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
    What Sinclair Had To Show Me</b></h2>
  <p>This  scream seemed to come from the room where we had just heard voices. With a  common impulse, Sinclair and I both started down the hall, only to find  ourselves met by a dozen wild interrogations from behind as many quickly opened  doors. Was it fire? Had burglars got in? What was the matter? Who had uttered  that dreadful shriek? Alas! that was the question which we of all men were most  anxious to hear answered. Who? Gilbertine or Dorothy?</p>
  <p>Gilbertine&rsquo;s  door was reached first. In it stood a short, slight figure, wrapped in a  hastily-donned shawl. The white face looked into ours as we stopped, and we  recognized little Miss Lane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  has happened?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;It must have been an awful cry to waken everybody  so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  never thought of answering her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Gilbertine?&rdquo; demanded Sinclair, thrusting his hand out as if to put her  aside.</p>
  <p>She  drew herself up with sudden dignity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  bed,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It was she who told me that somebody had shrieked. I didn&rsquo;t  wake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sinclair  uttered a sigh of the greatest relief that ever burst from a man&rsquo;s overcharged  breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  her we will find out what it means,&rdquo; he replied kindly, drawing me rapidly  away.</p>
  <p>By  this time Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong were aroused, and I could hear the slow and  hesitating tones of the former in the passage behind us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us hasten,&rdquo; whispered Sinclair. &ldquo;Our eyes must be the first to see what lies  behind that partly-opened door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  shivered. The door he had designated was Dorothy&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>Sinclair  reached it first and pushed it open. Pressing up behind him, I cast a fearful  look over his shoulder. Only emptiness confronted us. Dorothy was not in the  little chamber. With an impulsive gesture Sinclair pointed to the bed&mdash;it had  not been lain in; then to the gas&mdash;it was still burning. The communicating room,  in which Mrs. Lansing slept, was also lighted, but silent as the one in which  we stood. This last struck us as the most incomprehensible fact of all. Mrs.  Lansing was not the woman to sleep through a disturbance. Where was she, then?  and why did we not hear her strident and aggressive tones rising in angry  remonstrance at our intrusion? Had she followed her niece from the room? Should  we in another minute encounter her ponderous figure in the group of people we  could now hear hurrying toward us? I was for retreating and hunting the house  over for Dorothy. But Sinclair, with truer instinct, drew me across the  threshold of this silent room.</p>
  <p>Well  was it for us that we entered there together, for I do not know how either of  us, weakened as we were by our forebodings and all the alarms of this  unprecedented night, could have borne alone the sight that awaited us.</p>
  <p>On  the bed situated at the right of the doorway lay a form&mdash;awful, ghastly, and  unspeakably repulsive. The head, which lay high but inert upon the pillow, was  surrounded with the gray hairs of age, and the eyes, which seemed to stare into  ours, were glassy with reflected light and not with inward intelligence. This  glassiness told the tale of the room&rsquo;s grim silence. It was death we looked on;  not the death we had anticipated and for which we were in a measure prepared,  but one fully as awful, and having for its victim not Dorothy Camerden nor even  Gilbertine Murray, but the heartless aunt, who had driven them both like  slaves, and who now lay facing the reward of her earthly deeds, <i>alone</i>.</p>
  <p>As  a realization of the awful truth came upon me, I stumbled against the bedpost,  looking on with almost blind eyes as Sinclair bent over the rapidly whitening  face, whose naturally ruddy color no one had ever before seen disturbed. And I  was still standing there when Mr. Armstrong and all the others came pouring in.  Nor have I any distinct remembrance of what was said or how I came to be in the  ante-chamber again. All thought, all consciousness even, seemed to forsake me,  and I did not really waken to my surroundings till some one near me whispered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Apoplexy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  I began to look about me and peer into the faces crowding up on every side, for  the only one which could give me back my self-possession. But though there were  many girlish countenances to be seen in the awestruck groups huddled in every  corner, I beheld no Dorothy, and was therefore but little astonished when in  another moment I heard the cry go up:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Dorothy? Where was she when her aunt died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alas!  there was no one there to answer, and the looks of those about, which hitherto  had expressed little save awe and fright, turned to wonder, and more than one  person left the room as if to look for her. I did not join them. I was rooted  to the place. Nor did Sinclair stir a foot, though his eye, which had been  wandering restlessly over the faces about him, now settled inquiringly on the  doorway. For whom was he looking? Gilbertine or Dorothy? Gilbertine, no doubt,  for he visibly brightened as her figure presently appeared clad in a <i>neglig&eacute;e</i>,  which emphasized her height and gave to her whole appearance a womanly sobriety  unusual to it.</p>
  <p>She  had evidently been told what had occurred, for she asked no questions, only  leaned in still horror against the door-post, with her eyes fixed on the room  within. Sinclair, advancing, held out his arm. She gave no sign of seeing it.  Then he spoke. This seemed to rouse her, for she gave him a grateful look,  though she did not take his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  will be no wedding to-morrow,&rdquo; fell from her lips in self-communing murmur.</p>
  <p>Only  a few minutes had passed since they had started to find Dorothy, but it seemed  an age to me. My body remained in the room, but my mind was searching the house  for the girl I loved. Where was she hidden? Would she be found huddled but  alive in some far-off chamber? Or was another and more dreadful tragedy awaiting  us? I wondered that I could not join the search. I wondered that even  Gilbertine&rsquo;s presence could keep Sinclair from doing so. Didn&rsquo;t he know what,  in all probability, this missing girl had with her? Didn&rsquo;t he know what I had  suffered, was suffering&mdash;ah, what now? She is coming! I can hear them speaking  to her. Gilbertine moves from the door, and a young man and woman enter with  Dorothy between them.</p>
  <p>But  what a Dorothy! Years could have made no greater change in her. She looked and  she moved like one who is done with life, yet fears the few remaining moments  left her. Instinctively we fell back before her; instinctively we followed her  with our eyes as, reeling a little at the door, she cast a look of  inconceivable shrinking, first at her own bed, then at the group of older  people watching her with serious looks from the room beyond. As she did so I  noted that she was still clad in her evening dress of gray, and that there was  no more color on cheek or lip than in the neutral tints of her gown.</p>
  <p>Was  it our consciousness of the relief which Mrs. Lansing&rsquo;s death, horrible as it  was, must bring to this unhappy girl and of the inappropriateness of any  display of grief on her part, which caused the silence with which we saw her  pass with forced step and dread anticipation into the room where that image of  dead virulence awaited her? Impossible to tell. I could not read my own  thoughts. How, then, the thoughts of others!</p>
  <p>But  thoughts, if we had any, all fled when, after one slow turn of her head toward  the bed, this trembling young girl gave a choking shriek and fell, face down,  on the floor. Evidently she had not been prepared for the look which made her  aunt&rsquo;s still face so horrible. How could she have been? Had it not imprinted  itself upon my mind as the one revolting vision of my life? How, then, if this  young and tender-hearted girl had been insensible to it! As her form struck the  floor Mr. Armstrong rushed forward; I had not the right. But it was not by his  arms she was lifted. Sinclair was before him, and it was with a singularly  determined look I could not understand and which made us all fall back, that he  raised her and carried her in to her own bed, where he laid her gently down.  Then, as if not content with this simple attention, he hovered over her for a moment  arranging the pillows and smoothing her disheveled hair. When at last he left  her, the women rushed forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  too many of you,&rdquo; was his final adjuration, as, giving me a look, he slipped  out into the hall.</p>
  <p>I  followed him immediately. He had gained the moon-lighted corridor near his own  door, where he stood awaiting me with something in his hand. As I approached,  he drew me to the window and showed me what it was. It was the amethyst box,  open and empty, and beside it, shining with a yellow instead of a purple light,  the little vial void of the one drop which used to sparkle within it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  found the vial in the bed with the old woman,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The box I saw  glittering among Dorothy&rsquo;s locks before she fell. That was why I lifted her.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    Three O&rsquo;clock In The Morning</b></h2>
  <p>As  he spoke, youth with its brilliant hopes, illusions and beliefs passed from me,  never to return in the same measure again. I stared at the glimmering amethyst,  I stared at the empty vial and, as a full realization of all his words implied  seized my benumbed faculties, I felt the icy chill of some grisly horror moving  among the roots of my hair, lifting it on my forehead and filling my whole  being with shrinking and dismay.</p>
  <p>Sinclair,  with a quick movement, replaced the tiny flask in its old receptacle, and then  thrusting the whole out of sight, seized my hand and wrung it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am your friend,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Remember, under all circumstances and in every  exigency, your friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to do with <i>those</i>?&rdquo; I demanded when I regained control of  my speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to do with&mdash;with Dorothy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  drooped his head; I could see his fingers working in the moonlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  physicians will soon be here. I heard the telephone going a few minutes ago.  When they have pronounced the old woman dead we will give the&mdash;the lady you  mention an opportunity to explain herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Explain  herself, she! Simple expectation. Unconsciously I shook my head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the least we can do,&rdquo; he gently persisted. &ldquo;Come, we must not be seen with  our heads together&mdash;not yet. I am sorry that we two were found more or less  dressed at the time of the alarm. It may cause comment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was dressed, too,&rdquo; I murmured, as much to myself as to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,  yes,&rdquo; was the muttered reply, with which he drew off and hastened into the  hall, where the now thoroughly-aroused household stood in a great group about  the excited hostess.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Armstrong was not the woman for an emergency. With streaming hair and  tightly-clutched kimono, she was gesticulating wildly and bemoaning the break  in the festivities which this event must necessarily cause. As Sinclair  approached, she turned her tirade on him, and as all stood still to listen and  add such words of sympathy or disappointment as suggested themselves in the  excitement of the moment, I had an opportunity to note that neither of the two  girls most interested was within sight. This troubled me. Drawing up to the  outside of the circle, I asked Beaton, who was nearest to me, if he knew how  Miss Camerden was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better,  I hear. Poor girl, it was a great shock to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  ventured nothing more. The conventionality of his tone was not to be mistaken.  Our conversation on the veranda was to be ignored. I did not know whether to  feel relief at this or an added distress. I was in a whirl of emotion which  robbed me of all discrimination. As I realized my own condition, I concluded  that my wisest move would be to withdraw myself for a time from every eye.  Accordingly, and at the risk of offending more than one pretty girl who still  had something to say concerning this terrible mischance, I slid away to my  room, happy to escape the murmurs and snatches of talk rising on every side.  One bitter speech, uttered by I do not know whom, rang in my ears and made all  thinking unendurable. It was this:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  woman! she was angry once too often. I heard her scolding Dorothy again after  she went to her room. That is why Dorothy is so overcome. She says it was the  violence of her aunt&rsquo;s rage which killed her,&mdash;a rage of which she unfortunately  was the cause.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  there were words again between these two after the door closed upon them for  the night! Was this what we heard just before that scream went up? It would  seem so. Thereupon, quite against my will, I found myself thinking of Dorothy&rsquo;s  changed position before the world. Only yesterday a dependent slave; to-day,  the owner of millions. Gilbertine would have her share, a large one, but there  was enough to make them both wealthy. Intolerable thought! Would that no money  had been involved! I hated to think of those diamonds and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Oh,  anything was better than this! Dashing from my room I joined one of the groups  into which the single large circle had now broken up. The house had been  lighted from end to end, and some effort had been made at a more respectable  appearance by such persons as I now saw; some even were fully dressed. All were  engaged in discussing the one great topic. Listening and not listening, I  waited for the front door bell to ring. It sounded while one woman was saying to  another:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Sinclairs will now be able to take their honeymoon on their own yacht.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  made my way to where I could watch Sinclair while the physicians were in the  room. I thought his face looked very noble. The narrowness of his own escape,  the sympathy for me which the event, so much worse than either of us  anticipated, had awakened in his generous breast, had called out all that was  best in his naturally reserved and not-always-to-be-understood nature. A tower  of strength he was to me that hour. I knew that mercy and mercy only would  influence his conduct. He would be guilty of no rash or inconsiderate act. He  would give this young girl a chance.</p>
  <p>Therefore  when the physicians had pronounced the case one of apoplexy (a conclusion most  natural under the circumstances), and the excitement which had held together  the various groups of uneasy guests had begun to subside, it was with perfect  confidence I saw him approach and address Gilbertine. She was standing fully  dressed at the stairhead, where she had stopped to hold some conversation with  the retiring physicians; and the look she gave him in return and the way she  moved off in obedience to his command or suggestion assured me that he was  laying plans for an interview with Dorothy. Consequently I was quite ready to  obey him when he finally stepped up to me and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  below, and if you find the library empty, as I have no doubt you will, light  one gas-jet and see that the door to the conservatory is unlocked. I require a  place in which to make Gilbertine comfortable while I have some words with her  cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how will you be able to influence Miss Camerden to come down?&rdquo; Somehow, the  familiar name of Dorothy would not pass my lips. &ldquo;Do you think she will  recognize your right to summon her to an interview?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had never seen his lip take that firm line before, yet I had always known him  to be a man of great resolution.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how can you reach her? She is shut up in her own room, under the care, I am  told, of Mrs. Armstrong&rsquo;s maid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, but she will escape that dreadful place as soon as her feet will carry  her. I shall wait in the hall till she is seen to enter it, then I will say &lsquo;Come!&rsquo;  and she will come, attended by Gilbertine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I? Do you mean me to be present at an interview so painful, nay, so serious and  so threatening? It would cut short every word you hope to hear. I&mdash;can not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not asked you to. It is imperative that I should see Miss Camerden alone.&rdquo;  (He could not call her Dorothy, either.) &ldquo;I shall ask Gilbertine to accompany us,  so that appearances may be preserved. I want you to be able to inform any one  who approaches the door that you saw me go in there with Miss Murray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I am to stay in the hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will be so kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  clock struck three.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is very late,&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Why not wait till morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  have the whole house about our ears? No. Besides, some things will not keep an  hour, a moment. I must hear what this young girl has to say in response to my  questions. Remember, I am the owner of the flask whose contents killed the old  woman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  believe she died from swallowing that drop?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  said no more, but hastened down stairs to do his bidding.</p>
  <p>I  found the lower hall partly lighted, but none of the rooms.</p>
  <p>Entering  the library, I lit the gas as Sinclair had requested. Then I tried the  conservatory door. It was unlocked. Casting a sharp glance around, I made sure  that the lounges were all unoccupied and that I could safely leave Sinclair to  hold his contemplated interview without fear of interruption. Then, dreading a  premature arrival on his part, I slid quickly out and moved down the hall to  where the light of the one burning jet failed to penetrate. &ldquo;I will watch from  here,&rdquo; thought I, and entered upon the quick pacing of the floor which my impatience  and the overwrought condition of my nerves demanded.</p>
  <p>But  before I had turned on my steps more than half a dozen times, the single but  brilliant ray coming from some half-open door in the rear caught my eye, and I  had the curiosity to step back and see if any one was sharing my watch. In  doing so I came upon the little spiral staircase which, earlier in the evening,  Sinclair had heard creak under some unknown footstep. Had this footstep been  Dorothy&rsquo;s, and if so, what had brought her into this remote portion of the  house? Fear? Anguish? Remorse? A flying from herself or from <i>it</i>? I  wished I knew just where she had been found by the two young persons who had  brought her back into her aunt&rsquo;s room. No one had volunteered the information,  and I had not seen the moment when I felt myself in a position to demand it.</p>
  <p>Proceeding  further, I stood amazed at my own forgetfulness. The light which had attracted  my attention came from the room devoted to the display of Miss Murray&rsquo;s  wedding-gifts. This I should have known instantly, having had a hand in their  arrangement. But all my faculties were dulled that night, save such as  responded to dread and horror. Before going back I paused to look at the  detective whose business it was to guard the room. He was sitting very quietly  at his post, and if he saw me he did not look up. Strange that I had forgotten  this man when keeping my own vigil above. I doubted if Sinclair had remembered  him either. Yet he must have been unconsciously sharing our watch from start to  finish; must even have heard the cry as only a waking man could hear it. Should  I ask him if this was so? No. Perhaps I had not the courage to hear his answer.</p>
  <p>Shortly  after my return into the main hall I heard steps on the grand staircase.  Looking up, I saw the two girls descending, followed by Sinclair. He had been  successful, then, in inducing Dorothy to come down. What would be the result?  Could I stand the suspense of the impending interview?</p>
  <p>As  they stepped within the rays of the solitary gas-jet already mentioned, I cast  one quick look into Gilbertine&rsquo;s face, then a long one into Dorothy&rsquo;s. I could  read neither. If it was horror and horror only which rendered both so pale and  fixed of feature, then their emotion was similar in character and intensity.  But if in either breast the one dominant sentiment was fear&mdash;horrible,  blood-curdling fear&mdash;then was that fear confined to Dorothy; for while  Gilbertine advanced bravely, Dorothy&rsquo;s steps lagged, and at the point where she  should have turned into the library, she whirled sharply about and made as if  she would fly back up stairs.</p>
  <p>But  one stare from Gilbertine, one word from Sinclair, recalled her to herself and  she passed in and the door closed upon the three. I was left to prevent  possible intrusion and to eat out my heart in intolerable suspense.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
    Dorothy Speaks</b></h2>
  <p>I  shall not subject you to the ordeal from which I suffered. You shall follow my  three friends into the room. According to Sinclair&rsquo;s description, the interview  proceeded thus:</p>
  <p>As  soon as the door had closed upon them, and before either of the girls had a  chance to speak, he remarked to Gilbertine:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have brought you here because I wish to express to you, in the presence of your  cousin, my sympathy for the bereavement which in an instant has robbed you both  of a lifelong guardian. I also wish to say in the light of this sad event, that  I am ready, if propriety so exacts, to postpone the ceremony which I hoped  would unite our lives to-day. Your wish shall be my wish, Gilbertine; though I  would suggest that possibly you never more needed the sympathy and protection  which only a husband can give than you do to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  told me afterward that he was so taken up with the effect of this suggestion on  Gilbertine that he forgot to look at Dorothy, though the hint he strove to  convey of impending trouble was meant as much for her as for his affianced  bride. In another moment he regretted this, especially when he saw that Dorothy  had changed her attitude and was now looking away from them both.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you say, Gilbertine?&rdquo; he asked earnestly, as she sat flushing and paling  before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.  I have not thought&mdash;it is a question for others to decide&mdash;others who know what  is right better than I. I appreciate your consideration,&rdquo; she suddenly burst  out&mdash;&ldquo;and should be glad to tell you at this moment what to expect; but&mdash;give me  a little time&mdash;let me see you later&mdash;in the morning, Mr. Sinclair, after we are  all somewhat rested and when I can see you quite alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dorothy  rose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I go?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>Sinclair  advanced and with quiet protest, touched her on the shoulder. Quietly she sank  back into her seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to say a half-dozen words to you, Miss Camerden. Gilbertine will pardon  us; it is about matters which must be settled to-night. There are decisions to  arrive at and arrangements to be made. Mrs. Armstrong has instructed me to  question you in regard to these, as the one best acquainted with Mrs. Lansing&rsquo;s  affairs and general tastes. We will not trouble Gilbertine. She has her own  decisions to reach. Dear, will you let me make you comfortable in the  conservatory while I talk for five minutes with Dorothy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  said she met this question with a look so blank and uncomprehending that he  just lifted her and carried her in among the palms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must speak to Dorothy,&rdquo; he pleaded, placing her in the chair where he had often  seen her sit of her own accord. &ldquo;Be a good girl; I will not keep you here long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why can not I go to my room? I do not understand&mdash;I am frightened&mdash;what have you  to say to Dorothy you can not say to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  seemed so excited that for a minute, just a minute, he faltered in his purpose.  Then he took her gravely by the hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have told you,&rdquo; said he. Then he kissed her softly on the forehead. &ldquo;Be quiet,  dear, and rest. See! here are roses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  plucked and flung a handful into her lap. Then he crossed back to the library  and shut the conservatory door behind him. I am not surprised that Gilbertine  wondered at her peremptory bridegroom.</p>
  <p>When  Sinclair re&euml;ntered the library, he found Dorothy standing with her hand on the  knob of the door leading into the hall. Her head was bent and thoughtful, as  though she were inwardly debating whether to stand her ground or fly. Sinclair  gave her no further opportunity for hesitation. Advancing rapidly, he laid his hand  quietly on hers, and with a gravity which must have impressed her, quietly  remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must ask you to stay and hear what I have to say. I wished to spare Gilbertine;  would that I could spare you. But circumstances forbid. You know and I know  that your aunt did not die of apoplexy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave a violent start and her lips parted. If the hand under his clasp had been  cold, it was now icy. He let his own slip from the contact.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know!&rdquo; she echoed, trembling and pallid, her released hand flying instinctively  to her hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  you need not feel about for the little box. I took it from its hiding-place  when I laid you fainting on the bed. Here it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  drew it from his pocket and showed it to her. She hardly glanced at it; her  eyes were fixed in terror on his face and her lips seemed to be trying in vain  to formulate some inquiry.</p>
  <p>He  tried to be merciful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  missed it many hours ago, from the shelf yonder where you all saw me place it.  Had I known that you had taken it, I would have repeated to you how deadly were  the contents, and how dangerous it was to handle the vial or to let others  handle it, much less to put it to the lips.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  started and instinctively her form rose to its full height.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you looked in that little box since you took it from my hair?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you know it to be empty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  answer he pressed the spring, and the little lid flew open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not empty now, you see.&rdquo; Then more slowly and with infinite meaning, &ldquo;But  the little flask is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  brought her hands together and faced him with a noble dignity which at once put  the interview on a different footing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was this vial found?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
  <p>He  found it difficult to answer. They seemed to have exchanged positions. When he  did speak it was in a low tone and with less confidence than he had shown  before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the bed with the old lady. I saw it there myself. Mr. Worthington was with me.  Nobody else knows anything about it. I wished to give you an opportunity to  explain. I begin to think you can&mdash;but how, God only knows. The box was hidden  in your hair from early evening. I saw your hand continually fluttering toward  it all the time we were dancing in the parlor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did not lose an iota of her dignity or pride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I put it there as soon as I took it from the cabinet. I  could think of no safer hiding-place. Yes, I took it,&rdquo; she acknowledged as she  saw the flush rise to his cheek. &ldquo;I took it; but with no worse motive than the  dishonest one of having for my own an object which bewitched me; I was hardly  myself when I snatched it from the shelf and thrust it into my hair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stared at her in amazement, her confession and her attitude so completely  contradicted each other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I had nothing to do with the vial,&rdquo; she went on. And with this declaration her  whole manner, even her voice changed, as if with the utterance of these few  words she had satisfied some inner demand of self-respect and could now enter  into the sufferings of those about her. &ldquo;This I think it right to make plain to  you. I supposed the vial to be in the box when I took it, but when I got to my  room and had an opportunity to examine the deadly trinket, I found it empty,  just as you found it when you took it from my hair. Some one had taken the vial  out before my hand had ever touched the box.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Like  a man who feels himself suddenly seized by the throat, yet who struggles for  the life slowly but inexorably leaving him, Sinclair cast one heartrending look  toward the conservatory, then heavily demanded:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  were you out of your room? Why did they have to look for you? <i>And who was  the person who uttered that scream?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  confronted him sadly, but with an earnestness he could not but respect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was not in the room because I was troubled by my discovery. I think I had some  idea of returning the box to the shelf from which I had taken it. At all  events, I found myself on the little staircase in the rear when that cry rang  through the house. I do not know who uttered it; I only know that it did not  spring from my lips.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  a rush of renewed hope he seized her by the hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was your aunt!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;It was she who took the vial out of the box; who  put it to her own lips; who shrieked when she felt her vitals gripped. Had you  stayed you would have known this. Can&rsquo;t you say so? Don&rsquo;t you think so? Why do  you look at me with those incredulous eyes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you must not believe a lie. Because you are too good a man to be sacrificed. It  was a younger throat than my aunt&rsquo;s which gave utterance to that shriek. Mr.  Sinclair, be advised; <i>do not be married to-morrow</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  I was pacing the hall without in a delirium of suspense. I tried hard to keep  within the bounds of silence. I had turned for the fiftieth time to face that  library door, when suddenly I heard a hoarse cry break from within and saw the  door fly open and Dorothy come hurrying out. She shrank when she saw me, but  seemed grateful that I did not attempt to stop her, and soon was up the stairs  and out of sight. I rushed at once into the library.</p>
  <p>I  found Sinclair sitting before a table with his head buried in his hands. In an  instant I knew that our positions were again reversed and, without stopping to  give heed to my own sensations, I approached him as near as I dared and laid my  hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>He  shuddered but did not look up, and it was minutes before he spoke. Then it all  came in a rush.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fool!  fool that I was! And I saw that she was consumed by fright the moment it became  plain that I was intent upon having some conversation with Dorothy. Her fingers  where they gripped my arm must have left marks behind them. But I saw only  womanly nervousness where a man less blind would have detected guilt. Walter, I  wish that the mere scent of this empty flask would kill. Then I should not have  to re&euml;nter that conservatory door&mdash;or look again in her face, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had taken out the cursed jewel and was fingering it in a nervous way which went  to my heart of hearts. Gently removing it from his hand, I asked with all the  calmness possible:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is all this mystery? Why have your suspicions returned to Gilbertine? I thought  you had entirely dissociated her with this matter and that you blamed Dorothy  and Dorothy only, for the amethyst&rsquo;s loss?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dorothy  had the empty box; but the vial! the vial!&mdash;that had been taken by a previous  hand. Do you remember the white silk train which Mr. Armstrong saw slipping  from this room? I can not talk, Walter; my duty leads me <i>there</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  pointed toward the conservatory. I drew back and asked if I should take up my  watch again outside the door.</p>
  <p>He  shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  makes no difference; nothing makes any difference. But if you want to please  me, stay here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  at once sank into a chair. He made a great effort and advanced to the  conservatory door. I studiously looked another way; my heart was breaking with  sympathy for him.</p>
  <p>But  in another instant I was on my feet. I could hear him rushing about among the  palms. Presently I heard his voice shout out the wild cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is gone! I forgot there was another door communicating with the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  crossed the floor and entered where he stood gazing down at an empty seat and a  trail of scattered roses. Never shall I forget his face. The dimness of the  spot could not hide his deep, unspeakable emotions. To him this flight bore but  one interpretation&mdash;guilt.</p>
  <p>I  did not advocate Sinclair&rsquo;s pressing the matter further that night. I saw that  he was exhausted and that any further movement would tax him beyond his  strength. We therefore separated immediately after leaving the library, and I  found my way to my own room alone. It may seem callous in me, but I fell asleep  very soon after, and did not wake till roused by a knock at my door. On opening  it I confronted Sinclair, looking haggard and unkempt. As he entered, the first  clear notes of the breakfast-bell could be heard rising up from the lower hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not slept,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have been walking the hall all night, listening by  spells at her door, and at other times giving what counsel I could to the  Armstrongs. God forgive me, but I have said nothing to any one of what has made  this affair an awful tragedy to me! Do you think I did wrong? I waited to give  Dorothy a chance. Why should I not show the same consideration to Gilbertine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should.&rdquo; But our eyes did not meet, and neither voice expressed the least hope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not go to breakfast,&rdquo; he now declared. &ldquo;I have written this line to  Gilbertine. Will you see that she gets it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  reply I held out my hand. He placed the note in it, and I was touched to see  that it was unsealed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  sure, when you give it to her, that she will have an opportunity of reading it  alone. I shall request the use of one of the little reception-rooms this  morning. Let her come there if she is so impelled. She will find a friend as  well as a judge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  endeavored to express sympathy, urge patience and suggest hope. But he had no  ear for words, though he tried to listen, poor fellow! so I soon stopped and he  presently left the room. I immediately made myself as presentable as a night of  unprecedented emotions would allow, and went below to do him such service as  opportunity offered and the exigencies of the case permitted.</p>
  <p>I  found the lower hall alive with eager guests and a few outsiders. News of the  sad event was slowly making its way through the avenue, and some of the  Armstrongs&rsquo; nearest neighbors had left their breakfast-tables to express their  interest and to hear the particulars. Among these stood the lady of the house;  but Mr. Armstrong was nowhere within sight. For him the breakfast waited. Not  wishing to be caught in any little swirl of conventional comment, I remained  near the staircase waiting for some one to descend who could give me news  concerning Miss Murray. For I had small expectation of her braving the eyes of  these strangers, and doubted if even Dorothy would be seen at the breakfast-table.  But little Miss Lane, if small, was gifted with a great appetite. She would be  sure to appear prior to the last summons, and as we were good friends, she  would listen to my questions and give me the answer I needed for the carrying  out of Sinclair&rsquo;s wishes. But before her light footfall was heard descending I  was lured from my plans by an unexpected series of events. Three men came down,  one after the other, followed by Mr. Armstrong, looking even more grave and  ponderous than usual. Two of them were the physicians who had been called in  the night and whom I had myself seen depart somewhere near three o&rsquo;clock. The  third I did not know, but he looked like a doctor also. Why were they here  again so early? Had anything new come to light?</p>
  <p>It  was a question which seemed to strike others as well as myself. As Mr.  Armstrong ushered them down the hall and out of the front door, many were the  curious glances which followed them, and it was with difficulty that the  courteous host on his return escaped the questions and detaining hands of some  of his more inquisitive guests. A pleasant word, an amiable smile he had for  all, but I was quite certain when I saw him disappear into the little room he  retained for his own use that he had told them nothing which could in any way  relieve their curiosity.</p>
  <p>This  filled me with a vague alarm. Something must have occurred&mdash;something which  Sinclair ought to know. I felt a great anxiety and was closely watching the  door behind which Mr. Armstrong had vanished when it suddenly opened and I  perceived that he had been writing a telegram. As he gave it to one of the  servants he made a gesture to the man standing with extended hand by the  Chinese gong, and the summons rang out for breakfast. Instantly the hum of  voices ceased, and young and old turned toward the dining-room, but the host  did not enter with them. Before the younger and more active of his guests could  reach his side he had slid into the room which I have before described as set  apart for the display of Gilbertine&rsquo;s wedding-presents. Instantly I lost all  inclination for breakfast and lingered about in the hall until every one had  passed me, even little Miss Lane, who had come down unperceived while I was  watching Mr. Armstrong&rsquo;s door. Not very well pleased with myself for having  missed the one opportunity which might have been of service to me, I was asking  myself whether I should follow her and make the best attempt I could at  sociability if not at eating, when Mr. Armstrong approached from the side hall,  and, accosting me, inquired if Mr. Sinclair had come down yet.</p>
  <p>I  assured him that I had not seen him and did not think he meant to come to  breakfast, adding that he had been very much affected by the affairs of the  night, and had told me that he was going to shut himself up in his room and  rest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry, but there is a question I must ask him immediately. It is about a  little Italian trinket which I am told he displayed to the ladies yesterday  afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
    Constraint</b></h2>
  <p>So!  our dreadful secret was not confined to ourselves as we had supposed, but was  shared or at least suspected, by our host.</p>
  <p>Thankful  that it was I, rather than Sinclair, who was called upon to meet and sustain  this shock, I answered with what calmness I could:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  Sinclair mentioned the matter to me. Indeed, if you have any curiosity on the  subject, I think I can enlighten you as fully as he can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Armstrong glanced up the stairs, hesitated, then drew me into his private room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  find myself in a very uncomfortable position,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;A strange and quite  unaccountable change has shown itself in the appearance of Mrs. Lansing&rsquo;s body  during the last few hours; a change which baffles the physicians and raises in  their minds very unfortunate conjectures. What I want to know is whether Mr.  Sinclair still has in his possession the box which is said to hold a vial of  deadly poison, or whether it has passed into any other hand since he showed it  to certain ladies in the library.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  were standing directly in the light of an eastern window. Deception was impossible,  even if I had felt like employing it. In Sinclair&rsquo;s interests, if not in my  own, I resolved to be as true to our host as our positions demanded, yet, at  the same time, to save Gilbertine as much as possible from premature if not  final suspicion.</p>
  <p>I  therefore replied: &ldquo;That is a question I can answer as well as Sinclair.&rdquo;  (Happy was I to save him this cross-examination.) &ldquo;While he was showing this  toy, Mrs. Armstrong came into the room and proposed a stroll, which drew all of  the ladies from the room and called for his attendance as well. With no thought  of the danger involved, he placed the trinket on a high shelf in the cabinet,  and went out with the rest. When he came back for it, it was gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  usually ruddy aspect of my host&rsquo;s face deepened, and he sat down in the great  armchair which did duty before his writing-table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is dreadful,&rdquo; was his comment, &ldquo;entailing I do not know what unfortunate  consequences upon this household and on the unhappy girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Girl?&rdquo;  I repeated.</p>
  <p>He  turned upon me with great gravity. &ldquo;Mr. Worthington, I am sorry to have to  admit it, but something strange, something not easily explainable, took place  in this house last night. It has only just come to light; otherwise, the  doctors&rsquo; conclusions might have been different. You know there is a detective  in the house. The presents are valuable and I thought best to have a man here  to look after them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  nodded; I had no breath for speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  man tells me,&rdquo; continued Mr. Armstrong, &ldquo;that just a few minutes previous to  the time the whole household was aroused last night, he heard a step in the  hall overhead, then the sound of a light foot descending the little staircase  in the servants&rsquo; hall. Being anxious to find out what this person wanted at an  hour so late, he lowered the gas, closed his door and listened. The steps went  by his door. Satisfied that it was a woman he heard, he pulled open the door  again and looked out. A young girl was standing not very far from him in a thin  streak of moonlight. She was gazing intently at something in her hand, and that  something had a purple gleam to it. He is ready to swear to this. Next moment,  frightened by some noise she heard, she fled back and vanished again in the  region of the little staircase. It was soon, very soon after this that the  shriek came. Now, Mr. Worthington, what am I to do with this knowledge? I have  advised this man to hold his peace till I can make inquiries, but where am I to  make them? I can not think that Miss Camerden&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  ejaculation which escaped me was involuntary. To hear her name for the second  time in this association was more than I could bear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he say it was Miss Camerden?&rdquo; I hurriedly inquired as he looked at me in some  surprise. &ldquo;How should he know Miss Camerden?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  described her,&rdquo; was the unanswerable reply. &ldquo;Besides, we know that she was  circulating in the halls at that time. I declare I have never known a worse  business,&rdquo; this amiable man bemoaned. &ldquo;Let me send for Sinclair; he is more  interested than any one else in Gilbertine&rsquo;s relatives; or stay, what if I  should send for Miss Camerden herself? She should be able to tell how she came  by this box.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  subdued my own instincts, which were all for clearing Dorothy on the spot, and  answered as I thought Sinclair would like me to answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a serious and very perplexing piece of business,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but if you will  wait a short time I do not think you will have to trouble Miss Camerden. I am  sure that explanations will be given. Give the lady a chance,&rdquo; I stammered. &ldquo;Imagine  what her feelings would be if questioned on so delicate a topic. It would make  a breach which nothing could heal. Later, if she does not speak, it will be  only right for you to ask her why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did not come down this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I could take counsel of my wife! But she is of too nervous a temperament. I am  anxious to keep her from knowing this fresh complication as long as possible.  Do you think I can look for Miss Camerden to explain herself before the doctors  return, or before Mrs. Lansing&rsquo;s physician, for whom I have telegraphed, can  arrive from New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure that three hours will not pass before you hear the truth. Leave me to  work out the situation. I promise that if I can not bring it about to your  satisfaction, Sinclair shall be asked to lend his assistance. Only keep the  gossips from Miss Camerden&rsquo;s good name. Words can be said in a moment that will  not be forgotten in years. I tremble at such a prospect for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one knows of her being seen with the box,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Every one probably  knows by this time that there is some doubt felt as to the cause of Mrs.  Lansing&rsquo;s death. You can not keep a suspicion of this nature secret in a house  so full of people as this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  knew it, but, relieved by his manner if not by his words, I took my leave of  him for the present and made my way at once to the dining-room. Should I find  Miss Lane there? Yes, and what was more, the fortunes of the day had decreed  that the place beside her should be unoccupied.</p>
  <p>I  was on my way to that place when I was struck by the extreme quiet into which  the room had fallen. It had been humming with talk when I first entered; but  now not a voice was raised, and scarcely an eye. In the hurried glance I cast  about the board, not a look met mine in recognition or welcome.</p>
  <p>What  did it mean? Had they been talking about me? Possibly; and in a way, it would  seem, that was not altogether flattering to my vanity.</p>
  <p>Unable  to hide my sense of the general embarrassment which my presence had called  forth, I passed to the seat I have indicated and let my inquiring look settle  on Miss Lane. She was staring in imitation of the others straight into her  plate, but as I saluted her with a quiet good morning, she looked up and  acknowledged my courtesy with a faint, almost sympathetic, smile. At once the  whole tableful broke again into chatter, and I could safely put the question  with which my mind was full.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  is Miss Murray?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I do not see her here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you expect to? Poor Gilbertine! This is not the bridal day she expected.&rdquo; Then,  with irresistible na&iuml;vet&eacute; entirely in keeping with her fairy-like figure and  girlish face, she added: &ldquo;I think it was just horrid in the old woman to die  the night before the wedding; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  I do,&rdquo; I emphatically rejoined, humoring her in the hope of learning what I  wished to know. &ldquo;Does Miss Murray still cherish the expectation of being  married to-day? No one seems to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  do I. I haven&rsquo;t seen her since the middle of the night. She didn&rsquo;t come back to  her room. They say she is sobbing out her terror and disappointment in some  attic corner. Think of that for Gilbertine Murray! But even that is better  than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sentence trailed away into an indistinguishable murmur; the murmur into  silence. Was it because of a fresh lull in the conversation about us? I hardly  think so, for though the talk was presently resumed, she remained silent, not  even giving the least sign of wishing to prolong this particular topic. I  finished my coffee as soon as possible and quitted the room, but not before  many had preceded me. The hall was consequently as full as before of a  gossiping crowd.</p>
  <p>I  was on the point of bowing myself through the various groups blocking my way to  the library door, when I noticed renewed signs of embarrassment on all the  faces turned my way. Women who were clustered about the newel-post drew back,  and some others sauntered away into side rooms with an appearance of suddenly  wishing to go somewhere. This certainly was very singular, especially as these  marks of disapproval did not seem to be directed so much at myself as at some  one behind me. Who could this some one be? Turning quickly, I cast a glance up  the staircase before which I stood and saw the figure of a young girl dressed  in black hesitating on the landing. This young girl was Dorothy Camerden, and  it took but a moment&rsquo;s contemplation of the scene for me to feel assured that  it was against her this feeling of universal constraint had been directed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
    Gilbertine Speaks</b></h2>
  <p>Knowing  my darling&rsquo;s innocence, I felt the insult shown her in my heart of hearts, and  might in the heat of the moment have been betrayed into an unwise utterance of  my indignation, if at that moment I had not encountered the eye of Mr.  Armstrong, fixed on me from the rear hall. In the mingled surprise and distress  he displayed, I saw that it was not from any indiscretion of his that this  feeling against her had started. He had not betrayed the trust I had placed in  him, yet the murmur had gone about which virtually ostracized her, and instead  of confronting the eager looks of friends, she found herself met by averted  glances and coldly turned backs, and soon by an almost empty hall.</p>
  <p>She  flushed as she realized the effect of her presence and cast me an agonized  look, which, without her expectation, perhaps, roused every instinct of  chivalry within me. Advancing, I met her at the foot of the stairs, and with  one quick word seemed to restore her to herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  patient!&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;To-morrow they will be all around you again. Perhaps  sooner. Go into the conservatory and wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave me a grateful pressure of the hand, while I bounded up stairs, determined  that nothing should stop me from finding Gilbertine and giving her the letter  with which Sinclair had intrusted me.</p>
  <p>But  this was more easily planned than accomplished. When I had reached the third  floor (an unaccustomed and strange spot for me to find myself in) I at first  found no one who could tell me to which room Miss Murray had retired. Then,  when I did come across a stray housemaid and she, with an extraordinary stare,  had pointed out the door, I found it quite impossible to gain any response from  within, though I could hear a quick step moving restlessly to and fro and now  and then catch the sound of a smothered sob or low cry. The wretched girl would  not heed me, though I told her who I was and that I had a letter from Mr.  Sinclair in my hand. Indeed, she presently became perfectly quiet and let me  knock again and again, till the situation became ridiculous and I felt obliged  to draw off.</p>
  <p>Not  that I thought of yielding. No, I would stay there till her own fancy drove her  to open the door, or till Mr. Armstrong should come up and force it. A woman  upon whom so many interests depended would not be allowed to remain shut up the  whole morning. Her position as a possible bride forbade it. Guilty or innocent,  she must show herself before long. As if in answer to my expectation, a figure  appeared at this very moment at the other end of the hall. It was Dutton, the  butler, and in his hand he held a telegram. He seemed astonished to see me  there, but passed me with a simple bow and stopped before the door I had so  unavailingly assailed a few minutes before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  telegram, miss,&rdquo; he shouted, as no answer was made to his knock. &ldquo;Mr. Armstrong  asked me to bring it to you. It is from the bishop and calls for an immediate  reply.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a stir within, but the door did not open. Meanwhile, I had sealed and  thrust forth the letter I had held concealed in my breast pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  her this, too,&rdquo; I signified, and pointed to the crack under the door.</p>
  <p>He  took the letter, laid the telegram on it, and pushed them both in. Then he  stood up and eyed the unresponsive panels with the set look of a man who does  not easily yield his purpose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will wait for the answer,&rdquo; he shouted through the keyhole, and falling back he  took up his stand against the opposite wall.</p>
  <p>I  could not keep him company there. Withdrawing into a big dormer window, I  waited with beating heart to see if her door would open. Apparently not, yet as  I still lingered, I heard the lock turn, followed by the sound of a measured  but hurried step. Dashing from my retreat, I reached the main hall in time to  see Miss Murray disappear toward the staircase. This was well, and I was about  to follow when, to my astonishment, I perceived Dutton standing in the doorway  she had just left, staring down at the floor with a puzzled look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  didn&rsquo;t pick up the letters,&rdquo; he cried, in amazement. &ldquo;She just walked over  them. What shall I do now? It&rsquo;s the strangest thing I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  them to the little boudoir over the porch,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Mr. Sinclair is there  and if she is not on her way to join him now she certainly will be soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  a word Dutton caught up the letters and made for the stairs.</p>
  <p>Left  to await the result, I found myself so worked upon that I wondered how much  longer I should find myself able to endure these shifts of feeling and  constantly recurring moments of extreme suspense. To escape the torture of my  own thoughts, or, possibly, to get some idea of how Dorothy was sustaining an  ordeal which was fast destroying my own self-possession, I prepared to go down  stairs. What was my astonishment in passing the little boudoir on the second  floor, to find its door ajar and the place empty. Either the interview between  Sinclair and Gilbertine had been very much curtailed, or it had not yet taken  place. With a heart heavy with forebodings I no longer sought to analyze, I  made my way down and reached the lower step of the great staircase just as a  half-dozen girls, rushing from different quarters of the hall, surrounded the  heavy form of Mr. Armstrong coming from his own little room.</p>
  <p>Their  questions made a small hubbub. With a good-natured gesture, he put them all  back and, raising his voice, said to the assembled crowd:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has been decided by Miss Murray that, under the circumstances, it will be wiser  for her to postpone the celebration of her marriage to some time and place less  fraught with mournful suggestions. A telegram has just been sent to the bishop  to that effect, and while we all suffer from this disappointment, I am sure  there is no one here who will not see the propriety of her decision.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he finished, Gilbertine appeared behind him. At the same moment I caught, or  thought I did, the flash of Sinclair&rsquo;s eye from the recesses of the room  beyond; but I could not stop to make sure of this, for Gilbertine&rsquo;s look and  manner were such as to draw my full attention, and it was with a mixture of  almost inexplicable emotions that I saw her thread her way among her friends,  in a state of high feeling which made her blind to their outstretched hands and  deaf to the murmur of interest and sympathy which instinctively followed her.  She was making for the stairs, and whatever her thoughts, whatever the state of  her mind, she moved superbly, in her pale, yet seemingly radiant abstraction. I  watched her, fascinated, yet when she left the last group and began to cross  the small square of carpet which alone separated us, I stepped down and aside,  feeling that to meet her eye just then without knowing what had passed between  her and Sinclair would be cruel to her and well-nigh unbearable to myself.</p>
  <p>She  saw the movement and seemed to hesitate an instant, then she turned for one  brief instant in my direction, and I saw her smile. Great God! it was the smile  of innocence. Fleeting as it was, the pride that was in it, the sweet assertion  and the joy were unmistakable. I felt like springing to Sinclair&rsquo;s side in the  gladness of my relief, but there was no time; another door had opened down the hall,  another person had stepped upon the scene, and Miss Murray, as well as myself,  recognized by the hush which at once fell upon every one present that something  of still more startling import awaited us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Armstrong and ladies!&rdquo; said this stranger (I knew he was a stranger by the  studied formality of the former&rsquo;s bow). &ldquo;I have made a few inquiries since I  came here a short time ago, and I find that there is one young lady in the  house who ought to be able to tell me better than any one else under what  circumstances Mrs. Lansing breathed her last. I allude to her niece, who slept  in the adjoining room. Is that young lady here? Her name, if I remember  rightly, is Camerden&mdash;Miss Dorothy Camerden.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  movement as of denial passed from group to group down the hall, and, while no  one glanced toward the library and some did glance up stairs, I felt the dart  of sudden fear&mdash;or was it hope&mdash;that Dorothy, hearing her name called, would  leave the conservatory and proudly confront the speaker in face of this whole suspicious  throng. But no Dorothy appeared. On the contrary, it was Gilbertine who turned,  and with an air of authority for which no one was prepared, asked in tones  vibrating with feeling:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  this gentleman the official right to question who was and who was not with my  aunt when she died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Armstrong, who showed his surprise as ingenuously as he did every other  emotion, glanced up at the light figure hovering over them from the staircase  and made out to answer:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  gentleman has every right, Miss Murray. He is the coroner of the town,  accustomed to inquire into all cases of sudden death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  she vehemently rejoined, her pale cheeks breaking out into a scarlet flush,  above which her eyes shone with an almost unearthly brilliancy, &ldquo;do not summon  Dorothy Camerden. She is not the witness you want. I am. I am the one who  uttered that scream; I am the one who saw our aunt die. Dorothy can not tell  you what took place in her room and at her bedside, for Dorothy was not there;  but <i>I</i> can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Amazed,  not as others were, at the assertion itself, but at the manner and publicity of  the utterance, I contemplated this surprising girl in ever-increasing wonder.  Always beautiful, always spirited and proud, she looked at that moment as if  nothing in the shape of fear, or even contumely, could touch her. She faced the  astonishment of her best friends with absolute fearlessness, and before the  general murmur could break into words, added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feel it my duty to speak thus publicly, because, by keeping silent so long, I  have allowed a false impression to go about. Stunned with terror, I found it  impossible to speak during that first shock. Besides, I was in a measure to  blame for the catastrophe itself and lacked courage to own it. It was I who  took the little crystal flask into my aunt&rsquo;s room. I had been fascinated by it  from the first, fascinated enough to long to see it closer and to hold it in my  hand. But I was ashamed of this fascination, ashamed, I mean, to have any one  know that I could be moved by such a childish impulse; so, instead of taking  the box itself, which might easily be missed, I simply abstracted the tiny  vial. It strikes me now as a very strange thing for me to do, but then it  seemed a natural enough impulse; and it was with a feeling of decided satisfaction  I carried this coveted object about with me till I got to my room. Then, when  the house was quiet and my room-mate asleep, I took it out and looked at it,  and feeling an irresistible desire to share my amusement with my cousin, I  stole to her room by means of the connecting balcony, just as I had done many  times before when our aunt was in bed and asleep. But unlike any previous  occasion, I found the room empty. Dorothy was not there; but as the light was  burning high I knew she would soon be back and so ventured to step in.  Instantly, I heard my aunt&rsquo;s voice. She was awake and wanted something. She had  evidently called before, for her voice was sharp with impatience, and she used  some very harsh words. When she heard me in Dorothy&rsquo;s room, she shouted again,  and, as I have always been accustomed to obey her commands, I hastened to her  side, with the little vial concealed in my hand. As she had expected to see  Dorothy and not me, she rose up in unreasoning anger, asking where my cousin  was and why I was not in bed. I attempted to answer her, but she would not  listen to me and bade me turn up the gas, which I did. Then with her eyes fixed  on mine as though she knew I was trying to conceal something from her, she  commanded me to rearrange her hair and make her more comfortable. This I could  not do with the tiny flask still in my hand, so with a quick movement, which I  hoped would pass unobserved, I slid it behind some bottles standing on a table  by the bedside, and bent to do what she required. But to attempt to escape her  eye was useless. She had seen my action and at once began to feel about for  what I had attempted to hide from her. Coming in contact with the tiny flask,  she seized it, and with a smile I shall never forget held it up between us. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s  this?&rsquo; she cried, showing such astonishment at its minuteness and perfection of  shape that it was immediately apparent she had heard nothing of the amethyst  box displayed by Mr. Sinclair in the library. &lsquo;I never saw a bottle as small as  this before. What is in it and why were you so afraid of my seeing it?&rsquo; As she  spoke, she attempted to wrench out the stopper. It stuck, so I was in hopes she  would fail in the effort, but she was a woman of uncommon strength and  presently it yielded and I saw the vial open in her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aghast  with terror, I caught at the table beside me, fearing to drop before her eyes.  Instantly, her look of curiosity changed to one of suspicion, and repeating, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s  in it? What&rsquo;s in it?&rsquo; she raised the flask to her nostrils, and when she found  she could make out nothing from the smell, lowered it to her lips, with the  intention, I suppose, of determining its contents by tasting them. As I caught  sight of this fatal action, and beheld the one drop, which Mr. Sinclair had  said was enough to kill a man, slip from its hiding-place of centuries into her  open throat, I felt as if the poison had entered my own veins; I could neither  speak nor move. But when, an instant later, I met the look which spread  suddenly over her face&mdash;a look of horror and hatred, accusing horror and  unspeakable hatred mingled with what I dimly felt must mean death&mdash;an agonized  cry burst from my lips, after which, panicstricken, I flew as if for life, back  by the way I had come, to my own room. This was a great mistake. I should have  remained with my aunt and boldly met the results of the tragedy which my folly  had brought about. But terror knows no law, and having once yielded to the  instinct of concealment, I knew no other course than to continue to maintain an  apparent ignorance of what had just occurred. With chattering teeth and an  awful numbness at my heart, I tore off my wrapper and slid into bed. Miss Lane  had not wakened, but every one else had and the hall was full of people. This  terrified me still more, and for the moment I felt that I could never own the  truth and bring down upon myself all this wonder and curiosity. So I allowed a  wrong impression of the event to go about, for which act of cowardice I now ask  the pardon of every one here, as I have already asked that of Mr. Sinclair and  of our kind friend, Mr. Armstrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  paused, and stood for a moment confronting us all with proud eyes and flaming  cheeks, then amid a hubbub which did not seem to affect her in the least, she  stepped down, and approaching the man who, she had been told, had a right to  her full confidence, she said, loud enough for all who wished to hear her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am ready to give you whatever further information you may require. Shall I step  into the drawing-room with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  bowed and as they disappeared from the great hall the hubbub of voices became  tumultuous.</p>
  <p>Naturally  I should have joined in the universal expressions of surprise and the gossip  incident to such an unexpected revelation. But I found myself averse to any  kind of talk. Till I could meet Sinclair&rsquo;s eye and discern in it the happy  clearing-up of all his doubts, I should not feel free to be my own ordinary and  sociable self again. But Sinclair showed every evidence of wishing to keep in  the background, and while this was natural enough, so far as people in general  were concerned, I thought it odd and very unlike him not to give me an  opportunity to express my congratulations at the turn affairs had taken and the  frank attitude assumed by Gilbertine. I own I felt much disturbed by this neglect,  and as the minutes passed and he failed to appear, I found my satisfaction in  her explanations dwindle under the consciousness that they had failed, in some  respects, to account for the situation; and before I knew it, I was the prey of  fresh doubts which I did my best to smother, not only for the sake of Sinclair,  but because I was still too much under the influence of Gilbertine&rsquo;s imposing  personality to wish to believe aught but what her burning words conveyed. She  must have spoken the truth, but was it the entire truth? I hated myself for  asking the question; hated myself for being more critical with her than I had  been with Dorothy, who certainly had not made her own part in this tragedy as  clear as one who loved her could wish. Ah, Dorothy! it was time some one told  her that Gilbertine had openly vindicated her and that she could now come forth  and face her friends without hesitation and without dread. Was she still in the  conservatory? Doubtless. But it would be better perhaps for me to make sure.</p>
  <p>Approaching  the place by the small door connecting it with the hall-way in which I stood, I  took a hurried look within, and, seeing no one, stepped boldly down between the  palms to the little nook where lovers of this quiet spot were accustomed to  sit. It was empty, and so was the library beyond. Coming back, I accosted  Dutton, whom I found superintending the removal of the potted plants which  encumbered the passages, and asked him if he knew where Miss Camerden was? He  answered without hesitation that she had stood in the rear hall a little while  before, listening to Miss Murray; that she had then gone up stairs by the  spiral staircase, leaving word with him that if anybody wanted her she would be  found in the small boudoir over the porch.</p>
  <p>I  thanked him and was on my way to join her, when Mr. Armstrong called me. He  must have kept me a half-hour in his room, discussing every aspect of the  affair and apologizing for the necessity which he now felt for bidding farewell  to most of his guests, among whom, he was careful to state, he did not include  me. Then, when I thought this topic exhausted, he began to talk about his wife,  and what this dreadful occurrence was to her and how he despaired of ever  reconciling her to the fact that it had been considered necessary to call in a  coroner. Then he spoke of Sinclair, but with some constraint and a more careful  choice of words, at which, realizing that I was to reap nothing from this  interview, only suffer strong and continual irritation at a delay which was  costing me the inestimable privilege of being the first to tell Dorothy of her  re&euml;stablishment in every one&rsquo;s good opinion, I exerted myself for release and  to such good purpose that I presently found myself again in the hall, where the  first person I ran against was Sinclair.</p>
  <p>He  started and so did I at this unexpected encounter. Then we stood still, and I  stared at him in amazement, for everything about the man was changed,  and&mdash;inexplicable fact!&mdash;in nothing was this change more marked than in his  attitude toward myself. Yet he tried to be friendly and meet me on the old  footing, and observed as soon as we found ourselves beyond the hearing of  others:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard what Gilbertine said. There is no reason for doubting her words. <i>I</i> do not doubt them and you will show yourself my friend by not doubting them  either.&rdquo; Then with some impetuosity and a gleam in his eye quite foreign to its  natural expression, he pursued, with a pitiful effort to speak dispassionately:  &ldquo;Our wedding is postponed&mdash;indefinitely. There are reasons why this seemed best  to Miss Murray. To you, I will say, that postponed nuptials seldom culminate in  marriage. In fact, I have just released Miss Murray from all obligations to  myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  stare of utter astonishment I gave him called up a flush, the first and only  one I have ever seen on his face. What was I to say, what could I say, in  response to such a declaration, following so immediately upon his warm  assertion of her innocence? Nothing. With that indefinable chill between us,  which had come I knew not how, I felt tongue-tied.</p>
  <p>He  saw my embarrassment, possibly my emotion, for he smiled somewhat bitterly and  put a step or so between us before he remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Murray has my good wishes. Out of respect to her position I shall show her a  friend&rsquo;s attention while we remain in this house. That is all I have to say,  Walter. You and I have held our last conversation on this subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was gone before I had sufficiently recovered to realize that in this  conversation I had had no part, neither had it contained any explanation of the  very facts which had once formed our greatest grounds for doubt, namely, Beaton&rsquo;s  dream, the smothered cry uttered behind Sinclair&rsquo;s shoulder when he first made  known the deadly qualities of the little vial, and lastly, the strange desire  acknowledged to by both these young ladies to touch and hold an object  calculated rather to repel than to attract the normal feminine heart.</p>
  <p>At  every previous stage of this ever-shifting drama, my instinct had been to set  my wits against the facts, and, if I could, puzzle out the mystery. But I felt  no such temptation now. My one desire was to act, and that immediately.  Dorothy, for all Gilbertine&rsquo;s intimation to the contrary, held the key to the  enigma in her own breast. Otherwise, she would not have ventured upon that  surprising and necessarily unpalatable advice to Sinclair&mdash;an advice he seemed  to have followed&mdash;not to marry Gilbertine Murray at the time proposed. Nothing,  short of a secret acquaintanceship with facts unknown as yet to the rest of us,  could have nerved her to such an act.</p>
  <p>My  one hope, then, of understanding the matter lay with her. To seek her at once  in the place where I had been told she awaited me seemed the only course to  take. If any real gratitude underlay the look of trust which she had given me  at the termination of our last interview, she would reward my confidence in her  by unbosoming herself to me.</p>
  <p>I  was at the door of the boudoir immediately upon forming this resolution.  Finding it ajar, I pushed it softly open, and as softly entered. To my  astonishment, the place was very dark. Not only had the shades been drawn down,  but the shutters had been closed, so that it was with difficulty I detected the  slight, black-robed figure which lay, face down, among the cushions of a lounge.  She had evidently not heard my entrance, for she did not move; and, struck by  her pathetic attitude, I advanced in a whirl of feeling which made me forget  all conventionalities and everything else, in fact, but that I loved her and  had the utmost confidence in her power to make me happy. Laying my hand softly  on her head, I tenderly whispered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  up, dear. Whatever barrier may have intervened between us has fallen. Look up  and hear how I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  thrilled as a woman only thrills when her secret soul is moved, and, rising  with a certain grand movement, turned her face upon me, glorious with a feeling  that not even the dimness of the room could hide.</p>
  <p>Why,  then, did my brain whirl and my heart collapse?</p>
  <p>It  was Gilbertine and not Dorothy who stood before me.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    In The Little Boudoir</b></h2>
  <p>Never  had a suspicion crossed my mind of any such explanation of our secret troubles.  I had seen as much of one cousin as the other in my visits to Mrs. Lansing&rsquo;s  house, but Gilbertine being from the first day of our acquaintance engaged to  my friend Sinclair, I naturally did not presume to study her face for any signs  of interest in myself, even if my sudden and uncontrollable passion for Dorothy  had left me the heart to do so. Yet now, in the light of her unmistakable  smile, of her beaming eyes from which all troublous thoughts seemed to have  fled for ever, a thousand recollections forced themselves upon my attention  which not only made me bewail my own blindness, but which served to explain the  peculiar attitude always maintained toward me by Dorothy, and many other things  which a moment before had seemed fraught with impenetrable mystery.</p>
  <p>All  this in the twinkling of an eye. Meanwhile, misled by my words, Gilbertine drew  back a step and with her face still bright with the radiance I have mentioned,  murmured in low, but full-toned accents:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  just yet! it is too soon. Let me simply enjoy the fact that I am free and that  the courage to win my release came from my own suddenly acquired trust in Mr.  Sinclair&rsquo;s goodness. Last night&mdash;&rdquo; and she shuddered&mdash;&ldquo;I saw only another way&mdash;a  way the horrors of which I hardly realized. But God saved me from so dreadful,  yea, so unnecessary a crime, and this morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was cruel to let her go on, cruel to stand there and allow this ardent if  mistaken nature to unfold itself so ingenuously, while I with ear half-turned  toward the door, listened for the step of her whom I had never so much loved as  at that moment&mdash;possibly because I had only just come to understand the cause of  her seeming vacillations. My instincts were so imperative, my duty and the  obligations of my position so unmistakable, that I made a move as she reached  this point, which caused Gilbertine first to hesitate, then to stop. How should  I fill up this gap of silence? How tell her of the great, the grievous mistake  she had made? The task was one to try the courage of stouter souls than mine.  But the thought of Dorothy nerved me; perhaps, also, my real friendship and  commiseration for Sinclair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gilbertine,&rdquo;  I began, &ldquo;I will make no pretense of misunderstanding you. The situation is too  serious, the honor which you do me too great; only, I am not free to accept  that honor. The words which I uttered were meant for your cousin Dorothy. I  expected to find her in this room. I have long loved your cousin&mdash;in secrecy, I  own, but honestly and with every hope of some day making her my wife. I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no need for me to finish. The warm hand turning to ice in my clasp, the  wide-open, blind-struck eyes, the recoil, the maiden flush rising, deepening,  covering chin and cheek and forehead, then fading out again till the whole face  was white as marble and seemingly as cold&mdash;told me that the blow had gone home  and that Gilbertine Murray, the unequalled beauty, the petted darling of a society  who recognized every charm she possessed save her ardent nature and great  heart, had reached the height of her many miseries and that it was I who had  placed her there.</p>
  <p>Overcome  with pity, but conscious, also, of a profound respect, I endeavored to utter  some futile words, which she at once put an end to by an appealing gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can say nothing,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I have made an awful mistake, the worst a woman  can make, I think.&rdquo; Then, with long pauses, as though her tongue were clogged  by shame&mdash;perhaps by some deeper if less apparent feeling&mdash;&ldquo;You love Dorothy;  does Dorothy love you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  answer was an honest one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have dared to hope so, despite the little opportunity she has given me to  express my feelings. She has always held me back, and that very decidedly, or  my devotion would have been apparent to everybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Dorothy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Regret,  sorrow, infinite tenderness, all were audible in that cry. Indeed, it seemed as  if for the moment her thoughts were more taken up with her cousin&rsquo;s unhappiness  than with her own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  I must have made her suffer! I have been a curse to those who loved me. But I  am humbled now, and very rightly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  began to experience a certain awe of this great nature. There was grandeur even  in her contrition and, as I took in the expression of her colorless features,  sweet with almost an unearthly sweetness in spite of the anguish consuming her,  I suddenly realized what Sinclair&rsquo;s love for her must be. I also as suddenly  realized the depth and extent of his suffering. To call such a woman his, to  lead her almost to the foot of the altar and then to see her turn aside and  leave him! Surely his lot was an intolerable one, and, though the interference  I had unconsciously made in his wishes had been involuntary, I felt like  cursing myself for not having been more open in my attentions to the girl I  really loved.</p>
  <p>Gilbertine  seemed to divine my thoughts, for, pausing at the door she had unconsciously  approached, she stood with the knob in her hand, and, with averted brow,  remarked gravely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going out of your life. Before I do so, however, I should like to say a few  words in palliation of my conduct. I have never known a mother. I early fell  under my aunt&rsquo;s charge, who, detesting children, sent me away to school, where  I was well enough treated, but never loved. I was a plain child and felt my  plainness. This gave an awkwardness to my actions, and as my aunt had caused it  to be distinctly understood that her sole intention in sending me to the  Academy was to have me educated for a teacher, my position awakened little  interest, and few hearts, if any, warmed toward me. Meanwhile my breast was  filled with but one thought, one absorbing wish. I longed to love passionately  and be passionately loved in return. Had I found a mate&mdash;but I never did. I was  not destined for any such happiness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Years  passed. I was a woman, but neither my happiness nor my self-confidence had kept  pace with my growth. Girls who once passed me with a bare nod now stopped to  stare, sometimes to whisper comments behind my back. I did not understand this  change, and withdrew more and more into myself and the fairy-land made for me  by books. Romance was my life, and I had fallen into the dangerous habit of  brooding over the pleasures and excitements which would have been mine had I  been born beautiful and wealthy, when my aunt suddenly visited the school, saw  me and at once took me away and placed me in the most fashionable school in New  York City. From there I was launched, without any word of motherly counsel,  into the gay society you know so well. Almost with my coming-out I found the  world at my feet and, though my aunt showed me no love, she evinced a certain  pride in my success and cast about to procure for me a great match. Mr.  Sinclair was the victim. He visited me, took me to theaters and eventually  proposed. My aunt was in ecstasies. I, who felt helpless before her will, was  glad that the husband she had chosen for me was, at least, a gentleman, and, to  all appearances, respectable in his living and nice in his tastes. But he was  not the man I had dwelt on in my dreams, and while I accepted him&mdash;(it was not  possible to do anything else, with my aunt controlling every action, if not  every thought)&mdash;I cared so little for Mr. Sinclair himself that I forgot to ask  if his many attentions were the result of any real feeling on his part or only  such as he considered due to the woman he expected to make his wife. You see  what girls are. How I despise myself now for this miserable frivolity!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  this time I knew that I was not my aunt&rsquo;s only niece; that Dorothy Camerden, of  whom I knew little but her name, was as closely related to her as I was. For,  true to her heartless code, my aunt had placed us in separate schools and we  had never met. When she found that I was to leave her and that soon there would  be nobody to see that her dresses were bought with discretion, and her person  attended to with something like care, she sent for Dorothy. I shall never  forget my first impression of her. I had been told that I need not expect much  in the way of beauty and style, but from my first glimpse of her dear face, I  saw that my soul&rsquo;s friend had come and that, marriage or no marriage, I need  never be solitary again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think I made as favorable an impression on my cousin as she did on me.  Dorothy was new to elaborate dressing and to all the follies of fashionable  life, and her look had more of awe than expectation in it. But I gave her a  hearty kiss and in a week she was as brilliantly equipped as myself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  loved her, but, from blindness of eye or an overwhelming egotism which God has  certainly punished, I did not consider her beautiful. This I must acknowledge  to you, if only to complete my humiliation. I never imagined for a moment, even  after I became the daily witness of your many attentions to her, that it was on  her account you visited the house so often. I had been so petted and spoiled  since entering society that I thought you were kind to her simply because honor  forbade you to be too kind to me; and seeing in you a man different from the  others&mdash;one&mdash;who&mdash;who pleased me as the heroes of my old romances had pleased me,  I gave you all my heart and, what was worse, <i>confided my folly to Dorothy</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will have many a talk with her in the future, and some day she may succeed in  proving to you that it was vanity and not badness of heart which led me to  misunderstand your feelings. Having repressed my own impulses so long, I saw in  your reticence the evidences of a like struggle; and when, immediately upon my  break with Mr. Sinclair, you entered here and said the words you did&mdash;Well, we  have finished with this subject for ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  explanations which I gave below, of the part I played in my aunt&rsquo;s death were  true. I only omitted one detail, which you may consider a very important one.  The fact which paralyzed my hand and voice when I saw her lift the drop of  death to her lips was this: I had meant to die by this drop myself, in Dorothy&rsquo;s  room, and with Dorothy&rsquo;s arms about me. This was my secret&mdash;a secret which no  one can blame me for keeping as long as I could, and one which I should hardly  have the courage to disclose to you now if I had not already parted with it to  the coroner, who would not credit my story till I had told him the whole truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gilbertine,&rdquo;  I prayed, for I saw her fingers closing upon the knob she had held lightly till  now, &ldquo;do not go till I have said this. A young girl does not always know the  demands of her own nature. The heart you have ignored is one in a thousand. Do  not let it slip from you. God never gives a woman such a love twice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; she murmured, and turned the knob.</p>
  <p>I  thought she was gone, and let the sigh which had been laboring at my breast  have vent, when suddenly I caught one last word whispered from the threshold:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Throw  back the shutters and let in the light. Dorothy is coming. I am going now to  call her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  hour had passed, the hour of hours for me, for in it the sun of my happiness  rose full-orbed and Dorothy and I came to understand each other. We were  sitting hand in hand in this blessed little boudoir, when suddenly she turned  her sweet face toward me and gently remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  seems like selfishness on our part; but Gilbertine insisted. Do you know what  she is doing now? Helping old Mrs. Cummings and holding Mrs. Barnstable&rsquo;s baby  while her maid packs. She will work like that all day, and with a smile, too.  Oh, it is a rich nature, an ideal nature! I think we can trust her now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  did not like to discuss Gilbertine even with Dorothy, so I said nothing. But  she was too full of her theme to stop. I think she wished to unburden her mind  once and for ever of all that had disturbed it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  aunt&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;will be a sort of emancipation for her. I don&rsquo;t  think you, or any one out of our immediate household, can realize the control  which Aunt Hannah exerted over every one who came within her daily influence.  It would have been the same had she occupied a dependent position instead of  being the wealthy autocrat she was. In her cold nature dwelt an imperiousness  which no one could withstand. You know how her friends, some of them as rich  and influential as herself, bowed to her will and submitted to her  interference. What, then, could you expect from two poor girls entirely  dependent upon her for everything they enjoyed? Gilbertine, with all her  spirit, could not face Aunt Hannah&rsquo;s frown, while I studied to have no wishes.  Had this been otherwise, had we found a friend instead of a tyrant in the woman  who took us into her home, Gilbertine might have gained more control over her  feelings. It was the necessity she felt of smothering her natural impulses, and  of maintaining in the house and before the world an appearance of satisfaction  in her position as bride-elect, which caused her to fall into such extremes of  despondency and deep despair. Her self-respect was shocked. She felt that she  was living a lie and hated herself in consequence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may think I did wrong not to tell her of your affection for myself, especially,  after what you whispered into my ear that night at the theater. I did do wrong;  I see it now. She was really a stronger woman than I thought and we might all  have been saved the horrors which have befallen us had I acted with more  firmness at that time. But I was weak and frightened. I held you back and let  her go on deceiving herself, which meant deceiving Mr. Sinclair, too. I  thought, when she found herself really married and settled in her own home, she  would find it easier to forget, and that soon, perhaps very soon, all this  would seem like a troubled dream to her. And there was reason for this hope on  my part. She showed a woman&rsquo;s natural interest in her outfit and the plans for  her new house, but when she heard you were to be Mr. Sinclair&rsquo;s best man, every  feminine instinct within her rebelled and it was with difficulty she could  prevent herself from breaking out into a loud No! in face of aunt and lover.  From this moment on her state of mind grew desperate. In the parlor, at the  theater, she was the brilliant girl whom all admired and many envied; but in my  little room at night she would bury her face in my lap and talk of death, till  I moved in a constant atmosphere of dread. Yet, because she looked gay and  laughed, I turned a like face to the world and laughed also. We felt it was  expected of us, and the very nervous tension we were under made these  ebullitions easy. But I did not laugh so much after coming here. One night I  found her out of her bed long after every one else had retired for the night.  Next morning Mr. Beaton told a dream&mdash;I hope it was a dream&mdash;but it frightened  me. Then came that moment when Mr. Sinclair displayed the amethyst box and  explained with such a nonchalant air how a drop from the little flask inside  would kill a person. A toy, but so deadly! I felt the thrill which shot like  lightning through her, and made up my mind she should never have the  opportunity of touching that box. And that is why I stole into the library at  the first moment I had to myself and took down the little box and hid it in my  hair. I never thought to look inside; I did not pause to think that it was the  flask and not the box she wanted, and consequently felt convinced of her safety  so long as I kept the latter successfully concealed in my hair. You know the  rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yes,  I knew it. How she opened the box in her room and found it empty. How she flew  to Gilbertine&rsquo;s room, and, finding the door unlocked, looked in, and saw Miss  Lane lying there asleep but no Gilbertine. How her alarm grew at this and how,  forgetting that her cousin often stole to her room by means of the connecting  balcony, she had wandered over the house in the hope of coming upon Gilbertine  in one of the down-stairs rooms. How her mind misgave her before she had  entered the great hall, and how she turned back only to hear that awful scream  go up as she was setting foot upon the spiral stair. I had heard it all before  and could imagine her terror and dismay; and why she found it impossible to  proceed any further, but clung to the stair-rail, half-alive and half-dead,  till she was found there by those seeking her and taken up to her aunt&rsquo;s room.  But she never told me, and I do not yet know, what her thoughts or feelings  were when, instead of seeing her cousin outstretched in death on the bed they  led her to, she beheld the lifeless figure of her aunt. The reserve she maintained  on this point has been always respected by me. Let it continue to be so.</p>
  <p>When  therefore she said, &ldquo;You know the rest,&rdquo; I took her in my arms and gave her my  first kiss. Then I softly released her, and by tacit consent we each went our  way for that day.</p>
  <p>Mine  took me into the hall below, which was all alive with the hum of departing  guests. Beaton was among them, and as he stepped out on the porch I gave him a  parting handclasp and quietly whispered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  all dark things are made light, you will find that there was both more and less  to your dream than you were inclined to make out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  bowed, and that was the last word which ever passed between us on this topic.</p>
  <p>But  what chiefly impressed me in connection with this afternoon&rsquo;s events was the  short talk I had with Sinclair. I feared I forced this talk, but I could not  let the dreary day settle into still drearier night without making clear to him  a point which, in the new position he held toward Gilbertine if not toward  myself, might seem to be involved in some doubt. When, therefore, I had the  opportunity to accost him I did so, and, without noting the formal bow with  which he strove to hold back all confidential communication, I said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not a very propitious time for me to intrude my personal affairs upon you,  but I feel as if I should like you to know that the clouds have been cleared  away between Dorothy and myself, and that some day we expect to marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  gave me the earnest look of a man who has recovered his one friend. Then he  grasped my hand warmly, saying with something like his old fervor:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  deserve all the happiness that awaits you. Mine is gone; but if I can regain  it, I will; trust me for that, Worthington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner, who had seen much of life and human nature, managed with much discretion  the inquest he felt bound to hold. Mrs. Lansing was found to have come to her  death by a meddlesome interference with one of her niece&rsquo;s wedding trinkets;  and, as every one acquainted with Mrs. Lansing knew her to be quite capable of  such an act of malicious folly, the verdict was duly accepted and the real  heart of this tragedy closed for ever from every human eye.</p>
  <p>As  we were leaving Newport Sinclair stepped up to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have reason to know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that Mrs. Lansing&rsquo;s bequests will be a surprise,  not only to her nieces, but to the world at large. Let me advise you to  announce your engagement before reaching New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  followed his advice and in a few days understood why it had been given. All the  vast property owned by this woman had been left to Dorothy. Gilbertine had been  cut off without a cent.</p>
  <p>We  never knew Mrs. Lansing&rsquo;s reason for this act. Gilbertine had always been  considered her favorite, and, had the will been a late one, it would have been  generally thought that she had left her thus unprovided for solely in  consideration of the great match which she expected her to make. But the will  was dated back several years,&mdash;long before Gilbertine had met Mr. Sinclair, long  before either niece had come to live with Mrs. Lansing in New York. Had it  always been the latter&rsquo;s wish, then, to enrich the one and slight the other? It  would seem so, but why should the slighted one be Gilbertine?</p>
  <p>The  only explanation I ever heard given was the partiality which Mrs. Lansing felt  for Dorothy&rsquo;s mother, or, rather, her lack of affection for Gilbertine&rsquo;s. God  knows if it is the true one, but whether so or not, the discrimination she  showed in her will put poor Gilbertine in a very unfortunate position. At  least, it would have done so, if Sinclair, with an adroitness worthy of his  love, had not proved to her that a break at this time in their supposed  relations would reflect most seriously upon his disinterestedness and thus  secured for himself opportunities for urging his suit which ended, as such  opportunities often do, in a renewal of their engagement. But this time mutual  love was its basis. This was evident to any one who saw them together. But how  the magic was wrought, how this hard-to-be-won heart learned at last its true  allegiance, I did not know till later, and then it was told me by Gilbertine  herself.</p>
  <p>I  had been married for some months and she for some weeks, when one evening  chance threw us together. Instantly, and as if she had waited for this hour,  she turned upon me with the beautiful smile which has been hers ever since her  new happiness came to her, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  once gave me some very good advice, Mr. Worthington, but it was not that which  led me to realize Mr. Sinclair&rsquo;s affection. It was a short conversation which  passed between us on the day my aunt&rsquo;s will was read. Do you remember my  turning to speak to him the moment after that word <i>all</i> fell from the  lawyer&rsquo;s lips?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mrs. Sinclair.&rdquo; Alas! did I not! It was one of the most poignant memories of my  life. The look she gave him, and the look he gave her! Indeed, I did remember.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was to ask him one  question,&mdash;a question to which misfortune only could have given so much weight.  Had my aunt taken him into her confidence? Had he known that I had no place in  her will? His answer was very simple; a single word,&mdash;&lsquo;always.&rsquo; But after that,  do I need to say why I am a wife? why I am <i>his</i> wife?&rdquo;</p>
