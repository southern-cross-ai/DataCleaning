    <h2>A STROLL AROUND AUSTRALIA</h2>

  <h3>By AIDAN DE BRUNE</h3>

  <h3>As published in<br>
  <i>The Moora Herald and Midland Districts Advocate</i>,<br>
  West Australia, 8 &amp; 24 June 1923</h3>

  <p class="first">TO leave Sydney on foot, to walk ten thousand miles (more or
  less) around Australia, calling at all the ports <i>en route</i> on the four coasts,
  and to return to Sydney, was the task set me on 20th September, 1921.</p>

  <p>It was summer time when I left Sydney, and summer stayed with me until I
  reached the Queensland border, over 2,000 miles away My route lay up the east
  coast through Tamworth, Armidale, Glen Innes and Tenterfield to the
  Queensland border, some 492 miles. This country is some of the most fertile
  in New South Wales and carries a large population.</p>

  <p>Around the Queensland border the orchardist owns sway. Here are large and
  magnificent orchards surrounding the go-ahead towns where, on market days,
  one meets prosperous farmers and merchants, everyone intent on the progress
  and prosperity of the district and town.</p>

  <p>The country changed after a while, and I climbed up on the Darling Downs.
  Here I entered a new but still prosperous, district? Wheat and sheep hold
  this country, and still fine towns were passed.</p>

  <p>Passing through Toowoomba and Maryborough, both big towns, with fine
  streets and shops, I came to a land new and full of interest&mdash;the land
  of the sugar cane.</p>

  <p>Here, huge fields of cane in various stages of growth, met the eye. Tramways
  were everywhere and led to fine mills. Cane-cutters' camps dotted the
  fields, and everywhere was activity. About the mills, towns had grown up with
  clubs for the workers and well-equipped stores.</p>

  <p>Brisbane, the capital city of Queensland, is not a large town for the size
  of the state it rules over. But this is the policy of Queensland.
  Decentralisation is the rule in the Northern State, and, in consequence, the
  country is covered with a network of railways running from one large town to
  another.</p>

  <p>Through Rockhampton, Mackay and Townsville I walked, ever north, until I
  came to Cairns, the end of my first long lead.</p>

  <p>At Cairns I turned westward and started my second coast. My route lay
  along the famous Barron Valley, with its magnificent waterfall, to Mareeba.
  There I turned towards Almaden and again to Forsayth.</p>

  <p>Over the ridge to Georgetown was the next stretch of country. Here were no
  railways, but the roads were good. As a mining town, Georgetown is almost
  dead. Houses have been pulled down and abandoned. One queer thing I noted.
  Georgetown at one time had a local newspaper, but with the downfall of mining
  the paper lapsed and, when I visited Georgetown, the printing press was
  standing out in the street.</p>

  <p>On to Croydon, another mining town, with, alas, the few mines operating in
  the hands of tributers and half the town dismantled.</p>

  <p>Here I again found a railway and followed it to Normanton, a small port on
  the Gulf of Carpentaria. Normanton was once a big town exporting an immense
  quantity of gold, won at the Croydon gold mines.</p>

  <p>My next port of call was Burketown, a small agricultural port on the Gulf,
  and noteworthy to me as the last Queensland town I was to visit.</p>

  <p>Two hundreds of miles westward from Burketown I began to climb on to the
  Barclay Tableland. Lawn Hill Station was the last place I passed in
  Queensland, and then I came to Herbertvale Station on the Queensland-Northern
  Territory border.</p>

  <p>I entered the territory ten miles southwards of Herbertvale through the
  gate on the rabbit-proof fence. Twelve miles on I saluted my first
  Territorian at Gallipoli, a sub-station of the huge Alexandra Station,
  containing some 14,000 square miles of country.</p>

  <p>Then on to Brunette Downs Station, a still larger cattle run, across large
  plains of fine grass.</p>

  <p>The Barclay Tablelands I consider some of the finest grazing lands in
  Australia. On them I have travelled plains 20 to 30 miles across and never
  anything but grass. Miles and miles of it, some of the finest grazing in
  Australia. One wonders if these plains have an ending.</p>

  <p>Then a dark line appears on the horizon. Later it resolves into a belt of
  gidyea trees, with coolibar trees standing before it. These belts of trees
  are never more than a few hundred yards across. And then out on to another
  plain, appearing almost illimitable in extent.</p>

  <p>Overhead, a fierce tropical sun beats down on this shadeless plain and,
  throughout the day, dances the mirage.</p>

  <p>Scenes of water, vast lakes, with villages, stations and people, the
  mirage dances the whole day long. How many men have seen these beautiful
  illusions and taken them for realities? How many men have wandered from the
  track and finally laid down under some tree to face the inevitable end? One
  has to set one's face sternly to the one path and disregarded the tempting
  vision.</p>

  <p>Seventy miles past Brunette Downs Station I reached my first territory
  township. It consisted of but three houses: a store, a police station (the
  first I had passed in the territory) and an outstation of Brunette Downs.</p>

  <p>Then on. Another long spell and I came to the edge of the Tableland and
  Newcastle Waters and, crossing late at night, reached the station, content to
  have passed over one of the most perilous zones of my journey.</p>

  <p>Again I turned northwards, following the telegraph line to the Katherine
  River, passing on the way Mataranka Station&mdash;a Federal Government
  enterprise&mdash;and Maranboy, my second township in the Territory. Four
  miles past Katherine township I came to the most northern railway in
  Australia&mdash;the section of the future north-south railway from Emungalen
  to Darwin.</p>

  <p>Ten days' rest in Darwin prepared me for my long trek to Derby. First, I
  had to come back to Emungalen&mdash;a distance of about 190 miles. Then I
  branched westwards along the Katherine River to King's River.</p>

  <p>Here I passed through some of the finest agricultural land in Australia.
  Let my readers look at a map and draw a line south from Darwin along the
  railway from Emungalen and then to Wave Hill Station. Turn your pencil
  westwards to Hall's Creek and then along the Margaret and Fitzroy rivers to
  Derby. The country enclosed will be some of the finest plantation land in the
  world and will one day furnish our country with all the rubber, indigo,
  tobacco, tea, coffee and cocoa it needs.</p>

  <p>My route lay through Vestey Bros. series of stations&mdash;Manmbaldo,
  Willeroo and Delemere. Then I passed on to Bovril Estates Ltd and came to
  Wickham Downs Station on the Victoria River.</p>

  <p>Turning at an angle I came up through Jasper Gorge&mdash;one of the
  wonders of Australia&mdash;to Timber Creek Police Station, and three miles on
  to Victoria River Depot, a lonely store on the banks of the lordly river.
  Here I met Mr. Matt. Wilson, one of the best known identities of the
  northlands, and found him a kindly host.</p>

  <p>Again on an angle I passed through the country owned by Messrs. Connor,
  Doherty and Durack, by Auvergne, Newry and Argyle stations to the Ord River
  in Western Australia.</p>

  <p>It was at Old Newry, some miles past the present Newry Station, that I
  passed out of the Northern Territory into Western Australia.</p>

  <p>I had then walked 4,229 miles, made up of 492 miles in New South Wales,
  2,218 miles in Queensland and 1,519 miles in the Northern Territory. I had
  still to walk three-quarters of the way around Western Australia, through
  South Australia and Victoria and half way through New South Wales to Sydney,
  my final destination.</p>

  <p>From Argyll Station I went along the banks of the Ord River to Ivanhoe
  Station, commonly known as "The Stud," and then branching slightly away to
  Wyndham. To show how well-watered and difficult this country is, I may add I
  covered 627 miles between Darwin and Wyndham, whereas the journey by sea is
  about 300 miles.</p>

  <p>From Wyndham to Turkey Creek, where I met Mr. Jim Cunningham, reputed to
  be the heaviest postmaster in the State. Thence to Hall's Creek, one of the
  most northern and oldest mining centres in W A., and down the banks of the
  Margaret and Fitzroy rivers to their junction at Fitzroy Crossing.</p>

  <p>Fitzroy Crossing is an unique township. It consists of three houses.
  First, one comes to the police station, a mile and a half on to the hotel,
  turn at an angle and travel two miles to the post office. From there it is
  about a mile and a half back to the police station.</p>

  <p>Following the north banks of the Fitzroy River, through stations only a
  couple of days apart, I came eventually to Derby and there ended my second
  coast of Australia.</p>

  <p>Southwards was the next point of the compass. The route lay along the
  dreaded Madman's Track to Broome, where I enjoyed my second Christmas of the
  journey.</p>

  <p>Then down to La Grange Telegraph Station, a few miles north of the famous
  Ninety-mile Beach.</p>

  <p>Frazier Downs was the next point of call, and a long stage led to
  Colangatie outstation, and then to Anna Plains Station. Leaving that station,
  I turned on to the stock route that lay along the beach, and one day turned
  on to the seashore to enjoy a swim, from off the centre of this wonderful
  stretch of sand.</p>

  <p>The next house I arrived at was Pardon Station, and then on to the lonely
  telegraph station at Condon, once the shipping point for Marble Bar, but
  deserted when the Marble Bar-Port Hedland railway was opened.</p>

  <p>DeGray Station was now only 18 miles away. From there I went to Shelley
  Station and then on to Poondino, on the railway.</p>

  <p>I had now travelled 1700 miles since I had seen a railway. Twenty miles on
  I reached Port Hedland.</p>

  <p>My next objective was Roebourne, which I reached after an easy walk. From
  there I travelled down to Onslow, a town soon to be moved to Beedon, a few
  miles up the coast.</p>

  <p>From Onslow I touched trouble. The season above Carnarvon had been
  abnormal, and for miles I waded through water.</p>

  <p>Carnarvon to Geraldton was my last stretch of the wildlands. From
  Carnarvon to the Murchison River was bad for sand, and for a few miles past
  the river.</p>

  <p>Twenty-four miles from Murchison House Station I struck the railway at
  Ajana&mdash;and civilisation.</p>

  <p>At Geraldton I met with a warm reception. Then down the railway to
  Mingenew and Three Springs to Moora, where I was welcomed as one from a far,
  far, perilous journey.</p>

  <p>From Moora I am travelling to Perth and Fremantle. Then to Albany along
  the south coast to Esperance, Eucla, Port Augusta to Adelaide, Melbourne and
  back to Sydney, my starting point.</p>

  <p>Everywhere I have been received cordially and every assistance has been
  given me on my wearisome way. When I arrive home I shall have very pleasant
  memories of the many friends I have made on this ten thousand miles trip on
  foot.</p>
