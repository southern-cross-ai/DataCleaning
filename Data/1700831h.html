<h3>Article published in <i>The West Australian</i>, 1 April 1933</h3>

<p class="first">NORMAN LINDSAY, artist, philosopher, and novelist, is an
Australian phenomenon. His fame is world-wide. Like Nellie Melba, he has
surprised the world with the possession of a rare gift, and shown that genius
can be native to this land of empty spaces and a small population.</p>

<p>Norman Lindsay is acknowledged to be the greatest living illustrator in
black-and-white, and one of the finest craftsmen with the pen who has ever
lived. Even those who dislike the nude in art, which Norman Lindsay lavishly
displays, are compelled to acknowledge the incomparable dexterity and
technical excellence of his work.</p>

<p>He is many-sided. In his serious work as an artist he has proved himself a
master of oil-painting, water-colour, etching, wood-engraving and dry-point.
His pen-and-ink illustrations to the sumptuous editions of Greek and Roman
classics which have been published in London are sought by collectors of rare
books throughout the world.</p>

<p>In the spacious gardens of his home at Springwood, in the Blue Mountains,
there are dozens of life-size sculptures which he has modelled. In his studio
there are numerous models of sailing-ships in full rig, among them the
clipper <i>Thermopylae</i> and an Elizabethan warship, which experts consider
to be perfect in every detail. His model of Captain Cook's <i>Endeavour</i>
is preserved in the Melbourne Museum.</p>

<p>For twenty years he was principal cartoonist on, the Sydney
<i>Bulletin</i> and he still contributes occasional humorous drawings and
cartoons to that journal. He is a brilliant conversationalist and charming
host. His home at Springwood has been a place of pilgrimage for many
celebrated people, such as Anna Pavlova, Fritz Kreisler and Melba, who have
been eager to pay their respects to an Australian who has proved his claim to
the title of genius.</p>

<p>Norman Lindsay is the author of a number of books. <i>The Magic
Pudding</i>, a humorous tale for children, written and illustrated by him, is
an Australian "best-seller." It was published by Angus and Robertson,
Ltd.</p>

<p><i>A Curate in Bohemia</i>, published by the N.S.W. Bookstall Co., Ltd.
was written many years ago. It deals with the humorous aspect of life amongst
the artists in Melbourne, in the 'nineties. More than 50,000 copies have been
sold.</p>

<p>Turning to more serious themes, in <i>Creative Effort</i>, published in
London in 1924, Norman Lindsay expounded the philosophical basis of artistic
endeavour.</p>

<p>A philosophical novel in dialogue, <i>Madame Life's Lovers</i>, published
in London, in 1929, gave further expression to the serious side of his
thoughts. Leaving the artistic theme, he described in <i>Redheap</i>,
published in London and New York in 1930, the humorous aspects of family life
in an Australian mining town of forty years ago. Exception was taken to the
book by the Australian Customs officials, who ordered the return of 10,000
copies to London.</p>

<p><i>Redheap</i> has now been turned into a play by Floyd Dell, the
celebrated American dramatist, and is to be produced in New York this year.
When <i>Redheap</i> was banned, Norman Lindsay left Australia, declaring that
a country which consistently neglected its authors or treated them shabbily
was not a properly civilised place.</p>

<p>He travelled through America and England, and incidentally arranged for
the publication of more of his novels. Two of these, <i>Mr. Gresham on
Olympus</i> and <i>The Cautious Amorist</i>, have recently been issued in
both London and New York. Although not banned, it is difficult to obtain them
in Australia, owing to the curtailment of book-importing by adverse exchange
rates and prevailing economic conditions.</p>

<p>In London, Norman Lindsay persuaded Mr. P. R. Stephensen, a Queensland
Rhodes Scholar with practical experience in book publishing in England, to
undertake the organisation of an Australian Book Publishing Company, to
encourage the work of our local authors. On Mr. Stephensen's arrival in
Australia four months ago, the Bulletin Newspaper Company agreed to place its
organisation and resources at the disposal of the new firm, of which both Mr.
Lindsay and Mr. Stephensen are directors.</p>

<p>This new Australian publishing house will begin issuing books next month
under the imprint of The Endeavour Press. The press-mark of the firm is a
design of Captain Cook's <i>Endeavour</i> in full sail, designed by Norman
Lindsay. The first novel issued will be a new book by Norman Lindsay,
entitled <i>Saturdee</i>, a humorous story about Australian schoolboy pranks,
mischief and fun. Its appearance will be eagerly awaited.</p>

(1871-1935)</a></h2><br>

<h3>Article published in <i>The West Australian</i>, 8 April 1933</h3>

<p class="first">LOUIS STONE, the author of <i>Jonah</i> and <i>Betty
Wayside</i>, is one of the most remarkable of Australian authors. His books,
published in England, were allowed to go out of print during the War, and are
now almost unobtainable. Second-hand copies of <i>Jonah</i> have been sold
for as much as £2/10/- each. Competent critics declare that this book is a
worthy successor to <i>Robbery Under Arms</i> and <i>For the Term of His
Natural Life</i> amongst Australian novels that can properly be called
"classic."</p>

<p>"With one book," declared A. G. Stephens, when <i>Jonah</i> was first
published, "Mr. Stone has put himself in the front rank of Australian
authorship."</p>

<p>Mr. John Galsworthy wrote: "I have lapped up your novel, which I consider
extraordinarily actual, vivid, and good."</p>

<p>With such praise it is difficult to understand why Mr. Stone's book was
ever allowed to go out of print. Australian authors have certainly had small
encouragement from their own countrymen in the past.</p>

<p>The new edition of <i>Jonah</i>, which is to be published this year by The
Endeavour Press in Sydney, will make tardy amends to Mr. Stone for twenty
years' neglect of his masterpiece.</p>

<p>What is it that makes <i>Jonah</i> a really great book? Norman Lindsay
perhaps supplied the answer when he wrote: "Louis Stone's streets and people
are instantly vitalised and known at a glance."</p>

<p>Let us take an example of his descriptive power. It is the reader's
introduction to Mrs. Yabsley, the mountainous
washerwoman-philosopher:&mdash;</p><br>

<p class="quote">"Cardigan Street was proud of her. Her eyes twinkled in a
big, humorous face; her arm was like a leg of mutton; the floors creaked
beneath her as she walked. She laughed as a bull roars; her face turned
purple; she fought for air; the veins rose like cords on her forehead. She
was pointed out to strangers like a public building as she sat gossiping with
her neighbours in a voice that shook the windows. Her sayings were quoted
like the newspapers. Draymen laughed at her jokes."</p><br>

<p>Note with what artistry the novelist has built up a complete picture in
simple words. We note the same forceful quality in the description of Jonah
himself, the larrikin hunchback, with his "large head, wedged between the
shoulders as if a giant's hand had pushed it down, the masterful nose, the
keen grey eyes, and the cynical lips."</p>

<p>Jonah is truly an unforgettable character. Born in the squalor and cruelty
of slum life, he becomes leader of the "Push," and dictator of its fierce
laws. One of the most terrifying passages in all literature is the
description of the Push* "dealing out stouch"&dagger; to a victim:</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Push</i>. A Sydney street gang. Known for their
sharp outfits as much as their violence, the Pushes followed a particular
structure. Led by a Captain, the "Larrikins" and their girlfriends, the
"Donahs," worked together to rob drunken visitors to the Rocks.<br>
&dagger; <i>To deal out stouch</i>: to thrash, to beat up
&mdash;R.G.]</p><br>

<p class="quote">"The Push opened out, and the man, sobered by danger, stood
for a moment with bewildered eyes. Then, with the instinct of the hunted, he
turned for home and ran. The Push gave chase. Again and again the quarry
turned, blindly seeking refuge in the darkest lanes. As his pursuers gained
on him he gave a hoarse scream&mdash;the dolorous cry of a hunted animal. But
it was the cat playing with the mouse. The bricklayer ran like a cow, his
joints stiffened by years of toil; the larrikins, light on their feet as
hares, kept the pace with a nimble trot, silent and dangerous, conscious of
nothing but the desire and power to kill."</p><br>

<div align="center">
<img src="1700831h-images/10AA-ThePush.jpg"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p class="caption">Jonah flees from the Push.</p>
</div>

<p><br>
From this fierce and savage environment Jonah escapes, thanks to Mrs.
Yabsley's motherly humorous advice and the influence of his own baby son, by
Mrs. Yabsley's daughter, Ada. When Jonah first sees the baby, "flesh of his
flesh; bone of his bone:"</p><br>

<p>"He remembered his deformity, and with a sudden catch in his breath,
lifted the child from its cradle and felt its back, a passionate fear in his
heart. It was straight as a die...'Sool 'im!' he cried at last, and poked his
son in the ribs."</p>

<p>From that moment his regeneration begins. "'E's the only relation I've got
in the world; 'e's the only livin' creature that looks at me without seein'
my hump," says Jonah to Mrs. Yabsley.</p>

<p>The story of his victory over sordid surroundings, and of how the larrikin
and wastrel wins through to self-respect is told throughout with the sureness
of touch and gift for observation that only great novelists possess.</p>

<p>Louis Stone, a quiet-speaking and cultivated man, is now living in
retirement at Randwick. He was born in Leicester, and came to Australia as a
child. He is a graduate of Sydney University, and was a schoolmaster for many
years. His favourite authors are Flaubert and Virgil. He has a keen
appreciation of classical music, of which he is an accomplished critic.</p>

<p>With these scholarly interests it is all the more remarkable that the
theme of his <i>magnum opus</i> should have been the lowest life of Sydney's
slum streets, but to the humanist all life is interesting and this perhaps
explains why Mr. Stone turned to a subject which most writers would have
found unattractive, or too difficult. It is well that he did so. The larrikin
pushes of Sydney, have almost entirely disappeared. But in one great book
that interesting phase of Australian evolution has been put on record for all
time.</p>

(1884-1968)</a></h2><br>

<h3>Article published in <i>The West Australian</i>, 15 April 1933</h3>

<p class="first">BERNARD CRONIN, President of the Society of Australian
Authors, is one of those stalwart "professional" writers whose books command
a world sale; but unlike some of the other Australian authors of this class,
he has not gone abroad to live and work in exile, away from the source of his
inspiration. He accepts the challenge which the Australian bush offers to
writers of major fiction.</p>

<p>"The writer in the Old Country," he has stated, "finds his scenery, as it
were, ready made for him. In this country it is definitely not to be found
upon the surface of things. One has to dig deeply to become aware of the very
great natural beauties of the Australian landscape. Real treasure is mostly
of the buried variety. To my mind there is more character in an old Aussie
gum tree than in any other tree I ever heard of. Incidentally, I should say
that that much abused genius, D. H. Lawrence, came closer to an understanding
of the spirit of the Australian landscape than any other writer, local, or
imported, has yet done. He is the first scribe definitely to sight the real
genii of the bush."</p>

<p>We may take this to mean that Bernard Cronin is intrigued by Australia as
a literary theme, but he does not "sentimentalise" his subject.</p>

<p>"Our trouble is that we lack real breeding, and crudeness is a poor
scaffold for the Arts. Further, the indifference of our rulers to the
absolute need to develop a national soul has not made matters any better.
Hansard will never make this country aware of the sublimities of human
destiny. We need to see Australia from her own standpoint, and with her own
individuality. The Arts are our only hope of salvation."</p>

<p>By this last phrase our fierce realist is revealed as an idealist, after
all. The title of his new book, <i>The Sow's Ear</i>, which will be published
this year in Australia, shows that the author is concerned with making
something fine from our "crude" material. The story is set in the Tasmanian
timber country, in the days before the war. It is a ruthless exposure of the
tragic life of young girls enslaved by the system of marrying without love,
at the command of domineering parents. The heroine longs for something
better, but must accept her fate. In her passionate desire to escape from the
bondage of the bush, she works to win for her two little daughters the chance
in life which was so bitterly denied to herself.</p>

<p>Bernard Cronin's novels all have this "fierce" quality. He has aimed at
exposing what he considers to be wrong, stupid or uneconomic. In this sense
he is the strongest of the Australian writers who wish to make us aware of
our shortcomings, so that we may eliminate them, and become a truly civilised
nation.</p>

<p>He is fully equipped for the literary task which he has set himself. He
came to Australia forty years ago, at the age of six years, in charge of the
captain of the old Orient steamer <i>Austral</i>. On the way out he nearly
killed an able seaman, who was painting the ship's side, holding to the deck
with one hand.</p>

<p>Young Cronin jumped with both feet on the sailor's hand, "just to see what
would happen." The sailor let go, but was providentially rescued. Perhaps it
was this impish spirit of curiosity that eventually led Cronin to become a
writer, and to jump, figuratively, upon the fingers of his Australian
readers.</p>

<p>"I am not really pugnacious," he says, "but I resent with violence
anything that strikes me as being cheap."</p>

<p>He tells us that he began to write as soon as he learned that a pencil may
be sharpened by biting it. He decided to become a farmer, and entered the
Dookie Agricultural College. In 1901 he was dux of the college and gold
medalist.</p>

<p>He then had jackaroo experience on Kewita Station, South Gippsland, and
Ulupna Station, in the north-east of Victoria, before taking up
cattle-farming on the north-west coast of Tasmania, where he remained for ten
years. His experience there has provided him with material for nearly a dozen
novels and serials, and innumerable short stories.</p>

<p>He has published the following novels: <i>The Coastlanders</i>, 1918;
<i>Timber Wolves</i>, 1920; <i>Bluff Stakes</i>, 1922; <i>Salvage</i>, 1923;
<i>Red Dawson</i>, 1927; <i>White Gold</i>, 1927; <i>The Treasure of the
Tropics</i>, 1928; <i>Dragonfly</i>, 1928; <i>Toad</i>, 1929; <i>Bracken</i>,
1931; and, in conjunction with Arthur Russell, <i>Bushranging
Silhouettes</i>, 1932.</p>

<p>Six of these novels have been issued by London publishers in cheap
editions&mdash;a sure proof of their popularity.</p>

<p>Now living in Melbourne, Bernard Cronin has revealed the humanitarian
impulse which lies below his "fierceness" by his work for the Derelict
Society, which he founded in conjunction with Gertrude Hart. He is also the
founder of the Society of Australian Authors, and has shown a very great zeal
in striving to remove the handicaps under which our writers have to work.</p>

<p>"There is much to discourage the Australian writer," he says.
"Nevertheless, he holds steadily to his job. He hopes that the pioneering
work which he is doing will prove an invaluable foundation for the generation
of writers to come. Give him the support of his own Government and public,
and he will win to wider distinction inside a decade. But he'll win through,
any way."</p>

<p>When Australian authors have finally won recognition from their own
people, the name of Bernard Cronin will stand high in the roll of honour of
those who have fought for this objective.</p>

(1879-1954)</a></h2><br>

<h3>Article published in <i>The West Australian</i>, 22 April 1933</h3>

<p class="first">THIRTY years ago literary circles in Australia were
astounded by the publication of an extraordinary book, written by a girl of
sixteen, Stella Miles Franklin. The title of the book was
audacious&mdash;<i>My Brilliant Career</i>. The "brilliant career" of a girl
of sixteen might have meant any thing&mdash;a reading of the book itself
shows that it meant a great deal. The story is in the form, partly, of
fiction, and partly of autobiography, and it bears on every page the imprint
of sheer genius. It throbs with a passionate love of the Australian bush, and
particularly of horses, and with an equal passionate hatred of the cruelties
of life endured by the people on the land, particularly by the women. It is
the first statement, and to this day it remains the greatest statement, of
the case for Australian bush womanhood.</p>

<p>In a preface to the book Henry Lawson said:&mdash;</p><br>

<p class="quote">"The description of bush life and scenery came startlingly,
painfully real to me; and I know that, as far as they are concerned, the book
is true to Australia&mdash;the truest I ever read. She has lived her book,
and I feel proud of it for the sake of the country I came from, where people
toil and bake and suffer, and are kind."</p>

<p><br>
The youthful author herself says in her introduction:&mdash;</p><br>

<p class="quote">"This is not a romance. I have too often faced the music of
life to the tune of hardship to waste time in snivelling and gushing over
fancies and dreams... Do not fear encountering such trash as descriptions of
beautiful sunsets and whisperings of wind. We (999 out of every 1,000) can
see naught in sunsets save as signs and tokens whether we may expect rain on
the morrow. There is no plot in the story, because there has been none in my
life, or in any other life which has come under my notice."</p>

<p><br>
But the last chapter swells to a magnificent paean of youth's brave challenge
to the world:&mdash;</p><br>

<p class="quote">"I am proud that I am an Australian, a daughter of the
Southern Cross, a child of the mighty bush. I am thankful I am a peasant, a
part of the bone and muscle of my nation, and earn my bread by the sweat of
my brow, as man was meant to do.</p>

<p class="quote">"Ah! my sunburnt brothers&mdash;sons of toils and of
Australia&mdash;I love and respect you well, for you are brave and good and
true. I have seen not only those of you with youth and hope strong in your
veins, but those with pathetic streaks of grey in your hair, large families
to support, and with half a century sitting upon your work-laden shoulders. I
have seen you struggle uncomplainingly against flood, fire, disease in stock,
pests, drought, trade depression, and sickness, and yet have time to extend
your hands and hearts in true sympathy to a brother, in misfortune, and
spirits to laugh and joke and be cheerful.</p>

<p class="quote">"And for my sisters a great love and pity fills my heart.
Daughters of toil, who scrub and wash and mend and cook, who are dressmakers,
paper-hangers, milk-maids, gardeners, and candle-makers all in one, and yet
have time to be cheerful and tasty in your homes, and make the best of the
few cases to be found along the dusty track of your existence. Would that I
were more worthy to be one of you&mdash;more a typical Australian
peasant&mdash;cheerful, honest, brave!</p>

<p class="quote">"I love you. I love you. Bravely you jog along with the rope
of class distinction drawing closer, closer, tighter, tighter around you. A
few more generations, and you will be enslaved as were ever the moujiks of
Russia. I see it, and know it, but I cannot help you. My ineffective life
will be trod out in the same ground of toil. I am only one of yourselves, I
am only an unnecessary, little bush commoner. I am only a&mdash;woman!</p>

<p class="quote">"The great, sun is sinking in the west, grinning, and
winking knowingly as he goes, upon the starving stock and drought smitten
wastes of land. Nearer he draws to the gum-tree, scrubby horizon, turns the
clouds to orange, scarlet, silver, flame, gold! Down, down he goes. The
gorgeous, garnish splendour of sunset pageantry flames out; the long shadows
eagerly cover all; the kookaburras laugh their merry mocking good-night; the
clouds fade to turquoise, green, and grey; the stars peep shyly out; the soft
call of the moke-poke arises in the gullies! With much love and good wishes
to all&mdash;Good-night! Good-bye! Amen!"</p><br>

<p><br>
The manuscript of <i>My Brilliant Career</i> was taken to England by Earl
Beauchamp, then Governor of New South Wales, and it was published by
Blackwood, of Edinburgh. Like many another fine Australian books it has been
allowed to go out of print, and copies are now quite unobtainable. Perhaps it
will be re-issued by one of our Australian publishing houses soon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what happened to Miles Franklin? She went abroad, and has been
lost to Australia for more than twenty years. She threw herself into
organising work for the Feminist Movement in the United States of America,
wrote thousands of newspaper and magazine articles, and made speeches in
every State of the Union.</p>

<p>When the war broke out she went to Salonika with the Scottish Women's
Hospital. After the war she had a most responsible position as secretary of
the Housing Committee in London. In all these years of great organising
achievement she was definitely lost to Australian life and letters.</p>

<p>Now she has returned to her native land. A year ago a book appeared,
<i>Old Blastus of Bandicoot</i>, under her name. The book is modestly
described as an "opuscule," but all the old fire and dash is there.</p>

<p>John Dalley, in the Sydney <i>Bulletin</i>, sums up what many other
critics have said about this book:</p><br>

<p class="quote">"The characterisation's the thing. Nothing so good has been
done in any previous novel about the Australian bush."</p>

<p><br>
This year The Endeavour Press will print and publish in Australia a sprightly
detective story by Miles Franklin, entitled <i>Bring the
Monkey</i>!&mdash;modestly described as a "light novel."</p>

<p>Is that, then, the whole story of Miles Franklin? We shall see. Is it
likely, or possible, that a writer of such power and sheer genius as the
author of <i>My Brilliant Career</i> should have been silent for more than
twenty years? Miles Franklin will not admit it, but whether she likes it or
not people are identifying her with the mysterious "Brent of Bin Bin," whose
books (published by Blackwood, of Edinburgh, be it noted) are acknowledged to
be the finest presentation in fiction of the Australian outback epic which
have yet been written.</p>

<p>"Brent of Bin Bin" loves the bush and understands horses, and hates
injustice to bush women, as only the author of <i>My Brilliant Career</i> and
<i>Old Blastus of Bandicoot</i> could love, and understand, and hate.</p>

<p>The "Brent of Bin Bin" trilogy (<i>Up the Country</i>, <i>Ten Creeks
Run</i>, <i>Back to Bool Bool</i>) are already Australian classics. Despite
the fact that they are difficult to obtain, as are most Australian books
published overseas, they have gone into numerous editions, and are hailed by
a multitude of discerning readers as being absolute portents for the future
of the Australian novel&mdash;a real and true portrait, not a caricature, of
outback life.</p>

<p>If Miles Franklin is also "Brent of Bin Bin," then she is the greatest
Australian bush novelist alive. And if she is only Miles Franklin of <i>My
Brilliant Career</i> and <i>Old Blastus of Bandicoot</i> she takes second
place to one writer alone&mdash;the tremendously gifted and mysterious author
who writes in Miles Franklin's manner under the pseudonym of "Brent."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">FIFTY-FOUR years is a long way to look back upon, to a
little village some few miles outside Montreal where, I am informed, I was
born. I have little knowledge of the event, and but little more of the long
trek to Zululand, where my father escorted his family when I reached the
mature age of four years. More distinctly, I remember my Zulu play-fellows,
and the long, long trek to Cape Town, where I was sent to school, at the age
of nine.</p>

<p>A family council, when I reached my fourteenth birthday, decided that I
would be an ornament to the priesthood, and I departed for London, <i>en
route</i> for Maynooth.</p>

<p>At that time England and the United States of America were awakening to
the new journalism, under the respective guidances of Harmsworth and Hearst.
I was attracted, and a great longing to tread the inky way possessed me. In
consequence, I stayed in London, completing a sketchy education at night
schools and haunting the newspaper offices or the city by day. To my
gratification&mdash;and the surprise of many of the major journalists of that
period&mdash;I developed a flair for the trade, and within a few months found
I could earn bread at it, with an occasional flavouring of cheese and jam.
Short story writing had long attracted me&mdash;my first fiction story had
appeared in a Cape Town newspaper before I reached eleven. In London I found
corners in magazines and journals open to my efforts, and this editorial
encouragement had disastrous effects on my future&mdash;I determined to be an
author.</p>

<p>I started a "magnum opus'" and&mdash;to buy paper and ink&mdash;
cultivated sensational love-story writing in periodicals of the <i>Family
Herald Supplement</i> type. On the outbreak of the Boer War I found I had
sufficient money in the bank to pay my fare home&mdash;to South. Africa. A
fight has always attracted me, and amid the wide-spread battleground of South
Africa I found adventure sufficient for an ordinary lifetime.</p>

<p>I returned to London with a 100,000 words novel on the war&mdash;but
publishers are always unkind, even those of the present century. My arrival
in London was only the jumping-off place. The United States of America was an
alluring vision on the horizon&mdash;and I strode for the foot of the
rainbow. I landed in New York with exactly nineteen shillings and three-pence
in my pocket; a great belief in my own powers; and a store of imagination
that won me past the very lax emigration laws of that period. Followed a
period of wandering up and down a country then in the making&mdash;and almost
as big as Australia. I worked at anything that came to hand&mdash;and, when
work failed to materialise, characterised as the perfect hobo. Even to-day I
remember what particularly hard boot-leather was provided for the
train-guards. And all this time I was writing stories and articles&mdash;and
all the time editors and publishers were filling the U.S. mails with my
returns.</p>

<p>By the time I had reached twenty-five I claimed to have the largest and
most varied collection of "The editor regrets..." in the known world. Still,
I <i>would</i> write. Chance gave me the opportunity to practise journalism,
and for a time I walked the streets of big cities, a full-blown reporter.</p>

<p>Again the wide spaces called&mdash;I think it was a minor revolution in
Panama. Anyway, I went south to see Spanish America. Some hundreds of days of
wild adventures&mdash;the nights spent in scribbling; and I woke up to the
fact that some thousands of dollars had accumulated in New York to my credit.
I was a capitalist!</p>

<p>Naturally, my first thought was to see the world&mdash;up to then I had
only partially surveyed Canada, South Africa, England and the United States.
The Orient called, but I had no intention of wasting money on fares. In
'Frisco a friendly master mariner offered to ship me before the mast of a
befouled, much-wandered cargo-boat, and I jumped at his offer before he had
time to get sober. Then I learned something of the Pacific, as a
sailing-pond, and a good deal of the many and varied nationalities it
contains.</p>

<p>While at Singapore I said good-bye to the vessel, but forgot to take
farewell of the captain. He didn't trouble to find me&mdash;I suppose because
I had forgotten to collect wages owing me.</p>

<p>Deciding to explore China, by good luck I came into the graces of a high
official of the Empire. With him I visited large tracts that country then
unknown to white man. Back to the United States, my head filled with facts
and fictions, determined to settle down and become a respectable member of
society.</p>

<p>By the time I reached New York again I had less than a dollar in my
pocket. Two days spent in examining and approving the alterations made in the
city during my absence, and I bethought myself of the treasury&mdash;and the
hotel bill that was steadily mounting. Full of thought, I wandered down to
the doors of a well-known publishing house &mdash;and hesitated. What had I
for sale? It took more than two hours, pacing the block, to frame a
satisfactory plot for a serial. Then I chose an editor&mdash;and bearded him
in his lair. How I put it over, I don't know; but I do know that I came out
of that building with a commission to write a fiction serial then only
existing in my mind&mdash;and, what was more to the point, with half payment
for the story in my pocket. That story was written in thirteen days&mdash;I'm
always fond of unlucky thirteen&mdash;and I was up 250 dollars. Then and
there, on a busy sidewalk, during the busiest hour of the day. I elected
myself serial-writer for the great United States of America&mdash;and up to a
certain point I made good on I my self-election.</p>

<p>Through all the earlier days of my life I had been fascinated by
crooks&mdash;although at that time I was not using them as material for
stories. Opportunity offering, I obtained a place on a newspaper, developing
a flair for crime investigation (of the newspaper kind).</p>

<p>Now followed some years of peace, my days being devoted to journalism and
my nights to fiction-writing. Just about the time my banker recognised my
entry to his establishment with a welcoming smile, I broke down in health.
Eighteen months of neurasthenia; more than half that time helpless on a
bed.</p>

<p>American doctors sent me to England. There the fraternity declared me a
hopeless case. Perhaps to get me off their hands with the least trouble, they
decided that my only hope was a voyage to Australia. Hospital attendants
carried me on board ship, but at Port Said I walked ashore to see the sights.
By the-time I reached Fremantle I had decided there was still room in this
world for me. I looked at that western capital and decided that the country
was good; also that doctors were darned bad guessers.</p>

<p>The wander-lust urged again, and for quite a time I travelled most of the
southern parts of the continent. Then came the War and I joined, to my
ability, in the Great Adventure. Again back to Australia, with an earnest
desire to see those parts of it I had previously missed. At that time certain
gentlemen were forming the <i>Sydney Daily Mail</i>.</p>

<p>One day I wandered into Mr. Gay's offices and announced that I proposed to
walk around Australia&mdash;and would he pay for articles on the trip? Mr.
Gay was blunt. First he told me exactly how many kinds of fools I was to
think of such a trip, then came to an agreement with business-like
promptitude. Within a few hours I had gathered together what I thought
necessary for an 11,000 miles trip, and had left Sydney.</p>

<p>Two and a half years later I came to Sydney again, having in the meantime
visited nearly every port on the extensive coastline. More to the point, I
had proved possible a trip quite a number of Sydney wise-heads had declared
to be sheer suicide.</p>

<p>My literary work? Well, about fifty to sixty serials, under various
<i>nom-de-plumes</i> in London and New York&mdash; some dozen of them only
appearing in book form. Not until I had completed the walk around Australia
and had settled. down in Sydney again did I attempt to make use of my
partiality for crooks and their works. My first story on these lines was
<i>Dr. Night,</i> published in the <i>World News</i>.</p>

<p>Then followed <i>The Carson Loan Mystery</i>, published by the N.S.W.
Bookstall Co. Ltd., of Sydney. A little later the <i>Daily Guardian</i>,
Sydney, ran <i>The Dagger and Cord</i> as a serial, and immediately it ended
in the newspaper Messrs. Angus &amp; Robertson, Ltd., published it in book
form. Then, in the columns of the <i>Daily Guardian</i> followed
<i>Fingerprints of Fate</i> (published by Angus &amp; Robertson, Ltd.. under
the title of <i>The Shadow Crook</i>) and <i>The Little Grey Woman</i>. Since
then I have devoted myself more particularly to serial writing, under my own
name and <i>nom-de-plumes</i>, totalling in all fourteen stories. My
amusements: Two absorbing ones. Writing mystery stories and barracking
Federal politicians to foster a national Australian literature. The first
easy; the last apparently very difficult.</p>

<h3>Article published in <i>The West Australian</i>, 6 May 1933</h3>

<p class="first">IF the Commonwealth Government were to appoint an Australian
Poet Laureate there can be no doubt that the first holder of that high office
would be Andrew Barton Paterson, known far and wide as "Banjo" Paterson. His
name is a household word. More truly than any other of our numerous
Australian poets, he has expressed the spirit of this land in verse.</p>

<p>"Banjo" Paterson, now nearing seventy years of age, is the undisputed Dean
of Australian poetry. His verses, since they first began to appear in the
<i>Bulletin</i>, fifty years ago, have been recited throughout the length and
breadth of the land, in shearing sheds, at bush concerts, wherever two or
three Australians have gathered around a camp fire. The rollicking rhythm of
his ballads, the apt phrases, sometimes slangy, sometimes high poetry, have
brought joy to hundreds of thousands of readers and listeners.</p>

<p>While poets of high-falutin' "schools of thought" have piped in their thin
and genteel voices to meagre audiences of bored listeners, this robust singer
of the wide plains and mountains of the bushland has "bestrode them like a
Colossus." The people, with their true instinct to recognise what is sincere
in art, have given "Banjo" Paterson the applause which only a major poet can
command. Over 100,000 copies of <i>The Man from Snowy River</i> have been
sold. Probably there is not a man, woman, or child in Australia who does not
know at least some of "Banjo" Paterson's verse by heart.</p>

<p>Australia's Poet Laureate has had an interesting and varied career and a
wide experience of both bush and city life. He was born in 1864 at Narrambla,
New South Wales, and was educated at the Sydney Grammar School. He practised
as a solicitor for fifteen years before deciding to take up journalism, when
his verses were beginning to make him famous. <i>The Man from Snowy River</i>
was published in book form in 1895, and from that time his position as a
national songster was assured.</p>

<p>He was editor of the <i>Evening News</i> for five years, and acted as
correspondent of the London <i>Times</i> on sugar-growing, pearl-diving, and
Australian subjects generally. When the Boer war broke out, he went to South
Africa as Reuter's correspondent. On the outbreak of the Great War, in 1914,
he volunteered for active service with the A.I.F. Though over military age,
he was given the rank of major, joined the Remount Unit, and saw service in
Egypt and Palestine.</p>

<p>He has travelled extensively outback, particularly in Central Australia
and the Northern Territory, where be went buffalo shooting. In one of his
verses he describes typical buffalo country:&mdash;</p><br>

<p class="verse">Out where the grey streams glide,<br>
Sullen and deep and slow,<br>
And the alligators slide<br>
From the mud to the depths below,<br>
Or drift on the stream like a floating death<br>
Where the fever comes on the south wind's breath<br>
There is the buffalo.</p>

<p><br>
In addition to <i>The Man from Snowy River</i> he has published <i>Rio
Grande's Last Race</i>, and <i>Saltbush Bill</i>, besides a novel entitled
<i>An Outback Marriage</i>, and a humorous book entitled <i>Three Elephant
Power</i>. He has also edited a collection of <i>Old Bush Songs</i>.</p>

<p>Now, after a silence of many years, he has ready a new book of poems,
which will be published before Easter, by The Endeavour Press, with
illustrations by Norman Lindsay. The most popular poet and the greatest
illustrator in Australia will thus collaborate for the first time in the
pages of a book, though it was Norman Lindsay who designed the original cover
for <i>The Man from Snowy River</i>.</p>

<p>The title of the new verses is <i>The Animals Noah Forgot</i>. In a
foreword the poet explains that the native bear refused to go in the Ark
because Noah did not carry a stock of gum leaves&mdash;and the platypus
refused because he was afraid of being trodden on by the elephant!</p>

<p>Most of the poems deal in a humorous, but very understanding way, with the
Australian bush animals. The wombat, for example:</p><br>

<p class="verse">The strongest creature for his size,<br>
But least equipped for combat,<br>
That dwells beneath Australian skies is<br>
Weary Will the Wombat.</p>

<p><br>
The platypus, who "descended from a family most exclusive:"</p><br>

<p class="verse">He talks in a deep unfriendly growl<br>
As he goes on his journey lonely;<br>
For he's no relation to fish nor fowl,<br>
Nor to bird nor beast, nor to hornèd owl.<br>
In fact, he's the one and only!</p>

<p><br>
The bandicoot, who "will come to look at a light, and scientists wonder,
why:"</p>

<p class="verse">If the bush is burning it's time to scoot<br>
Is the notion of Benjamin Bandicoot.</p>

<p><br>
The flying squirrels:</p>

<p class="verse">Never a care at all<br>
Bothers their simple brains;<br>
You can see them glide in the moonlight dim<br>
From tree to tree and from limb to limb.<br>
Little grey aeroplanes.</p>

<p><br>
These few quotations show that none of the poet's old brilliance of phrase
has been lost.</p>

<p><br>
Besides descriptions of the bush animals, there are poems on shearers,
bullock-drivers, cattle-dogs, and a rattling good "Ballad of the Army Mules,"
which would be a credit to Rudyard Kipling, if that Dean of English Poets had
rhymed it.</p>

<p>The multitude of admirers of Australia's national poet will welcome his
"return to form." The young poets of the post-war generation might well study
this book, and take a lesson from one of the "Old Hands" at the game of
versifying. It is only by sheer hard work and a constant observation of men
and nature that poetry such as "Banjo" Paterson's, which looks so easy, is
written.</p>

(1890-1972)</a></h2><br>

<hr>
<br>

<h3>Article published in <i>The West Australian</i>, 13 May 1933</h3>

<p class="first">DULCIE DEAMER has had an adventurous life. She was born in
Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1890, her father being a doctor. She never went
to school, her mother being her sole teacher. At the age of eight she was
allowed the unrestricted run of her father's fine library, and she read the
novels of Lord Lytton and Sir Walter Scott, abhorring&mdash;as she
confesses&mdash;all "children's" books.</p>

<p>Her hobbies were natural history and archaeology, and whatever books she
wanted on these subjects were bought for her. From the very beginning, any
information she could obtain concerning the Stone Age drew her like a magnet.
She disliked dolls, adored animals, and preferred trees and flowers to the
society of other children.</p>

<p>At eleven she began to write verses. A year later her family moved to
Featherstone, a tiny bush township in the North Island, and here for five
years she ran wild, riding unbroken colts, shooting, learning to swim in
snow-fed creeks, and going for long, solitary rambles of exploration through
the virgin bush.</p>

<p>It was here in the thick scrub, where there was always the risk of
encountering wild cattle or a wild boar, that what she describes as "memories
of the Stone Age" came to her. And so, when the newly-started <i>Lone
Hand</i> magazine startled Australasia by offering a prize of 25 pounds for
the best short story submitted to it, Dulcie Deamer, then 16, sent along her
first serious prose effort&mdash; a story of the savage love of a cave-man.
It won&mdash;and altered the whole course of her life.</p>

<p>For some years previously her parents had been training her for a stage
career. This original idea was not abandoned. At 17 Dulcie Deamer was touring
New Zealand with a little company playing melodrama in all the back-block
townships. It was thus she met her future husband, Albert Goldie, who was at
that time business manager for one of Williamson's companies. A whirlwind
courtship ended in a marriage in Perth, Western Australia&mdash;the bride
being not yet 18. Then came a tour of the Far East, with Hugh Ward's London
Comedy Company, which her husband was then managing. Here all manner of
adventures befell the young actress-authoress.</p>

<p>A bomb was thrown into her carriage in the streets of Bombay, where
anti-British rioting had broken out. Luckily it failed to explode. She was
caught in another riot in the Temple of Kali, in Calcutta, and only saved by
the intervention of a Brahmin priest. A fat Bengalese millionaire, hung with
necklaces of pearls the size of broad-beans, nearly succeeded in trapping her
into his harem, and in China she saw execution grounds littered with freshly
severed heads.</p>

<p>These excitements provided material for an Indian novel, which was
published in New York, which city she visited when she was 21. In the
meantime a book of her collected Stone Age stories had been published in
Sydney, and three sons had been born to her. In the following years she
visited London, Paris, and Rome, and her family had increased to six.</p>

<p>During a second visit to the United States she was involved in strike
riots in the vicinity of Chicago, and had to run for her life from a couple
of bayonet charges, when the military were called out, the strikers having
turned the street cars loose under their own power, and started to wreck the
suburb with torn up paving stones.</p>

<p>Previously to this she had been booked to sail on the ill-fated
<i>Titanic</i>, but had changed her plans at the last moment, and taken
passage on the <i>Olympic</i>, sailing four day sooner. To gain experience on
this voyage she travelled steerage with thirteen hundred immigrants from
every European country.</p>

<p>She was again in America during the Great War, and witnessed all the
frenzies of Yankee excitement on Armistice Day. Immediately after the war
three of her novels were published in London and New
York&mdash;<i>Revelation</i>, <i>The Street of the Gazelle</i>, and <i>The
Devil's Saint</i>. Her work is strongly coloured with imagination.
<i>Revelation</i> and <i>The Street of the Gazelle</i> deal with Jerusalem in
the time of Christ, <i>The Devil's Saint</i> is a mediaeval romance dealing
with witchcraft and black magic.</p>

<p>Finally she returned to Sydney, which she had for long regarded as "home."
Here she settled down to journalism, but by no means had finished with
adventures, one of which was a visit to the famous Homebush abattoirs,
disguised as a man, for no woman is allowed to witness the actual
killing.</p>

<p>During the last few years a de luxe edition of her short stories (<i>As It
Was in the Beginning</i>) was published in Melbourne, with illustrations by
Norman Lindsay, and a volume of her poems (<i>Messalina</i>) has recently
been brought out in Sydney. She has now turned her attention to play-writing,
her first play being produced last year. She hopes to contribute screen
stories to the newly-established Australian film industry. She has written a
number of serials for Australian papers, and is now engaged in a new long
novel, which will be published in Australia by The Endeavour Press towards
the end of the year.</p>

<h3>Article published in <i>The West Australian</i>, 20 May 1933</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN you begin reading any book or magazine story written by
Vance Palmer, you may do so with the comfortable feeling that you are going
to be well satisfied when you reach the end. There is nothing erratic about
his literary work: it is level, flawless, and polished, like a table made
from Queensland silky oak by a cabinet-maker who takes pride in his
trade.</p>

<p>Vance Palmer is an accomplished journeyman&mdash;a craftsman in words who
has served his apprenticeship thoroughly, and has mastered his trade, giving
you guaranteed good value for money when you buy what he has made with his
pen.</p>

<p>"A typical Vance Palmer four-square yarn" means a story well-constructed,
written with care, and no loose ends in the plot, and no slovenly phrasing.
His name on a book is a trade-mark that you can trust.</p>

<p>Discussion of the major Australian novelists of today invariably begins
with the brilliant constellation of women writers who have come to the fore
in recent years. Henry Handel Richardson, Brent of Bin Bin, Katherine
Prichard, Velia Ercole, Barnet Eldershaw, G. B. Lancaster, Alice Rosman,
Helen Simpson&mdash;a surprisingly strong list of Australian writers to begin
with, all known and respected in England and America&mdash;and all women!</p>

<p>The discussion turns to men writers. Invariably someone says, "Well, there
is Vance Palmer..." His name comes first to mind. With Dale Collins and Jack
McLaren he has presented the Australian theme to English and American readers
in a certain virile, straightforward, sincere, and unassuming way that lacks
the wild emotional force of the woman writers, but is no less convincing and
genuinely Australian for that. Here is the Australian male in
literature&mdash;modest, but capable and full of a quiet strength, as he is
in life.</p>

<p>Like the "Champion Ringers" famed in Western shearing sheds, Vance Palmer
comes from Queensland. He was born in Bundaberg, the sugar-town at the mouth
of the Burnett River. In his early and impressionable youth he must have seen
the picturesque gangs of Kanakas cutting the tall green cane and singing
their deep-voiced Island songs as they flashed the broad cane-knives in the
sunlight. He would have seen, too, the white labourers, the roughest-mannered
but physically the most perfect specimens of masculinity to be found anywhere
on the earth, arriving at the cane-fields after shearing-sheds were cut out
for a few months' big pay and desperately hard work, "cane-slogging."</p>

<p>Perhaps he saw fights and riots between Kanakas and white labourers, or
watched great muscled timber-fellers, striped to the waist, sweating in the
sun as they cleared the jungle from the Isis scrublands, revealing the rich
red volcanic loam wherein more and more sugarcane was to be planted. Perhaps,
too, he went to the "Sand Hills", where the Burnett River flows out to the
ocean, and watched the gulls planing over the dunes where another young
native of Bundaberg, Bert Hinkler, made and flew box-kites the size of
aeroplanes even before the triumphs of Wilbur Wright and Blériot; and no
doubt in the Burnett River young Palmer caught ceratodi&mdash; the archaic
fish that can live out of water, and are found only in that stream.</p>

<p>Colour, strength, romance, during the impressionable age of childhood gave
him a background for his writing which he has never lost, for all his later
sophistication and urbanity, and world-travelling, and painfully acquired
"literariness." Asked recently to express an opinion on Australia as a
literary theme, Palmer replied:</p>

<p>"A man can only write about the life he knows. If he is an Australian he
will naturally take his themes from his own country. I have written countless
magazine stories set in places as far apart as China and Mexico, but I
wouldn't attempt any serious work set in those countries&mdash;they don't
stimulate my deepest interest. Australia can provide all the themes required
by any writer who knows his country."</p>

<p>There is a brave and heartening declaration from one who has travelled all
the world, and proved himself a master of the literary trade! Vance Palmer
has been four times to London on literary business, and once on the business
of the A.I.F. He spent a year travelling through Russia and Siberia, in the
days before the revolution, incidentally learning much about his job of
writing from the works of the great Russian masters, Tolstoy, Gorky,
Dostoevsky, Pushkin&mdash; all geniuses of narrative style and psychological
insight.</p>

<p>He has sojourned in the colourful East and has lived through the
uncertainties, terrors, and comedy of a revolution in Mexico. Yet always he
has returned to Australia, and in his serious work it is always of Australia
that he writes.</p>

<p>His early days in Bundaberg, and at the Ipswich Grammar School
(Queenslands "Athens"), the days which he spent as a jackaroo on a Western
Queensland cattle station, and what he noticed when living on the edge of the
crashing surf at Caloundra, near Brisbane, or during the year which he spent
recently on Green Island, near Cairns, on the Barrier Reef&mdash; these
essentially Australian experiences have given him, and will continue to give
him, the inspiration for his best work.</p>

<p>His books, like those of all the best Australian authors, are difficult or
impossible to obtain from Australian booksellers, who will offer you,
instead, English "throw-out" lines if you ask for decent reading matter.</p>

<p>Something will be done about this, no doubt, when Australian publishing
gets firmly established. The best of Vance Palmer's novels, all recently
published in England, are <i>The Man Hamilton</i> (1928), <i>Men Are
Human</i> (1930), <i>The Passage</i> (1930). and <i>Daybreak</i>. <i>Men Are
Human</i> and <i>The Passage</i> were <i>Bulletin</i> prize-winners.</p>

<p>A collection of his short-stories, entitled <i>Separate Lives</i>, was
published In 1931; and a book of plays entitled <i>The Black Horse</i> was
issued in 1924.</p>

<p>He is one of the foremost of the gallant band who are endeavouring to
convince the Australian public that Australia as a country is interesting to
read about.</p>

<p>"It will probably take a lot of writing, of the highest class." he says,

<h3>Article published in <i>The West Australian</i>, 27 May 1933</h3>

<p class="first">MANY young Australian writers, desperate at the lack of
book-publishing facilities in Australia, have gone abroad, to seek publishers
in England or America and, having found publishers they have stayed away from
this country&mdash;for their own good. Why should an author remain in
Australia, to be treated with indifference by his own people, they say, when
fame and recognition are to be had in London or New York?</p>

<p>Such an export of talent is a loss to Australia. We can only admire those
who have remained here to pioneer Australian Literature as their fathers
pioneered the economic resources of this vast and uncultivated continent.</p>

<p>Frank Dalby Davison is one of the young Australians, of a new generation
of writers, who is determined to make his literary home amongst his own
people. Unable to find a publisher for his first two books, <i>Man-Shy</i>
and <i>Forever Morning</i>, he had them printed and published privately,
encouraged and assisted by his father, Mr. Fred. Davison, a Sydney estate
agent, who is also possessed of strong literary gifts and is a sound
critic.</p>

<p>Compared with the finished-looking products of professional publishers,
young Davison's books were crudely printed and bound, and looked amateurish
in the extreme. One blushed to think that such poor-looking books were
representative of Australian literature.</p>

<p>But readers of the books had a pleasant surprise in store. In Frank Dalby
Davison's books discerning readers saw the power and fluency and word-control
that marks the great writer. A new star had risen in the Australian literary
firmament.</p>

<p>The first editions were eagerly bought up. <i>Man-Shy</i> was awarded the
Australian Literature Society's Gold Medal for the best Australian novel
published in 1931. Angus and Robertson, Ltd., of Sydney, republished the
books in proper professional style. Frank Dalby Davison had "arrived."</p>

<p>The first two novels both dealt with men and cattle in the Australian
bush. <i>Man-Shy</i> tells of the herds of wild cattle ("scrubbers") that
ranged in the mountains beyond the boundaries of a cattle-station on the
Maranoa, in Queensland. They were like a "phantom herd" that had been in
existence for sixty years:</p>

<p>"Theirs was a life for the brute slaves of man to dream of. Their hides
had never known the searing whip, or the sting of the branding iron; nor did
the shadow of the slaughterhouse fall across their years. Companions of the
wilderness creatures&mdash;the emu, the dingo, and the kangaroo&mdash; their
life was the life of dumb brutes as it was on earth in the beginning. They
were free as the winds that played about their mountains; free as the rains
that swept up the gorges; and as free as the range itself, hoisting its
timber-crested palisades into the blue. They lived secure and content in the
simple wisdom the Creator has given to dumb things."</p>

<p>In every paragraph of this remarkable Australian story the author builds
up in simple, but unforgettable imagery, the life of the wild herd. His
similes are drawn directly from nature:</p><br>

<p class="quote">"The narrow paths along which they passed in single file
from one feeding ground to another lay in the mountains like the webbed veins
in the back of a leaf. The observation of the bushland never errs."</p>

<p><br>
The author has not drawn upon his imagination, but on his knowledge, in
writing such passages as, for example, the following description of a fight
between two bulls:</p><br>

<p class="quote">"Prelude to battle was observed with due ceremony. Eyeing
each other from a distance of about forty yards, each roared his contempt at
the other. Each stroked the ground with a challenging forefoot, flinging the
dust back along his flanks. They walked a few paces towards each other, and
paused. Their battle-cry was a succession of throaty grumbles, each pitched
about a tone higher than the preceding one; each followed by a sobbing intake
of the breath; and the last one ending in a blast that threatened
annihilation. With short, measured steps they again moved towards each other,
heads lowering to engage."</p>

<p><br>
A quick eye! That is precisely what Davison himself possesses, and it is the
essential qualification for a writer. Things seen and noted, simply and
graphically told&mdash; such is the material of all great art. Like the
painter of pictures in oils, the writer, who is a painter of pictures in
words, must trust his eye, and use his eye, before he begins to use his pen.
Frank Davison understands this. He has looked closely at Australia before
beginning to write about it. He has looked through his own eyes and not
through the spectacles kindly provided for our use by English, and other
visitors, to this country. That is why the work of Frank Dalby Davison is a
portent for the future of the Australian novel. Only one other
writer&mdash;Miles Franklin&mdash;has written so directly and with such
surely-observed knowledge of horses and cattle in the Australian scene. This
is real Australia, one feels, not the romantic Australia of "bookish"
writers.</p>

<p>Frank Davison's future work will be watched with great interest by those
who look forward to a powerful Australian literature, strong-rooted in the
soil.</p>

<p>"I am Australian by birth and by conviction," he has stated.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see whether he can write of the Australian bush
in a manner interesting to people who live abroad, as Vance Palmer has done
in <i>The Passage</i>, and Katherine Pritchard in <i>Working
Bullocks</i>.</p>

<p>But he is more likely to succeed if he writes for his own people first.
Angus and Robertson have just published a new story of his entitled <i>The
Wells of Beersheba</i>, which deals with the Australian Light Horse, in
Palestine. This book is not a novel, but a long "short-story" in book form,
intended as a Gift Book. Frank Dalby Davison is an Australian writer well
worth watching.</p>

(1874-1944)</a></h2><br>

<h3>Article published in <i>The Grafton Daily Examiner</i>, NSW, 9 April
1933</h3>

<p class="first">AMBROSE PRATT is one of the most prolific and successful of
Australian authors. The list of his published works is a surprising
revelation of energy in the literary field. More than twenty of his novels
have been issued, in England and America, as well as in foreign translations,
by firms of such high repute as Hutchinson, Grant Richards, Ward Lock, Dent,
and Cassell. Many of these works have reached Australia, in small quantities
only, or perhaps not at all&mdash;a state of affairs distinctly
unsatisfactory to Australian authors, but alas, all too usual in the
past.</p>

<p>Great as Ambrose Pratt's reputation in Australia is at the present time,
it would be much greater if his numerous books published abroad had been
properly distributed by the Australian booksellers, instead of being allowed
to go out of print, and become unobtainable.</p>

<p>Besides twenty novels, Ambrose Pratt is the author of two very notable
Australian biographies. <i>Three Years with Thunderbolt</i> is a classic
story of bnshranging days, vividly written. Published both in England and
Australia, it has had a big sale. A more substantial biography is that of
David Syme, the celebrated Melbourne journalist-proprietor, described as the
father of "Protection in Australia." This book is regarded as one of the best
Australian political biographies ever written.</p>

<p>Two books of travel, <i>The Real South Africa</i> and <i>Magical
Malaya,</i> and two books on economics, <i>The Elements of Constructive
Economies</i> and the <i>The Australian Tariff Handbook,</i> show the wide
intellectual range of Ambrose Pratt's mind, and the fine facility of his
pen.</p>

<p>Born at Forbes, NSW, Mr. Pratt was educated at the Sydney Grammar School
and Sydney University. He then travelled extensively in Europe, Asia and
Africa. Returning to Sydney, he practised as a solicitor for ten years,
before joining the editorial staff of the Melbourne <i>Age</i>. After ten
years in this capacity, he became editor and part proprietor of <i>The
Industrial Australian</i>.</p>

<p>At present he is living in Melbourne, engaged in commerce as a company
director, interested mainly in tin-dredging and gold-mining. He has always
been a keen student of the life and habits of our unique Australian animals.
This year he is President of the Royal Zoological Society of Victoria, and he
has signalised his tenure of this important position by writing a book which
will arouse interest not only throughout Australia but throughout the
world.</p>

<p><i>The Lore of the Lyrebird</i>, to be published shortly by The Endeavour
Press, describes very fully the habits and characteristics of one of the most
beautiful and rare and certainly the most intelligent of the world's wild
creatures&mdash;the lyrebird.</p>

<p>Mr. Pratt, with other Victorian naturalists, has made a special study of
this glorious creature&mdash;a bird so shy that little was known of it
previously. The friendship of a wild male lyrebird with a widowed lady named
Mrs. Wilkinson, of Sherbrooke Gully, was the "Miracle of the Dandenongs" that
enabled these observations to be made. Numerous photographs accompany the
gracefully-written text, to which Sir Colin Mackenzie has contributed a
foreword. <i>The Lore of the Lyrebird</i> at last clears up the mystery of
"Australia's avian aristocrat."</p>

<p>Mr. Ambrose Pratt thus crowns a lifetime of fine literary achievement with
a book which will be a wonderful advertisement of one of the most beautiful
forms of life in Australia of which the world has hitherto known little, or
nothing at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Pratt's new book is a splendid example of the value to this nation of
encouraging its own writers. Only the writer can tell the world what a
wonderful country Australia really is.</p>

THE TRUE STORY OF AIDAN DE BRUNE<br>
(HERBERT CHARLES CULL)</a></h2>--

<br>

<h3>Aidan de Brune, 1874-1946</h3>

<p class="first">AIDAN DE BRUNE was the pseudonym of Herbert Charles Cull,
who was born in London in 1874. He married Ethel Crofts in 1907 and in 1909 a son, Lionel, was born. In 1910 he came to Australia, arriving in Fremantle, Western Australia, in May. His wife and child followed, arriving in Albany, Western Australia, in November 1910. His arrival document gave his occupation as "Printer."
In October 1912 his wife and son returned to England. Herbert Cull remained in Australia for the rest of his life. By 1917 he was living in West Perth; a year or so later in the small coastal port of Bunbury, south of Perth.</p>

<p>By then he was using variations of the names Herbert Charles Frank de
Broune Culle, and working for the <i>Bunbury Herald</i> newspaper. Here was
published his first identifiable serial: <i>The Pursuits of Peter Pell</i>,
an episodic novel in 12 parts, set in Perth. The author was 'Frank de
Broune'. Another serial by 'Frank de Broune', <i>The Nine Stars Mystery</i>,
began in the <i>Herald</i> on 28 May 1920 but was left unfinished,
terminating abruptly on 5 November. The style of this unfinished novel is
unmistakably Aidan de Brune's.</p>

<p>On 24 November 1920, he set out to walk from Fremantle to Sydney, on the
opposite side of the continent, using the name Aidan de Broune. He claimed it
was for a wager. Ninety days later he arrived in Sydney, having crossed the
waterless and treeless Nullarbor Plain in high summer. He followed the
Trans-Australia Railway Line, moving from fettlers' camp to fettlers' camp.
The experience gave him meterial for a short story "Just a Woolly" (1922),
which may, indirectly, offer an explanation of why he quit Bunbury and his
job, and an unfinished serial.</p>

<p>In Sydney his name became fixed as Aidan de Brune, and he made a deal with
the newly founded <i>Sydney Mail</i>. He would walk all the way around
Australia, more than 10,000 miles, and the <i>Mail</i> would publish his
articles on his walk. Thus, instead of becoming one of the many unemployed
swagmen of the era, he had the higher status of employed reporter on a
professional mission. This amazing walk, the first in Australia's history,
took more than two years. It naturally included crossing the Nullarbor a
second time, this time along the coastal route of the overland Telegraph Line
via Eucla. By the time it was over, he was a celebrity.</p>

<p>Back in Sydney, de Brune embarked on a career as writer of newspaper
serials. Such serials had been a staple of Australian newspapers, specially
rural newspapers, for many years. First, however, he published a hardback
novel, <i>The Carson Loan Mystery</i>, in 1926, which was not a serial. Then
the serial flood began; he turned out three full length serial novels a year
at his peak. Several of them were also published in New Zealand newspapers.
He also used another pen-name, John Morriss, for some of his output.</p>

<p>By 1936 the flood of serials was over, and de Brune evidently retired from
his literary career, aged 62. He died in a nursing home in 1946, a few months
short of his 72nd birthday.</p>

<p>After his death, the works of Aidan de Brune disappeared into obscurity,
although occasionally one of his rare books can still be found for sale.</p>

<p>In 2017 he was rediscovered by Terry Walker, an inveterate trawler of the
Australian National Library's on-line newspaper resource TROVE, when he
spotted de Brune's "autobiography" in the Australian Authors series. This
included a list of his titles up to 1933. Once Gutenberg Australia and Roy
Glashan's Library, both publishers of free e-books in the Australian public
domain, became interested, the entire fiction output was rescued, sometimes
with difficulty, from TROVE and from library sources. This also led to the
discovery of De Brune's notebooks from his epic walk around Australia,
together with a typed up book of the diary entries, held in the Mitchell
Library in N.S.W., to be made available as an e-book with his other
works.</p>

<p>The real identity of Aidan de Brune was uncovered when Project Gutenberg
Australia's Colin Choat found an item in a 1938 issue of Sydney's <i>Labor
Daily</i>, (successor to the <i>Mail</i>). N.S.W. police had received an
enquiry forwarded from the Western Australian police. De Brune's wife in
England was asking for information about her husband Herbert Charles Cull,
last heard of in Perth Western Australia in 1913. The <i>Labor Daily</i>
staff identified him promptly as Aidan de Brune, who had recently been seen
walking his dog in a Sydney city park. No doubt this was passed to the N.S.W.
police who advised the WA police, and a discreet silence then reigned.</p>

<p>The identity was further confirmed when two items in the <i>Bunbury
Herald</i> were unearthed. The first was about "de Broune's" walk to Sydney;
the second about de Brune as he approached Perth on his Great Walk. They both
identified him with the Bunbury name better known to <i>Herald</i> readers as
"de Broune" Culle. Research in genealogical resources confirmed all the
biographic data given in this short profile. His son Lionel Charles Cull
later migrated to Western Australia.</p>

<p>For such a short fiction writing career, de Brune's output was
considerable: 19 novel-length works, one published exclusively in book form,
seventeen as serials, and one as an unfinished serial; two novelettes
published as serials; and 15 known short stories. Included in this output was
a trilogy which increasingly evolved into fantasy, featuring Dr. Night, a
drab and colourless little man with a central Asian background, using diverse
schemes to fund the rebuilding of a long defunct kingdom of which he is the
heir: <i>Dr Night</i> (1926), <i>The Green Pearl</i> (1930), and
<i>Whispering Death</i> (1931).</p>

<p>Other serials not mentioned above are: <i>The Phantom Launch</i> (1927),
<i>The Dagger and Cord</i> (1927), <i>The Shadow Crook</i> (1929), <i>The
Little Grey Woman</i> (1929), <i>The League of Five</i> (1930); <i>The
Unlawful Adventure</i> (1930), <i>Douchard's Island</i> (novelette, 1931),
<i>The Mystery of Madlands</i> (1931), <i>Find This Man</i> (1931), <i>The
Grays Manor Mystery</i> (1932), <i>The Three Snails</i> (novelette, 1932),
<i>The Kahm Syndicate</i> (1934), <i>The Flirting Fool</i> (1934),
<i>Cain</i> (1934; by John Morriss; republished in 1938 as T<i>he Framing of
Inspector Denvers</i> by Aidan de Brune); <i>The Fortune-Telling House</i>
(1935), and <i>Saul and the Spinster</i> (1935).</p>

<p><i>The Grays Manor Mystery</i> and the aborted <i>Nine Stars Mystery</i>
(1920) were set in England. <i>Douchard's Island</i> seems to be set in North
Queensland. <i>The Pursuits of Peter Pell</i> is set in Western Australia.
The rest were set in and around Sydney.</p>

<p>With the exception of the aborted, incomplete <i>The Nine Stars
Mystery</i>, all of his serials have been recovered, along with some fifteen
short stories. They are being made available progressively as free e-books by
Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library.</p>
