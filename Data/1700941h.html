<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">"I THINK you have the essential facts of the
case now, Mr. Dening," Sir John McNiven, seated at the head of
the long boardroom table, sighed, almost in relief. "Of course,
you understand there are reasons why we do not wish the matter to
become public."</p>

<p>Richard Dening nodded briefly. He quite understood the
knight's meaning. He glanced from one to the other of the seven
men seated at the table, tensed and expectant. What bond held
these seven men together? What common link could there be between
them? Normally, they could have nothing in common.</p>

<p>That morning he had received a letter from Sir John McNiven,
the managing director of the Altona Trading Company, requesting
him to call on him at the company's offices that afternoon. The
letter did not state the business Sir John proposed to discuss.
Very vaguely worded, it had aroused the barrister's curiosity,
causing him to waive his accustomed practice of only acting
through the principal's solicitors. He had telephoned a brief
acceptance of the invitation.</p>

<p>Immediately on giving his name to the inquiry clerk in the
General Offices of the company, he had been escorted to Sir
John's private room. The knight had barely taken time to greet
him before leading him to the company's boardroom. There he had
found the other six men awaiting him. Very particularly he had
been introduced to them, one by one.</p>

<p>Most of them he knew by repute, and&mdash;Immediately the
question formed in his mind. What were these men doing
together&mdash;in that room?</p>

<p>Although he was familiar with the appearance and reputation of
the seven men, with only one had he any acquaintance. That man
was Reuben Gray, the younger son of an impoverished house, living
on the fringe of bankruptcy; good-looking, debonair, not lazy,
but entirely idle; a fashion's darling, more at home in exclusive
west-end drawing rooms than in a city boardroom.</p>

<p>The remaining six men were wealthy. Sir John McNiven held
large interests in many prosperous companies, although his main
activities were centred in the Altona Trading Company, a firm of
excellent repute conducting an enormous trade in the East and
India. Aaron Parotta was a newcomer in the world of finance.
Recently he had come into prominence through the building and
organising of elaborate gambling casinos in European pleasure
resorts. Rudolph N. Rudder was an American. Rumour held that he
controlled big interests in the rum-running organisations that
had St. Pierre and Miquelon, two islands in the North Atlantic,
for headquarters of their illegal trade.</p>

<p>He had immediately recognised Sydney Kedwell on entering the
room. "Black Ked" had an international reputation, and his
features had for years decorated the sporting pages of the
newspapers. Rising quickly to fame, he had, for three years, held
undisputed sway as champion heavyweight boxer. Suddenly he had
relinquished the title, to become the controlling force in
London's night-club life.</p>

<p>Baron Otto von Rosenfeld was, until that moment, but a name.
Very few photographs of the man, who had welded the chemical
companies of Germany into a powerful combine, had ever appeared
in print. Yet, in the streets of finance his was a name to
conjure with. He was enormously wealthy, as wealthy as he was
gross of body and full of face.</p>

<p>The last member of the party gathered to meet him was Anton
Letoit. Dening knew him to be another quick-rising star in the
financial firmament. In Paris he was idolised by newspapers and
the unthinking populace. Rumour credited him with being the brain
and moving force behind the stabilisation of the franc. A typical
Frenchman in appearance; yet now he sat silent and morose, hardly
acknowledging the barrister's advent.</p>

<p>Abruptly Dening turned his attention to the man at the head of
the table.</p>

<p>"Please forgive me, Sir John," he spoke slowly. "I can hardly
accept your statement as complete."</p>

<p>The knight flushed. "I beg your pardon, Mr. Dening."</p>

<p>"Is it necessary for me to explain?" A slight smile came on
the young man's lips. "If so, then&mdash;But, let me explain my
own position first." He paused, glancing round the table at the
men watching him; then pushed has chair back, slightly, from the
table.</p>

<p>"As you are no doubt aware, Sir John, I am nominally a
barrister. Chance drifted me into another sphere of activity. An
unexpected legacy gave me the means to indulge my
desires&mdash;to allow me to devote my time to an occupation that
intrigued me.</p>

<p>"I suppose I must admit that I am a private investigator of
unusual happenings, with certain reservations." The smile on
Dening's lips broadened. "While practising as a barrister I
chanced to elucidate a mystery that had baffled the police. Other
matters, of a like nature, were brought to me. I was lucky. I
found solutions where others found only failure. I liked the
work, the adventure, the possibilities of excitement. Yet I have
never relinquished my standing as a barrister. To preserve that
status I had to make a rule that I would only act
through&mdash;and by the direct instructions of solicitors acting
for my clients."</p>

<p>"We quite understand that, Mr. Dening." Sir John spoke
quickly. "Perhaps you would prefer to consider this conversation
as informal and to receive formal instructions through my
solicitors?"</p>

<p>"That would be difficult, would it not, Sir John?" Dening
professed to misunderstand the knight. "These gentlemen are not
members of the board of the Altona Trading Company."</p>

<p>"Is that material?" Reuben Gray interjected hastily.</p>

<p>"Only in so far that any firm of solicitors who required my
services would lay the whole facts of the case before me. Sir
John stated that I have now the essential facts of the case. I
regret that I cannot agree with him."</p>

<p>"If your objections are financial, Mr. Dening&mdash;" Sydney
Kedwell spoke loudly.</p>

<p>"They are not, Mr. Kedwell." A sharp tone came in the
barrister's voice. "Have I to tell you gentlemen that it is just
as essential to trust your investigator as you trust your lawyer
or doctor: that is, fully and completely."</p>

<p>A long silence followed; then Dening spoke again.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will permit me to traverse Sir John's statement.
I understand that you gentlemen are engaged in an occupation, or,
should I say an adventure, of a nature you do not care to inform
me of. In the course of that business you came in contact with a
person named Matthew Ashcombe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believed I had explained that, Mr. Dening," Sir John
interrupted. "Mr. Ashcombe wrote to me explaining a method by
which he could be of assistance to us. He made a definite offer.
I placed the offer before my associates and they decided to
accept&mdash;this person's offer."</p>

<p>"Yet you informed me that Matthew Ashcombe is but a name to
you all; that you have never met the man; that not one of you
have any knowledge of his personal appearance; no knowledge,
even, of his address?"</p>

<p>"That is so, Mr. Dening." Anton Letoit spoke in careful,
precise English. "I was in Sir John's company when the letter
arrived, and he showed it to me. I advised acceptance of this
person's offer. I believe that, in a telephone conversation that
happened later, Sir John invited Mr. Ashcombe to call on him,
and he declined."</p>

<p>Sir John nodded. "Matthew Ashcombe definitely stated that he
would only deal with us through correspondence, or over the
telephone."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ashcombe proposed that you gentlemen remunerate him for
his services?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by post."</p>

<p>"By means of a cheque, I presume?"</p>

<p>"He required the payments made by means of bank-notes, sent to
him through the registered post."</p>

<p>"You accepted that condition?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And sent the money in a registered packet. May I ask to what
address?"</p>

<p>"To Grays Manor, Grays, near, Ewell."</p>

<p>"To Grays Manor?" Dening turned to face the young society man.
"I think, Mr. Gray, that you are the man who can give me the best
account of that place."</p>

<p>"Sir John's knowledge is more up to date than mine," Reuben
Gray laughed slightly. "Of course, at one time the manor belonged
to my family. Over twenty years ago my father sold the estate to
Sir John McNiven."</p>

<p>"You live at Grays Manor, Sir John?" The barrister carefully
suppressed his surprise.</p>

<p>"I live within half a mile of the manor, Mr. Dening." A slight
frown came on the financier's face. "The manor is a ruin, and has
been one for many years."</p>

<p>"Yet Matthew Ashcombe directed that a valuable registered
package be addressed to him there?"</p>

<p>Sir John and Reuben Gray both nodded.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the parcel was sent?" Dening accented the question.
"I presume the post-office returned it to you marked 'addressee
unknown?'"</p>

<p>"The packet was delivered and acknowledged," Gray answered
briefly.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry; I don't understand." Dening spoke after a
considerable pause. "Am I to understand that Sir John forwarded
by registered post to this person a package containing bank-notes
amounting to&mdash;" Again he paused, glancing interrogatively at
the knight.</p>

<p>"Five thousand pounds," the financier answered
reluctantly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am very dense," Dening laughed lightly. "Let me
put the question in another form. Mr. Ashcombe engaged to perform
certain work and in return was to be paid five thousand pounds.
At his request that sum, in bank-notes of small denomination, was
forwarded to him through the post. The address given was a
ruined, uninhabitable house. Yet that package was delivered and
duly acknowledged."</p>

<p>"That is correct," Gray answered, his voice very flat.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;someone must live there."</p>

<p>"That is impossible, the place is not habitable." Irritation
showed in the knight's voice. "Grays Manor stands on my land.
When I bought the estate I consulted architects, wishing to have
the place properly restored. They informed me that it was
impossible; that the only thing possible was to pull the ruins
down and rebuild to the original design. I then built Upton Lodge
about half a mile from Grays Manor."</p>

<p>"You still assure me that a registered packet was sent to
Grays Manor, delivered and acknowledged?" Dening waited a moment,
then pushed his chair still further back from the table. "Sir
John, I regret I cannot accept that explanation."</p>

<p>"Yet we have to accept it," Gray broke in almost roughly, his
fair face flushed. "Look here, Dening; I give you my word that
what we have said is purely fact. I am not going to attempt an
explanation&mdash;I cannot."</p>

<p>Dening shook his head slowly. He had to accept Gray's word
that the statements made were true; but he was assured, in his
own mind, that he had not been told all the facts.</p>

<p>Almost, he was inclined to leave the room; to have nothing
further to do with these men. Yet the mystery surrounding the
packet of bank-notes, the secretive actions of the man naming
himself Matthew Ashcombe, intrigued him. If he could make these
men talk, some casual, unguarded word might place him on the
track of the truth they appeared determined to conceal.</p>

<p>"I cannot refuse your definite assurance." The barrister spoke
reluctantly. "Will you tell me, Sir John, was this the last you
heard from Matthew Ashcombe?"</p>

<p>"About two months later he wrote me&mdash;this." Sir John
pushed a letter that lay on the table towards the investigator.
"You have read it?"</p>

<p>Yet Dening again picked up the letter and read it carefully.
It was very guardedly worded. In view of the previous facts
recounted by the knight, in view of the reluctance of these men
to explain their common business with the writer of the letter,
there underlay the simple words a sinister note.</p>

<p>"We all received similar letters." Gray laughed lightly, as he
reached for his pocket book. "I can assure you, Mr. Dening, that
all are in identical terms."</p>

<p>"You mean that Mr. Ashcombe applied to each one of you,
individually for a loan of ten thousand pounds? Seventy thousand
pounds in all?"</p>

<p>A series of nods answered his quick glance around the
table.</p>

<p>"May I ask what action you then took? I notice this note is
dated over a fortnight ago."</p>

<p>"We decided to forward a sum of money, with a covering letter
stating that we did not feel justified in advancing a larger
sum."</p>

<p>"You forwarded that money to Grays Manor?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I presume in bank-notes of small denominations, as before.
Was that package also received and acknowledged?"</p>

<p>"The package was returned to me."</p>

<p>"With a message?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The&mdash;the man telephoned that the sum was not
sufficient, and that he could not accept marked money."</p>

<p>"Got his wits about him," Rudder laughed loudly.</p>

<p>"I suppose you did not think to mark the notes in the first
payment, Sir John?" Dening asked interestedly.</p>

<p>"I did." Sir John flushed slightly. "I marked some of the
notes and took the numbers of all of them."</p>

<p>"Did you succeed in tracing any of the notes?"</p>

<p>"I did," Kedwell interjected. "Some of them turned up in the
receipts of one of my clubs."</p>

<p>"That was a step," the barrister nodded. "I suppose you tried
to discover who paid them in."</p>

<p>"Wasn't possible," the ex-boxer laughed harshly. "There's too
many small notes floating about a night-club. Besides, my people
weren't on the watch; they hadn't been warned; and I wasn't at
the club that night myself. I doubt if I should have noticed them
if I had been. Sir John told me that he had marked the notes, but
I never expected them to turn up at the Blue Heaven."</p>

<p>"Where were you?"</p>

<p>"What the hell's that to do with you?" The man spoke angrily.
"Let me tell you, I've other private interests than this game,
profitable as it is. I'm not going to tell you my private
business, or anyone, not even to catch that skunk, Matthew
Ashcombe."</p>

<p>Reuben Gray laughed suddenly. "Nice lot, aren't we, Dening?
Dealing with blackmailers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mind your own damned business." Black Ked was on his feet,
glowering angrily across the table. "I don't interfere with your
affairs; keep out of mine. Understand?"</p>

<p>Dening's quick eyes caught the warning glance that passed
between the knight and the ex-boxer. Kedwell suddenly subsided
into his seat. A sudden suspicion, an almost improbable idea,
dawned in the barrister's mind. Would that explain the unnatural
reticence of these men?</p>

<p>"Let me try to understand." His cool voice dominated the
antagonism that was growing in the room. "You wish me to discover
a man named Matthew Ashcombe, who gave you an address at Grays
Manor, an old ruin. You definitely state that the only clue you
can give me is that certain registered packages have been sent
to him at that address and received&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is one other matter on which Sir John has not informed
you, Mr. Dening." Gray's tones were uneven. "I think you should
know it and, for the life of me, I can't understand why he has
not mentioned it. Of course, we agreed that he was to do all the
talking, although we all wished to hear what he had to
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that, Mr. Gray?"</p>

<p>"Just this. After Sir John sent the first bundle of money I
suggested that we should take some steps to discover who Matthew
Ashcombe really was. You see, giving his address at my family's
old home, I was rather interested."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, we got Edward Symonds, the big private inquiry man, to
trace the packet of money. I went to Ewell and Grays with him. We
saw the registered articles books." The young man paused
impressively. "Symonds couldn't find a single soul who knew about the packet. There wasn't a delivery man who would
acknowledge that he had taken a registered package to Grays
Manor. He couldn't find a solitary soul at Ewell or Grays who
would acknowledge that the packet had passed through their
hands."</p>

<p>Dening was bewildered.</p>

<p>"You are assuring me that the package passed through the
registered post, yet you and Symonds could not find a postal
employee who acknowledged handling it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Gray nodded. For some moments the barrister sat, considering.
Suddenly he looked up at Sir John McNiven. "Sir John, you stated
that in the first instance you received a letter from Matthew
Ashcombe offering you and your associates certain services. Have
you that letter?"</p>

<p>The knight nodded.</p>

<p>"I should like to have that letter."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that is impossible." Sir John answered without
hesitation. "That letter contains&mdash;er&mdash;information that
cannot pass out of my hands."</p>

<p>"I want a signature of Matthew Ashcombe."</p>

<p>"There is his signature." The knight indicated the letter that
lay before the barrister. "Am I to understand that you will
accept our commission to investigate the mystery, Mr.
Dening?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Dening stood up quickly, a bright light shining in his
eyes. "Yes, I will investigate the problem, and I warn you that I
will uncover the whole matter. There is much to be explained, but
one thing is very clear."</p>

<p>"And that, Dening?" Gray was on his feet, facing the
barrister, a strange tenseness about his rather weak mouth.</p>

<p>"If you really wish to know, Mr. Gray&mdash;" For a moment the
barrister paused. "If you really wish to know, I firmly believe
that Matthew Ashcombe is in this room, at this moment."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">RICHARD DENING was smiling quietly as he passed
down the steps from Altona House into Arundel Street. In his mind
was the spectacle of the seven dumbfounded men in the boardroom
of the Altona Trading Company; yet, with their outward show of
astonishment he believed to be mingled some sense of fear. He had
not spoken on sudden impulse, or at the urge of a newly formed
theory. He had decided to undertake the inquiry some time before
he left the room. His final questions had been carefully
calculated to evoke some show of emotion from the men gathered
about the table.</p>

<p>Now he wondered if he had succeeded. Had he been able to read
more than astonishment into the glances that had followed him
from the room? For some moments he stood on the pavement, deep in
thought, then, glancing at his watch, walked up the slight
incline to the Strand. There he again looked at his watch. Should
he go back to his chambers and wait for some move he believed
would be made by one of the men he had just left, or immediately
start on the plan that was slowly forming in his mind?</p>

<p>A moment's thought and he raised his stick, hailing a passing
taxi. He gave the address of the Karmel Club as he entered the
vehicle. During the short drive he forced the problem he had
undertaken to solve, from his mind. For the moment he would
neither wait for his opponents to move nor take any definite step
himself. He wanted more information; information that only one of
the seven men could provide and Reuben Gray was a member of the
Karmel Club.</p>

<p>In the club he sought a quiet corner where he could keep a
watch on the members entering the club, then abandoned himself
to reflections. The story Sir John McNiven had told that
afternoon had completely intrigued him. Obviously much had been
left unsaid; much that was of importance to him in his
investigations; much that bore on the connection that bound these
men of diverse views and objectives in one common tie. What
mutual interest linked these men together? He knew that,
individually, they were wealthy, with the exception of Reuben
Gray; that, collectively, they represented a very large power in
the financial world. Rapidly he scanned his knowledge of
them.</p>

<p>Rumour reported that most of them were none too scrupulous in
their methods of conducting business; yet, not one of them had
ever wandered outside the rather fragile barriers of commercial
morality&mdash;or, if they had, they had succeeded in not being
found out. He knew that to succeed in his quest he had more to
do than to uncover the identity of Matthew Ashcombe. He had to
find the common bond that held these men; men who distrusted, if
they did not absolutely hate, one another.</p>

<p>Yes; he was certain that "hate" must be applied to the major
emotion that linked these men. Whatever interest had brought them
together, hate had replaced it&mdash;hatred and fear. That he had
read in their glances while he probed the strange story Sir John
McNiven had told him, relating to Matthew Ashcombe,
blackmailer.</p>

<p>A happy family. Dening smiled grimly as he reviewed his
clients. A gambling house manager; a rum-runner of prohibition
America; an ex-boxer, night club proprietor; and three
financiers, serving opposite national interests. Lastly, a young
man, reputed to be financially embarrassed. The younger son of an
impoverished house; a loiterer on the fringe of society, swimming
with the current, yet owning no visible means by which he kept
afloat.</p>

<p>Truly a happy family; so united that they could not depute any
one or more of their number to interview him. So distrustful of
each other that they had to sit and watch&mdash;listen to all
that was said.</p>

<p>Again Dening saw, mentally, the gross unwieldy body of Baron
Rosenfeld, eyes half-closed, yet probing the hidden meaning of
every word that was spoken around him; the sharp ferret eyes of
the Frenchman, who had broken the silence with one short
statement.</p>

<p>He laughed gently. Had he deceived them? Did they believe that
he would proceed on the quest they had set him blindfold? He
asked himself the question: Would he have taken the commission
they had offered if they had acted differently? Honestly, he
answered himself&mdash;he would not.</p>

<p>In spite of his preoccupation, Dening's eyes had searched the
moving throng for the man he sought. At half-past six he shrugged
slightly and rose from his seat. Reuben Gray would not come to
the club that evening. Possibly he had some social engagement. He
mounted the wide stairs to the dining room. On the threshold he
paused to scan the tables, still seeking his man.</p>

<p>"Lo, Dening." He turned, to face a tall military-looking man,
leaning heavily on a stout stick. "Dining with anyone?"</p>

<p>"No engagements, colonel. Going to dine with me? Delighted.
Come on! François always keeps a corner table for me."</p>

<p>Dening was genuinely pleased to meet the old man. Colonel
Middleton was always an interesting companion. To-night he was
specially welcome, for he was a connection of the Gray family and
might possibly be able to impart information of value, if
properly handled.</p>

<p>"Well, m'boy?" Colonel Middleton looked up sharply when he had
satisfactorily settled with the club waiter the important
question of the moment and had time for minor affairs. "What's
the latest scandal? Still probing mysteries."</p>

<p>"Yes." The barrister decided on a bold stroke. "Perhaps you
can help me, if you will. I'm engaged on a matter that has some
relation to the Gray family's old estate. You are some connection
with the family, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Grays Manor?" The old man peered up sharply from beneath
shaggy white brows. "The Grays sold it years ago. Belongs to Sir
John McNiven now. What's he been up to, the damned old
scoundrel?"</p>

<p>"So that's your opinion of one of our leading financial
props," Dening laughed gently.</p>

<p>"Not mine only. It's public opinion, sir. That man will finish
up in jail, mark my word."</p>

<p>"He may engage men to keep him out of it, colonel." The
younger man paused a moment. He had his guest on the wrong line.
Far better he asked his questions direct. "Colonel, what is your
opinion of Reuben Gray? You know him, of course?"</p>

<p>"Ought to." For a few seconds Middleton devoted his attention
to his plate, then looked up sharply. "Go on, man. I know him.
He's my godson, though I ain't proud of the fact. What's he been
up to now?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much. Only a sideline on a lost registered letter,
but the case has certain uncommon features." Dening tried to make
his voice very careless. "I thought I'd like to get a line on
him. You see, I don't know him very well; he's only a club
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Not been up to any mischief, has he?" Again the keen old eyes
searched the barrister's face.</p>

<p>"Not to my knowledge. You say he's your godson. Then you ought
to know him well. What is your opinion of him?"</p>

<p>"Straight, so far as I know. All the Grays are straight; it's
their chief failing in this world of crookedness, otherwise
they'd be better off. As for Reuben, he's got ability, if the
young scoundrel cared to use it; but all he does is to fool about
on nothing a year. How he manages I don't know. Last time he
honoured me with a visit I offered him a hundred for the recipe.
Damned useful thing to have in these days of income taxes,
super-taxes and H.C.L. He laughed in my face; blasted young
scoundrel; not a bit of respect for his elders."</p>

<p>"I think you said that the Grays had to sell the family
estates," questioned the barrister cautiously.</p>

<p>"Grays Manor. Lord, Reuben's got nothing to do with that
place. Why, he wasn't even born until long after it was sold.
'Course I know Grays Manor. Stayed there umpteen times when old
Sir Luke had it. He was George's father, y'know. Reuben's
George's fifth son. George sold the place; no money for repairs,
no money to live in it, and the only thing that kept the roof and
walls together were the mortgages. Fact."</p>

<p>"Pity," Dening mused. "Believe the place was in the family for
quite a time. The Grays were one of the old Surrey families."</p>

<p>For half a minute there was silence, then Colonel Middleton
burst into a great guffaw. "Pumping me for the family history."
The old man enjoyed the joke thoroughly. "Well, well. What will
you young fellows be up to next? I'd have blackballed you here,
young Dening, if I'd known you were going to bring shop into the
place. Still, just for once, I'll talk."</p>

<p>For a few seconds he devoted his attention to his dinner; then
he looked up, a little smile crinkling his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ever been to Grays? Well, it'd interest you. Fine place, if
it is a ruin now. That man, McNiven, ought to be scragged for not
making something of it; but he says he can't, it's too far gone,
and those scoundrels of architects back him up in it. Grays was a
damned fine place when I was your age. I stayed there often
enough. They got it from one of the Stuarts, something to do with
a love affair, I believe, but that's scandal. Anyway, the Grays
held the place and quite a slice of the country for quite a
while; in spite of their fondness for the pasteboards and the
gee-gees. Sir Luke was the last of the bunch to hold it. When he
died it went to George, and he found that he'd inherited half the
Jews in London, and that's all. Someone had the sense to advise
him to sell. Wisest thing he's done. Moved to London and became a
guinea-pig. That's all he's had to live on. Married and brought
up a family of five, all boys. As I've said, Reuben's the
youngest of the brood. That what you wanted to know?"</p>

<p>"Only one thing more, colonel." Dening spoke directly. "How
old is Reuben Gray? You said that Sir George sold the estates
before Reuben was born, but Sir John McNiven told me to-day that
he had only held the place for the past twenty years."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's in it, eh?" Middleton peered suspiciously across the
table. "If he told you that he only bought the place twenty years
ago he's a liar, but I knew that before. Let me see; Reuben's
twenty-eight or twenty-nine. No, twenty-eight. George sold the
place two years before he came to live in London and drag his
family name through the Throgmorton Street gutters. That makes
thirty years. Then he married about a year after he sold the
family pride, as well as the family estates, to the Jews; and
Reuben was born six years later. Lord! Why it's nigh on forty
years since George left Grays. Now, who'd have thought that?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps there was a previous purchaser before Sir John
McNiven?" hazarded the barrister.</p>

<p>"Not on your life," the colonel was positive. "I was at Grays
when Sir John came there to look it over. George was living in
the lodge, the only place on the land fit to live in. He and the
money-knight had quite a set-to and I sat in the window seat and
watched it. Thought it'd come to a dust up, and George could use
his hands. Anyway, they got to some sort of terms and the lawyers
patched up the sale. That what you want to know, young
Dening?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, yes."</p>

<p>"Nothing more?" Colonel Middleton sat back with a sigh of
relief. "Now then, Richard Dening, what's Reuben been up to?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." The barrister smiled slightly. "No, colonel,
that's the truth. He's in the affair and yet he's not. So far as
I know he's one of the innocent parties. What I've got to
discover is the identity of the guilty man."</p>

<p>"The guilty man? Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Exactly what I want to know, but he's not Reuben."</p>

<p>Yet the barrister had a doubt. Could he absolve any of the
seven men he had met that afternoon?</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take your say-so." Colonel Middleton rose to his
feet. "What are you doing, Dening? How about cutting into a game
of bridge?"</p>

<p>The barrister shook his head, pleading urgent business.
Obtaining hat and stick, he strolled out on to the streets,
turning in the direction of the city.</p>

<p>It was not eight o'clock, and he did not feel inclined for
work, although plenty awaited him at his chambers. He had no
social engagements, and no urge to seek companionship. Idly
strolling through the hurrying pleasure-bent crowds, he came to
Temple Bar and crossed the old, grey gates that guarded the
Temple. Colonel Middleton had had little to tell him. Only the
fact that the Grays Manor estates had passed from the family more
than thirty years ago. Why had Sir John McNiven deliberately
deceived him in that fact?</p>

<p>And Reuben Gray had sat at the table listening. He had known
that the financier had not told the truth; yet he had allowed the
lie to pass. Dening wondered how many truths and half truths and
deliberate lies had been told him that afternoon.</p>

<p>He walked down the lane some hundred and fifty yards, until
almost at the narrow entrance to Fern Court, then stopped
abruptly. Something had sharply impinged on the Wall close to his
head, dropping to the pavement with a little thud. He looked up.
There was a new mark on the old bricks, only about an inch above
his head. Some brick-dust had fallen on his shoulder. He brushed
it away. Whatever had hit the wall had fallen to the pavement
almost at his feet.</p>

<p>A few minutes search and he picked up a nickel coated
bullet.</p>

<p>For a few moments he stared around him, amazed. Then he
glanced up at the mark again, stepping back to where he had stood
when the bullet struck the wall. Turning carefully, he faced the
direction from which he believed the bullet had come. He was
facing an open court, the centre of which was occupied by a large
fountain, surrounded by potted shrubs and palms.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood peering across the roadway, in the
gathering evening gloom, then, seeing some movement among the
shrubbery, he jumped forward to run across to the fountain. On
the edge of the curb his foot slipped and he fell heavily to the
road. At the same time he heard the "phut" of a silenced rifle,
and another bullet struck the wall of the house.</p>

<p>Springing to his feet, greatly shaken, Dening saw a man
running swiftly down the roadway in the direction of the
Embankment Gardens.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a moment Dening hesitated. He would have
liked to pursue the man, but he had not a hope of overtaking him
in the evening gloom. With a shrug he turned into Fern Court and
made for his chambers. As he felt for his key the door was
opened, Mick Regan welcoming him with a broad grin on his
wrinkled old face.</p>

<p>Mick Regan was well known in the Temple. At one time valet to
Sir Vincent Dening, Richard's father, the young man had brought
him to the Temple on his father's death. Now, to Dening the old
valet was more than friend and valet; he was an integral part of
the business of the chambers.</p>

<p>"Gentleman to see you, Master Richard." Mick relieved Dening
of hat and stick; then without question picked up a brush and
carefully removed all signs of the barrister's fall on the
road.</p>

<p>"A Mr. Reuben Gray. Said he knew you, Master Richard, and
wanted your advice."</p>

<p>"Reuben Gray!" Dening was surprised. He turned to the study.
As he entered the room he saw the young man standing at one of
the windows. Hearing the door open, Gray turned and advanced to
meet the barrister.</p>

<p>"Your man said you wouldn't be long, Dening." Gray spoke
easily. "I thought you would not mind me waiting."</p>

<p>"Haven't been waiting long, I trust?" Dening motioned to a
comfortable chair. "Hope Mick looked after you? Ah, I see he
did." He nodded at the tray on the corner if the desk.</p>

<p>"Mighty good man, that of yours!" the young man laughed. "Wish
I could pick up one like him. The men one gets nowadays&mdash;" A
shrug completed the sentence.</p>

<p>"Cigarette?" Dening, passed a box. He waited while Gray
obtained a light. "Mick said you wanted to consult me?"</p>

<p>"About this afternoon, yes." A frown came on the young man's
fair face. "Fact is, Dening, I&mdash;we are in a devil of a hole.
I didn't like what Sir John said this afternoon&mdash;so thought
I'd have a word with you on the quiet. Of course, I've got to
tail it with the rest of the crowd, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rather a secretive lot." The barrister spoke carelessly.</p>

<p>"We've got to be." Gray paused embarrassedly. "You see, while
what we're after isn't quite illegal&mdash;if it got
known&mdash;" He hesitated. "&mdash;well, it's damned
profitable."</p>

<p>"So profitable that Matthew Ashcombe thought his silence worth
sixty thousand pounds?" suggested-Dening.</p>

<p>"Seventy&mdash;" Gray paused and stared. "Oh, I understand.
You're still sticking to that theory of yours?"</p>

<p>"That one of the seven men around that table this afternoon
was, or is, Matthew Ashcombe&mdash;yes." The barrister waited a
moment, then added: "I believe there are others who have a like
opinion. Shall I say you, for instance?"</p>

<p>Gray nodded. "Can't get away from it."</p>

<p>"Especially when the address given by Matthew Ashcombe is
'Grays Manor?'"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" the young man asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Very little," the barrister laughed. "Others might think that
a place as old as Grays Manor might hold secrets, shall we
say&mdash;not known to the present proprietor?"</p>

<p>Again there was silence; Dening knew that he had made a point.
Gray well knew that among his associates, certain suspicions
pointed strongly in his direction.</p>

<p>"Of course there are others of your associates open to
suspicion," the barrister continued easily. "Sir John for one. He
has lived at Grays for over twenty years, he told me. A rich man,
naturally he commands much influence in the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"You believe that someone at Grays really received the
registered packets and signed for them?" the young man asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Naturally. But remember, I am at present merely voicing
general suspicions. We have no real evidence yet. To consider a
third point&mdash;can you suggest how those marked notes came at
the 'Blue Heaven' nightclub?"</p>

<p>"Kedwell thinks they were paid in by some visitor."</p>

<p>"How many of the marked notes were found?"</p>

<p>"Nine." Gray hesitated, then continued: "I think I see what
you are aiming at, Dening."</p>

<p>"They were bank-notes&mdash;not Treasury notes?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then the lowest possible value of the nine notes must be
forty-five pounds. Surely if one visitor continually changed
'fivers' during the evening he would create comment. The waiters
would notice him particularly; possibly become suspicious of the
genuineness of the notes."</p>

<p>The young man did not reply.</p>

<p>"Taking my assumptions as correct, then we must conclude that
no waiter at the night club noticed a customer repeatedly change
bank-notes. In that case the notes did not enter the club by the
usual channel. We must then conclude they were passed into the
club's treasury by someone who knew they were marked and who
exchanged them for unidentifiable notes." Dening paused, then
added: "Mr. Kedwell stated that he was not at the club that night."</p>

<p>"You are suspecting him?" A quick light showed for a second in
the young man's eyes.</p>

<p>"I am suspecting quite a number of people," the barrister
answered promptly. "At present, suspicion points against you, Sir
John McNiven and Kedwell&mdash;and so far the inquiry has not
advanced a single step. Later, others may come under suspicion."
He paused. "I don't think, Gray, that you came here to-night to
suggest possible identities for Matthew Ashcombe. You mentioned
that you were not satisfied with Sir John's statement of the case
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Were you?"</p>

<p>"I believe much was omitted that would help the inquiry."</p>

<p>"Sir John omitted to mention Symonds' inquiry." Gray spoke
after a pause. "That is what I came to see you about. I'd like
you to have a talk with Symonds."</p>

<p>"For what reason? I gathered that Sir John preferred that I
made my own investigations unbiased by conclusions drawn from any
previous inquiry."</p>

<p>"Yet Symonds did a lot of really good spade work."</p>

<p>"You were with him while he made his inquiries?"</p>

<p>"I went with him to Grays." Gray spoke confidently. "We
thought that my knowledge of the locality might be of assistance
to him."</p>

<p>"Yet your knowledge of Grays, and the manor is twenty years
old. Would not Sir John have a better grasp of present-day local
details?"</p>

<p>"Sir John suggested that I accompanied Symonds. I drove him
down in my car."</p>

<p>"Symonds searched Grays Manor?"</p>

<p>"He went over the ruins very thoroughly."</p>

<p>"He made the usual inquiries at the post-office; he examined
every official who might possibly have handled either of the
registered packets?"</p>

<p>"He talked with every official at the post-offices at Grays
and Ewell." The young man spoke emphatically. "He put both the
delivery men at Grays through what was a very close resemblance
to the third degree. They both swore they had never seen a
registered packet addressed to Grays Manor. They laughed at the
idea that they would even take a packet so addressed from the
post-office."</p>

<p>"And the staffs at the post-offices?"</p>

<p>"Not one of them would acknowledge ever seeing such a
package."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Then Symonds came back to London. He made inquiries
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At which offices?"</p>

<p>"The East Strand post-office. Sir John posted the money
there."</p>

<p>"Sir John posted it at the East Strand post-office!" The
barrister spoke thoughtfully. "Has he a receipt&mdash;but of
course he has one."</p>

<p>Gray nodded. "That's all in order," he stated. "We had it on
the table when the matter first came up. The receipt is in order,
I can swear to that."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the officials at the post-office?"</p>

<p>"That's the strangest part of the affair. There's the regular
counterpart of the receipt in the post-office books; yet every
official in the office swears that he never issued it."</p>

<p>"Symonds never let the matter rest there," Dening declared
after a pause. "What of the handwriting on the receipt?"</p>

<p>"He went into that." A puzzled frown came on the young man's
brows. "In some manner he obtained specimens of all the
officials' handwritings. He found a man whose handwriting was
exactly similar to that on the receipt, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" Dening queried.</p>

<p>"That man proved that he was on holidays&mdash;over a hundred
miles from London&mdash;on the date the receipt was issued."</p>

<p>Silence followed, lasting some minutes. Dening was becoming
more and more perplexed at the answers to his questions. So far,
Gray strongly incriminated Sir John with the mysterious Matthew
Ashcombe. But, Sir John McNiven was a very wealthy man. Twice
five thousand pounds would not be sufficient recompense for the
loss of his reputation, unless&mdash;</p>

<p>Dening well knew that in the City of London many men,
accounted wealthy, had at times remarkable difficulties in laying
their hands on comparatively small sums of money. Once a reputed
millionaire had borrowed a sovereign from him to pay for his
lunch, confessing with a laugh that he had not more than a couple
of shillings in actual coinage in his possession. But&mdash;if
Sir John had perpetrated the fraud, how had he worked it?</p>

<p>"What is your opinion of the affair, Gray?" Dening asked at
length.</p>

<p>The young man shrugged. "I don't suspect Sir John."</p>

<p>"Yet he knew that he was addressing a valuable packet to an
uninhabitable ruin?"</p>

<p>"He drew our attention to that fact, immediately we received
Matthew Ashcombe's letter. That is the reason we engaged Symonds.
Sir John suggested that we sent the money in the manner Matthew
Ashcombe instructed, and then tried to trace him on the receipt
of the registered packet. I can't understand how we failed."</p>

<p>"Have you anything to explain personally regarding the affair,
Gray?" Dening put the question, very seriously. "Remember, you
and Sir John are the only two members of your group, who have any
knowledge of Grays Manor. You exonerate Sir John&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And myself, so far as I am able," Gray laughed. "Of course,
that leaves only Kedwell and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;Kedwell?" the barrister asked, when the young man
paused.</p>

<p>"Kedwell is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kedwell states that he was not at the club the night the
money was passed in," reminded Dening.</p>

<p>"He said that&mdash;and he will not say where he was." Gray
spoke with reluctance. "Look here Dening, it isn't fair to keep
you in the dark. I was at the club that night and&mdash;and I saw
Kedwell there."</p>

<p>"With whom?" A note of excitement came in the barrister's
voice.</p>

<p>"With Mrs. Ashford-Lynne." Gray's reluctance to speak showed
more plainly. "They were in one of the curtained recesses. They
were sitting well back in the shadows and I&mdash;and I don't
think anyone could have seen them very well. It happened that as
I passed the alcove Kedwell lit a cigarette and I saw his face
plainly. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>A knock came at the door. In response to Dening's impatient
permission, Mick entered.</p>

<p>"Excuse me. Master Richard. Chief Inspector Lorrimer would
like to have a word with you."</p>

<p>"Lorrimer?" Dening glanced at his companion, who nodded. "Show
him in, Mick."</p>

<p>"The Chief Inspector is down in the court, Master Richard."
There was excitement in the old man's voice. "He wants you to go
down there to him."</p>

<p>"Down in the court? What on earth is he waiting there
for?"</p>

<p>"I think, there's been an accident or something, Master
Richard. He asks that you will go down to him at once."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a few seconds the two young men stared at
Mick in astonishment, then dashed to the door, stumbling down the
stairs in their haste. At the house door Dening, who was in the
lead, hesitated, peering out on the faintly-lit court.</p>

<p>Fern Court is not wide&mdash;a little over sixty feet between
the two lines of houses; yet more than a hundred and fifty feet
in length. On the west side of the court are two narrow houses,
bordering the narrow, six-feet-wide entrance from Temple Lane. At
the east end, the court opens on to a wide walk-way, leading up
to Fleet Street.</p>

<p>Like many of the Temple Courts, Fern Lane is very badly lit by
two inferior-powered standard lamps, placed far on either side of
the erection of tubbed plants that decorate the centre of the
court. Over the doorways of the houses are old-fashioned, square
glass cages, that held oil lamps in the days when they were the
only public illumination. Now they were never used.</p>

<p>Under the light-standard at the east end of the court a
solitary figure was standing. As Dening appeared on the doorstep
the man raised his arm in signal. Before they reached where Chief
Inspector Lorrimer was standing the two men saw that at his feet
rested what they took to be a bundle of loose clothing. Dening
peered down and with a shock recognised that the bundle was a
recumbent man.</p>

<p>"Glad you were in, Mr. Dening." The police officer, a short,
dark, clean-shaven man with bright black eyes, spoke
imperatively. "I knew you wouldn't mind me disturbing you for
that."</p>

<p>He nodded at the man at his feet. Passing the Chief Inspector,
Dening bent over the man. He was lying face downwards, one of his
arms bent strangely under him. With dawning horror the barrister
recognised that from under the body welled out a dark stream of
blood. He looked up quickly at Lorrimer. "Murdered?"</p>

<p>"Can't be anything else." The police officer nodded. "I
haven't disturbed him yet. By the bye, Mr. Dening, when I asked your man to get you down to me, I also asked him to ring up the
Yard. Hope you don't mind. I've been here all of ten minutes and
Mick is the first person I've seen until you appeared."</p>

<p>"Mick?" Dening looked round quickly. "What was Mick doing down
here?"</p>

<p>"Said he was going up to Fleet Street to get some tobacco. He
came into the Court after I found him." The detective nodded at
the corpse. "One might as well be on a lonely country road as in
the Temple as this hour of the night."</p>

<p>"It is quiet here." The barrister nodded understandingly. He
looked down at the body. "How was he killed? Shot?"</p>

<p>Lorrimer shook his head.</p>

<p>"If you care to kneel down and squint under his chest you'll
see the haft of a knife. Stabbed in the chest, so far as I can
see at the moment. Awful lights they have here. Can't see a
thing."</p>

<p>"There's a powerful torch in my desk." Dening straightened
abruptly. "I'll fetch it." He turned towards his house.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, Mr. Dening, perhaps this gentleman can get
it; he's with you, isn't he? Perhaps Mick can find it for
him."</p>

<p>"Of course," Gray answered quickly. "I'll get it in a jiffy,
Dening."</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray&mdash;Reuben Gray." The barrister answered the
unspoken question in the detective's glance. "He was in my
chambers when I got your message. Came down here with me."</p>

<p>"Been in your chambers long, sir?"</p>

<p>"Half an hour or more. Why, Lorrimer?"</p>

<p>"This didn't happen so long ago." The Chief Inspector turned
to face the corpse. "I wasn't quite correct when I said that I
hadn't touched him. Fact, I did. Thought he was in a fit or
faint, and went to roll him over and found&mdash;that." He
pointed to the blood. "I'm guessing that it happened about half
an hour, or a little longer, ago."</p>

<p>"Half an hour?" The barrister looked puzzled. "I came into the
court not much over half an hour back. He wasn't there then."</p>

<p>Lorrimer looked inquisitive.</p>

<p>"From the west entrance." Dening laughed lightly and pointed
towards the opposite end of the court. "It was dark, even then,
but of course this place is always gloomy. I don't think I would
have missed him, though, if he had been here then."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Gray came up after you, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, he was at my chambers when I arrived. Mick had shown him
into the study. Now you've got Mr. Gray and myself right, what
about yourself?"</p>

<p>The detective grinned, clasping his hands before him
suggestively.</p>

<p>"I don't think that even you can pin that on me, sir. I came
here about ten minutes ago, on my way to your chambers. Saw
something lying under this standard and went to it. Made a bit of
an examination and then looked round for someone to get a message
on the telephone for me. Waited for what seemed like hours and
then Mick Rogan came down into the court. I sent him up to
you."</p>

<p>"You were coming to my chambers?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir. You've been good enough to talk over a few
matters, at times, with me." The police officer grinned. "I'll
say that more than once you've given me a new angle on a
case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you were bringing me one problem to-night, and found
another awaiting you?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it." Lorrimer scratched his head. "And I think
it's a real problem. It's not often a detective gets on the scene
so early. Many a time I've grumbled because I've thought
important clues were lost or trampled out because the police have
arrived late. This time I'm on the scene within a few minutes of
the murder; the first one to discover the corpse and&mdash;and
the devil of a clue can I see about."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll have better luck when we get the light. Ah,
here comes Gray."</p>

<p>The powerful light of the electric torch revealed little at
the first glance. The man was well-dressed, in a dark blue sac
suit. His boots were rather heavy and broad toed. A bowler hat
lay a couple of yards away, where it had apparently rolled when
the man had fallen.</p>

<p>Lorrimer took the torch, motioning to his companions to stand
well back. Directing the powerful light on the body, he
scrutinised it carefully, then stepped back some paces, sweeping
the light over the flagstones in the immediate vicinity of the
body, while slowly circling it and the light standard. He came to
a halt before the two men watching him and turned the light
suddenly on them.</p>

<p>"Not a sign of a clue about. There's dust on the flagstones,
plenty of it, but not a footprint showing. I'll guess he came to
the court alone, then someone accosted him. They stood talking
for a time, some distance apart, then the other man stabbed him
and bolted. But how did he get within stabbing distance without
leaving a footprint? Now, what has our friend here to tell
us?"</p>

<p>He stooped and rolled the corpse on its back, directing the
light on to it. A sharp exclamation from both men behind him made him look up sharply.</p>

<p>"Know him, sir?" Lorrimer addressed his question more
particularly to Dening, yet his keen bright eyes scanned Gray's
face searchingly.</p>

<p>"That's Edward Symonds, the private inquiry agent." The
barrister spoke positively.</p>

<p>"So you know him," the detective nodded. "And you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Symonds undertook an inquiry for me some few weeks ago." The
young man spoke frankly. "I went with him on the inquiry; took
him out into the country in my car. Yes, I recognise him. He's
Edward Symonds."</p>

<p>"And stabbed through the heart." The detective turned again to
the corpse. For a moment his hand hovered over the knife haft.
"No, I'd better leave that for the police surgeon. There may be
fingerprints, but I doubt it. Even amateur criminals know enough
nowadays to wear gloves."</p>

<p>"What was Symonds doing here at this time of night?" Dening
spoke almost under his breath.</p>

<p>"Ever come to see you, sir?" The detective looked up
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Sometimes. Symonds was one of the cleverest men in his
line."</p>

<p>"Thought so," Lorrimer smiled.</p>

<p>"Thought what?" Gray asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Symonds was a bit more than an acquaintance with me," the
Chief Inspector spoke musingly. "More than once he mentioned Mr.
Dening; had a great opinion of his abilities. Said he'd talked
over several of his cases with him. He was down at the Yard
yesterday after information. Seemed to be casting about for a
spot from which to start an inquiry. I suggested that a talk with
Mr. Dening might help. He said that he had to gather a few more
facts and then he'd probably follow my advice."</p>

<p>"What was he working on?" Dening asked curiously.</p>

<p>Lorrimer did not reply. He was searching the dead man's
clothing placing the articles he took from the pockets onto his
handkerchief, spread on the flagstones.</p>

<p>"Wonder if he was on the same line as myself." The detective
mused halt aloud. "Looks very much like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When you have done mumbling to yourself, Lorrimer, perhaps
you'll part with a little information. What was Symonds after
that you're interested in?"</p>

<p>"Just a guess." The Chief Inspector looked up with a broad
grin. "I came this evening to have a pow-wow with you. I'm
guessing that Symonds had the same intention. If this hadn't
happened and I'd come to your chambers I'd have found him
there."</p>

<p>For some seconds there was silence while the detective
completed his task. As he straightened, rolling up the contents
of Symonds' pockets in the handkerchief, Dening spoke again.</p>

<p>"You say that you think he's been dead a little more than half
an hour. I came home about that time back! Are you suggesting
that he followed me down the Strand?"</p>

<p>"Is that the way you came home, sir?" the detective nodded.
"That would fit. Symonds' offices are just off the Strand, in
Kingsway. Perhaps he was coming down from there to you. More than
probable, when he caught sight of you, he was too far behind to
catch you before you turned in at this court."</p>

<p>The barrister did not reply. Lorrimer had formed a plausible
theory, but it contained a weak spot. The detective did not know
of the shot that had been fired in Temple Lane. If Symonds had
heard the shot, or seen him fall, he would have run down to
him.</p>

<p>If Symonds had been following him. Taking the torch from the
Chief Inspector, Dening bent to examine the body. The man who he
believed to have fired the shot, the man who had run down from
the gardens towards the embankment, had worn a blue suit. For all
he could tell, in the dusk, the man might have worn a blue suit;
certainly he wore a bowler hat. He was of about the same build
and height as Edward Symonds.</p>

<p>He laughed quietly. Why should Edward Symonds wish to shoot
him? The idea was absurd. They had always been on friendly terms.
Symonds had assisted him in many inquiries; he had always been
willing to listen to the man's problems and help elucidate them.
Even while he had been walking home that night he had planned to
see the private inquiry agent the next day and secure his
services on the quest he had undertaken, the uncovering of the
man behind the name Matthew Ashcombe.</p>

<p>A sudden exclamation from Reuben Gray brought him from his
reverie. Lorrimer turned sharply.</p>

<p>"Look at that knife, Dening." The young man spoke in little
more than a whisper. "I've seen one like it before. I'll swear to
that. It's of foreign make, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the barrister pressed the button of the torch, directing
the light on the dead man's chest. A moment and he shut off the
light and turned to the detective.</p>

<p>"For a guess, Lorrimer, I'd look for a Southern Frenchman, or
a Spaniard. That knife's not peculiar, except in England. Two
years ago, I saw quite a lot of them, while I was on holidays on
the French-Spanish frontier. They're favourite tools&mdash;and
weapons&mdash;with the smugglers who infest the Pyrenees."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">THE entrance into the court of a group of
uniformed constables and detectives stopped the questions on
Lorrimer's lips. He went to meet his men and give the necessary
instructions for the disposal of the body and the quest of the
murderer. For a few moments he watched the doctor making his
examination of the corpse, then, after exchanging a few words
with him in an undertone, motioned to Dening and Gray.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, Mr. Dening, we'll go to your chambers.
There's nothing for me to do here, now; Sergeant Norris is taking
charge. I'd like to ask you a few questions&mdash;you and Mr.
Gray. About that knife." The last three words were added, almost
as an afterthought.</p>

<p>Dening nodded and led the way across the court and up to his
chambers. In the study, Lorrimer went directly to the windows
looking out on to the court. From there he could see the little
group about the dead man. For a moment he stood, pulling
thoughtfully at his underlip, then turned to the two men. Dening
pointed to the tray on the corner of the desk and the Chief
Inspector nodded thankfully. He felt that he needed a drink.</p>

<p>"So both you gentlemen knew Ted Symonds," he said, after he
had slaked his thirst. "And you didn't expect him to call on you
to-night, Mr. Dening?"</p>

<p>"No," the barrister answered without hesitation. "Though
to-morrow I should probably have looked him up." Both men looked
at him, questioningly. Dening was about to make a statement,
explaining his intentions, when he thought he saw a warning in
the detective's eyes.</p>

<p>"Symonds did quite a lot of work for me, one way and another."
He branched on away from what he had intended saying. "He had a
large and very efficient staff; that's the reason I gave him my
detail work." He laughed at the look of surprise on Reuben Gray's
face. "Perhaps I'd better explain, mainly for Mr. Gray's benefit,
that while I am known in legal circles as an investigator&mdash;a
solver of problems&mdash;I really only take the facts that others
assemble and form them into a connected story that will bear the
test of legal trial."</p>

<p>Lorrimer nodded. Dening, in the legal world, occupied the
position he, at the Yard, filled. No man could possibly delve
into all the byways and false trails of an investigation. That
was work for the rank and file. The expert was the man who could
take a multitude of varying factors and co-ordinate them into a
coherent and puncture-proof story.</p>

<p>"Then, at the moment, you were not interested in any inquiry
in which Symonds had a part?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not to Symonds' knowledge. If he had come here to-night, as
you suggest, he was coming on his own business."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector nodded; he turned to the younger man.</p>

<p>"And you, Mr. Gray?"</p>

<p>"I think I told you, Mr. Lorrimer; Symonds was recently
employed by me on an inquiry." The young man spoke slowly. "The
matter was completed and Mr. Symonds received a cheque for his
fees and expenses." He paused a moment and then added, "The
business I entrusted to Mr. Symonds was partly of a family
nature. I should prefer not to state it, unless it is absolutely
essential. I don't think it is."</p>

<p>"You say the inquiry was closed and Symonds' account settled?"
Receiving Gray's nod of assent, the detective continued, "Then
there is no reason, within your knowledge, why Symonds should be
in Fern Court to-night?"</p>

<p>"Except the one you suggest yourself that he wished to consult
Mr. Dening."</p>

<p>"You thought you recognised the knife the murderer used."
Suddenly Lorrimer turned to the barrister. "You recognised the
make of knife, Mr. Dening? You said that it was of Spanish
manufacture?"</p>

<p>A few moments, and he lifted from the case a sufflator,
blowing a cloud of fine white powder over the dark knife handle.
Again he bent to examine it. A shake of his head and he turned
the knife over gingerly, dusting the powder on the newly exposed
surface of the handle.</p>

<p>As the knife turned Dening heard a little gasp. He looked up
quickly. Gray's face was ashen white. He was staring at the
weapon as if unable to believe his eyes. With an effort he
steadied and turned to a side table on which lay his hat and
stick.</p>

<p>"Want me any more, Mr. Lorrimer?" He spoke in his usual
careless drawl; yet Dening noticed that the lines about his mouth
were drawn and hard. "If not, I'll get going."</p>

<p>"Not to-night, Mr. Gray." The detective spoke without looking
up. "I can find you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At the Albany." Gray supplied the address. "Queer ending to
our chat, Dening."</p>

<p>A slight beckoning movement of his head and Dening followed
Gray to the door. It was not until the outer door of the chambers
was reached that the young man spoke again.</p>

<p>"Dening, that knife's bound up in what we were discussing this
afternoon." His voice was low and eager. "I couldn't say anything
before that policeman, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What exactly do you mean, Gray?"</p>

<p>"That knife! I'll swear I've seen it before, and very
recently."</p>

<p>"Be careful." Dening spoke lightly, yet every nerve was
tensed. "That knife is a very common pattern. Lorrimer said he
could find a dozen like it in London, alone."</p>

<p>"Not exactly like that one." Gray clutched the barrister's
arm, drawing him out on the landing. "Dening, I saw that knife
yesterday. No, I can't be mistaken. You saw it. Did you notice
that flaw on one of the edges; a strange double-nick about an
inch and a half from where the haft joins the blade. That's too
distinctive to make a mistake over. I tell you I saw that knife,
yesterday!"</p>

<p>"Where?" The young man's excitement had infected the
barrister. "Gray, you've got to be certain!"</p>

<p>"Certain! I wish I was mistaken." The young man laughed
bitterly. "I saw that knife on Anton Letoit's study table when I
was with him yesterday afternoon. Man, I sat with it in my hands,
playing with it while we talked." His voice ran high up the
register. "I don't care what that policeman says; my fingerprints
must be all over it&mdash;and he knows they're there!"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Dening returned to his study he found
Lorrimer again standing at the window, looking out at the
dimly-lit court. As he crossed the room to join the police
officer he glanced at the desk. The knife still lay on the
blood-stained handkerchief.</p>

<p>Lorrimer half turned at the sound-of the barrister's steps.
There was a puzzled frown on his face. He looked towards the
knife and nodded.</p>

<p>"Anything there?" Dening's eyes followed the man's glance.</p>

<p>"Not a thing. Of course we don't find fingerprints, nowadays.
The detective-story writers have put the general public wise to
that precaution, Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, turning again to the window.</p>

<p>"Good view of the court from here, Mr. Dening. See, from this
window to where poor Symonds lay is a clear, straight
line&mdash;and not so far. By the way, your man confirms what Mr.
Gray said, that he was only here about ten minutes before you got
home. You found him at this window?"</p>

<p>"Almost exactly where you are standing." Dening was puzzled.
The Chief Inspector was speaking inconsequently.</p>

<p>"Notice that knife?" Lorrimer went to the desk, picked up the
knife and returned to the window, handing the weapon to the
barrister. "Dangerous sort of weapon; and used to-night in a
dangerous way." He paused, then abruptly: "Mr. Gray wearing
gloves when you entered this room?"</p>

<p>The barrister hesitated to reply. Had Reuben Gray been
wearing, gloves when he had come, upon him in that room? He
remembered that while he had stood on the landing a few minutes before, Gray had taken gloves from his pocket. He had been
pulling them on when he walked down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Let that pass. I don't want you to answer unless you're quite
certain. But in the court I asked you if you had been followed
while on your way home&mdash;and you hesitated to answer. I am
asking you that question, again, Mr. Dening."</p>

<p>The barrister nodded. He had intended to tell Lorrimer of the
shots fired at him in Temple Lane, when they were alone. Yet he
would not mention the inquiry with which he had been entrusted
that afternoon. He did not believe that had anything to do with the shooting.</p>

<p>In a few words Dening repeated the account of his movements
that evening, now including the incidents in Temple Lane.
Lorrimer listened in silence.</p>

<p>"I thought there was something uncommon about it," he said
when the barrister concluded. "You told a straight story&mdash;up
to the time when speaking of entering the Temple. Then you
hesitated and commenced to pick your words carefully. So you
had the idea that the man who shot at you was Symonds?"</p>

<p>"That idea came to my mind when we were down in the
court&mdash;he was dressed very like the man I saw running down
the lane; but the idea's absurd. There is no reason why Symonds
should want to shoot me."</p>

<p>Yet even as he spoke some instinct warned Dening that he was
not reasoning correctly. He was not taking into account the
statement made by Sir John McNiven that afternoon. The man had
stated that they had engaged Symonds to track down Matthew
Ashcombe. But that had been before Ashcombe had attempted
blackmail!</p>

<p>The men in the Altona Company's boardroom had stated that they
had tried to trace Ashcombe out of curiosity after the man had
successfully accomplished certain work for them. Had that
statement been true? Had not the first payments to Ashcombe been
blackmail? The possibilities to theorise were endless. He was
certain that only a fraction of the truth had been told him that
afternoon.</p>

<p>Matthew Ashcombe had undertaken certain work for that group of
men. Was the Matthew Ashcombe who had undertaken the work the
Matthew Ashcombe who had attempted blackmail in a large manner?
He had to consider that possibility. He had to remember that
Symonds had been engaged to trace and expose Matthew Ashcombe.
The registered mail trick was ingenious. Had Symonds solved that?
Had temptation come to him when he had discovered how the trick
had been worked? Had he duplicated the trick for his own
benefit?</p>

<p>Had Symonds, potential blackmailer of the seven men,
discovered that he, Dening, had been commissioned to uncover the
blackmailer? Had he, the blackmailer, tried to shoot him in
Temple Lane&mdash;the one sure way to silence the man whose
investigations he feared? The theory was probable.</p>

<p>Yet he had known Edward Symonds well; he had had many dealings
with him. He believed he had penetrated the man's character. He
believed him honest&mdash;he had discovered no signs of criminal
tendencies in him.</p>

<p>"No!" Dening turned to the Chief Inspector suddenly. "I was
mistaken. I do not think Edward Symonds was the man who shot at
me."</p>

<p>"Yet you have not a glimmer of an idea who the man was?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest idea."</p>

<p>"We've got Gray to consider," Lorrimer mused. "He knows
something about that knife; I saw that in his face while he
looking at it. Hold a magnifying glass against a dark background,
and it makes a fair mirror. Now, just what does he know? But
we're getting ahead of things! Let's go back to Symonds."</p>

<p>"When you first told me your movements I though Symonds had
followed you down here from the Strand. But the shooting at you
in the lane alters that. If Symonds had been trailing you, he'd
have seen you stop and look around; he'd have seen you fall, when
you started to run across the road. He'd have come down the lane
at the double. He didn't. So we've got to find another
theory."</p>

<p>Dening looked at the detective inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Symonds might have come down here after Gray." Lorrimer spoke
thoughtfully. "He may even have come here with Gray; that's
probable. Anyway Gray comes up here and Symonds waits for him. He
doesn't take any particular care to conceal himself. Perhaps he
thought you were at home and that Gray was engaged with you.
Then, suddenly, you turn into the court. Symonds has just time to
dodge into the shadows. You pass into this house and Symonds
comes out into the open. He stands under the light standard,
looking up at this window." The detective paused. "That's
probable. Right under the light is one of the best places to
watch from. The shadows from a light above strangely distort.
It's almost impossible to recognise anyone standing under a light
that way, especially if viewing that person from a height."</p>

<p>"What do you suggest Symonds was trailing Gray for?" asked
Dening.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can find a better answer to that question than I
can," Lorrimer laughed slightly. "We'll take the stage as set.
Symonds is in the court, watching these windows. Gray is up here,
watching Symonds." Again the Chief Inspector paused. For quite a
time he was silent.</p>

<p>"Gray knew that knife; perhaps he had it with him when he came
here." The detective hesitated. "There's quite a number of people
who are expert at knife throwing&mdash;people we don't suspect of
that art. For one, I can throw a knife with considerable
accuracy. For all I know you can throw a knife as well as I
can."</p>

<p>Dening shook his head, smiling.</p>

<p>"Anyway, Symonds came out of his concealment when you entered
the house. No doubt Gray saw you enter the court. A sudden rush
of anger at Symonds came over him. He saw an opportunity and took
it, knowing that within a couple of minutes you would be in the
room and create for him a fine alibi. He slid the window open,
threw the knife and then lowered the sash, tearing off his
glove." Again the Chief Inspector paused. "Gray took his gloves
out of his pocket and put them on when he went out of the door,
didn't he?"</p>

<p>Involuntarily Dening nodded. The Chief Inspector had reasoned
truly.</p>

<p>"There's one flaw in your argument, Lorrimer," he said after a
pause. "Gray was up here and Symonds was in the court. That knife
was plunged right up to the hilt in Symonds' breast. The distance
was too far. A knife thrown that distance would only wound."</p>

<p>"Wrong again, Mr. Dening. You're forgetting the fall from this
window to the court. Why, the acceleration of the fall, when the
knife was thrown would more than compensate for the loss of
muscular power. No, Mr. Dening, the case looks fairly complete
against that young man. All I've got to do now is to establish a
motive."</p>

<p>For some time the detective paced the room, deep in thought.
At length his face cleared and he turned to the barrister.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray said that he had recently engaged Symonds on an
inquiry. Do you know what the inquiry was about?"</p>

<p>Dening hesitated. For the time he had no intention of telling
Lorrimer of the commission he had accepted from Sir John McNiven
and his associates. Later, perhaps, he would have had to take him
into his confidence, but for the moment he must keep his own
counsel. Still, he could answer the question.</p>

<p>"Reuben Gray told me that he had engaged Symonds to trace a
certain Matthew Ashcombe. I believe Symonds failed&mdash;" He
paused, staring at the Chief Inspector in amazement. "What do you
know of Matthew Ashcombe, Lorrimer?"</p>

<p>"Damned little." The dark eyes of the police officer flashed.
"But, I'm thinking that Sergeant Chambers would like to have a
talk with that man." He waited a moment, then continued: "We
raided the Blue Heaven night club a few evenings ago. Chambers
was in charge of the raiding party. Put quite a little flutter up
among the angels. Most of them stampeded. In searching the place
Chambers found, in one of the curtained recesses, a letter. It
was on the table and evidently the writer had left it there when
he bolted, before the police charge.</p>

<p>"That letter wasn't addressed to any particular person. Just
started 'Dear Sir.' Rather a strange letter. It was signed
'Matthew Ashcombe,' and across it lay a partially addressed
envelope, addressed 'R. G&mdash;&mdash;' A blot followed where
the pen had been hastily dropped on it."</p>

<p>"Lorrimer, where is that letter?" Dening gasped eagerly.</p>

<p>"Interested? Well, it's down at the Yard. If you call,
Chambers or I will give you a look at it. Not feeling tired?"</p>

<p>"How can anyone feel tired when you're on the go?" the
barrister laughed. "What's on your mind now?"</p>

<p>"I like to keep going while the going's good." The Chief
Inspector grinned. "What about a little walk up the
Strand&mdash;to Kingsway? Symonds' offices are in Royston House.
Perhaps there we may find the cause of his death?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">MIDNIGHT was chiming from many clocks when
Lorrimer and Dening went up to the Strand from Fern Court.</p>

<p>The barrister was worried and puzzled. He had a certain liking
for Reuben Gray, although he was but a mere acquaintance. He had
disliked meeting the young man with those other men in the
boardroom of the Altona Trading Company the previous afternoon;
men whom he suspected of being active on the very shady fringe of
commercial morality.</p>

<p>Now Chief Inspector Lorrimer had made out a very strong case
against Gray for the murder of Edward Symonds, the well-known
private inquiry agent. The case was strong, yet there were still
many links missing. Much depended on what they would find at
the offices they were about to visit. The barrister knew that if
their investigations disclosed even a shadowy motive for the
murder the detective would take immediate steps and Gray would be
arrested.</p>

<p>Lorrimer's piecing together of the events of the evening had
been logical. Dening could not get away from the fact that Gray
might have murdered the private inquiry agent. Every step that
the detective had outlined was possible; more, entirely probable.
The one fact that would close the case was a strong motive for
the deed.</p>

<p>Dening did not believe that Gray had killed the man. He still
possessed the valuable piece of evidence the young man had
revealed to him on the doorstep of his chambers. Gray had stated
that Letoit had owned the knife with which Symonds had been
stabbed. Yet, he had admitted that the previous afternoon he had
handled that knife in Letoit's* study. He had feared, greatly,
that his fingerprints were still on it. In his talk with the
detective the barrister had suppressed that piece of evidence.
Would it weaken, or strengthen, the case against Gray? Might not
Lorrimer claim that Gray had brought the knife from Letoit's
house?</p>

<p>[Note: The book states "Lorrimer's study" but other references
in the book put the knife in Letoit's study.]

<p>He was certain that in some way the happenings at Altona
House, the shooting at him in Temple Lane and the stabbing of
Edward Symonds were closely linked. Into the problem, complex as
it was, came Matthew Ashcombe's attempted blackmail of the seven
men, and the strange letter the police had found at the Blue
Heaven night-club. What did that letter contain? Lorrimer
certainly thought it valuable.</p>

<p>A hundred yards along Kingsway and Lorrimer entered a tall
building. At the head of a couple of shallow steps, ornamental
ironwork-gates barred their entry. Lorrimer pressed a bell-knob
and after a long interval an attendant came to them. A few words
from the Chief Inspector and the gates were unbarred. The man led
to one of the elevators and escorted them to the eighth floor.
There the detective dismissed him, waiting until the lift had
descended to the ground floor before moving along the
corridor.</p>

<p>The long corridors, branching from the lift-landing, were but
dimly lit by a few globes of low pressure. Lorrimer turned to the
left and at the opening to a branch corridor suddenly stopped.
Dening made to lead on but the detective caught his arm, pointing
down the corridor. Now the barrister saw that at the end of the
corridor three offices were brightly lit.</p>

<p>Dening wondered. The lights were in the rooms he knew were
occupied by the Symonds Inquiry Agency. Who was in those offices?
He almost held his breath as he followed silently in the Chief
Inspector's steps. Had Gray, on leaving his chambers, come to
Symonds' offices intent on destroying some pieces of evidence
that would incriminate him? If he was there, then that would be
almost an admission of his guilt.</p>

<p>The Symonds Inquiry Agency occupied the last three rooms on
the right hand of the corridor. Lorrimer passed the first two
doors and stopped at the third. On the glass of the door was
inscribed the name of the firm and underneath the two words
"General Offices." He tried the lock, cautiously. The lock-bolt
was shot. Taking from his pocket the handkerchief of articles he
had taken from Symonds' clothing, the Chief Inspector sorted out
a bunch of keys. Taking every precaution against rattling metal
on metal, he slipped the key in the lock and turned it. Under
gentle pressure, the door gave. Thrusting it quickly open, the
detective advanced into the room.</p>

<p>There was no one in the General Offices. Lorrimer passed into
the other two rooms. There was no person in the offices, yet in
all three rooms the lights blazed. For a moment he stood, gazing
around perplexedly, then turned and looked at Dening
inquiringly.</p>

<p>The barrister shook his head, then turned to examine the room
in which they stood. The desk was in disorder, papers littered
over it. The chair was thrust back from the desk, as if the
occupant had risen suddenly, intending to soon resume work. He
went to the door of the office and surveyed the next room. That
was in perfect order, so, also, was the general
office&mdash;except that one of the filing cabinet-drawers was
half open. He returned to Symonds' office, crossing immediately
to the desk and bending over the papers.</p>

<p>A moment and he drew the chair to the desk and sat down. On
the blotting pad were three single sheets of paper. Propped
against the inkwells, above the blotting-pad, was an open file.
To the right were two other files, both shut. A moment's
hesitation and the barrister turned to the three single sheets of
paper. A pencilled message on the top one caught his eyes.</p>

<p>It was written on a telephone message form, evidently taken by
the switch-attendant while Symonds had been absent from his
office. The wording was brief; a mere statement that Mr. Richard
Dening had been called to the Altona Trading Company's offices to
consult with Sir John McNiven. He glanced at the date and time at the foot of the form. The message had been telephoned within a
few minutes of the hour at which he had reached Altona House!</p>

<p>Who had sent that message? Why had it been sent? What interest
had Edward Symonds and his agency in his movements? Again he read
the message. The sender had not given a name. On the line where
the sender's name should have been written was a pencil dash. Had
the switch-attendant forgotten to include the name or had the
person who telephoned the message refused to give a name?</p>

<p>Shrugging slightly, Dening placed the sheet of paper on one
side. The next document was a closely-written foolscap sheet of
paper. The first few lines informed Dening that it was an
operative's report. He scanned down the lines quickly. Symonds
was still conducting inquiries into the Matthew Ashcombe
case&mdash;although Sir John McNiven and Reuben Gray had assured
him that they had given instructions for inquiries to be stopped.
This report dealt with an operative's endeavours to trace a
Matthew Ashcombe who lived in the vicinity of Gray's or who had
lived there within recent years.</p>

<p>The third paper was a single sheet of notepaper&mdash;a
letter. The letter contained only a few lines. The signature was
"Aaron Parota" and the letter was addressed to Anton Letoit. In
substance, the letter asked for a loan of sixty thousand pounds
to be made available immediately&mdash;"on security you are aware
is amply sufficient."</p>

<p>For a moment Dening sat back, frowning thoughtfully. These
documents were, in some way, connected. It was impossible to
believe that Symonds had gathered them by chance on his blotting
pad. But, what did they mean? Two of them indicated that Symonds
had not dropped the Ashcombe investigation. The third was
connected with the seven men he had met in the boardroom at,
Altona house yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>He glanced at the open file above the blotting pad, and
stiffened. That folio related to Mrs. Ashford-Lynne and the loss
of her necklace at Brexham Court. He remembered the case
well.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford-Lynne was the widow of Captain Archie Poly Lynne,
the younger son of an impoverished titled family. When he died
he, to the surprise, of his friends, left few debts and only a
modest life insurance for the benefit of his widow. Yet, for
three years she had hung on the fringe of society, going
everywhere, tolerated, if not wholly welcomed.</p>

<p>Her one valuable possession was a pearl necklace. Through many
adversities she clung to it, claiming that the necklace was a
heirloom&mdash;whether from her husband's family or her own was
never clearly stated. The only valuable piece of jewellery she
possessed, it was carried round to the various country houses at
which she stayed. Time and again she was warned that it would be
stolen, but she always laughed, stating that she would make the
thief pay dearly for his crime.</p>

<p>The necklace disappeared while she was on a visit to Brexham
Court. Mrs. Ashford-Lynne had been at the Court a week before the
theft took place; during that time she had attracted a lot of
comment through a rather frenzied flirtation with Morris
Pedlington, a young, rising politician. Pedlington had been
discovered in Mrs. Ashford-Lynne's bedroom early one morning,
concealed behind the curtain. Mrs. Ashford-Lynne had raised the
alarm that there was a burglar in her room. She expressed the
utmost astonishment when the burglar proved to be Pedlington.
Many of those who had been aroused from their early morning
slumbers by her screams smiled, although General Brexham frowned
disapprovingly, and invited Pedlington to an interview in his
library.</p>

<p>What the General had intended to say to Pedlington never
became known. He had hardly spoken the first sentences when the
woman burst into the room with the news that her necklace had
been stolen. Furious with rage at her loss, she had denounced
Pedlington as the thief.</p>

<p>In some manner the Brexhams had managed to hush up the
incipient scandal. Pedlington had left the Court within an hour,
and the following day Mrs. Ashford-Lynne returned to London. A
week later she wrote Pedlington, stating that she expected him to
recompense her for the loss of her necklace&mdash;at her own
valuation.</p>

<p>Pedlington had come to Dening, an old school-friend. He
acknowledged that he had been indiscreet, but claimed that Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne had sent a note to him that morning, asking him to
come immediately to her room. He had complied with her request,
to find the room empty. While he had debated what to do, he had
heard the woman's screams in the corridor, and hid. He stated
that he had left Mrs. Ashford-Lynne's note on his dressing-table,
but when he sent for it, to show Colonel Brexham, it had
disappeared.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford-Lynne had instructed Edward Symonds to obtain
evidence to support a charge against Pedlington. A strange chance
had put Dening, who sincerely doubted the lady's integrity, on
the right track. During a very uncomfortable interview with the
lady, he had convinced her that the pearl necklace had never been
stolen; that at that moment the very fine duplicate she had
exhibited at Brexham Court was in her possession, and that the
original was at her disposal when she repaid the advance for
which it was held as security.</p>

<p>"Anything interesting?" A heavy hand fell on Dening's
shoulder. He looked up at the smiling face of the Chief
Inspector.</p>

<p>"In some ways, yes," the barrister spoke gravely. "Not
informative regarding Symonds' death, but interesting regarding
the work he was engaged on immediately prior to his murder."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Symonds was in this room up to a few minutes before his
death," Dening spoke positively. "And strangely enough he was
probing into cases he had long since completed."</p>

<p>"How's that?" Lorrimer showed interest.</p>

<p>"Remember the Ashford-Lynne missing necklace affair at Brexham
Court?"</p>

<p>"That!" The detective stared. "Pedlington had a narrow shave
of standing in the dock, I believe. The matter was compromised in
some way, I understand."</p>

<p>"In danger of having to raise an almost impossible sum of
money," corrected the barrister. "Mrs. Ashford-Lynne would have
come to terms&mdash;at the end. Any terms. You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So, it was that?" Lorrimer shrugged "Blackmail?"</p>

<p>Dening nodded. "Anything interesting in the offices?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps this may interest you." The barrister drew forward
the operative's report on the inquiries in the Grays district.
"Symonds, during his last hours, appears to have been interested
in Matthew Ashcombe."</p>

<p>"How does that connect?"</p>

<p>Very carefully Dening went over the happenings of the past
afternoon; his interview with Sir John McNiven and the shooting
at him in Temple Lane.</p>

<p>"Why the devil didn't you tell me that before?" the Chief
Inspector spoke angrily. "Why, this makes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Does it?" the barrister laughed. "To my mind it fogs the
matter still more completely. If you want to know why I didn't
tell you this before&mdash;well, Gray was with us and you'd got a
hunch he was responsible for Symonds' death."</p>

<p>"But this doesn't clear him," objected the police officer.</p>

<p>"Not entirely. But it brings a lot of other people into the
spotlight, people who might possibly be interested in Symonds'
death."</p>

<p>Lorrimer nodded thoughtfully. He stared around the office, a
puzzled frown on his face.</p>

<p>"I'm hanged if this case has a starting point at all!" he
exclaimed, at length. "There's poor Symonds dead, and not a thing
to show why he was in Fern Court to-night."</p>

<p>Dening returned to a further examination of the Margaret
Ashford-Lynne file. For a time the Chief Inspector wandered idly
about the offices. At length he returned to the private office
and stood before the desk, opposite the barrister.</p>

<p>"What's that door?" he exclaimed suddenly. He pointed to a
door behind Dening's chair. "Does that room belong to this suite
of offices? If not, why the glass panel in the door?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. Don't think so." The barrister pushed his chair
to one side and considered the darkened surface of the door
thoughtfully. "If I remember rightly, the only lit rooms in the
corridor were these three."</p>

<p>Lorrimer went to the door and tried the handle. The door was
locked. He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and produced a
queerly-shaped piece of steel.</p>

<p>"Useful to have acquaintances in the house-breaking trade," he
grinned. "They come in handy sometimes. 'Locky' Smith left this
one with me, when he was going for an extended visit into the
country&mdash;and was polite enough to show me how to use it. I
didn't put it in the museum; it appeared to be too handy to lie
idle&mdash;Ah, that's it!"</p>

<p>While he was speaking he manipulated the little instrument in
the lock. A click, and the door swung open under gentle pressure,
Lorrimer ran his hand up the lintel, within the room. A lamp on
the desk came to life.</p>

<p>The two men found themselves looking into another office; an
office furnished in a similar manner to the one behind them. A
chair prevented the door being opened more than a few inches.
Reaching into the room the Chief Inspector swung the chair aside
and walked in, closely followed by Dening.</p>

<p>"Whose office is this, I wonder?" For a moment he stood,
scanning the room, then his eyes went to the desk. "Jove! Look
here, Mr. Dening&mdash;at that sheet of paper on the
blotting-pad. Remember Symonds' habit of drawing linked triangles
as he talked. There's quite a number of them there. I'll swear he
occupied this room also. Lord, how I've chaffed him about those
triangles. Told him he drew them unconsciously because he was
also messed up with those rotten divorce cases. The eternal
triangle, y'know."</p>

<p>Dening nodded absently; scanning the room eagerly. Suddenly he
gripped Lorrimer's arm, pointing to a lady's hand-bag, lying on
the corner of the desk.</p>

<p>"Some client's forgotten her bag." The Chief Inspector moved
to pick it up. He stopped with an ejaculation of horror and
surprise. "Here, Mr. Dening, look."</p>

<p>He led round the desk, Dening following closely. While from
the door the room appeared to be in good order, on the other side
of the desk was chaos. A chair lay on its side, one leg broken. A
small table had been roughly forced into the knee hole of the
desk. On the carpet lay a young woman, face downwards, her left
arm extended, the hand resting in a pool of blood.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">WHAT had happened in that room? For a full
minute the two men stood looking down on the woman, then Lorrimer
sprang forward, kneeling by her side.</p>

<p>Was she dead? Very gently he slipped his hand under her,
feeling for her heart-beats. For a moment his fingers registered
no movement then, as he accidentally pressed against her, she
moved slightly, a small moan escaping her lips.</p>

<p>Immediately Dening went to the detective's side. He drew her
hand from the blood, wiping it clean with his handkerchief. Very
gently the men lifted her and carried her into Symonds' private
office, laying her on the couch.</p>

<p>"What does it all mean?" the barrister questioned in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Lorrimer did not answer. He was flicking water on the girl's
face. Already she was showing signs of returning
consciousness.</p>

<p>"She'll do now. Let her alone for a few minutes." The Chief
Inspector spoke at length. "We don't want her to know anything
about that chamber of horrors until she has fully recovered."</p>

<p>The barrister nodded. For a moment he hesitated, then took
from the desk the bunch of keys Lorrimer had taken from Symonds'
pocket He found the key that locked the door and replaced the
keys on the desk. He turned and looked at the girl on the
couch.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know." The police officer's eyes never left the girl's
face. "Jove she got a whale of a blow! What with? A sandbag? I
wonder! No, not that!" He looked round at the barrister. "Haven't
a ghost of a notion who she is; have you?"</p>

<p>Dening shook his head. Then he remembered the bag on the
corner of the desk in the other room. Taking the keys he unlocked
the door and brought out the bag, locking the door again. A
slight search of the bag and he turned to the police officer,
bewilderment showing on his face.</p>

<p>"But she's not Mrs. Ashford-Lynne," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Who?" The Chief Inspector was instantly alert.</p>

<p>Dening turned the card he had taken from the bag to face the
Chief Inspector. It bore the name: "Mrs. Ashford-Lynne."</p>

<p>The detective nodded, then turned to watch the girl again. A
moment and he went into the strange office. When he returned he
looked considerably less perplexed.</p>

<p>"Thought it wasn't a sandbag," he said. "Wrong place on the
head for a sandbag to land, unless&mdash; No, even if she heard
her assailant, it wouldn't have landed there unless he'd been
only about three feet high and left-handed. There aren't many
thugs of that sort about."</p>

<p>Dening was about to ask questions when the girl suddenly
opened her eyes, looking inquiringly about the room.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" she asked faintly. Her eyes met Dering's. "Who
are you?"</p>

<p>"Only a lawyer." The young man smiled down on the girl,
reassuringly. "You've had a nasty tumble and we brought you in
here. My companion? He laughed lightly as the girl's eyes passed
to the dark, saturnine face of the Chief Inspector. "Oh, he's
quite harmless. Only a police officer&mdash;Chief Inspector
William Lorrimer, of New Scotland Yard. You know the place I
mean; that ugly red building close to Westminster Bridge. Oh, I
know he's frowning, but that's not for you. He's just trying to
imagine how you could come such a tremendous cropper."</p>

<p>"But I was pushed." The girl spoke uncomprehendingly. "I was
just entering the room when someone pushed me&mdash;and&mdash;I
don't remember anything more."</p>

<p>Lorrimer nodded. "You've got it about right, miss. You struck
your head on the edge of the desk and went out. Do you know who
pushed you?"</p>

<p>"No." The girl put her hand, uncertainly, to her head. "I
remember turning the handle of the door and pushing it open.
There was no light in the room, although I could see the light in
the next room, through the glass door. I went to feel for the
switch when someone caught hold of me and pulled me violently
into the room. I tripped and and fell and&mdash;and&mdash;" She
made to try and sit up.</p>

<p>"I think you should lie still a little longer." Dening drew a
chair to the side of the couch, motioning to the Chief Inspector
to seat himself. "You see, even a blow from a stationary desk can
hurt."</p>

<p>"It does," The girl was holding her throbbing head. "Is&mdash;is it only a bruise?"</p>

<p>"Only a bruise, and not a very big one," Lorrimer spoke
reassuringly. "But it seems to have put you to sleep for quite a
while. Do you remember what time it was when you came here?"</p>

<p>"The clocks were chiming half-past nine when I came into the
building," she answered promptly.</p>

<p>"Awfully awkward this question and answer business," The
barrister spoke flippantly. He had to keep the girl's thoughts
away from the bloody scene in the next room. "Suppose I
introducer myself. I've already introduced Lorrimer and he
doesn't seem inclined to reciprocate. I'm Richard Dening, a
barrister, sometimes called Dick, especially by male
acquaintances I'm not intimate with, and who wish to borrow
money. You&mdash;" he hesitated expectantly.</p>

<p>"I am Ira Canning," the girl replied simply.</p>

<p>"Good. Now, Miss Canning, we're all acquainted. I think I
should warn you that Lorrimer is one of the most inquisitive men
I've ever known; always asking questions."</p>

<p>"You are trying to tell me that Mr. Lorrimer wants to question
me." The girl laughed lightly as she struggled up to seat herself
in one of the corners of the lounge. "Why&mdash;" She gazed about
her in bewilderment, "you've shifted all the furniture. The
desk&mdash;it stood over there."</p>

<p>"You've been in this room before?" The barrister spoke
quietly.</p>

<p>"No. Only when I came here to-night to see Mr. Symonds." She
hesitated. "I remember, the desk was there. I saw it for one
moment when the lights came on. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will be better if you start by telling us why you
came here," the barrister interrupted gently. "Did Mr. Symonds
send for you to come and see him to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The girl hesitated a moment. "I got his letter when I
arrived home to dinner, and it was very important for me. He said
that he had work for me and and&mdash;I'm out of a job. He wrote
that he wanted someone at once, that he would be at his
office until very late to-night. So I thought I would try and see
him to-night."</p>

<p>"Quite right." Dening expressed warm approval. "Always strike
while the iron's hot, they say. I don't know why but the person
who invented the wisecrack must have known something. You came to
the city from&mdash;" He paused suggestively.</p>

<p>"From Brixton. I live at Parkview Mansions."</p>

<p>"Mr. Symonds sent you a telegram, I suppose?" Lorrimer
interposed.</p>

<p>"No. He sent a letter by hand. I was out when it arrived, and
whoever brought it slipped it under my door."</p>

<p>"What work was Mr. Symonds offering you?" Dening disliked the
idea of this girl being mixed up with the sordid work of an
inquiry office.</p>

<p>"He said that he wanted a confidential secretary
stenographer." Again Ira hesitated. "I don't know why he wrote to
me, for it was quite a while since I saw him last and I didn't
know that he knew I was out of work."</p>

<p>"Who were you working for, when you met Edward Symonds?" The
Chief Inspector spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ashford-Lynne. I was her social secretary."</p>

<p>In spite of his control, Dening gave a little gasp of
surprise. Why was this woman intruding so greatly into the
happenings of the past few hours? It was more than a year since
he had last thought of the woman and during that time her name
had hardly entered his memory.</p>

<p>"So you were Mrs. Ashford-Lynne's social secretary?" The
barrister repeated musingly.</p>

<p>"She discharged me." The girl spoke quietly, her lips curling
scornfully. "She said that she could no longer afford to keep a
social secretary."</p>

<p>"Let's get back to to-night," Lorrimer interjected. "You told
us, Miss Canning, that Mr. Symonds sent for you that you came
here immediately, arriving at this building about nine-thirty.
You came in here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No." The girl spoke positively. "I did not come into this
office. It was an office very similar to this, but&mdash;but it
was all the other way round&mdash;" She turned to Dening. "Do you
understand what I mean?"</p>

<p>Before he answered, the barrister glanced at Lorrimer, who
nodded.</p>

<p>"No, it was not this office." Dening replied slowly, trying to
make his voice as reassuring as possible. "We brought you in here
when we found you insensible." He paused, then continued "We did
not find you in Mr. Symonds' office, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember." The girl was recovering quickly. "I was in
the office without a name on the door. But that is one of Mr.
Symonds' offices. In his letter he told me that if the general
office door was shut and locked to go in at the door of an office
three doors before it; cross to a door between that room and the
next and he would let me into his office. He called the room I
would enter his 'private clients' room."</p>

<p>Lorrimer nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"What happened next?" he asked.</p>

<p>"When I came up to the door I saw that Mr. Symonds' offices
were lit. I went to the general office and found the door
fastened. Then I went to the door of the room three doors away.
The room was in darkness, but the door was on the latch. I opened
the door and felt for the light switch. Just as I pressed it
someone caught hold of me and flung me into the room. Something
hit me on the head and I became unconscious."</p>

<p>"You saw nothing unusual in the room?" Dening asked
quickly.</p>

<p>"No, why?" Ira paused, looking at him questioningly. "Was
there anything unusual in the room?"</p>

<p>"Have you the letter from Mr. Symonds, the letter asking you
to call to-night?" Lorrimer evaded the girl's questions.</p>

<p>"It is in my bag." She glanced at the bag on the desk.</p>

<p>Without a word Lorrimer handed, her the bag. She opened it,
and looked up startled.</p>

<p>"This is not my bag." Carefully she scanned the bag and its
contents. "It is not my bag, but it is very much like it."</p>

<p>"There are cards in that bag belonging to Mrs. Ashford-Lynne."
Dening's voice was studiously careless.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ashford-Lynne." The girl stared then looked down at the
bag again. "Yes, this is her bag. She liked mine so much that she
bought one as like it as possible. Why&mdash;" She hesitated,
staring from one to the other of the men. "Was&mdash;was it Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne who threw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From the present evidence it appears so." Dening's laughter
detracted from the seriousness of his words. "But, you must
remember that when one is startled, even a little push can do
quite an amount of harm. Mrs. Ashford-Lynne might have been in
that room&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the dark?" interjected the girl.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and hearing you enter, tried to get away unobserved."
The barrister ignored the girl's interjection.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but where is my bag?" The girl was startled.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it is not in the next room." Lorrimer spoke
uneasily. They had to prevent the girl entering the next room.
Following on the severe blow on the head the shock of the blood
and disorder might cause her serious trouble.</p>

<p>"I think we had better get Miss Canning home as soon as
possible," Dening interposed. He turned to the girl. "If you will
allow me, I will telephone for my car, and take you home. At this
hour of the night&mdash;"</p>

<p>Involuntarily the girl glanced down at her wrist watch; to
give a little cry of horror.</p>

<p>"Why, did I cut myself when I fell?" She held up her wrist for
the men's inspection. The little gold watch and its band were
covered with half-dried blood.</p>

<p>"So sorry, Miss Canning." The barrister spoke quickly.
"Lorrimer, you cut your hand just before we found Miss Canning.
You covered her wrist with blood when you helped me carry her in
here."</p>

<p>For a moment his tall form hid the detective from the girl's
eyes, as he moved to the desk and the telephone. When the Chief
Inspector again came in the girl's view, he had his pocket
handkerchief strapped roughly round his hand.</p>

<p>Dening called his chambers and instructed Mick Regan to bring
his car to Royston House. Then, for the next ten minutes he set
his keen wits to entertain the girl and prevent her asking
awkward questions, or thinking of her experiences in the other
room of that suite of offices. Laughing gaily, the three went
down to the street. A few seconds and the car stopped at the
curb.</p>

<p>The girl was very silent during the short drive to the
southern suburb. Just before he parted from her, at the door of
Parkview Mansions, Dening asked the question that had been in his
mind for some time.</p>

<p>"Miss Canning, why did you disbelieve Mrs. Ashford-Lynne when
she told you that she was too financially embarrassed to retain
longer your services as social secretary?"</p>

<p>For a moment the girl looked at him curiously, then
laughed.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Dening." She hesitated, then laughed again. "I
don't suppose I am betraying secrets by telling you. Only the day
before Mrs. Ashford-Lynne made that statement she banked a very
large cheque. I saw the cheque, but she didn't know I did."</p>

<p>"A very large cheque," Dening mused. "Did you see the amount
and the signature of the drawer of the cheque, Miss Canning?"</p>

<p>Then at the girl's quick glance of astonishment he added, "I
assure you I am not asking the question out of mere
curiosity."</p>

<p>For a moment the girl hesitated; then turned to him
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I don't think you are asking me questions out of idle
curiosity, Mr. Dening. The cheque was drawn by Mr. Anton Letoit
and the amount was five thousand pounds."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">IT seemed to Richard Dening that he had hardly
fallen asleep before Mick Regan was beside his bed, awakening him
with the information that Chief Inspector Lorrimer was in the
study, awaiting him. He rolled over and looked at the bed-table
clock. It was barely eight o'clock.</p>

<p>Grumbling at the uneasy consciences possessed by police
officers, that did not permit them to rest for a level eight
hours per night, Dening sought the bathroom, calling to Mick to
serve breakfast and to inform the detective that he would be with
him in ten minutes. A few minutes beyond that time he entered the
sitting room, to find Lorrimer seated in a deep chair, immersed
in the newspapers.</p>

<p>"Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Dening." The police officer looked
up with a grin. "Good for you, you're not at the Yard. There you
learn to take your sleep as you can get it."</p>

<p>"What's your trouble?" The barrister nodded towards the
sideboard. "You look as if sleep and yourself were strangers.
Suppose food has been in the same category. Help yourself man. If
you think I'm going to discuss murders before I'm fed, you're badly mistaken."</p>

<p>"I thought we might discuss a murder while we fed." Lorrimer
took a chair at the table. "Have a nice drive to Brixton last
night?"</p>

<p>"So-so." The barrister, attacked his breakfast determinedly.
"Got home somewhere about three o'clock. By the time I got to bed
and asleep Mick was knocking at the door, stating that you were
in the study."</p>

<p>"So she does live at Brixton?" Lorrimer looked up quickly.
"That was one of the things I came here to ascertain. I phoned
the Brixton station this morning to keep an eye on Miss Ira
Canning. Just a chance. She might have given me a false name and
address and changed your directions after you left Kingsway."</p>

<p>The barrister looked up in surprise. "You're damned suspicious
at the Yard," he grinned. "What's the matter with Miss Ira
Canning? Appears to me to be a very nice girl."</p>

<p>"That's what I want to know. So she told you her full name? By
the way, she took Mrs. Ashford-Lynne's handbag home with her last
night."</p>

<p>"No, she didn't." The barrister rose from the table and went
into his study, returning in a few minutes with the article. "I
took it from Symonds' offices, inadvertently. Escorting the lady
home, one naturally assumes that she has a bag. I picked this one
up from the desk and stuffed it in my pocket. When I offered it
to her at her door, she refused it, reminding me that she had
lost her bag."</p>

<p>"Humph."</p>

<p>For some time the detective devoted his attention to his
plate. "Rather strange, those handbags."</p>

<p>"Handbags?" Dening looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>"Handbags, yes," Lorrimer grinned. "You said just now that we
men usually assume that a lady has a handbag. We found one last
night. That belonged to Mrs. Ashford-Lynne. We have to presume
that Miss Canning brought one with her to Symonds'
offices&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She said she did."</p>

<p>"Yet, when we discovered her we didn't find her bag&mdash;we
found Mrs. Ashford-Lynne's."</p>

<p>For a moment the barrister stared. He had missed the
significance that was attached to the handbags.</p>

<p>"Looks as if we'll have to presume that both Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne and Miss Canning went to Symonds' offices last
night," the barrister spoke. "Can we reconstruct anything from
that?"</p>

<p>"I think we may take it that Mrs. Ashford-Lynne called on
Symonds first. The offices were locked&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except the door of the darkened room," reminded Dening.</p>

<p>"Ur-r." Lorrimer looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"Miss Canning stated that she turned the handle of the door
and opened it."</p>

<p>"That's so," the detective nodded. "But, possibly the door of
that room was open when Mrs. Ashford-Lynne went there. We don't
know whether Symonds had made an appointment with her or not.
Anyway, we have to assume that she arrived first. Possibly she
heard the 'tap-tap' of the girl's heels as she walked down the
corridor and switched out the lights&mdash;didn't want to be
found there. She waited by the door, and when the girl entered
caught her by the arm, swung her across the room and darted out
into the corridor. Miss Canning falls against the desk and is
stunned, allowing Mrs. Ashford-Lynne to make a safe getaway. I
think we may safely assume that is what really took place."</p>

<p>"Possibly," Dening agreed, "but in your reconstruction you've
left Symonds out of your reckoning. Was he there to meet Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne?"</p>

<p>"She might have obtained a key in some manner and gone there
on her own account," hazarded the detective.</p>

<p>"You've forgotten the lights through the offices."</p>

<p>Lorrimer nodded.</p>

<p>"Did you look at the files on the desk?" the barrister asked
after a pause. "I did. The last file Edward Symonds was working
on related to the old Ashford-Lynne necklace. I'm suggesting that
Mrs. Ashford-Lynne had an appointment with Symonds; possibly made
after he had sent that letter to the girl. I believe that woman
was with Symonds for some considerable time before the girl
arrived. Something occurred to cause Symonds to leave his
offices. There your theory comes in, Lorrimer. Symonds may have
left Mrs. Ashford-Lynne in his offices, to await his return. Why,
I don't profess even to guess. At the same time, Symonds and I
did a lot of work together. He may have come down to the Temple
to consult me on some matter. Don't forget, I was mixed up in
that necklace case. Fit your reconstruction to that and we may
have a good guess at the truth."</p>

<p>"Plausible," the detective nodded. "But you've omitted to
account for the broken furniture and the blood. There was blood
on the carpet; you can't get away from that. Quite a large
quantity, and there wasn't a corpse. Any explanations?"</p>

<p>Dening made a gesture of despair. Yet an explanation lingered
in his mind. Symonds might have been killed in his offices and
his body taken to the Temple. If that was true, then what part
did the woman bear in the tragedy? Obviously, while she could
have murdered the man she must have had an accomplice to convey
the body to the Temple.</p>

<p>How far had they gone towards an explanation of the mystery?
Ignoring what tragedy had occurred in the fourth office, they had
a fair explanation of the movements of the actors in the
happenings immediately preceding the discovery of Symonds' dead
body. But, they had not explained the blood, the evidences of a
terrific struggle in that room. Unless they could fit that into
their reconstruction, it was useless.</p>

<p>"Suppose you had a talk with that girl on the way to Brixton?"
Lorrimer spoke after some minutes. "Did she say anything, that
might help to an explanation?"</p>

<p>"No." Then Dening remembered the girl's last remark.
"Yes."</p>

<p>Tersely he recounted again the events of the past twenty-four
hours for the Chief Inspector's benefit, now speaking fully of
his interview with the seven men in the offices of the Altona
Trading Company. Faced with the death of the private inquiry
agent, he felt that he could no longer conceal the details of
that interview. It appeared inexplicably entangled with the
murder.</p>

<p>When he came to the account of his short conversation with
Reuben Gray just outside his chamber's door, the detective
betrayed great interest. His lips pursed in a soundless whistle
when Dening spoke of Gray toying with the fatal knife in Letoit's
study. At the mention of the cheque for five thousand pounds
drawn in Mrs. Ashford-Lynne's favour by the Frenchman, he sprang
to his feet.</p>

<p>"Jesse, Mr. Dening! And you've kept that under cover all
night."</p>

<p>"One half of the night," the barrister laughed. "Don't forget,
Lorrimer, this information came to me in bits and had to be
fitted into a connected story. I've had to sort it out from quite
a lot of irrelevant facts."</p>

<p>"Well, you've made quite a story of it." The detective resumed
his seat and his breakfast. "Now, read me the riddle."</p>

<p>"Give me an explanation of how Matthew Ashcombe is able to
abstract registered parcels from the care of the postal
authorities; how Symonds' office came to be in that state of
broken furniture and blood; an explanation of Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne's call on Symonds, and why he left her in his
office while he came down to Fern Court, and I'll oblige." The
barrister laughed shortly.</p>

<p>"I can't." The Chief Inspector spoke decidedly. For some
moments he was silent, then looked up.</p>

<p>"I saw the Assistant Commissioner early this morning at his
home&mdash;in, fact, he was still in bed. I asked him to let me
handle the case personally. He agreed. There was one matter on
which we were in doubt."</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>"We came to the conclusion that you were pursuing some line of
inquiry connected with Symonds' work immediately prior to his
death. We believe that Symonds was working on a similar line of
inquiry, independent and unknown to you."</p>

<p>Dening nodded, as the Chief Inspector looked up
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"We were in doubt whether you would consider Symonds' murder
an integral part of your inquiry." The police officer paused for
quite an appreciable interval. "Look here, Mr. Dening, I am not
going to hand it to you wrapped up in tissue paper and tied with
fancy string. Here's the question that the Assistant Commissioner
and I want an answer to: Are you interested in the cause of
Symonds' murder&mdash;or, I should say, in the identity of the
murderer?"</p>

<p>"I am," the barrister answered without hesitation. "I believe,
as you do, that Symonds' death is intimately connected with the
Matthew Ashcombe inquiry. I'm going out for both crimes, and, by
hook or crook, I'll get the straight, true story. Mark me, I say
'story,' not 'stories,' for I believe that before I get to the
end of both trails I'll have only one story to tell, although
there may be quite a lot of incidental matters intruding."</p>

<p>"Good," Lorrimer thrust back his chair and rose from the
table. "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ashford-Lynne to see you, Master Richard." Mick Regan
spoke from the door.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ashford-Lynne?"</p>

<p>The two men stared in perplexity.</p>

<p>"I showed her into the study, Master Richard," the old man
explained. "I told her you hadn't been up long and wasn't
properly dressed, but she said that didn't matter; that she
wanted to see you, important, not your clothes. She seemed rather
excited and snappish, if I may say so." the men laughed. Dening
had a vivid remembrance of the woman's imperious manner. No doubt
she had tried to overawe and bully Mick.</p>

<p>"Know her, Lorrimer?"</p>

<p>"Don't think so." The Chief Inspector grinned. "You'll have to
see her, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I shall see her," Dening decided. "She's too intimately
connected with this mystery to be ignored; besides, she must have
some purpose for coming here. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" The police officer looked at his companion
questioningly.</p>

<p>"You're a distant connection of my family," the barrister
laughed slightly. "You live at&mdash;yes, Glasgow is far enough
away; I doubt if Mrs. Ashford-Lynne has ever been half that
distance from London. Yes, you're Dr. Watson, from Glasgow, and
not too bright in the 'nut' region. That do?"</p>

<p>"Right." The detective grinned. "I'm to play Dr. Watson to
you, Sherlock Holmes. Get ahead with it."</p>

<p>As he entered the study Dening hesitated for a moment,
scanning the woman seated beside the desk. She looked up as the
two men entered, nodding, indifferently, to the barrister, but
subjecting the Chief Inspector to a prolonged and almost insolent
stare.</p>

<p>She was a little woman, slight, yet well-formed and very
blonde. Dening judged that she could not be under forty; yet,
when under discreetly shaded lights she could well pass for a
women in her late twenties. Although he had known Archie Poly
Lynne indifferently well before his marriage, he had only met
this woman once. That was at the very uncomfortable interview
when he had to explain to her that her attempt to blackmail
Morris Pedlington had failed.</p>

<p>"I wish to speak to you alone," Mrs. Ashford-Lynne spoke
impatiently, barely acknowledging the barrister's bow. Her voice
was low and even; some would have called it pretty, ignoring the
harshness that underlay her tones.</p>

<p>"Dr. Watson, of Glasgow, a distant cousin, Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne." Dening motioned towards the Chief Inspector. "I
did not think you would object to him being present. He is very
interested in my work."</p>

<p>For a moment the woman hesitated; a small smile came on her
thin lips. Dening flushed. He could read what was passing in her
mind. She believed he feared to be alone with her.</p>

<p>"I want you to undertake an inquiry for me, Mr. Dening." The
woman completely ignored the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>"I am not a private inquiry agent Mrs. Ashford-Lynne," Dening
spoke coldly. "My work is that of legal consultant to solicitors and fellow-barristers, mainly on criminal problems."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford-Lynne stared at him a moment, in mock awe; then
laughed gently.</p>

<p>"What a mouthful," she mocked. "Am I to gather from all those
words that you refuse to help me?"</p>

<p>"For long I have understood you to be a client of Mr. Edward
Symonds."</p>

<p>"Mr. Symonds is dead."</p>

<p>"You read the papers, then, Mrs Ashford-Lynne?"</p>

<p>"Who doesn't?" She shrugged. "Mr. Symonds was supposed to have
been killed." She paused. "Was it in your chambers, Mr. Richard
Dening, or only in the court below?"</p>

<p>"Is that all you know, Mrs. Ashford-Lynne?" the barrister
smiled. Already he had succeeded in rousing the woman's quick
temper. "If you are interested and will step to the window, you
will see the light-standard&mdash;to the left&mdash;under which
Mr. Symonds was found stabbed."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Am I to understand that, when you read in the morning
newspapers that Mr. Edward Symonds had been murdered, and
therefore could not continue the commission you had entrusted him
with, that you decided to honour me?"</p>

<p>"Commission that I had entrusted him with&mdash;?" Fear showed
in the woman's face. "Mr. Dening&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Mrs. Ashford-Lynne, you were with Mr. Symonds, at his
offices, to a very late hour last night. In fact, I believe he
left you in his offices when he came down to Fern Court. I
suggest that you were awaiting his return." Lorrimer spoke
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Did you have an accident last night, Mrs. Ashford-Lynne?"
Dening suggested, when the police officer paused. "I hope you did
not cut yourself very severely when you fell and broke that
chair. Oh, by the bye," he turned to Lorrimer, "my dear Watson,
I left Mrs. Ashford-Lynne's vanity bag on the breakfast table. Do
you mind fetching it? I am sure she values it, and would like me
to return it to her as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Remembered it, Sherlock, and brought it with me." The Chief
Inspector dragged the dainty article from his pocket. He appeared
to be very awkward and as he placed the bag on the desk it
slipped from his fingers, the clasp opening and most of the
contents spilling on the desk and the floor.</p>

<p>"That's careless, Watson." The barrister went quickly round
the desk, stooping, with the detective, to retrieve the multitude
of trivial articles with which the bag had been filled.</p>

<p>A letter had drifted under the desk. To retrieve it, Dening
had to go down on hands and knees. For a brief moment he scanned
the address. He knew the handwriting, yet he could not, for the
moment, place it. Then, as he was handing it to the woman, memory
returned. That letter had been written by Sir John McNiven.</p>

<p>"Awfully careless of Watson," he apologised to the woman, who
was storing her articles in her bag. "Are you sure there is
nothing missing? Now, as regards that commission you were so good
as to offer me. I am afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have reconsidered the matter, Mr. Dening." The hard note
predominated in the woman's voice. "As you&mdash;guessed, I had
consulted Mr. Symonds. Now, however, I shall not act&mdash;at
least for the present."</p>

<p>"That may be a wise decision." Dening bowed gravely. He looked
up to see Mick in the doorway. "Is your car in Temple Lane, Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne?"</p>

<p>For the moment the woman hesitated, then turned to the door.
As she passed from the room she staggered slightly; recovering
almost immediately, and went out.</p>

<p>"The lady seems perturbed." Lorrimer spoke thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"She is." A glint of excitement gleamed in the barrister's
eyes. "She was greatly perturbed before she came here&mdash;so
agitated that she inadvertently slipped on her evening shoes
again, instead of her day shoes."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" The Chief Inspector swung round
quickly.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Watson." Triumph sounded in Dening's tones. "If
you had stooped before the lady, as I did, to retrieve her
knick-knacks, you would have discovered that the lady wore those
shoes when she visited Edward Symonds last night; and&mdash;that
on the delicate satin are minute drops of blood."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">LORRIMER left Dening's chambers a few minutes
after Mrs. Ashford-Lynne had taken her departure. He had promised
the barrister to have the woman watched. There was no possible
doubt, in the minds of the two men, that if she would she could
explain much that was indecipherable to them at that moment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford-Lynne had been in Symonds' office when the man
had left to come down to Fern Court. Dening believed that before
the inquiry agent had left his offices he and the woman had had a
long conference.</p>

<p>Yet, had Symonds left the woman in his offices? He knew that
Symonds had left the door of the clients' room unlocked for Ira
Canning's entry. If he expected the girl to call on him, then why
had he left the woman in that room? He knew that the two women
were acquainted, for Symonds had seen the girl when she had been
in Mrs. Ashford-Lynne's employ. Did he plan for them to meet? The
barrister could hardly believe that.</p>

<p>There was another possibility. He had to believe that Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne and the inquiry agent had talked in the latter's
offices that night. Had they finished their business and left the
office together; Symonds to come down to the Temple to consult
him, the woman for her home? Had she, after she had parted from
Symonds, returned to the offices, suddenly determined to await
his return? Had she found the clients' room door unlocked, and
entered? If so, then it was possible to reason on from there on
the lines Lorrimer had laid down. But, even then, that did not
explain the signs of a struggle in that room.</p>

<p>During some part of the evening a fight had happened in that
clients' room. Had Symonds been one of the participants? Was it
because of what had happened during the quarrel and resultant
trouble that Symonds had resolved to come to him? There was a
possibility. But, in that case, Symonds would never have left the
woman waiting amid that scene of chaos. He would have locked the
door, until he had made up his mind what action to take.</p>

<p>A theory, startling and bizarre, flashed into the barrister's
mind. Ira Canning had given him evidence to show that the woman
and Letoit were acquainted. The Frenchman had paid her a very
large sum of money. Reuben Gray had stated that the knife with
which Symonds had been stabbed had lain on the man's desk. Could
he, on those facts, reconstruct the crime with Letoit as the
murderer?</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashford-Lynne had received a large sum of money from
Anton Letoit. For what reason? Had the woman held the man to
blackmail? That was possible. Dening believed that the woman had
few scruples; that she acquired money in every possible way. Had
Letoit followed her to Symonds' offices, suspecting that she was
planning to bleed him for still larger sums of money? Had some
Latin emotional wave swept over the man, causing him to attack
the woman? Had Symonds intervened, to receive the fatal knife in
his chest? Had Letoit been the person who had conveyed the
inquiry agent's body to Fern Court? That was a feasible
explanation of the scene in Symonds' offices.</p>

<p>Theories and possibilities passed through the barrister's mind
as he completed his dressing after Lorrimer had left him. He had
to decide on a course of action. Definitely committed to the
unmasking of Matthew Ashcombe, he had now engaged to assist in
the pursuit of Symonds' murderer. The two cases appeared
dissimilar, yet an inner instinct told him that in some
intangible manner they were definitely linked.</p>

<p>His thoughts went to the girl he and Lorrimer had found on the
floor of that blood-spattered room, the previous night. They had
questioned her gently, fearing for her health if they applied any
too great pressure. What could she tell them? One definite link
she had established before he left her. That was the connection
between Letoit and her former employer. Could she add further to
that? Turning from his bedroom, Dening decided that his first
action should be to see the girl immediately.</p>

<p>Passing through his study he caught sight of his morning mail
stacked on his desk. It was not a large mail, and would only take
him a few minutes to scan. He sat down at his desk and opened the
envelopes. At the bottom of the pile lay a large envelope,
addressed to him and marked personal in a large, sprawling
writing. Slitting the envelope he drew out a thick
ornately-engraved card.</p>

<p>It was an invitation to visit the Blue Heaven night club. For
a moment the barrister sat, frowning thoughtfully at the card.
What did it mean? Turning the card carelessly between his fingers
he found some words scrawled on the back:</p>

<p class="letter">"Hope to see you at any time
convenient.&mdash;S.K."</p>

<p>So Sydney Kedwell had something to tell him, some matter he
had not thought wise to mention in the board room of the Altona
Trading Company. Dening smiled grimly, when he remembered Reuben
Gray's visit was followed by the murder of Edward Symons. What
would follow "Black Ked's" revelations? What had the ex-champion
boxer to tell him?</p>

<p>Against him was the matter of the marked bank-notes. Possibly
he had realised that his explanation of their arrival at the
night club was not too plausible; he might want to add further
explanations. Certainly a man of any mental calibre would guess
that, as matters stood, he must be under direct suspicion.</p>

<p>While Dening meditated over the card, Mick Regan entered the
room to inform him that the car was in the lane. Dening rose from
his desk, giving the man certain instructions for the day. Mick
nodded eagerly. He was never so happy as when engaged on some
investigation.</p>

<p>Entering the car, Dening drove down to the Embankment and
turned towards Westminster Bridge. As he passed Scotland Yard he
looked up at the many windowed red building. Somewhere in that
place were being woven the skeins that would bring Symonds'
murderer to the scaffold. Almost Dening raised his hat to the
building. While not absolutely infallible, Scotland Yard was as
near infallible as anything earthly could be.</p>

<p>Crossing the bridge, the barrister sped through the southern
suburbs. As he entered Brixton Road he automatically slowed the
machine drawing towards the curb. A few yards past the theatre he
recognised Ira Conning walking towards him. He brought the car to
a halt immediately before the girl.</p>

<p>"Why?" She glanced up, startled, then flushed. "Mr. Dening."
For a moment she hesitated. "Were you coming to see me?"</p>

<p>"I was." The barrister looked at the girl with admiration. The
previous night, amid the horror and gloom of the scene of the
tragedy, he had dimly recognised that the girl was remarkably
beautiful; but, at that time he was enthralled and enmeshed with
the problems that surrounded him.</p>

<p>Now, in the broad light of day, he recognised and bowed before
her beauty. She was not more than twenty-one or twenty-two; tall
she yet barely reached his chin; very finely and perfectly
formed, she carried herself with lithe gracefulness, her step
smooth and carefree. Her bright hazel eyes met his in fine
companionship.</p>

<p>"You are going to town, Miss Canning? Why, then&mdash;" He
turned eagerly towards the open door of the car. "Will you allow
me to drive you in? As you guessed, I was coming to see you."</p>

<p>For a moment the girl looked straightly at him then, without a
word, turned and entered the car.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Dening."</p>

<p>She noticed the little sigh of relief with which she sank on
the soft cushions. Sending the car forward, he circled the road,
heading back for the city. Once in the line of traffic he had
time to look at his companion again. The girl was staring
straight ahead, a little frown on her brows.</p>

<p>"Going to work, Miss Canning?" he asked somewhat
awkwardly.</p>

<p>"I think I told you and Mr. Lorrimer last night that I was not
in work, Mr. Dening."</p>

<p>The barrister flushed. What a fool he was, making inane
remarks of that sort. She had repeated the statement regarding
her lack of employment while on the drive to Brixton early that
morning; yet now he was inquiring whether she was on her way to
work.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have something in view," he suggested, after a
moment's pause. "The morning post may have brought you luck."</p>

<p>She smiled, rather bitterly. "Lately my luck has been
distinctly bad," she said involuntarily. "Last night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hope that blow on the head hasn't troubled you, Miss
Canning," He turned to face her quickly.</p>

<p>"Not the blow." She spoke almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>For a moment she did not reply, then laughed suddenly.</p>

<p>"You are a terribly direct person, Mr. Dening. If you want to
know, I was walking into the city to call on a friend."</p>

<p>Again the barrister was silent, frowning thoughtfully. A
sudden suspicion came to him. Furtively he scanned the girl's
face.</p>

<p>"You said you were walking to the city," he ventured.</p>

<p>Ira did not answer.</p>

<p>"I see you are not carrying a handbag."</p>

<p>"I told you, last night, that I had lost my bag." Petulance
lay in the girl's voice. "Is that what you came to see me about,
Mr. Dening?"</p>

<p>"No." Suddenly he recovered his self-possession. "When I saw
you walking down Brixton Road I noticed that you were not
carrying a bag. I should have left you Mrs. Ashford-Lynne's bag
last night. I had it with me, and forgot."</p>

<p>"Why should you leave Mrs. Ashford-Lynne's bag with me?" The
girl asked crossly.</p>

<p>"Because that bag contained a sum of money." He did not look
at the girl as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Do you think I would use that woman's money?" Ira spoke
crossly.</p>

<p>"In this world we have to do many things that are sometimes
distasteful. You mustn't forget that it is possible that Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne took your bag from Symonds' office by mistake." He
paused. "You said just now that you were walking to the city. It
is quite a long distance from Parkview Mansions."</p>

<p>For an appreciable time the girl remained silent, then laughed
freely.</p>

<p>"I think you have missed your vocation, Mr. Dening. You should
have been a detective&mdash;not a barrister."</p>

<p>"I have been credited with the former occupation&mdash;on
occasions."</p>

<p>"Then you know&mdash;" For a moment she hesitated. She turned
on the seat to face him&mdash;"You guessed that my lost bag
contained all my money?"</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;that something in my chambers told me that
this morning." The barrister spoke slowly. "There was quite a
number of things I should do immediately, yet&mdash;yet, I had
the impulse that I must come to see you at once." He paused. "You
were walking to the city, to see a friend. Will you be very angry
if I conclude that you were visiting that friend&mdash;for a
loan?"</p>

<p>For a time the girl was again silent; then shrugged
slightly.</p>

<p>"You are terribly direct, Mr. Dening." She paused. "Do you
want me to admit that your deductions are correct?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" He paused quickly. No, he could not offer this
girl money. She would reject it without hesitation. Yet she
confessed that she was penniless. Quickly he branched away from
the subject. "You told me that you were not working. Well, what
about a holiday? I have to run a short distance into the country
on business. To Ewell, in fact. Why not come with me? We shall
be back early in the afternoon, and then you can visit your
friend. A drive through the country will do quite a lot to
counteract that blow on the head last night, and&mdash;and you
will have time to think what is the best course to take."</p>

<p>For more than a mile the girl was silent. Already in the
distance they could see the slope up to the crown of the bridge.
Dening lifted his foot slightly, slowing the car.</p>

<p>"You really have business in the country, Mr. Dening?" The
girl glanced at him curiously.</p>

<p>"I will make an affidavit to that effect." He grinned down at
her. "Besides, perhaps during the day we may be able to think of
some means of recovering your lost handbag."</p>

<p>She looked up at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector Lorrimer appears to think that Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne was in Edward Symonds' offices last night. You told
me that your bag is very similar to hers; perhaps she took your
bag by mistake."</p>

<p>Ira nodded. "You think that it was Mrs. Ashford-Lynne who
pushed me last night?"</p>

<p>Dening nodded. "Then&mdash;direction Ewell?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Direction Ewell," she smiled. "Thank you, Mr. Dening. I shall
enjoy a drive in your car."</p>

<p>The barrister turned into a side street, circling through a
maze of narrow streets back to the main road. For a few moments
he was silent, then started to talk on inconsequent subjects,
intent on taking the girl's mind from her troubles. Under his
keen play of wit, and Dening could be a very interesting
companion when he chose, he soon had his companion laughing and
chatting merrily. Throughout the outer suburbs Dening let the car
out, drawing up at Ewell before the doors of the Royal George
Hotel.</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector Lorrimer quite spoilt my breakfast this
morning," he lied gracefully. "I really cannot absorb food and
horrors at the same time."</p>

<p>Ira laughed. In the dining room of the popular country hotel
the barrister found his suspicions confirmed. The loss of the
bag, containing most, if not all, of her store of money, had
caused the girl to make but a sketchy breakfast. She tackled the
elaborate late breakfast the barrister ordered with spirit and
real appetite.</p>

<p>A short rest and again they sped on through the country.
Outside Ewell Dening turned into a maze of country lanes. He came
on a wide road and descending a steel hill ran into the little
village of Grays.</p>

<p>Half a mile past the village he again brought the car to a
halt. On both sides of the roads were thick woods, broken on the
left-hand side by ruined, wide gates, of which little but the
stone pillars remained. The space had been roughly boarded, but a
few boards had been broken out, permitting ingress.</p>

<p>"Grays Manor." Dening answered the girl's look of inquiry.
"One of the landmarks of England's past. The Grays were, in their
day, powers in this countryside; they ruled the lands&mdash;and
they were very wide&mdash;in almost feudal state. To-day&mdash;"
he paused. "Yesterday I heard the present head of this once
powerful family described as a&mdash;a guinea pig."</p>

<p>For a moment he was silent, staring through the trees at the
top of the house, half-hidden by the trees from the road. He
slipped from the car, opening the door on the girl's side
invitingly.</p>

<p>Wondering greatly, Ira stepped down to the road. The barrister
helped her through the break in the fence and led her along the
neglected avenue until they came within sight of the house.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;once the Grays were lords of the countryside," he
murmured, partly to himself. "To-day, they are forgotten&mdash;a
new man sits in their stead, rules what is left of their lands.
Their house is a ruin; uninhabited except for foxes and
bats."</p>

<p>"No one lives here?" The girl looked about her
questioningly.</p>

<p>"The birds of the air&mdash;the furry denizens of the woods,"
The barrister smiled down at Ira. "Miss Canning, may I confide in
you? I believe the old ruin to be the central factor in one of
the greatest crime problems England has ever witnessed."</p>

<p>For a moment the girl was silent; then looked up at her
companion.</p>

<p>"I think I understand," she hesitated. "You brought me here
because&mdash;because you believe that the problem you are trying
to solve, this old house and&mdash;and my accident at Mr.
Symonds' offices last night, are all connected."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">DENING did not answer immediately. Taking the
girl's arm he moved towards the manor house. They came to the
edge of the wood and stood, surveying the ruins.</p>

<p>Grays Manor had once been an imposing building. Low and
widespread, the old grey walls were thickly covered with ivy, The
glass and window frames had disappeared, leaving only sightless
holes in the walls through which the ivy was exploring the house.
The chimneys, standing gaunt against the skyline, and without the
natural break of the roof, were broken and ruined. Only a few
beams indicated where the roof had once crested the building.</p>

<p>Immediately before them lay what remained of the lawns and
gardens. Already fair-sized trees had encroached far beyond their
confines. Bushes had propagated everywhere; the grass-spaces were
now tangles of weeds.</p>

<p>Dening surveyed the scene wonderingly. Sir John McNiven had
stated that the architects he had consulted had declared the
house impossible to repair. But, that was over thirty, possibly
forty, years ago. Had it been impossible to repair the place at
that time? He doubted it. So far as he could see the walls were
sound. Most of the decay he was witnessing was due to continued
neglect. An empty house could deteriorate greatly in forty years.
He shrugged. Was this another of the statements he had heard at
the Altona Trading Company that was entirely false?</p>

<p>He knew that on the previous afternoon he had been told many
lies. It was those lies, possibly, that had caused him to act on
impulse and accept the commission these men offered. It had
seemed a challenge&mdash;a challenge his quickened blood had
refused to allow him to decline. He had taken that challenge to
unmask the mysterious blackmailer Matthew Ashcombe; at the same
time he determined that when he made his report&mdash;when he
told those men which of them was the blackmailer&mdash;he would
also reveal to them the intimate details of the business they had
feared to trust him with.</p>

<p>Slowly Dening and Ira circled the large expanse of ground on
which the old house stood. At one point, on the west side of the
house, they came on a well-defined path. Here Dening stopped for
some minutes. So far as he could judge, that path led in the
direction in which Upton Lodge lay. Why had that path been
trodden between the new house and the old manor? True, it was
merely a track, but it showed signs of frequent use. He walked
along it a few yards and came to a depression where the earth was
soft. There he could see marks of boots&mdash;marks that had been
very recently left by some traveller. For some minutes he studied
them carefully.</p>

<p>Why had Sir John McNiven allowed Grays Manor to fall into that
state of decay, yet had a well-worn and frequently used field
path between it and his own house? He went further along the
path, walking quickly. Cresting a small rise he saw in the
distance a large house, surrounded by wide grounds. The path led
directly to the boundaries of that house. He believed it to be
Upton Lodge.</p>

<p>Someone at Upton Lodge was interested in Grays Manor; so
interested that they frequently visited it. He believed that
person to be sir John McNiven. But, why had the owner of the
property allowed the surroundings of the ruins to fall into that
state of disrepair, even allowing the gates to fall away into
uselessness&mdash;to have to board up the entrance to the
avenue.</p>

<p>Rejoining Ira, Dening started to explore the house. He came to
a stout oaken door, hanging crazily from broken hinges. It took
some effort to push it open. He found himself in a flagged
passage. He had entered the offices of the house. Room after room
was vacant, without doors or windows. He came to a flight of
stone stairs and ascended them, to come out on the big hall,
stone-flagged and high arched. Wide stone stairs led to the upper
stories, above his head massive oak beams stretched from wall to
wall. He could see the ruins of the roof and beyond the blue sky,
strangely bright in the gloom of the old house.</p>

<p>No one could possibly inhabit Grays Manor; yet Matthew
Ashcombe had given directions that registered parcels should be
addressed to him at that place. Dening believed that in some way
Grays Manor played a big part in the problem he had set himself
to solve; but in what way?</p>

<p>Putting aside the many thoughts that crowded his brain, Dening
set himself to gather a complete knowledge of the geography of
the place. He believed that before he found the solutions he
sought he would have to visit the place frequently. It would be
well to be able to find his way about it.</p>

<p>At length, certain that he knew the place intimately, he
sought Ira. For the time he had neglected her shamefully. He went
in search of her, to find her seated on a tree trunk on one side
of the avenue from the gate to the house. As he approached she
looked up, smiling.</p>

<p>"Bored, Miss Canning? Awfully sorry I left you so long."</p>

<p>"I had plenty to occupy my thoughts, Mr. Dening." For the
moment the girl's face clouded.</p>

<p>"Meaning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yesterday was rather&mdash;rather&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Disastrous." The barrister smiled down on the girl. For a
moment he was thoughtful, then seated himself by her side. "Look
here, Miss Canning, The problem that's troubling you
is&mdash;where you're going to find a job&mdash;and at once.
Isn't that right?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded; looking up at him, questioningly.</p>

<p>"You went to see Edward Symonds, thinking he might offer you a
post as private secretary," the barrister continued. "Why? Did
you think you would like the work of a private inquiry
office?"</p>

<p>"What choice had I?" The girl spoke in low tones. "Working
girls haven't much choice in their employment. They had to keep
working, or&mdash;Mrs. Ashford-Lynne didn't pay very well; not
much above what it costs to live and dress decently. My money
soon went when I was idle." She paused. "If Mr. Symonds had
offered me a job I would have taken it&mdash;however much I
disliked the work&mdash;and done my best. It was that or
starve."</p>

<p>"Then, if a job was offered you, you would take it, eh?"</p>

<p>"To work is good; some work is nicer than other work, of
course." She looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"Have you guessed why I asked you to come out here to-day?"
Dening spoke abruptly.</p>

<p>"I know you did not bring me here out of idle curiosity." The
girl flushed slightly. "I&mdash;I think you guessed I was hard
up&mdash;that the loss of my bag had been staggering. I think I
understand why you were hungry, and&mdash;and stopped at that
hotel."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;you are guessing that our visit here, and other
things that may occur before we return to London, are not the
irresponsible wanderings of an idle man with too much money and
time on his hands?"</p>

<p>Ira laughed gaily. "I don't believe you belong to the idle
rich class, Mr. Dening."</p>

<p>"Then you are guessing that finding you in Edward Symonds'
offices last night, his death, and your recent work with Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne, are of distinct interest to me?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded again; this time questioningly.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" Dening felt that he was behaving in a decidedly
awkward manner. "Then, if I offer you a job will you believe that
it is in connection with these happenings?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Ira stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"You're wondering what sort of a job I can offer you? Oh, I
know I told you that I was a barrister&mdash;but I am a strange
sort of barrister; one very uncommon. Some of my barrister
friends look upon me as an outcast from their
fraternity&mdash;they can't understand why I am allowed to retain
my chambers; they think I should be expelled from the sacred
enclosure with bell, book and candle." He laughed slightly. "Yet
some of the men who openly avow that belief owe quite a lot of
their success, in their court pleadings, to my underground
work."</p>

<p>For a moment he paused, then continued:</p>

<p>"I suppose I'm rather inquisitive by nature. Anyway, I've cut
out a line of work for myself in this world; work that has the
approval and has obtained the interest of New Scotland Yard; work
that Mr Symonds held a rather high opinion of; work that is
accepted and valued by those of my confrères who are not too
bigoted." He paused. "Miss Canning, all this is leading to one
issue. Symonds' death was the culminating point in a series of
little incidents that have aroused my curiosity. For a long time
I have been working alone&mdash;or rather, with the help of my
man, Mick Regan. Mr. Symonds did a lot of detail work that I
shall now have to place in other, possibly less reliable hands. I
shall have to add quite a lot of it to my personal work. That
means that I shall have to obtain help&mdash;" He paused again,
feeling rather helpless.</p>

<p>"And all these words mean, Mr. Dening, that you are trying to
gracefully offer me employment." The girl looked up, slightly
flushed. "Will you please tell me if&mdash;if they are only
words&mdash;words meant out of kindness&mdash;or whether they are
solemnly and strictly true?"</p>

<p>"Cut my throat and cross my heart." Laughingly the barrister
performed the childish ritual. "Then, that's settled?"</p>

<p>"What is settled?" Ira looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>"That now you are my secretary; that you have been that for
the past thirty seconds." Dening smiled down at her. "You guessed
that I was offering you employment; I have guessed that you have
accepted it. My chambers are at 6, Fern Court, Temple. The
business hours vary extensively. Sometimes, and usually, from ten
to five, with the usual hour for lunch. Sometimes from midnight
to midnight. It all depends how the work is progressing and how
it is affecting us."</p>

<p>"Do you really think I can help you?" Ira turned to face the
barrister, her eyes shining.</p>

<p>"One of the first rules and possibly the chief rule, of the
office of Dening and Co., is that no idle questions are asked.
Business has to be strictly practical and accurate; theories are
barred out." The man was laughing away her doubts. "Come along.
We must get back to the car or some country policeman will be
briefing us for parking in an illegal area. Besides, we have a
call to make half a mile up the road."</p>

<p>Talking inconsequently, to give the girl time to adjust
herself to the changed relations that had come between them, he
led her down to the car and drove the half-mile to Upton Lodge.
Passing the entrance gates he found a spot from where he could
get a good view of the front of the house; yet not close enough
to attract undue attention.</p>

<p>For some time he sat, carefully scanning the exterior of the
house and its surroundings. Upton Lodge was only about half the
size of Grays Manor. Yet it was a building of considerable
extent. A two-storey house, the walls roughcast, the roof of red
tiles, it was not an asset to the countryside. Across the front
of the building, and elevated from the ground by half a dozen
steps, a wide veranda straddled the lower floors. Dening thought
it was just the sort of place that would attract a man of Sir
John McNiven's character.</p>

<p>As the man and girl sat watching the house, two men came out
on the veranda. Dening immediately recognised one of the men as
Sir John McNiven. The other man was a stranger. Yet, was he?
Something in his build and walk, the manner in which he
gesticulated while talking to the financier appeared strangely
familiar. But, rack his memory as he would, the barrister could
not give him a name.</p>

<p>For quite a while the two men paced the veranda, engrossed in
excited conversation. At last, they apparently came to some
agreement. At the head of the steps they parted; the stranger
descending to the grounds. There he turned to again face Sir
John. The financier was explaining something, pointing to the
east and waving his arm, as if explaining the lay of the
land.</p>

<p>At length the man nodded understandingly, and crossed the
grounds in the direction the financier had indicated. For a few
minutes Sir John McNiven watched him, then turned and entered the
house. The stranger walked swiftly to a small gate in the
boundary fence and disappeared.</p>

<p>Then Dening remembered. If he had read the topography of the
district correctly the man was making for the path that ran
between Grays Manor and Upton Lodge. Swiftly the barrister
accelerated the engine. A few yards along the road and he found a
place where he could turn the car.</p>

<p>"Miss Canning." He spoke while the car was running swiftly in
the direction of Grays. "Do you remember seeing a path coming out
of the woods and leading to the ruins? Right. That man, who has
just left Upton Lodge, is making for the ruins along that path, I
believe. I want to know what he is doing at the ruins. I want to
find out who he is, if I can. Do you mind if I leave you on the
road, in the car, for a short time?"</p>

<p>"Do you always ask your secretaries their wishes regarding
your work, Mr. Dening?" The girl looked up demurely, a little
twinkle in her eyes. "Of course, I am not afraid to be left alone
in the car. But, isn't there anything I can do?"</p>

<p>"Not for the present." The barrister spoke absently. He
brought the car to a stop before a gap in the stone wall, a few
yards before the gates. "I won't be longer than I can help."</p>

<p>Ira watched him disappear in the bushes, a little smile
growing on her lips. For a few minutes she sat thoughtful, then
slipped from the car and followed Dening into the woods.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">ON leaving the car, Dening ran through the weeds
in the direction of the little path between Upton Lodge and Grays
Manor, avoiding the open avenue from the gates to the house. A
long wait, and he heard footsteps on the path. A few seconds and
a man came in view, walking quickly. He passed from the trees on
to what had once been gardens surrounding the manor house, making
for the little door by which Dening had previously entered the
house, and disappeared.</p>

<p>The barrister was puzzled. What did the man want in that ruin?
He could not but believe that he had come there with the
knowledge and sanction of Sir John McNiven. Certainly the knight
had pointed out the field path to him.</p>

<p>Keeping well under cover, Dening moved to the door. He had
some difficulty in forcing it open without noise. At length he
was able to peer into the passage. The man was not in sight.</p>

<p>Still moving as noiselessly as he could, the barrister started
to explore the ruins. He had to move with the utmost caution. He
went up the great staircase to the upper floors. There he had to
proceed still more warily; at places he had to walk over great
oak beams with only the flags of the ground floor beneath him,
dodging from beam to beam, not knowing if some piece of wood,
rotted through, would not collapse under his weight and let him
down to death or a severe injury.</p>

<p>There was no one on the upper floors; nowhere where anyone
could hide from him, if they had been up there. He came again to
the wide stone stairway and descended to the great hall. There he
looked about him perplexedly. He knew that the man had entered
the ruins. He expected to discover him, and the purpose for which
he had come to the old manor house, almost as soon as he entered
the building. But he had found no signs of the man. Listening
intently, he could not hear a movement in the building.</p>

<p>Where had the man gone to? A moment and he realised that he
had been wasting his time exploring the top floors. The man would
not have gone up there. If he was still in the place, then he was
on the ground floor, where the flagstones gave secure walking, or
down in the offices. He turned towards the stairs by which he had
ascended to the big hall, to stop suddenly. There was another
flight of stair, in a far, dark corner. Somehow he had overlooked
them in his first hurried survey of the place. He went to the
doorway; there was no door to it, though a pair of rusty hinges
swung uselessly from staples. Beyond the doorway was a flight of
steps.</p>

<p>Feeling before him cautiously, he went down the steps, to come
to an abrupt halt before a stout door. He placed his hand in his
pocket, to find that he had left his torch in the car. For a
moment he hesitated, then tried to find a handle. There was not
one. He felt over the surface of the door and found a keyhole. He
tried to peer through it, but what lay behind the door was in
darkness. He felt in his pocket for matches, to produce only his
lighter. The little flame from the cigar-lighter revealed a new
wooden door, barring his way. He threw his weight against it, but
the door would not budge. He felt along the lintels carefully,
finally deciding that the door was locked.</p>

<p>So the man who had entered the ruins before him had gone that
way. While he had been searching the top floors the man had
passed through that door, locking it behind him. What had been
his object? What secret lay behind that door?</p>

<p>Whatever the man he had seen on the veranda of Upton Lodge had
come to the manor house to find lay behind that locked door. Sir
John McNiven was party to what was there. He tried to conceive
some reason for that locked door in that old ruin, and lost
himself in a maze of speculation. Whatever that secret was, he
believed it would not bear the light of day.</p>

<p>Ascending the steps, he came to the open air and walked down
the avenue to the lodge gates. He knew that in the house he had
left signs of his presence, his footsteps were scattered round
the place. It was impossible to take any means of concealing his
traces; then he must be certain that what trails he had left must
be accredited to the curiosity of a casual tourist.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the car he was astonished to find that Ira
Canning had left it. A moment, and he laughed. Possibly she had
become tired of sitting idly there and was exploring the woods.
He stretched out his hand to the horn to recall her, then
hesitated. Before he did that he would complete his tracks for
the bafflement of anyone who became inquisitive regarding his
presence at the old manor. So far his trail led from the woods to
the back door of the building, and from that door to the road
gates.</p>

<p>Taking care not to tread on his trail from the house to the
road, he went back to Grays Manor, skirting round the house to
the side door. From there he went to the woods, close to the
point where he had emerged on the neglected grounds. He glanced
back, with a low chuckle. If anyone tried to follow his trails
they would have to consider that he had entered through the
ruined gateway and after exploring the house had ventured into
the woods; returning at length to the road by the way he had
come.</p>

<p>Before leaving the little path he glanced along it in the
direction of Upton Lodge. Something white on the path caught his
eyes. Keeping in the shelter of the trees, he went down alongside
the trail. The white thing was a handkerchief. He knew that it
had not been there when he went along that trail before visiting
Upton Lodge. Then, the man who had come to the ruins had dropped
it.</p>

<p>Finding a long stick in the woods, Dening lifted the
handkerchief from the path. Again in the shelter of the woods he
carefully examined the linen square. There was no name on it, no
initials. All he could find was the laundry mark. With a smile he
placed the handkerchief in his pocket. The next day Mick Regan
would trail down that laundry and obtain the name of the owner of
the handkerchief.</p>

<p>At length he came to the road. Before going down to the car he
carefully obliterated all signs of his having entered the woods
through the gap in the fence. He had hardly completed his task
when Ira came out of the woods.</p>

<p>"Did you find him?" the girl called long before she reached
him.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "There's something strange about that
place," he said. "I saw that men enter and followed. I&mdash;" He
hesitated. "I found that part of the cellars was barred off from
the rest of the place by a strong door. That door was locked; so
far as I could see both door and lock were new."</p>

<p>He shut the door of the car behind the girl and slipped into
the driver's seat. They had almost reached Ewell before the girl
spoke again.</p>

<p>"I went through the woods," she said, somewhat inconsequently.
"Did you miss me."</p>

<p>Dening nodded. "Sorry I was so long. It must have been
wearisome waiting alone in the car."</p>

<p>"I left the car soon after you disappeared into the woods,"
Ira answered candidly. "I went to the house and saw that man
arrive, but I did not see you."</p>

<p>Dening was surprised. He half turned, smiling.</p>

<p>"I will have to acknowledge that you are some bushman," he
said. "I watched about me very carefully and had no idea that
there was anyone else but that man and myself in the woods."</p>

<p>"I found this."</p>

<p>Ira opened her hand. On her palm lay a single gold coin.
Dening took it curiously. It was a five-dollar gold piece.</p>

<p>"Where did you find this?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"At the head of a flight of steps. I think it must be the
steps you say the man went down. I saw him go into one of the
dark corners of the great hall and disappear. A little while and
I went to where I had last seen him. He was not there. I was just
turning away when I saw something glittering at my feet. I picked
up that."</p>

<p>"And you and the man were in the house, on the ground floor,
while I was climbing from beam to beam of the upper floors, like
a squirrel."</p>

<p>"I know." The girl nodded her head gravely. "I heard you. Once
I thought I saw you and feared that you would fall. I daren't
call out because that man had gone down the steps. I think I
heard him shut the door you say is at the foot of the steps."</p>

<p>Dening did not answer. He was frankly puzzled. How had the
gold coin come at the head of the steps? Had the man accidentally
dropped it when he took the key of the door from his pocket? That
was possible. Then, who was the man; and what was an American
five dollar coin doing in the old Grays Manor?</p>

<p>For the moment the thought of the American, Rudolph N. Rudder,
came to his mind. No, the man who had come along the field path
was not Rudder. He had not the build, the free swinging stride of
the rum-runner king.</p>

<p>A gold coin and a handkerchief; the sight of a man leaving
Upton Lodge for Grays Manor, at the direction of Sir John
McNiven. That was the sum total of their discoveries that day.
They were facts, true, but they only added to the mystery not
towards its solution.</p>

<p>A glance at his watch as he drove into the town and he drew up
before the King George hostelry. It was long after midday, and in
spite of his double breakfast he was hungry.</p>

<p>Again he was inclined to think he had acted hastily in
leaving Grays Manor without further investigation. Now he was
certain that the man had remained in the ruins. How long would he
stay there? Would he return to Upton Lodge, or&mdash;? How had he
come to Grays?</p>

<p>Dening now believed that somewhere in the woods surrounding
the old manor was concealed a motor car. He had seen no signs of
a strange car at Sir John's place. He was certain that no car had
driven from Upton Lodge that day. Then either the man was a guest
at the financier's house, or he had driven down from the city. He
had not come to Grays by train. There was no local station; he
would have had to walk out from Ewell. No, that man had come from
London, probably that morning. When would he return?</p>

<p>During lunch, Dening tried to talk to the girl on inconsequent
matters, but found her strangely unresponsive. On seating herself
at the table she had placed the coin beside her plate.
Continually through the meal she glanced at it, while replying,
somewhat inconsequently, to the barrister's remarks.</p>

<p>"What is it worth, Mr. Dening?" she asked at length.</p>

<p>"In English money, to-day, about twenty-five shillings," he
answered laughing. "You've done a profitable morning's work, Miss
Canning. By the way, put it in your bag. We might forget it when
we leave."</p>

<p>In answer, she pushed the coin towards him. "The coin belongs
to your investigations, Mr. Dening."</p>

<p>"Findings keepings," he laughingly objected.</p>

<p>"Then put it in your pocket for me, please. You forget, I have
lost my bag."</p>

<p>He nodded gravely. She had told him the bag she had lost the
previous evening contained all her money. Possibly that gold coin
comprised all her wealth. He remembered when he had met her, that
she had acknowledged that she was walking into the city to borrow
from a friend. He slipped the coin into his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>"Five dollar pieces are rather awkward coinage in the city of
London," he laughed. "Remember, before we part to remind me to
change it for you."</p>

<p>She looked up at him gratefully, twenty-five shillings would
go far to replace the money that had been lost with her purse
when she had visited Symonds' offices the previous evening. She
was about to speak when a man entered the dining room.</p>

<p>Something in Dening's face caught her attention and held her
silent. She tried to guess the meaning of the expressions that
chased across his face. At first a puzzled frown, as if he were
trying to open some cell of his memory; then followed a dawning
knowledge. Suddenly he hunched over his plate, bending his head
low, until the man had crossed the room to the seat indicated by
the waitress. Then he spoke, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Finished, Miss Canning? Then we'll stroll down and see if
there's a bag shop that can supply a deficit."</p>

<p>Ira noticed that until they passed through the door into the
hall of the hotel the barrister contrived to keep his back to the
room. She glanced back at the stranger. He was engrossed with the
waitress, ordering his meal carefully. She wondered. Did the
barrister fear that man? No, she could not think that of him.
Then&mdash;</p>

<p>On the street she turned to him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dening, were you serious when you told me that you
required a secretary?"</p>

<p>"Serious? Indeed, very."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;I am engaged?" She flushed faintly as she
spoke.</p>

<p>"Absolutely, yes."</p>

<p>"Then, please, who is that man?" When he did not reply
immediately, she added, "Oh, I know you recognised him. Was he
the man you saw going from Upton Lodge to Grays Manor? Is he the
man who dropped that handkerchief&mdash;and my coin?"</p>

<p>Dening nodded. "I believe so." A moment's pause, and he
continued, lowering his voice, "He is Enrico Culadi, a noted
Chicagoan gunman, and a great friend of Rudolph N. Rudder, the
man they call the rum king of Miquelon and St. Pierre."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">THROUGH the drive back to the city Richard
Dening was very silent. Every hour was making his problem more
complex. What was Enrico Culadi doing in England&mdash;at Grays
Manor?</p>

<p>He had come in contact with the man on one of his frequent
visits to the United States. Five years ago he had been in
Chicago when Enrico Culadi had stood his trial for murder. Many
days he had sat in the courthouse, intent on the evidence
unfolding in one of the most noted American trials&mdash;to see
the processes of the law resolve into the farce the newspapers
had unanimously prophesied&mdash;the release of Culadi by order
of a fearful jury, against a stupendous weight of evidence. He
had stood on the court-house steps and watched the man walk to
liberty surrounded by a bodyguard of admiring friends; a sneer on
his lips at the impotence of the law.</p>

<p>He should have recognised that long, thin body, taut with the
lithe grace of a wild animal, at sight; yet never for a moment
had he thought to see the man in England. He had not recognised
him in the woods, yet he had immediately remembered him when he
entered the hotel dining-room. Had Culadi recognised him? He
wondered. If so, what would he do?</p>

<p>Again his thoughts went to those days in Chicago. He had seen
Culadi the day after the trial ended. With some friends, in his
hotel lounge, he had discussed the trial and its probable
influence on the crime wave that was then sweeping the country.
Incautiously he had expressed the opinion that in the
circumstances the ordinary processes of law should be set aside
and the gunmen hunted down under martial law&mdash;outlawed and
shot at sight. A sudden exclamation from one of the group had
caused him to turn&mdash;to meet the gunman's fixed, mirthless
grin. Culadi had overheard, and resented his remarks. Later he
had received a mysterious message. The gunman considered himself
insulted. In his own time he would seek revenge.</p>

<p>He had repeated the message, laughingly, to his friends. To
his surprise they had treated the threat seriously, insisting
that he leave Chicago immediately.</p>

<p>Time had forced him to realise that the threat was very real.
Twice he had received packages from America. Each package
contained a silver bullet. With the second bullet had come a
message&mdash;a threat.</p>

<p>Dening drove Ira to the Temple and introduced her to the scene
of her future work, giving her a key to the chambers, so that she
could come and go without reference to Mick or himself. Mick made
no comment when Dening explained the girl's future position in
the household. For a brief moment his old eyes had rested on the
girl's fair face, then had passed swiftly to his master. Dening
had found himself flushing, he could not understand why.</p>

<p>Before he sent the girl home there was an episode that caused
them both some embarrassment. Dening knew that the girl was
without funds. He did not know whether she was in debt, due to
her long unemployment. For a considerable time they sat in the
study, the barrister trying to find an opening for what he wanted
to say. Then, blushing like a shy schoolboy:</p>

<p>"There's just one other matter. I shall want all your wits and
attention for our work. You can't give me that if you're worried.
You'd better put that in your bag&mdash;" He paused, shoving a
roll of notes across the desk. "&mdash;you can pay it back if you
want to, when you're ahead again."</p>

<p>Ira flushed. For a moment she hesitated, then took the money
with a low word of thanks. He felt absurdly grateful that she had
not raised objections&mdash;made a fuss over the simple matter.
She was a girl with common-sense! He hoped that while they worked
together he would have her understanding; that he wouldn't have
to fool around for words to cloak his meanings in. He would be
able to speak directly all that lay in his mind&mdash;and she
would understand.</p>

<p>"Mick will drive you home, Miss Canning." He rose from his
chair. "You'll like him, he's one of the best; was with my father
all his life, and now looks after me." He flushed slightly. "You
see, Mick doesn't understand that I've grown up. I'm still Master
Richard to him&mdash;the boy who used to worry him during the
holidays. He runs these chambers and does quite a lot in inquiry
work for me. When you come here to-morrow morning you'll find he
has everything set for you&mdash;a desk, typewriter, and all
that."</p>

<p>He went down with the girl and Mick to where the car waited in
Temple Lane and watched it drive down to the Embankment, feeling
strangely lonely when it turned out of sight. He had wanted to
ask the girl to stay in town and dine with him&mdash;somehow he
had lacked the courage to voice an invitation. Abruptly, he
turned and went back to his chambers. They looked strangely
empty&mdash;before that evening he had thought they lacked
nothing.</p>

<p>Sitting idly at his desk, fingering the papers on it, he
chanced on Kedwell's invitation to the Blue Heaven night-club. He
turned it over, again reading the scrawled words on the back. Why
did Black Ked want him to visit the Club? Had he something to
tell him; something that might help clear the mysteries in which
he was at present groping?</p>

<p>Reuben Gray had sought him out immediately after the meeting
at the Altona Trading Company's offices. Had Black Ked the same
thought when he had penned those scrawled words on the back of
the card? That was possible. But did the man know of the
fast-moving tragedy that had followed Gray's visit? That he would
discover when he faced the man.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch, then went into his bedroom. A few
minutes under the shower and the fatigues of the day slipped from
him. He dressed leisurely and drove to his club. Joining some
friends he made an excellent dinner, then cut into a rubber at
bridge.</p>

<p>It was past eleven when he made an excuse and left the club.
Hailing a taxi, he gave the night-club's address, and a few
minutes later was set down at the door of a gloomy-looking house
in a by-street of Soho. Almost as his foot touched the pavement
the door opened and a gaudily-garbed footman appeared. Dening
produced the card Kedwell had sent him and the man motioned him
to enter.</p>

<p>He found himself in a wide, rather bare hall. Immediately a
page took him in charge, escorting him past swinging doors to the
inner vestibule of the club. There he left his outdoor wraps and
followed the boy into the restaurant. A waiter led him to a
well-placed table. He found he had an excellent view of the room,
while partially screened from general observation.</p>

<p>The Blue Heaven differed little from the numerous night clubs
that littered the west-end of London. No attempt had been made to
carry out any idea suggested by the title. The restaurant was
large and had an unusually spacious area for dancing. Close to
Dening's table a broad flight of stairs led to the upper storeys,
branching on a landing to right and left. The barrister guessed
that on the upper floors other amusements&mdash;perhaps not too
legal&mdash;awaited favoured guests. That, however, did not
concern him.</p>

<p>Contrary to his expectations, Dening found both food and
service excellent. When the wine-steward visited his table he
discovered that the club possessed an excellent cellar. For a
time he found amusement in watching the quickly changing scenes.
He had noticed, when he came to the table, that it was set for
only one person, and that his name was on the reserve-card. So
Kedwell had expected him that night! Then&mdash;where was
Kedwell?</p>

<p>For a time he waited, lazily curious of what was to happen. He
believed that immediately he had entered the club, word of his
arrival had been taken to Kedwell. He approved the diplomacy of
the man. Before any business was discussed he was to have his
meal in peace, served with all possible attention to his comfort
and well-being.</p>

<p>Afterwards&mdash;He grinned. The game was too obvious. When
other men came into the club alone one or other of the hostesses
drifted towards them with words of welcome and hints of
companionship. They had not approached him.</p>

<p>He scanned the gathering for faces he knew; to find there were
a number of groups where he could cut in, a welcome guest. As he
reviewed the scene he noticed tables set in quaintly screened
alcoves, where a certain privacy could be obtained, yet the
occupants would not be cut off too completely from the gaiety on
the general floor. The table he sat at was in one of these
alcoves.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stiffened. A man and woman were strolling down the
stairs. He could not see them very distinctly for the lights were
dimmed; an exhibition dance was in progress. He believed the man
to be Kedwell, and smiled. Had the man waited until general
attention was diverted to the dancers before coming into the
restaurant?</p>

<p>He thought the woman's outline was familiar, naming her for
Mrs. Ashford-Lynne. So Kedwell was playing about with that woman.
He shook his head thoughtfully. The ex-champion boxer was
certainly looking for trouble. Mrs. Ashford-Lynne was an
expensive playfellow for anyone who possessed money.</p>

<p>Almost as the couple reached the foot of the stairs the dance
ended and the lights were switched on. The woman turned quickly,
making for one of the alcoves&mdash;an alcove almost immediately
opposite to where Dening sat. Kedwell hesitated a moment, then
caught up to his companion with a few quick steps, striding
beside her, whispering urgently. The woman nodded, impatiently.
The man stopped, turned and came straight to where Dening
sat.</p>

<p>"Evening, Mr. Dening!" The tall, well-formed figure of the
ex-boxer faced Dening across the table. "Hope they're making you
comfortable?"</p>

<p>"Splendidly!" The barrister smiled. "Busy, Mr. Kedwell? No?
Well, sit down and join me in a glass of this very excellent
wine?"</p>

<p>Kedwell nodded and drew out the chair opposite the barrister.
For two or three minutes he watched the dancers, a frown on his
face.</p>

<p>"Glad you came to-night." He turned suddenly to face his
guest. "You don't play about much in these places&mdash;and with
these people?" There was contempt in his voice.</p>

<p>"About the third night-club I have visited in my life. No,
they don't attract me."</p>

<p>"Mostly fools!" Kedwell shrugged. "Payin' fools,
y'know&mdash;but damned fools, all the same. Can't understand
what kick they get out of it? It bores me!"</p>

<p>"The art of drifting with the stream," Dening laughed
slightly. "They go to night-clubs because others go. They come
here, Kedwell, because someone has loudly proclaimed that to do
so is 'the thing.' They don't think&mdash;they want others to do
that for them. They're the followers in the human herd&mdash;and,
following, believe they attain their ambition&mdash;membership of
what they delude themselves is society."</p>

<p>Black Ked nodded. "Know anyone here?"</p>

<p>"Quite a few." The barrister did not hesitate in his reply.
"For instance, you came down the stairs with a lady I have the
honour to know slightly."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ashford-Lynne&mdash;poor little woman." Kedwell paused.
"It's rotten for a decent woman to be hard-pressed for money,
scraping all the time. A man shouldn't be allowed to marry unless
he can make some provision for his wife's future, if he pegs out
unexpectedly." Again the man paused. "Know her well?"</p>

<p>"Not very well." Dening had no intention of telling this man
of the woman's call on him that morning. But, had she told him?
They appeared to be intimate. Had she told him of her call at
Edward Symonds' offices the previous night? Of her relations to
the man's death? Lazily, he faced Kedwell.</p>

<p>"You didn't ask me here to discuss Mrs. Ashford-Lynne,
Kedwell," he said quietly. "And I don't believe you invited me
here in the hope that I would find the place and company
congenial. Then why?"</p>

<p>Kedwell flushed. He paused a moment before replying.</p>

<p>"I didn't." He stared at the barrister frankly. "If you want
the reason, I asked you to come here hoping to discover if you
had come to any conclusion regarding Matthew Ashcombe?"</p>

<p>"Slightly premature, aren't you?" the barrister laughed. "Last
night Edward Symonds was killed, almost on my doorstep. I spent
my time until quite a late hour this morning with the police." He
paused, then added: "You don't connect Symonds' death with the
Ashcombe matter?"</p>

<p>"Why? What do you mean?" The man was startled.</p>

<p>"Symonds was working for you&mdash;for the group of men I met
with you yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Symonds <i>had</i> been working for us," the night-club
proprietor corrected. "We had instructed him to stop his
investigations. We thought he was doing no good and really the
inquiry was only a matter of curiosity. Sir John paid his
bill."</p>

<p>"Yet when I was in Symonds' office last night I discovered
that he was still working on the Matthew Ashcombe affair. On his
desk was an operative's report dated the day before
yesterday."</p>

<p>Kedwell gazed at the barrister in amazement, half-rising from
his chair. A moment, and he sat back. Dening noticed that the
muscles of his face and hands were strained taut.</p>

<p>Why had these men feared Symonds continuing his investigations
on the Ashcombe case? Had the private inquiry agent stumbled on
something they feared might incriminate them? Dening thought
swiftly, coldly probing. To get the truth from this man he must
question fast and hard.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mrs. Ashford-Lynne knows something that may interest
us." His words were careless, but his eyes were keen. "She was in
Symonds' offices late last night, you know. I found her handbag
there and&mdash;and returned it this morning."</p>

<p>"You lie!" The man sprang to his feet, his voice hoarse with
passion, leaning tensely across the table. "You lie! Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne has nothing to do with men of Symonds' class."</p>

<p>"Yet he handled a case for her some years ago," the barrister
answered slowly. "On Symonds desk with the files of the Matthew
Ashcombe case lay the file of the Mrs. Ashford-Lynne case, dated
many years back."</p>

<p>Kedwell leaned back heavily in his chair, staring at the
barrister with wide, perplexed eyes. A moments pause and Dening
continued:</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;exactly why did you want me to come here to-night,
Kedwell? You said you wanted information from me. I do not
believe you. On the contrary, you want to give me information.
Isn't that so? Yes? Well, we will drop Mrs. Ashford-Lynne, for
the time. Now, what about those bank-notes Sir John sent to
Matthew Ashcombe&mdash;the notes that turned up here?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">TO Dening's surprise the man laughed.</p>

<p>"The bank-notes!" Kedwell chuckled, "So you think there's
something there?"</p>

<p>"You do," the barrister retorted. "Those bank-notes are the
reason back of your invitation."</p>

<p>For some moments the ex-boxer did not reply. He turned in his
chair, scanning the crowded room, beating on the table with his
fingers a tattoo to the rhythm the band was playing.</p>

<p>"You're no fool, Dening," he said at length. "How you guessed
that lot. For instance, I know that Reuben Gray followed you down
to your chambers last night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Followed me?" The barrister interrupted. "He was in my
chambers, awaiting me, when I arrived."</p>

<p>"Well, he went down to your chambers as soon as he could get
away from that old fraud McNiven. Then Symonds turned up." He
paused, turning to face Dening and speaking earnestly. "Say,
Dening, who killed Symonds? It lies between you and Gray."</p>

<p>"Thanks," the barrister answered drily. For the moment he was
tempted to voice a theory that had grown in his mind&mdash;a
theory essentially fantastic and without, at present, a single
fact to support it. He stifled the impulse, and shrugged.</p>

<p>"What about those bank-notes, Kedwell?"</p>

<p>"I'll get them." The man rose to his feet. "Queer you should
think I wanted to see you about them."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you let Symonds continue his inquiries?"</p>

<p>"Symonds was acting for Sir John McNiven and Gray&mdash;not
for me."</p>

<p>"He was acting for all of you," the barrister stated. "If you
did not trust Symonds&mdash;that is no reason for not trusting
me. You are forgetting Sir John McNiven sent for me and, of
course, I shall have to report to him."</p>

<p>"Sir John sent for you&mdash;yes." The ex-boxer grinned. "He
sent for you on my suggestion. None of them quite cottoned to the
idea, but I got it over."</p>

<p>He was turning from the table when Dening halted him.</p>

<p>"What exactly do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>For a moment the man paused, as if considering his answer.</p>

<p>"If remember right your parting words to us yesterday
afternoon were&mdash;" Kedwell turned and faced the barrister.
For a moment he hesitated, then quoted, slowly and distinctly:
"'If you really wish to know, I firmly believe that Matthew
Ashcombe is in this room at the present moment.'"</p>

<p>He swung on his heels and went to the stairs. On the first
step he paused a moment, then turned towards the alcove where
Mrs. Ashford-Lynne was sitting. For some minutes he talked
earnestly with her. Again he went to the stairs, mounting
them.</p>

<p>Much against his inclinations, Dening remained at his table.
He would have liked to have crossed the room to the opposite
alcove and questioned the woman. He was certain that she knew too
much, not only regarding Symonds' death, but concerning the
mysterious blackmailer, Matthew Ashcombe.</p>

<p>What did she know? How much of what she knew had she confided
to Sydney Kedwell? Certainly the man knew more than he was
willing to admit. He had shown that he held certain
knowledge&mdash;facts that he could only have learned from the
woman. But&mdash;had she taken him fully into her confidence?
Dening did not believe that Kedwell professed the utmost faith in
her. Could he have that if she had fully confided in him&mdash;if
she had revealed only the little the barrister knew of her past
life?</p>

<p>Kedwell was only absent a few minutes. He returned carrying a
leather satchel, which he placed on the table before Dening.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dening," the ex-boxer spoke seriously. "I am going to
admit that I believe, with you, that one of the men you met at
the Altona Trading Company is the man you want&mdash;is Matthew
Ashcombe. I've told you I forced them to place the inquiry in
your hands. I did; and I had to use a lot more pressure than you
can imagine to force them to agree."</p>

<p>Dening nodded inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I haven't anything more than a suspicion," the man continued,
resuming his chair at the table. "You may have theories or facts,
but I don't think you've got a definite line yet. But if you are
clever as I'm told you are&mdash;if you've got the nerve to
follow up your suspicions and uncover, that damned
blackmailer&mdash;and, incidentally get the information to tell
the police who killed Edward Symonds&mdash;then I'm behind you
for all I'm worth." He grinned. "You mayn't think much of that,
but I may he able to get information you can't."</p>

<p>"And that leads to&mdash;?" Dening, suggested.</p>

<p>"You think you've got something on some of us," Kedwell
continued. "You're suspecting Gray because Ashcombe gave his
address as Grays Manor; you're suspecting Sir John because that
old sniveller lives on that property; you're suspecting me
because these notes got in among my cash, and I can't explain
how." He hesitated a moment. "Mr. Dening, I'm told that in your
university days you were something of a boxer?"</p>

<p>The barrister nodded.</p>

<p>"Then you know that once a man's trod the ring he never quite
loses the tang of resin and canvas-dust. You're not in bad
training, now." The experienced eyes travelled over the
barrister's figure. "I can admit that I wouldn't like to go in
the ring against you as we are now, and that with all my
ring-craft&mdash;and it's that what tells, not boxing,
y'know."</p>

<p>"What's this leading to?" Dening questioned, half
laughing.</p>

<p>"Just this," the ex-boxer continued, "You've still got the
instinct to turn to the boxing page of the newspapers when
there's anything good on. I'd like to bet you've read a darned
sight more of Black Ked's boxing history than I have. Well, can
you say that Black Ked ever fought a mean or dishonest
fight?"</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second Dening hesitated. He knew the man's
ring career. Impulsively, his hand went across the table.</p>

<p>"Black Ked was a straight fighter," he said; "I'll take his
word that Sydney Kedwell, night-club proprietor, has not
done&mdash;will not do&mdash;anything to disgrace his
record."</p>

<p>For a minute the hands of the men locked. Kedwell sat down and
opened the satchel.</p>

<p>"Here's all the notes that came into the club that night. Take
the lot and examine them. There's quite a pack!"</p>

<p>With a nod the man turned and went to where Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne waited.</p>

<p>For a few moments Dening watched the man, then glanced down at
the pile of notes. Methodically he went through the pile,
oblivious of the glances of the dancers, curiously watching the
man sorting bank-notes. At the top were a number of notes
separated from the others by a folder of paper. He counted them;
there were nine. Eight of the notes were for five pounds each,
the ninth was for ten pounds.</p>

<p>He scanned the notes very carefully, finding the marks Sir
John had stated he had placed on the notes. Under the series
number had been drawn a very faint line with, a pencil. Only by
holding the bank-note against a strong light could the marking be
seen.</p>

<p>Three questions troubled Dening. First, why had the notes been
marked? Sir John had stated that the payment had been made for
services rendered. Had the marking of the notes been only
curiosity?</p>

<p>Then came the second question. Why had Sydney Kedwell examined
the night-club's receipts for the marked notes? Kedwell had
stated that Sir John had asked him to watch for the marked notes.
What reason had the knight for his suspicions? He had avoided
giving a reason for his request.</p>

<p>The third question arose out of Mick Regan's report on his
instructions that morning. He had instructed his man to discover
if the banks, generally, had been warned by Sir John, or his
bank, to watch for marked bank-notes. Mick had reported that the
banks had not been advised.</p>

<p>Again he went through the pile of notes, this time scanning
them through a strangely shaped monocle he screwed into his eye.
Now he separated out a number of other notes, placing them in a
separate pile.</p>

<p>Replacing the bulk of the bank-notes in the satchel, he turned
to the notes he had set aside. To the nine marked notes he added
two more. They, also, were marked. The remaining notes he
separated into a number of small piles, placing on the top of
each pile one or more of the marked notes.</p>

<p>"Well?" Dening looked up at Kedwell, who had come to the table
unobserved by him. "Find anything fresh?"</p>

<p>Dening pointed to the piles of notes on the table. The
ex-boxer sat down, and examined them, slowly. He lifted a marked
note from a pile and indicated the remainder:</p>

<p>"These are not marked?"</p>

<p>"No, yet I think they belong to my inquiry."</p>

<p>The ex-boxer lifted his brows, questioningly.</p>

<p>"They run in sequences to the marked notes," Dening
explained.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" Kedwell looked puzzled. "I don't see the
connection, Mr. Dening."</p>

<p>"Look through these." The barrister pushed the satchel of
notes across the table. "You may find one or two sequences of two
or three notes&mdash;not more than three notes in a sequence. In
one of the sequences&mdash;one of three notes&mdash;you will find
a note that has undergone different treatment from the other two.
I mean in folding and wear. I take that to indicate that those
notes came together by accident."</p>

<p>The barrister paused and drank a glass of wine.</p>

<p>"Now examine the sequences topped by the marked notes. For my
own convenience I have arranged the notes so that the marked
notes are on top of each pile. You will notice, however, that
several of the piles are in sequence. There are eleven marked
notes. Put the sequences together and you will only have seven
piles. Now examine the notes where the sequences break,
thus&mdash;" He drew two of the piles towards him. "Notice that
only a comparatively few notes are missing to make a further
sequence."</p>

<p>Dening paused and looked at his companion, who nodded.</p>

<p>"We know that a sum of five thousand pounds was sent to
Matthew Ashcombe," the barrister continued. "Through Sir John's
action in marking certain notes we have been able to reconstruct
sequences of the notes paid to Ashcombe. We have, in fact,
sufficient data to theorise that these unmarked notes were
abstracted from the packets of notes Sir John stated he
posted."</p>

<p>"Well?" Kedwell asked, impatiently, when Dening ceased
speaking. "I follow you so far. What then?"</p>

<p>"Gray come here often?" he asked indifferently.</p>

<p>"Quite frequently."</p>

<p>Again there was silence. Suddenly the barrister roused,
slipping his hand into his pocket and bringing out his note case.
From it he took some bank-notes and passed them across the table,
drawing towards him the notes he had selected from the
folder.</p>

<p>"I'll buy, Kedwell," he said lazily. "I want those notes."</p>

<p>For a moment the man hesitated, a look of wonder growing on
his face. He shifted his chair back from the table, at the same
time pushing away the barrister's money.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Dening. Think I can't trust you with a few
pounds?"</p>

<p>The barrister shook his head. "This is different. Those notes
have to be my absolute property. Now, I want you to answer a
couple of questions&mdash;on Black Ked's honour."</p>

<p>"Well?" The man looked across the table curiously.</p>

<p>"How did you come to look for the marked money in this club's
treasury?"</p>

<p>"Sir John warned me. I didn't think much of the idea, but I
kept my eyes open."</p>

<p>"Why should Sir John believe that the notes would be passed
here? He didn't advise the banks of the marked money."</p>

<p>"He didn't?" A puzzled frown came on the ex-boxer's face. "Yet
he warned me to have an eye on the cash at my place; told me he
was having enquiries made in the city."</p>

<p>"Enquiries in which the banks were ignored? Strange, isn't
that?"</p>

<p>Kedwell did not answer; he was staring down at the table
cloth, frowning.</p>

<p>"Well, here's my second question, Kedwell. Remember the night?
Yes? Well, remember the man who occupied a table by the wall
close to where a large blue vase with a piece out of the side
stands?" He paused, then spoke again in a changed tone. "Don't
get many people here asking for writing materials."</p>

<p>"They don't usually come here to conduct their
correspondence," the night club proprietor grinned. "Still,
sometimes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The man I want to trace did." Dening interjected. "Find me
the waiter who served that table, and those men."</p>

<p>As the man rose to his feet the barrister spoke again. "I
won't keep you in the dark. The man who asked for the writing
materials was Matthew Ashcombe."</p>

<p>For a moment Kedwell stood, staring down at his companion;
then, without a word turned and strode down the room. A few
minutes and he returned, followed by one of the waiters.</p>

<p>"Here's the man, Dening." The ex-champion boxer spoke quietly,
yet with obvious restraint. "Fraid you're mistaken, though."</p>

<p>Dening smiled as he turned to the waiter, repeating his
description of the incident on the night of the raid.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I waited there&mdash;remember the gent asking for
the notepaper, About ten minutes before the police came."</p>

<p>"Know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir. He's often here. Foreign gent, I've 'eard him called
Baron something."</p>

<p>"Baron?" Dening's eyebrows raised. "Baron von Rosenfeld?"</p>

<p>"That's the name." The man nodded quickly. "Knew I'd rekernise
it if I heard it. Told Mr. Kedwell so."</p>

<p>"Was he alone?" The barrister asked, after a moment's
thought.</p>

<p>"He 'ad another gent with 'im. One I knows better. That was
Sir John McNiven, yes sir."</p>

<p>"Who wrote the letter?" Kedwell interposed, his eyes
blazing.</p>

<p>"Dunno sir. I took 'im the paper and left 'em."</p>

<p>Slipping a coin across the table, Dening dismissed the man. He
looked up at Black Ked, standing beside the table frowning.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't here that night&mdash;I told you that before."</p>

<p>"Nor the night the notes were passed." Dening spoke sharply.
"You were here. What's the good of trying that trick?"</p>

<p>With a shrug the night club proprietor turned on his heel and
swung across the room, disappearing into the recess where Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne waited.</p>

<p>Dening watched him, a wry smile on his lips. He was well aware
that Black Ked had hated telling that lie. Then, what motive had
influenced him? He remembered that Reuben Gray had stated that he
had seen Kedwell at the club on the night that the marked
bank-notes had been passed. Gray had said that Mrs. Ashford-Lynne
had been with Kedwell. The barrister shrugged, staring
thoughtfully down the room.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, big boy." A small hand, heavily perfumed, settled
lightly on his shoulder. "It makes a girl's heart ache to see a
nice boy sitting sad and lonely. Come and dance, Charming."</p>

<p>Quickly, Dening caught the girl round the waist, swinging her
into the moving stream of dancers.</p>

<p>"What did she do to you, beautiful?" The girl, blonde, pert,
yet pretty, looked up into his face, laughing. "Say, handsome,
you're too young to mope over a girl. There's always plenty of
daisies unplucked in the field."</p>

<p>"Is that so&mdash;Daisy." He laughed down at her. "But this
time 'Daisy' plucked me. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>The girl laughed, snuggling closer into his arms. Suddenly the
barrister stiffened, swinging the girl so that his back was
towards the door. A few quick steps and he managed to find
shelter amid a throng of dancers.</p>

<p>He followed the progress of the man who had just entered the
room with his eyes. The girl, who had noted his sudden movements,
watched him curiously.</p>

<p>"Friend of yours, you adore&mdash;I don't think." She giggled
lightly. "Say, gorgeous, who dies if you two meet?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'll provide the central attraction at the
funeral." Dening laughed lightly. "But while you're with me,
we'll try to prevent a sudden demise."</p>

<p>Keeping well within the shelter of the throng of dancers, he
followed the man up the room. Outside the alcove where Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne and Kedwell were seated, the man paused; then
straightened his shoulders and entered.</p>

<p>The barrister steered the girl so that he passed slowly
outside the retreat. Kedwell and the woman were seated on
opposite sides of the table. Behind the woman's chair stood
Enrico Culadi, bending forward and speaking rapidly. Some
watching sense must have warned him that he was being observed,
for he straightened, looking directly at the opening.</p>

<p>For a brief moment the men's eyes met and held. A puzzled
expression passed over the gunman's face. He stared intently at
the barrister, frowning thoughtfully. Suddenly his face cleared;
an unholy light dawned in his eyes.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" the girl caught at Dening's arm,
frightened. "Boy, did you see that man's face? He looked as if
he'd like to eat you." Swinging her out of the throng, Dening
escorted the girl to his table and poured her out a drink.</p>

<p>"You want that." He laughed carelessly. "Girlie, you've been
keeping too many late hours. Your imagination's working
overtime."</p>

<p>Yet his eyes never left the recess where the gunman remained.
Instinctively his hand went to his hip pocket. He was unarmed,
and across the floor, gay with the unthinking, laughing throng,
lurked sudden death.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">SUDDEN death. Dening smiled to himself as he
secretly watched the alcove across the floor in which Culadi
remained. The momentary panic induced by the realisation that he
was facing an armed killer without a weapon, had abated. Now he
was considering his position; his keen brain was working at top
speed.</p>

<p>Would the Chicagoan force matters in that night club? He
believed not; unless the man could take him at a disadvantage,
and without witnesses; get him in some position where he could
make a clean getaway after the shooting. That he would have to
prevent.</p>

<p>For the time, the ability to think and act quickly were the
obvious weapons. The barrister laughed grimly. So long as the
duel between them was confined to tactical activity, he believed
he could keep the man guessing.</p>

<p>Culadi would realise that he was not in the States, where he
could rely on big support; where he and his gang had the police
and politicians in their pay, where graft would cover up almost
any cowardly deed. He was in England, and American gunmen feared
the incorruptibility of English law; the infallible tracking down
of the killer and the inevitable trial and punishment.</p>

<p>For the moment he must wait and watch; wait, as he knew the
Chicagoan was waiting, for events to shape themselves. Carelessly
smiling, he turned to the girl. She was staring at him with
great, troubled eyes. As she met his glance, she smiled; the
cloud sweeping from her face.</p>

<p>"Imagination, beautiful." She swung sideways in her chair,
crossing her silk-clad legs revealingly. "Not much imagination,
charming. What's that fellow got on you?"</p>

<p>For the moment the barrister hesitated. Could he trust this
girl? He considered, thoughtfully. If he could. A plan was
quickly forming in his mind.</p>

<p>"You know him?" A kick of her satin-shod foot indicated the
recess in which Culadi still lurked. She struck her hand on the
table angrily. "It's no good trying to fend me off. I know. I saw
his eyes when he caught sight of you. I was in your arms; I felt
your body stiffen. Lord, you don't think a girl like me is
entirely innocent. I live by my wits, and&mdash;and if I couldn't
read that tale plain, I'd starve."</p>

<p>Dening nodded. He recognised that the customary banter had
passed from the girl's tones; that she was deeply in earnest.
Yet, could he trust her?</p>

<p>"Daisy-" He leaned across the table.</p>

<p>She interrupted him impatiently. "Cut that." Her voice was
sharp, almost angry. "That's all right for the night club gigolo,
but&mdash;but you're different. I knew that directly I felt your
arm about my waist. I don't often make mistakes; but I'll confess
I did when I came to you. You looked careless, indifferent, as if
you wanted to be amused and would pay for it. I thought I'd amuse
you and make you pay for the experience. That's my business, you
know. Just the age-long battle between the male and the female,
and&mdash;" she laughed harshly, "And not often the male wins.
I'm Emily Dale&mdash;though they know me here as Eunice
O'Connor." Again she paused. "You call me Emily, see."</p>

<p>The barrister did not reply. His brain was working swiftly,
considering possibilities, accepting, rejecting and arranging
thoughts and ideas; placing possibilities in order; weighing
potentialities.</p>

<p>"Listen." The girl leaned forward earnestly. "When that man
comes on the floor again I'm going to him. I'll keep him busy."
She laughed, a hard note ringing through her merriment. "Oh, I'll
keep him awake, you bet. That's my business. Yours&mdash;you get
to that door, see. Get away from here and don't come back." Her
voice lowered to a whisper. "You&mdash;you don't belong here.
You're too good to mix with this trash."</p>

<p>"No." Dening spoke suddenly. "I can't have that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think that he can hurt&mdash;me?" Self scorn spoke in
her voice. "Lord, boy, I'm past that. What sort of innocent are
you, not to read the signs on me? I'm&mdash;I'm one of the
world's toys&mdash;the playthings of men&mdash;men like him."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Think I don't know? Sure. Like calls to like, all the world
over. Put me down in a town where I don't know a soul, and in
half a day I'll have a dozen round me, not men like you, but
men&mdash;creatures like him that I couldn't hurt if I tried."
Her eyes lit with excitement. "Now, beautiful, what's his
name?"</p>

<p>"Culadi. Enrico Culadi." The barrister spoke reluctantly,
under the urge of the girl's insistence.</p>

<p>"Sure, and is that all? Quite an elegant mouthful. Then En and
I are going to get together&mdash;some."</p>

<p>"You must not!" Dening spoke quickly and firmly.
"Girl&mdash;Emily&mdash;you can't play with that fire. He's
dangerous."</p>

<p>"So am I." the girl giggled; then sobered. "Gee, it was great
to hear you speak that name. It's quite a time since I've heard
it from honest lips." She mused a moment. "Perhaps that's why we
girls take high-sounding names. We've still got enough decency to
keep something sacred."</p>

<p>"Listen." The barrister spoke quickly. "You're to do nothing
foolish. Culadi is a noted Chicagoan gunman. Years ago he
promised to put a bullet in me, over some fancied
insult&mdash;because I foolishly, and openly, stated that the
best way to deal with him and his kind was to place them without
the law&mdash;outlaw them&mdash;and shoot them down at sight.
He'd think nothing of putting a bullet in you&mdash;if you got
between him and me."</p>

<p>"Well?" A queer little smile played in the girl's eyes,
around the corners of her set lips. "I'm not a&mdash;a&mdash;
gun-moll, don't they call them? That's it, a gun-moll; but
I'm&mdash;I can be dangerous."</p>

<p>"What's the good of playing the fool?" Dening spoke angrily.
"Look here&mdash;" He paused, his hand holding some folded
bank-notes under the shelter Of the table. No, she would be
offended if he offered her money. Quickly he changed his attack.
"Emily, did you ever work?"</p>

<p>"Work?" The girl laughed. "I did, once, now I work at
playing."</p>

<p>"Then work again to-night." He paused, continuing in a lower
tone. "Emily, I came here to-night for a certain purpose. I
didn't bring anyone to assist me because I thought that all
that was before me was a quiet talk with a friend. But now I want
assistance. Can you follow instructions&mdash;that is, act as one
of my staff?"</p>

<p>"You're a&mdash;" Incredulous suspicion flashed in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm a barrister, but barristers often have to go out after
information they want. They don't get it brought to them, always.
Now, will you act for me?"</p>

<p>She nodded; her eyes, wonderingly, on his face.</p>

<p>"Then, put that in your bag. No," he added, as she made a
motion to refuse the money. "You've got to live. I'm employing
you for this night, perhaps longer, and I pay those who work for
me."</p>

<p>"Well?" A moment and the hardness left her face; she smiled
charmingly.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to tackle Culadi; you've got to trail me.
Understand? Culadi will shoot, if he gets a chance to do it when
we are alone and there is a reasonable chance that the murder
cannot be pinned on to him. If you're about, then I'm not alone
and for the time he's&mdash;" He thought for a simile&mdash;"he's
stymied. Understand?"</p>

<p>"I'm your little shadow." The girl giggled lightly. "Now
what?"</p>

<p>"What goes on upstairs?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know?"</p>

<p>"I can guess. I'm guessing that when Culadi comes out of that
recess he'll go upstairs."</p>

<p>"He did yesterday."</p>

<p>"So? Then he's been here before?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>"When he goes upstairs, you're to tempt me up there. I mean
it," he added, noting the sudden clouding of her eyes. "It's all
right, Emily, I can take care of myself. I wouldn't ask anyone to
help me if I had a gun with me."</p>

<p>"You say he's a gunman?"</p>

<p>"I watched his trial for shooting two innocent men."</p>

<p>"Can you handle a gun?"</p>

<p>She laughed when Dening nodded. Bending, she drew up her dress
on one side, and from a small holster produced a miniature
automatic. For a moment she held it, open, on her palm, then
slipped it into his hand.</p>

<p>"That's not to say that I've resigned," she laughed again.
"Now, boy, we'll play Mr. Enrico Culadi for a sucker. You take
your line, I'll step in when the going's good."</p>

<p>Carelessly, insolently, she rose to her feet, glancing down at
the man with an open yawn, as if tired of his society. For a
moment her fingertips rested on the table, while her eyes went to
the alcove opposite. A small, provocative smile came on her
heavily painted lips. She took a step, and Dening's hand came
down on her fingers hard.</p>

<p>"Look! The door!" His voice was tense with excitement, though
his manner showed only indifference. "Emily, do you know that man
now entering."</p>

<p>"Sure." The girl exhibited the tired insolence of the
<i>demi-mondaine</i> at the insistence of the unwelcome male
"That's Rube Gray. Pot of money, almost as much time. Gee, he
makes a girl smile. Rube Gray, the gold digger."</p>

<p>"Gold digger?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Show a gold chain, a heavy metal bracelet, and he's on
your track like a bloodhound. I'll say he'll give you a good
price; for he makes us girls smile. Why, I've bought hundreds of
pounds of trinkets for him. We call him the pawnbroker of
Mayfair."</p>

<p>A quick twist and she released her fingers, moving gracefully
on to the crowded floor. A moment and she was in a man's arms,
fox-trotting down the floor as if she had not a care in the
world.</p>

<p>What had the girl meant? Reuben Gray, the idle society
lounger, a "gold digger?" Surely she was mistaken. Dening watched
the young man strolling languidly up the hall, carelessly
saluting friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p>Dening watched the young man keenly. Had the girl spoken the
truth? Had Reuben Gray, behind his carelessness and indifference,
behind his pose of idle man about town, a secret occupation.
Emily Dale had said that she and other girls had bought gold
ornaments for him, acted as his agents.</p>

<p>He gasped. Reuben Gray, the gold-buyer, was an associate of
the men who had required him to track down Matthew Ashcombe.
Could he find in that revelation something that would connect him
with their secret occupation?</p>

<p>Again his eyes went to where Reuben Gray had paused beside a
table of friends, close to the dancing floor. As he watched, the
young man moved on, up the hall. Now Dening saw that he was
accompanied by another man, and that man was Rudolph N.
Rudder.</p>

<p>The two men proceeded leisurely up the hall until they came to
the recess where Mrs. Ashford-Lynne and the two men sat. A
moment's pause, to speak to some friends at a nearby table, and
they entered.</p>

<p>Kedwell, Rudder and Gray. Three of the seven men he was
supposed to be working for; men against whom he held grave
suspicions. Gray had said that he and his associates were engaged
on secret work; work that while not exactly illegal, was highly
profitable.</p>

<p>The rum-runner king of America; an ex-boxer night club
proprietor, and a notorious gunman. What connection could there
be between them?</p>

<p>A thought sprang to insistence in his brain, but he put it
from him as improbable. Yet it persisted. He remembered a
paragraph he had read in a newspaper a few days before. What were
the words? A moment, and they rose before him, as if graven in
letters of fire.</p>

<p>He remembered the first paragraph of that article, almost word
for word. "Now Britain has a 'rum row,' a long scattered line of
foreign ships laden with liquor, tobacco and other dutiable
goods, lying beyond the three-mile limit, along the North Sea
coast."</p>

<p>Yes, he remembered every word of it.</p>

<p>Could that secret occupation, highly profitable, be smuggling?
That was possible. Had Rudder extended his sphere of liquor
smuggling to include Great Britain, as well as the United States?
Again words from the article burned his memory: "Liquor and
cigars are sold not only in the fishing villages, but also in
towns far inland, at prices below the British duty itself."</p>

<p>The idea was feasible. The smuggling of liquor into Great
Britain would appeal to the American rum-king. Smuggling was
considered by otherwise honest people "not exactly illegal," to
quote Gray's words. But, could he fit in Gray's reputed
occupation with smuggling?</p>

<p>A movement in the recess opposite caught his attention. He
stiffened, watching unobtrusively. A moment, and Kedwell and
Culadi came out of the recess. For a moment they waited at the
entrance, talking to those who remained, then turned and went to
the stairs.</p>

<p>Dening glanced over the dancing floor, looking for the girl. A
slight mocking whisper caught his ears. He turned sharply, to see
Emily Dale standing on the other side of him, partly concealed by
a large bank of greenery.</p>

<p>"Still alone, pretty boy." Her light, careless tones rang
through the riot of sound from the band. "I'm tired of dancing,
charming. Take me upstairs, There's more amusement there."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">"AMUSEMENT?" Dening laughed lightly. "Then why
not dance?"</p>

<p>"Is there nothing but jazz to quicken the senses?" The girl
moved into the light, glancing up at him carelessly; yet in her
eyes he read a warning.</p>

<p>For answer the barrister caught her in his arms and whirled
her on to the floor. A few moments and he bent his lips to her
ear. "Where?"</p>

<p>"Follow them." Emily Dale's eyes turned to where the two men
were ascending the stairs.</p>

<p>Deftly, Dening steered her through the careless throng of
dancers until they came to the foot of the stairway. There she
released herself, with an abrupt gesture.</p>

<p>"I'm tired." Her voice was high and irritable. "Dancing. God.
We dance, and dance, lulling our senses with the roll of
tom-toms, as if we were jungle niggers. Charming, I want
something exciting&mdash;" She turned with a laugh, running up a
few stairs; turning and holding out her hand "Come."</p>

<p>When he reached her she took his arm, urging him up the
stairs, laughing shrilly, talking loudly. Dening glanced upwards.
The men had arrived on the first floor and vanished from sight.
He quickened his steps. On the floor he could see nothing of
them.</p>

<p>Where had they gone to? For the moment he glanced down at the
girl, suspicion in his eyes; then laughed. Meekly he moved,
obedient to the pressure of her hand on his arm. She led him to
the left, along a wide corridor. A few yards and she paused
before a door.</p>

<p>"Ever gamble, charming?" she laughed up at him pertly. "Well,
don't let me get too close to the tables, or&mdash;" She
shrugged.</p>

<p>"They play up here?" Almost disappointment sounded in the
barrister's, tones. Had he followed Kedwell and Culadi up here,
to watch them at the tables? Again he glanced at the girl,
suspicion in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Innocent," she taunted. "Do you think that Black Ked makes
all his profits out of eats? Do you think that he has me and the
other girls for to partner men only; to dance with the fools; to
induce to order more and more food and wine?"</p>

<p>She laughed unrestrainedly. "Beautiful, how many men do you
think have led me up these stairs in the search for excitement,
perhaps in these rooms?" Her shrill laughter echoed through the
empty corridor. "Oh, no. There's nothing crooked about this
house. There are games, but as straight as they make them. But
are you innocent enough to believe that anyone is clever enough,
or lucky enough, or rich enough to beat the bank? Think again,
sweetheart."</p>

<p>"I didn't come up here to gamble." Dening spoke steadily. "You
know why I came."</p>

<p>Without answering, she flung open the door before which they
stood and led into the room.</p>

<p>A series of rooms, rather. Dening believed that the space had
been obtained by cutting two, or perhaps more, houses. Doorless
arches, heavily curtained, separated room from room. The place,
was crowded; loud with the shrill clatter of women and the deep
laughter of men. In each room was a long green baize covered
table, around which buzzed an excited throng. The barrister
glanced about him curiously. One thing he noticed, immediately.
On the walls before him, the walls he believed to be the outer
walls of the houses, not a window showed.</p>

<p>Quickly his eyes searched for Kedwell and Culadi. They were
not in the room in which he stood. He turned to pass through the
curtained doorway. Indifferently, the girl moved by his side,
talking inconsequently, loudly.</p>

<p>He came to the end of the room and paused. The men were not
there. He looked about him puzzled. He had not seen a window in
the rooms; not a door except the one through which he and Emily
had entered.</p>

<p>The room in which they now stood was not used for gambling;
there was no table in it. It was furnished as an ordinary lounge,
and at the moment was occupied by only one couple, sitting on a
table lounge in one of the corners. He glanced curiously at the
girl by his side. She strolled over to one of the lounges,
beckoning him to follow.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the girl looked up and caught Emily's eyes on
her. For a moment she waited, then sprang to her feet, dragging
up her companion with her. He protested, but the girl was
insistent; declaring that she wanted to play again.</p>

<p>Hardly had the couple passed through the screening doors when
Emily Dale was on her feet. For a moment she stood listening,
then moved to where a long, wide mirror stood against one of
the walls.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the experience, Miss Dale." Dening spoke evenly,
yet there was an angry note in his voice. "I told you I didn't
come up here to gamble, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl turned swiftly, a frown on her face. A smile, then a
little trilling laugh. Her fingers caught at the framework of the
mirror. It swung silently to one side, revealing a narrow
opening. Beckoning the barrister to pass through, the girl
followed; and behind her the mirror slid again into place.</p>

<p>They had passed into another room, a luxuriously furnished
bedroom; one which, from the evidences about, was in the
occupation of a woman. Leaving the barrister where he had
suddenly stayed, just within the doorway, Emily went to a big
wardrobe against the opposite wall. Again her fingers found a
spring. The massive furniture moved on hidden rollers, showing a
closed door.</p>

<p>For a moment the girl looked back, her fingers on her lips,
warning to silence. She bent to the panel of the door, then
straightened and beckoned Dening to her side. At the same time,
she touched a switch and the lights in the room were
extinguished. Now on the panel of the door Dening saw a pinpoint
of light. Yielding to the insistence of the girl's hand he bent,
applying his eye to the spy hole, to start back with a cry of
astonishment.</p>

<p>"How the dev&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl's fingers closed swiftly over his lips. "You fool. If
they find us here they'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Catching the girl's wrist Dening released himself. A slight
pat on the back of her hand reassured her that he had once more
command of himself. Again he bent to the spy-hole.</p>

<p>In the room beyond sat five persons around a table on which
stood a scatter of refreshments; yet they were neither drinking
nor eating. Again a little sigh of amazement rose to his lips.
How had they come there? He had seen Culadi and Kedwell leave the
dancing hall and come up the stairs. He thought that in the
alcove had remained Reuben Gray, Mrs. Ashford-Lynne and Rudder.
Yet of the five, four of them were now seated in the room he was
viewing, and with them was Sir John McNiven.</p>

<p>What was the secret of these people's movements? Why had not
Mrs. Ashford-Lynne and Gray followed the two men up the stairs?
How had they come to that room? Was there a secret route from the
alcove in the restaurant to that room?</p>

<p>If that was so, and he could not doubt the evidences of his
own eyes, then Kedwell's claim that he was not in the club on the
night the marked bank-notes were passed could be explained. Yes,
Kedwell had been in the club, Gray had sworn to that. The
ex-boxer had been on the premises, perhaps he had meant that.
Possibly he had been in these secret rooms with Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne; possibly he had forgotten that, for some brief
time he and the woman had gone down to the alcove for some
purpose. He had claimed not to have been at the club. Perhaps he
had meant by that, not in the public portions of the club, an
evasion designed to protect the woman.</p>

<p>What were those rooms? For a moment he glanced back at the
darkened bedroom in which he stood. Were these Kedwell's private
apartments? That was likely. But, this room was in the evident
occupation of a woman.</p>

<p>Again he turned to the little hole in the wall. The five
persons in the room were talking earnestly. He wished he could
overhear what they were discussing. From the intent look on the
woman's face the subject of the conference must be of absorbing
importance.</p>

<p>If he could only overhear a few words, sufficient to give him
a clue. He placed his ear to the panel of the door, to return
again to the spy hole with a shrug of impatience. He could not
hear a sound from within the room.</p>

<p>"Quick." The word was breathed softly in his ear. A firm hand
drew him from the door. In the darkness he saw the tiny pinpoint
of light on the panel suddenly vanish; he heard the soft slither
of the heavy wardrobe, falling into place again.</p>

<p>For the moment he almost shook the girl's hand from his arm,
to find the spring and roll the wardrobe from the door. Then he
realised that the girl had been right in her warning. During the
last seconds he had been spying into the room he had witnessed
unmistakable signs that the conference was about to end. His
muscles flexed, he allowed himself to be drawn across the room.
Again the mirror door swung from place and he found himself
stepping into the gambling house.</p>

<p>"Whose rooms are those?" In the brilliantly lighted room he
turned to the girl.</p>

<p>"Black Ked's," she laughed. With a quick motion she drew him
to one of the corners flanking the mirror, pressing him down on a
settee and seating herself beside him. "Oh, don't look so
surprised and shocked, beautiful. Black Ked's no angel, I can
assure you. Lots more human than you, angel child."</p>

<p>So the girl had taken him into Kedwell's private apartments in
the night club to watch a meeting of five persons, four of whom
had been in the alcove facing his table in the dance hall below.
The fifth, Sir John McNiven&mdash;</p>

<p>If he could only have heard what they were saying. Three of
the party were members of the group who were being blackmailed by
Matthew Ashcombe. Another of the party was a woman whom he had
come to believe knew much of the blackmailer&mdash;a woman who,
in past years, he had convicted of attempted blackmailing; who,
he believed, was at that moment receiving large cheques from the
men he had been asked to protect. Yet, if she was blackmailing
them, how came she to be associated with them, sharing their
conferences? For he could not doubt that the meeting he had
witnessed was intimately connected with their secret
activities.</p>

<p>Then, what part had Culadi, the Chicagoan gunman, with them?
There he was completely in the dark. He could not even guess.
Downstairs there had been five men, possibly six; for he had to
presume that Sir John had been in the club before he arrived. In
that room he had seen only five. Where was the sixth man, Rudder?
Was he still in the dancing hall?</p>

<p>Quickly he turned to the girl beside him, voicing in tense
words the suspicions that crowded his brain. Rudder was in the
restaurant, watching the table at which he had sat; waiting for
him to return to it from the dance he had started with this girl.
If that theory was correct, then Rudder would be growing
suspicious, for the dance had long since finished. And why had
the man remained there on watch, while the gunman had attended
the meeting in the upstairs room?</p>

<p>Emily nodded, her face paling slightly. For some time she sat
quiet, her brows puckered in thought. At length she rose to her
feet, turning to face him quickly. Dening made to rise, but she
stooped forward, her hands on his shoulder pressing him down. For
a moment he was puzzled, amazed; then behind her he saw the
mirror door silently open.</p>

<p>The girl was bending over him, her lips moving but no words
issuing from them. She moved slightly. Beyond her he saw the men
he had witnessed about the table in Kedwell's sitting room moving
carelessly towards the gaming rooms. Gray came first. In the room
he stopped and linked arms with Sir John McNiven, who followed
him through the opening. Then an interval and Culadi entered. He
waited at the door for Kedwell to join him.</p>

<p>Slowly the four men passed to the draped curtains. At the
opening Kedwell turned and glanced back to where Emily and Dening
were smiling ironically. The Chicagoan turned swiftly. For a
second he looked, mildly inquisitive, at the back of the girl.
Suddenly his eyes set and hardened.</p>

<p>Dening knew that concealment from the man was now no longer
possible. Putting the girl aside gently, he rose to his feet,
stepping lightly aside so that she would be in no danger should
the gunman determine to open hostilities. Instinctively his hand
sought his dinner jacket pocket, where rested the girl's small
automatic. His fingers closed around it; yet never for a moment
did his eyes leave Culadi's face.</p>

<p>Kedwell laid his hand on his companion's shoulder, speaking in
low rapid tones. The Chicagoan shook off the detaining hand and
took a single step forward. His shoulders sloped, his knees bent
slightly. In his eyes was death-glare of the killer.</p>

<p>The man's hands hung idly by his side. Yet Dening was not
deceived; he had heard too often of the almost incredible
rapidity with which the man could draw a hidden gun and fire. He
faced him, stolidly; watchful of every movement; tensed for
anything that might happen, his fingers on the automatic in his
pocket, its muzzle directed at the man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Culadi." A woman's voice spoke from almost behind Dening,
in soft even tones. "Mr. Culadi, I thought we were going
downstairs to dance."</p>

<p>Suddenly the Chicagoan laughed. His body relaxed. With a wide
grin he turned to where Mrs. Ashford-Lynne stood in the doorway,
small, dainty and wonderfully gowned.</p>

<p>"Sure." He drawled. "Dance? Why not?" His eyes travelled from
the woman again to Dening. Lithely, with the smooth, rippling
play of muscles of the wild jungle animal, he moved forward, his
hand outstretched.</p>

<p>"Jesse! And it's Rich&mdash;Mr. Dening. Five years since we
last met, Mr. Richard Dening, and I've waited."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER YVII</h2>

<p class="first">"FIVE years&mdash;waiting to meet you again,"
Culadi repeated, his lips curving in a cold smile. "You remember
me, Mr. Richard Dening?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember you&mdash;well." The barrister refused to see
the proffered hand. He turned to the girl beside him. "Miss Dale,
shall we see what amusement the rooms have to offer us?"</p>

<p>He offered her his arm, completely ignoring the gunman. For a
moment a flash of intense hatred illuminated the cold eyes, then
the lashes lowered over them. With a mocking bow Culadi stepped
aside for the man and girl to pass before him into the crowded
rooms. A low, ironical laugh came from the lips of the woman
standing before the mirror watching the tense little drama.</p>

<p>"My!" Emily whispered, as she and Dening passed from the room.
"Now you've done it, beautiful. If ever I've seen death, I did
when I watched that man."</p>

<p>Dening laughed, yet his heart was hammering at his ribs. Had
he been wise to throw down the challenge so openly to the
Chicagoan? Yet, what else could he have done? The man's
assumption of friendliness was obviously assumed. Culadi might
not be a coward the barrister believed he was but he was
discreet. He would not force matters to an open rupture before
witnesses.</p>

<p>The barrister turned to the girl, trying to interest her, to
take her thoughts from the scene she had just witnessed. He saw
her composure had been badly shaken. A few seconds, idly
wandering amid the tables, and he found her again normal.</p>

<p>In spite of his words, his careless manner, the barrister's
thoughts were racing with conjectures. If he could but find an
explanation of that scene he had witnessed in Kedwell's sitting
room? What had those men to discuss with, those outsiders that
had to be kept from the rest of the group? He was certain that he
had witnessed a meeting of one of the parties into which the
group of seven men had divided; parties antagonistic one to the
other.</p>

<p>He knew that in that group not one man trusted his associates;
that the seeds of disunion were so deeply rooted that it was only
a matter of time before there was an open rupture. Were Gray,
Kedwell, Rudder and Sir John of one party? Were they opposed to
the other three men&mdash;the three continental identities in the
association&mdash;von Rosenfeld, Letoit and Parota.</p>

<p>If he could get into that sitting room. When he had peered
through the spy hole in the door he had seen that the table was
covered with papers, that the refreshments had been pushed aside
to make room for them. If he could get into that room and examine
those papers, alone.</p>

<p>Plan after plan chased through his mind, mingled with the idle
thoughts he had summoned to amuse the girl. They stopped before
one of the tables. What game was being played, he neither knew
nor cared. He remembered that, fortunately for his purpose, he
had a fair sum of money on him. He pulled out his note case,
taking from it a wad of notes. A seat becoming vacant, he steered
the girl to it, placing the notes by her hand.</p>

<p>He saw the quick gambler-glitter in her eyes as they met his
momentarily. Her long fingers clutched at the notes, all her
attention centring on the game. He stood behind her chair,
watching, laughing when she lost, inciting her to further
speculation. Again and again she lost, and he replenished the
fund at her elbow. Once he glanced rapidly about the room.</p>

<p>Culadi and Mrs. Ashford-Lynne had disappeared, possibly
returning to the dancing hall. Kedwell and Sir John were playing
at an adjoining table, with Gray watching them. Not one of the
three was paying any attention to him.</p>

<p>Again he turned to Emily Dale. The girl was absorbed in the
game. He saw that her luck had now turned; the pile of winnings
beside her were rapidly growing. Quietly he stepped back from the
table, moving cautiously to the door of the room.</p>

<p>In the passage, outside the gambling room, he stopped. So far
as he knew the rooms contained only two doors, the door before
which he stood and the mirror door to Kedwell's apartments. Yet
he believed that the rooms contained many other doors. If not,
then the rooms were a trap if the police raided the
establishment. Certainly there were other, concealed, doors. But
who knew of them?</p>

<p>Would Kedwell remain at the tables, or go down to the
restaurant? At the moment he was playing, but&mdash;Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne was down in the restaurant. Dening knew that
Kedwell was mad about the woman. Would he remain up here, away
from her?</p>

<p>The barrister felt that, although he had been apparently free
and unwatched in the club, he was under constant espionage.
Kedwell would not let him wander about at his will. When the man
had come from his apartments he had seen him with Emily Dale.
Dening knew that the girl was, at heart, a rabid gambler.
Possibly Kedwell believed that so long as he remained in her
company his thoughts would be occupied. But if the ex-champion
boxer saw that the girl was playing alone, that he had left the
room?</p>

<p>Dening realised that if Kedwell knew that he had left the
rooms alone, he would be followed. Therefore he must act rapidly,
discover what he could, and again become the idle lounger
enjoying an evening in the company of a <i>demi-mondaine</i>.</p>

<p>Yet he must be certain that he was, for the moment, unwatched.
For minutes he leaned carelessly against the wall opposite the
gambling room door, intent on every person who emerged. A long
wait, and he determined that he was unwatched. Kedwell was
apparently engrossed in his game. He guessed that Emily Dale had
not yet missed him, that for the time being her whole thoughts
were wrapped in the fall of cards and the growing pile of
bank-notes beside her. He believed that he could trust the girl;
his one fear of the moment being that if she missed him she would
guess where he had gone and risk herself to join him.</p>

<p>He could wait no longer. Quickly he glanced down the long
passage. So far as he could see there was not a door in sight on
the left-hand side of the house, the rooms on which the gambling
rooms lay. Yet on that side was Kedwell's private room.</p>

<p>There must be a door. It was impossible to believe that all
five of the persons who had gone to Kedwell's sitting room had
passed through the gambling rooms. He knew that Gray and Margaret
Ashford-Lynne had not. The main stairway had been under his
constant observation all the time he had sat in the dancing hall.
They had not ascended it, yet he had not seen Sir John McNiven
ascend to the upper story? Was there another stairway, in some
other part of the house?</p>

<p>Very swiftly and silently he went down the passage in the
direction of Kedwell's apartments; carefully calculating space as
he proceeded. He came to the point where he believed the gambling
rooms ended and paused. Another fifteen paces and he again
halted. He was certain that on his left hand lay the room he
sought, but no door broke the smoothness of he wainscoting.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stiffened. Voices down the passage caused him to
turn sharply and press close to the wall. A group of men and
women were leaving the gambling rooms. One of them glanced along
the passage, and Dening pressed further back.</p>

<p>Something gave behind him, then resisted. He pressed back
strongly, feeling along the wainscoting with his fingers. Again
the pressure behind him relaxed. A door opened suddenly and he
almost fell into the room.</p>

<p>Chance had given him his desire. He had found the secret door
to Kedwell's sitting room. The lights were still burning, a
draught from a partly open window gently stirred the hangings. He
closed the door, taking care to secure it firmly. Then he went to
the windows, overlooking a narrow lane.</p>

<p>In the darkness he could see behind the house a short yard,
partly covered by a low building. He guessed that building to be
the kitchens of the night club. It was only a very short drop
from that window to the roof of the building. He flung up the
lower sash of the window, then returned to the door. He secured
this as best he could, there was neither bolt nor lock, only the
secret spring to hold it in place.</p>

<p>Again he turned to the room, looking about him curiously. The
table sill held the litter of refreshments, but the papers that
had been on it when the five persons had gathered around it in
consultation had disappeared.</p>

<p>He had expected that Kedwell would not leave any incriminating
papers about; yet he was certain that they still remained in the
room. Would he have time to search and discover them?</p>

<p>A man's sitting room, handsomely furnished, bearing many
evidences of its owner's ring career. On the walls were signed
photographs of many of the world's famous boxers; photographs, in
standing frames, littered the cabinets and tables. Of a safe
there was not a single sign.</p>

<p>Yet he was certain that the room contained a safe. Kedwell had
come up here to bring to the dancing room the marked bank-notes.
He might have another office in another part of the upper
storeys, but the barrister did not believe that. Psychologically,
the man would require to keep his valuables close to his hand.
Arrogant with his success in his ring riches, he would consider
that they could not be safer than under his immediate care.</p>

<p>Very methodically Dening searched the room, but without
success, opening cabinets and drawers in which papers might be
concealed. He came to a tall cabinet in one of the corners of the
room, beside the window. The door was hard to open. He tugged at
it sharply, and the whole piece of furniture came forward.</p>

<p>With a quickening of his pulse the barrister recognised that
the cabinet matched the moving wardrobe in the bedroom. He went
round the cabinet and found, in the wall, a large cavity. Drawing
a pencil torch from his pocket, he flashed the light into the
space, to draw back with a low cry of astonishment.</p>

<p>The floor of the cavity was tightly packed with gold
ornaments. Dening lent closer. Brooches, bracelets, rings,
watches, pins, ornaments of all kinds lay huddled together in
confusion. He lifted a bracelet close to his light; and again a
low whistle of astonishment came from his lips. Once that
bracelet had been heavily studded with gems. They had been
carefully removed from the setting. He wondered what had become
of them. Why had the jewels been so carefully removed and the
gold support carelessly thrown in that cavity?</p>

<p>He picked up a heavy hunter-cased watch, to find that the
works had been removed and that only the case remained. He delved
into the pile, to estimate that it lay several inches thick on
the floor of the cavity.</p>

<p>Almost he laughed at the absurdity of the find. Sir John
McNiven, Rudder and Kedwell were rich men. That evening he had
heard Gray described as wealthy. He believed that they were
obtaining their wealth by devious means; yet why should they
treat jewellery in that manner; treat it as some common thief
would treat the loot garnered through some burglary?</p>

<p>If he believed his eyes, then here lay the residue of gigantic
burglaries. At times he had seen the loot recovered by the police
from some apprehended burglar. Then he had noticed that the
jewellery had been treated in a similar manner; the jewels
extracted from their settings and packed in tins; the gold thrown
into some receptacle, haphazard, waiting the opportunity to be
melted into unrecognisable ingots.</p>

<p>Had he to believe that these men were common receivers of
stolen goods? That thought was absurd. Yet was it? Had he not
evidence to that end before his eyes?</p>

<p>A sound at the door brought him abruptly from his
speculations. He remembered the door from the bedroom; the sound
did not come from there. He stepped back across the room and
watched. The door from the passage was shaking. Someone was
trying to open it.</p>

<p>Silently he swung the cabinet into place and went to the
bedroom door. The key was in the lock. Turning it, he withdrew it
and opened the door. As the door from the passage gave way under
pressure, he entered the bedroom and drew the door shut behind
him, leaving it a fraction of an inch ajar so that he could see
as well as hear the newcomers.</p>

<p>A woman and man came into the line of view. The man was Anton
Letoit, and the woman Margaret Ashford-Lynne. Crossing the room,
as if in accustomed surroundings, the woman dropped wearily into
a lounge chair. Letoit drew one of the straight-backed chairs
from the table and seated himself.</p>

<p>"Well?" The woman spoke impatiently. "Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, madame." The financier bowed. "You have been
remarkably successful."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Mrs. Ashford-Lynne opened her bag and drew out a gold
case, extracting a cigarette. She leaned forward while Letoit
flicked his lighter and held it for her.</p>

<p>"I want some money." The woman spoke carelessly.</p>

<p>"I had the honour of giving madame a cheque the other
day."</p>

<p>"That's gone." Mrs. Ashford-Lynne laughed lightly. "My dear
man, do you think money lasts for ever?"</p>

<p>"Not in madame's fair hands." The financier bowed
ironically.</p>

<p>"I want two thousand pounds now." The woman took no notice of
Letoit's remark. "The balance in a week&mdash;not later."</p>

<p>Without a word the Frenchman took out his cheque book and tore
out a form. He filled it in and passed it to the woman. With a
glance at the writing she folded it and placed it in her bag.</p>

<p>"Really, my dear Anton, you are remarkably nice to do business
with." Languidly she rose from her seat. "I think I will go down
to the dancing floor again. That nice Mr. Culadi is waiting for
me. Really, he dances admirably, for an American."</p>

<p>"Culadi." A cloud passed over the Frenchman's face. "If I may
be so bold as to caution madame&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Caution?" Laughingly, the woman tiptoed up, patting the
bearded face. "Caution, my friend. Caution and I have long since
been strangers. Besides&mdash;" she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes?" Letoit looked at her questioningly.</p>

<p>"Sir John asked me to take charge of Culadi. He
fears&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" Again the Frenchman questioned impassively.</p>

<p>"That stupid, harmless barrister, Richard Dening." Margaret
Ashford-Lynne spoke impetuously. "Culadi has some old feud with
him. Sir John fears an open&mdash;yes, an open rupture."</p>

<p>Letoit frowned. "It was foolish to consult him."</p>

<p>"Remarkably," the woman laughed.</p>

<p>"Then why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Symonds was getting too active. That was the mistake."
Margaret Ashford-Lynne suddenly became serious. "In some way he
discovered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" There was urgency in the Frenchman's tones.</p>

<p>"Oh, Reuben was mad to insist that Sir John send for him when
that man, Ashcombe, forced his way into our business. We should
have had nothing to do with him."</p>

<p>"If Symonds was dangerous, he is so no longer." An unpleasant
smile flecked the bearded lips. "It was dangerous to call in this
Richard Dening. He is far more dangerous than Symonds would ever
have been."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" The woman faced Letoit in astonishment. "Didn't
you know Richard Dening was behind Edward Symonds all the time.
We only discovered that the other day. Richard Dening owns the
Symonds Inquiry Agency."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>." The Frenchman started back a pace, "In
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly Dening's attention was distracted from the scene in
the sitting room. He had heard a movement behind him. Someone was
in that darkened room with him. He stepped back a pace and
turned. At the same moment some heavy weapon crashed down on his
head. With a little sigh he fell to the floor insensible.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">THE city clocks were chiming the quarter to ten
when Ira Canning turned from the Embankment into the Temple on
her way to Fern Court. She was looking forward to her new
employment with interest. True, as she had told Richard Dening
the previous day, she was prepared to accept work of any kind, so
long as it was honest. This new work in the chambers of the young
barrister&mdash;a man whose name was being whispered through the
city for his uncanny ability to unravel deep
mysteries&mdash;showed signs of being interesting. More, she
liked what she had seen of her new employer. She had told him
that he was terribly direct, but she believed that directness was
coupled with a rare understanding.</p>

<p>Mick Regan opened the door to her summons with a quaint
old-fashioned knocker, a smiling welcome on his old wrinkled
face. He had driven her home the previous evening. On the journey
she had managed to win the approval of the man who thought little
of anyone except his old master's son.</p>

<p>"Desk's here, miss." Mick did the honours of the study. "I've
put it there, close to the window, so's you'll have the best
light there is. There ain't much in this court, best of
times."</p>

<p>Ira looked at her desk and the shining, new typewriter on its
separate stand beside it. Everything was new, but with a newness
that was demurely discreet; in no way spoiling the
picturesqueness of the old room and the quaint, antique furniture
and rare ornaments Richard Dening had gathered about him. She
glanced at the old man with increasing respect. When Dening had
said that Mick ran the chambers she had accepted the statement,
believing that he only fulfilled orders; now she thought
different.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dening in&mdash;" She turned and looked at the old man
with a smile. "Do you know, I hardly know what to call you. Mr.
Dening told me that you had adopted him. Will you adopt me also?
Then I can call you, as he does, Mick."</p>

<p>"Pleased, miss." The withered old face lit in a smile. "Then
you're Miss Ira and I'm Mick&mdash;" He hesitated a moment
"&mdash;and if there's anything I can do for you. I tries to do
the best I can for Master Richard, and there's times he says as
he couldn't get along without me."</p>

<p>Ira laughed. "I am afraid I shall be the same, Mick. You have
accomplished wonders here. It's a business room and&mdash;and yet
you have not spoilt the comfy air Mr. Dening managed to give
it."</p>

<p>Somehow Ira felt disappointed. She shook herself, mentally,
yet could hot keep the thought from her. She had expected Richard
Dening to welcome her on her first arrival. The place seemed
empty without him.</p>

<p>Seating herself at her desk she busied herself arranging her
few business and personal belongings in the drawers. Quietly, she
was watching the old man about the room. She noticed that he was
furtively watching her, and wondered.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mick?" She swung found on her chair,
deliberately businesslike. There was something worrying the old
man; it was better for her to take the initiative than to wait
for him to speak.</p>

<p>"Nothing, Miss Ira." For a few minutes he vigorously polished
a mirror that was already spotless. Suddenly he dropped his
duster, facing the girl. "It's Master Richard, miss. He hasn't
been home all night and his bed's not been slept in."</p>

<p>For a moment the girl stared, then laughed slightly; then bit
her lips in self-reproach when she saw the hurt look on his
wrinkled face. She went quickly across the room.</p>

<p>"Now, what really is the matter, Mick?"</p>

<p>"Master Richard doesn't do those sort of things, Miss Ira.
When I got home last night, after driving you to Brixton, I found
a note on the table, to call him at half-past seven this morning.
When I did, I found his bed empty. He hadn't been home all
night."</p>

<p>"He didn't say where he was going, in the note?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing, Miss Ira. I know he dressed for dinner, for his
day clothes were on the chairs. It's not like him, Miss Ira. If
he says a thing he means it; he always has, even when he was
quite a boy."</p>

<p>"You have no idea where he was dining?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Ira. Usually he dines at the club, when he's not
dining with friends or at home."</p>

<p>For a moment Ira stood undecided, then went to the telephone.
A few seconds and she was talking to the head steward at the
Karmel Club. Presently she replaced the receiver and turned to
the old man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dening dined at the Karmel Club." She hesitated. "The
head steward tells me that he was with three gentlemen, Mr.
Wainwright, Mr. Frederick Ford and Captain Mann. He thinks that
after dinner they went up to one of the card rooms. He is making
further enquiries and will try and discover what time Mr. Dening
left the club, and with whom."</p>

<p>"Captain Robert Mann might know, Miss Ira." Mick spoke
eagerly. "He's a great friend of Master Richard's, and lives at
the club."</p>

<p>Some sense, undefinable, urged Ira to humour the old man.
Certainly Richard Dening's absence was strange. He would not stay
at the club all night; if he had, the head steward would have
informed her. He had definitely inferred that the barrister had
left the club the previous evening. A little thrill of
apprehension tugged at her heart. Again she turned to the
telephone.</p>

<p>"Captain Mann says that Mr. Dening cut out of the bridge game
soon after eleven o'clock. He mentioned something about an
appointment at a night club." She swung round suddenly to face
the old man. "Mick, do you&mdash;do you think anything could have
happened to him?"</p>

<p>Mick Regan did not reply. He was standing idle in the middle
of the room, a worried frown on his face. Presently he turned and
without a word left the room. A few moments later he returned,
holding a crumpled large square envelope.</p>

<p>"There was this in his waste-paper basket this morning, Miss
Ira." He held the envelope out to her, back upwards. Across the
flap was embossed the title "Blue Heaven."</p>

<p>The Blue Heaven night club. To her mind flashed the words that
Dening had used on the drive back from Ewell. He had spoken of
the seven men who were being blackmailed by the man who had given
his address at the old ruin at Grays. She remembered the name of
one of the men&mdash;Dening had said that he was Black Ked, the
ex-champion boxer. He had stated that the man was now the owner
of several night clubs.</p>

<p>To her mind rose the vision of the man they had seen in the
old ruin&mdash;the man who had mysteriously disappeared; the man
who had come into the dining room of the King George Hotel at
Ewell. Dening had said that he was a noted Chicagoan gunman. She
remembered the barrister's account of the scene in the American
hotel lobby, and how the man had threatened his life.</p>

<p>A little thrill of terror shook her. Had Dening gone to the
night club and met that man? Had Culadi carried out the threat he
had made in America; and renewed through the post by means of the
silver bullets?</p>

<p>For some moments she sat, staring unseeingly at the old man.
Then, controlling her nerves with a strong effort, she recounted
all she could remember of that morning in and around Ewell.</p>

<p>"That's something." Mick nodded his head sagely. Peculiarly,
as her apprehensions grew the old man became calmer. "I'm
wondering the same as you, Miss Ira. I know the silver bullets."
He went to a cabinet and fetched an exquisite old Derby saucer.
On it lay two silver bullets.</p>

<p>Curiously, the girl picked them up. Then, under them she saw a
small card. On it were half a dozen words: "I'll bring the third
myself."</p>

<p>A sinister threat. Had Culadi brought over the third silver
bullet with him to England. She wondered. Again she bent over the
little tokens on her palm.</p>

<p>"Mick." She tried to steady her voice. "Do you know anything
about guns? Would&mdash;could these bullets be fired from a
revolver or automatic?"</p>

<p>The old man went to Dening's desk and opened a drawer. From it
he took an automatic and brought it to the girl's desk. Opening
the magazine he took out one of the cartridges and laid it on the
girl's palm beside the silver bullets. To her inexperienced eyes
they looked identical.</p>

<p>"Mick." Her words came with a sudden gasp. "Mick, could you
take out one of these leaden bullets and put in its place
a&mdash;silver bullet."</p>

<p>The old man nodded gloomily. For some moments there was a
silence, the girl pondering deeply.</p>

<p>"When I first met Mr. Dening," the girl shuddered at the
remembrance of the scene in the Symonds Inquiry Agency offices,
"he had with him a police officer. A&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector Lorrimer." The old man completed the girl's
sentence.</p>

<p>"Does he know, of this?"</p>

<p>"He was with Master Richard before he went to meet you
yesterday morning, Miss Ira."</p>

<p>Immediately the girl turned to the telephone and rang up New
Scotland Yard. In a few minutes she was talking to Lorrimer. He
listened in silence until Ira had concluded her account of the
search for Dening, then briefly instructed her to wait until he
arrived at the chambers.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the Chief Inspector entered the room.
Something about his brusque, matter of fact questioning dispelled
the girl's fears. She had read of Lorrimer, one of the most
prominent men at the Yard, a man often featured and pictured in
the newspapers for his wonderful success in the suppression of
crime. She knew that his abrupt, almost rude manner could soften
into an almost unbelievable gentleness. She remembered his
attention and sympathy towards her when she lay on the couch in
the inquiry agency offices, recovering from her long spell of
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>"Well, young lady?" The detective swung to face the girl.
"That all you know?"</p>

<p>"Regarding the Ashcombe case?" Ira questioned. "Yes." She
hesitated. "Mick has the idea that Mr. Dening talked the case
over with you. It is that American&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Culadi." Lorrimer nodded. "That's news as regards Mr. Dening;
but not as regards the man himself. We had news from New York,
some while ago, that Enrico Culadi proposed to pay us a visit."
He laughed grimly. "But these wild and woolly gunmen of America
usually leave their artillery at home when they come to London.
They've got what they call the Sullivan law over there; we don't
give ours a fancy name, but it's too mighty effective for even
their swell shots."</p>

<p>"Do you think this man, Culadi, recognised Mr. Dening?" Ira
asked after a pause.</p>

<p>"He might have." Lorrimer rose to his feet with a broad grin.
"But Mr. Dening's no fool with a gun himself. I
remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Dening left his gun at home last night, sir," interposed
Mick.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll trust that nothing's happened yet." The detective
had watched the colour fade from the girl's cheeks. "Now we've
got to get to work." He turned to the girl. "Miss Canning, you
lost your bag the other night. We have an idea that Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne has it. You've shown yourself remarkably sharp at
tracking Mr. Dening's movements this morning. Now, go and get
your bag back, and see what you can find out by a little discreet
questioning. I can tell you that the lady almost lives at the
Blue Heaven. Get that? Don't mention Mr. Dening or that you are
working for him, but press a bit on what you get from her. You
can hint a bit, say that there's been a rumour about that there
was trouble at the Blue Heaven night club last night, and so on.
Don't be afraid. I'll have you fully covered."</p>

<p>He turned to the telephone, ringing up the Yard. Gaining
connection with Sergeant Chambers, he gave orders for Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne's house to be watched, and also for a watch to be
set on the Blue Heaven. Replacing the receiver he turned to the
old man.</p>

<p>"Mick, scribble a line to Mr. Dening to tell him you are
working for me at present. Leave it on his desk, in case he
returns unexpectedly. Then get down to Arundel-street and keep
watch on Altona House and especially that bright beauty, Sir John
McNiven. Get on to the Yard every hour and telephone through a
report. Ask for Sergeant Chambers, and he will give you
instructions I may have for you." He turned to the girl. "That
applies to you, Miss Canning. Keep in touch with Sergeant
Chambers."</p>

<p>"If Sir John McNiven leaves Altona House, sir?" Mick
questioned, his eyes bright, his hand on the door knob, impatient
to be out on the quest.</p>

<p>"Follow him&mdash;to hell if he leads there." Lorrimer spoke
impetuously. "I've had my eye on that bird for quite a time. He
can bear a lot of watching."</p>

<p>"And you, Inspector?" Ira spoke briefly.</p>

<p>"I?" The man turned swiftly, a broad grin on his dark face.
"I'm going after Enrico Culadi. I mayn't be a magician with the
rod, like him and Mr. Dening, but, if I have to, I'll shoot first
and ask questions afterwards. I don't care to take risks with
those gentry, and I don't worry about giving them a square break.
I'm going to bring him in, at sight, on some charge or another.
Now, please. To work. I don't say that anything's happened to Mr.
Dening, but&mdash;" A shrug completed the sentence.</p>

<p>Ira carried her hat to one of the mirrors, her hands
trembling with excitement. Gladly she submitted herself to the
Chief Inspector's will. Almost she believed she was entering
adventure. If only she could be assured that nothing had happened
to&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Lorrimer." Mick had opened the door, a strange expectant
look on his face. "A gentleman to see Mr. Dening&mdash;a Mr.
Reuben Gray."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">A SLIGHT nod from the Chief Inspector and Mick
Regan stepped aside. Reuben Gray strolled carelessly into the
room. He looked curiously at the girl standing before the mirror,
and then nodded to Lorrimer.</p>

<p>"Dening out?" The words were careless; yet Ira thought there
was a puzzled note underlying them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dening didn't come home last night." Lorrimer answered
abruptly. "I was coming to see you this morning, Mr. Gray. I
believe you were one of the last to see Mr. Dening
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"To see Richard Dening?" For a moment the young man stared,
open-eyed at the Chief Inspector, then turned to a side table and
placed on it his hat and stick. "I did not see Richard Dening at
any time last night, Mr. Lorrimer."</p>

<p>"Not at the Blue Heaven night club?" The detective snapped the
question. "I know he was there. He left the Karmel Club soon
after eleven stating to friends that he had an appointment at the
night club. Peculiarly, from the moment he left the Karmel Club
all traces of him are missing." The police officer paused a
moment. "You were at the Blue Heaven Club last night, Mr.
Gray?"</p>

<p>A fraction of a second passed before the young man nodded.</p>

<p>"I was there, Chief Inspector, though how the devil you know
that I don't know. You gentlemen of Scotland Yard appear to be
keeping a very close watch on that place of late."</p>

<p>"Wants it, doesn't it?" Lorrimer smiled grimly. His shot in
the dark had brought results. During the investigations Ira
Canning had made that morning no mention of Reuben Gray had
occurred. "What time did you go to the Blue Heaven, Mr.
Gray?"</p>

<p>"Quite late&mdash;after midnight." The young man answered
easily. "I spent the evening with a friend, a Mr. Rudder. He said
that he had some business with Mr. Kedwell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Selling him bootleg for the club's use?" A wry smile played
on the Chief Inspector's lips. "I don't think Englishmen will
take kindly to that. Usually they're rather particular regarding
their spirits and wines."</p>

<p>Gray laughed. "The Blue Heaven is supposed to have the best
restaurant cellar in town," he answered.</p>

<p>"They'll have to take care of it, then." For a moment the
detective waited. When the young man did not speak, he added, "So
you were at the Blue Heaven night club last night and didn't see
Mr. Dening there?"</p>

<p>"What has happened to Richard Dening?" The young man
suddenly tensed. "You're sitting in his chair, uttering enigmas.
What's happened to him?"</p>

<p>"As I said, Mr. Dening went to dine at the Karmel Club. After
he had dined he cut into a game of bridge. About eleven he stated
that he had an appointment and left the game. He mentioned that
he was going to the Blue Heaven night club. From the moment he
left the Karmel Club he disappeared. He didn't return
home&mdash;nothing has been heard from him."</p>

<p>The police officer stated the case fully and openly; keenly
watching the young man from under heavy brows. There was
something about Reuben Gray that perplexed, annoyed, him.
Although less than thirty-six hours previously he had spoken to
him for the first time in his life, he knew the man by repute; he
had seen him in diverse places, some of them places he would
hardly have expected to find him, and wondered.</p>

<p>Now he witnessed him in a new character. The insouciance, the
blasé air of wearied indolence that formed the cloak under which
he moved through life had fallen from his shoulders. He had
changed to the keen, alert man of action&mdash;more, if Lorrimer
was any judge of his fellow men, a man of rare penetration.</p>

<p>Suddenly as the cloak had fallen from Reuben Gray, it was
resumed. Nonchalantly the young man drew to him a seat; lounging
negligently, with his long legs outstretched before him, flicking
at his knees with the gloves he carried in his left hand.</p>

<p>"So Richard Dening left the Karmel, for the Blue Heaven night
club?" The words came in a careless drawl&mdash;"and
disappeared." Gray looked up, a humorous twinkle in his eyes.
"Are you suggesting, Mr. Lorrimer, that Sydney Kedwell
is&mdash;is kidnapping our prominent citizens?"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector laughed, almost against his will. He was
certain that Reuben Gray knew something of the present mystery,
as well as that surrounding Edward Symonds' murder, but what? He
could not even hazard a guess. He determined that the man would
bear watching, and he should be watched, very strictly.</p>

<p>"So, friend Dening goes to the Blue Heaven and disappears."
Gray mused; while the Chief Inspector held silence. "I must mark
that on my remembrance tablets, Mr. Lorrimer." He looked up
guilelessly. "Do you think there is any danger for me? Shall I
cut out the shop&mdash;it'll be awkward, you know; so many of my
friends frequent the place. Would you like me to warn them?"</p>

<p>He stood up, erect and lithesome; faultlessly dressed; one of
the best-looking men of his set. His air was that of careless
ease, yet Lorrimer noticed that his muscles were tensed; his
whole frame held in repression, as if he were afraid of betraying
some secret thoughts. With a careless grace that irritated, yet
held the police officer's admiration, he turned to the table and
retrieved hat and stick.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I'll get along." The drawling words were almost
insolent. "If I come across Dening I'll tell him to trot along
home&mdash;that you're waiting for him. Any message for Sydney
Kedwell&mdash;Black Ked, y'know&mdash;Chief Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Not even a remembrance." Lorrimer nodded grimly. "More than
probable I'll look in and have a chat with that gentleman during
the day."</p>

<p>With a short nod, Gray turned to the door. Mick, who had
remained within the room, held it open. On the threshold the
young man turned and looked at the girl. From her, his eyes went
to the detective, keenly watching him. He shrugged slightly, and
passed from the room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lorrimer?" Ira spoke swiftly.</p>

<p>"Mrs Ashford-Lynne might take an idea of shopping this
morning, Miss Canning," the detective interrupted. He went to one
of the windows and stared down into the court.</p>

<p>The girl flushed. Without speaking she retrieved bag and
gloves and went quickly from the room. She wondered; had the
Chief Inspector tried to snub her. The thought made her hot.</p>

<p>Why had Reuben Gray come to Richard Dening's chambers? She did
not believe for one moment that he had not seen the barrister at
the night club. He had acknowledged that he had been there; it
had been proven that Dening had left the Karmel Club to go to the
Blue Heaven.</p>

<p>What had happened after he had arrived at the night club? She
was certain now that he had gone there. Why had not Lorrimer
asked Gray if Culadi had been at the night club that night? Why
had he talked so openly of what they had discovered, to the
man?</p>

<p>Question after question spun through her mind as she made her
way up to the Strand and caught a west-bound bus. At length,
puzzled and perplexed, she put speculation from her as fruitless.
She had work before her. She had to see Margaret Ashford-Lynne.
Ostensibly she was going to recover her handbag; secretly, to
discover what had happened at the Blue Heaven night club the
previous evening. That meant that she must ask questions. How
could she frame them?</p>

<p>Tiredly, she left the bus and walked along the familiar
streets to Lexington Gardens. She came at length to the house
where she had once worked. A strange maid opened the door, and
she smiled slightly as she gave her name. Mrs. Ashford-Lynne was
unlucky with her servants; few of them stayed long in her
employ.</p>

<p>A few seconds and the maid returned, nodding for her to follow
up to the familiar boudoir. At her entrance Margaret
Ashford-Lynne rose from a lounge, with a little cry of welcome;
effective to strangers, but Ira knew how utterly false.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Canning?"</p>

<p>For a moment the girl hesitated, recognising that she had not
thought to frame her questions in her mind. Somehow, there had
been a belief that the woman would welcome her with news of her
handbag&mdash;not the apparent denial that showed in eyes and
voice. Suddenly, she spoke. If this woman thought to bluff her,
she would make the challenge direct.</p>

<p>"I've called for my handbag, Mrs. Ashford-Lynne, please?"</p>

<p>"Your handbag?" The slightly-lifted eyebrows were expressive.
"Did you leave it here?"</p>

<p>"I understand you took it from Mr. Edward Symonds' offices,
the night before last," Ira smiled quietly.</p>

<p>"From Mr. Symonds' offices?" The woman frowned. "Why, I have
not been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shortly after half-past nine on the night before last," The
girl repeated, her lips firm. What was the woman trying to
conceal? "That night I had an appointment with Mr. Symonds; he
had sent for me, unexpectedly. My instructions were to enter by a
certain door. I went to that door and found the room in darkness.
As I entered&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, amazed at the grey pallor that spread over the
woman's face. Mrs. Ashford-Lynne staggered, putting, out her hand
to a small table nearby, to steady herself.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;It was you who&mdash;" The woman stared at Ira,
horrified.</p>

<p>"Yes. He had sent for me, told me to enter by a certain door.
I believe you were in that room, Mrs. Ashford-Lynne."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what did Edward Symonds want with you? Did he know
that you were once in my employ? No&mdash;" Mrs. Ashford-Lynne
paused quickly, pursing her lips, as if she realised that she had
said too much.</p>

<p>"Mr. Symonds wrote and offered me work." Ira repeated evenly.
Suddenly the distaste she had always had for this woman flooded
her. She spoke quickly, almost savagely. "I want my handbag, Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne. I know you have it. I had it with me when I
entered that room. Someone flung me aside and I struck the desk
and fainted. Mr. Dening and Chief Inspector Lorrimer found me.
When I asked for my bag it could not be found. They offered me
yours, instead."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have not your bag." The woman spoke with
effort.</p>

<p>"That is not true." The girl's answer was decisive.
"You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have never been to Mr. Symonds' offices." Margaret
Ashford-Lynne almost shouted the words; her lips pale beneath the
colouring.</p>

<p>For a moment Ira was silent, beating down the waves of anger
that surged over her. Why was this woman lying?</p>

<p>"Then, how did your bag come in that room?" Ira spoke when she
felt she had control of her voice. "I know you went to Mr.
Dening's chambers yesterday morning and that then he restored to
you your bag." She hesitated, then, with rising anger, continued: "Why do you not want to give me my bag? Have you lost it? If so,
why don't you tell me? Or, don't you want to give it back to me?
Do you want to steal&mdash;" She stopped, trying to fathom the
reasons for the woman's actions.</p>

<p>"Steal?"</p>

<p>"Yes, steal it." Ira spoke firmly. "Oh, I know quite a lot,
Mrs. Ashford-Lynne, and others know, also. Do you know that when
Mr. Dening restored your bag to you yesterday morning, he had
with him Chief Inspector Lorrimer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector Lorrimer&mdash;Oh!" Margaret Ashford-Lynne
gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes. Mr. Dening told me that he introduced him to you as 'Dr.
Watson.' Were you so simple as to believe that? Now, my bag,
please; or I shall make a complaint to the police."</p>

<p>"Police? How dare you?"</p>

<p>"Dare?" The girl laughed slightly. "Dare ask for my handbag?"
For a moment she paused, then advanced a step towards the woman.
"Mrs. Ashford-Lynne do you know your and my handbags are almost
exactly alike? Why do you want a second handbag&mdash;exactly
similar to the first?"</p>

<p>The girl's voice was full of significance. Margaret
Ashford-Lynne staggered, as if the words had been a blow. She
stared before her with wide, frightened eyes. Ira waited,
confident that she held command of the situation.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Ashford-Lynne?" She spoke ironically. Suddenly her
eyes lit on a bag lying on a chair close to where the woman had
reclined. "Why&mdash;" She went swiftly across the room. "This is
my bag." She made to open it.</p>

<p>"Don't touch that bag." The woman sprang forward, clutching at
the bag in the girl's hands. Ira easily evaded her rush. Somehow,
the clasp gave way as she swung it out of the woman's reach, and
a glittering cascade, of jewellery fell to the floor.</p>

<p>For a moment Ira stared at the mass of jewels at her feet. Her
eyes went to the interior of the bag. On the lining was a queer
little stain that she remembered making. It was her bag.</p>

<p>Again she glanced at the woman, kneeling on the carpet,
gathering up the fallen jewellery. Why had she denied possession
of the bag; denied it in the face of the almost overwhelming
proof? More, why had she stored that jewellery in the
bag&mdash;<i>her</i> bag?</p>

<p>The girl was frankly puzzled. What did it mean? Why had the
woman that mass of jewels? From long experience in the house she
knew every article of jewellery the woman possessed. They would
not make a heap a fraction of the size of this pile.</p>

<p>"This is my bag." Ira faced the woman stonily. "You said you
did not have it, and I find it here. But it is empty. What have
you done with my things?"</p>

<p>A moment and Margaret Ashford-Lynne looked up, terror in her
eyes. She pointed, dumbly, to a half-open drawer. Ira went to it.
In the drawer were the things her bag had contained that fateful
night. Quickly she restored them to the bag and turned again to
the woman, now rising unsteadily to her feet.</p>

<p>"I don't understand." The girl spoke slowly. "You denied
having my bag and I find it here. I find all that jewellery in
it&mdash;jewellery that I know does not belong to you." She
hesitated, to continue: "There is something very mysterious going
on I don't understand it at all, but I think Mr. Dening and Chief
Inspector Lorrimer may he able to find an explanation when I tell
them."</p>

<p>"Ira. You won't. For the love of heaven, you won't." Margaret
Ashford-Lynne spoke pleadingly. "Oh, say you won't."</p>

<p>"I will. I must." The girl hesitated. "Everything's so mixed
up, so peculiar, and I don't understand. But I&mdash;we've got to
understand somehow. There's Mr. Dening's disappearance. We know
he went to the Blue Heaven night club last night, but we don't
know what for. We've traced him there, and we can't find out that
he ever left the place&mdash;" She turned savagely on the woman.
"You know. I <i>know</i> you know. What happened to him there?
Was he killed&mdash;killed? Killed like Edward Symonds,
and&mdash;and you know all about it. Tell me, I <i>will</i>
know."</p>

<p>Shaken with fury, she advanced on the woman. For a moment
Margaret Ashford-Lynne stared at her in horrified terror; then
with a little sigh, sank to the floor insensible.</p>

<p>In sudden compunction, Ira bent over the woman. A moment, and
she saw that she had fainted. For a few seconds she stood
meditating. She glanced at the pile of jewellery. Should she
place it in her bag and take it to Chief Inspector Lorrimer He
would discover where it had come from; who were the rightful
owners. Slowly, she shook her head. What did it matter about the
jewellery? She had other work&mdash;she had to discover what had
happened to Richard Dening.</p>

<p>Another glance at the woman and she went across the room and
touched the bell. When the maid came she pointed to Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne. Together they raised the woman and laid her on the
couch.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I brought her bad news." Ira tried to make her
tones sympathetic. "But she is only in a faint. In quite a few
minutes she will be well again, but I cannot wait. Will you tell
her, from me, that I am sorry, and that I hope she will give up
this night club life? It is dangerous."</p>

<p>On the pavement outside the house Ira paused. She was
dissatisfied with herself; in some way she had muddled the quest
Chief Inspector Lorrimer had entrusted to her. Had she been too
abrupt. But the woman's lies and evasions had angered her.</p>

<p>Again she envisioned Mrs. Ashford-Lynne's face during her last
moments of consciousness. There had been stark terror shadowed
there. Why? Why had she fainted when asked what had happened to
Richard Dening at the Blue Heaven night club?</p>

<p>Abruptly she turned and walked down the road. At the corner
she stopped outside a teashop and looked down at the two bags in
her hand. She could not go through the streets like that. She
must do something with one of the bags. In that teashop they knew
her well. She would leave one of them there. They would not think
it strange.</p>

<p>Entering the shop she asked for the telephone. Obtaining
connection with New Scotland Yard she asked for Sergeant
Chambers. In a few moments she heard his voice on the wire. She
gave her name.</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector Lorrimer is out at the moment, Miss Canning,"
the sergeant reported. "Will you give me a message?"</p>

<p>Briefly, yet carefully, Ira reported everything that had
happened in Margaret Ashford-Lynne's boudoir; repeating, so far
as she could remember, the actual words used.</p>

<p>"Excellent, Miss Canning." She could hear the sergeant's
little chortle on the wire. "Put the wind up the lady, eh? I'll
have inquiries about that jewellery made at once, and I'll give
your report to the Chief Inspector directly he returns. What do
you propose to do now? Go back to Fern Court?"</p>

<p>For a moment Ira hesitated. Was her share of the adventure to
end so tamely, with a return to Richard Dening's chambers, and
the interminable hours spent waiting for him to return, or to
learn news of his fate? No, she could not do that.</p>

<p>A sudden urge came on her. For the moment there was no one to
control her actions, no one from whom she had to take orders. So
far, she had blundered. She had not obtained the information the
Chief Inspector required. Could she retrieve the mistake her
impetuousness had caused? Quickly she turned to the
telephone.</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant Chambers. No, I shall not go back to Fern Court.
I shall go to Ewell&mdash;to Grays. To the old ruined manor
house."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="first">FOR moments Ira stood before the telephone
instrument, still holding the receiver to her ear; yet not
listening to the words that came over the wire. Her brain was
racing with thoughts and resolves; thoughts that had not been in
her mind when she entered the tea shop.</p>

<p>Dimly she could hear the detective sergeant, at the other end
of the wire, expostulating, commanding and cajoling, pleading,
and threatening her with the wrath of the Chief Inspector when he
learned what she proposed to do&mdash;and smiled.</p>

<p>What did Lorrimer's anger matter? Before he could get to her
she would be far away, speeding on the quest that had suddenly
dawned in her mind. She dropped the receiver on its hook, cutting
short one of the sergeant's most flowery periods, and shrugged.
These men. They would wait, and wait; scheme and plan, and all
the time Richard Dening was in the power of his enemies,
and&mdash;God knows what might happen.</p>

<p>Richard Dening had fallen into the power of the gang he had
set out to expose. She knew that now; she had read the truth in
Margaret Ashford-Lynne's face, in the sudden access of terror
that had swept the woman when she had faced the question of what
had happened to Richard Dening at the Blue Heaven night club.</p>

<p>What had happened there? She could only guess, with no clue to guide her. She knew that Dening had gone to the Blue Heaven
from the Karmel Club. She was quite certain that he had not left
the building in Wyche Street. He had not returned to his
chambers. Then, where had he gone? No, what had happened to
him?</p>

<p>Thoughts chasing tumultuously through her brain, she went to a
table and sat down, ordering tea. For a time she leaned her chin
on her hand, abandoning herself to theories and speculations.
When the meal was served she put thought from her resolutely.
While she ate and drank she opened both bags and sorted the
contents. Instinctively, she filled the bag Richard Dening had
given her during those few happy hours at Ewell. The other she
closed and, taking it to the counter, asked the girl in charge to
take care of it for her. She returned to her table and finished
her tea. It strengthened and steadied her.</p>

<p>For some moments she sat, thinking quietly. She conned over
the events in Dening's chambers that morning, remembering each
step she had taken while tracing his movements from the time he
had arrived at the Karmel Club. In her mind she saw him leave the
club. He would stand on the pavement while the porter obtained a
taxi. He entered it, giving the address of the night club.
Mentally, she watched him arrive at the club door, and then a
blank. What had happened after Richard Dening had set foot in the
club? Could she reconstruct that from what he had told her the
previous day? Again she strained her memory, trying to recall his
lightest word&mdash;to string what he had told her into a
connected story.</p>

<p>And through the facts, as they marshalled through her brain,
showed one fact&mdash;the face of the man she had seen entering
the dining room of the old-fashioned inn at which they had
lunched, the face of the man Dening had told her was Enrico
Culadi, crook and murderer; the infamous Chicagoan gunman.</p>

<p>Had Culadi been at the Blue Heaven night club the previous
night? Almost she was tempted to go to the club and find out; to
ask for Sydney Kedwell, the proprietor, and demand Richard
Dening at his hands. But the man would deny her story. She could
not bluff him as she had Margaret Ashford-Lynne. He might admit
that Dening had been at the club the previous evening, it would
be dangerous for him to deny that in face of the knowledge she
and the police held, but he would declare that Dening had left
the club free and unhampered. Ira knew that would be a lie. She
was certain that Dening had never left the night club
voluntarily. She believed that there he had discovered something
vital&mdash;that his enemies had come upon him at the moment of
that discovery and had stricken him down. A shudder shook her
slender frame.</p>

<p>If they had captured him. They had, she was sure of that. Then
they would not keep him in that place. They would realise that he
would be missed the following morning; that the police would be
informed; that they would come to the night club.</p>

<p>No, they would not hold Dening at the night club. That would
not be safe. Then, where would they take him? To her mind rose
the vision of the man she had seen stealing through the old
ruins; the archway in the corner of the great hall, framing the
deeper darkness beyond. The flight of steps and the locked door
at their foot, of which Richard Dening had told her.</p>

<p>Behind that locked door. Then her impulse had been right.
Dening had been taken from the night club to Grays Manor. She
closed her eyes, and the vision of him in the cold, dank cellars
of the ruins rose before them. He was there, bound, helpless,
perhaps insensible.</p>

<p>She started from her seat, knocking over the table. Why was
she sitting there when he was in that terrible place, a prisoner
to those awful men? If Culadi held him. Again she saw the two
silver bullets resting on her palm; she heard her voice asking
the old servant if they could be fired from an automatic.</p>

<p>Outside the tea shop she hailed a passing taxi, directing the
man to drive in haste to Waterloo Station. If she could get a
train at once. She couldn't wait; she must get to the
ruin&mdash;to that hidden locked cellar, without delay.</p>

<p>Stamping angrily on the floor of the car, she drove her nerves
under control. She must think&mdash;think and plan. She could not
rush into the country without some plan. But, what plan could she
form, on the few facts that she knew? What did she
know&mdash;only that Richard Dening was in danger and calling.
Yes, she could hear his voice calling her to help him.</p>

<p>The car drew up with a jerk, and the man flung open the door.
Ira jumped but, almost into the arms of a waiting porter.
Impetuously she thrust some money into the man's hand, turning
impatiently to the porter.</p>

<p>"When is the next train to Ewell?"</p>

<p>"Ten minutes, miss." The man glanced curiously at her; flushed
with the race of emotion that had possessed her since she had
left the house in Lexington Gardens. "You'll do it just
right."</p>

<p>Was the man a prophet? She laughed as she sped through the
station, gathering a ticket at the booking office, a magazine at
the bookstall. Would she "do it just right?" She prayed that she
would.</p>

<p>In the railway carriage she opened the magazine, for some
moments staring at the pages unseeingly. With a little hysterical
laugh she recognised that she had picked up one of the many
detective story magazines. Could the writers of those stories
match the one she was playing a real part in?</p>

<p>What would Chief Inspector Lorrimer say when Sergeant Chambers
told him that she had gone to Ewell? Again she laughed. She could
picture the sudden flash in those cold, dark eyes deep-set in the
keen saturnine face; eyes that she had seen blaze to sudden
excitement.</p>

<p>All too slowly the minutes passed. Station succeeded station
as the train crawled through the countryside. Again she stamped
on the floor, biting her lips, trying to hold herself in thrall
against the consuming impatience that possessed her. Oh, why had
she come by train? Why had she not found a car? To her memory
came the swift speeding through the lanes the previous afternoon;
with Richard Dening by her side&mdash;and a warm sense of
protection swept over her.</p>

<p>She was going to him. Already she was far on her way, and she
was only guessing where he was; she had no plans for his rescue,
if he lay helpless in that old ruin.</p>

<p>Ewell! She sprang to the platform before the train came to
rest and ran to the barrier. Ten seconds later she was on the
road. Yes, there was a taxi. She ran to it and wrenched open the
door.</p>

<p>"Where to, Miss?" The man looked at her in mild astonishment,
as she lay back on the cushions, too exhausted by her rush from
the train&mdash;from the pulsing emotions of her heart&mdash;to
speak.</p>

<p>Almost she answered "To Grays Manor," then caught her breath
abruptly. That would not do. The man knew the place was a ruin;
that no one lived there. He would be suspicious, possibly watch
and comment on her movements to his mates, when he returned to
the town.</p>

<p>"To Upton Lodge, Sir John McNiven's place." The words came
involuntarily to her lips. As the car moved forward she nodded.
Yes, that would do. She would drive towards Sir John McNiven's
house.</p>

<p>She sat back in the car, watching the countryside; remembering
the landmarks she had noted the previous afternoon, when she
travelled that road with Richard Dening. She was feeling calmer
now, more composed with every yard she drew nearer her goal.
Could she take that for an augury that she was right? In London
she had been anxious, distrait, agitated. Here&mdash;</p>

<p>The belts of trees closed in on either side of the road. Ira
leaned forward. A few moments and she would pass the wrecked
gates of Grays Manor. The car sped on. There was but another half
mile between her and Upton Lodge. She must act quickly.</p>

<p>Unless she stayed him, the driver would turn in at the gates
and stop before the door of the house. Servants would come,
wondering who was the unexpected caller. What could she say, what
explanation could she make, that would permit her to go back to
the old Manor House alone? She tapped sharply on the glass and
the man turned his head.</p>

<p>"Stop, please." The man looked at her wonderingly.</p>

<p>Ira opened the door and stepped down to the road. Quietly, as
if long accustomed to alighting from a public vehicle on a long
stretch of country road, without a house in sight, she paid the
man.</p>

<p>"There is no need to say where I stopped when you get back to
town." she told him. Then, why not the truth? It could not hurt
her. She lowered her voice. "I'm making some investigations and I
don't want it known that I am down here."</p>

<p>The man's, face lighted.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye." He grinned broadly. "Heard there was something
funny up, about here. Sam Cherry, one of the postmen, told me
that they were inquiring about some fellow who was supposed to
live at the old manor." He paused, considering. "Lonely for you
out here. Like me to hang about for a bit?"</p>

<p>For a second Ira hesitated, She would like to have him near.
He looked&mdash;he was honest, and, she acknowledged it,
candidly, she was terribly afraid.</p>

<p>The man, yes, but not the car. That would be too conspicuous
in that long lonely country road. But, she could not separate the
man from his vehicle. There was nowhere he could hide it. She
shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, I think not." Yet there was indecision in her voice. "I
want to be about here alone, but&mdash;" She hesitated. "Will you
come back for me?" Again she opened her purse. "See, I will pay
you to come out here again; in case I cannot meet you. Come here
and wait, blowing your horn at intervals&mdash;a double hoot. Do
you understand? Then&mdash;" She spoke with sudden resolution.
"If I do not come to you, go up to Upton Lodge and ask for me
there, Miss Canning, and tell Sir John that I came down here to
find Mr. Richard Dening, and that I instructed you to go to the
police if you did not find me here."</p>

<p>Now she had burned her boats behind her. On her journey to
Grays she had wondered if she had not spoken too freely to
Margaret Ashford-Lynne. She had been haunted by the fear that
when the woman recovered consciousness she would tell her
confederates of her words. They would know that she was searching
for Richard Dening. If Culadi had recognised him in the Ewell
hotel he would remember her, when Margaret Ashford-Lynne
described her. Then they would come to Grays.</p>

<p>"Right, missie." The man started the engine. "I'll be here,
sure. If I don't find you I'll drive to Sir John's and give him
your message." He paused, considering a moment. "What about me
having a word with Abel Parker, miss. He's constable at Grays, I
couldn't say he's as clever as he thinks he is, but the uniform's
always useful, if the man inside of it ain't."</p>

<p>Ira shook her head. She stood by the side of the road and
watched the man turn the car; followed it with her eyes until it
disappeared over the little rise on the road to Grays.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, she felt lonely, very, very lonely.
About her was only tall timber, with the white ribbon of road
stretching through the duskiness under the shadowing trees. She
walked after the car a few yards, until she came to the gap in
the hedge through which Dening had passed the previous
day&mdash;and hesitated.</p>

<p>Under the trees, beyond the gap, it was fearsomely mysterious
and lonely. For seconds she hesitated, gathering her courage,
then scrambled through the gap and stood, supporting herself
against a tree trunk; one hand pressed to her fast-heating
heart.</p>

<p>Presently the very silence of the bush gave her courage. A
tiny thought hammered at the back of her mind. Somewhere before
her was Richard Dening, perhaps a prisoner, bound, possibly
tortured. For the moment the thought that they had killed him
recurred, but she put it from her resolutely. She must not think
of that. He was a prisoner&mdash;a prisoner.</p>

<p>Cautiously she made her way between the trees, in the
direction of the ruin. She came to a rough clearing, where once
had been gardens, and paused, scanning the place on all sides.
There was no one about. Waiting a moment to gather her courage,
she sped to the house, gaining the shelter of the walls.</p>

<p>She waited, listening intently. Not a sound broke the
stillness of the afternoon. There were only the twittering of the
birds in the branches overhead, the soft rustles of the bush
creatures on the ground. She came to the door and pushed it open.
The passage beyond looked dark and forbidding, but she entered,
stepping as silently as she could.</p>

<p>Very carefully Ira explored the offices and ground floor of
the ruin. She crept some way up the big stone stairway, but
feared to venture too far amid the wilderness of broken floors
and rafters that now composed the upper portions of the house. In
the hall again, she went to the narrow arched door&mdash;through
which she had seen the man disappear and, after a short
hesitation, felt her way down the steps until she came to the
stout, wooden door Richard Dening had described to her. It was
still fastened. Almost she hammered on it in her frenzy of
despair. Beyond that door, she was certain, lay Richard Dening, a
prisoner.She climbed to the great hall again, wandering about it
despondently. What a fool she had been to come there alone. As if
she, by herself, could prevail against these men. At the first
obstacle she had to turn back defeated.</p>

<p>A small pile of stones, apparently some portion of the walls
of the ruin, had been thrown into a corner of the hall. Ira
dropped on the offered seat gratefully. What should she do?
Should she go to Grays and find the constable? What had the taxi
driver named him? Ah, she remembered, Abel Parker. But, what use
could he be to her? The taxi man's description of the constable
had not been enticing.</p>

<p>Steps outside the building brought momentary panic to her
heart. Someone was ascending the stairs from the basement. A
man's form loomed in the dusk of the building. Another man
followed him. Ira's hand went to her heart. They would see her.
She would be a prisoner, all her fine theories of rescuing
Richard Dening fading into the fact of being a prisoner beside
him.</p>

<p>Then she realised that she had not been seen; she was sitting
on a level with the doorway and was now behind them, as they
passed into the hall, talking in low tones. She watched them
fearfully.</p>

<p>A moment and they turned to the head of the stairs. Waiting
until they had passed out of sight, she sped to the archway. She
could hear them fumbling at the door below. Suddenly a voice was
raised.</p>

<p>"That's settled, then. The <i>Diana</i> sails for St. Pierre
to-night, and he goes with her. You'd better bring the car about
dusk. That'll give you plenty of time to get to&mdash;"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">THE man's voice trailed into indistinctness;
then followed the slight slam of a door being closed, and
silence. Cautiously, Ira crept to the head of the steps, peering
down into the darkness. She could see nothing, not a single
glimmer of light. Fearfully she crept down the stairs.</p>

<p>She came to the door and felt over its surface. There was no
key in the lock, and the door was fastened. She knelt and tried
to peer under the door. So far as she could see there was no
light beyond. Careless of the light dress she wore, she sat down
on the dusty steps to consider.</p>

<p>The man had said that the ship, the <i>Diana</i>, sailed for
St. Pierre that night. From where? She almost cried with vexation
that some movement by the speaker had cut her from his last
words. If only she knew where that ship lay.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in her mind now. Richard Dening lay in
the cellars of Grays Manor, a prisoner. He was to be taken from
there at dusk, to a ship sailing for St. Pierre.</p>

<p>Ira remembered that Richard Dening had mentioned the island
the previous day. He had said that it was the headquarters of
Rudolph Rudder's illicit trade with the United States, that there
he stored the huge supplies of liquor he brought from Europe,
until sale and opportunity permitted him to get it past the
watchful Customs agents. Then&mdash;Ira paused and wondered. Was
one of the two men who had passed down those stairs Rudolph N.
Rudder?</p>

<p>For the moment she thought of trudging into Grays and
telephoning Chief Inspector Lorrimer, bidding him come to Grays
with a strong force of police. He could get there under a couple
of hours. She peered down at her watch. There was ample time
before dusk. It was just past three o'clock.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;there was hesitation in her mind regarding appealing
to the detective. He would rate her for running off to Grays
alone; she guessed that he could be very fearsome when angry.
But, could she have done otherwise? She had known that Richard
Dening was a prisoner of these men, and she had to get him from
their hands at once. Lorrimer would have questioned, asked for
proofs she could not give. Time would have been wasted, and,
perhaps, when they eventually arrived at Grays, Richard Dening
might have been on his way to the coast.</p>

<p>Ira was certain that she had taken the right course. Men were
not always right, although they liked to think so. They boasted
that they relied on reason, supported by facts. They were afraid
to guess, to rely on their intuition, as a woman did&mdash;stake
all on the subtle instinct that told them when they were on the
right road. Women&mdash;she had been right. Something had told
her that Richard Dening was at Grays Manor, and she had come to
him.</p>

<p>Richard Dening was in the cellars behind that door. And, with
him were Rudolph Rudder and another man. Was that second man
Culadi? A shiver of apprehension shook her. Although she had only
seen the man once, had never looked into his eyes, she feared him
intensely.</p>

<p>Ira laughed suddenly. A vision of herself seated outside that
locked door came to her mind. The three men were locked behind
that door, prisoners. One of the three she wanted, terribly, to
release; the other two to hold.</p>

<p>Could she keep them prisoners? No, that would not do. Could
she find a means to frighten, stampede these men? If she could,
if she could cause them to run from those cellars in sudden
terror, leave the door unlocked long enough for her to get in and
release Richard Dening. But how could one lone woman induce
terror in two hardened crooks? Yet&mdash; was there&mdash;could
there be a way?</p>

<p>For long minutes the girl sat on the step, pondering. She had
not a gun with her; if she had, she would not have known how to
use it. She had not even a light torch. In her bag was a small
folder of matches. Suddenly Ira looked at the wood door. A
weapon. A silent smile curved her lips. Fire was a weapon, and
she had matches. That door before her was of wood, and wood would
burn. She laughed outright, then sobered suddenly. Those men, for
them she cared nothing but Richard Dening was beyond that
door.</p>

<p>Yet the idea persisted. Slowly Ira rose to her feet, going up
the steps into the open. The smile lingered on her lips. She
circled the house, carefully watching the walls. The manor was
solidly built of stone through the ground floor and the basement;
she doubted if there was any structural wood in the cellars, and
stone would not burn. Suddenly she turned and ran into the
woods, returning in a few minutes with a great armful of dead
wood and branches.</p>

<p>Journey after journey she made into the thicket, bringing out
loads of dead wood. Her dress became torn, her arms blackened and
scratched, leaves and twigs littered her disordered hair; but she
heeded only her work. Feverishly she worked, at first carrying
her loads down the steps and piling them against the door. Later
she was able to stand at the head of the steps and throw her
burdens down.</p>

<p>Soon she had a pile of wood against the door and extending up
the bottom steps. She was working quickly. At length she paused
and looked down through the darkness. She believed that she had
enough wood for her purpose. One more load and she would light
the pile. Would she succeed in stampeding those men?</p>

<p>"Sakes alive." A light voice behind her caused Ira to turn
quickly. A girl was standing in the hall, watching her with
amazement. "What's the game, girlie?"</p>

<p>For a moment Ira looked at the newcomer. Then: "Who are
you?"</p>

<p>"I?" The girl laughed slightly. "I'm Emily Dale. Who are you
and what's the great idea?"</p>

<p>For a moment Ira hesitated. The girl looked hard, yet honest.
Could she trust her? Almost she believed she could. But she had
to, or else abandon her task. Rapidly she explained. Emily Dale
laughed. For a moment she turned slowly on her heels, carefully
examining the big hall and what she could see of the other parts
of the house through the broken floors; then went to the stone
pile in the corner and placed beside Ira's her gloves and bag.
Drawing up her sleeves she returned to where Ira stood
waiting.</p>

<p>"Get to it, girlie," she exclaimed. "Got a match? We'll soon
smoke those rats out."</p>

<p>A few moments and a thin wisp of smoke lazily circled up the
stone steps behind the girls, as they ran through the archway
into the hall, and lost itself amid the rafters. It grew and
became definite. As the smoke thickened little flickering tongues
of flame illuminated the dark cavern beyond the archway. A minute
more and the girls were driven far back into the hall.</p>

<p>"More wood." Emily laughed loudly. "Pile it on, girlie. They
can't stand much more of that."</p>

<p>Laughing almost hysterically the girls ran into the woods,
returning with their arms loaded with dead timber. The steps were
now a roaring furnace; they had to stand back from the archway
and throw their loads, piecemeal, into the flames. Suddenly Emily
Dale collapsed on the floor, laughing hysterically.</p>

<p>"Give it a rest, girlie." She chortled. "The rats must be
warm enough by this time. Lord, what a lark. I don't remember
enjoying myself so much for quite a time."</p>

<p>Through the smoke and flames belching from the archway they
heard voices shouting. Emily sprang to her feet, catching Ira and
dragging her down the hall.</p>

<p>"They've got a throatful." Again she laughed. "Come on, we've
got to get into hiding." She glanced around her. "Lord, what a
place! Say, this'll do"</p>

<p>She caught Ira's hand and dragged her to the big stairway.
Hand in hand the two girls raced to the upper story clinging
together, they crossed the massive rafters until they came to a
spot from where they could look down at the arched doorway. The
flames had now subsided considerably, but huge billows of smoke
still continued to pour from the aperture.</p>

<p>Minutes passed, while they watched, hand in hand. The smoke
abated and finally became a trickle of loose whiffs. Again they
heard the voices. Suddenly two men darted into the hall through
the archway, coats wrapped about their heads. They ran out of the
building.</p>

<p>Waiting some minutes, the girls descended into the hall.
Skirting the hall, they looked out on the grounds watching the
edge of the woods but could see no signs of the men. They went to
the archway. The air within it was heavy with smoke, but still
breathable. The steps were littered with glowing cinders, the
stones on which they stood struck hot through the thin soles of
their shoes.</p>

<p>"Say, girlie?" Emily Dale turned to her companion. "Now you've
smoked out your rats, perhaps you'll let me know what it's all
about. You said there was a man down there you had to rescue from
those men. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Richard Dening, my&mdash; my employer" Ira answered
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Employer?" Emily's brows arched. "Gosh, if you do that for an
employer, what&mdash;" She paused, glancing shrewdly at the girl
before her. "Say, what 'ud you do for a&mdash;a lover?"</p>

<p>Ira flushed hotly. For a moment something choked in her
throat. A lover? Again the swift colour flooded face and neck.
But&mdash;but only a few hours had passed since she had first met
Richard Dening. There had been only that morning and afternoon in
the car, through these country lanes. Those few hours of intimacy
while they lunched at the old hostelry at Ewell; wandered about
the old town, Yet&mdash;yet she knew that if she lived&mdash;if
she saw him daily for years&mdash;she could not know him better.
Swiftly she turned to the girl, anger gleaming in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dening is my employer." She spoke coldly. "What are you
doing at Grays, Miss Dale?"</p>

<p>"Queer thing." The night club girl went to her bag and fetched
cigarettes and matches. "It's just Richard Dening I'm after.
Smoke?"</p>

<p>"You?" Ira refused the proffered cigarette case.</p>

<p>"Sure thing. Why not?" The girl laughed lightly. "He was
decent to me last night, and even girls like me appreciate
decency&mdash;there's few men at these night clubs they get it
from anyway. Mr. Dening told me that he was there on business and
asked me to help him. Paid me well to do it, too. I got gambling,
made quite a pile at the tables, for once in my life. I usually
lose and it was his money I gambled with, too. Then he
disappeared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Disappeared?" Ira echoed.</p>

<p>"That's where I fell down on the job." Emily shrugged. "He'd
hired me to tail him and I failed. You can't put me anywhere near
green baize and expect me to keep my head. Last night I had the
luck to retain some sense, must have been through talking to him.
Anyway, when the luck turned, had sense enough to pull out. Back
to Emily, I remembered my job and had a look round. Couldn't find
him "</p>

<p>"What was Mr. Dening after?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. He didn't tell me. All I knew was my own job, to
keep watch on him. So I got on to that again; but he wasn't
anywhere about. I searched that night club as the police have
never searched it; but there wasn't a sign of him. Then I heard
them talking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Sir John McNiven and that Frenchman, Letoit. I only got a few
words, something about taking him to Grays. I guessed that was
R.D. and thought&mdash;Oh, damn it, I had to keep on the job
until I caught up to him and resigned, you know."</p>

<p>Ira laughed suddenly, happily. She turned and tested the hot
steps with her toes. They had cooled considerably while she and
Emily had been talking. She believed they might venture down to
the cellars now.</p>

<p>"Come on, Emily. We can go down now. You know, we have to get
Richard Dening out of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is talking about me?" A laughing voice spoke from
behind the two girls.</p>

<p>They swung round impetuously. Crumpled, unshaven, yet flushed
and happy, Richard Dening stood in the great hall, smiling at
them.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="first">"DICK." With a wild gesture of abandon Ira flung
out her arms.</p>

<p>Somehow before she knew what was happening, Ira found herself
in Dening's arms, strained close to him. For a moment she lay,
supremely happy, then wrenched herself free, her face flushing
hotly.</p>

<p>Emily Dale watched the little scene, a twinkle in her eyes.
Nonchalantly she turned and strolled towards the archway. For a
moment she waited, tapping the steps with her toe; then turned to
face the others.</p>

<p>"Say, when you two have finished settling the relations
between employer and work girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Employer?" For a moment Dening looked puzzled. He glanced at
Ira's flushed face and a quick smile dawned on his lips. "Oh, you
mean I've taken a job."</p>

<p>"Some job." The girl nodded. "I'll say she's some fast worker.
Anyway what I want to know is why we're playing Guy Fawkes with
this old ruin while you're enjoying yourself strolling about the
country in evening clothes."</p>

<p>"We thought you were down there, Dick." Ira explained.</p>

<p>"I see." Dening laughed, then paused. "How much do you know of
what has been going on? Ira, why are you out here?"</p>

<p>"I came to find you."</p>

<p>"Echo me." Emily fox-trotted to where she had deposited her
things on the pile of stones. "This is the last time I'm going
rescuing anyone, especially barristers who frequent night clubs.
They don't deser&mdash;want it."</p>

<p>"But, how did you come to think I was out here?"</p>

<p>"I traced you out here at least; this is where I thought
they'd bring you," Ira answered.</p>

<p>"Where did you get to at the club, charming?" Emily had
recovered her insouciance. "'Course, I know it's my fault, but
you shouldn't have let me get near the tables." Her face lit.
"Say, boy, do you know I won over three hundred; mostly in good
old solid Bradburys."</p>

<p>"Good girl.'" The barrister laughed. His arm had found Ira's
waist and, apparently, she did not know it. "That was while I was
finding my way into Kedwell's sitting room."</p>

<p>"You did?" Both girls looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I did." Dening laughed grimly. "Made rather an incomplete
search, but found quite sufficient to give me a clue to the
mystery. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then?" Ira looked up with troubled eyes.</p>

<p>"Then Letoit and Mrs. Ashford-Lynne came in. I hid and, too
interested in subsequent proceedings, allowing Mr. Rudolph N.
Rudder to steal a march on me." He touched his head
suggestively.</p>

<p>"Dick."</p>

<p>"Only sufficient to shake up the grey matter a bit," Dening
laughed reassuringly. "You see, we were both in the dark, and I
moved at the right time. Anyway, the blow laid me out for a few
minutes. When I began to recognise things again they were
discussing a quick disposal of my supposed remains. Friend Culadi
wanted to do things in real U.S. A. style and take me for a ride
but the others outvoted him. Finally they decided&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was Reuben Gray there?" Ira interrupted.</p>

<p>"Reuben Gray?" The barrister looked down on the girl
questioningly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray came to your chambers this morning looking for
you."</p>

<p>"No. Reuben Gray wasn't there. Only Sir John McNiven, Kedwell
and Culadi." Dening paused a moment. "They got me down to the
street and bundled me into a car. Culadi and Rudder brought me
here and took me to the cellars below."</p>

<p>"And you escaped?" The question came in a duet.</p>

<p>"I wasn't tied very carefully, and took care to remain
insensible&mdash;so far as they knew, right through. When I was
alone downstairs I had little difficulty in freeing myself, then
I started to explore. That took me most of the remainder of the
night, but at length I found the exit. Went to Grays and found
the inn. Had a meal and a wash, but couldn't find a barber in the
place. Most of the natives avoided me, perhaps they thought I'd
escaped from some asylum; wandering about the country at that
hour of the morning in crumpled dress clothes and without a hat.
Luckily Culadi and Rudder hadn't thought to search me, so I still
had money on me and also a torch and&mdash;" His hand went to his
pocket and came out holding the miniature automatic Emily had
given him the previous night.</p>

<p>"Sakes alive." The girl stared. "And you let yourself be
carted about like a stuffed pig, with that in your pocket?"</p>

<p>"Forgot all about it," the barrister smiled ruefully. "Still,
if I'd remembered it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drop it." The words, like a crack of a whip, came from behind
the little group.</p>

<p>Dening turned swiftly, to stare into the cold merciless eyes
of the Chicagoan gunman, standing some few feet away, a gun in
his hand.</p>

<p>"Drop it, Richard Dening." Every line of Culadi's body was a
threat. "Drop it, I say. Quick."</p>

<p>Still the barrister hesitated, his hand outstretched, the
little automatic resting on his palm. Could he, dare he, chance a
break? He knew of the uncanny ability of the man facing him. Dare
he?</p>

<p>With a sudden movement he sprang to one side. Simultaneously
the weapon turned in his hand; his fingers caught at the trigger.
Two shots rang out in the stillness of the old ruin. With a gasp
of relief the barrister realised that Culadi had missed.</p>

<p>A little smile came on Dening's face. Why did not Culadi
shoot? He had expected the first shot to be followed by a stream
of bullets, spraying round. What was the man waiting for?</p>

<p>Had that streak of cowardice he had always believed lay under
the veneer of brutality in the American racketeers come to the
surface? Had his quick movements, the lightning change from an
unarmed man, held up, to armed equality, cowed the gunman? That
might be possible. But, what then?</p>

<p>Never for a single moment did he allow his eyes to wander from
the Chicagoan's face. He did not want to fire again unless
forced; yet, for the time he could not see any other way out of
the impasse. He must wait.</p>

<p>Then came a thought. What had happened to Ira and Emily? He
longed to glance round to where they stood but he knew that if he
took his eyes from the man's face for the merest fraction of a
second Culadi would recover his nerve and he would not miss
again.</p>

<p>The gangster had fallen into the killer crouch; shoulders
sagging, knees bent, his gun held easily before the body, his
eyes searching his opponent's face. Dening watched warily. If
only he could make the man move. If he shot now he must shoot to
kill, and he did not want to do that.</p>

<p>Could he make the man move, turn to an angle so that his gun
hand was away from his body? The barrister had a supreme
confidence in his own ability with the gun. He knew that if he
could get Culadi's hand away from his body he could disable him,
force him to drop his weapon.</p>

<p>Almost he laughed. For years his favourite amusement had been
a revolver. He had developed into a certain shot then reading of
the marvellous feats of crack shots with the weapon, he had
developed along similar lines. Now, in spite of the fact that he
was facing a world-famous master of the gun he had no fear; he
had to look upon it as a game of skill. Almost he could
congratulate the Chicagoan, if he won.</p>

<p>The thought persisted. What had happened to the girls? Then,
as if answering his question, Emily Dale moved into sight behind
the gunman.</p>

<p>He frowned. Why had the girl gone there? If he fired and
Culadi moved, he would chance hitting the girl. She was
handicapping him ser&mdash;Almost without thought his body moved.
Culadi fired again. Missed. He laughed openly.</p>

<p>Yet he was forced to hold his fire. He dared not touch the
trigger while the girl was there. If only she would&mdash;Ah.</p>

<p>The girl had sprung forward suddenly, her hands raised high
over her head. Now he saw that she held a big stone. Swiftly it
fell urged by her tautened young muscles. Culadi collapsed with a
slight groan to the flagstones.</p>

<p>"Good girl." Dening sprang forward, bending over the
Chicagoan. A single glance and he saw that the man was
insensible. He wrenched the automatic from the nerveless fingers
and thrust it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Dick! You're wounded."</p>

<p>He glanced down at Ira, white-faced and with trembling lips,
standing by his side. Then he became conscious that his side was
burning, as if seared by a hot iron. He glanced down. Culadi's
last bullet had missed him by a fraction of an inch, cutting
through his clothing. For a moment his fingers sought the wound;
then he smiled.</p>

<p>"Branded." He laughed at the questioning look in the girl's
eyes.</p>

<p>"No, dear, not a wound. Merely a graze. Oh, it'll bleed a
little, but that won't matter."</p>

<p>"You're certain, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely." A quick reassuring pat on the girl's shoulder
and he turned to Emily Dale, holding out the gun she had given
him the previous night. "Here, Emily. Can you guard him for a few
minutes? I don't think he'll come to his senses at once, but he
may. I'm going down to the cellars. There are ropes there, the
ropes they bound me with last night."</p>

<p>The night club girl nodded, her lips pale and compressed.</p>

<p>"Right." Dening moved towards the archway. "I won't be more
than a couple of minutes." He paused, turning again. "You told me
two men went down to the cellars and came back?"</p>

<p>Ira nodded. "I believe he was one&mdash;" She motioned to the
unconscious man. "The other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"More than likely Rudder. They stayed at Sir John's place last
night." Yet he still hesitated.</p>

<p>"Emily's got a gun and she can shoot," Ira answered his
unspoken thought. "She will watch him and I will watch about
her."</p>

<p>Dening nodded. He ran through the archway clattering down the
stone steps. The big wooden door stood idly open, showing on its
face marks of the ordeal by fire to which had been subjected. He
went into the cellars, to where he had been thrown the previous
night, guided by the light of his torch.</p>

<p>The ropes were where he had left them. Collecting them, he ran
up to the great hall again. A few moments and the Chicagoan was
securely bound. As Dening went to lift the man from the ground he
groaned and opened his eyes. For a moment he strove to move; then
looked up.</p>

<p>"Hell."</p>

<p>"That's coming later." Dening grinned down at the man. "Beaten
by a girl this time, Culadi."</p>

<p>"A gun-moll."</p>

<p>"No, just an average, plain-going English girl." With a quick
heave he placed the man on his feet. "Now you go to the bed you
gave me last night."</p>

<p>It was not difficult to hoist the man to his shoulder and
carry him down to the cellars; Ira and Emily leading the way,
lighting his steps with his torch. Dropping the man in a corner
of the first cellar, Dening opened a door, beckoning the girls to
follow him.</p>

<p>They gasped in amazement. The cellars were a series of big
workshops and stores. In one were evidences of a foundry, very
recently in use. In other of the cellars were stacks upon stacks
of cases and barrels. Moving slowly onward, they came to a locked
door.</p>

<p>"What's in there, beautiful?" Emily questioned.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>For a moment the man hesitated, then threw his weight against
the door. It held. Drawing Culadi's automatic from his pocket, he
deliberately blew off the lock.</p>

<p>The cellar was small and fitted with shelves against asbestos
wainscoting that had not long been erected. Curiously, the
barrister examined the loaded shelves; suspicion dawning in his
mind. He tore at the brown paper wrappings of a small parcel,
exposing the side of a tin. He prised it from the parcel. A
glance, and he thrust it back again, an expression of disgust on
his lips.</p>

<p>"Dope." He turned to the girls, after another glance around
the cellar. "Jove, there must be a fortune in dope here."</p>

<p>As they went to leave the cellar, something glittered in the
doorway. Emily bent and picked it up, looking at it curiously.
With a little cry Ira took it from her. It was a misshapen piece
of silver.</p>

<p>"The third silver bullet." She held it up for Dening to
see.</p>

<p>He nodded. "Culadi threatened that he would bring it to
England&mdash;and he kept his word." Now he knew why Culadi had
held his fire in the hall above. The third bullet in his
automatic had been the silver one of death.</p>

<p>Slowly they moved through the cellars. At length Ira paused
before another door.</p>

<p>"This is locked, Dick. I wonder what is behind it?"</p>

<p>Again Dening used the automatic to force an entrance. At
length he was able to push it open. Before them stretched another
passage through the darkness. For a moment he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on." Jauntily the night club girl led down the
passage, leaving the others to follow her. "We want to see all
the show, don't we, girlie?"</p>

<p>Laughingly, Dening and Ira followed. The passage narrowed, yet
retained its original height. It seemed interminably long and the
barrister guessed that they had long since passed the foundation
walls of the house. Where was the passage leading them?</p>

<p>Suddenly they came to a closed door. For a moment the little
beam of light played over its surface; then Emily placed her hand
on the door and pushed. It swung open.</p>

<p>A flight of steps lay beyond the door. Puzzled, they followed
it, to come to a high fence. There did not appear to be a door in
it. Gripping the edge, the barrister lifted himself until he
could see over on to the main road between Grays and the manor
gates. Why had that path ended at the fence without a gate?</p>

<p>Puzzled, Dening skirmished back along the path. A few yards
from the fence; behind a thick tree, he found another path.
Calling to the girls to follow, he led the way. Thirty yards
along the path and he saw a fair-sized house. Halting a moment to
warn the girls to keep well in the shelter of the thicket, Dening
strode forward; his fingers closed around the butt of the
automatic in his pocket.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="first">THE house was of fair size, built of the same
grey stone as the manor house; yet there were unmistakable signs
that it had been erected at a much later date. It was,
apparently, of only one floor and was rather a square in shape.
As he came nearer the barrister saw that behind it had once been
a large garden, surrounded by a high box hedge; now part of the
wilderness.</p>

<p>What was this house? How had he come to miss it on his
previous visit to Grays Manor? So far as he could guess, it stood
not many yards from the avenue from the gates to the house.</p>

<p>Suddenly realisation dawned on him. He remembered his talk
with Colonel Middleton at the Karmel Club. The colonel had spoken
of staying at the Lodge with Sir George Gray not long after the
knight had inherited the manor. It was there Sir John McNiven had
interviewed the owner of the house regarding the purchase of
Grays Manor. Colonel Middleton had stated that, at that interview, there had been high words between the two men.</p>

<p>Why? Something in Colonel Middleton's tones had told Dening
that the dispute between the men had not been in regard to the
purchase price. But what common bond could there be between the
city magnate and the ruined master of Grays?</p>

<p>Dening laughed ruefully. He had missed points, points that
might have placed him far on the road of his inquiries. He should
have interviewed Sir George Gray, carefully probing on the
narrative of the garrulous old army man. He should have seen Sir
John again, seeking the connection between the two men.</p>

<p>He circled the house warily, watching for any signs of life
within it. He believed it to be empty. From the tall chimneys
came no signs of fire. He came to the front of the building, and
looked towards where he believed the avenue ran. He was faced
with an almost impenetrable thicket.</p>

<p>That piece of bushland could not have grown up during the time
Sir John had had control of the estate. Very carefully he
examined the edge of the thicket, to again find signs of the box
hedge. He marked the place where once had stood a wicket gate.
Pushing forward, he suddenly found himself on the avenue. He
turned to again face the thick screen concealing the house. Now
he understood. For some reason Sir John had had trees planted to
conceal the lodge from observation.</p>

<p>A few minutes thought and he pushed back through the bushes to
the lodge garden and went to the front door of the building. It
was securely fastened but he believed he would have no difficulty
in forcing the lock. For some moments he stood, his ear against
the woodwork, listening for sounds within the house. Deciding
that the place was empty, he went back to where he had left the
girls.</p>

<p>"Here's beautiful, at last." Emily jumped up from the log on
which she and Ira were seated. "Look here, charming." Her parasol
swung up to indicate the sun. "And beloved,
your&mdash;ahem&mdash;employee, like myself, looks for eats, not
scenery."</p>

<p>"May I then announce lunch though we may have to cook it,"
Dening laughed. He nodded back at the hedge. "I believe there is
food, of some sort, there."</p>

<p>"Then lead me to it." Emily sped on in front.</p>

<p>"But the inmates?" Ira questioned laughingly.</p>

<p>"<i>Quién sabe?</i>" The barrister shrugged. "I can find no
signs of them."</p>

<p>They came to the lodge, again examining the exterior of the
building. They could see no signs of life, Yet the windows were
curtained and the quick eyes of the girls discovered signs that
the place had very recently been inhabited.</p>

<p>"Back door or front door?" asked the barrister.</p>

<p>"I'm not calling on the kitchen-maid," Emily announced
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Then, it's the front door, please." Ira led the way. At the
door she hesitated. Dening bent to the keyhole, but the night
club girl pushed him aside, beating a smart rat-tat with the
handle of her parasol on the door.</p>

<p>A moment, and they heard steps within the building. The door
opened, and Reuben Gray stood on the threshold, smiling at
them.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be jiggered," Emily gasped. "Rube, the
gold-digger."</p>

<p>"Come in." Smiling broadly, Gray held the door for them to
enter. "Didn't expect to find me here, Dening?"</p>

<p>The barrister looked about him curiously as he entered the
sitting room of the lodge. It was well furnished, and showed
signs that it was well and carefully kept.</p>

<p>"Where's eats?" Emily roamed restlessly about the room. "I can
smell coffee."</p>

<p>"In the kitchen," Gray laughed. "We&mdash;I've just made
it."</p>

<p>"Come on, girlie." Emily caught at Ira's hand, dragging her
towards the door. "I want to eat, and I can see this room's going
to be used for a debate. These men will follow when their tummies
talk."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment." Gray went to another door and opened it. From
the further room walked a tall fair girl, smiling rather
nervously.</p>

<p>"We're caught, Dora&mdash;" Gray slipped his arm in the
girl's. "Miss Canning&mdash;" He stopped, laughing at the girl's
look of surprise. "Oh, I know quite a lot, including your name.
Now, may I make you three ladies acquainted. Miss Canning, Miss
O'Connor and Miss Dora McNiven, Sir John's only daughter. Dora,
may I introduce Mr. Richard Dening?"</p>

<p>For a moment Emily was frigidly correct; then suddenly
laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess. Another employee, with the old lodge as the
secret meeting place. So the coffee was for you, Miss McNiven.
Well, Miss Canning and I are going to claim shares. Come along,
do."</p>

<p>As he closed the door after the girls, Gray turned to face the
barrister.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I'll let you talk first, Gray." Dening's smile faded from his
lips. "I think you have quite a lot to explain."</p>

<p>"Perhaps my explanations, and yours, will solve the problems
we are both tackling. Let me say, first, that I came to Grays
to-day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To meet Miss McNiven," Dening laughed slightly.</p>

<p>"Dora and I often meet here." Reuben Gray echoed the
barrister's laugh. "You see, Sir John is having quite a lot of
trouble to make up his mind if he will permit a formal
engagement. Then, there's my father. There will be trouble with
him. It wasn't until the other day that I understood why Sir John
and my father hated each other so much."</p>

<p>Dening nodded. Here was confirmation of the theories that had
come to him that day.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked briefly.</p>

<p>"Let me go back to the reasons why I came to Grays to-day."
The young man went to a sideboard and fetched a box of
cigarettes. "We've got time and to spare. Dora and I were going
to have a picnic meal here. Now the three girls will prepare
something more elaborate, no doubt."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then continued.</p>

<p>"It wasn't until I called at your chambers this morning and
interviewed Chief Inspector Lorrimer that I learned that you had
visited the Blue Heaven last night, and had failed to return
home. Rather peculiar, I was there last night and missed you,
somehow."</p>

<p>"I saw you," Dening nodded.</p>

<p>"I didn't see you." The young man paused. "When I learned that
you had disappeared after visiting Kedwell's place, I went there
and had a word with Black Ked. I had quite a job getting the
truth from him. He said Culadi and he caught you where you
shouldn't have been, eh?"</p>

<p>Dening nodded. "Knocked me silly and brought me here. Sir John
was there, and so was Mrs. Ashford-Lynne."</p>

<p>"I guessed that," Gray smiled. "Don't blame the old man too
much, Dening. He's got a&mdash;a megalomania&mdash;one of those
fixed ideas that drive men to insane lengths. He'd do anything to
see his life's ambition realised, and it certainly looks as if he
has realised it."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;Sir John's ambition?" Dening leaned forward
interestedly.</p>

<p>For some moments Gray smoked in silence; a frown on his
face.</p>

<p>"Those girls will be calling us soon," he said. "So don't ask
questions. I'll explain what you want to know later. Just for the
moment, I'll say that Sir John is the descendant of a man one of
my ancestors very gravely injured."</p>

<p>"You mean, that he is the descendant of someone born on the
Grays estate."</p>

<p>"Some time over a hundred years ago," Gray nodded. "An
illegitimate child; unfortunately born before any lawful children
arrived. The man, when he grew up, got the bee in his bonnet
that, being the eldest child of the Master of Grays, the estates
should rightfully have passed to him. Got very sore when he found
himself passed over. Developed an <i>idee fixe</i>, and passed it
on to his descendants. Sir John took the disease and when he
began to acquire money, and saw our family getting on the rocks,
started to make himself in reality, Master of Grays. He's done
it, too." There was almost enthusiasm in the young man's voice.
"I know that at this moment he owns far more of the county than
the Grays ever held."</p>

<p>Dening nodded. He understood much now; yet there were many
points on which he wanted to ask questions.</p>

<p>"And you?" The barrister turned to the young man. "You know,
Gray, you're under suspicion for quite a lot. You heard that
girl, you know the name she applied to you? Then, there's
Symonds' death, Lorrimer&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gray laughed slightly. "I've known that from the first. Things
did stack up against me, didn't they? Perhaps I might have
altered the aspect to you and Lorrimer, but I was pledged to
silence. It wasn't until I saw a&mdash;a certain gentleman, shall
I call him 'Mr. Y'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;you are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believe that 'Mr. Y' has also a call on your services." A
slight smile came on the young man's face.</p>

<p>For some moments Dening was thoughtful. Here was news that, in
some way, cleared much of the mystery. If Reuben Gray was in the
employ of the Foreign Office, then he had not been far wrong on
many deductions he had formed during the past twenty-four hours.
He looked up at the young man inquiringly.</p>

<p>In answer to the unspoken question&mdash;the challenge to
produce proof of his statement&mdash;Gray took out his pocket
book and folded back a small flap. He handed it to Dening. Under
the celluloid cover lay a small card.</p>

<p>"Then?" Dening inquired.</p>

<p>"I seem to have discovered so little of consequence," Gray
shrugged. "Yet I have been intimate with them for quite a while.
I could break up this gang to-day; perhaps get some of its
members long terms of imprisonment. But would that bring me
nearer the truth that lies at the bottom of this well?"</p>

<p>For some moments the young Foreign Office man sat silent.
Presently he looked up.</p>

<p>"I put the case very plainly to 'Mr. Y' this morning and, in
consequence, have orders to consult you. We're to work together
for the grand finale. What that will be, heaven knows."</p>

<p>"Who killed Symonds?"</p>

<p>The young man shrugged. "Symonds was found in Fern
Court&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was murdered in his offices," Dening interrupted. "That's
clear. There's one point I'm doubtful upon. Was Margaret
Ashford-Lynne there at the time, or did she go to Symonds'
offices later?"</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Luncheon is served, gentlemen." Emily flung open the door
with a flourish.</p>

<p>Gray made a sign for silence. In the kitchen his mood changed.
Frivolous, almost excited, careless and witty, he kept the
thoughts of the girls away from the tragedy and horrors
surrounding them; even drawing Dening, whose mind was a maze of
conjectures and theories, into the mad whirl of
irresponsibilities he was creating.</p>

<p>"Look here, Gray." Dening drew the young man aside, when the
girls rose from the table. "I've got Culadi up at the Manor
House."</p>

<p>"Whew." Gray stared. "So that's what you've been up to? Culadi
captured you&mdash;and you turned the tables on him."</p>

<p>"Not I," Dening shrugged. "I managed to get away, went to
Grays and telephoned for Lorrimer to come here. He should be at
the ruins by now, probably is pulling them down in an effort to
locate me. I went back to the manor house and found that the
girls had seen Culadi and Rudder go down to the cellars. They
thought they had gone there to torture me, and smoked them out.
While we were exchanging experiences, Culadi held us up at the
point of a gun. Said he was going to repay a little debt he owed
me. Emily, the girl you know as Miss O'Connor, got behind him and
welted him over the head with one of your ancestral stones. I
tied him up and placed him in the cellars."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on," Gray turned to the door impatiently. "Lord,
man, if you've got Culadi you've got the key to the mystery. Come
on."</p>

<p>He flung open the outer door, then hesitated.</p>

<p>"I suppose the girls will be all right here." Going to the
door of the bedroom he knocked. Dora opened the door and he spoke
a few words in an undertone. Something passed from his hand to
hers.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment." Dening spoke hastily. He drew from his pocket
the miniature automatic Emily had lent him the previous night. He
called the girl and handed it to her.</p>

<p>"That's all right." Gray gave a sigh of relief. "Understand,
girls, shoot and then ask questions. Dora, you must not open the
door, except to my knock."</p>

<p>Again in the open air, Gray led to the ruins at a rapid rate.
As they came into the open space surrounding the house he
halted.</p>

<p>"Lorrimer's here." The young man spoke over his shoulder.
"Looks as if he's brought half Scotland Yard with him."</p>

<p>In the great hall they found the Chief Inspector, exultant. He
was seated on a pile of stones and before him stood Enrico
Culadi, surrounded by a strong guard of police.</p>

<p>"Great, Mr. Dening." The detective crowed. "Came here to find
you and found this bird already tied up for the taking. I was
just asking him what had become of you." He turned sharply to the
young man beside the barrister. "Now, Mr. Gray, there's quite a
lot I want to know from you."</p>

<p>"Leave Gray alone." Dening flashed a quick glance at the Chief
Inspector. "I'll guarantee him. Glad you found Culadi. I had
forgotten him for the time. We were coming along for him, to try
and persuade him to talk."</p>

<p>"So." Lorimar's eyebrows elevated. He thought a moment. "Say,
Mr. Dening, did you leave one or two prisoners in the
cellars?"</p>

<p>"One." The barrister hesitated, then swung quickly to face the
detective, "What do you mean, Lorrimer? While I was tied up down
there I had quite a sense that I was not alone."</p>

<p>"Well, there's someone else down there." Lorrimer spoke
obstinately. "I've set my men searching through that warren."</p>

<p>"There are only two ways out," Gray spoke thoughtfully.
"Through this hall and the passage to the back of the cottage.
That's locked and the key's in the lodge kitchen. I saw it
there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I smashed the lock of that door when I went through the
passage and found the lodge." Dening interrupted.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" With a gasp of fear Gray turned and bolted into
the open air. "The girls."</p>

<p>He ran down at top speed, closely followed by Dening. After
them swarmed Lorrimer and his constables.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="first">WHO was the man who had been hiding in the
cellars at Grays Manor? Why had Reuben Gray, at the suggestion
that he had escaped from the cellars, run from the ruins in
apprehension. Dening, following the Foreign Office man closely,
tried to think.</p>

<p>They came within a few yards of the entrance gates and Gray
swerved suddenly into the thicket, breaking a way through the
bushes to the front door of the lodge. There he halted, a little
sigh of relief escaping his pursed lips.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Gray?" Dening caught the young man by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Nothing, as it happens." The young man breathed a big sigh of
relief. "But I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>He knocked gently at the door, a peculiar smooth rhythm, and
waited. There was no answer. Again he knocked.</p>

<p>"Dora would not leave the house; she would not allow the
others to leave." He spoke in a half whisper. "I
wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the matter here?" Lorrimer came up to the two young
men, panting. "Lord, Mr. Gray, I thought the place was on fire,
when you bolted like that."</p>

<p>Gray turned, making a sign for silence. He tried the door, to
find it locked. For a moment he bent to the keyhole, and
straightened, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, man?" Dening spoke roughly. "Haven't you a
key?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have got a key." Gray spoke in a whisper. "But the
devil's left his own key in the lock, so I can't use mine."</p>

<p>"Who? What devil?" Lorrimer pressed forward.</p>

<p>"If I were only sure." The young man spoke bitterly. "You've
got Culadi, so it's not he. Rudder's somewhere about, but I don't
think he's there. Letoit, no he wouldn't go that far. Kedwell, I
believe he's in town&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord, I'd forgotten him." Dening's face showed amazement.
"Why, nothing's been seen of him since the day of Symonds'
murder."</p>

<p>"Who?" Exasperated, Lorrimer grasped the barrister's arm,
shaking him roughly.</p>

<p>"Parota. Aaron Parota." The barrister spoke with a groan. "The
one man I've not reckoned on."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's Parota, the ugliest devil in the brood. There's
nothing he's not capable of, to save his skin." He waited for a
moment, and then flung his weight against the door.</p>

<p>"That is enough." A cool, suave voice spoke from the window
beside the door, now open a couple of inches. "That is you, Mr.
Reuben Gray. Then you will stand away from the door. You will be
where I can see you. Please hurry."</p>

<p>Reluctantly, the young man moved a few steps from the door. In
doubt, he looked back at his comrades. Lorrimer and his men were
behind him, but Richard Dening had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" the police officer questioned angrily. He took a
couple of quick steps towards the door, to be halted by the
unseen man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lorrimer will keep away from the door. It is well that he
should know that I have three ladies with me. If he touch that
door I shoot one lady; if he touch more, I shoot another lady." A
low chuckle came through the window gap. "It is for Chief
Inspector Lorrimer to choose." Again came the chucking.</p>

<p>"Who the hell&mdash;" Lorrimer stared at Gray amazedly.</p>

<p>"Miss McNiven, Miss Canning and Miss O'Connor are in there,"
the young man explained in a rapid whisper. "Parota's captured
them by some trick. We'd forgotten him&mdash;until you spoke of
someone hiding in the cellars at Grays."</p>

<p>"Hiding in the cellars?" Lorrimer looked astonished. "What
for?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." Suddenly Gray quickened. "Man, keep him
talking. You can. He'll have to explain to you, he won't to me.
Keep him talking, man."</p>

<p>"Why?" The detective stared, agape as the word 'Dening' formed
on Gray's lips, the chief detective looked hastily around; then
advanced a pace towards the window.</p>

<p>"I warn you to keep away, Chief Inspector." Again the voice
spoke. "Another step and one lady dies."</p>

<p>"So you're Aaron Parota." Lorrimer faced the window coolly.
"Well, what's your game? Gone loony, talking of shooting girls?
Must be. You know you can't get away. I've got the place
surrounded."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;I have the ladies." Again the devilish chuckle
sounded. "Mr. Chief Inspector Lorrimer, are you prepared to make
a treaty; what you call a bargain?"</p>

<p>"What over?"</p>

<p>"You will take your men and Mr. Reuben Gray back to the
ancient house. There you will stay for half an hour. When you
return you may release the ladies."</p>

<p>"And you?" Lorrimer asked the question very, much against his
will, yet he had in mind Gray's injunction to hold the man in
talk. "And you?"</p>

<p>"I will look after myself." Again the man chuckled.</p>

<p>"Look here, you're playing the fool." The Chief Inspector
spoke angrily. "If you're Aaron Parota, what's the matter with
you? I've no warrant for you&mdash;although I'd like to have one.
If you're so anxious to get away, why don't you walk off, not sit
there playing the giddy goat?"</p>

<p>"Certainly." A sneering laugh followed. "The good policeman
must think I am imbecile."</p>

<p>"I'm damned sure you're mad." Lorrimer paused, staring blankly
at the window. What did the man mean? A sudden suspicion came to
his mind. Again he look a step forward, to be halted by Gray's
hand on his arm, his voice in his ear.</p>

<p>"For God's sake be careful, Lorrimer. You can't sacrifice the
girls. I see you've guessed, but Good God, man. Keep him
talking."</p>

<p>Dening had guessed the solution of the riddle long before Gray
or Lorrimer. Almost as soon as Parota had challenged from the
window, he guessed he held the solution to at least one of the
mysteries. A couple of quick steps and he passed behind the
police officers, disappearing into the thicket surrounding the
house.</p>

<p>Moving silently and swiftly, he passed round the house to the
back door. There he paused. He could hear the voices talking at
the front of the house. In the stillness of the woods every word
came plain to him. He caught at the handle, turning it gently.
The door was fastened. For a moment he hesitated, then stepped
back and carefully scanned the face of the house.</p>

<p>He had to find a way in, and that without alarming the man who
held the girls' lives in his hand. He wondered. How had Parota
gained entry to the lodge? Gray had warned Dora that she was not
to open the door, except to his special knock.</p>

<p>He remembered that when he and Gray had left the lodge Dora
had followed them to the door. They had stood on the doorstep and
heard the key turned in the lock. Had the girls locked the back
door? He believed they had.</p>

<p>Then a little kink of memory sprang to life. He had heard the
girl lock the door, and more. He had heard the gentle grate
caused by her withdrawing the key from the lock.</p>

<p>While the girls had been in the bedroom or kitchen, Parota had
come to the lodge, possibly seeking food. He had a key to the
lodge; Gray had told him that each of the seven men had a key.
Parota had entered the house softly, catching the girls unaware.
He had disarmed them and now threatened, fearing for his life,
declare that he would kill them unless the police allowed him to
go free.</p>

<p>Lorrimer would not agree to the man's terms. Dening knew that.
It was only a matter of minutes before the Chief Inspector read
the riddle, as he had done. Then he would be relentless. Parota
would not be allowed to escape. The man's own cowardly fears had
betrayed him.</p>

<p>Again he scanned the face of the building. There were three
windows on that side of the house, but they were fastened. Yet,
were they secure against any attack he could make on them?
Silently, he went to one of the windows and tested it. The bolt
was shot. He took out his penknife and tried to find the lock,
but the blade was too thick to pass.</p>

<p>Again he stepped back, scanning the house anxiously. On the
left side he saw a small lean-to of wood, evidently erected for
the storage of fuel. He went to it and found the door open. The
interior was in darkness. What good could that place be to
him?</p>

<p>Yet an idea surged in his mind. If he could communicate with
Gray or Lorrimer. If he could tell them to apparently accede to
the man's demands and retire from before the lodge. He, in the
darkness of that hut, would wait for Parota to attempt his
escape. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>What was the good of theorising? Parota would not allow Gray
or Lorrimer to move from his sight until they had agreed to his
terms. Despairingly he flashed his torch around the little
space.</p>

<p>He gasped. There was another door to the hut, a door that
opened into the house. Silently the barrister went to it, testing
the lock. The door swung free. He pushed it open and stepped into
the lodge kitchen.</p>

<p>Moving with the utmost caution, he went to the sitting room
door and listened. He could hear the man speaking at the window.
A soft rustle sounded within the room. Possibly that came from
some movement of the girls. He touched the handle of the door,
gripping it tenderly. Slowly he turned the handle, pressing
forward. The door gave, opening a fraction of an inch.</p>

<p>The three girls were seated on the couch, their hands behind
their backs. They were looking towards the window. From where he
stood he could not see Parota, nor could he see the window
through which he was talking. Again he looked at the girls. Some
unconscious movement he made attracted Ira's attention. She was
staring at him; a little gasp came from her parted lips.</p>

<p>Parota must have heard that. With a sudden jerk he threw the
door open, his automatic raised. He did not wait. He saw the
man's face, the ugly snarling grin on his swarthy countenance, as
he turned to the girls, his automatic coming up. Immediately he
fired, shooting to kill.</p>

<p>Again he fired. For a moment Parota clutched wildly at the
sill before the window, a startled expression in his eyes. He
turned to face the kitchen door, the gun slipping to the floor
from his paralysed fingers. For a moment he stood, swaying
awkwardly, then crumpled to the floor, a huddled heap of flesh
and clothing.</p>

<p>Quickly Dening passed into the room and picked up the outlaw's
automatic. A look, a quick, reassuring nod to the girls and he
turned to the front door and turned the key. He was nearly flung
to the floor before the sudden onrush of Lorrimer and his
men.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Chief Inspector." The barrister spoke wearily. "I had
to shoot; it was his life or theirs, and I couldn't take risks.
I&mdash;I don't think he is dead."</p>

<p>The detective nodded shortly; passing quickly to the side of
the wounded man. He tore open Parota's clothing, striving to
staunch the flow of blood. At length he sat back on his haunches,
staring down at the partly sensible man.</p>

<p>"Aaron Parota." Lorrimer spoke formally. "I arrest you for the
murder of Edward Symonds by stabbing him with a knife. I warn you
that anything you say may be used against you."</p>

<p>For a long moment he waited, but the man did not speak. Rising
to his feet, the Chief Inspector turned to one of his men.</p>

<p>"Perry, take Price and Weston with you. Go in the car half a
mile up the road, to Sir John McNiven's place. Put everyone there
under arrest. Then telephone Grays and Ewell. I want a surgeon
and the ambulance here quick. Understand? Only speed will save
this man's life."</p>

<p>Before the men had left the room he was again kneeling at the
stricken man's side, arranging a rough bandage. Dening went to
the couch and released the girls. Taking them to the kitchen he
suggested certain work that would keep their thoughts from the
tragic scene they had just witnessed. Satisfied that for the time
they were safe, he returned to the front room.</p>

<p>Lorrimer looked up as he entered and shook his head, in answer
to the barrister's questioning look. There was little hope or
saving the man's life.</p>

<p>Undecided, the barrister waited a moment; then went to the
couch on which they had laid the wounded man. If Parota would
only speak, he could clear up much that still puzzled them.
Almost as he reached the Chief Inspector's side a shadow darkened
the door. He turned quickly.</p>

<p>"Master Richard." Mick Regan stood in the doorway. "I've
brought Sir John McNiven with me. He wants to speak to you and
Chief Inspector Lorrimer."</p>

<p>The old man stood to one side and the knight moved into the
room. For a moment he hesitated, staring, wide-eyed, at the dying
man on the couch. Then with firm step passed to where Lorrimer
stood.</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector Lorrimer." The knight's voice was full and
firm. "I have come to surrender myself your prisoner. I
understand the charge and the warning you would give me."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="first">"&mdash;AND it is because we recognise curiosity
as a natural human failing that I have asked you to come here
this afternoon."</p>

<p>Sir Phillip Grensham, a high official at the Foreign Office,
known to the three men present as "Mr. Y," paused, glancing with
a little smile at the group before his desk.</p>

<p>They were gathered in a large, handsomely-furnished room in a
tall building off Whitehall, overlooking St. James' Park; Dora
McNiven, Ira Canning and Emily Dale, with Gray, Dening and Chief
Inspector Lorrimer. More than a week had passed since that tragic
afternoon in and about the ruins of Grays Manor.</p>

<p>Within that interval had happened the inquest on Aaron Parota,
with the strictly official verdict that the man had been shot
resisting arrest. Two days previous, the adjourned inquest on
Edward Symonds had been concluded, with a verdict of wilful
murder against the Jew.</p>

<p>"I have here," 'Mr. Y' placed his long thin hand on a pile of
papers, "many reports on what I shall name the 'Grays Manor
Mystery.' Each of those reports deals with some phase of the
inquiry; to gain a connected story from them is difficult.
Therefore I propose that this afternoon the incidents from the
commencement of the inquiry instituted be told by the chief
actors concerned. Mr. Raymond, an official stenographer of my
department," he indicated a silent man seated at a desk in the
corner of the room, "will make a complete record. At the same
time we, individually, will be satisfied in regard to those parts
of the inquiry of which we have no cognisance at the present. I
trust then that&mdash;" he hesitated.</p>

<p>"I believe we have individually given an assurance not to
speak on the matter, Sir Phillip," Richard Dening spoke somewhat
stiffly.</p>

<p>"I quite understand that, Mr. Dening." The Foreign Office
official answered immediately. "Yet, not one of you fully
understands the circumstances leading up to
the&mdash;er&mdash;series of tragedies in which you have borne a
part; the&mdash;er&mdash;possible international complications
that might have&mdash;" Sir Phillip hesitated. "That may still
arise. A few days ago I had the honour of a long interview with
the Secretary of State on the subject. I have been given to
understand that he had communicated with the Prime Minister. In
the result, I am instructed by his Majesty's Government to inform
you fully; then to ask your absolute secrecy&mdash;if possible
your forgetfulness&mdash;of the affair; to ask your attention for
a few minutes while I outline, briefly, the first incidents in
what I can only describe as&mdash;er&mdash;rather remarkable
happenings."</p>

<p>For a full minute his chair swung sideways and the tired,
shaded eyes stared out over the green scene beyond his window. He
looked above the trees to where, in the distance, rise the roofs
and chimneys of the King's palace. Again he turned to face the
little group.</p>

<p>"Some months ago his Majesty's Government
and&mdash;er&mdash;certain valued financial advisers, were
particularly exercised regarding the steady drainage of gold from
many countries&mdash;" Sir Phillip paused, his tones altering
slightly. "I am not referring to the&mdash;er&mdash;rather large
accumulations of gold in the reserves of
the&mdash;er&mdash;United States of America and
the&mdash;er&mdash;Republic of France; although those reserves
have, of recent months, grown&mdash;er&mdash;rather alarmingly. I
am referring to what I might term the luxury gold of the people,
in general; that is, gold in the form of ornaments, trinkets and
service. I believe&mdash;" He fumbled with the papers before him.
"I believe Mr. Richard Dening refers to that in a very
complete&mdash;um&mdash;and satisfactory report he kindly
forwarded to me."</p>

<p>Again the Foreign Office official paused, then continued.</p>

<p>"The continued draining of this gold has much perturbed his
Majesty's Government. After consultation
the&mdash;er&mdash;Government placed the matter in my hands. I
deputed a young man attached to my department to make the
necessary inquiries. I am referring to Mr. Reuben Gray,
and&mdash;er&mdash;will now ask him to commence the combined
report we have met this afternoon to compile."</p>

<p>Almost a sigh of relief passed round the group as Sir Phillip
ended his long, rather stilted speech.</p>

<p>Reuben Gray flushed slightly. He glanced at Dening, then spoke
quickly.</p>

<p>"On receiving your instructions, Sir Phillip, I went to Paris,
considering that I had a better chance of success by commencing
my investigations in that city." For a moment he paused. "The
great increases of the Bank of France reserves has been, in my
opinion, peculiar and not to be explained by ordinary means.
Experts I had consulted had informed me that the French gold
reserve was far in excess of normal growth. The question, as I
understood it, was to discover what had caused this abnormal
increase of gold accumulations."</p>

<p>The young man coughed, flushing again when he caught Dora's
amused glances. He continued, speaking more freely.</p>

<p>"It was not long before my attention was directed to Anton
Letoit. As you are aware, Sir Phillip, M. Letoit is a great power
in Paris. A very wealthy man, he has wonderful influence with his
Government. For a time I kept careful watch on him, discovering
that he had very close connections with the governors of the Bank
of France. Later, I traced a connection with Sir John
McNiven&mdash;" He stopped, flushing painfully. His eyes sought
Dora's across the room.</p>

<p>The girl's face was scarlet. For a moment she sat, gripping
the arm of her chair. Ira placed a hand on the girl's arm, but
she ignored her. With an evident effort she rose and went to
where Reuben Gray sat, drawing up a chair beside him.</p>

<p>"Reuben&mdash;Mr. Gray, wishes to spare my father, if possible
Sir Phillip. But he cannot. He&mdash;we&mdash;must bear the
penalty of our acts." She paused, clutching Gray's hand tightly.
"My father is&mdash;was a man of one idea&mdash;one ambition. He
thought&mdash;he was prepared to sacrifice everything to it. That
he sinned&mdash;" She turned to the young man appealingly.
"Reuben, you must tell all you know."</p>

<p>For seconds Gray was silent, his throat working painfully.
When he spoke again his voice was low and hesitating.</p>

<p>"I discovered that Anton Letoit and Sir John McNiven had
formed a syndicate with the object of purchasing gold in any form
and in any quantities, I discovered that while the syndicate was
ostensibly a private venture it was really owned by the Bank of
France and the French Government; that Letoit was the trusted
agent of his Government, handling vast credits for the purchase
of gold. In fact, Letoit stood for&mdash;for France.</p>

<p>Anton Letoit had brought into his syndicate two of his
continental business associates, von Rosenfeld and Aaron Parota."
The young man paused. "I want you to see how cleverly Letoit
worked. With his three associates he had agencies in north, south
and west Europe. By his connection with Sir John McNiven he
controlled the Altona Trading Company, with its numerous trading
agencies in Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>"Sir John McNiven, controlling the English activities of the
syndicate, brought into the venture Sydney Kedwell, who
controlled a group of night clubs. The idea in admitting him into
the syndicate was that his clubs would make unsuspected centres
where the gold might be bought for the syndicate from its many
agents. Also, they fitted up the cellars of Grays Manor for the
melting of the gold into convenient ingots to smuggle into
France. So far, the syndicate was not acting entirely
illegally&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They were infringing clauses of the Gold Protection Act," Sir
Phillip interposed drily.</p>

<p>"While their actions were, then, not criminally illegal."
Gray's jaw set obstinately. "When Kedwell obtained admission to
the syndicate his greed for immediate wealth brought a radical
alteration. He used his night clubs not only for the purchasing
of gold from the syndicate's legitimate agents, but he,
personally, became a 'fence' for stolen jewellery. In this manner
he obtained an additional profit, paying the thieves he dealt
with the small proportion of value they usually obtain from
receivers in stolen goods, and selling to the syndicate at the
normal value."</p>

<p>"I might add," interposed Dening, "that during the past year
the values of precious stones have appreciated enormously. My
investigations, and admissions made by Sir John McNiven to me
within the past few days, show that the Altona Trading Company
was able to dispose of jewels purchased in the gold at prices
showing very handsome profits."</p>

<p>"At this point in my inquiries," continued Gray, "I discovered
that there was another competitor for gold in the world's
markets&mdash;the United States of America. Through a group of
financiers that Government was competing with the French
Government in a secret war to corner the world's gold
supply."</p>

<p>"Here I must place on record certain observations," Sir
Phillip interrupted. "Matters in Mr. Gray's reports caused me to
have enquiries instituted in the United States of America. I
found that Rudolph N. Rudder, misnamed rum king of America, had
become a member of the Letoit-McNiven syndicate. If I am not
misinformed, the admission of Rudder into the syndicate
definitely established the group as law-breakers on a very large
scale. He was the Letoit-McNiven agent in America, to drain that
country of its gold."</p>

<p>"At this point in the inquiry I referred back to Sir Phillip."
Again Gray took up his story. "The affair had become world-wide,
far too big for any one agent to handle. Thereafter I became
merely a factor in the inquiry, dealing with the various points
under direct instructions."</p>

<p>"A really important and valuable factor." For a moment a
slight smile broke the severe lines of Sir Phillip's face. "Mr.
Gray has not stated that before this he had managed to attach
himself to the syndicate, and by Letoit and Sir John was looked
upon as a valued addition to their body&mdash;" The man known as
'Mr. Y' paused. "I believe I may say, looking on matters from the
syndicate's point of view, that Gray was a decided asset; Sir
John and Letoit had not realised that decidedly criminal elements
had worked in with them, and they required all the backing they
could gain to combat it."</p>

<p>"To assist the various agents I was then employing, and to
maintain a close watch on the members of the syndicate, I applied
to Scotland Yard where always I could obtain the most willing and
valuable assistance. Chief Inspector Lorrimer undertook certain
inquiries; I regret that, at that time, I had not thought fit to
inform Mr. Gray of my action; nor did I inform Chief Inspector
Lorrimer that Mr. Gray was working for the British
Government."</p>

<p>"Sir Phillip's admissions might have proved awkward for Mr.
Gray," Lorrimer spoke suggestively.</p>

<p>Reuben Gray laughed, a laugh that gradually spread around the
little group. The Foreign Office official interrupted.</p>

<p>"I regret that Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;shall I call him 'Operative
A' acting on my instructions in the United States, is not present
with us this afternoon. I have his very extensive reports by
me."</p>

<p>Again he placed his hand on the papers. "He deals extensively
with this man, Rudder. From his reports I gather that this man is
a direct menace to civilisation that the United States Government
does not seem able to deal with. In some manner he obtained the
leases of the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, using them as
headquarters for his liquor and drug smuggling
operations&mdash;and also for his gold-buying dealings. Operative
'A' indicates&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anton Letoit is Rudolph N. Rudder's partner in his liquor and
drug smuggling trade," observed Dening quietly.</p>

<p>"Hell!" Lorrimer sprang to his feet. "And he left London for
Paris last night. I guess it was through him that Rudder got hold
of those islands."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="first">SIR PHILLIP GRENSHAM nodded. "I will now ask
Chief Inspector Lorrimer to continue the report," he said.</p>

<p>"The Foreign Office set me a difficult problem." The detective
spoke without preface. "Thinking the matter over, I decided to
try unofficial methods, consulting Edward Symonds&mdash;" He
paused, then added in explanation. "Edward Symonds was once a detective-sergeant at the Yard, sir; and a clever, keen man. He
left the Yard to establish himself in business as a private
inquiry agent.</p>

<p>"For a time we were unsuccessful. I then decided to break
Symonds into the gang. We wrote a letter to Sir John McNiven,
offering certain services, based on information you supplied me
with, Sir Phillip, and using the name of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Matthew Ashcombe." Gray showed real surprise.</p>

<p>Lorrimer nodded. "We drew an answer. Sir John accepted Matthew
Ashcombe's offer of services. With Sir Phillip's help and consent
we obtained a considerable amount of gold and forwarded it to Sir
John. To our surprise we did not receive the promised cash for
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You eventually received payment?" Dening questioned.</p>

<p>"We did not." Lorrimer was emphatic.</p>

<p>"I saw the money posted," Gray spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes." Sir Phillip smiled at this conflict of testimony.</p>

<p>"Sir John obtained the money from the bank. He had it in his
office at Altona House one day when I happened to call. He showed
it to me," Gray explained rapidly.</p>

<p>"And you marked certain bank-notes?" Dening interposed.</p>

<p>"Sir John told me that he was curious as to the identity of
Matthew Ashcombe, and, trying to trace him, had decided to mark
the notes. I was also curious." Gray swung on his seat to face
the Foreign Office official. "You will understand, sir, Matthew
Ashcombe had given his address as Grays Manor. Sir John and I
both knew that the place was an uninhabitable ruin. We knew that
no one of that name lived there, or at Grays, and were decidedly
curious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You saw Sir John pack the bank-notes, address and post them?"
Dening persisted.</p>

<p>"Yes. He addressed the parcel in my presence and I went with
him to the East Strand post-office, where he registered it for
despatch to Grays Manor."</p>

<p>"Did you read the address on the parcel, or on the
registration receipt?" Lorrimer questioned sharply.</p>

<p>"No." A doubt came in the young man's eyes. He brightened. "A
few days afterwards I saw the receipt, when Sir John produced it
at the board table and told us he had received a telephone
message from Matthew Ashcombe acknowledging receipt of the
money." Again he hesitated. "Surely he never managed to put a raw
deal over me?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid he did," Dening laughed. "Take the facts of the
case. Sir John posted a valuable parcel to Grays Manor. He holds
the receipt which he shows to his associates. The parcel is
received by the addressee and is acknowledged by telephone. Yet,
the only parcel record showing that the parcel ever existed is
the registration at the East Strand post-office&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that receipt was written by a man who had gone on
holidays-some hundreds of miles distant from London&mdash;at the
time of its issuing." Sir Phillip interposed. "Can you explain
that, Mr. Dening?"</p>

<p>Instead of replying directly to the question, the barrister
turned to the police officer.</p>

<p>"Did Symonds ever explain to you how the trick was worked,
Lorrimer?"</p>

<p>"The day before he was murdered he said that he had an
important clue." The Chief Inspector spoke reluctantly. "I was to
call on him two days from that date and he promised, that he
would then have a full explanation for me and evidence for an
arrest."</p>

<p>"I thought he knew," Dening nodded. "Now, before I go further,
will you explain how you and Symonds came to use the name Matthew
Ashcombe, and the Grays Manor ruins as an address?"</p>

<p>"I don't know where Symonds got the Matthew Ashcombe from,"
Lorrimer grinned embarrassedly. The Grays Manor was a queer
mistake. At one time Symonds had in his employ an old man named
Charlie Smith. He got past work and obtained the job of
gatekeeper on a country estate. He told Symonds that he was going
to Grays Manor&mdash;</p>

<p>"But Charlie Smith lives at Upton Lodge." Dora spoke quickly,
in surprise.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately Mr. Smith is not here to explain." Sir Phillip
interposed. "We will presume that he told Mr Symonds that he was
going to Grays, and that he was misunderstood to say Grays
Manor."</p>

<p>Lorrimer nodded. "Looks like that's correct, Sir Phillip.
Symonds said that he would get in touch with the man and get him
to accept the parcel as Matthew Ashcombe."</p>

<p>"Does that explain how the mystery surrounding the packet of
bank-notes was worked, Mr. Dening?" queried the Foreign Office
official. "I must confess&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The trick was worked very simply," Dening laughed. "First, I
must explain that at the time Symonds completed his contract with
Sir John and the syndicate&mdash;and delivered the gold&mdash;Sir
John was seriously pressed for ready cash. Letoit was in France
and the outgoings of the syndicate had exceeded expectations;
funds were never large in London; Letoit was too much of a
Frenchman to let money go out of his personal control. Sir John,
at this time, had an unexpected opportunity of buying some land
that would nicely round off the Grays estate he was re-creating.
He took the money that should have been sent to Symonds, or
Matthew Ashcombe, and used it for his own purpose. To cover up
his&mdash;er&mdash;temporary dishonesty he worked a very
ingenious scheme. Let me say here that he prepared for the
eventual repayment of the money directly he could lay hands on
funds belonging to himself, and received additional credits from
Letoit."</p>

<p>For some minutes the barrister was silent, frowning
thoughtfully; then began to speak slowly and with much
hesitation.</p>

<p>"Sir John duly received the gold. He prepared a packet of
blank paper and addressed it to Grays Manor, to Matthew Ashcombe.
This he posted and for which he duly received the registration
receipt."</p>

<p>Again he paused, to continue:</p>

<p>"Before posting he treated the surface of the parcel with a
preparation lately invented by a German chemist in von
Rosenfeld's employ, and which Sir John was then preparing to
place on the English market. This chemical had the properties of
dry bleaching very effectively."</p>

<p>Dening rose from his chair and went to a side table on which
rested an open suitcase. From it he took a small parcel and
placed it on the desk before Sir Phillip Grensham.</p>

<p>"You will notice, Sir Phillip, that although there is the
label and the post-registration label on that parcel, on neither
appears any writing or printing. Both have been bleached out by
this German chemical."</p>

<p>"But," Gray gasped. He had gone to the desk and was now
examining the parcel. "But I saw him write the address. I was
with him when he posted it. Then&mdash;then there's the matter of
the receiving clerk's writing on the receipt, at the time when he
was supposed to be on holidays."</p>

<p>"I think that is the clue Edward Symonds discovered and which
he promised to reveal to Chief Inspector Lorrimer, when he had
obtained the proof for a definite charge," Dening replied
thoughtfully. "I must ask you to remember that I said this packet
contained only blank paper, not the bank-notes; Sir John
attempted what was nearly a perfect crime, the flaw being that
the parcel was posted before the gold was delivered and before
you saw him in his office packing and addressing the parcel of
bank-notes."</p>

<p>Again Dening went to his case, this time bringing out a sheet
of brown paper, to which an addressed label and registration
label adhered.</p>

<p>"This is the wrapping surrounding the parcel Mr. Gray
witnessed being packed and addressed." He laid it on the desk.
"You will note that the address is to Upton Lodge, Grays. I
want you to particularly note how the address is written. First,
it is addressed to Sir John, thus:"</p>

<p>He took a pencil and pad and rapidly wrote the address:</p>

<p class="letter">"Sir John McNiven, Kt.,<br> Upton Lodge,<br>
Grays,<br> Surrey."</p>

<p>"Will you please note that the first three lines are close
together; that there is the same interval between the name of the
addressee and Grays as there is between Grays and Surrey.
Remember, Sir John had at his command a powerful bleaching agent.
If he wiped out the name of the addressee and substituted Matthew
Ashcombe; and obliterated Upton Lodge, adding Manor after Grays,
the address would be a perfect simile of the address on the other
parcel, now entirely bleached out."</p>

<p>Again Dening paused, as if collecting and marshalling
facts.</p>

<p>"Sir John posted a dummy packet he did not intend to be
delivered on the 18th. A few hours in the post and the parcel was
undeliverable. It was put aside for the postal officials, waiting
for some claim to be made by which it could be traced. At that
time they had no suspicion that any fraud was involved. On the
28th Sir. John posted the parcel of bank-notes to himself at
Grays. He did that so that he could be seen posting the notes. No
doubt he managed that Mr. Gray should call that day and be his
witness of the posting. It was not difficult to alter the date
stamp on the parcel when it was delivered, and on the
registration receipt he held&mdash;for a parcel to Matthew
Ashcombe, to make them both the 28th. If you will take this
glass, Sir Phillip, you will be able to distinguish the
alterations. I must say it was a very clever scheme."</p>

<p>He waited while the others gathered round the desk examining
the various exhibits he had placed there. After a short time he
continued:</p>

<p>"Sir John posted the real bank-notes to himself, to obtain a
witness to his posting the money to Matthew Ashcombe. That you
provided, Gray. I believe it was his intention, after the
parcel had been delivered to him, to re-post the bank-notes in
the correct manner to Matthew Ashcombe, confident that the delay
in obtaining fresh funds to replace the notes he borrowed would
not be noticed&mdash;or, if noticed, he had an explanation. The
telephone message that the parcel was delivered
was&mdash;was&mdash;" He glanced embarrassedly at Dora, "an
invention."</p>

<p>"But the marked bank-notes at the Blue Heaven Club?"
questioned Gray.</p>

<p>"That comes later in the report." Dening smiled rather
wearily. He hated these records of trickery and crime. "First, I
want to introduce you to 'Matthew Ashcombe II.'"</p>

<p>He paused, turning to Gray.</p>

<p>"You will remember that at the conference at Altona House I
claimed that Matthew Ashcombe was one of the seven men gathered
at the table. I was right. One of those men had conceived the
idea of blackmailing his associates at the time when the first
Matthew Ashcombe and his strange address were discussed at that
table. That man was a gambler, and a very unsuccessful one. For a
long time he had been losing large sums of money. At the time
when Matthew Ashcombe first came to light he was in desperate
need. He had applied to certain of his associates for large
sums&mdash;unsuccessfully."</p>

<p>"Ted Symonds never blackmailed anyone, Mr. Dening," Lorrimer
spoke heatedly. "He was my mate at the Yard, and straight. Dead
straight. I'll swear to that."</p>

<p>Dening took no notice of the interruption.</p>

<p>"Two men were very disconcerted when it was suggested that I
be consulted on the attempted blackmail&mdash;Sir John McNiven
and Aaron Parota. They both feared that
their&mdash;er&mdash;errors would be exposed. Sir John, to
confuse the trail of the packets addressed to Grays, ordained
that certain bank-notes be passed at the Blue Heaven night club,
first warning Kedwell of what might happen, but without
explanations. Aaron Parota waited. He attended the meeting at
Altona House at which I was present and made the remark that
completely stampeded him.</p>

<p>"After the meeting he trailed me from Altona House to my club;
and from there followed me on my walk to the Temple. When he was
convinced that I was making for my chambers, he took another
route and arrived at the entrance to Fern Court before me.
Concealed amid a patch of garden on the other side of the lane,
he shot twice at me, fortunately missing me both times. Almost as
he fired the second shot I had decided where the first shot had
come from, and had started to run across the lane. I tripped on
the edge of the pavement and fell. Parota believed that he had
accomplished his purpose and fled.'</p>

<p>"Who murdered Edward Symonds?" Lorrimer asked impatiently.</p>

<p>"A coroner's jury has said Aaron Parota," Dening answered. "We
have a good reconstruction of the crime, but until it is tested
by a defence we cannot be certain that it is absolutely correct."
He paused for some moments. "I am afraid I am taking up
considerable time, Sir Phillip, and will hasten as much as
possible." Again he paused, to continue:</p>

<p>"Times now match very closely. Parota, thinking that he had
murdered me, went directly to his offices in Royston House,
Kingsway. As he approached the doors of that building, he saw
Mrs. Ashford-Lynne walking before him. He was curious regarding
the business she had in that building. He followed her and saw
her enter Symonds' offices. Now he became fearful. That day he
had learned from Letoit that the Frenchman had, by accident,
dropped his (Parota's) letter, asking for a large loan, in Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne's boudoir. He had more than a suspicion that
Symonds was investigating both Matthew Ashcombes. He mistrusted
what use the woman would make of that letter; he feared that it
would provide Symonds with a definite clue, if it fell into his
hands."</p>

<p>"Let me, for one minute, refer directly to Symonds and Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne." Dening's tone changed. "I have reason to believe
that Symonds was on the point of clearing up the whole mystery
surrounding the gold syndicate at the time of his murder. He had
a certain hold over Margaret Ashford-Lynne, a hold of which Chief
Inspector Lorrimer and myself are aware, a hold that could be
used to force the truth from the woman.</p>

<p>"Again, Symonds had discovered the woman's connection with
Sydney Kedwell. He had bidden her call at his offices late that
night, with the idea of forcing her to give him the information
he required to complete the case he had promised Mr. Lorrimer. He
had also requested Miss Can&mdash;Ira&mdash;to call on him that
day. Unfortunately, she was out when Symonds' letter arrived at
her home, and she did not receive it until quite late. Believing
the matter to be important she immediately went to Kingsway and
was thus drawn into the maze of this tragedy."</p>

<p>Again the barrister paused. For a moment his eyes met Ira's
with a smile of understanding.</p>

<p>"Symonds' letter gave Ira the idea that he wished to offer her
employment. Really, he wished to question her regarding Mrs.
Ashford-Lynne. Her late arrival at Symonds' offices permitted the
interview with Margaret Ashford-Lynne to occur first. As we know,
she was trailed by Parota, his heart filled with what he believed
to be the lust of one murder; ready, if necessary, to commit a
second to preserve his wretched neck.</p>

<p>"Let me go back a space. When Parota learned that Letoit had
lost his letter and that probably it was in the hands of a woman
who would sell it to the highest bidder if she discovered its
value, he was in the Frenchman's study. Here the question of the
Spanish knife comes up. Letoit informed me, when I questioned
him, that he distinctly remembered handling the knife after Mr.
Gray's call. He was certain that it was on his desk when Parota
was with him. Parota and he left the room together to go to
Altona House. When Letoit returned home he immediately missed the
knife."</p>

<p>"Much of what I have stated are facts, easily provable,"
Dening continued, after a pause. "There is evidence that Parota
had the Spanish knife&mdash;Letoit's statement is sufficient
there. From now on we can only theorise."</p>

<p>"Parota watched Margaret Ashford-Lynne enter Symonds' offices.
Fearful for his safety, he managed to overhear the conversation
between the woman and the inquiry agent. Now he realised that
Symonds had sufficient evidence to connect him with Matthew
Ashcombe. He heard Symonds state that he was placing his proof in
the hands of the police the next day. He believed that once under
arrest he would be quickly accused of the murder of one Richard
Dening." The barrister laughed lightly. "Fear crowding on him, he
burst in on Symonds and the woman. Symonds pluckily tackled him,
but, taken by surprise and at some disadvantage, received the
knife thrust in his breast. Only the woman then remained."</p>

<p>The barrister lowered his voice.</p>

<p>"Can we reconstruct the scene in that office? The inquiry
agent on the floor, blood welling from the fatal wound; the woman
cowering before the murderer, willing to promise anything to save
her life. We can only surmise what happened during the few
minutes in which Parota must have debated whether he should not
commit yet a third murder. Perhaps it was because he realised
that he had to dispose of a body that the woman was spared. He
went to his office and came back with a large motoring
cloak&mdash;it is still in his offices with the bloodstains on
it. In this he wrapped Symonds' body and carried it from Symonds'
offices. Luck, or cunning, served him and he managed to get his
gruesome burden down to his motor car unperceived. He drove to
the Temple-"</p>

<p>"Why?" Lorrimer broke in abruptly.</p>

<p>"There again we can only theorise."' Dening answered wearily.
"I assume that he believed he had killed me. He had no reason to
believe that he would be suspected of the murder, but his Latin
blood conceived a means of blurring any trail to himself that
might exist. He thought he would set the police an insoluble
problem if, within half an hour of discovering my my dead body in
the lane they found in the vicinity another corpse. Then, when he
gets to the Temple he realises that he has not killed me. The
reaction causes him to bolt in terror. He goes to Grays,
and&mdash;and the rest you know."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector nodded. "That's feasible. I'm going to
have a word with Mrs. Ashford-Lynne."</p>

<p>"Then you will have a long journey," Gray laughed, almost in
relief. "Kedwell and Margaret Ashford-Lynne were married
yesterday morning and are now somewhere on the
continent&mdash;probably. The Blue Heaven is under new
management."</p>

<p>"There remains the letter Sergeant Chambers found at the Blue
Heaven," the detective spoke suddenly.</p>

<p>"The blackmailing letter Parota sent to von Rosenfeld," Dening
laughed. "An accidental red-herring across the trail, Chief
Inspector. It was on the table because von Rosenfeld and Sir John
had been discussing it, trying to guess the identity of the
writer. The envelope addressed 'R. Gr&mdash;' was part of a
perfectly ordinary letter von Rosenfeld was writing to Mr. Gray,
prior to his leaving for Berlin. Sir John states that von
Rosenfeld picked up the letter but forgot the envelope and the
blackmailing letter, when the police arrived."</p>

<p>"My father&mdash;Sir John&mdash;" Dora turned appealingly to
Sir Phillip. "Are you&mdash;" she hesitated.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office official smiled kindly at the girl.</p>

<p>"I understand that on Mr. Dening's advice Sir John McNiven is
taking an extended holiday on the continent." He laughed
slightly. "When you write to him, Miss McNiven, I suggest that
you advise that this holiday extends for&mdash;shall we say,
twelve months? Yes, I think by that time he will have recovered
his&mdash;er&mdash;balance."</p>

<p>For a moment he waited, then glanced around the expectant
faces before him.</p>

<p>"I think our reconstruction is now complete. I don't think,
ladies and gentlemen, that it is necessary to remind you of Lord
Ardleton's request that the matter be now completely forgotten.
Anton Letoit is in Paris where, I believe, he was joined by Baron
von Rosenfeld. I am sorry to state that his Majesty's Government
has had to inform those gentlemen that their presence in England,
on British soil, will not be welcomed at the present time, nor
for some considerable time in the future."</p>

<p>Again he paused, to continue:</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector Lorrimer informs me that Culadi and Rudder
were arrested at Grays Manor. They are to be charged with
smuggling drugs and liquor into Great Britain." A rather
significant smile came on the thin official lips. "I am afraid
that when they go for trial the judge will deal with them in a
manner that will be entirely satisfactory to both the British and
American Governments, for many years to come."</p>

<p>Again he hesitated, turning to the barrister.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dening, I have already expressed to you, at a former
interview, his Majesty's Government's appreciation of your
invaluable work. May I add that in the future&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At the immediate present, Sir Phillip," a quick smile came on
the barristers lips as he went to Ira and drew her hand through
his arm. "I am proposing a lengthy trip to the
continent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jove." Gray sprang to his feet. "Dora said this morning that
she had no reason for any delay, and&mdash;and Sir John handed
over the whole reconstructed Grays estates to us for a wedding
present&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am to congratulate you as Master of Grays, then, Mr. Gray?"
Sir Phillip had risen and come round his big desk.</p>

<p>"Oh, that doesn't matter," Reuben Gray waved it airily aside.
"Say, Dening, what about making it a double event?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, old man. 'Fraid that's impossible." A broad smile came
on the barrister's lips. "Sir Phillip will inform you, if you
don't already know, that there is a law against a man getting
married when he already has a wife."</p>

<p>"You darling!" Emily Dale, who had sat silent and subdued by
her unaccustomed surroundings, sprang to Ira's side. "And that's
the way you act towards your pals? Gosh, girlie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you, Miss Dale." Sir Phillip turned to the night club
girl, very courteously. "I am instructed to convey to you, direct
from the Prime Minister, Lord Ardleton, his Majesty's deep debt
of gratitude for your assistance in what we have agreed to call
'The Grays Manor Mystery.'" He hesitated a moment. "I am
instructed to say that if his Majesty's Government can be of
service to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My! Listen to that." Emily pirouetted quickly, grasping Ira's
hands. "Just think. The whole of this wonderful big, British
Empire, all those people who at the Blue Heaven looked down on
the little night club girl, are now saying 'thank you' to me."
She turned and curtseyed mockingly to the tall man supporting
himself on his stick amid the group.</p>

<p>"Sir Phillip, do you know what you are saying? Don't you know
that my father was a small greengrocer in a back street of
Peckham; that I was dragged up in the streets and at the board
school, and served behind the counter of a second-rate drapery
shop in Camberwell. And&mdash;and&mdash;" the tears came quickly
in her eyes&mdash;"and you're saying 'thank you' to me from the
swells and toffs&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We want to say more than 'thank you,' little girl." The man
on whose slender shoulders rested the secret defence, in times of
peace, of a mighty Empire, took her hand. "Won't you put on your
wishing cap and discover if Lord Ardleton cannot play fairy
godmother?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he, and others, already have." For a moment she cloak
of insouciance fell from, her as she looked up into the grave
tired eyes.</p>

<p>"I'd got careless, taking the easy way&mdash;that lay through
the doors of the night club. Then&mdash;then he came&mdash;" She
pointed to Richard Dening. "And somehow, he said things
that&mdash;that woke me up&mdash;gave me a jolt just where I
deserved it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again she paused, to continue in a lower voice:</p>

<p>"I met a man once, quite a long time ago, and he was decent to
me. He came to the Blue Heaven last night and&mdash;and I found
that he&mdash;he hadn't forgotten. He'd been in Australia,
and&mdash;and we sat at a table and he told me what a wonderful
country it was. Just the things he said, made me want to see
it."</p>

<p>"So you're going to survey the outposts of our Empire, on a
personally conducted tour?" Sir Phillip suggested gently.</p>

<p>"With a little gold band as chaperon." For a moment the girl's
careless nonchalance peeped out. Then her eyes grew misty. "Say,
he's wonderful."</p>

<p>"The right man always is wonderful." Ira caught at her
husband's arm.</p>

<p>"That girl talks sense," Emily laughed through her tears. She
went a step closer to the grave-faced, elderly man. "She can say
what I can only think." She waited, scanning searchingly the
lined worn face.</p>

<p>"Once a woman told you that you were&mdash;wonderful?" The
girl spoke in the barest whisper. "And&mdash;and you are, you
know."</p>

<p>"Perhaps one day she will tell me that again&mdash;when I
reach her." Sir Phillip bent to the girl, his lips trembling.
"It&mdash;it can't be long now. Thank God."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" The girl laid her hands on the man's shoulders,
reaching up to him. I'm not worthy I know&mdash;I'm only a night
club girl, and&mdash;and I've rubbed against quite a lot of
dirt&mdash;but&mdash;but she will understand. For
her&mdash;you're wonderful&mdash;wonderful, mister man.</p>

<p>Very lightly, her lips rested on his for a brief moment. Then,
with head held high, she turned towards the door.</p>
