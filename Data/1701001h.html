<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="first">"IT'S the queerest bit o' business I've
seen."</p>

<p>Constable Nicholls was standing on the sandhills that border
Little Bay, looking down into a shallow depression, in which lay
the body of a naked woman. His large, red, good-humoured face
wore an expression of almost comical dismay, as he leisurely
scratched his thinly covered head with the peak of his official
cap. Nicholls was not recognised in the New South Wales Police
Force for his readiness to grasp a situation.</p>

<p>The woman had been about forty-five years of age. The
features, once possessing a measure of beauty, had been coarsened
and lined by a life of dissipation and want. The hair, roughly
bobbed, was sprinkled with grey, and the liberally applied
cosmetics had formed grotesque channels through the action of the
heavy morning dew.</p>

<p>The woman lay on her back, her knees slightly drawn up. Under
her had been strewn a rough bed of rushes, and, for some reason,
the murderer had carefully folded and placed across the lower
part of the body the clothes the woman had worn in life. Her face
was placid, but for a queer twisted smile that curved the thin
bloodless lips.</p>

<p>Nicholls looked at his watch. It was just five o'clock, and
the first rays of the morning sun were lifting above the eastern
horizon. A haze, almost thick enough to be called a fog, hung
over the sandhills, giving the surroundings an effect of long
distances. About three hundred yards north of where the constable
stood the waters of the bay shone intermittently through the
haze.</p>

<p>"They should be here, soon," commented Nicholls, stowing in an
inner pocket the massive silver timepiece he had consulted. Then
he turned to his companion, a long lanky youth of about seventeen
years of age: "There's no work for you t'day, m'lad."</p>

<p>Archie Clarke nodded vacantly, and continued to stare down at
the woman's body.</p>

<p>"She was like that when I found her," he said,
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Likely, lad," replied Nicholls, magisterially, "Them as 'as
been treated as she 'as don't move much after. Leastways, not
till we moves 'em."</p>

<p>"I didn't touch 'er," continued the youth. "'Struth, I didn't.
She's just as I told you I found 'er. I was comin' across that
'ere path, same as I've done every day this year past, to go to
work, when I seed 'er."</p>

<p>"Is it more'n a year, or less'n a year, you've come across
'ere'?" The constable stuck his hands on his hips and frowned
down on his companion. "You've got ter be exact, y' know, in these cases."</p>

<p>Archie looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"You might remember later on," added Nicholls, shaking his
head, sadly. "Go on wi' yer tale, Archie. It ain't many as
remembers th' exact particulars when face ter face wi' th' lor.
Yer 'ave ter be trained to it."</p>

<p>"I've told you all I know about it, Mr. Nicholls," protested
the youth.</p>

<p>"So yer 'ave, an' I writ it all down," replied the constable,
"But it won't 'urt yer t' say it all over agen. You'll tell a
better story when yer comes affore th' magistrate. I does it
m'self. I goes over an' over it agen, an' agen, an' adds a bit
'ere, an' leaves out a bit there, as don't count. Y' don't know
wot you're up agenst. If yer tells it wrong they may even take
yer up for th' murder. They've done it affore, an' they'll do it
agen, I can tell yer."</p>

<p>Nicholls paused, and looked down at his companion, now duly
impressed.</p>

<p>"You're a decent lad, Archie Clarke. I've 'ad me eye on yer
fer some time, you livin', so t' speak, in my district. An' I
makes no complaint, tho' there's them as might seein' th' row you
an' your mates make in Main Street ov a Friday night."</p>

<p>"We don't do no 'arm, Mr. Nicholls," argued Archie.</p>

<p>"P'haps not. So I gives yer a word of advice." Nicholls spoke
authoritatively. "You tells your tale as you told it me, an' as I
writ it down, an' don't yer make no h'errors. When we lays 'ands
on th' bloke as done this, you tells your tale to th' Judge and
jury&mdash;an' th' Loord 'ave mercy on yer soul."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Nicholls," answered Archie cheerfully. "They
won't do anythin' to me, will they? I couldn't 'elp findin'
er."</p>

<p>"Not if yer do as I ses," replied the constable. "An' there's
one thin' more. Beware of them noospaper blokes. They'll be all
over yer, tellin' yer wot a fine feller y'are, an' ow yer
saved the country by findin' this 'ere female. Then, they'll take
yer words an' cut an' twist 'em, an' turn 'em up-side-down an'
yer won't know wot yer sed, an' then th' H'Inspector 'll call yer
a fool, an' worse, an'&mdash;Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The constable sprang to attention as a tall form loomed out of
the mist.</p>

<p>"There you are, Nicholls. Had a devil of a time getting here.
Ah, there she is. Bad case, eh!"</p>

<p>"Very bad, sir. It's&mdash;murder," announced Nicholls
pompously. "This 'ere's the principal witness, sir."</p>

<p>Inspector Richards looked at Archie Clarke, casually; then
nodded.</p>

<p>"I'll hear what you have to say presently, my lad," he said,
brusquely. "You've not touched the body, constable?"</p>

<p>"No one's been down there, sir, 'cept th' murderers. Clarke
and I 'ave stood up 'ere ever since 'e fetched me."</p>

<p>With a nod of approval the Inspector walked down into the
hollow and stood beside the corpse. Bending down he looked,
earnestly, into the still face. Then, silently and methodically,
be circled the body, carefully examining the ground.</p>

<p>"Humph!" Richards climbed on to the high ground, and stood
beside the constable and youth. "You don't seem to have done any
damage, Nicholls. She's dead, so we'll leave things as they are
until the doctor and others arrive. I'm a few minutes ahead of
them."</p>

<p>The Inspector looked down on the dead body, thoughtfully, for
a few seconds. Then he turned briskly to the boy.</p>

<p>"So you are the boy who found her? What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Archie Clarke, sir."</p>

<p>"Where do you live, Clarke?"</p>

<p>"14 Milton Street, Maroubra, sir."</p>

<p>"Good. Now, how did you come to find the body? Speak up,
smartly."</p>

<p>"I've got it all writ down, sir," interposed Nicholls,
importantly.</p>

<p>"Then keep it so," snapped Richards. "We may want it later,
but I'll get my facts first-hand. Now, Clarke, tell your
story."</p>

<p>The constable stepped back, somewhat abashed. Archie Clarke
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Get on with it, boy. You say you live at Maroubra. Well, how
did you come to be on these sandhills so early in the
morning?"</p>

<p>"I come across 'ere every morning', sir."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To go to work."</p>

<p>"Early or late, this morning?"</p>

<p>"'Bout usual time, sir. I leaves 'ome about 'arf-past three
an' gets there about four. I shall be late this mornin'."</p>

<p>"Afraid you will." Richards smiled, grimly.</p>

<p>"What's your job, Archie?"</p>

<p>"Milk round, Walker's Dairy, Randwick. Can I go now? Mr.
Walker told me not to be long."</p>

<p>"Not unless you take Constable Nicholls with you, my lad. Do
you think he would look pretty on the cart. No, I can see you
don't. For the present you'd better stick close to the constable.
Later, you may be able to go home or go to work, just as you
please. Now, lets get your tale straight. Your name is Archie
Clarke; you live at Maroubra, and you work for Mr. Walker, a
dairyman, at Randwick. Then you said you come across this track
every morning between three-thirty and four o'clock. That
right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then how did you come to see this woman? You can't see into
this hollow from that track?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't walkin' right on th' track sir," replied the youth.
"Just alongside, an' I saw some ov them things flutterin'. So I
came over to see what it was&mdash;an' then I saw 'er."</p>

<p>The youth hesitated.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Archie," urged the Inspector kindly. "What did you
do then?"</p>

<p>"Ran all the way to Mr. Walker's, an' told 'im."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Walker rang up the police station an' told 'em. Then,
when Mr. Nicholls came, he told me to bring 'im 'ere. An' I
did."</p>

<p>"That lets you out," observed the Inspector. "Wait a
moment."</p>

<p>Richards left the pair and walked over to the track. There he
carefully scanned the ground, walking along the pad a
considerable distance both ways.</p>

<p>"Quite right, Archie," he said, when he returned to the edge
of the hollow. "When I've heard the constable's report I may be
able to indulge your secret passion for work. Yes,
constable."</p>

<p>"Robert Nicholls, constable, number 41,593, stationed at
Randwick, sir." Nicholls drew himself up erect, and spoke in a
severely official voice. "At 4.10 a.m. received instructions from
Sergeant Appleby to go to Mr. Walker, a dairyman, at Randwick, in
reference to a case of suspected murder. At Mr. Walker's saw
witness, Archie Clarke, who stated he had found the dead body of
a woman on the sandhills near Little Bay. I accompanied him to
the spot indicated and investigated, sir."</p>

<p>"Your investigations taking the form of mounting guard,"
commented Richards, drily. "I admire your discretion,
constable."</p>

<p>"I was examining the witness, sir." Nicholls assumed an air of
injured rectitude. "Then I was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is as well I arrived before the examination
concluded," observed the Inspector, grimly. "There seems to be
few clues as it is, and if you had commenced tramping the ground
down there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's that?" Archie Clarke was pointing over the sandhills
to where the indistinct form of a man clad in a long white coat
loomed out of the mist. He was acting in a very peculiar manner,
stooping low, and dodging from bush to bush.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" shouted Nicholls, importantly.</p>

<p>The man halted, and dropped behind a clump of bushes. For some
minutes the officers strained their eyes to see where he had gone
to. Presently Clarke touched the Inspector on the arm, and
pointed well away to the right. Richards caught a glimpse of a
white coat vanishing around a clump of rushes. Beckoning to his
companions, Richards led the way towards where the man had
disappeared. Again Clarke pointed to the right. The man was
evidently circling to get to the place where the woman's body
lay.</p>

<p>"Halt, or I fire," Nicholls rushed forward, tugging at his
revolver.</p>

<p>The man gave a swift look round and then started to run,
curving around in the direction of Randwick.</p>

<p>"You damned fool," muttered Richards, angrily. "If you had
kept your ugly mouth shut in the first place he would have walked
into our arms. Come on, he's getting away from us."</p>

<p>It was heavy running on the loose sand. Nicholls plodded
heavily along in the rear, groaning and spluttering. Clarke,
younger and lighter, drew steadily ahead, and noticeably gained
on the fugitive.</p>

<p>"There's a road over there," panted Nicholls, heavily.</p>

<p>"What's the good of that?" shouted the Inspector, testily. "A
road's not a wall. It's up to that boy. He can run."</p>

<p>The fugitive breasted a steep sandhill that slowed the
pursuing officers to a walk. Archie Clarke made up a lot of
ground on the climb, and was only half a dozen yards in the rear
when the man reached the summit. There, the man turned and waved
a derisive farewell to his pursuers, and slid out of sight.</p>

<p>The Inspector struggled gamely up the loose, shifting sand,
confident that when he reached the top he would have his quarry
under observation into the town. Once there he halted and looked
around. The man had disappeared.</p>

<p>At the feet of the officer lay Archie Clarke, insensible, and
bleeding from an ugly head wound.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="first">RUGH THORNTON tilted his chair back and hoisted
his feet on to his desk. Business was slack, and the afternoon's
<i>Star</i> interesting.</p>

<p>Twelve month's previous Rugh had been a member of the
<i>Star's</i> staff. Investigations he had made into the
activities of certain assurance company-promoters had attracted
the attention of leading men of the assurance world. He had
received an offer from a syndicate of the leading assurance
companies to enter their employ and carry on his investigation
work, and had promptly accepted. His work was interesting. Every
new assurance company came under his review, and his keen insight
into their methods and objects, as well as into the history of
the men behind them, had resulted in making New South Wales
unsafe for the unscrupulous insurance company promoter, and
wild-cat companies.</p>

<p>The <i>Star's</i> account of the finding of a woman's naked
body on the sandhills around Little Bay was extremely brief and
pointless. Rugh was puzzled, for the <i>Star's</i> criminal
investigator, Harry Sutherland, was a keen and clever journalist,
usually well ahead of official investigations.</p>

<p>In the matter of the Little Bay Mystery the <i>Star</i> had
taken a scrupulously official viewpoint. No attempt had been made
at an independent newspaper investigation, and the impression
conveyed was that the Little Bay Murder was one of the sordid
crimes common to large cities.</p>

<p>The well-trained brain of the assurance investigator refused
to consider the murder in the aspect presented by the <i>Star</i>
report. There were many unexplained points that puzzled him.</p>

<p>The woman's body had been stripped. It was not uncommon for
murderers to strip their victims in the search for valuables of
one kind or another. Yet the police were confident the woman was
one of the "lost sisters" of the city, and unlikely to have
anything of value on her person.</p>

<p>Again, while the body had been stripped, the clothes had not
been thrown about haphazard, but had been carefully folded and
placed on the body. This, alone, presented a problem of an
original character. Few murderers are sufficiently cool-headed to
spare time and thought for such actions.</p>

<p>The man seen by the police in the vicinity of the dead woman,
almost immediately after the discovery of the body, presented
another problem. If the woman was one of the "lost sisters" of
the city, and had been murdered by this man, why should he hang
around the spot? Murderers usually place a considerable distance
between themselves and their crimes, as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>While the official report strove to show the Little Bay murder
as a common, sordid crime, it could not conceal the unusual
nature of the surroundings. The report laid great stress on the
doctor's report that the woman had been kicked to death, as
supporting their theory of thug-murder, but neglected to explain
the stripping of the body, the careful disposal of the clothes,
and the return of the supposed murderer to the scene of his
crime.</p>

<p>Rugh laid the newspaper aside with an exclamation of
displeasure. It was a mystery that would have appealed to him
during his journalistic career. He would have thrown himself,
heart and soul, into the hunt, combing Sydney's underworld from
end to end.</p>

<p>Those days had passed. The greater tragedies of the city were
not for him. He had his work in the protection of a branch of the
city's commerce. In the hunt for the murderer in the Little Bay
mystery he was now but one of the great public who stand and
watch the passing show.</p>

<p>Not altogether. Harry Sutherland, the criminal investigator on
the <i>Star's</i> staff, was his personal friend. Harry would
willingly give him inside information and discuss the mystery
with him.</p>

<p>Rugh caught up the telephone. The girl at the <i>Star's</i>
switchboard recognised his voice, and under a minute he was
speaking to his friend.</p>

<p>"Rugh Thornton, by the favour of the gods," ejaculated Harry,
on listening in. "The one man I wanted. I was going to hunt you
up this afternoon, old man."</p>

<p>"Hunt round my office, now," invited the assurance man. "I'm
not running away. How long will you be?"</p>

<p>"Five minutes," replied Harry, reaching for his hat.
"Dinkum."</p>

<p>Less than five minutes later the <i>Star</i> man entered
Rugh's offices and deposited his long length in the most
comfortable chair he could find. Then he took off the
high-powered spectacles he wore and polished the lenses carefully.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Harry?" asked Rugh. The careful polishing
of the glasses was an unfailing sign of worry with Harry
Sutherland.</p>

<p>"Same inquiry from the <i>Star</i> man," retorted Harry. "As
you beat me to the 'phone, suppose you spill first."</p>

<p>"All right," replied Rugh, indifferently. "I want the correct
dope on the Little Bay Mystery."</p>

<p>"Read the <i>Star</i>. All the winners, spiced with political
scandals, and the dinkum official dope on births, marriages,
divorces, and sudden deaths."</p>

<p>"Since when has the <i>Star</i> assumed the role of official
apologists for the N.S.W. Police Force?" asked Rugh,
sarcastically.</p>

<p>Harry pulled out his watch and studied it. Then he gave his
crop of unruly black hair a characteristic rake.</p>

<p>"A little over three and a half hours," he replied with a
cheerful grin. "To be exact, since the noon edition, a copy of
which I see on your desk."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Are you interested, old man?"</p>

<p>"Intensely. I am interested to know when Harry Sutherland lost
his punch."</p>

<p>"Your people expect you to take an interest in claims against
them?" asked Harry, ignoring the assurance man's question.</p>

<p>"Occasionally. You know they run claim inspectors for that
work."</p>

<p>"Yet, they are liable to call on you?"</p>

<p>"They might. In the event of their regular men falling down on
it."</p>

<p>"They have called on you to investigate claims?"</p>

<p>"What are you driving at, Harry?" asked Rugh, impatiently.
"Yes, if you want to know, they have called on my services.
Twice."</p>

<p>"Thought so. And they'll call again?"</p>

<p>"Possibly. Get on with your beans, you ass."</p>

<p>"Say, in the event of a mysterious murder?"</p>

<p>Rugh was silent a minute. Then he got out of his chair and
strode over to where Harry was seated. "There's something on your
mind," he commanded. "Spill it."</p>

<p>"The Little Bay Murder."</p>

<p>"Do you suggest any of my companies are likely to be concerned
in the matter?" Rugh asked, speaking deliberately. "Your account
of the police investigations presumes the murder to be of an
ordinary type and likely to be quickly solved by the
authorities."</p>

<p>"Think so?" Harry pulled out a well-seasoned briar pipe and
earnestly explored the interior. "Nothing in that account that
strikes you as&mdash;well, strange?"</p>

<p>Rugh looked at his friend, closely. Harry was intent on his
pipe.</p>

<p>"Only that you wrote it," he said at length.</p>

<p>"So." The journalist carefully pieced his pipe together.
"There's a Chink, calling itself a Scot, in our office."</p>

<p>"Name McAdoo." The investigator returned to his seat. "What's
his latest?"</p>

<p>"Damned if I know." Harry reached out a long arm and
commandeered Rugh's tobacco pouch. "He called me on the carpet
this morning. Informed me space was valuable, and that an
experienced journalist would not require more than a half-column
for so trite an affair as the Little Bay murder."</p>

<p>Rugh laughed.</p>

<p>"I guess the 'experienced journalist' had something to
say?"</p>

<p>"Said a lot, and all to the point, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was informed, somewhat brutally, that three-quarters of the
journalists of the Commonwealth were eager to jump into the
position of investigator to the <i>Star</i> newspaper. Eh?"</p>

<p>"You might have been behind the door." Harry pulled
vigorously, and inquisitively, at his pipe.</p>

<p>"Interesting," commented Rugh.</p>

<p>"Damned interesting." Harry hit the arm of his chair with his
open hand, angrily. "I'm coupling that up with a conversation I
heard an hour or so previous. No, you old flathead, I wasn't
snooping in the office. You know what the 'phone service is
there. Wires all of a tangle, and when you cut in you're likely
to get anything from the Governor-General to an electric shock. I
got McAdoo."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Heard two sentences before I realised I was snooping. They
were: 'The police statements are all I require published.' That
was a stranger speaking. Then McAdoo's sweet tones, super-oiled,
replied: 'That will be difficult to arrange, Mr. Brene. But if
you insist, of course I will do my best.'"</p>

<p>"Sam Brene!" Rugh whistled softly. "You are sure it was the
murder they were discussing, Harry?"</p>

<p>"It links up." Harry blew out a cloud of thick evil-smelling
smoke. "Story killed, on top of what I overheard. No other police
matter in the paper of moment, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I didn't handle McAdoo any too gently when he called me off,"
confessed the journalist. "It got me on the raw, and&mdash;well,
it's the best thing I've had since I took over your job on the
<i>Star</i>. I asked McAdoo, straight, what Brene's interest in
the matter was."</p>

<p>"Good. You've got a nerve, all right. What did he answer?"</p>

<p>"Stalled badly, of course. The old man can't keep a straight
face when he's cornered. Asked what I meant, and looked as
confused as a flapper when handed an ice-cream instead of a
cocktail."</p>

<p>"Seems reasonable," remarked Rugh, after some minutes'
reflection. "Now, where do I come in?"</p>

<p>"Sam Brene's not too far off when there's money floating
around," answered the <i>Star</i> man, shortly. "You know his
record. Boss of the Town Hall, jury fixer, and king of the
grafters' brigade."</p>

<p>"You're guessing a lot, old man."</p>

<p>"I am." Harry abandoned his air of carelessness, and leaned
forward earnestly. "I'm guessing it all. I'm guessing that within
twenty-four hours you will be on the trail of the Little Bay
murderer, with a stake in the game worth playing for."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="first">HARRY SUTHERLAND'S insistence that he would
shortly be officially interested in the Little Bay Murder case
much perplexed Rugh Thornton. It seemed improbable that the
violent death of one of Sydney's "lost sisters" should have any
connection with the syndicate of assurance companies employing
him. It was possible the woman had been insured for a small
amount in one of the companies specialising in low priced
policies, but in that event the assurance would be paid without
demur. The amount would be too trivial to fight over.</p>

<p>Rugh had a great respect for the abilities of the <i>Star</i>
investigator. Harry had a reputation in the journalistic world
that was unquestioned. His report of the telephone conversation
between Sam Brene and the <i>Star's</i> Chief of Staff was
disturbing, though it might not apply to the murder mystery. At
any rate, it showed that the Town Hall boss had a string tied on
the newspaper.</p>

<p>The next morning Rugh went down to the Criminal Investigation
Branch of the New South Wales Police and asked for Inspector
Richards. At times he had come in close contact with the police
officer and had learned to respect his undoubted abilities.</p>

<p>"You interested in the Little Bay Murder?" exclaimed Richards,
when he heard Rugh's errand. "There's nothing in the case that
can possibly touch the interests of your companies, Thornton.
Why, the woman was one of the type you meet by hundreds in the
poorer quarters of the city."</p>

<p>"You have traced her, Richards?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing. Wasn't a difficult matter." The Inspector drew a
photograph from his pocket. "Do you know her?"</p>

<p>Rugh shook his head. It was not probable he would have come
across such a woman in circumstances that would cause him to
remember her. He took the photograph, and studied the pictured
face. The woman had once possessed some little claim to beauty,
and death, most merciful, had wiped away the coarsening lines of
years of evil living.</p>

<p>"Didn't think you would," continued Richards. "Still,
newspaper men run up against some queer people in their work.
We've got a line on her. Found her husband, and got that photo
from him. It's five years old, and she's aged a lot in the
time."</p>

<p>"Her husband?" exclaimed Rugh. "Quick work, that,
Richards."</p>

<p>"Not so slow, I think." The Inspector appeared to be well
satisfied with himself. "He couldn't give us much. Hadn't seen
the lady for four or five years. She left him, and went on her
own."</p>

<p>"What about the husband?" asked the investigator.</p>

<p>"A decent, hard-working chap," replied the Inspector. "A bit
of a pal of one of our chaps at Headquarters. Carpenter by trade,
and has a good character from his employers. No, he's let out of
it."</p>

<p>"You say she left him. What for?" Rugh was probing for a
motive for the murder.</p>

<p>"Not fast enough, s'pose." Richards spoke carelessly. "You'd
be surprised how many women in that walk of life give their
hubbies the 'good-bye.' Life's too strenuous for them. They read
in the papers of Jazz parties and surfing, and late suppers and
flickers. It makes 'em discontented; cookin' hubby's tea and
breakfast, and washing up after him, has no excitement."</p>

<p>"I had no idea you were a social reformer, Richards," laughed
Rugh. "You're almost eloquent."</p>

<p>"Most of our chaps are," retorted the Inspector, soberly.
"It's from this woman's class most of the serious crime comes.
Take this little lady&mdash;Ruth Collins is her name. She gets
discontented with her husband, and her life. Takes a drop to
cheer her up. Along comes another chap, single, and with a bit of
dough. Throws it about, and boasts what a good time he'll give
his girl."</p>

<p>"So the lady falls?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing." Richards waved a hand, vaguely, "It's a choice
between drudgery and what's called a life of pleasure. Off goes
madam on the time-payment system."</p>

<p>"What the&mdash;" Rugh stared at the officer, amazedly.</p>

<p>"What else can you call it?" demanded Richards. "She goes with
the man on the chance time will clear hubby out of the road.
Sometimes time is kind, and the loving couple get married, and
quarrel ever after. Let me tell you, my boy, I've come across a
good many of these ladies in my time. They're honey itself to
their lovers, while hubby's alive. Lord, if they'd given their
legitimate mates half the sugar they waste on other men, married
life would be a garden of Eden."</p>

<p>"Get back to Ruth Collins," suggested Rugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, in her case hubby was too much in love with life. A
hectic year or so, and the lover disappeared. Ruth couldn't go
back and hubby couldn't afford a divorce. So there was another
lover. It's that, or ill paid factory work."</p>

<p>"Finally?" queried the investigator.</p>

<p>"The streets. Believe what you like, Thornton, I've got a big
sympathy with our 'lost sisters.' Life's damned hard on them.
Virtue's its own reward, and there's damned few pleasures
scattered on the straight and narrow path."</p>

<p>"Inspector Richards preaches an immoral sermon," murmured the
investigator. "I take it, the identification of Ruth is the
extent of police knowledge, at present?"</p>

<p>"Practically," admitted Richards, honestly, "It's early days
to form theories. Why, we can't even get a dear description of
the man who knocked down the boy, Archie Clarke. And I saw him
with my own eyes."</p>

<p>"How is Clarke?"</p>

<p>"Improving quickly. Got a nasty bump on the head. Lucky for
him it was a slanting blow, but that wasn't the fault of our
white-coated friend. He hit for murder, damned vicious
scoundrel."</p>

<p>Rugh looked down at the photograph of the murdered woman he
had held during the conversation. "May I keep this, Richards?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Sure. But what's your game, Thornton. Thought you were
employed to guard vested interests. This dead woman isn't likely
to cause a run on the coffers of your assurance companies."</p>

<p>"More unlikely things might happen," said the assurance man,
lightly. "No one has put in a claim on her behalf, yet, but one
never knows."</p>

<p>"If that happens the company may offer a private reward for
the apprehension of the murderer," chaffed the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Possibly. Would it be a gift for the police force?" Richards
became grave.</p>

<p>"We shall get that man, Thornton," he said. "There's few of
'em who succeed in baffling us."</p>

<p>"Look here, Richards." Rugh made up his mind to test Harry
Sutherland's information. "Is there a string on this
inquiry?"</p>

<p>The Inspector looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"You can guess what I mean," continued Rugh. "It would not be
the first time some influence has stepped in between a criminal
and justice. Are you chaps after the murderer for all you, and
the department, are worth?"</p>

<p>The Inspector flushed with anger.</p>

<p>"If I didn't guess you had a good reason behind your question,
Thornton, I should resent it," he said, sternly.</p>

<p>"I've got a reason, and a good one," replied Rugh, calmly.
"I'm not saying the string is on you, but&mdash;is it on the
Department?"</p>

<p>"If there's a string anywhere it won't affect me, and I handle
this case. If I thought the N.S.W. police force was out to shield
a murderer, I'd resign."</p>

<p>"I believe you," exclaimed Rugh, impulsively, holding out his
hand.</p>

<p>"You had a reason for your question?" asked Richards,
quickly.</p>

<p>Briefly, Rugh recounted Harry Sutherland's tale of the
overheard telephone conversation between the <i>Star's</i> Chief
of Staff and Sam Brene. The police officer listened,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I am not going to say there have not been attempts made to
tie strings on to the police," he remarked, when Rugh finished.
"Politics, to-day, is a game of string pulling. More than once
big influence has been used to protect criminals&mdash;and not
always has that influence utterly failed."</p>

<p>The Inspector paused, and looked steadily at the assurance
investigator.</p>

<p>"But, not in murder cases." he continued, passionately.
"Murderers stand alone, against the whole police force. Sam Brene
may have a pull in the <i>Star</i> office. More than likely he
has. But, he has no pull with Edward Richards, Inspector of
Police. Take that from me."</p>

<p>Rugh strolled down to his offices, thinking deeply of his
interview with Inspector Richards. The theory advanced by Harry
Sutherland, that he would be mixed up in the Little Bay Murder
seemed so remote as to be absurd.</p>

<p>His clerk met him as he entered his offices.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilbur Orchard, of the Balmain and South Assurance
Company, telephoned an hour ago that he would be glad to see you
immediately," said the boy. Then he added, in a half-whisper:
"Said it was in reference to the Little Bay Murder."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="first">THE SUMMONS to the Balmain and South Assurance
Company astonished the investigator. He had laughed when Harry
Sutherland affirmed he would be involved, officially, in the
Little Bay Murder, within a short time. Now had come a request to
attend the managing director of the largest and wealthiest of the
companies retaining his services. That request had been coupled
with the direct intimation that the Little Bay Murder would be
the subject of the interview.</p>

<p>Leaving his offices, abruptly, Rugh went down to the assurance
company in Elizabeth Street. Wilbur Orchard was awaiting him,
striding agitatedly up and down his room. When Rugh entered the
private office he came to meet him with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Glad you were able to come right away," he said, curtly. "I
rang up directly I knew the tangle we were in. Sit down, Mr.
Thornton."</p>

<p>Rugh looked curiously at the managing director of the Balmain
and South. Although that company was a prominent member of the
syndicate he served, this was the first time he had come in touch
with Wilbur Orchard, its controlling genius. He saw a short,
thickset man of about fifty years of age. The face was square,
clean-shaven, and dominated by a forceful chin. Prominent
eyebrows, thickly sprinkled with grey, shaded keen grey-blue
eyes. The forehead was high, and surmounted by closely cropped
hair, almost white.</p>

<p>"Curiously, I have been making a few enquiries into the Little
Bay Murder this morning," replied Rugh.</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard turned abruptly to face the assurance
investigator.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"A journalist friend is on the case for his newspaper. His
statements of certain aspects of the case aroused my curiosity."
Rugh spoke formally. He rather resented the autocratic tone of
the question.</p>

<p>"That all?" Wilbur Orchard crossed to his desk and sat down.
"Sorry if I am somewhat abrupt this morning. Had some news that
upset me."</p>

<p>"I presume it is because of that news you sent for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Wilbur Orchard fumbled on his desk for a few moments.
Then he passed a postcard-size photograph across to Rugh. "Know
that woman?"</p>

<p>"Ruth Collins, the woman who was murdered two days ago on the
sandhills at Little Bay." Rugh smiled, and produced from his
pocket a similar photograph. "I am curious to know where you
obtained your copy of the photograph, Mr. Orchard. When I was
given my copy I was informed only a few copies had been
printed."</p>

<p>"Never mind that. Yes, I will tell you. I sent over to the
Inspector-General for it."</p>

<p>"You must have had a very strong reason for so unusual an
action," commented Rugh.</p>

<p>"I had. I believe this company is to be the object of a
deliberate fraud."</p>

<p>"Is to be," repeated Rugh. "Then any scheme to defraud has not
yet been put in operation?"</p>

<p>"Not so far as we are aware of." Wilbur Orchard picked up a
panel photograph from his desk and handed it to the assurance
investigator. "Do you know that woman?"</p>

<p>It was the portrait of a girl in her early twenties. Rugh
thought he had never seen a more beautiful face. The steadfast
eyes looked out from a pure, oval face, framed in a wealth of
wavy hair drawn low over the forehead. A slender, rounded, neck
held the beautiful head proudly on well-shaped shoulders. The
dress was short, revealing graceful legs, slender ankles, and
well-formed feet.</p>

<p>"No." Rugh surrendered the photograph, reluctantly. "If your
story connects these two photographs it will be, indeed,
strange."</p>

<p>"It does." Wilbur Orchard leaned forward across his desk,
drumming on the wood with the tips of his fingers. "Are these
photographs of the same woman?"</p>

<p>Rugh looked up, startled.</p>

<p>"What exactly do you mean, Mr. Orchard?" he asked,
deliberately.</p>

<p>"Answer my question. Would you take these photographs to be of
the same person?"</p>

<p>"No." The assurance investigator spoke emphatically. "No sane
person would suggest such a thing."</p>

<p>"I believe within a very short time such a claim will be made
on this office." Wilbur Orchard smiled grimly as he spoke. "In
fact, I have received information to that effect."</p>

<p>"You wish me to understand a claim will be made on this office
for an assurance on Ruth Collins, the woman murdered at Little
Bay?" asked Rugh, incredulously. "You know the history of that
woman?"</p>

<p>"The Inspector-General sent over certain details. Her husband
is a carpenter. She left him, lived with other men up to the time
or her death. Do you know more?"</p>

<p>"No. You have all the information at present available. Such a
woman would hardly be assured for a sum worth fighting
about?"</p>

<p>"Do you call two hundred thousand pounds a trifle, Mr.
Thornton?" Wilbur Orchard uttered the words in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Two hundred thousand pounds!" Rugh stared at the managing
director amazedly. "Do you mean to say that woman was assured in
your office to that amount?"</p>

<p>"I have not made such a statement." Wilbur Orchard became
peculiarly calm. "I said a claim for that amount will probably be
made on this company, within a few days. Perhaps I had better
tell you the story in proper sequence. I intend to fight that
claim, with your assistance, Thornton."</p>

<p>Turning to a wall safe behind his chair, Wilbur Orchard took
out a bundle of papers, and opened them on his desk.</p>

<p>"Twelve years ago the Balmain and South Assurance Company was
young and struggling." commenced the managing director. "We had
only a small capital and assurance was difficult to write. Money
was scarce at that time. It became necessary to raise a sum of
fifty thousand pounds. Applications to the banks were
unsuccessful. A financial house offered an accommodation, but the
terms were extortionate. We had almost decided, however, we must
accept these terms when an offer of the sum we required came from
a private source."</p>

<p>The assurance director turned over the papers on his desk and
selected a legal looking document.</p>

<p>"The offer came from a Mr. Colin Carson, of Roxine Chambers,
Pitt Street, Sydney. He described himself as a financier. The
offer was a good one."</p>

<p>Again Wilbur Orchard paused, and consulted the document he
held.</p>

<p>"The terms were extremely good," he continued. "Unusual in
some particulars, I will grant, but faced with the alternative of
paying nearly seven times the interest per annum and hampering
conditions, from the financial house we had been negotiating
with, my fellow directors agreed with me that our best course was
to close immediately with Mr. Carson's offer, and ignore anything
unusual."</p>

<p>"Wait," exclaimed Wilbur Orchard, as Rugh was about to speak.
"There was a condition Mr. Carson insisted on having inserted in
the deed, although we assured him we did not require the money
for more than a few months; six at the outside. He stipulated
that if the money was not repaid to him, personally, or to his
heirs, personally, on the due date, the interest should
automatically increase by one per cent for every year the loan
was outstanding, and interest at the same rate be paid on all
interest due."</p>

<p>"The interest for the second year would be seven per cent.,"
suggested Rugh.</p>

<p>"Precisely. For the third year, eight per cent., and so on. Of
course, a like interest would be payable on the interest
outstanding."</p>

<p>"Your directors made no objection to so unusual a condition?"
asked Rugh.</p>

<p>"We never contemplated the possibility of the loan standing
longer than twelve months," replied Orchard.</p>

<p>"From your remarks I judge the loan has not yet been repaid,"
said Rugh. "With a company as financially strong as the Balmain
and South I am surprised. The interest to-day must be very
large."</p>

<p>"Last years interest on the accumulated sum of the loan was at
the rate of seventeen per cent. As you have stated, the loan has
never been repaid."</p>

<p>"For what reason, Mr. Orchard?"</p>

<p>"The absence of the lender. He disappeared. At the end of the
first twelve months I wrote to the address given in the deed,
informing Mr. Carson the company proposed to repay the loan on
due date."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"That letter was returned to me, by the Postal authorities,
marked 'addressee unknown.'"</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="first">"YOU MEAN to say Mr. Carson left Sydney without
advising you where he was going, and did not return?" asked Rugh,
perplexedly.</p>

<p>"Exactly." Wilbur Orchard had lost the air of irritableness
that had characterised him during the first part of the
interview, and now spoke with the direct crispness of the
successful business man. "We made every endeavour to find him.
Advertised. Employed detectives, but to no purpose. He literally
vanished from the face of the earth."</p>

<p>"Leaving behind him the sum of fifty thousand pounds!" said
Rugh, astonished.</p>

<p>"Considerably more than that," corrected the insurance
director. "There was interest due, amounting to three thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>"I take it that your directors were anxious to repay the loan
at the end of the first year?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Wilbur Orchard smiled slightly. "You must remember that
there would be a further amount of compound interest, at the rate
of seven per cent., falling due the following year, if we failed
to make the repayment at the time stated. Seven per cent. on a
loan not required is good money thrown away."</p>

<p>"The loan agreement does not provide for the absence of the
lender?" asked Rugh. He was seeking a motive for the peculiar
business methods of Colin Carson.</p>

<p>"The direct stipulation provided for in the loan deed required
that repayment must be made to the lender, or in the event of his
death to his heirs, personally."</p>

<p>"It would be open to the Company to apply to the Courts to
presume the death of Mr. Carson," said the assurance
investigator.</p>

<p>"That action must, undoubtedly, be taken at an early date."
The managing director shifted, uneasily, in his seat. "Do you
realise, Mr. Thornton, that we are compelled to provide interest
on the compounded total of the loan at the rate of seventeen per
cent. It's enormous. This last year we had to set aside out of
our profits a sum of over £23,000 as interest on this loan. At
the interest for next year&mdash;18 per cent.&mdash;we shall be
liable for a sum considerably over £30,000. A few years and the
yearly interest will rapidly exceed the original capital sum.</p>

<p>"Why have you allowed the total to amount up in this way?"
Rugh asked, curiously. "It would have been but common sense to go
to the Courts for relief&mdash;to presume the death of the
lender, and pay the money into some fund&mdash;years ago."</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard hesitated, before replying.</p>

<p>"To the average man such action would appear most natural. But
great organisations, such as the Balmain and South, exist on too
precarious a commercial plane. You would be surprised, Mr.
Thornton, if you were told the large sums of money a company such
as this parts with every year rather than go to law. Cases the
average commercial man would fight tooth and nail are compounded
by us. Our business is too complicated and insecure to allow of
law publicity."</p>

<p>"Insecure?" Rugh thought of the millions held in reserve by
the assurance companies in Australia, alone.</p>

<p>"Yes. Insecure. We must be continually seeking new business,
and from a fickle public. If we made a practice of resisting
claims made on us we should quickly forfeit public favour. The
statement would be broadcast that we were resisting legitimate
claims, and a large quantity of the new business would go to our
competitors."</p>

<p>Rugh thought deeply for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"You are asking a difficult thing, Mr. Orchard," he said, at
length. "From what you tell me the trail is so old I shall have
great difficulty in finding people who may have come in contact
with Colin Carson. For instance, the solicitors who drew up the
loan deed?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Carson asked that our solicitors should do that."</p>

<p>"Still, they must have interviewed him, as to details?"</p>

<p>"Weston, Sons and Hamilton, are our solicitors." Again Wilbur
Orchard answered hesitatingly. "I believe Mr. Hamilton attended
to the matter personally. He looked after our business. I regret
to say he died some years ago."</p>

<p>"I presume you conducted the preliminary negotiations for the
loan," said Rugh.</p>

<p>"I did. Mr. Carson called on me at this office twice. Other
details were arranged by letter."</p>

<p>"Then you should be able to give a fairly accurate description
of the man."</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard laughed, shortly.</p>

<p>"There you have me at a disadvantage, Mr. Thornton," he
exclaimed. "When Mr. Carson came to see me he was muffled up to
the eyes. Said he was suffering from a severe attack of
influenza, and he certainly looked like it. When I mentioned the
matter to Mr. Weston he informed me he had caught but a glimpse
of Mr. Carson when he called at his offices and he was then
muffled in the same manner."</p>

<p>"But you can surely give me some description of the man?"
exclaimed Rugh, in surprise.</p>

<p>The assurance director turned to the papers on his desk.</p>

<p>"The detectives we employed asked of me the same thing," he
remarked, picking out a paper. "Here is the description of Colin
Carson I drew up then. You will remember it was drawn up some
years ago, so it is more likely to be accurate than my memory
to-day."</p>

<p>Slipping on his glasses, Wilbur Orchard commenced to read
slowly.</p>

<p>"Height, nearly six feet, very thin. Bald in front. Hair,
scanty and black. High forehead. Eyebrows, thin and straight.
Eyes, very dark brown, enlarged pupils. Nose, Roman. Remainder of
face covered by thick woollen muffler. Voice, very husky and low,
due to severe influenza attack. Hands, encased in thick woollen
gloves, dark grey. Wore a heavy dark brown overcoat, with big
collar; turned up. Kept it buttoned while in my office. Trousers,
dark grey, indefinite pattern. Boots, lace-up, black. Carried an
umbrella with an ivory skull as handle."</p>

<p>"Umbrella with ivory skull handle," repeated Rugh. "There's
not many of them about."</p>

<p>"You must remember I am speaking of at least ten years ago,"
reminded Wilbur Orchard. "That umbrella is, no doubt, destroyed
by this time. By the way, there is one thing I remember now I did
not tell the detectives. The man had a mole high up on the left
cheek-bone."</p>

<p>Rugh finished his notes and placed them in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Orchard," he said, "we will go back to the two
photographs. You asked me if I could trace any resemblance
between them. What reason had you for such a question?"</p>

<p>"I thought you would come back to that," remarked the
assurance director, with a smile. "Before I answer I should
inform you of a conversation I had with Mr. Carson prior to the
completion of the loan."</p>

<p>The managing director fidgeted with his papers for a while,
and then continued:</p>

<p>"When Mr. Carson informed me of the terms he proposed I was
somewhat taken aback. In particular, I questioned the clauses
relating to the repayment of the loan. The fact of retaining the
money for twelve months at the low rate of interest proposed was
acceptable, although we had anticipated making the repayment in
three or four months. I may say here, the terms proposed by the
financial house we approached were, for three months' loan, at
the rate of ten per cent."</p>

<p>"For the three months?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I questioned, particularly, the personal repayment
clause. Mr. Carson would not give way. In conversation he stated
he had a daughter, a schoolgirl, and that he had no other
relatives. In the event of his death within the twelve months the
money would be repayable to the trustees of his child."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Carson say where the child was? If she was at school,
or where?" asked Rugh.</p>

<p>"He promised me full particulars at a later date.
Unfortunately the matter slipped my memory."</p>

<p>The assurance director hesitated, and then added:</p>

<p>"You will understand, Mr. Thornton, an institution, such as
the Balmain and South was at that time, can use any amount of
capital. Six, seven, and even ten per cent. are reasonable
interests in building up a large business. Once we realised we
were out of touch with Mr. Carson we allowed the matter to drift.
It was inexcusable of us, I admit, but we thought Mr. Carson
might turn up at any time, and we could come to some arrangement
in regard to the accumulated and increased interest. It was only
when the interest began to mount up abnormally, we began to get
anxious."</p>

<p>"Then you have no knowledge of the daughter?"</p>

<p>"None, whatever."</p>

<p>"Yet you connect her, in some way, with the woman who was
murdered on the sandhills at Little Bay. So far as I can see, Mr.
Orchard, there are no grounds for such connection."</p>

<p>"You can see no likeness between the two women?" Wilbur
Orchard asked the question, anxiously.</p>

<p>"There is no likeness. You have forgotten the big difference
in ages."</p>

<p>"They are not the same women?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yet I have been advised, by telephone, that a call will
shortly be made on this Company for the repayment of the Carson
Loan."</p>

<p>"That in no way connects the two women." Rugh spoke
impatiently. The man before him appeared wishful to conceal
information he had.</p>

<p>"I asked, over the 'phone, if I was speaking to Colin Carson,
and received a reply in the negative. I then asked if my
informant was speaking on behalf of Colin Carson's heiress."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>A brutal laugh came to my ears over the wire. Then the voice
said: "Oh, she's on the sandhills at Little Bay!"</p>

<p>"You asked who was speaking?"</p>

<p>"Twice. The first time the question was ignored; the second
time the answer was: 'You'll know soon enough.'"</p>

<p>"Did you recognise the voice? Have you any remembrance of it?
Was it a man, or a woman, speaking?" Rugh asked the questions
rapidly.</p>

<p>"A man spoke. I seem to have a recollection of the voice, but
at present I cannot place it."</p>

<p>"When did this conversation take place?"</p>

<p>"This morning," replied the managing director, his face
blanching. "I had been reading about the murder coming in on the
train. Immediately I telephoned for you."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="first">WHO WAS the man who had telephoned Wilbur
Orchard informing him a demand would shortly be made on the
Balmain and South Assurance Company for the repayment of the
Carson loan? Wilbur Orchard had stated he believed an attempt was
to be made to defraud the Company and explained the telephone
message as a piece of bravado on the part of one of the gang.</p>

<p>Rugh could not accept this theory. The reference to the
heiress of Colin Carson being "on the sandhills at Little Bay"
puzzled him. Was it an attempt to induce the belief that the
murdered woman was Colin Carson's heiress?</p>

<p>Harry Sutherland's assertion that he would shortly be
interested, officially, in the Little Bay Murder appeared to bear
out this theory. On the other hand, Rugh could not trace any
resemblance between the photographs or the murdered woman and
Colin Carson's daughter, and some general likeness was necessary
to support the mysterious telephone message that Colin Carson's
heiress would be found "on the sandhills at Little Bay."</p>

<p>Returning to his offices Rugh telephoned the <i>Star</i>
offices, to be informed that Harry Sutherland was out at the
moment. Leaving a message at the switchboard for the journalist
to communicate with him immediately on his return, Rugh closed
the door of his private office, and sat down to con over the
problem.</p>

<p>Before him were three lines of inquiry. Slender threads but
one of them might result in a clue he could follow. There was the
man who had telephoned Wilbur Orchard. It was the newest clue,
but a very weak one. Probably the call had originated from a
public telephone booth. In that case much depended on the
situation of the booth. If the man had used a booth at one of the
crowded centres of the city he would have disappeared in the
crowd immediately he left the instrument.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a man engaged on so delicate a mission
might seek a booth in a situation where the chances of being
overheard were slight. In that case, there was a possibility of
him being remembered by someone in the vicinity. Pulling the
telephone towards him, Rugh rang up "Information."</p>

<p>"A telephone call was put through to Mr. Wilbur Orchard of the
Balmain and South Assurance Company about ten o'clock this
morning," he said, when he obtained connection with the officer
in charge. "Will you give me the number and address of the
caller?"</p>

<p>"The Balmain and South have a large number of calls every
day," objected 'Information.' "It may be impossible to single out
the one you want."</p>

<p>"Quite so," Rugh laughed, softly. "Mr. Orchard will he obliged
if you will give the messenger he is sending to you a list of the
calls made to the Balmain and South between nine and ten-thirty
this morning. All right. I will send over at once."</p>

<p>Opening his door, Rugh instructed Teddy Marlow, his clerk, to
go to "Information" and ask for the list of calls being prepared
for Mr. Orchard, of the Balmain and South Assurance Company.</p>

<p>Leaving his door open, so that he could watch the outer office
during the absence of Marlow, Rugh returned to his desk.</p>

<p>The principal problem Wilbur Orchard had set him to solve was
the disappearance of Colin Carson. A man of wealth has usually
many anchors to civilisation. Colin Carson had been able to lend
the Balmain and South a very large sum of money. Rugh had
inquired on what bank the cheque had been drawn, and the managing
director had stated the money had been handed over in the form of
bearer securities. The financier had informed Orchard he had a
daughter, a school-girl. Her name should appear in the records of
some school, more probably a boarding school. Schoolgirls are
prone to make lifelong friendships. Possibly he might chance on
some schoolgirl-friend who still maintained a correspondence with
Rita Carson.</p>

<p>Finally, there was the building in which Colin Carson had had
his offices. "Roxine Chambers, Pitt Street," had been the address
on the loan deed. This was a very slender clue. Years before, the
detectives employed by the directors of the Assurance Company had
no doubt searched the place. Even it they had missed a few points
it would be almost impossible to pick them up after so long an
interval.</p>

<p>The assurance investigator was roused from the reverie into
which he had fallen, by the noisy entrance of the <i>Star</i>
man.</p>

<p>"So." Harry Sutherland stood in the doorway, and looked down,
quizzically, on his friend. "So, my words have come true. The
noble protector of indigent assurance companies is on the track
of the Little Bay murderer."</p>

<p>Rugh looked up with a start.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he exclaimed. "Look here, Harry, your
remarks indicate you know more than you have told me. How do you
come to know I am on the murder?"</p>

<p>Harry crossed the room and seated himself on the edge of the
desk.</p>

<p>"If you desire, dear comrade, to peer into the depths of a
detective's brain, catch him in maiden meditation, and let your
fancy free. Seems my shot told. 'Nother thing. The famous
Sherlock Holmes sent for his faithful Dr. Watson."</p>

<p>Rugh laughed. There was nothing else to do with Harry.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "I am on the murder. At least,
partially. Listen, and I will tell you how it came about."</p>

<p>Very briefly, Rugh went over the interview with Wilbur
Orchard.</p>

<p>"Somewhere the two matters link up," he concluded. "You said I
would be officially interested in the murder. I am. Now what
reasons had you for that statement?"</p>

<p>"Not one iota of reason. Nothing but the bare fact that our
mutual friend, Sam Brene, appears to be interested in the murder
also. When that gentleman appears interested I look around with
wide open eyes. His particular object in life is money, lots of
it and, apparently, the dirtier, the better. Assurance companies
have lots of money. Q.E.D."</p>

<p>"A damned long shot," commented Rugh.</p>

<p>"Not at all," returned the journalist, blithely. "Most people
are insured, now-a-days. All Sam would consider, if he came
across a dead body, would be, how much the dear departed was
insured for, and, more particularly, how he could get his talons,
not talents, dear comrade&mdash;on it."</p>

<p>"Reasonable reasoning for a <i>Star</i> journalist," laughed
Rugh. "How's the hunt going?"</p>

<p>"Legions of police; hordes of the public; a few journalists,
and many more 'would-be's;' fewer camera-men, and regiments of
film-wasters, make Little Bay the latest, newest, and most
excitingly popular seaside resort."</p>

<p>"Granted." Thigh leaned back in his chair and looked
critically at his friend. "I should have reminded you my inquiry
was not due to idle curiosity. What progress have the police
made? We will deal with the social side later."</p>

<p>"Progress!" Harry threw up his hands in mock horror. "They've
trampled the place flat. First, they drew a cordon of large
footed members of the force in a circle of about a hundred yards
diameter around the spot marked&mdash;'X' in brackets&mdash;and
then proceeded to systematically demolish everything within that
magic circle. Bushes, rushes, trees, all brought to the ground.
They even trod down the sand."</p>

<p>"With the result?"</p>

<p>"Nil. Absolutely nil." Harry made an eloquent gesture. "I've
had the time of my little life, lying on my little bingie on a
sandhill, outside the circle, watching and learning how not to
catch a murderer. Borrowed, without explanation or regrets, the
sporting man's glasses. He tipped three winners straight off, through the shock of losing them."</p>

<p>"That all? I thought you would know the police theory?"</p>

<p>"My boy!" Harry became mock serious. "You asked for facts. I
did not know you required them mixed with fiction. I am
officially advised the police have found a cast-iron theory."</p>

<p>"Which is?"</p>

<p>"From information received&mdash;to wit, a tram conductor, and
a few passengers&mdash;the police are convinced Ruth Collins left
the city on a Little Bay tram about four o'clock on the afternoon
preceding the day her body was found. She is said to have been
accompanied by a man of seafaring aspect."</p>

<p>"Well. What's wrong with that?" asked Rugh impatiently. "It
sounds reasonable."</p>

<p>"Most reasonable." Harry laughed, derisively. "You will deduce
from that, the woman never returned to the city."</p>

<p>Rugh sat up quickly, intent on his companion.</p>

<p>"Enough of fooling, Harry. What, exactly, do you know?"</p>

<p>"The woman was murdered in or near the city and her dead body
conveyed to Little Bay in a motor car."</p>

<p>"That's serious," exclaimed Rugh. "You must have excellent
reasons for that statement."</p>

<p>"Think, man." Harry spoke energetically. "If you'd thought
over the facts you would agree with me. Listen. Three
indisputable facts make my proof. First, there were no signs of
struggles on the spot. The police admit that is correct. Do you
think the woman lay down and meekly allowed her assailant to do
her to death? Secondly, the clothes were neatly folded and piled
on the body. What murderer would go to that trouble, while in the
open beside the body of his victim? That alone, is proof the deed
was committed in some place, such as a room, where the murderer
was reasonably safe for a time. Lastly, the amount of blood
around the body was remarkably small. Too small for the hideous
wounds she received."</p>

<p>"She was kicked to death," objected Rugh.</p>

<p>"Another police yarn," said Harry, in disgust. "She was
murdered with a blunt cutting instrument, and her clothing shows
neither cuts nor bloodstains."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="first">"YOU say the woman was murdered with a blunt,
cutting knife?" said Rugh, slowly. "Are you certain of your
facts, Harry? If you are correct you are bringing a grave charge
against the police force."</p>

<p>"I know what I am saying," replied Harry, testily, "I'm not
stating she was not kicked, brutally, nor that her death was not
the result of being kicked. I am saying that a knife, or some
similar instrument was used on the body, prior to it being
conveyed to Little Bay."</p>

<p>Rugh sat silent for some minutes, conning over the fact Harry
Sutherland had placed before him. If the <i>Star</i> man had not
made a mistake, the police were withholding valuable information.
Were they doing so for a definite purpose?</p>

<p>"I had a talk with Richards this morning," said Rugh at
length. "He told me the only information the police had related
to identification. Where did you get your information,
Harry?"</p>

<p>"Constable Nicholls." Harry searched his pockets for his pipe.
"An interesting member of the police force, my son. An officer of
diligence, and activity. With a fixed conviction the detective
department is composed of incompetents."</p>

<p>"In which theory he is ably and consistently supported by a
well-known member of the Australian Journalists' Association,"
added Rugh.</p>

<p>Harry grinned.</p>

<p>"Got any 'bacca, Rugh. You used to keep your pouch on the
desk. I hate suspiciously mean people. Where was I? Oh, Nicholls.
Owing to this well-known incompetence, an intelligent member of
the road-levelling brigade has taken the lonesome trail."</p>

<p>"Nicholls, on his own."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Theories are worrying things, and induce a desire
for a sympathetic friend."</p>

<p>"Harry Sutherland, the sympathetic friend! By the little gods,
Harry, you and Nicholls make a great team."</p>

<p>"Don't we?" Harry ran a hand through his mop of unruly black
hair. "Damn this pipe. Won't draw. Pass over that spike, old man.
Never mind the papers, they won't get in my way. Oh, take them
off if you want to. I don't mind. Yes, sir. The new firm of
Nicholls and Sutherland is on the trail. The senior partner forms
the theories, and states facts. The junior partner listens. Both
satisfied. Say, Rugh&mdash;"</p>

<p>Harry put down his pipe, and sat up, intent on a new idea that
had occurred to him.</p>

<p>"How about a jape on the most clever, intelligent, and
dignified police department of N.S.W.? You've not met Nicholls.
He's great. The real, dinkum, musical-comedy policeman, with more
than a hint of old time melodrama."</p>

<p>"Something's going to break now," Rugh looked at his friend in
mock alarm.</p>

<p>"Quit your kidding. This is serious. You can't acquire any
kudos over the affair, even if you solve it&mdash;with my help,
of course. 'Chink' McAdoo bars my way to fame, as the solver of
the great 'Little Bay Mystery.' What about boosting Constable
Robert Nicholls, as the great sleuth?"</p>

<p>Harry leaned back in his chair and shouted with laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's great. All the big-wigs at Headquarters outguessed
by a constable they despise and snub. Nicholls says the mighty
Richards gave him an awful dressing down the morning the body was
found. He's still sore over it."</p>

<p>"You're going too fast, young man." Rugh's eyes sparkled at
the idea of the joke. In his journalistic days he had suffered,
in common with other pressmen, by the cock-sure attitude of
certain members of the police department. "First we've got to
find the murderer, and build up the proof against him, before we
can hand over a ready-made reputation to your new friend."</p>

<p>"The firm now is Nicholls, Thornton and Sutherland," chuckled
Harry, irrepressibly. "Lord, what a mouthful. We'll succeed, all
right, old man. By the way, there's a chap coming to see us here.
He was coming to the <i>Star</i> office, but when I got your
message I left word for him to follow me here."</p>

<p>"About the murder?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing. Name's Smith, Joseph Smith. Calls himself a
bushman. Says he has information about the Little Bay
murder."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he take it to the police?"</p>

<p>"Says he did and they turned him down cold. That's
believable."</p>

<p>A knock came at the door, and Teddy Marlow entered.</p>

<p>"The paper you required, Mr. Thornton." Teddy was always
mysterious over business.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Teddy," greeted Harry. "How's Sexton Blake, and all
his merry crew?"</p>

<p>Teddy grinned. A well-set youth of fifteen, he thought he had
attained the ideal situation when he became clerk to the
investigator. His chief study was detective literature of all
kinds, and his ambition wavered between a private detective
agency and journalism.</p>

<p>"I'm studying the <i>Star</i> lately," he answered, turning at
the door to grin broadly at the journalist.</p>

<p>"I bought that," Harry shouted with laughter. "Never mind,
I'll chalk it up to McAdoo's account. What have you there,
Rugh?"</p>

<p>The assurance investigator spread a sheet of foolscap paper on
the desk.</p>

<p>"I asked 'Information' for a list of calls made to the Balmain
and South this morning, early. Here it is."</p>

<p>"Some list," commented the journalist. "I suppose we can leave
out of account all calls from reputable firms and people?"</p>

<p>This reduced the list considerably. At the end of five minutes
Rugh had pencilled on a pad five numbers that appeared to require
investigation.</p>

<p>"One of these should represent Wilbur Orchard's unknown
caller," he said. "We'll ask the Balmain and South if they can
identify any of them."</p>

<p>"Balmain and South?" he asked when be obtained the connection.
"No, young lady. I want a word with you. Rugh Thornton speaking.
I'm going to give you five numbers&mdash;telephone numbers. I
want to know if you have had calls through them from people you
know. Yes? Well, ask Mr. Orchard. He will tell you to give me the
information I ask for."</p>

<p>Rugh turned to the journalist with a broad smile on his
lips.</p>

<p>"The young lady is discreet. Says she cannot give me
information without authority, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," he spoke into the instrument. "All right? Well, listen,
Y00407."</p>

<p>The investigator paused and wrote a few words on his pad. Then
he gave the other telephone numbers in succession, pausing after
each number for the switch operator's comments.</p>

<p>"That reduces our investigations to three," he commented, as
he hung up the receiver. "The lady says W0449 and Y507 are
telephones used frequently by B and S agents."</p>

<p>"The city numbers will give us some trouble," remarked Harry
thoughtfully. "Probably both these city numbers are at the G.P.O.
or at city post offices."</p>

<p>"That leaves F3111 to be considered." Rugh lit a cigarette.
"That number belongs to the Waverley district and would suit a
man bent on the errand we are tracing."</p>

<p>"A man to see you, Mr. Thornton. Says his name's Smith, Joseph
Smith," announced Teddy, putting his head in at the door.</p>

<p>"Bring him in, Teddy." Harry Sutherland shifted his chair back
from the desk "We're going to hear something now Rugh."</p>

<p>The door opened and Teddy ushered in a tall thin man, well
bronzed by northern suns. For a moment he stood in the doorway,
looking from Rugh to Harry. At length he advanced to Harry.</p>

<p>"Guess you're Mr. Sutherland," he said, holding out his hand.
"Got your message at your office to come 'ere."</p>

<p>"Good guess," laughed Harry. "How did you do it?"</p>

<p>"You don't fit th' place. Leastways, not as 'e does. 'Sides,
th' boy looked at 'im as if 'e was boss, when 'e opened th'
door."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Smith," said Harry. "Let me introduce you to Mr.
Thornton, whose offices we have taken possession of. Mr. Thornton
is interested in what you have to tell me. That is, if it's in
connection with the Little Bay murder."</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you." Smith shook hands, solemnly with Rugh.
"It's about th' murder I came t' speak t' you."</p>

<p>"Why did you come to me?" asked Harry, curiously.</p>

<p>"I asked a chap at t' Coffee Palace, an' 'e ses I'd better go
to the th' <i>Star</i>. So I 'phoned an' th' young lady as
answered sed I'd better see Mr. Sutherland."</p>

<p>"What do you know about the murder, Mr. Smith?" asked
Rugh.</p>

<p>"I knows a lot," drawled Smith, in his peculiar clipped bush
speech. "I guess I can put you on to th' bloke as did it."</p>

<p>"You know the murderer?" asked Harry, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I don't know 'is name," replied the bushman. "But I guess I
can give you a line on 'im as'll 'elp you t' find 'im. 'E's a
tall man as weighs a good bit, an' e's lame ov th' left
foot."</p>

<p>"A lame man!" Harry looked incredulous.</p>

<p>"W-e-l-1 not ter say exactly lame. But 'e's got a bad limp,
all th' same. It may be natural, or it may be 'cos ov a blister,
or summat on 'is 'eel."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="first">"YOU'RE making an astounding statement, Smith,"
said Rugh gravely. "What are your grounds?"</p>

<p>Joseph Smith stretched his long legs in front of him and
thrust his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat.</p>

<p>"Th' trouble wi' you towns-folk is that you can't see what's
under your eyes," he said in his peculiar drawl. "I was stayin'
at th' Coffee Palace when this 'ere murder 'appened an' I thought
as 'ow I'd take a look round an' see if there was anythin' about
as you town-fellers 'adn't noticed."</p>

<p>"City folks are unobservant," remarked Harry, gravely.</p>

<p>"You've sed it Mr. Sutherland," answered the bushman
earnestly. "There's a lot on th' ground, an' in th' air, an' sky
they don't see. Cos why? They ain't edicated t' it. Well, as I
ses, I 'ad a look round so far as th' cops 'ud let me. That
wasn't fur, for they'd got a lot ov men marchin' round in a big
circle, a-warnin' peoples orf. I wanders round th' circle, an'
looks about me, an' comes across a pad as led from where th'
woman was lyin', down to t' beach. I'd given up 'opes ov a look
round when th' cops stopped me from goin' t' where she was found,
so I wanders down that pad, casual-like.</p>

<p>"Suddenly I saw sumthin' that made me look agen. It was a
bootmark, an' looked as if it 'ud been made about th' time th'
woman 'ad been murdered. I trailed it up an' found th' t' other
one&mdash;that's th' left foot, an' saw as 'e was lame."</p>

<p>"You're certain of that, Mr. Smith?" interposed Rugh.</p>

<p>"You can't deceive me as t' pads," replied Joseph Smith
proudly. "I've seen too many ov 'em. 'E wos goin' down to th'
water, but I followed 'im up backwards, 'cos I wanted ter see
where 'e'd cum from. Th' pads led right up to where th' body 'ad
laid. When I got to th' police circle a cop stops me. I showed
'im th' mark, an' e calls a pal, an' they calls th sergeant. 'E
looks at th' pad as if 'e'd never seen one affore, an' e asks me
wot I wanted ter do."</p>

<p>"I told 'im I wanted ter foller 'em up, an' 'e asks: 'Wot
for?' I ses, I suspicioned as th' bloke as made 'em might 'ave
'ad sumthin' ter do wi' th' murder. 'There's been a lot ov our
chaps a-walkin' round 'ere,' e remarks, an' I agrees. It wos
plain ter see they 'ad. 'Can you follow 'em up?' asks Mr.
Sergeant, an' I answers as 'ow I might try. 'Very-well, then,' e
ses, 'Come along.'</p>

<p>"So I went along an' th' Sergeant went wi' me, watchin' me
sharp. I showed 'im th' pads 'ere an' there, an' e ses, 'Jest
so,' an' 'Certainly.' Then we comes to th' place where th' body
wos found, an' there, 'arf under a big footmark as wos like th'
Sergeants's, I found another pad ov th' limpin' man."</p>

<p>"Th' Sergeant wouldn't let me go down th' 'ollow, but I walks
alon' th' edge. Presently I stops an' bends down. 'Wot d'yer
see?' asks th' Sergeant. 'Th' limpin' man came over 'ere,' I ses.
'Sure?' 'e ses. 'Certain,' ses I, 'an' e came from over there.' I
followed th' pads up, th' Sergeant tailin' on behind me, an' th'
pads went down another 'ollow. At th' bottom I turns up th' sand
a bit. 'Wot d'yer make ov that?' I asks th' Sergeant, 'andin 'im
a bit ov caked sand. 'Wot is it?' 'e asks. 'Blood,' ses I. 'Th'
poor creature was dumped 'ere first, an' then dragged over there.
There's th' marks plain ter be seen.' But 'e couldn't see 'em.
Those town cops aren't edicated enough. Th' tracks led out ov th'
'ollow an' up to th' road, an' just afore 'em was th' tracks ov
where a motor car 'ad pulled orf th' road, an' stood sum
time."</p>

<p>Rugh looked at Harry. The journalist had his lips pursed in a
silent whistle.</p>

<p>"What did you do then?" asked Rugh of the bushman.</p>

<p>"Followed th' pads back agen," answered Smith promptly. "I wos
curious ter see where they led to. So, wos th' Sergeant, fer 'e
came with me. They went right down th' track to th' beach an'
down t' where th' tide 'ad washed 'em out. I cast round a bit,
an' then th' Sergeant left me. But I wouldn't give up. Th' bloke
never went down there fer nothin'."</p>

<p>"I got a good way alon' th' beach afore I chances on wot I wos
lookin' fer. It wos this."</p>

<p>The bushman pulled from his pocket a roll of newspaper and
placed it on the desk. Harry reached over and unrolled it. In the
paper lay a woman's stocking, dirty and sodden by sea-water.</p>

<p>"A stocking!" Harry gave a shout.</p>

<p>"The lost stocking. I wondered where it had got to," he cried.
Then noticing Rugh's astonishment. "Didn't you know, Rugh. The
clothing found with the woman was incomplete. Among the things
missing was a stocking?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know that neither," put in the bushman. "But I did
know as that limpin' man 'adn't gone down to th' beach fer
nothin'."</p>

<p>"A limping man, a stocking, and the body dragged from one
place to another," commented Rugh. "The mystery deepens."</p>

<p>"What's this?" exclaimed Harry, who had been handling the
stocking. "There's something in it."</p>

<p>Gingerly he turned the stocking inside out. There rolled on to
the desk a well-worn gold ring, tarnished by sea-water. It was a
man's signet ring, and on the shield were engraved letters. Harry
picked up a magnifying glass lying on the desk and examined the
engraving.</p>

<p>"As well as I can make out it's a couple of 'C's,'" he
remarked.</p>

<p>Two 'C's' exclaimed Rugh. He leaned over and took the ring
from the journalist. A glance satisfied him that Harry was
correct.</p>

<p>"Colin Carson!" Harry uttered the thought in Rugh's mind.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," exclaimed Rugh. "'C's' are common initials. The
woman's name was Collins. Probably her husband had a christian
name commencing with 'C.'"</p>

<p>"His name is 'William,'" stated Harry. "I've seen the man.
'William' is his one and only name."</p>

<p>"Still this ring might not have belonged to Colin Carson,"
argued Rugh.</p>

<p>"And yet it might." Harry took the ring and dropped it in the
stocking again. Then he rolled the stocking in the newspaper and
handed the package to Smith.</p>

<p>"My advice to you Mr. Smith is, to go down to the Police
Headquarters in Hunter Street, and see Inspector Richards. Give
him this and explain where you found it. Make your statements as
fully as you have made it to Mr. Thornton and myself."</p>

<p>"Sure," replied the bushman, pocketing the package. "Hope I
'avn't done wrong in comin' ter you fellers?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied the journalist suavely. "We are much
obliged for your interesting narrative. At the same time I would
suggest you did not mention at the Police Department your call on
Mr. Thornton and myself. These 'cops' as you expressively name
them, are rather jealous of newspaper men, and might resent you
informing us of your find."</p>

<p>"I'll make a note ov that," said Joseph Smith, shaking hands
formally and vigorously.</p>

<p>"Colin Carson, again," said Rugh, softly, as the door closed
on the bushman.</p>

<p>"Sorry I blundered, old man," remarked Harry. "Shouldn't have
mentioned the name before our bushman friend. But it was a blow
under the belt."</p>

<p>"How did the woman come to have Colin Carson's ring?" asked
Rugh perplexedly. "Of course, there is nothing to prove it is
Carson's ring, but it looks bad."</p>

<p>"Coupled with the tale of the telephone message to Wilbur
Orchard, it certainly does look bad," agreed Harry. "I was half
inclined to keep the bally thing, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't have been wise," replied Rugh. "Smith might have
talked. Looks as if Wilbur Orchard was right in saying he
believed a fraud on the Balmain and South was brewing."</p>

<p>"You've got your work cut out," commented Harry sliding down
into his chair, in a characteristic attitude. "A fight to a
finish between Rugh Thornton, the famous assurance investigator,
and a gang of crooks."</p>

<p>"The purse being two hundred thousand pounds," added Rugh with
a laugh. "I don't feel at all&mdash;"</p>

<p>The telephone bell broke in on his sentence. Rugh picked up
the receiver and gave his name. Then he listened intently for a
couple of minutes.</p>

<p>"Richards wants to see me at once," he said, as he replaced
the receiver. "He says there's a new development in the Little
Bay murder."</p>

<p>Harry looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Smith hasn't had time to reach Headquarters," he observed.
"Appears to me things are moving rapidly this morning."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="first">"I'M coming with you," exclaimed Harry, reaching
for his hat. "You don't mind, Rugh?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," answered the assurance investigator. "Richards is
an old friend of yours. He won't mind, considering the attitude
your newspaper is taking on the murder."</p>

<p>Harry made a wry face as he followed Rugh to the lift.</p>

<p>"Afraid that attitude will come a bad cropper presently," he
observed, when they were on the street. "I've put in a formal
complaint against 'Chink' McAdoo's interference to old
Osmond."</p>

<p>"Any results?" queried the investigator.</p>

<p>"Nope. But the old man won't stand for the <i>Star</i> running
a bad second to the 'Post.' Humphries, who is doing the murder
for them, is making things very willing."</p>

<p>"The Limping Man will make a good yarn," laughed Rugh. "Don't
mention the ring, old man. I want any connection with Colin
Carson kept out of the newspapers."</p>

<p>Harry looked doubtful.</p>

<p>"Richards is particularly thick with Humphries," he said. "Ten
to one he gives him the tale complete. Might as well go the whole
hog, old man. After all, the Carson loan affair is, so far,
between you and the company."</p>

<p>Rugh thought a minute. They had turned into Hunter Street and
were only a few yards from Police Headquarters.</p>

<p>"All right," he said; and led the way up the steps into the
vestibule. Richards was waiting for them in the corridor, and led
the way to one of the interview rooms.</p>

<p>"Glad you came with Thornton," said the Inspector, as he shook
hands with Harry Sutherland. "I put a call through to your
office, but you were out."</p>

<p>"The Little Bay Mystery forges ahead," observed the
<i>Star</i> man with a grin. "How do you like investigation work
without the valuable aid of the <i>Star</i>, Richards?"</p>

<p>"It's strange," laughed the Inspector. "Truth is, the Chief
simply gasps when he opens your rag. Can't get used to the new
conditions."</p>

<p>"Why not telephone McAdoo and protest?" suggested Harry, with
a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"And get a leader on police irresponsibility," countered
Richards. "He might publish that letter the Chief sent the
<i>Star</i> some months ago, protesting against unfair criticisms
of our methods."</p>

<p>Harry caught Rugh's eyes, and winked. From the Inspector's
observations the police were running true to form.</p>

<p>"What's the new development you spoke of on the 'phone?" asked
Rugh.</p>

<p>The Inspector settled himself comfortably in his chair and
took from his waistcoat pocket a small article wrapped in tissue
paper. While he spoke he held it in his hand.</p>

<p>"The Little Bay Murder is one of the biggest problems the
police have tackled of recent years," he commenced, gravely
"There is a total lack of motive, and clues are few."</p>

<p>"The identification of the woman leads to no results?" queried
Harry.</p>

<p>"Identification was easy," answered Richards. "We guessed she
would be known to some of our men who do duty in the Surry Hills
district. Several men identified her, and it was not long before
we traced her history back to the time she left her husband."</p>

<p>"You have not her record before her marriage?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. We know she was married to William Collins at
Bundaberg, Queensland. Collins states he has forgotten his wife's
maiden name, but we can soon obtain that, if necessary."</p>

<p>Harry glanced at Rugh. The assurance man smiled slightly.
Inspector Richards little knew the fact he set aside so lightly
might influence the disposal of a large fortune.</p>

<p>"Our aim at present is to bring the murderer to justice,"
continued Richards. "We have ruled out Collins. He has not lived
with his wife for the last five years, and inquiries into his
record do not show he has formed any connection, or attachment,
with any woman that might lead to a desire for a new
marriage."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary to murder one wife to wed another," said
Rugh, drily. "Divorce is cheap, and lots of solicitors do it on a
sort of instalment plan."</p>

<p>"Quite so," commented the Inspector. "We have ruled Collins
out of consideration for the present, at least. Our next step, in
fact, our principal business, was to thoroughly examine the scene
of the murder for possible clues. Immediately I arrived on the
spot I drew a cordon of police around a wide area."</p>

<p>The Inspector was interrupted by the entry of a police
officer, who handed him a folded paper. Richards read it, and
made a gesture of annoyance.</p>

<p>"Tell him I'm engaged. He can wait, if he likes, or he can
call again. I'm busy for the next half-hour."</p>

<p>Rugh looked across at Harry, his lips silently forming the
word "Smith." The newspaper man grinned slightly. Little did the
worthy Inspector know the value of the evidence he was waving
aside so lightly.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful how many people have the idea they can beat
the police to it," Richards observed, as the orderly left the
room. "I've had dozens of cranks here willing to name the
murderer, off-hand."</p>

<p>"Still, one might chance on a good piece of information."
argued Harry.</p>

<p>"I'd rather follow a newspaper," said the Inspector, warmly.
"You chaps have a certain amount of training, such as it is. Let
me see, where was I? Oh, yes, immediately I had cleared the
ground of the inquisitive public I set men to cut and clear the
bush."</p>

<p>"You saw no clue in the careful folding and disposal of the
clothing?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"We have considered the matter," answered the Inspector
impatiently. "When we discovered the husband of the dead woman we
obtained from him a photograph. We published that photograph, and
immediately got in touch with a Little Bay tram conductor, who is
positive the woman left Sydney about four o'clock on the
afternoon of the day preceding the finding of her dead body. She
was, the man states, in company with a man who is described in a
poster I am circulating. The tram conductor's evidence is
supported by that of two travellers on the same tram. Inquiries
show she has been seen in Surry Hills several times in company
with the same man. We believe the man and woman had a quarrel
while out at Little Bay, probably over money, and he murdered
her."</p>

<p>"That does not explain the stripping of the body," objected
Rugh.</p>

<p>"Our theory is," replied the Inspector, dogmatically, "the
woman had something belonging to the man, probably money. They
quarrelled over it, and the man murdered her in a frenzy, and
stripped her to obtain what he claimed."</p>

<p>Harry was about to speak, when Rugh silenced him with a
warning gesture.</p>

<p>"I stated I gave orders for the ground inside the cordon to be
cleared," continued Richards. "It was a long job, and the men
engaged on it deserve every credit for their industry. The result
was most important. Some little distance from where the body was
found the search revealed&mdash;this."</p>

<p>The Inspector took from the table a few postcard-size
photographs and handed copies to Rugh and Harry. The prints
showed an ordinary bone-handled pocket knife, with two blades,
one partly open, and the other fully open.</p>

<p>"A pocket knife," exclaimed Rugh. "Looks like an ordinary
pattern. Should say it would be obtainable almost anywhere for
about half-a-crown."</p>

<p>"The Department attaches great importance to that knife. Will
you take that photograph, Sutherland, and ask Mr. McAdoo to
publish it to-morrow? We would like to get in touch with the
seller."</p>

<p>"Any particulars?" asked Harry, pulling pencil and paper from
his pocket.</p>

<p>The Inspector hesitated.</p>

<p>"There are many peculiarities about that knife," he replied,
slowly. "You may say it looks like an ordinary half-crown
horn-handled pen-knife; there are peculiarities that will at once
identify it to anyone who has ever handled it."</p>

<p>"That all?" Harry asked, disappointed. "Will you not describe
those peculiarities?"</p>

<p>"We rely on them to identify the murderer," answered Richards.
"I may add the big blade of the knife shows the marks made by the
rushes the murderer cut down for the woman to lie on."</p>

<p>"May we see the knife?" asked Rugh, somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p>Richards hesitated, and tapped the tissue-paper-covered
article he held on the desk for a few moments.</p>

<p>"I have it here," he said. "If I show it to you gentlemen it
must be on your word of honour not to publish any description of
it, other than what I sanction. I must again impress on you the
value of the knife as a clue to the murderer. You will understand
when you examine it."</p>

<p>The two friends at once gave the required assurances. The
Inspector carefully unrolled the knife, and opening the blades as
in the photograph, placed it on the desk.</p>

<p>"Finger-prints?" queried Harry.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately the heavy night dew obliterated them," answered
Richards. "There are the marks of the rushes."</p>

<p>Rugh produced a powerful magnifying glass from his pocket and
carefully examined the knife.</p>

<p>"May I handle it?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"Certainly." The officer spoke as if conferring a great
favour. "You will remember your promise?"</p>

<p>Rugh nodded. He picked up the knife and turned it over on his
palm. While the side of the knife the Inspector had exposed on
the table was of grey bone, the underside was of black bone.</p>

<p>"You now realise the importance of the clue," observed the
detective.</p>

<p>The assurance investigator did not reply. He was subjecting
the knife to a minute scrutiny through his glass.</p>

<p>"Have you a polished pen-knife?" he asked the Inspector, after
a lengthy pause.</p>

<p>Harry immediately produced an almost new penknife, with highly
polished blades.</p>

<p>"Not yours, Harry," laughed Rugh. "Richards might think we
were playing some trick on him. Thanks, Inspector."</p>

<p>The assurance investigator took the pen-knife offered him by
Richards. Carefully wiping the blade, he picked up a piece of
hard rubber eraser from the desk and cut it with a quick slashing
stroke. Then he examined the blade under his glass.</p>

<p>"The marks you say were made by rushes were really made by
rubber," he said, briefly. "Look for yourself."</p>

<p>He handed the knife and glass to the amazed Inspector.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="first">"WHAT'S that, Rugh?" asked Harry, sharply.</p>

<p>The assurance investigator looked at the two men with a
peculiar smile on his face.</p>

<p>"I am going to make a statement," he said, quietly. "Then I
will give you the proof. This knife was once owned by a motor
mechanic."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," exclaimed Richards. "The man with the woman seen
by the tram conductor was a seafaring man."</p>

<p>"Then he did not own this knife," replied Rugh, emphatically.
"Wait, Richards. There are plenty of proofs on the knife itself
of the occupation of the owner. I have shown you, on a clean
knife, marks identical with those on this knife, but made by
cutting rubber, not rushes.</p>

<p>"There are many marks on this knife, some very old. If you
claim the newer marks to have been made by cutting rushes, how do
you explain the older marks? Even a seafaring man is not
continually cutting rushes.</p>

<p>"On the other hand," continued Rugh, after a slight pause, "a
motor mechanic is continually cutting rubber&mdash;tyres. Had
there been but the new marks, your theory might have been
reasonable, Richards. But, with the large number of old marks,
some very old and all of the same nature, your theory is
untenable."</p>

<p>"It is a slender thread on which to claim the knife belonged
to a motor mechanic," objected Harry.</p>

<p>"Other marks on the knife support my theory, Harry," said
Rugh, quietly. "Inspector Richards has referred to the knife as
peculiar. It would be very peculiar if the makers had issued it
in its present form. The knife has had hard wear and has been
practically reconstructed by the owner, or at the owner's
directions."</p>

<p>He turned the knife over on his hand, showing the black horn
side.</p>

<p>"The two sides of the knife do not match," the assurance
investigator continued. "The grey bone is the correct bone for
the knife. The black bone has been taken from another knife to
make the knife complete."</p>

<p>"That does not prove your motor mechanic theory," objected the
Inspector, impressed in spite of his pre-convictions.</p>

<p>"Look at the rivets." Rugh was now speaking with more
animation. "Would any jeweller&mdash;and jewellers usually
undertake the repair or such articles&mdash;put in such rough
work. Not only are the rivets rough but the filing has been done
with coarse files, more like those to be found in a garage than
in a jeweller's shop.</p>

<p>"I have said the knife was repaired by a motor mechanic for
himself, or at the direction of the owner. The fact that the
blade is marked with rubber scratches, some of long standing, is
presumptive evidence the owner continually repaired motor tyres.
Taking the marks and the nature of the repairs, it is fair
circumstantial evidence the owner of the knife was a motor
mechanic."</p>

<p>"How's that for deduction, Inspector," asked the <i>Star</i>
man, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I don't like it." Richards shook his head. "You say the marks
on the blades are caused by rubber, not rushes. But you haven't
shown that rushes will not make the same marks. Then, your theory
of the repairs to the body of the knife is not conclusive.
Granted, for argument, the knife has been repaired. Couldn't it
have been repaired on a ship by one of the engine-room staff? No,
Thornton, you'll have to give me more direct evidence than you
have, to make me believe the man the tram conductor saw with the
woman was a motor mechanic, and not a seafaring man."</p>

<p>Rugh laughed, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"When you have the evidence to convict a man of the murder we
will test our relative theories," he said. "Until then we will
not argue the matter. By the way, Richards, where did you get the
photograph of Ruth Collins?"</p>

<p>"From her husband."</p>

<p>"It must be over five years old." Rugh mused for a moment.
Then he added: "And the tram conductor recognised her!"</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>"What did you mean by your last remark?" asked Harry, as they
walked down Philip Street.</p>

<p>"The woman had lived a fast and irregular life for the five
years following the taking of the photograph," commented Rugh,
tersely. "Such a life would alter the features considerably. Yet
the tram conductor recognised her by a casual glance while
collecting fares."</p>

<p>"Humph!" Harry stopped before the big doors of the <i>Star</i>
newspaper. "You forgot two passengers identified her as well as
the conductor."</p>

<p>"There are people who see a likeness everywhere," retorted the
investigator, sharply. "Where are you going, Harry?"</p>

<p>"To see the Chief. This story is too good to pass up for the
Chink's' fads, or willingness to oblige his friend, Sam Brene.
There's going to be a real vulgar squabble in this dignified
building, if I have my way."</p>

<p>"You will publish Smith's story to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I'm banking he gets tight, or disgusted with our
pig-headed police, and does not return to interview Richards. If
he does, the morning papers may get the guts of it. Anyhow,
there's Richards' story to fall back on."</p>

<p>"He'll give that to the morning papers," objected Rugh.</p>

<p>"As a statement. I'll go further&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You cannot publish the details of the knife," reminded the
investigator.</p>

<p>"No." There was real regret in Harry's voice. "What a bonzer
story it would make, Rugh. You had it all over him with your
reading of the marks on the knife. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I?" Rugh spoke with assumed carelessness. "Oh, I shall have a
wander over Surry Hills and see what I can pick up."</p>

<p>"Well, so long." Harry pushed open the glass door. "Let me
know if you pick up a murderer or so."</p>

<p>Rugh turned into Elizabeth Street and sauntered along to
Liverpool Street. There he stood for some minutes watching a
couple of Little Bay trams come and go. He paid but little
attention to the trams, his eyes wandering over the crowds that
surged around that busy spot.</p>

<p>After a time he strolled on along the embankment of the new
city railway. He was now bordering the Surry Hills district. At a
small wine bar he turned in and seated himself at a table.</p>

<p>The shop was fairly full, a good proportion of the customers
being women. Some of them smiled invitingly at the tall,
good-looking assurance investigator, but he took no notice of
them.</p>

<p>Presently one of the men behind the bar came across to him.
Rugh spoke a couple of words and the man returned to the bar. In
a few minutes a portly, red-faced man brought two glasses of wine
to Rugh's table, and sat down.</p>

<p>"Didn't notice you enter, Mr. Thornton," he remarked in low
tones. Then louder: "Here's how."</p>

<p>"I want some information from you Simpson. No," (seeing the
man look around him quickly) "there's nothing your customers
can't hear, but I don't want to attract attention."</p>

<p>"What is it, Mr. Thornton?" asked the man, guardedly. "You
know we have a rough crowd here."</p>

<p>"Did you know Ruth Collins?" asked Rugh, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Came in here sometimes," remarked the man, off-handedly. "Saw
her photo in the papers. Poor girl, she's gone."</p>

<p>"Photo like her?" asked Rugh. Then, as the man hesitated he
put his hand in his pocket and produced the photograph he had
received from Inspector Richards. "Newspaper Photographs are bad
to judge from. Would you recognise her from that?"</p>

<p>Simpson took the photograph and studied it for some
minutes.</p>

<p>"She's altered a lot," he observed. "Still, it looks like her.
Say, Mr. Thornton, Ted was here some four or five years ago.
Shall I call 'im?"</p>

<p>Receiving a nod of assent, the proprietor of the wine bar
called the man and handed him the photograph.</p>

<p>"Blime," exclaimed the barman, when he saw the photo. "That's
Ruth Collins. 'Asn't she altered. I remember 'er well when she
first used ter come 'ere. A real 'andsome woman, she was, an' as
nice as they make 'em. She's altered a lot ov late, though."</p>

<p>"When was she here last?" asked Rugh, quietly. The man looked
at his employer, who nodded.</p>

<p>"She was 'ere off an' on all day Saturday. Let me see. She was
'ere wi' a bloke an' th' Tiger Lily a'tween five an 'arf-past,
sure."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="first">"THERE is no doubt that Ruth Collins was seen in
the Cannon Wine Bar at the time the police state she was at
Little Bay in the company of a seafaring man," concluded
Rugh.</p>

<p>"So much for the police theory," grinned Harry. Immediately on
turning his copy in at the <i>Star</i>, he had come over to
Thornton's office.</p>

<p>"The tram conductor misled them," said Rugh. "His
identification, backed by that of the passengers, appeared
conclusive."</p>

<p>Harry grunted. The interior of his pipe seemed to hold most of
his interest.</p>

<p>"Published much of a story?" asked Rugh, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Fair," Harry came back, with a jerk, to things mundane.
"There's been a hell of a row, but the 'Chink's' defeated.
Osmond's given me a free hand."</p>

<p>"That brings Sam Brene into the game again." Rugh looked
thoughtful. "If the big grafter wants your story killed you're in
for a fight, m'lad."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Harry looked up with a challenge in his eyes. "If I
remember right you had more than one dust-up with our
friend."</p>

<p>Rugh shook his head. Three times he had bumped against some
mysterious influence, protecting crime. Twice, while criminal
investigator for the <i>Star</i>, he had good stories of Town
Hall corruption deliberately killed. The second occasion had led
to his resignation. Later, within a few weeks of his taking up
his present work, a fraudulent company promoter had walked from
under a well-spread net, through deliberate jury-framing.</p>

<p>"'Ware fights in that quarter," he warned Harry. "Sam Brene
can take on both of us with one hand tied behind his back. Still,
the day may come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When a tussle with the Town Hall boss will look good," added
the <i>Star</i> man, optimistically. "Count me in when the ring's
cleared."</p>

<p>Rugh got up from his chair and walked up and down the little
office. After a dozen turns he halted, and faced his friend.</p>

<p>"I laughed at you when you warned me Sam Brene's finger was in
the Carson Loan pie," he said, quietly. "I believe now you were
right. To adopt your phraseology, Harry, the ring is cleared for
a fight to a finish between the big grafter and myself."</p>

<p>"Whoop!" Harry jumped to his feet. "I'm on. Sam Brene's going
for his life, this time. Atta boy!"</p>

<p>"You'll get your hands full," warned Rugh, laughing. "McAdoo
will never forgive you for going to Osmond over the Little Bay
murder. He'll be after your scalp to hang beside mine."</p>

<p>"Who cares?" Harry exclaimed, jubilantly. "What's our next
step, Rugh?"</p>

<p>"Follow the Little Bay trail," replied the investigator. "I'm
positive it joins with the Carson Loan Case somewhere. At all
events I can do little on the Carson case until I hear from
Brisbane."</p>

<p>Harry looked the question.</p>

<p>"I have written for a copy of Ruth Collins' marriage
certificate. Can you see nothing peculiar in a man forgetting the
maiden surname of his wife?"</p>

<p>"I thought that," replied the journalist. "But, for the moment
it did not seem important. You see, Rugh, the identity of the
murderer is the paramount question in the Little Bay Mystery.
What's our next line of inquiry?"</p>

<p>"A sweep up of the Surry Hills district," answered Rugh,
promptly. "I was successful yesterday, to a certain point, but I
want to find others who saw Ruth Collins late that night. Put
that beastly pipe away. You don't want to choke the people we are
going to see."</p>

<p>At the Central Railway Station, Rugh left the tram-car and
walked through the station to the Chalmers Street entrance.
Crossing the road, he turned up Elizabeth Street towards the
Buckingham Street intersection. There he halted.</p>

<p>"Here's where we get busy, Harry," he said, quietly. "From
what I have gathered Ruth Collins was well known around
here."</p>

<p>For some five minutes he loitered before the Southern Cross
Hotel, apparently in conversation with the <i>Star</i> man, but
at the same time keenly scrutinising his surroundings.</p>

<p>"I'd like to meet the lady known as the Tiger Lily," he said.
"Suppose, however, we are too early for her. She's one of
Sydney's night-birds, from all accounts. Come along."</p>

<p>Turning down Buckingham Street, towards the Railway, he
stopped suddenly before a small tobacconist's shop.</p>

<p>"Like a cigar, old man?" he inquired, carelessly; and, without
waiting for an answer, turned into the shop.</p>

<p>A sturdy built man with a big, florid face, came forward, to
serve them.</p>

<p>"Cigars," ordered Rugh, briefly. Then, when the man had turned
to the shelves behind him. "Quiet round here?"</p>

<p>"Busy enough at night," replied the man, placing some open
boxes on the counter. "I'm open till midnight, and until after
six don't make enough to make the till rattle."</p>

<p>"You don't run the saloon after six?" asked Rugh, bluntly.</p>

<p>The man stiffened.</p>

<p>"Who th' 'ell are you?" he snapped. "Police pimps, or
what?"</p>

<p>Rugh took a card from his pocket, and laid it on the
counter.</p>

<p>"Oh, insurance," said the man, a little more civilly. "Nothing
doing, mister. Don't make enough 'ere to make it worth
while."</p>

<p>"Suppose the fines eat up all the profits?" laughed Rugh.</p>

<p>"Fines?" The look of suspicion came again into the man's eyes.
"What are you gettin' at?"</p>

<p>"Come now, Shorty Matt," said the investigator in a low tone.
"You've not forgotten me?"</p>

<p>Shorty Matt turned to the shelves and picked up his
spectacles. Fitting them on, carefully, he picked up Rugh's card
and read it slowly.</p>

<p>"Rugh Thornton," he said reading. "Can't say as I remember
you."</p>

<p>"Then you've forgotten Mick Skedding, and the message you
brought out of Goulburn gaol?" Rugh laid his right hand, palm up,
on the counter, as he spoke.</p>

<p>"You!" Shorty Mac stood erect, sharply, and held out his hand.
"Never believed I could forget you, Mr. Thornton, but it's a long
while ago since I saw you last. Besides, that insurance fake put
me off. You were a reporter on the <i>Star</i> when that
happened.</p>

<p>"Left the <i>Star</i>, Matt," observed Rugh. "I'm retained by
a syndicate of insurance companies to protect their
interests."</p>

<p>Harry gave Rugh a warning nudge.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Harry," laughed the investigator. "Matt
doesn't talk. Matt, meet Mr. Sutherland, who took my place on the
<i>Star</i>. He's safe."</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Sutherland," said the tobacconist.
"Mr. Thornton done me and a mate o' mine a good turn, an' I ain't
the man to forget it. What are you after, sir?"</p>

<p>"Know her?" Rugh placed the photograph of Ruth Collins on the
counter.</p>

<p>"Looks like&mdash;yes, it is&mdash;Ruth Collins. She's a lot
younger 'ere, an' better looking. But it's 'er, right enough.
Poor girl. She met a bad end."</p>

<p>"Who were her cobbers?" asked Rugh.</p>

<p>"Well. Sometimes she'd run with th' Tiger Lily an' 'er gang,
but 'er real steady was Maudie Wheelson."</p>

<p>"Wheelson?" repeated Rugh, thoughtfully. "What's her lay? Same
as Ruth's?"</p>

<p>Shorty Mac pursed up his lips queerly.</p>

<p>"I knows you won't go an' get me into trouble," he said, after
a pause. "Y'know, them as lives round 'ere ain't supposed to
spill nothin'. She lives with a bloke as ain't 'er 'usband, up in
Coomber Street. Up Buckingham Street, on top ov th' 'ill. You'll
know th' house. It's right oppersite a paint factory. You're not
going to see her, Mr. Thornton?"</p>

<p>"Might." Rugh looked intently at the tobacconist. "Any reason
not, Matt?"</p>

<p>"Only as 'e's a rough sort ov customer," replied Matt. "Still,
there's two ov you."</p>

<p>"What's his trade?"</p>

<p>"Calls 'isself a labourer," said Matt, cautiously. "Can't say
as 'e does much work."</p>

<p>"Lives on the woman," commented Rugh. Then, as Matt did not
answer: "Ruth Collins lived with them?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes." Matt leaned across the counter and spoke in
guarded tones. "Lately she been stayin' with some bloke down
Ultimo. Only comes up 'ere occasionally."</p>

<p>"Who's the chap?"</p>

<p>"Big lump of a man. Name's Leo&mdash;leastways, that's what
she called 'im. He's real dangerous, Mr. Thornton."</p>

<p>"Humph! What's he do for a crust?"</p>

<p>Shorty Matt made an eloquent gesture.</p>

<p>"Bludger, eh?" interpreted Rugh. "Say, Matt, when did you see
Ruth last?"</p>

<p>The man thought for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Let me see. Yes. I remember now. I was standin' at th' door
about nine last Saturday night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The evening before she was found at Little Bay," interrupted
Harry eagerly.</p>

<p>"That's it," replied Matt. "I saw 'er go past with two blokes.
They were all well oiled. She called out 'good-night' to me, an'
one of th' blokes gave 'er a shove."</p>

<p>"That was about nine o'clock at night, you say?" said Rugh,
quietly.</p>

<p>"Yep. Or a little after. Can't be quite sure. One ov 'em was
that bloke, Leo."</p>

<p>"Who was the other man?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"They calls 'im 'Ginger.' It was 'im 'as give 'er a shove.
'E's somethin' to do with cars. Works in a garage. That's when 'e
works at all."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="first">"A MOTOR mechanic." Rugh tried to steady his
voice as he spoke. "You are certain of that, Matt?"</p>

<p>"Sure? 'Course I am. He used to work at that big garage up
Buckingham Street till 'e 'ooked up with Leo's crowd. You know
the place. They hire out cars without drivers."</p>

<p>"Ever seen that knife, Matt?" asked Rugh, showing the
tobacconist the photo of the pocket knife the police regarded as
an important clue.</p>

<p>Shorty Matt smiled broadly, and reached into the counter
show-case. He produced a card of pocket knives, closely
resembling the one in the photograph.</p>

<p>"'Arf-a-crown each," he said. "Sell 'em by the 'undreds. Best
cheap knife there is."</p>

<p>"Ever sell one to Leo, or Ginger?" asked Harry, casually
fingering the card of knives.</p>

<p>"Sell one to either ov them?" repeated Matt, meditatively.
"Come to think ov it, I believe I did sell a knife to Leo,
one-time. 'E used ter come in 'ere a bit."</p>

<p>"One of these knives?" suggested Rugh.</p>

<p>"You've got me beat there," confessed Matt. "May 'ave been one
ov these, or like another. It's some time ago."</p>

<p>"Did Ginger ever buy one?" continued Harry.</p>

<p>"Should say, never," Matt spoke with conviction. "'E ain't
been in this shop, 'ardly ever."</p>

<p>Outside the tobacconist shop Rugh retraced his steps up
Buckingham Street. At the Southern Cross Hotel, he paused.</p>

<p>"Do with a drink, Harry?" he asked, casually.</p>

<p>The journalist nodded. He realised his friend was hot on a
trail, and, for the present, would not talk.</p>

<p>Instead of leading the way into the saloon bar, Rugh crossed
the road and, entering a newsagent's shop, purchased an early
edition of the <i>Star</i>. On the front page was Harry's story
of the Limping Man, illustrated by photographs of Ruth Collins
and the mysterious knife. Folding the newspaper as it had been
reading it, the investigator led the way into the public bar.</p>

<p>It was a slack time of the day and only a couple of men were
standing in the bar. Rugh ordered the drinks and then became
absorbed in the murder story. When the barman served the drinks
he placed the newspaper, open, on the counter.</p>

<p>"Excuse me." The barman picked up the paper. "Th'
<i>Star's</i> spread itself on th' murder to day, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Queer business," replied the investigator, guardedly, yet
showing no unwillingness to be drawn into discussion.</p>

<p>"You've said it," agreed the man, "Now, this 'ere story ov th'
Limpin' Man. D'yer think it's true, or only a noosepaper
yarn?"</p>

<p>"Probably true," answered Rugh, indifferently. "What do you
think, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Don't know what to say," drawled the journalist. There was a
malicious glint, behind the powerful glasses. "Met a man this
morning that used to be on the <i>Star.</i> He says he will vouch
for the truth of it."</p>

<p>"Did 'e?" The barman was well interested. "'Course those
noosepaper men are terrible liars. They write just wot th' paper
wants 'em to."</p>

<p>"I believe you." Rugh I rod slightly on Harry's foot. "It's a
good yarn, though. Suppose you knew the woman&mdash;what's her
name&mdash;oh, Ruth Collins. Believe she used to live somewhere
round here."</p>

<p>"She wasn't round 'ere much lately," answered the man. "One
time she'd come in 'ere regular. An' a girl named the Tiger
Lily."</p>

<p>"The Tiger Lily?" questioned Harry, removing his glasses and
polishing them vigorously. Rugh remained silent. The action was
characteristic of Harry when interested or puzzled. "Heard of
her. What's she like?"</p>

<p>"Real good-looker. 'Nuff to knock a man off 'is block. But
she's a 'ard case. They say as she carried a knife in 'er
stockin'. Not but wot she's a perfect lady when she's in
'ere."</p>

<p>"She and Ruth Collins were mates, then?"</p>

<p>"Usually there was three of them." The barman leaned
confidentially across the bar. "Say, gents, wot about one on the
'ouse?"</p>

<p>"My turn," interposed Harry. "You'll have one with us. Who was
the third?"</p>

<p>"Called Maudie." The barman spoke from some distance down the
bar. "She was&mdash;well, you know."</p>

<p>"Suppose I can guess," grinned the journalist.</p>

<p>"You can't guess wrong." The drinks were on the bar. "Here's
to you. Tell you what. Ruth wasn't a bad sort. Done a lot ov 'arm
'er linkin' up with Maudie."</p>

<p>"How's that?" Rugh threw some money on the bar. "Fill them up
again."</p>

<p>"Maudie was allus gettin' inter 'ot water," observed the man.
"Only last week she was mixed up in some shootin' row in Little
Buckingham Street. Someone fired some shots. The woman over at
the cook-shop, t'other side ov Buckingham Street, told me. Quite
a story she made ov it."</p>

<p>"Well, I must get along," said Rugh, suddenly. "Coming my way,
Harry? Good-day to you."</p>

<p>"So-long," answered the barman, holding out a damp hand. "My
name's Bob. Bob Reglar. Pleased to see you any time you're this
way."</p>

<p>Outside the hotel Harry turned to cross the road. Rugh caught
him by the arm.</p>

<p>"Careful, Harry," he warned. "We're in a dangerous
neighbourhood. Let's get this tram."</p>

<p>A Redfern tram drew up and the two men boarded it. At Redfern
Green they alighted, and crossed the road.</p>

<p>"What's the game?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Probably watched by that barman," answered Rugh. "If Mr.
Reglar thought we had been pumping him he would be inquisitive as
to our movements. We'll get this tram back and get out at the
stop before the intersection."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later the friends entered the cook-shop
mentioned by the barman. A stout, homely-looking woman was seated
behind the counter.</p>

<p>"Nothing hot," she said briefly, as they entered. "Dinner's
over a good bit now."</p>

<p>Harry started, then led the way to one of the tables.</p>

<p>"Dinner! Lord! I'd forgotten I was hungry," he exclaimed.
"Say, ma'am, I'll have a double helping of whatever you've got, and stand by for a repeat."</p>

<p>The woman laughed as she disappeared into the kitchen at the
rear of the shop. In a few minutes she returned with a plentiful
supply of cold meats, and a crisp looking salad.</p>

<p>"I've got the kettle on," she observed, juggling deftly with
the table utensils. "Won't take long to boil. We don't 'ave many
in of an afternoon."</p>

<p>"You're English," exclaimed Harry, suddenly. "Couldn't mistake
that accent."</p>

<p>The woman laughed again.</p>

<p>"You Australians always recognise the pommy," she answered.
"Yes, me an' my 'usband's H'english."</p>

<p>"I'm from God's own island," retorted the journalist. "My
friend's the only dinkum Aussie in the room. That's why he
prefers to feed rather than join in intellectual
conversation."</p>

<p>"Poor feller. He's 'ungry." The woman left the room to fetch
the tea.</p>

<p>Harry swung round on his seat and looked at the big plate
glass windows earnestly for a few moments. "Good possie, here,"
he commented, when the woman returned. "Do a good business here,
Mrs. Vaughan?"</p>

<p>"Tolerable." The woman looked at Harry, perplexedly. "How do
you come to know my name?"</p>

<p>Harry pointed with his knife to the windows.</p>

<p>"Had to learn to read backwards," he joked. "Made such a mess
of it the other way."</p>

<p>"My!" Mrs. Vaughan folded her arms over her ample bosom. "You
chaps are sharp."</p>

<p>"Jolly good ham, this." Harry was making good play with the
food. "Never been up this way before, Mrs. Vaughan. Bit of a
rough neighbourhood?"</p>

<p>"Rough? I should say it was. When I first came 'ere I was so
nervous I couldn't sleep ov nights. Tom, my 'usband, 'e's lyin'
down upstairs, uster laugh at me. Said I'd get useter it. Well, I
'ave a bit, but even now I can't abear a fight."</p>

<p>"They don't fight in the shop. Tucker's too good," commented
Harry, with his mouth full.</p>

<p>"There now. I do like to see a man enjoy 'is food. Can't
complain ov Tom. 'E never seems ter be done eatin', 'e eats that
'earty. 'Corse it's what you're brought up to. Tom, 'e was a boxer in H'england. No, they don't fight in th' shop. My 'usband
wouldn't stand fer that."</p>

<p>"I think I could tackle another plate of that ham," said
Harry, laying down his knife and fork with a sigh of
satisfaction. "It's the best I've tackled this year."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vaughan beamed on Harry as she went to fetch the ham.
Rugh finished his meal and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"It's a good 'am, though I ses it," commented the cook-shop
proprietress, as she placed the refilled plate before the
journalist. "There's plenty ov it, so don't be afraid."</p>

<p>"With a husband like your man you shouldn't mind a few rows,"
continued Harry, casually.</p>

<p>"An' I don't. Not when they uses fists, although some of 'em
looks real orfull after. It's when there's shootin' I feels
bad."</p>

<p>"Shooting?" Harry winked at the investigator. "They don't use
guns round here, do they?"</p>

<p>"They didn't when we first come 'ere to live," replied Mrs.
Vaughan, shaking her head. "Th' neighbourhood's gone down
terrible. There's them as 'ave come 'ere t' live as carries a gun
like wot y' see in them American picters. An' they uses 'em, too.
Why, only last Thursday night there was shoot-in' down Little
Buckingham Street."</p>

<p>"Anyone hurt?"</p>

<p>"Not as I knows ov. I was standin' oppersite th' Southern
Cross 'otel a-talkin' to Mrs. Jones, when I 'eard th' shots.
'Wot's that?' ses Mrs. Jones, an' affore I could speak three
women came running out ov Little Buckingham Street, an' up th'
'ill."</p>

<p>"Up Buckingham Street hill?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes," Mrs. Vaughan continued, breathlessly. "They 'arf
stopped when they wos by us, an' one ov' em sed, 'We'd better get
'ome affore he comes up 'ere.' An' then they starts runnin'
agen."</p>

<p>"Suppose you didn't happen to recognise any of them?" asked
the <i>Star</i> man.</p>

<p>"As it 'appens, I did." Mrs. Vaughan was apparently a
voluminous talker. "'N' I wouldn't 'ave thought it ov 'er. Th'
Tiger Lily, they calls 'er. Quite quiet an' lady-like when she
comes in 'ere for a meal, although there's them as ses things
against 'er."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="first">"THE Tiger Lily?" queried Harry, quietly.
"That's queer name for a girl?"</p>

<p>"So it is." Mrs. Vaughan nodded agreement. "An' although she's
that quiet an' lady-like when she comes in 'ere, she can show 'er
claws like the wild cat she is, when someone tries to take a
liberty wi' 'er. I remembers one day she was sittin' in 'ere at a
cup o' tea, as quiet as could be, when a big 'ulkin' brute walks
in. 'Ullo, Lily,' e ses. 'You're just th' girl I want.' 'Do you?'
ses she, quite sarcastic like. 'Then your luck's in.' An' th'
bloke, thinkin' e's got 'er sweet, slides inter th' seat beside
'er an' slips 'is arm around 'er waist. She seemed ter let
'erself go fer a minute, then she straightens up an' ses, 'Keep
orf or you'll get this,' an I sees as she'd got a wicked lookin'
knife pointed at 'is breast. Keeps it in 'er stockin', as I've
'eard say."</p>

<p>"Nice young lady," commented Rugh.</p>

<p>"Well, th' girls 'as ter protect themselves," protested the
cook-shop proprietress. "I don't blame 'em, with all th' bludgers
an' sich like as there's now in th' place. Think of that poor
woman 'as was done ter death out at Little Bay. As nice a quiet
little lady as you'd meet anywhere. 'Cept that ov late she was
goin' wi' a dead crook crowd."</p>

<p>"Yes? Ruth Collins was her name, wasn't it?" Harry was blandly
innocent. "I was reading in the <i>Star</i> about her and the
tracks of a limping man found on the sandhills."</p>

<p>"I won't say it isn't true." Mrs. Vaughan was a
sensationalist. "More'n likely it is."</p>

<p>"The newspaper appears to suggest the woman was not murdered
at Little Bay," remarked Harry. "At least, that seems to be the
meaning of their comments on the story."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder at that. You don't, know th' things as
'appens round 'ere at night. Why, 'arf Sydney could be murdered
for all th' police care. They talk a lot, an' look fine an'
'ansome in their uniforms, but all they cares for is ter worry
shopkeepers as stays open a few minutes after time, and
sly-groggers."</p>

<p>"The police story is that Ruth Collins was seen to board a
Little Bay tram last Saturday afternoon, about four o'clock."
Rugh tried to lead the lady on the right track. Mrs. Vaughan
looked mysterious.</p>

<p>"Maybe," she said, cautiously. "Though I've 'eard of those who
say she was seen in th' ills long past four. The Tiger Lily could
tell a tale as to that, if she wanted to. But I minds me own
business. That's th' only way to live in peace round 'ere."</p>

<p>"Quite right." Harry winked slyly at Rugh, "If the fearful
things you say happen at night it would be dangerous to talk
openly. Of course, among friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's wot I tells me 'usbaud," replied Mrs. Vaughan,
vigorously nodding her head. "Wot's sed among friends shouldn't
go no further. I'm sure I don't know what I'd do if those
bludgers came 'ere one night, an' me screaming like that poor
woman did th' other night."</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked the journalist.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know. It was on Saturday last, or to be
correct, Sunday mornin', an' we'd just gone ter bed, when I 'eard
'em. I puts me 'ead under th' bedclothes, an' feels as if I'd
faint. Tom sed 'e thought there was a row in Frozene Lane."</p>

<p>"Frozene Lane, after midnight, last Saturday," whispered Rugh.
Harry frowned a warning.</p>

<p>"Where's Frozene Lane?" he asked, casually.</p>

<p>"Just alon' 'ere, about fifty yards down near Buckingham
Street. It's a queer place, nearly all backyards. An th' things
as goes on there at night are too orful fer words."</p>

<p>"So you did not see Ruth Collins on the Saturday evening?"
Harry asked the direct question, as the cook-shop proprietress
seemed to wish to avoid the subject.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't." Mrs. Vaughan pursed her lips, determinedly,
"though I ain't sayin' as there's them as might 'ave seen
'er."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see this Tiger Lily," said Rugh, suddenly. "She
appears to be interesting."</p>

<p>"Lily's a queer girl," replied the lady. "It 'ud depend on
whether she took to you or no. If she did 'oney couldn't be
sweeter, but if she didn't like your looks she'd say so, an' as
plain as yer face."</p>

<p>A couple of men entered the cookshop at that moment, and the
two investigators paid their bill and left.</p>

<p>"Home," declared Harry, when they reached the pavement. "It's
a day, Rugh, and a good day, too."</p>

<p>"We've had a lot of luck," assented the assurance man. "Though
where this trail is going to lead up to I can't quite guess."</p>

<p>"The police theory is shattered badly," said Harry,
jubilantly. "Those 'Johns' are too damned cock-sure."</p>

<p>Rugh caught the journalist by the arm. They had wandered down
to Elizabeth Street, and now stood on the corner of Chalmers
Street, opposite the railway station entrance.</p>

<p>"Quiet, Harry," he said in a low voice. "See that man standing
by the fruit barrow, opposite the station entrance&mdash;the man
in the brown cap? He was one of the men who entered the cook-shop
just before we left. Have an idea he picked us up at Shorty
Matt's. Anyhow, he's following us."</p>

<p>The <i>Star</i> man immediately held out his hand. "Good-bye,
old man. Good of you to come up here with me."</p>

<p>Then he continued in a whisper, scarcely moving his lips:</p>

<p>"Jump on a tram, Rugh. If he follows you, I'll follow
him."</p>

<p>"What if he follows you?"</p>

<p>"I'll dodge into some place and borrow a telephone. You can
then come and dog him."</p>

<p>"Good." Rugh walked down to the tram junction and boarded a
city-bound tram.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Rugh's telephone rang. The caller was
Harry.</p>

<p>"Our friend's camped on your door-step," reported the
journalist. "Appears to care nothing for me. Followed you
immediately you moved off."</p>

<p>"Good work, Harry," replied the investigator. "He's bit off
more than he can chew. Meet you at Mellor's, in Castlereagh
Street, in ten minutes."</p>

<p>Well within the time limit Rugh walked down the steps of the
underground café, and looked round. Harry was seated at the far
end of the room.</p>

<p>"Where's our friend?" he asked, when the assurance man sat
down at the table.</p>

<p>"Keeping a lonely vigil outside my offices," laughed Rugh. "He
doesn't seem to be aware there is a way out into George Street,
through the King's Arms Hotel."</p>

<p>Harry laughed.</p>

<p>"Can you get back that way?"</p>

<p>"Up to six o'clock. Why? Do you suggest I should make it a
habit to come and go by the back door?"</p>

<p>"Depends on who he is watching for. If it's anyone with brains
your private exit will soon be stopped. If it's one of the Surry
Hills thugs with a bump of curiosity, an hour, or so, will damp
his enthusiasm for a detective career."</p>

<p>"You suggest I should not return to my offices this
evening?"</p>

<p>"No necessity, is there? Well, make it a day, for once in your
young life. By the way, Rugh, do you want anything kept out of
the <i>Star</i>? About our work to-day, I mean?"</p>

<p>Rugh thought a moment.</p>

<p>"Don't mention names and addresses," he said at length. "That
would make trouble for the Surry Hills people."</p>

<p>"What about the Tiger Lily?"</p>

<p>Rugh's face brightened.</p>

<p>"I want that lady," he replied, crisply. "She knows a lot if
she'll talk. Trouble is to get hold of her."</p>

<p>"Give her a good write-up in the rag," suggested the
journalist.</p>

<p>"Have you enough to go on?" Rugh questioned, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Can imagine a lot," grinned the journalist. "Guess she's the
sort of lady who'd get the wind up quickly. That is, if I make it
strong enough."</p>

<p>"Good. Go-get-'er, Harry. See if you can make her come to us.
The more angry she is the better. Miss 'Tiger Lily,' in a real
dinkum paddy, may help us solve many problems."</p>

<p>"Consider the matter accomplished." Harry drew some papers
from his pocket and made a few shorthand notes. "What about
to-morrow, old man?"</p>

<p>"I'm stumped," confessed the investigator, regretfully. "So
far as I can see, we're up against a brick wall."</p>

<p>"We didn't do so badly to-day," objected Harry.</p>

<p>"We've established the fact that Ruth Collins was in Surry
Hills on the Saturday preceding the discovery of her corpse. We
know something of her associates, and&mdash;that's all." Rugh
made a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>"What about the shooting business, and the row in Frozene
Lane, early Sunday morning?"</p>

<p>"Mere conjecture. There's nothing definite to connect those
happenings with the murder. No, Harry, the two principal pieces
of evidence we have for our day's work are: Ruth Collins'
presence in Surry Hills at nine o'clock on the Saturday night,
and the fact that she was a member of a 'push,' one of which is a
motor mechanic, and has access to motor cars."</p>

<p>"What about Richards?" asked the journalist, collecting his
hat. "Are we to give him the dinkum dope?"</p>

<p>"No reason why not." Rugh rose from his seat. "Will you give
him a call, Harry? I'm taking your advice. It's a day."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="first">THE afternoon <i>Star</i> featured The Tiger
Lily in a double column front page story. Harry Sutherland had
drawn freely on his imagination, but the story read true to life.
The Tiger Lily was drawn as a quick-tempered, wayward girl of
Slumland. A girl that lived the life of Sydney's underworld, yet
contrived to keep herself unsullied and wholesome. She stood out
against a sordid, shadowy background, on which flickered pictures
of crude, hectic excitement. Very deliberately the writer had
shown the ties of friendship which bound the Tiger Lily to the
victim of the Little Bay tragedy. Maudie Wheelson was indicated,
briefly, as the third of the group, and the shooting in Little
Buckingham Street, detailed in a few terse sentences. Underlying
the story was a deliberate provocation, designed to rouse the
Tiger Lily to expostulation.</p>

<p>Soon after midday Harry telephoned the assurance
investigator.</p>

<p>"Anything fresh?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. The Tiger Lily story was great," replied Rugh. "Didn't
think you had it in you."</p>

<p>"Thanks." Harry's dry tones cut clear across the wire.</p>

<p>"Of course, I am alluding to the sentimental side of the
story," dug in Rugh, with a chuckle. "Sentiment's not your strong
suit, old man. You'll never write a successful 'sob-sister'
story."</p>

<p>"Go to &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surry Hills?" interposed the assurance man, quickly. "They
fine you for using bad language over the telephone."</p>

<p>"Do you think it will fetch her?" asked the <i>Star</i> man,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Should do so." Rugh thought for a moment. "I'd advise you to
keep in the office this afternoon. The Tiger Lily may call, but
more probably she won't. My tip is she'd telephone first,
suspecting a police trap."</p>

<p>"Humph! Probably. Never thought of that. Guess I'll hang
round."</p>

<p>"What about McAdoo? How's he taken it?"</p>

<p>"Dead sore." A quiet laugh came along the wire. "Sweet as sour
apples."</p>

<p>"Mind he doesn't get the connection," warned Rugh. "He'll
smash your schemes if he does."</p>

<p>"Funny thing." Again Harry laughed. "He likes the 'Lily'
story. Appears to think it's an atmospheric story, turned in as a
kind of friendship's offering. Even warned me, if the lady was
real, she'd kick up a dust. Said I'd have to pacify her, if she
did. He hadn't time to smooth out the kinks for staffmen who
didn't know their work."</p>

<p>"Can you get her up here?" asked Rugh.</p>

<p>"Doubtful. As you say, she'll probably suspect a police trap.
Any way, old man, I'll see you're in at the interview.
S'long."</p>

<p>Rugh was disinclined to leave his office. Any moment Harry
might ring up to say the Tiger Lily was at the <i>Star</i>, or
had telephoned. On the story this girl of Sydney's underworld
might tell, if she could be induced to speak, depended the
direction of his future work.</p>

<p>For the time he had neglected the search for Colin Carson and
his daughter. A visit to the agents for Rexine Chambers had
resulted in the negative information that no one of the name of
Carson had occupied offices in the Chambers.</p>

<p>One line of inquiry remained untapped. Rugh picked up the
telephone, and called "Information." Getting the connection, he
asked for Mr. Gleeson.</p>

<p>"Rugh Thornton speaking," he said, when Gleeson came to the
telephone. "I want to trace a man who was in Sydney some twelve
years ago. Colin Carson. No, Carson. Yes? The address? Rexine
Chambers, Pitt Street. He was there twelve years ago. Gave that
address on a deed."</p>

<p>He listened intently for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"No," he exclaimed. "Give me any Carsons you have registered.
Any date, anywhere. Tomorrow! Yes, that will do. Thanks."</p>

<p>Teddy Marlow entered the office and placed a card on the desk.
Rugh nodded. A minute later and Wilbur Orchard entered the
room.</p>

<p>"Thought I would come up and see how you were getting on with
the Carson Loan case," he explained, dropping into a chair by
Rugh's desk.</p>

<p>"Nothing to report, so far," Rugh made a wry face. "There
seems to be no trace of Colin Carson."</p>

<p>"That's what the detectives said," commented the managing
director of the Balmain and South, "I thought you might have
better luck."</p>

<p>"Why?" Rugh faced round on his visitor, suddenly. He fancied
the man flinched slightly at the direct question.</p>

<p>"The Little Bay Murder," said Orchard, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Do you think Rita Carson is identical with the woman found on
the sandhills at Little Bay?" asked Rugh.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think." The assurance director made a
gesture of despair. "There is the matter of the telephone
message, y' know."</p>

<p>"A very slender clue on which to form a theory that an attempt
is to be made to defraud your company," commented Rugh.</p>

<p>"Why did the man telephone me if there was nothing behind his
talk?" queried Orchard testily.</p>

<p>"That is a matter I may be able to explain later." Rugh
smiled. "In fact, Mr. Orchard, I hope to be able to relieve your
mind on many points shortly."</p>

<p>"How's that?" Orchard nearly jumped out of his chair.</p>

<p>"I am awaiting the arrival from Queensland of the marriage
certificate of Ruth and William Collins. That certificate, I am
confident, will show that the dead woman was not the heiress of
Colin Carson, nor, in fact, any relation at all."</p>

<p>"That will not solve the matter of the loan," objected the
director.</p>

<p>"You believe a claim will be put in shortly for the repayment
of the loan, Mr. Orchard," replied Rugh. "When that claim is made
I shall be ready to test the legality of the claimant. Until
that, all I can do is to try and find a line of enquiry that will
lead me to Colin Carson, dead or alive."</p>

<p>"You have not succeeded in tracing Carson's daughter?"</p>

<p>The investigator looked at the director steadily. Wilbur
Orchard appeared to be awaiting his answer with more than
ordinary interest.</p>

<p>"You have had my advice on the question as a whole, Mr.
Orchard," he answered slowly. "I am certain your solicitors will
advise you to the same course of action. At the same time I can
assure you I shall not abandon the quest for Colin Carson and his
heiress."</p>

<p>The assurance director rose from his seat with almost a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>"I am glad you speak so confidently, Mr. Thornton," he said,
as he shook hands. "Still, young men are always confident."</p>

<p>Rugh puzzled over Orchard's last observation. The remark
struck him as almost a direct challenge. Wilbur Orchard did not
believe that the investigator would succeed in his quest. He
spoke as if failure would almost be a relief to him.</p>

<p>Rugh had hardly settled down to his work again when Inspector
Richards was announced.</p>

<p>"What's Sutherland's game?" blurted out the burly officer as
he entered the room. "These stories the <i>Star</i> are printing
are hitting right at the police force. Causing a lot of talk,
too."</p>

<p>"Have you asked Harry?" countered Rugh.</p>

<p>"He came to me last night and spilt a lot of dope about Ruth
Collins being seen in Surry Hills late on the Saturday
night."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"What's the good of all this talk? We have a
witness&mdash;three, in fact&mdash;who'll swear the woman went to
Little Bay on a train at four in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"People who did not know her," commented the investigator.
"Harry gave you the names and addresses of the people we dug
up?"</p>

<p>"Witnesses!" Richardson sniffed disdainfully. "All of 'em
sly-groggers we've had over and over again."</p>

<p>"None the worse for that, Richards," Rugh laughed, "They knew
the woman intimately. Your witnesses identified her by a
photograph that was so old that her intimates hardly recognised
it is of her."</p>

<p>"They're reputable persons," protested the officer.</p>

<p>"Then the police have given up using pimps?" asked Rugh, in
mock surprise. "I suppose, in the near future, plain clothes
constables will he abolished. The whole department will he put in
uniform. Say, Richards, you'll look fine, dressed up."</p>

<p>"No jury would believe your witnesses," argued the officer. "A
smart lawyer would utterly discredit them."</p>

<p>"Then find witnesses who knew the woman alive, and knew her
movements on the day before she was found at Little Ray. Another
thing, Inspector"&mdash;Rugh's voice hardened&mdash;"there's no
necessity to put plain clothes men on to dog Harry Sutherland and
myself."</p>

<p>Richards sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"No need of heat," replied Rugh, steadily. "A plain-clothes
man dogged Harry and me around Surry Hills yesterday. It appears
I was the immediate object, for, when we separated, the man stuck
to my trail. Harry dodged him until he camped on the doorstep of
this building. He then telephoned me and I took over the job.
Your man reported back at Headquarters 8.47 p.m."</p>

<p>The Inspector's face turned a dusky red. He muttered some
unintelligible words under his breath.</p>

<p>"I have always advised the Department of any knowledge I
considered of use to it. If the Department wishes to watch me I
cannot prevent the insult, but I can keep what information I
obtain to myself, and use it for my sole benefit. Another thing,
Richards, the next flat-footed fool who camps on my trail will be
photographed, and the photograph published."</p>

<p>Teddy Marlow entered the office.</p>

<p>"A lady to see you, Mr. Thornton."</p>

<p>"All right, Teddy. In one second the Inspector is
leaving."</p>

<p>Richards hesitated a moment, and then, without a word, left
the room.</p>

<p>The investigator glanced down at the slip of paper his cleric
had placed on his desk. It bore three words:</p>

<p class="cp"><i>The Tiger Lily.</i></p>
<br>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="first">RUGH snatched at the telephone, and rang up the
<i>Star</i> offices.</p>

<p>"Thornton speaking. Tell Sutherland, here. Come right in."</p>

<p>He turned from the instrument to meet the coldly suspicious
eyes of a tall, beautifully-formed girl, standing in the doorway.
She stood with her left hand resting on her hip, the right hand
plunged into the pocket of a rather gaudy sports jacket.</p>

<p>"So it was a police trap, after all," she said slowly with
deep scorn in her voice. "Can't the dicks do their own dirty
work?"</p>

<p>Rugh was silent. The girl's deep blue eyes held him
fascinated. She was beautiful, in an almost barbaric fashion.
Dark, with jet black hair, coiled around her head in a manner old
fashioned, but wonderfully becoming. Lips full, and curved in a
perfect bow, their deep scarlet accentuating the vivid colouring
of her dusky beauty.</p>

<p>"Did you hear the number I called?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>"Call that number and ask who is speaking," suggested the
investigator. He moved quietly away from the desk and sat down by
the window.</p>

<p>The girl hesitated a minute. Then she crossed the room and
lifted the receiver.</p>

<p>"Go on," encouraged Rugh, as the girl paused. The Tiger Lily
replaced the receiver, and laughed. "You win. 'Sides I know the
<i>Star</i> number. I was going to see them, but Shorty Matt said
I had better see you."</p>

<p>"Good," Rugh rose from his seat and pushed forward a deep
lounge chair, invitingly. "Sit here. It's more comfortable than
the seat I reserve for ordinary callers. So you came to see me
about the article in to-day's <i>Star</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yep. Shorty says you're safe." The girl seated herself
gracefully.</p>

<p>Rugh studied his visitor for a few minutes. The Tiger Lily was
apparently of Irish descent. Only from the Green Island came the
large languorous blue eyes, and the luxuriant crown of black
hair. Her figure was as near perfect as could be and her small
shapely feet would have roused the envy of any woman.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say," Rugh confessed with a slight
laugh. "I can't call you the Tiger Lily, can I?"</p>

<p>The girl echoed the laugh, and slightly blushed.</p>

<p>"You might use the 'Lily' alone. That's what the 'dicks' do,"
she suggested with a slight grimace. "My name is Dalton,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" Rugh asked inquisitively.</p>

<p>"No one calls me that now," the Tiger Lily laughed slightly.
"We don't use surnames where I come from."</p>

<p>"Where you come from," Rugh repeated the words half under his
breath. "You don't belong there Lily Dalton."</p>

<p>The girl sprang to her feet, indignant.</p>

<p>"I do belong there," she cried, her cheeks flushing with a
rich dusky colour, and her eyes sparkling. "It's my home, and
they're my people. Oh, I know what you think. I can speak
different from them. Do I?"</p>

<p>Her air of natural grace fell from her as a garment discarded.
Her shoulders drooped, and the corners of her finely curved lips
coarsened.</p>

<p>"I tells yer it's my 'ome, an' why shouldn't it be. I'm th'
Tiger Lily, an' don't yer fergit it. Naw, what d'yer want wi'
me?"</p>

<p>"Don't, Lily." Rugh sprang to his feet and seizing her by the
shoulders, shook her vigorously. "Drop it, I say. Drop it."</p>

<p>The girl stood for moment gazing deep into his indignant eyes.
Then with a low laugh she slipped from under his hands, and
seated herself again. Rugh stood before her for a moment, a great
perplexity in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said lamely. "I don't know why I did it. It
was unpardonable."</p>

<p>The girl leaned forward, her eyes on Rugh's face.</p>

<p>"Sit down," she commanded, gently. "You are so tall it is
difficult to look all the way up there. I surprised you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You more than surprised me." Rugh passed his hand over
his eyes. "It was like seeing a beautiful picture hideously
defaced. It hurt."</p>

<p>"A beautiful picture?" The girl made a quaint grimace.</p>

<p>"Why do you live in the Hills?" asked Rugh, impulsively.</p>

<p>"It is my home."</p>

<p>"You don't speak like them. You are a lady by birth and
education. What have you in common with them?"</p>

<p>"Humanity." The word came softly and clearly like the sound of
a distant bell.</p>

<p>"You are a social worker, then?"</p>

<p>The Tiger Lily laughed.</p>

<p>"A social worker," she mocked. "I, the Tiger Lily. Haven't
they told you. I carry a knife in my stocking. See."</p>

<p>She lifted her skirts slightly, and with a queer, quick motion
produced a long thin-bladed knife, resembling an Italian
stiletto.</p>

<p>"The Tiger's Tooth." She balanced the knife on the palm of her
hand, her eyes mocking him. Then with a swift change of manner:
"The Tiger Lily's friend."</p>

<p>"But why stay there? It's dangerous. Have you no relations, or
friends?"</p>

<p>Lily shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>"It's my home. And home is never dangerous to those who love
it. Yes. Love it." She started from her chair and walked
agitatedly up and down the room. "Why do you ask me these things?
I thought I had forgotten."</p>

<p>"Forgotten what?" Rugh asked the question gently.</p>

<p>"Forgotten that I was ever other than the Tiger Lily." The
girl swung round on him with a flash of defiance. "What do you
want with me?"</p>

<p>"To help you."</p>

<p>"To help me?" she laughed bitterly. "You help me? To what? To
softer and finer clothing. To sweeter and daintier food? To lie
more softly, to speak more gently. And why?"</p>

<p>She made an imperative gesture, as Rugh commenced to
speak.</p>

<p>"Men have offered me as much before. They have promised me
more, that I might give them&mdash;all. No, no, Mr. Thornton. You
enticed me here, nicely, but not for that." She stooped and
mockingly patted her knee. "Remember the Tiger Lily's tooth. It
bites deep."</p>

<p>The daring challenge faded out of her eyes, and, with a little
shrug of self-repression, the girl returned to her seat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rugh Thornton is perplexed," she gently mocked. "I
thought he would have administered the third degree. Or is it
that he waits for the support of his friend, Harry Sutherland, of
the <i>Star</i> newspaper?"</p>

<p>"I have been told you were a friend of Ruth Collins." Rugh
said slowly. "I cannot believe it."</p>

<p>"Poor Ruth. Cannot the unfortunate have friends?"</p>

<p>"But she was a&mdash;" Rugh hesitated.</p>

<p>"A street woman," Lily finished the incomplete sentence. "Why
do you not say it? You are speaking to the Tiger Lily, of Surry
Hills, not to one of your lady friends. The Tiger Lily cannot be
a prude."</p>

<p>"You puzzle me," exclaimed Rugh abruptly. "Are you the Tiger
Lily? I cannot believe it."</p>

<p>"Have you not seen?" Her tone was significant. "Because I come
to you on your social plane using the language your mother and
sisters use, you say 'It cannot be.' What proof do you want?
Shall I show my teeth again, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her manner changed. The perfect lips parted in gay laughter.
Her eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"Rugh. Rugh Thornton, you are a quaint man. I shall call you
'Rugh' and you shall call me 'Lily.' Look, I trust you."</p>

<p>Again the flash of skirts and the keen edged blade lay on her
palm. With a careless gesture she tossed it on the table.</p>

<p>"Rugh, I am disarmed. The Tiger Lily is at your mercy. What do
you want of her?</p>

<p>"You asked me if I knew Ruth Collins," Lily became thoughtful.
"Why? Will you revenge her? Will you seek through Sydney's
underworld for her slayer and deliver him to justice. I believe
you would, Rugh. You have the eyes of a crusader."</p>

<p>"Do you know the murderer?" asked Rugh bluntly.</p>

<p>"And if I do? What profit is that to you?" Lily mocked. "Will
you take me to Police Headquarters, and deliver me as witness for
the Crown? What would your friend Inspector Richards say? Would
he thank you, or would he tell you, as he told you this
afternoon, when you spoke of Shorty Matt and Mrs. Vaughan, that
he must have witnesses of unimpeachable character?"</p>

<p>"You heard that?"</p>

<p>"The door was open, and the good Inspector spoke heatedly. No,
my dear Rugh. He would tell you he could not believe me."</p>

<p>"I'd wring his ugly neck," muttered Rugh, viciously.</p>

<p>Lily laughed richly.</p>

<p>"He would call me the 'Tiger Lily', and speak of my 'tooth'
that bites deeply. He would tell Rugh Thorton, assurance
investigator, it was impossible to place in the witness box the
Tiger Lily of Surry Hills&mdash;and Long Bay Penitentiary."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="first">"YOU'VE been in prison?" asked Rugh,
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Why not?" The girl laughed defiantly. "There are few living
in the 'Hills' who have not been there, or had some relation in
gaol. Yes, I've been in prison, my dear Rugh."</p>

<p>"For what?" Rugh nodded towards the knife lying on his
desk.</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders, carelessly.</p>

<p>"My dear boy, you are altogether too inquisitive."</p>

<p>The door swung open quickly and Harry Sutherland entered, to
stop dead, staring in amazement at the beautiful girl in intimate
conversation with his friend, by the window.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Rugh," he stammered awkwardly. "I was out
when your message came through. You said&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hesitated and looked at the girl. Rugh rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Come in, old man, and find a seat. And&mdash;let me present
you to Miss Lily Dalton."</p>

<p>"Alias the Tiger Lily," laughed the girl. "Mr. Thornton, you
should better prepare your friend."</p>

<p>"Just as well for him to have a shock or two to his conceit
now and again," grinned the investigator. "I had one, you
know."</p>

<p>Harry dragged forward a chair.</p>

<p>"It was a shock," he laughed. "I didn't quite expect&mdash;You
know, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak Australian, or should I say, English?" Again the girl
laughed at the puzzled expression of the journalist.</p>

<p>"You certainly speak, and are different to, the people I have
met in Surry Hills." Harry took off his glasses and polished them
vigorously.</p>

<p>"Then you think people should speak according to the district
in which they live?" asked Lily, slightly defiant. "You wished to
see me, Mr. Sutherland, and you took rather a peculiar method of
securing an introduction."</p>

<p>"I didn't think&mdash;" commenced Harry.</p>

<p>"Please don't apologise," Lily laughed sweetly. "Your article
might have drawn the Tiger Lily into your trap had she been the
girl you supposed. I was advised to see Mr. Thornton by a mutual
friend. Now you have me here had we better not get to facts? You
want to know who murdered Ruth Collins?"</p>

<p>"Yes?" Both men leaned forward eagerly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot tell you that. I have no evidence, only
suspicions." Lily spoke slowly. Then noticing the look on Harry's
face she continued. "No, Mr. Sutherland, I do not know. If I knew
definitely&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her face hardened and her fists clenched. It was as if the
spirit of the Tiger Lily possessed her again.</p>

<p>"You have suspicions'?" asked Rugh.</p>

<p>"Yes." Lily's face cleared. "Suspicions, yes, but I want
facts."</p>

<p>She paused and looked from one man to the other.</p>

<p>"Suspicions don't count. We must find the murderer. I came
here to explain certain things Mr. Sutherland hinted at in his
article, and to inform you of certain facts. Perhaps those facts
may lead you to the men you seek."</p>

<p>"You are speaking of the shooting affray?" asked Rugh.</p>

<p>"Yes." Lily hesitated. "Perhaps you had better let me tell my
story in my own way."</p>

<p>She sat for some minutes, looking out of the window.</p>

<p>"One of the girls in Surry Hills was in trouble. No, I am not
going to mention her name, as she has no part in the murder. She
knew me and sent word round to my rooms that she wanted to see
me. Theresa was very ill, and I did what I could to help her. I
wanted her to go to the hospital, but at first she refused. Later
I managed to persuade her, and sent Ruth to telephone for the
ambulance.</p>

<p>"While Ruth was away Theresa told me she had been mixed up in
the big robbery at a drapery store in Newtown. Her boy was 'under
the smoke' and he and his friends had left the swag with her. She
whispered to me where it was hidden.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think I should have immediately told the
police." The girl looked at the men defiantly. "But the police
are our natural enemies in the 'Hills.' I did not. I promised I
would see that the rent of her room was paid regularly, and keep
the key in my care until she or her boy returned.</p>

<p>"While we were talking Maudie Wheelson came in. She must have
been listening outside, for while she was talking to Theresa her
eyes were roving around the room. I told Maudie I had sent for
the ambulance, and she went away. Ruth came back, and a few
minutes later the ambulance men and the doctor arrived. The
doctor examined Theresa and asked me to prepare her for the
journey to the hospital. Then they took here away.</p>

<p>"I tidied up the place, and Ruth helped me. Before I left I
saw the woman who rented the house and told her I would pay the
rent and keep the key. I warned her and her husband not to let
anyone into the room.</p>

<p>"No one in Surry Hills questions the Tiger Lily's orders,"
continued the girl proudly. "The man and woman agreed to guard
Theresa's room, and there are few in the district who would dare
to try and force a way past him. Outside I found Maudie waiting
for us. She told Ruth that Leo was looking for her. Ruth appeared
much distressed.</p>

<p>"I don't like Leo," said Lily. "He is real bad, one of the
worst men in Sydney. He's got plenty of money&mdash;I believe his
people are well off&mdash;and plenty of influence. If he had not
he would have been in prison long ago.</p>

<p>"While we were talking, Leo and a man called Ginger came up to
us. Leo asked Ruth where she had been. Ruth replied with me,
attending Theresa, who had just been taken to hospital.</p>

<p>"Theresa. Is it Arty's Theresa?" asked Leo, glancing at
Ginger.</p>

<p>"Before I could interpose Ruth had said 'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'She's got th' Newtown swag,' exclaimed Ginger. 'Thought that
bloke had it. What about searchin' her room, now we've got a
chance.'</p>

<p>"I told the men I had the key and that they would not get into
the room while I had anything to do with it.</p>

<p>"Leo urged and tried to threaten, but I wouldn't give way.
Then he turned on Ruth and swore at her for calling me in to
Theresa. He called her all the filthy things he could think of,
until I turned on him. He tried to grab me, but Ginger got
between us and warned him it was dangerous to meddle with me.
Then Leo commenced swearing at me.</p>

<p>"For some reason this roused Ruth. She turned on Leo and told
him to shut up. He struck at her with his fist, but only grazed
her shoulder. At that Ruth became strangely quiet. She said, 'You
know what I said I would do the next time you struck me.' Then
she walked right up to him and whispered a few words. Leo turned
strangely white.</p>

<p>"'You've threatened that before,' he said thickly. 'I'll
murder you, you she devil. I'll get you somehow, you&mdash;'</p>

<p>"He looked so terrible that Maudie screamed and started to run
away. Ruth ran after her, and I followed.</p>

<p>"It was then the shots were fired. I looked back and saw Leo
with a gun in his hand. He fired three shots, one of them
striking the pavement at my feet. Then Ginger caught at the gun
and wrenched it out of his hand.</p>

<p>"We ran into Buckingham Street and up the hill. At the corner
of Elizabeth Street I saw Mrs. Vaughan standing with another
woman. A little way past them we separated, Ruth went home with
Maudie Wheelson and I went to my rooms."</p>

<p>Lily ceased speaking and looked at Rugh.</p>

<p>"I know what you are thinking," she flashed. "You, with your
conventional surroundings, cannot understand the people of the
'Hills.' You think I should have found a policeman and complained
to him. You forget the police are not our protectors. They are
our oppressors. The police and your laws can do their own dirty
work."</p>

<p>"I won't say that I'd go as far as that," impulsively spoke
Harry, beaming at the girl through his glasses. "I'd never betray
a pal, whatever he'd done. The law could be damned before I
would. But these men were not your friends."</p>

<p>"If I had sent for the police and complained of Leo, he would
have told them of Theresa and the stolen property in her room,"
said Lily.</p>

<p>Rugh laughed.</p>

<p>"May I ask a few questions, Miss Dalton?"</p>

<p>"I will answer if I can," replied the girl calmly. "You will
remember what Mr. Sutherland said: 'I cannot betray a pal.'"</p>

<p>"That's understood," replied the investigator. "You are
certain Leo threatened to murder Ruth?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely certain," declared Lily. "He shouted it out."</p>

<p>"You believe he murdered Ruth?" continued Rugh.</p>

<p>The girl hesitated for quite a while.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said at length. "I believe Leo carried out his
threat."</p>

<p>"Do you think Ruth had any information dangerous to the
man?"</p>

<p>"I cannot doubt it." Lily looked troubled. "If you had seen
his face when she spoke to him. It was terrible."</p>

<p>"His name is Leo&mdash;?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Leo Warrington," said the girl. "He lives somewhere in
Ultimo."</p>

<p>"What is 'Ginger's' name?" asked Rugh.</p>

<p>"Tom Pleiss."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"At Ultimo. He left Surry Hills when he joined up with Leo's
crowd."</p>

<p>"The shooting took place on the Thursday before the murder,"
commented Rugh. "When did you see Ruth Collins last, Miss
Dalton?"</p>

<p>"She called on me late on the Saturday night," replied Lily,
thoughtfully. "It was after midnight when she left my rooms. I
asked her where she was going, and she said to Maudie Wheelson's.
She used to live there."</p>

<p>"Which way would she go from your rooms to Maudie Wheelson's
house?" asked Harry quickly.</p>

<p>Lily thought a few moments.</p>

<p>"She would go down Elizabeth Street to Buckingham Street, and
then up the hill. There is a shorter way, but Ruth would not take
that."</p>

<p>"Then Ruth Collins passed the end of Frozene Lane between
midnight and one o'clock in the Sunday morning," exclaimed
Rugh.</p>

<p>Lily nodded, looking inquiringly at the investigator.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="first">"YOU say Ruth Collins went down Elizabeth Street
to Buckingham Street, leaving your rooms after midnight?" said
Rugh slowly. "In that event she would pass Frozene Lane about the
time Mrs. Vaughan heard the screams on the Sunday morning."</p>

<p>"What screams?" asked Lily anxiously.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vaughan told us she heard screams from the direction of
Frozene Lane between midnight and one o'clock on the Sunday
morning," explained Harry.</p>

<p>"I am going to couple that with the threat uttered by Leo
Warrington in your presence, Miss Dalton," said Rugh. "He
threatened to get her, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He got her," concluded the journalist savagely. "Mr. Leo will
have a lot to explain, it strikes me."</p>

<p>"Pure theory," expostulated Rugh. "Except for Miss Dalton's
story we cannot connect him with the murder."</p>

<p>"You must not bring me into it." Lily spoke earnestly. "I will
do what I can to help you, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, what?" asked Harry quickly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton knows. No," she added, seeing the question in
Rugh's eyes. "No, I have my own quest to follow. You cannot aid
me. No one can help me. I can only watch and wait."</p>

<p>"While there is a good deal of proof to be obtained," said
Rugh, after a quick look at the girl, "we have something definite
to go on, at last. Let me try and make a connected story of
it."</p>

<p>For a few minutes he paced up and down the room in
silence.</p>

<p>"First, we have Harry's theory. He claimed that the woman was
not murdered out at Little Bay," commenced the investigator
thoughtfully. "His evidence on the point is the stripping of the
body; the folding of the clothes and the planting of them on the
corpse; the absence of certain articles of clothing; the small
amount of blood on the ground; and the fact that, while certain
wounds were produced by a knife or other cutting instrument, the
clothing was neither cut nor bloodstained.</p>

<p>"James Smith has next to be considered. His story confirms
Harry's as to the body being brought to the spot after the
murder, possibly in a motor car. His statement that the body was
deposited in one place and then dragged to another is peculiar,
but tends to show that the inference that the murder was not
committed at Little Bay is correct. I am, however, perplexed by
the finding of the stocking and ring on the beach. I cannot fit
those facts into the problem.</p>

<p>"Miss Dalton confirms our investigations and adds considerably
to them. She confirms our discoveries that Ruth Collins was in
Surry Hills to a late hour on the Saturday night. We now know
that the police theory&mdash;that the woman went out to Little
Bay with a man by a tram leaving the City at four o'clock on the
Saturday afternoon&mdash;is incorrect. She was seen in the Cannon
Wine Bar at five o'clock. She was in Buckingham Street, and spoke
to Shorty Matt between nine and half past that night. She was
with Miss Dalton until after midnight.</p>

<p>"Ruth Collins was living with a man named Leo Warrington at
Ultimo. On the Thursday before the murder this man threatened to
murder her, and in fact fired three times after her and her
companions. Yet on the Saturday she was seen by Shorty Matt in
his company, some considerable time after the police state she
was seen to leave the city for Little Bay.</p>

<p>"Had not Ruth Collins been seen by Miss Dalton at a much later
hour, the evidence would have justified Leo Warrington being
called on to explain his movements between the hours of nine
o'clock on the Sunday evening and four o'clock on the Sunday
morning&mdash;the time the body was found. The task before us is
to find evidence that Ruth Collins arrived at Maudie Wheelson's
house on Sunday morning. Alternatively, where did she go after
leaving Miss Dalton's rooms?"</p>

<p>"That shall be my work," declared Lily, rising. "You will hear
from me soon, Mr. Thornton."</p>

<p>As she passed the desk Lily picked up the stiletto. At the
door she turned and smiled farewell at the two men.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm&mdash;" exclaimed Harry, polishing his glasses.</p>

<p>"Quite a common occurrence," observed Rugh gravely.</p>

<p>"The Tiger Lily is certainly a surprise. Seems to me you have
roused elements you will have trouble in controlling, Harry."</p>

<p>"It'll take some man to control that elemental," chuckled the
journalist. "She's a round dozen girls in one."</p>

<p>"And then a mystery."</p>

<p>"All women are that. The only difference in regard to the
Tiger Lily is that she is more of a mystery than the average.
What's the next move, Rugh?"</p>

<p>The investigator did not answer. He was standing in front of
the window, staring out over the roofs of the buildings opposite.
Harry gave him a quick glance, and then pulled out his pipe and
lit it.</p>

<p>At length Rugh thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered
over to his desk.</p>

<p>"What kind of a fool do you take me for, Harry?" he asked
quietly.</p>

<p>"Don't know," grunted the <i>Star</i> man, vigorously thumping
the tobacco in his pipe with a discoloured forefinger. "Sometimes
you're a damned lucky one. Other times, just ordinary."</p>

<p>"Wilbur Orchard was here this afternoon," said Rugh, with
seeming inconsequence.</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"He was anxious to know what progress I had made. On the
Carson Loan matter," he added after a slight pause.</p>

<p>"You told him?"</p>

<p>"I told him what I thought fit for him to know. Look here,
Harry. You remember my story of the interview with Orchard. The
time he told me the details of the Carson Loan?"</p>

<p>"Yep?"</p>

<p>"I spoke of the photograph of Rita Carson."</p>

<p>"Get into top gear," advised the journalist. "Damn this pipe.
It won't draw."</p>

<p>"You remember he spoke of Rita Carson as a schoolgirl. Do you
see anything strange in him having a photograph of Rita Carson as
a grown woman?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" Harry looked up, startled.</p>

<p>"I'm just a plain, ordinary fool." Rugh flamed with anger. "He
put one over on me, and I swallowed it, bait, hook and
sinker."</p>

<p>"What's his game?" Harry tousled his unruly hair.</p>

<p>"His game? I'll know that before long, and then&mdash;" Rugh
brought his hand down heavily on his desk. "What do you think of
his story, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Sounds fishy. 'Specially now you mention the photo fake. Why,
the man must have been in touch with Colin Carson, or his
daughter, quite recently."</p>

<p>"Or since the girl grew up," amended Rugh. "I want that photo
and then Wilbur Orchard will get the shock of his young
life."</p>

<p>Harry did not reply. He stretched his long legs before him and
laughed.</p>

<p>"Lord, man. To get one over on us like that. It's real rich.
What suckers he must take us to be."</p>

<p>"I doubt whether I should have noticed it, even now,"
confessed the investigator. "Somehow I got thinking of the Tiger
Lily, and wondering what sort of a schoolgirl she had been. Do
you&mdash;no. You haven't seen the photograph yet."</p>

<p>"You think the Tiger Lily may be the lost Rita Carson?" asked
the journalist curiously.</p>

<p>"No. The girl of the photograph is fair, and Lily is dark. Yet
I don't know. Things are in such a muddle. The girl of the
photograph may not be Rita Carson. Lily may be the girl I am
looking for. You heard what she said. She had a mission to
accomplish. What mission? What possible object can a girl like
her have in living in that abominable hole?"</p>

<p>"Steady, man!" The journalist placed a firm hand on his
friend's shoulder. "You're not going to fall for a mystery girl
of that sort?"</p>

<p>"She's good enough!" A gust of temper shook the man.</p>

<p>"A girl who consorts with prostitutes and bludgers," said
Harry gravely. "A woman who confesses to being a party to
receiving stolen goods. Pull yourself together, man. There's work
to do."</p>

<p>The journalist shook Rugh vigorously by the shoulder. With a
short laugh the investigator wriggled from under his friend's
heavy hand.</p>

<p>"All right, Harry," he laughed quietly. "I was dreaming a bit.
As you say, there is work to do."</p>

<p>"Trouble is, it's in such a tangle I don't know where to
start," grumbled the <i>Star</i> man. "What about asking Richards
to round up Leo Warrington and question him?"</p>

<p>"Richards is in a beast of a temper," said the investigator.
"You set him going with your Surry Hills and James Smith
stories."</p>

<p>"Good enough. Say, Rugh, are you certain the police are
square?"</p>

<p>"Richards assured me he would resign before he would let up on
the hunt for the murderer."</p>

<p>"Humph. Yet he sticks to that exploded tram conductor story,
in spite of the evidence we've laid before him. I don't think
there is much to choose between your friend of the Balmain and
South and Inspector Richards, of the C.I.B."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Harry?</p>

<p>"Both of them could tell a story we know nothing of as
yet."</p>

<p>"You think Richards knows about the Carson Loan matter, and is
holding off on the Little Bay murder because of it?" asked Rugh,
much astonished.</p>

<p>"A bit involved, old man," grinned the journalist. "I should
suggest the same strings that tie Inspector Richards hamper your
friend, Wilbur Orchard."</p>

<p>Rugh took a dozen quick turns up and down the office. Then he
returned to his desk.</p>

<p>"You suggest, Harry, that Ruth Collins is Rita 'Carson?'" he
asked gravely.</p>

<p>"That, or someone is interested in making matters look
so."</p>

<p>"Then Richards must have known of the telephone message to
Wilbur Orchard stating Rita Carson would be found on the beach at
Little Bay?"</p>

<p>"No." Harry spoke positively. "Richards is not a crook, but
the man behind him is. Our police friend is holding off the
direct line to the Little Bay murderer because there is a string
on him. At the same time he is secretly following up the clues we
have given him. Witness the two men who trailed us up Surry
Hills. One dogged you, but we never saw the other again. What was
his business, and what friends did he have in the
neighbourhood?"</p>

<p>The <i>Star</i> man paused and poked, curiously, at his
pipe.</p>

<p>"I'll tip Richards is holding off until the Carson Loan
business matures. Then he will jump in with a sensational arrest.
Get me?"</p>

<p>Rugh lifted the receiver from the telephone.</p>

<p>"I'm going after Wilbur Orchard," he said briefly. Then he
gave the exchange the Balmain and South telephone number.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="first">WILBUR ORCHARD looked up from some letters he
was signing when Rugh was shown into his room the following
afternoon. He nodded briefly, but did not rise from his seat.</p>

<p>"Hope your business is not lengthy, Thornton," he said
querulously. "I'm extremely busy this afternoon. Up to my eyes in
it. Can give you ten minutes, not a moment more."</p>

<p>"Five minutes will do," replied the investigator. He fancied
the assurance director looked worn and thin. Certainly he had
lost his usual business alertness, and talked too much.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"I want to see that photograph of Rita Carson. The one you
showed me the other day."</p>

<p>"The photograph of Carson's girl?" said Orchard. "Of course I
have it. Why do you want it?"</p>

<p>"I should like to see it again."</p>

<p>Orchard swung round on pivot chair to the wall safe. Then,
with his hand on the knob of the safe he hesitated, and looked
round to Rugh.</p>

<p>"What do you want to see it for?"</p>

<p>"I came across a girl the other day it might fit," answered
the investigator briefly.</p>

<p>Orchard pulled the packet of papers out of the safe and untied
them on his desk. Picking out the panel photograph he passed it
over to Rugh. The investigator looked at it earnestly.</p>

<p>"May I keep this, Mr. Orchard?" he asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"The best line of investigation I can go on is to try and
trace up Rita Carson. Probably some schoolgirl friend has kept up
a correspondence with her. You have no further information to
give me?"</p>

<p>"None," Wilbur Orchard huddled the papers together and tied
the tape round them. "Keep the photograph if you want to. Can't
see what good you can make of it."</p>

<p>"Possibly it may be of the utmost value when you explain how
it came into your possession," said Rugh slowly and
distinctly.</p>

<p>"Into my possession?" The director turned a shade paler.
Nervously he swung round to face the wall safe. He appeared to
have difficulty in closing the door. "I told you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should dislike you to repeat what you told me at our first
interview." Rugh spoke sternly. "I suggest you give me a full and
true explanation of how you became possessed of a woman's
photograph when you speak of Carson describing his daughter as a
schoolgirl."</p>

<p>Orchard turned swiftly to face the investigator. His face had
lost its pallor and a dull red colour had crept up to the roots
of his hair.</p>

<p>"You are impertinent, Mr. Thornton," he said thickly. "I have
given you the information I possess. Now you are deliberately
insulting me to cover your gross incapacity to conduct the
inquiry. I shall immediately consult my Board with a view to the
Balmain and South withdrawing from the syndicate employing
you."</p>

<p>"That is a matter I am not considering at present. Until I
receive formal notice of the withdrawal of your company I shall
conduct the investigation on the lines I think best."</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard drew a piece of paper towards him and wrote
rapidly. Signing his name with a flourish he passed it across the
desk to the investigator.</p>

<p>"There is formal notice of the company's withdrawal from the
syndicate," he stuttered. "You will be so good as to drop the
matter of the Carson Loan. I shall place it in more intelligent
hands."</p>

<p>Rugh took the paper and deliberately tore it in pieces. The
scraps of paper he deposited on the desk.</p>

<p>"I should suggest your burning these fragments personally."
The investigator laughed shortly. "I am not acting against you or
your company, Mr. Orchard. Neither am I dropping the inquiry.
Now, will you tell me how you became possessed of a photograph of
a grown woman when you spoke of a schoolgirl?"</p>

<p>"Give me that photograph!"</p>

<p>Rugh placed the photograph in his pocket. Then he rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>"I shall solve the problem, and the added mystery you have
endeavoured to enshroud it in," he remarked confidently. "Your
Board may then want to know why you withheld important
information from me."</p>

<p>He turned towards the door. Wilbur Orchard sat glowering at
him. Then, as Rugh grasped the door handle, the director made an
impatient gesture.</p>

<p>"Come back, Thornton," he called in a low voice. "I made a
mistake."</p>

<p>Without a word Rugh returned to his seat and waited. The
managing director fidgeted with his papers for some minutes.</p>

<p>"You suggest I did not tell you the truth about the Carson
Loan?"</p>

<p>"I suggest you omitted to inform me of certain essential
facts," corrected Rugh. "Those omissions have hampered me."</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"First, tell me how you became possessed of that
photograph."</p>

<p>The director turned to the wall safe and took out the Carson
papers. From them he extracted a large envelope, to which was
attached a slip of paper. This he passed across the desk.</p>

<p>The envelope was large enough to contain the photograph Rugh
had in his pocket. The investigator examined the attached paper.
It had been torn off an ordinary sheet of writing paper and bore
only two words: "Rita Carson."</p>

<p>Rugh turned to the envelope. It was made of brown manilla
paper, bag-shaped. It still bore the marks showing it had
contained some article similar in shape and size to the
photograph. It was addressed to "Wilbur Orchard, Esq., Balmain
and South Assurance Company, Ltd., Elizabeth Street, Sydney."</p>

<p>The postmark was badly blurred. In the circle were to be
distinguished the letters "S-DN&mdash;" at the top, and in the
centre Rugh could just distinguish a "3" below a "4." Underneath
were the figures "-92-."</p>

<p>"Posted at No. 3 or 4 office about 3 or 4 o'clock within the
last six years," observed Rugh thoughtfully. "The staggers used
on the obliterating machine will give the year and approximate
date."</p>

<p>"I received it about three weeks ago," replied the
director.</p>

<p>"Why did you conceal the fact from me?" asked Rugh
impatiently.</p>

<p>"It appeared so immaterial," the director replied weakly. "Had
it not been for the telephone message saying she would be found
on the sandhills at Little Bay I might not have referred to it at
all."</p>

<p>"And thus conceal the only clue you have to Colin Carson's
heiress," answered Rugh, with some bitterness. "There are three
classes of people you should give your fullest confidence to, Mr.
Orchard. Your lawyer, your doctor and your detective. In
ninety-nine cases out of every hundred these experts seize
on the one point you consider unimportant, as the vital issue."</p>

<p>"How can that photograph solve this problem?" asked the
director.</p>

<p>The investigator pointed to the photographer's imprint.</p>

<p>"The Lycon Studio will have the name and address of the
sitter. Within a couple of hours I shall know where to find this
lady. The question then will be to prove whether she is Colin
Carson's heiress or not. Now, Mr. Orchard, I am going to ask you
bluntly if you are withholding any more information, however
unimportant you may consider it."</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>"Not one thing," he replied earnestly. "I want to apologise
for my outburst of temper a while ago, Mr. Thornton. Fact is, I
am not well. This matter is worrying me a lot."</p>

<p>"Worry won't help either of us," advised the investigator.
"Place the matter in the hands of your solicitors. They will take
the matter into Court and obtain the financial relief required by
the company. In the meantime I will hunt up this young lady and
find out if she is Colin Carson's heiress. If she's not I'll soon
know why her photograph was sent to you."</p>

<p>"I don't like the idea of the publicity of Court procedure.
Find the girl and prove her to be entitled to the money and you
will not find the company ungenerous to her&mdash;or you."</p>

<p>The investigator walked down Elizabeth Street to the Law
Courts and then down King Street. Just before he reached Pitt
Street he turned in at a doorway framed with handsome showcases
and climbed to the first floor.</p>

<p>The Lacon Studios were at that time the fashionable
photographers of Sydney. The place was lavishly decorated, and a
very decorative young lady in short skirts and an Eton bob, came
forward to meet Rugh.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad if you will give me the name and address of
this lady," said Rugh, producing the photograph of the presumed
Rita Carson, and his card.</p>

<p>The girl looked at the card and seemed half inclined to
refuse. A glance at the handsome face of the investigator changed
her mind and, with a murmured request to wait, she vanished
through a curtain-hung door. In a few minutes she returned
accompanied by a short, fair, dapper-dressed man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton?" he asked, glancing sharply at the
investigator.</p>

<p>"That is my name."</p>

<p>"You have made an unusual request." The man paused and then
continued: "We do not give the names and addresses of our clients
to inquirers."</p>

<p>"You may be doing the lady a favour," said Rugh earnestly. "I
may tell you confidentially I have reason to believe she is
heiress to a considerable sum of money. I am acting for the
company holding the fortune in trust."</p>

<p>"Oh, in that case." Again the man hesitated and glanced at
Rugh's card. "I think I have heard of you, Mr. Thornton. You were
engaged on the Priestly case?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Rugh's lips hardened. The escape of Robert Priestly was
a sore subject with him.</p>

<p>"I think we can override our very strict rule on this
occasion," continued the manager of the Studios. "Especially as
you assure me it will be to the material benefit of the
lady."</p>

<p>He wrote a few lines on the back of Rugh's card and handed it
to him with the photograph. The investigator glanced at the
pencilled words and started.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"Miss Myrtle Seaton, c/o Mr. S. Brene, Hotel
Splendide, Sydney."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="first">OUTSIDE the studios Rugh Thornton looked at his
watch. It was twenty minutes past three. At four o'clock Sam
Brene, the Town Hall boss, could be found at his accustomed table
at the Hotel Splendide roof-garden.</p>

<p>The discovery that the photograph Wilbur Orchard had given him
was of Myrtle Seaton had not surprised Rugh. The manner in which
the photograph had been conveyed to the managing director of the
Balmain and South was typical of the methods of the grafter.
Myrtle Seaton was to be put forward as the heiress of the Carson
fortune. What part had the girl in the attempted fraud? Why had
the grafter sent the photograph to Orchard? Rugh asked the
questions of himself, but could give no satisfactory answer. He
had not met Myrtle Seaton, although her name was familiar to him
as being one of Sydney's younger set. Vaguely, he seemed to
remember that she was an adopted daughter of the grafter&mdash;he
called her his niece.</p>

<p>While many scoundrels had gathered round the personality of
Sam Brene, he had so far had the decency to keep the girl out of
his schemes. She had not been allowed to come in contact with the
many crooks and criminals surrounding the big grafter. Sam Brene
was accessible to all who sought his aid, and had the money to
pay for it, but he had drawn a rigid line between the partners of
his roguery and his private life. Now Myrtle Seaton was to be
brought into a scheme that aimed at defrauding one of the largest
assurance companies of a fortune. She was to be put forward to
claim the wealth that had accumulated in the name of Colin
Carson. Was she an accessory to the fraud, or the unwitting
victim of the master rogue? Rugh had not decided on a course of
action when he reached the doors of the Hotel Splendide.
Discarding all set lines of action, he decided to let events take
their own course, and to be prepared to take advantage of any
opportunity. Crossing the vestibule, he entered the elevator and
ascended to the roof garden. Only a few people were gathered
there, scattered among the palm-enclosed tables. A few couples,
half-hidden amid the luxuriant foliage, were intent on matters
entirely personal. A group of most modern matrons, bobbed-haired
and short-skirted, discussed early tea, and latest scandal, at a
table almost in the centre of the room, making the empty spaces
ring with their shrill tinkling laughter. In a half-hidden music
gallery a string band softly played an old-time waltz. The place
wore the look of a stage, just before the rising of a curtain.
The scenery was set; it waited only the arrival of the
players.</p>

<p>The investigator looked around until his eyes fell on a table
set far in the left-hand corner and almost entirely hidden from
the main portion of the room by banks of palms. In that corner,
some twelve months previous, he, then a reporter on the
<i>Star</i> staff, had interviewed Sam Brene. It had not been a
satisfactory interview. The gangster, in a moment of boastful
expansiveness, had spoken too freely. Rugh had seized on the
admissions made by Sydney's self-elected boss, only to have his
story deliberately "killed" by "Chink" McAdoo, the <i>Star's</i>
Chief of Staff, and friend of Sam Brene.</p>

<p>Rugh sauntered down the room to the half-hidden corner table.
He had almost reached it when he was intercepted by a soft-footed
waiter.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir. That table's engaged."</p>

<p>"By Mr. Sam Brene?" The investigator smiled slightly, and his
fingers sought his waistcoat pocket. The man looked dubious.</p>

<p>"It's all right," Rugh reassured the man. "I'm not a
reporter."</p>

<p>"The table is reserved for Mr. Brene," answered the waiter;
"but I could not allow you to sit there without his permission,
sir."</p>

<p>"I want to see Mr. Brene," said Rugh. "He does not expect me.
Perhaps you could seat me at a table Mr. Brene will pass?"</p>

<p>His hand slipped from his pocket to his side, touching the
waiter's hand on the way. The man moved to a table, and pulled
out a chair.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brene always passes this way, sir. Tea, sir? Thank you,
sir."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the man returned, pushing a small service
waggon before him.</p>

<p>"The <i>Star</i>, sir?" he suggested, laying the afternoon
paper on the table. Then in a low voice he added: "Mr. Brene will
be here any minute now."</p>

<p>Rugh opened the newspaper. He had not seen Harry Sutherland
that day, and was curious to know how the journalist had handled
the information he had received from the Tiger Lily.</p>

<p class="newspaper">RANDWICK CONSTABLE SOLVES<br> LITTLE BAY
MYSTERY.<br>
<br> The Murdered Woman in Surry Hills Until After
Midnight.<br>
<br> Police Headquarters Theory Exploded<br> by
Sensational Discovery of<br> Constable Nicholls.</p>

<p>Rugh laughed softly. Harry Sutherland had carried the war into
the enemy's camp, and had struck a blow at the prestige of the
detective branch heads. Inspector Richards would find it hard to
forgive the journalist.</p>

<p>True to his promise, Harry had withheld the name of the Tiger
Lily. The article was a review of the known facts regarding the
murder, preceding the startling information they had obtained
from the Mystery Girl, Lily Dalton. The central figure of the
story, under the <i>Star</i> man's expert manipulation, was
Constable Nicholls, of Randwick, and an excellent portrait of
that officer occupied a prominent place amid the
letter-press.</p>

<p>"Harry will make, or mar, that man," said Rugh to himself. He
laid down the newspaper, and picked up the teapot. "Richards will
fairly howl with rage."</p>

<p>The waiter passed the table and, without looking at Rugh,
tapped the table top with his fingers. Rugh looked up. Sam Brene
was entering the big glass dome of the roof-garden.</p>

<p>Sam Brene claimed to have come from Ireland. There are many
who openly averred that, on the voyage from the Green Island to
Australia, the big grafter lingered long in Uncle Sam's country,
placing the finishing touches on his education. Years of fraud
and lack of exercise had made the Town Hall boss gross and fat.
Barely five feet six inches in height, he had a girth that made
him look almost square. His legs were short and he waddled
absurdly under the long over-developed body. The head was big and
almost devoid of hair. Pendulous jowls overhung a short neck,
buried in an over-large collar, decorated by a shoe-string tie of
golden yellow. Impressively ungainly, the man waddled across the
big room, obsequiously attended by the head waiter. Another
attendant hurried forward to the reserved table and drew out a
chair, commanding a view of the room, yet partly hidden by the
palms.</p>

<p>Rugh set down his cup, and leaned back in his chair. If he
could attract the attention of the big grafter he would have a
chance to accomplish his objective.</p>

<p>When Sam Brene was level with Rugh's table the investigator
stood up and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brene, surely you have not forgotten me?"</p>

<p>The little pig-eyes peered up from under the puffy lips.</p>

<p>"I never forget." The voice was full, almost rich. Pitched
low, it held a peculiar ring of command. "Your name is Thornton.
Yes, Rugh Thornton. You're a journalist. I never give interviews
now."</p>

<p>"Nor do I ask for interviews&mdash;now," retorted Rugh,
crisply. "Not for publication, at all events. I have forsaken
journalism."</p>

<p>"Or has it forsaken you? If I remember the interview you
obtained from me was never published." Brene chuckled
nastily.</p>

<p>"You know the reason for that," replied Rugh, restraining his
temper with difficulty. "But that's ancient history. I wonder if
you would have tea with me?"</p>

<p>Brene looked at the investigator curiously.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"The pleasure of your company at tea." retorted Rugh.</p>

<p>"If I let you buy me a tea, what do you want?"</p>

<p>The grafter was well known for his directness.</p>

<p>"I may be able to do you a service."</p>

<p>"People don't do me services without requiring a bigger
service in return." Brene looked at Rugh shrewdly for a minute.
"Come to my table. You shall have tea with me. That's all you'll
get."</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, the grafter waddled on to the
table where the patient waiter stood behind the chair. Rugh
followed at the tail end of the little procession.</p>

<p>"Sit there." The 'boss' pointed to the chair directly opposite
him. "You don't come up here often?"</p>

<p>"Over a year since I was here last."</p>

<p>"Then you have come to see me?"</p>

<p>"Not altogether. I came to see you, and a lady."</p>

<p>Sam Brene grunted. His pig-eyes searched the investigator's
face.</p>

<p>"What are you doing now?"</p>

<p>"I am investigator for a group of assurance companies." Rugh
hesitated, and then added: "Didn't Mr. Priestly inform you of
that?"</p>

<p>"Priestly?"</p>

<p>"Of the Arctic Seas Assurance Company. He was tried for
fraudulent promotion, but escaped conviction."</p>

<p>"The prosecution failed?"</p>

<p>"The jury was squared, fixed, or bluffed. Which was it, Mr.
Brene?"</p>

<p>The fat man laughed loudly.</p>

<p>"I am going to like you, Rugh Thornton," he said, when he
recovered breath. "You've got a nerve, all right."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I felt sore at the time, but that passed. I
admire, now, the wonderful ingenuity of the scheme."</p>

<p>Brene slowly poured out his tea, and sugared it freely. Then,
after a noisy gulp of the hot liquid, he looked up at Rugh.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>The investigator took from his pocket the photograph of Myrtle
Seaton and handed it to the grafter.</p>

<p>"I want an introduction to that lady," he said simply.</p>

<p>Not a muscle of the grafter's face moved as he looked at the
photograph. Rugh could have sworn he had never seen it before.
After peering at it for a while, Brene laid it on the table.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I have information that may be of value to the lady."</p>

<p>"You want paying for it? How much?"</p>

<p>Rugh's face flamed with anger. He half rose from his seat.</p>

<p>"I want nothing from you or her," he answered hotly.</p>

<p>"Sit down." The boss's voice was cold and unemotional. "Tell
me?"</p>

<p>"Thank you. I prefer to deal with the lady, direct." Rugh
paused a minute, and then continued: "Let's understand one
another, Mr. Brene. I don't trust you, and I refuse to speak
until I meet Miss Seaton."</p>

<p>A slight smile flickered on the thin lips of the master
grafter. He was looking over Rugh's head.</p>

<p>"Am I late, uncle? Awfully sorry, but I met Mrs. Revel
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rugh sprang to his feet&mdash;to face the original of the
photograph he had handed to Sam Brene.</p>

<p>"Myrtle, dear." There was amusement in the big boss's voice.
"Let me introduce Mr. Rugh Thornton, who has been pestering me
for an introduction to you. He professes to be one of my greatest
enemies. Thornton, you have your wish. My niece, Myrtle Seaton,
the original of the photograph."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="first">A QUIET smile of amusement lingered around the
thin lips of the Town Hall boss as Rugh assisted the girl to her
seat, and disposed of her packages. Almost imperceptibly he moved
the photograph until it lay immediately beside her plate.</p>

<p>"My photograph." Myrtle Seaton picked up the card and scanned
it rapidly. "This is not the one I gave you, uncle."</p>

<p>"No." Brene's eyes twinkled. "I think too much of your gift,
my dear, to bring it into a public tearoom. Mr. Thornton showed
it me, just before you arrived."</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton?" A little pucker came between the girl's smooth
brows, and her voice grew slightly formal. "May I ask how you
became possessed of my photograph, Mr. Thornton?"</p>

<p>Rugh thought quickly. Brene had, maliciously, placed him in an
awkward position. He looked up and caught the cool, level glance
of grey eyes on him. Distrustful as he was of the big grafter, he
could not doubt those eyes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilbur Orchard, the managing director of the Balmain and
South Assurance Company, handed it to me this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilbur Orchard?" repeated the girl, puzzled. "I don't
think I know him. Do I, uncle?"</p>

<p>The investigator covertly watched the big grafter, as he
answered the girl. He had expected some sign to escape the man's
abnormal control, when he deliberately laid his cards on the
table. But Brene only smiled.</p>

<p>"I don't think we have met Mr. Wilbur Orchard," said the
grafter, blandly.</p>

<p>"The photograph was sent to Mr. Orchard by post about three
weeks ago," continued Rugh. He took from his pocket the manilla
envelope with the slip of paper attached, and handed it to Myrtle
Seaton.</p>

<p>"Rita Carson," read the girl, deliberately. "But this is my
photograph. Why should it be sent to Mr. Orchard with the name of
another girl on it?"</p>

<p>Sam Brene yawned, openly. He looked at the investigator, and
Rugh could have sworn the little pig-eye deliberately winked.</p>

<p>"Very strange, my dear. Very strange, indeed. In fact, I am
deeply interested. Perhaps Mr. Thornton can add further marvels
to his story."</p>

<p>"The photograph was followed a few days later by a mysterious
telephone message to the effect that the original would be found
dead on the sandhills at Little Bay." Rugh spoke brutally, and
with intent to shake this man from his unusual placidity.</p>

<p>"Oh." Myrtle Seaton dropped the envelope as if she had touched
something unclean. The big boss sat up straight and patted her
hand sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton should not have startled you like that, dear,"
he said soothingly. "You must forgive him. He is a criminal
investigator, and I believe men of that calling develop a certain
callous bluntness."</p>

<p>"I must apologise," said Rugh quickly. "I should not have
blurted out my information so bluntly. Mr. Brene's remark held a
challenge I could not resist."</p>

<p>"It startled me." The colour slowly returned to the girl's
face. "Do you mean to say someone sent my photograph to Mr.
Orchard, and then telephoned him he would find me at&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would not have startled you so much if I had told my story
in the right way," interrupted Rugh, contritely. "May I commence
again, and tell it in due sequence?"</p>

<p>"You did startle me for a moment," said Myrtle brightly. "But
it is fearfully interesting. I want to hear your story, Mr.
Thornton. Don't you, uncle?"</p>

<p>"If it continues in the same startling fashion, I shall be
much interested. Go on, Thornton. I said a while ago I was going
to like you."</p>

<p>"My story commences twelve years ago," commented Rugh, without
taking notice of Brene's sarcasm. "You were then a schoolgirl,
Miss Seaton."</p>

<p>"Eleven years old," said Myrtle, promptly, with a laugh. "I
have not yet reached the years of discretion concerning my
age."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I would have liked to ask the question, but did
not dare. You understand I am speaking in confidence. Certain
matters I must mention might be harmful to the company I
represent."</p>

<p>The girl nodded brightly. Rugh did not look at the big
grafter. He had no intention of speaking of anything that would
give the man any hold on the Balmain and South.</p>

<p>"The Balmain and South at that time was in urgent need of a
large sum of money," the investigator continued. "Applications to
the financial houses met with demands for almost impossible
terms. Luckily, the company was able to get in touch with a
private lender who was willing to advance the sum required on
fairly reasonable, if somewhat peculiar, terms."</p>

<p>"May we know the amount?" asked Sam Brene, blandly. "Money
always interests me."</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand pounds," answered Rugh promptly. "An unusual
condition was specified by the lender. I need not deal with that
in detail, only stating that the condition has greatly increased
the sum repayable."</p>

<p>"The money has not yet been repaid, then?" murmured the big
grafter.</p>

<p>"The loan was to have been repaid to the lender, personally,
at the expiration of twelve months. Unfortunately, he
disappeared, and neither he nor his daughter have been heard of
since. That is, up to to-day."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Thornton? Do you connect my photograph
with&mdash;?" Myrtle hesitated.</p>

<p>"The money was lent by a Mr. Colin Carson, and was to be
repaid to him, or his daughter, Rita, in the event of his
death."</p>

<p>Rugh was watching the big grafter keenly. He expected some
sign of more than ordinary interest when he mentioned Colin
Carson's name, but, save for the flicker of the half-closed
eye-lids, Brene's face was expressionless.</p>

<p>"Colin Carson." The girl mentioned the name, thoughtfully. "I
don't think I have ever heard the name before."</p>

<p>"Your father's name was&mdash;?" suggested the
investigator.</p>

<p>"Seaton. Edward Seaton," put in the big boss, quickly. "Edward
Seaton married my sister. Funny thing, her name was Rita."</p>

<p>"So is my name, uncle," laughed Myrtle. "I was named Rita
Myrtle, but dad always called me Myrtle."</p>

<p>"So it is. I had forgotten." The podgy hand of the grafter
gently patted the girl's hand. "Suppose there's a respectable sum
in the bank for Rita Carson by this time, Thornton?"</p>

<p>"Roughly, two hundred thousand pounds," answered Rugh.</p>

<p>"Two hundred thousand pounds! Why that's an immense fortune."
The girl's eyes sparkled with laughter. "What a pity dad's name
was not Colin Carson, uncle."</p>

<p>"Ted Seaton was a queer chap," said Brene, thoughtfully. "I
shall have to look over his papers."</p>

<p>"The matter will go into court," warned Rugh.</p>

<p>Brene laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Suppose that's a warning, Thornton. No, Ted wasn't the man to
leave fifty thousand pounds knocking about. He'd have been down
on your company for principal and interest to the very day. Two
hundred thousand pounds!"</p>

<p>"But why was my photograph sent to Mr. Orchard as Rita
Carson?" questioned Myrtle.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we may ask Mr. Brene that?" said Rugh, mockingly.</p>

<p>"I?" Sam Brene opened his little eyes wide, in astonishment.
"Really, Thornton, you are amusing."</p>

<p>"I'll see the matter is not amusing when I get to the end of
the trail," declared the investigator, ominously.</p>

<p>"When you get to the end of the trail," murmured the big
grafter, with a slow laugh. "Looks to me you've taken on too big
a contract, boy. Others have failed, y' know."</p>

<p>"I don't think Mr. Thornton will fail," declared Myrtle, with
a glance of encouragement at Rugh. "It have been quite a victory
for him if he could have marched me down to Mr. Orchard's and
presented me as the missing heiress."</p>

<p>Rugh did net make any reply. He was watching the big grafter.
"Others have failed." Swiftly he reviewed the conversation. He
had said nothing of the work of the detectives Wilbur Orchard
had, over ten years ago, placed on the track of Colin Carson.</p>

<p>"Others have failed." Sam Brene had, for one fleeting second,
lowered the guard he had held against the attack of the assurance
investigator. In that brief second Rugh had looked in&mdash;on
what?</p>

<p>Sam Brene was looking at hint with a queer, twisted smile on
his cruel lips. The eyes, small and puckered, were not smiling.
They bored right into Rugh's face, as if attempting to read his
secret thoughts. The big grafter knew he had slipped. How would
he retrieve his mistake?</p>

<p>The investigator looked round the tea-room. Many of the tables
were now filled with careless, chattering groups. Now and again
fleeting glances were cast towards the corner where sat the man
who held the city of Sydney in a secret, vicious grip. They
little sensed the battle fought over the tea-cups&mdash;a battle
of words, resulting in the defeat of the elder man. "Others have
failed." Simple words, but revealing much to the man who had
watched and waited for them.</p>

<p>Rugh's eyes wandered towards the big glass doors. A noisy
group was standing by them. Around the group came a man of medium
height, square built, and with a ruddy, determined face.</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard! Rugh turned swiftly to look at Brene. The big
grafter was looking across the room, towards the doors. A slight
twitching of the nostrils betrayed a tenseness of thought.</p>

<p>Orchard walked across the room as if making for Brene's
private corner. A few yards away he raised his eyes, and saw the
investigator. A brief hesitation, and he dropped into a vacant
chair.</p>

<p>"Sorry my tale ended so unsatisfactorily, for you, Miss
Seaton." Rugh laughed as he rose from his chair. "I am sorry I
must ask you to excuse me. I have an appointment at my office in
a few minutes."</p>

<p>The girl held out her hand frankly.</p>

<p>"I am sorry my father disappointed you," she retorted,
smilingly. "But what would I have done with all that money?"</p>

<p>"Shops, theatres, and dances are wonderful aids." Brene
laughed, somewhat too loudly. "Glad you stopped me, Thornton.
You've given us quite an interesting time. Find me here any
afternoon. Come and tell us how you get on. Myrtle will be glad
to know, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Of course I will," added the girl, quickly. "Come soon."</p>

<p>Rugh sauntered slowly up the room. At Orchard's table he
stopped with well-simulated surprise. "Mr. Orchard!"</p>

<p>The managing director looked up.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Thornton. Didn't see you when I came in. Been with
friends?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sam Brene and his niece, Miss Seaton." Rugh spoke
carelessly. "Through Brene I thought to introduce you to the
missing heiress."</p>

<p>"No?" Orchard looked startled. "What have you discovered?"</p>

<p>"Too early to talk." Rugh laughed as he moved on towards the
exit.</p>

<p>There was a small crowd waiting for the elevator. Rugh stood
waiting. Presently he felt a small hand touch his arm. Looking
down, he met Myrtle Seaton's troubled glance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton," she said, hesitatingly, "it's awfully rude of
me, but do you mind telling me the name of the man you spoke to
after you left us?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, Miss Seaton." Rugh smiled into the eyes of the
girl. "That was Mr. Wilbur Orchard, the managing director of the
Balmain and South Assurance Company."</p>

<p>His eyes passed Myrtle's face and met the narrowed glance of
Sam Brene standing some distance away. The big grafter smiled and
nodded.</p>

<p>Why had Brene sent his niece to him to ask that question? The
matter troubled the investigator. It was inexplicable.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="first">RUGH walked slowly down to his offices. He had
much to think of, and many of the puzzle pieces refused to fit
into the places he tried to assign to them.</p>

<p>Sam Brene had committed himself on one point. He had known of
the inquiries made by the detectives engaged on the Colin Carson
Loan case, some ten years previous. How had he obtained that
knowledge? The reports of the detectives had, no doubt, come
before the Board of Directors. Brene would certainly be
acquainted with some of the directors, although he disclaimed
acquaintanceship with Wilbur Orchard.</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard had, on entering the roof garden, deliberately
looked across to the half-hidden table reserved for the big
grafter. He was walking towards that corner when he caught sight
of the investigator. Then, he had changed his mind and dropped
into the nearest vacant seat.</p>

<p>The grafter and the managing director were acquainted, Rugh
was convinced of that, but&mdash;</p>

<p>Sam Brene had deliberately sent Myrtle Seaton to stop him in
the vestibule of the roof garden, and inquire the name of the man
Rugh had spoken to on his way to the door. Why had he done this?
The only reason the investigator could guess was to cover the
blunder he had made.</p>

<p>These were pieces of the puzzle he could find no proper place
for.</p>

<p>Teddy Marlow met him as he entered his office.</p>

<p>"There's a big policeman waiting to see you," announced the
youth with his usual air of mystery.</p>

<p>"Inspector Richards?"</p>

<p>"Nope. A plain 'john.' A big bulky one with a red face and
road crusher feet," explained Teddy with a wide grin. "Lor, and
he thinks a wonderful lot of himself."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sutherland been round?"</p>

<p>"Ain't seen him to-day, Mr. Thornton. What are you going to do
with the 'john?'"</p>

<p>"Bring him in, Teddy, and we'll have a look at him. If he's
not too big we may have him for tea. You needn't wait, son. I
shall leave immediately I have attended to your 'john'
friend."</p>

<p>At the door of his office Rugh paused.</p>

<p>"You remember the list of telephone calls you obtained from
the Exchange, Teddy. You have not mentioned them to anyone?"</p>

<p>"Not likely." The boy's face flushed with indignation. "As if
I should. Nothing goes out of this office, Mr. Thornton."</p>

<p>"Good boy." Rugh smiled gently on his sturdy little henchman.
"Now bring in your 'john.'"</p>

<p>A big burly man in uniform entered Rugh's private office a few
seconds later.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Constable Nicholls," said Rugh, quietly. "Sit
down and I'll attend to you in one minute."</p>

<p>The slack jaw of the man dropped. He stared at Rugh in
amazement.</p>

<p>"'Ow d'yer know my name, sir," he stuttered. "I'll swear I
never saw you, affore."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't get your photograph in the newspapers," laughed the
investigator. "Besides the sun flashed on your collar as you
entered. Constable Nicholls, 41593, of Randwick, is well in my
memory these days."</p>

<p>"That's 'ow you did it." Nicholls breathed heavily, and sat
down with a jerk. "Give me quite a start, y' did, sir. I'm good
at noticing detail, myself, but you beats me."</p>

<p>"Just a chance shot," reassured Rugh. "Now, constable I want
one moment at the telephone, and I am at your service."</p>

<p>The investigator turned to the instrument, and gave the
Balmain and South number.</p>

<p>"The Balmain and South? Put me through to Mr. Orchard. That
Mr. Orchard? Thornton speaking. How near the exact time can you
go in reference to the mysterious message last Monday? Good. Nine
fifty-five. Looked at your watch just a moment before. Yes.
That's all. Thanks. No, nothing fresh, yet."</p>

<p>The investigator opened his desk and pulled out the sheet of
telephone calls Teddy Marlow had obtained from the Exchange.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">9.51, B77747. Call booth, G.P.O.<br> 9.56,
B727270. Hotel Splendide,<br> 10.0, Y0507. Matthew Cummings,
hairdresser.</p>

<br>

<p>The lines stood out from the list. A call had been put through
to the Balmain and South from the Hotel Splendide within a minute
of the time given by Wilbur Orchard.</p>

<p>Sam Brene lived at the Hotel Splendide. He had lived there for
at least half a dozen years. Was it a coincidence that an
"unknown" had telephoned from the hotel where the big grafter
lived, and conducted his nefarious business. It could hardly be a
coincidence. Yet Brene had stated, definitely, he was not
acquainted with the managing director of the Balmain and South.
When Rugh had informed Orchard he had had tea with Brene and his
niece, the managing director had not shown by word, or sign, he
was acquainted with them.</p>

<p>"Now constable." Rugh turned to Nicholls. "What can I do for
you?"</p>

<p>"I'm lookin' for Mr. Sutherland," explained Nicholls. "'E
asked me t' call at 'is orffice this aft'rnoon at three."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"'E warn't there. I waited a time 'an th' young lady at th'
phone ses as 'ow 'e might 'ave come 'ere, to you. So I came
hover."</p>

<p>"He's not been here," answered the investigator.</p>

<p>"I happened to ask my clerk as I came in if Mr. Sutherland had
called. The boy informed me he had not."</p>

<p>"Then, what am I t' do?" The big burly constable looked
ridiculously helpless. Rugh could not but laugh as he pictured
the hero of Harry's sensational story in the man before him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's at his office now," suggested the investigator.
"We'll soon see."</p>

<p>The girl at the switchboard at the <i>Star</i> offices was
explicit that Harry had gone out to lunch and had not returned.
There had been a number of callers, and telephones for him.</p>

<p>"Did he say where he was going?" asked Rugh, much puzzled.</p>

<p>"He said he was going to lunch. Any message, Mr.
Thornton?"</p>

<p>"Ask him to get in touch with me as soon as possible. I am
going home. Let me see. What's his private telephone number?
XY11141. Good. I'll give him a ring."</p>

<p>A call on Harry's private telephone proved fruitless.</p>

<p>"Went out to lunch and hasn't returned," reported the
investigator to the constable, with a smile. "Harry is a bit
careless over appointments."</p>

<p>"But 'e wouldn't miss me." Nicholls leaned forward
mysteriously. "It's about th' story fer tomorrer's paper."</p>

<p>"That's serious." Rugh barely restrained a laugh. "Perhaps he
will turn up later. He doesn't have to turn in his copy until
after nine to-morrow, you know."</p>

<p>"An' I 'ave ter be on duty at seven t'night." Nicholls spoke
woefully. "I comes orf duty at four in th' mornin', but I ain't
fit ter talk then. It's 'ard work, an' takes a power o' brain,
let me tell yer."</p>

<p>"Well, you've got from four until seven&mdash;three
hours&mdash;before Harry will rouse you," suggested Rugh. "That
should restore some of the wasting tissues."</p>

<p>Nicholls shook his head, sadly.</p>

<p>"A man ov my weight, an' brain power, wants a lot ov
sleep."</p>

<p>"Sorry, constable."</p>

<p>"So am I, sir. Why, there won't be no story for the people
termorrer if anythin' 's 'appened ter im."</p>

<p>"How are you getting on with the case?" asked Rugh. It was
plain Harry had roused the lion of ambition in the constable's
breast.</p>

<p>"Gettin' on, sir." Nicholls wagged an impressive forefinger.
"It won't be long affore I lays me 'ands on th' man as brought
that young woman ter 'er death. An' when I gets 'im, I gets th'
bracelets on 'im, an' 'e's done. 'E'll 'ang fer it. I've got th'
h'evidence."</p>

<p>"A jolly good story in the <i>Star</i> to-day," observed
Rugh.</p>

<p>"It was, if I ses it myself." Nicholls swelled visibly, "An'
th' story's a credit t' Mr. Sutherland, I must say that. Th' way
'e grasped th' clues I give 'im. Why, I might 'ave trained 'im in
th' Force, m'self."</p>

<p>"What does Inspector Richards say?" asked Rugh, curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, 'im. 'E's jealous." Nicholls spat disgustedly. "Ses 'e's
'eard it all affore, an' there's nuffin' in it. Why, sir, if yer
knew th' number of people in Randwick as 'ave askt me 'ow I did
it you'd wonder 'ow th' State puts up wi' sich police. Not as it's th' rank an' file. They're intelligent enough. It's 'em as gits th' cushy jobs, through politics an' pulls. They don't know 'ow ter go about a difficult job as this, sir."</p>

<p>"You're certain you know who committed the crime?"</p>

<p>"Certain, sir! 'Course I am. Why, I'd 'ave published 'is name,
only Mr. Sutherland wouldn't put it in. 'E sed as 'ow th' paper
'ud get libelled, if 'e did."</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang. Rugh picked up the receiver and
listened a minute. Then he turned to Nicholls.</p>

<p>"Harry Sutherland is in hospital," he said tersely. "Knocked
down crossing Castlereagh Street this afternoon, and picked up
insensible. Afraid you won't be able to see him to-day,
Nicholls."</p>

<p>The constable had risen to his feet and stared, awestruck, at
the investigator.</p>

<p>"First th' woman. Then Archie Clarke, an' now 'im," he
ejaculated. "But I'll get 'em. I'll get 'em."</p>

<p>Picking up his cap the constable almost ran towards the door.
Rugh turned and looked after him.</p>

<p>"I wonder. I wonder if you are all the fool I took you to be,"
he murmured, half-aloud.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="first">"I SAY Harry Sutherland was not knocked down by
a motor lorry in Castlereagh Street, yesterday afternoon. He was
struck on the head with a sandbag, or some similar weapon."</p>

<p>Rugh Thornton made the statement coolly, and deliberately. He
had come to Police Headquarters from the bedside of his chum,
intent on rousing the Department from the strange apathy into
which it had fallen.</p>

<p>"Harry was unconscious when I arrived at the hospital last
night. This morning, however, he was able to talk. He describes
the affair. He gives certain details of happenings prior to being
struck, showing it was a deliberate assault, and not an
accident."</p>

<p>"You are insinuating the police have been negligent in their
duty, Mr. Thornton?" Inspector Richards tried to appear
indignant, an attitude much marred by his obvious air of
uneasiness.</p>

<p>"I am not insinuating, Inspector." Rugh outwardly cool, was
raging with passion. "I am making a direct charge. Harry
Sutherland was the 'white-haired boy' while he published the dope
the police handed out on the Little Bay murder. When he kicks
over the traces McAdoo tried to fasten on him, he is quickly and
effectually silenced."</p>

<p>"I have had enough of you," Inspector Richards flamed out at
the investigator. "You can get out of my office immediately. The
subject of your complaint will be reported to the
Inspector-General."</p>

<p>"You may report what you please. I am concerned with what you
propose to do."</p>

<p>"We are not in the habit of consulting the general public on
our actions." The Inspector flung open the door. "I'm busy."</p>

<p>Rugh did not stir from his chair.</p>

<p>"I am quite prepared for your attitude, Inspector," he said,
significantly. "Mr. Sutherland this morning signed a power of
attorney for me to act for him. Do you want to see it?"</p>

<p>The investigator held out a folded sheet of Paper towards the
police officer. After a moment's hesitation Richards snatched it
and read it rapidly.</p>

<p>"Your best course is to write in your inquiry, and it will be
dealt with in the usual run of business." The Inspector was
holding his temper with difficulty.</p>

<p>"Not good enough." Rugh smiled bitterly. "I am going from
here to my solicitors. I shall instruct them to apply for
warrants for the arrest of the owners of the lorry, the driver,
and the two men riding on it, for criminal assault. Harry states
a man on the lorry hit him with something. That is the only
course I can pursue unless I now receive a definite assurance the
police will act. There's going to be no inexplicable police
delays in this matter." Richards strode across the room until he
stood over the investigator.</p>

<p>"Am I to send for a constable to remove you?" he exclaimed
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I shall then take proceedings against that constable for
assault. Look here, Richards, you can't get away with it. Unless I
have now your definite assurance the police will take prompt
action to revenge Harry, I am determined to make the matter so
public that they will be forced to act. I have not forgotten
Archie Clarke."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Archie Clarke was assaulted when within a few yards of you
and another member of the police force. Yet his assailant has not
been arrested, and from the general appearance of things, is
likely to go free. Harry Sutherland is not going to share the
same fate. Either I have your immediate and definite assurances
that the persons concerned in the assault on Harry will be at
once arrested, or you will give me the names and addresses of all
connected with the lorry so that my solicitors can act."</p>

<p>"That information will be supplied to Mr. Sutherland, or his
solicitors, through the usual channels."</p>

<p>"You will not recognise this power of attorney?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Rugh laughed easily as he leaned forward in his chair.</p>

<p>"I think you will, Richards," he said, softly. "You will send
into the office and get me the information I require."</p>

<p>"Indeed." The Inspector strode to his desk and sat down.</p>

<p>"You will immediately give instructions for the arrest of the
driver and the other persons on the lorry. You will oppose bail
on the grounds there are other, and more serious charges against
these persons."</p>

<p>"Anything further?" Richards laughed sarcastically. "You are
not running this department, Mr. Thornton."</p>

<p>"Only that you will finalise the inquiry into the Little Bay
murder, at once, and arrest the men implicated."</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton. I warn you. Leave my room, or I will have you
removed."</p>

<p>"The police are going to great lengths to protect a murderer,"
said Rugh meditatively.</p>

<p>Richards put his finger on a desk button.</p>

<p>"Is Leo Warrington worth it?" added Rugh in a low tone.</p>

<p>The Inspector's face turned white.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Leo Warrington was the driver of the lorry, and Tom Pleiss,
alias Ginger, struck the blow.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Harry saw them the moment before he was struck."</p>

<p>"The evidence of a man suffering from concussion of the brain
would certainly not be considered conclusive by a magistrate,"
observed Richards contemptuously. "I cannot but think you are
suffering from overwork, Mr. Thornton. You appear to have these
men, Warrington and Pleiss on the brain."</p>

<p>"Then you refuse to give instructions for then arrests?"</p>

<p>"I tell you again," Richards swung round in his chair, almost
shouting. "The affair is a common street accident. Also you are
wrong in the names of the men on the lorry."</p>

<p>"Leo and Ginger are not connected with the attack on Harry
Sutherland? They were not concerned with the attack on Archie
Clarke? They had nothing to do with the Little Bay murder?"</p>

<p>Rugh paused and looked straight at the Inspector. After a
second he continued in a lower tone.</p>

<p>"Nor were Leo Warrington, Tom Pleiss and Ruth Collins
connected with the Park Murders; outrages bearing a peculiar
similarity to the Little Bay murder, especially in the fact that
the murderers have not, and probably will not, be
discovered."</p>

<p>"You charge these people?" asked Richards, incredulously.</p>

<p>"I tell you," Rugh spoke the words emphatically. "I tell you
Ruth Collins was murdered because, in a moment of anger on the
Thursday preceding her death she threatened these men she would
supply information to the police that would connect them with the
Park Murders."</p>

<p>"If Ruth Collins had come to us with that information the men
would certainly have been arrested. Look here, Mr. Thornton. You
seem to have information you have not laid before the Department.
We don't want to quarrel with you. In the past you have been a
good friend to us. We can do with friends for, it seems to be the
modern belief that the ordinary citizen, however law-abiding he
may be personally, should take up a non-committal attitude, if
not open antagonism, towards the police and their work."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You're mistaken." The Inspector spoke earnestly. "I'm not
dancing on the end of a string, as you insist on supposing, nor
are my brother officers. We have made inquiries on the
information you and Mr. Sutherland laid before me, and we're
convinced you're mistaken. The two men you charge are clearly
innocent of any complicity in the Little Bay murder."</p>

<p>"Have you examined them personally?" asked Rugh quickly.</p>

<p>"No." The Inspector spoke with reluctance.</p>

<p>The investigator thought for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Give me the information on Harry's accident I asked for. I
will only use it for private investigation. In return I will give
you a tip that may prove of value."</p>

<p>Richards turned to a pile of papers, and selected one.</p>

<p>"I had the information brought to me this morning to see if
there was anything more than an ordinary street accident in it,"
he observed. "Listen."</p>

<p>"Harry Sutherland, journalist, employed at <i>Star</i>
Newspaper Company Ltd. Knocked down by motor lorry in Castlereagh
Street, near Park Street at 1.45 p.m. on 11th inst. Lorry owned
by Cliff, Westerson and Co., Ltd., George Street South. Lorry
number 04153. Driver, Tom Preston, 11 Princess Street, Bondi.
Also on lorry, Richard Wills, 11 West Canterbury Street,
Petersham and William Watson, 14 Collac Street, Surry Hills.
Sutherland taken to Sydney Hospital on lorry and admitted
suffering from severe concussion and abrasions, face shoulder,
and right leg. Witnesses: William Smith, 1a Liverpool Road,
Petersham; Alec Brown, Castlereagh Stores, Castlereagh Street;
and Miss May Allan, typist, Wonder Motor Company, Castlereagh
Street. Signed, Arthur Green, constable."</p>

<p>Rugh wrote down the details rapidly.</p>

<p>"Your constable does not mention the presence of plain-clothes
officer Bailey," he observed, shutting up his notebook.</p>

<p>"Was he there?" Richards looked puzzled. "He should have
reported, or at least signed Green's report, as a witness. I'll
have a word with him."</p>

<p>"Don't. Wait awhile," advised Rugh. "There's a lot of funny
things going on around us. Plainly, Richards, I don't share your
faith in the Department. I think you would get on better if you
ignored a lot of the advice you get from the inside. Find out
where Warrington and Pleiss were yesterday midday, and between
midnight and four o'clock in the morning of the Sunday you found
Ruth Collins' body."</p>

<p>"Is that your tip?" asked Richards, disappointedly.</p>

<p>"It's a good one," retorted Rugh. "But I'll give you one that
may more appeal to you. I have a notion I can point out the house
where Ruth Collins spent her last few days. Will you go in on a
search warrant, and let me in on it?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Apply for a search for No. 13 Coomber Street, Surry Hills, in
the occupation of Henry Wheelson."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Get the warrant yourself. Make it for a disorderly house,
nothing else. You can't go wrong in that. Keep the whole thing
dark from everyone except the chamber magistrate. Then hold off
until you hear from me."</p>

<p>"What are you after there?"</p>

<p>"I'm guessing. May find something that will solve a lot of
questions puzzling me to-day. Now, I'm off, Richards. I shall
have a little talk with the owners of that lorry."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="first">LEAVING Police Headquarters, Rugh Thornton
turned into Elizabeth Street and entered the swing doors of the
<i>Star</i> newspaper offices. There, after a slight delay he was
admitted to the private office of Lorimer Osmond, the managing
editor.</p>

<p>"What's troubling you, Rugh?" asked the slight, grey-haired
man who controlled the most influential newspaper in the State.
"Some time since you favoured this office with a visit."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have been unwilling to subject myself to the
temptations of a journalistic atmosphere," laughed the
investigator. "Lord, it smells good. There's something in the
combination of paper, ink and oil in a newspaper office that gets
into a man's blood for good."</p>

<p>"So you've got it?" Osmond smiled reminiscently. "I've heard
the same remark from many a good man. And now. Want a job?"</p>

<p>"Nope. Come to see you about Harry. Saw him this morning. He
told me a strange story."</p>

<p>"Unlucky beggar. Meant to go round to the hospital to see him
to-day. Story worth publishing?"</p>

<p>"I should say so. Harry was sandbagged, or something of the
same sort. The 'run-down' story is a police fake."</p>

<p>Osmond drew a piece of paper towards him and noted down the
headings of the story as Rugh recounted them.</p>

<p>"Your trouble, chief," he concluded pointedly. "I don't want
that story used for twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"There's a reason behind that, young man?" queried the
newspaper man.</p>

<p>Drawing his chair nearer the desk Rugh detailed his interview
with Inspector Richards. From that he went on to the interwoven
stories of the Little Bay murder and the Carson Loan.</p>

<p>"A queer business," commented Osmond, when Rugh concluded,
"Harry told me something of this when he came to me over McAdoo's
head. I have made a few inquiries, but have reached no definite
conclusion at present. Now, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Harry is worrying about his story," said the investigator
bluntly. "He thinks now he is out of it McAdoo will kill it."</p>

<p>Osmond touched a button on his desk.</p>

<p>"Please ascertain from duty book who is detailed for the
Little Bay murder story," he said, when his secretary
entered.</p>

<p>The two men sat silent until the girl returned and placed a
slip of paper before the Chief. Osmond fitted on his glasses and
peered down at the paper.</p>

<p>"McAdoo states the story is not worth continuing. Duty book
shows nothing," read the managing editor. "Humph."</p>

<p>Rugh laughed.</p>

<p>"I am going to withdraw my veto on the immediate publication
of the assault story," he said. "Will you give it full space?
Here are police details."</p>

<p>He wrote rapidly for a few minutes and passed the sheets over
to Osmond.</p>

<p>"A 'sub' will lick that into a good scare story," he observed.
"But it must have your personal O.K. to save it from the
'Chink's' waste paper basket."</p>

<p>"You haven't forgotten your old disrespect for McAdoo." The
managing editor laughed. "I know he is down on you boys, but he's
the best man at his work in the State."</p>

<p>"Old names stick hard, chief," replied Rugh with a laugh.
"McAdoo's a good man at his work, but he always seems to have a
string tied to him somewhere. I'm certain of that."</p>

<p>"He's too good to lose, and strings can be cut," said the
<i>Star's</i> head. "Let me know how you get on."</p>

<p>Rugh turned back from the door.</p>

<p>"Look here, chief," he said in a low tone. "There's a big
story coming in on both the matters I'm handling. Have a good man
camping on my doorstep from about four o'clock this afternoon. He
must be prepared to go for twenty-four hours a day until the end
of the trail. I'll see he's in at the death."</p>

<p>Turning into King Street, Rugh cut through to George Street
and boarded a south-bound tram. Twenty minutes later he alighted
before a large block of buildings with the name <span class="smcap">"Cliff, Westerson and Co. Ltd."</span> blazoned across the front in large gilt letters.</p>

<p>At a rough wood counter the investigator presented his card
and requested an interview with the general manager. There was
some delay, but when Rugh scribbled across his card the one word
"accident," he was imediately shown into the private office of
Mr. Bertram.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton?" inquired the head of the firm when Rugh
entered the room. "We have heard nothing of an accident. Sit
down, please."</p>

<p>"The accident happened to Mr. Harry Sutherland, a special
writer on the <i>Star</i> newspaper," said Rugh briefly. "He was
knocked down by a motor lorry bearing your name yesterday in
Castlereagh Street."</p>

<p>"I should have been advised of that," exclaimed Bertram Cliff
angrily. He struck a table bell. "Mr. Simpson, at once," he
continued shortly, when a clerk entered.</p>

<p>A big, burly man, in shirt sleeves, entered the room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Simpson," said Bertram Cliff. "Mr. Thornton informs me
one of our lorries knocked down a gentleman in Castlereagh Street
yesterday. Why was I not informed of it?"</p>

<p>"That's the first I've heard of it, sir." The man looked
startled.</p>

<p>The general manager looked at Rugh.</p>

<p>"Have you a motor lorry bearing the license plate No. 04153?"
asked the investigator.</p>

<p>"Yes. She is one of our latest machines," answered Simpson.
"But she was in the garage yesterday. Something the matter with
her feed pipe."</p>

<p>"The police took the number of the lorry at the time of the
accident. I obtained it from Inspector Richards this
morning."</p>

<p>"That's very strange," said Mr. Cliff. "Are you sure,
Simpson?"</p>

<p>"May I use your 'phone, sir?" said the man, and receiving a
nod of assent, called up the garage.</p>

<p>"Two men called for the lorry yesterday morning," he reported
after a short conversation. "They bore an order on our notehead
to deliver the lorry to them. Said they would bring it back later
for the overhaul ordered, but that we were pressed for haulage
and had to have the use of it."</p>

<p>"Has it been returned?" asked Mr. Cliff.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then it has been stolen," exclaimed the head of the firm.
"This is serious, Simpson."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Simpson turned to the investigator. "If the police
stopped the lorry they took the name of the driver."</p>

<p>"The name given was Tom Preston. Two men were on the lorry
with him. They gave the names of Richard Wills and William
Watson."</p>

<p>"I don't know those names&mdash;" commenced Mr. Cliff.</p>

<p>"We've no one on the books of those names," interrupted
Simpson.</p>

<p>"Have you anyone employed here of the name of Leo Warrington
or Tom Pleiss!" asked Rugh curiously.</p>

<p>"No, sir. The names are strange to me." Simpson looked
worried. "Looks to me as if the lorry had been stolen."</p>

<p>"There's no doubt of that." Bertram Cliff turned to the
telephone. "We must inform the police at once."</p>

<p>"I should advise you to ring up Detective Headquarters,"
suggested the investigator. "Inspector Richards is handling the
accident case. Making it a special matter as Mr. Sutherland is a
personal friend."</p>

<p>The general manager hesitated, holding the telephone receiver
in his hand. He looked suspiciously at Rugh.</p>

<p>"I should add," continued the investigator quietly, "I did not
believe the car was involved in the accident while on your firm's
business. In fact, it was not an accident. Harry Sutherland was
deliberately sandbagged from the lorry."</p>

<p>The two men stared at the investigator in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Sandbagged?" exclaimed the head of the firm.</p>

<p>"It's too long a story to tell now. Sufficient to say Harry
Sutherland was close on the track of the Little Bay murderers,
and they took effective means to get him out of the way. Ring up
Inspector Richards and ask him to find your lorry and the men who
stole it. Also, please tell him I am in your office. He may wish
to speak to me."</p>

<p>Bertram Cliff rang up Police Headquarters, and for several
minutes talked earnestly with the Inspector, referring every now
and again to Simpson for details of the lorry. Finally he turned
to Rugh.</p>

<p>"Inspector Richards would like to speak to you, Mr. Thornton,"
he said, shifting the instrument across the desk.</p>

<p>"Thornton speaking, Richards."</p>

<p>"Thornton, yes. Say, it looks as if I owe you an apology for
this morning. They got one over me all right. I'm putting through
a general call for the lorry. Should get word any time."</p>

<p>"Did you get that warrant, Richards?"</p>

<p>"O.K. Anything further happened?'</p>

<p>"No. Can you execute to-night, later the better?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Midnight will suit me. I'll be back at my office about
four."</p>

<p>"Right-o."</p>

<p>From George Street South the investigator walked sharply to
the subway and through it to Buckingham Street. At the
tobacconist shop Rugh stopped and entered. Shorty Matt shuffled
forward, giving no sign of recognition.</p>

<p>"Cigar, please."</p>

<p>Matt placed the boxes on the counter and bent forward so that
his ear was only a few inches from the investigator's mouth.</p>

<p>"The Tiger Lily," Rugh whispered. "Tell her to telephone my
office where I can see her to-night about eight."</p>

<p>Rugh made his selection and lit the cigar, talking pleasantly.
Then with a short 'good-day' he left the shop. Shorty Matt had
given no sign that he had heard the whispered words, yet the
investigator knew he would hear from the Mystery Girl within a
few hours.</p>

<p>In Elizabeth Street the investigator mounted a city bound tram
and went down to his office. From there he telephoned Inspector
Richards.</p>

<p>"Rugh Thornton speaking," he said when he obtained connection.
"Any news?"</p>

<p>"Lorry found," replied Richards triumphantly. "Been standing
outside Darlinghurst Court House all night. Man on duty noticed
it, and a watch was kept to find the men in charge. No one
claimed it until I put through the call."</p>

<p>"Anything in it?"</p>

<p>"Anything in it?" repeated Richards. "What did you expect to
find in it?"</p>

<p>"Sandbag, lead-pipe or stick," said Rugh shortly.</p>

<p>"If a stick, Harry might be wrong. Either of the other two, or
the absence of a sandbag confirms his story."</p>

<p>"A long guess," challenged Richards. "We shall want better
evidence than that. But we'll get it."</p>

<p>For some time the investigator sat with his chair tilted back
and his feet on his desk. The end of the complex trail was in
sight, but even now he could only dimly foresee the climax. The
net was closing about the murderers of Ruth Collins. That very
night he confidently expected to obtain the evidence that would
ensure a conviction.</p>

<p>In regard to the Carson Loan, he still had large spaces to
fill in his line of reasoning. Still, he could now guess at the
sinister hand that was pulling the strings to defraud the Balmain
and South. A few more pieces of evidence and he could stretch out
a long arm and&mdash;</p>

<p>The telephone bell interrupted his reverie.</p>

<p>"Wilbur Orchard speaking," came over the wire when Rugh
announced his name. "I received to-day a letter from a firm of
solicitors making a claim for the repayment of the Carson
Loan."</p>

<p>"On whose behalf?" asked Rugh quickly.</p>

<p>"On behalf of Colin Carson. When can I see you?"</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="first">"WILL come down to you immediately," replied
Rugh. Then, as the manager of the Balmain and South was about to
speak, he added: "The less said through the telephone the better,
Mr. Orchard."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Rugh walked into the private room of the
managing director. Orchard came to meet him at the door and the
investigator, after a searching glance, decided that release from
the long suspense had done the man good. Orchard was once again
his old overbearing, brusque self, with the definite poise of the
successful business man.</p>

<p>"I've been trying to get you all the morning," Orchard
complained, when Rugh was seated by his desk. "Where have you
been?"</p>

<p>"Harry Sutherland, the <i>Star</i> criminal investigator, was
knocked down by thugs yesterday," replied Rugh briefly. "I've
been trying to mark 'paid' to their account."</p>

<p>"Sutherland," said Orchard reflectively. "I don't know him. He
is not connected with the Carson Loan case, is he?"</p>

<p>"He has been," replied Rugh grimly. "The Carson Loan case is
mixed up with the Little Bay murder in a most involved manner.
Harry will be in at the death for certain."</p>

<p>Orchard looked as if he was about to make some objection.</p>

<p>"Where's the letter from the solicitors?" asked the
investigator.</p>

<p>The managing director selected a letter from the pile on his
desk and passed it to Rugh. The letter was brief and direct. They
simply stated they had been instructed by their client, Colin
Carson, to demand the immediate repayment of the loan, with
interest, in accordance with the terms of the deed.</p>

<p>"Leferve and Saunderson," commented the investigator. "A firm
of first-class standing. What do you intend to do, Mr.
Orchard?"</p>

<p>"The matter must go before the Board," replied Orchard.
"Luckily I have been able to get a majority of the Board on the
telephone this morning, and have called a meeting for this
afternoon. I have telegraphed those I could not get in touch
with."</p>

<p>"Humph. Rather informal."</p>

<p>"I know that," Orchard snapped. "Business is not always run on
formal lines, Mr. Thornton. I intend to place this letter before
the Board and to get authority to negotiate. This afternoon the
secretary of the Board will issue the formal notices for a
meeting of the Board this day week."</p>

<p>"That will suit me," remarked Rugh.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Do you intend to follow the advice I gave you, Mr. Orchard,
and take the matter into Court for settlement?" asked Rugh.</p>

<p>"The Board will be averse to going into Court with the
matter," answered Orchard impatiently. "I have explained the
reasons to you."</p>

<p>"You intend to negotiate for a settlement with Mr. Carson and
his lawyers?"</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>"That may result in the loss of a large sum of money to the
company," warned the investigator.</p>

<p>"Publicity would perhaps result in a greater loss." Orchard
was palpably irritated.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right." Rugh changed his tactics. "I may have
a copy of this letter, Mr. Orchard?"</p>

<p>"Certainly." The managing director touched a bell. "Not much
good to you, is it?"</p>

<p>"One never knows." Rugh laughed slightly. "I find that
re-reading a document after reflection often brings new facts to
light. By the way, please ask your copyist to make a complete
copy. Heading and all that. Also mistakes in the letter. I see
there are quite a few."</p>

<p>Orchard stared in astonishment, but passed the instructions on
to the typist answering the bell.</p>

<p>"You would like me to test the genuineness of this claimant?"
suggested Rugh, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Is it necessary?" Orchard moved uneasily in his seat. "Of
course he will have to prove his identity, but that will be a
matter for his lawyers."</p>

<p>"At the same time it's up to the company to take the fullest
precautions," Rugh urged.</p>

<p>"Of course. Of course," Orchard exclaimed quickly. "I had
forgotten that. The relief of finding this matter is to be
settled after all this time has made me forget that we must move
with every precaution. You will, of course, Mr. Thornton,
continue to act in the interests of the company until the matter
is finalised."</p>

<p>"I expected to," replied the investigator grimly. "You will
give me an introduction to Messrs. Leferve and Saunderson,
stating that I am acting for the company, and requesting them to
supply me with any information I require."</p>

<p>"Dear me," exclaimed the managing director testily. "You
appear to suggest this man may be fraudulent."</p>

<p>"Two hundred thousand pounds is a good prize," commented Rugh.
"There are hundreds of men in Sydney who would go through hell to
get their fingers on such a sum."</p>

<p>"All right." Orchard scribbled a note on his date pad. "I'll
have it sent over to your offices. You've not got on the trail of
the young lady of the photograph. Miss Carson, I mean."</p>

<p>"I had a talk with the young lady the other day," said Rugh
briefly. He was watching Orchard closely.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" The managing director was plainly startled.
"Then&mdash;then this letter from the solicitors did not come as
a surprise to you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it did," laughed Rugh. "The lady informed me her
father had been dead some years."</p>

<p>"Dead?" Wilbur Orchard's face paled. "Are you sure you have
found Miss Carson?"</p>

<p>"I found the lady whose photograph you gave me," replied the
investigator. "Up to the present she has not furnished me with
the information proving her to be the daughter of Colin Carson.
She and her relative are looking through her father's papers. I
believe that you or I will hear from her soon. Now, Mr. Orchard,
what procedure do you suggest to adopt in regard to this claim of
Mr. Carson?"</p>

<p>"The Board will go into the matter, and if the claimant proves
his identity the Board will probably make him an offer in full
settlement of his claim."</p>

<p>"And if he demands the full sum he is entitled to under the
loan deed?"</p>

<p>"He won't do that."</p>

<p>"How can you tell? He is within his rights, unless a decision
of the Courts declares those rights to be extortionate."</p>

<p>"I have told you we do not intend to go into Court over the
matter," exclaimed Wilbur Orchard angrily.</p>

<p>"In the event of the lady of the photograph advancing a claim
as heiress of Colin Carson, deceased, I do not see how you are
going to avoid Court proceedings," said Rugh drily.</p>

<p>"That is a matter the Board will expect to hear from you on.
Really, Mr. Thornton, you have not acted with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As I have not yet placed my report before the Board of
Directors, I suggest you have no right to comment on my actions,
Mr. Orchard," interrupted the investigator coldly. "You have
insinuated I have an interest in the decision between the rival
parties, if the lady puts in a claim, or in establishing the
legitimacy of any claim going before the Board. I ask, therefore,
that the Board in hearing any claim acts in a manner that will
give me a certain liberty of action."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"I suggest your Board shall call before them the claimant or
claimants, and that I shall be permitted to appear before the
Board at the same time and submit any evidence or witnesses I may
have for or against the claimant, or claimants."</p>

<p>"Most irregular," exclaimed Wilbur Orchard. "Why, you are
suggesting the Board sit as a sort of informal Court of
Justice."</p>

<p>"As you are averse to going to the ordinary Courts of justice,
I can see no other course to pursue."</p>

<p>The managing director thought for a few minutes. Then he held
out his hand in dismissal.</p>

<p>"I will place your suggestion before the Board this afternoon,
and advise you of their decision."</p>

<p>"I shall have your support on the Board to my proposal?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the two men met and clashed. The managing
director was the first to turn away.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said slowly. "I am in favour of your proposal and
will ask the Board to agree to it."</p>

<p>Rugh strolled into a café and sat down at the first vacant
table. The attitude taken up by Wilbur Orchard during the late
interview worried him. Why had Wilbur Orchard appeared relieved
at the advent of a claimant for the Carson Loan in the person of
the lender himself? The claimant could have no connection with
Sam Brene, and the actions of the director in the past had given
Rugh cause to believe there was some understanding between
Orchard and the big grafter.</p>

<p>To Orchard, Rugh had deliberately suggested that Myrtle
Seaton, the original of the photograph sent to the managing
director, would put in a claim for the fortune. That suggestion
had alarmed the director. Yet if, as Rugh suspected, the Town
Hall boss and Wilbur Orchard had a secret understanding, why
should the suggestion be disturbing?</p>

<p>Rugh had no doubt but that Wilbur Orchard was attempting to
use him as a blind. By some means the Carson Loan money was to be
obtained by a gang of crooks, and if the scheme miscarried the
managing director was determined he should "carry the bag." Rugh
smiled grimly. He knew enough to easily slip from under, and
possibly within the coming week he would be in a position to pull
their house of cards about the plotters' ears.</p>

<p>Sam Brene must be forced to move. In some manner he must be
forced out into the open, and in opposition to the claims of the
man posing as Colin Carson.</p>

<p>With two claimants it would he impossible for Wilbur Orchard
to force the matter to a Board decision. It would have to be
submitted to the decision of the Courts of Law.</p>

<p>One point troubled Rugh. His scheme would involve Myrtle
Seaton. She was too fresh and sweet a girl to be involved in her
uncle's roguery. Perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>Anyhow the game was set. Pity that Harry Sutherland was out of
it. Still, there was a week, and much might happen in that time.
Rugh laughed softly as he walked up Pitt Street to his
offices.</p>

<p>"Anyone called, Teddy?" he asked, as he crossed the outer
office.</p>

<p>"Telephone message on your desk," answered the lad. "Man
spoke. Just gave an address, but wouldn't give his name. Said you
would understand, Mr. Thornton."</p>

<p>On the blotting pad lay a slip of paper. "14 Mason Street,
Redfern. Eight to-night."</p>

<p>Shorty Matt had got in touch with the Tiger Lily and had
forwarded the address required. Rugh wondered what sort of a home
he would find the Mystery Girl lived in. She had intrigued him.
What mystery could hold that girl in the sordid surroundings of
Surry Hills?</p>

<p>"Mr. Rugh Thornton within?" A languid voice asked the question
in the outer office.</p>

<p>Rugh swung round and sprang to the connecting door. A long,
lean, languid looking young man, immaculately dressed, and
wearing a monocle in his left eye, stood apparently admiring
Teddy.</p>

<p>"Bill Short," shouted Rugh. "What's brought you here?"</p>

<p>"My dear-r old chappie. William, not Bill. It's frightfully
common. Ah, yes. The chief, Mr. Lorimer Osmond, told me to report
to you, don't y' know? Say, Rugh, old sport. What have you done to the 'Chink'? He's raving&mdash;simply raving, I assure you, my
dear-r fellow. Drink your blood, and all that, don't y' know?"</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="first">"OSMOND told you to report to me?" repeated
Rugh. "Are you coming with us to-night?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I am." Bill Short sank gracefully into a chair, and
arranged, with great care, the knees of his trousers. "The chief
said it was likely to be an all-night job. Beastly nuisance, old
bean. Puts a man off his feed, don't y 'know."</p>

<p>"Probably a rough house as well," warned Rugh. "Do you know we
are going to raid one of the worst houses in Surry Hills?"</p>

<p>"Dear me. How beastly jolly. Do you know, my dear boy? I often
wonder how people manage to live in such places. And we are to
participate in a raid? You don't say so."</p>

<p>Rugh looked at the journalist. For the moment he thought
Osmond had played one of his rare jokes in sending Bill Stone to
accompany the police on the night of the raid.</p>

<p>Yet the investigator was not ill-content. Short was one of the
best journalists in Sydney, writing terse, vivid copy, with no
trace of his peculiar mannerisms. He had no experience of
criminal investigation, but that, in Rugh's eyes, was an
advantage. He had told Osmond to send a journalist to accompany
them, from a sentimental regard for his old newspaper. He would
have liked to have had Harry with him, but that was impossible.
Finally, the grotesque side of the situation appealed to him.
Bill Short, with his monocle, would cause a sensation, not only
in Surry Hills, but among the raiding police. There was a promise
of good sport, and Rugh had reason to believe Bill Stone was not
wanting in physical pluck.</p>

<p>For half an hour the two men sat in Rugh's office, the
investigator carefully coaching the journalist in the events
leading up to the raid. Short showed a keen grasp of the
essential points, so much so that Rugh was confident the
<i>Star's</i> report of the raid would do justice to the
reputation of the newspaper.</p>

<p>"Time of raid, midnight," commented Bill Stone. "Dear old
chappie, are we to sit round here, consumed by the pangs of
hunger? I assure you my constitution won't stand it. True, old
dear-r. usually dine at seven."</p>

<p>"You'll dine at six to-night," laughed Rugh. "Richards will be
here any minute, and then&mdash;Ah! here he is. Come on in,
Inspector."</p>

<p>Richards came quickly into the room, to halt on the threshold
when under the fire of Bill Stone's monocle.</p>

<p>"Warrington and Pliess have gone 'under smoke,'" announced the
Inspector. "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could not continue; Bill Stone fascinated him.</p>

<p>"Inspector Richards, William Stone," introduced Rugh, gravely.
He was watching the effect the journalist had on the officer.
"Mr. Stone will represent the <i>Star</i> with us to-night. You
can trust him."</p>

<p>Bill Stone uncurled his long length from the chair, and held
out a languid, highly manicured hand to Richards.</p>

<p>"Charmed to meet you, Inspector," he purred, screwing the
monocle more firmly in his eye. "Most honoured, I'm sure, at your
kind invitation to join your little parti-e."</p>

<p>The Inspector gasped. Rugh was resisting a strong inclination
to laugh. He could never decide whether or not Bill Stone
accentuated his mannerism, on purpose, before strangers.</p>

<p>"Now that we are assembled," continued Bill graciously, "may I
suggest&mdash;er&mdash;that the cravings of the er&mdash;inner
man, be, in some way, assuaged. I assure you, my dear old
playmates, that&mdash;er&mdash;until I am in some way fortified,
I shall&mdash;er&mdash;fail to contribute adequately to
the&mdash;er&mdash;evening's amusement."</p>

<p>"Now I come to think of it, I have only had one small cup of
coffee since breakfast," remarked Rugh.</p>

<p>"Dea-r old bean!" Bill looked much distressed. "You must be
literally starving. 'Pon my soul I don't know how you do it."</p>

<p>He led the way from the room. Richards laid a detaining hand
on Rugh's arm.</p>

<p>"What's he in this for?" he asked in a fierce whisper. "Do you
realise there is likely to be a rough-house to-night?"</p>

<p>"Bill will enjoy himself, then." Rugh laughed at the
Inspector's face. "Why, Richards, he'll just be in his element.
He won all the regimental boxing tournaments for his weight
during the war, besides a barrel of medals. Annexed everything
there was, barring the V.C., and he should have got that."</p>

<p>"What? Him?" The Inspector stared.</p>

<p>"Don't judge by exteriors, Richards," warned the investigator.
"There's no one I'd rather have at my back than Bill Stone.
He's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dea-r old chappies," came the plaintive voice from the outer
office. "I'm really starving."</p>

<p>In spite of his mannerisms, Bill Stone proved an interesting
companion. The covert antagonism of the Inspector wore off, and
before the meal was ended an unspoken, but firm, comradeship had
sprung up between the burly police officer and the dude
journalist.</p>

<p>Leaving the restaurant, Bill suggested they spend the waiting
hours at a show. Richards was willing, and the proposal suited
Rugh. He pleaded work and an appointment, and, with secret
amusement, watched the two new friends turn into Fuller's.</p>

<p>It was a quarter past seven. The Tiger Lily expected him at
eight o'clock. He was due back at his offices at eleven to meet
the Inspector and Stone. He strolled into Elizabeth Street and
boarded a Redfern tram.</p>

<p>Mason Street, Redfern, is a dingy dirty-looking street, lying
back from the Green. Number fourteen is a low-built, rather
frowsy house of two stories. On either side of it are high
factories accentuating the smallness of the house. At the back
stands another factory, the three high buildings seeming to stand
guard over the little cottage.</p>

<p>A light was burning in a room of the upper storey. There was
no other light visible. Rugh walked up to the door and knocked.
There was no response for some minutes. Rugh stood and waited.
Presently the door opened slightly, and a low voice asked who was
there. Rugh gave his name. The door was shut immediately. Another
minute's wait and Rugh heard the tap of high-heeled shoes on the
stairs. The door swung open, and a well-remembered voice bade him
enter. The tiny hall was in darkness. Rugh groped forward. A low
laugh came from in front of him, and his hand was caught in a
soft, firm grip.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid?" The question was accompanied by a little
ripple of laughter. "Lights are not always safe in this quarter
of the city."</p>

<p>Rugh did not reply. The light touch led him up the stairs and
to a door. There the girl hesitated a moment. Then the door was
flung open.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the den of the Tiger Lily."</p>

<p>The sudden light, the quick movements of the girl, dazed Rugh.
A moment before she was standing by his side in complete
darkness. Now she stood in the centre of the room holding out her
hands to him, in welcome.</p>

<p>It was not the Tiger Lily that stood before him, but a girl
out of his own world. A woman of softness and refinement, dressed
in a simple frock of black, setting off her marvellous regal
beauty.</p>

<p>It was a simply furnished room he stood in. A room that seemed
to be part of the girl owning it. There was a restfulness about
the place that reflected the character of the girl as she now
appeared. He could not picture the Tiger Lily in it.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Thornton?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon." Rugh, advanced quickly, and caught her
hands. "I did not expect&mdash;that is to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did not expect the Tiger Lily to have a home." She laid
peculiar emphasis on the last word.</p>

<p>"That name."</p>

<p>"You do not like it. Then, for to-night, it shall
be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lily and Rugh. You remember what you said in my office."</p>

<p>"The Tiger Lily spoke there." She mocked him, deliciously.
"But it shall be as you say. Come, sit here, and smoke, Rugh. I
like to see a man smoking. It looks homey."</p>

<p>Rugh produced his cigarette case, and half held it out. The
girl made a little grimace.</p>

<p>"The Tiger Lily smokes," she confessed.</p>

<p>"And Lily Dalton?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes." She took a cigarette and bent forward for Rugh to
light it.</p>

<p>"Why did you ask to see me?" she asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you." At his office Rugh could have given a
dozen reasons for this call on Lily Dalton. In her presence the
simple "I wanted to" appeared all sufficient.</p>

<p>"To know what I have discovered?"</p>

<p>"No." He jerked out the answer, almost savagely. "I just
wanted to see you&mdash;Lily."</p>

<p>"You are foolish&mdash;Rugh." The girl leaned back in her
chair and drew slowly at her cigarette. "Have you forgotten?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That I have been in prison."</p>

<p>"There was a mistake. You can explain it."</p>

<p>"Can I?" Then after a moment in an almost imperceptible
whisper: "If I but could!"</p>

<p>Rugh was silent. He could sit there always feasting his eyes
on the girl's dusky loveliness.</p>

<p>"Listen, Rugh." The girl spoke after some minutes' silence. "I
must tell you what I have discovered before my sister comes."</p>

<p>"Your sister?"</p>

<p>"My adopted sister. You will like her. She is far different
from the Tiger Lily. You did not expect the Tiger Lily to have a
home."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that will be a reason for my not liking her," said
Rugh lightly, but with a deeper meaning in his voice.</p>

<p>"Rugh, you are paying compliments. Now Listen, Ruth Collins
did not arrive at Maudie Wheelson's house on the Sunday
morning."</p>

<p>"Then those screams were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believe they were hers." Lily covered her face with her
hands.</p>

<p>"Lily." Rugh spoke slowly. "Do you think the Wheelsons had
anything to do with the murder?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Sometimes I think they know who did it. I think
they can give evidence that would convict the murderers."</p>

<p>"The police will raid the house in Coomber Street to-night,"
said Rugh under his breath.</p>

<p>"Is that why you have come to me?"</p>

<p>"If Richards had asked that question in my office an hour ago
I should have said 'Yes.' Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You told Richards you were coining here? Have you discussed
me with that police officer?" There was reproach in the girl's
voice. "You know you have only to ask him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know." Rugh broke in on her sentence with a gesture that
was a denial. "I have not spoken to him of you. When you tell
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When I tell you," she repeated. "You think I will tell you
one day?"</p>

<p>"I know you will."</p>

<p>"And until that day you are content to wait?"</p>

<p>Rugh was about to reply when a step sounded outside the door.
Lily held up her finger in warning. She rose from her chair and
crossed the room as a tall, fair-haired girl entered.</p>

<p>"Lizzie, dear. Let me present Mr. Rugh Thornton. Rugh, my
adopted sister, Miss Lizzie&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl broke off with a smile of mischief lighting her
face.</p>

<p>"No," she laughed. "Lizzie, you shall be a Mystery Girl also.
To-night we three are but Lizzie, Rugh and Lily."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="first">"LIZZIE and I want to know the true story of the
Carson Loan case," said Lily abruptly.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour the three had gathered around the fire in
gay talk. Rugh was interested. The girls talked well, and the
time had passed rapidly.</p>

<p>"The Carson Case!" Rugh looked amazed. "What do you know of
the Carson Loan case? I have never spoken to you of it."</p>

<p>"No." Lily's face dimpled with laughter. "I have had a feeling
you have only been using me. You never mentioned the case you
were really working on."</p>

<p>"But very few people know of the matter," said Rugh. "And
every one connected with it is pledged to secrecy. I cannot
understand how you obtained your information."</p>

<p>"Lily has marvellous sources of information," remarked the
fair girl. "She sometimes puzzles me."</p>

<p>"The Tiger Lily," murmured the Mystery Girl, laughing.</p>

<p>"I hate that," exclaimed Lizzie. "Why don't you give it up? We
could go away&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lily put her finger to her lips with an expressive
gesture.</p>

<p>"I have my mission to accomplish," she said softly. "Perhaps,
one day. Now, Rugh, stop trying to guess how the Tiger Lily gets
her knowledge and tell us the inner history of the Carson Loan
and its claimants."</p>

<p>Rugh thought for a moment. Much of the success he had had in
tracking down the Little Bay murderers had been due to the almost
uncanny knowledge of this girl. It was possible she could fathom
the mystery that surrounded the Carson case, a mystery he could
only guess at. More, there was an irresistible impulse to share
his secrets and hopes with her. Step by step he went over the
story of the Carson Loan, first recounting the story as told to
him by Wilbur Orchard. The girls listened in silence until he
finished.</p>

<p>"What have you done?" asked Lily briefly.</p>

<p>"Very little," Rugh confessed. Detailing the primary steps he
had taken he went on to recount the various interviews with
Wilbur Orchard, and finished with the story of the photograph of
Myrtle Seaton, and the interview with Sam Brene and his niece at
the Hotel Splendide roof-garden.</p>

<p>"Sam Brene." Lily gave a slight shudder at the mention of the
big grafter. "If he is interested in the matter you can be sure
the plot to defraud the company is deep and well planned."</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" asked Rugh curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes. I know him." Lily's lips closed ominously, and a
peculiar light came into her eyes. "I know no good of him. One
day I may tell you of a crime he committed, a crime so dastardly
I wonder an offended God allows him to sully His beautiful
earth."</p>

<p>"You will ask my help?" almost whispered Rugh.</p>

<p>The mystery girl turned and looked at him for a long minute, a
minute in which he seemed to gaze into the depths of her soul.
Then the dusky colour rose to her cheeks and stained the
whiteness of her neck.</p>

<p>"Yes." She turned and gazed into the fire. "I will ask your
help."</p>

<p>A brief silence, and she turned to Rugh, smiling.</p>

<p>"I love the fireside," she said, inconsequently. "We
Australians lose a lot by not cultivating the fireside habit. Why
is it? Because our climate is too hot? No, for many of our Sydney
days are bitterly cold. Because we burn wood and not coal? It
cannot be that, for in Europe the wood fire is looked upon as a
luxury. How is Mr. Sutherland, Rugh?"</p>

<p>"You know of his accident?"</p>

<p>The girls laughed gaily.</p>

<p>"I like Harry Sutherland," declared the Mystery Girl. "Do you
think he would mind if I went to see him at the hospital? I would
take Lizzie with me."</p>

<p>"He will be delighted, I am sure," answered Rugh. "I will tell
him when I call at the hospital to-morrow."</p>

<p>"No, don't," Lily laughed lowly. "I want to see him take off
those thick glasses and polish them in that queer manner he has,
when he sees the Tiger Lily as a visitor to his bedside."</p>

<p>Rugh rose to take his leave. It was just 10 o'clock and he had
to meet the Inspector and Bill Stone within the hour.</p>

<p>"Come again, and soon," said Lizzie, as she frankly offered
her hand. "Lily and I will be delighted to see you."</p>

<p>"There is a direct invitation from your hostess," laughed the
Mystery Girl. Then noticing Rugh's questioning look. "Yes. This
is Lizzie's home. I am but a dependent."</p>

<p>"It is your home," protested the fair girl, encircling Lily's
waist with her arm. "You know it hurts me when you talk like
that."</p>

<p>Lily kissed her apologetically.</p>

<p>"I am a beast," she exclaimed. "It was the Tiger Lily
speaking, Lizzie. Sometimes I think I am turning into a feminine
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. My two identities are beginning to
overlap."</p>

<p>Lily preceded Rugh to the door and down the stairs. At the
street door she detained him a moment.</p>

<p>He could feel her sweet presence beside him, although he could
not see her.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Rugh," she whispered. "Leo and Ginger know you
are on their track. They almost got Harry, and swear they will
get you."</p>

<p>A quick pressure of the hand. The door opened and he was
standing on the pavement looking up at the light burning in the
upper room.</p>

<p>A mystery girl. Rugh stood under thee light standard and lit a
cigarette, his thoughts travelling back to the small, drab house
and the girls who lived there. He could no longer disguise the
truth from himself. He loved the Tiger Lily, the Mystery girl of
Slumland. The girl who had sinned and had bitterly paid for her
sin with the shame of prison. No. He could not believe that. She
had suffered falsely. There was no guile in those blue eyes that
met his so fearlessly. She had been sinned against. He would take
a solemn oath on that.</p>

<p>She had spoken of a mission, and had promised one day to claim
his aid. Rugh clenched his teeth. He would not fail her. By hook
or crook he would unearth the truth, and free her from the stigma
of prison. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>She had spoken of Sam Brene with almost fear and loathing. Had
the foul blight of the big grafter fallen on her young life? She
had called him foul and debased. Brene was that, and more. Too
long had he been allowed to graft upon the city of Sydney. Rugh
vowed he would root the big boss out. He had a triple grudge
against him&mdash;for Lily, Harry and himself.</p>

<p>"Taxi, sir?" A car drew up beside the pavement. Rugh looked
up. He had wandered down to Elizabeth Street. He pulled out his
watch. It was twenty minutes to eleven.</p>

<p>"Yes, and hurry." Rugh got into the taxi, after giving his
office address. Sitting back in the corner he thought of the work
before him that night. Would he obtain the information he
required? Ruth Collins had lived at Coomber Street. It was
possible she had left something behind her that would give a clue
to the murderers. The raid would be a shot in the dark. It was a
chance, a long chance, but they wanted but little to fix the
murder on to the men concerned.</p>

<p>The car swerved sharply and then ran down a hill. Rugh sat
forward and looked out of the window. This was not Pitt Street,
nor any of the surrounding streets. Again the car swerved, taking
the corner at high speed. They were making down Woolloomooloo.
The investigator leaned forward and called to the driver. The man
shouted something back about "blocked." Rugh rose to his feet and
tried to shift the glass slide between him and the driver. It
would not budge. The car ran past a street lamp. For a brief
second the rays of light illuminated the driver. He was
red-haired.</p>

<p>The speed increased. Rugh slipped his hand outside the door
and softly turned the handle. The door gave. It was a risky jump,
but he had no intention of letting Ginger Pleiss take him, a
prisoner, to the headquarters of his gang. Stepping out on the
running board, Rugh shut the door and crouched down. For a moment
he had an idea of attacking the driver, but that would have meant
delay, and possibly the postponement of the plans for the night's
raid. Already he was late for his appointment. Ginger Pleiss
could wait. After to-night the whole of the police of the
continent would be on the look-out for him. Watching a favourable
opportunity, Rugh jumped. He struck the ground heavily, rolling
over and bringing up in the gutter.</p>

<p>For a moment he sat dazed, feeling as if every bone in his
body was broken. He could see the car mounting the hill towards
Darlinghurst, the driver quite unconscious he had lost his
prisoner-passenger.</p>

<p>It was a dusty, unkempt man who walked with a slight limp to
where Inspector Richards and Bill Stone waited outside Marchmont
Buildings.</p>

<p>"Sorry I'm late, Richards."</p>

<p>The two men turned, and stared in open mouthed astonishment.
It was quite a minute before they recognised in the man before
them the usually fastidiously attired investigator.</p>

<p>"My dear-r chappie!" Bill Stone fixed his monocle more
securely.</p>

<p>"I'll be damned!" exclaimed the police officer.</p>

<p>"Prizes for both," grinned Rugh. "Come up to my offices a
moment. I have a change there."</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Richards, when the three men were in
Rugh's offices, and the investigator was making a quick
change.</p>

<p>"A little argument with friend Ginger Pleiss," laughed Rugh.
"He wanted to take me for a joy-ride out Darlinghurst way, to
meet some friends of his. I preferred to keep my appointment with
you."</p>

<p>In a few vivid sentences Rugh described the adventure of the
taxi-car.</p>

<p>"You're sure you recognised Pleiss?" asked Richards.</p>

<p>"Answered to his description in all points," replied Rugh
cautiously. "Besides, who else would want me so badly?"</p>

<p>"Did you get the car's number?"</p>

<p>"No chance. The roads are too hard. I'll swear to the driver
if you can face me with him. Also, I left a few souvenirs in the
shape of my cards distributed about the taxi. Slipped in the
pockets, and under and behind the seats. That might help."</p>

<p>"Good," snapped Richards. He strode to the desk and put
through a call to headquarters. "Get every red-headed taxi-driver
and search cars. If you find any card of Mr. Thornton's hidden in
car arrest driver and advise me. Also have all garages
searched."</p>

<p>Rugh finished dressing while the Inspector was engaged at the
telephone.</p>

<p>"Ready now," announced Rugh, picking up his hat. "Good thing I
keep a change here. Bill would have had a fit if he had had to
stroll around Surry Hills with me as I parted from friend
Pleiss."</p>

<p>"My dear-r old bean," expostulated Bill mildly.</p>

<p>"William, if you please! Abbreviations are so belittling."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p class="first">AT the Buckingham Street junction with Elizabeth
Street, Inspector Richards took charge of the evening's
proceedings. Dismissing the taxi with a strict injunction to get
out of the neighbourhood, he led the way up Buckingham Street
towards Coomber Street. They had not proceeded far when two men
who had been loitering outside the Southern Cross Hotel caught up
to them, and exchanged a few words with the Inspector. They
passed ahead but at the corner of Coomber Street again
waited.</p>

<p>Coomber Street is dark and narrow. It runs from Buckingham
Street towards Crown Street. At one time it was bordered on both
sides by rows of small cottages. Many of these, in recent years
have been pulled down, to be replaced by factories. The few
cottages that have escaped the house wreckers' hands have fallen
on evil days. At one time occupied by decent working men, they
have become the lairs of bludgers and prostitutes. Few of them
are occupied by one family, the greater majority being rented by
some woman letting out rooms to women of questionable
reputation.</p>

<p>Number 13 Coomber Street differed only from its neighbours in
being a little more dirty and dilapidated. It was a two storey
house, originally one of a terrace row. Only three of the houses
remained, and a large estate agent's board attached to the
balcony of the centre house, stated that houses and middle land
were for sale. Number 13 was the middle house of the three.
Opposite the three houses is a narrow passage-way. The north side
of this passage-way is occupied by the high blank wall of a paint
factory.</p>

<p>Turning into Coomber Street the Inspector kept to the west
side of the street, and walked swiftly on until he came to the
passage-way. Immediately he reached the mouth of the passage, two
men materialised out of the darkness.</p>

<p>"All set, Tom?" he asked one of the men. "Good Boys in their
places? Right. Now we're off."</p>

<p>He strode across the road and up to the door of No. 13. There
he knocked loudly.</p>

<p>There was no response. Rugh and Stone waited on the pavement
outside, and a couple of men lounged up, as if casual
passers-by.</p>

<p>Richards thundered at the door. A glimmer of light showed in
one of the upper windows. A heavy step was heard descending the
uncarpeted stairs, and someone approached the front door.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" asked a man's thick voice.</p>

<p>"Police. Open this door. Hurry up, you can't get away with
it."</p>

<p>Upstairs a woman shrieked. A light came in the window of the
room beside the street door. After a minute the window opened and
a man put through his head.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Open this door or I'll have it forced." Richards attacked the
knocker again. "No nonsense. The house is surrounded."</p>

<p>The man withdrew his head, and closed the window. There was
the sound of some altercation in the passage, and then the door
was opened and a man, in shirt and trousers, stood in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"What's the game?" he demanded. "Can't a man get a night's
sleep without being aroused by you thick-heads?"</p>

<p>"What's your name?" demanded Richards pushing into the
passage, followed by the suddenly active men who had been
standing beside Rugh and Stone.</p>

<p>"Bill Jones. You've got nothing on me." The man backed to the
door of the room on the right.</p>

<p>"Where's Harry Wheelson," demanded the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Up there." The man jerked his finger towards the stairs.</p>

<p>"Fetch him." Richards spoke to the men behind him. Then he
gave a low whistle. Of a sudden the passage was full of
plain-clothes police. Richards moved towards the man and pushed him to one side.</p>

<p>"Here," expostulated the man. "You can't go in there. There's
a lady in bed."</p>

<p>"Can't I? She won't object to me." The Inspector put his head
in at the door. "Hullo, Polly. Get up and dress quick. I'll give
you two minutes."</p>

<p>A man came quickly down the stairs and made for the front
door. He was fully dressed.</p>

<p>"What's your name," demanded Richards, barring the way.</p>

<p>"Tom Smith." The man tried to push through to the door.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Richards laid a none too gentle hand on
the man's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Where do you think? Work. I'm on night shift."</p>

<p>"You're a liar. Your name's Harry Wheelson. Now, none of that.
Where's Maudie?"</p>

<p>"Find out."</p>

<p>The Inspector took the man by the scruff of the neck and threw
him towards the door of the room on the right. It burst open and
the man fell in.</p>

<p>"Bring them all down," called the Inspector to the men
upstairs, "This room'll do."</p>

<p>A few minutes later a procession of half-a-dozen partly
dressed men and women came slowly down stairs and filed into the
front room. Half-a-dozen police strolled in and looked over the
capture.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Polly," said the sergeant in charge, to the woman who
occupied the room. "You haven't paid us a visit for a long time.
What about it now?"</p>

<p>"Go t' ell." The woman sat on the edge of the bed, lazily
pulling on her stockings. "What d'yer want me for?"</p>

<p>"Little matter of false pretences, dearie," chuckled the
Sergeant. "Why, here's Bully Bitson, an Fanny. I've been longing
for a quiet chat with you two. An' Soapy Miller. Say, Soapy,
there's a gentleman at Goulburn says you forgot to say 'good-bye'
when you left in a hurry. He's longing to see you again. Seems to
me this 'ere joint's a regular smoke-'ouse."</p>

<p>"Made a haul, Sergeant?" grinned the Inspector,</p>

<p>"Should say I 'ave. Don't know what you're after but you've
done me a good turn. Now, Bill get the waggon here, right smart.
We'll take this company for a joy-ride."</p>

<p>The Sergeant marshalled his little capture.</p>

<p>"That clears the house for you, sir," he remarked to the
inspector. "Say, what about Harry Wheelson an' is lady-love?"</p>

<p>"Got anything on them?"</p>

<p>"No." The Sergeant spoke with real regret.</p>

<p>"Put 'em in, too," remarked Richards, grinning. "Won't do them
any harm."</p>

<p>"You can't," protested Maudie, shrilly. "You ain't got nothin'
on us."</p>

<p>"Can't I?" The Inspector's lips drew back in almost a snarl.
"I'm going to hold you and your boy as accessories to the Little
Bay murder. Get a move on, there."</p>

<p>Outside the house a small crowd had collected, in spite of the
lateness of the hour. The arrival of the police waggon was
received with hoots and groans, but there was no attempt at a
rescue. Surry Hills realised the police were in force on this
occasion.</p>

<p>"Come boys," said the Inspector to Rugh and Bill, as the
waggon drove quickly away. "We have the place to ourselves. Let's
get to work."</p>

<p>Detailing two men to accompany them, and rapidly explaining
the objects of the search, the Inspector led the way upstairs.
The rooms were taken one by one, and every piece of paper, every
letter, however unimportant, was placed in a bag to be carried to
headquarters for examination. Bill Stone was much interested. It
was the first time he had had an opportunity of seeing the police
at work, and he stuck to the Inspector's side like a burr.</p>

<p>The investigator wandered over the house, listlessly. The work
of the search was in the hands of men skilled in the job, and his
help, even if accepted would be but a hindrance. Beyond that, he
wanted to keep himself from the detail work. Some instinct told
him something would happen to justify the raid, and that it would
not be discovered among the debris in the house. In an upstairs
room Rugh sat down on a ricketty chair. He was tired. The
searchers had but a few minutes before left the room, taking with
them a few unimportant articles and papers. They were now in the
next room, and he could hear Bill's languid voice, alternating
with the Inspector's deeper bass. A candle flickered on the
wash-stand by the window. Outside the sky was lightening to a new
dawn. It was some hours since the Inspector's knock had aroused
the inmates of the house.</p>

<p>The ragged curtain flapped inwards, and swept across the flame
of the candle. Rugh rose from his chair and crossed the room. A
fire would complicate matters. He moved the candle on to the
dilapidated dressing table. The candle wobbled badly in its
socket, and Rugh bent forward to secure it.</p>

<p>There was some writing on the wall over the dressing table. He
moved the candle nearer, and bent down.</p>

<p>"Ruth Collins, 1924, 2, 6."</p>

<p>The murdered woman had occupied this room. But why had she
written her name over the dressing table? It was not a signature,
for the words and figures were written in minute capitals. Ruth
Collins had lived in this house for a considerable time. She had
left it to live with the man Leo Warrington at Ultimo. Yet, at
frequent intervals she had returned to this house, possibly to
this room. Had she left anything hidden here? Was the writing on
the wall a clue to the hiding place of something the dead woman
had treasured? Rugh bent closer to examine the writing, but the
light was bad.</p>

<p>Leaving the room be sought the Inspector to advise him of the
discovery. Richards was a little depressed at the fruitlessness
of the search. He was inclined to "pooh-pooh" the investigator's
theory that the writing onthe wall was a clue to some
hiding-place. However, he accompanied Rugh back to the room.</p>

<p>"Humph! Ruth Collins, all right. Got the date after it. The
second of June, 1924. What did she want to write it there
for?"</p>

<p>"I'm wondering," said Rugh. "Are you certain it is a date,
Richards?"</p>

<p>"What else can it be? There you are, 1924. Then the '2' means
the second day of the month, and the '6' stands for June. June 2,
1924."</p>

<p>"Why write it that way?"</p>

<p>The Inspector stared at the writing for some minutes.</p>

<p>"Looks like she wrote the year first, and then, for some cause
added the day and month."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," meditated Rugh. "Your explanation would be
all right if the writing was a signature. But it isn't. The
writing is in minute capitals. Looks more like a remembrance
note."</p>

<p>"Out after hidden treasure?" scoffed the Inspector. "No,
there's nothing in it."</p>

<p>"Say, my dea'r old friends," Bill Stone sauntered into the
room. "All this is most deucedly interesting, what? But I'm
getting most awfully sleepy. What about escorting the jolly old
milk home? What have you there, Rugh, dear-r boy?"</p>

<p>Rugh pointed to the writing on the wall.</p>

<p>"Ruth Collins, 1924, 2, 6," read the journalist.</p>

<p>"Why, that's the name of the poor dear-r deceased."</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of those numbers after the name?" asked
the investigator, quietly.</p>

<p>The Inspector was about to speak when Rugh quieted him with an
imperative gesture. Bill Stone fixed his monocle firmly and
focussed it on the writing. After a few minutes he stood up and
looked round the room.</p>

<p>"Deuced interesting," he murmured. "Bett-ar than the jolly old
crossword puzzles. Have you your torch, Inspector? Why the devil
don't these landlords fix up their jolly old places with electric
light, and all that. Must have light, dear-r old fellows."</p>

<p>The journalist took the torch the Inspector handed him and
began to search the walls. "What are you doing," asked the
Inspector, sarcastically. "Looking for bugs. There's plenty of
them."</p>

<p>The journalist beamed at his companions over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hidden treasure, old dear-r. Awfully keen on crossword
puzzles, and all that. Ah, thought so." The last two words were
snapped out in an altogether different tone. The two men crowded
up behind the journalist. He was pointing to a series of figures
on the wall.</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" asked Richards, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Don't you see, old bean. The figures were only a guide. Look
at the line of the pattern of the wall paper. I went along two
rows of patterns up, and six patterns from the wall I found this.
Same handwriting, y' know. Deuced clever, what?"</p>

<p>In the same minute characters as the previous writing Ruth
Collins had written:</p>

<p>"Yard, 2, 1."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="first">"YARD, 2, 1," repeated Inspector Richards,
perplexedly. "That's not going to help us much."</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" Rugh laughed. "Bill has struck the right scent.
Atta, boy!"</p>

<p>Bill Stone was half-way down the stairs. All his habitual
foppishness had vanished. He was following a definite scent.</p>

<p>The first beams of morning light were turning the eastern sky
to a light blue when the three men went out into the untidy yard
at the back of 13 Coomber Street. Bill led the way direct to the
little gate leading out into the passage at the rear. He flashed
the torch on the wood, carefully scanning it for writings.</p>

<p>"What are you looking for?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"My dear-r old chappie." Bill turned from the door. "I am
looking for a little ray of sunshine."</p>

<p>"You won't find it in Surry Hills, then," retorted Richards.
"Suppose you mean by that you are looking for some sign as to
where Ruth Collins hid the goods."</p>

<p>"The good old little grey cells work." Bill waved an airy
hand. "I should dislike extremely to ask your men to pull up all
the stones in this yard. Eh, what?"</p>

<p>Bill strode up and down the yard for some minutes, muttering
broken phrases to himself. At last he went over and examined the
house door. Disappointed again, he stood scanning the dirty yard.
A wooden bench stood opposite the house door, holding a couple of
dilapidated wash-tubs and a pile of miscellaneous household
utilities. A small pile of firewood was littered against the side
of the lavatory, and by the rear gate stood a broken dustbin.</p>

<p>"The first clue worked out all right," argued the journalist.
"This'll work out right too, if I can get the right hang of
it."</p>

<p>Fixing his monocle, Bill carefully examined the six corners of
the yard, without result. Finally, he went over and stood before
the dustbin. At last, he pulled it out of the corner and turned
to the Inspector.</p>

<p>"I want a jolly old crowbar, or something like it," Bill said
crisply. "We're in for a deuce of a job, old bean."</p>

<p>Richards called one of his men, and after a few minutes the
constable returned with a piece of pointed iron.</p>

<p>"All I can find, sir," he reported.</p>

<p>Bill took the iron and looked at it, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"May do," he decided, testing it against the wall. "What did
the dear girl write? 'Yard 1, 2.'"</p>

<p>Turning to the brick wall, he tapped the second brick on the
first row up. Then he tried the first brick on the second row.
Both were solidly fixed in their places.</p>

<p>"Try down," advised the Inspector, now much interested.</p>

<p>Again there was no result. Producing a dainty pearl-handled
pocket-knife, Bill dropped on his knees and poked at the yard
stones.</p>

<p>"Got it," he exclaimed, triumphantly. He jabbed the pointed
iron in a crack. The stone gave, slightly.</p>

<p>Another effort and the stone moved in its bed. The Inspector
knelt beside Bill Stone and attempted to lever it up with his
fingers, but it was too firmly fixed. Bill jabbed with the iron
again, and this time succeeded in getting the stone sufficiently
far up for the Inspector to get a hold of it. A few moments' work
and the stone was lifted from its place.</p>

<p>Rugh flashed the torch into the hole. At the bottom was a
small iron cash box. The Inspector seized it eagerly.</p>

<p>"Victory of jolly old master mind over matter," drawled the
journalist rising to his feet. Then he glanced down at the knees
of his trousers. "Look at them! My dear-r fellows, I can't be seen in the city in these. Why, it would break my dear-r old tailor's heart, don't you know."</p>

<p>"We might find a pair to fit you in Wheelson's wardrobe," said
Rugh, gravely. Bill Stone shuddered.</p>

<p>"I'll rake a taxi fare out of the police estimate," laughed
Richards, patting the box lovingly. "You've certainly earned
it."</p>

<p>In the frowsy kitchen the iron box was forced open. It
contained some papers and a miscellany of trinkets. Poor,
valueless things, the garnerings of the woman's life.</p>

<p>The Inspector carefully decanted the contents of the box on to
the table. At the bottom were two foolscap envelopes. Both were
inscribed in the same minute characters as on the wall in the
upstairs bedroom, to "The Commissioner of Police."</p>

<p>"I shall not open these," remarked the Inspector, after some
consideration. Then, noticing the look of disappointment on
Rugh's face, he continued: "They are addressed to the
Commissioner, and should go to him. I'll take care that you and
Stone are at the examination, Thornton. It's certainly your due.
We shouldn't have found these but for you two fellows."</p>

<p>The Inspector tucked the box under his arm, and led the way to
the upstairs bedroom. There he placed the box on the dressing
table.</p>

<p>"I'm not satisfied," he announced. "I'm going to search this
room again. Will you help me, or shall I call some of my
men?"</p>

<p>For reply, Rugh threw off his coat, and after a rueful look at
the knees of his trousers, Bill followed his example.</p>

<p>The search was a thorough one. Every article of furniture was
pulled from its place, and even the floorboards sounded. There
was no result. Not one sign of the murdered woman was found
excepting the writing on the wall. Reluctantly, the police
officer had to admit he was baffled.</p>

<p>The house was cleared, save for the presence of the uniformed
men who would remain in charge until the agents of the landlord
took over from them. Richards gave the signal to return to
Headquarters.</p>

<p>It was now broad daylight. Picking up the iron box carefully,
Richards led the way downstairs, and ordered one of the
constables to summon a taxi-cab.</p>

<p>Rugh lingered in the bedroom. He was vaguely dissatisfied. In
that house he had hoped to find some clue to the murderers of
Ruth Collins. The Tiger Lily's statement that Ruth Collins had
not come to the house in Coomber Street the night preceding the
finding of her body fitted in well with the story of the screams
told by Mrs. Vaughan, but it completely upset the theory of the
murder formed by the investigator. The facts as they stood went
to show the woman had been murdered in Frozene Lane, her body
then stripped, and taken, by motor car, to Little Bay. Against
this theory could be placed the fact that the clothing found with
the woman's dead body was not complete. Further, the clothing did
not show blood-stains. The fact could only be explained by the
woman having been stripped before her death, or, having been
stripped after the murder, other garments had been substituted
for the blood-stained apparel.</p>

<p>The folding of the clothes was another point against the
Frozene Lane theory. It was unlikely, whatever reason the
murderers had for stripping the woman, they would take the time
to fold the clothes when every moment increased their chance of
detection.</p>

<p>The Tiger Lily must have been misinformed. Ruth Collins had
undoubtedly met her death in this house. She had been killed
while preparing for, or in bed.</p>

<p>The blood-stained night garments had been taken away and
destroyed, and her day clothes taken to Little Bay with her. It
was a theory fitting the known facts of the case, and such a
theory definitely incriminated the Wheelsons. They were in
custody, and Richards could be trusted to get the truth out of
them.</p>

<p>The Inspector called from the floor below. Rugh heard the
taxi-cab draw up before the house.</p>

<p>The investigator switched on the light of the torch he was
holding, and swept the light about the room. The artificial light
was unnecessary, for the growing daylight flooded the room.</p>

<p>Still keeping his finger on the button or the torch, Rugh left
the room. The small landing was dark. Carelessly Rugh let the
light play round. There was something lying in the dark corner
near the door of the room he had left. It had looked like a dirty
rag. The investigator stooped and picked it up. It was a
stocking, a woman's stocking, and almost at the top of the leg
was a broad dull-red slain.</p>

<p>A stocking had been missing from among the articles of
clothing found with the dead woman at Little Bay. The bushman,
Smith, had stated he had found a stocking on the beach at Little
Bay, a stocking that contained a ring of peculiar significance.
Smith had professed to be ignorant that the stocking he produced
to Harry Sutherland, in the investigator's offices, contained a
ring. He had been more than willing for the two men to suppress
the stocking and ring. More, he had been very anxious that the
investigators should dictate his actions regarding his find.</p>

<p>Was the story of the Limping Man a fraud? Rugh smiled
grimly.</p>

<p>"Hey, Thornton! We're waiting for you," the Inspector shouted,
impatiently, up the stairs.</p>

<p>Rugh rolled the stocking into a small compass and placed it in
his hip pocket. The mystery was clearing. With this stocking,
found in the house Ruth Collins had called home, the Inspector
could squeeze the truth from the Wheelsons.</p>

<p>"Coming, Inspector," the investigator replied, and walked down
to the taxi.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<p class="first">A FEW minutes before ten o'clock that morning
Rugh and Stone ascended the steps of the Police Department and
asked for Inspector Richards. They were informed the Inspector
was engaged with the Commissioner but had left word they were to
be sent up to the "Chief's" waiting-room.</p>

<p>A little after the hour had struck, Richards came out of the
Commissioner's office and beckoned to them.</p>

<p>"The Chief is going to open the box and examine the contents,"
he said, somewhat excitedly. "I've just finished a verbal report
to him on the night's operations."</p>

<p>Sir Reginald Brinston was standing by his desk when the
Inspector introduced them into the room. A tall, soldierly man,
with fine, clean-cut features, he looked more of the military man
than the head of the N.S.W. Police Department. He welcomed Rugh
warmly, as an old acquaintance, and thanked him and Stone for the
assistance they had given the police through the inquiry. Then he
motioned them to seats and turned to the box lying on his
table.</p>

<p>"In deference to a promise made by Inspector Richards to you
gentlemen this morning, I have refrained from opening this box
until you were present," Sir Reginald said, speaking direct to
Rugh and Stone. "I understand this box contains two envelopes
addressed to me. If it is at all possible I am willing to allow
you to see the contents, but of course you gentlemen understand
that is a matter on which I must have absolute discretion."</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply the Chief opened the little box
and turned the contents out on the table. The three men leaned
eagerly forward.</p>

<p>On the top of the little pile lay the two long envelopes. Sir
Reginald lifted them and examined the inscriptions. Then he
placed them on one side and turned to the remaining contents.</p>

<p>A few rings, brooches and chains of common manufacture
comprised the majority of the articles. Three things only were of
value. One a ring of pearls and diamonds, Sir Reginald lifted
from the desk and examined closely.</p>

<p>"Rather old fashioned," he observed. "But, of some value. You
appeared to think Ruth Collins was a woman who had seen better
days, Inspector."</p>

<p>"That is the impression of our men who had met her while she
was alive, sir," replied Richards.</p>

<p>"An engagement ring, I should guess." The Commissioner passed
the ring across the table to Rugh. "What do you make of it, Mr.
Thornton?"</p>

<p>"I agree with you, Sir Reginald," replied the investigator. "I
should say&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, and the three men leaned forward. Rugh took a
powerful glass from his waistcoat pocket and focussed it on the
inside of the ring.</p>

<p>"There is engraving here," he said slowly. "Will you look, Sir
Reginald?"</p>

<p>The Chief took the ring and glass the investigator held out to
him. After some moments he strode across to the window to obtain
a better light.</p>

<p>"There certainly is an engraving inside this ring," he said at
length. "Did you decipher it, Mr. Thornton?"</p>

<p>"I would like your interpretation first, Sir Reginald."</p>

<p>"The best I can make is 'C.C. to R.C.'," the Chief replied
after a further pause.</p>

<p>"That is my reading," said Rugh gravely.</p>

<p>"That does not assist us in the detection of the woman's
murderer," Sir Reginald looked at Rugh, gravely. "It appears to
have a decided bearing on a case I understand you are interested
in, Thornton?"</p>

<p>"A great bearing, indeed," replied Rugh, with a slight
smile.</p>

<p>"There is a cameo brooch here with a similar inscription and a
wedding ring, without inscription. Did the dead woman wear a
wedding ring, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Reginald."</p>

<p>"Then we must assume the woman had been twice married."</p>

<p>Sir Reginald dropped the three trinkets into an envelope and
sealed it. "As these may be of importance to you later Thornton,
I have separated them from the rest of the articles. If you want
them produced at any time, an application to Inspector Richards
will make them available."</p>

<p>The Chief then turned to the two envelopes, sweeping the other
trinkets aside. Picking up a knife he carefully slit one open. It
contained half-a-dozen sheets of foolscap paper, closely written.
Sir Reginald glanced down the first page, and then laid it face
down on his desk.</p>

<p>"Inspector Richards informed me he made you gentlemen a
definite promise that you should be at the examination of this
box and, as far as possible made aware of the contents of these
envelopes," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton and Mr. Stone can be trusted, sir," said
Inspector Richards gravely. "I made the promise in view of the
possibility that certain information in the envelopes might be of
value to Mr. Thornton in regard to the Carson Loan case, he is
handling."</p>

<p>"In that case." The Commissioner paused. "I have your word,
gentlemen, that nothing occurring in this room will be mentioned
outside without the express permission of Inspector
Richards?"</p>

<p>The two investigators gave the required assurances. Brinston
picked up the document again.</p>

<p>"This document, gentlemen, solves a series of the most
mysterious crimes that have baffled the police of New South
Wales," he commenced. "I may add that it also provides the clue
to the murder now known in the newspapers as the Little Bay
Mystery. In fact it gives the motives for the murder and, with
the examination of the two people arrested last night in the
house at Coomber Street, should go far towards obtaining a
conviction of the murderers. The document is a statement by the
woman Ruth Collins and is duly sworn to and witnessed by a
Justice of the Peace."</p>

<p>The Commissioner cleared his throat and commenced to read:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">I, Ruth Collins, a married woman living apart
from my husband, and now residing at 13 Coomber Street, Surrey
Hills, Sydney, on oath state: I am in fear of my life from the
threats of three men named Leonard Warrington, residing at Prince
Street, Ultimo; Thomas Pleiss, and Walter Reynolds, whose
addresses I do not know. These men have threatened to murder me,
because, in a moment of passion, I threatened I would inform the
police of certain facts known to me. I became acquainted with
Leonard Warrington about the beginning of March, 192&mdash;. He
introduced me to the other men. At that time I was separated from
my husband and living with a man named Theodore James, as his
wife. James was tired of me and had threatened to leave me. Leo
told me he would take me to live with him if I could keep my
mouth shut. I was not in love with Warrington, but accepted his
offer, as I did not know what else to do. I thought Warrington
was employed as a builders' labourer, but found when I had been
with him only a few days that he lived only by crime. He forced
me to go on the streets to earn a living and to obtain
information for him from the men I met. For some reason James
sought me out again and wanted me to go back to him. I was
willing, but Warrington threatened to do for me if I left him.
James told told me he was expecting to obtain a large sum of
money shortly. He would not tell me where it was coming from.
Warrington forced the information from me and then told me to
keep in touch with James, and to promise James I would go back to
him, later. James did not know I was living with Warrington. He
thought I was living alone.<br>
<br> One day James told me he
would have the money the next day, and asked me to go to him
then. I told Warrington and he told me to tell James I would go
to him. Warrington told me to see Harry Wheelson at 13 Coomber
Street and hire a room from him for myself and to go and live
there. I was to persuade James to come to me there.<br>
<br>
James did not want to come to Coomber Street for he had taken a
flat at Darlinghurst. I told him I could not give up the room
just then and that if he wanted me he must come to me there. We
arranged he was to come to Coomber Street for a couple of days
and then I was to go to Darlinghurst. The second day he was at
Coomber Street he told me he had received the money, and showed
me a large roll of notes. When I could get away from him I
telephoned Warrington that James had received the money. That
night Warrington and Pleiss came to Coomber Street and brought
some drink with them. They put something in the drink they gave
to James. When he was insensible Warrington told me to go back to
Ultimo and to hold my tongue. I thought they were only going to
rob James. The next day I saw the account of the finding of
James's body in Centennial Park, naked, and with the clothes on
the body. I accused Warrington of murdering James and he said
there had been an accident, and that if I did not hold my tongue
he would serve me the same.<br>
<br> I was afraid for my life,
and said nothing. One night in Elizabeth Street I met Walter
Reynolds and a man named Brownlow. Reynolds introduced me to
Brownlow, and whispered I was to make an appointment with
Brownlow for the following night at Coomber Street. I did so.
When I saw Warrington I asked him what he intended to do. He said
there would be no mistake this time and told me not to go to
Coomber Street.<br>
<br> The next day I saw the account in the
newspapers of the finding of Brownlow's body in Centennial Park,
with the clothes neatly folded on the body. I then left
Warrington and went to live with Maudie Wheelson. Warrington
wanted me to go back to Ultimo, but I told him I would tell the
police if he molested me. He said he would let me alone if I
promised to hold my tongue, but if I breathed a word of the
matter to anyone he would get me the same way. I am afraid.
Warrington and Pleiss are watching me. I know they do not think
they are safe as long I am alive. I am writing this myself and
will take it to a Justice of the Peace and swear to it. Perhaps
the police will find it when I am gone.</p>

<br>

<p>The Commissioner laid down the sheet of paper and looked at
Inspector Richards.</p>

<p>"You have warrants out against these men, Warrington and
Pleiss?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I shall now apply for a warrant against this man
Walter Reynolds. We brought in Henry and Maudie Wheelson this
morning as accessory to the Little Bay murder. I don't know if we
can hold them for that, but we can hold them for the Park
murders."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can help you, Inspector, on that point," said Rugh
quietly. "I picked that up on the landing outside Ruth Collins'
room."</p>

<p>He handed over the woman's stocking, and pointed out the
bloodstains. Richards examined it carefully before passing it on
to the Commissioner.</p>

<p>"You say you found this in the house in Coomber Street, Mr.
Thornton," said Brinston. "Why did you not inform the Inspector
at the time?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Richards and Mr. Stone had already left the house.
Until I examined it at my office I had but a hazy notion of the
extent of my find. Even now, its value depends on whether it
matches the stocking found with the body."</p>

<p>"There is a better test than that, Thornton." The Commissioner
smiled grimly. He rolled back the top seam of the stocking and
held it out across the desk. In small letters were the initials
"R.C."</p>

<p>"Then Ruth Collins was murdered at the house in Coomber
Street, and not at Little Bay," exclaimed Rugh. "I had an
impression that would be found to be the case."</p>

<p>"We now come to the matter of the second envelope," remarked
Brinston. He took the knife and slit the top.</p>

<p>There was a bulky package within the envelope. The Chief
pulled it out and looked it over. On one side it bore the
inscription "To be handed to the Tiger Lily after my death."</p>

<p>"The Tiger Lily," mused the Chief. "I seem to have heard of
that person before."</p>

<p>"There is a young woman in Surry Hills who is called by that
name," said Richards briefly.</p>

<p>"So. Will you advise her I have this package, Richards? Tell
her I would like her to apply to me personally for it. I think it
advisable I should see the contents when it is opened."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<p class="first">LEAVING the Commissioner's office, Rugh and
Inspector Richards walked down the grand staircase together. In
the lobby Richards turned towards his office, beckoning the
investigator to follow him. The Inspector motioned Rugh to a
chair and then sat down at his desk.</p>

<p>"I owe you an apology, Thornton," he said, after a long pause.
"It isn't often I have to acknowledge I am wrong, and I don't
think I can be very graceful about it, but&mdash;well, I'd just
like to shake hands. That's all."</p>

<p>Rugh grasped the police officer's hand heartily.</p>

<p>"That's all right, old man," he replied. "The principal thing
is that we've solved the problem. It's up to you now to lay hands
on the fellows."</p>

<p>"With the solution of the problem your interest in the case
ceases?" asked Richards, curiously.</p>

<p>"Not altogether." Rugh thought a moment. "Look here, Richards,
I don't know how you stand, but if you can take a hand in the
Carson case I'd be glad to have you with me. In fact, my opinion
is that it is drifting in a great measure to a state where you,
or the Police Department, will have to handle it."</p>

<p>"You mean to say there is criminal fraud showing?" asked the
Inspector.</p>

<p>"Yes. Now listen."</p>

<p>For a couple of hours the two men sat in earnest conversation,
discussing the Carson Loan Case, detail by detail. At the end of
the sitting Richards had promised hearty co-operation with the
investigator.</p>

<p>Tired and weary as he was with the long night work, Rugh
determined he would get word to the Tiger Lily of the mysterious
package awaiting her in the hands of the Commissioner of Police.
Jumping on a tram, he went down to Buckingham Street and entered
Shorty Matt's tobacconist shop.</p>

<p>Matt came shuffling forward in his usual slouching manner,
betraying no sign of recognition. Rugh glanced into the saloon.
It was empty.</p>

<p>"Cigar, Matt, please."</p>

<p>The man pulled down a few boxes, and left Rugh to make his
selection while he went into the back room. In a moment he
returned with some insurance forms which he placed on the counter
before the investigator.</p>

<p>"I'm insuring this place," he said briefly. Rugh looked
puzzled.</p>

<p>"I'm an assurance investigator, Matt," he said. "I have
nothing to do with the trading part of the business."</p>

<p>"I'm watched," was Matt's brief reply.</p>

<p>Rugh pulled out his fountain pen and commenced to fill in
certain particulars on the forms.</p>

<p>"Seen the Tiger Lily lately?" he asked softly. "What's your
full name?" This last more loudly.</p>

<p>"Do you want her?" Matt answered. "Thomas Henry Matthews."</p>

<p>"Tell her police raided Maudie's. Found evidence convicting
Leo and others. What's the number of this house?"</p>

<p>"Forty-three. Anything more?"</p>

<p>"Found iron box hidden by Ruth Collins with papers in it. How
much are you insuring for?"</p>

<p>"Five hundred."</p>

<p>"Package in box addressed Tiger Lily. Commissioner of Police
has it. Tell her to go to him for it. All safe. I'll get that put
through to-day for you, Mr. Matthews."</p>

<p>Two men who had been loitering outside the shop entered, and
looked at Rugh suspiciously as they went into the saloon. The
investigator made a great show of folding up the forms and
placing them in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Well, good-day, Mr. Matthews and thank you."</p>

<p>One of the men in the saloon called impatiently. Shorty Matt
left the counter and went to him. Rugh went to leave the
shop.</p>

<p>Two men standing in the doorway moved so that he could pass
between them. One was a big, hulking fellow, with a hard, brutal
face. The other was much shorter and slimmer. As Rugh stepped on
to the pavement he looked at the shorter man. He was red-headed.
Rugh half-stopped. Somewhere he had seen that red-headed man
before. Then memory came to him. It was the driver of the
taxi-cab who had attempted to abduct him. It was Ginger Pleiss.</p>

<p>Before the investigator could act, his arms were seized from
behind and he was swung clear of the shop. He tried to struggle,
but the man holding him had hands of steel. Ginger Pleiss
advanced towards him, his right hand hidden under his coat. There
was a smile of evil determination on the man's face. Someone in
the road shouted. Rugh gave a violent swerve. At the same time
Ginger Pleiss's hand came from under his coat, armed with a short
bar. He made a vicious swing at the investigator's head, but the
blow landed on Rugh's shoulder. Again Ginger raised his hand.
Rugh staggered forward. The street was whirling around him. He
was conscious of a violent blow on the head, then the iron hands
that held him were suddenly relaxed, and he fell
down&mdash;down&mdash;down.</p>

<p>Someone was splashing water on his face. He tried to turn his
head. It was resting on something soft, and there was a perfume
near, vaguely familiar. But he could not remember. He tried to
raise his hand to his head. Someone was beating a drum with a
monotonous regularity that was driving him frantic. He wanted to
call to them to stop, but he could not speak. Then the drum began
to fade away. It got fainter and fainter until it was lost in the
surges of the rolling seas. That was the meaning of the water on
his face. It was the sea. He was in the water, resting on its
soft bosom. It was soothing him to sleep. He wanted to sleep, but
he was slipping down again. Down. Where? He didn't want to think.
Then all was a blank, and he slept.</p>

<p>Slowly, Rugh opened his eyes and looked around. It was dark.
His head ached, but he felt comfortable, and&mdash;so tired. He
moved his hand. He was in bed; he could feel the clothes around
him. But&mdash;this was not his room. The furniture was
strange.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he whispered.</p>

<p>Someone got up from a chair beside the bedside and leaned over
him. It was the Tiger Lily.</p>

<p>"Lily."</p>

<p>"You know me, Rugh."</p>

<p>"Where am I?"</p>

<p>"In my home." The girl hesitated. "Shorty Matt sent for me and
I brought you home."</p>

<p>"Did they escape?"</p>

<p>Lily did not answer. She turned to a small table and picked up
a glass.</p>

<p>"Drink this, Rugh."</p>

<p>Obediently he swallowed the mixture.</p>

<p>"Did they escape?"</p>

<p>"No, Rugh. They were captured. Now you must try and
sleep."</p>

<p>"Sleep? I have been asleep for days." Rugh laughed feebly.
"How long have I been here, Lily?"</p>

<p>"Three days, Rugh. You have been very ill."</p>

<p>Rugh lay silent for some time. He was trying to think. He had
lain here three days. What had happened in the world during that
time?</p>

<p>"What day is it, Lily?"</p>

<p>"Thursday. Rugh, you must not talk. At least, not until the
doctor has seen you."</p>

<p>She placed her cool, firm hand on his brow. Slowly, he reached
up and drew it down into the hollow of his neck. She let it rest
there, and he was content&mdash;and slept.</p>

<p>Rugh was awakened by the sound of a man's voice in the room.
Opening his eyes, he looked up into a bearded face.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Thornton. How do you feel now?"</p>

<p>"Fit to get up, doctor," answered Rugh, with a smile.</p>

<p>"We will see about that later." The doctor smiled as he
re-arranged the bandages. "You've had a nasty smash-up on the head and had better rest quiet for a couple of days. Drink this."</p>

<p>When Rugh awoke again the daylight was streaming into the
room. He lay still for some time, idly watching the sunbeams
dancing on the furniture. Then he turned his head. Lily was
seated in a low seat by the bedside, reading.</p>

<p>She had not noticed he was awake. He lay watching her. The
Tiger Lily. He laughed softly to himself. This sweet, womanly
girl, the Tiger Lily of Surry Hills. It was absurd. She was pure
girl, adorable, desirable.</p>

<p>A movement drew the girl's attention. She put down her book
and came over to him.</p>

<p>"Awake, Rugh? How do you feel?"</p>

<p>"Good. Friday, Lily?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I've got to be at the meeting of the Board of Directors of
the Balmain and South on Monday afternoon," he said.</p>

<p>"I know, Rugh. Keep quiet and you shall be there. Rest a
little while and I will let you see a visitor."</p>

<p>"Harry?"</p>

<p>"No." Lily laughed, deliciously. "Lizzie has gone to the
hospital to see him. Rugh, I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lizzie and Harry?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The girl hesitated. "Rugh, you won't judge her by me.
She's a good girl. I'll tell you all about her, one day."</p>

<p>"If I judged her by you they'd get my blessing." Rugh grinned.
"Say, Lily, how about making a double of it?"</p>

<p>"Hush." Lily laid her finger on his lips. "You know that can
never be. Now sleep, Rugh. I must leave you for a
time&mdash;dear."</p>

<p>She had called him "dear." Rugh smiled as he lay back on the
pillows. Harry and Lizzie. It was great.</p>

<p>And Lizzie was a good sport. She would just suit the
irresponsible journalist.</p>

<p>An hour later Lily returned to him.</p>

<p>"Awake, Rugh? Good. I've brought you a visitor."</p>

<p>Lily stood on one side, and the portly form of Constable
Nicholls loomed by the bedside.</p>

<p>"Hullo, constable." Rugh laughed weakly. "How's the chase for
the murderers?"</p>

<p>"I got 'em, sir," answered the constable proudly.</p>

<p>"Got them?" Rugh sat up in the bed quickly.</p>

<p>"Got who?"</p>

<p>"Leo Warrington and Tom Pleiss," replied the constable. "Got
'em sweet, but I wasn't in time to prevent 'em gettin' you
first."</p>

<p>"Sit down, and tell me all about it," Rugh exclaimed
excitedly.</p>

<p>Lily brought a chair to the bedside for the constable.</p>

<p>"You're to lie down and speak quietly," she commanded; "or I
shall have to send Constable Nicholls away."</p>

<p>"Get on with your story, Nicholls," exclaimed Rugh. "What do
you mean by saying you got them?"</p>

<p>"It's like this, sir," commenced the constable. "When Mr.
Suth'land got that thump on th' head an' went to th' 'orspital, I
went t' see 'im an' talk over th' case. An' 'e ses ter me as 'ow
now they'd got 'im they'd lay for you. So, ses 'e, you watch Mr.
Thornton, ses 'e."</p>

<p>"So you dogged me?" interjected Rugh.</p>

<p>"It's lucky as me leave was due, sir," continued Nicholls. "I
took it, an' many a fine dance you've led me, sir. I never knew a
man ter get about as you do. Anyhow, I sticks ter your trail, an'
kept me eyes open, same as Mr. Suth'land advised."</p>

<p>"You saw me go into Shorty Matt's?"</p>

<p>"I did, sir. I watched you go inter th' shop, an' then I saw
two men foller yer in, an two more come up an' loiter outside. I
watched 'em careful, an' then you came out, an' one ov th' men
grabbed you an' th' other, 'e up wi' a bit ov lead pipin' an'
'its at you. But jest at th' time you wriggles, an' don't get a
fair swipe. Th' other chap calls tew 'im to 'it you agen, but I'm
there by that time. I 'its th' big chap as is 'oldin' you, in the
back, jest as th' other man makes another swipe, an' blowed if 'e
don't catch 'is mate right across th' beano. So I takes th'
smaller man an' sits 'im right across th' big chap, an' blows me
whistle fit ter bust. Then me mates come an' take 'em to Regent
Street.</p>

<p>"'Wot's th' charge?' says th' Sergeant.</p>

<p>"'Hassault, sir,' ses I. 'Hassaultin' Mr. Harry Suth'land, as
is now in Sydney 'Orspital; also hassaultin' Mr. Rugh Thornton,
an' I don't quite know where 'e is, fer they carried 'im inter
th' terbacconnist's shop.'</p>

<p>"'Anythin' more?' asks th' Sergeant, suspicious-like.</p>

<p>"'An' fer th' murder of Ruth Collins at Little Bay,' I ses,
quiet like. An' you should 'ave seen 'im stare."</p>

<p>"Good, constable. I congratulate you." Rugh held out his hand.
"You've done well."</p>

<p>"Must say as I thinks so, too, sir," said Nicholls,
complacently. "Wot d'yer think, sir? They're getting up a
suberscription a' Randwick ter give me a gold watch."</p>

<p>"What does Inspector Richards say to that?" laughed Rugh.</p>

<p>"'Im, sir? Why, 'e's as nice as they makes 'em. 'E came right
out to me 'ouse, an' shook 'ands wi' me, an' ses as 'e
congraterlated me. Ses as 'ow 'e'll see as I 'ave a step in rank.
As nice a man as you'd wish ter see, an' speak to; an' sir,
'atween me an' you, as clever as they makes 'em."</p>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<p class="first">THE board-room of the Balmain and South
Assurance Company is a long, low, gloomy room. Used only for the
meetings of the Board, it has the close, musty atmosphere of
disuse. Along the centre of the room runs a long table, on each
side of which are six low-backed armchairs. At the head of the
table is a solitary armchair, with an over-high back, giving it
the appearance of a throne. On either side of this chair are two
doors, one leading to the offices and the other direct into the
private office of the managing director. The walls are coloured a
dull green, and have the appearance of having collected
generations of dust on their surfaces. From the low ceiling
depends a heavy brass chandelier, of old-fashioned pattern, used
originally for gas, but now converted to electric light.</p>

<p>On the Monday afternoon following the assault on Rugh
Thornton, and the capture of Warrington and Pleiss, the Board of
the Balmain and South met in extraordinary session. The purpose,
as explained by the Chairman of Directors, Sir Henry
Schillington, was to decide on a claim made by Mr. Colin Carson
for the repayment of a loan of fifty thousand pounds, and
interest to date, made to the company some dozen years
previously.</p>

<p>"I believe," concluded Sir Henry, "you gentlemen are fully
conversant with the various details of this business. It has been
before us many times, and I, for one, shall be glad to see it
finalised. I believe the applicant, Mr. Colin Carson, is in
attendance, Mr. Orchard?"</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard, sitting at the right-hand of the Chairman of
Directors, nodded assent. He was not looking well. His face was
worn and haggard, and his eyes continually roamed round the room,
as if in search of some missing face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carson and his solicitor, Mr. Leferve, of Leferve and
Sunderland, are both in attendance, Sir Henry," Wilbur Orchard
said, rising to his feet. "Is it your pleasure I invite them to
meet the Board?"</p>

<p>Sir Henry looked round the table. Some of the members of the
Board were not looking towards him. Others gave a slight nod of
assent.</p>

<p>"I think it would be wise, Mr. Orchard," decided, Sir Henry.
"The sum involved is, I believe, a considerable amount of
money?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred thousand pounds." Wilbur Orchard looked round the
table. "Before inviting these gentlemen to attend us I should
like to make an explanation of the circumstances surrounding this
case."</p>

<p>"Do you think it necessary, Mr. Orchard?" Sir Henry looked at
his watch. "I should like to close the meeting within half an
hour, if possible."</p>

<p>"I shall only take up a few minutes of your time." Wilbur
Orchard was gently insistent. Sir Henry looked up and nodded.</p>

<p>"You gentlemen are aware that I had the honour to be the
managing director of this company at the time this loan was
negotiated," continued Wilbur Orchard. "During those negotiations
I came in personal touch with Mr. Carson, and had intimate
conversations with him."</p>

<p>The managing director paused, and wetted his lips from a glass
of water standing before him.</p>

<p>"Since Mr. Carson applied for the repayment of the loan, I
have had two interviews with him&mdash;once in the presence of
his solicitor, Mr. Leferve, and one in my office, when he called
at my request. At the later interview Mr. Archibald Weston, of
Messrs. Weston, Sans &amp; Hamilton, attended. I have here a
letter from Mr. Weston, in which he states he has examined the
credentials of Mr. Carson and is confident he is the person he
claims to be, and the person who lent the money to the
company."</p>

<p>Again Orchard paused, and looked towards the door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Weston was not, at the time the loan was made by Mr.
Carson, acting directly for the company. His partner, Mr.
Hamilton&mdash;now, I regret to say, dead&mdash;was handling the
company's business. Mr. Weston only saw Mr. Carson once, at the
time the loan was negotiated, and, I believe, did not have any
extended conversation with him. But, gentlemen, I am convinced
that the Mr. Colin Carson who will, within a few minutes, attend
this Board, is the man with whom I negotiated the loan that saved
this company from bankruptcy, some twelve years ago. He has
convinced me, and has brought back to my remembrance certain
incidents that occurred at the time, and which I had forgotten.
Have I the permission of the Board to request the attendance of
Mr. Carson?"</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard sat down, and for a few moments there was
silence.</p>

<p>"Sir Henry." A short, red-faced man seated near the bottom of
the table jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Samuel Cohen," said Sir Henry, with an inclination of his
head.</p>

<p>"I have listened to Mr. Wilbur Orchard's explanation with
great interest. I&mdash;er&mdash;well, Sir Henry, 'ow does it
come as Mr. Orchard ain't said nothing about the other
claimant?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand, Mr. Cohen." Sir Henry looked at the
managing director.</p>

<p>"There is no other claimant, Mr. Cohen." Wilbur Orchard
flushed as he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there is." The little man remained on his feet, and
faced the managing director, defiantly. "I have 'ere a letter
from the guardian of the lady as is the claimant."</p>

<p>"Oh." Wilbur Orchard forced a smile. "You are referring to a
claim that might eventuate from a lady claiming to be the
daughter of Mr. Colin Carson."</p>

<p>"That's 'er." Sam Cohen was excited. "As nice a girl as I've
come across. Her name's Myrtle Seaton, and she's a
pea&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sir Henry coughed, and Sam Cohen, suddenly reminded of the
austere dignity suitable to the occasion, blushed.</p>

<p>"I beg to move, Sir H-henery," stuttered the little man, "that
the matter be deferred un&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I object." Wilbur Orchard sprang to his feet, "Mr. Cohen is
referring to an&mdash;er&mdash;abstract claim. I can put it in no
other words. That claim has been advanced by a Mr. Samuel Brene,
on behalf of his niece, Miss Rita Myrtle Seaton. Mr. Brene has
not put in any proof the lady is the person he represents her to
be."</p>

<p>"He's going to," interjected Cohen.</p>

<p>"I am not concerned with Mr. Brene's future actions," snapped
Orchard, angrily. "The only application I have had from Mr. Brene
on behalf of Miss Seaton is that the decision on the matter of
the repayment of the loan be deferred until he has had full
opportunity of examining Miss Seaton's father's papers."</p>

<p>"Seaton! Carson! How is it that the daughter's name is
different to her father's?" interposed Sir Henry in a perplexed
voice.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brene, in a personal interview," explained the managing
director in a patient tone, "gave me to understand that Mr.
Seaton was of a somewhat eccentric character. He assumed several
names at various times."</p>

<p>"What I want to know is," cried Mr. Cohen, jumping to his
feet, "what are we going to do if we pay this 'ere Colin Carson
and then find the girl is entitled to the money?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cohen should know that the father's claim comes first,"
Wilbur Orchard exploded. "The loan was made to us by Mr. Carson,
and is repayable to him personally. In the event of the decease
of Mr. Carson the loan became payable to Rita Carson&mdash;not
Miss Myrtle Seaton."</p>

<p>Several of the directors nodded their heads in agreement.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say as this 'ere Miss Myrtle Seaton is not the
dinkum goods?" Cohen waved his arms vigorously. "Well, you've
only got ter look into 'er eyes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me," Sir Henry gently expostulated, "You don't mean to
tell me, Mr. Cohen, that you, a respectable married man, look
into the eyes of young ladies. For shame, Mr. Cohen."</p>

<p>Sir Henry's pleasantry caused a little titter to run round the
table. It was cut short by Cohen.</p>

<p>"There's them as might follow their words," he retorted. "When
me an' my missus dropped into th' H'ambassadors th' other Friday
night there was someone as ain't sitting far from the 'ead of
this table as warn't looking inter no married woman's eyes. She
was as dainty a piece of fluff as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me," Sir Henry gently expostulated, a slight flush on
his cheeks, "We are getting away from the business in hand.
Gentlemen, we are agreed that Mr. Carson shall be invited to
attend the Board. Yes? Mr. Orchard, I believe you said that Mr.
Carson was in attendance."</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard rose from his seat and made for the door.</p>

<p>"Half a mo', Orchard." Cohen was on his feet again. "I move,
Sir H-enery, that Mr. Sam Brene be also invited to attend."</p>

<p>"Mr. Brene?" Sir Henry looked bewildered. "I have not
understood that Mr. Brene was in attendance."</p>

<p>"Mr. Brene is not here, Sir Henry," said Orchard,
emphatically.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he is." Cohen was on his feet waving a defiant hand
at the managing director. "I sent him a line to say as he was to
be here. Fetch 'im, Orchard."</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard left the room, to return followed by three men.
Brene was the last of the three to enter.</p>

<p>"Mr. Colin Carson; Mr. Leferve, Mr. Carson's solicitor; and
Mr. Sam Brene," introduced Wilbur Orchard.</p>

<p>Sir Henry rose to his feet and bowed. When the newcomers had
been provided with seats, Mr. Leferve stood up.</p>

<p>"Sir Henry," he said, "I have come here at the request of my
client, Mr. Colin Carson. I formally protest against these
proceedings, and shall advise my client not to answer any
questions relating to subjects other than the loan."</p>

<p>"I appreciate your attitude, Mr. Leferve," replied Sir Henry.
"We will do our utmost to meet your wishes. At the same time I
must advise you the Board finds itself in a certain difficulty.
Another claimant has come forward."</p>

<p>Colin Carson sprang from his seat. His solicitor placed a
warning hand on his arm..</p>

<p>"Mr. Carson, you will allow me to deal with this situation,"
he said. "May I ask, Sir Henry, if there is a dispute as to my
client's bona fides?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," Sir Henry hastened to reassure him. "The
claim is made on behalf or a Miss Myrtle Rita Seaton, who claims
to be the daughter of Mr. Colin Carson."</p>

<p>"Is Miss Seaton here?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"No." The answer came from Sam Brene. He sat with his little
pig eyes half-closed, leaning on the handle of a heavy rosewood
walking stick. "I represent my niece, Miss Seaton."</p>

<p>"Your niece? Then you are acquainted with Mr. Colin Carson? Do
you recognise him?" The solicitor spoke eagerly.</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Carson recognise me?" Sam Brene looked lazily at the
claimant.</p>

<p>Mr. Leferve looked at his client. Colin Carson did not reply.
For some minutes there was an air of tension in the room, broken
by Sam Cohen bouncing to his feet.</p>

<p>"Sir H-enery, we are wasting valuable time. What I want to
know is: Mr. Orchard told us a few days ago there was a
blo&mdash;man who was engaged to look into the matter. Why ain't
'e 'ere? H-as Mr. Orchard 'ad any report from 'im, or what?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cohen is doubtless referring to Mr. Rugh
Thornton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's 'is name," interrupted Cohen. "Well, what's 'e say
about these 'ere claimants?"</p>

<p>"I haven't heard from Mr. Thornton for some time," said the
managing director testily. "He made a great fuss about being
allowed to attend this Board meeting, but he has not put in an
appearance. I have not a report from him."</p>

<p>"Rugh Thornton," mused Sir Henry. "Let me see. Yes. Was it not
a Mr. Rugh Thornton who was violently assaulted in Surry Hills
the other day?"</p>

<p>"That's 'im," said Cohen. "Well, what does 'e say?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid Mr. Thornton will be too ill to attend at
present," answered Sir Henry. "We hope he will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rugh Thornton is here." The voice came from the door behind
Sir Henry.</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard jumped to his feet and stared at the
investigator. Rugh left the door by which he had entered the
Board room, and walked to the foot of the table. He was followed
by Inspector Richards.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton," said Sir Henry, rising from his seat.</p>

<p>"I have the written permission of Mr. Orchard to attend this
meeting of the Directors of the Company," said Rugh calmly. "I
claim the right to act in this matter for the company under the
instructions I have received from your managing director."</p>

<p>"Good. That's it," ejaculated Mr. Cohen. "Now we'll get down
to tacks. Now, Mr. Thornton, what do you know about this 'ere
claimant?"</p>

<p>"Which is Mr. Carson?" Inspector Richards asked the
question.</p>

<p>"There 'e is." Cohen pointed towards the claimant. "'E ain't
'ad a bloomin' word to say for hisself."</p>

<p>Richards walked over to the claimant, and laid his hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Walter Reynolds, I arrest you for the murder of John Brownlow
in Centennial Park on the 16th of May, 1923. I must also inform
you that other charges are pending against you."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<p class="first">"WHAT do you mean?" shouted Wilbur Orchard,
jumping to his feet. "That man is Colin Carson. I have identified
him."</p>

<p>Richards had drawn Reynolds away to the far end of the room
and had seated himself beside him. The man had not replied to the
charge made against him. Deathly pale, he yet wore a defiant
attitude.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Orchard." Rugh was standing at the foot of the table,
the paleness of his face accentuated by the white bandages
swathing his head. "You know better than that."</p>

<p>Sir Henry sat silent for a moment. Then he turned and looked
at Wilbur Orchard. The managing director had sunk back in his
chair, a look of baffled fury on his face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton," said the chairman of Directors "you have made
a somewhat dramatic entry into this room. You have arrested one
man, the claimant, Colin Carson. You have charged our old and
valued managing director, with felonious knowledge that the man
is a fraud. May we ask for an explanation?"</p>

<p>Rugh stood at the foot of the table, swaying dizzily. His
dramatic entry, at the time the schemer's plans had been on the
point of success, had been too much for him.</p>

<p>"'Ere." Sam Cohen walked down to the foot of the table and put
his arm around the investigator. "Someone get 'im a chair. Can't
you see 'e 's not well?"</p>

<p>A few minutes and Rugh raised his head. He attempted to rise
to his feet.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Thornton," said Sir. Henry. "Take your time. We
are anxious to give you every opportunity."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sir Henry." Rugh spoke in a low, weak voice. "I
may say at once I have all the evidence necessary to substantiate
the statements I have made. Inspector Richards is acquainted with
the proofs I hold, and has acquiesced in my desire that the
evidence be laid before your Board at this meeting. Later, of
course, the evidence will become public through the criminal
proceedings.</p>

<p>"It will be necessary for me to go back to the time when the
loan of fifty thousand pounds was made to the company by a Mr.
Colin Carson. I will not bother you with the story told to me by
Mr. Wilbur Orchard. Partly correct, in essentials it was grossly
misleading."</p>

<p>"The man's off his head. Am I to be forced to listen to these
ravings?" Wilbur Orchard rose to his feet and with an angry
gesture moved towards the door.</p>

<p>"There is a police officer behind that door, Wilbur Orchard,"
observed Rugh quietly. "He has orders to arrest you if you
attempt to leave this room."</p>

<p>"Damn you! On what charge?"</p>

<p>"You will learn that presently." Rugh turned to face Sir Henry
Schillington.</p>

<p>"I will first deal with the history of Colin Carson. Many of
you no doubt remember Bishop Marshland, a moneylender of this
city years ago. Marshland was his trade name. In private life he
was known as Colin Carson."</p>

<p>"Colin Carson was Bishop Marshland? Why, I knew 'im well. 'E
wasn't a bit like that bloke!" Cohen pointed dramatically at the
man seated beside Inspector Richards.</p>

<p>"Carson, or Marshland, suffered from tuberculosis, and, owing
to ill-health, had decided to retire from business. The loan to
the Balmain and South appealed to him. He had decided to go to
Switzerland to test a widely advertised cure. The fifty thousand
pounds was nearly all his fortune. Invested in the company it was
safe, and if he returned to the Commonwealth, easily collected.
If, on the other hand, he died abroad, the terms of the loan deed
allowed it to pass easily to his daughter."</p>

<p>Rugh was speaking with some difficulty. The excitement after
his long, quiet confinement, was making, him tired and unable to
think clearly.</p>

<p>"'Ere, 'ave a drink, old chap." Cohen was standing by his
side, holding a glass of water. Rugh drank thirstily.</p>

<p>"Before leaving Australia Colin Carson provided for the
education of his daughter at a convent school for a couple of
years," continued Rugh. "At the same time he provided liberally
for his wife during his absence. I may say here, Mrs. Carson had
caused her husband a great deal of trouble. She was a drug
addict. Colin Carson lived to return to Australia, not cured,
but greatly benefited. He found his wife had disappeared. His
daughter was still at the convent school. Inquiries, proved to be
untrue, informed him his wife was in Brisbane. He went
there."</p>

<p>"Colin Carson was a widower. He told me so," contradicted the
managing director.</p>

<p>"Did he?" There was a deep significance in the tone in which
the investigator answered the interruption.</p>

<p>"Before Carson had been in Brisbane many days he met with a
serious accident. He was knocked down by a motor car, and taken
to hospital. He died there."</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Are we going to sit here all the afternoon listening to these
fairy tales?" he stuttered. "We want proof."</p>

<p>Rugh looked steadily at the excited man.</p>

<p>"You want proof? Very well." He turned to the police
officer.</p>

<p>Richards went to the door and spoke to the man on duty. In a
few minutes the Tiger Lily entered the room.</p>

<p>"Sir Henry Schillington, I call my first witness, Miss Lily
Dalton."</p>

<p>Wilbur Orchard stared in amazement for a second.</p>

<p>"Sir Henry," he shouted, "I should inform you this woman is a
felon. She is well-known by another name in the slums."</p>

<p>"The Tiger-Lily." The girl smiled at the excited man
mockingly. "Will you tell Sir Henry the name I bear in Surry
Hills, and how I came to bear it?"</p>

<p>"You?" Wilbur Orchard leaned forward, staring at the girl.
"Sir Henry, this girl was at one time a confidential clerk in
this office. She was convicted of stealing a sum of of money and,
after conviction, was imprisoned at Long Bay."</p>

<p>"Is that true?" asked Sir Henry gravely.</p>

<p>"It is true." Lily looked at her questioner proudly. "Wilbur
Orchard was the principal and only witness against me."</p>

<p>Rugh's eyes lighted. With a low exclamation he moved to the
girl's side.</p>

<p>"Sir Henry," he exclaimed, "Mr. Orchard has forged another
chain in the evidence against him. Will you ask him the
circumstances of the case against Miss Dalton?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing I wish to conceal," the managing director
answered boldly. "This girl was my confidential clerk, and
therefore had easy access to my private office. I found that a
large sum of money I had one one day withdrawn from the bank was
missing. I had placed it in my overcoat pocket. The police were
called in. A search revealed it in this girl's handbag."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Rugh gravely, "I will deal with that matter
later. It is another count against Wilbur Orchard. At present,
Sir Henry, I will ask you to hear Miss Dalton's evidence, without
comment."</p>

<p>"Did you know Colin Carson, Miss Dalton?" asked Sir Henry,
after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>"I met him several times. He came to the convent school where
I was educated."</p>

<p>"Was Rita Carson a scholar at that school?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That is how you came to meet Mr. Carson?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Rita Carson was, and is, my greatest friend.</p>

<p>"Is that Colin Carson?" Sir Henry pointed to the man in the
corner of the room.</p>

<p>"No, Colin Carson is dead. He died in Brisbane."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" exclaimed Wilbur Orchard. "What we want is proof."</p>

<p>Inspector Richards walked to the table.</p>

<p>"I think this is where I come in," he said with a broad smile.
Seeing Sir Henry's glance towards his prisoner, he added: "Oh,
he's safe enough. Point of fact, Sir Henry, no one can leave this
room without my permission. There's quite a few people I shall
want, here."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the Chairman, startled.</p>

<p>"Nothing to worry you, Sir Henry. But we'd better get to
facts. I am going to produce certain documents Miss Dalton handed
to me in the presence of the Commissioner of Police last
Saturday. They were found in a raid on a house in Coomber Street
some days ago."</p>

<p>"You know Miss Dalton?"</p>

<p>"Well. Point of fact it was I who arrested her on that man's
charge. I would have seen him in &mdash;&mdash;" The Inspector
coughed. "I didn't know then, what I know now."</p>

<p>"What are these documents?"</p>

<p>"They're genuine, Sir Henry. First, I produce a copy of Colin
Carson's death certificate. This was obtained by the Queensland
police at my request, and only reached me Saturday."</p>

<p>The Inspector stood back and motioned Lily to continue.</p>

<p>"Mr. Orchard has told you I am the Tiger Lily," said the girl.
"While I was in prison I was visited by my schoolgirl chum, Rita
Carson. She was a rich woman, and promised to help me. She met me
when I was released and took me to a refuge she had provided for
me. There I became the Tiger Lily&mdash;to obtain proof of the
wrong that man had done to me."</p>

<p>The girl paused a moment, and then continued:</p>

<p>"Let me go on with the story of the Carsons. Mrs. Carson left
her husband nearly three years before his death. She was in
Sydney when he met with his fatal accident in Queensland. She
went to Brisbane, not for sentimental reasons, but to discover if
she could lay hands on any of his money. Mr. Carson had, however,
left his money to his daughter, conditional on her only allowing
her mother a certain fixed income. Furious at her disappointment,
Mrs. Carson left Brisbane."</p>

<p>"Where is Mrs. Carson now?" asked Sir Henry.</p>

<p>"She is dead." The girl spoke in a low voice. "She died a
terrible death."</p>

<p>"You mean?" Wilbur Orchard leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Ruth Carson married William Collins after her first husband's
death. It was her body the police found on the sandhills at
Little Bay."</p>

<p>Lily turned to the Inspector and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"This is Ruth Carson's certificate of marriage to William
Collins, at Bundaberg, Queensland." She handed the paper to Sir
Henry.</p>

<p>"Then Myrtle Seaton is Colin Carson's heiress," exclaimed Sam
Cohen, who had been following the narrative with keen interest.
"Thought that was it."</p>

<p>Lily smiled slightly.</p>

<p>"In some way Mr. Brene found out that a large sum of money
stood on the books of the Balmain and South Assurance Company in
the name of Colin Carson. He knew of Mr. Carson's death, and
schemed to obtain the money by substituting a tool of his for the
dead man. For the purpose of the fraud it was necessary that
Wilbur Orchard became a party in it. Mr. Brene approached Mr.
Orchard, and, to his surprise found the same idea had occurred a
long time before, to the man he planned to seduce to his ends.
Mr. Brene suggested he and Mr. Orchard make a partnership of the
matter, to be met by a blank refusal. Furious at being deprived
of a share of the plunder, Brene attempted to blackmail or
terrorise Mr. Orchard into admitting him into a share of the
scheme. It was for that purpose he sent the photograph of his
niece, Miss Seaton, to Mr. Orchard, without her knowledge, as the
photograph of Colin Carson's daughter."</p>

<p>"Then she's not the heiress." Sam Cohen looked disappointed.
"Why, Brene told me she as good as 'ad the fortune in 'er
'and."</p>

<p>"The mysterious telephone message to Mr. Orchard on the
morning of the publication of the news of the murder was another
attempt of Mr. Brene's to bring Mr. Orchard to terms. When he
found that Orchard was steadfast to obtain the whole of the money
himself and not to share it with him, Mr. Brene put in a claim
for the fortune in the name of his niece, stating her to be Rita
Carson, the heiress of Colin Carson. He had no intention of
pressing the claim. To do that he would have to prepare false
identification papers, and they would not stand the test of a
court case. His object was to stalemate Wilbur Orchard, and force
him to come to terms. The man Wilbur Orchard had put forward as
the true Colin Carson could not forward his claim through the
courts. Thus the position stood that Mr. Brene barred the path to
the money and expected to be bribed to withdraw."</p>

<p>"Who is James Smith, the bushman?" asked Rugh curiously.</p>

<p>"James Smith is George Walker. Inspector Richards can give you
his history," replied the girl. "He is one of the tools Mr. Brene
uses in the graft business he conducts in this city. The story of
the stocking and the Limping Man was designed to bring further
pressure on Mr. Orchard, through the publicity Mr. Sutherland
would give it in the <i>Star</i>."</p>

<p>"All this is most interesting, young lady," said Sir Henry
Schillington, with a smile of disbelief. "But it requires
proof."</p>

<p>"That is my business," interposed the burly Inspector. "I have
all the proof I want to secure the convictions. Harry Wheelson
has spilt the beans to save his neck."</p>

<p>"Are you Rita Carson?" asked Sir Henry, looking at the girl
anxiously.</p>

<p>Lily laughed and shook her head. Then she went to the door.
After a moment she returned, hand in hand with her adopted
sister.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," she said, a spark of mischief in her eyes, "May I
present you to Miss Elizabeth Rita Carson, the heiress of the
late Colin Carson. Sir Henry, the proofs of Miss Carson's
identity have been in the hands of Sir Reginald Brinston, the
Commissioner of Police, for some days. He is prepared to certify
they are correct and incontestable."</p>

<p>"Then who are you?" Sam Cohen asked the question bluntly.</p>

<p>"I am Lily Dalton, the school chum and adopted sister of
Lizzie Carson. It was she who came to me when I was at Long Bay,
falsely sworn to prison by Wilbur Orchard. It was Lizzie Carson
who gave me a home and a refuge, and provided me with the
opportunity and means to assume the identity of the Tiger Lily,
and to clear myself from the shame that man placed upon me."</p>

<p>"Then we have to arrange with this young lady for the
repayment of the loan her father, Colin Carson, made this
company?" Sir Henry looked puzzled. "Will you give me the name of
your solicitor, Miss Carson?"</p>

<p>"That is not necessary." Lizzie smiled slightly as she took
the document Lily handed her and passed it to the Chairman of the
Board. "This document will solve the mystery of the Carson
Loan."</p>

<p>"What is this?" Sir Henry took the deed and opened it. "Why,
it's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The original loan deed, duly discharged," concluded the fair
girl.</p>

<p>"But, my dear young lady, this gift&mdash;" Sir Henry
hesitated, and fumbled with his glasses. "It's very good of you to suggest such a thing, but the Board really can't&mdash;do you
realise you are offering the Board an immense fortune?"</p>

<p>"There is no fortune, Sir Henry," Lizzie spoke earnestly.
"When my father came back from Europe he applied to the company
for repayment of the loan. It was repaid by Mr. Orchard, I
believe out of his private money, and from borrowings. Only my
father's copy of the loan deed was endorsed. It is evident Mr.
Orchard planned this fraud from the very commencement."</p>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<p class="first">"A MOST unusual story." Sir Henry Schillington
sat back in his chair and addressed his fellow directors.
"Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Carson has, however, convinced me that the
story is true. Have you anything to say, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir. I suggest the Board adjourn. Of course, you
understand I have my duty to perform."</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"I hold warrants for the arrest of Mr. Wilbur Orchard and Mr.
Samuel Brene."</p>

<p>"Quite so. I rather expected that. Dear me. What a pity.
Gentlemen, the Board meeting is adjourned."</p>

<p>Sir Henry rose from his seat, and without looking at Wilbur
Orchard, opened the managing director's room door.</p>

<p>"Miss Carson, I shall be obliged if you and Miss Dalton will
give me a few moments in this room. Mr. Thornton, too,
please."</p>

<p>"Harry, you old scoundrel." Rugh sprang forward as he entered
the room, to clasp Harry Sutherland's hand. "What are you hiding
here for? Why didn't you come in to the bust-up?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't stand two broken heads in one Board room," grinned
the journalist, indicating his bandaged head. "Besides, I was out
of it. Had other fish to fry."</p>

<p>He looked at the investigator with a comical grin an his face.
Lizzie Carson, on entering the room, had come direct to his
side.</p>

<p>"Heard about it, you old fraud." Rugh seized Harry's hand
again and shook it, until the journalist wrenched it away.
"Playing possum in hospital were you?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton"&mdash;Sir Henry crossed to the small
group&mdash;"I have not had an opportunity to express to you my
personal thanks, and the thanks of the Board. We shall, I can
assure you, be most grateful for your fine work,
and&mdash;er&mdash;shall know how to appreciate it."</p>

<p>"Really, I have done very little, Sir Henry," said Rugh
soberly. "The credit for solving the Carson Loan Case and the
Little Bay Murder belongs almost entirely to Miss Dalton and Miss
Carson."</p>

<p>"Our principal performances," interjected Harry, with a broad
grin, "being the acquisition of cracked heads as the preliminary
to being interesting invalids."</p>

<p>"Ah, quite so." Sir Henry turned to the girl. "Miss Carson,
although you have relieved us from a very large liability there
remain, I believe, certain formalities our auditors will insist
on. I shall be glad if you will let me know the name of a
solicitor who will act for you, during the formalities I have
indicated."</p>

<p>"I shall refer you to Mr. Sutherland," said Lizzie, with a
blush. "He is assuming all my business worries."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sutherland." Sir Henry blinked.
"I&mdash;er&mdash;understood Mr. Sutherland was a journalist, not
a solicitor."</p>

<p>"I have lately been soliciting most successfully, Sir Henry."
The journalist caught Lizzie's hand in his.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" the Chairman of Directors laughed. "Very neat. That
means I am to congratulate you."</p>

<p>Rugh slipped across the room to where Lily was seated in a low
lounge chair. The girl looked tired and welcomed him with a wan
smile.</p>

<p>"You know my secret now, Rugh," she whispered, as he seated
himself on the arm of her chair. "You know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know that you are no longer a Mystery Girl," Rugh said
softly. "You are a Wonder Girl, my Wonder Girl."</p>

<p>"Rugh, I have been in prison."</p>

<p>"Then the prison became a palace, dear. Forget it, as everyone
else will."</p>

<p>"Do you think Wilbur Orchard will confess?"</p>

<p>"What if he does not?"</p>

<p>Inspector Richards entered the room rather hurriedly, and
walked across to Lily, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Let me be the first to congratulate you, Miss Dalton," he
said. "Wilbur Orchard has confessed not only the Carson Loan
Fraud, but that he placed those notes in your bag because he had
discovered you had knowledge that Carson had been repaid the loan
money."</p>

<p>"There's a third congratulation due, Richards," grinned the
investigator. "On the acquisition of a blunder-brained amateur
detective who cannot keep his wooden head out of trouble."</p>

<p>Richards looked puzzled for a moment. Then he grasped Rugh's
hand and shook it vigorously.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blessed. Rugh Thornton and the Tiger Lily. I beg
your pardon, Miss Dalton. The name slipped out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't." The air of lassitude had slipped from the
girl. "I am going to confess. I am proud of the name."</p>

<p>Richards turned to the other group to spread his good
news.</p>

<p>"The Tiger Lily," murmured Rugh softly, resuming his seat on
the arm of her chair. "My Tiger Lily."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can tame the Tiger Lily. Rugh?" asked the
girl, looking up into his eyes.</p>

<p>His arm around her shoulder tightened reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" The girl leaned forward for a minute and then
relaxed into his arms again. She caught his hand in hers. On his
palm lay a thin bladed knife, resembling an Italian stiletto.</p>

<p>Rugh looked round on the gay group the other side of the
room.</p>

<p>"I wish the world was one big lonely spot," he whispered
gently. Then bent to meet her lips.</p>
