<h1>Where the Lost Legions Go<br>
Mysteries that Will Never be Solved</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Aidan de Brune</h2>

<hr>

<h3>First published in <i>Smith's Weekly</i>, Sydney, NSW, 28
January 1928</h3>

<hr>

<p class="first">"HE left the house and..."</p>

<p>These words are often the prelude to one of those mysteries the
police departments of the States are coming to dread.</p>

<p>Where has he gone to? What were the reasons behind his action?
All efforts to probe his past&mdash;to discover some clue that will
place the trackers on his trail&mdash;fail.</p>

<p>How did he do it? In these days of the greatest freedom for the
individual it is remarkably easy to disappear.</p>

<p>"John Smith" kissed his wife and family and walked out of his
home. They watched him disappear round the corner and returned to
the house, prepared to welcome him at night.</p>

<p>But "John Smith" did not return. He did not take his usual
train, or tram, into the city. Instead, he walked to some line of
communications where he was unknown. Once in some strange city he
went to a big store where he was an unregarded purchasing unit.
There he purchased clothes varying considerably from his usual
tastes. With the change of clothing he changed his identity. He
became "Tom Brown."</p>

<p><br>
IN new clothes, bearing a new name, he assumed a new manner. "John
Smith" may have been studious, and retiring; "Tom Brown" sought the
high spots of the night life of his new city. His first object was
to establish a new history; perhaps also a new means of
livelihood.</p>

<p>Amid the unobservant masses of the city he was fairly safe, even
if he could not completely discard the many little mannerisms he
gathered in his former life, though these are danger-points likely
to betray him to a keen watcher who knew him in his "John Smith"
days.</p>

<p>Only occasionally man or woman seeks disguise as a member of the
opposite sex. The differences in outlines are so marked that
betrayal is almost certain. Briefly, a man is distinguished from a
woman because the many contour lines in the male are vertical, or
horizontal, while the corresponding lines in the female are
oblique. Thus, a man's neck back-line is straight and vertical
while a woman's shows a sweeping oblique curve. A man's lower jaw
is practically a right angle, while a woman's shows an open angle
with oblique lines from ear to chin.</p>

<p>In major outline a woman's body is built in the form of two
triangles, the bases resting on the hip-line. In the man the body
is enclosed in one elongated triangle the base line resting on the
shoulders. In movement, a woman swings her arms through a large
arc, especially in a backwards direction, the hand held palm facing
outwards. A man's arms swing little, except in fast walking, and
the palm inclines inwards.</p>

<p><br>
WHY do men and women disappear? There can be no doubt that a
majority of the disappearances are voluntary. A review of scores of
cases shows that a large proportion are persons regarded by their
acquaintances as unimaginative plodders. Can it be assumed that the
daily grind, the unadventurous, placid existence, suddenly palled?
Did a psychological reaction drive the victim out in search of a
dimly-visioned adventure? Was there some sudden awakening of a long
dormant subconsciousness inducing an unreasoned fear that the
long-worn groove was leading to mental stagnation&mdash;at the end,
the madhouse?</p>
