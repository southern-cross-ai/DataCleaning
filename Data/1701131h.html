<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">ROBERT HARDY dropped off the tram at the end of
Elizabeth Street and walked sharply up to the Detective Offices
at the corner of Hunter and Phillip Streets, Sydney. Passing the
Inquiry Office, he turned down a dark passage and halted outside
a door marked "Superintendent of Detectives." Listening a moment
he knocked and entered.</p>

<p>A heavily-built man with a strong, square face looked up and
nodded. Then he turned again to his task of signing a batch of
documents. This completed, he bunched the papers, and, placing
them in a wire basket, sat back and looked inquiringly at his
visitor. Without a word, Hardy passed a copy of the <i>Morning
Mirror</i> across the desk, and indicated a paragraph with a
heavy blue pencil mark.</p>

<p>"What's the joke, Dixon?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"That came into the office last night by the night roundsman.
If the chief sub. hadn't known that he was an unimaginative,
stolid reporter who couldn't fix a story on anything but a real
happening, it'd have been turned down.'</p>

<p>"And you saw the story in the paragraph, Hardy?" asked
Superintendent Dixon of the <i>Mirror's</i> star reporter,
smiling. "All I can see in it is one of the peculiar little
happenings that frequently amuse our Darlinghurst men."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be sitting in that chair if that is all you see
in that paragraph," answered Hardy. "But I suspect a lot. In my
office I have a map of Sydney, and I have marked a blue pencil
line around the Darlinghurst and Potts Point districts.
Somewhere within that area is a story I want."</p>

<p>"You want that story from me?" inquired the Superintendent
with a yawn.</p>

<p>"Wanting and getting are two different things," observed
Hardy. "I get from you just what I can pry out by having a
better knowledge of the story under discussion than the
D.O."</p>

<p>"You are at the beginning of wisdom," said Dixon gravely. "I
am going to have great hopes of you, Hardy."</p>

<p>"Good of you, but we'll can that stuff," retorted the
reporter. "Here's this yarn, with a story behind it. On the face
of it, it's more than queer&mdash;improbable, if you like."</p>

<p>He spread the newspaper on the desk and jabbed the paragraph
with a stubby forefinger.</p>

<p>"A woman walks into Darlinghurst Police Station last night,
about eight o'clock and tells the Sergeant in charge that there
have been mysterious happenings around her house during the past
week. When the Sergeant asks questions, she shuts up. Professes
she has nothing to say. All she wants is that the men on the
beat he required to move on anyone found loitering about the
vicinity of her house."</p>

<p>"Not much to worry the brains of the <i>Mirror</i> special
Investigator," the superintendent observed, smiling. At the same
time he keenly watched the younger man from beneath his heavy
brows.</p>

<p>"I got some more dope this morning," retorted Hardy quickly.
"Went to Darlinghurst and saw the register. The woman's name is
'Matthews.' She lives in a flat at Western Street, Darlinghurst.
Has three children, a girl about twenty years of age, named
Clarice. Nothing of a beauty, but said to be a clever
stenographer, employed at one of the big insurance offices."</p>

<p>"Exhibit B?" queried Dixon, quietly. "You're right as to
Exhibit A."</p>

<p>"Exhibit B is the limit," replied the newspaper man. "It is a
long, lean, scraggy youth, a year younger than the girl. Runs
with one of the gun gangs at Darlinghurst. Never been in the
hands of the police, but owes that to the fact that his mother
has a small private income, sufficient to keep the wolf from the
door. Name 'Bill' or 'William,' if you want to be virtuous with
your English. Disappeared lately, after some dispute with the
members of the push he favours."</p>

<p>"Again I must express my admiration for your industry,"
murmured Dixon. "Let me see, it is not quite half-past ten in
the morning and you appear to have the history of three quarters
of this interesting family."</p>

<p>"I'm going to the other quarter," Hardy smiled. "Exhibit C is
somewhat on a pattern with Exhibit B. Knocks about the city a
bit here and there. Something of a pimp for politicians; bit of
a small town politician himself; gets in where he can and
somehow appears to turn in a bit of dough, at times."</p>

<p>"When I have a spare half-hour, I must certainly call at the
<i>Mirror</i> Office and congratulate Mr. Thomas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't," interrupted Hardy, with a grin. "Might put the
Chief in mind that there <i>is</i> a Police Department in Sydney. He is fond of leaders on The Grossly Inept Methods of&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dixon threw up his hands with a gesture of surrender.</p>

<p>"I give in," he exclaimed. "I have a great admiration for
your respected Chief, but when he gets the grouch on the best
police force in the world, I absolutely come to loathe him."</p>

<p>"Now that you have had your breakfast of good red herrings,"
observed Hardy. "We'll get back to the story."</p>

<p>"Can you continue it in your next?" asked the superintendent,
gravely.</p>

<p>"No necessity." Hardy drew a notebook from his pocket and
placed it on the table. "The lady is fond of
talking&mdash;except, apparently, to the police. She told a
neighbour all about it, just before she went down to the police
station."</p>

<p>"The next Superintendent of Detectives should certainly be
journalistically trained," observed Dixon, to space.</p>

<p>"Won't hurt him," grunted Hardy. "Here it is. Just after dark
on the night in question, someone rang the Matthews' electric
bell. When Mrs. Matthews answered the door a man inquired for
'Bill'. Mrs. Matthews answered she believed her son and heir had
taken a trip to Melbourne. The visitor was hard to convince, but
ultimately accepted the statement. An hour afterwards Clarice
Matthews was called to the door by a ring, and another man
inquired for brother Bill. The same answer was returned and he
left."</p>

<p>"There should be at least a column spread in that," said the
superintendent, mildly. "You certainly have worked to some
purpose, Bob."</p>

<p>"Let me finish. An hour later, Albert&mdash;that's Exhibit
C&mdash;came home. He said that he had been stopped by two men
who wanted to know where Bill was. He had replied that, so far
as he knew, Bill was in Melbourne. The men then wanted to come
in with him and search Bill's room, claiming that he had some
stuff belonging to them. Albert disagreed with the plan, and
manage to get home, very shaken in nerves. A few minutes later a
shot was fired at the house, breaking one of the windows, and
embedding itself in the ceiling."</p>

<p>The superintendent sat upright, quickly.</p>

<p>"Are you going to use that, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I think I shall have to have that conversation with Mr.
Thomas."</p>

<p>"He will tell you to go to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He will be rude, certainly. But then, he has some common
sense, a form of grey matter that appears to be
lacking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;in his subordinates," finished Hardy, with a broad
grin. "Still, a promise to let a subordinate named Hardy in on
the ground floor of the game, might take the place of the
lacking grey matter."</p>

<p>"I understand." Superintendent Dixon sat back in his chair
and nibbled at the end of his pencil. "The trouble in making
such a deal is that I have nothing to offer in return."</p>

<p>"In that case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Bob." The superintendent leaned forward and
pointed his pencil at the journalist. "The truth is, that you
have given me information that has not yet come into this
office. When I had the report from Darlinghurst this morning, I
sent a couple of men out to make inquiries. They have not yet
reported. Another time, boy, make your bargain before you give
your information away."</p>

<p>"All right, superintendent." Hardy rose from his chair,
abruptly, and walked to the door. "It'll make a nice front-page
story, as it stands."</p>

<br>

<p>"If your editor will publish it. I fear I shall have to call
him on the phone, as I am too busy to go round to-day."</p>

<p>Hardy came to a sudden halt. He was well aware that his
newspaper was, at the time, at peace with the Detective Offices.
In these circumstances, his editor would think twice before
publishing any story the superintendent placed a veto on.
Superintendent Dixon watched Hardy's face with interest. For a
moment the journalist remained with the handle of the door in
his hand. Then, he turned and walked back to his chair.</p>

<p>"I should bring the goods to you and that you would deal
straight."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to play otherwise, boy," replied Dixon with a
smile. "What you published last night didn't matter. More than
probable your man got it from the sergeant at the desk. What you
tell me this morning places a different complexion on the
matter."</p>

<p>"You think there is a big story behind this?" asked Hardy,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"There is something worth inquiring into," said the
superintendent cautiously. "You shall have the story, boy. But,
you will have to wait for it."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Hardy, after a moment's thought.
"I'll see the chief and get him to let me go after it."</p>

<p>"That will suit me, Bob," answered the superintendent; "Of
course the old agreement stands. Bring what you get to me and
I'll see you get first talk for publication."</p>

<p>Outside the Detective Offices Hardy stood for some minutes
undecided as to his next course of action. He had six hours
before he could hope to see Alphonzo Thomas, the Editor of the
<i>Mirror</i>. True, he could have found the day editor in his
room, but he was convinced the story he had to tell was of such
importance that only the chief could deal with it.</p>

<p>As he was turning away from the building, a man touched him
on the shoulder. "Looking for a story, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Have you anything, Frost?" asked Hardy, eagerly, recognising
in the speaker one of the headquarters' detective-inspectors.</p>

<p>"Doing anything?" asked Frost.</p>

<p>"Nothing that will not keep," replied the journalist,
truthfully.</p>

<p>"Wait for me, then," said the Inspector, turning to ascend
the steps. "There's something happened out at the Point you may
get a story out of."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">INSPECTOR FROST did not remain in Police
Headquarters many minutes. On rejoining Hardy he suggested an
adjournment to the nearest café.</p>

<p>"A man was found in Darlinghurst Road this morning, in an
unconscious condition," he commenced by way of a preface.</p>

<p>"Nothing unusual for that particular part of Sydney,"
observed Hardy. "I understand police records state there are
more sly-grog shops in Darlinghurst than in all the other
districts of Sydney combined."</p>

<p>The Inspector took no notice of the newspaper man's remarks.
From an inner pocket he produced a few papers and laid them on
the marble-topped table.</p>

<p>"There are one or two things about this case that may
interest you, Hardy," continued Frost. "There was little on the
man. To be exact, four shillings in silver and three pennies. A
two-bladed knife showing signs of hard usage. A cheap watch and
silver chain, both well worn. Two pieces of string, one of them
tied with several peculiar knots, and one letter."</p>

<p>"Where is the man?" asked Hardy.</p>

<p>"At the Sydney Hospital," replied the Inspector; "He has not
recovered consciousness and the doctors do not seem to know what
is the matter with him. At all events, they won't tell, if they
do know."</p>

<p>"Anything strange about his clothing?" asked the
journalist.</p>

<p>"A cheap blue suit, well worn, made by Dent and Sons, a soft
hat, with the maker's name torn out. Striped shirt, low, turned
down collar and black knotted tie. Brown shoes, well worn at the
heels, and showing signs of having been half-soled several
times, laces broken and joined, one mended with a piece of
string. Undergarments cheap and almost in rags."</p>

<p>"Any body marks?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. A few moles and minor scars but nothing
distinctive. I had finger prints taken and submitted to the
office. Was just going to see if they had produced results when
I met you. They know nothing of him, so he's never been through
our hands."</p>

<p>"Then, he is nothing but one of the usual finds. Appears to
me, Frost, you are trying to make a lot out of one of the common
incidents of police work. Do you mean to tell me that this is
the first man in a state of unconsciousness the police of Sydney
have found?"</p>

<p>"There jumps the journalist to unconsidered conclusions,"
retorted the Inspector. "There is one uncommon matter and I have
refrained from mentioning it so far. In fact, there are two
uncommon features in the case."</p>

<p>"One at a time, please."</p>

<p>"First, the man was unconscious. That, itself is not unusual,
but it is remarkable that the doctor at the hospital does not
seem to be able to give an explanation for his condition."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"The second is this letter." The Inspector drew an envelope
from his pocket, and, extracting a piece of paper, passed the
envelope over to Hardy. It was a common, commercial envelope,
with the address written in pencil thereon. It was addressed to
"Mr. Carl Humberson, 133 Cascade Street. Darlinghurst."</p>

<p>"I presume you suggest that Mr. Carl Humberson does not live
at that address," remarked Hardy.</p>

<p>"I had the pleasure of interviewing Mr. Carl Humberson,"
replied the detective. "He was good enough to prove,
conclusively, that he had never received the letter. Certainly,
his appearance is totally different from the man we found."</p>

<p>"What of the contents?" asked Hardy stretching his hand
across the table. Frost gave him a half-sheet of note paper,
badly torn, and containing the lower portion of a letter. It
read:&mdash;</p><br>

<p class="letter">...that when you receive this, my patience is
at an end. I have tried to do my best for you, but you are not
only disobedient but have placed me in great danger by your
reckless disregard of my instructions. You must be aware of the
penalty you are incurring by this behaviour. I have warned you
before and again tell you, that my patience is exhausted. In
three days you will meet your punishment&mdash;the punishment I
have meted out to others you know of.</p>

<p class="letter">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.
Night</span>.</p>

<p><br> "Dr. Night" Hardy looked across at the Inspector, "I
have never heard of this man. Have you looked him up,
Frost?"</p>

<p>"There is no person of that name on the British Medical
Association's register," stated the Inspector positively. "There
is not a Dr. Night known to any religion, medical or scientific
association or society in Australia, nor, so far as I can
discover, in the world."</p>

<p>"That seems pretty conclusive," laughed the journalist. "The
question seems to be: who, and what, is Dr. Night?"</p>

<p>"And, when we have answered that question I want to know what
powers he possesses to punish his enemies to the very date, and
apparently from a distance."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>The Inspector picked up the envelope and pointed to some
faint pencil marks at one corner. They indicated a date three
days previous.</p>

<p>"Dr. Night appears to be a very interesting gentleman,"
observed Hardy. "Anyone would be interesting who could produce a
state of coma that is unrecognisable by the medical profession
and also produce that coma from a distance; for I suppose we may
presume that Mr. Carl Humberson had, after receiving that
letter, conceived a strong distaste for the worthy doctor's
company."</p>

<p>"That is your opinion, eh?" asked Frost.</p>

<p>"It is yours too," challenged Hardy. "Now, tell me what you
want me to do. Publish this?"</p>

<p>He indicated the letter on the table. "It will make a fair
story, but not so good as the one I took to Dixon this morning,
and got wrecked."</p>

<p>Frost was inquisitive and Hardy recounted the Matthews story,
very much as he had told to Superintendent Dixon.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there is any connection?" mused Frost.</p>

<p>"Improbable, I should think. The only connecting link I can
find is that the two matters occurred within the danger
zone."</p>

<p>Frost laughed at Hardy's remark. It was a time worn joke that
Hardy attributed all the ills from which Sydney suffered to the
Darlinghurst area.</p>

<p>"You may laugh as you will," retorted the journalist,
carelessly. "One of these days you will find that only a spring
cleaning in Darlinghurst will prevent a wave of crime sweeping
Sydney, as it has lately swept Melbourne."</p>

<p>Hardy look a careful copy of the letter and envelope and went
down to the <i>Mirror</i> Office. There he had a long interview
with the day editor and then out to lunch. On returning to the
newspaper offices he found a message waiting for him, to ring up
Inspector Frost, at the Detective offices.</p>

<p>Obtaining the connection he had to wait some time as the
detective was engaged with the Commissioner of Police. At last
Frost rang up the newspaper.</p>

<p>"He's dead," announced Frost briefly, immediately he heard
the journalist's voice.</p>

<p>"Have the doctors learned anything more?" asked Hardy.</p>

<p>"If they have, they're darned close about it," replied the
Inspector. "Anyway you can write it down as 'murder.'"</p>

<p>"Murder?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing." Frost's voice sounded puzzled over the phone.
"There's not a scratch or bruise on him, and so far as the
doctors can tell there's no sign of poison. Yet, I'll stake my
life that someone hangs for it."</p>

<p>When he had handed in his copy, Hardy walked up to Elizabeth
Street and caught a Darlinghurst tram. A call at the Police
Station resulted in the information that Mrs. Matthews was still
disinclined to talk. The journalist then turned back towards the
city and called on police headquarters. Superintendent Dixon and
Inspector Frost were both out, and the office men had but a
general knowledge of the two happenings.</p>

<p>The journalist then went to the city mortuary and was allowed
to view the dead body.</p>

<p>For some time he examined the corpse, closely, but could find
no clue of consequence. There was some trouble in obtaining
permission to view the dead man's clothing, but, at length, they
were produced. Inch by inch, the journalist went over the well-worn
garments. The suit was badly crumpled and very dirty. The
underclothing was soiled and ragged. The hat was broken and
discoloured.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">THE quest appeared hopeless, yet Hardy
persevered. He was relying on a peculiar instinct that seemed to
lead him on. So far as he could see the clothing contained no
clue to the mysterious death or the owner. Again and again, with
a patience almost hopeless, he held up for inspection the
various articles.</p>

<a id="pic3"></a><br>

<br>

<p>Then, as he dropped the trousers carelessly on the table he
found his first clue. The trousers were cuffed, and as they
fell, a few grains of white powder sifted from the fold. Waiting
until the attendant had wandered to another part of the room.
Hardy cut the stitching and turned down the cloth. There lay a
few grains of white powder. The journalist sifted them into an
old envelope.</p>

<p>The second leg of the garment yielded a few more grains and
it small piece of glass. Pocketing his find, Hardy left the
mortuary and went down to the newspaper offices. Mr. Thomas had
just arrived and the star man sought an immediate interview.</p>

<p>Alphonzo Thomas managing editor of the <i>Morning Mirror</i>
was a short, fair man, partially bald, but wearing, with evident
pride, a large light-brown moustache which he continually pulled
when excited or disturbed. Hardy placed the two cases he had
investigated before his editor.</p>

<p>To the journalist, the mystery of Mrs. Matthews and her
family and informal callers appeared the most intriguing. The
dead man at the Sydney morgue might yield a story, possibly a
good one, when the identity of Dr. Night was discovered.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour the two men discussed the stories, and
finally Alphonse Thomas resolved that, while neither story
warranted the journalist devoting the whole of his time to it,
he should for the next few days, hold a roving commission on the
two. This arrangement suited Hardy. Somewhere in the two
mysteries lay a good story.</p>

<p>As Hardy was leaving the room, his telephone bell rang.
Thomas picked up the receiver and then called to Hardy. "Phone
for you, Rob. Switched through to here, as it was said to be a
hurry call."</p>

<p>The young man took the receiver. "Hullo! Hardy, of the
<i>Mirror</i>, speaking."</p>

<p>"Robert Hardy, of the <i>Morning Mirror</i>?" queried a very
precise male voice. "I believe, Mr. Hardy, that you are
investigating the case of the man found unconscious in
Darlinghurst Road, last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Who's speaking? What do you know?"</p>

<p>"I will answer your last question first. Mr. Hardy. I know a
great deal of the matter. I am of the opinion you have
undertaken an investigation beyond your capabilities."</p>

<p>"Really?" All Hardy's fighting instincts were aroused at the
remark. "May I ask the name of my critic?"</p>

<p>"Before I say more," replied the man. "I would like to offer
you a word of warning. I believe you found a piece of a letter
enclosed in an envelope in the pocket of the unconscious man. Is
that not so?"</p>

<p>"The police found a letter in the pocket of the man," replied
the journalist, resisting an impulse to hang up the receiver.
"You are in error in referring to the 'unconscious man.' He is
dead."</p>

<p>"I regret the mistake, Mr. Hardy, I should have spoken of the
dead man. May I inquire the time of his death?"</p>

<p>"About noon to-day. The detective in charge of the case will
no doubt give you the exact time. Now, may I again ask your
name, and where I can see you? From your remarks you appear to
possess a lot of interesting information about this dead
man."</p>

<p>"Dear me." The tone was quite regretful. "The drug should
have worked earlier. I calculated that he would die not later
than six o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you? Haven't you got a name?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Hardy. I should have given you my
name at the commencement of the conversation. It was pure
forgetfulness on my part. Now, let me warn you to keep out of
the affair, if you value your&mdash;er&mdash;health. I cannot
have impertinent newspaper men interfering in my affairs. My
name is Dr. Night."</p>

<p>Then came the sharp click of the receiver being hung on the
hook. For a moment Hardy stood, staring, at the instrument
before him. Then he seized the lever and jerked it
viciously.</p>

<p>"Switch speaking," came the calm voice of the <i>Mirror's</i>
operator.</p>

<p>"Find out the number and place of the person who has just
been speaking to me. Hurry up; it's urgent!"</p>

<p>Hardy turned to face his chief. Mr. Thomas was sealed well
back in his chair, calmly watching the excited journalist.</p>

<p>"Do you know who that was?" exclaimed Hardy. "That was Dr.
Night, and he had the infernal check to tell me to keep off the
Darlinghurst Road case."</p>

<p>If the journalist had expected sympathy or amazement from the
<i>Mirror's</i> editor, he was mistaken. Thomas grinned broadly
at the excited man for a moment, and then turned to his
desk.</p>

<p>"Well, get him, Hardy. It's your job."</p>

<p>Hardy knew his editor well enough to realise that in those
few words lay his course of action. Thomas was leaving the hunt
for Dr. Night in his hands. He would be able to call for all the
help he wanted, but above all, it was up to him to "get him" or
give a very complete and satisfactory explanation for a
failure.</p>

<p>For the next half-hour the journalist sat at the end of the
telephone line. From exchange he received the information that
the call had been put through from a public booth, He had
expected that. Dr. Night would never have been foolish enough to
use an instrument through which he might be traced. Getting
through to the Superintendent of the city exchange, Hardy
requested that every departmental effort should be made to trace
the call and the caller. Then he rang police headquarters to
find that Superintendent Dixon and Inspector Frost had left for
the night.</p>

<p>The desk man, once assured of the urgency of the business,
promised to get in touch with Inspector Frost and ask him to
telephone Mr. Thomas. Outside the <i>Mirror</i> offices Hardy
jumped into a taxi and went down to the city exchange. There the
night superintendent was awaiting him with the Information that
the call had originated through the William Street exchange.</p>

<p>Hearing a message for the Inspector the journalist drove down
to William Street. Here he was informed that the call had been
booked at 7.25 p.m., and originated at a public call box
attached to the Oxford Street post office. Busy as the last hour
had been, Hardy had constructed a mental picture of the mysterious
Dr. Night.</p>

<p>A man who spoke so precisely would certainly be precise in
his dress. Following a sub-conscious line of reasoning the
journalist constructed a man of middle height, pale, aesthetic
features, grey hair and eyebrows, and, being an indoor man,
wearing a dark overcoat and hat, probably grey.</p>

<p>Had he been asked why he pictured Dr. Night in this manner,
the journalist could not have given a satisfactory reply.</p>

<p>The picture had come into his mind during the brief telephone
communication. Dr. Night was a "grey" man, and although Hardy
laughed at himself for the thought, the greyness persisted.</p>

<p>Arriving at Oxford Street post office, Hardy found it closed
for the night. The three telephone booths stood empty and dark,
and the few loungers about could not remember any person
answering to the description the journalist had constructed for
Dr. Night.</p>

<p>Several of the surrounding shops were open and Hardy started
a systematic inquiry of the attendants and customers, but with
no success. Many persons, said to have been seen using the
telephone booth, were carefully described by people questioned,
but in no one case did the description appear to warrant
investigation.</p>

<p>Hardy was almost discouraged when the Inspector arrived,
somewhat excited, at the prospect of getting on the trail of the
one man who appeared to be able to explain the death of the
mystery man of Darlinghurst Road. The journalist explained the
steps he had taken to trace the telephone message, and then
spoke of the mental picture he had drawn of Dr. Night. As he had
expected, the detective laughed heartily at the idea.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">"NOTHING to do here," grumbled Frost, after he
had sharply questioned one or two of the loungers about the Post
Office corner. "We'll get up to the station and see if they have
anything new on the two affairs to report."</p>

<p>At the Police Station the Sergeant in charge could tell them
nothing new on the matters of Mrs. Matthews and the mystery man
of Darlinghurst Road. They stood talking to him for some
time.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to leave, the constable who had been
relieved from duty in Oxford St. walked in.</p>

<p>"Seen a man, this evening in Oxford Street between seven
o'clock and a quarter to eight, near the Post Office?" asked
Frost, with a wink at the man at the desk. "Middle height, very
grey, thin features, greyish skin, looked like a doctor or a
university professor. Wore a dark overcoat and a dark hat,
constable?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the man, promptly. "Soon after seven
o'clock a man answering to that description crossed Oxford
Street at the Crown Street intersection. Appeared somewhat
absent-minded. Nearly run over by one of them buses."</p>

<p>"What?" shouted the Inspector, staring at the man in
amazement, with a puzzled glance at the Sergeant.</p>

<p>"Come from up near the old gaol. Saw him under a light
standard. Heavy, grey eyebrows and sort of peculiar eyes. Seemed
to look through you, he did. Is he wanted, sir?"</p>

<p>Frost hung on to the desk, a bewildered look in his eyes. The
sergeant was looking at the constable as if he had never seen
him before. Hardy felt a glow of satisfaction at the useful work
his 'hunch' had put in, but was very puzzled at the outcome.</p>

<p>"You've broke it this time, man," gasped Frost at length.
"Want him? I'd have given a year's seniority to have been
alongside you. That was Dr. Night."</p>

<p>"Dr. who, sir," asked the bewildered constable. "There's
nothing on the book about him, sir."</p>

<p>"There will be to-morrow, constable," answered Frost grimly.
"I want a talk with that bird and I want it badly. You're the
only one of us who has seen him. If you can pick him up it'll
be as good as a stripe to you."</p>

<p>For a full half-hour Frost questioned the constable and Hardy
as to the personality of the man seen in Oxford Street, and the
voice on the telephone. At the end of the time he had a fairly
accurate description of the person supposed to be Dr. Night.
This was immediately placed on the book and telephoned to all
the police stations around Sydney. The person described was to
be detained until Frost had had an opportunity of questioning
him.</p>

<p>"Suppose I am going a bit far," commented the Inspector, as
he and the journalist left the police station. "But you've given
me a jolt this evening, Bob. Lord, you're lost in a newspaper
office if you can't see a man at the other end of a telephone
line."</p>

<p>"It may not be Dr. Night," said Hardy thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It may not, and it may be," retorted Frost. "I'm not taking
chances. I want a word with that bird&mdash;and I want it
bad."</p>

<p>For some minutes Frost strode down Oxford Street, in silence.
At the junction with Liverpool Street he halted.</p>

<p>"There's nothing more we can do to-night," he said slowly.
"I'm getting home, Bob. Suppose you'll do the same. You've done
a good day's work, my boy, and you've given at least one member
of the New South Wales police department a bigger jolt than
half-a-dozen questions in Parliament could have done."</p>

<p>Hardy had stepped off the pavement to board a Circular Quay
tram when the detective called him back.</p>

<p>"By the way, Bob. You're sitting on the inside of this game.
Mind your steps in that paper of yours. I know you like
sensation and the way things are moving it looks as if you'll
get plenty. Don't spoil things by too much talk at the moment.
There's a right time to open out, you know."</p>

<p>Nodding assent, Hardy swung on to the tram and went down to
the <i>Mirror</i> Office to report. There he found that orders
had been left on the board for him to report direct to the
editor.</p>

<p>Thomas looked up expectantly as Hardy entered his room. In a
few words the journalist reviewed the night's happenings, and
finished with Frost's warning against premature publication of
the story. Thomas frowned at the warning and sat for some
moments tugging at his moustache.</p>

<p>"Suppose we'll have to let the gist of the story pass to-night."
he said, at length. "I don't want to get upsides with
the police at present. It's a good story, Hardy, and you appear
to be on the inside running. Yes, it'll keep. You'd better sign
off now. You're on this story until I call you off."</p>

<p>The managing editor turned to his work. Hardy sat quiet. In a
minute Thomas looked up, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Until the story is cleared up?" asked Hardy stolidly.</p>

<p>"Of course!" Thomas spoke impatiently. "I'm not likely to
take you off anything as good as this looks. Good night,
lad."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">HARDY searched the next morning's newspapers
eagerly. Only the <i>Mirror</i> contained a "starred story" of
the mystery man of Darlinghurst Road. The journalist's story of
the torn letter from Dr. Night was a scoop.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the newspaper office he found a note from
Thomas in the rack asking him to bring Inspector Frost to the
editor's room that afternoon at one o'clock. A scribbled
postscript wished the journalist luck on the day's hunting, and
instructed him to place his copy in the editor's "private copy"
basket.</p>

<p>The newspaperman was somewhat of a loss how to proceed on the
double inquiry. Mrs. Matthews was, for some reason, disinclined
to give any further reason for her complaints to the police: the
search for the "grey" man would now he taken in hand seriously
by the police.</p>

<p>One point remained; the little packet of white powder and
broken glass he had taken from the cuffs of the dead man's
trousers.</p>

<p>Leaving the newspaper office, Hardy walked down to the corner
of Pitt and King Streets, and entered the chemists shop of
Masters Bros. &amp; Co.</p>

<p>A tall, thin man, with a worn, clean shaven face, came from
behind the prescription desk to meet him.</p>

<p>"Bad nights, again?" asked Hardy, with a rapid glance at his
friend's face. "Neuritis will kill you, Ted."</p>

<p>"It's hell," answered Ted Chaffers, the manager of the shop.
"Enough to drive one to drink or drugs."</p>

<p>"It's the latter I've come to see you about," remarked the
newspaper man, casually.</p>

<p>"Lord, man! You've never taken to the dope?" asked Chaffers,
with real concern in his voice.</p>

<p>"Not yet," answered Hardy, with a quiet smile. "One never
knows what's in store for a newspaperman. Some of our
assignments are enough to drive anyone to it. Have it look at
this and tell me what you make of it."</p>

<p>Ted Chaffers took the packet behind the desk. In a couple of
minutes he returned, the paper open in his hand.</p>

<p>"Dope, Bob. Where did you get it? There's a lot of dirt and
fluff mixed up with it. More of your mystery work?"</p>

<p>"You've hit it, Ted. That stuff came out of the cuffs of the
trousers of the man found dying in Darlinghurst Road. Of course,
this is confidential. I'm telling you so that you may be able to
identify it, if necessary."</p>

<p>"Then the man was a cocaine addict," answered Chaffers,
positively. "This is not the stuff you get at a reputable
chemist. It's full of fake, but there's enough 'snow' there to
satisfy an addict."</p>

<p>"What about the piece of glass?" asked Hardy, picking up the
fragment from the paper.</p>

<p>"Looks like a piece of one of the tubes this stuff is sold
in," replied the chemist after a moment's examination. "I had a
tube of the stuff in my hands the other day. Man brought it in
and wanted to sell it. I told him I would have nothing to do
with the muck. It's not only impure, but it's dangerous to have
on the premises. Yes, I'll swear this piece of glass came from a
similar bottle."</p>

<p>The journalist had expected information of this nature.</p>

<p>Leaving the shop he walked up to the Sydney Hospital. There
he asked to see Dr. Streatham, the medical superintendent.</p>

<p>"Another mystery story?" grinned the doctor, when Hardy was
admitted to his room. "Perhaps I can guess. The <i>Mirror</i>
made a sensation of the story of the man picked up in
Darlinghurst Road the night before last. Guess that's your
business, Bob."</p>

<p>"I shall have to recommend you for a job at the Detective
Office," drawled Hardy. "You doctors would make great
investigators."</p>

<p>"We are investigators," replied the doctor, seriously. "We
investigate humans when they are brought to us by disease,
accident and death. I've never yet had the opportunity to
investigate the brain of a newspaperman, but there's still time.
It will be an interesting study."</p>

<p>"Not for the newspaper man," grinned Hardy. "Your guess
counts one to you. I'm on the Darlinghurst Road mystery. Now
I'll have my guess. That man was a cocaine addict?"</p>

<p>"Good man. Where did you get it? I was going to ring up Frost
and tell him that, among other things. Wondered why he never
asked the question of me when he was here yesterday."</p>

<p>Hardy produced the packet of cocaine and dirt, and handed it
to the doctor. "I got that out of the cuffs of the dead man's
trousers," he explained. "Another little point against friend
Frost, eh?"</p>

<p>The medical superintendent sifted the mixture about on the
paper.</p>

<p>"Cocaine of a poor quality, much diluted with some foreign
matter. I'll have to make a record of this, Hardy. In future,
when a mystery man is brought into the hospital, I will have the
cuffs of his trousers turned out, as well as his pockets."</p>

<p>"What of the glass, doctor?"</p>

<p>Dr. Streatham left the room to return shortly, holding a thin
glass tube about two inches long and half an inch in diameter.
"There's the whole article," he said, handing the tube to the
journalist. "I got it off one of my patients about a mouth ago.
There's cocaine in it&mdash;the stuff the runners sell."</p>

<p>Hardy held out his hand for the packet of dirt and cocaine
the doctor had continued to hold, but Dr. Streatham shook his
head.</p>

<p>"You'd better let me retain this, Bob," he said,
significantly. "Strictly speaking, it belongs to the Crown and
there might be awkward questions asked if it became known that
you had it. I shall hand it to Frost the next time he comes to
see me&mdash;that is, after I have made an analysis of the
stuff. There may be something in this mixture that may lead to a
determination of the cause of the man's death."</p>

<p>"Good enough, doctor. I shall expect you to let me have a
copy of your notes on the analysis after you have informed the
police."</p>

<p>Leaving the hospital the journalist went down to the
Detective Office. Superintendent Dixon was not in his room, and
Inspector Frost was engaged with the Commissioner. After a wait
of quarter of an hour, the Inspector came down the stairs and
joined the journalist. Hardy gave him Thomas's message, and the
detective promised to be at the <i>Mirror</i> offices at the
time stated.</p>

<p>"I've been handed the Matthews matter to look into," remarked
Frost at length, "You're interested in that, too? Brought the
dope to the Superintendent, I'm told. Got a twist on it
yet?"</p>

<p>"Only a 'hunch'," answered Hardy. "There's no ground for the
'hunch' so far as I can see. Yet I'm willing to stake a good bit
on it."</p>

<p>"Go to it, Bob," laughed the Inspector. "After your guess at
Dr. Night yesterday, this office is willing to carefully
consider your 'hunches.' I haven't recovered from the shock,
yet."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Matthews and the mystery man are linked together in my
mind."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;by Jove, Bob! I believe you've hit on something. I
have some information that seems to bear out your theory."</p>

<p>"Police secrets, or share?" inquired Hardy. "I've some
information, too. A little matter the police, in the person of
Inspector Frost, appear to have overlooked."</p>

<p>"I'll risk it," grinned the detective. "Appears to me that
you, and the police are fifty-fifty on this game. We'll sit it
over a cup of coffee." A few minutes later the two men entered a
café and sealed themselves at a marble-topped table in a vacant
corner.</p>

<p>"You blow first?" asked Frost.</p>

<p>"Don't mind. My 'hunch' is that we are in on a dope story.
Yesterday I went down to the morgue to see the corpse. Fiddling
about with the poor devil's clothing, I found cocaine in the
cuffs of the trousers."</p>

<p>"Of all the&mdash;" Frost's face fell. "I missed a bet there.
Got the stuff?"</p>

<p>"You can get it from Dr. Streatham, at the Sydney Hospital,"
replied Hardy. "He is making an analysis of the dirt. Says he
will have it ready in a couple of days."</p>

<p>"Good move, Bob. Anything more?"</p>

<p>"A point I let slip, yesterday," confessed the journalist.
"When I found the dirt from the cuff contained cocaine, I
remembered a peculiar look in Mrs. Matthews' eyes. I am willing
to stake that she is a cocaine addict, also. That's all there is
in my packet, Frost."</p>

<p>"Not bad, Bob. As to Mrs. Matthews, I'd say that you were
right. I had a talk to her this morning and noticed the same
thing. But beyond that, I've got certain proof that we are
correct in our surmise."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>"You know that she has three children. Seen them, Bob?"</p>

<p>"No. Guess they're on the same wicket, from what you
say."</p>

<p>"They are. All three of them have the same look. To test the
matter I've gone into the history of the family. Not much
results yet, but enough to lead to a pretty story. You know of
the elder boy?"</p>

<p>"Exhibit B?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The chief said that you had named him that. Well,
Exhibit B, otherwise William Matthews, has disappeared."</p>

<p>"But William Matthews and the mystery man of Darlinghurst
Road are not one and the same person," objected Hardy. "The
mystery man is not a day under thirty-five and William Matthews
is only about nineteen."</p>

<p>"There you slip," laughed Frost. "I have not tried to make
out the two are identical. All that I have stated is that
William Matthews has bolted."</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>"Again you beat me." Frost spread out his hands in a
deprecating manner. "William Matthews is not the mystery man.
But William Matthews has a history, and that history appears to
link him up with the mystery man, if what you say about him is
correct."</p>

<p>"I've had two experts on the dirt and they both say cocaine,"
stated Hardy. "I'll take their word for it."</p>

<a id="pic4"></a><br>

<div align="center">
<img src="1701131h-images/DrNight-04.png"

</div>
<br>

<p>"Then here's William Matthews story," answered Frost. "He's
been running dope between the importers and the salesmen.
Collects the stuff, heaven knows where, and hands it over for
the price agreed upon. Last lot, he made a bad break. Suppose he
thought he was not getting enough out of it, so emptied out the
tubes of dope and filled them up with a mixture of borax and
sugar."</p>

<p>"Sweet youth!" murmured Hardy.</p>

<p>"Humph! The runners didn't think so. They found out the
exchange and called on Matthews to hand over the goods. William
wouldn't, or couldn't. The gang got nasty. William did a bolt
and left his family to face the music. Gang went to the house
and demanded William. He had disappeared, so they, tried to
force the mother and children to come across. They wouldn't or
couldn't. So the gang tried shooting."</p>

<p>"A fair explanation," observed Hardy. "How do you connect the
mystery man?"</p>

<p>"My guess is that he is either one of his runners that
Matthews served or he got wise as to who were the importers and
tried to hold them up for the stuff."</p>

<p>"I think we'll say 'importers,'" suggested Hardy, with a
smile of knowledge.</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Frost.</p>

<p>The journalist drew a copy of that day's <i>Mirror</i> from
his pocket and pointed to the 'star' article on the front
page.</p>

<p>"Dr. Night," he quietly answered.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">"I WANT to know why this man, Dr. Night,
telephoned to Bob Hardy last night," asked Alphonzo Thomas. For
over an hour Inspector Frost and Bob Hardy had sat in
consultation with the managing editor of the <i>Mirror</i>. The
two investigators had spoken at length on the parts of the quest
they had dealt with, the sharp-witted editor of Sydney's leading
morning newspaper questioning and probing.</p>

<p>Quite early in the conference it had been decided that the
mystery man of Darlinghurst Road was linked in some manner with
Mrs. Matthews and her family and that, for the sake of
convenience, the two stories could he dealt with as one.</p>

<p>Then Alphonzo Thomas had voiced the one question that had
been in the minds of all three men from the beginning of the
conversation.</p>

<p>"Dr. Night was betrayed by the letter in the pocket of the
dead man," Hardy reminded his chief.</p>

<p>"That letter did not contain a distinct threat to murder,"
objected Thomas. "Had not Dr. Night betrayed himself by
telephoning direct to Hardy, it would not have been difficult to
link him up with this affair."</p>

<p>"He may have thought otherwise," observed Frost. "It is well
known that criminals make the most simple mistakes. We police
would not have a show against them, otherwise."</p>

<p>"I am in doubt as to the 'simple' mistake, Frost," said
Thomas sharply. "Take the case at your valuation. Dr. Night
learns by some means that you have discovered this letter or
part of a letter, on his person of the man he killed. In a fit
of nerves, he telephones a threat to Hardy to try to prevent him
investigating and publishing the story. Why telephone to Hardy?
Why not telephone to you and warn you to drop the matter?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid he would have wasted the call fee, had he done
so," laughed the detective.</p>

<p>"Why not think the same in reference to Hardy?" continued
Thomas, "The <i>Mirror</i> men have a reputation for getting
what they go after. Hardy has been in a few tight corners when
engaged on investigations, but I have yet to observe signs of
loss of nerve."</p>

<p>"Hardy had a lot of luck at the jump-off," admitted the
detective. "I'm saying nothing against his work, but he got on
the trail in a manner likely to induce a fit of nerves in any
criminal."</p>

<p>"In that case, why did Dr. Night not only issue a warning,
but convey to Hardy the definite information that he committed
the murder. Further, he informed Hardy that the drug should have
proved fatal at a certain time. In that case, there is a
definite clue to the murderer."</p>

<p>"A small one, I'm afraid," interjected Hardy. "I asked Dr.
Streatham if he knew of a drug that would kill without a sign at
a definite time, between six and ten hours after it was
administered and, as well, produce a state of coma between the
time of its administration and death."</p>

<p>"What was his reply?" asked the detective inquisitively.</p>

<p>"He laughed," Hardy grinned broadly, as he answered.</p>

<p>"I consider that telephone message a challenge to the
<i>Mirror</i>, and I am going to accept it as one," continued
Thomas definitely. "Hardy, will you write your story from that
point of view? Dr. Night has challenged the <i>Mirror</i> to
keep out of the investigation, or to take the consequences. My
answer is that the <i>Mirror</i> will hunt this man down until
his history and deeds are laid bare to the public eye. Get that,
Hardy? Good! You will, of course, consult with Inspector Frost
as to what details are to be published and what kept back. All I
want at the moment is to start the hue and cry."</p>

<p>The journalist rose from his seat and beckoned to the
detective. As Hardy held the door open, Thomas continued: "There
will be a directors' meeting this evening. I shall make it my
business to be there and to ask the directors to take up the
challenge of this very impertinent murderer, by offering a
reward for his discovery. That's all, Hardy. Good afternoon,
Inspector."</p>

<p>The next morning the contents bills of the <i>Mirror</i>
announced the offer of a reward of £500 for information leading
to the discovery and arrest of Dr. Night. Hardy's story, under a
triple column, spread on the front page, told in crisp, clear
sentences of the finding of the mystery man in Darlinghurst Road
and his death. Then it dealt with this attack on Mrs. Matthews'
house, linking the two mysteries together. In a large panel was
starred the telephone conversation Hardy had with Dr. Night; the
threat to keep out of the investigation or to take the
consequences being prominent in big type.</p>

<p>The story look the imagination of Sydney's million.
Throughout the day information and queries poured into the
newspaper office and the continued ringing of the telephone bell
drove the day editor to a frenzied desperation bordering on
resignation.</p>

<p>Then followed a flood of correspondence, most of the writers
professing to have seen the mysterious Dr. Night in various
parts of the State and Australia. Hardy and Frost took over the
examination of this correspondence and spent considerable time
each day sorting out the few letters that appeared to contain
information of value.</p>

<p>At the same time the police were not idle. Darlinghurst and
the surrounding districts wore carefully combed for any one who
at all resembled the 'grey' man seen by the constable in Oxford
Street.</p>

<p>Late on the third night following the publication of the big
story in the <i>Mirror</i> and the offer of the reward for the
capture of Dr. Night, Frost rose wearily to his feet. He had
just finished examining a collection of letters from the
<i>Mirror's</i> correspondents, all certain that they had lately
seen the hunted man.</p>

<p>"Call it a day, Bob," he suggested, stretching his arms,
wearily. "I did not know there were so many cranks in Australia.
Every dead-beat who has managed to raise the price of a stamp
appears to have the one clue we have overlooked."</p>

<p>"Another fifteen minutes will see me through," replied Hardy,
stifling a yawn. "Here's a letter that might interest you. The
lady, who lives just outside Bourke, is of opinion that a
swaggie who called on her two days previous to the date of her
letter is Dr. Night. She wants the reward sent to her by return
post."</p>

<p>"And the next will be from that particular swagman, informing
us that that identical woman is Dr. Night in petticoats. What's
the matter, Bob?"</p>

<p>"I think we have a clue here," said Hardy, slowly. "There is
not much in the letter, but it rings true."</p>

<p>Frost leaned forward and caught the letter from Hardy's hand.
It was but a scrap of paper and bore only two typewritten
lines:</p><br>

<p class="typewriter">Meet me any night, Roslyn Garden steps, 11
sharp.<br> One week from to-night, alone&mdash;D.</p>

<p><br> The detective dropped the note carefully on the table.
Then he produced a pair of tweezers and lifting the note into
the middle of a clean sheet of foolscap, wrapped it up.</p>

<p>"I shall want your finger prints, Bob," he said. "Let us go
round to the office."</p>

<p>"What's the game?" asked Hardy, curiously.</p>

<p>"I may be mistaken, but this has the appearance of coming
from Dr. Night."</p>

<p>Frost picked up his hat and led the way to the street. "If
our good friend, the doctor, has been careless, there may be
finger prints on this paper. It's a chance, but we won't miss
it."</p>

<p>At police headquarters the Inspector handed over the precious
packet to the man on duty in the fingerprints department, with
copies of his own and Hardy's fingerprints. He requested that if
any strange prints appeared on the paper he be immediately
advised.</p>

<p>Outside the department Hardy looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes to eleven. Too late to keep the appointment
to-night, Frost."</p>

<p>"I was waiting for you to make the remark," observed Frost
with a grin. "I'm in doubt how we are to keep that
appointment."</p>

<p>"There's the word 'alone' included in the message," remarked
Hardy. "I intend to keep the appointment, and alone, to-morrow,
Mr. Detective."</p>

<p>"The hell you won't," retorted Frost, roughly. "The thing's a
damned catch."</p>

<p>"It may not be."</p>

<p>"We'll argue that out to-morrow," Frost yawned. "I'm tired. Do
you think there'll be many of those fool letters to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Shoals of 'em," Hardy assured him with a grin. "What are you
objecting to? We've struck something that looks good."</p>

<p>"The only thing that looks good to me at the moment, is bed.
Advise the same prescription for you, Bob. Good night, and no
fooling with that letter. We're playing with something that's
worse than dynamite."</p>

<p>Frost turned down towards Circular Quay, leaving Hardy to
catch the Bondi tram at the corner of King Street. When the
Inspector had left him, the journalist stood motionless, in the
same spot, for some time. Then, with sudden decision he walked
up to Queen's Square and caught a Darlinghurst tram. At King's
Cross he alighted and walked down Darlinghurst Road to
Elizabeth Bay Road.</p>

<p>At the top of the passageway leading down into Roslyn Gardens
he moved with caution. Carefully examining all the dark spots,
he slipped silently down into Roslyn Gardens, then moved [to the]
corner at the bottom, looking around him.</p>

<p>There was no one in sight.</p>

<p>Hardy had not expected the mysterious "D" to wait at the
appointed spot for any length of time. If, and when, he kept the
appointment, he must be there within five minutes of eleven, and
in that short space of time lay the danger of the adventure.</p>

<p>Leisurely sauntering along, Hardy scrutinised the houses as
he passed. Somewhere in that district lived Dr. Night. If he
kept the appointment with "D" he might have the opportunity of
meeting the murderer face to face. What kind of man would this
Dr. Night prove to be?</p>

<p>Again the mental picture flashed across the journalist's
brain. A cold-blooded, scientific, precise murderer; killing by
intent, and not by the more forgiving lust of passion: an
intellect arrogating to itself a supremacy over the common laws
that made community life possible.</p>

<p>Frost had not been too sympathetic in his views of the
message. He had doubted its honesty, but the journalist was
convinced that the note bore no sinister aspect. The Inspector
would want to police the whole district and mass a force of men
convenient to the meeting place. That would attract attention
and most likely prevent the mysterious correspondent keeping the
appointment.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Hardy would have gone to the rendezvous
unaccompanied, ignoring all thought of danger, and trusting to
his wits and never-failing luck to bring him through unscathed.
At the back of the journalist's mind was a determination to keep
the appointment "D" had made and to keep it alone. The Inspector
was the difficulty. He would not consent to such a course and
Hardy knew that he would have the greatest difficulty in evading
the safeguards the Inspector would try to enforce.</p>

<p>Gradually a plan grew in Hardy's mind for circumventing the
Inspector and his safeguards. Turning back, the journalist again
covered the ground around Roslyn Garden steps. Then, conning
carefully the idea, he walked down to the tram stop. He had
found a way to get from within the guards the Inspector would
certainly surround him with.</p>

<p>At Bondi Junction he left the tram and walked quickly down
Acacia Road, turning in at a doorway of a high block of flats.
On the third floor he let himself into his rooms and switched on
the lights. Then, on the instant, Hardy froze, tense with
expectation.</p>

<p>Someone had been in his rooms, and within the last hour.
There was a subtle perfume in the air of the rooms that was
strange to him.</p>

<p>Cautiously looking around, examining every inch of the
apartment, his eyes came to the table. On it lay a small packet,
wrapped in white paper and tied with coloured string.</p>

<a id="pic5"></a><br>

<div align="center">

</div>

<br>

<p>Moving with every caution, he approached the table and
examined the package without touching it. It looked innocent
but, after the warning he had received from the mysterious Dr.
Night, Hardy was disinclined to take any thing on trust. Leaving
the package untouched, the journalist proceeded to carefully
examine the remainder of the flat.</p>

<p>In the other rooms there were no traces of the strange
visitor. The lock on the front door did not show signs of being
forced, and it was a matter of impossibility for anyone to gain
access to the flat from the windows. The intruders must have
obtained a key to the rooms.</p>

<p>Returning to the sitting-room, Hardy again examined the
package carefully. It looked innocent enough, but some instinct
warned him that he was facing a deadly peril. A short search and
the newspaper man found an old pair of leather motor-gauntlets.</p>

<p>Donning those, Hardy cut the string and unrolled the
parcel.</p>

<p>Beneath the white wrappings was a small box. Lifting the lid
with great precaution, the journalist discovered a small tube of
white powder lying on a bed of cotton wool. He recognised it at
once. Only a couple of days before be had seen a similar tube in
the hands of Dr. Streatham, at the Sydney Hospital. It was a
tube of cocaine, of the sort dealt with by the illicit drug
smugglers.</p>

<p>"Now, who the devil is making me a present of a tube of
cocaine?" Hardy muttered. "Of all the crass
foolishness&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carefully he lifted the tube from its bed of cotton wool and
held it to the light. Then, after a moment's hesitation, he
replaced it in the box and put on the lid. For some time Hardy
sat, staring at the innocent looking box on the table, lying
beside the heavy leather gauntlets. Then, with sudden
resolution, he locked the box in a drawer of his desk, and,
picking up the gauntlets, donned them. In the bathroom he
scrubbed and disinfected them, thoroughly.</p>

<p>"I may be an ass," he muttered to himself, with a whimsical
smile. "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he turned out the light and went to bed.</p>

<p>"Well, and what did you do then?" Inspector Frost asked the
question impatiently. He was seated in Hardy's room at the
<i>Mirror</i> office, and the journalist had been recounting the
story of the box of cocaine he had found in his rooms the
previous evening.</p>

<p>"Went to bed," replied Hardy, laconically.</p>

<p>"Did you bolt the front door?" retorted the detective, with
an attempt of sarcasm. The journalist had taken the finding of
the tube of cocaine in his room so calmly that the Inspector was
curious.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Your strange visitor might have returned after you had gone
to bed."</p>

<p>"He might," drawled Hardy. "But I give him credit for keeping
better hours than I do."</p>

<p>"You've got a nerve, young man," was the Inspector's only
comment. "S'pose you slept like a top?"</p>

<p>"Always do. Why shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Well, nothing happened to disturb your rest? No one entered
your flat again?" The Inspector asked the questions as if he did
not require answers. "What about it to-night?"</p>

<p>"What about it?" The journalist was immediately on his guard.
He had made up his mind to keep that assignment alone and he
knew that he would meet with the keenest opposition from the
detective. From the moment Frost had entered his office the
newspaper man had sensed the struggle of wits that was to
come.</p>

<p>Frost would go to any length to gain his ends and surround
the meeting with the unknown "D" with all the precautions at the
command of the Department. Hardy had to meet this opposition
alone and without resources. It was a battle of wits and he was
determined not to accept defeat.</p>

<p>The Inspector had already taken certain precautions. He was
well aware that Hardy was determined to shake off his
companionship and protection. Already Hardy was under hidden and
constant espionage. Men had been detailed for special duty in
the vicinity of Roslyn Gardens steps and at ten o'clock that
night a large body of police would take up strategic positions
in the neighbourhood, enclosing a huge area of ground into which
anyone might enter but none escape from unquestioned.</p>

<p>Within that ring the Inspector had determined that he and the
journalist would pass, with a few chosen men, specially detained
to seize "D." The moment the capture was made, the ring would be
closed only to reopen when the Inspector was satisfied that he
had the mysterious Dr. Night in his grasp.</p>

<p>Frost had sensed the opposition of the journalist. He was
waiting for some overt act on the part of Hardy that would bring
matters to a head. Then, and then only, would he finalise the
disposition of his men. But he was determined that the break
should originate with the newspaperman and, until it occurred he
would stick to his side like a burr.</p>

<p>Slouching low in his chair, Hardy watched the detective with
half-closed eyes. He could guess the thoughts passing through
the official mind. Already he had guessed the detective's plans
for the night, and was determined that no action of his should
give the Inspector cause for complaint.</p>

<p>The "burr" idea was so apparent that the newspaperman almost
laughed aloud. For the first time in his life he was under
police espionage. Many times he had tried to imagine what his
course would be in such circumstances. Now the occasion had
arisen. It was his brains against the whole police force,
directed by one of the cleverest detectives in Australia.</p>

<p>It was his intention to shake off that espionage; to slip
away from the Inspector; to hold the interview with "D"
unwatched; and to return to his office or home unaccompanied by
Frost or any of his subordinates.</p>

<p>Throughout the day Hardy deliberately reversed the position
between himself and Frost. Together they went about the routine
of enquiries, the visit to the various stations with which they
were in touch, the examination of the enormous mail at the
<i>Mirror</i> offices. In apparent friendliness, but hidden
antagonism, they lunched together in Hardy's room in the
<i>Mirror</i> office, which had, for the time being, become the
headquarters of the hunt for Dr. Night.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Thomas arrived at the <i>Mirror</i>,
and immediately sent for the journalist to learn the latest news
of the hunt for Dr. Night. The Inspector accompanied the
journalist to the room of the managing editor and urged on
Thomas the advisability of Hardy acting, during the interview
with "D," with police instructions and requirements.</p>

<p>To the detective's surprise, Thomas refused to interfere. The
situation amused him, and in a few terse sentences he made the
Inspector understand that he had placed the hunt for Dr. Night
in Hardy's hands, and that it was not his habit to interfere
without sufficient cause. Finally, and somewhat bluntly, he
intimated that he considered the police held the big end of the
stick, and that it would be difficult for a single person,
however clever, to evade police protection, it the police were
serious in their determination. During the evening meal Frost
was somewhat silent and made but short answers to Hardy's easy
flow of conversation.</p>

<p>Once more out on the street, the journalist proposed that
they turn in to one of the picture shows for the few hours of
waiting. Frost grimly assented. Here, he suspected, was the
commencement of the journalist's plan of evasion. Well, he could
try. The Inspector was confident that he would get an unpleasant
shock.</p>

<p>It happened that the principal picture of the programme was
an American detective story. In spite of his attitude of
watchfulness over the journalist, Frost became interested,
noting with some distaste the many abnormalities of police
methods introduced by the author. If that story in any way
interpreted police methods of the United Slates of America then
no wonder that continent was over-run by crooks.</p>

<p>The picture was working to its climax when the Inspector felt
a touch on his arm. Hardy was on his feet.</p>

<p>"Time to move on, old man," whispered the newspaperman, and
led the way out of the building. Outside, half-a-dozen men were
standing idly by the curb. As Frost passed he made a sign for
them to follow. Markedly unconcerned, Hardy led the way up King
Street and boarded the Darlinghurst tram. Frost, silent but
watching intently, kept pace with him.</p>

<p>The men following, guessing their leader's intention, had
disappeared.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">THE short journey up William Street passed
almost in silence. At King's Cross the two men alighted, and
three men from another compartment of the tram followed them.
Crossing the road Hardy, murmuring something about cigarettes,
entered a soft-drinks shop. Frost waited outside. Here was a
chance to pass the necessary instructions to his waiting
men.</p>

<p>In a few moments the journalist rejoined the Inspector and
the two men with their shadows, sauntered along Darlinghurst
Road. Just opposite the short lane leading to the head of the
stops, Hardy paused.</p>

<p>"I propose to be at the head of the steps exactly at the hour," he
said casually. "I shall wait there two minutes, and then walk
down the steps to Roslyn Gardens at a fair pace. If I reach the
foot of the steps before five minutes past, then I shall wait
there until the time is up."</p>

<p>"So you have no objections now to my accompanying you?" asked
the Inspector, with some surprise.</p>

<p>"I am leaving that decision to you."</p>

<p>Hardy registered astonishment in a nearly perfect manner.</p>

<p>"I warn you that if you insist on accompanying me it is
possible that my correspondent will not show up. Still, there is
a chance that I may be mistaken."</p>

<p>"I'm coming."</p>

<p>Frost was doggedly determined, that in no circumstances would
he lose sight of the journalist that night, or at least not
until well past eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>Across the road, the lane leading to the head of the steps
lay silent and dark. In the distance a deepening in the
blackness denoted the head of the steps. For a minute the two
men stood side by side, looking down the lane. Within the next
half-hour that quiet spot might be the scene of one of the most
sensational episodes in police history of Sydney.</p>

<p>Hardy looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"What do you make the time, Frost?" Hardy spoke casually. "We
had better set our watches together. I make it three minutes to
the hour, by the G.P.O. clock, this morning."</p>

<p>The Inspector set his watch, which happened to be a few
minutes slow, by the journalist's. For another minute they
stood, quietly talking.</p>

<p>"Time's up!" said Hardy, briskly. "Coming?"</p>

<p>Without looking round, he led the way across the road and
down the lane to the head of the steps. Half-way down a large
tree cast a heavy shadow across the steps. It was necessary to
proceed with careful watchfulness. Frost was on the lighter side
of the passage and forged slightly ahead.</p>

<p>Once again, when the light of the lamp lit the path, he
turned and spoke to the journalist. To his surprise Hardy had
disappeared.</p>

<a id="pic6"></a><br>

<div align="center">
<img src="1701131h-images/DrNight-06.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>Inspector Frost was startled. He could have sworn that Hardy
had stood beside him within the last five seconds.</p>

<p>Immediately he became the alert police officer. Quietly
turning on the steps, he surveyed his surroundings. On his right
was a low wooden fence bordering a somewhat untidy garden. There
was little shrubbery in that garden, certainly not enough to
cover a man. The light of the lamp illuminated the garden fairly
well, and after a careful look over the Inspector decided that
the journalist could not have escaped that way.</p>

<p>On the left side, the steps were bordered by a high cement
wall, too high, in the police officer's opinion, for Hardy to
have surmounted so quickly and quietly. Away behind him the
steps ascended to the path. It would take a very active man
nearly half a minute to have run up the steps and around the
corner of the lane. Certainly, no one could have run that
distance in quick time without making considerable noise, and
the disappearance of the journalist had been absolutely
noiseless.</p>

<p>The only remaining avenue of escape was down the steps to the
Gardens, and that would have necessitated passing before the
police officer. Suddenly Frost darted towards the cement wall,
right in the heart of the shadow. There was a low door, almost
indistinguishable in the darkness. Throwing his weight against
it, the Inspector found it was locked. Yet Hardy might have
found it open until he had passed through, and then shot the
bolt.</p>

<p>With a spring the Inspector got his hands on the top of the
wall and pulled himself up. Straddling the wall, he saw below
him a well-groomed flower garden. From his seat he could see
every inch of the ground, and Hardy certainly was not concealed
there. Decidedly puzzled, Frost came to the conclusion that the
journalist must have doubled back up the steps. It seemed
impossible, but there was no other solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>Running up the stops and along the lane, the Inspector came
out under the lamp in Darlinghurst road. He gave a low whistle
and a man came out of the shadows towards him.</p>

<p>"Anyone come up the steps, Thompson?" asked Frost
abruptly.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the plain-clothes constable. "Not a soul
been along here since you and Mr. Hardy went down there."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Hardy come this way?" The Inspector disliked asking
the question. He had been hoodwinked, and he did not wish his
subordinates to know it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hardy, sir?" inquired the man. "No sir. He went down the
steps with you and has not come back again. Did you
separate?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" half-lied Frost. "Keep a sharp look out. Something
queer is happening in this neighbourhood. Whistle immediately
you see anything suspicious."</p>

<p>At that moment the clock of a nearby church chimed the four
quarters, and then commenced to strike the hour. Instinctively,
the Inspector pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>"That clock's slow," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Not much, sir." The man pulled out a large silver watch.
"Just two minutes."</p>

<p>"Your watch is dead wrong," exclaimed Frost heatedly. "That
clock is seven or eight minutes slow."</p>

<p>"I put my watch right by the station clock just before I came
out," replied the officer doggedly. "I ain't a minute out."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Hardy and I put our watches&mdash;" Frost stopped
suddenly in the middle of the sentence. He had remembered
comparing watches with Hardy and that he had advanced his watch
five minutes to make it coincide with the journalist's watch.
Hardy had claimed that his watch was exact, and Frost had
carelessly accepted that assurance.</p>

<p>The journalist had set his watch five minutes fast. Frost had
not to think long to guess the puzzle. All through the day he
had watched the journalist carefully, expecting some trick.
Then, for one moment he had been off his guard, and in that
moment Hardy had planned and made his get-away.</p>

<p>For some moments Frost stood wondering at the cleverness of
the journalist. It had been a simple trick; so simple that it
had caught him off his guard. He had been suspicious of the
sudden acquiescence of the newspaper-man to the companionship of
the police. He had expected Hardy to make some attempt to evade
the continued espionage, and had anticipated with grim humour
the sudden and effective counter-move he had prepared. Then, at
the one moment when he could not retrieve any error, the
journalist had fooled him&mdash;tricked him as if he were but a
novice.</p>

<p>In the police force, Frost had built up a reputation for
dogged perseverance. It had become a tradition that any criminal
on whose trail he had camped would be run down and certainly
captured. He was "Bulldog" Frost, and any man on whom his hand
rested was a safe and sure prisoner.</p>

<p>One consolation the detective had. Hardy was within the lines
he had drawn round the steps, and he could not get out without
his permission. Walking quickly up the road, Frost passed the
word to close the net and bring everyone within it to him.</p>

<p>Then, slowly and methodically, he started to make the circuit
of his lines. At the end of Roslyn Gardens he came upon his
first clue. A few minutes after eleven a closed car had driven
up to the policeman on duly, and had been passed through the
lines. A young lady had driven the car. She had stopped when
challenged by the police, and explained that she had been
visiting friends in the Gardens. She had given her name and
address, and had been alone in the car.</p>

<p>"Anything in the car?" demanded Frost.</p>

<p>"Only rugs and things motorists litter up their car with,"
replied the man.</p>

<p>Frost knew that he was beaten. The girl was "D" or an agent
of "D," and under those rugs littering the back of the car had
lain Robert Hardy, a prisoner or a free agent.</p>

<p>Frost cursed his luck as he made his way back to the steps.
There he made a careful examination by the light of his electric
torch. He could see the marks which he had made in climbing the
cement wall. There were no other marks.</p>

<p>Climbing on to the wall again, he made a careful inspection
of the beds and paths. Again he confronted a blank. Back on the
steps, he glanced over the wooden wall at the patch of ground
bordering the wall and flashed his torch over the loose soil.
There were no footmarks. Hardy had disappeared as if he had been
snatched up into the clouds.</p>

<p>"I'll make him come across with the trick when I see him
again," muttered Frost savagely. "He put one over on me that
time. I'll give him credit for that."</p>

<p>In Darlinghurst Road once more, Frost called his men off duty
and went down to the <i>Mirror</i> offices. There he sought an
interview with Thomas, after learning that Hardy had not
returned.</p>

<p>"Any luck, Frost?" asked the managing editor when the
detective entered his room.</p>

<p>"Hardy's disappeared," replied the Inspector, sinking into a
chair.</p>

<p>"What?" Thomas jumped as though he had been seated on
springs. "What do you mean, Frost? If anything's happened to
that boy, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He played the disappearing trick himself," retorted the
Inspector baldly. "You remember how I urged that you should
forbid him to part from me. You refused to interfere. So he
disappeared on his own."</p>

<p>"Put one over on you?"</p>

<p>Thomas was grave for a moment, and then laughed. "Rather a
come-down for the police force."</p>

<p>"I'll give him his due; it was smart work." Frost was, at
last, able to laugh at his own discomfiture. "That young man
would make a criminal that would turn white the hair of a force
of Commissioners."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a few minutes the two men enjoyed the joke.
Then the Inspector went over the night's happenings, step by
step, not trying to cover his confusion when he found that Hardy
had succeeded in giving him the slip. At the end of the story
the two men looked at each other and again laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"I hope that nothing will happen to the boy," said Thomas at
length. "He is a smart lad, and a bloodhound on the trail of a
story, but he is inclined to take too many risks."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to say that I'm not worrying about him, Mr.
Thomas," said the detective candidly. "I am. But if he can get
me in such an easy fashion, I'll back him to got out of any
difficulty he wanders into with a whole skin, too."</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang. Thomas picked up the receiver and
listened for a minute, a broad grin spreading over his face.
Then he passed the instrument over to the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Hardy wants you, Frost."</p>

<p>"Is that Inspector Frost, of the New South Wales Detective
Department?" came over the wire, faintly, in a well-known
voice.</p>

<p>"It is," replied the detective grimly. "May I ask what your
highness has been doing since I set my watch by your very
inaccurate timepiece?"</p>

<p>"I've been for a joyride with a lady friend." The voice on
the wire held a hint of laughter. "At the moment I am at home,
going to bed, as a pattern for all good detectives."</p>

<p>"I suppose the lady's name commences with a capital D?"
suggested the Inspector, grinning in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"It does." Then came a low laugh. "Say, Frost, she's some
peach!"</p>

<p>Hardy laughed silently as he heard the rapid footsteps of
Inspector Frost running up towards Darlinghurst Road. He was
crouching under the low wooden fence, hardly daring to breathe.
Immediately the steps of the detective died away in the
distance, he stood up and stepped on to the hard gravel path. A
few gardening tools were lying about, and picking up a rake the
journalist carefully smoothed out the footmarks on the soft bed.
Then he strode rapidly down towards the Gardens and vaulted the
low wall.</p>

<p>It had been absurdly easy. Frost had been thrown off his
guard and had not acted with his usual resource. Hardy had
anticipated this. The unpremeditated action of the detective
would give the necessary time to meet "D" and get away before
the Inspector returned to the steps to make a more systematic
search. As Hardy vaulted the fence the church clock chimed the
hour. If his unknown correspondent was punctual his plans would
have succeeded to a nicety. The journalist stood, counting the
strokes on the bell. As the last tone sounded a motor car swung
rapidly round the corner and pulled up at the foot of the
steps.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hardy! Quick!" It was a girl's voice, low and
exceedingly pleasant. Wondering greatly the journalist stepped
into the back of the car, tripping over a pile of rugs.
Immediately the car moved forward. The rugs gave Hardy a hint.
They had yet to pierce the cordon of police Frost had drawn in a
wide circle around the stops. It might be possible for him to
bluff the car through, but he did not know what instructions the
Inspector had given to his men. Sitting down on the floor of the
car, the newspaper man covered himself with the rugs, making the
heap look as natural as possible. He had hardly concealed
himself before the car pulled up abruptly, and he heard a man
talking to the girl driver. A few moments and the car moved
forward.</p>

<p>Hardy crawled out from under the rugs, and, opening the near
door, stepped on to the running board, and slipped into the seat
by the driver. The girl had opened out the car, and, dodging
through some side streets, crossed in front of the Rushcutter's
Bay Stadium, and then, by side streets, into Oxford Street.
Turning citywards she swung into Victoria Street and down to
Potts Point. Outside the gates of some large gardens,
surrounding a fine house, she brought the car to a stop.</p>

<p>"Will you open the gales, please, Mr. Hardy?" she said,
quietly. Hardy swung open the gates, and, when the girl had
driven through, closed them again and walked up to the car. The
girl was standing on the path awaiting him.</p>

<p>"I did not expect the place to be surrounded by police."
There was more than a hint of reproach in the clear voice.</p>

<p>"Inspector Frost is particularly thick-headed at times," said
the journalist. "Unfortunately, he was in my office when I
received your letter. Nothing would satisfy him but that he must
also attend the interview you so kindly offered me. I tried
hard, but he would not understand that three people always
formed a particularly large crowd. Getting rid of him was very
arduous work."</p>

<p>The girl laughed, and Hardy decided that she had a
particularly pretty laugh. He wished that she would move out of
the shadows so that he could judge if her features matched her
laughter.</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall have to introduce myself, after this most
informal meeting," she observed. "My name is Doris Blayde. This
is my father's house."</p>

<p>"You already know my name," replied the journalist. "But to
comply with social demands, I should I say that Robert Hardy of
the <i>Mirror</i> has the honour to await your commands."</p>

<p>"How did you get rid of your friend Inspector Frost?"
inquired the girl.</p>

<p>"I left him on the steps." Hardy laughed slightly at the
picture of the bewildered Inspector searching for him. "The last
I heard of him was a muttered statement about 'being snatched up
into the blooming clouds'."</p>

<p>"I was surprised to find the district being watched by the
police. Still, it didn't matter, as you managed to give them the
slip," remarked Doris. "I had been visiting in the Gardens and I
did tell the constable my right name and address. So it doesn't
matter, does it?"</p>

<p>"Not one bit," assured Hardy.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are wondering why I sent that note to you,"
Doris appeared to be at a loss how to guide the
conversation.</p>

<p>"I gathered from your short note that you had some
information for me," suggested the newspaper man, "Still, if it
was only your intention to take me for a motor ride around the
beauties of your neighbourhood, I must offer you my hearty
thanks."</p>

<p>"It was more than that, Mr. Hardy." The girl spoke earnestly.
"Father and I have been wondering over certain matters that have
come to our knowledge, and I suggested that you should be told
of them. Father objected, so I took this course of sending for
you."</p>

<p>"But if your father objects&mdash;" commenced Hardy.</p>

<p>"He won't, now I have caught you," laughed the girl. "I think
he is in the library. Will you help me to put this machine away
and we will join him."</p>

<p>The garage doors were open and Doris steered the big machine
skilfully into its place. Then she led the way through a side
door of the house into a corridor.</p>

<p>"Father's in here," she whispered, stopping before a door.
"He's not very terrible, even when I do things he says I
mustn't."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">SHE opened a door and led the way into a large
comfortably-furnished room, crowded with books. Although
principally a library, it bore unmistakable evidence of being a
favourite living room of the family. A bright fire was burning
on the hearth, and seated before it was a tall, fair man, with a
mass of light grey, curly hair surrounding his head. As he
turned his head at the opening of the door, Hardy saw that he
was clean shaven and his eyes bright blue, particularly
open.</p>

<p>"Dad. I have brought Mr. Robert Hardy, of the <i>Mirror</i>,
home with me."</p>

<p>Mr. Blayde came forward to greet the journalist. His hand,
extended in greeting, was long and slender, and the slightly
bowed shoulders spoke eloquently of the man of books and not of
affairs.</p>

<p>"I did protest at my daughter mixing herself up in this
affair of the dead man found in Darlinghurst Road," said Blayde,
speaking in a low soft voice. "Yet I am most pleased to welcome
you to my home, Mr. Hardy. I think you will be comfortable here
and&mdash;what will you have to drink? We make a practice of
helping ourselves in this house. Ah, I see. Doris is before
me."</p>

<p>"I am afraid this is an unconventional hour for a call, Mr.
Blayde," laughed Hardy, sinking luxuriously into the depths of a
lounge chair. He was weary after his long day's work and the
excitement of the evening. Doris seated herself on the arm of
her father's chair. With her hat off, Hardy had an opportunity
of unobtrusively scrutinising her. She was of medium height,
with a slight boyish figure, fair, almost the same tone as her
father. He decided that she was quite as pretty as her voice by
this time. He had quite made up his mind she had the prettiest
voice he had ever heard.</p>

<p>"My daughter and I have followed the story of the Mystery Man
of Darlinghurst in your newspaper, very closely," commenced
Blayde. "I am by way of being an amateur criminologist, and my
daughter is an earnest devourer of detective fiction."</p>

<p>"All this is to lead up to the fact that we believe that we
have discovered something that will help you, Mr. Hardy,"
interjected Doris.</p>

<p>"That remains for Mr. Hardy to judge," corrected Blayde.
"Certainly we have noticed some queer happenings in this
neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"Have you any reason to believe that they are connected in
any way with the Mystery Man?" asked Hardy.</p>

<p>"I think I know the man whose body was found in Darlinghurst
Road." Doris was jumping with impatience, contrasting quaintly
with her father's more judicial attitude.</p>

<p>"You know the Mystery Man?" Hardy sat upright.</p>

<p>"I told father I had seen him, when I saw the portrait in the
<i>Mirror</i>, but he would not believe me. You see, Mr. Hardy,
your newspaper does not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;go in for art portraiture," completed Hardy with a
laugh. "Do you think, you would recognise him from a proper
portrait?"</p>

<p>"I am certain I should," exclaimed Doris.</p>

<p>Hardy hesitated a moment. Then he drew a photograph from his
breast pocket. "I'm afraid It may shock you, Miss Blayde," he
said, hesitatingly, and holding the photograph face downwards.
"You see, it was taken after death and&mdash;well, although he
was not outwardly injured, death photographs are not very
pleasant."</p>

<p>Doris hold out her hand without hesitation, although she
shuddered slightly when she first saw the face of the dead
man.</p>

<p>"Yes," Doris exclaimed, passing the photograph of the mystery
man to her father. "I am sure it is the same man. You only saw
him once or twice, dad, but perhaps you will recognise him."</p>

<p>"I think you are right, Doris." Mr. Blayde spoke after he had
carefully examined the photograph.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Hardy, with difficulty restraining his
impatience.</p>

<p>"I believe this to be the photograph of a man who lived for a
time in the house next to this. He was, I believe, chauffeur to
Mr. Francis Westerton."</p>

<p>"Francis Westerton?" Hardy was puzzled. "If this man was his
chauffeur, I wonder why Mr. Westerton has not come forward to
identity the body. Who <i>is</i> this Mr. Westerton?"</p>

<p>"I know little of him," explained Blayde. "He bought the
house next door some two years ago. We have seen little of
him. He appears to go out very little, and then only in a closed
car. Doris came in touch with his chauffeur while our man was
away on his holidays, and her car broke down. She telephoned to
Mr. Westerton and asked him to allow his man to come in and give
the machine a look over. The man came and fixed up the car. I
saw him for a few minutes when I rewarded him for his trouble.
On the other hand Doris was in and out of the garage all the
time."</p>

<p>"You know nothing of Mr. Westerton, socially?" asked
Hardy.</p>

<p>"He is absolutely unsociable," protested the girl. "I tried
to get him to come to a dance we gave here, and he hadn't the
decency to refuse my invitation."</p>

<p>"Then he must be hopeless." Hardy thought he would not
require much pressing to attend a dance with Miss Doris
Blayde.</p>

<p>"Now that we have succeeded in identifying the mystery man,"
remarked Blayde, "I will leave it to Doris to tell you the
remainder of the story. All I will say is that I can personally
vouch for the truth of the many incidents. I did not see the
first part of the affair, but Doris fetched me in time to
witness the climax."</p>

<p>"Is your story connected with Mr. Westerton, Miss Blayde?"
asked Hardy with interest.</p>

<p>"The events happened in Mr. Westerton's grounds," replied the
girl. "First, I should explain to you how I came to witness the
affair, or you will think I am in the habit of prying into my
neighbour's affairs."</p>

<p>"Before you commence, Miss Blayde," interrupted Hardy, "will
you tell me if you have any occasion to believe that Mr.
Westerton had anything to do with the murder of his
chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"The murder of his chauffeur?" repeated the girl in
surprise.</p>

<p>"So far as we have penetrated into the mystery, there is
every reason to believe that the man who was found unconscious
in Darlinghurst Road was murdered by a man named Dr. Night."</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Westerton is Dr. Night," announced Doris
positively, ignoring the protesting hand her father raised.</p>

<p>Hardy Sprang to his feet, in excitement. This man, Westerton,
to be the mysterious, self-confessed murderer, Dr. Night! For a
minute he remained standing, trying to steady and coordinate his
facts.</p>

<p>"What grounds have you for that statement, Miss Blayde," he
said, at length, seating himself again.</p>

<p>"Do let me tell my story and then you can judge," said Doris,
quietly. She left the arm of her father's chair and drew a low
stool against his knee. Sitting there, in the soft glow of the
fire light, she made so fair a picture that Hardy could not take
his eyes from her.</p>

<p>"I have read everything you have published about the mystery
man." The girl spoke after a long pause and in a low voice.
"First, I was attracted by the awful bad print of the man in the
<i>Mirror</i>. Then your story of the mysterious Dr. Night was
most thrilling. It was like a romance out of a book. If you will
come to the top of this house you will find that I have a cosy
nook up there, for, although we are near the water, we can only
see it from the roof. One evening&mdash;it was the day before
the mystery man was found&mdash;I remained up in my nook very
late. Dad had been detained in town and I would not go down to
dinner. I told my maid, Annie, to bring me up a light meal, on a
tray. Presently, I got tired of reading, and picked up the
powerful glasses dad keeps up there, to examine the ships that
go up and down the Harbour. There was a big ship coming in and I
turned the glasses on her. I could see her decks plainly and
followed her with the glasses until she went out of sight behind
the trees."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">DORIS hesitated a moment and then continued "I
was just going to put the glasses down when I saw something
moving in the garden next door. I had looked at the house just
before I took up the glasses to examine the ship, and the place
appeared deserted. There was not a light in the house, and I
thought that Mr. Westerton had retired for the night, or else
had gone on one of the long motor trips he is so fond of.
Perhaps I should not have done so&mdash;dad says that I was
wrong&mdash;but I turned the glasses on the grounds, and what I
saw there was so strange that I could not resist continuing to
look. Two men were standing under the trees, near our wall. They
appeared to be engaged in a furious argument. One was a big man,
the other much shorter and thinner."</p>

<p>Hardy wanted to ask a question, but refrained. There would be
plenty of time to question the girl when she had finished her
story.</p>

<p>"Presently the big man turned and strode towards the house.
The shorter man followed, continuing to argue the point in
dispute. He was quite excited over it, and at length stood right
in the path of his companion. The big man pushed him on one side
and went into the house. I thought the other man would follow
him, but he did not, and as he seemed to expect the big man to
return, I continued to watch. The big man came back after a
short interval. This time he had another man with him, and they
carried something long, and wrapped in a rug, between them. Do
you know, Mr. Hardy, I believe they were carrying the mystery
man of Darlinghurst Road."</p>

<p>Doris appeared to be somewhat overcome by the recital of the
scene she had witnessed on the evening before the mystery man
was found by the police. Her father took her hand and held it,
patting it sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Don't go on, if it upsets you, Miss Blayde," urged Hardy.
"Now you have given us so good a tip, we can no doubt get to the
bottom of the business without troubling you further."</p>

<p>"No; I will tell you all that I saw," decided Doris, looking
up proudly. "They carried the&mdash;the thing to a place under
the trees where I had first seen the two men standing. Again
they had another argument. I thought that they were never going
to come to a conclusion, but at last the big man appeared to
give way to the arguments of his companion. The man who had,
apparently, done all the talking&mdash;the thinner, shorter
man&mdash;then went away, and, after a time, I saw the car
backing to the place. The men lifted the 'thing' into the car
and then got in themselves. The car drove away, and I heard it
go out of the grounds on to the road. I went downstairs and met
dad in the hall. He had just come home, and I told him all that
I had seen. He would not believe me at first, but I made him
come upstairs with me, and there I explained everything all over
again. Just as dad was getting impatient and saying that I had
been dreaming, we heard the car returning. In a few minutes it
came in view along the drive. It stopped at the front door, and
the two men got out. Then the car drove off to the garage. The
two men came across to the trees, and I saw them pick up some
tools. They were talking excitedly, and once I thought they were
going to fight. At length, they went away, and although dad and
I remained on the roof for some time, nothing more happened."
Doris concluded her story, breathlessly.</p>

<p>For a time the journalist sat silent, conning the many points
the girl had set out. "You believe that the long package they
carried out of the house to be the mystery man?" he asked at
length.</p>

<p>"It was just the shape of a body, and they were away in the
car just long enough to go to Darlinghurst Road, get rid of him
and return," replied Blayde. "I did not credit Doris' story at
first, but the actions of the men were so strange, and the facts
in the newspapers appeared to fit into them so well, that at
last I had to believe."</p>

<p>"Did you recognise any of the men?" asked Hardy. "I am
positive the two men I first saw were Mr. Westerton and his
valet," answered the girl.</p>

<p>"It was too dark to be certain," corrected Blayde. "The forms
appeared to be those of the persons Doris mentioned."</p>

<p>"What is Mr. Westerton like?" Hardy asked the question
eagerly. On the answer might rest the solution of part of the
problem before him.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is a big man&mdash;a big, burly man, very red in the
face, and with a thick neck, and he wears the smallest of
collars possible." Doris' words were illustrated with eager
gestures. "He has small green eyes and quite a little rosebud
mouth, and he has such a funny voice. Just like a child's."</p>

<p>"Then I am afraid Mr. Westerton is not Dr. Night," said the
journalist disappointedly. "We have a description of Dr. Night
as a short, slight man, very grey, and speaking in a precise,
even tone."</p>

<p>Doris looked disappointed.</p>

<p>"You have given me a wonderful help," stated Hardy earnestly,
as he rose to take his departure. "Half past twelve! You will
never forgive me for detaining you to this hour, Mr. Blayde.
Good night, and thank you very much for your help."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">DORIS escorted the journalist to the door. As
he took her hand in parting, he asked:</p>

<p>"Why did you send me that note, and write to me in that
mysterious way?"</p>

<p>"Because I have the idea that my father and I are being
watched."</p>

<p>Doris made the startling reply in a very matter of fact
voice. "I am certain there is something evil next door, although
you do not think that Mr. Westerton is your Dr. Night. Those
people next door are doing illegal things, and they are afraid
we are watching them."</p>

<p>Then, as Hardy stood on the doorstep, Doris placed her hand
on his coat-sleeve. "You will come and see us again. Mr. Hardy,
will you not? Dad and I are so interested in this
mystery&mdash;and your work."</p>

<p>It was only the street door, that by some mysterious means
interposed at the critical moment, that prevented the journalist
making an abject fool of himself.</p>

<p>Inspector Frost was awaiting Hardy when he arrived at the
<i>Mirror</i> Office the next morning. The detective greeted the
newspaper man without any sign of animosity at the trick played
on him the previous evening. In fact, except for a few words of
somewhat heavy sarcasm, he ignored the incident of the Roslyn
Gardens steps and concentrated on the story told to the
newspaper man by Doris Blayde.</p>

<p>The one outstanding feature of the story was the
identification of the mystery man of Darlinghurst Road, and the
Inspector sharply cross-questioned the journalist on this.</p>

<p>Why had not Westerton come forward to identify the dead man
as his chauffeur? True, the newspaper reproductions of the
photograph of the dead man were poor and rendered positive
identification difficult; but against that could be set the fact
that the chauffeur must have been missed from the household, and
inquiry as to his whereabouts would be natural.</p>

<p>Again, Doris Blayde and her father had seen sufficient
resemblance between the prints and the chauffeur to induce them
to communicate with the <i>Mirror's</i> representative.</p>

<p>The Inspector did not attach much importance to the story of
the men and the mysterious package beneath the trees. There
might be a dozen plausible explanations of the incident.
Further, while the chauffeur might have been murdered at the
house, it was almost impossible to believe that any person
should consider burying an unconscious man, even though he was
certain to die in time.</p>

<p>Shortly after mid-day, Thomas came down to the newspaper
office and on learning that the Inspector and Hardy were in
consultation on the premises, sent a message asking them to join
him in his room.</p>

<p>There, Hardy had to go again over the story told him by the
Blaydes. The managing editor supported the theory of the
detective and advised an immediate interview with Mr.
Westerton.</p>

<p>To the Inspector's surprise, Hardy refused to accompany him
on the visit to Westerton's house. He gave as his reason for his
refusal that he had determined to make "Holmhurst," Mr. Blayde's
residence, his headquarters for watching Westerton's house, and
that his accompanying Frost on the inquiry might draw unwelcome
attention to the Blaydes, and his presence there.</p>

<p>After some discussion Thomas supported the argument of the
journalist, and it was decided that the Inspector should take
with him the Darlinghurst constable who had seen the man
supposed to be Dr. Night in Oxford Street.</p>

<p>Frost chose the early afternoon for his visit to "Forest
Home." A telephone to Darlinghurst Police Station warned the
constable to meet him at King's Cross, and the two men walked
down to Pott's Point shortly after 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>The big iron gates of "Forest Home" were wide open when the
Inspector and his companion arrived. A couple of gardeners were
engaged on some flower beds near the entrance. As Frost walked
up the gravel drive he looked around him with some curiosity.
The long, low cement-faced house, surrounded by wide verandahs,
did not look like the lair of a gang of desperate criminals. It
was just the house that would normally be occupied by a wealthy
Sydney merchant. The place was in excellent repair, and the
grounds remarkably well kept. Far away to the left stood a belt
of trees, bordering the dividing wall between "Forest Home" and
"Holmhurst," the trees beneath which Doris Blayde had seen the
strange incident of the long bundle.</p>

<p>As Frost and the constable approached the main entrance, a
tall, stout man, with a very florid complexion, rose from a
lounge on the verandah, and came to meet them. From the
description of the journalist Frost decided that this was
Westerton, the owner of the house.</p>

<p>"Mr. Westerton?" queried the Inspector. "My name is
Frost&mdash;Inspector Frost, of the Criminal Investigation
Department of the New South Wales Police. Will you give me a few
minutes of your time?"</p>

<p>"Delighted!" The absurd rosebud mouth pursed into a baby
smile that made the Inspector almost laugh. The voice was that
of a young child, ridiculous in the extreme from such a large
man. He turned and led the way to where he had been seated and
drew up some chairs.</p>

<p>"Constable Chalmers, of the Darlinghurst District,"
introduced the Inspector. "From certain in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please." The big man held up a fat white hand. "I am sure,
after the walk from the tram stop, you must be thirsty. May I
offer you a drink?"</p>

<p>Frost accepted the proferred hospitality. He was in no hurry
to leave "Forest Home." The longer he could linger about the
place, the greater the opportunity to examine the house and its
inmates.</p>

<p>"I am investigating the death of the man found unconscious in
Darlinghurst Road, a week ago, Mr. Westerton," commenced Frost
officially. "So far we have not been able to establish
identity."</p>

<p>"A most sad case," chirruped Westerton. "I am afraid I do not
see how I shall be able to help you, Inspector."</p>

<p>"You read the daily papers, Mr. Westerton?" asked Frost. "The
<i>Mirror</i> for instance?"</p>

<p>"A most interesting newspaper; Certainly I take it."</p>

<p>"You saw the photograph of the murdered man in that
newspaper?"</p>

<p>The fat man laughed heartily. "It was a portrait? It might
have been someone. You, for example, Mr Frost."</p>

<p>"It did not remind you of anyone?" The Inspector was watching
Westerton, keenly. The man appeared to be thoroughly at
ease.</p>

<p>"No! why should it?"</p>

<p>Frost took a photograph from his pocket and passed it to
Westerton. Immediately the latter caught sight of the pictured
face he jumped to his feet excitedly.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! This is Smithson," he shrilled. "Where did
you get this? What is the matter with him? He looks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is dead." interrupted the Inspector. "Who was
Smithson?"</p>

<p>"My chauffeur. At least he was until I dismissed him."</p>

<p>"Has he been missing?"</p>

<p>"Missing? No, I discharged him. He was so insolent. I paid
him his wages and he went away."</p>

<p>"Did you see him again?"</p>

<p>Frost was puzzled. Here, where he expected to solve the
mystery of the dead man of Darlinghurst Road, he was met by a
name only.</p>

<p>"He came back the following day. He was intoxicated and
demanded money. My people turned him out of the grounds."</p>

<p>"Will you give me the date on which you discharged this man,
Smithson?" Frost produced a pocket book.</p>

<p>Westerton touched a bell.</p>

<p>"What date did Smithson leave my employ?" The big man asked
the question of the maid who answered the bell.</p>

<p>"A fortnight ago to-morrow, sir," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"When did you see him last?" Frost asked the question of the
girl, sharply. Before replying, the maid looked at her employer,
who nodded.</p>

<p>"He came here the day after he was dismissed. He was very
drunk and abusive." The answer was given hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Did you see him after that?"</p>

<p>"He was continually about the gates." The girl showed signs
of distress. "He frightened us and we were afraid to go outside
the grounds."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir. He thought we should side with him against Mr.
Westerton. He swore to us, and called us names. We were glad
when he was discharged, for he wasn't a pleasant companion in
the house. He was always drinking, and foolin' about."</p>

<p>"Do you read the newspapers?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Sometimes, sir."</p>

<p>The girl looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Anything in the newspapers of late that interested you?"
asked Frost, carelessly.</p>

<p>"You mean the murder," said the girl slowly, after a
pause.</p>

<p>"Yes. Did you see the portrait of the murdered man, published
in the 'papers?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s." The girl did not appear to understand the drift of
the question, at first. Then realisation came. "You&mdash;you
don't mean that it was he?"</p>

<p>Frost picked up the photograph Westerton had placed on the
wicker table and handed it to the maid. "Do you recognise that?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. That is him. You say&mdash;he is dead?" The girl looked
at the Inspector, questioningly.</p>

<p>"That is the photograph of the man the police found
unconscious in Darlinghurst Road. Do you identify him as
Smithson, the chauffeur lately employed here?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded, agitatedly. Then turned and ran into the
house.</p>

<p>"Upset her a bit," commented Frost, placing the photograph on
the table again.</p>

<p>"Women always get upset at death," said Westerton. "I suppose
you will require me to give evidence at the inquest?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I shall want that girl, also, and others of your
servants. Smithson was murdered and it is possible that one of
your household may be able to provide a clue to the
murderer."</p>

<p>Handing the photograph to the constable, Chalmers, the
Inspector instructed him to interview the servants and obtain
the necessary statements from them.</p>

<p>Chalmers was the only person who had seen the supposed Dr.
Night. He wanted to get him into the house, among the servants.
It was possible the man might pick up some clue to the
mysterious person and also to the other happenings&mdash;matters
he did not at the present time propose to question Westerton
on.</p>

<p>When the constable had left, Frost dropped his official
attitude and lounged back in his chair, talking on general
subjects. In the half-hour of the constable's absence he gained
much information on Westerton's history, entirely unsuspected by
that man.</p>

<p>At length Chalmers returned, and the Inspector rose from his
chair. To his surprise, the fat man rose also and proposed to
accompany them to the entrance gates. This suited Frost. He
turned into the drive running near the "Holmhurst" boundary
wall.</p>

<p>"Fine trees," Frost observed, carelessly pointing to the belt
of trees hiding the Blayde's house from view. "Pity there's that
gap. It will take a long time for a new tree to fill that
space."</p>

<p>"I shall put a big tree there," replied Westerton. "Already
the place is being prepared, and in a few days it will be
planted. It is one from the other side I shall move."</p>

<p>Frost stepped from the drive and crossed the grass to the
trees. Westerton made an involuntary move, as if to stop him!
Frost did not appear to notice the action. Reluctantly, the fat
man followed the detective, and the constable dropped to the
rear. At the foot of the trees the Inspector stopped and looked
about him.</p>

<p>Close at hand it was plain to see that the gap had been
filled by a very large tree. Glancing around him, the Inspector
determined that Doris Blayde could well have seen anyone
standing beneath the trees, and also sufficient of the lawn to
observe anyone going towards the front door. Walking around
carelessly, he soon found the marks of tyres on the soft
turf.</p>

<p>Directly before the detective, stood "Holmhurst," Mr.
Blayde's handsome home. A compact dark-red building, very
English in appearance. On the flat roof rose a quaint little
structure&mdash;evidently the "cosy nook" Doris Blayde had
referred to in her story. Until the new tree was planted the
cosy nook would be an ideal spot from which to keep watch on the
inhabitants of "Forest Home," and Frost had already determined
that household was well worth watching.</p>

<p>"Fine place, that." The Inspector nodded towards 'Holmhurst.'
"S'pose you know who lives there. Of course you would. You've
lived here long enough to know your neighbours."</p>

<p>"Strange to say, I do not know my neighbours," Westerton
laughed slightly. "It happens that I am somewhat of an invalid.
Heart, you know. Not much, but I have to rest a lot. I must have
no fatigue, and neighbours are always fatiguing, you know."</p>

<p>"Sorry." Frost spoke emphatically. "Perhaps you had better
not come down to the gates. Chalmers and I can find our way
out."</p>

<p>The fat man looked uncertain, then held out his hand. "If you
will excuse me, then. I shall always be pleased to see you,
Mr.&mdash;Look out!" Westerton had clutched Frost's arm find
dragged him forward. The detective laughed.</p>

<p>"By Jove! I was nearly in that hole. Funny thing, I never
noticed it. Looks like a grave."</p>

<p>"A grave?" Westerton's face became ashen. Then, with an
effort, he recovered his poise and joined in the Inspector's
laugh. "You are not a cheerful companion, Mr. Frost. First, you
tell me that my late chauffeur has been murdered. Then you say
the hole I am having dug to plant my new tree in is a grave. You
are too morbid."</p>

<p>With his hand pressed to his side, Westerton turned and
walked to the house. Frost stood for some moments watching him,
his lips twisted into a wry smile. Then, motioning to the
constable, he turned and strode to the gates.</p>

<p>"Funny thing, sir," observed the constable, falling in step
alongside his superior officer. "That hole did look like a
grave."</p>

<p>Robert Hardy had not missed an early opportunity of calling
on Doris Blayde and her father. He had two attractions to
"Holmhurst." First, there was the girl, and secondly he had
decided that the Blaydes' house would be an ideal place from
which to watch the household at "Forest Home."</p>

<p>Both Mr. Blayde and his daughter were keenly interested in
the mystery man of Darlinghurst Road and eager to help in every
possible way to bring the murderer to justice.</p>

<p>Within a week, Hardy had been accepted as an intimate friend
of the family. Evening after evening was spent in the "cosy
nook" on the root of "Holmhurst," watching for any move on the
part of the "Forest Home" household, and in idle
conversation.</p>

<p>Gradually these quiet evenings came to mean much to the
journalist. An orphan, he had for years missed the intimate
beauty of home life. The Blaydes had taken him into their
circle, and the long, quiet evenings on the roof had come to
mean much to two of the three gathered there.</p>

<p>The inquest on Charles Richard Smithson, one-time chauffeur
to Francis Westerton, was duly held, and a verdict of wilful
murder against a person or persons unknown recorded. Inspector
Frost had not tried to prove anything more than identification,
and that the man had been poisoned by some unknown person.</p>

<p>On the latter point there was some diversity of opinion
amongst the medical witnesses. Heart disease was mentioned, and
the Crown representative had some difficulty in getting from the
witnesses an admission that the man might have been poisoned.
The medical men were unanimous in stating that, if the dead man
had been poisoned, the poison was unknown to modern science.</p>

<p>Francis Westerton proved a competent witness under
examination. His evidence was given tersely and well. The
deceased had been his chauffeur. He had discharged him for
drunkenness and insolence. The next day Smithson had called at
"Forest Home" in a state of intoxication and had insisted on an
interview with him. At that interview he had uttered vague
threats and had demanded money. He had been promptly expelled
the house and grounds. Witness had seen the deceased on the day
previous to him being discovered in an unconscious condition in
Darlinghurst Road.</p>

<p>The next witness was the maid Frost had questioned on his
call at "Forest Home."</p>

<p>She gave her name as Mary Gannett, and under searching
examination admitted that she had seen the deceased, Smithson,
on the evening before he had been found unconscious.</p>

<p>After his dismissal Smithson had hung about the gates at
"Forest Home." The witness had seen him several times.</p>

<p>At first, he was intoxicated and abusive of Mr. Westerton.
Later, he was quieter, the witness thought, because he had spent
all his money. She had spoken to him several times, advising him
to leave the neighbourhood and to get work.</p>

<p>The evening before he had been found unconscious he had
beckoned her to come down to the gates. He had told her that he
had had nothing to eat that day. She had left him to obtain some
food from the cook for a "poor man at the gates." She had given
him money on his promising not to spend it in drink. He had
continued to utter threats against Mr. Westerton. Just before he
had left her that evening he said that she was a good girl and
that he would reward her now that he had the old bird,
Westerton, under his thumb.</p>

<p>He was quite sober then, Francis Westerton recalled, said
that he could not imagine what the deceased had meant by stating
that he had him, the witness, under his thumb. Smithson had no
hold over him. His life was an open book. He had no secrets.</p>

<p>"It may be an open book to him," grumbled Frost, when going
over the evidence with Thomas and Hardy at the <i>Mirror</i>
Office. "It's Greek to me."</p>

<p>"Greek may be an open book, Frost." Hardy laughed. "The one
trouble in reading it is to know the language. You have had
Westerton looked up?"</p>

<p>"Two-and-a-half years in Sydney. Came from England. Appears
to have plenty of money. Invested heavily in Government stocks.
Does not speculate, drinks moderately, does not play golf or any
other game, so far as I know. Doesn't attend races or any sports
meetings. Hasn't any business or profession. Doesn't attend
church, theatres, pictures, shows or concerts. Has a powerful
wireless, but only uses it on occasions. Has only two daily
newspapers delivered at the house. Doesn't buy books,
periodicals or magazines. Smokes a lot in spite of his bad heart
he talks about, and is not under the advice of a doctor. Has an
enormous post, mainly from abroad. I have had it examined and it
appears to be mainly from personal friends. Very few commercial
letters."</p>

<p>"A very negative person," laughed Thomas. "You don't seem to
have struck on his hobbies or pursuits, Frost."</p>

<p>"He has one hobby," remarked Hardy, quietly. "He has a
partiality for midnight motor-rides."</p>

<p>"What's that?" exclaimed Frost.</p>

<p>"Westerton has the habit of leaving home about 10.30 at night
and driving out towards South Head. These journeys are not
regular&mdash;except that he invariably starts at 10.30 and
travels in the same direction."</p>

<p>"Where does he go?" demanded Frost. "Have you followed
him?"</p>

<p>"I followed him one night," replied the journalist. "The trip
appeared aimless and harmless. Something in the nature of a
joy-ride."</p>

<p>"Who drives the car?"</p>

<p>"Westerton, himself."</p>

<p>"Does he stop anywhere? Speak to anyone along the road?"</p>

<p>"Stops a good deal: seems to enjoy the view across the
harbour. Once or twice he has offered persons on foot a lift.
Sometimes he will stop the car, and sit yarning with some
chance-met acquaintance, or stranger."</p>

<p>"On what days are these journeys taken?" asked Frost, after a
lengthy pause.</p>

<p>"Absolutely irregular," Hardy replied. "Mr. Blayde first
informed me of this habit of Westerton's and then I watched. I
saw Westerton leave 'Forest Home' twice on these trips. Appears
to take a run when he feels so inclined."</p>

<p>For a long time the detective remained silent, a heavy frown
on his face. At length he appeared to have made up his mind to a
course of action.</p>

<p>"What line are you working on, Hardy?" he asked.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">THE journalist's face flushed. Lately the
pursuit of the mysterious Dr. Night had given place to a more
interesting occupation. The watching from the cosy nook on the
roof of "Holmhurst," seated beside Doris Blayde, had come to be
much more interesting than criminology.</p>

<p>"Only night watching," Hardy replied, hastily. Then added;
"That and trying to get a line on Westerton's movements during
the day."</p>

<p>"You think these mid-night motorcar trips have a definite
end?"</p>

<p>"If Westerton drove out regular intervals. I should say
'yes,'" replied the journalist, slowly. "At present I can only
see the aimless fad of a wealthy man in them. Yet, somehow, they
seem too aimless."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," interjected the detective, sharply. "They
are too aimless to be honest. What do you think of Westerton,
Bob?"</p>

<p>"I don't like him."</p>

<p>"Spoken to him?"</p>

<p>"Three or four times. I made it my business to get on
speaking terms with him."</p>

<p>"He says he is English born, but has lived a long time in
America."</p>

<p>"English-born," repeated Frost, quietly.</p>

<p>"Why, the man's a German," exploded Hardy. "Speaks good
English, I admit, but sometimes he frames his sentences as if he
were translating from his native tongue."</p>

<p>"I wondered if you had noticed that," Frost laughed shortly.
"I noticed the same thing when I first interviewed him. He's not
English, I'll swear to that."</p>

<p>"Looks as if the mystery of the dead man of Darlinghurst Road
is to go on the slate as another unsolved New South Wales
murder," mused Thomas. He was watching the detective closely
from beneath his half-closed eyelids. "There's quite a number of
them, now."</p>

<p>Journalist and detective swung angrily towards the managing
editor of the <i>Mirror</i>.</p>

<p>"There's no chalking this up, Mr. Thomas," exclaimed the
detective angrily. "If I have to resign from the department, I
camp on this trail to the end."</p>

<p>"The same thing goes with me, Mr. Thomas." Hardy's face was
flushed. "I'll get to the bottom of this business."</p>

<p>"Then make a note of these joyrides. When you have half-a-dozen
of them recorded, find out what happened on land or sea,
corresponding to them."</p>

<p>"What do you know, sir?" asked the journalist, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I know that I have to get the <i>Mirror</i> out for to-morrow,
and that you and Frost are blocking my work."</p>

<p>Then as the two men rose to leave the room, Thomas added; "I
have a hunch as you call it, Bob, that the Harbour may be a
strong point in the solution of the Westerton joy-rides.
Good-night to both of you."</p>

<p>The journalist was particularly silent when he and the
detective reached his room in the <i>Mirror</i> building. For
some time he wandered about the room, picking up things and
looking at them in a vacant way.</p>

<p>At length he swung round on Frost, who was seated in a lounge
chair, idly scanning some proof matter.</p>

<p>"Will you get someone to follow Westerton on his next
joy-ride, Frost?" he exclaimed suddenly, halting in his walk
before the seated Inspector.</p>

<p>"Sure. What's the game, Bob?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to explore 'Forest Home,'" replied the journalist.
"Next time Westerton goes out, I'm going to get into that house,
somehow. Get your man to make a map of the route Westerton
takes. Time him at all points where he stops&mdash;how long he
remains at each place."</p>

<p>"What about the persons he speaks to?" asked Frost
curiously.</p>

<p>"Immaterial, so far as I see for the time being. The Chief
had a hunch when he gave us that tip about the Harbour. I'm
going to follow it and will give the house and the grounds a
close-up at the same time."</p>

<p>"Well, good luck, Bob, I've some other matters to look into.
Seems the dope trade is looking up in Sydney and the
Commissioner is yelling blue murder."</p>

<p>"Huh!" Hardy swung round to face the Inspector. "What's that
you're saying?"</p>

<p>"Only that the dope trade is looking up again." Frost laughed
at Hardy's sudden interest, yet he was suddenly alert. "There's
always a fair dope trade through this city we don't seem to be
able to hobble. Lately it has grown, considerably, in spite of
the large number of runners our men have picked up of late. The
Chief has asked me to take a hand in the matter."</p>

<p>"Look here, Frost," exclaimed the journalist, excitedly.
"Have you forgotten young Bill Matthews? What about getting the
police of Melbourne to look him up? Get a line on his cobbers
and amusements?"</p>

<p>"Still following the story? All right. Bob. I'll have a word
sent down to them. Don't get in trouble over your explorings. If
you're caught&mdash;" The Inspector made an expressive
gesture.</p>

<p>"I'll take my medicine," laughed Hardy as he parted from the
detective and made his way to the <i>Mirror</i> record
rooms.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he left the building with a large roll of
newspapers under his arm and caught the Darlinghurst tram at
Queen's Square.</p>

<p>The long night watches from the roof of "Holmhurst" had not
resulted in any important discovery making towards the solution
of the mystery of the solution of the dead man of Darlinghurst
Road. Twice, since he had taken up the watch, had Hardy seen
Westerton start on his mysterious night rides. Aimless, they
appeared to be; the whim of a rich man to whom night and day
were indifferent.</p>

<p>Yet one fact appeared significant&mdash;these journeys always
commenced exactly at half-past ten at night. On the second
occasion on which the journalist had seen the man next door
start on a journey, Westerton had left the "Forest Home" garage
a few minutes early. He had appeared to realise this by the time
he had reached the road and had stopped the car and sat in it
idly until the church clock had chimed the half-hour. Then he
had driven on.</p>

<p>Impatient at the long inaction, Hardy had determined to
search the grounds of "Forest Home" the next time Westerton left
on one of his mysterious car-rides. For some days he had
searched the grounds of "Forest Home" through powerful
field-glasses from the roof of "Holmhurst," but the view was too
restricted. With Westerton away, he did not fear to be
discovered by the servants.</p>

<p>Doris Blayde vigorously opposed the proposed expedition,
declaring it was risky, and that if the journalist was
discovered, it was liable to arouse suspicion that "Forest Home"
was under police observation; but Hardy was certain that no
regular watch was kept by the household of "Forest Home," and
that with the master away the servants would not trouble even if
they had a suspicion that someone was prowling about the
grounds. Further, he had decided on a late hour of the night for
his proposed expedition.</p>

<p>Two nights after Hardy had determined to search the grounds
of the house next door, Westerton started on one of his
mysterious car rides. About twenty minutes past ten, the
journalist noticed one of the servants walk down to the gates
and swing them open. Five minutes later he heard the sound of
the car being driven out of the garage on to the drive. Then,
exactly at the chiming of the half-hour from the church clock,
Westerton drove the car out on the road and went in the
direction of Rushcutter's Bay. The servant closed the gates and
returned to the house.</p>

<p>Hardy waited a quarter of an hour and then slipped from
"Holmhurst" by the side door and crept down to the boundary wall
between the two houses. Earlier in the evening, Hardy had drawn
a small iron table under the boundary wall, opposite the spot
where the gap occurred in the belt of trees. Mounting on the
table, Hardy peered over the wall. A light was still burning on
the ground floor.</p>

<p>Hardy waited, and ten minutes later the light was
extinguished. A few minutes and lights began to appear in the
upper story of the house. Hardy calculated that he would have a
little over half an hour before Westerton would return from his
ride. In that time he proposed to thoroughly explore the grounds
of the house, but to leave any attempt to penetrate the house
itself to a later date.</p>

<p>A quick spring and the journalist was over the wall and
crouching in the shadows. From there he carefully examined his
surroundings. Then, satisfied that no one was watching, he
skirmished along the boundary wall until he reached the big
gates. Crossing the open patch of ground rapidly he continued
along the iron railings fronting the road, dodging from bush to
bush.</p>

<p>At the far side he found a short wall from the iron gates
leading down to the water's edge. The wall was considerably
shorter than the dividing wall between "Holmhurst" and "Forest
Home." It took him but a few minutes to traverse its full
length. Then he returned to the road, and, taking every
precaution to prevent being seen by any passer-by, returned to
the gap in the trees, close by where he had entered the
grounds.</p>

<p>He now had a fair knowledge of the geography of the grounds.
"Forest Home" was situated on the edge of the Harbour. The piece
of ground comprised about four acres, the house being situated
on the edge of a small cliff that overlooked the water. Along
each boundary wall stood a belt of fine trees, and between them
lay well kept lawns set out with flower beds. A heart-shaped
drive surrounded the centre lawns, and between the drive and the
tree belts were long stretches of narrow lawns and flower and
shrub beds.</p>

<p>On the water side of the house the belts of trees had been
trained towards the wings of the house, and hid the edge of the
cliff and the water view from persons on the road and drive. On
the "Holmhurst" side this belt of trees came within ten feet of
the walls of the house, and some of the branches overhung the
wide verandahs and reached almost to the windows.</p>

<p>Keeping well within the shadow of the trees, Hardy walked
towards the eastern wing of the house. Passing through the trees
there he came out on the edge of the cliff. It was about fifty
feet high, and from the house paths had been cut in the solid
rock down to a patch of lawn and shrubbery at the edge of the
water. The belt of trees narrowed until they were only
sufficiently thick to hide the boundary wall. It was along this
waterfront that Hardy had determined he would make any
discoveries leading to a solution of the mysteries that appeared
to surround "Forest Home" and its owner.</p>

<p>The rear of the house appeared to be quiet. None of the
windows showed light, and the narrow terrace on the edge of the
cliff lay silent and deserted in the dim light of the moon.
Dodging back amid the shelter of the trees, the journalist found
the boundary wall again and, with some damage to his clothing
and person, climbed down the cliff until he stood on the piece
of ground bordering the water front, and in the shelter of the
trees. From there he could see the rook-steps leading down to
the lower level from the house. The lower lawns, were laid out
in a tennis court, bounded by a large expanse of grass. A high
netting surrounded the tennis court, and beneath the small cliff
and just outside the netting stood a summer-house of rustic
work. At one side, near the boundary wall of "Holmhurst," was a
large boat-house. A space of seven or eight feet between the
boat-house and the boundary wall was apparently filled by high
bushes.</p>

<p>For some time Hardy stood in the shade of the trees,
examining his surroundings. So far as he could discover, he was
alone in the grounds. Yet someone might be seated in the rustic
house, and any untoward movement on his part would lead to his
detection. It was necessary that he should discover,
immediately, if anyone was in the summer-house.</p>

<p>The boat-house and the patch of bush between it and the
boundary wall intrigued him. It was necessary to satisfy himself
that the summer-house was vacant. Yet, to approach it, was to
leave himself open to observation from the boat-house and the
queer bit of land beside it.</p>

<p>The journalist was facing a dilemma. Both courses of action
were dangerous. At that moment a dark cloud slid over the face
of the moon. For a time the grounds of "Forest Home" were
drenched in gloom. Acting on instinct, Hardy ran silently
towards the boat-house. When the moonlight again flooded the
scene, he was standing in the shadows of the building.</p>

<p>Slowly and with the greatest caution the journalist crept
towards the patch of ground beside the party wall. At the corner
of the house he peered round, and swiftly caught his breath.
From where he stood the sheltering bushes had been trimmed away.
The patch of ground was not filled with flowering bushes as he
had supposed, when examining it from a distance. A space had
been cleared in the centre and in that space stood a small iron
table and a couple of chairs. It was a hidden observation post,
from whence a watch could be kept on the Harbour.</p>

<p>The waterfront was guarded by low, thick bushes, overhanging
the water, yet so trimmed that a person seated in the hidden
nook would have a fairly free outlook over the Harbour, while
securely sheltered from observation. On the land side the
sheltering bushes just overlapped the corner of the boat-shed
foliage.</p>

<p>The outlook had been used very recently. On the table stood
bottles and glasses, still containing liquor. A box of cigars
was on the table, half-opened, and the ashtrays were well
filled. A biscuit box had the lid propped against its side, and
beside it an open book lay face down. It was not a place anyone
would choose to pass an idle hour. It was an observation post
only, too confined, and on a hot day would be uncomfortably
oppressive. It was concealed where one could keep a watch on the
shipping of the harbour and receive, if not send, signals to the
shipping passing or at anchor.</p>

<p>The place was vacant. The journalist entered it boldly and
seated himself in one of the chairs. As he had reasoned, the
chair commanded a wonderful view of the Harbour. Hardy looked
around himself. At his right hand, almost within reach, was a
low door, shut, but the padlock fastening it was loose. Hardy
picked up one of the clean glasses and helped himself to a
liberal allowance of whisky. A soda syphon stood handy and he
filled the glass with the effervescent water. He was badly in
need of a drink and looked longingly at the open box of cigars.
He could do with a smoke, but that was too dangerous.</p>

<p>Why should Westerton have a concealed outlook over the
Harbour? Why had he had a door out in the wall of the boat-house
in such a position that anyone watching in the nook could
quickly escape into the boat-house if some skiff on the water
came too close, or felt inquisitive regarding the clump of
bushes?</p>

<p>Hardy was irritated. The mystery of this house and its owner
was growing, instead of becoming solved. Francis Westerton was
not Dr. Night. He was convinced of that; yet the owner of
"Forest Home" was fast becoming as mysterious as the little
"gray man" who had commanded him not to proceed with his
investigations into the death of the mystery man of Darlinghurst
road. Westerton had called himself an Englishman, yet he used
idioms that would only be used by a person of Teutonic
extraction.</p>

<p>Mysteries had solutions; yet this house, and the grounds
surrounding it, teemed with small inconsequences that bordered on
the realms of unsolved mystery. There was nothing tangible.
Westerton might be one of those innocent foreigners who prefer
to live under an alien flag to the petty inconveniences of life
in their native lands. The house and grounds might be entirely
innocent of harbouring criminal activities. There was nothing
definite, yet a hundred unexplainable trifles surrounded the
place; little trivialities that pointed definitely, yet
inconsequently, towards the dead man of Darlinghurst Road, and
his identity.</p>

<p>Westerton had driven away and would not return for the better
part of an hour. For that time the journalist could continue his
search&mdash;if Westerton was acting entirely on his own. But
Hardy was coming to the belief that the big man was but one of a
gang inhabiting "Forest Home." If that was so, then he was in a
dangerous position.</p>

<p>Discretion urged a quick retreat, even if retreat meant long
hours spent crouching beneath the trees and shrubs, waiting for
Westerton and his confederates to reveal themselves and the
mystery of their actions.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">THE door leading into the boat-house intrigued
the journalist. Quickly he placed a hand on it and pulled. The
door was fast, in spite of the dangling padlock. A stronger
pull, and the door remained firm. Hardy drew a pencil flash from
his pocket and threw a thin beam of light on the door. Just
above the padlock was a small latch. Pressing this, the door
swung silently open.</p>

<p>Hardy entered and drew the door closed behind him. The
boat-house was a long, somewhat narrow structure, part of it
overhanging the water. There were no boats in it, and from what
he could see there had not been boats sheltered in it for a long
time.</p>

<p>He was standing on a wooden floor about the size of an
ordinary room. Out towards the harbour he could see the glint of
water behind the closed water-gates. Above his head hung three
powerful electric globes with strong reflectors.</p>

<p>Here was more mystery. A boat-house that did not contain a
boat and had not harboured boats for some considerable time. The
journalist pressed the button of his torch again and swept the
light slowly round the room. In the centre of the room stood a
long bench, covered with various packages and a litter of
apparatus. Around the walls had been built shelving, and these
were filled with apparatus and packages.</p>

<p>Hardy walked slowly around the room, letting his light play
on the various articles. Westerton had evidently a catholic
taste in chemistry, for most of the apparatus related to
chemical research.</p>

<p>Close by the water edge stood three huge packing cases. Two
of them were empty and the third was open, but still retained
part of its contents. The packing straw and paper were still
scattered around the cases. Hardy groped down in the case. It
appeared to be filled with small round, smooth objects. With
some trouble he prised one from its place, and stood upright.
The object was wrapped in paper.</p>

<p>The journalist started to uncover it.</p>

<p>Something hit him hard over the head, and he felt himself
falling&mdash;down down&mdash;faster and faster he slipped down
a long, long slide&mdash;and then oblivion.</p>

<p>The long, slow slide downwards ceased and oblivion came as a
period of gentle rest. Then painfully, and with a queer,
underlying agony, succeeded the upward lift to consciousness.
The tug upwards became stronger and swifter, and Hardy felt a
long smooth rocking of his body. He was lying on something soft;
something that yielded to every motion of his body; and part of
it felt loose. It was as if, by some means, part of his skull
had fallen away leaving the delicate, sensitive nerves
exposed.</p>

<p>The long, lazy, swinging motion continued. Hardy felt that he
could lie there and sleep for hours. Something splashed on his
face, and he was too uninterested to lift his hand to wipe it
away. It was water. All too slowly, he came to realise that he
was in the water. The swaying he had felt was the long roll of
the tide.</p>

<p>Something was holding him tight around the neck. His collar
was choking him. He put up a hand and found a small cold hand
twisted into the limp dampness of his collar. A voice, dimly
familiar, was calling to him.</p>

<p>"Bob! Bob!" The voice called desperately. "Oh, do wake up,
Bob! Do wake up!"</p>

<p>Now he remembered. It was Doris' voice. What was she doing
here? She had no business here! He couldn't quite remember where
they were, but it was not right for her to be there; he was
certain of that. It was night and quite late, and the water was
so soothing and restful. He wanted to sleep.</p>

<p>Now Doris was pouring water over him. Some of it splashed
into his mouth, and it was quite salt. Besides, she was making
him wet. Something bumped his head. He became angry for it had
hit the place where it seemed that his brain lay exposed. One of
his hands caught the edge of a boat. He opened his eyes.</p>

<p>Yes! it was the edge of a boat. What was it doing there and
why was he in the water and not in the boat? The hand let go of
his collar and he could breathe more freely. Then the small
hands grasped his hands and tugged hard.</p>

<p>"Bob! Bob! Help yourself! Creep into the boat while I balance
it. Oh, Bob&mdash;" Doris was calling to him.</p>

<p>He looked up, into her eyes. She was looking down at him from
over the side of a small skiff. With a big effort he threw off
the inertia that was holding him. Doris was calling to him for
help! With a big effort he raised his other hand to catch the
edge of the skiff.</p>

<p>Something was in it. He dropped the object into the bottom of
the boat; and then caught hold of the edge.</p>

<p>Doris had disappeared; but he could still hear her calling to
him to get into the boat.</p>

<p>Exerting every remaining ounce of his strength, he lifted
himself from the water and rolled over into the bottom of the
skiff.</p>

<p>"Quick, Bob!" Doris was shaking him roughly. "Quick, or they
will catch us!"</p>

<p>The girl's low voice was a call to action. Hardy struggled to
clear his senses. Mistily, his head in a whirl, he sat up in the
bottom of the boat. Doris was struggling with an oar over his
head. Reaching up a shaky hand, he guided it into the rowlock.
Then his fingers met hers, and held.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob!" It was all the girl could say. A long, lingering
clasp and she withdrew her fingers. Drawing himself up on the
seat by the thwarts of the boat, Hardy caught at the oars. For a
minute the boat, and the surrounding waters, danced an insane
jig before his eyes.</p>

<p>Gradually things steadied, and, feebly at first, but stronger
after a few strokes, he started to paddle towards the
"Holmhurst" boatshed.</p>

<p>"Quick, Bob," whispered the girl. "He is getting a boat
out."</p>

<p>"Not a boat there, old thing." Hardy laughed almost wildly,
as he bent to the oars. "Did you see anything?"</p>

<p>"Only a man with a tail," replied Doris shakily.</p>

<p>"A what?" Hardy stopped rowing, to gaze at the girl, in
amazement. "It's been too much for you, dear. I'll have to get
you home at once. You're&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm all right, Bob." The girl laughed, slightly hysterically
"I really did see a man with a tail."</p>

<p>"You mean a man with a pig-tail," corrected Hardy, after a
moment's thought. "I've never seen a 'Chink' at 'Forest Home,'
though."</p>

<p>"There isn't one," declared Doris, positively. "And the thing
I saw carried its tail in the usual place; not at the top of his
neck."</p>

<p>"Wonder if there's anything of an ape-kind about the place?"
mused Hardy.</p>

<p>"But it was a man," insisted Doris, "It was a man with a
tail. A real man, I mean."</p>

<p>Then the girl burst out laughing, wildly. Hardy looked
anxiously at her. The strain of the past few hours had been too
much for her. He was terribly afraid of feminine hysteria.</p>

<p>"It sounds absurd. 'A man with a tail'." Doris laughed. "But,
Bob, I did see him, and at the time I was not looking for
anything out of the way."</p>

<p>"What were you doing out in the boat?" asked the journalist,
anxious to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Watching you," retorted the girl, promptly. "When you
climbed over the wall I wanted to follow, but I knew that you
would send me back. So I went up to the cosy nook and tried to
follow you through the night glasses. But, I could see nothing.
Then I remembered that the boat was afloat. So I ran down to the
boat-house and found the oars, hoping to be able to keep a watch
on you from the water. For a long time I watched and saw
nothing. Then the lights went up in the boat-house and I saw the
man with the tail. He was bending over something lying on the
ground. After a time he picked it up and carried it to the water
and threw it in. I rowed down to see what it was that he had
thrown into the Harbour, and&mdash;and found you, Bob,
and&mdash;and you&mdash;you wouldn't answer me when I called you
Bob."</p>

<p>Hardy was silent for some minutes. Doris had saved his life,
and she had seen something that he had not seen. The man with
the tail puzzled him, but he did not doubt her now. She had seen
what she had described. It had not been hysteria, for she had
seen the man with the tail before she had realised that the
"something" thrown into the Harbour was his unconscious body.
Swinging the head of the boat round, Hardy let the tide drift it
down the Harbour, past "Forest Home" grounds. The house and the
boatshed were in darkness. The man with the tail, if he existed
outside Doris' imagination, had disappeared, but now the
journalist was certain that the freak existed.</p>

<p>Urging the boat round against the tide, Hardy passed the
point and then let it drift down again past the "Forest Home"
boatshed. A few strokes and he came again to the observation
post. He shipped the oars and caught at one of the overhanging
branches. "Hold this, Doris," he whispered, as he passed the
bough to the girl. Then he stepped out of the boat and waded to
the shore. From where he had landed, he could peer between the
branches into the observation post, beside the boatshed.</p>

<p>As he had expected, it was deserted. The door into the
boat-house was shut and the padlock fastened. Whoever had discovered
him in the boat-house and struck him down, had been satisfied he
had disposed of him for good, and had not waited.</p>

<p>A low whistle from the girl in the boat, recalled Hardy. Time
was passing fast and Doris was anxious to get back to her father
before he noticed her absence and became worried.</p>

<p>Hardy stepped into the boat again, and pulled up to the
"Holmhurst" boatshed. There he made the boat fast, and, carrying
the oars into the shed, looked them up. Then Doris and he walked
up the tiny path to the house. At one of the angles of the steps
they had a fine view of the waterside of "Forest Home," between
the trees.</p>

<p>"A house of mystery," observed Hardy, meditatively. "I wonder
if we shall ever untangle the skein?" Doris pressed his hand in
silent sympathy.</p>

<p>While they stood there the sound of a motor horn was heard
from the front of the house. Then followed the soft grind of
tyres on loose gravel.</p>

<p>"Mr. Westerton," whispered Doris. "We got back just in time."
Listening intently they could almost follow the actions of the
motorist. They heard the car backed into the garage and then the
big doors rolled into place. As they went to move on, they
glanced up at the windows of the house next door.</p>

<p>"Look!" Doris clasped her hand over her mouth. She was
pointing Hardy's hand towards the windows of "Forest Home."</p>

<p>One of them had been suddenly illuminated, As they watched, a
man's shadow was thrown on the blind. He was standing facing the
window. A thin narrow man with sloping shoulders. Even in the
position in which he was standing it was possible to see that
his shoulders were bent. It was the outline of a man who had
spent many years in study. In no one particular did it resemble
the burly outline of the master of "Forest Home."</p>

<p>The shadow grew smaller and the outline more distinct. Then,
slowly, the shadow turned. They saw the bend of the bowed
shoulders and the poise of the scholarly head. The figure was
shrouded in a long loose cloak from its throat. Slowly the
garment slipped from the figure's shoulders to the ground. As it
did, Doris gave a little gasping shriek.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">SHE had not been mistaken. At "Forest Home"
lives a man with a tail. Hardy could see it plainly. It curved
out from the figure, gradually arching up to the tip. The girl's
fingers bit into the journalist's arm. Then she began to sob,
hiding her face on Hardy's sleeve.</p>

<p>The figure moved away from the window, towards the centre of
the room. As it moved it increased in size until it appeared
almost gigantic. Then it appeared to lift something from the
table, with both hands. For a few seconds it stood motionless,
then it raised the object high in the air with both hands, and
lowered it on its head. In some way the thing looked like an
inverted flowerpot, made of some pliant material. Again the
figure approached the window, only to vanish as if blotted out
by some magic power, leaving the window illuminated only by the
unbroken glow of the light.</p>

<p>Placing his arm around the girl's waist, Hardy supported her
to the house. On the doorstep they lingered awhile, Doris trying
to compose her nerves, in case she met her father on her way to
her room.</p>

<p>When he left her, the journalist walked towards the entrance
gates. He had not proceeded far when he was recalled by a low
whistle. Doris met him on the drive.</p>

<p>"Bob," whispered the girl. "You threw this into the boat
to-night, when I found you." She pressed a small, hard object into
his hand, and then, with a hurried word of farewell, ran into
the house.</p>

<p>Hardy stepped into a patch of moonlight and looked at the
object the girl had given him. In his hand lay a small bottle of
glass about two inches long and half an inch in diameter. For a
moment he looked at it in amazement. Then he remembered. It was
similar to the bottle he had found on the table of his
sitting-room, some days before; it was the fellow of the bottle
Dr. Streatham had shown him at the Sydney Hospital.</p>

<p>Hardy opened the bottle and smelt the interior. It was empty
and had apparently not been used. In that particular alone, it
differed from the bottle Dr. Streatham had shown him, and one
mysteriously sent to him. Both those bottles held cocaine. This
bottle, empty now, would certainly have been used by the drug
fiends inhabiting "Forest Home" at some time to hold the illicit
drug they were smuggling into Australia.</p>

<p>His luck had held. Accident following accident had led him to
the goal he sought. At "Forest Home" he had found the bottle,
and at "Forest Home" he would, sooner or later, find the
solution to the various mysteries that had followed the
discovery of the body of the man, Smithson, in Darlinghurst
Road.</p>

<p>The apparition of "The Man with the Tail" in the upper room
of "Forest Home" greatly perplexed Robert Hardy. The
investigations he had carried out in the grounds and the
boatshed had proved to him that the place was being used by a
gang of illicit drug smugglers. He had in his possession
sufficient evidence to persuade the police to raid the place.
Once inside the house, without warning, he was convinced that
evidence would be forthcoming to secure convictions for all
found on the premises.</p>

<p>The knowledge that "Forest Home" was the headquarters of and
gang of crooks was satisfactory in so far as it justified the
suspicions that the journalist had held of the house and its
owner, Francis Westerton.</p>

<p>But Hardy realised that he had not advanced one inch in the
solution of the death of Smithson in Darlinghurst Road; and the
identity of the mysterious Dr. Night had still to be discovered.
Westerton was not Dr. Night, and since the evening when that
master-criminal had telephoned the <i>Mirror</i> Offices and
made virtual confession of his complicity in the death of
Smithson, he had vanished into thin air.</p>

<p>The journalist was working on the theory that the pursuit of
Francis Westerton and his activities would lead to the lair of
the master-criminal, Dr. Night.</p>

<p>Inspector Frost's report of the interviews on the verandah
and in the grounds of "Forest Home," had induced the suspicion
that Westerton was not the master-mind of the gang inhabiting
the house. Hardy held a suspicion that behind the scenes lurked
Dr. Night either living in seclusion at "Forest Home" or
visiting there at frequent intervals.</p>

<p>The night rides indulged in by Westerton gave colour to that
theory. Dr. Night well might be brought to the house, and taken
therefrom, concealed in the car. The regularity of the time of
leaving "Forest Home" could be explained by the fact that the
car was met at an appointed spot by another car, for the
transference of the passenger. Such a procedure would certainly
prevent the two places frequented by Dr. Night being
connected.</p>

<p>Following this line of reasoning, Hardy asked himself: Is
Dr. Night "The Man with the Tail" Doris and he had seen shadowed
on the blind of the upper room at "Forest Home?" It was
possible; and from the seclusion Dr. Night had apparently
adopted, very probable.</p>

<p>Then, who was Dr. Night? Was he a freak of nature; a deformed
intelligence; seeking to work ill on humanity, as revenge for
Nature's endowment of abnormality? Such an explanation fitted
into the puzzle&mdash;but it was only a theory. By hook or crook
the journalist determined to gain admission to "Forest Home" and
to prove his theory right or wrong.</p>

<p>To visit the house would serve him little. He would not be
allowed to wander about at his will. The only course was to
obtain admission unknown to Francis Westerton and his household.
To do that he would have to place himself outside the law.
Detection would mean imprisonment, and although he stood on
intimate terms with the Police Department, he could not look for
any relaxation of the laws. That would be impossible, for
Westerton would certainly press for his punishment; and neither
his newspaper nor the police could refuse, or plead complicity
without raising a storm of public indignation against the
invasion of the privacy of a citizen's home.</p>

<p>Hardy found the Inspector waiting for him in his room at the
<i>Mirror</i> Offices when he arrived the following morning.
Frost met him with the news that William Matthews had been
arrested at Fitzroy, a Melbourne suburb, the previous day.</p>

<p>"How is that going to help us?" asked the journalist.</p>

<p>"We've taken him on a charge of consorting with persons of
doubtful character, and being without visible means of support,"
replied the Inspector shortly. "After appearing before the
Victorian magistrate, he will be remanded to Sydney on a warrant
I have caused to be issued. When he gets here we will persuade
him to explain a lot of things."</p>

<p>"Particularly?" queried Hardy.</p>

<p>"I want to know if he was connected with Smithson."</p>

<p>"Matthews will have a lot more than that to explain when he
comes to Sydney," observed the journalist thoughtfully. "I want
the inner story of the shooting up of his mother's flat; and
that means the story of his connections with the snow-runners of
this city."</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>The Inspector hesitated, then continued: "Truth is, Bob, the
story's got me bluffed. The Chief asked me this morning who Dr.
Night is, and I had to confess that I hadn't the ghost of an
idea, beyond the fact that he had a lot to do with the death of
Smithson."</p>

<p>"Dr. Night is the head of the illicit drug traffic of
Sydney," replied Hardy quickly. "Who, and what, he is, I cannot
even guess. He is covered too well, but I'm just beginning to
understand how he is operating."</p>

<p>Frost was immediately interested.</p>

<p>The journalist then recounted in detail his adventures in the
grounds of "Forest Home," the previous night, finishing his
story with the vision of "The Man With the Tail," seen by Doris
and on the blind of the room at "Forest Home."</p>

<p>"How you can hope to work out from that the line of operation
of these crooks is more than I can understand," remarked the
detective, when Hardy had concluded. "All I can gather is that
someone was trying to play the goat with you."</p>

<p>"The case of bottles in the boatshed is sufficient on which
to base the theory that 'Forest Home' is the headquarters of the
illicit drug smugglers of Sydney," retorted Hardy. "You
remember, a similar bottle was placed in my room for some
purpose. Both Chaffers, the chemist, and Dr. Streatham, of the
Sydney Hospital, are positive that the drug runners are selling
the dope in those bottles."</p>

<p>"By the bye, Bob," interjected the Inspector, "I think you
should bring that bottle down to headquarters. There might be
something about it that would give us a clue."</p>

<p>Hardy thought for a moment. He had a strange reluctance to
bring the bottle into the business at that stage.</p>

<p>"No," he said positively. "That bottle is too innocent,
Frost. It's locked up in my rooms, and I'm opposed to anyone
touching it until we know more about it than we do now. Besides,
we have no knowledge whatever that it is connected with either
Dr. Night, or Smithson. It may be a practical joke that someone
is trying to put over me. Anyhow, that bottle stays where it is
until we know more. Now, do you remember Mr. Thomas tipping me
to compare Westerton's mysterious journeys with happenings on
'land and sea'?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I obtained from Mr. Blayde a list of the dates on which
Westerton had taken night motor-rides. A search through the
files of the <i>Mirror</i> resulted in the fact that the motor
rides coincide with the arrivals of ships from Asia."</p>

<p>"That's a point," exclaimed the Inspector with great
satisfaction. "I'm going to have that car searched next time he
goes out."</p>

<p>Hardy did not think any good would result from any such
search. While there might be a connection between the arrival of
eastern shipping and the mysterious motor-rides of Francis
Westerton, it would be improbable that the gang would attempt to
convey, the drugs from the ship to "Forest Home" by such
methods, it was too open for suspicion.</p>

<p>The boatshed offered the better route for the smuggling of
the drugs. On dark nights the conveyance of the smuggled drugs
by water would be almost absolutely safe from detection. Men
disguised as fishermen could, without suspicion, visit the
vessels at the wharves and then drop casually down the shores to
the boat-house. The water police would be entirely unsuspicious,
and the presence of a fair haul of fish in the boat, an
excellent cover.</p>

<p>Yet the journalist did not attempt to dissuade the detective
from his proposed search of Westerton's car. He did not believe
it would result in any tangible evidence, but it would give him
a free hand to conduct the examination of "Forest Home." He had
already made up his mind that he must take all risks and force
an entrance to the house of mystery.</p>

<p>It was late that night before Hardy made his way to the gates
of "Forest Home." He had not called at the Blayde's house, as he
was certain that if Doris knew of his proposed adventure she
would bitterly oppose him taking the risk, or else demand some
share in the adventure. That was impossible.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">THE grounds of "Forest Home" lay silent and
deserted in the waning light of the moon when he arrived at the
gates. The road was deserted, and after a swift look round, the
journalist scaled the wall and dropped into the shadows of the
trees. Cautiously, he skirted the boundary wall down to the
boat-house. On both sides the house was in darkness.</p>

<p>Was Westerton at home, or had he gone for one of his
mysterious motor drives? More than probably the gangster was at
home. At no time had he taken his motor trips on two consecutive
nights.</p>

<p>Hardy had determined to risk this. From what the Inspector
had told him, there seemed to be quite a number of servants in
the house. The presence of Westerton would add but little to the
risk he was running.</p>

<p>The outlook between the boundary wall and the boat-house was
deserted. A survey of the boatshed indicated that it was vacant.
It was from there, Hardy had decided, that he had been watched
on the previous evening. This time he would not leave his rear
unexplored.</p>

<p>Waiting until a cloud passed over the face of the moon, Hardy
ran silently to the blank wall of the summer-house. Here he was
in the shadows again. For a time he listened intently, his ear
against the woodwork. There was no sound and no light issuing
from the building.</p>

<p>Creeping to the front, the journalist boldly entered the
summer-house and flashed his torch around. As he had suspected,
it was empty. He was now satisfied that this portion of the
grounds did not contain watchers. There remained the house, and
every window of the building was in darkness. That, in itself,
was no guarantee that the inmates were in bed and asleep. Before
proceeding further, he must satisfy himself that the darkened
rooms did not contain watchers.</p>

<p>Presuming that the gang had posted sentinels&mdash;and such a
course would be probable after his adventure of the previous
night&mdash;Hardy had but two courses he could pursue. He could
go to the house, trusting to his luck to make them discover
their presence before getting dangerously close to them, or he
could make them come to him. Both methods were risky, and one
false step might wreck all hopes of ever getting into the
house, unobserved.</p>

<p>Watching his opportunity, Hardy returned to the shelter of
the boat-shed. There he retired into the concealed nook and
lighted a cigarette. He could smoke here without endangering his
mission. He wanted a smoke and time to think and plan.</p>

<p>The cigarette finished, he climbed out on the runway from the
boat-house, extending over the water. From there he threw the
light of his torch across the bushes on the waterfront. For
several minutes he played the light up and down, intermittently.
Then he crept into the nook and lay beneath the sheltering
bushes, watching the house. It remained silent and dark.
Satisfied now that the inmates were asleep, Hardy made his way
to the edge of the verandah. Crouched down, the journalist
scanned the verandah and the windows. Suddenly he tensed.</p>

<p>A window was open and through it, swaying in the gentle
breeze, floated a curtain. What did it mean? For some moments
Hardy remained undecided. Was it a trap; or&mdash;had the window
been left open by a careless servant? Both were possibilities,
impossible to prove.</p>

<p>Then he swung himself on the verandah and silently approached
the open window. There was no sound from within the room.
Catching hold of the curtain as it drifted towards him, the
journalist peered into the darkened room. All he could see was
the dim outlines of a few pieces of furniture that stood near
the window. The remainder of the room was in darkness.</p>

<p>To suspect a man of dealing in smuggled drugs and to invade
his house in the dead of night, are different things. Hardy held
no illusion on the subject. He was taking a big risk. He knew
that even Frost, with the power of the Detective Department
behind him, would have no power to save him if he was detected
and caught. He would have to take his medicine. The
<i>Mirror</i> would disown him. He would be treated as a common
thief.</p>

<p>Only if he failed. Success, and the proving of his theories,
would justify his actions. The thought spurred him on. With a
quick, backwards glance over the grounds, he pulled back the
flapping curtain and stepped into the room.</p>

<p>For a full minute Hardy stood, just inside the room,
listening intently. There was not a sound to be heard. He
pressed the button of his torch and swept the light slowly
around the room.</p>

<p>As the light pierced the darkness, the windows behind him
swung together. At the same time came the sharp click of a
switch and the room was flooded with light.</p>

<p>Standing on the hearth rug was a thin grey man of medium
height, his shoulders slightly bent forward in a scholarly
stoop. On his head he wore a black silk skull cap from beneath
which scanty grey hairs straggled across his forehead and
temples.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Hardy." The man's lips had not appeared to
move yet the voice came clear as a bell with a slight tinge of
foreign accent. The man stood, absolutely still, only his
piercing grey eyes showing signs of life.</p>

<p>"I have waited a long time for you, Mr. Hardy," the clear
voice continued. "You could not keep away neither did I will you
to do so."</p>

<p>"Dr. Night!" breathed Hardy.</p>

<p>"At your service. Dr. Night!" The thin lips twitched into a
faint smile. "The name will serve. You would not take the
warning I gave you; yet that warning was given at some
considerable risk to myself."</p>

<p>Hardy swung round, suddenly, towards the window. He had it in
mind to make a swift break for liberty.</p>

<p>"I warn you." Dr. Night raised a thin hand. "My servants are
without and have orders not to allow you to pass. They obey me
or&mdash;But we will not talk of unpleasant things."</p>

<p>He had been trapped. Hardy now realised that the quietness of
the house, the open window, the unmatched grounds had all been
decoys to draw him into this room. He had been watched silently,
unobtrusively, from the moment he had entered the grounds of
"Forest Home." The way had been made smooth for him that he
might deliver himself helpless, into the hands of the
master-criminal.</p>

<p>A wave of relief swept over him that he had concealed his
intentions from Doris. It would have been inconceivable for her
to have fallen into the hands of this ominous grey man.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" Hardy asked the question,
involuntarily.</p>

<p>"You are my guest." Dr. Night's eyes had not lost their glint
of amusement&mdash;the amusement of a cat playing with a
tortured mouse. "It is the better way. You have become
inconvenient. For that I congratulate you, Mr. Hardy. Few people
inconvenience me; your friend the big policeman, not at all. As
my guest you will not inconvenience me."</p>

<p>"I should imagine otherwise," answered Hardy with a short
laugh. "You realise that questions will be asked by my newspaper
and the police, if I disappear without explanations."</p>

<p>"By your friend, the big policeman." Dr. Night waved the
suggestion aside. "Yet you had no trouble in avoiding his
espionage when you determined to meet my fair neighbour alone at
the foot of Roslyn Gardens steps."</p>

<p>Dr. Night smiled again at the journalist's bewilderment. "You
are surprised, my guest. You have not realised that you have
been watched for a long time. That I made one mistake is not a
guarantee that I shall make others. The good man, Smithson, was
a mistake. I shall not err again."</p>

<p>"You made a mistake when you telephoned me," corrected Hardy.
Something in the air of his captor gave him confidence.</p>

<p>"I grieve to differ from my guest." Dr. Night's smile had
disappeared. "It was written that you came to me. Therefore I
took means that you should find me. I placed in your hands the
slender thread that would lead you to this house, and to this
room. You have followed it, my servants watching your every
step. You have come here a&mdash;now you are my guest."</p>

<p>"The word 'guest' seems somewhat of a misnomer," remarked the
journalist, drily.</p>

<p>"I think not. But I am remiss. Will you please be seated? I
desire not that my guest should stand."</p>

<p>Pocketing the torch he had continued to hold, Hardy walked
carelessly into the room and seated himself in a deep lounge
chair.</p>

<p>"That is well." The master-criminal relaxed the air of
tension he had worn since revealing himself to the journalist.
He dropped wearily into a chair. "We will now talk of the
future."</p>

<p>"The one matter that interests me at the present moment is,
how long you intend to hold me a prisoner," retorted Hardy.</p>

<p>"Who can read the book that lies in the lap of the gods?" Dr.
Night turned his piercing glance on the journalist. "We mortals
live from day to day and walk the path ordained for us. Again I
fear I am remiss. It is well that I administer to the
requirements of my guest."</p>

<p>The master-criminal clapped his hands, thrice. Immediately
the door opened and a Chinese servant entered, pushing a wheeled
table before him, on which was set out an elaborate tea-service.
Halting in the doorway the man bowed low, three times. He pushed
the waiter to the side of his master and folded his hands in his
sleeves.</p>

<p>"I offer you the drink of my country." Dr. Night waved a thin
hand towards the tea equipage. "It is to your liking? That is
well. It is for you to order in this house and for my servants
to obey. If they obey not you shall inform me and they shall [be
punished]. Ask not little, my guest. The wise man takes that
which is freely offered, even to the uttermost."</p>

<p>"I warn you, Dr. Night, that I shall take my freedom,"
laughed the journalist, sipping the delicious China tea from a
cup of exquisite delicacy. Already he had recovered his nerve
and was planning his escape.</p>

<p>In spite of the involuntary awe the master-criminal had first
infected him with, the journalist realised now that it was a
battle of wits. Dr. Night had shown that he did not intend to
murder him, or to hand him over to the authorities as a thief.
There must be some way he could work to freedom, and even if he
failed. Inspector Frost would search for him. "Forest Home"
would immediately fall under suspicion and a search of the
premises would result in his release.</p>

<p>"Shall I read your thoughts?" The cool voice of the
master-criminal broke on his meditation. "You are thinking that
your friend, the big policeman, will quickly come for you. True,
he will come, but he will not find you. You will not want him to
find you."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" Hardy was startled.</p>

<p>"I say, you will not want your friend the big policeman to
find you." Dr. Night's voice was full of assurance, "It will be
your desire to remain here as my guest.</p>

<p>"Should you leave me I shall have to invite your lady friend
to take your place. You understand. I am referring to the young
lady who pulled you out of the water last night. And she will
not refuse. No, I shall take her for&mdash;my guest."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">THE grey eyes of the man became full of weird
lights. The lean body tensed with energy and as he leaned
towards the journalist his voice became low and menacing.</p>

<p>"You will be my guest here, or the lady of your friendship
shall take your place. She, I will send to my country, and
there she will not be my guest. There are men in my country who
desire greatly women who are white. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Slowly, Hardy nodded his head. Only too well he understood
the veiled threat.</p>

<p>Dr. Night confined Hardy in a suite of rooms on the upper
storey of "Forest Home," overlooking the Harbour. Except that
the door of the suite was kept locked and the windows were
heavily barred, there was but little restraint put on him. The
master-criminal appeared to think that the journalist was
overawed by his threats against Doris' liberty.</p>

<p>Hardy was willing that the Doctor should deceive himself in
that manner. From the moment the threat against Doris had been
uttered the journalist had determined to play a part. He would
remain a voluntary prisoner in the quarters assigned to him,
obedient to the orders of his gaoler, and trust to the sequence
of events to give him his liberty at the opportune moment. One
of the chief reasons which held Hardy a complacent prisoner in
"Forest Home" was the fact that, in those circumstance he would
have opportunities to study the master-criminal at close
quarters; and that chance might put him in the way of the clues
to solve the mysteries surrounding the place and the gang. To
attain these objects, Hardy was content to ignore the immediate
question of his liberty. Once he had to break up this nest of
criminals he would find means to walk out of this house and take
measures for Doris' protection. Further, every day brought the
Inspector nearer to his prison place. Sooner or later, he and
the police would get into communication and then the arrest of
Dr. Night and his confederates would quickly follow.</p>

<p>Dr. Night appeared to take a great interest in his prisoner.
Two or three times a day he would visit Hardy's room and, though
his visits were short, at first, he gradually lengthened them.
Nearly every evening he would send a message to the journalist
requesting him to visit him in his study; and the short journeys
through the house showed Hardy that the master-criminal had at
his disposal a large staff of servile Asiatics.</p>

<p>Dr. Night's nationality puzzled the journalist. There was an
evident desire on the part of the Doctor that his prisoner
should regard him as a Chinese of high rank; but for some
indefinable reason, that Hardy could not have logically
defended, he was convinced that the master-criminal was
attempting to mislead him in that direction. At the same time
the journalist noticed that the Chinese servants regarded their
master as purely Chinese and of royal rank, and served him
accordingly.</p>

<p>Hardy saw no one but the master-criminal and the Chinese
servants. So far as he could discover there were no white people
in the house. Yet Frost had declared that the household was
composed only of Europeans. The journalist could not conclude
that the house contained two separate households, and that the
Asiatic household was carefully concealed from any chance
visitors to the house.</p>

<p>Openly, and for public information, Francis Westerton
occupied the house. Behind this blind lived Dr. Night, served by
Asiatic servants, in royal seclusion.</p>

<p>The apparent inaction of the journalist induced a spirit of
boastfulness in the master-criminal. At the first intervals
between Hardy and his gaoler the latter had confined himself to
general subjects and had proved himself a wonderfully
well-informed man. Later, he had become more personal, and
entertained the journalist with accounts of his adventures as a
modern Robin Hood, in constant warfare with recognised
authority, always succouring the poor and needy. It was the
story of a life that led from the heart of China, and through
the various countries of the world, to the new nation in
Australia.</p>

<p>A week passed and in spite of Hardy's ceaseless watchfulness,
he had learned but little, his immediate ambition was to gain a
certain freedom in the house. For the time he was indifferent as
to how closely the master-criminal guarded him from the grounds
and freedom. He wanted liberty to explore the house and that, it
was evident, was to be denied him.</p>

<p>When Dr. Night visited him, the door of his prison rooms
stood apparently unguarded, but outside in the corridor stood on
guard half-a-dozen stalwart Chinese. Peculiarly, when he was
served with his meals in his sitting-room, the man who waited on
him appeared to be unattended by guards.</p>

<p>The inaction fretted the journalist. He wondered that
Inspector Frost was doing. Surely his disappearance would have
caused inquiries to be made at "Forest Home." The detective knew
that he had been watching the place. Fairly contented at first,
the journalist grew restless and spent much of his time standing
at his window, staring out over the Harbour.</p>

<p>One day his attention was attracted by the vigorous
signalling of a sailor on a destroyer steaming down the Harbour.
The journalist could decipher the letters as they were spelt
out. Idly, he repeated the message to himself. An idea struck
him. It would be possible to flash a message across the Harbour.
The electric light in his room would be the means.</p>

<p>Would the sudden lighting and darkening of his room be
sufficient? He doubted it. He must intensify the light and throw
it out over the Harbour. He looked around the room. A radiator
stood in the corner, attached to the wall plug by a long length
of flexible wire.</p>

<p>Disengaging the wall plug, he had at his disposal a long
length of wire sufficient to extend the light to his window.
Mounting the table he carefully scraped bare the wires
immediately above the lamp holder, keeping them apart with a
plug of wood. From one of the rooms of the suite he obtained a
globe-holder and fitted it on to the end of the cord. Around
this he formed a cone of newspaper to confine and intensify the
light. He was now ready to get in touch with the outer
world.</p>

<p>Three nights in succession the journalist, at frequent
intervals, attempted to get into communication with some boat on
the Harbour, but without success.</p>

<p>On the fourth night he noticed a lantern being waved
vigorously from a small boat. After watching it for some time,
Hardy came to the conclusion that the persons in the boat were
trying to get in communication with him.</p>

<p>"<i>Tell Inspector Frost, police, come waterfront,
to-morrow</i>," carefully spelt out the journalist, in
hesitating Morse.</p>

<p>There was a brief wait and then Hardy repeated the message.
From the boat someone winked out the message:</p>

<p>"<i>Yes</i>."</p>

<p>Hardy was now in communication with the outer world.</p>

<p>Pulling down his apparatus and concealing the evidence of his
work, he sat down to think out his course of action. Frost would
certainly come to the waterfront the following night, and by
that time he must have planned his future actions. If he decided
to leave "Forest Home" at once, Frost would certainly arrange
for the house to be raided immediately. In fact, Hardy feared
that once the Inspector received his message, he would arrange a
raid without waiting to hear from Hardy on the following
evening.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the journalist was not in a hurry to leave
"Forest Home." The house intrigued him. If only he could pass
the door of his room, unwatched.</p>

<p>The following evening Dr. Night came early to his room and
sat talking. Hardy was restless, and when the hours passed and
the master-criminal showed no signs of leaving he became
suspicious that the doctor's spies had discovered his attempt to
communicate with the outer world. At length, the journalist
commenced to yawn, ostentatiously.</p>

<p>"You are tired, my friend," Dr. Night said "Yet you have no
work to draw on your strength. As for me, night I have to labour
long. I will, therefore, bid you pleasant sleep and a good
awakening."</p>

<p>"It will be pleasant if it leads to the day of my freedom,"
observed Hardy barely stifling another yawn.</p>

<p>"That is a matter it is forbidden to discuss." Dr. Night
bowed as he moved towards the door. "The day may come. In the
meantime, remember, the wise man is patient in all things."</p>

<p>Immediately the Doctor had left the room, Hardy sprang to the
door and pressed his ear against the woodwork. He heard the
slow, stately step walk along the corridor and then start to
descend the stairs.</p>

<p>When he was certain that the Doctor would not return the
journalist mounted the table and quickly fixed his apparatus.
For about an hour he flashed signals across the Harbour, without
result. Then he received an answering signal from the deck of a
ship lying out towards Neutral Bay.</p>

<p>Three times the message was repeated before the journalist
could decipher it.</p>

<p>Finally, he pieced together sufficient of the words to guess
the meaning of the whole.</p>

<p>"<i>Frost in boat, waterfront. Is it safe, signal from
there</i>?"</p>

<p>Depressing the mouth of his cone, Hardy winked out the word:
"<i>Frost</i>."</p>

<p>From a clump of bushes on the waterfront a torch winked
quickly. Opening the window the journalist flung out on the lawn
his cigarette case, containing a letter he had written during
the day.</p>

<p>Then he morsed: "<i>Letter on lawn. To-morrow after midnight.
Good night</i>."</p>

<p>It was very dangerous to continue signalling.</p>

<p>Hardy waited impatiently for the following night. It wanted
some twenty minutes to the hour when he took up his station at
the window, fearing every minute that something would happen to
prevent the detective getting in touch with him. Just on the
stroke of the hour a torch winked on the water edge.</p>

<p>Hardy opened his window, and waited. A few minutes later a
soft article struck the bars of the window and fell, almost
silently on to the iron of the verandah roof. The journalist
thrust his arm out of the window, curved to cover as many bars
as possible, and waited. Again the soft thing bumped the bars
and fell to the roof; this time the string to which it was
attached fell over his arm. Stretching out his other hand he
caught the string and hauled it in.</p>

<p>A somewhat large package came over the edge of the verandah
and slid along the roof. It was fairly bulky and he had some
difficulty in dragging it between the bars. Then he pulled down
his flashing apparatus. With nervous hands he opened the package
and switched on the room lights. He discovered a miscellaneous
collection of files, saws, skeleton keys and other burglar
tools, including a knotted rope.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="first">A LETTER lay among the tools. Hardy was about
to open it when he thought he heard a sound in the corridor.
Bundling the tools into the cloth in which they had been wrapped
he took them into his bedroom, and hid them under the mattress
of his bed. Then he returned to his sitting-room and opened the
letter.</p><br>

<p class="letter">Here are the tools you asked for. We have been
greatly worried over your disappearance and Thomas raised hell
with the D.B. He was much relieved when I telephoned him to-day
that we had got in touch with you and told him that you were
occupying a position in the enemy's camp. When will you be ready
to escape? Shouldn't take you more than a night to file through
those bars. What did you want the keys for? Do you intend to get
through the house? Should say window the best. Bill Matthews was
brought from Melbourne this morning. Going to give him a
'once-over' to-morrow evening at office. Should like you to be there
as you may have gathered sufficient to induce him to open out. One
of our boats with a couple of men will be under the bushes on
the waterfront each night, until you escape, to be of any
assistance to you. If you are not free within forty-eight hours
after you get this, I shall raid the house.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Jim Frost</span>.</p>

<p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;Will wait for your O.K.</p>

<p><br> Hardy seized a piece of paper and was about to write a
note acknowledging the detective's letter when he heard voices
in the garden. Switching off the light, he went to the window
and peered out into the night. He could see little but moving
shadows. The shrill voices of the Chinese servants came up to
him and he could distinguish the calm, level deeper tones of the
master-criminal.</p>

<p>Then a torch winked on the waterfront. The chatter of the
Chinese servants increased in volume. Someone on land fired a
couple of shots, responded to from the waterfront by a derisive
laugh.</p>

<p>The light in the study below switched on and Hardy could
distinguish on the lawn the slender form of Dr. Night, standing
by the bulkier form of a white man.</p>

<p>"Sure I hit one of 'em," exulted Dr. Night's companion.
"Couldn't miss 'em. What were they after?"</p>

<p>"Robert Hardy," replied the Doctor. "It is most evident that
the big policeman suspects that he is here."</p>

<p>"D'yer think that newspaper chap got in touch with him?"
queried the man.</p>

<p>"We may soon learn if that is so."</p>

<p>Dr. Night turned and led the way back to the house. Hardy
stripped off his coat and collar and picked up a book. When the
master-criminal and his companion entered the room he was
seated, apparently half-asleep, in a chair.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" The journalist gave an excellent imitation of a man
rudely awakened from a doze. "By Jove! I must have fallen asleep
over my book. Anything wrong, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Did not my guest hear the shots fired on the lawn?" Dr.
Night looked searchingly into the journalist's face as he asked
the question.</p>

<p>"What was the trouble?" asked Hardy innocently.</p>

<p>"I was unable to discover," replied Dr. Night suavely. "My
guest would do well to retire. It is not good to read too late
at night."</p>

<p>"I'd stop 'is readin' an' 'is breathin' too," muttered the
gunman, slipping his hand into the pocket of his jacket. "Just
say t'word, Doctor."</p>

<p>"I do not approve of violence." The master-criminal motioned
his companion towards the door. "Mr. Hardy understands the
consequence of disobedience to my wishes."</p>

<p>For an hour Hardy lay down on his bed, intent on keeping
awake. He had determined that, when the household had quieted
down, after the excitement occasioned by the shooting on the
lawn, he would explore the house. Time was short, for Inspector
Frost had written that he had Matthews in custody, in Sydney,
and intended to question his the following night. The journalist
had determined that he would be present at that inquisition.
Matthews could link up many points in the chain of evidence he
was weaving around the household at "Forest Home," if he would
speak, and Hardy was of opinion that he had information that
would induce the young criminal to talk freely.</p>

<p>The master-criminal had indicated earlier in the evening that
he had work that would occupy him a greater part of the night.
Hardy realised that to attempt to explore the house with Dr.
Night awake was terribly hazardous, but he could not wait, it
had to be that night, whatever the cost. With the information
that he might gain, the work of the police in routing out this
nest of criminals would be made easy and exact.</p>

<p>The frequent conversations he had had with the master-criminal
had given him an insight into the character of the man.
Clever, the Doctor undoubtedly was, but it was a cleverness that
held many pitfalls. Secure in his own ability, the master-criminal
held the powers of his opponents cheap. He ignored the
undoubted ability of the Police Department, treating them as if
of no account. He had concealed to some extent his opinion of
the journalist, but had let it be seen that while he gave the
newspaper man credit for certain shrewdness, he discounted any
opposition from him as negligible.</p>

<p>Unwittingly Dr. Night had given Hardy a fairly clear
understanding of the working of the gang he headed. The
journalist had, before he entered the home of Dr. Night as a
prisoner, formed the theory that "Forest Home" was the
headquarters of a gang of illicit drug smugglers under the
leadership of Francis Westerton and Dr. Night. He had
suspicioned that the activities of the gang were confined to New
South Wales.</p>

<p>His interviews with the master-criminal had sufficed to show
him that he had vastly underrated the abilities and extent of
the gang. Dr. Night was the sole head of the organisation.
Westerton and the other white men under him, and their
ramifications, spread all over Australia. Under the
master-criminal, Sydney had become the centre and the port for
the secret importations of cocaine and opium in vast quantities.</p>

<p>But there was another side of the activities of the gang that
Hardy had not yet uncovered. Sufficient he had learned to induce
him to believe that through "Forest Home" Chinese and other
Asiatics were being imported into Australia in vast quantities.
These men, practically slaves, were immediately passed into the
city and out into the country, to be forwarded by underground
railways into the vast north, there to work in mines and on the
fields owned by Chinese who had been in Australia for years.</p>

<p>From sentences the doctor had let fall, the journalist was
coming to believe that white men, calling themselves
Australians, were not innocent of this bartering in human flesh
and blood as cheap labour. Piecing together the various bits of
information he had obtained during his confinement in the house,
the time passed quickly for the journalist.</p>

<p>At two o'clock in the morning, Hardy swung his feet to the
ground and went quietly to the door. Not a sound could be heard
from the corridor. Taking a bunch of the skeleton keys Frost had
given him, Hardy tried a likely-looking one in the door. It
turned easily and silently. Very cautiously, he pulled the door
slightly open and peered out. The electric light was still
burning in the corridor. For a moment the journalist stood at
the open door carefully examining the corridor from end to end.
It lay silent and deserted.</p>

<p>Hardy had in his mind a careful plan of the house, gathered
from the few times he had passed from his prison room to the
Doctor's study. Turning towards the head of the stairs and
walking with the utmost caution, he passed along the corridor.
At the head of the stairs he halted and listened intently. The
house seemed deserted. As far as he could judge he was the only
person awake within those walls. Yet, unless the Doctor had
deliberately deceived him, he knew that this was not so.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the house the master-criminal was awake and at
his nefarious business. It was for Hardy to avoid him at all
costs. Face to face with the Doctor, he would have to surrender
and go back to a more vigorous confinement, or fight his way to
freedom against overwhelming odds. If his luck held&mdash;Hardy
prayed that it would&mdash;to-morrow he would be free, and with
the information to put the master-criminal and his gang behind
the bars for a long term of years.</p>

<p>The next hour would decide.</p>

<p>Carefully creeping down the stairs, Hardy arrived at the
ground floor. Before him were the great doors of the entrance
hall. On either side the hall branched off into passages. Doors
seemed everywhere. Turning to the right, Hardy cautiously tried
the door. It gave and he thrust it open and peered in. The blind
was up and the journalist could see that it was one of the big
reception rooms, unoccupied. The door on the left of the front
doors led into a similar room.</p>

<p>The journalist hesitated a moment and then closed the door.
It was not in these rooms he would find the information he
required. Through the darkness of the house the newspaper
investigator moved silently, from room to room. Soon he located
the room where Westerton lay asleep. In another room he found
the maids, also asleep. Yet another room was given over to the
men-servants, but nowhere did he find any trace of the Chinese
servants. It was evident that they slept in some quarters at the
rear of the house.</p>

<p>At length he came to the door of the room he knew to be the
master-criminal's study. Here he paused a long time, listening
with his ear pressed against the panel. It was silent within the
room, but Hardy feared to turn the latch. He well remembered the
wonderful silence the man had preserved on the night he had been
captured.</p>

<p>Was Dr. Night within, like a spider in his lair, awaiting the
journalist-fly to walk into the trap?</p>

<p>The minutes passed while Hardy stood with his hand on the
door-knob trying to pluck up courage to put his doubts to rest.
Then, walking back to the front door, he carefully examined the
fastenings, making certain that the door was not bolted and
could be opened on the latch alone. Satisfied he returned to the
study door and, listening a moment, turned the handle and
slipped inside.</p>

<p>A light was burning on the desk under one of the long
windows. The red shade cast a glow over the room, leaving the
corners in mysterious shadows. Hardy drew his pocket torch and
swept the room with a beam of white light. He was alone. A
number of papers were littered on the blotting pad. Quickly he
passed them under review. They were innocent business letters,
most of them relating, to the household expenditure. Among these
papers were a few, obviously letters, written in Chinese
characters. The newspaper man hesitated, with them in his hand.
He would have liked to have appropriated them. They might
contain information relating to the foreign correspondence of
the gang.</p>

<p>It was dangerous, however. Dr. Night might miss them and in
his rooms he had no hiding place where they would be safe from a
thorough search. Systematically, Hardy quartered the room,
patiently searching for evidence of the gang's criminal
activities. A comfortable, handsomely furnished room, it held
nothing that could be considered of value to a prosecution.</p>

<p>Wearied with his search, Hardy seated himself in one of the
lounge chairs and looked around him. His attention was caught by
a handsome pianola standing against the wall at the far end of
the room. Close by stood a cabinet, choked full of piano rolls.
On the instrument and on top of the cabinet, and piled on the
floor around were heaps of rolls.</p>

<p>Hardy could not remember hearing the pianola being played
since he became a prisoner in the house. From the number of
rolls scattered around Dr. Night should be considered a "pianola
fan." Yet he did not use the instrument.</p>

<p>Crossing the room, Hardy picked up one of the boxes. It
opened easily in his hand and contained the usual music roll.
Lifting it out the journalist opened the roll. It was the usual
perforated paper article. Hardy tried box after box, only to
meet the same result.</p>

<p>He was not satisfied. Why should the master-criminal
accumulate this large pile of rolls and never play the
instrument? They looked innocent, but&mdash;Hardy slipped one of
the boxes into his pocket. It would not be missed and in his
rooms he could examine it at leisure.</p>

<p>The silence of the room made Hardy incautious. He was
standing by the pianola, puzzling over the mystery of the
musical instrument that was never played when he heard a
sound&mdash;a slight click, like the release of a latch.
Quickly, he slipped behind the pianola.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. He peered around the instrument.
Someone was standing by the big desk, searching for something.
Drawer after drawer was opened and examined.</p>

<p>At length the man stood up, muttering to himself. He walked
across the room to the handsome fireplace and pressed one of the
bosses of the ornamentation. A section of the wainscoting moved
silently to one side, revealing a passage. The man bent down-and
gave a low whistle. A few seconds and he whistled again. Almost
immediately Dr. Night passed through the opening into the
room.</p>

<p>"The things are not here," exclaimed the man, irritably. Dr
Night went to the desk and pulled out one of the drawers
completely. He thrust his arm into the cavity. There was a
little click and part of the heavy moulding at the top of the
desk fell down, revealing a shallow drawer.</p>

<p>"Here are the papers, my friend," said the Doctor, suavely.
"You know where the stuff is hidden."</p>

<p>"Sure," said the stranger. "It's one of the cutest tricks
I've come across this side of the Pacific."</p>

<p>"It is a pleasure to have the commendation of so great an
authority as Carl Humberson." Dr. Night spoke with slight
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"That's more than I can say for the birds I have to work
with," retorted Humberson, crossly. "Of all the mugs I've come
across, the wiseheads of Sydney beat it. How in Hades did you
come to let Jinks Smithson get in the hands of the
'demons'?"</p>

<p>"That is a matter we have discussed at some length before,"
answered Dr. Night, with a slight anger in his tone. "Had you
not been foolish enough it would not have been necessary for me
to write to you. I am not responsible; my servant thought the
letter would give him power over you and I&mdash;opened it."</p>

<p>"Yet you killed him?"</p>

<p>"It was necessary. The man indulged in excessive drinking of
spirits. He was a talker and&mdash;well, he talked."</p>

<p>"Good lor'!" Humberson turned on his heel with a shudder and
made his way to the secret door. "Comin' down?"</p>

<p>"I follow you, my friend." The master-criminal closed the
secret cavity and replaced the desk drawer he had pulled out.
Then he passed from the room through the door by the fire-place,
and the secret door swung shut behind him.</p>

<p>Robert Hardy had much to occupy him on the day following his
adventure in Dr. Night's study. For the first time he was
beginning to accurately realise the strength of his opponents.
Dr. Night had murdered Smithson, the man found unconscious in
Darlinghurst Road. He had heard the master-criminal admit the
fact in a callous, cold-blooded manner, defending his action on
the ground of policy.</p>

<p>A new factor in the problem confronting the journalist was
the secret sliding panel in the Doctor's study. Where did it
lead to and what lay behind it? For the moment he believed that
it lead to the boat-house, but further reflection made him
decide against this theory.</p>

<p>Before starting on his tour of the house he had carefully
watched the gardens. Had any person been working in the
boatshed, and under the powerful electric light system
established there, he could not have failed to have caught some
glimpse of the light. No, the secret door led to some
underground workshop where the activities of the gang were
conducted without risk of interruption.</p>

<p>On returning to his room from the master-criminal's study,
Hardy had set himself to solve the problem of his escape. He had
decided that the following night would see him free. Frost had
warned him that it was the intention of the police, on that
night, to question William Matthews as to the death of the man
found in Darlinghurst Road, and also as to the reasons behind
the attack on Mrs. Matthews' house.</p>

<p>The journalist would not have missed that examination on any
account. Matthews answers to the questions the police would ask
him, coupled with the information he had collected in the house
of the mystery, would certainly make a connected story
sufficient to enable Inspector Frost to apply to a magistrate
for a search warrant on "Forest Home"; and warrants for the
arrest of Dr. Night and the members of his gang.</p>

<p>At first glance the barrel windows of his prison appeared to
be the best avenue of escape. During the day Hardy was left to
his own devices. Dr. Night had provided him with a small but
very complete library, and the daily papers were brought to him
with regularity, within a short time of the publishing of each
edition.</p>

<p>The journalist had rather wondered at this. Frost's
investigations had shown that only one morning and one evening
newspaper were delivered at "Forest Home." These newspapers were
slight but additional proof of the fact that the two households
were conducted on entirely separate lines.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">TESTING the bars of the windows, the journalist
decided that to cut through them would mean several days work,
with the tenor of discovery hanging over him. To work in the
day-time would subject him to espionage from the gardens; to
work at night would be to risk someone in the house hearing the
grate of the excellent saws the police had provided him
with.</p>

<p>On his adventure through the house, Hardy had been able to
reach the front doors unobserved. It was possible he might be
able to do so again. The fastenings of the doors were not
difficult and it should not be impossible or even difficult to
pass out of the house through the front door unobserved and
unheard. Against this stood the fact that most large houses were
protected by some form of burglar alarm. To open the door and
walk out might set in operation some mechanism that would alarm
the household.</p>

<p>The journalist had no doubt that he could easily outdistance
any of the Chinese servants in a sprint to Darlinghurst and the
populous streets. Dr Night was not to be considered in a test of
running speed. Francis Westerton was not built for running, even
if his story of a weak heart was false.</p>

<p>There remained only the gunman. Hardy set him down as the one
great danger. The man was lean and fit and had, in addition, the
menace of the guns he would undoubtedly use on the slightest
provocation.</p>

<p>There was an additional factor to be counted. Dr. Night had
threatened Doris with a fate of unspeakable horror. The
journalist was convinced that once his escape was known, every
endeavour of the master-criminal would be directed to revenge,
and that revenge would be against the girl at "Holmhurst."</p>

<p>Hardy might, on escaping, go for police protection. In the
meantime, he and Mr. Blayde might attempt the defence of the
house. But the master-criminal could, undoubtedly bring to the
attack a very large force of Asians. It was almost certain the
defenders of "Holmhurst" would be overwhelmed, Hardy and Mr.
Blayde killed or seriously injured, and Doris in the hands of
the unscrupulous criminals, before Frost could bring any force
to their relief.</p>

<p>The sole remaining avenue of escape must be through one of
the windows on the upper floor. The windows of his suite of
rooms were barred, but it was improbable that all the windows on
that floor were in the same condition.</p>

<p>From signs Hardy had some days previously come to the
conclusion that the rooms he occupied were, at one time, used
for a nursery. Thus the reason for the bars, obviously of some
years' standing.</p>

<p>The hours of the day passed rapidly in the weighing of
evidence on plans of escape. Darkness came about half-past
seven. At six o'clock the Chinese servant detailed to attend on
him had served an elaborate dinner and, after clearing the
table, had locked the door. Dr. Night was evidently busy for the
usual hour of his visit passed without him making an
appearance.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock the journalist started to put into action
the plans he had formed. For a time he knelt beside the door
with his ear pressed against the pane listening for any sound in
the corridor. No one passed, and at length Hardy decided that
the time for action had arrived.</p>

<p>With the master-key provided by the Inspector, Hardy
cautiously unlocked the door and, opening it a small crack
peered out. As he had expected, the corridor was deserted,
although brilliantly lit. To the left lay the head of the
stairs.</p>

<p>Three doors lay between Hardy's prison room and the stairs.
Hardy disregarded them. Escape from the windows or doors of the
lower rooms would leave him to run the gauntlet of espionage
from the house, while attempting to reach the police boat
concealed under the bushes near the boundary wall between
"Forest Home" and "Holmhurst."</p>

<p>With his scanty knowledge of the house to work on, the
journalist decided that the far end of the long corridor to the
room of his suite of rooms, gave him the best hope of escaping
unobserved and attaining the shelter of the trees.</p>

<p>For a time Hardy stood in the corridor, carefully conning
possibilities; at the same time alert for the slightest sign of
movement in the house. Without moving, his eyes scanned the
doors of the various rooms bordering the corridor to the right.
Some of these rooms were certainly occupied. His investigations
of the previous evening had shown that Francis Westerton and his
household lived and slept in the front of the house and on the
ground floor. It was, therefore, possible that the Chinese
servants occupied the rooms at the rear of the house. He had not
succeeded in discovering their sleeping apartments. Possibly
they occupied the rooms around the prison.</p>

<p>At the end of the corridor was a door. There was no balcony
to the upper storey of the house, therefore the door led into
some room. Was that room occupied? If not, did the room contain
an unbarred window, through which could be his road to
freedom?</p>

<p>Creeping carefully down the thickly carpeted corridor, the
journalist arrived at the door he had marked as his best means
of escape. The master-key turned easily and silently. Hardy
opened the door a crack. The room was in darkness. For a couple
of seconds he hesitated. If anyone slept in that room, the
sudden light from the corridor would certainly awaken them.</p>

<p>Hardy had an impulse to search for the switch and shut off
the corridor lights. Immediately he abandoned the project. The
darkening of the corridor would attract the attention of any
watchers within or without the house. If anyone occupied the
room, his success depended entirely on his quickness of
action.</p>

<p>Swinging open the doors, Hardy pressed the button of his
electric torch and flooded the room with light. It was a large
room almost entirely filled with boxes and the junk pertaining
to an occupied house. A quick glance round and he switched off
the torch and closed the door behind him. He had taken the risk
of attracting attention in suddenly lighting the room. It had
been an inevitable risk, but he had acted so quickly that he
trusted any watchers in the grounds had not observed the
lighting of the room; or if they had, had placed it to the
credit of some servant. Turning, he locked the door and then
went to the window.</p>

<p>As he had expected, the window was unbarred and looked out
towards "Holmhurst." The trees came up to within a few yards of
the edge of the verandah and one large branch far overhung the
verandah roof, coming near the window of the box-room. Once out
of that window, in a few seconds he would be within the shelter
of the belt of trees. The risk of his escape being observed was
small.</p>

<p>Listening for a few moments at the door leading to the
corridor, Hardy unlocked it and, shutting it behind him, stole
back to his prison rooms. Here he collected the tools Frost had
provided for his escape. With the bundle of tools under his arm
he returned to the box-room. There he found a hiding place for
them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">A FEW minutes later he opened the window and
stepped silently on to the verandah roof. Without sound, he
crept to the verandah edge and dropped to the ground. Two
seconds later and he stood, once more free, within the shelter
of the trees.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to go straight to "Holmhurst" and let
Doris know that he was safe and free. A moment's thought and he
stole softly down to the water's edge and whistled lowly.
Immediately came an answering whistle, and a boat edged down
from the boundary wall.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock was striking when the journalist walked into the
main entrance of Police Headquarters. Inspector Frost was
loitering in the main hall and welcomed him warmly.</p>

<p>"Good boy," exclaimed the detective. "I guessed you would not
miss to-night's show. Did you have any difficulty in escaping?
But keep your story. The Chief will want to hear it."</p>

<p>Frost led down the corridor to the Superintendent of
Detectives' office. As the couple entered, Dixon looked up with
a broad smile of welcome.</p>

<p>"Still on the inside running of the story, Bob?" he laughed.
"Frost looted our museum of housebreaking tools for you. In all
my twenty years in the force I never had the luck to be accepted
as a guest by the gang of criminals I was chasing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's the lack of grey-matter in the cranium of a
journalist that makes the difference," retorted Hardy. "From
what I can see, it appears impossible to have grey matter and
luck. It's one or the other."</p>

<p>Before Dixon could reply the door opened and Alfonso Thomas,
the managing editor of the <i>Morning Mirror</i> entered. Seeing
Hardy with Superintendent Dixon he gave an exclamation of
surprise.</p>

<p>"Hardy! You've escaped! Good work boy. For a few days we
thought Dr. Night had made away with you."</p>

<p>"I think we are ready for our interesting young friend,"
remarked Dixon, at that moment. The Inspector left the room.
Hardy and Thomas found seats under the window, to the right of
the Superintendent's desk. There was an air of tenseness in the
room, concealed by the three men under an air of assumed
indifference. Yet, each one of the three realised that the work
they were engaged in had come to a climax.</p>

<p>The silence was becoming almost oppressive when the door
opened and admitted William Matthews and a detective sergeant.
The latter took up a position by the door, whilst Frost beckoned
the snow-runner to a seat facing the Superintendent, across the
desk. When Matthews was seated there was a short silence.</p>

<p>Hardy and Thomas looked with open curiosity at the prisoner.
Matthews was a typical product of the city. Hollow-chested,
sallow-faced, short of stature, he bore every sign of the
moderate degenerate. Seating himself carelessly, the snow-runner
first deliberately tried to outstare the Superintendent. Failing
in this object, he coolly turned in his chair and surveyed the
other occupants of the room with tin air of detached insolence.
Finally he turned to the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Say," he drawled, wearily. "Is this a beauty show, or what,
and do I get first prize? Those boobs don't run natural with
your mob."</p>

<p>"Keep a civil tongue in your mouth," replied the Inspector
roughly.</p>

<p>"Next time you'll tell me to keep a silent tongue&mdash;and
you brought me here for a pow-wow. You demons are as full of
wise sayings as the Harbour's full of water."</p>

<p>"Captain Kettle sends his regards, Matthews," observed Dixon,
carelessly.</p>

<p>Matthews swung round on his chair, his mouth agape. The shot
had struck right home; the more that it had been entirely
unexpected.</p>

<p>"Come down to book tales, now," Matthews tried to jeer away
his error. "Well, it'll do some of you guys good to take a
tumble to Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake, an' that lot. Might
earn your beans then. Suppose that's what this writin' bloke's
here for."</p>

<p>"Look here, Matthews," exclaimed Dixon sternly. "I've had you
brought here to give you a chance to get out of a mess. Let me
have any of your lip and you go up&mdash;and take your
medicine."</p>

<p>"Ain't they good, these Sydney 'demons?'" Matthews turned a
sudden glance on Thomas. "Allus tryin' to help a bloke. Never
hits 'em down&mdash;not them. They're all for a poor chap's
good. They don't want to know nuffing, 'course not! They're
clever enough to find out all they wants to know."</p>

<p>"Clever enough to track down your friend, Dr. Night," said
Hardy carelessly. "Come now, Matthews. Mr. Thomas and I are on
the level, if you don't trust the police. Come across with what
we want to know and we'll see that you get a square deal and
perhaps more."</p>

<p>"Kind of yer!" The snow-runner appeared to fancy his heavy
sarcasm. Then a thought appeared to strike him and he added:
"Say, are you the <i>Mirror</i> bloke?"</p>

<p>"What of that?" Dixon broke in abruptly.</p>

<p>"If he's the <i>Mirror</i> bloke, perhaps he wrote the stuff
about the man who was found dead in Darlinghurst Road."</p>

<p>"What if he did?"</p>

<p>"Well, he knows what comes to them as talks too much."</p>

<p>"So that's what you're frightened about." Frost tried to fill
his voice with scorn. Matthews did not answer. He sat staring
ahead at Superintendent Dixon. The watchers began to realise
that the terror Dr. Night had instilled into his followers was
real.</p>

<p>"Look here, Billy." Hardy drew a chair close to the
prisoner's and lowered his voice. "Let's get together at the
beginning. I had a story last year that might interest you. It
concerned an American of the name of Zimmerman."</p>

<p>"You've got nothing on me over that," Matthews sat upright in
his chair for the first time, and glanced towards the door.</p>

<p>"Let's hear your tale of the deal," interrupted Dixon.</p>

<p>"It was straight, boss. I bought the goods from the bagman.
You can't hold me for that."</p>

<p>"As you won't tell the tale, I suppose I must," said the
journalist carelessly. "About eighteen months ago, a commercial
traveller came from New York to Sydney. He had with him a lot of
samples. One case contained some gross of imitation gold pencil
cases. The man took to drink and got rid of a lot of valuable
stuff from his sample cases. The imitation gold pencil cases
were a drug on the market and he failed to dispose of any of
them at any old price. You, Matthews, came along and offered to
get rid of the lot, at a price. You carried out your promise,
but Zimmermann claimed he never saw the price."</p>

<p>"Th' old souse!" The snow-runner's voice was full of
indignation. "He offered me a straight fifty-fifty on the deal
then wanted to cry off&mdash;when the deal had gone
through."</p>

<p>"That's the tale you tell." Dixon struck his desk heavily
with his open hand. "Zimmerman states you collared the whole of
the money you got for the pencils. Matthews, you stole that
money."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You stole that money." Dixon's voice was more imperative on
the repetition.</p>

<p>"Zimmerman 'ad 'arf."</p>

<p>"You stole that money." The Superintendent's voice had
dropped to a dead monotone but had lost nothing of its
imperativeness. The prisoner looked up into the Superintendent's
boring eyes, and then looked down, hastily. The denial died on
his lips. "'Ave it yer own way." The snow-runner's pallid cheeks
were ashen white.</p>

<p>"You stole that money."</p>

<p>Matthews sat fidgeting restlessly in his chair. Again the
Superintendent reiterated the statement, in the same monotonous
monotone.</p>

<p>"Yes." The criminal's eyes, now fixed on the Superintendent,
were filled with a depth of despair. "I stole that money."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="first">"GOOD." Dixon's tone changed abruptly. "Have
you the warrant, Warren?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." The detective sergeant, seated at the door, stood
up. "Shall I execute it sir?"</p>

<p>"Not yet." The Superintendent motioned the man to resume his
seal. "How did you come to know Captain Kettle, Matthews?"</p>

<p>"He bought some of the pencils."</p>

<p>"Knowing them to be stolen property?"</p>

<p>"S'pose so."</p>

<p>"Who is Captain Kettle?"</p>

<p>"Friend o' the doctor's."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"He 'ands out the stuff."</p>

<p>"What stuff?"</p>

<p>"The snow an' the other things."</p>

<p>"What other things?"</p>

<p>Matthews made a gesture of disgust. "You know. The mud, an'
all that."</p>

<p>"Look here, Matthews," broke in Thomas, impatiently. "This
sort of question and answer business doesn't suit me. The
<i>Morning Mirror</i> has offered a large reward for the capture
and conviction of Dr. Night and his gang, and the destruction of
the illicit drug trade in this State. I will see that you get
your share of the reward, if you help me to round up those
criminals."</p>

<p>"An' who might you be?" Matthews began to regain some of the
confidence Dixon's third degree methods had dissipated.</p>

<p>"My name is Thomas, and I'm managing editor of the
<i>Mirror</i>."</p>

<p>"You've givin' me that straight?"</p>

<p>Alfonso Thomas' large moustache appeared to bristle at the
idea that the owner would break his word.</p>

<p>"You have my word for it."</p>

<p>Bill Matthews stood up and stretched himself with an air of
utter weariness. Frost made as if to force him back on his seat,
but Hardy, who had been closely watching the criminal's face,
made a warning gesture.</p>

<p>"Then this 'ere bloke's Bob Hardy. I thought so."</p>

<p>Matthews turned to face the star reporter. "The boys says as
you're straight. Will you back 'is word."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How close 'ave you got to the doctor?" The criminal turned
to Dixon.</p>

<p>"We shall arrest him any day now."</p>

<p>"Aw!" Matthews spat in disgust. "Why can't you 'dicks' talk
straight? Give a chap some proof. You're all kid stakes."</p>

<p>"Robert Hardy has been until to-night a prisoner in Dr.
Night's house. He escaped this evening."</p>

<p>Dixon made the reply with studied simplicity.</p>

<p>"You've been a prisoner of the doctor's?" Matthews looked
incredulous. "How did'ja come t'escape?"</p>

<p>"Got out of the window. Quite easy," laughed the journalist.
"Believe I could get in again in the same way. That is if I
wanted to."</p>

<p>"A lie." The young criminal exclaimed passionately. "I'm in
an' you knows it,' but yer can't help lyin' time. It ain't
fair."</p>

<p>"Last night I watched Dr. Night and Humberson come through
the sliding panel by the fireplace in the Doctor's study,"
replied Hardy.</p>

<p>A look of awe came into the criminal's face. Going close to
Hardy he peered right down into his eyes, "Give me yer 'davy'
yer speakin' the truth an' I'll believe yer."</p>

<p>Matthews continued to stare intently into Hardy's eyes.
"Lor', if you can put one over the Doctor you're the only man in
Australia as 'as done it. I'll take yer word."</p>

<p>Hardy held out his hand. "There's my hand; I'm speaking the
truth," said the journalist, earnestly. "I'm out to get the
scalp of Dr. Night and wear it."</p>

<p>"I believe yer." The young criminal grasped the proffered
hand for a moment. Then he swung towards the detective-sergeant.</p>

<p>"Where's that warrant, mate? Hurry up!"</p>

<p>At a nod from the Superintendent, the detective produced the
warrant and gravely and formally arrested Matthews for the theft
of certain imitation gold pencil cases from an American
commercial traveller named Zimmermann.</p>

<p>"Now I'll talk," said Matthews, easily, taking his seat
opposite the Superintendent. "When I'm through you'll send me
down to Long Bay. It's the only place I knows ov as where the
Doctor can't get me."</p>

<p>"Yer nearly caught me when yer sed as Captain' Kettle 'ad
sent me 'is regards." Matthews spoke to Superintendent Dixon. "I
thought for th' moment you'd collared 'im. D'yer know where 'e
is?"</p>

<p>"There's a record of a man of that name being in gaol in New
Zealand," answered the Superintendent grimly.</p>

<p>"So I 'eard in Melbourne," Matthews smiled broadly. "But,
from wot a Sydney bloke told me it seems as 'ow 'e's somewhere
in this city, at the moment."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Frost sharply.</p>

<p>"You've had a lot ov snow run ov late, ain't yer. Well,
Captain Kettle's the best snow-runner as Dr. Night 'as. You've
caught me out on the question, by Zimmerman and 'is dud pencils.
Well, it was those pencils as brought me in touch with Captain
Kettle," continued the young criminal, after a somewhat lengthy
pause. "I 'ad the tip t' go t' him with the goods. I did, an'
'e put me wise as to where to get rid ov 'em."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">"I SUPPOSE he then made you an offer to join up
with him in the snow running?" asked the journalist
casually.</p>

<p>"Kerreck. That's jest wot 'e did. He 'ad a place in William
Street where 'e 'ad a small printin' plant."</p>

<p>"That's news," observed Dixon. "What was the object of the
plant? Snide notes?"</p>

<p>"Nothing so risky, guv'nor. Y'know th' straight trade in them
drugs&mdash;th' snow an' th' mud&mdash;is in th' hands of a big
American company. Well, t'get th' dud stuff as Dr. Night brings
t' Sydney, on th' market without givin' the game away. It 'as
ter 'ave a name on th' label. You'd be surprised to know th'
stuff they sells t' the dinkum chemists. Straight stuff, I mean.
Good as wot's sol' under the dinkum label. Why, mor'n 'arf th'
chemists in Australia buys th' stuff from Dr. Night's chaps an'
thinks they're gettin' th' dinkum goods with th' white mark on
'em."</p>

<p>"Then this Captain Kettle uses his printing press only for
the purpose of forging labels for illicit drugs," commented
Dixon.</p>

<p>"An' good enough at that," answered the snow-runner. "There's
a sight more of the stuff comin' into the country as you demons
think of. Why, Capt'n Kettle 'ad two men allus at work at th'
plant. That 'e did!"</p>

<p>"Well, get along with your story," snapped Frost
aggressively. It hurt the pride of the police officer to learn
that so extensive a drug trade was being carried on under the
eyes of the Department.</p>

<p>"All right! Give a bloke a chance. Y'see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where did he get the glass tubes for the stuff, Matthews?"
interjected Hardy.</p>

<p>"Lor'! There's plenty of glass blowers in Australia who'd
supply all th' Capt'n wanted. 'E 'ad a office somewhere in th'
city and they fairly pestered 'is life out for orders."</p>

<p>"Surely they knew that bottles were being used for illegal
purposes," questioned Thomas sharply.</p>

<p>"Who'd worry?" The rogue grinned broadly. "There's plenty as
puts on th' dog of a dinkum life as don't worry as where th'
dough comes from. Orders is orders, they ses, as so long as they
don't get th' straight tip as th' stuff is on th' side they
ain't going ter ask questions. I'm a-tellin' yer, the Cap and
Dr. Night could get all th' bottles an' stuff they
wanted&mdash;and no questions asked."</p>

<p>"Get on from where this Captain Kettle brought you into the
game," ordered Dixon.</p>

<p>"Right-o. When th' Capt'n found out th' lay I was on, 'e
knows as how 'e'could trust me. So 'e put it up ter me straight
an' shows me as' how I could make a sight more 'oof with Jim in'
danglin' soaks for their goods. Seein' as 'ow it's a safe lay so
long as a bloke keeps 'is head, I was on."</p>

<p>"What did you get out of it?" asked the journalist.</p>

<p>"Them bottles used to 'old somethin' like an ounce of th'
stuff, an' I made 'alf-a-note outer every one got rid of. Why,
one week I shot out a 'undred of em and walked about with a roll
as big as a bookmaker. It was risky pressin' it too hard, but
in' an' out I 'made a level twenty quildlets a week, all
round."</p>

<p>"How did you get out of it, Bill?" asked the superintendent
curiously.</p>

<p>"Got greedy, that's how. Y'see, it happened as sometimes the
doctor'd run short. Not as that 'appened often, but when it did
I thought as 'ow I saw me way clear to make a bit on th' side.
Struck on a mixture as looked so like the dinkum stuff as you
'ad to taste it to know wha's wot."</p>

<p>"You tried to make a bit on the side," suggested the
Inspector.</p>

<p>"Right again. An' I got caught. It was like this. There's a
bloke as lives in Darlinghurst. I ain't goin' ter give him away,
so you needn't ask no questions about 'im.' 'E mada fine thing
outer th' snow. The Capt'n used t'hand it to him direct before I
came into th' game. Then 'e let 'im 'ave it through me. It
'appened as once he came to me an' wanted a lot of the dope an'
the' doctor 'adn't it. The Capt'n 'ad gone to New Zealand an' I
was gettin' the' stuff direct, from th' Doctor. I tried to show
'im as 'ow 'e 'ad'nt to supply this bird, but 'e's a bit offish
an' wouldn't listen t'me. So I thought I'd make a bit on me own
an' keep th' bloke quiet at the same time. I 'ad a lot of the
labels an' the' bottles an' all that, as the Capt'n 'ad let me
'ave afore he went away."</p>

<p>"So you made up a dud lot and gave it to him?" suggested
Dixon.</p>

<p>"D'yer take me for a mug?" The snow-runner's face was a study
in disgust as he digested the Superintendent's question. "Why,
that bloke's as fly as they make 'em. 'E'd have spotted th' fake
at once. No, I 'ad a better game than that. I 'ad a lot of th'
straight stuff as th' Doctor 'ad given me to hand to a bloke as
was comin' from the country. It was at my digs awaitin' for 'im.
I give that to Di&mdash;&mdash; th' Darlinghurst bloke an' then
started, an' filled a lot ov bottles with the faked stuff.
Y'see, I 'appened I' know the' joint where 'e an' 'is pal 'ung
out. It wasn't difficult to 'ang around until 'e and 'is 'pal
was out, an' then t' change th' straight stuff for the fake. I'd
have given a couple of notes t'see 'is face when he found out
what'd happened."</p>

<p>"Go on, Bill," said Hardy encouragingly. "You're getting
distinctly interesting."</p>

<p>"Glad it amuses you," Matthews answered drily. "I wasn't.
Y'see, 'e 'appened to spot as it was me as rung the changes an'
'e came after me wi' a gun. It got so 'ot as I thought I'd fade
away for a time. So I went ter Melbourne."</p>

<p>"And left your mother, sister and brother to be terrorised
and a beaten up by thugs," exclaimed the Superintendent
disgustedly.</p>

<p>"I ain't as bad as that," protested the young criminal
aggressively. "I never thought 'e'd play that game. I didn't
know of it until one ov th' Melbourne papers printed somethin'
as was in the <i>Mirror</i>. I was comin' back to 'ave a
friendly talk wi' D&mdash;wiv 'im an' 'is crowd&mdash;when the
'demons' nabbed me."</p>

<p>"A talk with a gun in each hand," suggested the journalist.
"Good thing for you the police found you in Melbourne. Possibly
saved your neck."</p>

<p>"What were you doing in Melbourne?" asked Dixon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="first">MATHEWS hesitated a moment before answering.
Then he burst out laughing. "There was a bit in the
<i>Mirror</i> about a committee being formed in Melbourne to
fight th' drug traffic wasn't there?"</p>

<p>The snow-runner turned to Hardy, who nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Well, I was workin' for that committee. 'Lor', it was just
great."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Dixon angrily. "I want the truth
and none of your lies. That committee was straight. Why, some of
the best people in Melbourne were on it."</p>

<p>"Keep yer 'air on," retorted. Matthews easily. "I'm givin'
yer the straight goods, ain't I? It was one of th' doctor's
jokes, an' 'e's a rare hand at 'em.' Of course, they thought as
they were straight. They wouldn't be anythin' else but they
couldn't 'ave been of any use to us if they 'adn't been
straight. All th' same, th' doctor 'ad some 'igh-toned pals down
there an' 'e put up one of 'em to start th' business, 'e was
straight an' 'e didn't know but what the doctor wasn't straight,
too. Th' doctor put 'em up ter it an' got 'em to get hold ov me,
t' show 'em th' ropes. I was to be a chap as had run the goods
an' 'ad got th' 'allelujah bug. They simply ate it."</p>

<p>"The idea being that while you were pretending to help the
committee you were creating avenues for the disposal of illicit
drugs provided by Dr. Night?"</p>

<p>"Gee-hos-ho-phat!" The young scoundrel, looked at the
<i>Mirror's</i> managing editor with well-feigned admiration.
"Why ain't yer pickin' winners at th' trots, mister? You're a
wonder. 'Course you've 'it it. It was a good plan, but somehow it
went wrong. Any'ow, th' committee didn't cover me and I was
taken for bein' in bad company or some such rot an' brought me
'ere. Of course, I've tumbled to it now."</p>

<p>"Where is Captain Kettle now? What is his real name?" asked
the Superintendent sharply.</p>

<p>"Where is Capt'n Kettle?" repeated Matthews slowly. "Well, I
guess you won't find 'im far from th' doctor, 'e ain't no fool
where th' dibs are concerned. Who is 'e? Ask me another. 'E's
th' flyest bloke as ever walked Australia. What is his name? 'e's
'ad a dozen as I knows of, an' if you went after any of them
you'd think them as straight as a bishop. 'E's a wonder, that's
wot 'e is!"</p>

<p>Dixon pressed the point and the snow-runner gave a list of
names under which Captain Kettle had conducted businesses in
Sydney. None of the names had come under the suspicion of the
police, and in the case of two of the names Frost declared the
names were those of well-known integrity.</p>

<p>"What is Captain Kettle's real name?" asked Hardy.</p>

<p>"I've told you I don't know, I'd tell yer it I did. I've
known 'im to 'ave twenty and I'd bet that not one' of 'em was
wished on t'im before 'e could yell."</p>

<p>"What is he like?"</p>

<p>"Like? Why, 'e's th' picture of th' bloke on the cover ov th'
book ov the same name. I bought it 'cos I thought it was about
'im. Like as two peas, they is."</p>

<p>"That say, Captain Kettle is about middle height, slender
built, brown hair and beard cut to a point."</p>

<p>"That's 'im."</p>

<p>"What is Dr. Night like?" continued Hardy.</p>

<p>"Oh, 'e's as grey as a 'orse, y'know. Grey all over."</p>

<p>"Middle height, grey hair, no beard or moustache," repeated
Hardy.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Just the same as Captain Kettle except for the hair on his
face, his colouring&mdash;and his clothes."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Frost sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"That Dr. Night and Captain Kettle were, and are, one and the
same person."</p>

<p>"By jingo!" exclaimed the snow-runner excitedly. "I believe
this writing chap 'as it! Allus thought I knew, th' doctor when
I first saw him. Seemed familiar like."</p>

<p>"A somewhat wide conclusion," remarked Thomas with a smile.
"Yet it may be correct."</p>

<p>"Who killed Smithson, Billy?" asked Frost, bending forward
and looking intently into Matthews' eyes.</p>

<p>"Dr. Night," came the straight answer.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>Matthews turned deliberately in his chair and looked at the
journalist before replying.</p>

<p>"There was somethin' in the paper about you findin' a bottle
ov 'snow' in your doss one evenin', Mr. Hardy?" he asked,
after some considerable pause.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You didn't touch it?"</p>

<p>"Only while I had gloves on. Why, Bill?"</p>

<p>"Thought so. Of course, I knows nuffin', but I guess that if
Smithson 'ad been' as wise as you 'e'd been alive to-day. You
found a bit ov glass in his trousers. Per'aps it fell there when
th' boozy fool felt the stuff th' doctor painted the bottle
with."</p>

<p>Hardy was about to question further when the telephone bell
rang. Dixon lifted the receiver and listened for a minute. Then
he pushed the instrument towards Hardy.</p>

<p>"Someone wants to speak to you, Bob. Wouldn't give a
name."</p>

<p>"Hardy speaking. Who's there?"</p>

<p>Unaccountably the journalist had a feeling of impending
disaster.</p>

<p>"Dr. Night is speaking," came the well-known, precise voice.
"As you have left my house without my permission, I have
persuaded Miss Blayde to become my guest."</p>

<p>"That fiend has captured Doris!" Hardy looked round on the
five men, his face ashen grey. "I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Steady, boy!" Inspector Frost sprang to his side and
snatched the receiver from his hand. The instrument was dead,
and his inquiries at the switchboard went to show that the
master-criminal had hung up immediately he had delivered his
ominous message.</p>

<p>"Chief, order out a car for us, I am going with Bob to Potts
Point to see what truth there is in this message."</p>

<p>The journalist was standing by the desk, his eyes gazing into
space. Twice Frost touched him on the arm, and the newspaperman
took no notice. Then the detective placed his arm across Hardy's
shoulders and led him from the room.</p>

<p>A car was drawing up before the main entrance. Frost shoved
the newspaper man in and, after a muttered word to the driver,
closed the door. The car immediately started off at a good
pace.</p>

<p>Hardy lay back in a corner, his eyes closed, trying to steady
his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Nothing to worry about." The words uttered by Frost struck
dully on the journalist's brain. "Dixon will have given orders
to have the place surrounded by now. The old scoundrel may have
abducted Miss Blayde, but he can't get away with it. He's in
that house with his prisoner and gang, and there we'll find
them."</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked Hardy at length.</p>

<p>"Holmhurst, first." Frost spoke crisply. "See what Mr. Blayde
knows. For all we know, Dr. Night might be drawing a red
herring across the trail."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's true enough." The journalist had abandoned his
attitude of despair and spoke with a return of his normal
energy. "He's got her, that's certain. Don't talk, Frost. I
want to think."</p>

<p>The car sped on through the darkness of the late night. Here
and there the faint light of some shop or street lamp dimly
illuminated the interior of the speeding car for a brief moment,
casting grotesque shadows on the forms of the two men. Then,
with a sudden jerk, the car swung round to the left and ran up
the gravelled path lending to Mr. Blayde's house.</p>

<p>"This way," called Hardy, impatiently, as he jumped from the
car. He ran down to the side door and turned the latch. As he
had suspected, the door was unfastened. At the library door, he
hesitated a moment, and then entered quietly, followed by the
detective.</p>

<p>"Where is Doris?" Hardy demanded in a low tone, as Mr. Blayde
rose from his chair.</p>

<p>"Doris?" queried Mr. Blayde, noting the journalist's pale
face and agitated manner.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Never mind me," answered Hardy, savagely. "Is Doris at
home."</p>

<p>"She went to Coogee this afternoon to visit a friend." Mr.
Blayde looked at his watch. "She is late, I don't like her
driving through the streets so late at night."</p>

<p>"She won't come home," Hardy laughed wildly. "That half-caste
devil has got her."</p>

<p>"Sit down." Frost took the journalist, by the shoulders and
forced him into a chair. Then he turned to Mr. Blayde and in a
few words recounted the telephone message from the
master-criminal.</p>

<p>"Bob seems to think that the position is serious, but the
house is surrounded and at the worst Miss Blayde will only
suffer a few hours temporary inconvenience."</p>

<p>The Inspector's quiet authoritative manner immediately
quieted the alarm the master of "Holmhurst" had felt. With the
usual Anglo-Saxon firm faith in the ability of the police he was
willing to believe Frost and discount the journalist's
dejection. In fact, so impressive was the Inspector that Hardy
had begun to recover his poise.</p>

<p>Frost crossed to the sideboard and mixed three stiff glasses
of whisky and soda. "Drink this, Bob," he said firmly. "We know
where the girl is. Dr. Night made his first mistake in giving
you that information. We have the place surrounded and not even
the cat will be able to get in and out without our knowledge.
Now, if that man had any brains he could have taken her to
half a hundred places in Sydney where we might have searched in vain
for days, to find her. When you're ready we'll go over and see
what our men have done. When our posts, are secure and the place
surrounded we have only to walk in and rescue Miss Blayde and
round up the gang. Why, it's sweet!"</p>

<p>"No. You don't know that devil like I do, Frost." The
journalist spoke firmly. "Your method might serve with the
ordinary kidnapper but Dr. Night is too clever. A police raid on
the house would only result in the complete disappearance of
Doris. He threatened to send her to China to become&mdash;"
Hardy shuddered at the recollection of the master-criminal's
threat, but he did not lose his nerve again. For some moments he
stood, lost in thought.</p>

<p>Then he turned to the two men.</p>

<p>"I'm going back," he declared quietly. "It is the better way.
Perhaps, then. Dr. Night will let Doris go free."</p>

<p>"Going back?"</p>

<p>Frost stared at the journalist in astonishment. "You're mad,
Bob. Why, he'll eat you!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="first">"I DON'T think so. Doris is only a pawn in the
game. For some reason the Doctor wants to control me. Over and
over again he indicated as much to me during the days I lived at
that house."</p>

<p>"For what reason?" The detective was frankly puzzled.</p>

<p>"There you beat me." Hardy turned to Mr. Blayde. "Don't you
agree with me. Even if I am wrong I shall be in the house and
possibly able to assist Doris, if not able to free her
immediately."</p>

<p>"It's a risk. Bob." The master of "Holmhurst" spoke slowly.
"As the Inspector says, he may hold the two of you and thus
double his ability to arrange a compromise with the
authorities."</p>

<p>"There's no question of compromise," exclaimed Frost sharply.
"You appear to forget that Dr. Night is a murderer and that a
warrant is in existence for his arrest on the charge of the
death of the man Smithson. The Government cannot deal with Dr.
Night except in one way."</p>

<p>"I'll take the risk." Hardy spoke impatiently. "I got out of
the place in a manner it is unlikely the gang have discovered. I
can get in the same way, with a little luck. Until Dr. Night
solved that puzzle I shall have a certain advantage over him,
and I think I know how to make the best of it."</p>

<p>Blayde showed a disposition to agree with the journalist and
the Inspector was quick to recognise this. More, he had some
experience of the futility of trying to control Hardy. Quickly
he charged his line of argument.</p>

<p>"Very well." He reached for the telephone. "I'll get a few
extra men and we'll all go in the same way."</p>

<p>Hardy covered the mouthpiece of the instrument with his hand.
"Nothing doing, Frost," he said, firmly. "It takes time to
organise a successful raid. Give me twenty four hours' start and
then come on and do you're damndest. I'll be ready for you
then."</p>

<p>"I agree with Bob." Blayde spoke, suddenly. "If he can get
back the way he came out and without Dr. Night discovering his
methods he will hold a great advantage. The man will be
stalemated for the time and uncertain how to act. Bob will
possibly have a certain freedom of movement, and if during the
next twenty-four hours he can locate Doris he can warn her of
your attack and take means to safeguard her from any eleventh
hour vengeance from the gang. Besides, with Bob inside the
house, your attack will be free from many difficulties."</p>

<p>"I'm going, Frost," added the journalist quietly. "And you
cannot stop me. Come with me and I will show you how I escaped
and how you will get in to-morrow. I shall be expecting you
immediately after dark."</p>

<p>The Inspector made a gesture of resignation. With Blayde
definitely on the side of the journalist it was impossible for
him to hold out. A few words advised Hardy of the line of attack
he proposed. Then he picked up his hat and followed the
journalist from the room. At the side door Hardy held out his
hand to Blayde.</p>

<p>"I'll bring her back, Mr. Blayde," he said earnestly. "Or I
shan't come back at all. You can rely on that. Come on, Frost."
Carelessly he walked down to the boundary wall and climbed over,
followed by the Inspector.</p>

<p>Once in the grounds of "Forest Home" he proceeded with
greater caution. He had expected the grounds to be patrolled by
Chinese guards, but to his surprise they appeared to be
deserted. For some time he hung about the fringe of the trees,
keeping well in the shadows.</p>

<p>"Queer," he muttered. Then, with a caution to the Inspector to
remain hidden, he commenced to circle the house. Both house and
grounds were deserted, so far as he could discover.</p>

<p>Arriving at the gap in the trees beside the boundary wall he
sat down on the turf and for some minutes was lost in
thought.</p>

<p>"Where are your watchers?" He whispered quietly to the
Inspector.</p>

<p>"Don't know." Frost was evidently worried. "Dixon would act
quickly, I'm certain of that. Yet there's no one about. I'm
going to see." Rising to his feet the Inspector stole down to
the big entrance gates, followed by the journalist. Outside he
whistled softly. A man materialised from tile shadows and came
forward.</p>

<p>"What's the game?" asked the Inspector sharply. "I thought
this house was closely guarded."</p>

<p>"Orders are to ring the place but not to go inside the
grounds of 'Holmhurst' or 'Forest Home,'" replied the man
quietly. "The Superintendent said that you would take charge
sometime to-night and would make your own dispositions."</p>

<p>"Good! Carry on for the time. I'll see you later."</p>

<p>Frost turned to Hardy much relieved.</p>

<p>"Now, Bob. If you're going on with your fool stunt, get to
it. Seems the place is deserted or Dr. Night is confident he can
repel any attack on the house. We'll see how that works out,
later. I'll be here until I'm certain you're back in your prison
safely. Then, to-morrow night I'll raid this place at nine
o'clock. But if there's any trouble any old time, I'm coming in
on the run. Get me."</p>

<p>"Right." Hardy led the way back to the side of the house
opposite "Holmhurst."</p>

<p>"Now watch and see how I get in. It will be your line of
attack to-morrow night, and if I can work it you will meet with
no opposition."</p>

<p>Opposite the window by which he had escaped from "Forest
Home" the journalist halted. A quick glance round, and he
crossed the patch of grass until he stood close up against the
verandah. Frost crouched in the shadows watching him. A
frail-looking lattice made a precarious route to the roof of the
verandah.</p>

<p>Once there the journalist tested the window. It was not
locked. Raising it cautiously the newspaper-man crept into the
box room and partly shut the window. He flashed his torchlight
on the lumber. His kit of burglar tools were as he had left
them. Picking up the skeleton key he turned and waved a farewell
to the hidden police officer, before completely shutting the
window.</p>

<p>The key turned easily in the door leading to the corridor.
Opening the door a crack he peered out. The corridor was lit,
but apparently deserted. Slipping off his boots, the journalist
tip-toed swiftly to the door of his rooms and slid the master-key
in the lock.</p>

<p>Once more he was back, a prisoner of Dr. Night.</p>

<p>Hardy examined the rooms. They were just as he had left them
a few hours before; even the book he had been reading up to the
minute of his escape lay on the table beside the tray of glasses
and the spirits tantalus. With a sudden impulse the journalist
opened the door again and carefully examined the lock.</p>

<p>Why had Dr. Night left the prison unaltered? Had he
forecasted that the journalist would return to his prison house,
when he heard that the gang of criminals had captured Doris
Blayde? It seemed possible; yet, so far as he knew, no watchers
had been posted to discover how he had left and re-entered the
house.</p>

<p>He had the key to the door of his prison. So long as he
retained that and the master-criminal did not load the door with
fresh fastenings, the way was open to him. But, first he had to
find and release Doris; and after that, to make smooth, so far
as lay in his power, the path of Inspector Frost and the raiding
party.</p>

<p>"Never thought to be back here again," muttered the
journalist. Then he looked round the room again, seeking a
hiding place for the master-key that had now become of supreme
importance. A few minutes' thought, and he crossed to the window
and stretched his arm between the bars. He could just reach the
roof of the verandah. It would prove a good hiding place for the
key during the few hours he proposed to remain at "Forest
Home."</p>

<p>Then he went into his bedroom and undressed.</p>

<p>"Wonder what time the old doctor will call me in the morning,
and what sort of beastly temper he will be in?" were his last
two waking thoughts!</p>

<p>A heavy hand pressed firmly on his shoulder awakened Hardy.
Dazedly opening his eyes, he found the daylight streaming in at
the window. Rolling over, he looked into the sombre grey eyes of
Dr. Night.</p>

<p>"My guest sleeps far into the day," observed the Doctor,
suavely.</p>

<p>"Nothing much else to do here," replied Hardy with a yawn
that was only half-feigned.</p>

<p>"So? I had formed the opinion that my guest had found
sufficient to amuse him." There was cold menace in Dr. Night's
voice.</p>

<p>The journalist did not answer.</p>

<p>In spite of a nerve that had pulled him through many a crisis
in his career, he could not suppress a certain awe of this
mysterious personality. "My guest does not appear willing to
confide in me," continued the master-criminal in the same
curious monotone.</p>

<p>"The positions of the prisoner and gaoler do not usually lead
to confidences," observed. Hardy sarcastically. "I duly received
your telephone message&mdash;and came back."</p>

<p>"You were comfortable here? My servants attended to your
wants? There was nothing possible for your comfort that was left
unaccomplished?"</p>

<p>"Only the matter of an open door," commented Hardy. He was
determined that the Doctor should broach the subject of the
capture of Doris.</p>

<p>"It is possible that I may be able to offer that privilege in
the near future."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="first">"THEN you realise that your plans have failed?"
asked the newspaper man, quickly.</p>

<p>"By no means," Dr. Night spoke with more animation than he
had formerly exhibited. "My plans are complete and now only
await your agreement to what I have to propose to you, to put
them into immediate operation."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will have to wait a long time for my help in
your criminal activities," observed Hardy, grimly.</p>

<p>"Not at all. Your recent actions have placed me in a position
to make certain demands on you, demands you dare not refuse to
comply with."</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"You have not chosen to confide in me your recent actions and
the reasons for them." Dr. Night had reverted to his usual
smooth monotone. "I must therefore ask you certain questions."</p>

<p>"I shall not consider myself bound to answer." A thrill of
excitement crept into the newspaper man's voice. The crisis had
come sooner than he had expected, but he had no fear.</p>

<p>"I require to know my guest's movements since he left my
house last night. I require to know how my guest left my house
and the manner of his return."</p>

<p>"Why ask me?" The journalist was fencing to know how much the
master-criminal and his spies had discovered. "You spoke to me
on the telephone at Police Headquarters, last night, or rather
early this morning."</p>

<p>"I require to know how my guest left and returned to this
house."</p>

<p>"I shall not answer."</p>

<p>"I require to know for what reason my guest visited the
police last evening."</p>

<p>The Doctor did hot seem to be perturbed at Hardy's refusal to
answer.</p>

<p>"I shall not answer those questions."</p>

<p>"My guest is aware that I have gained possession of the
person of Miss Doris Blayde?"</p>

<p>"You devil!" Hardy could restrain himself no longer. "What
manner of man are you to war on women?"</p>

<p>The fathomless, expressive eyes of the master-criminal met
Hardy's, and the journalist felt the anger die in his breast.
The eyes fascinated him; grey as the depths of a wind-beaten
sea; fathomless as the ocean; they held a quality he could not
understand but which beat his will to almost submission. Dully,
he sat down on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>"I have kept my promise. The girl is here because you failed
to comply with the conditions I laid down for your conduct.
Dress yourself, Robert Hardy. It is my will that you see
her."</p>

<p>The Doctor seated himself on a chair some distance from the
bed and watched Hardy dress. The journalist spun the business
out into almost a ceremony, yet the master-criminal showed no
signs of impatience. At length, Hardy signified that he was
ready.</p>

<p>Without a word Dr. Night led the way to the door.</p>

<p>He was about to see Doris, yet Hardy had no plan formed to
obtain her freedom. Dr. Night had acted too suddenly. Hardy had
gone to bed determined to awaken with the first beams of
daylight and to formulate some plans for the girl's release. Now
he was following the master-criminal to the place where she was
confined&mdash;helpless and planless.</p>

<p>Out in the corridor the journalist expected to find a guard
of Chinese ready to overcome any signs of resistance on his
part. Instead he found the place apparently deserted.</p>

<p>Dr. Night turned to the right and led the way down the
corridor in the direction of the box room. At a door half-way
between Hardy's room and the end of the corridor, the
master-criminal stopped. A key was in the door look. He turned it
and stood to one side, motioning the journalist to enter.</p>

<p>The girl was seated in an arm-chair by the window, looking
out over the harbour. At the sound of the opening of the door
she turned her head and then sprang to her feet "Bob!"</p>

<p>"Doris!"</p>

<p>"I knew that you would come soon." The girl spoke bravely;
then suddenly burst into tears and fell into the journalist's
arms.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, dear." Hardy stroked her hair gently. "I'll get
you out of this, somehow. Don't cry, dear."</p>

<p>"Miss Blayde should understand that she was brought here as
hostage for you," said the master-criminal with a ghost of a
smile.</p>

<p>"Well, I've returned. What more do you want?" Hardy choked
back the hot words that rose to his lips. That this man should
dare to treat Doris so. "There is no reason for detaining Miss
Blayde, now."</p>

<p>"Miss Blayde must remain here," Dr. Night spoke with
finality.</p>

<p>"I'm damned if she will!"</p>

<p>"That is a matter we will discuss later."</p>

<p>The master-criminal shrugged.</p>

<p>"Look here." Hardy put the girl from him gently and strode
over until he towered above the slim form of the crime master.
"We are here alone. I noted that you had none of your gang in
the corridor. I could choke you insensible and then walk out of
the place, as I did last night. And, by Jove, I'll do it if you
don't obey orders. Right, about turn and quick march.' D'you
hear?"</p>

<p>Dr. Night stood with his hands folded before him, his eyes
downcast. At Hardy's approach, he stepped quickly aside. As the
journalist caught hold of the door-handle he spoke; a cruel
smile twisting his lips.</p>

<p>"I would advise caution."</p>

<p>For answer, Hardy swung open the door. In the corridor, and
facing him stood a couple of hefty-looking Chinese, armed with
automatic pistols.</p>

<p>"These men answer with their lives for your escape." Again
the master-criminal spoke in the slow, suave tones. For a few
minutes the journalist stood staring from the guards to their
master. Then, with a gesture of impotent anger, he flung the
door shut.</p>

<p>"My guest has, I observe, some discretion. I should have been
sorry to see the hands of my base-born servants pollute his
honourable person. We will talk."</p>

<p>Dr. Night seated himself, and motioned to Doris and Hardy to
be seated. After a moment's hesitation the girl went to a seat
on a lounge.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" Hardy strode forward until he again stood
over the master-criminal.</p>

<p>"There are many things I desire." Dr. Night smiled softly.
"First it is my desire that my guest be seated."</p>

<p>The journalist was about to reply impatiently when he caught
Doris' eyes. The girl beckoned him and, after a moment's
hesitation, he went and seated himself beside her. "Well?"</p>

<p>"Good! Now we will talk. A man who suffers under defeat is a
plaything for the gods. My guest is of those who smile on
adversity and promise that the future shall pay to them of its
treasures."</p>

<p>"What is all this leading to?" Hardy asked the question
angrily. "Do you think that you can keep Miss Blayde and I
prisoners indefinitely, and get away with it. Inspector Frost
knows that we are here. Unless Miss Blayde is released
immediately, he will raid the place. I can promise you that he
will not go away empty-handed."</p>

<p>"He shall find you if he comes here." There was deep menace
In the voice of the master-criminal. "Yes, he shall find
you&mdash;but he shall not find her."</p>

<p>Hardy was silent for some minutes. He could not disregard the
menace in the Doctor's voice. It was a direct threat of murder
to him; and something, incredibly worse for the girl.</p>

<p>"Look here. Dr. Night." Hardy forced himself to plead with
this murderer. "This farce is about played out. Miss Blayde
comes of a well known and influential family. Any injury to her
will cause you to be hounded throughout the world. As for me,
well&mdash;I'll stay here, it you're so keen on it; but you must
let her go. You know, it just isn't done."</p>

<p>"I have spoken."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all nonsense." The journalist forced a smile.
"There's such a thing as law, you know."</p>

<p>"I am above all laws." The statement, absurd as it sounded,
froze the dawning smile on Hardy's' lips. There was a note in
Dr. Night's voice that carried the conviction that the Doctor
believed that he was supreme among men. The journalist looked at
the slight figure seated before him, and wondered. He knew this
man to hold absolute power over a large band of criminals,
mainly foreigners. He had, at his command, a body of men who
could withstand the forces of law and order in a city of a
million souls. It was impossible!</p>

<p>"That's all right, Doctor." The journalist tried to continue
the negotiations he had commenced. "You may think so. You might
have reason to believe so in China, but you're in a white man's
country here and we're strong for law and order. Every man's
equal and that sort of thing. Now take my own case. When you
locked me up for the night I just sat down and thought out how
to get in touch with my friends. I did it, you know, though I'm
not boasting about it. It's the same now. I'll confess I haven't
a ghost of a plan, but I'll find&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are my guest. Miss Blayde is my prisoner." Dr. Night
slowly raised his eyes and looked at the journalist. "It is my
will that you remain here. Should you attempt to escape, you
know the penalty."</p>

<p>"The absurd threat against Miss Blayde?" Hardy attempted to
laugh.</p>

<p>"That threat I have, in part, carried out. Miss Blayde is
here, a prisoner in my house. It is for you to decide if she is
to pass from my keeping to those who greatly desire her."</p>

<p>"With the whole of Sydney in an uproar over her abduction?"
Hardy threw all the scorn he could muster into his voice. "I
tell you again, unless Miss Blayde is immediately freed the
police will come in search of her."</p>

<p>"The police will not act until to-night." There was decision
in the voice of the master-criminal. "By that time she will be
free&mdash;or on her way to China&mdash;to disappear for
over."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Her destination is for you to decide."</p>

<p>"In what manner?"</p>

<p>"You would not remain here as my guest. Now you must remain
here as partner in my work."</p>

<p>"I refuse."</p>

<p>Dr. Night shrugged. He rose from his seat and clapped his
hands. The door opened and the Chinese guards entered. The
master-criminal spoke to them in guttural tones. Then he turned
to Hardy.</p>

<p>"Miss Blayde will be taken from here to-night for a
destination I will not name." He spoke in his low, monotonous
voice. "You, Mr. Hardy, will return to your rooms. You will have
until the time set for her departure for meditation. I shall
require your answer, then. I think you will reflect deeply."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="first">AT the ominous words of the master-criminal,
Doris cried out sharply and clung to Hardy. It was some time
before the journalist could pacify her. Then with a whispered
reassurance that help would be forthcoming before any harm could
come to her, he left the room and joined the master-criminal in
the corridor. Immediately the door of Doris's room was shut and
locked.</p>

<p>The Doctor turned and walked down the corridor to Hardy's
room. As one of the guards swung open the door, a man hurried
along the corridor and caught Dr. Night by the arm.</p>

<p>"The 'demons' have got Matthews" he cried breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I had the news of the capture by the police of William
Matthews in Melbourne, some days ago," replied the Doctor,
quietly.</p>

<p>"He's in Sydney."</p>

<p>For the first time Dr. Night showed some uneasiness. He
flashed a quick look at the journalist.</p>

<p>"How did you learn this, Humberson?"</p>

<p>"Matthews was brought to Sydney the day before yesterday and
taken to police headquarters," replied the gunman. "This morning
he was taken into the Central Police Court and charged with the
Zimmerman matter. He was committed for trial and taken
immediately to Long Bay."</p>

<p>"Your visit to the Police Department, my friend," observed
Dr. Night, turning to the journalist. Then he faced the gunman.
"He knows the fate of those who talk of our work?"</p>

<p>"Matthews has split," declared the gunman, emphatically,
"You'd have thought he was precious, the care they took of him.
Johns all over the place and a squad of them to bring him to
court and to take him to jug. He looked as happy as if he was on
a holiday."</p>

<p>For some moments Dr. Night stood at the door of Hardy's
prison rooms, in deep meditation. The news that William Matthews
had been committed to Long Bay prison to await trial evidently
disturbed him. At length he aroused himself and turned to the
journalist, motioning to him to enter the room. It was
impossible for Hardy to disobey, although he would willingly
have lingered in the company of the rogues, to learn further
details.</p>

<p>When the door closed on him, he knelt down and pressed his
ear against the woodwork in an endeavour to catch some fragments
of the conversation. All he could hear were the sounds of the
footsteps of the master-criminal and his companions retreating
towards the head of the stairs. Thrusting his hands in his
pockets, the journalist wandered across the room to the window.
He had a big problem to face and with but a few hours to come to
a decision. Sometime that night, Dr. Night would come to him and
demand his decision on the offer he had made him to join on the
gang's criminal activities. His answer might consign Doris to a
fate unspeakable. To avoid that answer, he would have to
discover some means of escape for the girl, and, at the moment,
he had not a glimmer of an idea how it was to be
accomplished.</p>

<p>Opening the window, Hardy retrieved the master-key and tried
it in the door. The door swung open to his touch. He gave a sign
of relief. One step of the way was open to him. The next problem
was how to get Doris out of the house safely. It was impossible
to think of waiting until night before acting. At any moment Dr.
Night might return for his decision, and Hardy was confident
that the master-criminal would not be content to take his mere
word of adherence to his gang.</p>

<p>Some act, definitely criminal, and committing him body and
soul to their cause, would be demanded; and he could not refuse
while the girl he loved was at their mercy. There was a way;
there must be a way.</p>

<p>For over an hour. Hardy stood at the window looking vacantly
over the waters of the harbour, intent on the problem. Plan
after plan arose in his mind; but in every one lay a big element
of risk to Doris; and he wanted the one plan in which lay
certainty and security. It seemed impossible. Almost he decided
to await the advent of the master-criminal for his answer and
then, by some subterfuge, gain access to Doris's prison. With
his aims around her he would defy Dr. Night.</p>

<p>He was disturbed by the opening of his door. Half fearfully,
he looked around, expecting to face the master-criminal,
awaiting his answer. But it was only his Chinese servant,
carrying the mid-day meal tray. The man set his burden on the
side-board, then deftly proceeded to lay the table. Hardy
watched the man's proceedings in silence. A glimmer of a plan
was forming in his brain. He spoke sharply to the man and was
answered only by a low bow. On previous days the journalist had
attempted to enter into conversation with the attendant, but the
man had refused to utter a word. He had abandoned all attempts
to draw him into a talk. The man did not understand Australian
or had been forbidden to speak to him. The Chinese completed his
task and drew out a chair, waiting for Hardy. The journalist
moved slowly from the window and seated himself at the table. He
had found a chance. Could he develop that chance Into
activity.</p>

<p>Hardy ate slowly. Gradually the plan was taking shape. It
held but one kink. Before he could act with any certainty of
success he must be alone for a few minutes. Given that and Doris
would be free and the stage set to raid the house and capture
the gang. But he must have those few precious moments away from
the eyes of his servitor. The meal dragged on, the Oriental
carrying out the ritual of service in minute manner. Dr. Night
provided, well for his "guest" and the meal was both lengthy and
rich.</p>

<p>"The chutney, please." Hardy spoke with additional emphasis,
yet striving to keep his voice on an impersonal note. He had
found the chance that he had been looking for.</p>

<p>The man bowed low and backed towards the door. Immediately
he had left the room, turning the key in the lock, Hardy darted
into his bedroom and dragged from the ceiling-rose the flexible
cord of the electric light. Then seizing a sheet from the bed he
carried them to the sitting-room and concealed them under the
table.</p>

<p>Then followed a game of patience. Hardy watched the servant
intently, waiting for a moment when the man would be off his
guard. Methodically the man proceeded on his duties, clearing
the table and replacing the cloth with the tantalus of spirits
and glasses.</p>

<p>With a low bow he stood before the journalist, silently
requesting permission to withdraw. As the Chinese straightened
from the bow, Hardy flung a quantity of pepper in his face. With
a strangled cry the man clasped his hands over his eyes. The
journalist flung himself on the blinded man, bearing him to the
floor and choking from his lips the warning cry. The attack was
so sudden that the man made practically no resistance.</p>

<p>In a couple of minutes Hardy had him bound and gagged. Then
he carried him into his bedroom.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later a Chinese servant walked out of the bedroom
into the sitting-room, and stood irresolute. So far Hardy had
succeeded in his plan. Dressed in the clothes of the servant he
would be able to pass through the house with impunity so long as
he avoided other Chinese. In his hand he held the keys of her
prison, taken from the Oriental, then laying bound hand and foot
on his bed.</p>

<p>The master-key opened the door into the corridor. Hardy
stepped out without hesitation. There was no one in it. Walking
stealthily to the head of the stairs, he descended a few steps
until he could see into the hall below. So far as he could
discover the household had not been disturbed by the sounds of
the brief struggle in his room. As he watched, Westerton passed
across the hall, in conversation with the gunman,
Humberston.</p>

<p>Retreating to the corridor he went to the door of his rooms
and locked it. He then walked quietly along the corridor and
after a couple of attempts found the key that unlocked Doris'
door.</p>

<p>The girl was seated by the window, looking out over the
harbour.</p>

<p>She turned at the sound of the opening door and gave a little
cry when she saw the Chinese entering. Closing and locking the
door, Hardy walked towards her, his finger on his lips.</p>

<p>"Bob?"</p>

<p>"Quiet, dear."</p>

<p>"How did you escape, Bob?"</p>

<p>"I haven't yet," Hardy replied grimly. "Listen, dear, I think
I see a way to get you out of this. Will you try,
sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"I shan't be afraid if you are with me, Bob." Doris looked up
fearlessly at her lover.</p>

<p>"That's the rub'," answered the journalist, ruefully. "I
can't let Frost down, so you must go alone."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you are going to remain in this
horrid place?" protested the girl. "Why, Bob, that man will
murder you when he learns that you have freed me."</p>

<p>"Look here, girlie," Hardy rubbed his chin, perplexedly.
"I've got a scheme that will free you and make Dr. Night think
you escaped on your own. It will puzzle him, no end."</p>

<p>"Can't you come, too," protested the girl, somewhat
fearfully.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't if I could," Hardy answered truthfully. "I'm
going to be in at the end of this mystery and by remaining, here
I can help old Frost, no end. If I get you free, I want you to
get in touch with him and tell him what happened. He will
understand. Are you on?"</p>

<p>"I'll try." The girl pursed up her lips determinedly.</p>

<p>"Good!" Hardy opened the door. "I'll back in a moment."</p>

<p>Within a couple of minutes the journalist returned to Doris'
room carrying the bound Chinese. Bidding Doris remain in the
sitting-room he carried his burden into her bedroom and laid him
on the bed. Then he stripped from himself the Chinese clothing.
Carrying the Chinese garments he returned to the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"I want you to put these on, dear. Over your own clothes will
be best. It will make you look bigger. Knock at the door when
you are ready."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="first">RETURNING to the bedroom he replaced the
flexible cord binding the Chinese with one he tore from the
electric light fittings. Then he made a bundle of the sheet and
the cord he had wrapped round the captive and placed them on a
chair, ready to carry to his own rooms.</p>

<p>He had barely completed this task when Doris knocked at the
door. Entering the sitting-room he was faced by a very
presentable Chinese boy.</p>

<p>"What next?" asked the girl, saucily.</p>

<p>"This." Hardy caught the girl in his arms kissed her
passionately. "You're the best and pluckiest girl in the whole
world. Come on!"</p>

<p>He led the way to the box room and retrieved the knotted cord
that he had hidden amid the boxes. Then he opened the window and
got out on the verandah roof. A careful examination of the
grounds on that side of the house showed no signs of watchers.
Turning back to the window, he assisted the girl on to the
roof.</p>

<p>"I'm going to lower you to the ground," he explained
hurriedly. "When you find your feet, get across to the belt of
trees. There's a gap in the brickwork a little way down towards
the water. You can get across it quite easily."</p>

<p>"I understand." Her face was pale but determined. She
realised that not only her own safety but the safety of her
lover lay in her success.</p>

<p>"What am I to tell Inspector Frost?"</p>

<p>"Say that you're at home and say that he's to send men to
guard your home. Frost will understand. He will be here to-night
and we'll make a big clean up."</p>

<p>Hardy slipped the rope under the girl's arms and without
hesitation she climbed over the edge of the roofing and swung to
the ground. Immediately she had freed herself from the rope she
sped towards the belt of trees.</p>

<p>Turning there, she wafted a kiss to her lover, and
disappeared. Hardy waited a moment, then, hearing no alarm, gave
a sigh of relief and re-entered the window.</p>

<p>"She's safe," he muttered, when once again in the corridor.
"Now for the Chink and to set the stage for the Doctor."</p>

<p>In Doris' late prison rooms he set to work to give the place
the appearance of a terrific struggle. Then, with a final glance
at the bonds of the Asian lying on the bed, he picked up the
bundle he had prepared and left the room, locking the corridor
door and leaving the keys in the lock.</p>

<p>"It won't be much to that poor Chink's credit when the doctor
finds him," Hardy chuckled as he made his way swiftly to his own
rooms. "From appearances it will look as if the Chink had paid a
visit to the girl, and had been bound and overpowered by her.
Captured and bound by a girl. Won't he roar?"</p>

<p>In his own room, Hardy remade the bed and repaired the
electric light fitting. Then he tidied the sitting-room and
placed the tray of crockery in the corridor outside the door.
Finally, he locked the door of his room and restored the
master-key to its hiding place on the verandah roof.</p>

<p>"There's only one flaw in the whole act," the journalist
murmured, as he seated himself in his favourite chair by the
window and lit a cigarette. "The Chink will tell his tale,
incriminating me. Will the doctor believe that, or the evidence
I have prepared for him; the evidence that Doris fought and
overpowered the Joss, and escaped? One thing in my favour is
that the doctor will believe the Chink to be lying to get out of
the disgrace of being conquered by a girl. Well, it won't be
long before we know."</p>

<p>The cigarette well alight, Hardy picked up his book and
commenced to read. In a while the book fell to the floor and the
journalist lay back in his chair, meditating.</p>

<p>"She's some peach, sure!" he murmured. Then, after a long
pause, in a soft undertone. "My girl!"</p>

<p>The afternoon drifted by in a long, seemingly interminable,
waiting for the inevitable trouble. Again and again Hardy
crossed to the door of the suite and stood with his ear pressed
against the woodwork, listening intently for the discovery of
Doris Blayde's escape. More than once he had to restrain himself
from recovering the master-key and opening the door to see if
the table utensils he had placed in the corridor were still
there.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the door of his room opened abruptly
and Dr. Night entered. For some moments the master-criminal
stood in the centre of the room, looking intently at his
prisoner. Then he started a casual conversation, asking
seemingly inconsequent questions. While he was talking, Dr.
Night moved continually about the room, his eyes searching every
nook and corner.</p>

<p>Satisfied as to the sitting-room the crime-master muttered an
excuse and visited the bedroom and the adjoining bathroom.
Returning to the sitting-room he abruptly asked his prisoner if
he required anything. Hardy replied that the soda in his syphon
had turned flat and requested that a fresh syphon be sent to his
room.</p>

<p>Dr. Night nodded response and left the room. Some little
while after a strange Chinese servant brought a fresh syphon of
soda water. The journalist was satisfied. He had learned that
the man he had bound and gagged and left in the room occupied by
Doris, had been relieved of his attendance on the prisoner. It
was presumptive evidence that the tale told the master-criminal
was not wholly believed.</p>

<p>Just before dusk there was a commotion in the corridor. It
seemed as if a dozen Chinese were engaged in a talking
competition. At length the cool level tones of Dr. Night mingled
with the Oriental clatter, and there came a lull of sound. The
voice of the master-criminal could be heard distinctly, but he
could not distinguish the words, especially as the doctor
appeared to be giving orders in some dialect of his native
land.</p>

<p>After some time the door of Hardy's room was suddenly thrust
open, and Dr. Night entered, followed by three Chinese, the
centre one of the three being the man Hardy had bound and gagged
and carried to Doris' prison chamber. At the sight of the
journalist seated by the window the man broke into voluble
speech. The master-criminal listened for a few moments, then
struck the man violently across the mouth, silencing him.</p>

<p>"My servant states that you assaulted him, bound him, and
took him to the room occupied by the girl, Doris Blayde, and
there left him," said Dr. Night with ominous calm. "What have
you to answer, Robert Hardy?"</p>

<p>"Is that what all the language was about?" asked the
journalist in apparent surprise, "I thought he was abusing me
because the soda water had turned bad."</p>

<p>"I ask you to reply to the accusation my servant has brought
against you, Robert Hardy." The voice of the master-criminal was
cold and hard. "The tone you adopt is not one with which so
grave at charge should be met."</p>

<p>"Who is your servant that I should condescend to reply to any
charge he may lay against me?" Hardy assumed an air of
indignation.</p>

<p>"It is true that he is of the base born; that his ancestors
are of the things that crawl on the earth," Dr. Night considered
gravely, as he replied slowly, to the journalist. "Yet I would
ask my guest to bear with this slave and from his supreme wisdom
answer the base-born, confounding him."</p>

<p>"It is your wish?" Hardy asked the question.</p>

<p>"The greatness of my guest would honour my unworthiness in
his reply." The master-criminal appeared to forget the veneer of
modernity that he had previously carried before the
journalist.</p>

<p>"I reply with a question to the base born." For some occult
reason Hardy found himself copying the phraseology of the
Chinese despot before him.</p>

<p>"To go to the room occupied by Miss Blayde, I must pass
through that door, pass along the corridor, open the door of the
suite where you have confined Miss Blayde. I suppose you keep
the door of her suite locked as you keep mine?"</p>

<p>"My guest has not answered the accusation my slave has laid
against his supremeness," repeated the doctor, looking intently
at the journalist.</p>

<p>"First, then you must tell me the accusation," countered
Hardy. "I have not the privilege of understanding the lingo your
slave seem so fluent in."</p>

<p>"The base-born accused you of assaulting him; carrying him to
the rooms where the girl was confined; taking the girl from that
place; and of taking from him his garments."</p>

<p>"Then Doris is free?" asked Hardy, simulating joy.</p>

<p>"You are a good actor, Robert Hardy," said Dr. Night, after a
long pause. "Almost I believe you that you speak truly."</p>

<p>"I cannot see you taking any other course, doctor; unless you
are prepared to explain how I can pass through locked doors,
abduct prisoners, and generally walk about freely about your
house. When you have explained all that, I should like to know
why, with the possession of such occult powers, I am sitting
here, a prisoner, when I have only to walk, to freedom?"</p>

<p>"You left my house last night and returned voluntarily,"
warned the doctor. "You refused to explain to me the manner in
which you accomplished that feat."</p>

<p>"I returned because of the threats you held out against Miss
Blayde," countered the journalist quickly.</p>

<p>"Threats which I carried into execution."</p>

<p>"Yet you now tell me Miss Blayde has escaped&mdash;and accuse
me of having been the means of her escape. Have you forgotten
you unlocked that door to enter this room?"</p>

<p>"I shall obtain possession of the person of that girl again,"
Dr. Night said with perfect assurance.</p>

<p>Hardy did not choose to reply. He for the next few hours held
his life in his hands. Only a short time, and Frost would be at
the house, with a force strong enough to overawe and capture the
crowd of Oriental criminals occupying "Forest Home."</p>

<p>"You left my house and returned to it again," repeated Dr.
Night. "You cannot answer the charge. I believe my slave has
spoken the truth."</p>

<p>"I wonder what would happen to him if you choose to believe
that he had lied to you?" asked Hardy, nonchalantly. A slight
smile passed over the grey face of the mystery man. A cruel look
came in his eyes and his lips drew back, exposing teeth that
looked like fangs.</p>

<p>"He would be better dead."</p>

<p>The words came in a sibilant hiss that bore a menace almost
indescribable in its ferocity.</p>

<p>"So you have asked me to prove that man a liar so that you
may have the privilege of torturing him?" Hardy spoke angrily.
"Well, I am going to do nothing of the kind. I shall refuse to
answer any further questions."</p>

<p>"To pass from this room and to enter the girl's room you must
be in possession of a key," suggested Dr. Night speculatively.
"Where is it?"</p>

<p>Hardy closed his lips firmly.</p>

<p>"The keys that my servant possessed were found in the lock of
the door of the room from which the girl escaped. Yet the door
of your room was locked. Therefore you must be in possession of
a key that will lock the door of this room."</p>

<p>Dr. Night stood for some moments waiting for the journalist
to reply to the indirect accusation he had brought against
him.</p>

<p>Hardy shrugged his shoulders, looking over the master-criminal's
head.</p>

<p>"I must have you searched."</p>

<p>The words fell slowly and distinctly from Dr. Night's lips.
He was looking directly at Hardy, and at the words the
journalist flinched.</p>

<p>To be handled by these uncouth strangers, alien in race and
thought, was a degradation, yet he bragged himself to suffer it.
Even though Doris was safe under police protection in her own
home, it would wreck Inspector Frost's schemes to reveal to this
gangster the means he had employed, to outwit him and his
servants.</p>

<p>At a sign from the doctor the Chinese seized Hardy, and
subjected him to a thorough, though not scientific searching.
The small bunch of keys he had in his pocket at the time of his
capture and had been allowed to retain were tossed on the table,
but not a key would fit the lock of the door of that room.</p>

<p>Dr. Night then gave orders for the suite to be thoroughly
searched. Hardy watched them with a quiet smile curling his
lips. The master-key lay on the roof of the verandah, close
against the wall of the house. With the bars on the window it
was impossible for it to be seen.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="first">"MY servant has lied." The doctor spoke when
the men had completed their task. "That is if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If what, my worthy host?" laughed Hardy, almost reckless
with relief.</p>

<p>"If&mdash;you are not an exceedingly clever man," completed
the master-criminal. The journalist bowed his
acknowledgements.</p>

<p>"Perhaps your servant has a partiality for your whisky,
doctor," he retorted, with a light laugh. "I confess I favour
it. May I suggest a refresher, after the strenuous events we
have lately passed through. I have a fresh syphon here."</p>

<p>"I thank you. I have no time at present." Dr. Night had
returned his old suave manner. He spoke rapidly in Chinese to
his servants. "When I have dealt with this man according to his
deserts, I shall be honoured to partake of your
hospitality."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with him?" asked Hardy sharply.</p>

<p>"He is mine, body and soul." Dr. Night spoke grimly. "He will
never lie to me&mdash;or you&mdash;again."</p>

<p>"Stop!"</p>

<p>Dr. Night turned slowly to face the journalist, his hand on
the door-knob.</p>

<p>"You mean to torture that man?"</p>

<p>"He is my slave."</p>

<p>"There are no slaves in this country."</p>

<p>"Your laws do not apply to me. I have had occasion to remind
you of that before, Mr. Hardy. This house is Chinese
territory."</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell me that you have the territorial
immunity of an ambassador?" Hardy laughed, ironically. "You, a
criminal the police are hunting and will capture within a very
short time. Look here, Dr. Night, if that is your name. I am not
going to stand idly by and see that man done to death."</p>

<p>"What can you do?"</p>

<p>"I can stop you leaving this room." As he spoke the
journalist sprang suddenly to the door, thrusting the Asian to
one side. Then, with his back to the door he glared around the
room evidently awaiting and expecting attack.</p>

<p>Dr. Night had reeled back from the sudden attack by the
journalist. For a few moments he remained with his eyes
downcast. Then, instead of ordering his slaves to attack the
journalist, he slowly raised his eyes and fixed them on some
point about a foot above the journalist's head.</p>

<p>"Look here, Doctor." Hardy had cooled somewhat, repenting of
the impulse that had driven him forward a direct attack on the
master-criminal. "Let the man go. You haven't any evidence, one
way or the other. Just because you can't get me to speak, you
jump at conclusions. Conclusions are not evidence. No one
convicts on them. If you like, I'll say that I was responsible
for Miss Blayde's escape."</p>

<p>Dr. Night did not reply. He continued to stare at the point
over Hardy's head. The silence was irritating. The journalist
wanted to turn and discover what the Dr. was staring at.</p>

<p>"You needn't try to hypnotise me," laughed Hardy somewhat
nervously. "I've had others try to do it, and not one of them
can. Now&mdash;I'm talking to a reasonable man. Don't act
hastily. Take time to think. I've told you the man is innocent,
so you can't torture him. Come, now! Be a good fellow. Let the
poor devil go. Come and sit down and act like the sport you are.
Have a glass of your own whisky. It's bonzer stuff, I tell you.
I can do with one myself."</p>

<p>Still the Asian stood silent, his eyes fixed on the spot over
the journalist's head. But now small twinkling pointy of light
flecked the pupils of his eyes. The lights danced and whirled in
mad phantasy, growing larger and larger until the whole of both
eyeballs seemed to be masses of moving, seething flames.</p>

<p>Hardy wrenched his eyes from the spectacle. He had felt his
senses waver under the influence of the dancing lights.</p>

<p>"Of course, you can order those chaps to put me from the
door, and I don't doubt but that they'll have a go for it."</p>

<p>Hardy was now talking to relieve the strain on his nerves.
"Still, they'd be in for a dinkum fight. I'm no chicken and I
guess I can give them a good go. They're a hefty crowd but they
don't look as if they are much of boxers, and I'm certain I'd
make a mess of that chap's nose first hit. Couldn't miss it if I
tried and I shan't try. What do you say? Box on, or whisky? I
vote for the whisky, eh?"</p>

<p>The word "to-morrow" appeared to be drumming itself in Hardy's
brain. He was trying to think of fresh arguments to use, but the
irritating word persisted. Whenever he got hold of a new idea
the word "to-morrow" came and hunted it away.</p>

<p>Then to his utter amazement he found himself walking across
the room to his seat at the window. The Doctor had not
hypnotised him. He was certain of that, but there was a force
driving him that he could not withstand. He could think clearly.
He was not acting under the Doctor's will. He had just walked
across the Doctor's room under impulse. Chaps did that sort of
thing, sometimes, y'know.</p>

<p>He glanced across his shoulder at Dr. Night. He was still
standing, facing the door, in the same pose, his eyes still
fixed on the point Hardy had wanted to examine. The three
Chinese still stood in the centre of the room, the centre one
kneeling on the floor.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow!"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow!"</p>

<p>The words had not been spoken by anyone in the room, yet they
seemed to echo through space, obliterating all other sounds.</p>

<p>"Did you say 'to-morrow'?" asked Hardy, sinking into his chair
by the window. "I'm willing if you promise not to do anything to
that chap until after then. Yes? All right! It's a bargain."</p>

<p>Slowly Hardy became conscious of a presence in the room, it
was something intangible, unseen, yet it seemed to grow, filling
the room. The air became oppressive and hot, his throat parched,
then became contracted, as if under the pressure of some
supernatural power. He could only sit back in his chair, his
eyes fastened, watchfully on the slight form that dominated the
room.</p>

<p>Almost when Hardy thought he must shriek, Dr. Night raised
his hand and pointed to the door. The Chinese moved slowly
forward and, as they advanced the door seemed to recede before
them.</p>

<p>No. It did not open. Hardy was prepare to swear to that. The
door did not swing on its hinges. He was certain that it went
back squarely and bodily, leaving a space of the corridor
visible and&mdash;on to that space stepped the two hefty Chinese
and the prisoner. They walked towards the head of the stairs and
passed behind the solid wall. Hardy heard their footsteps
growing fainter as they passed into the distance.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="first">FOR the interval there was silence in the
house&mdash;a silence that was more oppressive than the drumming
that had been paramount in his head when he faced the Doctor at
the door.</p>

<p>Then, slowly and calmly, the still figure in the centre of
the room moved. With hardly visible motion he glided forward
into the corridor, against the opposite wall of which the door
of that room grotesquely stood. Then he turned, staring again
over the crest of Hardy's head.</p>

<p>Now the feeling of irritation passed from Hardy's mind; to be
succeeded by a great calm. The strange oppression in the room
faded and in its place came a cool, sweet breeze. The whirling,
dancing flames in the mystery's man's eyes, dwindled and slowed.
For a moment they stilled and on the air came the slow, precise
voice the journalist would recognise and remember all his
life.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow. Until to-morrow. Then I&mdash;then shall you
explain."</p>

<p>Suddenly, the door sprang into place, shutting from the
journalist's sight the spare, thin figure of the Asian.</p>

<p>Hardy drew a long breath, loosening his collar with his
finger. The door opened again&mdash;to admit one of the Chinese
servants who methodically set about preparing the table for the
evening meal.</p>

<p>For some time after Dr. Night had left the room Hardy sat
conning over the events of the day. He was back in his prison
room at "Forest Home" and, so far as he could gather, the
master-criminal was in ignorance of the means he had employed to
enter and leave the house. Then, he had freed Doris from the clutches
of the gang. Her disappearance from her room had been in keeping
with the mystery with which he had surrounded his own actions.
So far as he could guess he had the master-criminal and his gang
completely puzzled.</p>

<p>The threats to torture the poor devil of a Chinese were
entirely discounted by the journalist. He had persuaded Dr.
Night not to take any action against the man until the next day,
and by that time Inspector Frost and his police would be in
control of the house. Dr. Night and his gang would be behind
prison bars.</p>

<p>The journalist was frankly puzzled by the apparently
superhuman powers of the mystery man. It had been his frequent
boast that he was immune to mesmerists and other like
fraternities. Yet, without any apparatus or flummery, so far as
he could judge, Dr. Night had created around him an atmosphere
that had dulled his senses, and left him plastic in the
master-criminal's hands.</p>

<p>The evening meal had been accompanied by certain signs that
Dr. Night was taking precautions against further actions by the
journalist. The man who brought the meal to the room and served
it was attended to the door by an armed Chinese guard. The door
was left open and the table was shifted to a position where the
guard could have a full view of the journalist while he ate.
Just before the man left the room he moved the table back to its
old position. Immediately the door closed Hardy sprang across
the room and pressed the panel of the door to listen, but he
could not see whether the guard remained in the corridor, or
accompanied the serving man to the lower floor.</p>

<p>With a shrug of anger, he returned to his seat at the window.
Inaction irked the journalist. Every few minutes he looked at
his watch. He had never thought the minutes could travel so
slowly. His plans were set&mdash;and he could rely on Frost to
keep his time, to the minute. Only one factor remained to be
decided. Had Doctor Night set a watch in the corridor?</p>

<p>Hardy longed to repossess the master-key and open the door.
Yet, if he acted at once, he might betray himself and his only
means of gaining the freedom of the house would be taken from
him.</p>

<p>In any event, Inspector Frost would act. The absence of the
journalist from the box-room would not stop the raid. It would
only force the police to act with greater caution&mdash;and take
from them a knowledge of the house and its inmates. Hardy had
intended to fully inform the Inspector of the lay-out of the
house and the probable movements of the inmates, at nights, when
he was at Police Headquarters; but the sudden news of the
capture of Doris had driven all else from his thoughts.</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen. A long session with his ear at the door
had failed to reveal any movements in the corridor Hardy was
almost persuaded that Dr. Night had failed to set a watch. At
any minute now Inspector Frost and his men would be under the
shelter of the trees watching from some sign from the box-room
window&mdash;and he dared not act.</p>

<p>In one of the chests in the box-room lay the housebreaking
tools the Inspector had sent him. Hardy swore softly. If he had
been able to bring them with him to his room! If he had them he
would have an extra chance of success in the game he was
playing&mdash;but would they have survived the very careful
search of his rooms Dr. Night had supervised?</p>

<p>He could not hope to hide so material a bundle on the
verandah roof. In his pocket he had a small penknife. It was the
only tool or weapon he possessed, besides the master-key. As a
tool it was inefficient, as a weapon ineffective. For some
moments he balanced the little instrument in his hand.</p>

<p>One of the blades was long, narrow and almost round.
Carelessly he placed his left hand over the handle and rolled
the knife between his palms.</p>

<p>An idea occurred to him. Going to the door he found a place
on the panel, about breast high, that he thought would serve his
purpose. Taking the handle of the penknife between his palms he
applied the soft point of the blade to his chosen spot and spun
the knife, with but soft pressure on the point.</p>

<p>Quickly, the blade bit into the wood and a thin trickle of
sawdust fell to the floor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="first">VERY cautiously and carefully the journalist
continued to spin the knife between his palms. Bit by bit the
blade worked into the panel until suddenly it stopped, with a
slight jar, indicating that the point of the blade had
penetrated into the corridor.</p>

<p>Now he had to act with the greatest caution. He had to
enlarge the minute hole so that he could see through it, but if
he used the penknife the lights in the corridor might flash on
the polished blade, and attract the attention of any guard Dr.
Night had stationed there. A quick search of his pockets brought
to light only a pencil, a few coins and some papers. He looked
at the collection ruefully. He could see no hope there.</p>

<p>He looked around the room. Nothing in sight promised
assistance. Tentatively he placed the pencil in the hole. It was too
big. A few seconds work with his penknife made the pencil fit in
the hole somewhat loosely. A little pressure, and he turned it.
There came a slight grating sound, and the pencil moved forward
a fraction of an inch. Withdrawing the pencil he applied his eye
to the hole. He could see through. Opposite his door and seated
on a chair was one of the Chinese servants. He was looking down
the corridor towards the head of the stairs. After a moment he
turned his eyes and stared straight at the door of Hardy's
room.</p>

<p>The journalist feared that he would notice the small hole on
the edge of the panel, but the man made no sign. With the
Asiatic seated opposite his room door and on guard, it was
impossible for the journalist to use the master-key. Long before
the door could be opened and Hardy able to attack, the man would
have raised the alarm&mdash;and have obtained assistance. In
some manner the man must be removed. Almost despairingly, Hardy
looked round the room again. A gust of wind came in at the
half-opened window and swung the shaded electric light.</p>

<p>Hardy stood looking at it with a puzzled expression on his
face. Suddenly, he turned and walked into his bedroom. On the
bedside table lay a pocket torch. Placing it in his pocket he
returned to the sitting-room. There he retrieved the master-key
and fitted it silently into the lock. Again in his bedroom,
Hardy switched off the electric light and then removed the globe
from the socket.</p>

<p>Placing a three penny-piece across the contacts, he fitted
the globe into the sockets again. At the switch, he pressed
sharply. In the globe came a sudden light, accompanied by a
cracking noise and then darkness. The dim light in the room,
from the sitting-room globe, suddenly failed! Hardy raced
through the rooms to his spy hole. The corridor was in darkness,
and he could hear the Asiatic pattering to the head of the
stairs, calling to his comrades in shrill tones.</p>

<p>The master-key turned silently. Plucking it from the lock,
Hardy shut the door and locked it. Then, as silently as he could
move, quickly he raced down the corridor to the box room. A
moment, and he had the door shut behind him. So far he had
succeeded.</p>

<p>Throwing a beam of light around the room the journalist
located the light switch. A globe hung in the middle of the
room. Pressing down the switch. Hardy waited for the house fuse
to be mended. Now he had only one danger, and that he had no
power to guard against. Should Dr. Night, with the fresh scare
of the failing lights, take it into his head to search Hardy's
prison rooms, then his escape would be discovered,
immediately&mdash;and he greatly desired that the household
should remain unalarmed until Frost was ready to act.</p>

<p>Crossing to the window, Hardy flashed his torch, then flung
up the sash. An answering glimmer came from under the belt of
trees.</p>

<p>Taking the knotted rope from its hiding place, he tied it
firmly to the handle of a large trunk standing under the window,
then throwing the rope over the verandah roof-edge. Then he
seated himself on the trunk&mdash;and waited.</p>

<p>Suddenly the globe in the centre of the room came to life;
the household had mended the broken fuse. The journalist jumped
to the light-switch and plunged the room into darkness. As he
regained the trunk and again seated himself, one end rose from
the floor, as if bucking. Hardy flung all his weight on the
trunk.</p>

<p>A few moments later, and a dark form filled the window.</p>

<p>"Bob?" It was the voice of Inspector frost.</p>

<p>"Here. Get on this trunk. You Johns are too well fed for my
weight," answered the journalist. "How many are you?"</p>

<p>"Three." Almost as the journalist spoke another man slid
gently into the room; to be followed by a third.</p>

<p>"Why the darkness, Bob?"</p>

<p>"I broke the safety fuse," answered Hardy. "There was a Chink
seated in the corridor, facing my room. We can have a light now
you're here." Feeling his way across the room Hardy switched on
the light. Then he went to his cache of tools. As he expected, a
small boring tool was in the kit. Taking this, the journalist
went to the door, and commenced to bore a hole in one of the
panels.</p>

<p>"What's the idea, Bob?" the Inspector asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I want to know if that Chink is still in the corridor,"
replied Hardy, working strenuously. "The only thing that I am
afraid of is that Dr. Night has taken it into his head to search
my room."</p>

<p>A minute later, and the tool bit through the wood. Through
the hole Hardy looked down the corridor. The Asiatic was seated
in his old place, facing Hardy's late prison door.</p>

<p>"All serene," exclaimed the journalist, turning to his
companions. "They appear to have reckoned the light failure was
an accident. But we've got to get rid of that fellow. He'll
raise the house if we walk out of here on to him."</p>

<p>"Why not?" The light of battle lit in the dark eyes of the
Inspector. "Let 'em have first shot, and then we can take a hand
in the game. I'd love to have a pot at some of those chaps."</p>

<p>Hardy shook his head. He thought for a moment, then turned to
his cache of tools. "Seat yourselves, gentlemen," he said
laughingly. "Before we adopt our bloodthirsty friend's
suggestion, I have a little demonstration to make." The three
men looked curious when he brought from his cache a pianola
roll.</p>

<p>"Had any luck in tracing out how the gang gets the 'snow'
into the country, Frost?" he asked, when he had arranged matters
to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You heard what Matthews split," replied the Inspector. "I've
been working on that. Seems we've woke up a hornets' nest, Bob.
This Dr. Night and his gang appears to have been
everywhere."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"If I said everything I should not be far off the mark. And
it isn't cocaine, alone, by any means."</p>

<p>"Get on with it, Frost. You cackle like an old hen."</p>

<p>"If I do, the brood's coming home to roost." The detective
smiled grimly. "I've followed up the clues Bill Matthews gave me
last night, and at an interview I had with him this morning, and
the lines led to some unexpected quarters."</p>

<p>"How's Matthews?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="first">"AS chirpy as a wagtail. Appears to enjoy Long
Bay so much that we won't be able to shift him, ever. The one
thing I can't get out of him is how the bulk of the stuff gets
into the country. Most of the ways he appears to know can only
be sidelines. No chance of large importations through those
channels."</p>

<p>"Any line on a music shop, in your investigations?" asked the
journalist, after a moment's thought.</p>

<p>"What the devil!" The Inspector stared at the journalist in
sheer amazement. "I thought you had been locked up in this den
of thieves, all day. Why, I only got on to that this
morning."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Matthews told me that Captain Kettle had an interest in a
music agency&mdash;a wholesale place. So far as I could see the
business is too large for any crook work. Why, they have the
sole agency for one of the most popular makes of German
pianolas."</p>

<p>Hardy lifted the pianola roll he had taken from his cache. "I
found that in Dr. Night's study, you tell me why he wants a huge
number of pianola, rolls when there's not a sound of music in
the house from one week's end to the other? And, Frost, they're
German."</p>

<p>The Inspector opened the box and took out the roll. He
examined it carefully, even unwinding the paper for some
distance. Finally, he rewound the roll and handed it to
Hardy.</p>

<p>"I'll buy it, Bob," he said, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>The journalist opened the record until he had only the bare
wooden roller in his hand. For a few minutes he tried to remove
the knobs from the ends. Failing in this he took a small saw
from the kit of tools and commenced to saw the roller in half.
In a few moments he realised that the roller was a hollow
cylinder.</p>

<p>He caught the half-sawn roller in his hands and wrenched it
apart. From the interior streamed out a large quantity of white
powder.</p>

<p>The Inspector picked up a pinch of the stuff and sniffed at
it.</p>

<p>"You've solved the problem, Bob! Congrats! This is
cocaine."</p>

<p>Frost picked up the roller and examined it. "I'd like to know
how they work this knob."</p>

<p>"Plenty of time to experiment when our work's finished,"
laughed the journalist. "There's hundreds of rollers like these,
downstairs."</p>

<p>"I understand a lot now," mused the Inspector. "When Matthews
spoke of Captain Kettle's interest in the music shop, I made
some inquiries. Didn't get a line on him, direct, but ran up
against a lot of suspicion that pointed towards a certain music
warehouse. That firm's importing a huge number of pianola rolls
and seems to be able to sell at a price that has created a
practical monopoly. Couldn't understand it until now."</p>

<p>"That mystery's solved," laughed the journalist. "Now we have
to find out how they got rid of the huge quantity them
imported."</p>

<p>"Breeding drug fiends," answered the journalist shortly.
"Man, Australia's full of the trade. The awful modern craving
for excitement, and then more excitement, is just the ground
these fiends want to prey on. People are trying to burn the
candle at both ends. They demand excitement for twenty out of
twenty-four hours of the day. To keep up the strain they
frequent the chemists' shops for pick-me-ups. Later, they meet
some 'friend' who states he or she has 'just the thing you
want.' That's the end; and the beginning of the tale of hundreds
of cases. They get used to the beastly stuff and hand it round
to their friends and neighbours. Take a typical case. A man has
a series of late nights. He goes down to his office in the
condition best described as a 'wet rag.' More than probable,
there's a drug addict on the premises. 'Take a bit of this, old
man. It'll pull you together.' It does. Another series of
jamborees, and the man applies for more of the stuff. Later, he
asks where he can buy it for himself. Dr. Night and his
confederates have made another customer and another victim.
Almost every issue of a newspaper in Australia contains news of
some tragedy attributable, directly or indirectly, to this
horrible trade. And it's growing man, growing like a pestilent
weed."</p>

<p>"We'll put a stop to it, now," growled the Inspector, and a
heavy murmur of assent from his followers.</p>

<p>"With a consequent long list of suicides for the coroner to
handle," added the journalist thoughtfully. "The poor devils
cannot exist it their supplies are cut off."</p>

<p>"You don't suggest the Police Department should peddle the
stuff to them?" Frost asked the question in blank amazement.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to suggest." Hardy moved restlessly around
the room. "One thing, the stuff must not be destroyed. After
to-night, the hospitals will need huge supplies of the
cocaine."</p>

<p>"I don't follow you, Bob." The police Inspector drummed with
his fingers on the box he was seated upon.</p>

<p>"Look at the facts, man. It is evident from what we know of
the Captain Kettle episodes that nearly every chemist in
Australia is getting his supplies from Dr. Night. Every
snow-runner gets his goods through this loophole in the country's
customs defence. The legitimate agents and makers are
circumscribed to a limit that renders their stocks small and
ineligible for medical purposes; much less as a source of
supplies for addicts, when we smash up this house of sin. Dr.
Night is the Snow King of Australia."</p>

<p>"Was," stated the Inspector emphatically. "After to-night,
Dr. Night's a has-been."</p>

<p>Hardy paced the narrow room thoughtfully for some minutes.
Then he returned to his seat beside the Inspector.</p>

<p>"I doubt if, even now, Frost, you realise the extent of this
affair," he said. "There is something more than smuggling in
this affair of Dr. Night."</p>

<p>"Look at the profits," urged the Inspector.</p>

<p>"They must be enormous," agreed the journalist. "But there
are other lines of thought we should not neglect. I have been
in contact with Dr. Night for some time. He does not appear to
me to be a man who would enter this trade solely for the
profits. You were in the War, Frost?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You know something of the enormous losses in lives and
treasure, occasioned by the avarice of a few men?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a socialist," argued the Inspector. "It's good
enough for me that Germany started the row and got a father of a
good hiding."</p>

<p>"I worry about facts, not titles," answered Hardy. "You can
call me a socialist if you like. Most writers are. But you can't
conceal from yourself, whether you'd admit it or not, that greed
of money, greed of power, and greed of revenge, are the three
factors that set the world aflame."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"The Great War was fought with shot, bayonet and gas. What if
some ambitious person, inflamed by one of the 'greeds' started
to conquer humanity&mdash;what we call civilisation&mdash;by
more more subtle means."</p>

<p>For a moment the detective stared at his companion, horror
dawning in his eyes. For a long moment he waited, then:</p>

<p>"You mean a war of&mdash;of drugs?"</p>

<p>"It is possible." Suddenly Hardy sprang to his feet. "Come on
Frost. Zero's struck. We've got work to do&mdash;not theories to
argue."</p>

<p>Hardy went to the door and bent down to peer through the
little spy hole. As he had expected, the Asiatic was again
seated on the chair, facing the door of his late prison. The
situation was awkward. So long as the man remained in that seat,
and awake, it was Impossible for the raiding party to leave the
box-room.</p>

<p>Outside the house were a large number of men, awaiting the
opening of some door to pour into the house and overwhelm the
inmates.</p>

<p>When the journalist straightened himself, the Inspector took
his place at the spy hole, and carefully examined the corridor.
It was a nasty problem. The man was a good sixty or seventy feet
from the door of the box-room; far too distant for any chance
for a rush attack.</p>

<p>Frost swore softly under his breath as he turned to face the
journalist.</p>

<p>"Will the beggar ever sleep?" he asked in a low whisper.
"Looks as if we shall have to wait until he dozes off, or else
charge out and gain the head of the stairs before he can be
rescued by his friends below."</p>

<p>"Dr. Night's servants don't sleep," replied Hardy, his lips
twisted to a grim smile.</p>

<p>The Inspector had not witnessed the abject terror of the man
he had fought and tied for Doris' freedom.</p>

<p>"Then it's a charge, boys." Frost turned to his men. "I'm
afraid there's going to be a considerable amount of bloodshed in
this affair. Remember, we've got to give them the first shot.
The law only allows us to defend our selves. Of course you can
make it as slippery as you please. Seconds count with bullets,
and who's to swear you fired a fifth of a second before the
other fellow. S'long as his pistol contains a fired cartridge,
there's not going to be any outcry. And remember, we're all one
in this work. If any blighter shoots at Bill, and Tom gets him
before he gets Bill, that counts one to Tom, and no questions
asked. Get me?"</p>

<p>The Inspector had his hand on the master-key when Hardy
stopped him. The Inspector looked round impatiently.</p>

<p>"Walt a moment, Frost," exclaimed, the journalist, in a low
tone. "Remember the trick I played on that chap to get here.
Well, it's worth trying again. Can only alarm the fellows
downstairs, at the most. They won't understand it. And even if
they guess some trick is being played on them, they will have to
guess quite a lot to find out how it is being worked."</p>

<p>The Inspector looked dubious. He had keyed himself for some
nasty work and wanted to get it over as soon as possible. Frost
was slightly dogmatic. He hated to change his plans. In this
case he had decided that trickery was out of the question and
the journalist's hesitation irritated. He was about to speak
sharply, and go on with his plan, when Hardy took the master-key
out of his hand and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"No good getting your paddy up, Frost," Hardy laughed at the
expression on the detective's face. "It's fifty-fifty in this
game and I want my share. At the worst, I can't block your plans
for direct action, and I might manage to get through without
causing a riot on this floor."</p>

<p>"Whose rooms are those along the corridor?" asked the
Inspector, gruffly.</p>

<p>"Vacant, I think." Hardy put his hand in his pocket. "By
Jove! I left all my silver on the table in my room. Got a
tray- bit. Frost?"</p>

<p>"Yep" The Inspector handed over the coin. "What's the joke,
Bob?"</p>

<p>Hardy threw the room into darkness and then lit his torch.
Handing it to one of the men to hold, and bidding him focus the
light on the electric bulb he unscrewed the globe from its and
balanced the coin over the contacts.</p>

<p>The men watched him he replaced the globe in the holder.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="first">"READY, Frost? Now listen, I'm going to unlock
the door. Then I shall press the switch; that will fuse the
light in the house. While it is dark I shall creep down to the
chair where the man is seated. I think he will act as he did
previously, and go to the top of the stairs. If he does I shall
await his return; then I shall collar him. With luck I may be
able to prevent him yelling out and alarming the household. At
any rate we shall await his return; then I shall think about
downstairs, and by the time they realise there is an alarm on
this floor we shall be streaming down the stairs."</p>

<p>Interested, in spite of himself, the Inspector nodded a
reluctant assent. Hardy unlocked the door and held it slightly
ajar. One of the men pressed the switch and immediately the
lights in the corridor went out.</p>

<p>Hardy slipped silently through the door and made his way to
where the man had been seated. As he had expected, the man had
retreated to the head of the stairs. The journalist could hear
him there, talking excitedly to his friends below. Minutes
passed, the journalist crouching beside the empty chair. The
wait seemed almost interminable, and unbearable. Then, just as
Hardy felt that he could stand the darkness and waiting no
longer, the lights came to light again.</p>

<p>Now was the crucial time. The man would face in Hardy's
direction when he returned to his watchman's chair. Hardy was
only concealed by the slight outline of the chair, standing
almost directly under one of the large bucket lights. The man
could not help but see him. Everything depended on whether he
was close enough for a successful attack, and whether he thought
himself strong enough to recapture the journalist without
help.</p>

<p>The Asiatic turned from the head of the stairs on the
resurrection of the lights. He came padding down the corridor,
leisurely, his eyes fixed on the ground. A few steps before the
chair, he raised, his eyes and looked straight at the
journalist. Hardy remained quiet.</p>

<p>The man stopped and half-opened his mouth. Then, a cruel
smile spread over his yellow countenance and he advanced,
half-crouching. The journalist met the beast-like spring half-way,
and the two men fell to the ground grappling. The journalist had
found an early grip on the throat of his opponent and clung for
a few minutes and Frost would come to his assistance.</p>

<p>Grimly he held on his head whirling from the continuous
shower of blows rained by his antagonist. The lights were
dancing before his eyes and his head throbbed terribly. He had
buried his face on the breast of the Asian, and the queer
overpowering smell of the Easterner's body made him feel faint.
Frost was a long time coming.</p>

<p>His fingers bit deep into the man's throat and his ears
sensed the labouring lungs. The blows on his head became less
frequent and to come from only one side. Then he felt a hand
slipped between his face and the man's chest. The hand crept
higher, in spite of the pressure he was applying against it. The
fingers curved round to his face and he could feel the long-nailed
tips searching for his eyes; He shifted quickly, but the
groping fingers followed. The man was staggering&mdash;dying on
his feet, but still those groping fingers continued their search
for his eyes.</p>

<p>Hardy felt he would have to let go. He could not hold out
many seconds longer. Why did Frost not come to his assistance?
What had happened to hamper the completion of the plan? Suddenly
the man shivered and collapsed on to him. Hardy tried to release
his fingers but the muscles did not relax. Someone caught at his
wrists and forced his hands from the man's throat.</p>

<p>"Steady, Bob." It was the Inspector's voice. "Let up, or
you'll choke the yellow beggar."</p>

<p>Hardy opened his eyes and looked around. Frost was kneeling
beside him holding his wrists. A few feet away the Asiatic lay
on the floor, the two detectives busily engaged in binding and
gagging him.</p>

<p>"Any alarm?" asked Hardy weakly.</p>

<p>"Not a sound from below," assured the Inspector. "Your attack
was so sudden and with both of you in bare feet, you hardly made
a sound. Looks as if you'd got away with it again, Bob."</p>

<p>"I'm all right now." Hardy rose to his feet and shook himself
carefully.</p>

<p>"What next, Frost? It's your show, now."</p>

<p>For answer, the Inspector led the way to the stairs, followed
by Hardy and the detectives. The Chinese was left in the
corridor, helpless. They could collect him when the round-up was
completed. At the head of the stairs the Inspector paused and
looked over the banisters. The hall was brilliantly lit but no
one was in sight.</p>

<p>Frost descended the stairs, followed by his small party of
raiders. Arriving at the front door he paused and in a whisper
bade the others await his return. Then he opened the door and
walked out into the night. A minute later the detective
returned, followed by half-a-dozen plain-clothes constables. The
door carefully closed, the Inspector started to make his
preparations for the cleanup of the household.</p>

<p>Four men were detailed to follow the Inspector and Hardy on
their investigations of the rooms. The others were stationed
about the hall, on guard, and to protect the investigators from
surprise. Frost walked to a door and, with his hand on the knob,
turned to the journalist.</p>

<p>"What's here?"</p>

<p>"Front part of the house occupied by Westerton and his
servants," replied Hardy promptly. "They're a blind. The real
gang lives somewhere at the back of the house."</p>

<p>"Good. We'll clean them up and sort them out afterwards."</p>

<p>The third room visited proved to be a bedroom. Westerton was
found deep in blissful sleep. The muzzle of an automatic thrust
in his midriff despite Hardy's laughings of heart disease,
effectually aroused him.</p>

<p>"Raise an alarm and I'll shoot," warned Frost, grimly. "Now
you lazy, good-for-nothing invalid where's your household?"</p>

<p>"Next room."</p>

<p>"Oh! How many?"</p>

<p>"Four girls."</p>

<p>"That's all?"</p>

<p>"Yep. They're only for show. The Chinks do all the work."</p>

<p>"Where do the Chinese camp?"</p>

<p>"Next to the kitchen," Westerton replied, and found the
barrel of the automatic thrust between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Out on your left," commanded Frost. "I'm just aching to
shoot; so just be careful."</p>

<p>The Inspector jerked the fat man off the bed on to his feet.
As the German looked round the room he caught sight of the
journalist standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Ach! You? I told him you were better dead."</p>

<p>"Told whom," asked Frost.</p>

<p>The man would not answer.</p>

<p>"Where's Dr. Night?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>The man remained silent.</p>

<p>"Where's Captain Kettle?" continued Frost.</p>

<p>"In prison, in New Zealand," snarled Westerton. "I don't mind
telling you that."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Any more information to offer?" The man turned
sullenly towards the door.</p>

<p>"Well, as you don't feel conversational, I'll see that you
don't talk at all."</p>

<p>Before the man could move, Frost had seized him from behind
and forced a gag in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Now for your maids."</p>

<p>The girls were aroused without any alarm and still in their
night attire, but swathed in blankets, ushered into Westerton's
room. Frost wished to gag the girls but Hardy intervened and
persuaded him that, with the detectives on guard, they would not
be so foolish as to call out and receive retributive
punishment.</p>

<p>"Keep quiet and you'll get just what's coming to you," was
Frost's final and cryptic parting advice. "Start any nonsense
and it's your funeral. There's a hundred men in and around this
house. Take your choice."</p>

<p>Detailing a couple of men to guard the prisoners, Frost led
the way froth e room to continue the search the house. Room
after room was systematically searched, without the arrest of
any more suspects.</p>

<p>It looked as if Westerton had told the truth, when he said
that his household consisted of only four maids.</p>

<p>"Looks fishy," whispered Frost to the journalist, as they
stood before a door at the rear of the house. "Where the devil
are Humbertson, Night and Kettle? Can't make it out at all. They
don't sleep with the stinking Chinks, do they?"</p>

<p>Hardy smiled, but answered nothing. He was beginning to form
a theory of the whereabouts of the master-criminal and his
associates. He had not forgotten the incident of the sliding
panel in the master-criminal's study.</p>

<p>"Where's this lead to?" asked Frost abruptly.</p>

<p>"Dr. Night's study," answered the journalist in a low tone.
"Now there's likely to be trouble."</p>

<p>"Dr. Night's study," muttered Frost softly. "Humph."</p>

<p>A quick turn of the wrist, and he flung open the door and
strode into the room. Hardy followed close on the heels of
detective, and the men crowded the doorway.</p>

<p>The room was unoccupied. A shaded light stood on the desk
before the window. In the fireplace a large radiator threw a
warm glow over the surroundings, bringing into relief a small
table holding a couple of decanters and some glasses. The little
circle looked as if it had only recently been vacated. Frost
strode across the room and lifted both glasses to his nose, one
after the other.</p>

<p>"Seems they did hear us, Bob," he whispered. "They heard us
and got for their lives. Funny we haven't heard any thing from
outside. They can't get away. I'll swear to that."</p>

<p>The journalist shook his head in the negative. Whatever the
heads of the gang were, they were not cowards. Humberston, a
gunman by training and instinct, would certainly fight. Captain
Kettle was an unknown problem, and while the arch-criminal, Dr.
Night, was not built for a fighting man, Hardy could not but
think that he would go to any lengths to prevent capture and
the downfall of his complicated plans.</p>

<p>Frost stood looking around the room with a puzzled expression
on his face. Then, apparently, having made up his mind, he
strode resolutely towards the door.</p>

<p>"Come along," he said quietly. "The birds have apparently
flown. We'll have time to loot this place when we've rounded up
the servants."</p>

<p>The Chinese servants of Dr. Night were found in their
quarters peacefully asleep. The police skilfully rounded them
up, and marched them to the room where Westerton and his maids
were prisoners. Then, strengthening the guard over the
prisoners, Frost led the way back to Dr. Night's study.</p>

<p>At the door of the study Frost found the plain-clothes man he
had posted on guard. In the reply to the query in the
Inspector's eyes, the man shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not a sound, sir," he whispered hoarsely. "I don't think
they're back."</p>

<p>Without replying, Frost opened the door and strode into the
room. For a moment the detective was undecided what action to
take. Hardy watched him for some moments.</p>

<p>"Up against it, Frost?" The journalist grinned wickedly at
the Inspector's predicament. "Let me take a hand in the matter.
It may be that I know more of the secrets of this house than
you."</p>

<p>"If you can get to the root of this business, get to it,"
retorted Frost crossly. "I can't believe that these scoundrels
levanted without putting up something resembling a fight. But
where the devil have they got to. I'd be prepared to swear
they're not in this house."</p>

<p>"They're not far away, if I guess right," laughed the
journalist. "There's a secret door opening into this room. Where
it leads to, I don't know. I saw Humberston use it one night.
We'll have a try for it later, but first I want you to have a
look at these pianola rolls."</p>

<p>But the spirit of the man-hunter was dominant in the breast
of the Inspector. He gave but a cursory glance at the hundreds
of pianola rolls, scattered about the room. For the moment he
hardly seemed to realise that under his hand lay thousands of
pounds worth of cocaine&mdash;that here lay the secret of the
huge importations of illicit drugs the department had failed for
months to discover.</p>

<p>The desk appeared to attract his attention. He strode over to
it and tried the drawers.</p>

<p>"I'd like to smash that thing up at once," he growled. "We
might find a clue or two there, but to break it open would
occupy too much time and make too much noise, and I want those
men first. You say you know of a secret door, Bob. Where is
it?"</p>

<p>Hardy crossed the room to the fireplace and ran his fingers
along the moulding. One of the bosses appeared to give slightly
under his fingers. A tentative pressure, and he had found the
secret. The panel slid aside silently.</p>

<p>"Crikes!" exclaimed the Inspector; "Where does it lead to,
Bob?"</p>

<p>"That is more than I can say," Hardy peered into the cavity
over the Inspector's shoulder. "I told you, the night I explored
the house I hid in this room and watched Humberston and Dr.
Night enter and leave the room by this door. It appears to lead
down below the house."</p>

<p>"We'll soon see. I'll lead here. Can't afford to have you
shot up."</p>

<p>One of the police officer's rare smiles lit his face as he
glanced back over his shoulder at the journalist. He stepped
forward to enter the door. Hardy suddenly caught him by the
shoulder and pulled him back. At the same time be touched the
spring controlling the door, and the panel slipped back into
place.</p>

<p>"What's up?" exclaimed Frost angrily. "Open that door, again,
Bob."</p>

<p>"Hush!" The journalist's hand closed on the Inspector's lips.
"There's someone coming up from below."</p>

<p>"Well, I was going to fetch him."</p>

<p>"The strategy of war is to divide the enemy's forces and
destroy them in detail." Hardy muttered the platitude without a
smile. "Get behind that screen, Frost. Hide yourselves, men.
We'll take this fellow in a trap."</p>

<p>Switching off the lights, except the shaded lamp on the desk,
Hardy watched the Inspector and his men take cover. Then he
flattened himself against the wall, beside the secret panel.
The seconds that passed appeared as minutes, and the journalist
began to think that his ears had deceived him. Then, just as he
was about to move, a slight click sounded beside his ear and the
panel slid aside. A man's form passed into the room and made for
the desk. Hardy stretched out his hand and touched the boss
controlling the panel. At the click of the shutting door the man
swung round, with an exclamation. Then he strode to the switches
and flooded the room with light.</p>

<p>"By heck! Who switched out the lights."</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Humberston," said the journalist
quietly.</p>

<p>The man's hand swung to his hip as he turned on his heel.</p>

<p>"The writer feller, by jingo! Why didn't the doctor put you
to sleep for good? I wanted him to."</p>

<p>"That seems to be a common idea of my welfare, Mr.
Humberston," laughed the journalist. "I have heard that wish
expressed before, this evening. It appears that I am not to be
consulted in the matter."</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"A little exploration." Hardy laughed again. "In fact, I am
interested in pianola rolls; Do you know anything about
them?"</p>

<p>"So you know that?" A look of murderous hate came in the
gunman's eyes. His voice fell to a sibilant hiss, and his hand
again crept towards his hip-pocket. "You know too much, my
Australian friend."</p>

<p>"Cut it out," exclaimed the journalist sharply. "You're
covered."</p>

<p>"Am I? Well, I'll take a chance."</p>

<p>The man's hand moved so rapidly that Hardy could hardly
follow it. He sprang aside and tripped. A stream of bullets
poured from the automatic in the gunman's hand and peppered the
wall against which the journalist had been standing.</p>

<p>Then, following the sudden silence from the gunman's pistol,
came one solitary shot. A look of intense surprise came on the
man's face. With an effort he turned slowly and faced the screen
beside which the Inspector was now standing, a revolver in his
hand. For a full minute the gunman looked at the police officer,
his features braced for effort. Slowly his hand and arm tensed,
and the muzzle of his pistol came up. The Inspector raised his
arm again. Then, with a sigh, the man pitched forward on his
face.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="first">"LUCK!" exclaimed the detective, striding
forward and bending over the fallen man. "I didn't want to have
to fire again, but it looked as if I should have to. Say, boy,
you'll never escape like that a second time. I've never seen a
man so quick on the draw. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Humberston, the man the note found on Smithson was addressed
to," replied Hardy shortly. He was just beginning to realise the
narrowness of his escape.</p>

<p>"So!" Frost stooped and rolled the man on to his back. He
peered down on the white face. "Humberston, you say? Well, he's
better known as Carl Petersen, the manager of the Petersen
Pianola Music Company&mdash;the firm that's attempting to corner
the pianola music industry in Sydney."</p>

<p>"Petersen! Humberston! But he's not Captain Kettle?" objected
Hardy incredulously.</p>

<p>"Seems not," retorted the detective. "I'm beginning to
believe that your Dr. Night and Captain Kettle are one and the
same person."</p>

<p>"Number one," observed Inspector Frost, as he rose to his
feet from beside the wounded gunman, Humberston. "If they're all
as ready with their gats as he, there'll be a devil of a
shooting&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the bursting in of the French windows
and the abrupt entry of a number of police, attracted by the
shooting.</p>

<p>"Huh! I forgot you chaps would roll up at the sound of the
shots. Just as well you came. Looks as if we'll have quite a
job, raking out this hell-hole. Now then, Bob, what about the
door?"</p>

<p>Hardy crossed to the fireplace and pressed the concealed
spring. The panel slid aside, noiselessly. Beyond lay the
passage, silent, cool and grim beneath the glow of an electric
globe just within the door.</p>

<p>He turned and faced the room, lit by the soft glow from the
shaded lamps. A slight breeze was blowing in from the open
window, stirring the curtains and gently swinging the globes.
Almost in centre of the room lay the American, one of the
detectives bending over him, administering first aid.</p>

<p>The journalist shuddered and quickly looked away. He had a
sudden distaste for the coming adventure. This hounding of men,
even though they might be criminals, held a primitive excitement
that carried with it a revulsion of the more delicate
sensibilities.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Bob?" The Inspector's voice appeared to
come from a distance, although the police officer was standing
at his shoulder. "If we don't make a move soon we'll lose all
the advantages of surprise. Humberston will be missed and Dr.
Night, or this Captain Kettle, will be up here to find him."</p>

<p>Roused from his reverie, Hardy made a step through the secret
door. The heavy hand of the Inspector held him back.</p>

<p>"You come second, lad. I lead."</p>

<p>A few steps through the door, and the passage bent quickly to
the right. The raiders were standing at the head of a flight of
stairs, leading apparently into the bowels of the earth. Here
the light of the electric light just within the secret door
showed very faintly. Frost led the way down steps, and the
journalist followed him, counting twenty-eight steps.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the stairs a short passage led onwards,
shrouded in gloom. Frost snapped on the light of his torch and
threw the beam before them. Hardy added the strength of his
torch to the glow and, under the combined light, the little army
moved forward. The passage proved to be about twenty feet in
length, and ended in a wall of natural rock. Calling lowly for
more light, Frost explored for a door with practised hand.</p>

<p>"What's behind this, Bob?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"Boatshed above, water in front," the journalist answered
promptly and confidently.</p>

<p>"Should say you're right. There should be a door here, but I
can't find one. Look to the roof."</p>

<p>The glow of half-a-dozen torches swept the roof, to reveal
only the solid stone. The detective was frankly puzzled. Why had
the passage been made, and in this direction. Whence had the
gunman come, to meet his wounding and capture in the study of
"Forest Home?"</p>

<p>With a muttered exclamation Frost swung round, his torch
describing ft half-circle in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Look, Bob." Frost's light had settled on a passage that led
back at an acute angle to the one they had come along. "Here's
the answer."</p>

<p>A concentration of light showed only a long passage,
sheltered at the far end in darkness their torches could not
penetrate. Frost made a step along it, and then turned towards
the wall behind them.</p>

<p>"Don't like to leave that behind me," he muttered. "Still, we
can pick it up when we've routed out the gang. Hang it! Come
along, you fellows. If it does lead to the boat-house Dr. Night
is not likely to be there. Our men in the grounds would have
routed him out, long before this. Masters, stand along that
passage and keep a watch on that wall. Shoot if you have to, or
if you see anything like a door opening&mdash;and shoot
straight. Whew, I'm getting nervy in this rat-hole."</p>

<p>With eager steps the detective led down the new corridor,
followed by Hardy and his men. As he walked along he threw the
light of his torch in every direction. Hardy, at the Inspector's
elbow, kept his light focussed ahead. The men followed closely,
their torches dark, yet every man's finger rested on the switch,
ready to flood the corridor in light at the first signs of
necessity.</p>

<p>The passage appeared to have been cut with considerable skill
through Sydney sandstone. Most of the corridor was dry, but in
places the water oozed through cracks in the rock and formed
little pools on the floor. In the faint light of the police
officer's torch the journalist noted that the roof of the tunnel
held an electric light cable.</p>

<p>"Must have cost a lot of money to cut this rat-hole,"
commented Frost, waving his torch-light around.</p>

<p>"That is one of the problems I cannot quite understand,"
answered Hardy. "Snow running may be a profitable business, but
this gang are running things on a scale that I can't even guess
at. How do they manage to balance the sheet and leave a
profit?"</p>

<p>"I'll worry about that when I get to the end of this job,"
retorted Frost grimly. "This passage appears to have had
considerable use. Look at the floor. It's quite smooth, as if
padded by generations of feet. Where does it lead to and what is
it for? Darn it! There's not a door in sight."</p>

<p>"You notice the electric cable along the roof?" asked
Hardy.</p>

<p>The Inspector flashed his light aloft. "So there is. Smith,
run back to the room and see if any of the switches there work
these lights. Anderson and Brown, space out after him and report
both ways. And&mdash;I say, you fellows, just keep a watch on
the walls as you go along; you may find a switch on the way
back. Off with your light, Bob. We'll have to finish this job in
the dark. It's too risky with our torches shining. Why, the
doctor and that Captain Kettle could pot us off, one after the
other, and we not get a shot back."</p>

<p>In silence and darkness, the little group waited for the
return of the messengers. The minutes passed slowly, and alter
what seemed to Hardy a wait of hours the lights of the
plain-clothes men's torches returning from above, showed sharply
in the tunnel.</p>

<p>"Nothing along the passages, and the lights in the room
control only house light," repeated Frost angrily. "Then, where
the deuce do these lights come from? Well, it can't be helped.
We'll have to feel our way along, Bob. You take the left-hand
wall and I'll take the right. If you want light, hold your torch
well away from your body. You chaps, follow along the wall on
either side."</p>

<p>Slowly the little procession moved forward in the thick
darkness. Another fifty feet and Frost called a halt. "Anything
to report, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Blank wall my side, Inspector."</p>

<p>"Same my side. Where do you think we are now?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere under the bluff between 'Forest Home' and
'Holmhurst.'"</p>

<p>"Thought so. Well, we can't do anything but go forward.
Ready? No, wait a moment. Smith, go back to the house and get
that bluff surrounded by land and water. Remember orders. No one
to pass the lines except by my personal permission. Got ahead,
Bob."</p>

<p>One hand sweeping the wall, the other holding his torch,
Hardy moved slowly forward.</p>

<p>This slow crawl through the darkness was wearing on his
nerves. He began to see things&mdash;to imagine the darkness
before him held shapes and figures uncouth and grotesque. Dark,
leering faces, yellow fanged, and with exaggerated Chinese eyes,
watched him from the darkness. Almost instinctively, his right
hand sought his pocket and dropped his torch, to pick up his
automatic. He had it half-way out of his pocket when the wall on
his left suddenly fell away from his hand. He gave a sudden,
half-strangled exclamation and wrenched the weapon from his
pocket.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Bob?"</p>

<p>The Inspector's whisper came weirdly out of the darkness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p class="first">"LIGHTS!" Hardy transferred the automatic to
his left hand and felt for his torch. As he pressed the button a
beam of light from across the passage struck the wall well ahead
of the journalist, and travelled slowly back, it rested on a
small, low doorway, sunk deep into a recess into which Hardy had
wandered. Frost gave the signal for lights and then crossed over
and carefully examined the door. It was fastened, apparently on
the inside, for there appeared to be no bolts or bars on the side
facing that passage. Frost scratched his head with the peak of
his hat.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see what's behind you," he muttered addressing
the door. "Wonder if you'd be hard to force? No. There's time
for you when I come to the end of this warren. Come on, Bob.
Jones, stand against the wall opposite that door and keep your
flash on it. Shoot if it moves. That'll bring us back on the
run."</p>

<p>Again the small party moved forward through the darkness, to
be brought to a halt by a whisper from the Inspector. Almost at
the same moment, Hardy spoke:</p>

<p>"Ran against a wall, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Wall's given way here," retorted the Inspector. "Let's have
some light. Looks as if the passage bends here."</p>

<p>The light of Hardy's torch illuminated a wall closing the end
of the passage. Slowly the light travelled over the wall and
fell into a passage, turning to the right. It was but a short
one, a bare ten feet in length and was closed at the end by a
heavy door.</p>

<p>Frost pressed the button of his torch and added the light to
Hardy's. In a few strides he covered the distance. The door was
of iron and heavily guarded by massive bolts and bars.</p>

<p>"Looks as if it was never intended to be opened," shouted
Frost, tugging at the fastenings. "Lor', it must have been
constructed to stand a siege."</p>

<p>"An outlet on the harbour," guessed the journalist. "This
place must have taken some building."</p>

<p>"Too right!" Frost lifted with a grunt a heavy bar of iron
and stood it against the wall. "And our people never suspected
this. What do they want it for? They get all their stuff in
through the music rolls."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they go in for larger contraband."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" The Inspector's voice was heavy with
suspicion of the more prosaic police officer. "Guess away, if
you think it will do us any good." Frost attempted, heavy
sarcasm. "Huh! That's the lot. Now, what's behind all this?"</p>

<p>The door swung open with a slight squeak. Frost stepped out
into the open night, and Hardy followed close upon his heels.
They were standing on a narrow ledge of rock at the foot of the
high bluff, on the edge of the harbour. The cool winds of the
night were just riffling the waters into sparkling wavelets, under
the light of the moon. A Manly boat was passing, some little
distance from the shore. On board a merry party were filling the
air with laughter and snatches of song. The lights of the ferry
lit up the waters, turning the crests of the wavelets into a
sparkle of brilliant gems.</p>

<p>"A natural wharf," commented Frost. "Who'd have suspected
this? Look at that cliff, Bob."</p>

<p>The door had swung back while they had been gazing at the
beautiful harbour scene. All the journalist could see was a
high expanse of rock, rugged and broken, but showing no signs of
the door through which they had passed on to the ledge of rock.
Their long and weary crawl through the passages beneath "Forest
Home" might have been but a phantasy of a dream.</p>

<p>The Inspector started towards the face of the rock. For some
time he tested the cliff with the butt of his revolver, but
everywhere he was met with the sharp click of steel on rock. The
door had completely disappeared.</p>

<p>"Damn it&mdash;" The Inspector's temper was rising. "What do
those chaps think they are doing? Why don't they open the
door?"</p>

<p>With a laugh, Hardy pointed to the face of the rock some
distance away from where the Inspector was testing, vainly, the
cliff. The door that had shut so silently had re-opened. A
couple of plain clothes men standing just outside it, their
torches shining wanly in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Faced with solid rock, inches thick." Frost was carefully
examining the door. "Shut off those lights, chaps. Do you want
to get a bullet in you?"</p>

<p>Re-entering the passage, Frost had the door carefully
rebarred and stationed a man before it. Then he led the way back
to where the plain-clothes man stood on guard before the
mysterious door.</p>

<p>As they advanced the light of his torch, playing on the door,
cut weirdly through the darkness.</p>

<p>"Anything to report?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir."</p>

<p>"Then we'll deal with this mysterious door and what lies
behind it. Let's hope we'll get to something definite here.
Lights, while I see how it's to be opened."</p>

<p>Impatiently, the Inspector put his shoulder to the iron of
the door. It swung inward, easily.</p>

<p>"Jones!" The Inspector exclaimed, angrily.</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"You told me that no one had come out of here."</p>

<p>"No one has come out of that door, sir. It hasn't moved all
the time you've been away."</p>

<p>"It was locked when I tried it before. Now it is open."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The Inspector flashed his light on the man's face. Jones
appeared to be as bewildered as his superior officer.</p>

<p>"Humph!" The Inspector turned to the door and pushed it open.
The room beyond was in darkness. "What's in here, I wonder?"</p>

<p>As he spoke the lights through the passage and within the
room sprang to life, flooding the place with a brilliancy that
bewildered and dazed the little group of raiders.</p>

<p>Hardy gave a sigh of relief when the electric globes in the
underground warren beneath "Forest Home" lit. At last they were
to come face to face with Dr. Night!</p>

<p>The sudden flooding with light of the chamber in which they
stood showed that the master-criminal was well aware of their
presence in the warren and had chosen his time in which to
receive them. His imprisonment in the house had shown Hardy that
the mysterious person who headed the gang of criminals had at
his command powers which he was unable to understand. Much as be
desired to come to grips with the man and free the country from
the menace overshadowing it, he feared for his companions and
himself. Dr. Night would never allow himself to fall into the
hands of the police.</p>

<p>The incident of Humberston in the doctor's study but a short
hour before had shown him that the gang were desperate and
willing to take any means to defeat their enemies. Would Dr.
Night put up the same kind of fight?</p>

<p>Hardy did not believe that he would. The two men were of
different calibre. The master-criminal was of a cold calculating
nature, entirely unsuited for physical violence. He was the more
dangerous in that he possessed an intelligence of the highest
power trained in the subtle unknown arts of mysterious Asia.
From him could be expected some awful manifestation of powers of
nature unknown to the civilisation of the white man.</p>

<p>In that underground citadel he had with him the man known as
Captain Kettle. From what the journalist had learned about the
man it was possible that he, like Humberston, would choose to
fight it out, automatic in hand. But Humberston had been alone
with his enemies when he went down to Frost's bullet. Would the
doctor permit his one remaining white companion to follow the
same road? Hardy doubted.</p>

<p>Inspector Frost stood in the centre of the underground
chamber and looked around. The room had been cut from the
sandstone that underlies most of the hills in and around Sydney.
It was bare of furniture except for a small table and chair,
placed against the wall at the far side. Close to the chair, and
within arm's reach, was a door that opened into the room. The
floor was uncarpeted, and Hardy was reminded instinctively of
the ante-chamber of some lodge-room, where initiates were
prepared for the ceremony.</p>

<p>For some moments the little band of police stood as if
waiting a summons. Then, suddenly, the Inspector strode forward,
towards the door.</p>

<p>As he approach the door swung slowly open, as if of its own
volition. Beyond lay a short wide passage leading to another
door, before which stood two gigantic Chinese, armed with large
curved swords and dressed in semi-uniform.</p>

<p>At the sight of the advancing police they lowered their
weapons, as it in salute and stood aside from the door. Hardy
pressed forward until he had regained his old position at the
Inspector's shoulder.</p>

<p>Frost hesitated a moment when he stood before the guards.
Hardy could read his thoughts and touched his arm in warning.
Frost would naturally want to arrest anyone found in that
warren, but the journalist recognised the folly of commencing a
fight with the servants and allowing the masters time to perfect
their escape or means or resistance. The Inspector nodded
shortly.</p>

<p>The impulse had passed, and with but a cursory glance at the
Impassive Orientals, he passed through the door to come face to
face with the arch-criminal, Dr. Night.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<p class="first">A LONG room, almost a hall, lit by concealed
lights that threw a coloured glow over the lower part of the
room and, leaving the roof in deep gloom, gave the impression of
great height. This effect was enhanced by the decoration of the
ceiling. It represented the heavens, and the artist, aided by
wonderful lighting, had given the impression of vast spaces. The
walls were painted to represent the forests of an Oriental
country. Here again was the effect of distances, unattained by
modern European artists.</p>

<p>To the journalist it seemed as it he stood on the edge of a
clearing looking over far-flung wildernesses towards a distant
circle of hills. In the centre of the room stood a half-circle
of queer stools. Stools they really were, yet each stool had a
high semi-circular back that partially enveloped the occupant.
Facing the semi-circle was a raised platform on which was placed
a highly-ornamented throne, supported on each side by two huge
peacocks, their tails spread and quivering the slight breeze
that floated through the opened door. Throne and stools were
occupied by Chinese, evidently of high mandarin rank, and each
man wore a head-dress of white silk that came down nearly to his
lap. Before the throne and covered by a long piece of silk stood
a long low table.</p>

<p>Hardy shuddered at the sight of it. The thing bore a sinister
resemblance to a bier. For a space, the two groups of men
remained motionless. The figures seated on the throne had not
turned or moved at the entry of the police. They sat as if
carved in stone, their faces turned towards, their master.
Inspector Frost advanced a couple of paces; then stopped, as if
undecided as to what action to take.</p>

<p>"Whom seek ye?" The ancient question rang through the room,
as if penetrating the vast illusionary distances of the
paintings on the walls. The gaily plumaged birds, flanking the
throne, stretched higher their vivid, quivering feathers.</p>

<p>"Whom seek ye? Again I ask."</p>

<p>"I seek the man known as Dr. Night." Frost stepped forward,
his head erect. Hardy felt a wave of fear sweep over him at the
spectacle of his friend confronting, fearlessly the unknown
menace of the east.</p>

<p>"I am he!" The figure on the throne stood up slowly and
removed the veil that hung before his face. It was Dr. Night,
but changed. No longer the slight grey figure that Hardy had
traced from the telephone box in Oxford Street to the house at
Potts Point. No longer the scientist, "snow" importer, criminal;
but a monarch on his throne, conscious of his glory and
power.</p>

<p>The slight grey figure had disappeared. The flowing robes of
a silk rarely seen by alien eyes, gave him a majesty supreme. On
his head rested a circlet of beaten gold, arching quaintly to
the head and neck of a peacock. The metal of the crown was
almost hidden by the glory of the gems with which it was
studded&mdash;gems fitted to grace the diadem of any monarch;
but shadowed to insignificance by the supreme glory of the jewel
the gold bird held within its beak&mdash;a pearl the size of a
wren's egg and of a glorious green, mirroring the tumbling
iridescent waters of tropical seas.</p>

<p>Silently the veiled figure on the stool in the centre of the
semi-circle, facing the throne, rose and drew his chair to one
side, leaving an avenue from the door to the foot of the dais.
As if he had awaited the unspoken invitation, he strode forward
until he stood facing the throne, and beside the shrouded
bier.</p>

<p>"What seek ye?" Dr. Night asked the question
passionlessly.</p>

<p>"I hold a warrant for the arrest of the man known as Dr.
Night." Frost was not speaking in his usual firm tones. He
seemed to be struggling with some inexplicable emotion. "I am
the man known in the city by the name of Dr. Night. Ye seek
me?"</p>

<p>"I hold a warrant for your arrest on a charge of murder. Do
you surrender?"</p>

<p>The lips of the master-criminal curved slightly. With a
slight motion his hand he indicated the bier before him. The
veiled man who had given passage to the Inspector came forward
and stood beside the bier.</p>

<p>"I also hold warrants for the arrest of two men&mdash;Carl
Humberston and Peter Jackson, alias Captain Kettle. I shall also
hold every person here assembled under arrest, pending
investigation."</p>

<p>Frost spoke unemotionally, yet with obvious effort. "It is my
duty to warn you that anything you say may be used against
you."</p>

<p>"Carl Humberston lies above, wounded by your revolver." Dr.
Night spoke impassively, yet with an authority that perplexed
Hardy. He did not act as if all avenues of escape were closed
against him, and that before him stood the shame of the dock and
the hangman's noose.</p>

<p>"For Peter Jackson, my servant, who is known to you as
Captain Kettle&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>With a swift gesture the shrouded figure beside the dais
withdrew the overshadowing, silk. On the bier lay a man, bearing
on his chest what looked to be a coil of rope. Hardy had stepped
silently forward and now stood beside the Inspector. A quick
glance showed him that the man lying before them had been
strangled. The features were twisted and pain stricken, yet from
the description he had of the man, the journalist could not
doubt but that Captain Kettle, lay before him&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>"My servant dared to disobey my commands. I have punished
him. He is beyond your power."</p>

<p>The low tones of the master-criminal rang through the chamber
as the decree of fate. The silent figures on the stools bowed
their heads, as if acknowledging the justice of the
punishment.</p>

<p>"Murder!" Frost spoke in a rasping voice. "Seems to me that
you've got a double murder to answer for, Dr. Night. Strangled,
and by this queer rope." The Inspector was bending over the
corpse. With an inquisitive finger he flicked the coiled rope on
the man's chest. The thing seemed to writhe at his touch. Frost
gazed at it with astonishment. After a moment he caught it by an
end and held it up.</p>

<p>"Jove!" The exclamation burst from Hardy involuntarily. "The
monkey's tail." His memory flew back to the night when he had
been thrown into the and had been rescued by Doris. On their way
home they had stood and watched on the blinded window of "Forest
Home" this "tail" attached to some person. Its strange shape and
lithe animal nature could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>Frost stood before the throne on which Night had again seated
himself, the strange tail in his hand. As he held it up the
thing quivered and shook as it animated with life. Frost laughed
suddenly. The thing was swaying in his hands, its oscillations
becoming more and more strong. With a sudden effort it swung up
and caught on to his arm. Quickly it established its hold,
twisting round and round the arm of the dazed man. Then, with a
sudden jerk it wrenched its end from the police officer's grip
and commenced to work its way up his arm, towards his body.</p>

<p>"The devil!" Frost uttered the exclamation in low, puzzled
manner. He made no attempt to free himself from the grip of the
thing. His eyes were on the writhing, moving rope.</p>

<p>"Quick, Frost."' Hardy sprang to the police officer's side.
"Throw the Thing away! Quick, or it will kill you!" The
journalist seized the rope and sought to wrench it from the
detective's arm. It held on strongly. Hardy turned to the silent
seated figure, standing before the throne.</p>

<p>"Dr. Night! Would you kill him?"</p>

<p>The dark fathomless eyes of the master-criminal turned for
one instant from the steady look into the eyes of the police
officer. At that moment Hardy felt a relaxation in the
resistance of the Thing. Putting his strength he wrenched it
from the Inspector's arm, taking with it the whole of the man's
jacket. As he turned and threw the Thing at the feet standing
before the throne, the journalist caught a glimpse from the
master-criminal's eyes. They were flaming with hate and baffled
fury. Then gradually the expression became again calm and
serene.</p>

<p>"So that's your game."</p>

<p>Frost shook himself, as a dog coming out of water. Bracing
himself he advanced a couple of steps. As he placed his foot on
the dais, a look of puzzled wonder came in his eyes. His muscles
tensed as if he was forcing his way forward against some great
unseen power. For minutes he swayed as if seeking, from side to
side, some form or resistance. Then, suddenly, he collapsed a
huddled heap on the steps; his head almost touching the feet of
Dr. Night.</p>

<p>Hardy gazed at the fallen figure of his comrade in wild
amazement. But a couple of minutes before, Frost had stood
virile and clothed with the might of the law, before the throne
of the mysterious criminal, Dr. Night. Now he was lying, a poor
broken tangle of flesh and bones, across the foot of the
dais&mdash;and no tangible thing had wrought the change.</p>

<p>A sudden anger surged up in the heart of the journalist. He
took a step forward and half-raised his revolver. To his
amazement his arm was powerless&mdash;some power was holding it
down. For a few minutes he strove to fight against it, but, as a
few hours earlier in his prison room, he found it irresistible.
Gradually it grew stronger and stronger, enveloping and guarding
the silent figure on the throne. It pressed him back, yet held
him from retreating. It surrounded him and he felt that it was
even penetrating his body and working outwards in a mighty
expansion. His lungs swelled and felt as if about to burst. His
eyes bulged and he could see but indistinctly. His brain was
whirling and, as a last resource, he turned painfully to the
small group of police crowded in the doorway.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<p class="first">"SHOOT! Shoot!" he exclaimed in a hoarse,
anguished whisper that seemed to tear the tissues of his throat.
"Shoot&mdash;and kill this devil!"</p>

<p>One of the men sprang forward, revolver in hand. Within the
semi-circle of chairs he hesitated, and raised his weapon. Hardy
turned to watch the master-criminal. Dr. Night, in all the
majesty of his royal robes, sat on his throne, silent and
unafraid, a slight smile curving his thin, cruel lips.</p>

<p>Yet the shot did not come.</p>

<p>Hardy painfully turned. The man was swaying on his feet, a
look of blank terror on his face. Presently he braced himself and
raised the revolver to the level of his face. For a full
minute he stood thus, motionless. Then his fingers contracted
and the sound of the shot re-echoed through the silences of the
hall. Again and again: the echoes of the shot whirled around the
room, growing; in intensity, until they jolted like peals of
thunder. The lights dimmed and waned, until the place was filled
with the gloom of a tropical storm. This air became black and
charged with the intensity of lightning. The veiled figures on the
stools bowed forward, until their white masks swept the ground.
Amid the roars of thunders came the whistling whip of driving
winds followed by the hiss of torrential rains. Yet none
fell.</p>

<p>The room grew dark, until the journalist could barely
distinguish the majestic silent figure seated on the high throne
above him. A queer soft light crept around the walls of the
room, lighting the painted landscape to a fearful reality. The
roof had disappeared and in its place had come a dark, drear sky
across which swept heavy banks of black clouds, charged with
electricity.</p>

<p>The distant hills lightened, as if by the reflection of a
setting sun. Their peaks grew bolder and more vivid. From them
came a rushing blinding wind that circled the room and swept
Hardy off his feet. He felt himself borne upwards and onwards;
whither he could not guess. The hills grew larger and larger and
at, lying amid a nest of low foothills, he saw a white-walled
city.</p>

<p>High in the air he was borne and over the battlements to the
centre of the painted city. There the winds gradually failed and
set him gently in a tiled square. Before him was a throne, set
high on tiers of marble steps; and on that throne sat Dr. Night.
Hardy looked around him. He was in the midst of a deserted city.
Yet the houses were firm and open. The shops were hung with
various goods. Carts stood in the streets; yet no living thing
save, the silent figure on the throne could be seen.</p>

<p>"Fool! Thrice accursed fool!" The voice of the master-criminal
came softly to his ears. Calm and emotionless, it
seemed as the voice of a god. "Fool, who challenged the powers
of my fathers handed to me through long generations; listen and
learn.</p>

<p>"For the wrongs your race did to my people in the days that
have passed, I brought to their lands the curse of the snow-white
powder. This is the message I give to you, the only white
man who has seen the city of the ancestors of the sons of
heaven.</p>

<p>"Long years ago the white man came to the coasts of the land
my fathers ruled. They asked to trade and we did not bid them
go.</p>

<p>"My people had their laws and their customs. Those laws and
those customs had served and had made them great in the days
when the white man was not. The white man brought with him the
juice of the poppy. The white man gave it to the people of my
fathers. The white man debased the people of my
fathers&mdash;and would not be denied. They brought soldiers who
fought the soldiers of my fathers until they were forced to
submit to the will of the foreigners.</p>

<p>"My fathers were helpless. Their hearts full of grief, they
left the lands they had ruled so long and came to the city that
had cradled their race. They set an impenetrable barrier between
their city and the world and lived, awaiting the day when the
white men would be swept from the face of the earth. For such
was the decree of the gods, spoken by the mouths of the priests,
their servants. Years passed, and the wail of my people came to
my ears. The white men had increased in power and in strength.
He had brought to the land of my people other things. He had
taught to them the illusion that lives in fermented drinks. My
people were slaves, seeking the gold and silver and precious
ores the divine gods had placed in the land, for the greatness
of their white conquerors.</p>

<p>"In my compassion I left the city of my waiting and came
among the white men. I learned their mysteries and added them to
the mysteries that my fathers had taught me. I fought the white
people with the snow-white powder they themselves had found and
given to the world.</p>

<p>"What of your people now, oh Robert Hardy? White men and
women have enslaved themselves to this drug; a drug more
powerful and terrible than the poppy juice your people brought
to my country. Now the white people cannot do without the
snow-white powder&mdash;and they must go to my people for it. For
that reason have I placed the people of my land among the people
of the white race.</p>

<p>"I have conquered. But a little time and the white people
will be but a nation under my feet. Already white women sell
their bodies for the fateful drug; white men give their gold
for its possession.</p>

<p>"I come again. I come when the snow-white powder has
accomplished its work. Australia belongs to the East, Your
people have taken it; to my people must it be returned. Until
the days of recompense be accomplished there is war between my
people and your people, Robert Hardy.</p>

<p>"And in the day of restoration there will be no will but my
will, no thoughts but my thoughts; and the land from the rising
of the sun to the setting of the sun shall be my land; and my
people shall rule all people.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Robert Hardy. I come again."</p>

<p>The majestic figure on the throne grew dimmer and dimmer. The
city became enveloped in darkness that no eye could
penetrate.</p>

<p>Hardy felt himself lifted high into the skies, yet all around
him floated the thick darkness. Higher and higher he mounted
until the air grew thin and rare; his breath became shorter and
more difficult.</p>

<p>With a mighty effort he flung his arms apart, rending the
darkness around him. Suddenly he dropped, down, down, through an
immensity of space. He saw the earth rising up to him, swiftly
and menacingly; and closed his eyes, waiting for the crash that
never came.</p>

<p>Hardy opened his eyes. He was lying in bed in a large simply
furnished room. He looked around uncomprehendingly. It was a
strange room. Where was he? What had happened?</p>

<p>He tried to think, but his head ached. Restlessly, he turned
on the soft, yielding pillows.</p>

<p>A girl rose from a chair beside the window and came across to
the bed. It was Doris.</p>

<p>He looked up at her gratefully.</p>

<p>"Bob! Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Remember? Remember, what?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Night and&mdash;and the&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl broke down, and lying her head on the pillow beside
him, sobbed softly.</p>

<p>Dr. Night! Swift as a picture on the screen, the scene came
back to him. Again he passed through the torture of the bare
hour in the underground warren beneath "Forest Home." Again he
saw Frost go down before a power he could not see or understand.
His hand came up and tenderly stroked the girl's hair.</p>

<p>"Frost?" he whispered, questioningly.</p>

<p>"We don't know, dear."</p>

<p>"The police?" The girl shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>Were they all gone, the gallant little band of gentlemen who
had thought life little to free the country from the menace of
the East? Was he alone&mdash;the onlooker&mdash;the sole
survivor? No, he could not believe that!</p>

<p>"Where?" Hardy asked painfully.</p>

<p>"Where did we find you?" The girl turned so that her cheek
lay beside her lover's. "On the rock ledge, dear. There was an
explosion. The bluff is a mass of broken rock. The police have
taken charge. They will not tell anyone&mdash;anything."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;there is&mdash;hope. Frost?" The journalist
muttered faintly.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;hope&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>The girl's voice was very low. "There&mdash;there is always
hope."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;Dr. Night?"</p>

<p>"You are the only one we know to be found, dear.
They&mdash;they are all in there."</p>

<p>Again into Hardy's brain come the last words of the mystery
man: "Farewell! I come again&mdash;"</p>

<p>Would he come again, this man with the strange mysterious
powers of forgotten ages?</p>

<p>Yes, he would come again. Hardy was sure of that&mdash;and
when he came&mdash;God help the people.</p>

<p>Painfully, Hardy turned so that his arm lay over Doris's
slender shoulders. Out of evil had come good; out of the
degradation and turmoil of human passions he alone of the lost
band had come back to the happiness and home of a woman's love.</p>
