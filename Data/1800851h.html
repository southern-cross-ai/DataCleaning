<hr>

<p>SIR ARTHUR CROSBIE was with the King at Oxford, as was the duty of a
man of honour, whilst at his seat of Milton Court, thirty miles away,
my Lord Belsingham sought to be merry with Sir Arthur's lady.

<p>A self-indulgent fellow troubled by no sense of duty either to King
or Parliament, his lordship discovered in the prevailing anarchy and
confusion of the realm the greater licence for a gay conduct which had
been a source of tears to many.

<p>To my Lady Crosbie it was merely a source of scorn, and she was at
such pains to make this clear that it was no fault of hers if she was
not understood until she had laid the lash of her riding-whip across my
lord's florid countenance.

<p>Her merely verbal rebuffs had been accepted as expressions of
coyness, or invitations to a greater ardour, and my lord's ardour was
inexhaustible in the pursuit of any wife but his own.

<p>It was in the liberal display of it one day, in an orchard meadow by
the Cherwell, under apple trees in blossom, that he came upon trouble.

<p>"It does you no honour to utter, my lord," she coldly reproved him,
"nor me to hear, words that should be spoken only to your lady."

<p>"Slidikins!" he crowed. "My wife? Where shall I find her? You've
surely heard that the heartless jade has left me?"

<p>"Oh, yes, I've heard. And in what circumstances!"

<p>Tone and glance were of scorn unutterable. Some weeks ago the
countryside had been agog with the ugly tale of how my Lady Belsingham,
weary of blows and insults and in terror for her life, had fled one
night from his seat at Broughton, and by her flight had supplied him
the occasion for some merry sport.<br><br>

<p>HE had hunted her with
his hounds, and had she not destroyed the scent by wading through the
shallows of the river for a mile or more it was likely the beasts would
have made an end of her. Nor since that night had she been seen again.

<p>My lord, however, was not to be put out of countenance by the
reminder. "I doubt you'll have been heeding the foul lies of the
countryside."

<p>"Are they lies? Where is my Lady Belsingham?" she asked with an air
of challenge. "It's a question that Sir Arthur may come to put to you.
For you'll not have forgotten that she was his cousin."

<p>"Life, madam, am I to be called to account because she's forsaken
me? A petulant, puling creature, that was never a proper mate for me."

<p>"I wonder where you would find a proper mate?"

<p>"Will you tease me with that question? Isn't it enough to madden a
man with your beauty, must you scourge him with your tongue?"

<p>"Be content that I employ no other weapon."

<p>He stood and stared at her in half laughing incredulity. Here, he
opined, was a fortress to be taken by assault.

<p>"Never scowl so," he admonished her "Come, Kate. Kiss and be
friends." And in his jovial, laughing way he laid boisterous hands upon
her.

<p>It was then, under his touch, that her little lingering patience
broke. She shook herself free, and stepped back to get her distance.
"You will have it." she said, and lashed him across the face with her
riding-whip.

<p>"Perhaps you'll pay heed to that, since you pay no heed to words."

<p>So well did he heed it that his joviality perished. The beast in
him was revealed in his snarl, as his hands flew to nurse his seared
countenance.

<p>"You cursed jade! You wild-cat! You need taming."

<p>"Not at your hands, my lord," she answered him, regally cold. "If
you crave satisfaction, Sir Arthur shall yield it to you. He shall hear
of this. Meanwhile you'll come no more to Milton, for if you come you
will not be received."

<p>He took an abusive, foul-mouthed leave, and went off in a rage
with a vanity as lacerated as his countenance. If in the past his
gallantries had known denials, at least none had ever been expressed
in violence, still less with the threat of an avenging husband. With
his amazement was blent a certain apprehension. Sir Arthur Crosbie was
something of a fire-eater, jealous of his rights, and ready at need
to maintain them with a sword. If her ladyship's threat was not idle,
there might be some unpleasantness to follow.

<p>The gods, however, it seemed, were on his side. So within a week or
so of that deplorable business under the apple blossoms, a piece of
scandal reached his lordship, in which he perceived his profit.

<p>It was conveyed to him by Parson Strong, whom he met in the village
street. The parson, a high-church man of the strongest royalist
sympathies, had begun by bewailing the godless disloyalty that plagued
the land.

<p>"God save his Majesty from these rebellious villains, as He surely
will, for it cannot be the Divine pleasure that tapsters and town
'prentices under such misguided knaves as this Colonel Cromwell, of
whom we've lately heard a deal, should set themselves up against men of
honour."

<p>Dolefully he shook his grey head. "There's wickedness in the very
air these days, my lord, and to be found where least expected. Who
would believe that Sir Arthur Crosbie's lady over at Milton, should be
sinfully neglectful of her wifely duty what time her knight is at the
King's side, away at Oxford."

<p>My lord stood fingering his tuft of golden beard, and conceiving
that this scandal was concerned with himself. "Why..." he blustered,
stammering a little, "Wha...What have you been heeding, parson?"

<p>Forth came an incredible tale of a young lover that Lady Crosbie was
harbouring in her very house of Milton Court.<br><br>

<p>"A LOVER, do you
say?" My lord was almost scornful of the tale.

<p>"Well may you disbelieve. But I hope I am not the man to slur a
lady's reputation without sound evidence. The evidence of my own eyes."
And he went on to relate how, riding two days ago by Milton Court, and
chancing to look over a hedge, he had beheld my lady sauntering in the
garden with a slim, foppish fellow, all silks and ribbons. They were
embracing.

<p>"Embracing!" growled his lordship in quest of details.

<p>"Embracing," the parson insisted. "They sauntered, as it were,
enlaced; each with an arm about the waist of the other. And as if
that were not enough, presently as I wat...as I observed them, this
outrageous fop pulled her to him yet more closely and fell to kissing
her, in the course of which, happening to raise his eyes, he saw me. At
that they fell apart in guilty confusion, and fled to hide their shame.
Yesterday I paid a visit to the Court, and old Giles, Sir Arthur's
servant, was forced to confess to me that this gallant is staying in
the house. In the house, my lord, and Sir Arthur at the wars."

<p>"Who is the man?" demanded the scowling Belsingham.

<p>"Your lordship's indignation does you honour. Who is he? That I
could not learn. I do not think he can be of these parts. A mere
stripling he seemed to me; but already ripe in the ways of wickedness.
My lady, as I know, possesses no brother or other male kin with whom in
honesty she could be so fond. I went there on a visit of remonstrance,
as becomes my office. But in her wantonness she was moved to mirth. She
never troubled to deny the thing, but just mocked me for my pains."

<p>My lord's full lips twitched unpleasantly under his fair moustache;
his blue eyes were hard.

<p>He was galled by what he had learnt, scorning a woman who whilst
deep in a shameless intrigue with some popinjay should assume against
himself a panoply of prudery and threaten him with a husband's wrath.
Presently he came to perceive how the husband's part should be to
avenge a rejected lover upon an accepted one. He found the notion
not only exquisitely humorous, but also possessing the advantage of
securing him from any such reckoning with Sir Arthur as he had been
dreading.<br><br>

<p>MY lord went home to compose the letter which
survives in the archives of Milton Court.

<p class="letter">"Deir Friend&mdash;Yt is sore greaved at hart that
I sende yow these to trouble your quiet mynde. But I were false to my
dewty to you and no trew freind did I concele a certain trewth when
your honour is in dainger, for the which reason I praye yow comehome at
once so that yow may recalle my ladie Crosbie to her wiffely dewty, and
punish as befittes the knave who makes hys profitte of yowr absence.
Yow were well not to lett yowr coming bee knowne, so that yow may
sorprise thees shameless ofenders."

<p>That elegant letter, signed, "Yowr most assured loving friend," was
delivered to Sir Arthur at Christchurch in Oxford upon the morrow. It
brought that hot gentleman to Broughton as fast as horse could carry
him.

<p>A slight but wiry, brisk man of thirty was Sir Arthur, with a
big brow above a narrow face, and moustachios that bristled like a
cat's. In leather jerkin and thigh boots, he creaked into Belsingham's
presence as my lord sat at supper.

<p>"What foul lies be these of which you make yourself the sponsor?"
was his fierce greeting.

<p>My lord, gravely calm before that stormy challenge, wiped his
moustachios, and rose, napkin in hand, to wave away the goggling
servants, nor spoke till they were gone.

<p>"Alas, my friend! Your disbelief does honour to your generous heart.
It deepens the offence of those who wrong you. The country is agog with
the tale of it." He supplied some details. "So public is the scandal
grown that already Parson Strong has remonstrated with her ladyship,
but&mdash;as he tells me&mdash;in vain."

<p>"Perish his soul for a meddlesome psalm-whiner." Sir Arthur was
vehemently savage. "He's sheltered by his plaguy cloth. But I'll find
some other throat to slit over this pretty story, and I'm come to do
it. From whom else have you the tale?"

<p>My lord was not comfortable. He spread his hands. "Oddspitikins!
Haven't I said that it's on the lips of the whole county?"

<p>"Curse on the county's hasty lips. Whom do they name?"

<p>"Faith, I don't think they've learnt his name."

<p>"Bah!" Sir Arthur was all incredulous contempt. "And you say he's
housed at Milton?"

<p>"Of that there can be no doubt."

<p>"No doubt, eh?" Challengingly he asked: "Dare you ride to Milton
with me now to prove it?"

<p>Uneasily Belsingham bowed to that wrathful peremptoriness.

<p>"I'm at your service always, my dear friend."

<p>And so, within the hour, the injured husband and his friend startled
Milton Court by an unheralded invasion. Belsingham was between
eagerness and anxiety; eagerness to be in at the death, to witness the
humbling of the proud jade; anxiety lest evidence should, after all, be
lacking, and this fire eater Crosbie should turn upon him.

<p>He was reassured, however, at the very outset by the demeanour of
the old servant who admitted them. His surprise at the unexpected
apparition of his master amounted to affright and sufficed to confirm
Belsingham's hopes and awaken Sir Arthur's misgivings. "Sir Arthur!" he
cried out, and yet again and louder still, so as to be heard by all the
house. "Sir Arthur! My lady is not expecting you. I'll go tell her that
you're come."

<p>His suspicions of treachery aroused, Sir Arthur strode into the
hall. "I'll tell her that, myself, Giles. Where is my lady? Above or
below?"

<p>The man gulped in panic.

<p>"Why don't you answer me? Where shall I find her?" He took his
answer from the servant's movement towards the staircase. "I see.
Above." He strode upon him. "Out of my way, man."

<p>Instead of standing aside, however, Giles went slowly up the stairs
ahead, on a pretext of conducting him. He gave tongue as he went, his
voice at its loudest and shrillest. At the stairhead, he put himself
once more in his master's way. "Will you be pleased to stay a moment,
Sir Arthur?"

<p>"What's to stay for?"

<p>"There's his lordship. At this hour belike my lady'll not receive
visitors."<br><br>

<p>SIR ARTHUR, perceiving now but pretexts to delay
him, and maddened by them, cuffed the old man aside and with Belsingham
close behind reached his lady's door to find it locked.

<p>"How now? Odds-blood!" He beat upon the panel as if to break it.
"Open! Open!"

<p>Her ladyship's voice answered from within: "Wait, wait. I come."

<p>Sounds of hurried movements and some scraping followed and then, after
a pause that was another indication of treachery, came the question:

<p>"Who is there?"

<p>"Odds my life, madam! Do you not yet know my voice?"

<p>"Arthur!" The shrill note of joyous surprise which he must suppose
pretended went only to increase his rage.

<p>At long last the key turned, and the door swung open. My lady
trembling, pallid and dishevelled stood revealed in a flowing bedgown
of flimsy laces. Her dark eyes were wide, and on her lips a smile,
intended to convey a welcome, had rather the air of a grin of rigor.

<p>"Arthur!" she gasped. She was out of breath. "You...you take me by
surprise. What...Why had I no word of your coming?"

<p>His glance went past her, to rake the room. "Do you sit behind
locked doors?"

<p>"Ah...always in your absence."

<p>"You were monstrous slow to open."

<p>"You were not alone. It is not seemly that I receive my Lord
Belsingham in this disarray."

<p>Thus she betrayed how much she had known whilst still pretending
to be unaware of her husband's presence. He noted it, and his jealous
angry eyes considered every detail of her, even to the black smear
disfiguring the white hand she rested on the door's edge. Made cruel by
her treachery, he assumed an air of ease, so that he might play upon
her manifest terrors.

<p>"Shall we be ceremonious with an old friend and neighbour? Come you
in, Belsingham. Come in." He led the way past her into the anteroom to
her bedchamber.

<p>"Not here, Arthur." She laid a trembling, detaining hand upon his
arm. "I will come below if you will..."<br><br>

<p>"THERE, Kate! There," he laughed. "His lordship would never trouble
you so far. He will not tarry. Come in with you," he said again.

<p>Belsingham advanced, a false smile of greeting on his lips. It
thrilled him wickedly to behold my Lady Disdain so trapped that she
dare do no other than receive him courteously. He conceived the
compound of rage and fear in her vixenish heart, and he looked for rich
entertainment before departing. He murmured amiabilities, excused this
intrusion upon her, for which he begged her to blame her impetuous
husband, professed himself with playful gallantry the gainer by it,
since it privileged him to behold her ladyship in circumstances that
but enhanced her loveliness.

<p>And whilst he chatted, Sir Arthur strode about the chamber with
his careless, easy air, but his glance sweeping its every corner for
evidence of the hidden presence he suspected.

<p>He came in his restlessness to the wide hearth, and with his arm
upon the edge of its great cowl considered the hearthstones. They
were overlaid by the soot of a heavy recent fall, and in this a trail
betrayed that the fire-basket had very lately been dragged aside.
Associating with this my lady's blackened hand, it was suddenly
revealed to him where she had bestowed her gallant.

<p>His smile went grim in spite of him as he turned to her. "You are
pale, Kate. And trembling. Faith, it's little wonder. The weather is
cold and you're but thinly clad."

<p>"Cold?" she echoed, for the May night was of a more than seasonable
warmth.

<p>"Aye, cold, as I am. Are you not chilled, too, my lord?" He rubbed
his hands together and raised his voice: "Giles! Fetch me a taper for
these logs. Her ladyship is shivering."

<p>That brought her forward in a fresh surge of terror, a hand to her
breast. "No. No."

<p>"I insist. You must have proper care for your health, Kate."

<p>"But, Arthur, I...I stifle with the heat."

<p>"Why then you must be fevered."

<p>His lordship meanwhile, having scanned the hearth, understood and
savoured Sir Arthur's humour. "The night airs of May are treacherous,
madam." Meeting his glance, she understood at last that she was being
mocked, and her terror deepened.

<p>"Come, Giles." Sir Arthur was peremptory. "Bestir."

<p>The old man was shuffling forward with a taper when a fresh fall of
soot came down so explosively that Sir Arthur recoiled with the taste
of it in his throat. At once he sprang forward again to stare, at a
man's hat that lay now upon the hearth; a grey castor sadly blackened,
with a trailing plume held by a jewelled buckle.

<p>"Now I wonder how that comes there. Can you conjecture, Kate? Or
you, Belsingham?"

<p>Belsingham wagged his head. "If the chimney harbours such oddities,"
said he, grinning, "faith, it's time you had a fire to smoke them out."

<p>"My own opinion. To it, Giles."<br><br>

<p>"WAIT! Ah, wait!" my lady
shrilled, confronting her husband's mock surprise. "What comedy do you
play to desire a fire on so warm a night?"

<p>"Comedy?" he echoed, "Why, madam, you cannot have observed that
there are some matters in the chimney of which it were well to clear
it."

<p>"I see," she said, the fury of despair in her white face. "You
desire to shame me. But my Lord Belsingham? What does he desire? By
what right is he here?"

<p>"Oh, madam, I pretend to none." his lordship made haste to answer,
with a submission through which derision peeped, to goad her. "I am a
reluctant witness commanded by Sir Arthur."

<p>"And do you guess why, madam?" Sir Arthur raged. "Because I desired
his presence whilst I tested the tale he brought me. So fond was I that
I believed it was a lie to be thrust down his throat again."

<p>"Then, since now you find it true, there is no reason to detain him."

<p>This sudden cold effrontery staggered him. "That is for me to
determine," he retorted.

<p>"Nay, I think it is for his lordship. And you must respect his
natural repugnance to witness a woman's humiliation." She swung to
Belsingham again. "My lord, do not permit yourself to be abused into
lingering. Yield to your natural chivalry. Giles, light his lordship."

<p>But Sir Arthur intervened. "Do you still dare to order here?" he
cried, in angry amazement at this tone.

<p>She did not on that account abate it. "Whatever may he between you
and me, sir, my lord shall not be constrained to a course repugnant to
any man of honour."

<p>If she did not succeed in persuading Sir Arthur, at least she
succeeded in shaming his lordship into acquiescence, however vexatious
this dismissal with the curtain about to rise on a scene that promised
such rich entertainment.

<p>"Indeed, indeed, I could not wish to be an intruder longer."

<p>"It is not you, Belsingham, are the intruder," Sir Arthur stormed,
without intention to be witty.

<p>"Yet," her ladyship objected, "you cannot wish him to
remain...Unless, of course, you feel in need of a protector."

<p>"Pro...protector!" he roared. Goaded by the cunning taunt, he gasped
a moment for breath. Then he yielded furiously. "I'll not keep you,
Belsingham."

<p>His disappointed lordship murmured leave-takings and went out; Giles
followed to light him.

<p>As the door closed, Sir Arthur roused himself from his stupefaction.
"Now, madam, for this visitor of yours." He whipped out his sword,
and made for the hearth again. "We'll take a look at your coy
chimney-sweep. Will you come down, my lad? Or must I quicken you?"

<p>A pair of legs in blue velvet breeches hung in view a moment, then
the rest of a body descended in a black cloud. From out of it crawled
a slight stripling figure, begrimed from golden lovelocks to rosetted
shoes, a pair of scared eyes staring from a mask of coal dust.

<p>The cry with which my lady ran to the protection of this newcomer
was a fan to the flames of Sir Arthur's fury. He stepped back to make
room.

<p>"Stand forth, sir. Stand forth," he grimly invited. "Cast off the
coyness that drives you into chimneys. Let us behold you clearly. Let
us admire the charms to which my lady has succumbed."

<p>It was an invitation whose sardonic note would have delighted my
Lord Belsingham had he been permitted to remain. As it was, that
disappointed gentleman had gone home in the hope that Sir Arthur's need
of him should presently acquaint him with details which could not fail
to be amusing.

<p>At the earliest he counted upon this for the following morning. But
he was not to be kept waiting even until then.<br><br>

<p>IN the gloom of
his vast hall, two silver candle branches, reflected in the polished
surface of the dark oaken table, made an island of light; and here, a
couple of hours after leaving Milton Court, sat his lordship unbuttoned
and at ease, with a jug of ale. No sign of his wicked satisfaction
was displayed to Sir Arthur as he came striding in upon a lackey's
announcement. Lengthening his countenance in gravity, my lord rose to
receive this guest who sought him in affliction.

<p>"My poor friend," he murmured.

<p>"You do well to call me that." Sir Arthur was lugubrious. "I am in
sore distress."

<p>"I can well conceive it."

<p>"And I've a grim duty to perform."

<p>"You've not yet performed it? I understand. You desire to be formal.
It is wise. You'll need a friend in this sad business. Command my
services. Indeed, I was expecting you, though not to-night. You lose no
time, Arthur."

<p>"There's none to lose."

<p>"As you say. Such matters are best settled quickly. Whom did he
prove to be, the fellow in the chimney, this dastard who has taken so
vile an advantage of your absence?"

<p>"That's of no account. What really matters is that the good name of
my Lady Crosbie must be shielded."

<p>"To be sure it must."

<p>"I am relieved by your ready agreement." Sir Arthur looked
sorrowfully at my lord. He sighed. "I deplore what is to do. But I
see no help for it. It is plaguily misfortunate that you should know
something to the hurt of my lady's honour."

<p>"Nay, now," my lord protested generously. "Never let that trouble
you. You may trust my silence as you would your own."

<p>Sir Arthur sighed. "I would I could."

<p>"Oddsmylife, man, be sure you can. My oath on it. So be at ease, and
tell me on whom I am to wait for you. A cup of ale, now, to warm you."

<p>"Nay, nay. I'd best keep cool. You see, if the matter touched only
myself I could risk being lenient; but it don't. It touches my lady."

<p>"Of course. Of course. You waste words to tell me what I know."

<p>But Sir Arthur went on wasting them, apparently. "I am sure that you
mean me well. How, indeed, could I doubt so loyal and true a friend?
Yet accidents will happen, unguarded words will out. And so lackaday!-I
must make quite sure that you do not talk."<br><br>

<p>PUZZLED, and grown
impatient, my lord frowned at him. But for the wistful mildness of Sir
Arthur's manner he might suppose himself threatened. "I've said already
that you can be sure."

<p>"I know I can. I can make sure." He sighed again, "But I wish I
could do it without killing you."

<p>"K...Killing me!" Belsingham recoiled.

<p>"Do not take it amiss. You must perceive with what regret I approach
the task. But it's the only way to be sure. And I must be sure. You'll
agree with that."

<p>"I'll agree you're mad." Belsingham's prominent blue eyes bulged
like a frog's in a face gone grey. He began to understand at last that
Sir Arthur's smooth, melancholy manner was put on to mock him. He
looked about him wildly for a weapon, being unarmed. "Do you come here
to murder me?"

<p>"How can you think it of me? I'll wait until you find a sword, my
lord."

<p>My lord recovered from his panic. A gust of rage swept through him.
His eyes narrowed. "I'll not disappoint you. Let some friend of yours
wait upon me in the morning."

<p>"A friend? Where shall I find one in these days, when every man of
honour is with the King and every scoundrel with the Parliament, and
only cowards sit at home?"

<p>Belsingham trembled under that clear insult. "Very well, sir. It is
very well. My grooms shall serve for witnesses. I shall expect you in
the morning."

<p>"Ah, but you might talk between now and then," said Sir Arthur
gently. "I cannot take the risk of that. Come, sir. Summon your grooms.
Let them hold the lights And here's to quicken you," he added, and
sweeping off his hat he cast it in my lord's face.

<p>The blow quenched the last spark of my lord's reluctance. He bawled
for his servants.

<p>Sir Arthur flung off baldrick and doublet, and bared his blade, and
whilst my lord made ready two of his grooms thrust aside the heavy
table, clearing the centre of the hall. Then, with a groom on either
side holding a candle-branch aloft, the two gentlemen faced each other
in shirt and breeches.

<p>My lord was by much the bigger man, of longer reach and greater
animal vigour, and to these he trusted. But they availed him little
against the other's deadly practised skill. At the end of a half-dozen
disengages in which my lord had spent a little of his brawny fury, Sir
Arthur lured him to open himself by a feint in the high lines. As my
lord's blade swung up to the parry, a lightning thrust sped under his
ward and passed through him from breast to back.

<p>Sir Arthur's thrust had cut a Gordian knot. The truth which would
clear my Lady Crosbie's fair name might now be proclaimed without peril
to my Lady Belsingham. For what Belsingham died without suspecting
was that the gallant in the chimney, tricked out in Sir Arthur's best
blue velvet suit, was the wife his lordship had driven in terror from
Broughton and hunted with his dogs.
