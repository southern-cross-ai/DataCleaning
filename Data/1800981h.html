<h3>I</h3>

<p>ON the third day of his confinement in the old line-riders'
hut, Tom Darrah looked at the sky and decided reluctantly to
chance a run for Arrowhead. The driving Easter had stopped
sometime during the night and the ensuing calm was profound and
brittle&mdash;not the calm following a blown-out blizzard but
rather that sort of a sullen recess auguring worse to come. There
was no feel in the air of the bland chinook which erases and
melts the effects of the harsher winds; there was, in fact,
nothing to indicate change. Two feet of dry, packed snow lay
along the ridge and trimmed the pine boughs. A slate-gray sky
pressed its ceiling down within a hundred yards of the ground.
The footing, he knew, would be bad and the travel slow.
Nevertheless, Tom Darrah decided to make the try. So he saddled,
tied his tarp roll to the cantle thongs and started out. Crossing
three lesser ridges, he fell into the flats of the Arrowhead and
was around five miles from the cabin when the worst of his fears
were realized. The snow began falling again, softly bellying
down. A clap of wind rushed into the vacuum of stillness. Inside
of half an hour the full tempest was upon him, howling like a
thousand mongrel packs.</p>

<p>Arrowhead was east and out of that east rose a rushing,
screaming element he could not fight. There came a time when his
horse, stout and willing, was able only to march in its former
tracks; as for Tom Darrah, he could not face the knives of that
hurling blast. For man and beast Arrowhead became an
impossibility. Turning to northward, Darrah tried a tangential
advance. In that direction, about three miles, an abandoned
mining camp, Sumpter Gulch, butted against the hills and
furnished the shelter he had to have rather soon.</p>

<p>"An hour of this," he said casually to himself, "is about the
outside limit. Sumpter Gulch better be where I think it is."</p>

<p>It was a canny remark, for he had fought blizzards long enough
to realize how greatly they increased the probabilities of error.
All the landmarks were gone. Sky and horizon ceased to be. It was
a world suffocated and drowned out; and there actually seemed to
be no free space. The snow didn't strike the earth but ran
parallel to it in ever-thickening substance, and all this while
the cataclysmic wind beat the pony on its flank and drove it off
the true course. Great solid clouds were ripped up by that wind
and rolled against Darrah, tipping him in the saddle, smothering
him. The grayness of the morning deepened, the rumble and whine
and clapped-out reports increased. Now and then Darrah essayed to
correct his course&mdash;deliberately setting himself little sums
in arithmetic to think out, asking himself simple questions.
Storms like this one did things to a man, warped the mind and
dulled it; in some respects it was like the heat craze. Meanwhile
he felt the inward creep of the cold. Heavy as was his buffalo
coat and his ear-lapped cap, a slow paralysis struck his
extremities and worked back. The bandanna raised over his mouth
was quite stiff. Fringes of ice drooped from his brows and
lashes. Lids three quarters closed, he had only a narrow vision
of a world revolving like a wheel.</p>

<p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five," he said to
himself. "And five and five make ten. Pony, you dam' fool, quit
drifting on me."</p>

<p>Suddenly, like some island in an empty ocean, a scrub pine
loomed dead the fore. Instinctively the pony aimed at this and
got on its lee side and halted behind a shelter that was no
shelter at all. Tom Darrah beat his arms across his chest,
rapidly calculating. "I'm sliding over to the timber, or this is
the lone tree outside, of Sumpter Gulch. Or it might not be
either. Maybe I'm goin' backwards. No, that can't be right. The
wind's dead in the east. Sumpter should be less than a mile
forward. Go on, pony."</p>

<p>The horse, decidedly reluctant, bucked the drifts, its hoofs
rising like the pads of a dog. Bent over in the saddle, Darrah
saw a small dark object being kicked up by one of those hoofs. It
had been at the base of the tree, but the wind took it and threw
it twenty feet before it lodged in the snow again. Riding that
way, Darrah bent over to the uplifted surface, got the object and
held it unobserved a moment while he fought the pony into the
slanting blast. When he looked down his distorted vision got only
a blur and it was some moments before he could focus his vision
on what he held, a woman's fur-lined gauntlet stiffly frozen.</p>

<p>In weather such as this was there could be only one thing to
surmise and only one reaction. Darrah turned the pony toward the
tree, literally pushing the beast a hundred yards into the teeth
of the incredibly bitter blizzard. Afterwards he wheeled and
drifted on an exploring circle, finding nothing. The second time
he made his circle the tree stood very dim on his right hand and
presently he lost it. By now he was considerably downwind, bowled
along like a piece of debris. Struggling back, he could not lift
that tree again. Once more dragging the area&mdash;without
luck&mdash;he discovered he could never repeat the maneuver a
fourth lime. The pony refused to face the wind. It stood still,
stubborn and exhausted.</p>

<p>"If she's out here," Darrah said to himself, "she's dead and
buried. May have floated miles from the tree." Hard as the
thought was, he could do nothing more about it; and squaring
himself at the uncertain north, he pressed on.</p>

<p>It was the horse that discovered the abandoned camp first.
Knocking along the drift with a stumbling discouragement, the
beast flung up its head and whinnied and thereafter showed a
surprising remnant of strength. Darrah let the reins go slack.
Ten minutes later the huddled line of Sumpter's old buildings
made a phantom appearance through the storm mists and he was in
that camp's single street before he quite had oriented himself.
The pony, surer of judgment, struggled against a head-high bank
of snow and bucked a trail through it, to stop against the closed
doors of a deserted stable. Darrah got immediately down, kicked
open a smaller doorway beside the large ones and went in. The
pony followed close at his heels, eager as a human to be out of
the torture. Along the clammy darkness of the stable rose the
sound of other horses stamping and shifting.</p>

<p>"So," grunted Darrah, mildly surprised. "I'm not the only one
caught in this blow."</p>

<p>His eyes burned, his cheeks began to ache. But presently the
blankness before him coagulated to shapes and silhouettes. Going
along the line of stalls he found an empty space near the end. He
put his pony there, unsaddled, threw the saddle blanket over the
beast for whatever warmth it would afford; and then, curious
about his neighbors, he casually cruised the stalls. He counted
twenty-four horses, all dry enough to have been stabled a
considerable time. More closely investigating, he found some of
them branded Lazy JT&mdash;which caused him to wonder what Lewes
DeSpain's outfit was doing so far from home. Nearby, he ran into
the Circle Arrow iron and he guessed that this bunch had been out
on a winter inspection. Then he brought up in front of a horse
with narrowing, quickened attention. The Slash N on that rump
made him whistle softly.</p>

<p>"Nig Sommers. What kind of company have we got collected out
of this blizzard?"</p>

<p>The question was worth an answer&mdash;for Sommers and
Sommers' men were notorious. Going to the door, Tom Darrah pushed
his way into the stinging slash of the storm and stood three
quarters buried in the drift a moment, surveying the buildings
across the street. Necessity, he reflected, made strange
bedfellows. Under ordinary conditions these three outfits could
not be got together in the same town and it took a powerful
motive to put Sommers within gun distance of any ranch crew.
Directly opposite he saw light leaping through the windows of
what used to be Sumpter's hotel, and without further reflection
he ploughed a trail to it and went in.</p>

<p>Sudden heat struck him; this and the smell of drying clothes.
On the far side of the lobby a great fireplace was banked high
with blazing wood. In front of it stood eight men, all facing him
with a show of deep interest. He recognized the Circle Arrow crew
and more particularly the slim and yellow-headed young foreman,
Lonzo Hardesty, who confronted him with a kind of indifferent
alertness. At the moment he failed to remark the oddity of this
attitude.</p>

<p>"Move over, Lonzo," said Darrah. "I damned near didn't make
this camp."</p>

<p>Lonzo Hardesty's answer was somewhat noncommittal. "Glad to
see you, Tom. Don't come near this heat till you thaw out. You
look nipped."</p>

<p>Darrah stripped off his outer clothes and stepped away from
the puddling water around his feet. He chafed his ears
vigorously. "How long you been here, boys?"</p>

<p>"This is our third day," grunted Lonzo Hardesty. "We were up
in the hills lookin' after beaver tails when the Easter come.
Don't look now like we'll ever get clear of this dam' place. Hate
to think of the amount of frozen beef lyin' around this
country."</p>

<p>Darrah chuckled. "I observe you got company."</p>

<p>"What?" said Hardesty, a little sharp with the question. Then
he said, "Oh, sure. You mean Lazy JT and Nig Sommers. Ahuh. JT
boys are campin' in the old jail office. Sommers&mdash;him and
six other of his mugs&mdash;took to the saloon."</p>

<p>"A friendly gatherin'," drawled Darrah.</p>

<p>"We'll get along&mdash;apart," muttered Hardesty.</p>

<p>"Who's in charge of the Lazy JT lads?"</p>

<p>"Eric Bull."</p>

<p>Darrah showed a little surprise. "Lewes DeSpain always used to
ride these winter tours with his men. He ain't along this
time?"</p>

<p>"No," said Hardesty.</p>

<p>Something about that answer brought Darrah's attention
strictly back to Hardesty. It had been a barren, laconic answer
and it hit the silence of the room flatly. It occurred to him now
something was wrong. These men were not at ease. Distinctly they
had an edge to their tempers. They were taut as fiddle strings.
Hardesty remained still in his tracks, the lines of his cheeks
drawn tight and his mouth dipped at the corners. He said "No"
again with a more metallic inflection and kept his sober eyes on
Darrah. It came to Darrah that the group was touched by the
weather, turned cranky by close confinement. Yet that hardly
explained the touch of actual unfriendliness demonstrated toward
him. He had it on his mind to ask another question and then
decided against it. Curiosity had a place and a time, neither of
which items seemed now favoring. So he moved nearer the fire and
kept his mouth closed. Hardesty wheeled, speaking.</p>

<p>"Where've you been, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Was over at The Pass for a month. Started for Arrowhead five
days back and got caught in one of your old line cabins when the
blow came on first time. This morning I figured I'd try again. I
was lucky gettin' here. No doubt of that."</p>

<p>"When was you at that line cabin?" rapped out Hardesty.</p>

<p>"All of the last three days," answered Darrah, surprised at
Hardesty's tone.</p>

<p>"Then you came straight here? Which way did you come
here?"</p>

<p>"Out into the flats," said Darrah. "What's the palaver
about?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," grunted Hardesty and fell silent.</p>

<p>"So you're just talkin' to make sound?" said Darrah
skeptically.</p>

<p>"This ain't no time for humor," muttered Hardesty, rough and
curt.</p>

<p>"If there's any humor around here," pointed out Darrah, now
irritated, "you're furnishing same. What's biting you?"</p>

<p>The front door came open and slammed violently against the
inner wall. Eric Bull, the Lazy JT foreman, stamped in with nine
or ten of his outfit filing behind him. Looking sidewise for a
reaction, Darrah saw the Circle Arrow crew stiffen and turn more
taciturn. Hardesty was rolling a cigarette at that moment, but
his fingers stopped moving.</p>

<p>"Hello, Eric," drawled Darrah.</p>

<p>"Thought it was you that came in," said Eric Bull
truculently.</p>

<p>"So you came to see."</p>

<p>"So I came to see," repeated the JT man and squared himself
toward the fire. It was a characteristic gesture on his part; he
always put his blocky body definitely against those with whom he
talked. No taller than the slim Lonzo Hardesty, he was probably
twice as broad and twice as heavy. He had a short bull neck
supporting a heavy head and uncompromising features as ruddy as
wine. A high-arched nose swooped down toward a stubborn chin that
came out to meet it and this conformation of bone and muscle
always made him appear on the verge of biting something. He said
gruffly, "Where'd you come from?"</p>

<p>"From a line cabin about eight miles back in the hills."</p>

<p>"That so? How long was you there?"</p>

<p>The questions, mimicking those earlier asked by Hardesty,
stirred a sudden suspicion in Darrah's mind. But he answered
readily, "About three days."</p>

<p>"Anybody with you?"</p>

<p>"Nope. Alone."</p>

<p>"Been ramming the country before that?"</p>

<p>"Nope. Came from The Pass."</p>

<p>Eric Bull put his head forward, seeming more and more
truculent. "See anybody on your way here? Anybody or
anything?"</p>

<p>"Nope," said Darrah. "And that's the third strike. You're
out."</p>

<p>"Maybe I am and maybe I ain't," growled Eric Bull. He swung
toward Hardesty. "You've said anything to him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Hardesty, plainly angered. "Go on back to your own
joint and take your crew also."</p>

<p>"When I get damned good and ready," stated Bull, shaking his
shoulders. "I'm holding a hand in this game."</p>

<p>"Nobody's dealt me anything yet," put in Darrah. "When you
fellows get finished with the dog fight let me know. Anything to
eat around here?"</p>

<p>Hardesty nodded toward the rear. "We dragged in a steer. Help
yourself."</p>

<p>Darrah tramped the width of the room, pushed a swinging door
ahead of him and entered a kitchen. Circle Arrow had dumped its
chuck wagon outfit here, fired up the ancient range, and made
some shift at cooking, A camp coffee pot gurgled on the stove and
there was a cold side of beef sitting on a nearby table. Darrah
got a cup and poured himself a drink. He carved off a piece of
the beef. Leaning against the table he ate this sketchy snack
with a show of abstraction. Men were talking in the lobby,
talking straight from the shoulder; but he heard none of it plain
enough. Words rose and fell in a bickering, argumentative
disharmony. The front door rattled and cold streamers of air slid
into the kitchen. Somebody else tramped noisily over the lobby
floor. The talk stopped for a little while, then went on again,
more surly and acrid than before. Darrah poured himself another
tin of coffee and felt grateful for its scalding strength.</p>

<p>"These outfits," he thought, "never did get along and never
will. Right now they got to be neighbors and they don't like it.
But what was that hint Bull dropped about Hardesty tellin' me
something?"</p>

<p>Water dripped along his leg. Looking down he saw that his coat
pocket was half filled with slush and he reached in to draw out
the woman's gauntlet. Unthinkingly, he had stuffed it there.</p>

<p>"Good Lord," he muttered, "here's something else to think
about." And putting aside the tin cup he wrung the glove free of
the melting snow. Going over to the stove, he lifted a lid so
that the firelight would shine up; and he slowly turned back the
rim of the glove. But there was no name on it&mdash;and no such
initialing as a man might make to identify his property. Darrah's
scowl of interest deepened.</p>

<p>"Nothing to be done about it," he said very quietly. "If she's
out there she's dead. But supposin' she ain't out there. Where
else would she be?"</p>

<p>He folded the glove, put it back in his pocket. The attentive
speculation of his eyes brightened. And he repeated to himself,
"Where would she be?" It was a worrying weight that deadlocked
his mind. He held the puzzle; one or more of these twenty-odd men
in Sumpter Gulch ought to know the answer to that puzzle. All of
them had been out along the ridges and in the flats during the
preceding three days. That woman would have been sighted&mdash;it
was only logical that she had been seen somewhere by the roving
outfits. This being the case it was up to him to reveal the story
of the glove.</p>

<p>Yet a growing caution stayed the half-formed decision.
Thinking over the situation with a deeper, harder concentration,
he began to perceive that something more than average antagonism
rode the parties now caught in Sumpter. The affair had odd
angles; such small bits of information and evidence as he had
gathered made a disjointed pattern. "Something bothers 'em," he
muttered, more and more convinced. His auspicious thoughts kept
returning to the queries Hardesty and Bull had thrown at him.
Both men had wanted the same information; both of them, brushing
aside lesser talk, had tried to dig specific facts out of him.
What was it they were so anxious to discover?</p>

<p>He replaced the stove lid, stood idle a moment; trying to form
the shapeless warning all this while moving through his head.
Hardesty's voice struck above the pounding and slatting of the
storm. "Darrah&mdash;come in here!"</p>

<p>Tom Darrah suddenly shook his head. "The less said the better,
for a little while longer," he decided silently. Then he went
back to the lobby.</p>

<p>He saw immediately that the crowd had grown. Hardesty's Circle
Arrow people maintained their positions nearest the fire. Along a
side wall the Lazy JT hands had consciously grouped themselves
behind the blocky figure of Eric Bull. But Darrah gave these two
parties only a half glance. For Nig Sommers had arrived with his
men and it was toward these seven unsavory characters Darrah bent
his freshened interest. They were in a farther corner of the
room, thus completing the watchful, trustless triangular grouping
of outfits. Born in this country, Darrah knew all about those
seven renegades and his own reaction was a slow constriction of
nerve and muscle; the record of Sommers and his riders was
unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Where you been?" challenged Sommers in a queer, chest-less
voice. The man stood on the balls of his feet, swayed a little
forward as if ready for the unexpected. He was tall, taller than
any other in the room. But the rest of his body didn't match its
height; awkward arms hung abnormally long beside the gaunt and
shackling frame, and his head, atop a lank neck, was small and
forward sloping. Sun and wind had darkened him, yet beneath the
surface coloring was the added suggestion of a racial
swarthiness. Two small eyes lay in recessed sockets; an
insufficient chin retreated below a slack mouth which in turn
seemed inadequate for the long and flattened nose that pointed
and dominated the whole evil-arranged face. The eyes, of a muddy
coloring, had the intent fixity common to a predatory animal
startled by some odd sound.</p>

<p>"I've spread my yarn twice," said Darrah calmly. "And I don't
think it's necessary to do so again. Leastwise not to a brush
jumper such as you, Nig."</p>

<p>Nig Sommers' mouth went ugly. "Sing low, Darrah. You'll say
and you'll do just what this crowd decides is best."</p>

<p>"For a man of no known reputation whatsoever," said Darrah,
"you're throwin' a lot of weight. Go to hell."</p>

<p>Lonzo Hardesty turned on Nig Sommers, explaining with a quick
patience. "He came from The Pass five days ago, got hung up in
one of the Circle Arrow cabins and left it this morning, meaning
to run for Arrowhead. Storm caught him on the flats. That's all,
Nig."</p>

<p>Tom Darrah's mind closed down on this little scene with a
cold, hard interest. Here was Lonzo Hardesty, an honest man
working for an honest outfit&mdash;obviously trying to keep Nig
Sommers in good humor. It wasn't like Hardesty. And Hardesty
himself must have realized the strangeness of his explanation for
he fell silent and stared from Eric Bull to Tom Darrah morosely,
defiantly.</p>

<p>"So that's that," grunted Bull, laconic and a little
skeptical.</p>

<p>"Darrah," said Nig Somers, "what do you know?"</p>

<p>"I know something's rotten around here and I'm gettin' tired
of all this palaver."</p>

<p>Eric Bull addressed the room in general. "He might've been in
it."</p>

<p>Heavy silence covered the crowd and Darrah felt the whole
weight of those absorbed, calculating glances. Anger began to
trickle through him and he framed a reply in his head. The glove,
he felt, had a share of this mystery. He was glad he had said
nothing about it; and he had no intention now of telling, not
until he knew more. "You can all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell him Eric," said Lonzo Hardesty.</p>

<p>"Darrah," said Eric Bull, pushing his chin forward, "Lazy JT
lost a boss out there in the snow. Somebody shot him a few hours
after the blizzard first started&mdash;three days back. Somebody
killed old Lewes DeSpain&mdash;see? That fellow is right here in
this room. Couldn't have been nobody else. We're the only ones
that rode the country. And, by God, we don't leave Sumpter Gulch
till we find out who it was!"</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The silence returned, more oppressive than before. The other
men made a ring around him, watching him as if they sought to pry
out the thoughts running through his head. Utterly impassive, he
stared back, giving them no satisfaction. And he spoke dryly to
Eric Bull. "I can't cry. Lewes DeSpain deserved shootin' twenty
years ago."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" grunted Eric Bull. "Well, that ain't the point."</p>

<p>"What is the point, Eric?"</p>

<p>"JT," said Bull, "is going to find out who killed its boss.
Make no mistake on that point."</p>

<p>"Let the sheriff do that, if he thinks it necessary," advised
Darrah, candidly. "The man's well dead. Nobody grieves. You ain't
grievin' are you?"</p>

<p>Eric Bull's chin and nose came nearer together. "That's the
trouble. If we don't find out who got him the blame will be put
on the JT outfit. I don't propose to ride this country with that
suspicion hangin' to me."</p>

<p>"Where'd you put his body?''</p>

<p>"Left it. Goin' to be left as is, till the sheriff can be got.
Nobody is goin' to touch him. And nobody is goin' to leave
Sumpter till we get the true dope."</p>

<p>"Suits me," said Darrah. "But you're wastin' your time
nevertheless. DeSpain was a born crook. He had notches on his own
gun and he never said a fair word for a livin' soul. You worked
for a man, Eric, that didn't own a friend in three hundred square
miles. Why, anybody in this room had reason enough to shoot
him."</p>

<p>"One man in this room did," interrupted Bull, doggedly. "I
propose to find out who."</p>

<p>"Might've did it yourself," said Darrah. "He laid his tongue
on you plenty." Then his attention centered on Eric Bull's
increasingly flushed face. "And, by the way, who would get the
ranch if DeSpain shuffled off? He had no relatives. Be the man
who could handle it, who knew it. Might be you, Eric."</p>

<p>"Darrah," rasped the JT foreman, "that's enough outta
you!"</p>

<p>"Or it might be Lonzo," went on Darrah evenly. "Circle Arrow
always did fight DeSpain."</p>

<p>Hardesty never said a word, only showed an increase of
suppressed anger. Nig Sommers laughed ironically. "That ain't so
far from the truth either."</p>

<p>"Yes?" put in Darrah, swinging toward the outlaw. "Well, what
prevents you from bein' the killer? It's right down your
alley."</p>

<p>"By God," yelled Sommers, of a sudden black, "I won't take
that from you!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute&mdash;wait a minute," pleaded Lonzo Hardesty.
"We've threshed this out before. Might as well do it again,
seeing Darrah's come into the business. All right. Tonight after
supper. It's damned near noon now."</p>

<p>Said Bull suspiciously, "You act funny to me, Lonzo. You keep
wantin' to stall along."</p>

<p>"Tonight," repeated Hardesty.</p>

<p>"Nobody is goin' to pin this scrape on me," threatened Nig
Sommers. "I'll be around on the dot." Motioning his men to
follow, he tramped out of the lobby. Eric Bull teetered on his
heels, glumly thoughtful. Then he said, "All right," and followed
the retreating Sommers. The JT crew milled into the storm.
Somebody slammed the door, leaving Darrah alone with the Circle
Arrow bunch.</p>

<p>"Before this is over with," he drawled, "you'll all wish you'd
taken my advice."</p>

<p>"I'd take it now," muttered Hardesty, "if it was my say-so.
Pete, get some grub fixed up."</p>

<p>Darrah shot a sharp question at Hardesty. "What are you afraid
of, man?"</p>

<p>Hardesty actually flinched. He opened his mouth to answer,
then closed it with a quick pressure of his lips&mdash;sulky
stubbornness showing on the strained face. One of the other
Circle Arrow hands said to Darrah, "What makes you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Tansy," ordered Hardesty.</p>

<p>Darrah shrugged his shoulders. "You boys have got a bad case
of the jumps," he observed and went into the kitchen. Rummaging
around, he found a five-gallon oil can and filled it with snow
beyond the back door. Melting it on the stove, he trudged through
the lobby and out to the street. Even in that short crossing the
curdling blast of the storm left him shaken and miserable; it
went through clothing and flesh and left an ache all along his
bones, and when he got inside the stable he was shivering as from
the ague. Pausing to adjust his vision for the semi-darkness, he
heard a low and hurried voice stop in the middle of a word. Feet
shifted. Two blurred figures moved apart and Eric Bull's blunt,
challenging words struck at him.</p>

<p>"What the hell you doin' here?"</p>

<p>"You've got eyes," said Darrah dryly. The other man never
spoke&mdash;seemed, in fact, to want anonymity for himself. But
Darrah recognized the long, ungainly frame of Nig Sommers even in
the obscure shadows. Going on, he let his pony drink the can dry.
Eric Bull spoke to Sommers with an exaggerated force, "There
ain't but a little straw and it's moldy. We'll split it among the
brutes, even." Darrah took his tarp roll over his shoulder and
walked into the hurling tempest again.</p>

<p>"Cookin' up somethin'," he said to himself, fighting through
the drifts. "Maybe Lonzo Hardesty's got a reason to be afraid. I
wish I knew what it was." Half running down the hotel porch, he
wrenched the door open and stumbled through. The room was
empty&mdash;all the hands moving around the kitchen and talking
casually; but Darrah's eyes rose and caught one man turning out
of sight on the second-story landing of the stairs. The fellow
stared down and deliberately backed beyond view, though not quite
quick enough to hide the plate of food he held in his hands.
Lonzo Hardesty put his head through the kitchen doorway. "Come
and get your chuck."</p>

<p>"Already had my snack," said Darrah. Riveted to the middle of
the room, he listened to the footsteps of the Circle Arrow
puncher above. The man obviously was trying to walk softly, but
each loose board of the warped hall betrayed him as he moved on
to the left end of the building and halted. A door's rusty hinges
shrieked; silence held the upper quarters for a moment. Then the
puncher started back. Darrah deliberately drew the interest out
of his face and strode to a chair by the fireplace. When the
Circle Arrow hand came down the stairs Darrah was sitting on the
small of his back, feet cocked against another chair, eyes shut.
The hand dallied a moment in the room, then went to the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Darrah remained motionless for perhaps a minute, thinking,
"More mystery&mdash;who's the invalid that needs grub brought to
him?" Opening his eyes, he found the kitchen door closed and
thereafter he rose abruptly, crossed the room and took the stairs
two steps at a time. Rounding into the upper hall, he halted
briefly to orient himself and to recollect which way the Circle
Arrow hand had gone. There were, he saw, four doors on either
side of the hall's left wing. All of them closed. Yet,
irresolutely considering this, he picked up the tapping sound of
a shoe&mdash;a sort of restless rhythm made by somebody beyond
the third door on the right hand series of rooms. Gently
advancing to that door, he placed his ear against it and got the
sound more distinctly. There was no longer any doubt. He thought
slowly, "May be lettin' myself in for something, but it will be
an answer to one question anyhow." Then he turned the knob and
pushed himself into the bedroom.</p>

<p>A woman&mdash;a girl, rather&mdash;sat up to a small table in
the center of the room eating the meal brought her by the Circle
Arrow puncher. She was swathed in blankets from waist to foot and
a man's leather jacket cloaked her small, square shoulders. For
the briefest of moments she smiled at Darrah and her head, massed
with glowing copper hair, nodded slightly. But that smile fled
when second sight found a man she had never before seen. Her chin
lifted sharply and a quick breath fell out of her. "Who are you?"
she said peremptorily.</p>

<p>It took Darrah completely aback. Even though some faint hint
of such a situation as this had been in one small corner of his
head it took him momentarily off his guard and he only stood and
stared, oddly thinking that he had never met her before and that
she made a striking, satisfying picture.</p>

<p>"You're not one of Lonzo Hardesty's men?" she said, alert and
more poised now.</p>

<p>"No. My name's Darrah."</p>

<p>"Tom Darrah?"</p>

<p>"How would you know about that?" asked Darrah, curious.</p>

<p>"I have heard of you," said the girl. It seemed to him she sat
more relaxed and relieved. In any event the quite dark eyes lost
part of their alertness and the angles at each lip corner
dissolved. Her face was symmetrical, finely modeled; a cool
reliance lay on it and a sort of thoughtful sobriety.</p>

<p>"I thought," pondered Darrah, "I knew everybody in this
country."</p>

<p>"I'm new. I came out here four months ago to prove up a
homestead at the foot of the ridge&mdash;where Hondo creek comes
into the flats."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl, and added, "My name is Anita
Goodridge."</p>

<p>"What could you do, alone?" asked Darrah, in a manner that
more or less answered the question.</p>

<p>"Does it matter?" parried the girl. "I have been happy, which
is more than I could say four months ago."</p>

<p>Below, in the lobby Lonzo Hardesty's voice rapped out an
impatient, "Darrah&mdash;where are you?" Darrah shifted, knowing
the showdown wasn't far off. He reached into his pocket and
pulled out the gauntlet, holding it toward her.</p>

<p>"Is this yours?"</p>

<p>Her face changed again. Fear came distinctly into it, the
rose-colored cheeks whitened. She made a gesture toward the
gauntlet and then laced both hands together until the knuckles
turned pale. "Yes," she whispered. "Where&mdash;where did you
find it?"</p>

<p>Hardesty shouted, "Darrah!" And then he started up the stairs
riotously. Darrah laid the gauntlet in the girl's lap, saying
quickly, "Never mind. Get it out of sight."</p>

<p>She whipped the gauntlet under the fold of blankets and
somehow her eyes began to show warmth. "That's the kind of a
man," she said swiftly, "I heard you were!
Darrah&mdash;please&mdash;stay around here if you can! I'm not
sure&mdash;not sure of anybody!"</p>

<p>Darrah felt that she had something more on her mind. But there
was no time for it. Lonzo Hardesty flung himself along the hall,
cursing; and he lunged through the bedroom doorway and spat out a
brittle order. "Stand fast! Damn you&mdash;you're a born meddler,
Darrah! Who told you to come up here?"</p>

<p>"Easy, easy," warned Darrah, slowly pivoting to face Hardesty.
He found himself covered and, coolly silent, he wondered what
profound disturbance could so put this Circle Arrow ridingboss
completely out of character. Hardesty had always been an even-
styled man, a friend of a rather close sort. But the gun was
risen and aimed and Hardesty's slim cheeks were haggard with the
combination of rage and worry.</p>

<p>"So this is what troubled you?" asked Darrah.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd lost your way out in the Easter!" cried
Hardesty. Other men were climbing the stairs and coming down the
hall. The bedroom doorway was presently blocked. Circle Arrow
looked forebodingly in and one man said, "You want help on this,
Lonzo?"</p>

<p>"I'll handle it all right," grated Hardesty. "I ought to've
known better. You never let well enough alone, Tom. Always pryin'
around and askin' fool questions. Well, this time is just where
you forget what you discovered and keep your damned mouth
shut!"</p>

<p>Darrah grinned a little, which didn't help Hardesty's temper.
"This is a mighty cold place," Darrah observed, "to put a lady.
Ain't there any stoves up here?"</p>

<p>"No," grunted Hardesty. "And never mind. Come back out of
here."</p>

<p>"Wait a second," argued Darrah. He turned to the girl. "How
long have you been in Sumpter?"</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of the storm. Three days."</p>

<p>"You came with these men?"</p>

<p>"They&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be still," snapped Hardesty. "Look here, Anita, you got no
license to put any trust in him. If there's talkin' to be done,
I'll do it. Come on, Darrah."</p>

<p>Darrah shrugged his shoulders and went out of the room. The
other Circle Arrow hands followed him down to the lobby, but
Hardesty stayed behind for quite a while. Darrah took a seat by
the fire, closing his eyes and listening to the beating fury of
the wind outside. Only a little past noon, the light of the day
was almost gone. The windows were gray rectangles and the fire on
the hearth made it seem like actual night. Hardesty's words
arrived from the upper hall rather clearly, followed by a quick,
emphatic exclamation on the part of the girl. A door slammed. The
foreman descended and walked to the fireplace. When Darrah opened
his eyes he found Hardesty watching him with scowling
intensity.</p>

<p>"I suppose we better iron this out," grunted Hardesty. "But I
don't like it. Not even if it's you. Why didn't you keep your
confounded nose clear of this?"</p>

<p>"Usually," drawled Darrah, "you're a pretty even and
substantial citizen, Lonzo. Right now you don't show a lick of
sense. Why be afraid of me?"</p>

<p>"I've handled this mess so far," said Hardesty, "and I'll
continue to handle it. I don't trust anybody. If you want to know
what I'm afraid of, I'll tell you. It's you. You're always
willing to gamble. You take too many risks. I don't play cards
that way. So I'm telling you plain. I'll run this show."</p>

<p>"Now that that's settled," said Darrah, "go ahead."</p>

<p>Hardesty stared at the fire grimly, collecting his thoughts.
"As a matter of fact, Tom, the girl came here with us. We were
coming off the ridge just as the Easter began to rip. We passed
her shanty. She was pretty near out of grub and I told her she
better come along to Arrowhead and stay till the worst of it was
over. So she did. We got this far."</p>

<p>"You lie, Lonzo," was Darrah's cool retort. "I don't know
whether Circle Arrow or the girl got to Sumpter first&mdash;but
you didn't come together."</p>

<p>Hardesty didn't answer, but Darrah saw something in the man's
eyes he never had seen before. It was an emotion pretty close to
the edge of homicidal violence. Even the rest of the Circle Arrow
crew caught that. And one of them said, "Easy, Lonzo. Tom
Darrah's straight. Don't be a dummy."</p>

<p>"All right," growled Hardesty. "The girl was here first. We
came along about a half hour after that. DeSpain's men racked up
just a little later&mdash;tellin' us DeSpain was dead. Nig
Sommers didn't show till that night."</p>

<p>"You're thinking to protect the girl," mused Darrah. "What
makes you think she did it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know who did it," Hardesty rapped out. "And I don't
care. But I had her hide when Eric Bull and his bunch hove in.
That DeSpain outfit is made up of tough nuts. It's the only kind
DeSpain hired&mdash;the only kind that'd work for him. Well, I
don't propose to let them bear down on the girl. Figure it out
for yourself. What would they think if they saw her here?
Why&mdash;that something damned funny caused it."</p>

<p>"Anything else?" suggested Darrah quietly.</p>

<p>Hardesty's glance narrowed on Darrah. Points of odd and
glinting light showed in his eyes. "Yeah," he muttered. "She
ain't safe. Never mind the murder for a minute. Disregardin'
that, she ain't safe. I said DeSpain's outfit was tough. Nig
Sommers is a wolf and so are his men. Well?"</p>

<p>"I never knew a decent woman in this country who was ever
insulted."</p>

<p>"How would they know she was decent?" muttered Hardesty.
"There's been talk about her livin' up on the ridge alone. Also,
she's with us. If they find that out they'll draw some wrong
conclusions. I tell you straight, Tom, I ain't so much afraid of
their pinnin' the killin' on her as I am of the other thing."</p>

<p>"When you found her here," questioned Darrah, "did she tell
you what she'd been doing out in the blizzard?"</p>

<p>"I didn't ask," was Hardesty's instant response. "And I don't
want to know."</p>

<p>"Good boy," mused Darrah. He got out his tobacco and rolled a
smoke, face scowling over the job. He struck a match, eyes hard
and bright. "I can see something else here pretty plain."</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded Hardesty, displaying a trace of
belligerence. Noting the manner, Darrah reflected that this
Circle Arrow foreman seemed afraid of some fact so far hidden;
that the man was braced for a further revelation. He put the
thought in the back of his head, meanwhile drawling on.</p>

<p>"If Bull and Sommers decide to play against you, they've got
you hipped. Here's nine men. Ten, includin' me. But Lazy JT and
the Sommers' riders count up about sixteen guns."</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose I've thought of that?" said Hardesty,
morose at once.</p>

<p>"Yeah? Why did you think of it? What have they got in common
against you?"</p>

<p>But Hardesty didn't answer. He swung away, restless and
troubled. One of the hands dragged another log from the kitchen
and pitched it on the fire. The foreman's restlessness seemed to
communicate itself to the others, for a small argument arose
concerning the horses and presently five of the hands left the
lobby, bound for the stable. Darrah's mind worked on, endlessly
involved with this tangle of fact and guess and suspicion.
Sprawled comfortably in his chair, the heat relaxed him and
thinking turned harder; and presently he lifted himself abruptly
and found he had been sleeping. When he looked at his watch he
found it was beyond four. The windows were black and the wind was
cutting the eaves of the house with an increased roar and report.
Somewhat ashamed of himself he went to the kitchen, located the
bucket and brought it back to the lobby where he scraped half a
dozen loose stones out of the fire's bed. In the bucket they made
a decent heat; and with his improvised stove he started up the
stairs. Hardesty's challenge immediately caught him.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;where you going?"</p>

<p>"If you're afraid I'll hear something I shouldn't, come
along," grunted Darrah.</p>

<p>Hardesty started for the stairs, but a change of mind turned
him back a moment later. He said roughly, "Oh, all right." Darrah
went on, cruised the hall and tapped lightly on the door. He
heard the girl's voice, very small and shaky, call him in.</p>

<p>When he entered, he had some difficulty in seeing
her&mdash;the place was that dark. And it was bitterly cold,
draughts of wind knifing through the warped boards. She moved
toward him, blankets about her shoulders. "Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Me," said Darrah. "Sit in the chair."</p>

<p>"I don't think I can stand this much longer," said the
girl.</p>

<p>"You won't have to," promised Darrah. "Sit down. Now put your
feet beside this bucket. Blanket around it. That'll keep the heat
in."</p>

<p>He stood back while she arranged herself; and he heard her
sigh of relief&mdash;which further shamed him. "I had forgotten,"
she whispered, "that men were thoughtful. Thank you, Darrah."</p>

<p>"Men are no better than they ought to be," said Darrah.
"That's why you're here."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>Darrah said gently, "I know nothing. But I can guess."</p>

<p>"Do you want to know about that glove?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You're the first man," she said rather bitterly, "who hasn't
wanted to take advantage of me. Anybody else would be holding
that glove over me like a club."</p>

<p>"Don't answer this if you'd rather not. You left your cabin
alone and in a hurry&mdash;because you were scared out of
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A man rode along&mdash;and you had to run from him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated the girl, scarcely audible.</p>

<p>"It was Lewes DeSpain?"</p>

<p>She didn't answer directly but he saw her head slowly incline.
Darrah said irritably, "Lewes DeSpain was noted for that. Had he
ever bothered you before?"</p>

<p>"Once. I drove him away with a gun. This time the gun wasn't
handy. But my horse was saddled in the shed&mdash;so I got free
and rode off. He&mdash;he followed me part of the way but by then
the storm was so bad he lost sight of me within a hundred yards.
There we were, wandering around in it. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;never mind," interrupted Darrah. "You didn't kill
him."</p>

<p>He was then to see a different side of the girl. She
straightened in the chair, saying swiftly, energetically. "I
might have, Darrah! I am capable of killing a man like that! I
have known people of his sort before and I hate them!"</p>

<p>Darrah took another line of attack. "Anyhow, you got to
Sumpter. You were here first. Then the Circle Arrow bunch drove
in and Lonzo Hardesty found you. Did he know about it?"</p>

<p>"No. At least I told him nothing."</p>

<p>Darrah straightened. "Then how was it he hid you when JT came
along?"</p>

<p>"He said he was afraid of my being seen by the JT crew. He
said they were tough."</p>

<p>But Darrah, staring through the dark, shook his head as
another thought occurred to him. It was odd that Hardesty should
hide the girl on that excuse alone. It seemed insufficient; it
seemed only a surface excuse to cover a deeper fear. "He knows
you pretty well&mdash;he's seen you quite a lot?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Fact is, the man is in love with you."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Darrah paused, then went on slowly, quietly. "Don't answer
this if it sounds inquisitive to you. Do you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No!" said the girl emphatically. "I don't feel that way
toward him at all! I know he is your friend&mdash;he has told me
so. But&mdash;when you go downstairs&mdash;look more carefully at
him. Look at his eyes."</p>

<p>"I'll run along," said Darrah.</p>

<p>"Come here," said the girl. And when Darrah moved nearer she
took his hand and held it tightly a moment. "I have heard so much
about you from different people that I got to dislike you. You
seemed too sure of yourself&mdash;you got into fights and out of
them as if you never doubted your S BLIZZARD CAMP 11 strength. I
guess I have been a man-hater, Darrah&mdash;with some reason.
But&mdash;but I don't feel that way about you now. Other people
have leaned on you for help. I'm doing it now. Someday, when this
is over, I'll try to pay you back."</p>

<p>"I'll be riding your part of the ridge more frequent," drawled
Darrah, and went out. When he descended to the lobby all the
Circle Arrow crew stood by the fire, watching him with a studied
attentiveness. Hardesty's cheeks were smoothed out, consciously
wiped clear of emotion. But Darrah thought of the girl's warning
and he looked at Hardesty's eyes; they held, he saw, a kind of
expectancy. The man was bracing himself for trouble, for bad
news, for something he thought was to break.</p>

<p>"She was blamed near froze," he said shortly. "Why in thunder
didn't you think of that?"</p>

<p>Hardesty shrugged his shoulders, seeming relieved. Darrah
walked toward the kitchen, calling over his shoulder. "Come here
a second, Lonzo." And when Hardesty followed through the door and
faced Darrah alone he was obviously on guard again, taut as a
fiddle string.</p>

<p>"You're sold on her, ain't you?" inquired Darrah.</p>

<p>"That's none of your damned business!" snapped Hardesty,
glowering. "I told you, Tom, to quit pryin'. If you
don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>Hardesty pointed a finger, jerking it downward with each slow
word. "I'm playin' this game and will continue to do so. Don't
butt in. You're in no shape to interfere. Get what I mean?
Between Bull and Sommers and me, you're mighty small potatoes. If
you get too curious we might get together and put the load on
you. Now remember that."</p>

<p>"So?" said Darrah, tonelessly. "That's different some
more."</p>

<p>"How different?" challenged Hardesty, alert and hard.</p>

<p>"Never mind."</p>

<p>Hardesty started to speak. But the lobby door opened, letting
in the rush and riot of the storm. Then it slammed and men
stamped across the floor toward the fire. Both Hardesty and
Darrah left the kitchen&mdash;to find Nig Sommers and Eric Bull
waiting for them. At that moment Darrah realized the situation
had changed&mdash;for the worse. As clearly as if they had
announced it, Darrah saw they had made an agreement between
themselves and were now about to put it into effect.</p>

<p>"Let's get down to cases," said Eric Bull, pushing his jaw
forward.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It was again Lonzo Hardesty who showed reluctance. He said
irritably, "I thought we'd set the time for after eatin'."</p>

<p>"You're stallin'," accused Bull.</p>

<p>"We'll get no further than we were before," grunted Hardesty.
"I'll tell you&mdash;we'd be blamed wise to agree to a closed-
mouth policy on this and let it go as such. If we say nothing the
sheriff won't find out anything."</p>

<p>Bull shook his head. "Won't do. I ain't going to be tarred
with this murder. I want it pinned on the proper man."</p>

<p>Nig Sommers' black and lined cheeks showed a sullen amusement.
"Supposin' we did agree to say nothin'. It wouldn't last.
Somebody'd squall."</p>

<p>"If anybody did, it'd be you," rapped out Hardesty.</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Sommers, cynical to the extreme.</p>

<p>"All right then," said Hardesty, "let 'er flicker." Standing
idle and watchful, Darrah saw that Bull and Sommers had made up a
common attack. Bull slid a short glance at the outlaw and then
braced himself in front of Hardesty. "Just where were you when
the shootin' happened&mdash;that's what ain't quite clear to
us."</p>

<p>Darrah fully expected Lonzo Hardesty to flare up and make a
scene. Surprisingly, Hardesty did not. He returned Eric Bull's
close glance and drew a long breath. "I've told you already. We
were working up along the foot of the low ridge. I saw the Easter
coming and decided to split the crew so that we could comb the
timber and drive such scattered stock as we could find on over to
Medill's Pocket where we'd put up a thirty-ton stack of meadow
hay. I took the chuck wagon myself and drove across the flats,
along the edge of the ridge. Was my intention to leave the wagon
here in Sumpter and go back to the pocket. I did. But before I
could reach Medill's pocket the blizzard busted down. I had a
hell of a time gettin' the men together. We came here. That's
all."</p>

<p>"All?" grunted Bull.</p>

<p>"No-o, not exactly," amended Hardesty. "I was out there alone,
downwind from the lone pine when I heard the shot. Thought it was
one of the men signaling so I answered. Looked around and
couldn't see a damned thing more than fifty feet ahead of me. So
I turned for the timber, got the men and paid no further heed to
the shot. That's all I know."</p>

<p>"But you was alone when you heard the shot," pointed out Eric
Bull. "You admit that much. You was inside of a hundred yards of
Lewes DeSpain when he was killed."</p>

<p>"What of it?" said Hardesty. "I've laid my cards on the table.
I'm clear."</p>

<p>Darrah broke in, speaking to Bull. "Where were you, now that
we're on the subject?"</p>

<p>Eric Bull answered readily, as if his story were pat and
perfect. "JT crew happened to be on top of the second ridge,
travelin' south. Lewes DeSpain pulled away from the outfit and
said he'd meet us at Diamond Bar Gulley."</p>

<p>"Where was he headed for?" questioned Darrah.</p>

<p>Eric Bull hesitated a moment and stared at Darrah. "He went to
that Goodridge girl's cabin. Or he said he was goin' there. When
we got to the gulley he wasn't in sight. By that time it was
snowin' to beat hell. So we come back along the flats and went up
to the girl's place. Nobody there. We came back. Stumbled mostly
by accident onto DeSpain. He was layin' on top of the snow and he
hadn't quit breathin' more'n ten minutes."</p>

<p>"You heard the shot?" asked Darrah.</p>

<p>"In all that wind? No."</p>

<p>"But you were close enough to the spot to find him," said
Darrah.</p>

<p>"I said it was pure accident that we did," grunted Bull.</p>

<p>"Kind of a well-timed accident, wasn't it?" said Darrah
evenly.</p>

<p>"Don't mean a thing," countered Bull. "Except for a quarter
hour I was with my outfit every bit of the time."</p>

<p>"Lot could happen in that many minutes," Darrah reflected.
"And it's on record that DeSpain called you a gentleman without a
legal father three weeks ago in Arrowhead."</p>

<p>That went home. It hit this stocky, belligerent Eric Bull
harder than Darrah imagined it would. Bull's florid face
congested with blood and the greenish blue eyes filled with fire.
He lifted one solid arm and shook it at Darrah, shouting, "I
don't want that repeated. I took it from him because he was
drunk. He apologized later and I accepted it. By God, Darrah,
don't let me hear the remark from you again!"</p>

<p>"But it still hurts, doesn't it?" said Darrah softly. "You
didn't forget that cussing."</p>

<p>"If he'd been sober I'd killed him!" cried Bull.</p>

<p>"Yeah? Well, he was sober when he died, Eric. And it wasn't
very dangerous to end a grudge in weather so thick it could be
cut with a knife."</p>

<p>Bull suddenly realized he had said too much and he closed his
mouth so rapidly that his teeth snapped, glowering at Darrah. An
uneasy silence came to the room for a brief while, to be broken
by Nig Sommers' chest-less, dead-flat voice. "I'm the man that's
goin' to be accused right off of doin' it," he said. "But they'll
never make it stick. I was two-three miles away, bringin' my boys
to Sumpter because I knew it was goin' to be pretty tough
weather. I'm plumb clear."</p>

<p>"This isn't your country," Darrah suddenly remarked. "What
were you doing over this side of the ridges anyhow?"</p>

<p>"That's my business," growled Sommers.</p>

<p>Darrah turned on Eric Bull. "For that matter this ain't your
end of the range, either. There's no DeSpain beef anywhere's near
Circle Arrow country. What was you doing in these parts?"</p>

<p>Eric Bull started to speak, but bit off the phrase and pressed
his lips together. It seemed to Darrah that this heavy-bodied man
had thought of some unexpected turn in the talk and was now
craftily puzzling his way around it. He shot a quick,
surreptitious glance at Nig Sommers who instantly looked away.
Definitely a message passed over the space&mdash;and found no
willing receiver. Meanwhile, Hardesty's cheeks turned more and
more care-worn as he stood back and watched. Darrah's mind closed
avariciously around a new-framed thought. He had stumbled into
something.</p>

<p>"We thought there was some DeSpain strays over here," Bull at
last explained.</p>

<p>Darrah threw a fast, metallic question at Nig Sommers.
"Sommers, did you and the DeSpain outfit have a meeting up in the
ridge some time before the storm broke?"</p>

<p>"No," said the outlaw instantly.</p>

<p>But Eric Bull lifted a warning hand. "Now, Nig, we've got to
play it right through. Somebody in my outfit or somebody in your
outfit will squall. Sure, we met. But what of that, Darrah?"</p>

<p>"Another curious accident," drawled Darrah. "Both of your
outfits coming into the same country about the same time. There
might be some unkind comment on that. It might even be guessed
that DeSpain and Sommers made a gentlemen's agreement to join up
and tour the Circle Arrow range for a little Circle Arrow
beef."</p>

<p>Nig Sommers' beady eyes were charged with glittering light and
he had unconsciously thrown his body forward till the weight of
it rested on the balls of his feet. His long arms hung
motionless, almost rigid; and not for an instant did he take his
attention off Darrah. But Bull, oddly enough, accepted Darrah's
suggestion indifferently. He shrugged his big shoulders. "What's
that got to do with Lewes DeSpain bein' killed? If anything it
leaves Nig out of the case. Don't it, Nig?"</p>

<p>Sommers scowled, relaxing a little. And he muttered, "Yeah,"
uncertainly. Nothing could have been clearer to Darrah then than
that Bull's statement had been meant to reassure Sommers, to keep
him from going off half-cocked.</p>

<p>"In fact," said Bull, ironically, "it would leave the little
chore right on Lonzo Hardesty's doorstep. It could be said he
found DeSpain poachin' and promptly knocked him over."</p>

<p>"Justifiably so," said Darrah. "No jury in the West would hold
him for it."</p>

<p>"I ain't interested in that at all," returned Bull. "All I
want is to get the suspicion away from me."</p>

<p>"That helps me, don't it?" said Lonzo Hardesty to Darrah,
sullenly tossing the words into the room.</p>

<p>"A justifiable killin'&mdash;that's the right answer," mused
Bull. "You see it, Lonzo?"</p>

<p>"What are you tryin' to do?" snarled Hardesty. "Push the whole
rotten mess on me? Not by a damned sight! That justifiable
wrinkle don't fool me for a minute!"</p>

<p>Darrah turned from them, walked past the knot of tense Circle
Arrow hands, and faced the fire. He drew out his cigarette
tobacco and rolled a smoke with an utter absorption of mind. This
thing went deeper and deeper. In the beginning it had looked like
the girl. Afterwards Hardesty's own attitude had indicated a
participation in the shooting, for it was clear that he wanted
the girl badly enough to kill any man who troubled her. But this
scene had complicated that logical explanation. Sommers and Bull
each had a sufficiently valid reason for wanting Lewes DeSpain
out of the way&mdash;yet these two men were now, without any
doubt, working together for some common end. And Lewes DeSpain
had had both of them in his confidence. Once more, the reasoning
led him back to Hardesty&mdash;on the entirely different
assumption that Hardesty had found DeSpain stealing Circle Arrow
stock.</p>

<p>Bending to the fire, he got a lighted sliver of wood, thinking
coolly, "That won't do. Hardesty wouldn't be afraid to face any
jury on that score. And he is afraid of something. Also, Bull
seems to have the bulge on him this minute. Why?"</p>

<p>He waved the burning sliver across the tip of his cigarette,
hearing Bull say abruptly, "There's a better answer yet, boys."
And turning around he found Bull pointing at him. Sommers grinned
slyly, nodding.</p>

<p>"Me?" drawled Darrah.</p>

<p>"You," said Bull.</p>

<p>Hardesty looked all around the room, to Bull, to Sommers, to
the Circle Arrow crew&mdash;and lastly to Darrah. He drew a
breath, his whole face changed. "All right. That's the
answer."</p>

<p>"So I killed DeSpain?" grunted Darrah.</p>

<p>"You crossed his trail at the right time," said Bull. "You've
got no witnesses as to your whereabouts."</p>

<p>"It won't stick," Darrah answered calmly. "You know, of
course, it's a plain cock-and-bull story."</p>

<p>"It'll stick if all of us make a case against you," Bull
rapped out. "And we will!"</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute," put in one of the Circle Arrow hands. "I
ain't so sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up," snapped Bull. "You lads will do as you're told!
Don't make any mistake about that. If you don't there's plenty of
holes in the hills to bury you in."</p>

<p>Darrah looked to Hardesty. "You're willing to agree to this
frame-up?"</p>

<p>"It ain't a frame-up," said Hardesty doggedly. Afterwards he
avoided Darrah's glance and stared across the room. Darrah took a
long drag of smoke into his lungs, at last decided on the final
question in his mind. It was not only Bull and Sommers. It was
Bull and Sommers and Hardesty. Somehow, DeSpain had not fitted
into their scheme. He started to turn and speak. But before he
did a voice came clearly down the stairway.</p>

<p>"You men lie. Darrah didn't shoot DeSpain. I know who did it.
I saw it done!"</p>

<p>Every man in the room started, whirled about. Looking up,
Darrah saw the girl come slowly to the bottom of the stairs and
face the crowd. Of a sudden the silence turned heavy and
oppressive.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was strange. Of all those men in the deceitridden room Nig
Sommers spoke first. Darrah saw him straighten, saw actual relief
cross the dark, trustless visage; saw even a shadow of a grin
come along the thin lips.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" called Sommers.</p>

<p>But he no more had got it out of his mouth than Hardesty
started toward the girl with a lifted arm; and at the same moment
Eric Bull said sharply, "Wait a minute! Hold, on, here! I want to
know how you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the girl, entirely calm and confident.
"I'll say who it was when the sheriff comes."</p>

<p>Eric Bull went to pieces before Darrah's attentive eyes.
"Hardesty!" yelled the JT foreman. "Hardesty, you been holdin'
this trick up your sleeve!"</p>

<p>Hardesty checked himself, turned on Bull with plain puzzlement
showing. He muttered, "What in hell are you talkin' about?"</p>

<p>But Eric Bull, crimson from temple to neck, strode backward
across the room, toward the lobby door. "You'll never get away
with it!" he yelled. "By God, you never will!" And with that
announcement ringing throughout the room he disappeared into the
storm-blasted street. The slamming of the door recalled Nig
Sommers from a long study. He looked around him, half startled;
and then followed Eric Bull as rapidly as his long legs would
take him.</p>

<p>Darrah moved away from the fire, all at once warned. "Go
back," he told the girl. "Go back up. This room will be full of
smoke in five minutes."</p>

<p>She hesitated, but he shook his head so quickly that she
finally turned and ran up, out of sight. Darrah swung, pointed to
the one man in that Circle Arrow crew who had made any sort of
protest during the recent scene. "You&mdash;I want you to go to
the landing up there and see that nobody gets to her. You hear?
Nobody."</p>

<p>"Done," said the fellow and went for the stairs.</p>

<p>Hardesty, meanwhile, had neither moved nor spoken. Darrah
thought he had never seen a face so full of trouble and
uncertainty and fear. But there was no time now to dally and he
threw his hard command at the Circle Arrow foreman. "Blow out
these lamps. Get away from the fire. Spread around. You'll have
both those outfits on top of your neck right away."</p>

<p>"But I don't see&mdash;" muttered Hardesty. "I don't see what
Eric's so worried&mdash;"</p>

<p>Darrah ignored him and motioned to the rest of the crew; and
when those men got into motion, spreading along the walls,
turning down the lamps, he knew that his long doubt of them was
groundless. They were straight. Whatever part Hardesty
played&mdash;they themselves were straight. Enormously relieved
he ran to a corner of the room, seized a rifle standing there,
and plunged on to the front door. When he opened it the wind
struck him savagely and he had to brace his legs and push himself
to the porch. Looking into the mealy smother toward the eastern
end of the camp, he saw lights glimmering out of the saloon
windows yonder. A file of men was at that moment coming up from
the farther darkness and going into that saloon; and he thought
he recognized Nig Sommers' angular body at the head of the party.
He plunged to his armpits in the drifts, slogged across the
street and entered the stable. There he turned about and posted
himself.</p>

<p>This strange game was about to be played out&mdash;the
uncertain end darkly suggested itself. Waiting there in the
almost unendurable cold with a disciplined patience, Darrah knew
that Sommers and Bull would attack Circle Arrow for no other
reason than to get Lonzo Hardesty. Clearly as if it were written,
Darrah realized this was the falling out of thieves who dared not
trust one another&mdash;the ancient and inevitable disagreement
of the lawless. And as a broken line of men came from the saloon
and ducked forward toward the hotel, Darrah lifted the rifle and
trained it with the clear realization that he was not fighting
for Lonzo Hardesty, but for the girl, for the honest Circle Arrow
crew and for himself. His first shot's echo whipped back along
the gun barrel, struck him in the face and was carried off by the
hurling Easter. As poor as the visibility was, he saw one of the
advancing party stagger aside, turn and grope for the saloon.</p>

<p>They had not found him yet and he placed two more bullets with
a grim, implacable thoughtfulness. They had no mercy in
them&mdash;and deserved none. One man pitched over. The others
recoiled, flattening against the building wall. He was spotted
then. A dimming crash of guns fled past him on the wings of the
wind and one chance slug hit the stable above his head. He
answered coolly, swinging the rifle from point to point. One
rasping yell raced by. The group broke, retreated, losing shape
and definiteness. The saloon door opened and on that rectangle of
light he pinned his last shot as the men stumbled through it.</p>

<p>But one of the party&mdash;he thought again that it was Nig
Sommers&mdash;remained in sight, firing at random with his
revolver and shaking his free fist. About the same time another
figure ploughed across the drifts from some obscure angle of the
camp, passed Sommers and vanished in an alley adjoining the
hotel. Sommers instantly wheeled and ran for the saloon's
shelter.</p>

<p>This much of it was over. Wondering about that shift of the
fight, Darrah dropped his empty rifle and drew his revolver. He
beat a trail back across the street, reached the hotel wall and
worked a cautious way to the mouth of the alley. He could see
nothing in that blackly smothered strip. Half of a mind to follow
it down, he heard the sudden roar and reverberation of guns in
the hotel lobby. A confused crying and cursing passed out to the
wailing street and then, as suddenly as the fury developed, it
died. Darrah retreated from the alley, dividing his glance
between the saloon and the hotel porch. He heard a faint sound
and whirled to see a short, stout figure appear on the far side
of the porch and come forward.</p>

<p>The man saw him as well and sprang against the hotel wall. He
challenged Darrah. "Who's that?" And Darrah, his feet trapped in
the hip-high drifts, recognized the blunt voice of Eric Bull.
Knowing even then what was to come, Darrah called strongly:</p>

<p>"Bull, put down&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Eric Bull seemed to identify him at the first sound and he
wheeled again and ran directly forward, his gun rising and
exploding. That crimson-purple muzzle flash bloomed in Darrah's
face and died; and bloomed again. The JT foreman's broad, squat
body leaped at him as Darrah, grown rigid and relentless, tilted
his own weapon and fired at the full, fair target. He heard Bull
grunt. The desperate charge carried Bull on another five yards
and when he fell it was directly at Darrah's feet.</p>

<p>The man was dead. Darrah knew that without looking. Meanwhile
there was a hallooing from behind and he turned to see the saloon
door emitting its gush of light again. A long cry carried Bull's
name forward strenuously; and immediately afterwards Darrah heard
somebody knocking against one of the lobby windows. Placed in
this tricky position, Darrah ran down the porch to the hotel door
and pounded against it, yelling his own name. It opened in his
face. An arm reached out and seized him and a Circle Arrow hand,
silhouetted sharply against the fire light, said: "Get in here,
Tom!"</p>

<p>Darrah rushed through and stopped, eyes touching a figure
sprawled full length on the floor near the leaping blaze. The
Circle Arrow hand muttered briefly, "It's Lonzo. He's passing
out. Somebody shot through a side window and got him."</p>

<p>"Go to the porch," ordered Darrah, "and keep your eyes
peeled." Then he crossed the room and bent over Lonzo Hardesty,
whose half closed eyes stared up, brimming with bitterness and
regret. The Circle Arrow foreman's words were labored and
harsh.</p>

<p>"Bull got me! He said he would&mdash;and he did. Get that dog
for me, Tom!"</p>

<p>"He's lyin' on the porch, dead," said Darrah slowly.</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Hardesty and seemed to draw on some yet untapped
reserve of energy. His eyes widened; he talked with greater
force. "I'm sorry I agreed to put the bug on you. God knows I've
plenty to answer for&mdash;but I was against the wall and didn't
see no other way out. I'll admit it, Tom. I killed Lewes
DeSpain."</p>

<p>"On account of the girl, Lonzo?" asked Darrah.</p>

<p>"I won't lie," muttered Hardesty. "It was only part on her
account. Here's the straight of it. DeSpain hooked up with
Sommers to raid the Circle Arrow range. I met DeSpain a couple
weeks ago and agreed to come in on the deal. These boys&mdash;"
motioning to the Circle Arrow hands about him, "didn't know about
that. They didn't know I was aimin' to drive the beef toward the
ridges so that DeSpain and Sommers could get the stuff and run it
out of the country. It was all agreed that way. Well, I laid back
from the boys and met DeSpain just when the storm broke. I knew
he'd been up to Anita's place and it made me sore. Anyhow, I
figured he was tryin' to double-cross me on the beef&mdash;cheat
me out of my share of the profits. I shot him when he turned
around to leave. Saw him fall. Then I got to hell out of there.
That's all&mdash;"</p>

<p>Darrah said, "Well, Lonzo, make your peace&mdash;" But he
stopped and laid his hand on Hardesty's chest; then looked
quickly up to the other men in the room. "That's the end of
him."</p>

<p>"Waste no sympathy on him," said one of the men
emotionlessly.</p>

<p>The front door opened and the Circle Arrow hand guarding the
porch put his head inside, shouting, "Sommers is here with his
hands lifted! He wants to make talk!"</p>

<p>"Send him in," said Darrah.</p>

<p>Sommers came into the room rapidly and stooped by the fire,
his attention fixed on the dead Hardesty. "I knew Bull got him,"
he muttered. "He said he would. Who shot Bull?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Darrah. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"All I want," answered Sommers, "is to get clear of this
business. So do my boys&mdash;and the JT gang. We don't want to
fight a dead man's side. Listen&mdash;I'll tell you something
Hardesty didn't know."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>Sommers stared all around him, spoke swiftly. "Hardesty put a
bullet in DeSpain. But he only thought he killed DeSpain. When
Hardesty ran away DeSpain got on his horse and started for the
ridges. Eric Bull found him, saw he was hurt. DeSpain told Bull
what had happened and Bull, figurin' this was what he had been
waitin' for a long time, let DeSpain have it. He finished the job
right there. Then he came into Sumpter with his men. When I came
along he told me all about it. But he didn't tell Hardesty, for
we figured we had to hang the killin' on Hardesty. It looked kind
of serious for us if we didn't. So here we was for three days,
jawin' about it&mdash;tryin' to pin it on Hardesty and make him
admit it. When you came we saw all a chance to get clear. We
tried to pin it on you. The rest is what you know."</p>

<p>"Get back to the saloon," said Darrah. "When the storm quits
you mugs pile out of here. I don't care which way. I'll spill the
story to the sheriff. It's up to him, then."</p>

<p>"When the sheriff gets here," said Sommers, "we'll be out of
his reach." And Sommers, at once alert and suspicious, backed
across the room and into the night. Darrah rose slowly to his
feet, speaking to the Circle Arrow crew.</p>

<p>"That's the best way. We don't want any more gunplay. The
affair is finished."</p>

<p>There was a sound above him. Looking up he saw the girl dimly
outlined on the stairs, standing quite straight and watching him.
He said to the crew, "Put Lonzo in a back room and put a blanket
over him." Then he went to the stairs and rose toward the girl,
smiling a little.</p>

<p>"I was at the lone tree," she said, "when I saw Hardesty and
DeSpain meet. The snow was so thick in the air they didn't see
me. Hardesty fired&mdash;and then I ran. That's where I lost the
glove. But I'm sorry for Hardesty, Tom. For if DeSpain had caught
up with me&mdash;I would have shot him."</p>

<p>"Hardesty was usin' you as an excuse of last resort," said
Darrah. "Forget about it. There's better things to consider
now."</p>

<p>"As you please," the girl murmured; and Darrah thought the
long soberness of her eyes was breaking up, turning warm.</p>
