<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>PROLOGUE. The Grooved Barrel</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>IN OUR country two hundred years ago shooting was the national
pastime and people shot guns as to-day they shoot golf. Popping at
an Indian or a turkey or deer was part of the daily occupation of
those who lived on the frontier and in the backwoods; but these men
had no monopoly on either the interest or the skill. They might be
considered as the "pros;" but the cities and civilized seaboards
were full of amateurs who would never have occasion either to save
their scalps or to fend off starvation. And they were just as
zealous afield, and just as partisan in the matter of equipment,
and just as jealous of their markmanship, and just as studious of
technique, and just as persistent in practice as any modern
divot-digger you ever saw. No village so small that it had not its
measured range: and no crossroads tavern could be successful unless
it offered facilities for tests of marksmanship. For rarely did any
gathering of men&mdash;convivial, business, political, even
religious&mdash;disperse without a shooting match. And at stated
intervals, and at stated places, were what might be called the big
open tournaments where men collected for the express purpose. It
was here that reputations were made, so that the time had its Bobby
Jones or its Walter Hagen, with a host of skilled aspirants only a
stroke or so behind. Or perhaps the parallel of state or district
champions would be more exact. Travel in those days was so
difficult that it was impossible to hold a National Open. But each
locality had one or more local champions, the names of whom would
be mentioned wherever in the Colonies men talked of
marksmanship.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>It was first blackbird time, when the snow water is not all
drained away but when the grass beneath the surface of its little
pools waves green. A young man was journeying steadily afoot
alongside the deep wheel ruts of a crude country road. It was a
mere track, winding across the country's face; turning to avoid
high stark stumps, twisting away from bog hole of too great
steepness of hills; innocent of flanking fence or ditch. For a
mile, sometimes, it ran in the dim coolness of the old forest,
where red tanagers flamed in green shadows, and the wild pigeons
beat like distant surf. For another mile, perhaps, it threaded a
marsh where poles had been laid in corduroy and soft-winged
bitterns slanted aloft in erratic flight and trim small peoples
swayed on limber reed ends with chucklings. But soon it shook free
from these petty wildnesses, again to emerge into cleared stumpy
uplands and wide fields, fenced in rail, and Pennsylvania
farmhouses of a civilization by now over a hundred years old.</p>

<p>The youth was a tall young man, standing well over six feet,
lean with the slenderness of whalebone, his face golden brown with
sun, his somewhat aquiline features cast in that brooding yet
watchful repose characteristic of the backwoodsman and the Indian.
His blue-gray eyes too would, to the competent observer, have
identified him with the wilderness, for while their quality was
mild, peaceable, and serene, they were never still, turning from
right to left and from left to right again, ceaselessly, in a
tireless vigilance so habitual that it had become subliminal. The
traveler knew he had nothing to apprehend in this peaceful
countryside; indeed, his thoughts were busied far from the actual
scene: nevertheless no smallest stir of leaf or feather escaped the
mechanics of his attention, which held its report of those matters
only just below the surface of his consciousness. His basic sense
of security was further evidenced by the fact that he bore his
rifle carelessly across his shoulder, and had attached to it for
convenience of carriage against his back a leather portmanteau. He
was dressed in plain garments of homespun and wore on his head the
stiff felt hat of the period.</p>

<p>Though the sun was already past mid-afternoon, and he had been
afoot since its rising, he swung unweariedly along in the
bent-kneed woodsman's slouch, which is apparently so deliberate but
in reality is so swift that one unaccustomed can with difficulty
keep pace, and that for a short distance only. No inequality of
footing or steepness of hill broke the rhythm; nor did he pause for
breath or contemplation until the road broke over a crest to
disclose below him a scattering settlement amongst noble trees in
the bend of a great river. Here he stopped for a moment, surveying
the scene gravely, then plunged down the slope to the village
street.</p>

<p>The place was of the ordinary type and kind&mdash;many frame and
a few brick homes, wide scattered at first, clustering more thickly
as one approached the main street where stood the hotel, or tavern,
two or three shops, and a court or meeting house. Old forest trees
and planted elms new-spangled with spring overspread the roadways
and later would almost completely submerge the roofs of the town.
To one side swept the bend in the river; and here along a canal
were stone and frame buildings with sputtering mill wheels. At the
time of week and the time of day, one would expect to find such a
place moving in only a feeble current of external life: perhaps a
horse or so dozing along the hitching rails; possibly a loafer or
two chair-tilted before the tavern; mayhap a housewife picking her
way on wooden clogs through the soft earth toward the one sidewalk
of the shops. Such a normal condition of somnolence was evidently
anticipated by our young traveler; for he paused in grave and
puzzled observation of what he saw.</p>

<p>The street was aswarm with men of all ages and conditions in
life. They sauntered back and forth; they stood in talkative groups
beneath the elms; they sat in rows on the edge of the high
sidewalk. But principally they milled in and out of the wide
hospitable doors of the tavern, whence arose such a clatter mingled
of talk, argument, song, shouts, laughter, and the clinking
undertone of mugs, glasses, and dishes slammed about, that the
combined noise seemed to burst forth like a palpable flood gone
aleak. No women were to be seen; but numerous small boys and dogs
were engaged in attaching themselves to the situation with as
convincing an air as they could manage.</p>

<p>Our traveler was obviously puzzled and interested. His long free
stride slowed to a saunter: his eyes, heretofore roving in the
mechanics of an automatic vigilance, now brimmed with the keenest
of intelligent observation.</p>

<p>He moved forward with every sense awake to catch the smallest
indicatives that would synthesize into an estimate of the
situation; precisely as it might be imagined he would move in the
shadows of an unknown forest. Indeed he made a slight instinctive
shrug as though to bring forward his rifle to his hand. It was with
him an integral part of alertness, but he caught back the movement
with a flicker of a smile at the corners of his grave lips. It
would have been a simple matter to resolve his curiosity by an
appeal for information to the nearest group; but such a procedure
would have written him down as no woodsman, for it is a curious
fact that those who live by observation rarely ask.</p>

<p>Moving thus, the young man gradually drew nearer the focus of
the tavern. There men jostled in a throng, and the opened doors
crowded and eddied as those who went in made their way with
difficulty against those who came out. Everybody talked or shouted
or sang, for obviously the spirit was of a holiday. Many were more
or less drunk. Across the bobbing heads one might glimpse in the
dim interior the red round faces of waiters moving here and there,
clusters of tankards held aloft. A swirl of many emotions caught at
the poise of stabilities, swept men loose from grave accustomedness
into the exhilaration of temporary irresponsibilities. A certain
recklessness was in the air, a loosening inconstancy into which men
plunged gratefully from the aridities of their daily lives. Though
his outward appearance differed in no marked degree from the many
who composed the throng, the gravity of the stranger's unbroken
aloofness seemed to set him apart, an individual from the herd, and
this very separateness drew to him men's notice as though he had
carried some blazon of distinction. Heads turned. Men exchanged
inquiries; some few of the drunker or more reckless even threw in
his direction good-naturedly jeering remarks. He seemed quite
unaware.</p>

<p>Before the tavern veranda he came to a halt, his attention at
last seizing upon a definite point of considered examination. This
was a long poster of coarse paper that had been tacked into the
bark of an elm by means of sharpened wooden pegs. Before it the
young man took his stand, unslinging his rifle from his back,
resting its butt against the ground before him, clasping his palms
across its muzzle, settling himself easily and gracefully to the
interpretation of the message. To the task he gave all his serene
concentration, his lips moving slowly, spelling out the words. So
evidently unaccustomed and difficult was this task, that the men
nearest hushed their noise to watch him in amusement. One young
chap in the broadcloth of the cities, a youth with a weak reckless
face, who had evidently been drinking heavily, lurched
alongside.</p>

<p>"Want me to read it for you?" he asked, his derision thinly
veiled by a mock politeness.</p>

<p>The stranger turned his eyes from the printed words to
contemplate his interlocutor. For perhaps ten seconds he held
silence.</p>

<p>"No, suh," he then replied, and returned tranquilly to his
perusal. That was all; but the other stuttered and fell back, and a
low chuckle of appreciation rippled among the bystanders. The
proclamation announced:</p>

<p>"God save the King! Hunters and others look this way. A great
shooting match will take place on April 30 at the place by the Big
Bend. The first prize will be a great fat ox and the second a snap
haunce gun with a long barl. To the maker of the winning piece, the
Gunsmith's Medal. Distance 15 rods. A charge of four shillings for
each man. Only one shot for each four shillings. There will be more
prizes for lesser amounts. Lead, powder and flints to be sold.
Plenty to eat and drink for all that come. Bear and wolf traps to
be sold. Tell any man to come to the match. God save the King!"</p>

<p>Having finished his painful deciphering of this document the
young man swung his rifle into the crook of his arm, and had turned
to enter the tavern, when his steps were again arrested. A little
girl of eight or nine years was threading her way sedately between
the lounging groups on the sidewalk. She was a personable little
girl, but her mere prettiness of feature would probably not have
sufficed to rivet the stranger's attention. It was her get-up,
which was in the latest and daintiest style of the cities. It is to
be conceived that our young backwoodsman, if such he were, had
never seen anything quite like it before. His eye lighted with an
intense interest, and the contained gravity of his face was
broken.</p>

<p>The child was accompanied by a medium-sized woolly dog of a
species also strange to our young man's knowledge. She was quite
composed, a dainty, incongruous, unbelievable creature from a story
book. So wholly did this apparition lie outside his experience that
for the first time he abandoned his self-containment, turning to
the man next him for enlightenment.</p>

<p>"Some rich man's darter, must be," he surmised.</p>

<p>"You'd think so, wouldn't you?" said the other, with a short
laugh. "Well, she ain't. She's the granddaughter of old man
Farrell&mdash;the gunsmith. But he's crazy anyhow."</p>

<p>"He must be right fond of that little gal," surmised the
stranger, surveying her keenly. "Granddarter, you say? Just her and
the old man, I reckon."</p>

<p>"How'd you guess that?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"He must be right lonesome," continued the younger man, pursuing
his train of thought unheeding. Then, having come to his conclusion
as to this unfamiliar phenomenon, he almost visibly abandoned it.
"I am obleeged to you, suh," said he, and again lifted his rifle
and portmanteau. But the other man did not so readily relinquish
this opening for his own curiosity.</p>

<p>"You in town for the shootin' match?" he enquired as a
preliminary to an inquisition.</p>

<p>"No, suh," replied the young man politely, but with finality,
"Just travelin' through."</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>From across the earth street a large mongrel launched itself
like a thunderbolt straight for the woolly dog. The latter, bowled
over by the suddenness and weight of the onslaught, shrieked aloud
in terror, writhing and snapping in the grip of its more powerful
antagonist. The air was vociferous with growls, yelps and
snarls.</p>

<p>"Dog fight! Dog fight!" yelled those nearest. The idlers surged
forward joyously, forming a compact eager group around the center
of disturbance, those on the outside crowding and shoving for a
better view. The little girl, jostled unceremoniously aside, beat
and pulled at the braced legs, frantic but quite unnoticed. She was
beside herself, all her pretty poise shattered by the urgency of
the crisis. The world had become a world of inhuman and indifferent
backs. Casting about her distractedly she ran in appeal to the one
face turned in her direction.</p>

<p>"He'll be killed!" she cried. "It's that old Tiger! He's always
tried to kill him! Oh! Oh!"</p>

<p>The young man contemplated her gravely for a moment; then, with
an air of having come to a deliberate decision, began to shove his
way to the center of the close-packed ring. So sudden and so
determined was his movement that he met no serious opposition. Some
of those he thrust aside flared angrily, and would have laid hands
upon him, but so quickly had he moved that he was beyond their
reach. Before anybody had grasped clearly what he was about he had
snatched the woolly dog aloft, and had delivered a very convincing
kick into the short ribs of its assailant.</p>

<p>"You Tiger! Down!" he further admonished that canine. His low
soft voice snapped like a whip. In its tone was that entire
expectation of obedience which alone penetrates effectively to a
dog's consciousness. Tiger hesitated, licked his lips: but he
obeyed.</p>

<p>At once the air was rent by cries of angry expostulastion.</p>

<p>"Hey you! What you think you're doin'!"</p>

<p>"Who the hell you think you are?"</p>

<p>Men, red-faced, crowded belligerently forward; Fists were
clenched; hands were raised. Had the young man stirred by a palm's
breadth it is probable the mob would have fallen upon him bodily.
He did not move. Holding the cowed and whimpering woolly dog in his
arms, he waited. His blue eyes were calm, and a little remote, as
though, pending the moment, he had withdrawn to secret, inner, and
distant preoccupations of his own.</p>

<p>"Folks," said he pleasantly at last. He did not raise his voice:
and instinctively the mob hushed to quiet that it might hear, "I
like a good dawg fight same as anybody. But this here ain't no dawg
fight: it's a killin'. Besides, this here thing ain't rightly a
dog, according to my raisin'; and besides that it belongs to the
lady yander."</p>

<p>He tossed his head ever so slightly from the abject woolly dog
toward the gulping small girl. Several responded, with a faint
laugh, to the grave and sardonic gleam in his eye. But one burly
and red-faced man was unreconciled and belligerent.</p>

<p>"By God!" cried this one. "Who are you to come pushin' yourself
in where you ain't wanted? For a ha'penny I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young man turned his head deliberately.</p>

<p>"Dawg fights most gen'ily turns into man fights," he remarked.
"Don't seem no sense to it; but that's the way it is. I ain't
aimin' for no trouble: I'm just a-travelin' through."</p>

<p>"Afraid be ye!" sneered the red-faced man. "Well,
I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not afeard," interrupted the stranger placidly. "I'll
fight ye, if so be ye're set upon it. But yere ain't no time nor
place. For one thing I'm aimin' to take this young-un and
her&mdash;" he glanced down, a gleam of humor crossing the bleak
gravity of his face&mdash;"and her dawg," he drawled, "back home
where she ought to be."</p>

<p>"Runnin' away," sneered the red-faced man.</p>

<p>"I ain't leavin'," stated the young man. He surveyed slowly one
by one the faces of the crowd. "I reckon that's all," said he.
"I'll be back yere afore sundown, and then you can suit yoreself."
He turned away with a decision that parted the ring before him,
picked up his rifle and leather portmanteau which he slung again
across his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come on, sister," said he. She raised her tear-stained face to
his confidingly and took his hand. They moved away: the woolly dog
snuggled in the hollow of his left arm, he shortening his long
woodsman strides, she skipping valiantly to keep pace.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>But they had not proceeded far in the direction the young lady
rather vaguely indicated before they were met by her grandfather,
out in anxious search for her. When he had learned, partly from the
child, partly from the young stranger, an inkling of what had
happened, he expressed his relief. The expedition had been her own
fancy.</p>

<p>"She would be better housed just now," submitted the young man.
"Nobody rightly would mean to harm her; but men git rough in
drink."</p>

<p>"She got away," agreed the gunsmith, "and I am obliged to you
for your trouble. You're in town for the Shooting, I suppose,"
glancing with professional interest at the stranger's weapon.</p>

<p>"No, suh," the young man denied, "just travelin' through. I am
from South Branch since sun-up and knew nought of the
Shooting."</p>

<p>"Where are you stopping for the night?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere as yit; I aim to stop at the tavern."</p>

<p>"But man alive, you'll find no place there!" cried the old man.
"Every nook and cranny is filled long since."</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, considered for a moment. "You must stay at
my house," he decided, "Nay, I insist."</p>

<p>But his urgency was unnecessary. The young man accepted the
proffer as simply as, it might be conceived, he would have accepted
the good cheer of a dry cave in the wilderness. He deposited the
woolly dog on the ground:</p>

<p>"Which way, suh?" he enquired</p>

<p>The four proceeded down the earth road toward the canal. The
little girl prattled eagerly at her grandfather about the horrid
Tiger and his attempt at canicide, The stranger moved in his serene
silence. Shortly they arrived at a rambling sort of structure, or
series of structures attached one to the other. A small mill wheel
indicated that the greater group of these were used as a
manufacturing plant. The old man unlocked the door of a smaller
wing and led the way to a cool interior of plain old polished wood,
diamond-shaped panes, a dark table, a great fireplace, two benches,
and a number of easy chairs. Ornament there was none, unless a
score or more of guns slung on pegs about the walls might be so
considered.</p>

<p>"Sit, lad, sit!" urged the old man, thrusting forward one of the
chairs. "South Branch is distant and even young limbs must
weary."</p>

<p>"I am obleeged to you, suh," acknowledged the youth. He
deposited his rifle and portmanteau in a corner, removed his hat;
perched himself upright and a little gingerly on the edge of one of
the great chairs, his eye roving in deliberate scrutiny of his
surroundings.</p>

<p>The old man hung his own three-cornered headpiece in the corner,
disclosing the fact that he wore no wig. He was a small, compact
old gentleman, with a stiff, upright brush of brown hair on a
bullet head; and he moved with the swift darting certainty of a
bird. His speech, too, was swift and darting and as voluble as that
of his visitor was spare.</p>

<p>"My people are all abroad," he observed. "There is no keeping
them at their tasks, so perforce and with good grace I declared
holiday. You must take cold cheer."</p>

<p>He darted here and there, in and out a door on the right side of
the fireplace, opening and shutting a cupboard on the left,
clattering tankards and trenchers, with a continued buzz of
movement like the sustained high hum of a bee. Behind it, as a
bridge across to the hushed and aloof serenity of the room, a
serenity into which the stranger had slipped as naturally as into a
grateful and familiar element, beat the measured slow <i>tick-tock,
tick-tock</i> of a tall clock in the corner.</p>

<p>"There!" cried the old man at last. "Draw up, young man! 'Tis
but cold fare, but will suffice. I'll warrant ye've done worse in
your time! A venison pasty; good bread of rye; honest ale
home-brewed, none of your raw spirits that is the drink of
fools."</p>

<p>"I am obleeged to you, suh," said the young man, and unfolded
his long frame from the great chair and took his place at the
table.</p>

<p>"I have nought by which to name you," Farrell reminded his guest
as they sat... "Don, eh? A good Scotch name, I warrant. Nay, fall
to, lad, and use your mouth for more grateful work than
talking."</p>

<p>They ate; the stranger for most part in the calm silence that
held no hint of awkwardness; the old man chattering as suggestively
near to questioning as his notion of politeness permitted; The
little girl, who had at first curled herself into another of the
great chairs, at length slipped to the floor and sidled over to
take her stand against the young man's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I hope you hurt that old Tiger&mdash;when you kicked him," said
she.</p>

<p>"Leave her stay," the stranger interfered to her grandfather's
admonition. "I like young-uns. There's been a plenty of 'em in my
raisin'." A slow grave smile sketched his lips, and he reached a
strong finger to touch her ringleted head. "But we ain't got no
little ladies like this un," he added. Beyond that he volunteered
nothing about himself.</p>

<p>They finished the meal. The old man produced clay pipes and
tobacco. But before joining his host in the great chairs before the
fireplace the guest stretched his long legs, wandering about the
room, examining attentively the weapons on the walls.</p>

<p>The old man watched him a moment, then arose to join him.</p>

<p>"You are interested in guns?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, suh," acknowledged the other. "You see,"&mdash;his manner
almost implied an apology for intruding even so much of his
personal intimacies&mdash;"we livin' on the border use 'em a lot,
what with shootin' game and takin' keer of ourselves like, when it
comes to Injins and such."</p>

<p>"You have fought Indians?" pounced the old man.</p>

<p>But the younger withdrew into vagueness.</p>

<p>"Injins is not bad folks in some ways," he submitted. "I got
good friends among the Injins. But a man must take keer of
himself."</p>

<p>"These guns are a sort of historical collection," explained the
gunmaker after a moment's bright-eyed contemplation of his visitor.
"I have tried to show how they have developed. See, here is an old
match lock and here a wheel lock. And this is a sample of the very
first rifle with a straight-cut groove without a twist. And here is
a bell-muzzle that shot slugs, or even stones."</p>

<p>"They surely are a clumsy-Iookin' contraption," marveled the
young man. "A man wonders how they ever hit anything."</p>

<p>"They didn't&mdash;much."</p>

<p>"Man has a hard enough time gettin' along nowadays, what with
shots that go wild even with good holdin'."</p>

<p>The visitor turned finally to the chairs and the pipes. "But
it's surely interestin' to me, suh; and I am obleeged to you."</p>

<p>He lighted his pipe thoughtfully; and somehow it becarne evident
that he was slowly coming to a decision.</p>

<p>"I'm figurin' on somethin', suh," he said at last. "You're the
first man I ever saw that made guns. I wouldn't wish to ask too
much of you, suh; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is it, lad?" urged the old man.</p>

<p>"If it ain't no secret, suh, how kin you make a true bar'l? Many
a time I've figgered on it&mdash;if it ain't no secret."</p>

<p>"Come with me, lad," he cried, eager with the master's
enthusiasm over his craft. He remembered the little girl. "Time for
your posset, child; and then to bed. She is already a good
housewife,"&mdash;he turned proudly to his visitor&mdash;"and
shall manage her own supper&mdash;and mine and yours for the matter
of that&mdash;as well as any woman grown. Make your curtsy to Don
here, and kiss your old gran'ther, and run along."</p>

<p>He unlocked a door, and the two entered the long low workshop,
now deserted for the holiday. Through the clutter of tools and
half-finished pieces, he led the way to a rack on which were
stacked broad flat bars of iron.</p>

<p>"Here are your barrels," said he.</p>

<p>The young man knit his brows.</p>

<p>"You can't bore no hole in such," he objected.</p>

<p>The old man smiled.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," he agreed. "Here,"&mdash;he exhibited a long
slender rod. "That's what we call the core rod. First we heat the
flat bar to welding heat; then we fold it around the core rod, and
weld it together; then we draw out the core rod. There's your
barrel with the hole in it. It is rough, of course," he added.</p>

<p>"How come the core rod don't stick?"</p>

<p>"We weld only a few inches at a heat, withdrawing the rod each
time, but even then on occasion it will not come away." The old man
sighed. "Then we must cut it out with a cold chisel or throw it
away. Next, of course, we smooth the new barrel as much as
possible. Have to do that with a hammer for the outside and a hand
reamer for the inside, like a carpenter bores in wood."</p>

<p>"Cain't you use a lathe?" asked the young man keenly.</p>

<p>"Doesn't run steady enough."</p>

<p>"Can you get her straight that way by eye?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good. But look here." The gunsmith picked up a
half-finished barrel from the bench and took down a long hickory
bow from a nail on the wall. It was precisely like a bow used as a
weapon, except that it was lighter, and its cord was but a fine
silk thread. Farrell loosed one end of the thread, dropped it
carefully through the barrel, and again attached it to the bow. He
held the barrel to the light. "Look through it," he commanded.
"Look at the shadow of the thread and you can see where it does not
touch. That means a crooked place. We've got to straighten that out
by tapping with a light hammer."</p>

<p>The young man turned his face slowly in admiration of this
ingenuity.</p>

<p>"Always begin straightening in the middle of the barrel,"
chortled the old man, delighted. "Chase the rascals out at the
ends!" he cried.</p>

<p>The stranger shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'd sure hate to try to do it, suh," he submitted.</p>

<p>"It's as easy for me to take a kink out of a barrel as it is for
you to make shavings off a pine stick with a sharp knife!" the
gunsmith boasted.</p>

<p>His visitor turned the barrel slowly over and over, examining
mentally the problem rather than physically the thing he held in
his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, suh," he said at last.</p>

<p>"Here," said Farrell, leading the way to a long low bench, "is
the most important part of all, Here's where we cut the grooves for
the rifling."</p>

<p>"I do admire to see that!" cried the young man with an approach
to eagerness.</p>

<p>He saw a long cherry wood cylinder of four or five inches in
diameter in the surface of which had been cut four deep grooves
that ran in a long spiral about the cylinder. They resembled the
grooves in a rifle barrel, except that in this case; of course,
they were on the outside. The cylinder was suspended in a
framework. Midway in the framework had been fixed rigidly and
immovably four projecting nubs that fitted into and engaged the four
grooves. So if one were to push the cylinder forward on its
carriage past the nubs, it must revolve at the rate and the pitch
determined by the grooves in it.</p>

<p>"And that," explained Farrell, "is exactly the rate and pitch of
the rifling we want in our barrel. All we've got to do is clamp our
barrel in exact line, hitch our groove-cutting tool rigidly on the
end of the wooden cylinder, and it is <i>bound</i> to cut grooves
exactly the same as those in the cylinder. See?"</p>

<p>His visitor shoved the simple contrivance back and forth a
number of times, noting the slow turn along the rifled guiding
groove.</p>

<p>"Well," he sighed at last, "that is ce'tainly a smart trick.
I'll remember that. How long mought it take you, now, to rifle a
bar'l?"</p>

<p>"Takes about a hundred cuts to cut a groove&mdash;about two
hours," replied Farrell. "Then she needs polishing and smoothing.
We use lead plugs for that mostly."</p>

<p>They proceeded slowly. Excited by his guest's intelligent
appreciation the old gunmaker expanded. He showed how the new
barrels were plugged at one end of the tube, and how they were then
browned by a mixture of aqua fortis, blue vitriol, tincture of
iron, and water. In sketchy pantomime the old man demonstrated how
the locks were constructed and applied. At the woodworking bench he
paused for but a moment.</p>

<p>"Curly maple, that's the wood," he stated dogmatically, "and you
want to work her by hand. And stain her by hand with good honest
soot and oil. Then you've got a job."</p>

<p>They returned to the living room. The young man picked up his
own rifle, which he examined gravely in the light of new knowledge.
Farrell stood at his elbow.</p>

<p>"I see you have one of Martin Meylan's," he observed. "Like
it?"</p>

<p>"She holds her own," replied the young man, non-committally.</p>

<p>"What you done to the trigger guard?"</p>

<p>The stranger smiled his slow smile, in modest deprecation.</p>

<p>"I expect I'm wrong, suh," said he. "I expect they's a right
good reason why all the gunsmiths do this away and not that away;
and I expect they must be right. But just for me, suh&mdash;in my
own use, this trigger guard suits me better."</p>

<p>"Made it yourself, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, suh. 'Tain't much of a trigger guard f'r looks; but it
suits me better."</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted the gunmaker, setting the weapon into the
corner again, and leading the way to the pipes and chairs.</p>

<p>"I mean no offense, suh," said the visitor. "It's just my own
idee for myself."</p>

<p>"Offense!" snorted the old man. "But you're right, lad! Do you
know why every gunmaker in the Colonies puts that foolish,
cumbersome, fragile trigger guard on every gun he turns out? Simply
because that is the kind they put on guns in Europe! No other
reason! God knows why they wanted that kind there&mdash;thought 'em
pretty, I suppose. Same way with a lot of other things. Gunmakers
are pig-headed fools. They listen to no reason, but sit puffed in
the arrogance of their self-conceit like toads; crying down those
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had arisen and was waving about his long pipe; but, catching
the expression of honest bewilderment on his guest's face, he broke
off in a calm as startling as his excitement, and sat down again
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Tell me, lad," said he persuasively. "You spoke but now with a
lukewarm indifference of the quality of your piece. What is its
fault? And why procure ye none more to your fancy, since, as you
say, your life may depend on it? Is the barrel not true, then?
Perhaps we might remedy that."</p>

<p>"You mistake me, suh," the young man assured him earnestly. "The
bar'l is true and finely made."</p>

<p>"It should be. Meylan is a gunsmith of reputation."</p>

<p>"I would not have you think otherwise. I but spoke aloud an idle
thought. I know nought of these things, and would not set my poor
notions against the experience of my worshipful masters."</p>

<p>"Worshipful fiddlesticks!" exploded the old man. "Did I not tell
ye, lad, that gunmakers are pig-headed fools, copying slavishly
what is patterned for them in Europe and listening to no reason,
but sunning themselves in arrogance? Come lad! your ideas?"</p>

<p>"They are without doubt impossible, suh; for I have no
understanding of the craft."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, perhaps!" Farrell waved this aside. "But let us
pretend there is no impossible. I would know your ideas, lad! Speak
them freely."</p>

<p>"Well, suh, I would have a piece that used not so much good
powder and lead, for powder and lead are hard to come at in the
wilderness, and it has seemed to me that a well-placed ball will do
its work&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Even a smaller ball," supplied the gunsmith. "There is nought
of impossibility there; only common sense. Do <i>you</i> know the
reason&mdash;the only reason&mdash;why all men contrive to use
these great slugs? Because in Europe they know little of
well-placed balls, and care less; because their only idea is to hit
a regiment of men. And then?"</p>

<p>"Well, suh, a longer bar'l would suit me better, and I think
most men who range the forests."</p>

<p>"Why?" snapped the old man.</p>

<p>"For better sighting. The woods are dark, and if a man would
hold true in twilight, he must have his front sight far from his
eye."</p>

<p>"That is true, too. And there is nought impossible
there&mdash;save that gunmakers are a pig-headed lot, And
then?"</p>

<p>For the first time the young man chuckled, aloud. "Yere is where
we touch the impossible, suh; for as long as I'm a-dreaming I will
tell the whole. I would have a piece that would place the ball
truer to where I hold, so that when I drawed my bead and pressed my
trigger true I would find my ball where my eye had rested."</p>

<p>"And you do not? You think you can hold truer than your ball can
speed?"</p>

<p>"So can any good man," submitted the youth modestly, but with
entire confidence, "for be yore bar'l never so truly made, and load
yore piece never so carefully with the best of French powder and
priming of the finest grain, cast you yore balls never so
cunningly, nevertheless it may so hap that it strays, and no man
can tell when this will befall."</p>

<p>"Why is this, in your opinion?"</p>

<p>"Nay, that I cannot guess," replied the young man
good-humoredly. "It is, I must suppose, in the natur' of things and
we must bear with it."</p>

<p>The old man hesitated, weighing a decision.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless even that might be compassed, in my belief," he
said at last.</p>

<p>"Anon?" queried the other.</p>

<p>The old man leaned forward excitedly.</p>

<p>"Can you guard a secret?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, suh," said the young man gravely.</p>

<p>The gunsmith arose and left the room, to return after a moment
bearing a rifle. This he withheld for a moment; then, as though
finally making up his mind, he passed it into his visitor's hands
and stood back in silence. It was a graceful weapon, strong without
clumsiness, its octagon barrel nearly three feet and a half long,
but so light that it would probably not have tipped the beam at
over eight or nine pounds. Its stock of polished curly maple
extended its full length and was gracefully carved; its trigger
guard was small and compact. Beneath the barrel rings of brass held
a long hickory ramrod. In the side of the butt-stock opened a
brass-covered trap. The lock was small, compact, about half the
size of that on the usual arm of the day, and the clean small flint
was held in leathered jaws.</p>

<p>"There's your long barrel, and your spread of sights"&mdash;the
old man could not keep silence long&mdash;"and your small strong
trigger guard. There's your smaller bore. The balls run fifty-two
to the pound instead of a score or less&mdash;you can carry three
times the ammunition. The lock is as swift in action as a flash of
light. See how smoothly the flint meets the frizzen! Throw it to
your face, man! Held you ever so sweet a balance, or one that
steadied itself so in the hand?"</p>

<p>The young man obeyed, and the extended muzzle of the long weapon
came to the immobility of a rock.</p>

<p>"What say you?" urged the gunmaker, surveying his visitor's
stance and handling with approval, but shifting from one foot to
the other with an impatience ludicrously like that of a small
boy.</p>

<p>"It is a sweet piece," sighed the visitor, lowering it at last.
"A sweet piece, such as I never thought to hold atween my hands."
He examined its details keenly. "I think, suh, if you don't mind my
sayin' it, that you will have to make you another loadin' rod of
iron."</p>

<p>"Hickory makes quieter loading."</p>

<p>"I know. But forcin' the ball down the bar'l is rough work, and
a broken rod&mdash;"</p>

<p>The old man for the moment did not meet this issue. "Is it not
such a piece as you have dreamed?" he insisted. "Such as you
described to me but now?"</p>

<p>The youth smiled a slow gleam of humor.</p>

<p>"All but one thing," he reminded.</p>

<p>It was Farrell's turn to look his inquiry.</p>

<p>"These things you have yere," explained the woods-man,
"&mdash;and I do not deny they are a great leap ahead&mdash;all
these things are but aids to a man's holdin'! But they do not place
the ball."</p>

<p>"Aha, lad!" the old gunmaker burst forth in a triumph for which
it was now evident he had waited not too patiently. "That too I
have compassed." He placed his finger alongside his nose with a
comical air of cunning.</p>

<p>"Tell me, lad, what causes the ball to stray, when, as you say,
the holding is good?"</p>

<p>"Nay, suh," replied the other, "how could I tell you that? It
is, as I have said, in the natur' of things."</p>

<p>"Then I will e'en tell <i>you!</i> The first of these causes is
a fouled and thereby roughened barrel."</p>

<p>The young man nodded acquiescence.</p>

<p>"That is true, in my own knowledge," he admitted, "so that, when
time serves, I wipe out my piece very carefully after each
shot."</p>

<p>"You can clean away thus the hard ash of burned powder," Farrell
told him, "but you cannot thus remove the lead that is stripped
from the ball flake by flake until the smoothness of the barrel is
gone. The second reason is married with the third, and both have as
parent the fit of the ball in the barrel. For if it sets not snugly
in the grooves the force of the powder in great part leaps past it
and is lost: and if it does fit snugly then it must be hammered
home by force, and is thereby upset and malformed, no matter how
shrewdly and gingerly one handles his rod. And a malformed bullet
cannot fly straight."</p>

<p>"That is very interesting to me, suh," said the young man, "and
part of it I had suspected, but not all. But I can see no
cure."</p>

<p>"Here," proffered Farrell, "are the balls for this rifle."</p>

<p>The visitor took one of them in his fingers and examined it
without comment.</p>

<p>"You see no difference from any ordinary bullet, save for the
size. You are right: there is no difference. But look!" He dropped
the butt of the rifle to the floor and inserted one of the bullets
into its muzzle. In ordinary loading it was customary to drive the
ball several inches into the barrel by means of a short metal rod
and a small hammer called a "starter," after which it was forced
home with the ramrod. In this instance, when the old man
relinquished it, the ball dropped down the barrel freely, and as he
reversed the muzzle it rolled slowly out again into his palm. He
made no explanation, but looked expectantly toward his visitor. The
latter knit his brows, knowing some comment was awaited.</p>

<p>"If you aim to hold it in with wadding atop," he submitted at
last, "I have tried that; and it flies wild as a hawk."</p>

<p>"Every child knows that&mdash;has tried that!"</p>

<p>"Yes, suh," agreed the stranger, "but it was all I could think
of."</p>

<p>"Now I am going to show you something. And this is what you must
keep secret. You must not tell a soul of what you are to see.
Remember!"</p>

<p>"I have passed you my word, suh," stated the young man with a
quiet dignity.</p>

<p>The old gunmaker paused in his tremendous inner excitement long
enough to pat the other hastily on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"No offense, my lad; I trust ye," said he. "Now see."</p>

<p>He opened the brass trap in the side of the stock and from it
took a piece of greased linen cloth cut in a round a little less in
size than a half-dollar. This he stretched across the muzzle of the
gun, covering with it the hole of the bore. Next he laid the bullet
atop and pressed it into the aperture with his thumb.</p>

<p>"We are supposing we have charged the piece with powder," he
explained. "Here," he forced the ramrod into the visitor's hands.
"Push her home, lad!"</p>

<p>The young man, with the grace of long accustomedness, swung the
butt of the weapon to the left and in front and at the same time
inserted the tip of the ramrod into the bore and applied strongly
the thrust of his right arm. An expression of surprise crossed his
face.</p>

<p>"She slides slick and smooth as a greased shoat through a
cornfield!" he marveled.</p>

<p>"And she stays there," supplemented the old man, snatching the
rifle, turning it upside down, and striking the butt sharply by way
of demonstration. "Is not that quicker than the old way? And
quieter? And need ye fear now that the hickory rod will break? And
mark you: each new loading wipes away the burnt powder of the last
shot, so that the barrel is ever clean. And the ball is left true
and round as it came from the mould. And no lead strips from it to
the barrel. And the linen patch, filling well all space within,
lets not the force of the powder by. So there are your reasons for
wild flight all answered!"</p>

<p>But the visitor was not wholly satisfied.</p>

<p>"And the ball still takes the twist of the grooves when the
naked lead touches them not?" he commented doubtfully. "How can
that be?"</p>

<p>The old man paused in his task, which was of abstracting the
bullet by means of a screw worm which he had attached to the end of
the rod.</p>

<p>"Nay, lad: that I cannot tell you. I have thought much on it. It
must be, as you say, in the nature of things. But it does."</p>

<p>The youth pondered in his slow and deliberate fashion. "And the
ball flies true?" he asked at length. "I do not doubt you, suh," he
hastened to add, "but I mind me my father's sayin'; for when one
showed him a piece and boasted of the hang of its stock and the
prettiness of its carvings and the smooth dark brown of its bar'l,
and the cunning of its make, he always said, 'Yes, she's purty, but
she ain't worth a damn unless she shoots straight. Let's try her.'
No offense, suh; but have you tried her?"</p>

<p>"I've shot her," replied the gunsmith briefly. He broke off; but
was compelled to answer the other's waiting. "I can make a gun," he
continued in gruff tone, "but I cannot hold one true. A slight
palsy&mdash;a shaking of the hand. But," his voice rose to a
vehemence almost of hysteria, "I'll stake my life that I am right,
sneer and laugh these other pig-headed fools as they may! They know
nought but what their fathers have told them; and their conceit is
such. But they will sing a different tune. Fools! pigheaded fools!"
He fumed, walking up and down with quick uneven steps. Abruptly he
came to a halt before his visitor. "Would you credit it," he
resumed in a quieter and more reasonable voice, "when, as a brother
craftsman, I sought to share the workings of my mind; when I strove
to discuss reasonably the things we have discussed so reasonably
here&mdash;and you are an intelligent lad, Don, with more sense in
your noodle than all of them together&mdash;when I would have
spoken of the need for a rifle fitted to American rather than
European hands, I was set aside as one sets aside a presumptuous
urchin and rebuked for conceiving myself wiser than the
masters!"</p>

<p>He snorted, and again changed his mood.</p>

<p>"But to-morrow!" He chuckled, and again laid his finger
alongside his nose. "You must linger to-morrow, lad; you are
welcome here. To-morrow you shall see."</p>

<p>"You will shoot the piece in to-morrow's match?"</p>

<p>"Not I. But I forget: you are a stranger here, and perchance
know not the significance of tomorrow. Know then that this is no
ordinary shooting; but is an event to which once each year all
gunmakers bring their best and truest pieces to the trial; so that
he whose rifle carries away the palm is winner of the golden medal
of the craft, so that all men come to him, and his business gains
great increase and himself reputation."</p>

<p>"But, suh," suggested the young man diffidently, "you yourself
but now said&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"That I cannot hold true," agreed the other. "But it is an
article of the contest that the maker of the piece may engage
another to stand for him: and for that reason it is customary in
the craft to bespeak skilled men to shoot for them at the butts.
Few gunmakers test their own rifles. And I&mdash;" he chuckled
again, and rubbed his hands together&mdash;"I have been beforehand
and have compacted with John Gladden of whom even in the borders
you may have heard."</p>

<p>"His name has reached my ears," acknowledged the young man. "I
should greatly admire, suh, to see so notable a marksman
perform."</p>

<p>"You shall!" cried the gunmaker. "You shall! Tomorrow! And with
the best shooter and the best rifle in the colonies it shall go
hard if I do not thrust their sneers adown their very throats! And
I'll tell you. This..."</p>

<p>The tall clock in the corner clucked in its throat, hesitated,
then struck solemnly. The young man glanced up startled at the
level shafts of light.</p>

<p>"Yore pardon, suh, for interruptin' you," he cried. "But I must
be excused. I have made a promise which I am tardy in fulfilling.
It will not take me long, and I beg you to be patient, for I would
hear more of these things on my return."</p>

<p>So saying, he snatched up his hat and hastened from the
room.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Nor had he time to spare, for the last rays of the sun were
lifting from atop the elm trees when he had regained the tavern
square. His antagonist, slightly drunk, was parading to and fro at
the appointed spot. He had evidently worked himself into a high
state of braggadocio and belligerency; and ever and anon he would
stop short, flap his elbows, and crow lustily like a cock. Many men
surrounded him in a loose group, cheering him on, half laughing,
half in earnest. Someone caught sight of the young man approaching
and raised a shout, hastily opening a passage. The red-faced man
stopped short, and peered evilly from beneath bushy brows.</p>

<p>"So you've come to take your licking after all, eh!" he
growled.</p>

<p>"If so be you're of the same mind, which still seems to me a
foolishness to fight like dawgs just because dawgs be a-fighting,"
replied the youth. "Is it not more befitting sensible men to share
a tankard of mine host's good ale&mdash;"</p>

<p>The older man leaned forward and brought the flat of his palm
smartly against the stranger's face.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> will ye fight!" he snarled. "Or are ye still too
skeered?"</p>

<p>The youngman's steadiness did not waver, nor did he show other
sign than a slow darkening of the cheeks.</p>

<p>"That was not needful, suh," said he mildly. "Nor am I
askeered."</p>

<p>Without further parley the red-faced man lowered his bead and
made a bull-like rush. The stranger slipped lightly aside in
avoidance; at the same time glancing about in surprise.</p>

<p>A tall heavy-set man in a bottle-green topcoat with many small
capes stepped forward authoritatively.</p>

<p>"What mean ye!" he cried in resonant tones. "Is this mannerly?
Fair play and a proper ring, say I; and hurrah for the best
man!"</p>

<p>His interference met with approval.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Squire!"</p>

<p>"Fair play!"</p>

<p>"We'll back ye in that!" came to him from many voices.</p>

<p>At this moment also the tavern's landlord bustled forth,
appealing for no brawls before his door.</p>

<p>"The stable yard, gentlemen!" he tried. "It is at hand, and much
more seemly!"</p>

<p>"The stable yard it is," agreed the Squire. "Come ye," he seized
the combatants each by an elbow and marched them away like
children, followed by the streaming and excited rabble.</p>

<p>"I thank you, suh," said the young man. "Methought for a moment
that I saw the ruin of my only coat."</p>

<p>Arrived at the stable yard the Squire, still holding his charges
by the elbow, looked about him high-headed, and rapidly named a
dozen to form the ring. Back of these appointed provosts the crowd
gathered dense; and men clambered rapidly atop wagons and walls,
and even swarmed to the stable roof for a better view. When the
stir had died the Squire released his charges, shoving each to an
opposite side.</p>

<p>"Strip," he commanded them. It was evident that the Squire was
enjoying himself hugely.</p>

<p>The challenger, who was aflame with eagerness&mdash;and
whiskey&mdash;tore his shirt from his back and handed it at random
among the spectators, disclosing himself as a heavy gorilla of a
man, bull-necked, barrel-chested, thick-armed, with heavy strong
muscle bands. The stranger methodically folded his coat, removed
and folded his shirt, which he placed atop it. Holding the bundle
in his arms he looked from face to face of those about him. He
stepped to confront a placid kindly-faced man of middle age.</p>

<p>"Could I ask you to mind these for me, suh?" he asked
courteously.</p>

<p>"Gladly," assented the burgher. He leaned to speak in a lower
voice. "Beware of him, lad," he advised earnestly. "He is an ugly
fighter and he will kill you if he can. I am sorry this must be,"
he added.</p>

<p>"Thank you, suh, I can but do my best," rejoined the youth, and
turned to the center of the ring.</p>

<p>His torso, now stripped of its garments, was seen to be molded
in lines of a smooth slenderness that at first glance contrasted
ill with the heavy power of his antagonist. Nevertheless, a
connoisseur in bodies would have found somewhat to admire in the
contrast of the broad spare shoulders and the narrow compact hips,
and would have appreciated the whipcord quality of the long muscles
and the ripple of their perfect condition beneath the skin. But its
force would seem the force more of long endurance than the power
necessary to contend successfully with the crushing oaken strength
of the man over against him. Here and there in the crowd a few
murmured in pitying deprecation of the inequality of the contest,
but their protests were drowned in the general eagerness of
excitement. Men shouted offers to wager, but the offers were all on
one side and no takers, for none accorded the younger man a chance
against a known and reputed rough-and-tumble fighter. Only after
the clamor had died somewhat through lack of fuel did the Squire's
loud voice speak on the other side.</p>

<p>"Damme," he bellowed at one of the most vociferous, who now
offered four to one, "taken for a pound," but he added, "I'll not
begrudge a pound for the sake of sport. Now hark ye," he addressed
the antagonists, "this is all my say: if one or the other cries
enough, at that moment ye cease, and if any offers blow or grip
thereafter he reckons with me. Now fight it out."</p>

<p>He stepped back.</p>

<p>The big man slouched toward the youth, lowered his head, and
rushed like a bull. The latter again slipped easily to one side,
evading the outstretched hands. Thrice this was repeated.</p>

<p>"Stand and fight, you poltroon!" snarled the red-faced man.</p>

<p>The younger made no reply, watching his antagonist warily. Twice
more the same maneuver with the same result; except that once the
stranger laid hand on the other's shoulder as he passed, but
snatched it away instantly when faced by a sudden turn in his
direction. The crowd began to shout impatiently, for it was evident
that if he so chose the visitor's superior agility could prolong
indefinitely this avoidance; and they wanted a fight, not a foot
race. So clamorous became their demands that the Squire at length
raised his bull voice.</p>

<p>"Fair play!" he cried. "Give the lad a chance!"</p>

<p>At length the challenger wearied of futile rushing that grasped
nothing, and came to a stand in the center, sneeringly awaiting a
move by the other. The latter, stooping, his arms hanging, began
then slowly to circle just out of reach. It was notable that
neither man had offered as yet to strike the other with his fists.
Blows in the fights of those days were a secondary offense,
delivered to batter into submission only after an advantage had
been gained. Twice the young man darted in, attempting some
wrestler's hold, twice he failed, and wrenched himself away from
the other man's countering grip.</p>

<p>The Squire watched, his head on one side.</p>

<p>"Methinks if Jack once grasps him firmly my pound is done," he
observed to the man next him. "Aha!" he shouted.</p>

<p>The stranger's third attempt seemed like to have proved
disastrous to him. His bear-like antagonist had caught him in a
grip that could not be shaken off. For nearly half a minute they
strained. Then the older man's superior strength began to tell.
Beneath his smooth skin the youth's muscles strained as though they
would burst, but slowly, inch by inch, he was bent back until he
was securely held. And then powerfully and irresistibly the man
called Jack half freed one massive arm, and his hand, inch by inch,
overpowering the young man's opposition, crept upwards.</p>

<p>A lightning desperate upheaval, and the lad had twisted free and
sprung apart. He was panting slightly and for the first time his
face was aflame.</p>

<p>"He tried to gouge me!" he cried to the Squire. "Is that what
you call fair play!"</p>

<p>"And why not?" rejoined the Squire coldly. "Stand and fight, or,
if you will, cry quits."</p>

<p>The young man looked about the crowd in amazed appeal from the
decision, but was answered by derisive laughter. Its blood was up,
and it wanted blood. Still incredulous, he looked at his
antagonist. The latter grinned at him evilly.</p>

<p>"I'll do worse to ye than that, my cockerel," he growled.</p>

<p>"And is that your habit!" cried the stranger indignantly. "It is
not so on the borders when men settle honest differences."</p>

<p>"Stand and fight&mdash;or cry quits," repeated the Squire
imperturbably.</p>

<p>No man was able afterwards to describe clearly what next
happened, though many words were wasted in the matter. They saw the
young man stoop; they saw him dart in with the speed and swiftness
of a snake striking; they were confusedly aware of a tangle and
swirl; even above the turmoil of excitement they distinctly heard a
clear sharp snap like, the cracking of a dead limb. Then the young
man leaped back clear, leaving his antagonist standing, an
expression of bewilderment on his face, gazing stupidly at his left
arm which he held in his right hand.</p>

<p>"Well, suh!" the visitor challenged in a ringing voice. His head
was high, and his nostrils expanded.</p>

<p>A dead silence fell that endured for perhaps ten seconds.</p>

<p>"Will you go on?" then enquired the Squire, in a voice calm only
above a compressed excitement.</p>

<p>"Go on!" repeated Jack furiously. "How can I go on? He has
broken my arm!"</p>

<p>The stupefaction broke. The ring was instantly overwhelmed by
the surge of men, shouting, whooping. They crowded around the
stranger, pounding him on the back, shrieking in his face,
commending him, congratulating him, all on his side, fickle as
crowds always are. He thrust them aside scornfully, elbowing his
way to the burgher in whose charge he had given his garments, which
he reclaimed with a brief word of thanks, and proceeded to assume.
The Squire was at his side, red-faced and bellowing.</p>

<p>"Greatest thing I ever saw, lad!" he shouted. "You've won me
four pounds! Damme you must drink with me! Come, I will not take
nay."</p>

<p>The young man shook his head.</p>

<p>"You must excuse me, suh," he said firmly. "I must be on my way.
I thank you, suh, for yo' kindness."</p>

<p>"But how did you do it? That you must tell me," persisted the
big man. "Saw I never the like before."</p>

<p>"It was a trick," replied the stranger briefly, "a trick known
to the Injins, They use it only when hard-pressed in battle," he
added.</p>

<p>He turned away and, with an air of decision that none ventured
to cross, threaded the gaping crowd and disappeared.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>When he reentered the low dark room the great clock in the
corner was tolling the last note of another hour. The old gunmaker
dozing by the fire awakened with a start.</p>

<p>The young man slipped into a chair. "Now, suh, if you don't
mind, I've been figgerin'," said he, "on what you been tellin' me.
And I'd like to talk some more about these idees of yours. You
don't know how interestin' they are to me, suh."</p>

<p>"Surely, lad, surely," agreed the old man. He glanced
incredulously at the tall clock, now dim in the twilight.</p>

<p>"You have been long," he commented.</p>

<p>"Yes, suh," agreed his visitor apologetically. "But I would have
returned much sooner had I known the customs of yo' people
yereabouts."</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>All late afternoon and early evening the contestants and
spectators continued to pour into town. A few came in wagons; fewer
still afoot; the great majority on horseback. The inn was full to
overflowing; men bought high the privilege of making down their
beds on the floor of the less frequented public apartments. Every
private house willing to do so accommodated its visitors. At the
Big Bend the flicker of fires reflected downward from the great
river trees; and it seemed that those campers were perhaps the most
in comfort of any; for what with the revelers spilling noisily from
the tavern bar, the songs and disputations of others determined to
make the most of the rare holiday, only those of strong nerves and
placid powers of withdrawal could obtain more than fitful rest in
the village. And as the last of the night owls went to roost, and
the wearied turned on their pallets with a sigh of anticipation of
deferred rest, the small hours became murmurous with the activities
of those who must make preparation for the coming day's activities.
Then it was made known to the campers at the Bend that it would
have been well to have retired earlier; for they were fairly upon
the scene of the day's sport, and men with lanthorns moved busily
and shouted to one another as they made last preparation for the
entertainment of the crowd, which must here, upon the very spot, be
supplied with food and drink if mine host of the tavern were most
to profit. To this end long tables had been set up within bowers
thatched with straw: and now men hurried about carrying or rolling
or trundling provision of spirits and beer and ale; and others
tended fires blazing beneath great iron pots from which steamed a
most seductive savory of venison and beef stews. There was little
more sleep for the campers, but a plenty of grumbling, until the
aroma of the cooking was too much for their sharpened appetites,
and they arose and kicked together the embers of their own dying
fires and shivered slightly in the chill of dawn; and ate and were
comforted; and so, gradually, slipped into the eager vibrant
excitement of the day, and fell to discussing the leading
contestants and raising their voices in dispute and laying wagers
on the men of their choice. Nor was the element of personal
emulation crowded aside by the presence of champions: for in the
course of the day was room for many minor sweepstake events open to
all; not to speak of a number of lesser rivalries privately
arranged. And those of more modest skill staked happily their hopes
on chance, for a ball flying wild from the muzzle not too rarely
compensated for an ill aim; besides which in certain types of
matches a tyro with good luck might very well outdo an expert with
bad. There would be plenty of powder burned this day.</p>

<p>Those in the village stirred more sluggishly, groaning and
stopping their ears as the clatter of newcomers half aroused them,
slipping back less and less successfully to unconsciousness, until
at last, with a curse, they kicked aside their blankets and quilts.
But their ill nature did not outlast the moment. For some a morning
draught; for some a plunge of the head into cold water; for some
through opened casement a breath of coming morning, composed of
coolness and a streak of rose in eastern sky and the soft mourning
of doves in the trees, sufficed to bring them full into the
eagerness of anticipation. The monotonous year filed before these
pioneer people in a slow procession of gray days. Spangle days were
rare, and they savored them with an expectancy and thrill, known
nowadays only to children, not to be dimmed by smaller things. By
the time the morning light was full all men were again afoot, save
a few whose potations of the night before had been somewhat too
deep.</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p>One dwelling house in the village was, however, exempt from this
premature arousement. Protected by the soft rushing silence of
running water no noise could reach it to trouble its repose. The
mill race took all the world of sound for its own and translated it
into a lulling and grateful peace. Those within its insulation
slept tranquilly, undisturbed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless robin-song found its inmates afoot; the young man
at the call of long habit, the elder prowling about in foretaste of
what he believed was to be his long-awaited triumph. They met in
the oaken room below stairs, where they ate together at the board
table, served by a grumpy and elderly woman who the day before had
not been in evidence.</p>

<p>"Now, Don lad," advised the old gunmaker when they had finished,
"I advise ye to take ye down to the Big Bend where, I doubt not,
you will find much to see and to amuse yourself withal. The big
shooting is not until afternoon, but there will be the smaller
matches and many other doings worth your while to see."</p>

<p>"I will e'en do that, suh," agreed Don, "but come ye not
also?"</p>

<p>"Nay, lad," replied the old man cunningly. "I have seen many
such; and it is not my purpose to disclose for the common
questioning my new production. I will be there when the hour
strikes, but not before. And besides, I await John Gladden, who
comes before the time to make trial of the new rifle and to fit his
holding to its sighting."</p>

<p>"In that case, suh, I will follow your advice," said the young
man, plucking his felt hat from the peg. "When the young-un
awakens, give her my greeting."</p>

<p>"But Don!" Farsell halted him at the door. "Are you not taking
your own piece with you?"</p>

<p>"For why?" the visitor smiled quaintly. "Do you expect an attack
of the savages?"</p>

<p>"But will ye not enter in the shooting?" expostulated the
gunmaker. "Not the great match; but there will be many
others&mdash;block shoots and peg shoots and turkey shoots wherein
many will take part."</p>

<p>Don shook his head.</p>

<p>"Perchance, if your piece is not quite true, another could be
found for you in my shops," suggested Farrell. "Gladly may you have
the loan of such."</p>

<p>"My piece is as true as any," the young man assured him. He
hesitated, then went on steadily, "I had not thought to mention it,
suh, but the truth is I am travelin' through on a visit, and must
return, and my pockets are not so lined with shillings that I may
spend them on aught else but the journey."</p>

<p>'''Let me&mdash;''</p>

<p>"No, suh," Don interrupted firmly, "&mdash;but I am obleeged to
you, suh."</p>

<p>He turned toward the door. At the stairway's foot stood the
little girl, barefooted, in her night shift, her ringleted hair
towsled about her head.</p>

<p>"If you see that old Tiger, you <i>kill</i> him!" cried she.</p>

<p>For the first time the grave young stranger laughed aloud. "If I
see that old Tigah, honey," he replied, "I'll be shore to info'm
him <i>just</i> what you told me."</p>

<h3>9</h3>

<p>By the time he had reached the Big Bend the day's activities
were well under way, Don sauntered here and there, surveying them
gravely. Mostly he passed unnoticed, though here and there he was
proffered a greeting from some spectator of yesterday's fight, and
twice he was invited boisterously to come up to the tables and take
a drink as a stout lad! But he responded so gravely to the
salutations and refused the invitations so firmly that they turned
away from him without further thought.</p>

<p>The river grove and the meadow immediately adjacent were
thronged. Many jostled about the tables in the bowers, breaking
their morning's fast or fortifying themselves with ale or spirits.
Smaller and shifting groups hovered about certain peddlers who had
laid out their wares. Others clustered talking politics or crops or
religion, as was to be expected. Only a comparatively few partisans
or acquaintances had as yet gravitated to where the rifles were
already whanging away, and where hung the thin acrid fog of powder.
It was to this point, however, that Don at once betook himself. He
arrived just as one match had come to an end and the preparations
for another were about to begin.</p>

<p>On a stool behind a table sat the man Don had yesterday heard
called the Squire. The day was yet young and cool, and he wore
still his green greatcoat with the many capes. Below the table
stood a large basket filled with pine blocks split to about six
inches square and the surfaces blackened by charring. These the
Squire was engaged in passing out to would-be contestants in the
next event, selling them at the rate of sixpence apiece. As but one
shot could be fired at each block, some were buying three, four, or
as many as five. Others, either because of the slenderness of their
purses or confidence in their luck or ability, contented themselves
with but one. Each, on receiving his targets, drew apart to mark
them. This was done either by scribing deep crosslines with a
knife, or by tacking on a bit of paper or tin. The marks on the
crosslines rarely centered the block of wood, for while the prize
money would go to the man whose ball struck nearest the exact
middle, each placed his point of aim at the spot where experience
had taught him the sight should be held to compensate for the error
of his gun.</p>

<p>The range for this match was one hundred yards and each assumed
what position and took what time he pleased. If a man missed clean,
he cursed vividly or withdrew in sullen silence, leaving the
untouched target to be retrieved by an attendant Negro, for sale
and use again. If, under the bullet's impact, the block spun from
its position, he whooped and ran forward to reclaim it himself; and
was on his return immediately surrounded, all eager to examine how
near to center the ball had struck. When the last block had taken
its chance, the best were submitted to the Squire's measurement,
which determined the winner. The latter was immediately presented
with the cash prize, which was a goodly percentage of the sum
resulting from the entrance fees, the remainder constituting a
"Kitty" that went to the promotion fund of the enterprise; in this
match nearly half the targets were hit; and the winning bullet was
officially declared to have entered within two inches of
center.</p>

<p>"What think ye of that?" exulted a spectator at Den's elbow. "Is
not that a good shooting?"</p>

<p>"Why, I think it very good," agreed the young man, "and these
men can stand with the best in any company."</p>

<p>He turned away to where, from the right, came the sounds of
occasional desultory firing. Here he found men engaged in shooting
at a turkey loosely tethered at full two hundred yards. The
entrance fee was also but a six-pence; and he who hit the turkey
would take it away for his dinner; but the fact that the bird could
continually move about within a short radius, combined with the
additional fact that the range was beyond what approximate
exactness the rifles of the day possessed, made of the investment
no undue risk to the management.</p>

<p>That both contestants and bystanders realized fully the large
part played by chance was fully evidenced by the atmosphere of
hilarity. Men shouted facetious comments and advice, dissolved in
yells of laughter as a sudden movement on the part of the
distracted turkey avoided a lucky bullet. The rivals muttered
curses or voiced humorous chagrin according to their various
temperaments. One elderly man held his rifle at aim for a full two
minutes, following with his sights in vain the erratic motions of
the bird&mdash;at last lowering his arm tired with its long
exertion.</p>

<p>"Consarn the pesky critter!" he shouted in exasperation. "Hold
still, if you want to be killed!"</p>

<p>At last in desperation he loosed off anyhow, and a puff of dust
far to the right elicited only a startled squawk.</p>

<p>The mark was attained after a deal of banging by a smooth-faced
boy who raced excitedly to retrieve his prey, only to be greeted by
a great shout of laughter as he returned with it.</p>

<p>"Hope you like dark meat!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, bub, turkey hash is fine!"</p>

<p>The heavy bullet had smashed its way squarely through the middle
of the breast.</p>

<p>Don shook his head.</p>

<p>"That's a waste of good eatin'," he remarked to one near him.
"Whar I come from we just let the head stick out, and shoot at
it&mdash;at a hundred ya'ds," he added.</p>

<p>Another small and amused group attracted him further. Here he
found two men with rifles, seated on the ground. One, his piece
held in a knee and elbow rest, was painfully and patiently
squinting at a cockerel tethered a scant fifty yards distant. The
other, his rifle laid alongside him on the ground, smoked a pipe
and watched. The rooster was a noble and iridescent specimen of his
kind, a beautiful creature except for one blemish. What should have
been an abundant and sweeping tail consisted of four scattered
feathers only.</p>

<p>For some time the young visitor watched. Still the rifleman held
his fire. Don was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why delays he, suh," he asked a bystander at last. "Shorely it
is no great feat to kill the fowl at that range."</p>

<p>His interlocutor, a middle-aged man of evidently the better
class, chuckled.</p>

<p>"That is the last thing he wants to do," he replied in a low and
guarded voice.</p>

<p>"I do not understand, suh," submitted Don.</p>

<p>"Why," explained the other, "I see you are a stranger here.
Know, then, that this is a private match between two very noted
marksmen who are such rivals that I think they would very gladly
use one another as targets in a duel. E'en last night at the
tavern, and they in their cups, I think it might have come to
blows, but the Squire, who is a rare wag at times, and hath ideas
one would never suspect in so thick a noodle, bethought him of
this. The terms are these: that each man in turn plucks with his
bullet from the tail of that cockerel a feather. The one who shoots
away the last feather wins the contest and the wager they have
made. But he who by mischance slays the chicken not only loses the
match, but must double the bet."</p>

<p>The young man chuckled in his throat.</p>

<p>"Already," continued the gentleman, "they have sat there three
hours. Each has fired twice, and the cockerel still unscathed. They
are like to be there all day. What think you of that?"</p>

<p>"Why," rejoined the stranger, "I think it right good
shootin&mdash;and right good luck, suh, also."</p>

<p>The colloquy was interrupted by the resounding boom of the heavy
rifle. The chicken squawked and leaped convulsively to the end of
its tether. A tail feather whirled aloft and floated gently to the
earth. The marksman laid aside his piece with the deep sigh of
relief from long tension.</p>

<p>"Yore turn," he informed his rival curtly.</p>

<p>Beneath an arbor, and in charge of a young chap of about Don's
age, was located the official sales place for ammunition. Here were
canisters of the best French powder, both of the very fine grain
for priming the pan, and of the coarser grain for the charge in the
barrel; and clear, beautifully shaped English flints, each
guaranteed to be good for fifty shots; and frizzen pricks, plain or
ornamental; and bars of lead; and twists of unspun flax for
swabbing the bore. Besides these essentials were exhibits of other
things, brought either for sale or as samples by which to order. Of
the former were hand-forged traps; moccasins and shot pouches sewn
and decorated by the women; tomahawks fashioned by blacksmiths;
knives of various shapes and hardness of blade; powder horns
scraped so thin that the grains of powder could be seen through
their sides. This bazaar was a sort of company affair; and the
young man in charge was paid by fees from whoever had matters to
advertise or things to sell. Thus he was prepared to take orders
for the products of anyone of the half-dozen or so gunmakers of the
neighborhood, or to accept for reboring worn-down or rusted
barrels, and either to ream out the old bullet mold to fit the new
size or to supply a new mold. Between other activities he
demonstrated over and over a new invention for the kindling of
fire. This was in appearance a sort of pistol, with a very small
stock, a full-sized flintlock, and a barrel not over an inch long,
but with a huge bore fully as wide. The young man stuffed into this
barrel tight wad of unspun flax, poured a little gunpowder into the
pan, and pulled the trigger. From the muzzle he pulled the
smouldering flax and blew it to a glow. He extolled this simple
contraption highly as an immense improvement over the ordinary
flint and steel, but he sold few. The thing was expensive; and
citizens settled in houses rarely required to make new fire, for
they took good care to bank their coals. As for the backwoods
farmers, they plugged the touch hole of their rifles, placed the
flax in the pans, and got the same result. If the plug did not fit
tightly enough the maneuver might result not only in the desired
fire, but also in a badly frightened family and a bullet among the
pewter, but it worked.</p>

<p>Since it was by now approaching noon, Don next took his way to
the refreshment bower, where, after careful inquiry of prices, he
purchased a half-loaf of bread, a slice of cold venison, and a
chunk of cheese. With these he retired to sit with his back against
a post, unsheathed his knife, and set to with a hearty appetite.
For several minutes, so busy was he with his meal, he did not
overhear the conversation near him. Then he could not but become
aware that the four very solid men who sat at the table above him
were members of the same craft as his host. He could not see their
faces, but the wide broad-clothed backs presented to him were the
very sign of pompous dignity, Their talk was technical and
therefore interesting to the youngman; and he did not scruple to
listen, though rather idly, and off the surface of his attention.
It had to do with the softness and the toughness of various
charcoal irons as materials for barrels; and the relative merits of
sugar or red maplewood for stocks; and the pros and cons as to
whether it paid better to import Belgian-made locks
entire&mdash;which they acknowledged to be excellent&mdash;or to
make them at home, in which case a man knew what he had; and a
rather sneering unanimity of opinion as to some visionary who had
ideas as to the value of gain twist, which evidently had been
suggested to him by specimens of early arquebuses.</p>

<p>"There is always a fool or so thinks he can improve upon the
ripe wisdom of the craft," remarked the broadest back
contemptuously. "I have seen in my time a score such who would
overturn the world."</p>

<p>"And speaking of such, I see not Master Farrell's sour face
to-day," observed another.</p>

<p>"I deem his absence no loss to the company," pronounced
broad-back. "I doubt not he mourns in private his champion's
fall."</p>

<p>"How is that? What mean ye?" queried a third.</p>

<p>"Have ye not heard? Nay, but that is the choicest morsel of
all."</p>

<p>"I arrived but an hour since," explained the other.</p>

<p>"Why," began broad-back in the unctuous tones of one about to
retail a cozy bit of gossip, "Master Farrell, I would have you
know, had retained John Gladden to shoot for him in the great
match."</p>

<p>"Nay," rejoined the other with asperity, "that I know but too
well; for I had thought to engage him for myself."</p>

<p>"Good fortune, then, attended you," said broad-back: and paused
relishingly for the question.</p>

<p>"Good fortune? How now?" it came.</p>

<p>"Why, that this John Gladden will not hold a piece to-day, nor
yet for many days to come: and the reason is simple&mdash;that he
cannot, on account that his arm is broken in two places."</p>

<p>Don jerked back his head, his whole attention caught. Broad-back
chuckled.</p>

<p>"See ye not our good-man Farrell&mdash;" he was going on, when
he felt his shoulder seized; and, turning in outraged dignity at
the unmannerly assault, met two blazing blue eyes within a foot of
his own.</p>

<p>"Broken, you say? How happed that?" cried their owner.</p>

<p>"How now, sirrah&mdash;" But broad-back broke off his
indignation with a stare of recognition. "Meseems you should know
that," he chuckled. "For, if my eyes deceive me not, you are he
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the young man was gone.</p>

<h3>10</h3>

<p>With swift strides he threaded his way through the crowd, shook
himself free from the throng, and breaking into a long and easy
lope hastened toward the village street. But before he had gained
to the first of the houses he recognized to his left a small figure
hurrying in the opposite direction, and so changed his course to
encounter it.</p>

<p>"Have ye seen or heard aught of John Gladden?" called his host
agitatedly as he neared, "for he hath not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Master Farrell," the young man cut him short, "I think I have
unwittingly done to you the greatest disservice man has ever done
another."</p>

<p>So manifest was his distress that the gunmaker's own anxiety was
set aside.</p>

<p>"Why how can that be, lad?" he asked.</p>

<p>Almost breathlessly Don told of the incident of the two dogs and
the little girl; and of how he had been forced against his will to
take up the foolish quarrel; and of the fight in the stable yard on
account of it; and of how it fared. The old man listened
attentively.</p>

<p>"But that was well done," he commented, "and I am much beholden
to you."</p>

<p>"But that is not all, suh," insisted the young man. "So we
fought, and I do not know how it would have gone with me, for he
was very strong. At last he caught me in his grip, and
then&mdash;then, suh, he sought to gouge my eyes! I had not thought
men in fair fight would strive to maim; but he whom they called the
Squire would have it so, and those standing about called it fair
play. It is not thus with us on the border, suh; for when men
settle disputes they wrestle fairly and fight as white men fight,
not as savages do. So then I knew this was war.</p>

<p>"Yes, lad, and then?"</p>

<p>"Then, suh, I fit as a man fights in war, when his piece is
empty, and he cannot come at his tomahawk or his knife. I used a
trick long known to the Injins, and which I learned from them. By
it I broke his arm, and so the fight ended."</p>

<p>"But, lad, that was well done," the old man repeated, "and you
can take no blame to yourself for that."</p>

<p>"Nay, suh, I knew it not. I have but just now learned&mdash;" He
hesitated, in obvious distress.</p>

<p>"What, lad?" the gun maker had not yet guessed.</p>

<p>"The man was John Gladden."</p>

<p>A long silence fell while Farrell digested this information.</p>

<p>"Meseems I would gladly have lost an eye had not this
happed&mdash;" the young man faltered, but Farrell stopped him with
a peremptory gesture. "Nay," he commanded. "You could do no
different. I do not blame you. Nay, it was well done."</p>

<p>He drooped visibly nevertheless; remained for some moments in
thought; bowed his head, then straightened with an assumed
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"We must accept what fortune brings," said he.</p>

<p>"Is it too late, suh, to seek out another&mdash;" began the
young man anxiously.</p>

<p>The gunmaker cut him short with a decisive shake of the
head.</p>

<p>"The Match is even now about to be called," said he, "and every
marksman worth the name is long since bespoke. Nor would I place
the piece in the hands of any less."</p>

<p>They stood there facing one another, the younger man almost
wringing his hands in distress; the older contemplating the ground
in a brown study. Suddenly he straightened.</p>

<p>"I have it!" he cried. "You shall take his place!"</p>

<p>"I, suh!" stammered the stranger, taken aback.</p>

<p>"Even you," stated the old man with decision. "You can do no
less."</p>

<p>"But, suh," expostulated Don, "I am not fitten to stand with
these men. I would not do ye a further disservice. I am not
practised in these affairs. I care not for myself, but the new
piece, suh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough!" the old man cut him short with authority. "If I am
willing, how should you draw back?"</p>

<p>"But you know not that my aim is true."</p>

<p>"I watched you last even as you handled the piece to your cheek.
I marked you well, and I will stake my chances on your skill. Come,
I ask it. You can do no less."</p>

<p>"If you are set upon it, I can but make the trial," agreed the
young man, hesitating and troubled.</p>

<p>"I am set upon it."</p>

<p>"I can but do my best," then said he. The volatile old man, his
spirits popping up like a balloon, leaped into the air and cracked
his heels together twice.</p>

<p>"That's my lad!" he cried heartily. "And now we must haste; for
an we be not there to answer when the match is called, we shall
lose our place."</p>

<p>He trotted back in the direction of his house, his very gait
bouncing into a confidence evidently not shared by the troubled
youth following at his heels. At the house Farrell carefully
wrapped the new rifle in a blanket. "They shall see no sight of it
afore the time," he babbled, thrusting the muffled piece into the
lad's hands. "And now let us see: here is the great powder horn,
and the smaller with priming; and here is the stock of balls, and
not one flawed one among them; and spare flints; yes, and a stout
frizzen prick; and patches and grease in the butt&mdash;all is
here: let us hasten back."</p>

<p>"But, suh," expostulated Don, "have I no chance to fire the
piece first that I may test my holding?"</p>

<p>"No time now; no time," returned the old man testily. "Come,
hasten; or even yet we may be too late!"</p>

<p>"That is a hard task you place on me, suh," observed the
stranger, but more in comment than complaint.</p>

<p>"Hold a fine sight," panted the gunmaker as he trotted along,
"hold fine, and dead center. Allow for no error; merely hold
true."</p>

<p>The young man sighed resignedly.</p>

<p>"And the trigger pull, suh?" he suggested. "I have not even the
feel of that."</p>

<p>"You will find it smooth as a hound's tooth," rejoined the
other, "so that a baby's touch would suffice to trip the hammer,
There is but one thing to watch. In your loading see that you
center the ball on the patch, for if it be to one side or the other
by any great span, the ball will not fly quite so true."</p>

<h3>11</h3>

<p>At the Bend all firing had ceased. Even the two men still
patiently engaged in plucking with their bullets the cockerel's
tail had been ordered to desist; and that demoralized fowl was
enjoying a respite and the continued possession of two widely
separated feathers. The concourse, which now numbered almost every
available human being, was held back of a designated line by men
whose official position was advertised by a white handkerchief
bound about the left arm. The open space in front was occupied only
by the table at which still sat the Squire, flanked by two
assistants. But even as Farrell and his guest&mdash;the former
somewhat out of breath&mdash;reached the outskirts, one of the
assistants arose and cried out a name in a great bull voice that
could have been heard in the village street. A man whom Don
recognized as broad-back, pushed forward; at his elbow a small
unobtrusive fellow chewing tobacco nonchalantly and carrying a
rifle which, even from a distance, could plainly be distinguished
as brand-new and of fine workmanship. The two took their places to
the left of the table.</p>

<p>"We are but just in time," observed Farrell, removing his hat
and mopping his brow. "They call the contestants. That is Master
Detrick, the gunmaker from Lancaster, and the small man with him is
Mark Dall who will fire for him."</p>

<p>But now the announcer was calling other names; and other men
were coming forward in response. Unlike the more impromptu and
lesser matches of the earlier part of the day, the entries for this
Great Match had been all made and paid for and closed the day
previous: and there remained now but the formality of reading the
entrants from the list. So it went until fourteen men had taken
their places, of whom five were gunmakers standing only in the role
of sponsors, five their hired champions, and the other four free
lances competing on their own for their chance at the "great fat
ox" and the snap haunce gun and the glory. Then the announcer sat
down.</p>

<p>"How now! How now!" cried Farrell, breaking through the cordon.
"Find ye not my name on your list?"</p>

<p>The Squire slowly turned his great bulk to survey the
speaker.</p>

<p>"And is it you, Master Farrell!" he exclaimed in surprise. He
turned his eyes toward Detrick. "But of a certain it is here, and
you are welcome."</p>

<p>"Then why was I not called?" indignantly demanded the
gunmaker.</p>

<p>"We were informed," said the Squire slowly, "that you had
withdrawn." He continued to stare at Detrick, until the latter
stirred uneasily and muttered:</p>

<p>"It is known to all that John Gladden lies abed and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You take much upon yourself, sir!" interrupted Farrell,
hotly.</p>

<p>"Peace, gentlemen!" commanded the Squire with authority, "Your
name is here, Master Farrell. You will yourself shoot your
match?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I have a man for that."</p>

<p>"His name?"</p>

<p>"Don&mdash;nay, I know not the rest. Where is the pesky lad?"
Farrell searched vainly with his eyes in the shifting crowd.</p>

<p>"Put him down as Master Don," the Squire told the recorder.
"Time passes. Your man fires last," he instructed Farrell. "See
that he is here."</p>

<p>The first test was at one hundred yards. The targets were the
six-inch wooden blocks already described. The number of shots,
five. Each man was to fire once in rotation until the tally was
complete.</p>

<p>Detrick's champion was called upon. The little man, still
chewing his tobacco, stepped calmly forward. His piece was already
charged, so all he had to do by way of preparation was to shake the
priming powder into the pan. Any position was allowed, so Dall
disposed himself deliberately with muzzle and elbow rest, aimed
carefully for what seemed a very long time, and fired. His block
spun backward as the heavy bullet smashed into it. Dall arose
deliberately and withdrew to the background, where he at once set
about an elaborate cleaning of his piece. One by one the other
contestants took their turn.</p>

<p>The majority followed his example in selecting the muzzle and
elbow rest as the most certain; though one man lay prone; and one
other sat, his elbows clamped between his knees. Of the nine, seven
registered hits; and a murmur of admiration swept the spectators,
for this was marvelous percentage. The location of the hits would
not be determined until later: which delay enhanced the dramatic
suspence.</p>

<p>"Master Don, firing for Master Farrell," called the
announcer.</p>

<p>Farrell slapped the young man on the back and pushed him
forward.</p>

<p>"God be with ye, lad," he muttered.</p>

<p>He was shifting from one foot to the other nervously, and he was
breathing sharply; but Don seemed unconcerned. He walked forward to
the mark carrying the long rifle at trail, woodsman fashion. A wave
of excited comment rose. Men's interest was caught by the strange
appearance of the new weapon.</p>

<p>"Look at the length of that bar'l," they murmured to one
another. "What think you is in the hinged boxes in the butt?"</p>

<p>"Flints," suggested another.</p>

<p>Farrell suppressed a cry of anguish, for Don, instead of
disposing himself in anyone of the several positions that afforded
a steadying rest, had squared to his shot standing upright on his
two feet. And barely, it seemed, had the muzzle reached the level
when, without perceptible pause for aim, as it seemed, the piece
was discharged.</p>

<p>The excited babel was now full-voiced, for there was much to
say.</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose the damn fool knows he don't have to shoot
off-hand?"</p>

<p>"He didn't hardly take no aim at all!"</p>

<p>"Must have a ha'r trigger and she went off on him accidental,"
surmised one sagely. And everybody commented on the salient
phenomenon of the whole performance; the sharp whip-like crack of
the discharge, in arresting contrast to the full roar of the other
rifles. The fact that the block of wood had been struck was
unremarked, unimportant, dismissed as a lucky accident that could
not recur in the same conditions.</p>

<p>"Lad! Lad!" agonized Farrell, as the young man returned to his
side. "Be not so hasty and so rash! Get ye a steady rest, and
assure your aim better!"</p>

<p>Don dropped the butt of the long rifle to the ground and
prepared to reload.</p>

<p>"Nay, suh," he returned tranquilly. "I have never la'rned these
fancy tricks. I must e'en do as I may; and my schooling has been in
the forests. An I dwell upon my aim or seek a spot whereon to rest
my piece I am like to lose either my dinner or my scalp."</p>

<p>"Think you you can hit the mark again?" asked Farrell
anxiously.</p>

<p>"That we shall see in good time," replied Don. "But this I will
say." His grave face lighted for, an instant with a rare
enthusiasm. "Never have I held a piece so sweet to the hand; never
have I pulled trigger so smooth to the touch; never have I looked
across sights so clear to the eye. And if the ball speeds as true
as the rifle holds, why, then, suh, without wishin' to boast, I may
say that I will knock over those bits of wood as long as men will
cut 'em fo' me!"</p>

<p>Suddenly he lapsed into an embarrassed silence.</p>

<p>"I babble overmuch," he muttered, and went on loading.</p>

<p>The second round proceeded with no more than the usual cries of
encouragement and comment. But when the young stranger again
methodically took his place, and with the same absence of delay
proceeded to spin his second block of wood from its resting place,
the noise rose to a pandemonium, and the guards found difficulty in
holding back the surge of the crowd.</p>

<p>Farrell was hopping about with joy, and the young man himself
showed symptoms of excitement. But it was the excitement of a
growing interest and enthusiasm, not of nervousness, against which
now his patron was frantically urging him to beware. At last Don
stopped him with a good-humored laugh.</p>

<p>"I will do my possible, suh," he reassured the old man. "And I
think you need not be afeard, for yore billets carry neither arrows
nor fusees, nor are they like to run away."</p>

<p>The five rounds finished at last and in an excitement that
constantly grew, for never had the like been seen before. Men told
one another that they were present at the greatest shooting match
ever known. All records had gone by the board. For of the fifty
shots delivered, thirty-seven had found the mark, which in itself
was enough to make history. And of the thirty-seven hits, five must
be accredited to the young stranger! He had not once missed!</p>

<p>This alone was sufficient to set men's tongues clacking with
amazement. But still remained the decision, for the award must go
to him whose ball had struck closest to dead center, and all
awaited the announcement from the table on which the attendant
Negro had piled the basket-ful of billets he had gathered up. Each
had been marked with the name of its owner, of course, and the
Squire and his assistants sorted them out and laid them aside for
examination, and the contestants and their sponsors gathered close
about, awaiting his verdict. At last the Squire looked up, and his
broad face was amazed.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, holding up one of the blocks, and it could
be seen that the ball had cut almost into the cross itself, "Here
is the winning shot, and a good one it is. But, gentlemen, here are
the others that come nearest."</p>

<p>He exhibited one after the other four other targets, and of them
all the farthest ball had centered not over three inches from
perfection. "That is good shooting; each one of these is worthy of
a prize, for never in the long years of my life have I seen the
like!" He slowly arose to his full height, and his rubicund face
was overspread with an emotion that was close to awe. "And this I
must tell you, that these balls, one and all, were delivered by the
same hand!" His face broke into a broad grin as he turned to
Farrell. "Methinks," said he, "fate did you a shrewd good turn that
this young man stood for you in the stead of Gladden. As for you,
my lad, you shoot as well as you fight&mdash;or you fight as well
as you shoot, I know not how to say it."</p>

<p>"It is the rifle," stated Don modestly. "Never was piece made
that shot so true."</p>

<p>"A man cannot win at cards without an ace," agreed the Squire.
"And of the rifle, more anon: for I confess myself curious to
examine it. Natheless the holding was better than I have seen. But
to your places, gentlemen. It waxeth toward evening, and we must
finish. Announcer, call the list for the peg shot."</p>

<h3>12</h3>

<p>Fortunately for our belief in this chronicle, records, both
ancient and modern, are here to sustain us. Otherwise we could not
be blamed for dismissing the whole story with a shrug. So
convinced&mdash;and justly so&mdash;have we become of the
superiority of our modern high-velocity rifles, that we have ended
by unduly depreciating the old-fashioned arms, but especially the
flintlocks dealt with in this our tale. Our impression of them is
that they were slow to load, clumsy to handle, dilatory in fire,
and of only approximate accuracy. Or if we admit accuracy at all,
it is only within the limits of a very short "squirrel range." As a
matter of fact, we are in general very skeptical of even that much;
suffering, I suppose, from a reaction against Fenimore Cooper's
impossible absurdities.</p>

<p>But in sober earnest these impressions are libels upon an
excellent weapon; and many of them, as accusations against its
efficiency, must fall to the ground. That the old long rifles were
not clumsy, a moment's handling will convince any experienced
rifleman, if he can get hold of a good specimen. That the
flintlock, when properly constructed, in good condition, and with
the best flint suitably edged and sharpened, is, so far as the
marksman can tell, as fast as a percussion lock is surprising but
true.</p>

<p>"With regard to the interval between the flash pan and the
explosion," writes Captain Dillin, "actual tests under the most
exacting conditions have proved that it is so trifling as to be
negligible; that there is no time to flinch and therefore no bad
deliveries." He describes then the proper loading and priming, and
goes on. "Hangfires and missfires are unknown under these
conditions, and having had a wide experience with both flintlock
and percussion, the author hesitates to give the claim of
superiority to the latter system." And fortunately for our
curiosity as respects the remaining point&mdash;accuracy&mdash;we
need here depend on no mere legends. In ancient bullet pouches have
been found many targets, tucked away there by their owners,
probably after a successful shooting match. And in our own times a
few perfect specimens of these old rifles have been tested by our
modern experts. I have seen a few of the former; and the results of
a number of the latter tests are before me as I write. At one
hundred yards from the muzzle, and of course from a dead rest,
three successive shots were so closely grouped that a five-cent
piece was large enough to touch all three; three more from the same
rifle&mdash;named "Old Killdeer," by the way&mdash;repeated this;
and two other groups of three each could be covered by a silver
half-dollar and a dollar respectively. Another arm of similar type
made five straight bull's-eyes at the same range; placed six
bullets in succession inside a dollar at fifty yards; and of five
bullets at twenty-five yards four cut into the same hole and the
fifth was but three sixteenths of an inch outside. Captain Dillin
quotes from an assistant to one of the old rifle makers, who said:
"No gun ever suited him unless it was capable of driving a tack
three times out of five at fifty yards."</p>

<p>While one hundred yards might be adopted arbitrarily as about
the limit of this delicate accuracy, that by no means marked the
effective limit of the gun, especially in war. Old Killdeer, at two
hundred yards, placed five balls which could be included in a
rectangle five by seven and a half inches; which is good grouping
for any modern arm, except such precisionists as the high-velocity
type. Careful tests at the standard silhouette man target gave ten
straight hits at two hundred; and five out of ten at three hundred.
"And," reports the man who made the tests, "the penetration from
any of these rifles at three hundred yards, and even beyond that
distance, was sufficient to kill, or put out of action, anyone
hit."</p>

<p>So we see that the commanding advantage of such weapons as the
modern Springfield, as practical arms within the limits desired by
the old-timers, lies largely in their speed; and that we cannot
dismiss as apocryphal the tales of accuracy that have come down to
us from old times.</p>

<h3>13</h3>

<p>The Squire's command to proceed with the next stage of the Great
Match was delayed in obedience to a storm of vigorous protest on
the part of Detrick, backed by his fellow craftsmen, who demanded
that this new-fangled contraption be excluded from competition. The
basis of the protest seemed to be a vague "unfairness." But the
Squire, grinning in relish over the situation, brushed this
aside.</p>

<p>"Nay, my masters," he observed, with fundamental common sense,
"I see nought of unfairness here. This is a contest of rifles; and
while this new piece of Master Farrell's is of unusual appearance,
and most certainly of unusual performance&mdash;and I confess
myself curious to examine it further&mdash;it is most indubitably a
rifle. Continue."</p>

<p>In the course of the subsequent proceedings the crowd fell from
its vociferous excitement to a low buzz of attention that,
strangely enough, seemed to have in its elements a strong compound
of something curiously like awe. Or perhaps not so strangely.
Possibly they felt across the occasion the shadow of greatness;
realizing dimly in the instinctive parts of themselves that they
assisted at one of those significant events that turn the currents
of history. As why not? For in the chronicles of their country the
patched ball and the grooved barrel were to play a great part and
the sharp crack of the American rifle was destined to call them
into far places.</p>

<p>The matches that succeeded were in no true sense contests, and
need not here be described in what would prove wearisome detail. In
the peg match each man fired five shots at seventy-five yards. Pegs
were inserted in the bullet holes, and around the outside a string
was stretched.</p>

<p>He who had the shortest string was pronounced the winner. Of the
others, the man Dall turned in one of nine and five eighths inches,
which was commented upon as close to a record; but Don's measured
but a scant five, and one shot a trifle out. And even in the
loading contest, which was a matter of speed and personal
dexterity, the patched ball so advantaged Farrell's arm that Don
reported ready in the astounding time of twenty seconds, (These
figures are actual measured records.) which far outdid his nearest
competitor.</p>

<p>It was a clean sweep, and nobody awaited the Squire's formal
announcement of the winner. The instant the Match had closed, the
crowd swarmed about Farrell, eager to examine the new weapon, to
hear the principles of its miraculous precision. The marksman,
Dall, was the first to get his hands upon it, turning it over and
over, his shrewd expert's eye noting its features, his ear cocked
to Farrell's explanations.</p>

<p>"You must e'en make me one of these, Master Farrell," said he at
the last. "I bespeak one now."</p>

<p>"And I!"</p>

<p>"And I!" interposed several others.</p>

<p>It was the little gunmaker's great moment. He was the center of
all attention, speaking his piece over and over again to changing
audiences who listened to him with the keen and intelligent
attention that men would now bestow on the impossible him who might
suddenly bring forth a club that could never fail of a
three-hundred-yard drive. Detrick and his fellow artisans stood
apart in a disgruntlement that tried unsuccessfully for an air of
disdain. Don, also apart, received likewise his share, though
lesser, of the attention. Men's eagerest interest centered for the
moment&mdash;and practically so&mdash;more on the possibilities of
the new weapon for themselves than on the feats they had witnessed.
A few praised his marksmanship; but most pressed him for his
impressions of the rifle; its trigger pull, its sights, its powder
charge and the weight of the ball, and the secrets of its loading.
The young man replied as best he could, but always in modest
repudiation of his own part.</p>

<p>"Nay, sirs," he insisted, "ye must award the day to Master
Farrell, not to me. For these others be noted marksmen, as you well
know; and with this same rifle any one of them, or indeed any other
man who is skilled to hold a piece, could have done as well, or
better."</p>

<p>But at last the concourse began to thin. The sun was low and the
air was cooling. Long flights of crows crossed the redness of the
skies. Negroes and other servants were collecting together the
various gear that had been used for the different purposes and were
piling it in a wagon. Lines of men streamed across the fields
toward the tavern's cheer. Here and there in the village shone
lights in windows.</p>

<p>Farrell, freed at last, joined his guest, and the two turned
toward home. The little gunmaker was still so excited that he
fairly babbled. The young man strode silently at his side,
listening.</p>

<p>"Did ye note their glum faces, lad!" cried Farrell. "And did ye
see how their own very champions left them apart to come to me! And
did you remark how each of them jumped to possess one of my rifles:
nay, and gave order for them on the spot! I must hasten to write
down their names, so that I shall not disappoint them! And," the
old man chuckled triumphantly, "the matter that warms my heart the
most is that now, will they, nill they, these stiff-necked
obstinate fools must themselves make arms of my
pattern&mdash;unless they would sell only to farmers and the like!
That will grind their haughty souls. For, lad, you shall see, all
the world shall now use the long grooved barrel and the patched
ball; for the old style is past and gone, and ye shall soon see
them only on the walls to be viewed by the curious, as one looks
upon the arquebuses of ancient days!"</p>

<p>Which was in the main an excellent bit of soothsaying; though
Master Farrell overlooked the asinine conservatism of government
officialdom, or his prophetic eye would have seen the troops of
otherwise progressive nations banging away with smooth-bore slugs a
hundred years after.</p>

<p>But soon he turned his psean of exultation. "And you, lad!" he
cried. "You were magnificent! Never have I seen any man who held
so; and I have seen many of the best. You beat all records; as well
I know, for I know them all."</p>

<p>"Nay, suh," repeated Don. "Any man who could hold a bar'l could
have done the like. If so happed I beat records, as you say, it was
because never on range before was fired a bar'l that shot so
true."</p>

<p>"That is so. Natheless I do maintain, and always shall, that
none could have done as well. Some might have done its equal from a
rest, but none in my knowledge could have done so offhand."</p>

<p>The youth flushed with a pleasure he could not conceal.</p>

<p>"I am obleeged to you fo' your good opinion, suh," said he
steadily. "And I am rejoiced if you deem I have been of service to
you."</p>

<p>"Richly do you deserve the prize!" cried Farrel.</p>

<p>"Anon?" queried Don.</p>

<p>"The prize, lad," repeated the gunmaker. "Did you not realize it
is yours?"</p>

<p>"Nay, suh. I but stood in your stead."</p>

<p>"Mine is the gold medal of the craft. Nay, do not protest. It
goes to you according to established rule."</p>

<p>The young man stopped in his tracks.</p>

<p>"And what, suh," he enquired with quiet humor, "should I do with
a 'great fat ox'? Drive it afore me on my journey?"</p>

<p>Farrell laughed appreciatively.</p>

<p>"I doubt not the matter may be compounded for a sum," said he.
"I will charge myself with that. And I shall insist you take the
further sum I would have paid John Gladden. That is but just."</p>

<p>"Why, suh," said Don, "I will not gainsay you but this is a
welcome surprise, for the thought had not occurred to me, and I
admit my purse is but slender."</p>

<p>"It is nought, nought!" cried Farrell. "And were it thrice as
much I should still be in your debt; for were it not for this happy
chance I would even yet be suffering scorn, and now I shall prosper
greatly, for all men will desire a rifle of Farrell's make,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He in his turn stopped short in the illumination of a sudden
idea. He thrust the rifle, which he had been carrying, into the
young man's hands.</p>

<p>"This is yours!" said he.</p>

<p>"Mine?" repeated Don, incredulously;</p>

<p>"Whose the better right? Nay, protest not; I shall not
listen."</p>

<p>A slow flush overspread the youth's face; then drained away,
leaving it almost pale.</p>

<p>"Gainsay me not!" commanded the gunmaker peremptorily. "I shall
make scores, nay hundreds more; and all because of you."</p>

<p>"I cannot refuse you, suh," replied the young man in a low
voice, "for I will confess that ever since I first pulled trigger
at the Shooting my heart has been eaten with the desire for one
such. But I know not how to tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No need, lad; no need!" Farrell interrupted, his face glowing
with pleasure. "And with it shall go molds for balls, and a horn
thin as paper and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, suh, you overwhelm me!" expostulated Don.</p>

<p>His head was up, and his eyes were far away. "I shall try to do
it honor, suh," said he slowly, "and I can see it is to stand me in
good stead, for I shall take it with me over the mountains to the
west, where even now I am preparing to go."</p>

<p>"Over the mountains?"</p>

<p>"Into the land known as Kentucky, suh, where, save for John
Finley, no man has trod."</p>

<p>"And the work of my hands shall be carried into new and strange
lands!" exulted the gunmaker. "And what could better befall, for
itself is new and strange! And so shall I share in a great
undertaking! And," he cried, inspired, "so shall we name it, so
that men forever shall speak of the Kentucky Rifle!" He reached his
hand and took the weapon from the young man's grasp. "See, right
here, I shall set it down, in fair engraved letters, your name and
mine together. That I shall do before you depart. But I know you
only as Don. What is your surname?"</p>

<p>The young man looked a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>"No, suh, my name is not Don," he confessed. "You misheard me;
and I did not trouble to set you right."</p>

<p>"Not Don? What is it then?" rejoined the other.</p>

<p>"Dan, suh," said the young man. "Dan'l Boone."</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-1" id="ch1-1"></a>CHAPTER 1. The Grandmother</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>ON A rock by a roadside sat Andrew Burnett. The season was early
spring: that time when the snow water is but just draining away,
the red-winged blackbirds are new arrived in melody, and the wide
washed sky is ahum with the vigor of fresh joy in the world.
Nevertheless the lad's expression was somber, his eyes smoldered
with a sullen resentment well emphasized by his straight black
eyebrows that almost met over the bridge of his nose. He was
thinking what a hard time he was having in life; and how
downtrodden he was; and what&mdash;in the somewhat hazy
future&mdash;he was going to do about it. This was not an unusual
state of mind for his age, which was nineteen.</p>

<p>He was entirely absorbed. He did not hear the liquid-voiced
blackbirds and meadow larks. He did not see the red squirrel that
chirked and jerked toward him along the rails of the zigzag "snake"
fence. He was even wholly unaware of a horseman galloping
recklessly through the puddles, until a shower of mud brought him
to his feet. He flared into furious resentment; unreasonable, for
it was self-evident the horseman was innocent of intention, but
natural as the leap of his discontent toward an outlet.</p>

<p>"Look what you're doing, you dirty whelp!" he shouted.</p>

<p>The horse was thrown on its haunches; turned; walked slowly
back: brought to a stand. The rider leaned forward in his
saddle.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" he challenged softly.</p>

<p>His appearance further inflamed the other's anger.</p>

<p>His clothing was of fine quality and in the height of prevailing
fashion; his mount was self-evidently an animal of blood; the very
expression of his finely featured, faintly disdainful face, the
lift of his long, white hands raised the bristles on the country
boy's contempt for the city macaroni. The fact that the stranger
was also a lad, apparently not far from his own age, helped not at
all.</p>

<p>Andrew repeated his sentiment.</p>

<p>"You tom fool, how could I see you, sitting there like a bump on
a log!" retorted the horseman.</p>

<p>This was not unreasonable; but Andrew was in no mood for reason.
He expanded his original idea. The city boy leaped nimbly from his
horse. They fought whole-heartedly. Andrew was obviously the
stronger: the stranger's quickness and certainty of movement
equalized matters. They inflicted some damage on one another;
thrashed about considerably; finally locked and went to earth. The
horse trotted away, his reins dangling. The combatants struggled a
moment or so without perceptible advantage to either, rolled down
the low bank, and plumped into a puddle. The icy shock of the water
tore them apart. They arose dripping. Andrew, his dogged slow
spirit catching its fuel fully, was in dash to resume. But the
other was laughing.</p>

<p>"We're a sweet pair!" he cried. "Now why in tarnation were we
both so cross? I'm not usually a crochety person. Are you?"</p>

<p>Andrew stopped his mouth falling open. This was too abrupt for
one of his disposition.</p>

<p>"Or <i>are</i> you?" enquired the other. "I don't believe it.
'Tain't reasonable. I didn't see you, you know. And why should I go
off at half cock? That ain't reasonable either. Of course you were
startled. Don't blame you."</p>

<p>"I take back the 'dirty whelp,'" conceded Andrew gruffly.</p>

<p>"Never mind about the 'dirty,'" amended the other.</p>

<p>He glanced down humorously at his dripping finery, "And I take
back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind the 'tom fool,'" interposed Andrew.</p>

<p>"Reckon we're a pair of them."</p>

<p>"So that's all right. My name is Russell Braidwood. I live in
Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"Mine is Andy Burnett. I live at the farm yonder, up the
lane."</p>

<p>"Well, what made you so cross?" enquired Russell.</p>

<p>"I'm sick of the farm," replied Andy, falling somber again.</p>

<p>"The same with me."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I'm sick of Philadelphia."</p>

<p>They sat together on the rock. The warm spring sun steamed from
their drenched garments. Overfield the blackbirds and the meadow
larks distilled its brightness into song. A first bobolink
overflowed its rapture. Drop after rapid drop small water tinklings
drained away the last of winter from the world. The red squirrel
curved the sweep of his tail over his back and clasped his little
hands to his head in an ecstatic worship of the fresh flood of life
in the springtime. Of these things the two lads, absorbed in one
another, had no consciousness; but now in the new expansiveness of
feeling they flooded in.</p>

<p>Why was Andy sick of the farm? Well, there was his stepfather,
who was harsh and stern in religion, and rigid in discipline, and
strong for the duty youth owed to those who had brought it into the
world.</p>

<p>"Only he did not bring me into the world," interpolated
Andy.</p>

<p>"Your mother?" asked Russell.</p>

<p>"My mother is dead," replied Andy briefly.</p>

<p>But that might be borne, and the hard, iron, grinding, endless
work, and the lack of all amusement so necessary to youth. It was
the future, the dull gray appalling future. The same thing over and
over. And for what? A living, hardly wrung. And at the end of life
the acres still demanding, still grudging, and the bent back of
age, and possibly resignation. Like iron walls pressing in closer
and closer.</p>

<p>Why not break away from it?</p>

<p>"There's my grandmother. You do not know my grandmother. I can't
desert her. And anyway I'm not of age. He wouldn't let me go. I'm
too valuable to him," said Andy bitterly. "The only reason I'm here
now is because he's gone to town for the day. You don't know him,
either."</p>

<p>It was all very black. To youth two years until the coming of
age was forever. To youth the inevitable passing away of age does
not occur.</p>

<p>But Russell? How could he be sick of Philadelphia? A great city;
leisure; amusement; money in his pocket; fine clothes; a horse to
ride; position; family: the silver spoon in the mouth? This was
difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Russell's bright face darkened. He brushed these things aside.
How did they count when one is in prison? In prison to position.
Doing the same things over and over. One sickens of them, no matter
how they glitter. In prison all one's life; sitting inside a cage
while the world flashes by outside.</p>

<p>"They are set on my going into the Business, won't hear of
anything else!" he cried bitterly, "Great-grand-father started the
bank, and the Family have carried it on ever since. Sitting in an
office at a desk. Just the same as being locked in by a jailer.
God, I hate it! Next year: that's when my term begins!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you just break away?" Andy repeated the question that
had been asked himself.</p>

<p>"I can't. There's the family. You don't know the family."</p>

<p>They contemplated their several hopelessness; and the world
deepened to deep gloom in which the blackbirds, and the meadow
larks, and the single bobolink, and the sunshine and the little
water tinklings were not. As for the red squirrel, he had gone
away.</p>

<p>"Hullo," cried Russell, making a belated discovery. "My horse is
gone!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," Andy reassured him. "This is our lane to
the barn. We'll find him at the gates. Come on up to the house and
we'll catch him."</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>They trudged to the end of the lane: found the horse against the
gates: led him through.</p>

<p>"You must come in to see my grandmother," urged Andy.</p>

<p>"I can't; I'm too filthy," objected Russell; then, seeing some
urgency on the part of his new friend, he agreed. "All right. If
she can stand it, I can."</p>

<p>They left the horse tied to a rail. The farmhouse was of the
prosperous order, square, unornamented, relieved from being a box
by six white columns that upheld a veranda roof above the second
story. Its paint was old; but the structure was in repair. About it
were remnants of what must have been a cherished garden; but these
remnants were well attended. The picket fence was upright and
intact. Before the front door stood two great locust trees. Behind
the back door was an apple orchard and the long armed sweep of a
well. Russell's vivid imagination, darting in the speculation it
loved, brought him its findings: efficiency; tidy, careful
efficiency; no thought of the ornamentation of life; only in the
garden an awkward fumbling effort to preserve the memory, as it
were, of a beauty whose full body had followed its vanished
creator. He stopped appreciatively at a lilac bush, touching with
sensitive finger its new buds.</p>

<p>"I like the soft feel," he explained.</p>

<p>"It used to be a nice garden&mdash;when my mother was alive,"
said Andy. "Most of the flowers are gone now. I work on it a little
when I get time; but I can't do much. Grandmother likes it."</p>

<p>Russell raised his eyes and became aware of a little old lady in
a rocking chair behind a front window. He swept his hat from his
head in the approved flourish of the period. A moment later he
stood before her, bowing again, and conscious of an amused scrutiny
under which, in spite of himself, he felt his color rising. Though
possessed of charmingly open qualities, and though nothing of a
snob, Russell was nevertheless an aristocrat both by breeding and
by the training of his day, which emphasized social differences
even more strongly than is at present the case. That he should not
find himself perfectly at ease in superiority before any old
countrywoman was, in the harmless arrogance of his young
conception, beyond his thought.</p>

<p>She was a little old lady, sitting in a Boston rocker. She wore
a cap, very neat; and a voluminous black dress of heavy silk, and
cobwebby half mitts of silk lace, and a pair of black satin soft
shoes side by side on a hassock. Her only ornament was a cameo
brooch at her throat. Her lap held knitting. On the floor at her
side lay an ebony cane topped with ivory. The Boston rocker was
uncushioned, and in it she sat uncompromisingly upright as one who
sits in state; though not with rigidity but rather with the repose
of energy. As Russell, raising his head from his bow of
introduction, looked upon her thin, wax-like veined hands, and the
sad lines of past care in her tiny face, he thought to himself that
he had never seen anyone so old, and a certain choke of pathos
gripped his throat. As he met the snap and twinkle of her eyes, he
thought he had never met anyone so unquenchably and agelessly
young; so that pity became an affront, and any thought of pathos an
impertinence. And as Russell, though sensitive to impression, was
as yet too young for analysis, he ended by standing before her at
ill-ease, like an awkward schoolboy, conscious and ashamed of his
muddied garments and his general dishevelment.</p>

<p>But his ill-ease soon melted. Neither by look nor manner, save
for a momentary deep twinkle in her eyes, did the old lady seem
aware of the strange disarray of the two. The twinkle was amused,
but it vanished unseen. To his astonishment, when he paused to
think of it, Russell shortly found himself seated at her elbow
chatting eagerly and easily, as to an equal not only in convention
but in years, laughing delightedly over her quick pithy comments,
sometimes caustic in content, but welling from the relish of a deep
quiet humor that mellowed them to a shared understanding that had
no sting.</p>

<p>Russell was of the vivacious and romantic disposition that
expands under warmth. The old lady, tapping her Boston rocker into
brisk motion, listened and questioned; and Russell glowed and
chattered and had a wonderful youthful time telling about himself,
secure in the comfort of some deep inner instinct that assured him
that he would not later come-to, as was so often the case, to look
upon himself in reaction as a talkative fool.</p>

<p>As he talked he looked about him at the furnishings of the old
room, and his eye fell upon a weapon on pegs over the fireplace. He
checked what he was saying.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful piece!" he cried. "May I look at it? I love
guns. All kinds of guns. They are a sort of passion with me."</p>

<p>"Bring it here, Andy," commanded the grandmother.</p>

<p>Russell handled the weapon reverently.</p>

<p>"Do you mind?" he begged, and put it to his face in the attitude
of aim.</p>

<p>"I see you are a marksman also," observed the old lady. "You and
Andy should match skill."</p>

<p>"I should love to try it&mdash;the rifle, I mean. It is in
beautiful condition. But it is very old, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I'll back it against anything newer," interposed Andy
gruffly.</p>

<p>Russell turned the weapon over, examining its details. He looked
up suddenly, a slight awe in his eyes.</p>

<p>"This inscription&mdash;" he stammered&mdash;"is it&mdash;was it
really?"</p>

<p>"Colonel Boone's rifle? Yes," the old lady answered. "He gave it
to my husband just before he left Kentucky for the West."</p>

<p>"Did you know Daniel Boone, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Certainly." She paused, then went on in response to Russell's
unspoken pleading. "You see, as a girl I rode over the Wilderness
Road into Kentucky to join Colonel Boone's enterprise. I lived at
Boonesborough until my husband died."</p>

<p>"Were you at the great fight at Boonesborough?" enquired Russell
breathlessly.</p>

<p>The old lady let her knitting fall in her lap. She leaned
against the back of her chair and her eyes softened in
reminiscence.</p>

<p>"Yes: though I saw little of it. We women were busy within,
cooking, carrying water to the men, molding bullets, tending the
wounded."</p>

<p>Under urging she told more: nine days of bitter siege, the
garrison so small that it must stand to arms day and night, the men
gaunt and haggard from the strain, showers of burning arrows, fire,
no water to spare, the roof swept by a hail of bullets.</p>

<p>"The British had supplied them with ammunition," said she. "The
men said they picked up a hundred and twenty-five pounds of
flattened bullets after the siege, and that takes no count of those
imbedded in the logs."</p>

<p>The fort seemed doomed. Then a young man sprang to the roof and
worked fully exposed to extinguish the fire.</p>

<p>"The Lord sustained us," observed the old lady piously. "For in
all that hail of bullets he was not touched."</p>

<p>Shortly after this it became necessary for the women to take
their places at the port holes to relieve the men for a brief rest.
The limit of human endurance had been reached.</p>

<p>"So I fired with the rest. I cannot believe I did much damage;
but I made a noise," she chuckled. "But it gave me opportunity to
see Colonel Boone perform a noteworthy feat. One of the savages had
a very good rifle, and he had climbed a high tree in which he was
completely protected and from which he could overlook the compound
within the fort. He hit one or two of our people before we
suspected where he was; but especially he was killing our cattle,
which were huddled in the center. When his position had been
located Colonel Boone himself ascended into the tower. After a
little the man in the tree, preparing for another shot, showed just
the top of his head. Colonel Boone fired instantly and killed him.
It was a very long distance away."</p>

<p>"Was he&mdash;did he use this rifle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was his favorite rifle always, though he had
several."</p>

<p>Russell gazed down at the weapon with awe.</p>

<p>"What is this other name&mdash;Farrell?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"He made the piece, I believe: though I am not certain. The
Colonel was always particularly fond of it. He had some association
with it, though I do not know what it was. That is why Mr. Burnett
always took such pride in the fact that it was a gift to him, for
at that time he did not know Colonel Boone so well as later."</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" urged Russell.</p>

<p>"Mr. Burnett was of the greatest assistance&mdash;so Colonel
Boone always maintained&mdash;at the time Jemima Boone and three
other girls were carried off by the savages," said the old lady, a
trifle primly, as one reluctant to boast. But Russell, aflame with
excitement, would have no reticence. He learned how the four girls
had been seized suddenly and spirited away; how their absence was
not discovered for some hours; how the settlement was aroused to
pursuit. Most of the men, under Mr. Calloway, cut across country on
horseback in the probable direction of flight. Boone with eight
picked men took the difficult job of following directly, on foot.
For thirty miles they puzzled out a trail blinded by every device
of savage ingenuity; furthermore, they managed to do so rapidly
enough to move faster than the Indians had done in their flight. At
last the marauders, considering they had got clear away, abandoned
attempts at concealment and took the direct course.</p>

<p>"Colonel Boone had himself been captive of the savages,"
explained Mrs. Burnett, "so he knew their devices."</p>

<p>He struck boldly across country and cut the trail again in ten
miles. Shortly after they caught sight of the Indians making
camp.</p>

<p>"Mr. Burnett has often told me that now came the moments of
greatest danger for the girls," said the old lady, "for it was
certain that the first act of the savages, on being surprised,
would be to murder them. Colonel Boone picked out four men. One of
them was Mr. Burnett. He was always very proud of this; for he was
very young. They crept up. They knew that the least false move, a
snapped bit of wood, even the rustle of a leaf would be the signal
for the crash of tomahawks on the four girls' skulls."</p>

<p>At last Boone gave a signal. The four men fired and rushed
forward instantly. The remainder of the party bounded down the
hill, yelling as loudly as they could. The savages nearest the
girls, who were huddled together "tattered, torn and despairing" at
the foot of the tree, were killed at first fire. The others were
for a brief but sufficient instant paralyzed by surprise. All but
one. He leaped across the fire, his tomahawk upraised over the head
of Jemima Boone. But before it could descend its wielder collapsed,
a knife in his throat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Burnett was always very skillful at throwing a knife,"
stated the old lady. "But Colonel Boone considered he had saved
Jemima's life; as, indeed, he had; and a little later, when Mr.
Burnett and I were married, the Colonel gave Mr. Burnett this
rifle."</p>

<p>"I think this is the most wonderful thing I have ever heard!"
cried Russell.</p>

<p>"Ours was the second wedding to take place in Kentucky. The
first was of Sam Henderson and Betty Calloway; and within the year
Frances Calloway married John Holden; and Jemima Boone married
Flanders Calloway. Sam, John, and Flanders were the other three
men, besides Colonel Boone and Mr. Burnett, in the rescue party;
and Betty and Frances were the other two girls captured along with
Jemima."</p>

<p>She stopped with an air of finality.</p>

<p>"You didn't tell Russell who the fourth girl was, Grandmother,"
said Andy with a mischievous grin.</p>

<p>A faint color crept into the old lady's cheeks.</p>

<p>"You know perfectly who it was, you rapscallion!" she replied
sharply.</p>

<p>Russell stared up at her breathlessly in dawning
comprehension.</p>

<p>"Not another word out of you!" the grandmother checked his eager
questions. "It is too fine a day to sit within, listening to an old
woman's chatter. I am tired. Take him away, Andy. Get along, both
of you. Try your skill at the rifle. Show him how your grandfather
taught you the knife should be thrown. Off with you, now!"</p>

<p>She would have no more of them; fairly bundled them out of the
room with the dynamics of her energy, though physically she did not
stir from her chair. Only at the door she stopped them with a
word.</p>

<p>"I like your young man, Andrew," she observed. "Tell him to come
see me again. I have often heard Colonel Boone say that there is
nought like a good honest fight to begin friendship." She smiled
faintly at their confusion; and deliberately closed her eyes. They
hesitated a moment, and stole out.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>On the veranda Russell faced his new friend with glowing
eyes.</p>

<p>"I think she is wonderful!" he cried.</p>

<p>Andy nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"You see what I meant," said he. His face had darkened again;
and he had fallen once more into his somber mood. "Well, come on,"
he aroused himself.</p>

<p>He led the way around the house and through the orchard to the
pasture on the other side.</p>

<p>"Here's where I shoot, generally," he observed; "He doesn't like
me to. Says it's a waste of time and money. I guess it is; but I
like it. It's the only thing I can do that I <i>do</i> like. He'd
stop it, if he could. But grandmother won't let him. She gives me
the powder and ball, too. She doesn't often get her back up about
things, but when she does she has her own way. He tries to take it
out of me other ways. Oh, well!"</p>

<p>He leaned the rifle against the fence and laid beside it a
heavily laden belt, which also he had taken from the pegs on the
wall.</p>

<p>Russell picked it up to examine it and its attachments.</p>

<p>"That was Grandfather's, too," explained Andy.</p>

<p>"That was his shot pouch and powder horn. And this was his knife
and his tomahawk." He took the hatchet from its sheath. "Come on,
it's getting late. <i>He</i> will be back from town."</p>

<p>The pasture was still scattered with stumps of the old forest.
On one of these Andy, with the tomahawk, clipped a white blaze as a
mark.</p>

<p>They shot, turn and turn about. Andy proved to possess almost a
nail-driving accuracy. Russell was at first boyishly chagrined over
being outdone at a sport in which he rather fancied himself. But
the chagrin was soon lost in a generous admiration.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've had a lot of practice," Andy brushed aside his
praises. "And I'm used to the gun."</p>

<p>"I'm more used to percussion locks," admitted Russell
gratefully. "I always thought flintlocks couldn't be accurate, but
you've shown me differently."</p>

<p>"Snap-haunces, Grandmother calls them."</p>

<p>"Well, this one certainly can shoot. And you certainly can shoot
it!"</p>

<p>"So could you, if you got used to it."</p>

<p>"How about the knife-throwing?"</p>

<p>"I'm not very good at that. But I know how it ought to be
done."</p>

<p>He slipped the knife from its sheath, poised it in the flat of
his hand, cast it with a long round sweep of the arm. The weapon
turned once in its flight and stuck quivering in a near-by
stump.</p>

<p>Russell tried to imitate the cast. The knife hit flatwise and
bounded back. Two more trials were equally unsuccessful, one of
them landing butt first; the other glancing off at an angle,
carrying a sliver with it.</p>

<p>"Show me again," he urged.</p>

<p>Andrew repeated his feat several times to Russell's
admiration,</p>

<p>"That's not very good," the country boy disclaimed the praise.
"I ought to hit a pie plate every time at that distance."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd hate to have you throw it at me!"</p>

<p>"It's sort of fun. But what's the good?"</p>

<p>"It's sport. I'm going to get a knife and practise."</p>

<p>Andy unbent to explanation. "I don't know as you can get
one&mdash;a proper one," said he. "You see these old woodsmen made
their own knives. To throw right they've got to have just the right
balance, and a man's got to know the balance. You've got to know
just how many times she is going to turn over. This one, with a
full-arm throw, turns over twice in twenty feet. You've got to
guess your distance and then give her a full-arm, or a half-arm, or
whatever it is, so as to get her to land point first. Some men
liked to have their knives turn every ten feet, others every eight
or twelve; and they built them to do that."</p>

<p>"Why, all that is extraordinarily interesting!" cried Russell.
"I never heard of that before."</p>

<p>"My grandfather taught me," Andy's face softened. "He was a
wonderful man, as wonderful as Grandmother. After Boone left
Kentucky he came here. But he never liked it, I think. Always he
used to tell me that when I grew big enough he and I and
Grandmother would go out there. Then word came that Boone had died.
He used to sit on the veranda and look over there," Andy waved his
hand toward the reddening west. "He was very old. Oh, well!"</p>

<p>He gathered the equipment.</p>

<p>"I've got to see to the cows," he said shortly, "<i>He'll</i> be
back soon. I'll catch it."</p>

<p>He had receded to a mood into which Russell could not follow. To
Russell's lively comments on the afternoon's experience he returned
short and distant answers. They returned to where the saddle horse
stood hitched to the rail.</p>

<p>"I'll come again. May I?" begged the city boy, preparing to
mount. "We'll have another shooting match. Perhaps I'll do
better."</p>

<p>"I don't expect I'll have much time, what with the spring
plowing." Then, rousing himself to a sense of his apparent
ungraciousness, "Of course I want to see you, Russell. But unless
<i>he</i> goes to town I'm at work from dawn to dark."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll try it anyway;" returned the latter cheerfully. "And
you take a day off sometime and come to see me in town.
Promise!"</p>

<p>"I'd like to. I will if I can," promised Andy, but without an
answering smile.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye," Russell touched his horse with his heels. At
the bend of the lane he turned to wave a hand. But Andy was
standing, a dark figure against the sunset, gazing into the
west.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Days passed, but the friendship so auspiciously begun seemed to
have stopped at that beginning. Andrew, as he had anticipated,
never found the leisure to go to the city, the season was one of
hard close work on the farm and Birkholm, Andrew's stepfather, had
no intention of hiring an ounce more than the necessary labor. But
Russell did not repeat his visit, and the country boy in
consequence nursed a dull ache of disappointment, which he
carefully concealed. He had counted on it more than he would have
acknowledged.</p>

<p>Thus for close on two weeks. Then late of an afternoon the
beautiful saddle horse came up the road, flew like a bird in a
breath-taking leap over the fence; and, with scarcely diminished
speed, clumped through the fresh-plowed land to where Andrew was
scattering the seed. Russell was breathless: the words tumbled from
him in excitement.</p>

<p>"I've won out!" he cried jubilantly. "Had the very devil of a
row. They came near to cutting me off with a shilling once or
twice; and I'd certainly have been on bread and water, if I'd been
a little younger. Lord, what a rumpus! You'd think I'd stolen the
mint. I'd have come out before but I had to finish it. And now it's
done. But I've got to leave this very night, for I'm to go out with
Choteau, and he cannot delay&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off in a laugh at Andy's look of bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I'm not talking very clearly, am I? What I'm trying to say is
that I have had a most fearful fight with the family, but I have
won, and I don't have to go into the Business. It wasn't pleasant,
I assure you. But we've finally compromised. Choteau happened to be
here on some business with the firm, and it is agreed I go clerk
with him for a year. So we start to-morrow. But I couldn't go
without seeing you, and telling you. Not after the other day. I
wish you were going, Look here: why not? I'm sure I can fix
it."</p>

<p>He leaned forward in the saddle, his mobile face aglow. The
horse arched its neck against the bit, and blew softly through its
nostrils, and pawed at the soft and yielding earth. Andrew, from
his lower elevation, thought he had never seen a more vital and
romantic a figure. But his feeling was, confusedly, rather of a
bird poised gloriously for flight than of a boy on a horse. And a
wave of desolation darkened him, for it seemed to him that the
momentary gleam of a brightness in his life was being extinguished
into darkness. Nevertheless at the same instant he steadied to
acceptance, for that was an essence of his steadfast nature.</p>

<p>"Come on!" urged Russell, afire with the idea.</p>

<p>Andy shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'd like nothing better than to be with you&mdash;anywhere.
Anywhere but here. But I can't. I'm not of age."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Russell brushed this aside impatiently; then in
reluctant recollection of the rigid laws of the time: "Anyway,
nobody will know where you are."</p>

<p>"I've no money."</p>

<p>"I have plenty."</p>

<p>"There's Grandmother."</p>

<p>Russell was silenced for a moment by this. Before he could
gather his wits another voice broke in on them.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" it demanded roughly.</p>

<p>Both boys turned to face the speaker. John Birkholm stood
surveying them. He carried his ox goad, and his harsh fanatical
face was dark with anger.</p>

<p>"What do you here, you bedizened popinjay, trespassing in my
fields? Have you no sense in your head, that you ride a horse, on
fresh-sowed lands?"</p>

<p>Russell flushed deeply, looked back at the soft earth gouged
deep by the up fling of his mount's swift gallop; at the wide
trampling of its pawing hoofs.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir. I did not think&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the older man would have none of it. He advanced a step.</p>

<p>"And what mean you holding my son in vain talk?" he demanded
further, but still with repression. "Think you in your pampered
idleness that there is no work to be done?"</p>

<p>Russell's head was up. He stared coolly at the angry man. "I
told you I am sorry, sir, for what damage I have done. If you will
name it, I will make it good. As to the other, I but paused, to say
farewell to my friend."</p>

<p>"I heard ye," replied Birkholm grimly, "uttering the counsels of
hell. 'Honor thy father and thy mother.'"</p>

<p>His rage burst through its fragile governance. "Now get off my
land!" he cried. "I'll hear no words from ye! Go the way you came,
and do not show your face here again!"</p>

<p>Then, as Russell hesitated, half in bewilderment, half in
affront, he brought the heavy ox goad with a sounding crack across
the horse's rump.</p>

<p>The animal reared, leaped violently sideways, all but unsaddling
its rider. By a desperate effort of magnificent horsemanship
Russell retained his seat; by another he prevented the plunging
beast from bolting. His face was contorted. For an instant he
seemed on the point of launching his mount in an attempt to ride
the man down. The latter grasped the ox goad in both hands. For a
moment the two faced one another. Then Russell's expression changed
to one of disdainful mockery. He bent low in his saddle, and swept
his hat from his head.</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir, for your most courteous entertainment," he
said suavely.</p>

<p>With a turn of the wrist he whirled the horse in its tracks and
gave it its head. Across the field they raced, the clods flying;
over the fence they flew; and so away up the lane out of sight.</p>

<p>"You devil's whelp!" Birkholm shouted after him. "If I see you
again, I'll have the law on you!"</p>

<p>For several seconds he stared after the retreating figure, then
turned savagely on Andrew.</p>

<p>"Now get back to work, you!" he began, and stopped.</p>

<p>Andy, his face white and set, his hands clenched at his side,
was staring at him steadily. For near a full half-minute he stood
thus. Then very deliberately he undid from his shoulders the apron
sack that contained the seed grain; very deliberately and carefully
he laid it on the ground. Without a word he turned away.</p>

<p>"What are you doing? Pick that up. Get on with your work!"
commanded Birkholm.</p>

<p>Andy paid him no attention.</p>

<p>"Disobey me, will you!" roared the older man, beside himself. He
raised the ox goad once more and brought its lash across the
youth's shoulders. The latter spun around. From beneath the
straight black line of his brows his eyes blazed. After a moment he
again turned away. Birkholm watched him uncertainly, fingered the
ox goad in nerveless hands; at length shrugged his shoulders,
picked up the seed sack, and began to strap it on himself.</p>

<p>"I'll tend to you <i>later</i>, young man," he promised himself;
but uneasily.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Andy went direct to the living room of the farmhouse, took down
from its pegs the old Kentucky rifle, and went out. His grandmother
was sitting, as usual, in her Boston rocker, but he did not look in
her direction. Once outside he loaded the weapon. Never had he done
so more deliberately and carefully, filling exactly with the
glittering French powder the conical measure that hung below the
powder horn, centering precisely the linen patch beneath the ball,
driving without undue pressure the missile delicately home, shaking
with untrembling hand the fine grains of the priming powder into
the pan. Then he closed down the frizzen and walked around the
house, through the orchard to the edge of the field, where he
disposed himself with deadly deliberation behind the fence,
thrusting the muzzle of the rifle through the rails.</p>

<p>Birkholm had taken over the seeding. He was now at midfield. His
shirt was open at the throat, caught by a button halfway down his
chest. The front sight of the rifle came to rest on the point of
the V thus formed; settled slowly into the notch of the rear sight.
Andrew pressed the trigger. He was entirely cool; wholly
single-minded; without qualm or doubt. It was as though all the
currents of life ran in the channel of this one inevitable
action.</p>

<p>The rifle missed fire.</p>

<p>Contrary to what might be supposed by one unfamiliar with
old-fashioned arms, this was a very unusual occurrence, if the
weapon was well found with sharp flints and proper powder. It had
never before happened to Andrew. The click of so sharp a break in a
usual sequence seemed to shock him awake. He passed his hand across
his eyes, stared at the rifle, at the slowly nearing figure of his
stepfather. He shuddered, arose, and returned swiftly to the
house.</p>

<p>His entrance to the front room encountered his grandmother's
piercing black eyes upon him.</p>

<p>"Andrew, come here," she commanded. For a moment she compelled
his gaze with hers. "I heard no shot," then said she. He made no
reply. "What happened?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"Miss fire," he muttered.</p>

<p>"How can that be?" she cried sharply, as though someone dear to
her had been unjustly accused. "In distraction you did not prime!"
She seized the piece from his hand and raised the frizzen from the
pan in examination. With astonishing strength in one apparently so
frail, she flung the long weapon to the position of aim through the
open window and pulled the trigger. The rifle roared in
reverberation from the walls, the powder smoke thickened the air of
the room. For a moment she sat tense and upright, then dropped the
piece across her lap.</p>

<p>"It was the will of the Lord," then said she softly, and relaxed
to her chair back with a sigh.</p>

<p>In the fields Birkholm raised his head at the sound of the
shot.</p>

<p>"At it again!" he muttered vindictively, in his usual upsurge of
resentment against the silly waste of time and money. He told
himself that this time he would put his foot down once and for all;
and he flung the seed viciously against the placid bosom of the
earth.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>Andrew stared at her incredulously.</p>

<p>"You knew," he stated dully. She gazed back at him
unflinchingly, her eyes bright. "Why did you not stop me? I was as
one bemused."</p>

<p>"It was in the hands of the Lord," she repeated piously, "as are
all the great moments of life."</p>

<p>"You would have me kill a man!" he cried, arousing to a belated
horror of what he might have done.</p>

<p>"Why not," returned the old woman stoutly, "if so be it the time
has come?"</p>

<p>"You would have me a murderer, and say no word to stay me!"</p>

<p>"I know you, Andrew, through and through. I knew your father,
and his father before him. They moved alone through the destinies
appointed for them. That destiny is yours also. You will follow
where it leads; for peace or war; for weal or woe. I would not have
it otherwise. Never for a moment have I doubted it. But this I have
known: your fate is not in these tame fields. They are not in your
blood. It is out yonder,"&mdash;she flung her hand toward the
glowing west&mdash;"where a man's work awaits you, work bequeathed
you by your breeding. I have sat here long in patience, but certain
that your time would come. How, I could not know. Why should I
presume to interfere when the moment arrives? Even if it cost a
worthless life. Who am I to know the Lord's ways?"</p>

<p>Her small figure had straightened in her chair, her eyes blazed.
Through the blurring of her great years shone a fire. With a sudden
movement she held the long rifle to him.</p>

<p>"And this," she cried&mdash;"this that in the hands of Boone has
spoken in the Dark and Bloody Ground! Do you suppose for a moment I
have thought its voice was stilled? That its age was run, and that
it must hang in place, an outworn relic on the walls of a
Pennsylvania farm? No, my lad. It has but hung there in its fallow
time, gathering the strength for its further destinies."</p>

<p>Mechanically Andrew took the piece from her, dropped its butt to
the floor, crossed his forearms in an attitude of ease across the
muzzle.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the old lady in triumph. "This have I seen, and now
I see again. But beyond I see, not the tameness of walls, but the
dusk of forests and the lurk of savage men and beasts&mdash;" She
broke off suddenly and sank back as though weary.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Andrew," she commanded.</p>

<p>Andy told of the afternoon's episode. She listened, nodding
understandingly from time to time.</p>

<p>"It is the moment," she broke in at last. "The hand of the Lord.
You must go."</p>

<p>"Go?" repeated Andrew at a loss.</p>

<p>"Go. Certainly."</p>

<p>"How? Where? He will not let me."</p>

<p>"Go anyway. Run away. Of course you can." She was impatient at
his hesitation. "Don't tell me. I know the breed. I ought to: I've
been one of them long enough. You must have money. Very well: I
have saved for this. Nonsense: it's mine. I can do as I please. It
is not his; it was your grandfather's. And this,"&mdash;her hand
touched the rifle&mdash;"this too was your grandfather's. It is
mine. I can give what is mine, I suppose?"</p>

<p>A dull spot of red glowed in Andy's cheeks. He straightened, and
his hands gripped the rifle barrel until the knuckles showed white.
Suddenly a thought wrenched him.</p>

<p>"But you, Grandmother!" he cried brokenly, "how can I leave
you?"</p>

<p>For an instant the old lady's face contorted, then stiffened
again.</p>

<p>"Only for a while. Do you suppose I like this chair and this
room? I too have waited. You will make a place for both of
us&mdash;out there! When the time comes I will join you."</p>

<p>"Yes!" cried Andy, taking fire, then a chill caution seized him
again, "but he&mdash;what will he do? When he finds out,
he'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall tell him at the proper time," stated the old lady with
dignity. "I think you may trust me to give John Birkholm his
come-uppance!"</p>

<p>"I believe I can!" cried Andrew delightedly.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>The point decided, the old lady became all energy and animation.
She took charge of every detail, overriding Andy's somewhat
bewildered objections to making the proceedings so summary.</p>

<p>"No, now is the time," insisted his grandmother, "for if he
misses you this evening, he will think you are sulking apart, so it
will be well into to-morrow before he will understand that you are
gone. By then you must be well away. Do not travel by public
conveyance, at least until you are beyond the Gap; so that news of
you may not be easily come at."</p>

<p>"I shall hide in the woods!" cried Andy.</p>

<p>But the old lady would have none of false romanticism.</p>

<p>"Time enough for that when there is need," she said.</p>

<p>"He will make no great excursion," she gave her opinion, "save
perhaps to send forth notice to law officers. He will not leave his
work; and he will spend no money on a barren cause. I shall make
him see that. No, lad; travel sensibly&mdash;but get beyond the
reach of his grasp as soon as you may."</p>

<p>While thus they talked, she was busy gathering a small bundle of
clothing, to which she added a package of food sufficient for the
night and morning.</p>

<p>"You would best go as directly as you may to Missouri," she
advised. "They say the land is fat and there is room to breathe.
Colonel Boone's last home was there. Get you a plantation, if it
seems good to you&mdash;Lord, lad, you do not want that," she
snatched away the low brogans Andy was about to include in the
pack. "Remember, you must carry these things."</p>

<p>At the last the bundle was formed and they returned to the lower
story, the grandmother's cane tap-tapping on the stairs. She
disappeared for a moment in her own room, to return with a fat
leathern wallet.</p>

<p>"Here is money," she said. "See that you bestow it in a safe
place. Now you must hasten. The sun is low and you must be off
before he returns from the fields." She picked up the long rifle
from the corner in which it had been stood. A solemn hush abruptly
terminated their bustling activities. They looked at each other.
Andy's lower lip quivered in a sudden overwhelming realization.</p>

<p>"Oh, Grandmother&mdash;" he began brokenly.</p>

<p>The old lady's softening eyes snapped back to birdlike
brightess.</p>

<p>"Remember," she said briskly, "I have lived in a log hut in my
time, and I can live in one again! Don't get any highfaluting
ideas, young man; I expect you to send for me as soon as you get a
good roof overhead. And take a good look around. They say it's all
settled up near the river. Don't take up the first piece of bottom
land you see. Go to the new country&mdash;like a Burnett. They'll
try to scare you. They'll tell you there's no law, no comfort, no
civilization. Make your own law. Comfort comes from within you, not
outside. They'll tell you tales of Indians. Indians! Injuns we
called them! Pshaw, I've seen Indians aplenty!"</p>

<p>She looked down at the long rifle, then held it out to him in
both hands. He took it. The moment swelled big with unspoken
things.</p>

<p>"Kiss me&mdash;dear," she said at last.</p>

<p>He crushed her small form to him in a sudden agony.</p>

<p>But immediately she pushed him away.</p>

<p>"There!" she cried in her brisk quick way. "There! Now you must
go. Nay, it is hard; yes I know&mdash;oh, how well I know! But it
is only for a little time. Remember!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," muttered Andy, choking manfully against unmanly
tears. "A little time. I'll be ready for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She fairly pushed him from the door. He shouldered the rifle and
the bundle; hesitated; turned and stumbled away.</p>

<p>"Andrew," she stopped him.</p>

<p>He turned.</p>

<p>"The piece has been fired. Mind you clean it well before you
sleep."</p>

<p>He nodded, paused uncertainly</p>

<p>"Go!" she commanded.</p>

<p>He bent his head and obeyed, nor did he again look back. She
watched him from the doorway, her head held high.</p>

<p>In her eyes was the dazzle and glory of the westering sun. Thus
in the past had she sent forth her men. She saw in the golden haze,
not the tamed solid peace of the Pennsylvania farms, but the
shadowy darkness of unknown forests; and against them the trudging
dogged figure of the boy, and the gleaming slant of the rifle
barrel.</p>

<p>The figure turned the corner of the lane.</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p>The old woman's straight back bent, her head drooped forward;
Leaning heavily on her cane she made her way to the Boston rocker.
She sat down.</p>

<p>The air seemed to have turned cold, but she made no move to
close the window. It did not matter. She was very small. Her veined
hands lay inert in her lap. Her face looked shrunken. The snap and
sparkle of her eyes had dulled. In her seemed but a feeble stir of
life.</p>

<p>Her thoughts lay in a still pool, without motion.</p>

<p>There was in them no bitterness, no keenness of sorrow; only a
faint stirring of reflection. Her life was finished; its last
destiny fulfilled. Now was done that for which her vitality had
been sustained; that for which she had been preserved here until
the appointed moment. For she knew now that she was very old. She
heard John Birkholm's heavy tread outside, but the sound left her
undisturbed. Nothing he could do or say could affect her.</p>

<p>Even the thought of Andrew seemed withdrawn, far away, as remote
as the thought of Boone and her husband and her son. She had no
illusions: she knew she would never see Andrew again. All the outer
world had become spectral. She had withdrawn from its reality, and
now waited in patience at the portal of a new reality that was to
be. Only one thing the eye of her spirit saw still solid, still
valid in a world become shadowy: the long rifle. It was as though
it were a symbol of the old purpose of her youth, and the youth of
her men. It was as though the last remnants of her life force had
revitalized it to its destiny. A great peace came over her.</p>

<p>"Thy will be done, O Lord!" she murmured.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-2" id="ch1-2"></a>CHAPTER 2. The Mountain Man</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>ANDY traveled the back roads through the forests and by the
little backwoods farms. He did so partly to avoid possible inquiry
and pursuit; partly because he was only nineteen. With the long
Kentucky rifle across his shoulder, his bundle at his back, the
powder horn just nudging his elbow, the tomahawk and knife touching
his hip, he felt somehow romantic as though he had set the clock
back fifty years. The spring was swelling to maturity and the tonic
of her intoxication was strong. Andy stopped of nights at one or
another of the rare farmhouses. He started out afoot betimes of
each morning. On most days he managed to hitch-hike a good
proportion of the way on farm wagons or slower-moving ox carts. At
noons he stopped to eat his lunch, furnished him by his last
night's hostess. Before resuming his journey after the meal, he
drew the knife from its sheath at his belt and practised throwing
it at a selected mark on a tree. He cast it with a full round sweep
of the arm. The long blade, turning slowly, nevertheless invariably
struck point-in. Andrew did this practice studiously, pacing off
odd distances, considering thoughtfully the result of each throw.
The same care he bestowed on his rifle practice, for invariably
each day he fired five shots. Then, having cleaned the piece, he
resumed his journey. All this he performed with an intense gravity
of purpose, a gravity underscored, as it were, to the beholder, by
the cast of his dark complexion and the straight heavy line of his
eyebrows. His earnestness managed to impart indeed quite an
Indian-behind-every-tree illusion to the woods, an illusion only
partly dissipated by the tootling of the stagecoach horn on the
great highway a half-mile distant, or the peaceful blatting of the
sheep in pasture just beyond, the forest's screen. Certainly Andy
himself, running away to the wild west, entered whole-heartedly
into his game.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that, turning at the sound of a chuckle behind
him, he experienced no immediate shock of surprise at the figure he
beheld. Only after a moment or so did he come to a realization of
its extreme and theatrical incongruity in this peaceful and ordered
land.</p>

<p>He saw a tall, slender, and wiry man of uncertain age.</p>

<p>His face was clean-shaven, lean, leathery, and brown; his
deep-set eyes were blue and twinkling with humor. His head,
innocent of hat, was bound about by a blue kerchief from beneath
which escaped long hair. A plain cotton shirt was confined at the
waist by a buckskin girdle from which depended a variety of little
bags. Another belt, crossing his left shoulder supported, under his
right arm, a powder horn and shot pouch. He wore no breeches. In
their stead his legs were covered by leggings cutaway at the seat,
so that as he moved Andy saw the breech clout and the leathery,
chapped, browned hard skin of the man's buttocks. The leggings
themselves were tied at the knee, and were ornamented by many
fringes, embroideries in beads, tufts of hair and feathers dyed in
brilliant colors. His feet were encased in decorated moccasins. He
carried across the crook of his left arm a rifle not unlike Andy's
own&mdash;except that it was somewhat shorter and heavier.</p>

<p>Andrew stared at this strange figure, taking in these many
details, his mind separating it slowly from the congruity of his
play-acting, where it belonged, to the unbelievable actuality of
the tamed countryside from which it should have vanished
generations agone.</p>

<p>The man chuckled again, evidently relishing Andy's
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Look yore fill, lad, I'm used to it," said he. "Lord love you,
an you keep on far enough on the road you travel you'll see many a
more of Mountain Men besides Joe Crane."</p>

<p>He seated himself on a fallen tree, laid aside his rifle;
slipped from beneath his belt a pipe of stone with a long reed
stem, which he proceeded leisurely to stuff with tobacco. His form
was relaxed in every muscle; but his blue eyes were never still.
Even as he drawled on they flitted here and there about him. Not
for an instant did they seem to rest, yet somehow Andy felt that
their sharp scrutiny was seizing upon every item of his own
appearance and equipment; and that behind them a shrewd brain was
estimating him.</p>

<p>"Come, lad, sit down," advised the stranger, puffing forth a
cloud of smoke. He reached out a long arm to pluck Andy's knife
from the tree into which the last cast had buried its point.</p>

<p>"That is a proper blade." He balanced it appraisingly. "And you
cast it not badly. But you lose yore force." He flickered his arm.
The knife flashed through the air, to bury itself half-hilt deep in
the soft pine.</p>

<p>"See!" commented the stranger. "'Tis a trick; I'll larn ye."</p>

<p>He reached for Andy's rifle, which he examined as
critically.</p>

<p>"A proper piece too," he said, "properly made and kept. Though a
leetle on the light side for buffalo. Still, it's said its say in
its day, I'll warrant, and will say it again. Give me a good flint
gun. Your percussion arms are all right,"&mdash;he held up a
didactic forefinger&mdash;"and you'll find a-many to urge you to a
change. They'll tell you that in wet weather they are more sartin;
and that the high wind of the prairies will blow away your flint
gun's priming. That may be so for a <i>mangeur de lard</i> but not
for one who looks to his priming as an old <i>hivernant</i> should.
And mark you this, lad; with these new-fangled cap guns, when you
run out of caps you're done. You ain't got no gun. She ain't even a
good club. But with a flint gun, as long as they's rocks, you can
chip you off a new flint. And thar you be!" he ended triumphantly.
His scrutiny fell upon the patch box plate and its inscription. His
eye narrowed, and he looked up suddenly at Andy, but he said
nothing.</p>

<p>Andy's scattered wits focused at last.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he blurted out. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>The stranger's face darkened momentarily; then cleared. He threw
back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>"I nearly forgot," said he, "and came nigh to anger. You are a
likely lad, but you have much to lam. When you come to the prairie
do not ask a man his name or his business. That is not taken
kindly."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," stammered Andy. "I meant no harm."</p>

<p>"No harm is done," conceded the stranger handsomely, "And mebbe
you are not to blame. 'Tis a matter of upbringing mebbe. But look
yere, I didn't ask yo' nothin' about yoreself, though you carry
here Boone's rifle, as the mark on it states; and that is sure
enough to make a man curious!" He glanced down at himself
humorously. "I'd as soon tell you of myself, lad. I am from
Washington, jist now, whar I've been to speak to the President of
sartin things which have to do with the fur. It was decided that
someone must speak. So I have been; and now I return."</p>

<p>"You have been to Washington&mdash;you have seen Mr.
Monroe&mdash;" Andy broke off, embarrassed that his bewilderment
had carried him so far.</p>

<p>But the Mountain Man read him perfectly.</p>

<p>"In this guise?" He chuckled again. "Even so. I might well,
thinks you, put on the foofaraw of proper dress, but, thinks I: Joe
Crane, never in all your life have you acted like anybody but
yoreself. Do not make yoreself out a fool by trying to ape other
folks now. Joe Crane you have always been, and Joe Crane you still
remain. Go ahead, Joe Crane!"</p>

<p>"I see," murmured Andy. "And was your&mdash;did you succeed in
your mission, Mr. Crane?"</p>

<p>"I know now what I only suspicioned afore," replied the Mountain
Man cryptically. "And now that you have shown me the way to the
manners of this country, I'll make bold myself. How came ye by
Dan'l Boone's rifle, and whither go ye with it?"</p>

<p>"It was my grandfather's, given him by Colonel Boone
himself."</p>

<p>"Your name?" enquired Crane quickly.</p>

<p>"Andrew Burnett."</p>

<p>"Wagh! Then you're Gail Burnett's son&mdash;no, his
grandson?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did you know him?"</p>

<p>"I hear'n tell of him. Old Dan'l set store by him."</p>

<p>"You knew Boone?"</p>

<p>"Not to say knew him. No. He was afore my time. But I met up
with him one time on the Platte." Under Andy's breathless urging he
elaborated. It was at the time of Boone's great age, when he was
living on the farm of Nathan, his son. He had heard trappers' tales
of the salt mountains, lakes, and ponds, and he had made up his
mind to see them. So, disregarding the family's protests, he set
out.</p>

<p>"I was comin' in to St. Louey with my furs and possibles," said
Crane, "and I run across him on the Platte. He had jist one Injun
with him. He was a good Injun, an Osage. I talked with him. He told
me he had orders to bring Dan'l back dead or alive before snowfall,
and he was a-goin' to do it. The old Colonel was risin' on
eighty-four years but he was as straight as an arrow. His eyes
wasn't good. He had little pieces of white paper on his sights so
he could see 'em; but his hand was as steady as mine is to-day, and
he was eating his own meat. We come back together to Missouri. He
shore hated to quit without seein them salt lakes; but winter was
comin' and his Injun headed him back. He allowed he'd make it next
spring. We made heap many smokes together. He was worse'n you for
makin' me palaver. Nothin' must do but I had to tell him all about
the Mountains. Allowed mebbe he'd get him two-three Osages, and
mebbe a white man or two and go see. So you're Gail Burnett's kin!
Well, from what old Dan'l told me, you come of good stock."</p>

<p>The Mountain Man glanced at the position of the sun and arose
from the log.</p>

<p>"You live yereabouts?" he asked Andy.</p>

<p>"No: I'm traveling too." Andy hesitated. "I'm going west."</p>

<p>Crane dropped the butt of his rifle to earth with emphatic
delight.</p>

<p>"Wagh!" he cried. "So that's the way yore stick floats! We will
e'en travel together!"</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>For the first time in his life Andrew slept out in bivouac, for
Crane declined flatly to stop at a farmhouse or an inn. All the
days through he strode behind the untiring figure of the Mountain
Man; for he soon found by experiment that Crane was impatient of
conversation while journeying, and favored single file. Andy was
willing to trail along behind. The strange barbaric figure of the
Mountain Man, his head turning constantly in a habit of
watchfulness, was very satisfying to the romanticism of his years.
And, truth to tell, Andy found that after the first hour of the
morning, he had scant breath wherewith to talk if he
would&mdash;The frontiersman did not appear to hurry, but the swing
of his stride was such that Andy was well put to it to keep
pace.</p>

<p>But in the evening when the campfire had been lighted and the
simple evening meal disposed, Crane became as conversational as one
could desire. Before Andy realized that he was being drawn out, he
found himself confiding in his new acquaintance. The latter
listened attentively, without other comment than the strange,
throat-scraping <i>wagh!</i> That Andy should run away from a harsh
and fanatical stepfather seemed to him a matter of course. That he
should travel west only natural to a grandson of Gail Burnett. But
that he should be going to Missouri with the idea of taking up a
farm was too fantastic to rate consideration. Crane brushed that
notion aside as though it were a mosquito.</p>

<p>"I don't deny you're green for the prairies," said he. "You can
shoot, purty fair; and you can throw a knife, a little. Beyond that
you're mostly a total loss. You'd lose yore ha'r in two days. But
yo're likely in larnin', You've the makin's in you. <i>Farm!</i>
Wagh! That don't shine with me! Leave them things to farmers. They
don't fit with Burnett."</p>

<p>Immediately after this talk he took charge of Andy's schooling.
He found the young man's ignorance appalling. "Why, you ain't had
any eddication at all!" he protested.</p>

<p>The curriculum was quite haphazard.</p>

<p>"If you see buffalo runnin' around in leetle small groups,"
Crane would observe suddenly, "you'll know they's been chased by
Injuns not long ago."...</p>

<p>..."If you're looking a way through strange mountains, remember
to look for black rock, for when rocks is black snow has not
stuck&mdash;and this: where snow don't stick a man can't
climb."...</p>

<p>..."In Injun country quakin' asp's yore best fire. It ain't got
no smoke nor smell."...</p>

<p>..."If you git caught in the fog in strange mountains, throw
rocks ahead. If no sound comes back, set still."...</p>

<p>These and many other brief and pithy but unrelated bits of
wisdom Crane threw back over his shoulder as he strode along.
Later, perhaps at a resting period, perhaps at the evening fire, he
would test Andy's memory, proposing imaginary emergencies to which
the lad must state his remedy. And each evening Crane catechized
him strictly as to what he had observed along the road. Andy found
that to notice a chipmunk trail counted more with the Mountain Man
than any number of red-painted barns.</p>

<p>At every opportunity Crane drilled him in the handling of his
weapons. Mere marksmanship with the rifle received little of his
attention.</p>

<p>"You hold well enough," said he indifferently, "and you'll hold
better. Burn powder, lad; that is all. But you must learn to load,
for an empty piece helps no man but yore enemy."</p>

<p>It was not sufficient, it seemed, merely to understand the
proper charging of the rifle. One must be able to accomplish that
necessary act in all varieties of circumstances, lying down, in
cramped space, even running at full speed, on horseback. Crane
practised him at estimating his powder charge poured direct from
the horn. He showed him how a supply of bullets carried in the
mouth could be flipped skillfully into the barrel by the tongue,
and driven home by a smart smack of the butt of the weapon against
a stone or a tree or even hard earth; or the pommel of the saddle
if one were ahorseback.</p>

<p>"The spit'll hold her," explained Crane. "Don't need no patch
for that." He removed from his mouth the long-stemmed stone pipe
and pointed it didactically. "It's all right to measure yore powder
to the last grain when you got time. But if you have to load quick,
yo're so close that you'll hit anyways. If yo're fur away, you got
time to load with a proper charge and a proper patch fur fine
shootin'."</p>

<p>He made Andy perform the maneuver over and over.</p>

<p>At first Andy was clumsy. He was appalled at the amount of
powder he spilled and wasted.</p>

<p>"Never mind spilled powder. Powder's cheaper'n ha'r," said Crane
grimly.</p>

<p>He himself, in demonstration, spilled no powder. He was
extraordinarily deft and could charge, prime, and discharge his
rifle in an incredibly brief period, whether running, lying, or
huddled behind shelter.</p>

<p>Likewise he kept Andy almost tiresomely at his knife-throwing.
In this the boy made faster progress. He learned the knack that
drove the point deep. And now he discovered that he should also be
able to cast the weapon, not only straight ahead, but to right or
left, and even over his shoulder; and that without turning his
body. Crane possessed uncanny skill with his own knife. He insisted
on Andy's practising with that weapon also.</p>

<p>"She's a standard blade," Crane explained, "such as you will
find in the sheath of every <i>hivernant,</i> and once you have the
feel of one of them, you know them all."</p>

<p>The balance differed only slightly from that with which Andy was
familiar, and his progress was so rapid that Crane expressed
approval.</p>

<p>"That shines!" he cried; and patted Andy on the shoulder.</p>

<p>The schooling for the evening finished, the Mountain Man smoked
and talked. Andy drank it in. The talk was of the sweep of plains,
and the buffalo, and the rise of foothills, and the snowy peaks of
great ranges, and the fall of beaver waters, and strange wild
people, and hidden parks. And above all space and size and the
fling of distances. Crane somehow made this country in which they
journeyed seem very small and tame.</p>

<p>"Ain't hardly room to take exercise," said he contemptuously. He
dismissed the surrounding forest with a lilt of scorn. "Call them
trees! Wagh! Why, out in the Mountains, lad, there's trees so stout
it would tire a rat to run clean around them!"</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Thus by slow stages they gained to Pittsburg, which was at that
time the point of embarkation for the West.</p>

<p>It seemed to both the trapper and the country boy a busy and
bewildering place. They made their way promptly to the river,
stared at curiously; found by inquiry that a steamer was due to
leave in two days, and betook themselves to camp in a hardwood
grove outside the city. By now Andy, with the quick adaptability of
youth, believed himself to look upon houses with a scorn equal to
Crane's own. He had been accustomed to sleeping out, by a fire; and
since he had had no blanket, he considered himself as a tough,
hardy citizen, and was inclined to look down scornfully on such
lads as passed. Indeed Andy may have strutted just a little; there
is no question that he hung close to Crane and tried to look as
though he had always belonged with the Mountain Man. Venturing,
boylike, to hint at this enormous superiority over the commonplace
slaves to comfort who stared at them, he was chastened by Joe's
sardonic reminder that they had up to now enjoyed perfect picnic
weather. He made Andy buy himself a blanket. The boy did so, rather
under protest.</p>

<p>"But you have no blanket," he pointed out. He did not quite dare
to claim, in so many words, an equal hardihood with his hero. Crane
returned an evasive reply.</p>

<p>"We better see about gittin' on this steamboat," he turned the
subject.</p>

<p>The river boat lay alongside a wharf. She was flat, broad, and
built high in stories, with the pilot house grandly atop of all,
and two tall slim smokestacks bound together with a crisscross of
stays, and a diamond-shaped walking beam having a gilded Indian
with drawn bow.</p>

<p>Dozens of Negro laborers swarmed back and forth across her broad
gangplanks carrying or pushing or rolling all sorts of freight.
This was checked and disposed by clerks and mates, their sleeves
rolled up, their shirts open, their caps thrust back, their voices
hoarse, the sweat of honest exasperation on their brows. In
contrast to the inferno of bustle and noise below, the upper deck
dozed in a celestial calm. It was empty of life except for the
figure of the captain, leaning, arms folded, over the rail. He
looked cool and fresh and neat in his trim buttoned uniform; and he
smoked a contemplative cheroot; and gazed down at the insane
hurly-burly with the reposeful eye of complete detachment.</p>

<p>Joe Crane approached one of the busy checkers at the gangplank.
The latter paid him no attention. After waiting uneasily for a few
moments the Mountain Man ventured to address him. Gone was his
swaggering air of self-confidence. In this alien environment of
bustle and noise he was as ill-at-ease as a schoolboy.</p>

<p>"How much to St. Louey?" he asked in a small voice.</p>

<p>The checker did not even look up from his list. "Sanborn!" he
howled above the din. "Oh, you, Sanborn!"</p>

<p>At the summons a small, pale, fishy-eyed man popped out from a
cubby hole on the lower deck. He too was in his shirt sleeves and
carried a list in his hands.</p>

<p>"Well?" he demanded impatiently.</p>

<p>The checker did not reply in words, but jerked his head toward
Crane and Andy. The Mountain Man repeated his question. The small
man looked him over disparagingly.</p>

<p>"Hundred dollars, deck passage, find yourself," he vouchsafed at
last.</p>

<p>"That the cheapest?" enquired Crane.</p>

<p>The purser half turned away.</p>

<p>"Fifty if you wood up," he flung scornfully over his shoulder;
then vouchsafed to explain, "We'll take you for fifty dollars if
you help carry wood aboard whenever we stop for fuel."</p>

<p>"I'm Joe Crane," said the Mountain Man, "I'm just back
from&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care who you are," interrupted the purser. "Do you want
a ticket, or don't you?"</p>

<p>"Can't I work my passage?"</p>

<p>"We got plenty niggers already," sneered the little man.</p>

<p>Crane did not appear to resent this. He pondered helplessly.</p>

<p>"How much for a hundred and eighty pounds of freight?" he
enquired at last.</p>

<p>"Eighteen dollars."</p>

<p>"That shines," replied Crane with a grin. "I'll go as
freight."</p>

<p>The little man spun on his heel and stared malevolently at the
Mountain Man, his eyes blazing.</p>

<p>"Say, you!" he snarled. "Do you think I've got nothing to do but
listen to you trying to be funny? Get out of here before I have you
thrown off the dock."</p>

<p>He turned away.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sanborn." The captain's cool remote voice from above
arrested his steps.</p>

<p>"Sir?" the purser craned his neck upward.</p>

<p>"Book the gentleman."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"I say book the gentleman. Take him as freight. And, Sanborn,
stow him in the hold&mdash;under the flour barrels."</p>

<p>He had not raised his voice, but it had somehow carried above
all the din of loading. Those within its immediate hearing burst
into a roar of laughter. The Negro stevedores cackled, dropped
their loads to double up in merriment unrebuked. They passed back
the word to others who had not heard, and they too slapped one
another in delayed appreciation. On his Olympian height the captain
smoked meditative, indifferent, remote, staring across the
reposeful calm he alone inhabited. Joe Crane, followed by the
bewildered Andy, fell back abashed behind the warehouse shelter. He
looked at his young companion, humorously shamefaced.</p>

<p>"<i>Well!"</i>, he said comically. "Here's damp powder and no
fire to dry it!"</p>

<p>"Haven't you any money?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"My possible sack is mighty nigh as clean as a hound's
tooth."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Andy was nonplussed. "How did you expect&mdash;How
did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't need none goin' east, so I spent what I had. But it
seems like Joe Crane goin' to Washington to see the President and
Joe Crane goin' home again is two different beaver," confessed that
individual. "Looks to me like a man ought to be allowed to work his
passage, anyway."</p>

<p>Andrew was fumbling with the cord about his neck.</p>

<p>"You got money?" cried Crane interestedly. He snatched the bills
from Andy's hands, stared at them a moment, then leaped into the
air and uttered a wild war whoop that brought several men running
around the corner of the building to see what it was all about. He
paid them no attention but marched swaggering across the decks and
up the broad gangplank to the purser's office, thrusting aside
without ceremony the laden stevedores, glaring down the first
impulse of the officer who moved to stop him.</p>

<p>"Here, little man," he commanded, slapping down the roll of
bills. "Two tickets to Saint Louey&mdash;and carry your own wood
and be damned to you!"</p>

<p>Andy, trailing helplessly behind his triumphal progress, looked
up to meet the captain's calmly amused eye.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Joe Crane and Andy lived during that voyage on the flat lower
deck, next the water. Their sleeping accommodations were where they
chose to spread their blankets&mdash;for Joe now possessed such a
luxury, thanks to his discovery of Andrew's affluence. At the sound
of a gong they rushed into line to receive food dished out at a
galley door. The rest of the time they could do what they
pleased&mdash;on the lower deck. Above the second story&mdash;it
could hardly be called a deck&mdash;was reserved for slow-moving,
low-voiced, well-dressed people. The men wore tall beaver hats and
ruffled shirts and blue coats and light pantaloons: the women
floated wide in crinolines. They leaned on the rail occasionally to
look down with faint supercilious curiosity on the lower deck. And
above them again were the pilot deck and the captain and the pilots
and other ship's officers, remote as gods.</p>

<p>With these inhabitants of the upper worlds Andy was little
concerned. But the lower deck was occupied by as weird a hodgepodge
as one could imagine&mdash;wood choppers, backwoods settlers,
peddlers, raft men, boat-men, bullwhackers, a rough, tough lot.
They nearly all chewed tobacco; they all swore, and most of them
quarreled gustily over the slightest difference of opinion.</p>

<p>Nobody interfered with them save when, on rare occasions, the
customary turbulence threatened to develop into a riot. Then from
the engine room emerged a colossal Swede armed with an iron bar who
restored order in a most businesslike and impersonal fashion, and
at once disappeared.</p>

<p>Joe Crane fitted at once into this motley disorder. He was, when
he so chose, the center of a group. The rough men listened to his
tall stories of the prairie and the mountains; they listened,
though many of the hat-tilted tough boys, by their attitude of
having paused in the group for but a moment, and by an expression
of half-sneering amusement, tried to convey their general
skepticism of Crane's validity. But it was to be noted that nobody
opposed or quarreled with the Mountain Man. The latter thought
nothing of them. He laughed at Andy's first awe of them as
frontiersmen.</p>

<p>Some of the time Andy listened, or stood by watching the
interminable card games on a spread blanket; but what he liked best
of all was to huddle in a place he had discovered behind two bitts
near the bow. He watched the river glide by.</p>

<p>Separated thus from the human microcosmos of the ship, Andy
seemed to enter an aloof and hovering detachment, In after life,
though his memory for event was always remarkably clear and
detailed, this interlude of voyage never defined itself as
something in which he had actually taken part. It was like a dream,
having neither the dimensions of space nor time. The water swished
from the blunt bow; the walking beam swung up and down, up and
down, its gilded Indian pointing his arrow now low, now high; the
banks glided by. Against this monochrome things appeared as shadows
on a screen; and vanished again.</p>

<p>They stopped at Cincinnati, and went on. The hills became lower,
the houses and the settlements farther apart. Occasionally they
drew up at a wharf, and freight or passengers debarked or were
taken on. More often they merely shoved the blunt bow against the
bank and held it there until necessary business was transacted. At
such times, often, the gangplanks were thrown out, and long lines
of passengers working out their part fare carried aboard the long
sticks of cordwood from the piles maintained by the steamboat
company's wood choppers. Now Ohio lay astarboard and Kentucky
aport. They differed completely in character. On the Ohio side were
cleared farms and farmhouses, neatly painted, and in the New
England style; on the Kentucky side were ragged fields and the
large log cabins of planters and the smaller log huts of the
slaves. Between them and back of them gathered close the green
forest down to the water's edge. Cool and dark and mysterious it
lay; and Andy saw flashes of red as the tanagers and cardinals took
wing. And the rolling clouds of wood smoke from the twin stacks
broke against it and eddied between the trees.</p>

<p>They passed the rapids at Louisville on the flood; and stopped;
and many of the ship's company ended their journey there; and the
most of the rest came back only at the urgent and repeated summons
of the whistle, and some few were left behind, for the rougher
element became unanimously drunk, and there was considerable
quarrelsome disorder. Crane was drunk with the rest, and came back
alone in a very disdainful mood that even included Andy.</p>

<p>"If yo're goin' to be a Mountain Man you got to learn to
liquorize," was the grieved burden of his plaint. A raftsman agreed
with him profanely, adding embellishments. Crane instantly veered.
Since when had a mere alligator horse acquired the right to
criticize a friend of Joe Crane's? Joe offered to cut his liver out
to see if it was white. Offer declined; but if Joe would lay aside
his knife the raftsman would...They drifted away, squabbling. Andy
leaned his back against the bitts.</p>

<p>All this seemed to pass him by, could not touch the waiting
suspension of his westering spirit. The journey seemed to march by
him as a pageant. The stream broadened; the bluffs fell away; the
country spaced to broad undulations clothed always in the now
almost unbroken forest. Next the river were low, alluvial flats,
with marshes and swamps and the wild cryings and up-tiltings of
innumerable water fowl. The farms had been left behind. The
wilderness was broken only by the rare huts of the wood choppers
set on blocks or piles against high water, and the stacked
cordwood. The bosom of the river was wide and glassy. One would
have said it was as still as a lake were it not that here and there
the slow powerful turning of oily eddies, the veer of the ship
against its rudder, the hastening of the shore, betrayed its
strength. As afternoons drew to a close the sun turned it to the
red of dark wine and the air filled with gold, into which the
steamer glided as into a mist.</p>

<p>And at night was the suspension of quiet. The blackness of the
forest met the blackness of the river; and the dark blue-spangled
sky overhead; and the rare twinkle of lights ashore, repeated
waveringly in the water; and the refraction against the stillness
of the blatant lights and sounds of the steamer; and the
unintermitting pouring of bright sparks from the funnels that
rushed up so powerfully as though with purpose, and eddied, and
wavered uncertainly, and died against the evening as though
rebuked.</p>

<p>At this time the Mountain Man took to deserting his other
companions to stand silent near Andy, his elbows leaning on the
muzzle of his long rifle, his eyes, unblinking, staring straight
ahead, his head raised, as though he snuffed for something in the
breeze. He seemed at last caught in the younger man's hypnotic
suspense of waiting. They exchanged no words.</p>

<p>The river widened. The banks fell away. To the right a point
defined itself, against which lay moored a strange structure. As
the steamer swung in it became clear that this was a huge flatboat,
a hundred feet or more in length, supporting several log
houses&mdash;a store, a saloon, a gambling house: Cairo, the delta
of the Mississippi. Almost as far as the eye could see rolled the
breadth of the Fathers of Waters, the farther shore line dim and
low in the distance.</p>

<p>"We're gittin' thar! Wagh!" cried Crane.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>They plowed upstream against two hundred miles of heavy current.
Crane, realizing that the journey was nearing its end, abandoned
his careless companionships and gave his whole attention to Andy.
He considered it nothing short of a crime that so likely a young
man, the grandson of Gail Burnett, should become a farmer. He said
so, very bluntly, and incidental to his protest sketched appealing
glimpses of the wild life beyond the Missouri and the Platte.
Andrew's spirit yearned toward the adventure; but he continued to
shake his head.</p>

<p>"I promised Grandmother," he persisted steadily, "that I'd send
for her when I'd made a place for her to live. This money here," he
tapped his chest, "is hers. She gave it to me to pay the journey
and buy land."</p>

<p>"You'll make more in a season with the free trappers than you'll
make in ten year on a farm. And it's a man's life."</p>

<p>"I know," agreed Andy sighing.</p>

<p>"There's a country nor'west," urged Crane, "it ain't never been
trapped. It's Blackfoot country. Blackfeet is bad Injuns; but with
a good man and a bright lad-like yourself...I know a park back in
them mountains called the Tetons whar I g'arantee no Injuns
will...Why, lad, there's never a trap been set in them waters.
We'll have it all to ourselves. If we save our ha'r we'll come out
to the rendezvous with a thousand plew! Think of that, lad! a
thousand plew; or more! That'll buy ye a dozen farms&mdash;if you
still want the things. Yo'll git Missus Burnett out jist as quick;
and you'll have money to make her comfortable," said Crane
cunningly.</p>

<p>"I can't! I can't!" cried Andy with a desperation that indicated
his temptation. "I promised; and I took the money; and I've no
right&mdash;Besides," the words were dragged from his reluctance,
"I'd be no good to you in that country. I'm such a greenhorn. I
know nothing."</p>

<p>"Of course, if yo're afeard&mdash;" said Crane deliberately.</p>

<p>Andy's head jerked up. A dull red suffused his face. His hand
dropped to the pan of the weapon in his lap. "I'm not afeard," he
said quietly.</p>

<p>Crane looked at him; sighed.</p>

<p>"I know ye're not, lad. I take that back. Shore yo're a
greenhorn; but you got good makin's and you come of good stock. And
you larn quick. Look a yere, lad." He thrust his hand forward
earnestly. "We need ye. The big companies is comin' in. They're
sendin' out their burgeways to build forts and liquorize the
Injuns. The Mountain Men must make a stand or the beaver streams
will be tromped and the Injuns hostile. The mountains won't be no
place for a white man." He brooded. "What you think yore
grandpop-and Dan'l Boone would say if they knew that
this,"&mdash;he reached forward and laid his hand too on the long
rifle&mdash;"was a-poppin' black squirrels in a Missouri bottom,
and buffalo and Injuns and grizzly b'ar and antelope and sich just
over the skyline?"</p>

<p>"I can't! I can't! I can't!" cried Andy. "And," he repeated
bitterly, "I wish you'd let me be! I promised, I tell you! I don't
see why you want me, anyway. I'd probably just do some fool
thing."</p>

<p>"That's why I want you," replied Crane.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You stick," said Crane simply. "Well, if that's the way yore
stick floats..." He spat disgustedly. "It's always a woman; young
or old, it's always a woman spiles a good man."</p>

<p>"My grandmother&mdash;" Andy fired up at this.</p>

<p>"Shore! She's all right," Crane placated him. "I ain't sayin' a
word agin her. But that's the way it works. The good ones is wuss'n
the bad ones." He apparently gave it up. "I know. Nigh got me one
time. Might have been on a farm myself if a good friend hadn't
stepped in and saved my ha'r for me jist in the nick o' time. She
was a good gal, too: Run plumb onto her in St. Louey when I come in
with my fur, spring of '15. Hit me like a dose of alkali water.
Felt queer all over like a buffalo shot in the lights. Had no taste
for mush and molasses, no interest in hominy and johnnycakes, I
didn't care whether my rifle had hind sights or not. Couldn't help
myself no more than a man who's kicked a yaller-jacket log. If it
hadn't a-been for that friend I'd have been a gone beaver."</p>

<p>"What did he do?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"He married her," said Crane.</p>

<p>Andy laughed. Crane grinned reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Don't suppose nobody'd marry yore grandmother," he
admitted.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>The steamboat curved grandly and ceremoniously to the docks at
St. Louis. The ship's company had shaken off its monotony of
routine and crowded the rails. Andy, clinging with difficulty in
the jostling of the crowd to his place by the bitts, looked with
all his eyes.</p>

<p>St. Louis of that day lay on a terrace below abrupt limestone
bluffs, long since graded away, atop which defensive works stood
like sentinels. A row of warehouses faced the docks, and behind
them straggled streets parallel with the stream. The docks
themselves were wide and long. At this moment they were crowded
with a mixed and miscellaneous throng. Andy filled his eyes with
their picturesque incongruity. There were gentlemen in the height
of fashion, French <i>engages</i> dark and vivacious; rivermen in
high leather boots; absorbed and businesslike clerks in sober garb;
ragged stevedores; bull-whackers swaggering bare-chested and
hat-tilted; plains-men leaning on their long rifles, eyeing the
hubbub sober and aloof. And here and there Andy's first plains
Indians, gaudy and painted. The din was tremendous. Men shouted;
the paddle wheels beat; and the safety valve took this occasion to
cut loose with a devastating roar.</p>

<p>Joe Crane thrust himself through the crowding passengers to
Andy's side. He had become abrupt; business-like; remote.</p>

<p>"You can get track of me at the Rocky Mountain House, if you
change your mind," said he briefly; and was gone. A moment later
Andy saw the Mountain Man gain the wharf by a flying leap; and,
indifferent to the protests and invectives hurled after him by the
outraged crew, disappear in the throng.</p>

<p>A lump of hurt and resentment arose in Andy's throat at this
abrupt and indifferent farewell. But now the gangplank was lowered,
and he was swept away by the rush toward shore, carried helplessly
forward, his arms jammed to his side, crowded and jostled. It was a
human stampede, each regardless of anyone but himself.</p>

<p>Buffeted, his nostrils filled with the reek, Andy was swept
forth at last to the wharf. As soon as he could do so he stepped
aside, drawing a deep breath of relief, his hand seeking the little
sack of money suspended about his neck beneath his shirt. The long
breath strangled in his throat. The bag was gone.</p>

<p>The shock of the loss turned Andy physically sick for a moment.
He groped for a pile head and supported himself against it. The
noisy wharf had gone black in a reeling world. Gone! When? How?</p>

<p>Dimly he became aware that somebody was speaking his name. With
difficulty he brought his mind to a focus. The captain of the
steamboat stood before him. He was made to understand that the
captain had a letter for him. How could a letter reach him in this
crowd? More trouble, probably. He wanted to get away as quickly as
possible. He took the letter mechanically.</p>

<p>"You sure this is mine?" he asked wondering. "How did you
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>The captain grinned in his beard.</p>

<p>"There are not many boys of just your description carrying one
of those things." He indicated the long rifle. "The letter was sent
to the company's office at Pittsburg, and as soon as you took
passage with my ship, it was handed to me."</p>

<p>"Why did you not give it to me before, then?"</p>

<p>"Instructions. It was to be given only when you debarked."
Nodding acknowledgment to Andy's thanks, he strolled away.</p>

<p>Andy stared at his grandmother's fine angular handwriting, and
thrust the letter unopened into his pocket. In this crash of all
the plans they had made together he could not bear to read it. He
shouldered his entire earthly possessions and left the wharves.</p>

<p>For an hour or more he walked about, dark in the misery of his
loss. Up the Rue Royale&mdash;business places, board sidewalk, mud;
back down the Rue de l'Eglise, ditto ditto without the sidewalk:
double again, one block nearer the limestone bluffs; on the Rue de
Granges to the French quarter, derisively called Vide Poche. The
Rue Royale was crowded; the others nearly empty. He was as though
living a double exposure on a negative. His impressions were
fragmentary, snatched in his brief emergences from his inner
trouble: the mud; the numbers of creoles speaking French; an
occasional strikingly picturesque figure of trapper, trader, or
boatman; the wild rolling eyes of the otherwise stolid Indians; an
overnote of truculent rowdyism, the prevalence of arms; Negroes. He
was only partially aware of them. He found himself gazing fixedly
at things which he did not see until slowly they seeped down to his
attention. Thus the feet of a barefoot Negro in profile, grotesque,
and the gradual clarifying of the picture in Andy's attention until
he realized that never before had he seen heels extending back so
curiously in excrescence. And with this realization a long rifle
barrel thrust past Andy's shoulder; and a shattering discharge and
cloud of powder smoke, and a wild yell from the Negro as he rolled
about clasping his heel creased by the bullet. Shaken completely
from the somnolence of his misery Andy found himself in the center
of a whooping instantly gathered crowd. A tall quiet man in black
thrust through and laid his hand on the shoulder of the drunken
trapper with the smoking rifle. The latter protested,
aggrieved.</p>

<p>"God a'mighty, man," explained he, "I jist aimed to trim him up
so he could wear a genteel boot!"</p>

<p>"Kyant do no shootin' in the streets," said the tall man
firmly.</p>

<p>He shook the drunken man, faced him about, gave him a shove in
the broad of the back. He staggered away. The crowd howled with
laughter. Several clapped him on the shoulder, admiring his
accuracy, inviting him to "liquorize." They scattered slowly. Andy
was alone again. Nobody paid any attention to the Negro,
hippity-hopping away as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>But Andy was now shaken awake. The thing was done and over, and
to be faced. Andy faced it squarely. The money entrusted to him to
buy the farm was gone. He must get some more money. The only way he
could think of to do that was to take up the Mountain Man's offer.
What was it Crane had said? A thousand plew. What was a plew? He
must find out. Having made this decision, Andy instantly set about
acting on it. Thus already he displayed two of the qualities that
later were often to stand him in stead. And having come to his
resolution Andy was ashamed to find, beneath the chagrin suitable
to the occasion, a sudden leap of exultation. It was positively
indecent! He sternly made it down-charge, turned his inner eye away
from it. Nevertheless it glowed away down inside, awaiting its
chance to burst out. But he <i>was</i> going west! Couldn't take
that away, what ever the austere reasons!</p>

<p>He enquired the way to the Rocky Mountain House, and had turned
in that direction when he remembered the letter in his pocket. He
could read it now; albeit with still a bit of dread and shrinking.
He drew one side for the purpose.</p>

<p>"DEAR Boy:" it began, "You will wish the news of the farm, and
the situation here: so I will say at once that your stepfather has
instigated no pursuit, as I suspected, due to his great stinginess:
Nor has he been disagreeable to myself, due I think to his idea
that I have money to dispose, not knowing that it is already
disposed. So your mind may be easy on these accounts, and you may
think of me as quite happy with my Book and my memories and my
thoughts of you at last doing what your blood calls you to do and
which I had planned for you.</p>

<p>"You will be wondering why you get this letter only now and not
at Pitt's town whither it was sent. I arranged that in order that
you might not be tempted to turn back. By now, I think, you must
know that you are not meant to be a farmer, I have known that for a
long time. The knowledge of it has been the joy of my old age. I
never intended you to make a place for me out there, but otherwise
you might not have gone. I would be very unhappy watching you
grubbing at a farm. I could never stand half that journey, now. But
don't you worry about that. You'll write me of your great doings,
and I'll be very happy here in my old rocking chair, for remember
this, it is only through you that all that I have loved and cherish
lives on. So do your part, boy, like a man. Make your mark on your
time, like your grandfather before you. Let others make the
farms&mdash;after you have found the country and made it safe for
them." She signed her full name with the painstaking flourish of
the period. But there was more. "I had not thought to touch upon
it," she had added, "but the thought must occur to you, and I would
not have it weaken your resolution. We may not see one another
again. I am eighty-seven years old, and I know too well the dangers
of the life you must lead. But we shall not be snuffed out when our
bodies go. Our sort goes marching on."</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>The Rocky Mountain House proved to be a small two-storied rude
structure on one of the streets back of the Rue des Granges. Nearly
the whole lower story wall was taken up by a single large room,
crowded with men. Some of them stood at a bar; a few occupied
chairs; the most sat crosslegged on the floor. They were a wildly
picturesque lot. Heads were covered with handkerchiefs, wide felt
hats, caps of fur: bodies with cotton; with fringed and beaded
buckskin yellow in newness; with buckskin black and shiny from
wear. Legs also with buckskin, or with stout stroud; feet with
moccasins plain and fancy. A few were dressed decently and quietly
in the fashion of the cities. Smoke hazed the air.</p>

<p>Andy stood in the doorway accustoming his eyes to the dimness.
Nobody paid him the least attention.</p>

<p>He was thrust aside by a man entering. The newcomer strode to
the center of the room. Over his shoulder he carried a buffalo robe
which he spread tanned side up. At one end he seated himself
crosslegged; crashed down a hatful of silver dollars and with a
sweeping motion spread a pack of cards.</p>

<p>"Yere's the deck and yere's the beaver!" he challenged. "Who
dares set his hoss? Wagh!"</p>

<p>They gathered close, squatting crosslegged and on their heels.
Only the mart back of the bar remained standing; and two others
near a farther door. Andy felt himself keenly scrutinized by them,
and after a moment he recognized one of them as Crane.</p>

<p>He picked his way across to them.</p>

<p>"Well, here I am!" he announced.</p>

<p>Neither man replied for a moment.</p>

<p>"I'm going with you, after all," Andy supplemented; "that is, if
you still want me," he added, the chill of the possibility
rendering his voice uncertain.</p>

<p>Crane glanced toward his companion.</p>

<p>The latter was a tall man and muscular, clad from head to foot
in fresh buckskin. His hair hung to hide the broad of his
shoulders; but he was clean-shaven. His eyes were hard and direct,
puckered into cold scrutiny. The lines of his brown face were
keen-cut and fine. His expression was of deep gravity. The general
impression of the man was of power and alertness held in the
reserve of repose.</p>

<p>"This is Jack Kelly, my pardner," said Crane, and to Kelly:
"This is the lad I was tellin' you about. If he sez so," he told
Andy.</p>

<p>Andy was conscious of the plainsman's slow appraisal, sweeping
him from head to toe like a cold flame. Abruptly he spoke. His
voice was low and, surprisingly, inflected with that peculiar
quality we call cultivation.</p>

<p>"You've changed your mind&mdash;why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I told you he was no farmer!" interpolated Crane confidently,
"He&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kelly silenced him with a gesture.</p>

<p>"Why?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing, somebody stole my money off me," admitted
Andy, and laughed. "The money your grandmother gave you to buy a
home," Kelly said bitingly. Andy flushed, but his eyes did not
waver. "So you've lost it; and now you're running away."</p>

<p>Andy's head jerked.</p>

<p>"I'm not running away!" he denied hotly.</p>

<p>The stranger's eyes bored into his.</p>

<p>"Money's not hard to get," he said, "nor farms, in this country.
Suppose I put you in the way of one."</p>

<p>"The boy's no farmer!" cried Crane.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Joe. Well?" Kelly challenged Andy.</p>

<p>Andy hesitated, then thrust his letter into the plains-man's
hands. The latter read it slowly, passed it to Crane. He in turn
spelled it out, his lips moving.</p>

<p>"Wagh!" he ejaculated when he had finished, "That old woman
shines!" He turned on Kelly indignantly. "What I tell you?" he
demanded. "Whar floats his stick?" He seized Andy by the shoulders.
"We'll make a Mountain Man of you, never fear! And," he returned to
Kelly, "you mark my words, he'll shore make them <i>come</i>!" A
sudden recollection caused the expression of his face to change
ludicrously. He hesitated a moment in indecision, caught Kelly's
eye fixed upon him, grinned shamefacedly. He fumbled in one of the
pouches suspended from his belt; thrust something into Andy's
hand.</p>

<p>"Reckon I might as well give you this back," he mumbled. "You
ain't no farmer," he alleged defensively. "I allus said so. But
somebody had to keep you from bein' one. Wagh!"</p>

<p>Andy looked down at the stolen sack of money. For a brief
instant he felt himself as though lifted by the sweep of greater
destinies than those within his command.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-3" id="ch1-3"></a>CHAPTER 3. The Statesman</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>For over a week Andy Burnett shared with his new companions a
tiny room at the Rocky Mountain House pending departure for the
west. He paid for it twenty-five cents a day, and twenty-five cents
each for meals. The two Mountain Men seemed to be much occupied
with mysterious business of their own, which they did not offer to
share with Andy. They paid him but just attention enough to see
that he was properly outfitted.</p>

<p>Left to his own devices, Andy wandered much about the town. He
liked especially the river and wharves. The great fur
traders&mdash;such as the Chouteaus and Sublettes&mdash;would have
interested him more; but he had gathered that for the moment some
friction existed between them and the Mountain Men, and, with the
instant and complete partisanship of youth, he would have none of
them. From a distance he viewed the bustling activities about the
warehouses where were preparing several of the compact and
elaborately organized trading expeditions with their "bourgeois"
and their "partizans" and their camp keepers, and <i>engages</i>
which so aroused the scorn of the fiercely individualistic Mountain
Men. Andy heard much of it in the evenings at the Rocky Mountain
House.</p>

<p>"Used to be a man could travel anywheres if he kep' his eyes
shining," they grumbled. "Injins don't mind a white man or so
actin' same as them. They sort of trade sociable-like what furs
they got, and mebbe marry you a squaw or so to keep yore winter
camp for ye. And you ketch what fur you kin, and trade a few where
you kin, and bring 'em out in the spring. But when these companies
git to sendin' out a whole train, and scatterin' hired hunters and
trappers all over the kentry, the Injins gets skeered they're bein'
crowded out and the game killed or druv off. And I don't blame 'em.
Consarn it; a few more and there won't be room for nobody, and
they'll ketch all the fur, and nobody'll have nothin'."</p>

<p>"We ain't got a show with them," agreed another.</p>

<p>"They got likker to trade; and an Injin'll trade his best pony
for likker. 'Course they git all the fur. And the likker makes
trouble, too," he stated virtuously. "You put likker in an Injin
and you cain't tell what he'll do. He cain't carry it like a white
man does. Likely as not to sculp you no reason at all."</p>

<p>"I suppose you never traded liquor to the Indians, Fitz,"
Kelly's low and cultivated voice betrayed his amusement.</p>

<p>"<i>No</i> sir!" Fitz denied the insinuation vigorously. "How's
a man to carry enough to make it worth while?"</p>

<p>The discussions were interminable, but inconclusive.</p>

<p>Andy listening, gained the impression of a vanishing golden age.
There stole over him a momentary depression of having lived just
too late; succeeded by a passionate resentment against remorseless
modern efficiency.</p>

<p>But Kelly laughed at him.</p>

<p>"There are two or three hills out there yet," said he. The end
of his wandering about usually found Andy perched on a bench at
Jake Hawkens's gun shop. This was a thoroughly satisfying spot.
Andy liked the smells of oils and metal and fresh wood. He never
tired of watching the beautiful accurate processes in the making of
rifles. He treasured proudly for himself the tolerance of the
brusque, bullet-headed little Pennsylvania gunsmith, for Hawkens,
as a rule, would permit no loafers about the shop, and drove forth
unceremoniously any who seemed inclined to linger. He had no
conversation for anybody, but he made no objection to Andy's
sitting quietly out of the way.</p>

<p>This, Andy well realized, was due in no manner to himself. Kelly
had brought him in. The frontiersman had insisted, overriding Joe
Crane's arguments and objections.</p>

<p>"You're an old fogy, Joe," said he. "You and your flint guns!
Nobody but an Indian uses a flint gun nowadays. Nobody but an
Indian and some old fool like you."</p>

<p>"If you give out of caps, what you got?" Joe proffered his usual
argument. "Nothin' but a club, and not a good club at that. Now if
you run out of flints, you can chip you off another somewheres, and
thar you be."</p>

<p>"Yes, and if she rains and your priming powder gets wet; or if
she blows hard and cleans your pan out for you, 'thar you be' too,"
rejoined Kelly contemptuously. "Suppose you use elementary common
sense and take along enough caps to last you, and a hatful
more."</p>

<p>In spite of Joe's grumbling he escorted Andy and his rifle to
the gunmaker's shop.</p>

<p>At first Hawkens would not even look up from his rifling
machine.</p>

<p>"I make rifles," said he shortly, "I don't tinker. I got no time
to fool with making over every old blunderbuss. If I started that
sort of thing, I wouldn't do anything else."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Jake," agreed Kelly amicably, "but I don't
want to take this boy out to the mountains with nothing but a flint
gun."</p>

<p>"Let him buy himself a proper one, then. I'm making them."</p>

<p>"Well, just take a look at this anyway, and tell me what you
think."</p>

<p>The little gunmaker glanced briefly and grudgingly at the weapon
in Andy's hands.</p>

<p>"I know those things," said he. "Too light, anyway. All right
enough for when they come from. Now what you want for the
mountains&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is a Hawkens rifle, I know," said Kelly. He took the piece from
Andy and thrust it beneath Hawkens's nose. "Take a look at it
Jake," he urged.</p>

<p>The gunmaker took it grudgingly and ran his eye expertly over
its lines.</p>

<p>"It's a well-made piece," he admitted, "and well kept."</p>

<p>He turned it over. "Who made it?" He squinted painfully at the
brass cover to the patch box, deciphering its inscription. Suddenly
he straightened his bent back and looked squarely at his visitors.
"Do you know what you've got here?" he demanded with some
excitement.</p>

<p>"It was my grandfather's rifle," Andy spoke up, "but before that
it belonged to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dan'l Boone, yes, so I see. But this,"&mdash;Hawkens tapped a
blunt forefinger on the other name.</p>

<p>"I've always been told it is the name of the maker."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Hawkens impatiently. "But this I suppose
you do not know&mdash;that it is said in our craft that Farrell was
the first to invent the long barrel and the patched ball. It is
possible that this might be the very piece." He examined it
absorbedly, "He was a fine workman," said he.</p>

<p>Fumbling about amidst the litter of his work bench he produced a
magnifying glass through which he continued his examination,
muttering to himself. Finally he looked up.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," said he. "I'll give you one of my
new rifles for this. Kelly'll tell you that a Hawkens is
better-fitted than any other for the plains."</p>

<p>"Every plainsman worth the name has a Hawkens&mdash;if he can
get it," corroborated Kelly. "It's more than a fair trade."</p>

<p>"I-I know that," stammered Andy, "but if you don't
mind&mdash;You see, this was my grandfather's rifle&mdash;in
Kentucky&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't trade," supplied Hawkens. "I supposed not. But this
piece ought not to risk loss. It ought to be kept as a historical
piece. Well, if so be it you are firm, I'll alter it to a cap gun.
I'll do it myself&mdash;and proud to," he added.</p>

<p>That was why Andy was tolerated on Jake Hawkens's work
bench.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>The other items of his equipment were quickly acquired. Andy
would have liked very much to flower forth in full buckskins. If
left to his own devices he would undoubtedly have appeared rigged
out wilder than the wildest. In this Joe Crane would have abetted
him not because of any remote suspicion of Andy's romanticism, but
because of despised "foofaraw." But Kelly would have none of
it.</p>

<p>"You'll come to buckskins soon enough," said he, "but you're
silly to get them here&mdash;or to wear them here. The clothes
you've got on are good for a while."</p>

<p>He superintended the purchase of a sort of greatcoat made of
green blanket material, and a hard white wool hat. The latter even
Joe admired, so Andy bought him one also to replace the customary
bandana. Andy's rifle implements&mdash;the bullet mold, the worm,
and the shot pouch and powder horn&mdash;he supplemented with a
flint and steel and an awl.</p>

<p>Joe shook his head over the rigid severity.</p>

<p>"I don't hold with foofaraw," said he, "but a man's got to hev
some pride in himself."</p>

<p>Joe's awl he had set in a deerhorn handle, and had made for it a
sheath of carved cherry wood.</p>

<p>"He's got to hev pouches for his belt," complained Joe, "How's
he going to carry his possibles?"</p>

<p>"He can make' em&mdash;when the time comes," said Kelly shortly.
His sardonic eye swept the bedizened Mountain Man from head to toe.
"Same as you, Joe."</p>

<p>The latter accepted this complacently, missing the irony. He
looked with satisfaction at his buckskin leggings, adorned
elaborately with fringes, embroidered with beads, aflutter with
dyed feathers and tufts of hair.</p>

<p>"Nat'ally he ought to git him his own sculps," he admitted,
fingering one of the latter.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, are those <i>scalps</i>!" cried Andy, staring with
mingled horror and fascination.</p>

<p>"And I still got mine," said Crane, patting his own
top-knot.</p>

<p>In one matter only did Kelly yield. Or rather, on the contrary,
he insisted. From a squaw he caused Andy to purchase several pairs
of moccasins.</p>

<p>"Wear them," he advised. "You've got to get used to them, and
you may as well begin now."</p>

<p>So Andy began then, and was secretly a little proud of the look
of his feet, though he discovered the earth a lot knobbier than he
had thought it, and was inclined at first to step mincingly when he
forgot for a moment that he was a hardy plainsman. Soon, however,
his feet hardened, and he learned instinctively to feel the ground
for a brief fraction of a second before throwing his weight
down.</p>

<p>His proudest moment came when the three of them visited a
blacksmith shop on the outskirts. The smith was a gigantic Negro,
who at first denied that he had any traps to sell.</p>

<p>"All spok' fo', Mistah Kelly," said he respectfully. But Kelly
paid him no attention. From nails on the walls he lifted a number
of beaver traps, testing them thoughtfully one after the other, and
from the lot selecting six that met his approval.</p>

<p>"Only decent traps made in St. Louis," he told Andy, "There you
are. Give him ten dollars apiece. That'll be right."</p>

<p>The Negro accepted the situation with a grin. "Suah good traps,"
he agreed.</p>

<p>They next visited a large store filled with fascinating and
alluring things among which Joe Crane prowled longingly, but which
Kelly sternly ignored. He purchased a quantity of powder, lead, and
percussion caps.</p>

<p>"Better git a plenty of them things," muttered Joe,
unreconciled.</p>

<p>A small store of coffee, a pot, some vermilion in packets,
several yards of scarlet and blue cloth completed the list.</p>

<p>"There; that'll do you," said Kelly. "Shut up, Joe. That's all
he needs, and you know it."</p>

<p>On the way back to the hotel, carrying these purchases, the tall
plainsman unbent to explanation.</p>

<p>"You'll want horses and saddles, of course," said he, "and such
gear. But we'll get them at Franklin. There are always a lot of
fools get drunk on their way out and have to sell their outfits
cheap." He glanced at Joe quizzically. The latter looked
virtuous.</p>

<p>Andy, accompanied by Joe, carried these few belongings to the
tiny room he shared with his companions.</p>

<p>Joe rushed to the mirror to get the effect of the white wool
hat. Apparently his full expectations were not quite realized, for
he examined his reflection from several angles.</p>

<p>"Well," he said finally, "not so handsome as I might
be&mdash;but <i>damn</i> genteel!"</p>

<p>Assisted and instructed by the Mountain Man, Andy made himself
pouches of buckskin for his belt, a sack of buffalo skin for his
traps. The Mountain Man continued to spend much pains on what he
called the boy's education. Andy heard much quaint lore; he shot
with his rifle, when Hawkens had completed his work on that
weapon.</p>

<p>He began, at first awkwardly, to practise throwing his knife
with his left hand. Crane was scandalized when he discovered the
boy's skill was all right-handed.</p>

<p>Joe was even more scandalized over his accidental discovery that
Andy knew little of horseback. With horses he was familiar, and
knew their wants and dispositions, for he had had much to do with
them on the farm; but he had never been atop them save for a sober
jog under harness to or from work. From that moment strenuous times
began for Andy. Joe managed to get the use of two animals, and
nearly the whole of every afternoon Andy spent in&mdash;or
near&mdash;the saddle. He soon learned to stick on well enough in
straight-ahead going, for he was young and active; and, after a few
muscle-racking days, he began to harden so that sitting down in
comfort became an art regained. But his attempts to put into
practise Joe's demonstrations of the higher proficiencies were
merely interesting failures. He managed to cling in concealment
behind one side or the other of his mount just as long as the
animal moved no faster than a walk. A trot or gallop shook him off
with a thump, like a ripe plum off a tree, He was black and blue
and sore, but Joe kept him at it.</p>

<p>"One of the shorest ways to git rubbed out is to fall off yore
hoss," said he. "The buffalo'll tromp you, and the Injins will lift
yore ha'r. You got to larn to stick yore hoss no matter what. Like
you growed to him. Like dead to a dead nigger."</p>

<p>The Mountain Man was a mine of knowledge in <i>this</i>
department too. Andy was filled with a new respect for the breadth
and depth of the man's attainments. He began to see that, in spite
of his lack of formal schooling, Joe was an exceedingly
well-educated man. He began to realize what Joe had meant when he
had called Andy uneducated. It was all a matter of what one was to
do in life.</p>

<p>"It's a sayin' that a man ain't a good rider until he's fell off
nine times," said Joe. "Well, Andy, at that rate you shore ought to
be a hell of a good rider!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless Andy really did make rapid progress. He acquired
the automatic feel of balance that goes with every movement of the
animal; and that is the basis of horsemanship.</p>

<p>One of the things that interested him most was his practice with
the short heavy bow.</p>

<p>"Helps out the rifle sometimes. Comes handy," said the trapper.
"Don't have to larn to shoot very straight with 'em, jist to shoot
<i>hard</i> and fast. Cain't never tell. Better'n a gun to run
buffalo with sometimes."</p>

<p>So Andy discharged arrows from his galloping horse as happily as
a small boy. For a time he saw little of Kelly. The tall plainsman
was mysteriously absent most of the time.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Time passed. The clientele of the hotel was thinning.</p>

<p>By twos and threes and in larger parties the mountain men were
drifting away. Some departed on the river steamboat that one day
set out up the Missouri. Regular service was not to be established
for several years yet. This was made a gala occasion. The decks
were crowded with a miscellaneous throng. Everybody in town was at
the waterside to see the start. One of the great companies was
sending out a trading outfit, well equipped, well manned, well
organized. Besides the <i>bourgeois</i>&mdash;or
"burgeway"&mdash;in charge of the business, and his lieutenant, the
"little burgeway"&mdash;was the "partizan" who acted as field
general, and a multitude of French and creoles to keep camp and
perform necessary labor. The hunters and trappers stood apart. Tons
of freight were piled aboard after them, goods for trade when the
fur country should be reached; all packages made into loads of
equal weight for packing, and plainly marked&mdash;vermilion,
beads, red cloth, blue cloth, powder and lead, flints, blankets,
knives, hatchets, fusils&mdash;a sort of musket&mdash;tin and iron
kettles, sugar, raisins, thread, finger rings, brass
wires&mdash;all sorts of things. And dozens of short flat wooden
kegs curved to fit a mule's sides, which received especial care,
and were placed under guard.</p>

<p>"Likker," explained Joe sourly. He looked on the whole
expedition with jaundiced eye, and glared at the little group of
trappers and hunters with a hostility that was returned with
interest.</p>

<p>"Hired flunkeys," he snorted disdainfully, "workin' for wages
and takin' orders like a passel of sojers. Don't even get the valee
of the furs they ketch. Jist wages! Sp'ilin' the kentry fur a white
man!"</p>

<p>So of course Andy hated them <i>too</i>; though with a sneaking
appreciation that they were a pretty competent-looking, hard-bitten
lot at that.</p>

<p>The boat's paddle wheel churned the water. Everybody yelled. The
whistle blew. There was a wild fusillade as the plainsmen
discharged their rifles into the air.</p>

<p>"We oughta be aboard that boat ourselves," grumbled Crane. "I
don't know what Kelly's a-thinkin' of or what he's a-waitin'
fer."</p>

<p>Others of the guests of the Rocky Mountain House departed on
horseback; still others on foot. Their places were partially filled
by a different class of men from the river or the farms. Still the
trio lingered; still Kelly would give no word for departure. He
came and went, ignoring Andy almost entirely, intent on mysterious
affairs.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Andy and Joe sat chair-tilted on the veranda of the Rocky
Mountain House. The evening meal was over, and the dusk had fallen.
Kelly had been invisible since early morning; and Joe, as usual,
was grumbling over the delay in starting.</p>

<p>"I cain't rightly understand what he's up to," he complained.
"Everybody's gittin' the jump on us. But they's no use tryin' to do
anything with him. He'll start when he gits a good ready. Well,"
the Mountain Man spat resignedly, "he's got his idees. And my stick
floats with his. I've parderned with Kelly for nigh on four year
now and I've larned to follow. When he gits his eye on a stream
it's gone beaver. For all his college eddication and his soft talk
he's the best man of the lot. He makes 'em <i>come</i>."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Joe," Kelly's sardonic voice startled them. "That's all
right. Come with me, you two."</p>

<p>He led the way swiftly through the gathering dusk, down through
the gaily noisy squalor of the Vide Poche, through the Rue de
l'Eglise, to the more dignified quarter of town where stood the
mansions of the St. Louis aristocracy. Turning in at one of these
he rang the bell. Preceding Andy and Joe Crane, he followed the
Negro servant into a study where awaited them a tall, clean-shaven
man of between thirty and forty, dressed carefully in the long coat
and strapped pantaloons of the man of importance. A mane of hair
tossed back from a high narrow forehead, aquiline features, and
haughty and piercing eyes, together with a backflung carriage of
the head, but emphasized a peculiar vivid and burning dynamic force
of personality that was almost arrogance.</p>

<p>At the introduction of his visitors he arose from an armchair
and laid aside a book.</p>

<p>"Ah, Kelly," he greeted the tall frontiersman, "I am glad to see
you. And these, I suppose, are the men of whom you have
spoken."</p>

<p>"My partners," replied Kelly. "Yes, sir. This is Joe Crane, a
Mountain Man of old standing and long experience: none better in
mountains or on the plains. And this is Andrew Burnett. His
experience is as yet slight; but I have confidence in his ability.
His name will be familiar, sir, when I mention Gail Burnett."</p>

<p>"The friend of Boone," agreed their host. "You are of
distinguished blood, sir, and I am sure will do credit to your
breeding. Be seated, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Kelly obeyed the invitation with easy unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Joe perched himself awkwardly and warily on the edge of a chair.
Andy, embarrassed and a little awed, he knew not why, took refuge
in the background.</p>

<p>"I have brought them with me," said Kelly, "because they are my
partners to whom I am pledged, and I can make no undertaking
without them. I also wish you to see them for yourself. And as I
told you, you'll have to make it clear what you want, or it's talk
wasted. I know Crane."</p>

<p>"Quite right." Their host ran his hand through his upstanding
hair, and turned to Joe and Andrew. "Here is the situation," said
he. "You probably know as much or more of it than I do, Crane; but
I'll run it over for the benefit of this young man. The population
of New Mexico, Spanish and Indian and mixed blood&mdash;largely
mixed blood&mdash;import about everything they use. About all they
make themselves is a little pottery, some kinds of blankets and
leather, and such things. Everything else they use comes from Old
Mexico. Not only is that a long carry, but the class of goods sent
in is poor, the remains of old stock, often, sometimes damaged
stuffs. And the charges are outrageously high. We could, here from
St. Louis, send them better goods, at half the prices they are
paying now, and still make a fine profit."</p>

<p>Joe Crane grinned. "Try it," he advised, "and see what happens.
I reckon you're a trader from the way you talk."</p>

<p>"This is Senator Benton, Joe; and I'd advise you to shut up and
listen."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe the Senator's thinkin' of goin' into the trade,"
was Joe's stout comment, "and I'm tellin' him."</p>

<p>Benton's uplifted hand checked Kelly's rejoinder.</p>

<p>"I want to hear," said he. "Go on, Crane. What is your
point?"</p>

<p>"My p'int is this," replied Joe, "that it's been tried, and it
most ginerally never works. Take Dave Merriweather or Jules de Mern
or Bob McKnight. They got <i>in</i> all right: nothin' to stop a
good man gittin' thar, though it's mean kentry to travel through.
And when they got thar, what happened? Why, they got their trade
taken away from them, and they landed in the calaboose. And they'll
do it that way every time. As you say, Senator, it's a purty
vallyable trade, and them Spanish governors is going to keep the
pickin's, and those <i>hombres</i> ain't too partic'lar what they
does to keep it, either."</p>

<p>"You have correctly stated the situation, as it has existed,"
Benton acknowledged. He hesitated, and turned a doubtful eye in
Kelly's direction. The latter nodded.</p>

<p>"You can talk freely, Senator," he said. "I'll answer for this
young man, and Joe can keep his mouth shut even when drunk," he
added with a grin.</p>

<p>"The situation is going to change," Benton resumed. "This is
confidential; but by secret dispatches I learn that the tide of
revolution is rising, and that General Iturbide is even now at the
gates of Mexico City. If so, Spain's power in Mexico is at an
end."</p>

<p>Joe Crane slapped his thigh.</p>

<p>"And out goes the hidalgos and in comes the greasers!" he cried
delightedly. "They been hangin' around the feedin' pen with their
tongues hangin' out: now's their chance!"</p>

<p>"Which means a Mexican governor in place of a Spanish governor
in New Mexico. And that offers an opening heretofore non-existent
for the trade."</p>

<p>"I don't see that," objected Joe. "Senator, you don't
<i>sabe</i> these people like I do. I've lived with 'em."</p>

<p>"That is why I asked Kelly to bring you here. What about
it?"</p>

<p>"Wall," observed Joe dryly, "you line up a Spanish governor and
a greaser governor 'longside each other, and shuffle' em up a
leetle, and you can't tell a one from t'other. They're both
thisaway." The Mountain Man held up a receptive palm.</p>

<p>"I expect you are right," admitted Benton; and added slowly, "I
hope so."</p>

<p>"Huh?" Joe was surprised.</p>

<p>"For this simple reason: A Spanish governor wanted a monopoly
for Spanish goods&mdash;in which, as you suggest, he might be
personally interested. A Mexican governor cares nothing whatever
about Spanish goods. It might be better worth his while to make an
arrangement with others. Ourselves, for instance."</p>

<p>He paused to let this soak in. Joe caught the point
immediately.</p>

<p>"And somethin' 'on the prairie' is what'll do the trick. I take
it back; yo're right, Senator."</p>

<p>It was Benton's turn to look puzzled.</p>

<p>"'On the prairie' is plainsman's talk meaning a free gift,
Senator," Kelly explained.</p>

<p>"Or a bribe," amended Joe bluntly.</p>

<p>"I think we understand. The point is, here is a chance to open a
valuable trade, if we take advantage of it; a trade that will prove
valuable not only to those who engage in it, but to our country. It
is an opportunity of which we must take instant advantage. That is
why I have asked you men to meet me here this evening."</p>

<p>"If yo're tryin' to make a trader out of me, yo're barkin' up
the wrong tree," stated Joe positively. "A trapper I am, and a
trapper I'll allus be. I ain't got no use fer tradin' or
traders."</p>

<p>"I understand that," replied Benton. "I am not asking you to
enter trade if you do not care to do so. But the trade can be
established: it must be established. There are difficulties,
immediate difficulties, to be overcome. One of them is the
route."</p>

<p>"There's a plenty knows how to git thar," said Joe.</p>

<p>"Not many. And they are not available. And it is not sufficient
merely to get there. We must find a wagon route. I understand you
have made this journey."</p>

<p>"I have. And it's a tough one, what with bad kentry and bad
Injins."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless you could make it again. I would like to have you
do so."</p>

<p>Joe Crane studied Benton keenly.</p>

<p>"I don't aim to dry-nuss no tradin' outfit," he stated. "I aim
to trap the Blackfoot kentry, soon as I kin git thar."</p>

<p>Benton arose from his chair.</p>

<p>"I do not wish you to act as guide. Nor do I contemplate sending
out a wagon train this year. What I want is a scouting
trip&mdash;and a messenger. It will not interfere with your plans.
You could without too great a delay go to the Blackfoot country by
way of Santa Fe, could you not?"</p>

<p>Crane considered carefully.</p>

<p>"We might," he admitted with caution.</p>

<p>"I want only two things: to determine in detail the best route,
and to convey secretly to the new Governor certain ideas of my
own."</p>

<p>Joe pondered further.</p>

<p>"How you goin' to know about it?" he enquired. "I don't reckon
we aim to come back yere. Season's too late."</p>

<p>"I can fix that," spoke up Kelly. "Old Pedro Vial has made the
trip in '92, and he is still alive. I can fix it with him to bring
back our reports."</p>

<p>"The job will be worth a thousand dollars," added Benton.</p>

<p>Joe knit his brows. He glanced toward Kelly. "How about it,
Jack?" he asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>Kelly nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, all right," agreed the Mountain Man. A slow grin
illuminated his face. "Santa Fe gals! I never thought to see them
agin! And," he added, "I never thought to throw in with no traders,
neither!"</p>

<p>"That being agreed, we will drink to success," said Senator
Benton, and struck a bell.</p>

<p>The ceremony completed, all arose to go. Benton laid a hand on
Andy's arm.</p>

<p>"If you've nothing better to do, I should much enjoy a chat with
Gail Burnett's grandson."</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>The Senator lighted a long cheroot and relaxed into the depths
of an easy chair. Benton was always possessed of an extraordinary
personal charm, and he now took pains to exert it. He proved to
know more of the Burnett family in the early history of Kentucky
than did Andy himself.</p>

<p>"It seems eminently proper and fitting that you should be in
your turn going into the West," observed the Senator, "as your
grandfather went into the West of his day. And you are going with
the two most competent men I know. You could have no better
mentors. Some of these Mountain Men are a wild lot, and how they
survive is a mystery. Most of that sort do not survive." He was
talking on quietly to give the lad a chance for ease. "You'll be in
a position to learn all there is to learn from Kelly and Crane.
It's very exciting to look forward to, isn't it? Then what?"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>Benton considered: came to a decision.</p>

<p>"It's always a good idea to face facts," said he. "For Crane and
Kelly and their like it is all very well. But you are a young man.
You are going to live to see this present life change to something
else. It is inevitable. The day of the free trapper is drawing to a
close." He smiled at the fall of Andy's countenance. "Oh, not
to-day nor to-morrow nor the day after. You'll have your fling, my
lad. But more and more will go into the mountains. They are going
now&mdash;as they went into Kentucky in your grandfather's day.
It's only to be expected. A few cannot expect to monopolize the
half of a continent. Where one man goes ten will
follow&mdash;eventually."</p>

<p>He knocked carefully the ashes from the end of his cheroot and
resumed:</p>

<p>"The one man does not like it, naturally. He wants to keep his
old life. Joe Crane is just back from Washington on some wild
errand against the organized trading companies." He looked across
at Andy keenly. "That could not succeed, of course. I understand
how he&mdash;and his kind&mdash;feel about it, and I can
sympathize; but I can see the futility of it."</p>

<p>He surveyed, with a twinkle of kindly amusement, the increasing
blankness of the boy's face.</p>

<p>"I would not have you think for a moment I am underrating your
new friends," he went on. "Nor am I trying to throw cold water on
your great adventure; least of all am I trying to turn you from it.
God forbid! You are, to my mind, privileged beyond most. The
Mountain Men!"</p>

<p>He turned to his desk and flipped open an atlas on which he laid
the flat of his hand. "Ask them. They will tell you that all they
want is the beaver. Most of them will die poor, leaving their bones
to bleach on the plains and mountains, and no one to miss them and
no one to mourn them and no one to remember them. They are gone as
if they never were. In the eyes of the world all they have managed
to accomplish is to put silly beaver hats atop a lot of numskull
pates, and money in the packets of merchants and saloon
keepers."</p>

<p>His beautifully modulated orator's voice&mdash;it was the day of
the orator&mdash;sunk at the last words. Andy twisted his hands
nervously. His world of enthusiasm was flattened. He had to
remember he was too old to cry.</p>

<p>Senator Benton removed the flat of his hand from the map.</p>

<p>"What does this say?" His long forefinger tapped it nervously.
"'The Great American Desert'; 'Unknown'; 'Unexplored.' That is for
the world. But the Mountain Men know better than that. And before
the legend of that blank space is changed in the geographies of the
future, there will not be a park in the Rockies, a stream in the
hills, a patch in the 'desert' that one of you has not ridden over,
walked over, trapped over. You will know! You have been there!
Those who come after will follow your trails! You will lead the
'explorers' when they come. Nobody will know that, but it will be
true. You seek the beaver streams; that is all you know. But more
surely than most you play your part in larger destinies.</p>

<p>"You are going with Kelly and Crane into the Blackfoot country.
That is unknown, and, I understand, dangerous. If you win though
alive&mdash;as I am confident you will&mdash;you will be rich in
beaver skins. But also this,"&mdash;he tapped again the legend on
the map&mdash;"will be by that much more untrue. Do you see now why
I said you were highly privileged?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Andy. His head was up again. Benton arose
suddenly from his chair and began to pace back and forth the length
of the room, "We are born to a noble destiny. But we must work with
destiny if we would have it come true. Nothing must be allowed to
stand in our way. By every means, with all our heart and strength
we must play our parts. Many things will oppose us; the unknown,
hardship, strange and alien peoples&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly in mid-stride, and looked down almost
quizzically at the lad before him.</p>

<p>"It is too big for one man. It is too big for me. But we can
play our part, however blindly; can't we, Andy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Andy again. He had risen and was facing the
older man. For a moment Benton looked at him searchingly.</p>

<p>"You are Gail Burnett's grandson," said the Senator at last. "I
suppose that is why I am talking to you so. You must not let what I
have said dishearten you. Go trap your beaver, and hunt your
buffalo and deer, and learn to take care of yourself among the
savages. It is the adventurous life that will appeal to your years
and your blood. But when the time comes, remember!"</p>

<p>He poured two glasses and handed one to Andy.</p>

<p>"To the Mountain Men," he proposed, "and those who come after
them! And to our country! One people, one flag, a mighty
civilization that shall extend, that <i>must</i> extend, from sea
to sea!"</p>

<p>Andy gulped at the unaccustomed wine.</p>

<p>"I remember once," said the Senator conversationally, "asking
Colonel Boone to what he ascribed having escaped so many dangers to
have attained his great old age. He answered me, 'I was ordained by
God to open the wilderness.' He meant it, and I believe it. Some of
us are. And now, my boy, good-bye, and good luck to you. I shall
hear of you."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" cried Andy. "You shall!"</p>

<p>Benton's eyes followed him musingly, and a little wistfully, as
he left the room. Though still in the earliest years of his
senatorship in the new state, already the ambition of his
statesmanship was defining itself in his mind. The settled "facts,"
so solid and real to his contemporaries, his eye alone saw to be
illusory. With one gesture of prophecy he brushed aside the
impossibilities&mdash;the vastness of an unexplored continent, its
apparently insurmountable obstacles of beast and savage and thirst
and mountain and the unknown; the new occupation by the British in
Oregon; the old established sovereignty of the Spanish in
California and the whole Southwest. In imagination he stood on the
shores of the Pacific, still looking westward. His fine eyes
glowed: then darkened. The "facts" took on solidity; pressed him
close. Spain and Britain and the Unknown towered formidably against
his vision. What he had accomplished shrunk to nothing in face of
what must be done. A few men interested in trade: the beginnings of
a thrust toward the locked land; a feeble public interest in the
fate of the Northwest now that Astoria had fallen and it was almost
too late.</p>

<p>Weary years thrust between the vision and its accomplishment.
For a moment the Senator's high courage drooped. He could count his
supporters on the fingers of his hand! He felt alone in a world of
emptiness.</p>

<p>Then his head went up again. His eye turned to the door through
which Andy had taken his departure. Alone? How could he have been
so foolish! Back of him pressed the irresistible genius of a
people. This boy who had just gone out: Benton saw him as a
symbol&mdash;the youth of the land pressing forward, it knew not
why, to the accomplishment of its appointed part: and after it the
people as a flood into channels prepared. Suddenly the Senator
experienced a tremendous uplift of vigor and hope. Succeed? Why, it
was impossible that he should fail.</p>

<p>"It is manifest destiny!" he cried: for the first time using a
phrase which was in later years to be at once his war cry, his
excuse, and his Justification.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-4" id="ch1-4"></a>CHAPTER 4. The Trader</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>FOR the third time the flat-bottomed Missouri River steamboat
slid up on a sandbar, half turned in the current, splashed for a
few moments like a whale, and gave it up. The motley crowd aboard
cheered ironically and returned to its card games and its talk.
Some of the crew baited lines and dangled their legs over side in
hope of a river cat. The captain shrugged his shoulders, lighted a
cheroot, and waited. He was somewhat of a philosopher, the captain,
an educated man, given to airing his views in any company. Thus it
was to Andy Burnett as the nearest at hand that he turned on this
occasion.</p>

<p>"Of all variable things in creation," he remarked, "the most
uncertain are the action of a jury, the state of a woman's mind,
and the condition of the Missouri River."</p>

<p>He seemed entirely resigned and patient; as was not Andy, who
burned with eagerness to enter on the great adventure of his first
trip with the mountain men. But he had already learned that running
aground was not serious, for the rapid current working against the
resistance of the hull soon carried away the light loose quicksand
to set her free. And in this the Missouri differed from all other
rivers.</p>

<p>Sure enough, inside an hour, helped by a judicious occasional
stroke of the paddle, the steamer had extricated herself and was
again plowing against the heavy yellow current. The following day
interminability actually ended; and, with the rest, Andy
disembarked at the little settlement of Franklin.</p>

<p>It was not, in this year of the early twenties, much of a
settlement; but it was the jumping-off place for the prairies and
mountains, and therefore possessed of certain activities and
industries. There was a saddler, and a provision merchant, and a
gunsmith, and a number of saloons. These were housed in logs, and
back of them straggled other log cabins used as dwellings. Franklin
lay in a bend of the river, below rolling wooded hills. At this
time men were beginning to see a brilliant future for it as the
commerce of the prairies should increase; and certain primitive
forerunners of the booster tribe were beginning speculation in town
lots. Their reasoning was sound enough, but a few years later the
Missouri completely justified the captain's statement by deciding
to change her bed. In the process she removed Franklin.
Thenceforward the new settlement of Independence, nearly two
hundred miles farther upstream, more safely situated, grew to be
the starting point for the westward caravans, even through the
covered-wagon days.</p>

<p>At Franklin Andy's companions reclaimed from a man who made a
business of horses the animals they had left in his care. Five of
them were horses; the sixth was a big raw-boned mule. This proved
to be Joe's especial pride. He bragged about it with a vehemence
that suggested a defense complex against not infrequent
ridicule.</p>

<p>"He ain't sich a lot to look at," he told Andy, "but I wouldn't
trade him for an even dozen of them things." he jerked a scornful
head toward Kelly's horse. "He'll climb whar a goat can't make it,
and he'll git fat whar a horny toad'll starve, he'll smell out an
Injin further than&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can smell a drink, Joe," supplied Kelly with a grin.</p>

<p>"Yes," Joe accepted this as a sufficient compliment, "and what's
more, when you <i>cache</i> he won't nicker and holler and give you
away like no fool hoss. And they ain't nobody goin' to steal him on
me. He'll kick ary stranger so high the blackbirds'll build nests
in his ha'r before he comes down."</p>

<p>"And," Kelly told the boy with mock enthusiasm, "you just ought
to see him run buffalo! Steady as a church; and moves just about as
fast."</p>

<p>"If I want to run buffalo I'll git me a fool hoss," said Joe
gruffly.</p>

<p>They bought three horses for Andy, consulting earnestly together
after inspection of several hundred offered for their choice; and a
stout second-hand saddle and bridle; and two packsaddles; and three
rawhide ropes to be carried wound in a coil around the animals'
necks. Then they moved, with all their few and simple belongings,
to a little grove outside the settlement where already were
encamped a dozen Western wayfarers.</p>

<p>Andy was surprised to recognize many of those who had left St.
Louis on the preceding steamboat nearly a month before. His feeling
was not shared by either of his companions. Indeed, they seemed to
have expected something of the sort. Many of the tardy ones
appeared to have postponed departure for the simple reason that
they had paused to celebrate further their abandonment of what
civilization they knew. The seductions of Franklin's simple but
effective red light district had been too much for them. Their
takings of the season before had gone into the pockets of the
saloon keepers. This temporary embarrassment of resources did not
appear to bother them much, for Andy found that recuperation seemed
to depend on the artless process of waiting for enough newcomers in
sufficient funds to outfit everybody.</p>

<p>It was a true communism. Those with something over and above the
immediate need did not hesitate to produce for those gone broke.
Thus the whole band slowly gathered strength as a unit. Since a
man's rock-bottom necessities were few and simple, this could not
take long.</p>

<p>Three ponies, some jerked meat&mdash;which the surrounding
country quickly supplied&mdash;a little coffee to start the
journey, tobacco, lead and caps, a half-dozen traps; these were
sufficient to set any good mountain man up in business again.</p>

<p>But the immediate cause of delay proved to be a more serious
matter. It seemed that the trading outfit that had taken passage on
the earlier steamboat also lingered, strangely and inexplicably, at
Franklin; were, in fact, still camped the other side of town. It
was equipped, organized, ready; but it did not move. By all plains
common sense it should have been by now well beyond the Platte. The
mountain men, through long training, were quick to react to the
unusual. Accustomed to the instant arousing of suspicion and
wariness by the smallest deviations from the normal, they were
instantly alert.</p>

<p>"What these burgeways a-waitin' for?" they asked Kelly. "Whar
floats thar stick? Looks to us like they're waitin' to trail after
us and find out whar's our kentry. They been tryin' now for
two-three year to git into our trade. What you think, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Quite likely," agreed Kelly. "They got any good men?"</p>

<p>"Sublette's with them."</p>

<p>"Well, they'll get in," Kelly pointed out, "eventually. How you
going to stop them?"</p>

<p>"Wall," said the other stubbornly, "we ain't a-goin' to lead 'em
in and have them squattin' under our noses stealin' our trade. Let'
em do their own findin'."</p>

<p>The matter was discussed at length about the camp-fires;
heatedly, but it must be confessed rather aimlessly, The mountain
men's only positive unanimity was an instinctive resentment.
Reluctantly they were forced to admit that their clearer-sighted
and cooler members, like Kelly, were right; that slow invasion of
the mountains was ultimately inevitable. But they were firmly and
irrationally resolved to resist the inevitable in every way they
could. Especially were they united in resentment of this presumed
effort to force them in spite of themselves to act as guides to the
enemy! The first idea, which was acclaimed with delighted and
mischievous chuckles, was to lead the trading outfit on a wild
goose chase.</p>

<p>"We kin toll 'em up into the bad lands, and scatter and leave'
em thar!" they cried.</p>

<p>This would be annoying; and highly satisfactory. But only an
annoyance: only a temporary expedient. Scatter as they might the
mountain men must eventually round back to their trapping
grounds.</p>

<p>"And don't believe for a moment they are not good enough to
follow," said Kelly. He had been thinking; and now came to a
decision. "Look here," said he, "I have a plan." He looked about
him at the dozen weather-beaten faces turned expectantly toward
him, eyeing them thoughtfully one after the other. He nodded
briefly in satisfaction. Mountain men all; here present by test of
survival. "We three&mdash;Joe, this lad, and myself&mdash;have an
errand to do. We are headed for Taos and Santa Fe.</p>

<p>"After delivering a message we intend to go on north to the
mountains. Suppose we throw in together and all go that way?" He
looked again from one to the other of the faces, turned doubtful.
"Let them follow us there if they want to. What between the
Comanches and the <i>jornada</i> we can deal them plenty of grief.
I don't think they'll try it. Even if they wanted to face the
journey they'd know what to expect at the other end. Traders don't
get much of a welcome out there. By moving rapidly we can make it
back to the mountains by the prime of the fur. With as strong a
party we won't have any trouble getting through the Comanche
country: and as for the <i>jornada</i>, Joe here has made it and
knows the way."</p>

<p>Bill Williams spat into the fire.</p>

<p>"The Injins is all right," said he slowly, "and I ain't seen no
kentry yet so tough I was askeered of it. But I don't aim to spend
no time in a greaser calaboose."</p>

<p>The others nodded agreement.</p>

<p>Kelly hesitated, pondering.</p>

<p>"I'll talk turkey," he decided. "This errand of ours is a sort
of government matter. The men who carry the message won't be
bothered by the greasers. I'll guarantee that."</p>

<p>"Nobody can guarantee nothin' with greasers," insisted Bill
Williams stubbornly.</p>

<p>"All right," said Kelly. "We're going, anyway. This is Senator
Benton's business," he added.</p>

<p>The name evidently made an impression. They discussed the
matter. Gradually they yielded. It was agreed that they were taking
a chance. But to these men taking chances was habitual. Once
decided, they veered as strongly from doubt to a growing relish of
the idea.</p>

<p>"As far as Painted Rock," Kelly pointed out, "we'll be following
the old trace to the Platte. There's where the way forks."</p>

<p>"And that's what I'm a goin' to <i>cache</i> somewhar whar I kin
ketch a sight of that burgeway's face when he finds we've done
turned south!" cried Bill Williams. "Got some money, anybody? I got
to git me some powder and lead."</p>

<p>The men arose from their places about the fire. Each went in a
different direction, busy with various last-minute preparations for
setting out. Abruptly as though cut off with a knife, the waiting
phase had ended. An hour ago it had seemed to Andy that he was
doomed to linger forever but just within the edge of the West to
which for so long his eyes had turned. Now he was to start
to-morrow. He too sought out and reviewed, for the hundredth time,
the few simple items of his equipment. He took from beneath his
blankets the long Kentucky rifle that had belonged to his
grandfather, the friend of Boone. Though he had only that morning
put it in order, he drew forth the ramrod and worm and oiled its
bore again. As he laid it back under the blankets he patted it
softly. Kelly's voice above him caused him to blush with boyish
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"You'll find plenty for it to do," said the older man.</p>

<p>Kelly was not often expansive: but this evening he was filled
with an elation that must find vent. "A good evening's work," he
told Andy with satisfaction. "Nothing could have turned out better.
I'd rather have that lot with me than the whole United States
Army."</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Once the horses were caught up it did not take long to make a
start. Although each man by custom was provided with two pack
horses, besides his riding animal, they were for the purpose of
later transportation of the fur take, and now had small burdens of
the simple trapper outfits. Ten minutes sufficed to saddle and
pack.</p>

<p>But the driving in and catching up of the pastured horses was
not so easy. They were fresh and "sassy." Even the experienced,
well-trained beasts proposed to have a little fun before
submitting. Andy had an opportunity to appreciate the fierce and
ungoverned temper of some of the men with whom he had thrown
in.</p>

<p>One trapper, named Tilton, had listened to Joe Crane's
vociferous partisanship and had bought himself a mule. On this
morning he tried to lead it, as one would a horse, by a rope about
its neck. The mule refused. The man insisted, leaning his whole
weight on the rawhide rope. The mule choked, twisted its neck,
braced its hooves, backed slowly. Tilton commanded, jerked, and
swore. The mule closed its eyes, partly from the choking, partly
from sheer stubbornness. Joe Crane happened by.</p>

<p>"Throw you a hackamore around his nose," he advised. "Then he'll
foller you like yore shadder. A mule won't lead by the neck."</p>

<p>Tilton, red-faced, perspiring, paid him no attention.</p>

<p>"Throw you a hackamore," repeated Joe. "You'll git nowhere
thataway."</p>

<p>"Hush up!" bawled Tilton. "By God, this mule's goin' to lead
like I want him to."</p>

<p>It was evident that the man was as obstinate as the mule, and
that now Tilton would rather die than compromise on the hackamore.
But it was not he who died. With a suddenness that left Andy
gasping, he snatched a heavy buffalo pistol from his belt and shot
the mule dead. Nobody commented, either then or later.</p>

<p>For ten days the excursion was to Andy a continuous and
delightful picnic. The route led through a beautiful rolling
landscape, at first of preponderant hardwood forest; then of plains
and woodland; finally of open grass-lands adorned with groves of
timber, as though planted, like a park. The country was perfectly
safe. Indeed, after the last of the scattered crude farms had been
passed, they for a long time laid eyes on no human being. The
trappers rode scattered, in small shifting groups, talking,
singing, or lost in the profound long patience of the wayfarer. The
pack animals were driven forward in a loose group in charge of two
men. Someone was always away on either flank attending to the
commissary, and would rejoin the cavalcade at close of day, the
strings of his saddle dangling with wild turkey, squirrels, coons,
and prairie chickens, with sometimes a deer strapped on behind the
cantle. Before the farmlands had been left behind the contribution
was quite likely to include a young pig or a half-dozen domestic
chickens; with possibly an irate farmer not far astern to be
overawed. Evenings about the campfire Andy lay on his back and
watched the sparks against the blackness and listened to tall
tales.</p>

<p>To the trappers this was evidently only a part of the journey to
be left behind them, and they displayed little interest in their
surroundings beyond that comprehensive awareness which is second
nature to the plainsman. But it was an awareness that was set only
for certain dangers, which as yet lacked. It was blind to
everything else. But to Andy, breathing deep of the freshness of
winds from wide spaces, the days were alive with perceptions so
numerous as to jostle into merely a series of almost unrelated
impressions which he had no spiritual leisure to sort out and make
orderly. In the hardwoods the great pileated woodpeckers, large as
crows, thundered their long roll against the tree trunks; wild
pigeons roared in flight like distant surf; innumerable black and
fox squirrels chirked and chattered and chased one another madly;
occasional deer, startled from their forms, bounded away loftily,
flaunting their white flags; the new leaves shone in their
freshness like green flames, and in the colder shadows lingered the
red clusters of the maple flowers and Indian-apple blossoms. In the
grass openings golden plover covered the ground for acres; prairie
chickens arose with a whir; tiny sedge-rimmed ponds were ruffled
dark blue by the singing wind, and ducks rode bobbing like little
ships; patches of last year's grass bent soggy brown, with the new
grass green beneath; a bewildering variety of wild flowers were
abloom or preparing quietly an unfoldment&mdash;wild verbena,
indigo, larkspur, lupines, morning glories, and in the bottomlands
and ravines wild roses and hazel clumps filled with tiny busy
birds. The sky was, in general, clean and swept and blue, and in it
was space for the singing wind. It arched far above the lower air,
with its dipping flights of blackbirds and its sailing questing
hawks; high, remote, empty save for its chosen, the huge sandhill
cranes; Some were so high as to be beyond vision; but still out of
apparent emptiness came their strange harsh antiphonic cries.</p>

<p>But occasionally, sometimes after noon, fleecy clouds would
gather at the horizon. With incredible rapidity they swelled, built
up, until the heavens had blackened. The wind died, A dark silence
fell upon the earth, broken only by small frightened scurryings.
Then with a sudden vicious roar the heavens opened and torrents of
rain fell. Lightning flashed almost continuously, and the
deep-throated roll of thunder took majestic possession of the
silence. The horses turned their tails and hung their heads. The
men humped their backs. Their sodden buckskins clung to their forms
like paper. Andy had difficulty in imitating their stolid
endurance; but protection there was none, shelter there was none,
and it did no good to squirm or lament. Nevertheless he had still
far to go before attaining that peculiar command of mind which is
able to detach its attention at will from what is happening to the
body; a faculty possessed in greater or lesser degree by every
outdoor man, and <i>in excelsis</i> by those few who undergo
torture unmoved. He did, however, gain by this experience to the
elementary philosophy that things pass; and nothing is more quickly
forgotten than discomfort.</p>

<p>The extreme violence of the storm rarely outlasted the
half-hour, after which the journey was resumed. It was not
pleasant. The rain still fell. The shallow streams that so often
crossed their way were suddenly and miraculously torrents. The
horses slid and slipped, plunged and sometimes fell. A palpable and
depressing gloom filled all the air, as with an infusion. Then low
in the western horizon appeared a narrow fringe of yellow light, as
though a curtain lifted. The aperture slowly widened. Sun rays,
like bars of gold, shot through horizontally. Across the gray gloom
of the east arched the brilliance of the rainbow. Abruptly the rain
ceased. From a dripping thicket a song sparrow sang.</p>

<p>Immediately the rain had stopped every man looked first of all
to his rifle, wiping it off carefully&mdash;"before the rust sets"
as Joe explained&mdash;with the greased rag from the patch box,
examining the lock to see if water had seeped through the lock
cover, repriming, if the piece happened to be a flint gun. The
remainder of the day's journey was likely to be cold and shivery,
for a breeze followed the storm. The trappers gave no sign of
discomfort. Andy had not yet attained that hardihood. But once the
campfire had steamed him dry, he forgot it; and he listened with a
deep instinctive response, which he could not have explained, to
whippoorwills, the owls, and the chorus of frog voices from the
new-made pools.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>On the fourth morning Kelly did not start out with the
cavalcade. He packed his pack horses, turned them in with the
bunch, then rode off at right angles. Nor did he rejoin them until
late that afternoon. He nodded to the expectation on the other
men's faces.</p>

<p>"They're coming," said he. "You were right, Bill. They're
following. They're about twenty miles behind us, traveling
easy."</p>

<p>From this news the trappers appeared to get considerable
satisfaction. Two days later one of those who had ridden wide to
hunt had another report to make.</p>

<p>"Injin sign," said he briefly.</p>

<p>A thrill of excitement ran down Andy's backbone. The trappers,
however, appeared indifferent. But that evening camp was made, not
as had been the custom in a sheltered bottom, but in the open, atop
a gentle rise. The animals were grazed until dark, then picketed
close to where the men had made their beds. The fire was carefully
extinguished. Otherwise there were no precautions taken; and as
every man calmly spread his blanket or robe and prepared to turn
in, it became evident that no guard was to be placed. Andy could
not comprehend this. He nobly restrained himself for some time, but
at last could stand it no longer.</p>

<p>"Kansas tribe yereabouts," explained Joe. "No account. I ain't
sayin' they might not lift yore ha'r if enough of them caught you
out alone, and you not lookin'. They know better'n to bother with a
dozen mountain men. Besides, with that old mule of mine, don't need
no guard. He smells an Injin better'n a dog. Don't fret yore mind
about these Kansas. Steal anything they can git their hands on,
shore! Like nothin' better'n to git hold of our horses and leave us
afoot. But tackle us!" He laughed shortly.</p>

<p>Nevertheless for some hours Andy lay awake; and a half-dozen
times in the night he stirred to uneasy consciousness. Once the
snort of a horse brought him up sitting, his heart beating wildly.
In the dim starlight he could make out Joe Crane leaning on his
elbow. After a moment the mountain man lay back again.</p>

<p>Late the following afternoon, a group of mounted men appeared
silhouetted on the skyline of a rise, and sat their ponies
motionless. After an interval one detached himself and came
skimming down the slope toward the trappers. Except for a brief
appraising glance the latter paid him no attention. With superb
horsemanship the newcomer swept in a half-circle and at one plunge
brought his pony to a walk. Andy looked with all his eyes, for this
was his first plains Indian in his natural environment.</p>

<p>He saw a good-looking savage in breech clout and leggings with a
blanket flung over his left shoulder and tied under his right arm.
His head was shaved except for a narrow roached strip from nape to
brow, held upright like a cock's comb by a stiffening of vermilion.
His eyelids, cheeks, ears, and forehead were heavily rouged. From
his stretched ear lobes depended bone ornaments. On his chest he
wore two medallions. Small hollow metal buttons strung around his
neck and fringing his leggings gave forth a small musical tinkling.
He carried a long flintlock musket bound about with brass.
Altogether he made a brave and satisfactory show, looked well the
part of the prairie warrior. From one corner of his mouth projected
a leafy twig.</p>

<p>"Sign of peace," Joe explained to Andy. "He's a Kansas, apin' a
Pawnee&mdash;his top knot I mean. Kansas just leave a sculp lock,
or wear their ha'r long. This fellow thinks he's <i>some</i>."</p>

<p>The Kansas let his eyes roam deliberately from one to another of
the members of the party. Andy in his turn met them with something
of a shock, for they were strangely unlike any eyes he had ever
seen. Flat and lustreless, they seemed to stop him at their outer
surfaces. Apparently satisfied as to who was the leader, the Indian
drew alongside Kelly, laid his musket across in front of him and
began to talk in sign language. Joe, good-naturedly and a little
contemptuously, translated for Andy's benefit.</p>

<p>"Says he's a heap big chief," said Joe. "Says he's a heap big
friend of the white man. He's doin' a lot of tall braggin' now
about what a hell of a feller he is and all that. Says they's
Pawnees about. Says he's travelin' our way, him and his outfit, and
will pertect us. Braggin' again what great warriors they all is,
and how many Pawnees they's sculped. Reg'lar terror of the plains,
accordin' to him."</p>

<p>Andy watched the Indian's sweeping graceful gestures. This was
his first experience of the sign language. He had had no idea it
could convey as much and as accurately as Joe's free translation
seemed to indicate. He said so.</p>

<p>"Oh, you kin say anything you want to," said the latter. "It's a
reg'lar language. I'll larn it to you."</p>

<p>Kelly appeared to pay no attention; he seemed not even to look
at the other. But after a few moments he leaned from his saddle to
pluck from a bush a bit of green which he thrust in his hatband.
One by one the other trappers followed his example. Joe grumbled a
bit at this.</p>

<p>"I'd like to tell him to go to hell," he told Andy disgustedly.
"They'll just clutter us all up, and you want to watch your
possibles or they'll turn up missing."</p>

<p>They rode on steadily, the trappers ignoring the Kansas chief as
though he were not there. The latter seemed unembarrassed. From a
fold in his blanket he produced a small mirror and seemed to derive
much satisfaction in the contemplation of his image.</p>

<p>In the meantirne the small group on the skyline had been
augmented until it had become a great and disorderly rabble, which
streamed down the slope in a slow convergence toward the trappers
until shortly they were paralleling the line of march some fifty
yards away. There were several hundred of them in all. A few men,
evidently the upper warriors, or sub-chiefs, rode in a small
exclusive group a few paces in advance. Many of the women trudged
along on foot. Ponies carried burdens piled high and haphazard, and
atop them clung the smallest children. Naked boys with bows and
arrows ran about shouting. Dogs, also with burdens, trotted along;
and disheveled hags with sticks screamed at them and chased them
about. Most of the tribe was poverty-stricken in the extreme, and
seemed to have made no attempt at decency. Their robes or blankets
were tattered, their hair long and matted. All were dirty. They
marched without order, shifting and changing, clamoring. Each of
the men carried a green twig in his mouth, the sign of peace.</p>

<p>Toward sunset the trappers stopped in a creek bottom to make
camp. The tribe scattered about, and the squaws began to catch the
pack ponies.</p>

<p>But now Kelly asserted himself. Turning squarely in his saddle
to face the chief he made a dozen emphatic gestures. The Kansas
watched him closely. When he had finished, the Indian uttered loud
commands. The tribe regathered its scattered belongings and moved
away down the stream bed a quarter mile, where Andy could see them
moving about confusedly, making their preparations for the night.
The trappers were left alone.</p>

<p>"Consarn it, Jack;" grumbled Joe Crane, "whyn't you send them on
their way?"</p>

<p>"Rather have them near," replied Kelly briefly. "They won't try
to steal much with all their women and children within easy reach,
and I'd like to get the state of the country from them."</p>

<p>But already in twos and threes the younger male members of the
tribe were returning up the creek bottom; and soon the trappers'
camp was surrounded by them. Many merely squatted on their heels
and stared. More walked solemnly here and there, eyeing sharply
every last item of equipment. They were as annoying as gadflies.
With tireless persistence, undeterred by rebuff, they begged for
everything they saw. They asked for rum, tobacco, powder, lead,
coffee, anything and everything. The trappers paid them no
attention: they might have been thin air. Stolidly and methodically
and in silence the mountain men went about their business. Only,
Andy noticed, each kept his rifle at hand. Once or twice one or
another of the bolder Indians in the course of his urgent begging
laid hand on something he desired. Then the mountain man turned
with a throaty and menacing growl, like a bulldog. Only once did
action flash. Andy saw a hand and arm steal cautiously from the
grass screen toward a buckskin bag lying on the ground. Before he
could move or say anything a knife flashed past him to bury itself
hilt deep accurately halfway between the bag and the reaching hand,
where it quivered as a warning.</p>

<p>"I'd like to have pinned the varmint's hand," muttered Joe
Crane, striding forward to reclaim his weapon. He took off his hat,
stared at the wilting green of the twig, sighed. The Indians within
sight placed their hands over their mouths in token of wonder at
the demonstration.</p>

<p>The trappers cooked and ate their meal, caught up the grazing
horses and brought them in. Dusk was falling and the fires in the
creek bottom gleamed the brighter.</p>

<p>Now suddenly the idle visitors melted away. From the direction
of the Indian encampment Andy saw approaching a small group,
blanketed and robed. At first merely in dark silhouette, as they
neared Andy perceived them to be the same group of upper warriors
that during the march had ridden apart. Before them, several paces
in advance, strode the chief, holding at arm's length before him a
pipe whose bowl was of red stone, and whose long wooden stem was
carved and fluttering with feathers.</p>

<p>The tall trappers rose leisurely from their various occupations
and sat down in a half-circle on one side the tire. Joe dropped to
Andy's side.</p>

<p>"Well, lad," said he, "yere's more of yore eddication comin'.
Goin' to have a medicine smoke jist like these was real Injins,
'stead of a thievin' dirty lot of beggars without a sculp to their
belts, less'n they slips up on a man drunk or asleep. But you'll
larn somethin' at that, that'll come handy to you some day."</p>

<p>The warriors disposed themselves to complete the circle around
the fire. In spite of Joe's contemptuous description Andy could not
subdue a thrill of excitement. The impassive shrouded figures, the
painted faces, the shaved heads surmounted with the stiff roached
mane of the scalp locks, the glittering eyes of beadlike surface
lights, the forms of the spectators in the background half blending
with the shadows of the darkening earth, the upleap of the flames,
the slow-spreading evening of the skies were quite sufficient to
kindle his imagination. For a considerable interval no one spoke or
moved.</p>

<p>Then Kelly took the calumet from the chief's hand, stuffed it
full from the pouch at his belt, returned it. The Indian deftly
flipped a coal from the fire into the bowl and puffed at the
tobacco until it was well alight. In a low voice Joe explained to
Andy. The Kansas pointed it stem-first toward the sky&mdash;that
was for the Great Spirit; toward the earth, that was to avert
demons; then horizonally in a complete circle to call upon the help
of the beneficent elementals. Twice he puffed a cloud of smoke
toward the heavens; twice toward the earth. Then he passed the pipe
to the man at his right.</p>

<p>"Medicine smoke," whispered Joe. "Everybody's goin' to talk
straight&mdash;mebbe. If he'd give it to the man on his left,
that's jist a common smoke and everybody'd say jist what he thought
he could make stick."</p>

<p>The ensuing council was carried on between Kelly and the Kansas,
partly in the sign language, partly in a very crude English, and
partly in what was probably an equally crude Indian dialect. Noone
else said anything, but all listened with the greatest attention,
and all maintained the gravest decorum. Only after the visitors had
stalked away into the darkness did Joe tell Andy what it was all
about.</p>

<p>"Not much," he answered the boy's questions. "Pawnee young men
are out lookin' for sculps. No buffalo this side Painted Rock.
Don't know nothin' about the trace to Santa Fe&mdash;or don't want
to. Lot of braggin' about him bein' heap big Injin, and how
friendly he is."</p>

<p>For the first time Kelly that night set a horse guard. Some of
the men objected.</p>

<p>"With all their squaws'n possibles right yere to hand, they
ain't goin' to try to run off no horses," Tilton repeated Kelly's
own argument. "They couldn't move out quick enough."</p>

<p>"There may be some ambitious young men among 'em," said
Kelly.</p>

<p>As the guard was to be more a discouraging show of vigilance
than a serious matter, Andy was assigned to one of the watches. He
enjoyed himself thoroughly, pacing slowly about the picketed
horses, peering into the blackness, his rifle on the alert. The day
had been hot, and so the night was soft. The prairie-warmed wind
was breathing back toward coolness, bearing its perfume trove of
wild rose and resinweed. The earth was low and black in obeisance
to expanded skies. A deep and serene silence hovered but just
above, upheld from alighting only by the small valiant night
noises-rustlings of the breeze, the occasional soft snort of one of
the dozing animals, the barkings of the Indian dogs, the more
distant answer of the coyotes, the persistent, emphatic, reiterated
insistence of a little owl&mdash;<i>ko-ko-ko-oh,
ko-ko-ko-oh</i>&mdash;over and over again. At the end of two hours
he was relieved by Joe Crane, who laughed at him, much to his
chagrin.</p>

<p>"All you git, walkin' around like that, is a good chance to
ketch an arrow," said he. "And you can't see nothin' or hear
nothin'. Next time you git down low, right next to the ground, so's
you git things again the sky as much as you kin." He called Andy
back for another bit of information. "And mostly keep yourself
p'inted to that Buggs mule of mine. He'll tell ye."</p>

<p>Next day, when the trappers moved out, the Indians remained in
camp, much to Joe's satisfaction. The latter was now as full of
admiration for Kelly's diplomacy as he had been full of grumbles
the day before.</p>

<p>"Jack's a wolf," said he.</p>

<p>The tall mountain man had got rid of the savages by the simple
expedient of dropping a hint as to the expedition following after.
Nothing "on the prairie" in the way of gift was to be expected from
the hard-bitten trappers, but a large and wealthy trading party
offered better prospects. But Kelly had done even better. It seemed
he had, the evening before, enquired repeatedly and with great
particularity as to all sorts of details concerning the Taos trail;
the game, the water, the people. Joe had not been able to figure
why he had done so.</p>

<p>"These Injins don't know nothin' about it," said he. "They know
they'd git gobbled by the Comanches if they stuck a nose beyond
Painted Rock. Jack knows that too. I didn't git the cute of his
notion at first."</p>

<p>Andy did not get the cute of the notion even now.</p>

<p>"Why," Joe explained, "don't you see? These Injins pass it all
on to them fellers behind us: how we're interested in Taos. That'll
give them something to think about! Wagh!"</p>

<p>On the tenth day they arrived at a continuous strip of timber, a
half-mile wide by several in length, of oak, ash, elm, and hickory.
Here they lay over a day. The men spent the time in hunting. The
grove sheltered wild turkey and deer, besides an abundance of
smaller game. The vast plains, in contrast, were seemingly almost
destitute of life, save for small bands of antelope gleaming white
and tenuous in the heat shimmer. These interested Andy and aroused
his sporting spirit, for he had never seen any before, but the
trappers did not consider them worth while.</p>

<p>Joe showed Andy a circle in the grass, about forty or fifty feet
in diameter, filled with sunflowers. It marked a spot where
sometime in the past a small band of buffalo had stood compact,
cows and calves in the center, the lowered shaggy fronts of the
bulls facing out in all directions against the circling wolf
packs.</p>

<p>"Used to be plenty buffalo yereabouts," said Joe. "Sometimes a
few comes back, but mostly they's pulled out. Don't know why."</p>

<p>Joe never bothered to hunt the deer and small game on which for
the present they were subsisting. He left that to Andy and the
others. He looked with an indulgent eye on Andy's sportsman's
enthusiasm. It was good enough practice for the lad.</p>

<p>"Buffalo's the only eatin'," he insisted. "You'll see!"</p>

<p>But to-day he discouraged Andy's desire to go deer and turkey
hunting with the rest.</p>

<p>"This is the last of the hickory," said he.</p>

<p>The two spent their time hunting straight and clean shoots and
shaping them painstakingly into spare wiping rods for their rifles.
Andy noted that the hunters returned early for the same purpose.
Here the trail forked. Here the traveled trace struck north toward
the Platte and the Rockies. Here the little company would turn
southwest toward the unknown.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Near the close of the afternoon a dark speck topped the rise of
land to the east and descended the slope. The trappers suspended
their various occupations to watch it. The horses stopped grazing
and picked up their ears.</p>

<p>The speck defined itself at last as a lone horseman swinging
along at an easy gallop.</p>

<p>"White man," said Joe after a little. "Way he rides," he
explained to Andy, "and you'll never see an Injin all alone that
way." They watched in silence the steady approach.</p>

<p>"It's Bill Sublette," one recognized the newcomer after a
little. "Wagh!"</p>

<p>With one accord they seemed to fall back into a flint-like
stolidity as into some fourth dimension of remoteness, from the
shelter of which they watched warily. The lone horseman brought his
horse to a stand. Andy saw a lean keen face, a lean wiry form
bending easily to the movement of the horse, a pair of piercing
blue eyes. With a shock of surprise Andy recognized the fact that
the stranger could not be very much older than himself.</p>

<p>"Howdy," the man greeted the silent watchful trappers.</p>

<p>For an appreciable pause no one spoke.</p>

<p>"'Light and eat," then said Kelly briefly.</p>

<p>Sublette swung himself from his saddle, removed the gear from
his horse, slapped the animal on the rump. It was a magnificent
beast, tall, well-boned, straight-backed.</p>

<p>The eyes of the impassive men followed it with a flicker of
admiration as it trotted off high-headed to join the herd grazing
on the rich grass of the bottomland. The flicker died.</p>

<p>Sublette appeared unaware of the withdrawn, almost unfriendly
attitude; or he chose to ignore it. At a considerable distance from
the fire he piled his saddle gear; unstrapped the robe from his
saddle and spread it; laid beside it his long rifle; made the other
simple dispositions of the plainsman's bivouac. When this was
accomplished he strode back to the fire and squatted on his heels.
He accepted in silence the roasted deer ribs and the tin cup of
coffee which Kelly as silently offered him, and proceeded
composedly to make his meal. No word was spoken. The trappers sat,
withdrawn, watchful, noncommittal. Only their eyes moved.</p>

<p>The visitor finished his meal, wiped clean his knife, produced a
pipe. Kelly held toward him his tobacco pouch, which Sublette
accepted. Kelly filled his own pipe. For a few moments they smoked
in silence.</p>

<p>"I am told you go to Taos," Sublette spoke suddenly.</p>

<p>Kelly made no reply.</p>

<p>"I cannot guess why you do this except you imagine I am
following you and you wish to shake us off."</p>

<p>Two or three of the trappers glanced toward one another in
amusement at the accuracy of this surmise. Kelly still said
nothing.</p>

<p>"If that is the case," continued Sublette, "You are unecessarily
alarmed. We have no wish to crowd in on your trapping grounds."</p>

<p>This was too much for Tilton, the red-haired. "Then why follow
us!" he cried with indignation.</p>

<p>"To make money," replied Sublette. "If you will listen to me I
will tell you how. But if you're going to fight me before I begin,
as you have invariably done back in the settlements, it is
useless."</p>

<p>"Say on; we're listening," said Kelly briefly.</p>

<p>"I don't aim to crowd into your country," said Sublette. "I aim
to trade for fur. And the principal people I want to trade with is
you. I aim to furnish you with everything you can get in St. Louis
right on the ground, and will take your furs from you at St. Louis
prices. That saves you nigh to two thousand miles of journey.
There's sense in that, isn't there? Since Manuel Lisa quit that's
about the best you can do, isn't it? And I'll guarantee none of my
people shall trap in the <i>pays d' enhaut</i>&mdash;at least, as
long as I get the fur from you."</p>

<p>"What you carryin' along sich a mob fer if you ain't a-goin' to
trap the kentry?" demanded Tilton.</p>

<p>"I expect to do some trapping, but I'll keep them in the low
country, and to run buffalo," promised Sublette. "They are working
for me."</p>

<p>"It's taken me eight 'year to larn my district in the Rockies,"
spoke up Bill Williams, "and I don't 'low&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kelly silenced him with a gesture.</p>

<p>"How do we know you'll keep your word?" he asked bluntly. "We've
heard that sort of talk before."</p>

<p>"If I get the fur, why not?" asked in his turn Sublette, taking
no offense. "If you find my men anywhere pushing back into the
mountains you'll probably know what to do."</p>

<p>Several of the trappers nodded grimly at this.</p>

<p>"You admitted you were following us," Kelly shot at him.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"I did not admit that," countered Sublette. "I said you imagined
I was following you. As a matter of fact, I was not. I admit it
looks that way," he answered the unexpressed but evident
skepticism. "But if you had delayed your departure another day, you
wouid have found us ahead of you instead of behind."</p>

<p>"You expect me to believe that?" cried Tilton belligerently.</p>

<p>"I don't care whether you do or not," returned Sublette with a
trace of impatience.</p>

<p>"But you would like us to," interposed Kelly quietly. "In that
case I think you'll have to explain a little why you delayed at
Franklin for nearly a month. That is not reasonable."</p>

<p>"Look here," said the trader impatiently, "if I wanted to follow
anybody into the mountains, why should I wait for you? There've
been a half-dozen parties gone already that I might have followed
just as well. Use your common sense."</p>

<p>Kelly nodded.</p>

<p>"That's true. But there's still something that I think you'll
have to explain."</p>

<p>For the first time Sublette hesitated.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'd better lay my cards on the robe," he decided.
"What I waited for was word from my partners. That is neither here
nor there. But here is what I am going to tell you: Whether we like
it or not the old days are at an end. Very soon we are going to
fight for our fur. For the past six months we in the trade have
heard rumors of a new company opened in Boston and New York. Some
say Astor is in it, and that it is really the American Fur Company.
The plan is to do what I am doing: to transfer the trading to the
plains. Well, I just got word that the rumor is true, and that they
are going to start a Western branch. They've just forced a law
through to close the government factories. That's a first step.
That was what I was waiting to hear."</p>

<p>The mountaineers looked startled at this news.</p>

<p>"That is what is coming, and you cannot get away from it, and
you cannot keep it out. In a few years you'll either be working for
them or for us."</p>

<p>"The hell we will!" cried Bill Williams.</p>

<p>"I don't mean for wages. As to that you'll suit yourselves. But
you've got to sell your furs somewhere, and it'll be either them or
us, whether you pack them to St. Louis or bring them in to the
nearest post. That is the situation. Now I am trying to tell you it
is better to trade with us. You know us. We are plainsmen, like
yourselves; and we should stand together. We'll treat you fair,
keep out of&mdash;at least until we're forced to it&mdash;your
country, and take your fur. Do you expect they'll do that? If we do
stand together, we shall make head, for between us we know the
land; and they must find it out. If we don't stand together we
shall both be crowded out. Take your choice. We'll treat you fair.
What do these fellows care about you?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you give us all this palaver back in St. Louis?"
demanded Kelly.</p>

<p>"There was nothing certain, then, and you wouldn't have believed
us," said Sublette frankly. "I'm to look the ground over. Next year
we shall be established. General Ashley is our head," he added
impressively. "Next year, if things go right, he will take the
field in person."</p>

<p>This announcement had an effect. The trappers looked at one
another. Ashley's was a name to conjure with.</p>

<p>"Look here, men," continued Sublette persuasively, "these
Easterners are going to make a big effort. If they succeed they'll
take over our country. But it will take time for them to get
started. If we're to do anything we must stick together. That's
what I want to tell you: that and the fact that we are not trying
to follow you. We know where we are going. We're going to trap the
Missouri and the low country; we're going to see what we can do
with the Crows, the Arapahoes, and the Snakes. In the spring you'll
find us at Henry Fork, ready to take your furs. Now you can go to
Taos if you want to, but if you think you're bothering us by doing
so, you are badly mistaken. Think it over." He knocked the ashes
from his pipe, stretched his lean form, and strode away into the
gathering darkness to his robe and saddle.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Jack?" the mountain men turned to Kelly.
Their world was sadly shaken.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Kelly slowly. "If he's telling the
truth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thar's one way to find out," spoke up Tilton roughly. "Wait
and see. If he's squar', I'm with him. I don't aim to throw in with
no Yankees."</p>

<p>"And I don't aim to throw in with no traders!" cried Joe Crane.
"Traders is trouble, every time. We found that out with Lisa and
Pilcher."</p>

<p>Kelly was thoughtful. He sighed; "All things change and give
place to the new," he said. "I reckon you'll have to throw in with
traders, Joe, or go under. No question of that. Sublette is right
on one thing, anyway: the question is, which <i>do</i> we throw in
with."</p>

<p>"Wall," drawled Fitz, who had heretofore contributed nothing to
the discussion, "come to a ch'ice atween Yankees and Western men, I
know whar <i>my</i> stick floats!" His leathery face broke into a
slow grin. "And I reckon I'd as lieve have my spring likker and
possibles brung to me in the mountains as eat dust a thousand mile
for them, and back again."</p>

<p>But in spite of a partial and tentative entertainment of the
idea, it was decided to continue on to Taos, although there seemed
now to be little sense in so long a detour if Sublette was to be
believed at all. No one, however, suggested the abandonment of the
enterprise, nor did Kelly's offer to share the thousand dollars
paid by Benton for the service have much to do with it. They
pretended to themselves and to one another that the money
influenced them; and other excuses&mdash;Benton's business; perhaps
Sublette was lying; rumored new trapping grounds north of Sangre de
Cristo. But these things were not the deciding factor, which was
quite simply the unquenchable spirit of adventure which had already
made them what they were. A locked land from which so long Spanish
jealousy had excluded them! Of them all Joe Crane alone had ever
been there; and he promptly to see the inside of the calaboose and
to consider himself lucky to get out with only a warning. Taos!
Santa Fe! They lay over the horizon, shimmering in the romance of
the unknown. It would have taken more than a mere turning point in
history to have deflected them now.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-5" id="ch1-5"></a>CHAPTER 5. The Buffalo</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THE little party of mountain men moved steadily toward the
southwest. They were now four days out from Council Grove, where
they had left the trace, known to all of them, that led toward the
Rockies.</p>

<p>Those days had offered little but monotony. The grassland ran in
long earth billows. The shallow troughs between their crests were
wide. The cavalcade rode down the gentle slope; across the flat; up
the other slope. From the hollow the skyline was definite. Andy
Burnett, in his inexperience, could not rid himself of the feeling
that, once the crest was attained, he should be able to see abroad
for miles. But when he had mounted the summit he saw before him
merely another billow of the earth.</p>

<p>There was no game outside a few bands of antelope, but smaller
life was abundant. The brown grass of last year still stood; the
green grass below it had not yet laid it low. Through it scurried
rabbits and the littler rodents. Savannah sparrows and buntings
swung from its blades; horned larks rose from its openings.
Overhead sparrow hawks hung as though suspended, their wings
vibrating, their sharp eyes cocked for a mouse or a bird. Curiously
enough, in spite of the wide sweep of country, the scale of size
was diminished. A coyote loping off looked as big as an elk: the
cavalcade of horsemen were monstrous. This was due to the abundance
of little things&mdash;the lack of tree or tiniest shrub; only the
blades of grass.</p>

<p>These conditions, Andy found, made for modifications in life.
There was now no fuel to be had, and little game. The company had
to fall back largely on the meat it had dried&mdash;or
"jerked"&mdash;before reaching Council Grove. This, unleavened
bread from the small store of flour, and coffee constituted the
whole diet. The only possible fire was from the resinweed. It
flared up hot, blazed for a few seconds and was gone. It was not
good fuel, but by constant attention the men managed to make it do
for their simple cooking. Campfires were, of course, entirely out
of the question.</p>

<p>"We'll git to the short grass purty quick," said Joe Crane.
"Then there'll be a plenty of buffalo chips. And buffalo, if the
critters ain't all moved north. I don't know how they act down
thisaway."</p>

<p>The men no longer rode in as careless a formation as before
reaching Council Grove. They held together in a compact group, with
the pack animals in the center. On approaching the crest of each of
the earth billows someone trotted ahead to examine the next trough.
The day's march was ended in mid-afternoon, the horses grazed under
the eye of a mounted herdsman. At dark they were driven in and
picketed close up to the camp. No guard was set for the first part
of the night. Near one or two o'clock, however, Kelly aroused one
of the sleepers who had been designated the night before. The man,
instantly broad awake, shivering a little, arose in silence.
Outside the horse herd he lay flat&mdash;or merely sat down if the
terrain was favorable&mdash;his rifle at hand.</p>

<p>"Not one chance in a thousand for Injins in this kentry," Joe
told Andy. "Nothin' to bring 'em here. Only chance would be a party
travelin' to git through, same as we are. But the p'int is, they
wouldn't any Injins be goin' through, less'n it was a war party on
their way to raid the Kansas or Osages or mebbe to take a try at
the Pawnees. And war parties is bad medicine, especially Comanche
war parties. It's a slim chance, but when it comes to Injins you
take <i>no</i> chances."</p>

<p>Andy, as usual when Joe became instructive, showed his interest.
Joe, encouraged, went on.</p>

<p>"Then they's scouts. Injins is great hands to send out a scout
or two just to look around. And they's always a young buck or two
projectin' out on his own hook to pick up a sculp or so. You see,
Andy, an Injin lad ain't got a show in the world till he can show
one sculp. When they call him growed up they give him a powwow and
a medicine dance; and then he's supposed to go out with his gang
and not come back till he's got him an enemy sculp. Then he's a
warrior. If he comes back without one, he just ranks with squaws,
and the gals won't have nothin' to do with him. He has to go to
work, and the women can order him around. I've knowed 'em to be
away nigh a year before they had any luck. When they been out that
long&mdash;or a good sight less&mdash;they're gittin' kind of
desp'rate, They ain't so partic'lar whether it's an enemy sculp or
not. All ha'r looks alike. That's one reason it don't pay to git
keerless. Now you take the Crows. Crows in gin'ral has always been
friendly to us mountain men. If you ever meet up with a Crow
village, ride right in and make yoreself to home. And if you meet
up with a real Crow war party, ride right up to them. Probably
they'll try to git you to j'ine them for a leetle sport with the
Arapahoes or Snakes or mebbe the Blackfeet. Though they don't
tackle the Blackfeet much. But I'd hate like p'is'n to meet up with
any of the young 'uns headin' home without no sculp to show. Good
idee to look 'em over afore you declar' yoreself. If they look
young and hungry and you don't see no ha'r on their leggin's, you
<i>cache.</i>"</p>

<p>Joe grinned at Andy's interest.</p>

<p>"Crows is good people, too," he added. "You got nice black ha'r,
Andy. Don't be gettin' keerless."</p>

<p>"Wagh!" agreed Fitz, who was listening.</p>

<p>"That's why they's liable to be some strays, even in this grass
kentry," Joe concluded his instruction. "'Course they won't bother
us. An Injin's got sense, and twelve long rifles is <i>too</i> big
odds. If we got keerless and scattered out, and lay around
promiscuous, and left our horses stray, they might go back and tell
the Old Man they's easy pickin's on the prairie."</p>

<p>"If I were an Indian I'd wait until we were all sound asleep,
and then make a quick dash and kill the lot of us," suggested Andy,
who had long been uneasy over the lack of precaution the first part
of the night.</p>

<p>"If you was an Injin you'd act like an Injin," countered Joe
good-naturedly. "An Injin never makes a move much afore daylight in
the morning. That's one thing you can count on. There ain't
many."</p>

<p>"Why is that?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"Skeered," said Joe, "skeered of spirits. All the bad spirits
prowl around night times. Shore they do! Don't the streams and
waterfalls hush up at night? Don't the mountains throw big rocks
all night?"</p>

<p>"Do they?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"Shore they do! Snow quits melting. Water drops, and so the
streams git small. Rocks that has been froze in gits loosened by
the sun and takes a tumble when the ground freezes up again and
gives 'em a push. You and I knows that. But we ain't Injins.
Night's full of funny noises. All spirits. Why looka here, Andy;
you take notice. You'll never see an Injin carryin' a grooved
bar'l. What guns they got is all smooth-bore. That's one reason you
kin stand up and let an Injin shoot at you, barrin' accidents, till
further orders. They won't tech a rifled gun. For why? Because the
bullet whines. More spirits! Wall, I ain't a-goin' to tell them ary
different! So don't worry about no Injins till long toward dawn.
Then keep yore eyes shining."</p>

<p>Andy was learning fast. When his turn came to stand guard he
knew enough to keep low, to silhouette the earth's surface as much
as he could, to lie quiet, and to listen.</p>

<p>Before the party had left the long-grass country he had one
exciting experience. That day they had come to the first sign of
human activity. Left to his own inexperience Andy would never have
recognized it as such. It manifested itself first merely as a thin
pinkish milky haze filming the western horizon. He would probably
not have noticed it at all, had it not been for his companions.
From them he learned that the haze was smoke from a distant grass
fire.</p>

<p>"Oh, it ain't going to bother us none," Joe told him. "The old
grass is too old and the new grass too green to burn fast. But it
means somebody has sot her, and that means keep yore eyes
shining."</p>

<p>They came up to the fire, which was eating its way <i>very</i>
slowly forward in a long and irregular fringe of low flames, so low
and narrow that an active man might easily leap across. Behind them
the country, but slightly blackened, showed green with the new
grass. It was a lazy fire. Its only activity was supplied by a
swarm of birds that darted back and forth through the smoke, and
chattered shrilly, apparently excited almost to lunacy by the
catastrophic possibilities. In reality they were catching the
insects driven up by the flames and stupefied with the smoke; and
surely such abundance was enough to drive any hard-working bird
into a frenzy.</p>

<p>The trappers camped that night to windward of the fire. As night
came on the fire seemed to gain in power; though this was probably
an illusion strengthened by the dusk. The eastern sky was for a
time pink with the reflected light after sunset. Then the moon
rose, blood-red in the smoke.</p>

<p>That night Andy stood the before-dawn watch. The fire fascinated
him. In imagination it was an army outpost of campfires, extending
miles to beyond the horizon: a serpent winding its crooked way; a
slow tide coming in on a broken beach. Occasionally a clump of
resinweed would catch and flare high, like a torch. As morning
neared a breeze sprang up that quickly freshened to a wind. The
flames rose like snakes rearing to look, bent flattened by a gust,
reared again, throwing defiant sparks.</p>

<p>From his place low to the ground Andy watched them, fascinated.
Between the fire and the camp stood tall resinweed in bunches four
or five feet high, bending in the rising wind. If the wind should
change...but then, Andy remembered, these morning winds never did
change. It was a beautiful sight. Andy found his eyes straying back
to it constantly; and it was only by an effort of the will that he
turned them to the shadowed west whence, if anywhere, danger might
be expected. For a long time he peered vigilantly, then permitted
himself another look toward the fascination of the flames.</p>

<p>His heart leaped to his throat. Dark figures, dozens of them,
were darting here and there, stooping low, surrounding the little
camp, firing the resinweed&mdash;from a clump of it the flames
leaped upward with a roar. "Indians! Indians!" cried Andy at the
top of his lungs; and fired hastily at one of the crouching
figures. As he flattened himself, reloading as Joe had taught him,
he felt, rather than heard or saw, the sleeping men leap into
action. In a moment he was conscious of a touch on his leg, and the
mountain man hitched himself alongside.</p>

<p>"What did you see, lad?" Joe's low voice came to his ear.</p>

<p>"See them?" the boy's voice shook with excitement in spite of
himself. "There! There! They're setting fire to the resinweed!"</p>

<p>For a moment the trapper peered in the direction Andy indicated.
Then with a laugh he got to his feet. "Stand up, boy, and take a
look!" he advised aloud.</p>

<p>Andy stood up. He looked and closed his eyes and looked again.
The shadowy hurrying figures had vanished as though dismissed by
magic. They had been an illusion evoked by his position so near the
ground; the flames, hurried by the wind behind the swaying clumps,
had conjured the appearance of crowds moving in the opposite
direction. So vivid was the deception that Andy had to stoop again
to convince himself. He accompanied Joe to the camp, burning with
mortification.</p>

<p>The trappers, however, did not reproach him or laugh at him, for
which he was absurdly grateful. Indeed they made no reference to
the matter, but seemed to take the dissipation of the alarm quite
as a matter of course. Kelly remarked that it was near dawn anyway,
and they might as well cook up. They kindled their brief small fire
of resinweed and set over it the coffee pot. The business of
getting under way proceeded in usual train. Andy obliterated
himself. His face was still red with humiliation. Still no
reference whatever was made to the affair. Only, when Andy had
finished packing his pack animals and turned to mount his horse, he
found neatly tied to his saddle horn a clump of resinweed.</p>

<p>"Didn't want you to go off leavin' yore first sculp," said
Joe.</p>

<p>The trappers' leathern faces were grave. Andy caught no faintest
twinkle in their eyes.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Abruptly the character of the country changed. The high
luxuriant grasses disappeared. Their place was taken by a short
curly growth so insignificant that after the lusher plains the
prairies seemed almost barren.</p>

<p>"Buffalo grass," Andy was told. "Wuth two fer one of common
grass." Certainly the horses seemed to think so.</p>

<p>About this time the fuel problem was solved by quantities of dry
buffalo chips. Trough-like trails worn deep in the hard soil, round
"wallows;" broad highways of trampled earth; the fairy rings of old
herd formations further attested the beasts' abundance. But these
were all old sign.</p>

<p>One night Andy was awakened by a noise. It was not a loud noise,
and was very distant. There were a thousand nearer and louder that
had not disturbed him. But this was unusual. Andy had made this
much progress towards plainscraft; that his senses discriminated,
even subconsciously. He raised on his elbow, to find Joe also
listening.</p>

<p>"Lobo wolf," whispered the trapper. The long, weird, mournful
ululation again shivered across the moonlight. "Good sign fer game.
Them varmints don't bother with prairie dogs and rats and sich,
like the coyotes. Listen at him! In a minute he'll quit." Joe
partly threw off his blanket and filled his pipe. "Funny thing
about wolves," he went on in a low voice, once the tobacco was
alight. None of the sleepers stirred. Joe's voice rang no bell of
alarm in that part of their consciousness that guarded. Any one of
them would have leaped to alertness at the smallest unwarranted
rustling. "Coyotes howls all the time. Wolves mostly tune up at
midnight and at daybreak; and that's about all."</p>

<p>"I did not know they were such a silent beast," whispered
Andy.</p>

<p>"Oh, they bark, sort of short and snarling, most any time. But
they saves their howls. I like to hear him. Means meat. Buffalo, I
hope. Perhaps only elk. Or mebbe he's just scouting. I hear only
one. I'd ruther hear Old Man Raven croak. He's the fellow don't git
fur from supplies."</p>

<p>The howl of the wolf proved to be a reliable omen. The very next
morning Andy saw his first buffalo.</p>

<p>It was a lone bull. They came upon him at close range, and
suddenly, over the top of a low rise. He was ancient and thin, and
the fur on his hide was off in patches, but the hair of his head
and shoulders was still long and shaggy. He stood alone, at bay. A
pack of gray wolves circled warily but just out of reach of his
lunge, their eyes ablaze with the eagerness of the chase, trotting
this way and that before the old warrior. The buffalo turned
constantly. His enemies were trying to get to his rear to hamstring
him. Once down he would be at their mercy. He was trying in vain to
face them all. Every once in a while one of the wolves darted in,
snapped hastily at the old fellow's hind quarters, darted out again
as he whirled in that direction.</p>

<p>So occupied were all concerned that not one of them noticed the
men and horses, even when by common impulse they drew rein only ten
or fifteen yards from the outside circumference of this strange
battle. For some minutes the trappers leaned on the pommels,
watching. It was evident the issue could not be long in doubt.
Already the old buffalo was bleeding from a half-dozen shallow
wounds where the sharp teeth of the wolves had snapped home. His
sides heaved painfully. His tongue hung out, and a light foam blew
away from his half-opened mouth. Each fresh attack he met more
slowly, less certainly. The wolves were growing bolder, drawing
closer their circle, darting in more frequently.</p>

<p>Kelly looked from one to the other of his companions. "What say,
boys? Shall we give them one?" he asked.</p>

<p>By way of assent the men leisurely dismounted. The flint-gun men
thumbed up the frizzens, shook in the priming powder.</p>

<p>"All ready?" said Kelly. "Let her go!"</p>

<p>A ragged volley rang out. A half-dozen of the marauders wilted
or rolled over. One, caught at full speed by some sporting
marksman, turned a complete somersault. The rest of the pack,
surprised and bewildered, stopped short in full career, stared
about them; seemed only slowly to realize the situation; only
slowly to replace the eagerness of the kill with their customary
sense of self-preservation. A few loped away; a few trotted. One or
two even hesitated, snarled, bared their teeth. The trappers
dropped the butts of their long rifles to earth, laughing in their
silent fashion, immensely diverted.</p>

<p>Andy had welcomed Kelly's suggestion with a leap of joy. He had
been the first afoot; the first to stand quiveringly eager for the
word to fire. The wolf he had picked out as his mark had gone down
satisfactorily. Now, while his companions stood in relish of the
incident, he was hastily but methodically reloading. He was full of
excitement and what might almost have been described as an
indignant lust of battle. His sympathies had been strongly enlisted
by the old buffalo's gallant stand. Nevertheless in spite of his
eagerness he recharged the piece accurately, without mistake or
false motion. The deer-horn charger he filled to the exact brim.
The powder went into the barrel without the loss of a grain. The
ball was precisely centered on the patch. He drove it home with the
deft neat thrust from the wrist that seated it exactly, but without
undue pressure. He capped the rifle without a fumble. He was quite
unconscious of the fact that the trappers were watching him
attentively.</p>

<p>The remainder of the pack had come together and were loping away
across the prairie. But they were not yet wholly reconciled to the
turn of events. Every few yards one or the other of them stopped,
turned, half reared to look back. As Andy finished loading, one of
them did just this. Only its head and its forward-pricked ears were
visible above the fringe of grass. Still heated with his
partisanship of what had been a losing battle, Andy steadied the
long rifle, and as the bead, nestling clearly in the notch of the
rear sight, came to rest, he pulled trigger.</p>

<p>"Good shot!" cried Kelly.</p>

<p>"Wagh!" cried several voices.</p>

<p>Andy looked around, awakened from his absorption, a little
confused to find himself the center of attention. Joe Crane was
capering about delightedly.</p>

<p>"I told you!" he addressed them all in general. "He makes them
<i>come</i>!" He seemed suddenly informed with a pride of
proprietorship in the boy. "And did you see him load! Spilled nary
a grain and quicker'n ary rattlesnake coils. Forty rod, full, or
I'm a horny toad. And I'll bet any of you a plew of beaver plumb
atween the eyes!" He clapped Andy so heartily between the shoulder
blades as almost to overset him; then tore away across the prairie
to the dead wolf.</p>

<p>"Ef you kin do it thataway right along yo'll save yore ha'r yet,
Andy," said Bill Williams. Andy was embarrassed. He did not know
where to turn. He tried to recover himself by setting about
recharging his rifle.</p>

<p>Joe was back again waving the wolf scalp, his hands daubed with
gore.</p>

<p>"Plumb atween the eyes!" he cried triumphantly. He rushed up to
Andy and with a bloody forefinger smeared the boy's forehead.
"That'll make ye wise like a wolf; and they's no animal wiser." He
tore from Andy's saddle the withered bunch of resinweed, which Andy
had been too proud to remove, and in its place tied the wolf scalp.
"Workin' up," said he with satisfaction. "You'll have real ha'r
there yet!" He patted Andy again on the shoulder. "You make' em
<i>come</i>!" he repeated. A sudden thought checked him. "Has she
got a name?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"What?" Andy found his voice, puzzled.</p>

<p>Joe laid his hand on the long rifle.</p>

<p>"The Boone gun," said Joe.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I suppose it must have. I never heard it."</p>

<p>"Well, she has now. Old Knock-'em-stiff, that's her!"</p>

<p>"Let's get on," said Kelly.</p>

<p>They mounted and turned away. The buffalo bull still stood in
the middle of the trampled ground, his head low, his eyes fixed
dully on the scattered bodies of his assailants. Andy looked
back.</p>

<p>"What about him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He's too old and stringy," returned Joe, misunderstanding the
purport of the question. "Cast bull: druv out of the herd. Whar
there's one there's others. We'll find fat cow shortly."</p>

<p>"But what will become of him? Will he get well?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the wolves'll git him to-night," replied the Mountain Man
indifferently. "What you doin'?" he asked, as Andy dismounted.</p>

<p>The boy did not reply. Slowly he walked back to where the
buffalo stood, his front still lowered in defiance of imaginary
enemies. For several seconds he stood contemplating the forlorn old
creature. Then for the third time he raised the rifle, for the
third time the silvered bead came steadily to rest on its mark. At
the crack of the piece the old bull sank forward on his knees;
slowly rolled to its side; stretched out as though to rest, with a
tired sigh.</p>

<p>"Now whatever did you do that for, Andy!" Joe demanded in
astonishment as the boy remounted. Andy did not reply. Thus he
killed his first buffalo. For the moment he felt that he never
wanted to kill another.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>This sentiment, naturally, faded when tested by the excitement
of the game in numbers and abundance. Not long after the episode of
the cast bull they saw a small band of twenty or thirty individuals
in the middle distance, showing black and immense upon the short
grass; and soon afterwards others and others of similar groups,
until the whole extent of the plain to the north was dotted with
them here and there. Andy had never conceived of wild game in such
numbers; but his companions made light of his amazement. According
to them he had not even begun to see buffalo. These few and
scattered individuals were negligible.</p>

<p>As time to camp drew near, one of the men loped on ahead.
Shortly they heard the distant faint <i>ping</i> of his rifle: and,
turning in that direction, came upon him after a considerable ride
seated on the carcass of a cow, smoking his pipe. He half
apologized for taking them so far; the buffalo were scarce; this
was the first cow he could find near water.</p>

<p>Andy hovered about the butchering, fascinated by the deftness
with which they went at it. It was so different from the dressing
of tame meat. Four of them heaved the carcass on its belly,
spreading the legs to hold it in that position. Then one slit the
hide along, the spine, and the skin was peeled away on either side,
so that it lay flat on the prairie, a spread mat beneath the
carcass, protecting the meat from contamination by the earth. They
cut out the tongue; they peeled away the hump and back strap, which
they piled on the skin. One of the men carefully filled his canteen
with blood from the body cavity. Andy experienced a slight heave at
the stomach. Others skinned back and chopped off the leg bones.</p>

<p>"Guess that's about all," said Bill Williams.</p>

<p>With a mighty heave the body was rolled aside. Bill Williams,
with his tomahawk, opened the ribs and from within carefully
extracted certain tidbits. The whole they wrapped in the hide,
slapped it across a pack, and moved a few hundred yards to the
water spoken of by the hunter. It was murky and fouled by the
beasts, undrinkable except as boiled with coffee, and then with a
strong menagerie flavor. Andy controlled his squeamishness with
difficulty; but times were to come when he was to remember the
tepid nauseous stuff with longing. But the abandonment of so much
good meat bothered him.</p>

<p>"Oh, we got enough for everybody," Joe assured him. "Yore eyes
is gittin' bigger'n yore belly."</p>

<p>He could not comprehend Andy's idea of waste. There would be
plenty more to-morrow. Later, when it seemed they might be running
out of the herd, would be time enough to begin to save meat. When
finally he understood the boy's point of view, he was amazed.</p>

<p>"Why, they's plenty buffalo," said he. He laughed a little at
Andy as having been brought up on a farm with a few cattle. "You
ain't seen buffalo yit," he assured the lad. "These is nothing." He
tried to give Andy an idea. Not hundreds, nor thousands, but
millions, moving across the wide-flung country like locusts. The
earth black with them from horizon to horizon.</p>

<p>"I've traveled six days through them, movin' steady," said Joe,
"solid pack. And then three days more of little bunches, like these
yere, afore we got out onta clear plains agin. One time we couldn't
move at all for three days. Too thick to break through. Had to
roost top of a little rise. You'll see."</p>

<p>What did the few killed by man for his uses amount to? Nothing
as compared to the stupendous natural waste incident to their mere
numbers. Prairie fires in the dry of the year leaped on the fleeing
herds like savage beasts and swept on, leaving the plains strewn
with bodies, staggering with blind, singed victims. Stampedes
trampled down the young and the weak by thousands. The ice of the
rivers broke beneath their weight, and the swollen current of the
spring thaws carried downstream, for days and days, a continuous
line of the drowned.</p>

<p>"An old Nor'wester, name of MacDonnell, told me he counted
atween seven and eight thousand drowned bufalo floatin' past his
post; and then he got sick of countin' and quit," said Joe, "and of
course that was just a few of the main herd that was out of
luck."</p>

<p>And in addition wolves and coyotes always hovering about the
herds to snatch down a calf or a yearling or to pounce upon some
old cast bull like the one of that morning, swarms of them. All of
them made a living. In face of this orgy of nature's waste what
effect the few hundreds or the few thousands appropriated by man,
white or red, for his own uses? Or even the additional few
thousands sacrificed, perhaps, to his wantonness?</p>

<p>"Why, if we all had a ton of powder and lead apiece," concluded
Joe, "and done nothin' but shoot buffalo from now till Christmas
time, we wouldn't make a dent in the outlyin' fringe of one herd!
The man who eats brisket when he can git hump is just a tarnation
fool. Wagh!"</p>

<p>Andy turned in his saddle to look back. He was amazed. The
carcass had almost disappeared. Only a partly dismembered framework
remained, half visible through a black and flopping crowd of
vultures. Other vultures soared and beat their wings just above.
Still others, their wings held away from their bodies, sat upright
on the ground, disgruntled or gorged. A dozen coyotes weaved
restlessly back and forth. Joe too looked back: and laughed.</p>

<p>"Ain't much wasted thar!" said he.</p>

<p>They roasted the meat. Andy thought he had never tasted anything
so delicious. Joe triumphed.</p>

<p>"What I tell you!" he cried. "That's <i>eatin'</i>!"</p>

<p>Andy sighed with repletion; eyed a choice bit uncertainly; gave
up the idea.</p>

<p>"Couldn't get down another mouthful," he confessed. "Lord, I'm
full! Guess I'll turn in!"</p>

<p>"No you don't!" cried Joe. "That's jist the first course to sort
of take off the edge."</p>

<p>One of the men put over a pot of water to heat. Others busied
themselves in cracking the leg bones and deftly extracting the
marrow, which they dropped into the pot. The man who had filled his
canteen with blood produced it and stirred in its contents.</p>

<p>"Git yore cups," cried the one who was doing the cooking, after
about five minutes. "Next course!"</p>

<p>Andy tasted the mess gingerly and with misgivings. "Why, it's
good!" he cried surprised. The marrow had melted. The whole had
cooked into a rich, well-flavored soup.</p>

<p>The remark was greeted by a general laugh. Under the stimulus of
feast after comparative famine the customary silent gravity had
broken into a comfortable and expansive good-fellowship. Even the
dour and saturnine countenance of Bill Williams bore the slightly
fatuous satisfaction of a well-fed baby. They filled their pipes
and smoked awhile. A comfortable drowsiness seemed to fall upon
their spirits. The smoldering little fire died to acrid coals.
About as Andy was sinking to a doze of repletion, Fitz roused
himself.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys, time for dessert," said he.</p>

<p>They stirred lazily to action. One coaxed up the fire. By its
feeble light others, volunteers, set about further preparations. On
the clean inner surface of the buffalo's skin they proceeded
carefully to chop a portion of the backstrap into a fine hash. As
soon as a sufficient quantity of this had been prepared they
stuffed it into cleaned intestines; stuck them on sticks; and
roasted them over the coals.</p>

<p>"Thar!" said Joe, proffering one of these sausages to Andy.
"Stick that in yore face, and tell me if you ever tasted any better
in yore settlemints!"</p>

<p>"I can't!" protested Andy. "I'm full way up to here!"</p>

<p>"Wagh! Eat!" commanded the trapper. "If yore goin' to be a
mountain man you got to larn to swell yore belly out like a
dawg."</p>

<p>"I'll be as sick as a dog if I do," Andy remonstrated. "I'm
full, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Wild meat'll never make you sick," said Joe emphatically. "You
can starve for a week and then eat till yore skin cracks and nary a
bellyache in a ton of it. It's tame meat makes you sick. Yere,
ketch a holt!"</p>

<p>To his surprise Andy found room for more. And it too was
delicious. But he was benumbed by food, dizzy with repletion. He
rolled into his blankets and fell instantly deep into torpor.</p>

<p>But his sleep was sound and dreamless. Morning seemed to come
instantly. He arose in its freshness full of energy and life.</p>

<p>"What I tell you?" cried Joe. "That's the stuff'll put ha'r on
yore chest! Wagh!"</p>

<p>As they rode forward that day the groups of buffalo gradually
became more numerous, until one could look in no direction without
a sight of dozens of little bands, each in charge of its vigorous
and truculent bull. When toward close of afternoon Andy learned
that more meat was to be required, he eagerly petitioned to be
appointed the hunter. His sporting blood was hot with the sight of
so much game. Receiving the desired permission he galloped ahead
until he had placed a good interval between himself and his more
slowly moving companions. Then he dismounted, tied his horse to an
old skull, and set himself to a slow stalk of one of the little
herds. He did so in approved fashion, with due concern for the
light wind currents; and so, shortly, found himself lying flat in
the short grass within a hundred yards of the animals. Some were
lying down; some were afoot, grazing. One tremendous shaggy beast
stood a few paces apart. He looked to be half again as big as any
of the others. His heart beating strongly from excitement, Andy
thrust forward the long rifle, steadied its sights for a moment on
the big beast's shoulder, and pulled trigger.</p>

<p>No result.</p>

<p>The buffalo did not budge a hair. Its companions continued to
recline or to graze.</p>

<p>It did not seem possible to have missed completely at that
distance; but there you were! Andy burned with mingled
mortification and anger at himself. He reloaded in frantic haste,
fearful that at any moment the buffalo would take alarm and depart.
They did not. Again he took aim, more carefully this time. Again he
fired. Again no apparent result.</p>

<p>After a moment the big buffalo seemed to awaken from his
meditation. He curled his tail and began to walk slowly about. It
began to look as though he had come to a reluctant conclusion that
he was getting tired of being shot at; and was thinking of waking
up his companions to a retreat. But as he turned Andy saw a thin
froth of blood at his nostrils.</p>

<p>His heart leaped in a surge of new confidence as he drove the
bullet down the barrel. Then he had not missed! He resolved that
the next shot should finish the matter. By the time the reloading
was finished, the buffalo was showing signs of weakness. He
staggered slightly. Andy arose to his feet; walked forward as
quietly as he could. All heads turned toward him: every jaw stopped
in mid-chew. For the space of time it took Andy to cover ten yards
they stared incredulous. Then instantaneously they were all afoot
and off in their strange, clumsy-looking but swift gallop. One
moment they were immobile: the next they were in full career.</p>

<p>Those lying down were no whit behind the others. They did not
get up like a cow or a horse, but seemed fairly to spring afoot and
off in one motion. Andy was completely surprised. He stared
helplessly at the cloud of dust and the half-visible black forms
weaving through it, unable to see anything clearly long enough to
deliver a shot.</p>

<p>The wounded buffalo had made off as spryly as the rest. They ran
for a quarter mile; then stopped, whirled, and looked back; stared
for a moment; turned again and once more plunged into a gallop. In
the course of their flight they had run near a number of other
small herds. These had joined them. Still others, within easy
distance to right or left, also set themselves in motion,
paralleling the first. The movement spread, until in an incredibly
brief span of time the whole plains were acrawl, and the dust
clouds rose like smoke. Andy felt he had certainly started
something!</p>

<p>Then his heart bounded with fresh hope. A single black speck had
fallen behind its fleeing companions. It slowed to a walk. It lay
down. The wounded bull!</p>

<p>The animal was evidently dying. Its nose already rested on the
earth. Andy hurried forward eagerly. But when he was still at some
distance, his quarry rose to its feet; stood for a moment
uncertainly; then appeared to gather strength and made off. Andy's
shot, hastily delivered at the distant and moving target, seemed to
take no effect.</p>

<p>But the beast did not go as far this time. It slowed to a
painful, plodding walk; at last lay down again.</p>

<p>Profiting by experience, Andy's second approach was more
cautious. But there was no concealing cover, and the plain here was
as flat as a board. Move as slowly as he might, he was still some
hundred yards distant when again the buffalo rose to his feet. This
time Andy took pains. He heard the bullet hit, and he was sure he
had held steadily for the exact shot he had selected. But the shot
had no other effect than to start the beast off more vigorously
than ever.</p>

<p>Andy's blood was up. He set himself seriously to the task. In
the next hour he got in four more shots, all at long range. He
tried sneaking: he tried running as hard as he could, hoping to get
into closer range. The last bullet did the trick&mdash;or the
cumulative effect of them all.</p>

<p>This time the buffalo did not rise again.</p>

<p>Andy reloaded and ran up. The beast was dead.</p>

<p>He came to himself. He stood alone, with his quarry, in the
middle of an emptied plain. The sun had dipped almost to the
horizon. Slowly his heart sank to dismay as he looked about him. He
had not the remotest idea of the whereabouts of his horse; of the
whereabouts of his companions; of the direction the chase had led
him. Belatedly he realized he should at least have noted its twists
and turns; the sun was plain enough in the sky.</p>

<p><i>But</i> he had not. Whether he was north, south, east, or
west of his original position he had no means of knowing. Nor could
he even remotely guess. He was lost, and lost aplenty; and he had
not the least idea of what to do about it. He cursed himself
heartily for all kinds of a fool. But that did no good. He sat down
on the dead buffalo to think it over. For a time he came near to
panic. Only by a strong effort of what might be called subconscious
common sense did he hold himself from rushing off regardless.
However, he hung onto himself. Here at least was meat. He had his
rifle, ammunition, flint and steel, a canteen of water. He would
not starve immediately. What he could do ultimately he did not
know. If he had had the faintest notion as to whether he was north
or south of the line of march, he might, by angling in the proper
direction, have cut it. But he had none.</p>

<p>By an effort of resolution he thrust aside all consideration of
the appalling difficulties in the way of his mere survival. The
thing to do was to attend to the immediate. He slit the skin above
the buffalo hump, and rather bunglingly cut out a slab of meat. He
twisted some grass into a tiny nest in the center of which he
deposited a bit of burning punk ignited by the flint and steel.
This he waved about in the air until it burst into flames. More
grass; little chips of fuel added gingerly&mdash;he had a tiny fire
which he nursed with care. The sun had almost touched the horizon.
Night hovered just beyond the rim of the world, ready to overflow,
and with it a mighty and appalling spirit of loneliness. Against it
and its engulfing terrors Andy had only the protection of his
present tasks. He moved small beneath them, executing them slowly,
spreading them thin, postponing the moment when he must front the
gathering inimical forces. He did not dare look about him lest he
meet their faces.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>So he did not see Joe Crane, leading his abandoned saddle horse,
nor suspect his presence until the mountain man spoke.</p>

<p>"Wall, bub," drawled Joe, "havin' a good time?"</p>

<p>Andy nearly leaped out of his skin. For a moment the reaction of
mingled emotions overwhelmed him. He could not speak. Strangely
enough this solution of his predicament had never occurred to
him.</p>

<p>Crane leisurely dismounted, dropped the reins of his horse to
the ground, and walked over to the buffalo. He poked the toe of his
moccasin here and there in the shaggy fur.</p>

<p>"Put enough lead in him to sink a bull boat, didn't ye?" he
commented casually. He continued his examination. A quizzical smile
curled his grave lips. "You shore picked you a good old tough one,"
said he. "Wa'nt they no cows to be had?" He stooped to inspect
Andy's butchering, and straightened his back with every appearance
of indignation. "What do you mean by that!" he cried
accusingly.</p>

<p>"What?" stammered Andy.</p>

<p>"Don't you know better than to cut good meat across the grain?"
demanded Joe. "Whar you been brung up? My God, I never <i>see</i>
sich ignorance!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm sorry; I didn't know," gulped Andy.</p>

<p>"Didn't know! Didn't know! I should say not!" grumbled Joe.
"It's a crime to spile good meat thataway! Not that it's good
meat&mdash;a tough old bull like that!" He fussed about for a
moment or so longer, muttering to himself. Then he sat down on the
buffalo and filled his pipe, watching the disconsolate Andy the
while from beneath his bushy brows. "If I didn't know you had the
makin's in you, Andy, I'd think you was a plumb fool," Said he
after a moment, "Look at what you've gone and done! Fust off you
leaves yore hoss whar ary redskin kin pick him up, and pick you up
afterwards. Then you picks you out the oldest and toughest bull in
a herd of fat cows. Then you spatters him anywheres in his carcass
regardless."</p>

<p>But Andy's reviving spirit interposed a mild objection to
this.</p>

<p>"I hit him where I aimed," he muttered. "My rifle is too light."
And indeed the bullet holes were well grouped behind the beast's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"And whar did you aim?" Joe countered relentlessly. "Don't you
know a buffalo's heart lies low? Looka here." He reached out and
moved the animal's foreleg back and forth, to expose a small bare
spot just behind the shoulder. "Thar's yore mark You kin see it
when he steps. Yore rifle is heavy enough; thar's many a buffalo
killed with balls lighter'n yours. Yo're shootin' too high."</p>

<p>"I didn't know," protested Andy.</p>

<p>"They's a lot of things you don't know. And then you goes
chasin' him all over the prairie."</p>

<p>"I didn't want him to get away."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you let him lay? If'n you chase a wounded
animal he'll run fer miles. If'n you let him be, he'll lie down and
all you have to do is to wait. Then you gits so busy I'm right on
top of you afore you knows I'm yere. Supposin' I'd a-been an Injin?
And then you finishes off by cuttin' meat across the grain!" Joe
seemed to think this the greatest crime of all. He surveyed Andy
severely; then relented a little. "You did know enough to send up a
smoke," he conceded, "to find you by."</p>

<p>But Andy could not claim even this small credit.</p>

<p>"I didn't think of that," he confessed. "I was just going to
cook me some meat."</p>

<p>"Wall,"&mdash;Joe spat at the guilty fire&mdash;"if'n you'd only
fell down a prairie dog hole and broke yore leg, she'd have been
complete!"</p>

<p>Andy was uncomfortably in the feeling of a small boy. He had to
take thought to keep himself from shifting from one foot to the
other. But as Joe continued placidly to smoke his pipe, and the sun
continued to dip, he at last mustered up courage to ask a
question.</p>

<p>"Oughtn't we to be getting back to find the others?" he
suggested.</p>

<p>Joe grunted.</p>

<p>"They'll be along. No, you needn't bother to hunch up that fire.
<i>They</i> got hoss tracks to follow."</p>

<p>Andy subsided.</p>

<p>A little later the trappers rode up. Each man dismounted and
looked about him. Andy stood shrinkingly tense, awaiting comment on
his performance. He knew that no detail escaped their slow, grave,
expert scrutiny&mdash;the tough, stringy bull; the exposed
position; the lack of water. But nobody said anything. They
dismounted; unsaddled; hobbled the horses for the too brief ranging
that could be permitted them before dark and the restrictions of
the picket rope. Andy experienced a gush of gratitude for this
forebearance.</p>

<p>But, it seemed, all did not take the situation with equal
philosophy. Tilton, the man who in a fit of rage had killed his
mule at the start of the expedition, was in a bad temper over the
affair. His black looks shortly found a voice. He grumbled to
himself as he moved about. Finally he began to express himself
audibly. Addressing nobody in particular he gave his unbiased
opinions. Miles off the route! No water! No meat fit to eat! No
chance to graze the horses! That's what comes of taking a greenhorn
along! Why he didn't even know enough to&mdash;</p>

<p>"You said enough, Red. You leave Andy be!" interposed Joe Crane
steadily. "Mebbe he didn't know enough to this-an'-that. But he
does now. He larns; and that's more than I'll say for some."</p>

<p>"Meanin'?" demanded Tilton.</p>

<p>"You know the size of yore moccasins, and what fits yore feet."</p>

<p>Joe sketched in the air the merest suggestion of the sign language
symbol for mule.</p>

<p>Tilton uttered a strangled bellow of rage, snatched his knife
from its sheath. Joe bared his own blade.</p>

<p>But before they could come together Kelly, who had been lying on
his side at some little distance, with one motion, like released
whalebone, leaped between them.</p>

<p>"None of that!" he commanded sharply; and then, as they
continued to press forward, he placed the palms of his hands
against their chests and hurled them violently apart. It was a
remarkable exhibition of agility and strength; for the belligerents
staggered back like children.</p>

<p>Tilton was now foaming with rage. Given a split second and he
would have turned his attack on Kelly, who was unarmed. But the
latter allowed him no split second.</p>

<p>"Stand still!" He did not raise his voice; but the command
cracked like a rifle. "If you want to fight, there is the open
prairie. But understand this: if you leave this camp for any such
purpose, you needn't come back. I'll have no quarreling. And if
there's any fighting among ourselves while this outfit is together,
I'll be doing some of it." He held them for an appreciable time by
sheer force of dominance.</p>

<p>Joe thrust his knife into his belt and turned away. Tilton's
lowered red head shook back and forth sullenly, but he, too,
reluctantly sheathed his blade. He muttered something about the
mountains&mdash;"ain't through with me yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care what you do when you get to the mountains," Kelly
cut him short. "But as long as we're together I'll have no fighting
among ourselves, We'll save that for the Comanches."</p>

<p>The other men made no comment. They had sat grave and impassive,
aloof. Noone could have guessed their opinions.</p>

<p>Nothing further was said. But the atmosphere was troubled. The
psychic climate, so to speak, had changed.</p>

<p>Andy wrapped himself in his blanket. He was very low in his
mind. In spite of his companions' forbearing tact, so little to be
expected from such rough and direct characters, in spite of Joe's
championship, it had been a miserable day. At any other time this
first bivouac among the buffalo would have thrilled him to the
core. Evidently the beasts had drifted back; or new bands had taken
the places of those his awkwardness had driven away. The night was
resonant. Bulls snorted; coyotes wailed like devils; wolves snarled
and barked; ravens, not yet settled down for the night, screamed
and croaked in a thousand voices. A surge of restless vitality
arose from the darkened earth like an emanation. Calmness, the
peace of night, had withdrawn to the remoteness of the stars, but
it was not missed. The tumult of replacement excited like the beat
of savage drums.</p>

<p>Andy, however, was encased in the complete insulation of his
boyish chagrins. Over and over the events of the day thrust
themselves upon him. He writhed beneath their recollection.</p>

<p>Alongside, Joe was disposing himself deliberately for the night.
When he had settled down to his own satisfaction he turned his head
in Andy's direction.</p>

<p>"Ain't nary wolf born wise," he observed. "Know a lot more'n you
did this morning, don't ye, bub? That's somethin'. Funny thing is,
Ben Tilton don't. Never will. That's about all the differ atween
folks. Some larns; some don't."</p>

<p>Andy choked. He dared not trust his voice. He reached out his
hand and timidly patted Joe's recumbent form.</p>

<p>"Wagh!" said the mountain man roughly. "Go to sleep and git ye a
good rest. And don't never cut no more meat across the grain."</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-6" id="ch1-6"></a>CHAPTER 6. Señorita</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>ANDY BURNETT'S impressions of the journey after leaving the
buffalo country were like the troubled unrealities of one slightly
in delirium. While involved in them they are without beginning or
end; one seems doomed to them indefinitely; and settles to a spirit
almost of eternal acquiescence. Then, as it seems abruptly, he
finds himself out on the other side, into solid life again,
astonished that it is finished.</p>

<p>Thus Andy found it difficult to realize that he actually looked
down into the valley of Santa Fe, for by this time the length of
the journey and its hardships had thrust Santa Fe into the distance
of legend. Yet there it was: and here he was, the same Andy. But he
was not the same Andy. He knew more than when a month or more ago
he had started from St. Louis. Experience, a quick adaptability,
Joe Crane's careful elucidations had given him a fairly respectable
knowledge of plainscraft. But over and beyond the mere skills and
theories, the fibre of the lad had steadied. It would have been
obvious to any thoughtful observer that this boy had become
possessed of a maturity, not only beyond his years, but beyond that
possible to most at any time of life. His eyes looked out gravely
and steadily from a calmly sober confidence. And in this he had, in
a ridiculously short time, entered into a genuine spiritual kinship
with his companions. He was already in a fair way towards becoming
a mountain man himself.</p>

<p>I think this chemical rearrangement of Andy's spiritual
particles took place after they had crossed the ford of the
Arkansas, for there began that portion of the journey referred to
by the Spanish as <i>la jornada del muerto</i>,' shortened to the
<i>jornada</i> in common talk. (This term, later, was also applied
to other "water scrapes.")</p>

<p>Nobody told Andy anything of what was in store, and he was at
first too boyishly heedless and interested in the moment's
excitements to think of enquiring as to what was ahead, but he
could not avoid perception of something grave impending. Buffalo
were killed beyond the present needs, their flesh made into jerky.
The horses were shod with "moccasins" of the green hide. Spare
water carriers were prepared of bladders.</p>

<p>"It's the water scrape," Joe answered briefly.</p>

<p>They passed, at several miles' distance, a singular landmark, a
sandstone column, like a monument, alone on the prairie.</p>

<p>"Pawnee Rock," said Joe. "We're on the Trace."</p>

<p>Shortly they came to the Arkansas. To Andy it was a complete
surprise, for its bed was below the level or the plains, which
appeared unbroken until they had arrived fairly on the rim of the
ledge. It was a noble river for width, with many islands green with
groves of cottonwood, but it proved to be so shallow that it seemed
one might splash across it anywhere. But Joe shook his head at the
suggestion.</p>

<p>"Likely to swallow you down like nothin' atall," said he.
"Quicksands."</p>

<p>For three days they followed the course of the stream. Then the
opposite ledge broke into low sandhills. These, it seemed,
constituted another landmark.

<p>They forded
here, and set out to cross the Cimmaron desert. Flat, simple,
terrible. No landmarks, like a sea. Solemn and frightful. No
animals, no insects, no breeze except sudden whirls of wind that
lifted the light earth into tall columns moving in limitless space.
A merciless sun waxing to the red glare of noon. Cactus. Sparse,
rare curly grass in bunches, the only friendly manifestation of
life. Deep ashy earth into which the horses sank to the fetlocks.
It rose in choking clouds to powder them all with dust that turned
them to a ghastly gray, through the mask of which their eyes peered
red-rimmed. Dancing, shimmering heat that rose in palpable waves.
The animals hung their heads and plodded doggedly a painful step at
a time. The men rode silently, intently. It seemed as though they
husbanded their fortitude, doling it out sparingly against the
future need. The desert sucked them in until they moved completely
lost in its enchantments. The hours and the miles expanded to a new
dimension measured by new standards, while with each minute, each
foot forward, the busy spirit of the desolation wove thicker and
thicker about them the web of illusion. Only a steadfast faith
remained by which they could hope ever to break through its
timeless, span-less infinitudes to another world of reality.</p>

<p>The clear dry heat sucked the moisture from their tissues.
Within the first hour Andy began to thirst as he had never thirsted
before. Left to his own inclination he would have emptied his
canteen, but Joe vigorously denied him, and would permit him only
to wet his lips. That seemed no better than an aggravation. His
throat was dry and sticky, his tongue actually swelled in his
mouth. For a time his mind dwelt on sweet waters&mdash;the dripping
bucket rising from the well on the Pennsylvania farm, the rushing
cool brook where he and Joe had eaten their first lunch together
even the stale, foul pools in the buffalo wallow back there on the
prairie from which he had turned with disgust. Joe seemed to read
his state of mind.</p>

<p>"Don't think on it," he croaked, warningly. "That's the way to
go <i>loco</i>."</p>

<p>Toward noon mirages began to form. A beautiful cool lake seemed
to lie directly across their line of march. Andy was deceived by
it, as well he might have been, for not only did he think to see
its waters and the trees about its border, but its surface seemed
to be ruffied into wavelets by a breeze. He uttered involuntarily a
cry of relief.</p>

<p>"False pond," pronounced Joe: and, sure enough, as they
approached, the appearance dissolved, faded away, leaving only the
eternal and limitless expanse of desert ash. As the afternoon
advanced, more and more of these false ponds took shape. Some of
them would have been very beautiful had it not been for the
mockeries of the nagging thirst. In one of them a group of moving
figures seemed half immersed. With a momentary clutch of the eerie,
Andy recognized themselves.</p>

<p>At last the sun withdrew its strength. They made camp. The day's
toll seemed to the boy terrible. In the short span of a few hours
the horses had gaunted to scarecrow caricatures of the sleek
animals of that very morning. They were doled a few quarts of
water, and began listlessly to crop at the sparse bunches of grass.
The men too drank sparingly. They nibbled at the jerky and spread
their blankets. There was little conversation. The next day was
worse. Andy had thought he had reached the limit of his endurance;
but he found that now he must draw on new reserves. He found them,
but they were pitifully small. He husbanded them, withdrawing
within himself. Somehow he felt that the powers at his command were
equal to only this, the slow dogged plodding on; that if he were to
be called on for even an added ounce of attention he would find
that he was unable to arouse himself. Nevertheless he must do so.
The animals were weakening. They moved slower, and ever more
slowly. They must be prodded on, finally forced on. Two of them
wanted to lie down; from which they were prevented only by frantic
urging, Andy, sitting his horse dully, wondered where his
companions found the necessary energy. Finally one did lie down.
They could not get it up again. Through a haze of mere endurance
Andy saw the men dismount, consult together. Finally the beast's
equipment was stripped from it and piled atop another. They moved
on, leaving the horse outstretched on the plain. Andy was too
benumbed to care.</p>

<p>Joe and Kelly rode ahead. They looked often at the sun,
consulted a pocket compass which Kelly carried, talked together
low-voiced.</p>

<p>After that things became a little hazy in Andy's mind. All he
could remember was not to say anything.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the afternoon he was roused by a momentary
stop. The straggling little procession had drawn into a group, and
the men were all looking toward something. Andy for the first time
became aware of a mound rising above the plain dead ahead. He
gathered that it was a landmark.</p>

<p>They rode on. The mound looked to be small and only a mile or so
distant. Nevertheless they rode the rest of the afternoon before
reaching its base. Then it proved to be considerable of a hill,
perhaps a thousand feet in height. After they had dismounted Kelly
distributed nearly all of the remaining water. Joe was triumphantly
jubilant. His direction had been faultless. "If we'd have missed
her; we'd have been gone beaver!" he cried.</p>

<p>There was no water here; but, it seemed, the spring on the upper
Cimmaron was now but a few hours farther on.</p>

<p>The extra ration seemed to revive Andy completely. He could feel
his dessicated tissues swelling to a normal succulence. His mind
cleared. For the first time he noticed that two more horses were
missing. The others were skeletons, scarecrows. This evening they
built a fire of the greasewood and cooked themselves a meal. Kelly
busied himself making notes. Joe climbed to the top of the mound;
and Andy's enthusiasm was enough revived so that he accompanied
him.</p>

<p>The prospect spread out before him seemed limitless. To the
south the smoothness of the plain was seen at last to be broken
here and there by other smaller mounds and buttes raised to
visibility by the observers' added elevation. To the north,
similarly, stood isolated single buttes. Somehow these individual
and separate things restored a friendliness that had been swept
aside by the flatness and uniformity. And far beyond these, to the
northwest, low, suspended just above the horizon, gleamed a silver
strip above an azure base, like a shimmering hazy cloud. "The Rocky
Mountains," said Joe.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>The trappers went into camp above Santa Fe to "rub up," as they
called it, before entering town. But about as they were getting
under motion again the appearance of a body of horsemen caused them
to stop and to draw together in a compact group. They were too old
in precautions to omit this simple one before the intention of the
strangers should be declared. The soldiers, for such they proved to
be, stopped at fifty yards. Their commander rode forward. All were
well mounted, with creditable horse harness. All sat their horses
with the ease of accustomedness. But their uniforms and
accouterments were nondescript, to say the least. Not one of them
possessed a long rifle. A few bore old-fashioned English
smooth-bore muskets, which looked rusty and out of order; but most
were armed merely with lances and a type of firearm Andy had never
seen before&mdash;<i>escopetas</i>, or firelocks, right out of the
sixteenth century. A few carried only bows and arrows! Nevertheless
Andy thought them, on the whole, a handsome and spirited-looking
lot, except that their demeanor was hangdog and sullen.</p>

<p>The commander was, in contrast, a thoroughly dazzling creature.
His uniform sagged with gold braid; his long spurs were
silver-inlaid; his sword and pistols sparkled with precious metal.
His face also was not unhandsome, and would have been prepossessing
had it not been for the pomposity of a pride that verged on the
ridiculous. He rode beautifully a beautiful horse which he caused
to advance by a series of mincing caracoles. The trappers eyed him
and the performance with stolid contempt.</p>

<p>Kelly advanced his own animal a few steps. The two greeted one
another. The captain spoke at length. Kelly listened without
expression. The men became impatient. "He is desolated to an
unbelievable extent," Kelly answered dryly the calls for
information, "but he is out here to arrest us. We must give up our
arms and follow him."</p>

<p>A short harsh laugh was the response to this. "Ef that is the
only Mexican army he has," drawled Bill Williams, "tell him to send
him back a messenger and start recruitin' another. We mout take
this one away from him."</p>

<p>Kelly and the captain went into extended conference. The
mountaineer produced credentials from Senator Benton which the
Mexican perused, frowning importantly. He made as though to thrust
the paper into the bosom of his tunic: but Kelly laid an arresting
hand on his arm. The captain reared, threw back his head, glared
with indignation, half turned his horse to back away. As the
mountaineer's iron grip did not relax he succeeded merely in coming
close to leaving his saddle. Kelly spoke quietly and firmly. The
paper was returned to him. The captain whirled his horse in its
tracks, plunged his long spurs against its flanks, shouted an order
to his motley command, and the whole band galloped off in a cloud
of dust.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said Kelly, "we'll just have to 'light and
wait."</p>

<p>"Don't we git to go to town?" asked Fitz.</p>

<p>"He's gone to report to the Governor. We'll just have to
wait."</p>

<p>They dismounted and sat on their heels. They grumbled, but it
was evident there was nothing else to do. An hour passed, and
another and another. Some of the more reckless were inclined to
ride into Santa Fe anyway.</p>

<p>"We kin take keer of ourselves," they asserted confidently.</p>

<p>But this was largely talk. After a time, with reluctance, they
unpacked and unsaddled the horses and turned them out to graze. The
herd was held close under a mounted guard.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon appeared, again under a military escort, a
small sad-looking individual, with exquisite and elaborate manners.
He was the first Mexican Andy had seen in civilian costume: and the
boy filled his eyes with the picturesque and dashing details. This
man, who proved to be the Governor's secretary, or prime minister,
or confidential man, greeted all present with punctilious ceremony,
which a few acknowledged with curt nods. He sat on the buffalo robe
spread for him. He and Kelly talked at great length. The mountain
men listened attentively, but without comprehension. Their
knowledge of Spanish was limited to the mixed fragmentary jargon of
plains dialect. Kelly, on the contrary, proved to be possessed of a
fluent command of the language; due, Andy later learned, to the
fact that a trapping partner of some years back had been a native
of Spain. At the end of an hour the Mexican took his leave with
many bows and flourishes.</p>

<p>"We don't go to the <i>calabozo</i>." Kelly reported to his
companions. "They are evidently very suspicious of us; but the
Senator's name gets them. But I'm afraid, boys, you don't get your
spree in town. They've got different plans for us."</p>

<p>It seemed that the following day Kelly was to call on the
Governor to state his business and present his letters. In the
meantime&mdash;and here Kelly hesitated&mdash;the rest of the
company was to proceed, under military escort, to Taos, there to
await the conclusion of the business. After that they were to get
out of Mexican territory by the shortest route. As he expected,
this proposal was met by a storm of protest. Nobody trusted the
"greasers."</p>

<p>"Ef they git you in thar alone they'll clap you in the
<i>calabozo</i> and then whar will you be?" cried Bill Williams.
"Look at what they done to Bob McKnight."</p>

<p>But Kelly was firm.</p>

<p>"That's the chance I take," said he. "It goes with the job."</p>

<p>He argued them down at last. Even twelve mountain men could not
hope to invade and maintain themselves against the whole of New
Mexico.</p>

<p>"We must play their game, boys," said he.</p>

<p>He made them see it at last, though they consented reluctantly
and with much grumbling. It was agreed finally that if he did not
rejoin them within a reasonable time, they should make their way
back from Taos to report to Benton.</p>

<p>"This is government business," he insisted, "and they have some
sense."</p>

<p>"Mighty little." They were unwilling to concede so much. They
had supreme, ridiculous confidence in their own prowess&mdash;"ef'n
we stick together." Kelly had to try to take this out of them. He
succeeded only partially. They parted the following morning in an
uneasy frame of mind.</p>

<p>"If you want to help me, behave yourselves," was Kelly's parting
and earnest admonition. "If you start any trouble it will just get
me in difficulty and won't do me any good."</p>

<p>"Well, they better behave <i>themselves</i>," threatened
Fitz.</p>

<p>Joe Crane had fairly to be commanded.</p>

<p>"I never yit quit a pardner thisaway," he mourned.</p>

<p>"You do as you're told, Joe," Kelly turned on him sharply.</p>

<p>"All right! All right! But I'm tellin' you, I don't like it!" He
spat contemptuously in the general direction of the squad of
ragamuffin soldiers who were to escort them. "They better not git
funny or they'll be one 'military escort' turn up missin'! I ain't
collected me no greaser sculps&mdash;yit," said he darkly,
fingering the tufts of hair on his leggings.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>But they found nothing of which to complain either during the
two days' trip to Taos or after their arrival there. Andy
thoroughly enjoyed the wide sweeps of the green valleys, the
singing turbulent streams, the dark, snow-clad mountains rising to
the skies. They looked very good to him after the savaging he had
gone through east of the ranges. He particularly noticed the
numbers of sheep and goats, and the corresponding absence of game.
At an adobe ranch house they were given goat's milk and a sort of
curdle cheese.</p>

<p>They entered Taos grandly, like a triumphal procession. Two or
three dozen dogs and as many ragged or naked children furnished the
animation. The picturesque element was supplied by the men lounging
along the whitewashed house fronts, their bright-colored light
blankets thrown across their throats, their black eyes gleaming
from beneath their broad hats. Gracefully they leaned against the
adobe walls and slowly smoked corn husk cigarettes, and watched
from behind indolent impassivity these strangers. They looked as if
they had always been there; part of the town's ornamentation. As a
matter of fact they had appeared only a moment before, gathered by
urchins' reports of the approaching cavalcade. The romantic element
was furnished by a stir and rustling felt rather than heard behind
louvers and doors; by the flash of curious eyes; guessed rather
than seen. The only difficulty was that the "street" ended almost
as soon as it began, so that the triumphal-procession effect was
brief and transitory. They came to a halt in the middle of a small
and dusty plaza, the mountain men leaning on the horns of their
saddles and looking curiously about them.</p>

<p>The soldier in command of their escort dismounted and entered
the largest of the white adobe buildings. He returned shortly
accompanied by a grave, fine-looking man with a grizzled square
beard.</p>

<p><i>"Alcalde</i>!" said the soldier, pointing to this individual.
The <i>alcalde</i> was most courteous. It was gathered from his
gestures and such fragments of his speech as they could understand
that the village was theirs to dispose of as they would. Other men,
mostly of middle age or beyond, sauntered forward. The young men
remained fiercely aloof, smoking their cigarettes against the
white-washed walls. There appeared to be much hospitable urging to
dismount. Small boys were imperiously summoned to take the horses.
At the knee of each mountain man stood one or more would-be
hosts.</p>

<p>But the mountain men were not to be stampeded into precipitate
action. All this palaver might be all right; but they preferred to
stick together. They were not going to permit themselves to be
scattered all over the place by an appearance of hospitality.
Somehow Joe made the <i>alcalde</i> and the others understand this.
They raised their shoulders and spread their hands in hurt
deprecation; consulted together in rapid Spanish; finally, smiling
gravely in their beards, led the way to a long low structure across
the plaza. The mountain men followed, still on horseback. The
<i>alcalde</i> made a sweeping hospitable gesture.</p>

<p><i>"Casa de Ustedes</i>," he pronounced slowly and
distinctly.</p>

<p>The mounted men looked at it.</p>

<p><i>"Calabozo</i>?" demanded Joe Crane.</p>

<p>The <i>alcalde</i> showed white teeth.</p>

<p>"No-no-no!" he deprecated. <i>"Cuartel."</i></p>

<p>Joe tossed his reins over his horse's head and dismounted, His
rifle in the crook of his arm, he strode to the doorway and peered
within.</p>

<p>"Looks all right, boys," he decided briefly.</p>

<p>They all dismounted and, ignoring and even thrusting aside all
proffers of help from the mixed crowd that had now slowly gathered,
they proceeded deliberately to unpack and unsaddle, each man
carrying his equipment within. Andy found that the interior of the
building was as severely plain as its outside. It consisted of one
large room, dimly lighted by small narrow windows. Across one
corner was a blackened open chimney with a hood. The floor was of
earth that had evidently been watered, tamped down, and allowed to
dry. There was no furniture of any kind. To Andy it seemed gloomy,
bare, and none too clean. But the mountain men approved. The walls
were two feet or more in thickness: the narrow windows were
shoulder high, just right for rifle ports.</p>

<p>"'Gin we got plenty water we kin hold her against three or four
of them little greaser armies," said Fitz with satisfaction. "Tell
the old boy, Joe, he's got to send us in plenty water&mdash;a bar'l
anyways."</p>

<p>They piled their belongings against the wall. Bill Williams had
stationed himself at the door. Some of the older men, attempting to
enter, found themselves barred by the barrel of a long rifle across
their chests. They exploded in grieved expostulations, but Bill was
inflexible.</p>

<p>"All right <i>amigos</i>," he agreed, "but this yere is our
place now; and all others keep out."</p>

<p>But a fresh problem presented itself. The horses. It was
self-evident that the animals could not be stabled in the
<i>cuartel.</i></p>

<p>"Take 'em along." Joe's gesture rather than his words indicated
the trappers' usual instant acceptance of anything inevitable. "If
we need hosses and ours ain't forthcoming, I reckon we'll know how
to git some."</p>

<p>There were no long consultations as to procedure. These men
seemed to agree automatically. A word or two: a nod of the head.
Two would always remain on guard at the door, "&mdash;and sober,"
reminded someone. The others would go sightseeing as they would,
never singly, but always by twos. The war whoop was the signal of
trouble, when all were at once to make their way to the
fortress.</p>

<p>"And I don't reckon they's enough greasers in this place to stop
ary two of us," observed Joe.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>But all these precautions seemed unnecessary. The people were
friendly. Andy, wandering about in company with Joe to see what he
could see, was everywhere welcorned with smiles and with greetings
which he could not understand. Only the younger men, half muffled
in their <i>serapes,</i> remained sullenly aloof. The reason for
this soon was made evident. Everywhere the two Americans went they
were aware of curious scrutiny, caught half glimpses of bright eyes
peering at them, of girls' figures whisking suddenly away as they
approached. Joe cocked his hat on one side and shouted facetious
remarks in his bastard dialect. His sallies were acknowledged by
subdued giggling. Someone concealed in a doorway shot back at him a
volley of rapid ununderstandable Spanish that brought forth a
shriek of laughter, Joe darted suddenly into the doorway and
dragged forth by the arm an old woman struggling but delighted. He
held her firmly before him.</p>

<p>"Now <i>madre</i>!" he chided her. "What you saying about old
Joe?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward and planted a resounding kiss on her cheek.
The laughter redoubled in volume.</p>

<p>"Thar!" cried Joe to the concealed world at large. "No trouble
to show samples!"</p>

<p>The old woman slapped him, chuckling. Joe leaped into the air,
cracked his heels together, crowed like a cock, smote himself on
the chest.</p>

<p>"Heap <i>mucho amigo</i>!" he cried.</p>

<p>"<i>Estrellita</i>!" shrieked the old woman. "<i>Va dentro 'la
casa</i>!"</p>

<p>Andy turned in the direction of her attention. A girl had
emerged from the doorway into the street. She was a very pretty
girl with regular features, mischievous large eyes. Her blue-black
hair was plastered shining close to her small head. She wore a
short bright-colored skirt and a loose blouse of fine white linen,
without sleeves. These, and shoes of soft leather, seemed to be her
only garments, for her smooth and shapely legs were bare. A red
rose had been thrust over her right ear. Many heavy gold and silver
bracelets clashed softly on her wrists. The old woman berated her
in energetic Spanish.</p>

<p>The girl thrust one hip sideways and rested a hand on it. She
grimaced defiantly at the old woman; smiled swiftly at Andy.</p>

<p>"<i>Oo yanqui</i>!" she called. "'Ow you was?"</p>

<p>Joe uttered a howl of delight, dropped the old wornan's arm, and
leaped in her direction. The girl whisked about with a swirl of her
short skirts to vanish inside the doorway. The old woman, with
surprising agility, darted after, still shrieking volumes at the
top of her lungs. Andy stood alone, somewhat bewildered, in the
soft sunshine of the square.</p>

<p>After a few moments Joe reappeared shaking his head.</p>

<p>The old woman, still talking, pushed behind him as far as the
portal, whence she continued her admonitions.</p>

<p>"Plumb evaporated," Joe told Andy. "Now <i>madre</i>," he
pretended to threaten the old woman with the muzzle of his long
rifle, "you talk too much. <i>Some</i> gal! Now whar did she larn
to talk United States?"</p>

<p>They resumed their stroll, and so passed close to one of the
numerous aloof and muffled figures leaning against the wall. Andy,
looking up by chance, met the man's eyes. So unexpected and violent
was the hatred burning in them that, irrationally, Andy's spirit
flared in response. It was as though the lounger had, unprovoked,
struck him in the face. Deliberately he walked up to face the
Mexican. For a moment they stared at one another. Then Andy,
recovering, turned away.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with that fellow!" he grumbled, still
outraged by the apparently gratuitous hostility.</p>

<p>Joe chuckled.</p>

<p>"Keep yore eyes shinin' when that <i>hombre</i> is about," he
advised. "Looks to me like that's his gal."</p>

<p>"Well, what's he mad at <i>me</i> for?" complained Andy. "Seems
to me you're the fellow ought to look out."</p>

<p>"Wagh!" snorted Joe. "She didn't even <i>see</i> me till I took
after her."</p>

<p>They strolled to the edge of town. That did not take long. The
flat-topped adobe houses were clustered, without order, close to
the rectangle of the central plaza. The plain about flung upward to
snow-capped ranges. The air was vital with the wine of elevation,
for the plain itself was higher than most mountains. Then they
strolled back again. As they drew opposite the scene of their
little adventure, a red rose fell into the dust at Andy's feet.</p>

<p>So magical was its appearance, apparently materializing from
nowhere, that for a moment Andy stared at it, and then looked about
to see whence it could have come. The young Mexican, still leaning
against the wall, took advantage of this slight hesitation. With a
sudden and catlike movement he snatched the blossom fairly from
beneath Andy's tardily clutching fingers.</p>

<p><i>"Perdon, señor,"</i> said the Mexican. His eyes flashed with
triumph and perhaps with a faint mockery; and his even white teeth
showed in a smile that made no attempt to conceal its
amusement.</p>

<p>Andy reddened with anger. But before he could act, the girl,
Estrellita, dashed from the doorway to snatch the rose from the
young Mexican's fingers. She shot at him a volley of Spanish,
emphasizing her remarks by a stamp of her foot in the dust; all the
while both hands occupied in refastening the rose in her hair. She
stamped her foot again; whirled about; was gone through the doorway
again. She had ignored Andy, except that as she turned she scorched
him with a high-nosed contempt. The Mexican shrugged a shoulder and
turned away. Joe laid a restraining hand on Andy's arm.</p>

<p>"Mind what Jim said about makin' trouble," he admonished. Then,
as they walked on, "You got all the speed of a foundered
mud-turtle, ain't you, Andy?" said he in mock admiration.</p>

<p>"Oh, hush up, Joe!" cried Andy, He was thoroughly impatient, He
wanted to see that impudent young Mexican again. He particularly
wanted to see Estrellita again. Just to get even, nothing more!</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>The trappers were gathered again at the <i>cuartel.</i> They
reported a uniform absence of hostility. The military escort had
started off on its return journey. For the inhabitants, as possible
enemies, they professed a profound contempt. Only Bill Williams
interposed a word of caution.</p>

<p>"Just the same, keep yore eyes shining a'ter dark," he advised.
"These yere <i>hombres</i> is handy with a knife."</p>

<p>They feasted hugely on the provision hospitably brought in at
the command of the <i>alcalde.</i> As this included a generous
quantity of wine they were moderately content; though several
grumbled at a place where men lived together and no good liquor to
be had, and no public saloon. As a matter of fact, as they
discovered later, there was an inn, or public house of sorts, just
at the settlement's edge; but as it was marked off only by a bush
hung over the door, and as the trappers were unfamiliar with this
convention, it had escaped them. So they squatted in a row against
the front wall of the <i>cuartel</i> and smoked.</p>

<p>The sun had gone down. The crests of the distant ranges were
edged with gold. Above them the sky had dissolved its hard clay
surface to a depth of light green translucence. To eastward arched
the brief phantom of the shadow of the earth. The atmosphere had
softened, so that through it came distant sounds, mellowed and
clear, that the day had not permitted.</p>

<p>The plaza filled gradually. Older men and women promenaded
slowly around and around the little square. They inclined
courteously to the trappers as they passed, carefully restraining
too flagrant evidence of their curiosity. Their voices were soft
and pleasing.</p>

<p><i>"Buenas noches, señores,"</i> they murmured.</p>

<p>Girls walked together in little groups. They wore the short
gaudy skirt, the loose <i>camisita</i> of linen, much gold and
silver. Their hair, sleek and shiny, hung down their backs in two
braids. Their smooth and shapely legs were bare, but their small
feet were prettily shod in the soft leather <i>zapatos.</i> In
honor of the evening each had assumed a filmy <i>rebosa</i> which
she wore variously and coquettishly across her head, sometimes
across the lower part of her face. Andy's rigid upbringing was at
first a little shocked by the fact that they were, one and all,
smoking <i>cigaritos.</i> He had never before seen women smoking.
Their eyes were large and expressive. Some of them were very
pretty. At first the effect of their make-up somewhat disconcerted
the Pennsylvania lad, for their complexions had been whitened by a
heavy powdering and their lips had been reddened in a contrast
almost too startling. Nevertheless the final effect was subtly
stirring in its very strangeness. They drifted by in close groups,
trying hard to affect unconsciousness of the stares of the tall
mountain men; pretending to ignore the facetious greetings flung at
them. Their eyes roved, snatching hasty glimpses; they giggled,
melting together toward a common center; they lingered ever so
little before they passed.</p>

<p>The young men, also in groups, strolled in the contrary
direction. They too had assumed their finery and made a brave show
with their low-crowned glazed hats, and their short jackets, and
their split pantaloons, and their white linen, and the negligence
of their folded <i>serapes</i> thrown over one shoulder. As they
passed the girls they bowed with formality; sometimes they paused
and a short conversation was exchanged, after which each group
resumed its sauntering stroll. The mountain men watched with
interest a man and a girl who were evidently greeting one another
after some absence. The left arm about the waist of each, cheek to
cheek, they shook hands.</p>

<p>"Now that <i>shines</i>!" approved Joe Crane. "Wonder ef'n I
kain't find me an old friend. Seems like I seen that little one
somewhere before!"</p>

<p>One by one yellow lights in the buildings heralded the dusk.
From somewhere across the way came a rhythm of half-heard music,
intermittent, faint.</p>

<p>The <i>alcalde</i> and two of the older men stood before them,
bowing courteously. "<i>Señores</i>," said he.</p>

<p>He was trying to explain something, gesturing gracefully,
uttering soft-syllabled words. They caught one. <i>"Fandango</i>,"
repeated Joe understandingly. "He wants us to come to a dance. What
say?"</p>

<p>They rose to their feet with alacrity. But for a moment their
natural caution caused them to hesitate. It was suggested that two
be detailed to guard the <i>cuartel,</i> where the rifles would be
left. In case of trouble the rest could fight their way back to
those weapons with their knives and tomahawks and such buffalo
pistols as were in their possession. Like to see any lot of
greasers stop us! But what two? They brushed the idea aside with
impatience. Take the rifles along. Stack them in a corner. Take
turns guarding them. Hell! Who's afraid of a bunch of greasers?
They're friendly enough, looks like.</p>

<p>They followed the <i>alcalde</i> across the plaza and crowded
after him into an adobe building. The room was already well filled.
The women sat demurely along one wall. The men lounged against the
other or clustered about a rough table at one end. Two guitars and
a fiddle were tuning. Home-dipped tallow candles furnished some
light and plenty of heat.</p>

<p>The music began. Men crossed the room, bowed before the ladies
of their choice, led them forth ceremoniously. With dignity and
with considerable slow grace they paced the formal measures of a
<i>contradanza.</i> The mountain men looked on gravely. The music
ceased. The girls were returned to their places. With a low bow the
men resumed their own. Cigarettes were lighted. Ben Tilton and a
man named Markey wandered down to investigate the table. Tilton
uttered a whoop.</p>

<p>"Yere's likker, boys!" he cried. He held aloft an earthenware
cup.</p>

<p>The trappers instantly deserted their corner. They tasted.</p>

<p>"That shines!" they cried jubilantly. "She's got a take hold to
her! <i>Que es</i>?" they demanded of the man nearest, <i>"el
guardiente</i>," they were told.</p>

<p>"Guess so," they agreed. "Anyway, she shines!" Another dance
began, slow and formal. The trappers paid it no attention. They
were busy. Andy saw the girl, Estrellita. In her hair she wore now
a tall comb over which was draped the <i>rebosa,</i> She moved
gracefully, swaying her hips to throw in languid rhythm her short
skirt from side to side. Her head was high, her eyes far away. She
appeared wholly unaware of the tall young man by the stacked
rifles, although the figure of the dance brought her within
touching distance. Her partner Andy recognized as the same of that
afternoon's encounter. <i>He</i> did not ignore Andy. His black
eyes swept the American haughtily. Andy felt his hackles rise. An
unreasoning anger swept him.</p>

<p>But now the decorum of the occasion was interrupted.</p>

<p>Joe Crane was capering in the middle of the floor. The music
broke; stopped.</p>

<p>"That stuff don't shine!" shouted Joe. "Give us something
lively. Come on now! Hit the trail!" He flapped his arms at the
startled musicians in an expressive pantomime. They hesitated, then
broke into a quick tempo.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys. Select yore pardners!" He seized one of the
girls about the waist. "Stand aside, greaser!" he thrust away her
escort of the moment. "You kain't shine in this crowd!"</p>

<p>The figure of the dance broke up in confusion, The mountain men,
following joyfully Joe's example, each grabbed one of the girls.
Laughing they pretended escape. The older people fell back against
the wall. Some of the younger men scowled, offered to object. They
were swept aside.</p>

<p>"Grand right and left! Swing yore pardners!" howled Joe,
whirling his own right off her feet.</p>

<p>For a moment something near consternation seized the assembly.
Then, recovering, they entered into the spirit of the occasion. The
older people hugged the wall, laughing. The girls pretended to
struggle, but ended by yielding. A wild sort of quadrille formed
itself. Joe howled the figures.</p>

<p>"Sasshay yore pardners!...Swing yore pardners!...First four
forward an' back!"</p>

<p>The Mexican girls caught the idea and followed with spirit and
grace. The mountain men stamped their moccasins vigorously, leaped
high in the air, cut pigeon wings and monkey shines. The musicians
scraped and twanged away spiritedly.</p>

<p>"Go git ye a gal, bub," said Bill Williams's voice at Andy's
elbow. "I'll watch the guns. No, git along. Yo're young and
spry."</p>

<p>Andy did not protest overmuch. His moccasins were already
tapping in time; his very soul swayed with the quick rhythm. Over
in a corner, hemmed in by a group of older people, and so
overlooked, the girl Estrellita peered forth with excited eyes. He
darted to her, thrust aside those who surrounded her, seized her by
the arm. She jerked back. He passed his arm around her waist.</p>

<p>With one sweep of his powerful shoulders he swung her in a long
arc to deposit her on the open floor, and drew her to him closely.
She looked up at him in rebellion; but suddenly melted.</p>

<p>"My! You ver' str-rong!" she said.</p>

<p>Andy was panting a little. It was as though something within him
had taken off a lid. For the first time he was by this release
indirectly conscious of how great had been the pressure of the
journey; indeed the pressure of his whole harsh and laborious
youth. Something bubbled up within him like a strong effervescence.
He was wild with its intoxication. And the only possible expression
was this dance. Around and about he whirled and pranced. He did not
know he was shouting. He swung the girl clear of the floor in the
turns; crushed her close to him; flung her away. Acutely, but
somehow impersonally&mdash;for this madness of release was bigger
than that&mdash;he was conscious of the girl's soft pliant body
through the <i>camisita.</i></p>

<p>The music abruptly stopped, probably from exhaustation. Andy
came to himself as though awakening. Estrellita, bright-eyed and
panting, was regarding him with an enigmatic mixture of
astonishment and delight. Andy was dimly conscious of a scattering
of applause and laughter from the half-scandalized,
half-fascinated, but wholly amused bystanders.</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath and turned to encounter eyes ablaze with
hatred. The young Mexican of the afternoon had thrust himself
forward. His hand was on his knife. He was saying something.</p>

<p>"Juan!" cried the girl in sudden alarm.</p>

<p>Andy did not understand the words: he hardly saw the knife. But
his excited state made him feel the crisis. His fist shot out to
crash against the Mexican's jaw.</p>

<p>Instantly the place was in an uproar. The women screamed. The
older people crowded back. The younger Mexicans leaped forward,
knives bared.</p>

<p>But prompt as they were, the trappers were quicker. Acting with
the automatism bred of many dangers, they were instantly together
in a compact group. For the first time Andy heard the war whoop,
"Howgh-owgh! Howgh-owgh!" Facing steadily in an directions they
moved slowly to where Bill Williams, rifle in hand, awaited them.
One by one they backed out through the door. Joe Crane was the
last.</p>

<p>"You-all better stay put for a spell!" he told the assembly at
large. "Wouldn't be no ways healthy for you to stick yore head
out'n that door for a spell."</p>

<p>They did not understand his words; but his menace was
unmistakable.</p>

<p>The little group of trappers crossed the moonlit plaza to the
<i>cuartel.</i> Once inside its walls they began to laugh. Andy,
who had thought to be in disgrace, was astonished to find himselt
somewhat of a hero.</p>

<p>"Offhand or with a rest, bub, you shore make them <i>come</i>!"
cried Joe. "Don't make no trouble, says Jack. Wagh!"</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>However, there was no trouble. Gradually the Americans were
coming to the understanding that these were a genuinely hospitable
and gentle people. In this remote mountain village, distant from
the politics, sensitive pride, and greediness of the <i>gente de
razon</i> at Santa Fe, their natural inclination was to
friendliness. The incident of the evening was dismissed lightly as
an amusing misunderstanding of hot-blooded youth. Indeed the
<i>alcalde</i> brought with him Juan, and some sort of truce was
insisted upon; though as neither party wholly understood the other,
the terms were obscure. The result was satisfactory in that the
trappers as a body were freed from the necessity of feud.</p>

<p>The entente grew rapidly. Gradually the Americans abandoned the
most stringent of their precautions. The rifles were left in peace
at the <i>cuartel,</i> No longer did the men feel incumbent to keep
together in twos. The new arrangement made for satisfaction, for it
is extremely difficult to carry on a successful flirtation in
squads of four, The rigidity of convention, at first so formidable,
appeared to be a shell, for some of the girls at least proved to be
both accessible and compliant. Each man had his sweetheart.
Nevertheless at the <i>cuartel</i> one tall figure always lounged,
lazy, sleepy in appearance, but decided in his menace against any
who tried to enter.</p>

<p>Word came from Kelly. His business was progressing; but slowly.
It might be ten days&mdash;two weeks.</p>

<p>"Make it two months, suits me," said Joe.</p>

<p>"Goin' to miss the fall hunt if we don't git along soon,"
grumbled someone; but the grumble was merely conventional.</p>

<p>Andy was no exception to the general sentiment. The day
following his escapade at the <i>fandango</i> he took his courage
in his two hands and called at Estrellita's house. The old woman
answered his knock. She grinned amiably when she saw who it
was.</p>

<p><i>"Bien venido, señor,"</i> she motioned him to enter.
<i>"Señorita;"</i> said Andy, <i>"yo deseo&mdash;"</i> His new
Spanish failed him. <i>"Señorita,"</i> he repeated.</p>

<p>But the old lady needed no more. To Andy's surprise she seemed
friendly. He had supposed, in view of her attitude the afternoon
before, and in view of last night's performances, that she would be
quite otherwise. But she smiled at Andy and nodded at him brightly
and reassuringly, and made him sit down on a bench in the patio,
and departed without objection, presumably to summon the girl. And
in a minute or so Estrellita stood before him, surprisingly subdued
and demure, her eyes cast down, her hands crossed demurely before
her. She carried a turkey wing as a fan.</p>

<p><i>"Buenas dias, señor,"</i> she greeted him, and sat down stiff
and sedate.</p>

<p>Andy was a trifle thrown out. He had come with a somewhat hazy
idea of making amends. He had expected a rigidly chaperoned
interview to be conducted in the face of disapproval if not of
hostility. His excuses, were received impassively, with only a slow
wave of turkey wing by way of acknowledgment. It is difficult to
talk against a blank wall, especially to one whose comprehension of
your language is doubtful. Andy ran down.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I guess&mdash;that's all," he stammered, and arose
to his feet.</p>

<p>For the first time the girl raised her langorous lids to look up
at the tall American limpid-eyed.</p>

<p>"Yo' go?" she enquired softly. "Yo' no lak Estrellita?"</p>

<p>"Of course I like you!" cried Andy. "But I thought&mdash;I've
been telling you&mdash;about last night&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Yo no comprendo,"</i> said she, shaking her head.</p>

<p>"But I thought&mdash;you talk English."</p>

<p>"Sooch a very little," she pronounced slowly.</p>

<p>Andy felt unexpectedly helpless.</p>

<p>"That's tough," he said to himself, but aloud.</p>

<p>"Tough as 'ell&mdash;eh?" said Estrellita surprisingly. "Yo' lak
talk wid me&mdash;no? What yo' lak say&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to tell you that you've got the world beat for looks
and go," said Andy, bold behind the screen of her ignorance of the
language. She listened with her head on one side, like a
parrot.</p>

<p>"I t'ink I lak," she decided. "Yo' mus' tell me Español."</p>

<p>"I do not speak Spanish," Andy pronounced with great
distinctness.</p>

<p>"You lak I titch yo'?"</p>

<p>"Very much&mdash;yes," said Andy.</p>

<p>She swayed from the bench where she had been sitting to stand
facing him. With one hand she touched her shining small head.</p>

<p><i>"Cabeza!"</i> she pronounced slowly. "Now yo' say."</p>

<p><i>"Cabeza,"</i> repeated Andy dutifully.</p>

<p>She took his great hand in her tiny palm and placed it flat
beneath her heart.</p>

<p><i>"Corazon,"</i> she told him, then, a trifle impatiently, as
he made no immediate response. "You say!"</p>

<p>Andy was too plainly cognizant of the softness of her body and
the curve of her young breast but just above his hand. He slipped
the hand suddenly around her, drew her to him, kissed her
savagely.</p>

<p>"What do you call that?" he panted.</p>

<p>She tore away, struck him across the face, was gone. A door
slammed. And Andy was alone in the patio, faced by solid doors and
barred windows. He tried the doors, peered in at the windows. The
house was as though empty. Finally, reluctantly, he went out
through the great door into the street. He was in a most confused
state of mind. He was at the same time aroused, a little indignant,
and very doubtful. Aroused by the strong sex lure of the girl,
indignant at her repulse after so much of what he took to be
encouragement, doubtful in the belated recollection of the fact
that she belonged to a race of whose customs he was after all
profoundly ignorant. But he was chiefly indignant.</p>

<p>As he moved slowly along the house front outside he was arrested
by a soft hissing whistle. He looked about him, but saw nobody.
Nevertheless Estrellita's voice came to him.</p>

<p>"Yo call heem <i>besito</i>," it said. "Now yo' say."</p>

<p>Andy looked all about him. Finally he saw her, or rather the top
of a head and one eye of her, over the parapet of the flat
roof.</p>

<p>"Nodder time yo' come back. I titch yo' more Español," went on
Estrellita. There was a flash of a white arm. Something curved
through the air to fall with a plop at his feet. It was another red
rose. Andy, without competition, retrieved this one and thrust it
into his hat. Joe at the <i>cuartel</i> eyed it sardonically.</p>

<p>"Speedin' up, eh, old mud-turtle? Wall, keep yore eyes shining.
They's times when ary woman is hard to tell from a catamount or a
yaller Jacket."</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-7" id="ch1-7"></a>CHAPTER 7. Indian Country</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>ESTRELLITA was, of course, just a little devil, a very skillful
little devil. Poor unsophisticated and straightforward Andy was so
easy that his subjection would soon have lost interest had he not
been so tall, so strong, so good-looking, but, above all, a
foreigner, and therefore possessed of the lure of the exotic. The
most rudimentary technique was sufficient, and, as everyone knows,
the basis of rudimentary technique is to keep them guessing. Andy
never quite knew where he stood. He left her kind and melting; he
returned to her haughty with some mysterious displeasure from which
he must win her back. The boy's almost total ignorance of Spanish
was a great help to her, a wonderful screen from behind which to
take these pot shots. Andy was never quite sure what might or not
have caused their frequent misunderstandings, or, indeed, what in
thunder the misunderstandings were! If any! As far as the rest of
the business was concerned, the facilities were quite adequate. To
be sure Estrellita's English was very sketchy, consisting merely of
fragments she had picked up as a child when, with her mother, she
was one of the household of Lande, the adventurer. But her eyes,
and her red lips, and her rounded shoulders, and her fluttering
expressive hands, and her deliciously lissome body were all in
working order. Likewise there happened to be a moon, a large, calm,
desert moon that threw strong shadows on the whitewashed adobe
buildings that floated the world in a magic that drained from it
the substance of solidity, so that the distant mountains hung as
ethereal as clouds, and the low chaparral of the plains stood as
fragile and brittle as frost crystals. Sounds floated like spirits
in the delicacy of its enchantment. The stream had left off
shouting and was murmurous with little voices. Quiet breezes
whispered sweetly to the shivering ecstasy of leaves and grasses.
The distant faint bass notes of guitars throbbed like hearts. One
sitting alone could hardly have remained impervious to the
unfoldment of romance. What of two sitting together?</p>

<p>The course of true love, as Andy now seriously considered it,
ran smooth. Suspiciously so. Andy was too unsophisticated to
realize that fact. He knew nothing of Spanish ideas: he knew
nothing of <i>dueñas,</i> and Estrellita did not "titch" him that
particular word. Though, to be just, there were none of that sort
of dragon resident in the simplicities of Taos. Estrellita did
exactly as she pleased; had always done so, at the cheap price of
an occasional thoroughly enjoyable row with the old woman who
happened to be her great-aunt. As for the rest of the small
community, she did not bother her pretty head about them: she
snapped her dainty fingers at them. They shrugged their shoulders
philosophically. They had long known that Estrellita was a little
devil.</p>

<p>So nobody did anything about it, though of course it was a
scandal. But such scandals were not infrequent in the lazy, warmly
romantic little town. Later travelers of the Santa Fe Trail speak
of them with appreciation or with virtuous horror according to
their religious and moral convictions. Except that the
<i>alcalde,</i> seriously desirous of fulfilling the Governor's
instructions as to these Americans, did invent an errand designed
to remove from the scene the young man, Juan. That seemed the
simplest method to avoid trouble. He did not accomplish this
without difficulty. Juan did not take it lying down.</p>

<p>But an <i>alcalde</i> is an <i>alcalde,</i> and the Mexican
finally departed for the mountains, riding hard.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Kelly arrived from Santa Fe after a little over a week.</p>

<p>He proved to be fully satisfied with the success of his mission.
The new Mexican governor was inclined to favor the American trade.
He would dispatch secret messengers to confer with Senator Benton.
Kelly's own report and the rough route maps he had sketched would
go forward by the same hands. That job was finished. The trappers
could now go north in time for the fall hunt.</p>

<p>"It is only fair to tell you, boys," said Kelly, "that if any of
you want to stay here, the game is open now. They no longer object
to American residents."</p>

<p>They pricked up their ears at this. The country was virgin,
unknown, from their point of view. How about these mountains? Ary
beaver? Ought to be rich pickings...</p>

<p>But Kelly dashed that.</p>

<p>"They're keeping their own fur for themselves," he told them.
"You might get to be a Mexican citizen, if you stay long enough. I
don't know. But you can stay and grow up with the country, if you
want to."</p>

<p>Their interest died disgustedly. Git to be a greaser? Not if
they knew it! Theirs was the sturdy contemptuous Americanism of the
pioneer. The spree was over. Let's git to the hills! They would set
out the following morning.</p>

<p>Kelly had for his part been presented by the Governor with a
short telescope. The trappers were inclined to deride this
instrument but Kelly would not agree.</p>

<p>"It'll come handy to spy for Indians&mdash;or for game, for that
matter," he insisted. "I'm glad to have it."</p>

<p>Andy drew apart. All afternoon he sat against the adobe wall,
somber and silent. Glamour had him; and he was helpless against it.
It was not a matter of decision; for reason was buried by sheer
instinct. At last, shamefaced, embarrassed, he drew his companions
aside.</p>

<p>"I think I'll stay," he told them gruffly.</p>

<p>He had difficulty in making them understand the simple meaning
of the statement. Joe exploded with indignation and incredulous
amazement. Andy, his head down, explained doggedly. His reasoning
sounded lame, even to himself. The trade was opening: he had money:
here was a good opportunity to establish himself, to be on the spot
when the caravans began to come in&mdash;</p>

<p>"You aimin' to be a <i>trader</i>!" cried Joe. "You quittin' the
mountains! You quittin' us!"</p>

<p>Kelly said nothing; but watched keenly.</p>

<p>Andy mumbled on. Desperately he tried to justify himself; to set
himself a little right. He might as well have saved his breath. Joe
was outraged. Finally, as the latter's expostulations had no other
effect than to drive the boy into a sullen obstinacy, he became
furiously angry.</p>

<p>"Hell," he cried. "If any stinkin' Kaw Injin had done me sich a
trick, I'd&mdash;It's that gal!" he cried. "That Estrellita
bitch!"</p>

<p>Andy threw up his head with a jerk.</p>

<p>"Say what you want about me, but keep off her!" he warned.</p>

<p>"I'll say what I want about anybody!" began Joe, "Why that
little&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kelly laid his hand on Joe's arm.</p>

<p>"That'll be all, Joe," he said quietly. "This is Burnett's
affair. I'm sorry, Burnett. I think you are making a mistake. I'll
arrange for you to get your share of Senator Benton's fee."</p>

<p>"I don't want it!" cried Andy.</p>

<p>"You'll take it," returned Kelly coldly. "Come, Joe."</p>

<p>They left him to himself.</p>

<p>The rest of that afternoon and evening Andy moved miserably
apart. No one spoke to him, except in the briefest necessary terms.
He was thoroughly unhappy. It seemed that his piece of mind had
deserted him forever. But he knew that he could not do otherwise.
The thought of Estrellita swept through him like a flame.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>In the gray of dawn the mountain men methodically saddled their
riding horses, packed the other animals, mounted. They were wild
with high spirits. The lazy little town was up and about, to see
them off. The trappers shouted gay farewells, leaned from their
saddles audaciously to snatch their girls clear of the ground. Some
of the latter were weeping. The cavalcade moved.</p>

<p><i>"Adios! Adios</i>!" cried the bystanders, <i>"Vaya con
Dios!"</i></p>

<p>A light morning mist lay over the plain. Into it the little band
slowly melted from view.</p>

<p>After they had quite disappeared, Andy took his rifle and went
on foot toward where the river ran through the awesome gorge it had
cut for itself across the tableland. He had not much thought of
game. He wanted to be alone for a time to ease his sore heart.
Later he would go to the house of Estrellita. Somehow he would make
her understand that they should be married immediately, as soon as
Mexican formalities would permit. Then they must move down to Santa
Fe to establish themselves in anticipation of the trade. Andy had
quite sufficient capital, what with the remainder of his
grandmother's savings and his share of Senator Benton's fee. As he
was but just past his twentieth birthday his imagination, started
on this line, extended it with the easy facility of youth; He saw
himself in the velvet and linen and silver lace of the country,
riding gravely the streets of Santa Fe on a coal black steed as
gorgeously caparisoned as himself. People bowed to him
respectfully, greeting Don Americano, the rich and influential
merchant, who&mdash;Andy was sure of that now; he had been
doubtful&mdash;sported clipped side whiskers halfway down his
cheek.</p>

<p>At the edge of town he brought his horse to a stand before a low
rambling adobe covered with roses. Instantly from other, more
hazily defined buildings somewhere near at hand, a number of
<i>peons</i> came running to hold his stirrup and take his horse. A
more dignified figure bowed before him after he had dismounted;
details somewhat misty, but very important. Brushing by him with a
kindly word, his master entered the house to clasp to his arms
Estrellita. Add brief negligent impression of an interior polished,
simple, but richly dim. Also children indeterminate as to numbers,
age, size, or sex. Keep in mind, as a sort of enveloping
atmosphere, the grave, worshipful very Spanish dignity of Don
Andrew, <i>el Americano,</i> whose benign influence in this
sun-soaked country of dreams was becoming, somehow, rapidly
patriarchal.</p>

<p>By this time the sun was over the mountains, the low-lying mist
had disappeared. Andy's spirits were much lighter. And as it now
occurred to him that Estrellita must have finished her chocolate,
he leaped to his feet and started back toward town. So wholly was
his heart drawn in eagerness that he quite forgot the long Kentucky
rifle, which he left leaning against the boulder on which he had
been sitting. On which act an imaginative person might have
moralized as an apt bit of symbolism. A passing horseman, leaning
from his saddle a few minutes later to appropriate the piece, had
different ideas.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while still a mile from the little settlement,
Andy was passed by another horseman at full gallop whom he
recognized as the young Mexican, Juan. The latter knew him at the
same instant, made as though to rein in his horse, changed his
mind, shouted something, undoubtedly derogatory, dug in his spurs;
and drove on at full career. A momentary gust of anger swept Andy.
He shouted something back to the general effect that Juan was
another, and hastened his steps.</p>

<p>The streets of the town were deserted. The inhabitants were
still within doors, comforting themselves after the chill of the
unwonted early rising; awaiting the warming of the sun.</p>

<p>Andy entered the large gate into the patio. Nobody was about,
but smoke arose from the chimney. For the first time Andy realized
that he had not broken his fast. He would get the old woman to give
him a cup of chocolate. Perhaps Estrellita would herself make him a
<i>tortilla.</i> The thought brought to him an intrancing picture;
her face flushed charmingly by the heat, her lithe figure bent as
she spread carefully the cornmeal paste on the <i>camal,</i> the
sheet of copper over the charcoal fire, her eyes sparkling as she
explained somehow in her delightful mixture of broken English and
slow Spanish that the thinner the <i>tortilla</i> the greater the
cook's skill.</p>

<p>"An' see! The mine are thin like <i>el papel</i>!"</p>

<p>And her low gurgling laughter when Andy tried it, with the
result that his was, "t'ik, lak <i>blanquilla.</i>"</p>

<p>Whereupon he had seized her and in retaliation had&mdash;At the
recollection of what he had done a flame of eagerness leaped within
him. Without ceremony he thrust open the door and entered.</p>

<p>On the threshold he brought up short. The young Mexican, Juan,
held Estrellita close. Her arms were around his neck, her face was
upturned to his, she was murmuring to him swift Spanish. Her eyes
were alight.</p>

<p>She canght sight of the intruder first, and tore herself away
with an exclamation. The Mexican whirled. <i>"Roto cabron</i>!" he
snarled. <i>"Te tengo ahora</i>!" He threw the <i>serape</i> about
his left arm, bared his knife, leaped forward like a cat.</p>

<p>Confused and bewildered, Andy could not for a moment collect his
wits. Almost too late he realized that he must defend himself, His
hand shot back to the handle of his own knife at his hip.</p>

<p>His wrist was seized from behind; and at the same instant the
folds of a blanket fell across his head.</p>

<p>Blinded, smothered, caught at a disadvantage, he nevertheless
struggled desperately. Muffled, he heard dimly Estrellita
screaming; shouts; the crash of objects falling. Other hands were
grasping at him, attempting to pinion him. He put forth all his
strength; managed at last to wrench an arm free. With one last
convulsive effort he cast the knife blindly over his shoulder, as
Joe had taught him. Even through the smothering of the blanket he
heard the thud of its impact, an exclamation of pain. Then his arms
were clamped to his side, his legs jerked from under him. He was
snatched bodily from his feet. Still struggling, he felt himself
carried for some distance, hoisted aloft. A saddle was between his
legs. A rope bound him. Suddenly his head snapped back as the horse
leaped.</p>

<p>And faintly, through the choke of his wrappings, he heard
Estrellita laugh.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>In momentary expectation of a knife in his ribs or a bullet in
his brain Andy rode on. He was securely bound, and could do
nothing. He could not even throw himself from the horse. But
nothing happened. For five minutes they proceeded at full gallop.
Then the pace moderated to a slow shuffling trot. Thus for
hours.</p>

<p>Andy's first confusion steadied. He could think, after a
fashion. Whither was he being taken? <i>For</i> what? Why had he
not been killed out of hand? The direst forebodings filled him. All
the stories of Spanish cruelty, of torture even, thronged to his
mind. His imagination ran riot. But why this long journey? The
horses had fallen to a walk. They were climbing. He heard the sound
of water. They were in the hills. Why? There was no sense to
it.</p>

<p>For a time the suspense was racking. But as the hours wore on,
Andy's more vivid emotions had to exhaust themselves. He fell into
an apathy. It began not to matter. He wished they would get it over
with.</p>

<p>Then an illuminating thought occurred to him. Perhaps he was not
to be killed after all: perhaps they were taking him to Santa Fe.
The <i>calabozo;</i> that was it! He remembered Bob McKnight and
his long ten years of imprisonment. Andy's emotions veered. He
began to curse himself for a fool.</p>

<p>A weary indifference of despair succeeded this mood.</p>

<p>Two things persisted in the dulling of his consciousness: the
memory of the mountain men melting away slowly in the morning
mists, the memory of Estrellita's laugh.</p>

<p>He strained his ears to determine, if he could, the number of
his captors. Undoubtedly they were soldiers. He could hear nothing.
They rode steadily, silently. He might have thought himself alone,
adrift, bound and blinded on a horse turned loose, were it not that
occasionally he discerned the click of other hoofs on the rocks, or
caught an occasional muffled exclamation.</p>

<p>The sun waxed in heat, cooled again. A chill crept into the air.
It must be getting on toward evening.</p>

<p>At last the horse he bestrode was halted. Unseen hands loosened
the ropes from his saddle, lifted him to the ground. After a time
someone approached and fumbled with the blanket from behind. It was
withdrawn from his head. Andy, blinking, looked about him. So
certain by now was he of his solution of the situation that his
first glance was not to his captors, but to his surroundings. He
wished to determine, if he could, how far back toward Santa Fe the
day's journey had taken him.</p>

<p>He found himself in a wild and rugged defile of the hills. Great
masses of rock towered all about. Scattered and stunted conifers
grew from a bare and barren soil. A small stream dashed by. The sky
was pale green with the first of evening.</p>

<p>He turned about. A small fire flickered yellow in the gathering
dusk. Over it squatted Bill Williams carefully attending to meat
roasting on sticks. About lay or squatted the other trappers taking
their ease. The figure before him, the blanket in his hands, was
Joe Crane!</p>

<p>Andy gasped and gulped, trying to adjust his mind. "Thar, yo'
tarnation little idjit," Joe was saying severely. "Yo're out of
that! And what do you think of yoreself now?"</p>

<p>Relief overwhelmed Andy like a wave. He tried to say something;
failed. The only thing he could think of was not to break down and
cry like a schoolboy. After a moment he recovered himself
sufficiently to blurt out "I've been a fool!"</p>

<p>"Wall, that's all right," replied Joe judicially. "You shore
have! But I warn't sartin you'd suspicion it."</p>

<p>"I don't know how I could have <i>been</i> such a fool!" cried
Andy. "How can you ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wagh!" said Joe. "I seen a bull elk once,"&mdash;he pronounced
it 'ellick'&mdash;"that came out all by himself and made war on a
mule wagon. An ellick is a pretty <i>sabe</i> animal when he's
sober, but when he gits tangled up with a cow he's a considerable
of a fool too. No use arguin' with him: jist got to bat him on the
head. Then he's like to come to&mdash;ef'n he ain't daid." He
looked at Andy doubtfully. "Think yo're goin' to behave and stay
put?" he speculated rather than asked. "Or have I got to tie yo' up
again to keep yo' from back-trailin'?" He made his own decision as
to this. "Thar's yore rifle,"&mdash;he indicated the piece. "I
picked her up whar you left her, leanin' 'gin a rock. Now thar's a
purty piece of business! Don't you never do nothin' like that
again. We done brung along yore horses and possibles: yo'll find
them over thar. And yere's yore knife. Three inches more to the
left an' I'd have been a gone beaver."</p>

<p>For the first time Andy noticed that Joe's hunting shirt was
torn and bloody at the shoulder. Joe brushed aside his concern.</p>

<p>"'Taint't nothing," he disclaimed. "Jist a slice off the hump
meat. Purty good flip for a back cast thrun blind. Come and
eat."</p>

<p>Andy joined the others, reluctant and very shame-faced. They
made no comment. Nevertheless he kept in the background, and slunk
about like a whipped dog. His self-conceit was down to zero.</p>

<p>He was glad to spread his blankets. But Joe had one thing more
to say.</p>

<p>"Ef'n yo're still hankerin' a'ter that little Mexican
<i>puta</i>&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"I'm not. I never want to even hear of her again," cried Andy
passionately.</p>

<p>"That's all right. But I was goin' to say these yere Crow and
Blackfeet gals ain't so bad-lookin'. You can git you a squaw up in
that kentry plumb easy."</p>

<p>Andy's spirits were enough resuscitated so that he made a
playful pass in Joe's direction. But the trapper was serious.</p>

<p>"Jist yo' be good to them and they'll make yore moccasins and
keep yore lodge and cook yore vittels and dress yore skins equal to
nobody. They's a heap of comfort in a good squaw. And they're
faithful and lovin' no end. No foofaraw about them! Next time you
get to pawin' the ground and snortin' through yore nose and banging
yore horns agin the trees, you remember what I'm tellin' you!"</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>They crossed the mountains of Sangre de Cristo; moved north
through what is now Colorado, keeping well east of the high ridges.
Thus they passed through much high plateau from which rose detached
mountain ranges separated by wide plains. The latter were broken
here and there by buttes and mounds and low castellated cliffs that
terraced the different levels into which the tremendous sweep of
clear distance resolved itself. Here were only a few buffalo: but
many elk and black-tailed deer, and in some of the higher buttes
Andy saw for the first time the <i>cimmaron,</i> the Big Horn; and
was told the usual tale of how they habitually leaped down cliffs
to land on their horns, and none the worse; and, of course,
believed it, and spent some time trying to chase one over a
precipice. There were, too, occasional herds of wild horses,
mustangs. They were fine animals, free-moving, high-headed. Andy
thought them a beautiful sight, but the trappers seemed not to
appreciate their presence. "Like to toll off our stock," they told
Andy. The air, even in the heat of midday, was athrill with
vitality; The atmosphere was so clear that for long stretches
travel appeared to be on some mysterious kind of treadmill. Andy's
scale of sizes and distances was confused; a hill&mdash;apparently
a half-hour distant, so near he thought to distinguish every clump
of <i>sacatone,</i> turned out to be a mountain, and the clumps of
<i>sacatone,</i> trees. As for moving or living objects, there was
no telling. Might be a group of buffalo five miles away, or a flock
of ravens near at hand. It was a big country, and in it at that
time dwelt a spirit of loneliness that has since vanished from even
the wildest spaces.</p>

<p>It seemed, illogically, that it could harbor no enemy. It was so
big, so clean-washed, as it were, by the crystalline purity of its
atmosphere. But through it the trappers moved with circumspection.
In the morning, before the day's journey was begun, one or
another&mdash;generally Kelly&mdash;galloped in a wide circle
ahead, dashing at full speed past the ravines and buttes and folds
in the earth's surface that might conceal marauders awaiting the
movement of the little caravan. With the same purpose out-riders
jogged ahead and on either flank; a half-mile or a mile afield, but
always within sight. Before the horses were spread out to graze at
close of afternoon, the country for a mile or so in every direction
was thoroughly ransacked. Nothing that moved in all the wide vista
escaped keen and expert scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Injin kentry," Joe told the boy. "No, they ain't what you call
hostile&mdash;'less'n they git a good chanct."</p>

<p>The necessary hunting was done in twos, and always in an
understood direction. Ordinarily those assigned the task rode out
straight ahead of the proposed line of march. Game was abundant. In
its pursuit Andy took a delight so keen that he was permitted to
supply most of the meat. Joe Crane was his companion. From the
trapper he learned rapidly. Naturally keen of eye and observation,
his faculties improved, so that several times he earned the
mountain man's rare praise for his quickness in catching brief
small movements in the crystalline distances.</p>

<p>"That shines!" commended Joe. "Anything that shows big and plain
is safe. It's some leetle flicker of a movement behind a rock that
says danger."</p>

<p>Nevertheless the first danger showed both big and plain. It
appeared suddenly in the shape of a horseman, silhouetted against
the skyline of a low flat tableland a scant half-mile away. The man
seemed to Andy to have sprung from the ground. One instant the
skyline was clear: the next there the Indian was, sitting a
motionless pony, looking intently in their direction.</p>

<p>Andy's heart leaped in his throat. He looked toward Joe. The
mountain man was dismounting leisurely.</p>

<p>"Wall, yere we be," drawled the trapper. "Git ye down, Andy. We
got visitors."</p>

<p>Andy scrambled to earth. He was just a little breathless; and
his mouth was sticky with excitement. Nevertheless his eyes were
bright with eagerness; and he was relieved to discover in himself a
gratifying steadiness. He had not known how it would be.</p>

<p>"Will they attack us?" he asked.</p>

<p>Joe paused in his preparation to examine the lad. Apparently
satisfied, he resumed his inspection of his priming.</p>

<p>"They mout," he admitted. "Nobody knows what an Injun' will do.
More like they'll try to stampede our hosses. What they'd like
would be to rob us and turn us loose afoot. Fur as I know none of
these yere mountain tribes is warrin' agin whites&mdash;except
Blackfeet." He paused to shade his eyes for a look at the
motionless horseman. "Kain't tell yit&mdash;too fur. Looks like a
Snake or a Crow. Mout be a war party. More likely a huntin' party.
We'll know purty soon."</p>

<p>He had been engaged in tying his own and Andy's riding animals
closely nose to nose with the pack horse they had taken with them
to bring in the game. Now, with a turn of the rawhide rope, he
hobbled a foreleg of each to the other.</p>

<p>"Thar," he observed with satisfaction. "Stampede that outfit
ef'n ye kin, ye varmints." He turned to the boy. "Now, Andy, yo'
keep yore mind on what I told you. An Injin likes hosses and he
likes sculps, and he'll take them whar he finds 'em when he kin get
them cheap. But he thinks it's plumb foolish to git killed doin'
it. And he's right. And he knows mighty well that when one of these
yere talks,"&mdash;he patted his rifle&mdash;"it is one dead Injin.
But he knows another thing: that an empty piece ain't wuth a cuss.
So don't you go to shootin', no matter what happens. Don't you go
shootin' yore gun 'less'n yo hear me fire, or I tell yo' to. Then
pick you a good fat chief with lots of feathers and paint to take
with you to the Happy Huntin' Grounds, 'cause that's whar you'll
probably be a-goin', Now you goin' to mind what I say&mdash;for
once?"</p>

<p>"But I don't see how we're to defend ourselves if we
don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jist p'int yore piece," interrupted Joe, "like you meant
business&mdash;when one gits pressin' in too close, or looks like
he's goin' to shoot an arrow or somethin'. You stand that side the
hosses, I'll take this side. Now mind! They'll do their leetle best
to tease you to shoot. Don't you do it!"</p>

<p>Andy took his position. The Indian on the skyline had been
joined by a dozen others. They rode slowly down the slope directly
toward the two men and the three horses. As they drew nearer Joe
commented on what he deduced, with a running explanation for the
benefit of Andy's schooling, which he never forgot.</p>

<p>"Snakes&mdash;or Arapahoes&mdash;kain't tell which: chest
tattooed, anyways." "Huntin' purty; young bucks. Ef'n it was a war
party, they'd be painted fur it, and they'd have their gun and bow
covers wound round their heads&mdash;but watch 'em jist the
same!"</p>

<p>At four hundred yards or so they broke into a gallop.</p>

<p>Andy, peering over the horses' backs, could see them leaning
forward over their ponies' necks. Some brandished aloft guns or
bows or lances. Others carried buffalo robes or other skins which
they streamed in the wind of their going. All were yelling at the
tops of their lungs. The speed and mass of the charge looked
irresistible; as though it must override by sheer weight and
impetus.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer it came. Andy was decidedly fidgety. He was
held to a semblance of self-possession only by the fact that,
across his saddle, he could see the outline of Joe's jaw, moving
rhythmically and calmly on his 'chaw.'</p>

<p>At last, when the onrushing cavalcade was within the hundred
yards, the mountain man leveled his long rifle. So swift and
businesslike was the maneuver that it had its effect, even on Andy.
In spite of his schooling as to Joe's tactics, he momently expected
the sharp crack of the piece. The effect was magical. The oncoming
band split, the ponies whirling to left and right as though
executing a drill. The same magic emptied every saddle as each
warrior threw himself to the far side of his mount. They cascaded
by to either side, ran straight ahead for a short distance, then
swung in on a circle as the riders resumed their seats.</p>

<p>"Lots of fun!" grunted Joe. "Yore turn now. When you p'int yore
gun act like ef'n you mean it, but don't git to pullin'
trigger."</p>

<p>The warning was well timed. Andy found it was one thing to view
the rush from behind the shelter of Joe's rifle and the horses; and
another to meet it alone and exposed. He was trembling; not from
fear, but from over-eagerness to do the right thing. Nevertheless,
strangely enough, there was leisure of mind somehow, amid all the
pressure of hurry and excitement, to notice all sorts of things.
Now that the Indians were on his side, he could see them clearly.
Small details registered&mdash;as that they guided their ponies by
a single line knotted tightly about the lower jaw; that a few
bestrode a sort of saddle, but that the most rode bareback with a
surcingle; that those who were not waving their skin robes wore
them on the lower parts of their bodies held by a belt, leaving the
torso naked; that their hair was long and streaming; that their
faces were painted, if not for war, then for some fantastic
personal purpose; that a few brandished guns, but that the most
carried bows and arrows which they continually drew to the head in
threat and as often eased back without letting fly. And he found
room for a fleeting admiration of the horsemanship that could do
all this and at the same time so perfectly guide the swallow-like
swoop and turn of the charge. Then the rush was upon him, like a
strong wind blowing in his face. It was impossible to hold faith
that he, standing there alone, with one shot at his disposal, could
avail against it. Nevertheless with as stout an assurance as he
could summon, and with a deliberation he did not feel, he raised
the muzzle of his piece. He could not believe that it would work;
but it did. As before, every saddle emptied, and apparently
riderless horses scurried away to right and left.</p>

<p>All but one. This man, astride a fine pinto, held straight on,
his bowstring drawn back to his ear. Nearer and nearer he pounded,
without a sign of fear or hesitation.</p>

<p>Andy met a fierce and flashing eye; stared into a savage black
painted face. It seemed that he must intend hurling his mount like
a missile right against the compact little group. So apparently
direct and undeviating and purposeful was his rush that Andy's mind
was crossed by a panic of indecision.</p>

<p>"Hold yore nerve!" Joe admonished him sharply. Andy set himself
like a rock, the silver of his front sight on the middle of his
opponent's chest. And just as it seemed the next plunge must bring
the collision, the pony's hoofs plowed the light soil in the turn
as, with the same movement, the savage dropped behind the animal's
barrel.</p>

<p>"Sassy young squirt, tryin' to be heap big Injin," grunted Joe.
"Wagh!"</p>

<p>The last exclamation was caused by a further act of bravado on
the part of the young warrior. As the pony scampered away, its
rider had turned it deftly with a touch of his moccasined foot,
swinging it broadside. At the same instant he had discharged his
arrow from beneath its neck. The shaft was launched at random, as a
gesture.</p>

<p>Andy found Joe at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Git that fellow!" he cried roughly. "Let's see you shoot!"</p>

<p>Andy did not pause to question the change of orders.</p>

<p>Nor did he stop to point out to Joe that there was nothing to
shoot at, for of the Indian but one moccasin was visible above the
pony's back, and part of his leg below the pony's barrel. With
admirable promptness he did the next best thing. At the crack of
his rifle the pinto went down head over heels, apparently rolling
clean across its rider. The latter stirred, attempted to rise, fell
back.</p>

<p>"Load! Load! I'll hold 'em off!" cried Joe, thrusting his own
rifle forward toward the Indians, who were returning at full
gallop. "That's makin' 'em come!" He raised his voice in the high
harsh war whoop. "Howgh-owgh! Howgh-owgh!"</p>

<p>The cry was echoed from behind them. Andy, stealing a glance,
saw that the trappers' train had topped the low rise. Several of
the men were galloping in their direction.</p>

<p>The Indians did not attempt to close. They came in only as far
as the fallen warrior whom two lifted between them without
dismounting. Then all made off over the tableland whence they had
come.</p>

<p>"Good boy!" approved Joe. "You done well. Now you know how to
handle Injuns. And that was good shootin', that far and runnin'.
Too bad you couldn't take his sculp." He gazed regretfully after
the disappearing savages.</p>

<p>"I thought you told me I ought never to shoot," said Andy.</p>

<p>"Not while they's comin' in. Sometimes, when they's goin' away,
ef'n they's two of you and one keeps his piece charged. Anyways
that feller got too <i>tarnation</i> sassy. Kain't stand for
<i>everything</i>."</p>

<p>Joe turned. A momentary sudden physical sickness threw a black
film before Andy's eyes. From the broad of the mountain man's back,
just below the shoulder, protruded the feathered shaft of an
arrow.</p>

<p>"Joe!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"'Tain't nothin'," said the trapper indifferently. "Didn't tech
the life."</p>

<p>The trappers rode up and dismounted. Some of them set about
disentangling the three horses. Two went to examine the dead pinto.
Nobody asked any questions. They did not need to. The details were
quite plain to their expert eyes. Kelly and Bill Williams set Joe
on the ground.</p>

<p>"Stand fast," warned Kelly.</p>

<p>He seized the shaft of the arrow and gave it a quick hard
tug.</p>

<p>"Won't come," said Joe coolly. "Reckon you'll have to butcher
her out. Cut off the shaft, boys: don't aim to spile this shirt.
She's a good shirt."</p>

<p>They cut the shaft, and peeled off the shirt. Joe lighted his
pipe and puffed stoically while, with his hunting knife, Bill
Williams operated. He had to cut deep, for the arrow head was well
embedded. Even then it came away only with effort.</p>

<p>"Done hit gristle," he grunted.</p>

<p>Joe smoked. Only the acceleration of the smoke puffs belied his
complete detachment. Fumbling in his "possible" sack Bill produced
a handful of loose fur, which he bound to the wound.</p>

<p>"Beaver fur," he explained to Andy, who hovered about feeling
very sick. "Nothin' like it to stop blood and heal a wound. Got a
piece of buckskin, anybody?" He padded the fur with the buckskin
and bound it in place with thongs. "Thar you be. Put on your shirt,
old timer."</p>

<p>Joe shrugged experimentally.</p>

<p>"Seems like I ain't <i>never</i> goin' to git the use of that
shoulder," he complained. "First off Andy throws knives into it,
and then this yere <i>cabron,</i> And he didn't aim the thing; jist
chucked her in the air fur gineral results. I don't have <i>no</i>
luck!"</p>

<p>Bill Williams looked up at Andy.</p>

<p>"Did he git you too?" he enquired with rough solicitude. "Yo'
lookin' mighty white and peaked."</p>

<p>"No. I&mdash;I just&mdash;" stammered Andy.</p>

<p>"Don't you take on about me," interposed Joe. "Boys, he shore
made' em come! Stood steady as the Rockies till I give the word.
And then he took that pony right in the neck; runnin' a good
twenty rod. Wagh!"</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>A week later without very much ceremony the little band split
up. Each pair or trio had its picked country for the fall hunt. It
was agreed to meet at the beginning of the next summer at Henry's
Fork. If Sublette kept his promise, and the goods he brought in
were not over-priced, they would deal with him. If not, they could
float down to St. Louis on bull boats, for a change. Nobody
expressed any desire for the Blackfoot country.</p>

<p>"You kin hev the whole of it," said one. "Me, I choose to keep
my ha'r."</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter travel for our three turned almost
exaggeratedly slow and cautious. To their left the country flung to
the skies in high and glittering mountains through which shortly
they must find a pass. In the meantime, they held to the wooded
ridges and heights of the foothills and lower mountains. The going
was often steep, rocky, obstructed. The worst was through the
thicket of quaking asp or popples or lodge-pole pines.</p>

<p>The small trees grew close together. Even the horsemen were
often put to it to squirm a way through; the pack horses were
continually getting stuck. Where high winds had wrought, the trunks
lay crisscrossed like jackstraws, and so close together that the
horses had to buck jump as from one pen to another. It took hours
to win through a mile or so of this sort of thing. The ridiculous
part of it was that a few hundred feet below, perhaps, lay the open
river valley, or a plain, or a park across which they could have
ridden with ease, but in full sight. Andy would have been tempted,
especially when exhausted by hours of bitter struggle. Apparently
neither of his companions even considered the possibility.</p>

<p>Below the summit of each ridge they halted. The animals rested
or grazed while either Kelly or Joe Crane went ahead on foot.
Kelly, some time since, had shot a wolf and had taken its skin. He
used it now as a blind, drawing the mask over the top of his head
which he eased slowly above the skyline. On occasion he lay on his
belly for a full half-hour, squinting through the Governor's
telescope, before signaling the others to come on.</p>

<p>They stopped in the middle of the afternoon, built a fire,
grazed the horses. The fire, when possible, was made in the dry bed
of a ravine sheltered on the side toward the lowland by bushes. If
they intended to spend the night there, the camp must be overhung
by low boughs to prevent reflection on trees overhead. But
ordinarily, after both horses and men had fed, they repacked,
traveled as rapidly as possible for an hour or so more, and lay
down without fire. This was sometimes uncomfortable, for after
sundown a fierce chill swept from the snow-clad heights.</p>

<p>Even as to the small cooking fires they permitted themselves,
they took pains to burn only the odorless and comparatively
smokeless wood of the quaking asp, making often considerable
excursions afoot for it, collecting and carrying a supply on one of
the pack animals when the indications were they would run out of
the growth. In his first offer of replenishment Andy learned
something.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" admonished Joe, removing from the fire the billet
Andy had placed thereon. "Not thataway! Thisaway!"</p>

<p>He explained that a white man ordinarily made his fire so that
the logs burned in two at the middle; but that an Indian pointed
his logs toward a center and burned the ends. Why advertise the
presence of white men?</p>

<p>It was all a queer combination of the most thrilling excitement
and an impatience that must be mastered and a vigilance that must
never be permitted to relax, not for one instant, even in the face
of repeated evidence that these vast and awesome wilds harbored no
other human beings but themselves. To his companions this was a
second nature; but close of day found Andy's capacity for attention
worn thin almost to the point of exhaustion. He had to resist a
temptation to leave it all to his competent comrades. But he did
resist; and so found that daily his perceptions gained in keenness,
tended more and more to become automatic. His eyes, sweeping the
prospect, were training themselves to pass over the usual, to stop
only on what was unusual or abnormal to such a landscape.</p>

<p>The point of greatest anxiety was the matter of subsistence. It
was necessary to kill from time to time; and killing meant
shooting. Andy learned to judge country, to estimate the
configuration of the hills, above all the nature of the blanketing
growth&mdash;practical acoustics. It was astonishing how properly
selected surroundings would smother the sharp crack of the rifle,
and how a slightly different circumstance would reecho it in
seemingly unending reverberation. There must be but one shot. If
the marksman was not absolutely certain, he should withhold his
fire until he was. Andy was proud that, as a matter of course, his
companions permitted him this duty in his turn. That was
gratifying. His life seemed full of bitter mortifications and
compensations like this.</p>

<p>For the first time he learned the resources of the wilderness.
The meat supply was eked out by wild fruits. Joe dug camas root
which, when boiled, proved to be not unlike a potato. Another root
was dried atop the packs, pulverized between stones, mixed with
water and sun-baked. Then there were wild onions; and bitter root;
and Indian turnips (Not the botanical Indian turnip; but a root
known as such by the trappers). Andy considered them a pleasing
variation: but Joe did not think much of them.</p>

<p>"They're eatin'," he admitted, "but give me good meat."</p>

<p>They tried for a pass across the shining mountains.</p>

<p>It was bitter, incredible toil. The horses managed to scramble
where Andy would have sworn a goat would have found no foothold.
Sometimes it was necessary to explore for hours afoot, working out
inch by inch the sketch of a possible route for a few hundred
yards. The canyons pinched out, filled with great boulders and
slabs among which rushed white water torrents, finally stood on end
so that they were forced to the hogbacks, hoping for a grade that
might lead to the summit. Mountain sheep stood on bold elevations
and looked down on them; Marmots whistled from the rocks. White
goats stepped astonishingly across the face of sheer precipices.
Andy shot one of them, but it fell from the tiny ledge, whirling
over and over, and he could not get down to where it struck. An
eagle closed its wings and dropped like a plummet after the falling
body. Andy, looking down into the blue abyss, turned giddy. So they
worked this way until sheer cliff interposed, or a precipitous
gorge. Then they must return. The nights were bitter cold and
comfortless.</p>

<p>The third attempt encouraged them. They emerged above timber
line to wide boulder-strewn slopes of grass and flowers. Summer
dropped below their feet like a garment. It was still early spring.
Willows were budding. Snow water trickled busily in tiny rivulets.
The grass was short and new and tender. An icily cold wind sucked
downward like a draught.</p>

<p>"Bet we're hittin' her!" panted Joe.</p>

<p>The horses' flanks were heaving painfully. They could flounder
but a few steps before resting. The slope was gentle but seemed
interminable. To right and left the great peaks lifted jagged to
unbelievable blue, thrusting skyward through the snows.</p>

<p>Andy was afoot, as were the others. He led his horse, and
brought up the rear, behind the pack animals. The elevation caught
his wind, his heart was pounding painfully, his eyes were strangely
blurred. When the horses stopped, he gulped thankfully at the
rarefied air to ease his bursting chest. When they moved he gave
all his forces just to placing one foot in front of the other, each
step a single and separate exertion, his eyes fixed on the ground
immediately before him.</p>

<p>"Yere's the <i>puerto suelo</i>!" Joe's cry startled him. Andy
looked up. It was unbelievable. The slope had ended. The little
group huddled on a narrow level beyond which plunged the blue of
descent. He joined his companions.</p>

<p>He saw spread out far below him a tremendous prospect of rolling
tumbling hills, like a chop in a tideway, culminating in remote
ranges that rose insubstantial to the height of the eye. The
mountains on whose backbone they stood curved grandly to meet them
in blue distance. Viewed from this height, the lower hills, held
like water in this enormous cup, looked mottled in various shades
as the darkness of forests yielded to the olive of brush-land or
the paler green of grass. Immediately below the pass, almost under
their feet as it were, stretched a long lozenge-shaped valley,
apparently flat. The most of its floor seemed to be grassland, but
the meander of a stream was plainly marked by a winding strip of
trees. It was what the men of that day called a "hole."</p>

<p>"Thar's our kentry!" cried Joe with satisfaction. "Ought to be
beaver aplenty in every fold of them hills. And I reckon nary white
man ever set moccasin thar!"</p>

<p>For a thousand feet or so the descent was ridiculously easy. The
westward slope proved to be more abrupt than that to the east. The
horses half slid in the loose shale. The eye could follow a
feasible route apparently all the way down. It was most
encouraging.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden their way was checked by a sheer drop. It was
of not over ten feet; but there seemed to be no way
around&mdash;except perhaps by a back track too long to undertake
to-day. For the first time Joe lost his temper completely,
announcing in no uncertain terms what could happen before he'd
climb back one foot. His tirade was accompanied by vigorous action.
The next half-hour gave Andy a new conception of what could be done
with horses in the mountains. Each animal was blindfolded. A
raw-hide rope was knotted about its middle and turned twice about a
handy juniper as a snub. Then with Andy on the other end of the
rope to pay it out, Joe led the beast to the edge and shoved it
off. Andy had never before heard a horse scream. The animal kicked
wildly, turned like a teetotum, bumped the rocky wall, lost a
little skin&mdash;but landed safely on the lower level where Kelly
waited.</p>

<p>"Do you have to do this sort of thing often?" panted Andy,
straightening his back after the ninth horse had been landed.</p>

<p>"You do all sorts of things often, ef'n yo' travel in the
mountains," said Joe.</p>

<p>But when they came to take stock it was discovered that there
had been one irreparable accident. In some manner the brass
telescope, presented to Kelly by the Spanish governor, had been
crushed against the rocky walls, The eye lense was cracked; the
brass tube smashed. Only the object lense remained intact. Andy
rescued this from the wreck and slipped it into his "possible"
sack.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>The Hole, from the level of the valley, offered a different
impression than when viewed from above. What had seemed to be
merely a tumble of hills now proved to be themselves quite
respectable mountains, so that the place became a long narrow park,
fenced in by apparently unbroken ranges which differed only in that
those to eastward were higher and soared upward even beyond the
snows. They stood aloof and severe like, majestic sentinels: the
others closed ranks in guardianship, like friends.</p>

<p>The plain between them was here a full three miles wide. It was
a grass-grown, flower-decked prairie, broken by small groves of
trees or patches of high brush where tributaries from the flanking
hills came forth to join the river.</p>

<p>They angled to the north, riding boldly in the open.</p>

<p>"Yere's where we camp," Joe explained. "Either they's Injuns, or
there ain't. We got to find out sometime."</p>

<p>The grasses stood knee high. Game trails crisscrossed in all
directions, but dim and overgrown. There was much sign of elk and
buffalo, but all old.</p>

<p>"They've followed the snow," said Joe.</p>

<p>At a point where a tongue of the prairie opened through the
trees to the river's edge they unpacked. The river proved to be
both wide and deep. Its clear waters ran swift. Andy caught the
gleam of trout behind the boulders of a rime, weaving slowly as
they held place against the current.</p>

<p>"Now," Kelly told him, "we will leave you in charge for a while.
Keep your eyes open. We will go look for sign."</p>

<p>The two trappers galloped off at full speed, Joe to the north,
Kelly to the south.</p>

<p>Andy settled himself, his back against the piled-up packs, the
long rifle across his knees. The sun was warm and caressing. The
light air was cool, and tingled in his nostrils. Liquid notes of
meadow larks and robins seemed to float in suspension, and behind
them a steady under-tone of cascades falling and the ceaseless busy
murmur of the stream. Andy, closing his eyes, could almost imagine
himself back in the slumberous summer peace of the old quiet
country. He opened them again to the austere majesty of the
ranges.</p>

<p>Close under the frowning walls, on the distant green steep
slopes of talus, his attention was caught by tiny movements which
he at last made out to be that of animals feeding&mdash;the black
solidity of buffalo, the more scattered lighter brown of elk.
Slow-moving cream-colored spots against the black precipices must
be goats. A single tiny perfect model of a bighorn stood motionless
against the sky. Ravens croaked from the near-by forest. A mother
duck, quacking conversationally under her breath, drifted past him
down the current, her downy babies bobbing atop the water, light as
chips. A long slim, furtive shining animal&mdash;it was an
otter&mdash;slipped from the opposite bank like a shadow into the
water, leaving no ripple where it submerged. Small hawks held
themselves suspended on vibrating wings. Two eagles crossed circles
in leisurely soaring far above them. Black and white magpies
chattered raucously, without decorum.</p>

<p>His spirit lifted in a great anticipation and a great
thankfulness that he was here and not back in the little sun-baked
Mexican town. It had become as remote as a dream. And the girl. He
shuddered as at the chill of a recalled escape. Surely he had kind
gods!</p>

<p>He had no realization of the flight of hours. The shadow of the
hills fell across the valley, began a slow relentless march up the
eastward slopes. First Kelly, then Joe rode in. They were jubilant.
No Indian sign whatever, old or new. Plenty of beaver cuttings.
Bear sign; deer in the bottoms: Joe carried a fat young doe across
his saddle: antelope on the plains to the south; a lake with ducks
and geese. The fulfillment of the dream that made bearable the
harshness of every trapper's life. Virgin hunting ground! Unknown!
Unexplored! All theirs! A new Hole!</p>

<p>"Burnett's Hole: that's her name!" cried Joe. "Shut your trap!"
he countered Andy's modesty. "Not for you; for your granddad. Wish
I had some likker. I'd shore like to git drunk and disorderly."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-8" id="ch1-8"></a>CHAPTER 8. The White
Buffalo</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>IN SPITE of the fact that all Indian sign in the newly
discovered Hole was of last year at latest, the experienced
trappers did not therefore abandon all caution. They made hasty and
temporary camp in the middle of a willow thicket, and then spent
all their time from dawn until dark exploring, not only the valley
itself, but the neighboring mountains; so that, when they had
finished, they knew all the possible entrances and exits.
Incidentally they thus obtained knowledge of the fur prospects.
Into the Hole flowed a number of tributary streams, all of which
supported a teeming beaver population. Kelly and Joe Crane passed
on after a gratified glance; but Andy, to whom these animals were
strange, would have lingered. The beautiful precision of the
tree-felling, the uncanny engineering skill evidenced in the
placing and construction of the dams, the very appearance of the
swimming animals fascinated him. But his companions pushed on. They
rode with a haste almost feverish; using all the horses, turn
about.</p>

<p>"Time 'nuff for beaver when we get set and aimed," said Joe.</p>

<p>But by the end of the fourth day they knew all about the
place.</p>

<p>The Hole was a paradise. Protected by the backbone of high
mountains to the east, its feasible entrances from the west were
but three. Each showed marks of an Indian trace, but unused of late
years. The river foamed out of a gorge to the north. It flowed into
a lake at the southerly end of the valley; a lake cliff-bound on
the two sides.</p>

<p>They rode along the flat shore until their way was barred by the
black precipice. Kelly dismounted; took off his clothes; waded out
into the water. He cast a comical look back at Joe.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew if you were lying, you old Kaw!"</p>

<p>"I kain't nuther swim!" asservated Joe vehemently. Kelly struck
out in the long easy stroke of the practised swimmer. Andy watched
him, skirting the base of the cliffs, until his head was small in
the distance. Finally he rounded a point and was gone. Though by
now the boy had learned to economize on questions, his curiosity
bested him.</p>

<p>"Gone to scout where the lake empties out," Joe replied. "Then
we'll know <i>every</i> way in and out. Mout save our ha'r."</p>

<p>At the end of a half-hour Kelly returned. He was shivering like
a leaf. His body was blue. His hands were shaking so he could
hardly buckle on his equipment. He eyed Joe malevolently. Joe
refused to meet his eye; but he could not sustain the pressure.</p>

<p>"I kain't nuther swim!" he repeated, quite gratuitously, for
Kelly had said nothing.</p>

<p>"Well, some day when you ain't looking I'm going to push you in
where it's deep and find out!" said Kelly vindictively. "That is
plain ice water."</p>

<p>He leaped astride his horse and rode off at full speed, but
returned at the end of five minutes warmer and better-natured.</p>

<p>"It runs out over a waterfall around a bend," he told them.
"Mighty near sucked me in."</p>

<p>This finished the exploration. The Hole had everything. The
broken country that looked down upon it swarmed with hundreds of
bighorn. On the talus or across the hanging meadows grazed herds
and bands of buffalo and elk.</p>

<p>"They'll foller the snow down," said Joe. "Come winter the
bottom will be full of them. Fat meat! Wagh!"</p>

<p>Blacktail deer in every clump of cover. Of an evening they
grazed out in the grass openings, does and fawns; one could see
them in any direction he looked.</p>

<p>"Bucks on the open ridges a-hardenin' their horns," Andy was
told.</p>

<p>The abundance of game filled Andy with a hunter's eagerness to
be up and at them. But his companions had no time for mere sport.
Grizzly tracks were numerous and large. Thrice they saw the great
creatures: once, on a sandbar, within a few yards. But the trappers
sheered off and rode around them.</p>

<p>"B'ar meat is poor eatin'," said Joe. "And b'ar fights git you
nowhar!"</p>

<p>Andy looked back longingly at the monster nose raised, sniffing
after them as a dog sniffs at something that arouses its
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Leave them be, and they'll leave you be," said Joe. There were
even a few small bands of antelope on the open plains at the head
of the valley; and a village of comical prairie dogs with their
attendant small owls.</p>

<p>These were the outstanding creatures; the most remarkable;
possessed of the most interest to a hunter, barring of course the
fur bearers. There were plenty of the latter-otter, mink, marten,
raccoons, wolves and their little cousins the coyotes, lynxes,
foxes, all sorts of lesser creatures&mdash;but, save for the otter
perhaps, Kelly and Crane passed them over. It was twenty years
before their time. Still, they were interesting to Andy; as were
the grouse, the geese and ducks, the loons, magpies, the meadow
larks, robins, the ravens and crows, and the hundreds of unnamed
sweet-voiced littler people awaiting their Audubon. The valley was
abrim with life, calling to Andy's joyous youth. It was hard to
wait upon these maddeningly deliberate preparations.</p>

<p>Kelly and Joe decided to locate the camp in the concealment of
aspens near the shore of the lake. For several days all three
labored, hacking down slim straight logs, building a crude hut.
Until it was finished they slept in the open. At the end of the
day's labor Joe and Kelly lay flat on their robes, smoking. But
Andy liked better the lake shore. There he sat, his back against a
boulder.</p>

<p>The prospect before him was noble and full of voices; the blue
still lake, the towering snow range to the right, the carved and
castellated buttes of stratified red, green, yellow, and purple,
sandstone to the left, the bottomland of grass, the brilliant stars
of single flowers, the spread blue of flax, the spaced groves of
cottonwood and willows, the dark pines of the middle slopes with
here and there on a projection a single fall fir like a
sentinel.</p>

<p>The night drew on. Across the floor of the valley crept long
peaked shadows. Level shafts of sunlight touched the up fling of
the ranges, gold against the forests, red against the snow. With it
came the cold. Bird voices stilled. The chill subdued the voices of
the torrents. Slowly fell the imposition of the night silences.</p>

<p>The golden shafts lifted and were gone. The moon gained
strength. It touched the high peaks, and they turned insubstantial
against the darkening sky.</p>

<p>Andy was young; he was a hardy pioneer; and instinctively he
resented anything that savored of a softening influence. But he
could not abstain. Harden his surface as he might, abundance poured
into his spirit and lifted it into expansion. He could not realize
the irresistible transmutation taking place within him, a
transmutation that, unrecognized for what it was, had already taken
place in these very men he so admired and desired to emulate, so
that thus, and only thus, rough or gentle, they became of one kin
with one another and with the mountains, truly the mountain
men.</p>

<p>Joe Crane's voice at his elbow startled him. "Kind of purty,
ain't she?" Joe was saying. "Sort of gits you. No matter how fur
away you go, somehow yo' got to come back! Makes up for a lot of
hard doin's somehow."</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>The following morning they were up early. This was to be an
exciting day. For the first time Andy was to set out the traps he
had so long carried in the buffalo-skin bag.</p>

<p>The evening before Joe and Kelly had made some curious
preparations. From his "possible" sack Joe had produced a vial made
from the tip of an antelope horn scraped thin until it was
transparent. This proved to be filled with a queer-smelling mixture
which Joe called "castrum."</p>

<p>"Made out of beaver glands," said he. "Use it for bait. Beaver
kain't seem to keep away from it nohow. We'll make a plenty more
first beaver we catch."</p>

<p>In the meantime he divided the supply carefully in three. He and
Kelly cut off their buckskin leg gear at the knee and, with their
awls and deer sinew, pieced it out with cloth.</p>

<p>"Got to wade to ketch beaver," Joe told Andy.</p>

<p>"Kain't go trompin' around on the banks leavin' a scent.
Buckskin's all right when she's dry. But when she's wet yo' got
enough to make britches for two men and a boy. And when she dries
agin yo' ain't got even enough for the boy, and air so tight yo'
kain't make a bow for ord'nary politeness."</p>

<p>The traps were all examined for rust; the springs tested. Andy
turned in aquiver with eagerness for the morning. For a long time
he was too excited to sleep. Then, immediately it seemed to him,
Kelly was kicking the coals together in the early dawn.</p>

<p>The promise was of a gorgeous day. It was bitter cold. In the
first light the meadows were seen to glitter with white frost. The
horses stood about humped up, their hind feet drawn in. Their
shaggy hair stood up with the appearance of fur. Andy's fingers
were blue and stiff. He shivered in the chill breeze.</p>

<p>But as they ate, over the great ranges, the light poured in a
cascade of gold. A woodpecker drummed vigorously. The horses shook
themselves and moved slowly atop a little rise, awaiting the
sun.</p>

<p>Kelly rode off by himself. Joe took Andy with him. Arrived at
the beaver stream of his choice, Joe spent a few moments clipping a
long stake for each trap. Then they left the horses and, their
traps slung over their backs by means of the long chains, the two
set themselves to wade upstream against the current. At various
strategic points "slides," paths into cuttings, underwater
entrances to dens and the like, Joe set the traps. He placed them
near shore, in just a certain depth of water. Over the pan he
planted long switches, the tips of which he dipped in the little
antelope-horn vial of castrum. But the stake to which he attached
the end of the five-foot chain he drove as far out toward the
middle of the stream as it would extend.</p>

<p>"When a beaver is first ketched he strikes for deep water," said
Joe. "Ef'n yo' kin keep him thar, he'll drownd shore. But ef'n he
kin git out on the dry bank he'll git away."</p>

<p>In spite of himself Andy felt a queer pang of pity. He stifled
it promptly, but from time to time it returned.</p>

<p>In a few spots the water was too deep for this expedient. Joe
ran the chain out toward the middle just the same; but attached to
it a float stick to mark its position. For the first time Andy
understood the significance of the figure of speech he had so often
heard&mdash;"my stick floats with yours; there floats my
stick."</p>

<p>"That's all there is to this trappin' business," said Joe.
"Simple as all git out&mdash;once you larn the habits of the
critters."</p>

<p>The fur came fast; faster than ever before in all their
experience, both Kelly and Joe admitted. This was obviously a
virgin field. Even the Indians had not trapped here; at least for a
great many years. The tributaries to the main river were numerous;
and all contained beaver. For a while fully eighty percent of the
traps did business each day.</p>

<p>The first week Andy found the job wholly and engrossingly
fascinating. The second week, although his enthusiasm was still
keen, he began to see that it came partly under the category of
work. For there was no leisure for anything else. It was a
whole-time job. Up at daylight and off to make the rounds of the
traps which must be emptied and reset, generally at a new place.
The catch must be skinned, tied to a hoop stretcher, fleshed with
minute care, placed to dry. The pelts caught some days before must
be examined and given whatever attention they needed. Those fully
dried must be taken from the frames, folded properly, laid or hung
in a safe dry place. When enough of them had been accumulated, they
must be squeezed together, by a most ingenious scissors-press of
logs and rawhide, into a pack. There were, sixty skins to each
pack, which weighed about a hundred pounds. Joe surveyed the first
one with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Fifteen or sixteen <i>plew</i>," he estimated. "We're gittin'
rich fast."</p>

<p>Andy had long since learned that a <i>plew</i> was six dollars,
but that single fact had never satisfied him. His youth made him
reluctant to ask questions that would reveal basic ignorance, as it
were, but now his curiosity got the better of it.</p>

<p>"I don't know," confessed Joe. "Allus been thataway when you
talk of fur. Mout jist as well say dollars, I reckon, but that's
the way it is."</p>

<p>But Kelly was better informed. "In the early days," said he, "a
beaver skin traded for four dollars, but a very fine skin brought
six, and that came to be the standard of value. The trade was
largely French. A fine skin was known as <i>'plus,'</i> which is a
French word meaning 'more'&mdash;that is, more than a common
skin."</p>

<p>As is always the case in established routine, the days flashed
by rapidly. Andy seemed, to himself, to be always rolling himself
in his robe; another day finished. The work was absorbingly
interesting; but it was work, in the sense that it insisted on
itself, and would not release him to the enjoyment of any of the
thousand fascinations the Hole seemed dangling just outside of
possibility. The game animals were moving into the bottoms. As he
waded the beaver streams, the bright trout darted before him. In
spite of Joe's pronouncement that there was nothing in bear fights
for a sensible man, Andy's combative spirit leaped to the challenge
of the great lumbering grizzlies-white bear, Joe called them. They
did very little hunting. A deer lasted them over a week, and could
be shot almost from before the cabin door. The Boone gun seemed to
be out of a job. And there were other minor drawbacks. Discomforts
of the business which Andy had not, in his first enthusiasm,
noticed now forced themselves upon him&mdash;the biting snap of the
early mornings, the icy water of the streams. After wading awhile
his feet turned numb, and he was conscious only of a cold ring
around his legs; but when he emerged he had for a time to endure a
minor torture as circulation reestablished itself. He was more or
less wet all over, and all of the time. In general the weather held
fair, but occasionally violent storms swept down from the peaks.
Left to his inclination Andy would have stayed under shelter in the
fire's comfort; but since his companions went forth as a matter of
course, he had from very shame to follow. And, as anybody who has
experienced one can testify, a mountain storm in the fall of the
year can be a miserable business.</p>

<p>It must not be understood that Andy was sorry for himself, or
that the adventure was becoming in any way distasteful. Quite to
the contrary. But it had ceased being entirely a picnic and had
turned into a job; which was perfectly proper, and as it should
be.</p>

<p>The season advanced with incredible swiftness. The wildflowers
were gone; the grasses had ripened. The elk and buffalo and buck
deer were working down to the bottomlands. The clear bugling of the
former echoed from the cliffs. The aspens had turned a clear pure
yellow in striking contrast to the dark pines. Cottonwood leaves,
shriveled brown, whirled down the gusts of wind. Suddenly the whole
valley was alive with swarms of small busy migratory birds. It was
necessary to build a pole corral in which at night to confine the
horses, for the buffalo had drawn close about. After dark the bulls
came close to the house and the corral, pawed the earth in
challenge. Long flights of crows appeared high in the air over the
mountains to the north, specks in the sky, dipped toward the valley
in ragged whirling flight like wind-blown leaves, only to rise
again and disappear over the mountains to the south. The locusts
left the grasses to seek food on the shrubs, where they clung
torpid.</p>

<p>"Winter's drawin' in," said Joe. "The Cold Maker's comin', as
the Injuns say."</p>

<p>He and Kelly discussed the matter seriously and at length.
Shortly, with the next storm, the high passes to the east would be
filled with snow. If they were to get out of the Hole, it must be
soon. The alternative was to winter in the valley. It was an
important decision.</p>

<p>If they went out, they lost the month or so that remained of
this superlative trapping before the beaver retired to their winter
lodges and were frozen in. They already had caught more than their
horses could carry over the rough country. It would be necessary to
cache part of the take and return for it in the spring. Here were
plenty of game, plenty of firewood, all the essentials of
existence. On the other hand, it would be very lonesome and
monotonous as compared with the rendezvous, where undoubtedly would
be gathered a goodly number of the mountain men, not to speak of a
few score lodges of the friendly Indians of that region.
Furthermore the wisdom of tempting Providence by too long a sojourn
in a hostile country was worth debating. It might be wiser to take
what they had and get out.</p>

<p>"Still," Joe pointed out, "we ain't seen ary Injun sign yit. And
Blackfeet is no great hands to go projectin' around in dead of
winter. Assiniboins, yes; they's plumb fools and likely will start
out anywhar in ary weather. I'd shore like to swap yarns with the
boys; but I reckon we can git along here without chawin' each
other's ears. As long as we got to come back in the spring anyways
to git our fur, we mout as well stay and be right on the ground for
a spring hunt. We ain't trapped the main river at all. Come spring
one of us kin cross the range and git more hosses from the
Crows."</p>

<p>The debate was, after all, a matter of form. No true mountain
men would ever decide against such hunting as this.</p>

<p>The decision made, Joe at once began preparations to trap the
main river. As the volume of water was too great to permit wading,
and as it was absolutely essential that the trapper leave no scent
on the banks, it became necessary to construct what Joe called a
bull boat. Andy found it interesting.</p>

<p>For one thing it gave him a day or so of respite in routine. Joe
wanted a number of buffalo skins; and these Andy was permitted to
kill, a pleasant hunting interlude in itself. The pelts collected,
Joe stuck upright in the ground a circle of light willow poles,
bent the ends over toward a common center, and tied them together
to form a great inverted basket twelve or fourteen feet long. This
he covered with the buffalo skins sewed together. Underneath he
built a slow fire. As the skins warmed he assiduously rubbed a
mixture of buffalo tallow and resin into the seams, which cooled as
hard as the dried hide itself. Then he and Andy, working on
opposite sides, carefully pulled up the willows from the earth,
turned the thing over, cut off the projecting ends, bound on a
rough gunwale of willow.</p>

<p>"Thar she be!" said Joe. "That's a bull boat!"</p>

<p>It floated high and light on the water; carried them both easily
and to spare; but Andy had the greatest difficulty in making the
thing go any way but around and around. Joe laughed at his efforts
until the tears came. The harder he paddled the farther out in the
lake he drifted.</p>

<p>"Ef'n yo' don't git ashore by supper time, I'll git Jack to swim
out and give yo' a tow!" he shouted.</p>

<p>But, when the time came, to use it, even Joe made no attempt to
force it against the current.</p>

<p>"She's a downstream boat," said he. "When she has to go upstream
she's got to use legs."</p>

<p>So they built a travoy for the gentlest pack horse, and took the
bull boat overland to the river's inlet.</p>

<p>As two were required for this sort of thing, Kelly continued
work on the smaller streams while Joe and Andy teamed together.
They worked the river methodically, dropping down the current,
holding their craft by a grasp of the overhanging willows or by a
rude stone anchor while they set their traps. Next morning it was
necessary to travoy the boat back again in order to pick up the
catch; after which the reset was made, another stage downstream. It
took them ten days to traverse the length of the river to the
lake.</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> repeat in the spring!" said Joe, viewing the
piled-up packs with satisfaction.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Winter caught them unawares, in the sense that their personal
preparations had been somewhat neglected in favor of business right
up to the actual retirement of the beaver. It did not much matter,
except that the accomplishment of the necessary provision was made
the more uncomfortable. Hunting in the crisp clean cool of autumn
would have been much pleasanter than in the snow. There were quite
a few of these out-of-door tasks to be accomplished. First of all a
number of buffalo must be killed, which was not so easy for the
reason that most of these animals had drifted over the westerly
passes, presumably toward the lower country. The stragglers were
scattered and remote. But, besides the meat, to be "jerked" against
the possibility of famine, the trappers wanted the hides. From them
were to be made winter moccasins, winter coats. And with them the
whole outside of the log hut was carefully covered over. When the
blizzards began it would be well to have something that would keep
out the wind. For the moment even the two window openings were
blocked, which made the interior as dark as a pocket, except when
the fire was going in the middle of the floor. The smoke from the
latter escaped through a hole in the roof. Andy would have supposed
the place would be chokingly unlivable; but as a matter of fact the
lower stratum of air was clean and sweet. This was due to an
ingenious cowl or shield arrangement of short poles and skins,
which could be turned to suit the wind. It was modeled from, or
suggested by, the peak of the Indian lodge. The upper quarter of
the cabin, under the roof, eddied with smoke drifting toward the
suction of the outlet. Here were hung the bales of skins, the
jerked meat; and, later, the buckskin when it was ready to be
cured.</p>

<p>"We'll have winders when we git to it," promised Joe.</p>

<p>They made a grand raid on the bighorns and the blacktails,
carrying in a dozen carcasses on the pack horses. This was an
exciting but a very laborious task. Exciting because Andy always
loved to hunt and to exercise his skill with the rifle; laborious
because each animal must be skinned immediately, on the spot,
before it had stiffened and frozen. That was nipping work on the
fingers. Kelly and Joe did not seem to mind; but Andy was either
not yet as hardened as his companions, or was still too young to
have gained to the full of the mountain man's indifference. When he
hunted alone he made himself a small warming fire to which to refer
those fingers from time to time, an expedient to which he was too
proud to resort if either of his companions were with him. As a
matter of fact their keen senses caught the smoke smell. They
grinned at one another understandingly, but said nothing. Andy was
doing pretty well. He discovered that sometimes, when the sun was
out, the salvaged lens of the telescope, used as a burning glass,
was much easier on numbed fingers than the flint and steel.</p>

<p>Under the cliff back of the house, where the sun never reached,
they erected a substantial rack. On its pole, beyond the reach of a
wolf's leap, the carcasses were hung in a row. There the meat froze
solid, and should keep fresh all winter, barring a thawing
"chinook."</p>

<p>"Probably'll be plenty of game winterin' in the bottoms," said
Joe; "but they mout move out, and it's jist as well to play safe.
And we need the skins now. For buckskin," he explained. "Winter's
the time to make us new clothes."</p>

<p>With this end in view he fashioned a "graining block" of such
shape as most readily to expedite the removal of the hair and
"grain." The traps were all carefully cleaned and greased and hung
on a pair of elk antlers and pegged to a tree.</p>

<p>If Andy had pictured the winter as a time of enforced and
monotonous leisure, a period of waiting in idleness for long days
to pass, he was soon undeceived. There was plenty to do, and most
of it good hard work. He learned all about tanning hides and making
buckskin.</p>

<p>After the first buffalo skin was dressed and tanned and
softened, the three men set to work with knife, awl, and sinew to
manufacture warm and serviceable, though somewhat clumsy, footwear,
a great comfort after the thin deerskin moccasins. Another pair of
hides made them greatcoats. To the delight of Andy's hidden
romanticism he was soon, like his companions, topped with a
headgear made of a raccoon's skin, the striped tail hanging down
behind. The making of the buckskin was a long and laborious job. He
spent hours, under Joe's critical direction, scraping away on the
hair and the grain, after it had been loosened in ashes and water;
in patiently rubbing into the fibre a mixture of brains and fat;
and in stretching and pulling, pulling and stretching, over and
over again until the fabric was pliable enough to pass Joe's
inspection. The latter process seemed endless. For a time Andy
despaired of producing anything more flexible than a sheet of tin.
But Joe assured him that it could be done; and done at last it was;
and the softened fabric hung in the smoke to mellow. Andy was
relieved to discover that Joe also thought this job quite a
chore.</p>

<p>"Squaw work," said he. "That's the good of havin' you a nice
leetle fat Injun gal in yore lodge. Then you can set back and
smoke."</p>

<p>Snow fell from time to time. It covered the floor of the valley
to the depth of a foot or so, save where the wind bared the exposed
flats. The mountains were white and aloof, and seemed to sleep, for
the voices of falling waters had been stilled. They builded for
themselves fantastic architecture of snow cornices undercut by the
wind. Here and there the steep precipices, disdaining the winter,
thrust stark and black above the soft mantle. A quiet hush hung
motionless like an invisible mist. It held in its substance a
quality that seemed eternal until the shattering roar of an
avalanche, smoking down from the sheer peaks, let loose in the
reverberation of strange echoes. The little streams were frozen
fast. Along the banks of the main river anchor ice crept out from
the shore. Beyond it the current turned, dark and menacing, heavy
as oil. The sun, when it shone, was weak and dim, ringed widely by
the frost crystals in suspension, but shining in the glittering
diamonds of reflection from the snow's surface.</p>

<p>In all the valley there seemed now to be no life, though the
tracked pattern of the snow belied that impression. The animals
were rarely seen. The deer held close in shelter, leaping away, dim
and ghostly, when almost trodden upon. The small creatures moved
furtively and at night. Only busy tiny chickadees and the
fluffed-out and unregenerate Canada Jays upheld a vanished
tradition of cheerfulness in the very face of awe.</p>

<p>The horses grew long shaggy coats, thick as fur. They pawed the
shallow places in the snow for frozen grasses; they nibbled the bud
ends of the browse. But their main sustenance had to be collected
and brought to them in the corral, beneath the crude shelter that
had been constructed for them. Andy was astonished to see how
eagerly they ate cottonwood bark, and how they thrived on that
strange diet. It had to be peeled and cut up into short pieces.
That was another cold chore. Andy learned that only the
round-leaved sweet cottonwood would do: the horses disdainfully
refused the other.</p>

<p>"And look out you thaw it out good," warned Joe. "Ef'n yo' feed
it froze, it cuts their mouths and sturnmicks like knives."</p>

<p>In January it turned really cold. The snow whined under Andy's
moccasins. The men spent most of their time within doors. Joe had
made his promised windows: of doeskin, rendered translucent by
marrow fat, allowed to dry hard, without manipulation. They
admitted some daylight. The fire, fed with slivers of pitch pine,
aided illumination. Smoky little lamps, constructed of the hollows
of buffalo horns, burning melted fat through a cloth wick, added
their quota. There was light enough for the indoor tasks.</p>

<p>Andy became a tailor. Under Joe's instruction he cut out and
sewed from the soft aromatic buckskin a proper hunting shirt, made
with a large cape, with loose sleeves. It reached almost to the
knees; was lapped over in front so widely that a belt enabled the
folds to be used as a pocket. He also built himself leggings with
fringes, like Joe's. When he had them finished and put them on, he
felt himself at last a full-fledged trapper. His garments of
homespun were about worn out. Then he learned to make moccasins;
and did make moccasins. In fact, he became very sick of making
moccasins, for Joe kept him at that job relentlessly. Even with the
hard soles of parfleche, they wore out only too rapidly. In time
all three were splendid in new and comfortable garments. The old,
shiny and black and patched, were, however, carefully preserved. In
this life nothing was discarded; it always had some use.</p>

<p>So the days passed, much more rapidly than Andy could have
believed possible. The dark interior of the little hut became to
him a very homelike place. Suspended by a stout cord well above the
fire hung always a quarter of venison or bighorn. It swung gently
in the rising heat and smoke. Whenever one of the men got to his
feet he started it turning. Thus it roasted slowly, hour after
hour. But when it was pronounced ready, it proved to be the most
delicious meat Andy had ever tasted, all the juices sealed within,
a faint aromatic smoky flavor permeating its every fibre. Meat
cooked in various ways was their only diet, yet they retained their
full zest of appetite and were in good health. This was probably
due to the fact that they supplemented the cooked meat with slices
of raw liver, which they had saved and frozen at the time of the
hunting. "Mountain bread," Joe called it. Andy sampled it first
with considerable misgiving; but found it good. Whether this
inclusion of raw meat was due to happy coincidence or to the deep
dietetic instinct that seems always to have informed the human
race, it is impossible to say. Certainly these men knew nothing of
its virtues as an antiscorbutic.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Spring neared. Freshly loosened rocks clattered down the
mountains in landslides. The voices of the waters were liberated
again.</p>

<p>The men stirred more abroad. The winter tasks were finished; the
new-come chinooks softened the last ragged remnants of the fresh
meat hung on the pole. Andy liked to take Knock-'em-stiff, the old
Boone gun, and wander up and down the river looking to see what he
could see, puzzling out the stories told by the tracks in the snow,
spying for indications of the new season. The sun was slowly
gaining in power. At noon, in the most exposed places, it even
managed to melt a surface on the snow which, frozen by the ensuing
night, showed next day hard and polished as a mirror. The stones
and boulders made elbow room all around themselves. But the weather
was still capricious, likely at any moment, without warning, to
revert to black winter fury from its unstable condition of
grace.</p>

<p>On one of these days Andy made a momentous discovery. Against
the whiteness of one of the lower hill passes to the west he saw
moving a half-dozen black specks. Closer approach disclosed the
fact that they were buffalo, returning to the valley thus early
from their winter ranges. This seemed to Andy important for two
reasons: that the animals' instincts sensed a definite change of
season; but especially that here in sight was a welcome variety
from straight venison.</p>

<p>The animals were few, and therefore likely to be wild.</p>

<p>Andy therefore took pains with his stalk. But when it was about
half completed, the landscape was blotted out by a most curious
phenomenon.</p>

<p>By some freak of breeze or condition the atmosphere suddenly
turned intensely cold: and this cold congealed into a haze of frost
crystals the moisture suspended in the air. All objects more
distant than fifty yards or so were blotted out as though by a fog.
But the substance of this fog glittered gloriously with millions of
diamond points. The sun shone through it dimmed and ringed.</p>

<p>It was beautiful&mdash;but disconcerting to Andy, who had lost
sight of his quarry. Nevertheless he pushed forward blindly, and
was rewarded, after a time, by blundering straight on one of the
animals. He made it out, dim as a ghost through the strange
sparkling haze; but plainly enough to define the sights of
Knock-em-stiff. At the shot it sank to its knees; rolled over on
its side.</p>

<p>When Andy approached he first thought the beast's heavy coat
frosted over by the substance of the fog. Then a closer examination
convinced him that he had shot that rarest of animals, a white
buffalo cow&mdash;Indeed so unusual was this albinism that many men
lived all their lives on the plains, saw literally millions of
buffalo, and stoutly denied to the last that such a thing existed.
Nevertheless here lay an indubitable specimen, It was cream-colored
rather than white, and Andy was interested to see that its eyes
were dark. Andy had understood that albino eyes were always
bleached and pink. For some moments he bent, examining his strange
prize. So he missed another curious phenomenon of nature. By a
second mysterious shift of conditions the chinook reestablished its
power. The haze of frost crystals vanished. It went, not slowly and
in eddies, like a fog, but instantaneously as at the command of
magic. Again all the details of the valley and the mountains, near
and distant, stood forth in the uncompromising definiteness of the
high altitudes.</p>

<p>Andy looked up to see, fifty yards or so away, a small group of
mounted Indians watching him intently.</p>

<p>His heart sank like lead beneath the swiftly darting activities
of his mind seeking an expedient. It found none. Vague
recollections flashed to him of old tales of the heroes of bygone
days&mdash;his grandfather, Daniel Boone&mdash;their apparently
miraculous escapes against odds somehow none of them fitted this
situation. His rifle was empty. He could not even with any
conviction try the customary device of attempting to stand them off
with the withheld shot. And anyway, some deep inner instinct
assured him it would not have worked with this lot. To his credit,
be it said, Andy retained both his coolness and common sense. So
when one summoned him in sign talk to approach, he obeyed. It was
the only thing to do.</p>

<p>He stopped when a dozen feet front the group, dropped the butt
of his rifle to the snow, leaned his elbows on the muzzle, and
stared as boldly as he could.</p>

<p>The riders were eight in number. For some minutes they sat
motionless, staring back. Andy had full leisure to look them over.
In less disconcerting circumstances he might have been able to
admire them as quite the most handsome of the plains people he had
as yet encountered. They were tall men, good-looking, with grave
countenances of a lofty and not unkindly expression. That of the
eldest, he who had signed Andy to come forward, was wrinkled into
an appearance almost of benignity. He was a fine old man with a
clear direct gaze. Andy was surprised, as their glances crossed, to
see that his eyes were not black, but hazel. His long hair was
parted in the middle and hung in two braids bound with red, beads.
The parting had been painted vermilion. It was held in locks by
means of clasps made of bone or shell, and through them had been
thrust a variety of ornaments&mdash;eagle feathers, horizontal;
pieces of carved wood and the like. He wore about him a buffalo
robe belted at the waist. Its hair side was in, and the exposed
surface had been brightly painted with crude figures and designs,
the most prominent of which was a huge conventional sun with
colored pointed rays. Where it fell away at the neck Andy saw a
necklace of the long claws of the grizzly bear. He bestrode a
saddle high behind and before, over which had been flung sideways a
cougar skin lined with red cloth, the long tail hanging down to one
side. From the folds of the robe peeped the muzzle of a long
smooth-bore "fusee."</p>

<p>After several minutes two of the younger men dismounted and,
throwing their robes back from their shoulders, advanced upon Andy,
who faced them as stoutly and as steadily as he could. He did not
know what to expect. Their bodies were clad in buckskin. Bows and
quivers in otter-skin cases peeped over their shoulders, But in the
right hand of each was clasped the "war hawk," or war club, which
with the mountain Indian of that day replaced the traditional
tomahawk of the warriors farther east. They took position either
side the boy.</p>

<p>He was helpless. Even his knife was inaccessibly beneath the
cover of his buffalo coat.</p>

<p>But at a sign the warriors thrust their weapons into their
belts. One produced a rawhide cord with which Andy's arms were
bound at the elbows behind his back. They lifted him bodily and
cast him across a horse's back.</p>

<p>At this moment one of the band raised a cry. There was a sudden
excited movement. The horse stirred restively, dumping Andy to the
snow. He twisted about to find that the whole band had deserted him
and were gathered about the dead buffalo.</p>

<p>For a brief excited moment a clamor of cries and ejaculations.
Then one of the younger men ran over to him, snatching a knife from
his belt. Andy closed his eyes, bracing himself for the fatal
thrust. But his bands were cut: he was assisted to his feet, led
gently forward.</p>

<p>All had dismounted. Two youths had darted away to the creek
bottom on foot. The others had cast off their robes, were fumbling
with the bundles slung to their saddle bows. Andy, by now
thoroughly bewildered, watched them hastily stripping themselves in
the bitter cold; throwing aside their discarded garments, tearing
open the bundles, from which came gorgeously embroidered shirts and
leggings, carefully folded crowns of erect eagle feathers. He saw,
in less time than it takes to tell it, the warriors, in contrast to
their previous muffling against the cold, stand forth fully arrayed
in barbaric gorgeousness. The two young men returned uphill from
the creek, carrying handfuls of dried grass. The chief took it from
them, knelt in the snow, set fire to it with his flint and steel.
Andy caught in his nostrils the penetrating aromatic pungency of
sweet grass.</p>

<p>In the smoke from the tiny fire the chief washed his hands as
though in water, then arose to his full height. He raised his knife
toward the sun. The warriors ranged themselves behind him. In all
that spacious valley was no movement. A vast solemnity seemed to
have been evoked by the old man's simple gesture, so that the
mountains themselves paused in the invisible flow of their slow,
eternal thoughts. Only the horses stamped softly and blew the smoke
of cold from their nostrils. Andy could not understand; but he was
impressed.</p>

<p>The chief stepped forward, stooped; cut out the beast's tongue,
stepped back. The others, with an evident reverence, one by one
passed their hands, then their knives, through the waning smoke of
the dying sweet-grass fire. Then with the greatest care they
skinned the buffalo. Until this slow task was quite completed the
old man stood rigid, holding the severed tongue at arm's length
toward the sun. The detached robe was at length rolled into a
bundle.</p>

<p><i>"O sun!"</i> then intoned the chief in the Blackfoot
language, <i>"I give her to you. Take her. She is yours."</i></p>

<p>Two of the young men bound the robe carefully to a riding
saddle.</p>

<p>It was all bewildering to Andy. But what followed was still more
so. For the chief himself, bearing it reverently, restored to him
his rifle. He was signed to bestride the cougar-skin saddle. Then,
he alone monnted, all the Indians afoot leading their horses and
chanting low-voiced, the band resumed its way down the floor of the
valley, leaving the meat untouched, except for the tongue which the
chief carried before him impaled on the point of a spear.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Andy did not know what it was all about, though he could guess
part of it. The situation, however, did not seem entirely hopeless.
The savages numbered only eight. The odds against the two trappers
were not excessive, provided they were not caught by surprise.
Andy's rifle was empty, but his voice was in working order. He made
up his mind to shout the alarm when the time came. His mind was
instantly busy on the details of a plan&mdash;how he would try to
edge his mount aside, throw himself&mdash;The line of thought was
checked abruptly. Across the snow converged the tracks of a second,
larger band of Indians.</p>

<p>And when they rounded the aspen grove to within sight of camp,
he found the whole place in possession of the Blackfeet. Their
horses stood in a compact bunch against the cliff, guarded by two
of the younger men.</p>

<p>The other Indians, to the number of scores, it seemed to Andy,
were everywhere. Some were driving in the trappers' horses. Some
were examining the traps hung on the elk antlers, or the meat rack,
or the bull boat, or any of the other of the simple arrangements.
But by far the majority were either going into or coming out of the
hut. Bales of beaver skins were strewn about outside. These were
the center of a vociferous group.</p>

<p>Andy, even from the height of his horse, could see nothing of
the white men.</p>

<p>The old chief shook the spear aloft and said something in a loud
voice. The heads of those nearest turned toward him inquiringly.
The rhythmical chant, which Andy's captors had never ceased to
croon, now rose to full voice. The nearest of the bystanders took
it up. This caught the attention of those farther away. They drew
near; joined in. In the center of the milling, jostling mob those
who had led the chief's horse were unpacking the skin of the
buffalo. Andy was left quite alone and unguarded, on the
outskirts.</p>

<p>For the first time he was able to see his companions, hitherto
concealed behind the crowds about the door. They were seated side
by side, their backs against the building. Joe was smoking. Andy
dismounted and made his way to them. Nobody offered to stop him.
Joe's leathery countenance showed no change of expression: but for
an instant his eyes shone. However, that was the only indication of
relief he exhibited at the sight of Andy, still alive.</p>

<p>"Well!" he drawled. "What you doin' walkin' around with a weapon
in yore hands? Don't you know it ain't polite when you got
visitors? Look at Jack and me." An expression of angry disgust
flitted across his face. "Caught flat-footed!" he cried. "Old
<i>hivernants</i> like us! We <i>ought</i> to lose our ha'r."</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"Nothin'," Joe had resumed his sardonic drawl. "One minute there
was me and Jack. Next minute thar was all of us. By God we got jist
what was comin' to us! But I'm sorry about you, boy."</p>

<p>"What will they do with us, do you think?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"Several things," Joe surmised. "The festivities will begin
later."</p>

<p>He was not looking at Andy, but toward the group of Indians who
were crowding closer together more and more absorbed in what was
happening.</p>

<p>"When I say 'go,' jist slip around the corner of the house,"
said he, "and take for the river. Ef'n we kin get across before
they see us, we mout have a slim chance. We got one rifle,
anyways."</p>

<p>"She's not loaded, and they took away my powder and shot pouch,"
said Andy.</p>

<p>"Settles that," observed Joe. He relighted his pipe. "How come
they git you?" he asked finally. "Have a fight?"</p>

<p>"I'd shot a buffalo in the fog. It lifted suddenly, and there
they were. My rifle was empty."</p>

<p>"Never knew Blackfeet to travel winters," stated Joe, as though
in extenuation. "But that's no excuse," he added.</p>

<p>The compact group of Indians divided. The chief, followed by a
half-dozen of obviously the most important members of the band,
approached. He stopped before the seated whites and began an
oration in "hand talk," the sign language. (To quiet the reader's
doubts, it should be stated that the sign talk is no crude
convention, adapted only to the rough conveyance of simple facts.
It is a highly developed and exceedingly flexible language, capable
of expressing not only facts, but the most abstract ideas and
concepts; and with a speed and fluency fully equal to any spoken
dialect, a true <i>lingua franca.</i> Furthermore, it is an easy
language to acquire, understand, and remember, for the reason that
the gestures of which it is made up are highly illustrative.) The
three watched him attentively, for Andy had by now, under Joe's
tutelage, acquired a very workable facility.</p>

<p>They learned that the white buffalo is a sacred animal. That it
belongs to the all-powerful Sun. That he who kills such an animal
partakes in some degree of its sacred character. That the whole
tribe to which such a man belonged shared in that favor. He stated
these things briefly, with no mark of friendliness. Then abruptly
he turned away.</p>

<p>Through the thin clear air, from up the valley, now could be
heard the mingled clamor of a multitude approaching. Shortly,
around the end of the aspen grove, streamed a confused horde of
ponies, dogs, women, children, old men&mdash;straggling, noisy,
without order. The vanguard stopped, milled about; the rear guard
gradually closed in. There was much shouting back and forth.</p>

<p>A sudden stilling to immobility and again the chant arose,
full-voiced, triumphant, arms extended upwards towards the setting
sun.</p>

<p>As it died the mob, with renewed clamor, broke in all
directions. The women led away the laden horses. Shortly, in the
bottomland below the cabin, the lodges began to stagger erect.
Boys, shouting shrilly, drove the horses to the low tableland
above.</p>

<p>The men waited apart. When, in an incredibly brief space of
time, the new blue smoke began to arise from the lodge cowls, they
strode away to their several habitations. But on their way they
paused at the camp to shoulder the bales of beaver skins. They took
the traps from the elk antlers on the trees. They carried off the
little bundles of moccasins, product of the winter's labor. They
unhooked from the pegs in the rafters the remaining store of jerked
meat. Already the horses, and Buggs, Joe's mule, had been driven
off to the main herd. Not once did they vouchsafe the three men,
still seated by the door, a single glance. At last they were gone.
The whites were left alone, free, unguarded, but stripped clean.
The clothes they wore on their backs, and the empty Boone rifle,
without powder or ball, were now their sole earthly
possessions.</p>

<p>They went inside and built up the fire, It was getting cold.
There was nothing else to do.</p>

<p>Kelly was grave and silent. He seemed to have retired to an
inner citadel of watchfulness that awaited the event. He shook his
head to Andy's questions.</p>

<p>"Don't know," he said briefly. "Seems we're safe for the
present. That's all I can tell."</p>

<p>But Joe's unquenchable spirits had revived. He was inclined to
view facetiously even his first chagrin at being caught so
completely unaware.</p>

<p>"Shore we're all right. Ain't we still got our ha'r? And whar
thar's ha'r thar's hope, as the book says. Andy yere's made himself
a genuine god. And yo' saw what the old boy said: it's ketchin' to
the whole tribe. Ain't we his tribe?"</p>

<p>But Andy did not feel very cheerful. In the old chief's brief
statement he had discovered no trace of friendliness.</p>

<p>"No," agreed Kelly, "they're not friendly. If it had not been
for your extraordinary good fortune in running on that buffalo,
we'd have all been dead by now. They consider they own this
country."</p>

<p>Night fell. Noone came near them. They had nothing to eat. Joe
grumbled humorously at this.</p>

<p>"I suppose they got an idee gods don't git hungry," said he.
"Well, this one does!"</p>

<p>Lacking their robes, which also the Blackfeet had taken, they
passed rather a miserable night around the fire. Morning found even
Joe subdued and thoughtful. Andy's imagination prowled gloomily
among the facts and possibilities of the situation. They might be
left here to starve, helpless. They might be turned adrift unarmed
to the iron mercilessness of the winter mountains. Joe added a
happy thought.</p>

<p>"Mebbe this god-stuff wears off after a while," he suggested.
"Somehow my ha'r don't seem so firm this morning." He laid his hand
on Andy's shoulder. "I'm sorry, boy," said he. "Us old tough
ones&mdash;it's no more than we deserve, I reckon. But
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm trailing," said Andy stoutly.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-9" id="ch1-9"></a>CHAPTER. 9 Blackfeet</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>IN SPITE of the sacred character with which Andy Burnett had
been invested by his lucky killing of a white buffalo, his
situation, and that of the two trappers, was indeed uncertain. How
long this protection would last was uncertain. Whether it would
extend to his companions was uncertain. But several things were
only too sure: they had been robbed of the most wonderful beaver
catch ever trapped in the mountains; they had lost their traps,
their weapons; they were very hungry, and there were no prospects
of food in sight. The morning wore away. The straggling Indian
encampment in the bottom showed plenty of life and activity; but
none of it directed toward the cabin. It began to seem that there
might well be merit in Andy's suggestion that they were to be left
most ceremonially to starve.</p>

<p>But, a few moments before the sun reached the meridian a small
delegation detached itself from the teepees and took its way up the
slope in their direction.</p>

<p>The old chief walked a few paces in advance. He was dressed in
complete buckskin, elaborately and beautifully embroidered with
beads and dyed porcupine quills. Over his shoulders hung a cape
made of the forelock and mane of a buffalo bull. He carried a short
staff from which hung buffalo hoofs which he rattled together
softly as he walked. Immediately at his heels strode a warrior
bearing the long feathered calumet, He carried also a staff covered
over with red cloth to which raven feathers had been attached in a
row; evidently a badge of office. Four or five others followed
close behind, They were distinguished by their headdresses of
eagle's feathers from which protruded the curve of a pair of
buffalo horns, and also by their peculiar staffs, which were long
and hooked and covered with otter skin into which, at spaced
intervals, had been fastened eagle's feathers. Otherwise they were
empty-handed.</p>

<p>"Thought they might be bringin' us breakfast," Joe pretended,
"<i>and</i> last night's supper!"</p>

<p>As the group neared, the chief took the long pipe from its
bearer, and pointed the stem forward at arm's length.</p>

<p>"Peace talk," said Joe. "Wall, that's <i>somethin'!"</i></p>

<p>But when the three whites arose and moved forward, Kelly and Joe
were ordered back.</p>

<p>"Think before you answer," Kelly advised Andy hurriedly.</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," replied Andy. He took his indicated place, to
the right of the chief, on the spread robe, very much troubled in
mind, for he realized keenly his total lack of experience in this
sort of thing, and the vital importance of steering the right
course.</p>

<p>The bearer of the pipe filled it, lighted it, handed it again to
the chief. The latter puffed at it in silence. No one moved or
spoke. A gush of petition welled up in Andy's heart, a silent
reaching out to claim a shadowy heritage; and as though in response
his spirit steadied. For a brief mystic moment it seemed to him
that somehow he was no longer alone.</p>

<p>The chief extended the mouthpiece of the calumet toward the
zenith.</p>

<p><i>"O Sun, reveal to us your purpose!</i>" he petitioned in
Blackfoot language.</p>

<p>He offered Andy the pipe.</p>

<p>It was a warm day, the first establishment of the spring
chinook. The surface of the snow had softened. As Andy accepted the
pipe a heavy drop of water fell from the cottonwood branch overhead
directly into the bowl. The tobacco was extinguished.</p>

<p>So evidently calamitous was this portent that even the white men
could not miss its significance. Both Kelly and Joe uttered
exclamations of dismay. A stir of awe and consternation swept the
council circle like a wind. The chief's face darkened.</p>

<p>Only Andy himself, of all those present, remained undisturbed.
His mind was working with a calmness and a clarity and a certainty
that later he looked back upon with wonder and a little awe.
Without conscious decision he seemed to know exactly what to do.
Deliberately, without excitement or haste, he took the telescope
lens from the pouch at his waist, extending his right arm above the
bowl of the pipe focusing the sun rays. The dampened tobacco
smouldered for a moment, glowed red. Andy puffed strongly the
ceremonial thrice; and passed the calumet to the warrior at his
right.</p>

<p>The gravity of the occasion was not proof against this miracle.
None of the Indians had ever seen a burning glass. It is doubtful
if many even noticed that the boy held any object in his hand; and
those probably considered it some sort of "medicine" or charm. To
them it seemed that Andy had called upon the sun, the Sun, greatest
and most powerful of the gods, directly to light the pipe. A murmur
of surprise and of awe swept the circle. They clapped their hands
flat over their mouths. Only Kelly's quick wits leaped to instant
appreciation.</p>

<p>"Put that thing away!" he called sharply to Andy, "Don't let
them lay eyes on it again!"</p>

<p>Andy slipped the lens into his pouch.</p>

<p>Ceremonial formality was broken for a moment. The warriors
snatched at the calumet, puffing eagerly, avid that the virtue of
this miracle might touch themselves. The pipe made the rounds in
record time.</p>

<p>But now with a sharp word of command the old chief brought them
to order. He turned to Andy once more. He began to question him in
sign talk; but now with respect.</p>

<p>"You have great Sun-power," he said. "The Sun is your father. He
holds you in his hand."</p>

<p>He pondered for a few moments; then roused himself.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We trap beaver," Andy replied.</p>

<p>"This is our place. We own the beaver."</p>

<p>"We looked. We saw no sign of men. This place had no men."</p>

<p>"It is our place. White men are our enemies."</p>

<p>"You are enemies of white men," countered Andy. "Why?"</p>

<p>The chief's face darkened again.</p>

<p>"The white men have helped our enemies," he signed swiftly. "The
Crows ride with many guns. The Assiniboins ride with many guns. The
Flatheads ride with many guns. We have few guns. Why do the white
men give arms to our enemies?"</p>

<p>An interruption turned all heads toward the cabin.</p>

<p>Kelly had suddenly begun to chant a queer wandering minor
cadence, not unlike the melody of the Indian music. And the message
of his chant was directed to Andy, and was this.</p>

<p>"Tell him it is because the Assiniboins and Crows are near at
hand and the Blackfeet far away. Tell him the Flatheads get their
guns not from us but from the Hudson Bay men, and they are our
enemies too. Tell him that the Blackfeet can have guns also if they
will bring in beaver skins."</p>

<p>After which he continued, while Andy repeated this, to sing on
in a string of nonsense.</p>

<p>"It is the medicine song of the white man," Andy replied to the
chief's sharp and somewhat indignant demand.</p>

<p>He turned squarely to face the old man.</p>

<p>"We are not your enemies," he signed slowly. "The Sun is our
friend. I called upon the Sun and he came from the sky to tell you
we are his children. Do not make the Sun angry."</p>

<p>He extended again his right arm toward the luminary, his cupped
hand concealing the old telescope lens in its hollow, focusing the
burning point of light on the back of the chief's hand.</p>

<p>"Ay yah!" cried the Blackfoot as the fire bit.</p>

<p>He snatched the hand away, examining it with awe. His dignity
was broken. He leaped to his feet, gathering the robe hastily about
his shoulders, concealing his finery. He stared again at his hand,
and strode rapidly away, followed in confusion by his men.</p>

<p>"Boy, I could jist <i>love</i> yo'!" Joe's arms were around
Andy's shoulders. "Yo're wiser'n a he-wolf! Wagh! How'd yo' come to
think of <i>that?"</i></p>

<p>Andy looked about him dazed, as though just awakened. He smiled
sheepishly, hesitated.</p>

<p>"It sounds foolish," he said, "but somehow I didn't think of it.
It just came. It sounds foolish," he repeated, "but somehow it
seemed to me I wasn't doing it at all. It was somehow as if someone
were telling me, someone wise and&mdash;and&mdash;well, like my
grandfather, like Colonel Boone would have&mdash;I don't
know&mdash;I must be crazy!"</p>

<p>"Crazy like an owl!" cried Joe. "Yo' saved our ha'r. And look
thar!" He swept his arm to call attention to two old women coming
up the slope, bearing certain articles. "We eat!"</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>The squaws brought with them robes as well as food.</p>

<p>The three were now comfortable enough. But most evidently they
were prisoners. No guard was set about them; but, as Kelly pointed
out, at this time of year the mountains were sufficient, and the
snow. Except for a daily provision, delivered by two old women,
they were wholly ignored until five days later, when Andy was
peremptorily summoned by a ceremonially clad messenger. There was
nothing to do but to obey: which he did a little doubtfully.
However, he found he was merely to take part as a principal in a
ceremony. The hide of the white buffalo had been tanned and most
elaborately decorated. Now, afoot, a procession of chanting
warriors carried it, outspread, up the valley to the spot where
Andy had made the kill. There they hung the robe beneath a tall
tripod. The old chief made appropriate remarks: Andy was in the
foreground, probably as principal witness. They left the robe
dangling in the breeze. There it would hang until it rotted away;
or, more properly until, by disintegration, the Sun took to himself
the offering. As the Blackfoot piously believed, he had already
accepted the dedicated carcass. Certainly it was all gone, save for
the skull and a few scattered bones. That numerous wolf and other
tracks on the snow might indicate the Sun had had a little help had
nothing to do with the case.</p>

<p>The rites finished, the little band returned to camp, all easy
laughter and informality. They ignored Andy as though he had been
thin air. Evidently, as the favored killer of the white buffalo,
his presence had been essential. But that "bought him nothing"
further.</p>

<p>They returned, not to the cabin, but to the main Indian camp.
Here, in a wide open space left vacant in the middle of surrounding
lodges, were seated, in a circle, all the grown men of the band. A
small fire burned in the center, on one side of which stood a young
man holding a white horse, on each of whose flanks had been painted
the rayed effigy of the Sun. Its mane and tail had been shaved
clean. Joe and Kelly stood on the other side of the fire. A segment
of the circle had been left vacant to accommodate those who had
taken part in the dedication; Obeying a signed command Andy joined
his companions.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he asked them, low-voiced.</p>

<p>"Don't know," replied Joe, "but I reckon they're goin' to figger
what to do about us."</p>

<p>The circle was complete. The warriors sat cross-legged, silent,
staring straight in front of them at the ground. They were dressed
in heavily embroidered new white buckskin. Some wore the gorgeous
crown of eagle feathers. Some a fillet of feathers made
suggestively diabolic with curved buffalo horns. Some were
bare-headed, their long hair braided and caught into locks by bone
clasps, into which had been thrust eagle feathers or carved objects
of wood. The faces of some had been painted black; those of others
were patterned in colors; stripes of yellow, streaks of vermilion
across the forehead, the edges of the eyelids picked out in red. As
Andy looked about him he perceived that those comprising the great
circle were divided into groups, distinguished one from the other
by certain badges or tokens; a war eagle's claw bound to the wrist,
the red pole fringed with raven's feathers in a long row, the
crooked staff covered with otter skin with spaced eagle fathers,
the war club with buffalo hoofs hanging in a clump from the handle
end, short-handled rattles. These marked the different fraternal
orders, of various dignity, to which a warrior graduated by virtue
of attainment. Behind the motionless figures rose irregularly the
pointed painted lodges, their pole ends like fingers against the
sky. Behind each stood a tall tripod supporting a shield, a lance,
a pole from which at spaced intervals swung and fluttered the dried
and painted scalps of enemies killed in battle. Here and there
among the lodges stood small groups of women and children.</p>

<p>For a long time nothing happened. Then the pipe bearer lighted
the pipe and handed it to the chief. He pointed its stem to the
four parts of the compass, down toward the earth, upward toward the
sky, puffed on it three times, passed it to the man on his right.
Slowly it made the rounds of the circle. Then another long
pause.</p>

<p>The chief arose to his feet and stood aside. The young man
holding the white horse led the animal through the gap in the
circle. He threw off the rope from its neck, and at the same
instant the chief thrust the point of his knife into the animal's
rump. With a great plunge of pain and fright, it leaped away. Up
over the low table-land across the plain it raced at full speed.
But just as it seemed about to vanish in the low foothills below
the mountains, it turned; circled back; at length joined the great
band of ponies browsing in charge of boys just within the fringe of
willows. The chief, still on his feet, shading his eyes with the
flat of his hand, watched intently until the white horse had lost
itself in the herd. Then he resumed his place in the circle.</p>

<p>The whites viewed the performance with interest but as it meant
nothing to them, with detachment. Their interest would have been
considerably sharpened had they understood. If the Sun-painted on
the animal's side continued on over the mountains the sign would
have been clear that he withdrew his power. In which case their
lives would have been of little worth. But as the white horse
followed the other animals the augury was clear that the god
followed also.</p>

<p>Nor naturally did they comprehend the spaced leisurely speeches
that followed; though of course they knew their fate was in
balance. It was a court of judgment to decide what might be
considered a case in equity, if not in law. And like many modern
law cases, it was settled on a quibble.</p>

<p>Granted all the signs of power and favor from the Sun, there
still remained the inescapable fact that the tribe had sworn enmity
against the white man; and that it was known that the Sun
considered the breaking of a formal oath a most personal insult.
That certainly presented a fine enough distinction to be debated by
any Supreme Court of any land. Certainly it provided a good excuse,
either way, for the satisfaction of personal prejudice.</p>

<p>Some of the younger men were hostile. Their insistence was
vehement, fiery. But the older heads were not so sure. Finally one
of the youngest, a youth who wore the eagle claw, the emblem of the
"mosquitoes," the freshman fraternity, as it were, arose to his
feet diffidently. He was a young man of pleasing and kindly
countenance. It was not his place to speak in the council of great
warriors, but he thought the Sun had whispered in his ear, for the
brilliance of his inspiration he modestly disclaimed as beyond his
own powers. He explained. A guttural murmur of applause followed
his suggestion. It was just the sort of fine-spun evasion that
pleases lawyers; and Indians seated in council, not too vividly
swayed by emotions, are essentially dialecticians.</p>

<p>Truly the white men were enemies. Truly the tribe had sworn to
consider them such. Truly to violate that oath would insult the
Sun. Truly it was a question no man could decide wisely, whether
the Sun would be more affronted by a disregard of his repeated
evidences of favor for these white men, or by the breaking of an
oath made solemnly to his face. It was a dilemma full of danger.
But here was a way out: How does one treat an enemy? One steals his
horses: that had been done. One sheds his blood. Why not take some
of the blood of these white men without killing them?</p>

<p>Save in the case of a few implacables this brilliant suggestion
was received with acclaim and relief. Kiasax, for that was the
young man's name, was in consideration awarded the privilege of
carrying through what amounted to a bit of true symbolism. The
chief handed him his own knife. Kiasax advanced upon the captives,
who, ignorant of the decision, gave themselves up as dead men. To
their astonishment the young man merely turned back their sleeves
and in the forearm of each made a tiny incision. Then the circle
broke up. The whites were returned to their cabin. As for Kiasax,
he thereby gained great honor, for he was permitted to remove his
lodge and his pretty young wife and his baby to the innermost
circle of the camp, surrounding the council space, reserved for the
great men of the tribe; and he was graduated at once from the
juvenile "mosquitoes" to the fraternity of The Buffalo With Thin
Horns, to the great envy of the Dogs and the Prairie Dogs and Those
Who Carry the Raven, whose orders he should have passed through in
normal sequence.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Nothing further happened. The Indian camp carried on a busy and
happy life in the bottomlands. The white men waited at the cabin,
because for the moment there was nothing else to do. The old squaw
whose job it was brought them their food regularly. She was
ignorant of, or pretended to be ignorant of, the sign language.</p>

<p>The situation was doubtful, but not so dark as it might have
been. There was nothing to do at present but to accept it. After
the snows had melted and the summer was well established would be
time enough to make plans for escape. No use speculating before
then, Kelly pointed out; the conditions were too uncertain.</p>

<p>"If they do not move out of the Hole and take us with them, and
if they do not put a guard on us, it might not be too difficult,"
said Kelly. "If we can make it as far as the range yonder, I'll
guarantee they'll have trouble getting hold of us. Once there, we
can strike over the shed and make it somehow."</p>

<p>But there were a good many "ifs" and possibilities. Nobody knew
just how far this Sun-favor went. It might be, when the time came,
that they could walk away in open daylight, and no one would stop
them!</p>

<p>"And mebbe not," observed Joe.</p>

<p>Of one thing only were they sure: that when the season opened
they must attempt escape.</p>

<p>Their resources were few, but might have been fewer.</p>

<p>There was Knock-'em-stiff, the Boone gun; and Andy's knife and
Andy's tomahawk, and the lens from the telescope.</p>

<p>"Ef'n we could only get hold of powder and ball, we'd be set
up," sighed Joe. "Keep yore eyes shinin'. Mebbe'll come a
chance."</p>

<p>There were plenty of percussion caps in Andy's possible sacks
The Indians had robbed the older men clean; but Andy's personal
possessions, with the exception of the ammunition, they had left
intact.</p>

<p>Another evidence that he was held to be in a different category
from his companions was soon forthcoming. The three decided to walk
down for a look at the Indian camp. Such an excursion might
conceivably prove dangerous; but inaction was wearing on them.</p>

<p>"Jist take it easy and keep yore eyes shinin'," said Joe, "and
back out quiet if you have to."</p>

<p>At the outskirts of the encampment Joe and Kelly were stopped
and ordered back by a warrior carrying the police emblem. He signed
to Andy that this prohibition did not extend to him.</p>

<p>Andy hesitated a moment as to whether to take advantage of the
implied permission. The thought of venturing alone suddenly lost
its appeal. But on second thought he decided to go on. He was
curious; he might stumble upon valuable information; it was barely
possible he might locate ammunition on which then or later he might
get his hands. But principally, and immediately, he took a
chuckling and boyish delight in passing Joe with his nose in the
air.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this first afternoon he used discretion, merely
wandering down past the outskirts of the encampment, to the river
and back again. The numerous cur dogs dashed at him, snarling and
barking. Some children tumbled out from behind the lodges to huddle
together, staring at him. He spoke to them, and signed friendship;
whereupon the youngest fled, uttering small squeaks. The older boys
held their ground, their flint-like eyes unwavering; but made no
other acknowledgment. At the river were a number of women and girls
chattering and laughing. On his appearance they scattered like
quail. Over in the center of the village, beyond the blank, rounded
backs of the painted lodges, he could see many figures moving
about, the rising of smokes; he heard the sounds of lively talk and
merriment. He did not quite dare intrude into the enclosure as yet,
but contented himself by an approach close enough to afford him a
glimpse of varied activities. He did not see very much. Men and
women were moving about, emerging from the low doorways, stooping
to enter. A close-gathered group bent over some sort of game. Small
boys and dogs ran about. But the air was sharp; and most of the
people were in shelter. Nevertheless Andy gained the impression of
light-hearted merriment, of good fellowship and gayety quite at
variance with his preconceptions of Indian character.</p>

<p>He was inclined, on his return, to poke a little fun at Joe over
his especial privilege.</p>

<p>"Seems to me," observed Joe, "I heerd somewhar these Injins fat
up their gods a spell to git them good and prime for killin'."</p>

<p>"The old tough ones they just skin alive," said Kelly dryly.</p>

<p>Andy took full advantage of his privileges, however. It was
something to do; and it was very interesting. Tentative experiment
proved to him that he could wander about as he pleased. Nobody
stopped him; nobody paid him the least attention. The Blackfeet did
not ignore him, for ignoring is a conscious act. To them he simply
was not there. Andy at times was overcome by a weird feeling that
indeed he must have died, thrown off all bodily solidity, become
invisible, thin air. Or, contrariwise, that this shifting,
colorful, barbaric scene itself had no actuality; that he walked in
a vision, a dream of his own subjective consciousness. Only the
dogs and the youngest children bestowed on him a notice that made
the shadow world real. And certain concealed, shy, quick glances
stolen by some of the pretty young girls when they thought he did
not see them. A tentative greeting he ventured to some of the men
did not even gain the recognition of rebuff.</p>

<p>But this complete detachment had one advantage. The ordinary
business of the camp went forward without modification or
interruption. Andy could look; and look he did: and he found it all
so interesting that he came at last to spend nearly all his waking
hours in the Blackfoot camp.</p>

<p>He had a good many surprises: and some of his preconceptions
went by the board. One was that, as already stated, of Indian
taciturnity and gravity. They were a laughing, merry people, given
to fun and games. Another was that the squaws were ill-treated
drudges. To be sure they seemed to do all the camp work, and some
of it was laborious; but they took their time at it, and seemed to
enjoy it and to take a pride in it. And they appeared to be well
treated, with many evidences of real affection and tenderness. Andy
spent much of his time watching their activities; partly because
his practical mind found much of interest in their ways of
accomplishing things; and partly because, try as they might, they
could not quite gain to the men's total detachment. He felt himself
noticed; acknowledged as a human being.</p>

<p>The eyes of the girls especially fluttered slyly sidewise toward
the tall young frontiersman. The things he saw stored themselves in
the recesses of his mind: and so gradually he acquired an
understanding of Indian methods and Indian thought possessed by few
white men; a knowledge that later was to stand him in good stead
and to make him famous.</p>

<p>He watched them make the store of pemmican and pack it in the
boxes of hardened hides&mdash;parfleche; and then spend long hours
decorating the boxes until the esthetic as well as the practical
sense was satisfied. He saw them whiten the buckskin by means of a
certain fungus; and in later years, remembering this, he saved
himself by noticing that fungus had been torn from trees, and so
deducing the presence of hostiles. He saw them decorate the
buckskin also, with elaborate patterns of beads, each of which was
patiently threaded on sinew and sewed on separately, of quills
yellowed with a dye made from the moss of fir trees, reddened by a
root hacked out of the frozen ground and boiled. They cut wood in
the thickets and brought it in. They carried water from the river.
This might be called hard work; but they accomplished it singing
and laughing and sky-larking. They seemed to be having a good time.
Of a morning, when the sun was warm, the chiefs and warriors sat
cross-legged on robes at the lodges' entrance while their wives
made their toilets, plucking carefully, stray hairs from their
smooth faces with hardwood tweezers, dressing their hair, renewing
the paint patterns on their faces. Whenever the man of their lodge
brought in game, they dressed it and cooked it.</p>

<p>Nor were the men inactive and lazy, as Andy had understood. To
be sure they spent a good deal of their time smoking and talking.
Their activities, like those of the women, were intermittent; but
none the less effective.</p>

<p>The mere question of sustenance was serious, and that was the
man's job. The tribe possessed few firearms. Except the rifles
taken from Joe and Kelly, they were all smooth-bores, ill kept and
badly sighted. Most of the hunting was with bow and arrow. A good
proportion of the male population was always afield. Hunting took
up much of the time and energy. The surplus of the latter
overflowed into horse races, shooting matches with the bow,
wrestling contests, foot races. Andy hung about the sports rather
wistfully. He was young enough to want to take part. Especially
would he have liked to have a try at the races and the wrestling.
He wanted too to test his skill at a game quite new to him. A small
beaded hoop, or wheel, a foot or so in diameter, was rolled rapidly
past the contestants, who shot arrows at it, or thrust at it
spearwise with staves. To knock the hoop over seemed to count
against the player as much as a miss. There were also seated games
with bones or pebbles that passed from hand to hand, but these Andy
did not understand. Each of these games had its own song which the
contestants, and sometimes the spectators, chanted
continuously.</p>

<p>One afternoon a group and a commotion up on the tableland
attracted him to the horse herd. The young warrior, Kiasax, was
engaged in breaking a pony. The animal was quite wild, indeed a
mustang, captured and turned into the herd the autumn previous, but
never before handled. When Andy arrived Kiasax had choked the
animal to unconsciousness by means of a slip noose, and was
"hogtying" its feet together. He loosened the rope. As soon as the
beast had regained consciousness he began to beat it over the head
with a wolf skin. The pony flopped and struggled in terror; but at
last lay quiet.</p>

<p>Kiasax untied its legs. The pony lay for a moment; then leaped
to its feet, plunging and rearing. Again Kiasax choked it down;
tied it; beat its head with the wolf skin. After the fourth
repetition the horse no longer struggled. Kiasax approached
cautiously and laid his hand on its shoulder. Instantly the beast
reared and struck. More wolf skin. Kiasax was very patient. Inside
the hour the pony stood, trembling, his eyes rolling, but quiet,
while Kiasax gingerly cinched to his back the high saddle. He did
not attempt to mount, but contented himself by running the animal
in a long circle, drawing it gradually to him. At the extreme end
of the rope he treated it roughly, tenderly when near. Andy had
never heard of this method of breaking a horse; but it was
effective. Next day he saw Kiasax riding the animal, which was
already as gentle as were all the other Indian ponies.</p>

<p>He returned through the encampment as the first dusk was
falling. He had not yet summoned the nerve to enter the lodges, but
now he peered within one of them. Its interior was dark except for
the embers of the fire in the center. The half-light revealed dim
guessed forms in a circle and the dim glow of the pipe as it slowly
passed. A woman leaned over and dropped a bit of buffalo fat on the
fire. For an instant the flame shot up. Andy saw the muffled
figures of men, and intent grave faces, and spread robes and things
hanging.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Once a day every child in the village above the age of two was
dipped in the icy waters of the river. This had <i>two</i> results:
it hardened them to resistance of the severe cold to which the
northern winters subjected them, and it made them fearless of
water. Too much so, sometimes, One afternoon Andy, wandering idly
along the stream's edge, saw an infant of possibly three years
toddle across the rim ice and slip into the river, where instantly
the current sucked it under. Andy dove after it without hesitation;
by a miracle got hold of it; by another miracle extricated himself
and managed to hitch his burden out on the thin ice and so to the
shore. Before he could think what next to do a young and pretty
woman followed closely by a man flew down the bank and snatched the
strangling infant from his arms. Kiasax&mdash;for it was
he&mdash;in his turn seized the child. They bent anxiously over it
for a moment, then hurried back up the bank again toward the
lodges. Andy was left shivering in his dripping garments. They had
not even glanced at him.</p>

<p>Nor when next day he encountered Kiasax face to face in the
village did the young Blackfoot show the faintest sign of
recognition, or, indeed, awareness of Andy's existence. Andy was
just a bit sore. After all he had wet down his best buckskins and
chilled himself to the bone, not to mention the small matter of
personal risk. Joe laughed at him.</p>

<p>"You keep thinkin' Injuns is human," said he.</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> human," Andy insisted unexpectedly. "A lot more
human than some people I know. I've been watching them. I like
them: I wish they'd like me."</p>

<p>For a moment Joe was shocked; then he thought he had the
solution, and grinned.</p>

<p>"Nev' mind," he soothed in mock consolation. "Crow gals is jist
as good-lookin'-ef'n yo' git out of this with yore ha'r."</p>

<p>But Andy's heresy from common white opinion was no sex urge.</p>

<p>However, that afternoon his heart was lightened.</p>

<p>Passing the willows of the bottomland, his attention was caught
by the continuous agonized bleating of a rabbit in distress.
Turning into the thicket to investigate, he found himself face to
face with Kiasax, who had made this realistic imitation to draw him
aside.</p>

<p>There was nothing of emotional stolidity about the young
Blackfoot now. He seized Andy's hand and pressed it to his heart.
Then, in sign talk so rapid that Andy could hardly follow it, he
poured forth gratitude. The Little Warrior was his only son; long
had the Water People desired to seize him and take him down to
dwell with them. His woman&mdash;he supplemented the sign by spoken
syllables: Nit-o-ké-man&mdash;had seen this in a dream, in the Moon
of Wolves. The two of them had made medicine against the Water
People, but the power of the Water People was strong, stronger than
their medicine. But the Sun-Power of this white man was stronger.
Were it not for Andy their hearts, the hearts of Kiasax and
Nit-o-ké-man&mdash;again he pronounced the names&mdash;would have
been on the ground.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Andy had a friend; a friend of his own age, and, as it proved,
of his own ardent and eager temperament. Their affinity struck
deeper than the mere tie of gratitude. In spite of the differences
of their race, their breeding, their civilization, their manners of
thought, they took to one another instantly.</p>

<p>They could not meet openly. That, Kiasax explained, was as much
as his life was worth. Before the public of the village he could
not deviate from the prescribed attitude by the flicker of an eye.
But they spent long hours together in private. The lower end of the
willow bottom afforded them secure concealment. There was nothing
to take anyone to that part of the valley: it was too distant for
children's excursions. The sun-bared interlacing wind-falls enabled
them to break the trail. Sometimes he came alone; sometimes the
woman, Nit-e-ké-man, came with him, bringing the child. At their
first meeting she had shyly pressed the white boy's hand to her
heart. After that she sat apart while the young men talked, silent,
her eyes, cast down. The Little Warrior tumbled sturdily about.</p>

<p>Spring was drawing on rapidly. Long hours the two young men sat
in the sun, exploring each other's minds; a delightful occupation
warmed in the climate of genuine sympathy.</p>

<p>At first, naturally, all communication had to be in sign talk.
But gradually Andy began to acquire some fluency in the difficult
Blackfoot tongue. His eagerness to learn, coupled with a natural
aptitude for languages and Kiasax's delight in teaching him, made
for unusual and astonishing progress. In return he tried to
instruct the young Indian in English, but with less success.
Shortly the two were conversing in a queer melange of all three,
fluently, happily, and most of the time without consciousness as to
exactly how they were getting their ideas over. But they did get
them over, a true communion not only of thought but of emotion.
Curiously enough Andy said nothing of this friendship to Joe and
Kelly; why, he could not have told.</p>

<p>They had much to talk about. At last Andy could satisfy his
curiosity as to the purport of many things he had observed. He
learned the significance of the white horse; and its importance to
his own fate; and the meaning of the knife incisions. Kiasax
modestly said nothing of his own part in that decision.</p>

<p>"Your Sun-Power was great, and wisdom came," said he.</p>

<p>In a burst of confidence Andy showed Kiasax the burning glass
and demonstrated its use. He did so recklessly, thrusting aside all
thought of his companions' disapproval, could they have known.
Kiasax was his friend! He dealt openly with Kiasax!</p>

<p>But the exhibition in no way lessened Kiasax's awe of the
phenomenon. It was still supernatural, an evidence of Andy's
Sun-Power. The lens was merely a talisman, a charm in obedience to
which the mighty Sun came down from the heavens, made itself small,
performed the white boy's bidding. He gazed reverently on the
focused glowing spot, and covered his mouth with the flat of his
hand.</p>

<p>Andy learned that the apparently haphazard head-dresses had
significance, so that one informed could read in them, as in an
open book, of the wearer's deeds. Thus an eagle feather thrust
horizontally in the hair meant that its owner had, in sight of
enemies, touched a dead or alive foeman with his hand; an upright
feather signified that he had killed by a blow of the fist; a small
piece of wood, that he had slain with musket or bow; a carved
wooden knife painted red, that he had struck with that weapon. On
the other hand a feather stripped to the quill except at the tip
indicated merely that its wearer had been the first to discover and
give warning of hostiles. This was a common decoration, not very
highly prized. Still it was a good start for a young and
enterprising warrior. A peculiar bracelet&mdash;Kiasax wore
two&mdash;was permitted him who took a prisoner. When a warrior's
deeds overcrowded his head space, so that specific mention of each
became impossible, he assumed the feather headdress and horns.
There were not many such.</p>

<p>These and many, many other things Kiasax explained to Andy,
pleased at his eager and genuine interest. Andy himself did not
realize as yet the value of what he was learning; did not
appreciate that he was slowly absorbing a knowledge of Indian ways
and psychology unique among the white men of his time.</p>

<p>In return he tried to give Kiasax some idea of white man's
cities; white man's wonders. This was more difficult. The Indian
expressed no incredulity; but he covered his mouth.</p>

<p>Andy was not so polite or so tactful in his reaction to some of
his friend's statements. As when Kiasax told him of the medicine
men; of how the priest, retiring within his little tent, called
thunder and lightning from clear skies, and a strong wind; or of
how the lodge was shaken violently from no apparent cause, and
great voices were heard. He shook his head over this. Kiasax was in
no way abashed.</p>

<p>"It may not be so with the white man," he replied reasonably,
"but how do you know it is not so with the Indian? You tell me many
strange things which happen to the white man. I do not tell you no,
though I know they could never happen to the Indian."</p>

<p>On one point only could Andy at first get no satisfaction. It
was the most important point of all, and he hammered at it
constantly. What was to become of them? For a long time Kiasax
would not reply, or only vaguely and briefly.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he answered. "It is a matter for the chief
men." Kiasax was reluctant, embarrassed. It was evident that he
knew more than he would disclose. But Andy persisted. At last the
young Indian gave way.</p>

<p>Andy's life was safe: he was protected by the Sun: nobody would
dare affront the greatest of the gods by flouting that protection.
That was the first bit of information he succeeded in digging out.
As to his status, Kiasax was genuinely ignorant&mdash;whether he
would be captive, slave, or honored. That could not be decided by
this small band: it must be settled at the great council of the
Blackfeet when they should gather in the Berries-ripe Moon, over
the Mountains, where the Cold-Maker comes from.</p>

<p>And his companions, Andy pressed.</p>

<p>"They will be killed," replied Kiasax indifferently. "At the end
of the spring hunting, in the Thunder Bird Arrives Moon."</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>This was sufficiently definite and sufficiently dismaying to be
reported. Andy took his companions into his confidence. They
listened attentively, with full appreciation of the situation. The
escape must be attempted earlier than anticipated; much earlier
than desired. For a number of reasons they would have preferred a
later date; the mountains would be more passable; it would be more
difficult for the Indians to follow their trail; it would be easier
to secure sustenance. It must be remembered that, while the Boone
gun remained in Andy's possession, ammunition lacked. They must
live on what they could dig and snare. Joe had already collected
and laid away a hank of horsehair for the latter purpose. Both the
older men seemed to take certain things so entirely for granted
that they did not even bring them up for discussion. One was that
Andy would prefer to take his chances with them rather than become
a sacred man among the Blackfeet; in which they were correct. The
other was that they need expect no help from Andy's Indian
friend.</p>

<p>As to the latter point Andy differed vehemently&mdash;at
first.</p>

<p>"Sure, Kiasax is yore friend," Joe soothed him. "I ain't argyin'
that. When yo' got a friend among Injuns he sticks same as a white
man. He'll do any thin' for yo' he kin do. He mout even die for
yo'. He'll do anything but one thing&mdash;and that is to go agin
the law of his tribe, and especial the religion of his tribe. Dunno
as I kin blame him," Joe was fair-minded, "because the minute he
does that he's an outlaw, a renegade, he don't belong to nothin',
So 'less'n he's prepared to quit his people complete he ain't goin'
agin custom, If yore life was in danger, mebbe. But it ain't. Have
yo' traded knives?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Why, no," replied Andy frankly puzzled. "Kiasax did want to
trade, but this is my grandfather's knife, you know; and I know its
balance, so I wouldn't do it."</p>

<p>"Wall," drawled Joe, "ef'n an Injun'll trade knives with yo'
that makes yo' his brother forever." He arose and fumbled in a
crevice in the rafters. "Yere's a skinnin' knife I happened to
stick up thar whar she wasn't found. Trade him this. And see how
fur he'll go."</p>

<p>Kiasax was greatly pleased. He made a little ceremony of the
exchange, drawing blood from his own and from Andy's forearm with
each knife in turn.</p>

<p>"Now we are brothers," he said.</p>

<p>But at Andy's proposals he stiffened to the strange Indian
stolidity that seems to throw everything off a hard and polished
surface. In vain Andy pleaded that the white men were also his
brothers&mdash;that he could not accept his own life if theirs were
forfeit; that if it came to a choice he must throw his lot with
theirs in an attempt at escape, no matter how desperate. He wanted
no active assistance. Two things would suffice: a few hours' start;
ammunition for the long rifle. Kiasax set his face like flint. For
a long time he would not even reply. At last the force of Andy's
pleading broke down his defense to the point of grudging
explanation.</p>

<p>"No Blackfoot will harm you, my brother," said he. "You are
safe. As for these others, they are of your people. My heart is on
the ground. But I have my people. If I were to help you, as you
ask, they would do to me what is done to one who is false."</p>

<p>"They need not know," protested Andy eagerly. "You can watch
your chance. A little powder, a few balls. Who can know?"</p>

<p>"If I am a crooked stick to my people. I must tell them so. I am
a Warrior, a Buffalo with Thin Horns. I could not live among them
and keep this lie in my heart." He was genuinely troubled.</p>

<p>"Even this I would do for you, for you are my brother, and I
have sworn on the Knife to die for you. For me it is as the wind.
But also Nit-o-ké-man, the Little Warrior; they too. You would not
ask this, my brother? I have no more words."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Andy slowly. He did not argue further, His own
generous spirit sensed the full significance of an authentic point
of honor.</p>

<p>Kiasax covered his face with his blanket, grieving.</p>

<p>Nit-o-ké-man too covered her face and uttered small crooning
sounds of lamentation. Even the Little Warrior, subdued by this
sudden cloud across the sun, ceased his play and sidled close to
the woman's side.</p>

<p>"I understand," said Andy sadly. "But&mdash;" he
hesitated&mdash;"you will not tell that we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know nothing," said Kiasax. "The wind has passed my ears.
Aie," he mourned, "my heart is on the ground."</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>Joe and Kelly accepted Andy's report philosophically. It was as
they had expected.</p>

<p>There was no sense in further delay. Already the snows were
vanishing. Every day brought danger nearer. Shortly it might be
considered worth while to set a guard on their movements; even to
confine them. Best be away before the Blackfeet leaders thought it
possible they would attempt the mountains.</p>

<p>They sat in the dim light of the fire, making their plans. The
first consideration was to leave as little and as blind a trail as
possible. Andy told of the windfalls in the bottom on which they
could travel to beyond his usual rendezvous with Kiasax.
Thence&mdash;Joe took up the plan&mdash;they must swim slanting
down the current as far as a strip of bare talus on which they
could land without leaving tracks. Andy shivered in
anticipation.</p>

<p>"Thought you couldn't swim, Joe," Kelly reminded
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Man kin do anything he has to," returned Joe, unabashed.</p>

<p>Up the talus, avoiding earth and snowfields. Over the pass as
rapidly as possible. It would be difficult, for obviously the pass
was not open yet for normal travel. Perhaps impossible. But the
Blackfeet would hardly&mdash;at least at first&mdash;believe they
would attempt it. They would search at the start for traces in the
lower hills. Once over the summit they must shift as best they
might.</p>

<p>How would they live? Horsehair snares. In a game country,
perhaps the chance to appropriate wolf kills. The inner part of
thistle stalks. Roots. Buds. Pull in your belly.</p>

<p>"Hard doin's," said Joe soberly. "Ef'n we only <i>jist</i> had a
leetle powder and ball!"</p>

<p>Other conditions were not the most favorable, even for such a
desperate attempt. In order to make way through the windfalls
without leaving tracks some light would be necessary. There was a
moon; but it did not rise until near morning. However...</p>

<p>So they muttered, exchanging ideas, weighing chances. None of
them wanted to sleep.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight they were frozen to silence by a faint
scratching at the door. After a moment Kelly arose, crossed the
little cabin in three steps, flung aside the covering to the
opening. A figure slipped inside. It was Nit-o-ké-man.</p>

<p>She was completely muffled in a robe. Her head was bare. She
hung her head.</p>

<p>"Take!" she said; and, without looking up, held to Andy a small
bundle which she produced from beneath her robe. He hesitated.
"Take!" she repeated insistently. "Ai-ee!" she wailed with a sudden
intensity; then with a sudden, quick turning movement vanished. The
skin covering to the doorway quivered a moment; hung still. Slowly,
a little confused, Andy opened the bundle. It contained his powder
horn, his shot pouch, and a small store of dried meat.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-10" id="ch1-10"></a>CHAPTER 10. Assiniboins</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>IT WAS but a scant two hours until dawn before the late waning
moon had risen above the ranges to give sufficient light. To these
white men huddling in the cabin the time from midnight on seemed
interminable. Every minute that passed seemed a minute wasted. Yet
if the escape was to prove successful they must wait, No man can
walk the crisscross of bottomland windfalls in pitch darkness: if
they were to leave no trail for the Blackfeet they must keep their
moccasins from earth and snow.</p>

<p>Their preparations were necessarily simple. Andy loaded the
Boone gun. The powder smuggled to him by Nit-o-ké-man was his own,
and therefore of good quality. The shot pouch also was his own.
This was sheer good luck. Nit-o-ké-man might well have brought the
arnmunition belonging to some of the old fusees owned by the
Indians. Of course they could have made shift. Trade powder burned
slow and dirty, but it exploded&mdash;generally. The lead of the
musket balls could have been refashioned to the grooved barrel. But
it would have been an inaccurate makeshift. Here lacked only
patches for a proper loading, fit for nail-driving. There
<i>were</i> a few in the patch box in the butt, but not many. Joe
rummaged the crevice under the rafters to haul <i>out</i> the
ragged remains of the garments Andy had long since discarded for
his buckskins.</p>

<p>"Thar you be!" he cried triumphantly, "didn't I tell yon not to
throw nothin' away&mdash;that it shore would come in handy
sometime? Cut yo' patches from that shirt."</p>

<p>And when the time came to venture, the old clothes justified Joe
once more by "coming in handy" again. They were wetted, then laid
craftily in and around the freshly fueled fire. There they would
smolder for hours. The resultant smoke, escaping through the cowled
hole in the roof, would give the cabin the appearance of
habitation, and as none of the Blackfeet, with the exception of the
old woman who brought food, ever came near the place, this should
afford the fugitives a start of hours, even in daylight.</p>

<p>The morning was snapping with cold. The sky was blue black,
asparkle with stars. Only, over the high eastern ranges, spread the
milky extinguishing paleness of the moon. At first the fugitives
could see nothing. They stood patiently until their irises
expanded, until they could make out, dimly, the markings on the
snow's surface. Then, stepping carefully in the old moccasin
trails, they stole down toward the river bottom.</p>

<p>All went well for a time. They were nearly past the sleeping
village. Then the breeze, which had been blowing steadily
downstream, suddenly fell flat, whirled a stray gust in the
opposite direction, A dog barked.</p>

<p>"Down! Down!" hissed Joe.</p>

<p>The three threw themselves on their faces.</p>

<p>But the dog had had a noseful, and he clamored excitedly in the
strange mixture of bark and wailing howl peculiar to Indian
canines. In two seconds the night was hideous with sound as every
other dog in the encampment&mdash;and there were dozens of
them&mdash;joined the chorus. The men flattened themselves close to
the earth, cursing steadily under their breaths.</p>

<p>The clamor was enough to wake the dead. The fugitives caught
momentary red gleams as opening tent flaps showed the coals of
fires within. Against the sky they made out, here and there, the
silhouettes of men peering, listening.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this human reinforcement the dogs redoubled their
outcries. Some of the bolder even made short dashes toward the
outer darkness; but with hind legs in reverse, ready to scuttle
back. They were, however, very bold with their tongues; daring the
hidden monster; hurling opprobrious epithets; histrionic, after the
manner of dogs showing off their zeal before their masters.</p>

<p>A fox barked sharply in reply, so close to Andy's elbow as
almost to startle him into movement. A touch of Joe's hand
restrained him. The fox barked again, and yet again. Obviously it
returned the dogs as good as they sent. Obviously it gave its
contemptuous opinion of dogs in general and these dogs in
particular. It defied the whole race of dogs.</p>

<p>The hullabaloo in the encampment trebled in volume.</p>

<p>The dogs told the fox just what they would do to him if only
stern duty did not hold them. But they did not venture. Deep-seated
racial experience had taught them the extreme insalubrity of the
wilderness night.</p>

<p>The chorus broke up in a medley of astounded and indignant
yelps, through which could be distinguished sharp human language
and a dull thud or so as a moccasined foot or a billet of wood
found its mark. Evidently the Indians also had heard the fox. Only
the original dog, the one whose nostrils had caught veritable
evidence, persisted self-righteously in his warning. But his
quavering howl too terminated in a sharp <i>yip</i> of pain.</p>

<p>His fleeing form darted across the skyline to plunge
precipitately to the haven of a lodge flap, where presumably he
brooded on the injustice of man.</p>

<p>After a few moments the white men rose cautiously to their feet,
and so reached the river bank undiscovered.</p>

<p>Joe removed his cap and wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he breathed. "Thought shore our powder was all wet that
time. Good thing I larned to talk fox!"</p>

<p>"Was that <i>you?"</i> whispered Andy, astonished.</p>

<p>"What'd you think?" asked Joe sarcastically. "Think I had me a
tame fox to foller me around?"</p>

<p>"Let's get on," said Kelly with a touch of impatience. "It's
getting to be daylight."</p>

<p>Indeed the delay had been longer than they had supposed. The
sun, in close pursuit of the moon, was filling the sky with an
added paleness. Apparently there was as yet no actual light; and
yet, dimly, objects about them were becoming distinguishable.
Although they had escaped discovery thus far, the check was like to
prove disastrous yet.</p>

<p>But it turned out to be good fortune in disguise. The original
plan had been to make their way up the river bottom over the
jackstraws of fallen aspens, which would leave no trail; then to
swim the river. But the new visibility revealed to them a great
cottonwood, loosened at the roots by the thaws, and newly fallen in
such fashion that it spanned the stream. In complete darkness they
would have passed it by.</p>

<p>"Wagh!" cried Joe under his breath, when he saw this. "She's a
lucky trip. We gits our powder and ball, we gits our jerky, now we
gits our bridge!" His irrepressible spirits were bubbling again.
"No cold water for this child!"</p>

<p>He untied his moccasins and slung them about his neck.</p>

<p>"Barefoot holds better'n parfleche," said he. "Take 'em off,
Andy."</p>

<p>"And hurry!" urged Kelly. "We're in plain sight of camp."</p>

<p>The crossing was a ticklish business, for while the tree trunk
was thick, the dark water thrust against it strongly. Its whole
length was aquiver. Andy had to use great will power to hold his
attention away from the whirl and boil of the rushing current. He
felt that if he yielded for the fraction of a second he must topple
into giddiness. He gave his whole mind to reaching one bare foot
sideways to the left, bringing the other bare foot alongside, over
and over again, sidling slowly like a crab. The log seemed of
interminable length. He did not dare look up to see what progress
he had made. He was among branches around which he must squirm and
still retain his upright equilibrium. The trunk had divided, become
small. Its trembling had increased to a veritable swaying. Then
from the corner of his eye he saw the beach. He made a single
desperate leap sideways. He was ashore.</p>

<p>Hastily retying their moccasins they ran rapidly down the stony
stream bed past betraying snowfields to a point where naked talus
afforded them an unmarked ascent. Up this they toiled as fast as
they could climb. It was full daylight. The camp was directly
across from them, distant by only the width of the stream. If any
early riser were to emerge from one of the lodges, were to glance
in their direction, discovery was inevitable. They scrambled
desperately, gasping for breath, their hearts pounding in their
breasts. Andy's legs were leaden. He felt that he could not lift
his feet another dozen paces; and yet, paradoxically, he seemed to
himself to be raising his knees absurdly, inordinately high, an
illusion of exhaustion.</p>

<p>"Wagh!" exploded Joe, suddenly. "Down! Down!" They dropped
behind a talus block, breathing heavily.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>At the very instant of their disappearance a devilish outbreak
of shrieks, cries, yells, and whoops, punctuated by musket shuts,
burst from the village across the way. Andy gripped his rifle and
peered around the edge of the talus block. At first, so certain was
his preconception of discovery, he did not understand what he saw.
He was aware merely of a confusion of figures running about. Joe's
comment focused the situation for him.</p>

<p>"Told you she's a lucky trip!" exulted the trapper. "Now they're
so busy they won't <i>never</i> pay us no attention!"</p>

<p>It was now clear that the Blackfoot camp was the subject of a
surprise attack.</p>

<p>"Assiniboins," said Kelly after an attentive examination.</p>

<p>"Who'd have thought they'd ever git west the divide this time of
year!" marveled Joe.</p>

<p>"Not the Blackfeet, evidently," said Kelly. "They're caught as
flat-footed as we were."</p>

<p>The Assiniboins had crept up on foot; had at a signal made a
concerted rush from three sides. The Blackfeet, caught totally
unprepared, awakened from sleep, catching up what weapons were next
their hands, stumbling scattered from their lodges, were pounced
upon before they had gathered their wits to offer defense. For a
moment or so the slaughter was almost unopposed. Then here and
there single champions, reckless with desperation, began to fight
back. Many of them were overwhelmed; but not before they had done
some damage. Others made head, slowly forced a way to coherence in
small groups. The din was fearful; for to the cries of the warriors
were added the shrieks of the women and the wails of the
children.</p>

<p>The Assiniboins were darting alertly and eagerly about, doing
just as much damage as they possibly could in the briefest possible
time. That was what they were there for. They kept after the
individual warriors just as long, and only as long, as the odds
were overwhelmingly in their favor. As soon as a Blackfoot
succeeded in struggling to the nucleus near the chief's lodge, they
abandoned him for easier prey. If enough Blackfeet survived and got
together to warrant a counter attack, then the Assiniboins would
withdraw. They were comparatively few in numbers. If they could
wipe out the camp without a pitched battle, well and good. If not
they would be abundantly satisfied with the scalps they could take
and the destruction they could inflict. In the meantime others of
the band would be gathering the horses and running them up the
valley toward the low passes to the north. That was the method of
Indian warfare.</p>

<p>Joe, watching critically the course of events, explained these
things to Andy in running comment. Kelly, at the other side of the
talus block, occasionally added a word. Both the older trappers
were calm and obviously pleased with the shaping of events.</p>

<p>"Told you she was a lucky trip!" Joe kept repeating. "Everything
laid out to order. We'll jist cache right here until the Blackfeet
put up a real fight. Ef'n we move now some stray mout look up and
see us. When the real fight starts all hands will be too busy. Set
still, Andy; we'll tell you when."</p>

<p>This was directed at Andy's obvious restlessness. The younger
man could not share his companions' cool detachment. The affair was
dreadful, agonizing. From inside the lodges women, little children
ran shrieking; were overtaken by bounding Assiniboin warriors;
felled by blows from the terrible "warhawks." Brave men, fighting
bravely, went down overcome by the press of numbers, and their
bleeding scalps were brandished in triumph. Lodges toppled; came
down with a crash, enveloping their floundering inmates, who were
pounced upon and slaughtered out of hand. It was a nightmare, in
the rapid and confused movement of which no detail could be seized
and held; on no single incident of which the eye could rest long
enough to catch an outcome.</p>

<p>Then suddenly one situation leaped from chaos very clearly. A
tall warrior emerged from the interior of one of the lodges
dragging a woman by the hair. These figures Andy distinguished
plainly; so plainly that for the moment all else of the swift
terrible confusion faded into a mere background of commotion.
Details irrelevant and unimportant registered on his mind. For
example, somehow he had space of leisure to notice such small
things as that the Assiniboin wore a white buckskin cap: that he
was naked to the waist; that he wore a peculiar necklace made of
wolves' tails; that his warhawk was decorated with feathers. There
things registered instantaneously, as a lightning flash reveals.
Andy saw at the same time that the woman was Nit-o-ké-man.</p>

<p>Motion seemed suspended. The warhawk was raised for the blow,
but did not descend. Andy appeared to himself to be moving with a
cool deliberation in an ample leisure. He thrust forward the muzzle
of the long rifle; he assured a careful sight on the Assiniboin's
head; he slowly squeezed the trigger. As he did so a story told by
his grandmother recalled itself in complete detail; how in the
siege of Boonesborough Colonel Boone had dropped a sharpshboter
from a distant tree&mdash;"a notable feat," the old lady had said.
As a matter of fact. Andy flung the rifle to his face and fired as
the butt touched his shoulder. The savage wilted in his tracks.
Nit-o-ké-man tore herself from his dying grasp and darted back into
the lodge.</p>

<p>Andy was down the slope of the talus running along the beach.
Faintly in his preoccupation he heard Joe's astonished ejaculation
behind him. Somehow he was across the log. Somehow he had reloaded
as he ran. Somehow he was yelling at the top of his voice. These
matters seemed to have nothing to do with himself.</p>

<p>His sudden appearance for a moment struck the turmoil flat.
Straight through the paralyzed Assiniboins he darted to the lodge
in which the Blackfoot woman had taken refuge; He had no chance to
look within. The Assiniboins recovered promptly from their first
surprise, Andy found himself beset. The foremost he killed with a
shot; then clubbed his rifle and laid about him. For a moment he
swept a space clear. An arrow thudded into his left shoulder. He
leaped backward with a roar so formidable that again his assailants
paused.</p>

<p>Andy faced them in the brief respite. His left arm was numb and
useless. He dropped his rifle to the ground, and his hand sought
the knife at his belt. The Assiniboins ringed him close, stooping
for a last rush. Andy saw them all clearly, individually. His mind,
back of the great excitement that sustained him, was working
clearly, coolly, in a strange hypnotic calm. The occasion pressed,
was a matter of split seconds; yet he seemed to have all eternity
for decision. Outside and beyond the ring of warriors and some
fifty feet or more distant stood a man apart. He too wore a cap of
white buckskin to which he had attached upright a pair of buffalo
horns. His face was painted black. He took no part in the fighting,
but watched.</p>

<p>Why he selected this man Andy could not have
told&mdash;certainly this Assiniboin was no immediate threat, as
were the others&mdash;but he swept back his arm in the long
overhand throw he had so often practised, and the knife flashed,
turning over and over, to bury itself hilt deep in the warrior's
neck.</p>

<p>A loud wail burst from the throats of Andy's assailants. One
leaped forward and struck Andy a glancing blow on the head. The
next instant they were swept aside by the rush of the Blackfeet.
Andy's clarity broke. He stood helpless and bewildered in mind. He
saw a confusion of struggling bodies. He caught a glimpse of Joe's
tall figure, of Kelly laying about him with a war-hawk. He heard
wild yells of triumph as the Assiniboins gave way, scattered
running in all directions. He was feeling giddy, a little sick.</p>

<p>Then Joe was pounding him on the back. The trapper was wildly
excited.</p>

<p>"Quit that; it hurts," protested Andy.</p>

<p>But Joe was with difficulty dissuaded.</p>

<p>"That's the quickest, fastest, longest shot I ever see mortal
man make with a rifle!" cried the trapper. "That's the longest,
straightest throw I ever see made with a knife! Boy, you do make
'em <i>come</i>!" He thrust a mass of hair and blood
enthusiastically into Andy's lap. "Thar's yore sculps; four on
'em," he exulted. "I took 'em fer ye!"</p>

<p>"Good lad," Kelly was saying quietly. "Killed their chief.
That's using your head."</p>

<p>Andy shuddered and thrust the scalps violently from him. The
world was very confused. He fainted away.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>When he came to, he found himself on a robe in the lodge's
interior. For a moment or so he stared at the smoke hole, unable to
figure out just where he was. The voice of Nit-o-ké-man oriented
him.</p>

<p>"He has ceased from dying," she cried joyously.</p>

<p>Andy turned his head. Though his mind was still strangely
confused, it was clearing; but as it cleared he became more and
more painfully aware of a throbbing shoulder and an aching head. He
saw Nit-o-ké-man kneeling at a cooking pot over the fire. Beyond
her sat Kiasax, and by him, bolt upright, stood the Little Warrior.
Kiasax's head was big with a bloody bandage.</p>

<p>"You have been dead a long time, my brother," said he. "I too
was dead,"&mdash;he touched his head&mdash;"but I have heard. Your
Sun-power is great but it cannot fill the whole of your heart. I
have no more words."</p>

<p>"What has happened?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"I do not know. I too have been dead," Kiasax repeated.</p>

<p>Andy listened. From the outside came no sounds save a thin low
wailing. He arose to his feet, steadied himself, went to the lodge
opening to look.</p>

<p>The camp was empty of men. The presence of the women was
attested only by the mourning from within the lodges whither they
had carried their dead. The slain and scalped Assiniboins lay as
they had fallen. The dogs prowled furtively among them. Overhead
wheeled ravens, materialized from nowhere at the summons of no one
knows what mysterious perception.</p>

<p>Andy cocked his ear to a faint clamor over the table-land. It
increased. Then around the end of the willow thicket swept a dozen
men on horseback. At their head rode Joe Crane. He was yelling at
the top of his voice. He brandished his rifle in one hand, waved a
handful of scalps in the other. The pony he bestrode ran recklessly
unguided; its ears flattened; its head extended; its nostrils wide.
The Indians at its heels were pressing him close, both in speed, in
excitement and in noise. After a brief interval came Kelly, jogging
soberly. He too had somehow reclaimed his rifle, which he carried
across his saddle. A larger number of Blackfeet afoot jogged
tirelessly alongside him.</p>

<p>The cavalcade swept the village like a whirlwind, plowed to a
stop. Joe was afoot. He rushed up to Andy, enveloped him in a
mighty bear hug, scalps, rifle, and all. Andy nearly fainted again
from the pain of his shoulder. He half hit, half shoved Joe so
mighty a buffet on the chest that the trapper's hold was torn loose
and he staggered back several paces. The Indians, who had also
dismounted, and were crowding close, laughed, delightedly at this
exhibition of strength.</p>

<p>"Layoff, you old idiot!" growled Andy. "I've got a hole in
me."</p>

<p>"Wagh, I forgot!" But Joe was unabashed. "Boy! That was a fight!
We made 'em come!" He slapped the nearest warrior so mightily on
the back as nearly to overset him. "Hey, old hoss?" He crow-hopped
in absurd caricature of the war dance; leaped in the air to crack
his heels together; crowed like a cock. The Blackfeet crowded
close, laughing, as much excited as he. Andy could get no sense out
of anybody.</p>

<p>Kelly had ridden up and dismounted. Small boys swarmed from the
lodges to hold the horses. Women followed them. The men who had
been running afoot joined the shouting, exulting mob milling
restlessly before the lodge door. Hands brandished scalps aloft. A
score of voices shouted, declaimed, chanted. The noise was
distracting. Yet somehow below it, through it, persisted the thin
low wailing of the hidden women mourning the dead.</p>

<p>Andy was suddenly invaded by a deadly weariness. He could make
nothing of it all, except that a victory had been won. Joe was
hopeless. His caperings had become a center about which a rough
impromptu dance of triumph was forming. The young man suddenly
abandoned it all with a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>But Kelly was at his elbow, cool, collected, smiling
faintly.</p>

<p>"Come inside, lad," he advised.</p>

<p>They entered the lodge and sat side by side on the robe. Kelly
recounted, accompanying his recital by a running translation of
sign talk for the benefit of the young Blackfoot.</p>

<p>Andy's knife throw had turned the tide of battle. The death of
their chief had cast the Assiniboins into a momentary confusion.
Before they could recover, the Black-feet had gained the upper
hand. Furthermore their plans had been wholly upset by a clever bit
of strategy. A small detachment of the Blackfeet had avoided the
fight to execute a swift movement in capture of the attacking
party's riding horses, which were being held convenient for the
retreat when the time was ripe. Kelly did not mention the fact that
this thought was his own. The raiders had to fight it out afoot,
which was no part of their original intention. The sudden injection
of the white men into the melee had upset all their calculations,
which, naturally, had not taken such a reinforcement into account,
Nor could they have foreseen the moral effect of that
reinforcement, with its deadly long rifles, which had been promptly
restored to their owners. In fact the whole of their strategy had
blown up. Such of them as survived had made their way to the willow
bottoms where they were being hunted down one by one. In the
meantime a sufficient band, mounted on the enemies' own ponies, had
followed the trail of the horses.</p>

<p>"They'll recapture them," said Kelly confidently. "You can't
drive loose horses very fast. They leave a plain trail, and there
can't be many men in charge of them."</p>

<p>The triumph had been complete. Kiasax's eyes glowed with
gratification, though he made no comment.</p>

<p>Nit-o-ké-man stood before them, smiling shyly, offering each a
wooden bowl filled with a savory stew of venison. Andy accepted it
eagerly. To his surprise he discovered himself to be suddenly very
hungry.</p>

<p>"This is something like!" he cried to his companion. "I'm
starved!"</p>

<p>But Kelly expressed a gratification over and above the mere
satisfaction of appetite.</p>

<p>"Better than you think," said he. "Once you have eaten in an
Indian lodge you are a guest; and a guest is sacred from hurt or
theft. I have known them to sleep in the snow outside while guests
occupy the lodge. This is the best news yet."</p>

<p>However that might be, Andy found the food most grateful.</p>

<p>"Well," said Kelly, after the bowls had been emptied, "we're
back again. We'd better collect that wild Indian of ours and get
back to the cabin. What next?"</p>

<p>But when Andy would have departed, Kiasax would have none of it.
Staggering weakly to his feet, his hands on Andy's shoulders, he
forced him gently back to the robe.</p>

<p>"No, my brother," said he. "You are now a dweller of this
lodge."</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>The pursuers returned bringing back the stolen horses. The camp
formalized to ceremony.</p>

<p>The fallen lodges had been erected again: The warriors
disappeared within, to emerge after a few minutes in their oldest
clothing. Their faces were painted black. They seated themselves in
two long lines facing each other, a wide space between. Under their
breath they hummed unceasingly a low and mournful chant. The three
white men were instructed to take places in one of these lines. A
youth appeared from the direction of the horse herd leading a white
pony. Its sides had been marked with designs in red. After a short
pause the old chief arose to his feet. By signs he instructed Andy
to mount the pony. An ancient squaw thrust into his hands a long
peeled staff from which dangled four tufts of hair. Obeying a
signal Andy held this aloft at arm's length.</p>

<p>The chief began a recital in a loud singsong voice. Andy could
not understand all that he said, but, he gathered that his exploits
were being recounted, one by one. As the chief's voice ceased, at
the end of each episode, drums tapped, the bearers of rattles shook
them in corroboration of the testimony. Thus four times, once for
each scalp. Then Andy dismounted, and resumed his plate.</p>

<p>"Countin' yore <i>coups,"</i> explained Joe. "Makes 'em
official-like."</p>

<p>Joe and Kelly had next their turn, followed by those of the
Blackfeet who had that day killed an enemy or taken a prisoner or
performed a deed noteworthy enough to be counted as a <i>coup.</i>
The ceremony was the same, except that each told of his own
feats.</p>

<p>When all had finished, the chief arose to his feet again.</p>

<p>He supplemented his speech by sign talk so that the white men
should understand.</p>

<p>"The will of the Sun is plain," said he. "When these came among
us our eyes were dim. We could not see. Now they are clear. We
looked upon these men as enemies, deceived by the color of their
skin. To-day they have fought for us. They are not our enemies.
Their hearts are the hearts of our people. They are our brothers.
Our hearts are theirs; our country is theirs. We are Blackfeet." He
washed his hands in a fire of sweet grass and drew his forefinger
across the forehead of each in turn. "I pronounce them Blackfeet."
He raised both hands over Andy's head, palms down, "I-tam-api shall
he be called," he said solemnly. "I-tam-api&mdash;Happiness. I have
no more words."</p>

<p>He sat down. All eyes were turned toward Andy. "Git up," urged
Joe under his breath. "Say somethin'."</p>

<p>Andy arose to his feet. His eyes were misted; he choked.</p>

<p>"O chief," he pronounced slowly in the Blackfoot language, "my
heart is lifted from the ground."</p>

<p>A low murmur of surprise and amazement arose. The chief raised
his arms.</p>

<p>"Great is thy power, O Sun!" he cried. "Thou hast given him also
our tongue!"</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>An old man shuffled into the center, holding aloft a peeled
white wand from which dangled tufts of hair. Drums tapped in broken
rhythm: a shrill squeaking pipe struck up a wandering minor air;
the rattle bearers shook their rattles. The scalp dance had begun:
and would continue for hours. Every able-bodied human being in the
village would take part&mdash;except the mourners for the dead.
Andy stopped to look down with pity on one of these women. Her
unbound hair had been sprinkled with ashes; she held her hands
before her. One of the fingers had been chopped off at the first
joint in token of grief. As he started on again he felt a touch at
his elbow.</p>

<p>Nit-o-ké-man was looking up at him eagerly.</p>

<p>"You come back, to our lodge, to stay?" she asked. Andy was
embarrassed. He had taken Kiasax's statement as figurative. He
translated and explained to his companions. Kelly was emphatic.</p>

<p>"Of course you must do so!" he insisted. "It would be an insult
to refuse!"</p>

<p>So Andy reassured the young woman, and she returned pleased to
the dance.</p>

<p>The three white men on reaching the cabin experienced a
wonderful surprise. Evidently during the performance of the
ceremonies someone had been very busy. A fresh fire burned. The
bales of beaver skins hung under the roof in the smoke. The
moccasins they had made in such numbers during the past winter had
been laid out in rows atop their own robes. They looked about them,
identifying one by one their simple belongings. Nothing was
missing&mdash;the traps, the tobacco&mdash;Joe pounced on this
eagerly&mdash;the powder and lead, the small store of trade goods,
even their discarded, patched, and shiny buckskins. The restitution
was complete; or nearly so. A few small items lacked, mostly from
the trade goods, and generally such "expendibles" as tobacco,
powder, or vermilion. But other things had been added, possibly in
payment&mdash;a beautifully beaded "possible" sack, moccasins
decorated with dyed quills, and the like. Andy's bed and his
personal belongings were missing.</p>

<p>"They've moved you to the young Blackfoot's lodge already,"
surmised Kelly.</p>

<p>Neatly arranged around the fire were a number of curious
contraptions. Short pieces of willow had been split halfway of
their length and cleft over other short pieces, clothespin-wise.
These puzzled them.</p>

<p>"Looks as if the children had been playing," Kelly surmised.</p>

<p>But Joe, who had picked one up, had an inspiration.</p>

<p>"Hosses!" he cried. He held the toy so that the cleft bit was
vertical; and, sure enough, it became a rough representation of a
man on horseback. "This means they've give' us back our
hosses!"</p>

<p>"Too many," said Kelly doubtfully; but in the event Joe proved
to be right, and the new members of the tribe found themselves the
owners of a score of ponies besides their own.</p>

<p>As dusk fell Andy returned to take his place in his new home.
The fire in the lodge was burning bright with buffalo fat. Kiasax
and Nit-o-ké-man awaited him. As he stooped beneath the entrance
flap they came forward to greet him. Each took a hand and led him
to a low wicker chair-back covered with a skin. When he had seated
himself Nit-o-ké-man handed him his filled pipe; held a coal to the
tobacco. She smiled shyly and directed his attention to a
beautifully decorated robe spread over a low bed frame.</p>

<p>"For you," said she.</p>

<p>One by one she touched with her forefinger various objects laid
out orderly across the robe&mdash;a suit of whitened buckskin heavy
with bead and quill work, moccasins solid with beads, a circlet of
white wolf tails atop a magnificent coronet of eagle's
feathers.</p>

<p>"For you," she said of each.</p>

<p>She laughed happily at Andy's expression. Her shyness was gone.
She was as eager as a child. Nothing would do but he must take off
his present garments, array himself in this gorgeous and ceremonial
costume. Andy demurred; then tried to make her understand that at
least she should leave him in privacy for the change. He shifted as
hastily and as modestly as possible. The embarrassment was all his.
Both Kiasax and Nit-o-ké-man were as unself-conscious as children,
exclaiming in astonishment at the whiteness of his skin where the
sun had not bronzed it. Then Nit-o-ké-man knelt before him and
painstakingly painted his face. Her lips were pouted prettily in
the absorption of her task; she held her sleek head critically
sideways, studying her effects. At length she was satisfied. Andy
arose to his feet. Kiasax carefully fitted to his head the eagle
crown. They stood back, laughing delightedly over his appearance.
Nit-o-ké-man handed him the long rifle. Kiasax signed him to
follow. The two young men left the lodge.</p>

<p>Andy found that he was in for a round of calls. First they
visited the lodge of the chief, whom Andy for the first time heard
named as Mat-o-suki. There they smoked. Abundant food was brought.
They ate. Everything was most dignified and ceremonious. Andy
enjoyed the experience. He felt that he must present a very fine
appearance.</p>

<p>From there they proceeded to the lodge of the next in
importance. More smoke. More food. Andy had eaten heartily of
Mat-o-suki's spread. But he was forced now to eat more; for Kiasax
gave him to understand that a refusal would be insulting. Another
lodge; still more smoke; still more food. After the fourth
repetition the situation became serious. Just about as he was
beginning to despair, Kiasax instructed him in a convention that
saved his life. In each lodge were other guests, men of lesser
importance. Andy learned that after the first taste, if he so
desired, he could present the nearest of these men with a small bit
of wood, whereupon the one so designated would, as his substitute,
empty his bowl for him. Next day Andy must redeem his tokens with
some small gift. In his present overstuffed condition he felt that
they would be cheap at the cost of all his possessions!</p>

<p>At last the ceremonial visits were over. The two young men
returned to their own lodge. Nit-o-ké-man arose at their
entrance.</p>

<p>"Ai-ee," she murmured. "My men have returned." She stood before
the white boy, looking up at hih. He towered over her, head and
shoulders, and the tall crown of eagles' feathers exaggerated his
height. Both she and Kiasax, somehow, seemed to find this
discrepancy funny. They commented on it, but so rapidly that Andy
could not quite catch the joke. But he joined delightedly in their
laughter. His heart expanded. A warmth enveloped him that was not
wholly due to the dim coziness of the lodge.</p>

<p>"I-tam-api," Nit-o-ké-man said softly, "I-tam-api. Is he not a
great warrior?" I-tam-api&mdash;Happiness! Andy was only just
twenty-one.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>Time flowed by with the swiftness of water after a thaw. Lo, it
was summer!</p>

<p>The white men had resumed their trapping, in which a certain
number of the Indians joined. There were streams enough and beaver
enough for everybody, This kept them pretty busy. However, they
found time to see a great deal of the Indian life; to take part in
it almost as fellow tribesmen. But the prime of the fur was over;
the spring hunt had finished. The Blackfeet must move north to the
summer council under what are now known as the Tetons: the whites
must get to the rendezvous if they were to determine the disposal
of their furs.</p>

<p>The necessity came as a bit of a shock to all concerned.
Somehow, each had, without thinking, taken for granted the other's
company. The white men told Mat-o-suki of Sublette's proposed
trading expedition, and urged him to lead his band to the
rendezvous to barter the Indians' spring catch, which was now
considerable. Mat-o-suki pointed out that his band was too small
for such a journey into the country of the Crows and the
Assiniboins.</p>

<p>In return he suggested that it was really not quite clubby for
the three new members of the Blackfeet to absent themselves from
the convention, under the Tetons&mdash;he wanted to show them off,
as was right and proper. Kelly pointed to the bales of fur, which,
must be disposed of. The chief suggested that to the west were other
white men, not so far away. The Blackfeet had nothing to do with
them; but the Flatheads traded there. These white men, said Kelly,
were King's men, enemies of the Americans. Mat-o-suki acknowledged
this; but wanted to know if the two older men could not do that
errand to rendezvous, leaving Andy with the tribe: After all, Andy
was the show piece. Andy vetoed this. He could not desert his
comrades.</p>

<p>"But," he added, "in the Leaves Will Fall Moon I shall come
back. I swear it, by the Sun!" He cast a glance at Kiasax, silent
and somber in the circle. "Shall I not seek my brother and my
sister? Shall I leave empty my place in my lodge?"</p>

<p>"Good!" said Mat-o-suki. "And our other children?"</p>

<p>Kelly nodded, saying nothing. But Joe laughed out loud.</p>

<p>"Me?" he cried, in English. "With all them beaver yere waitin'?
Jist try to keep me out! Besides," he added drolly, "ain't I jist
gittin' that little fat purty one to thinkin' I'm a heap big Injun?
You tell him to save her fer me, and I'll be here!"</p>

<p>Andy translated this. The men laughed. Even old Mat-o-suki's
grave countenance broke into a smile. The little fat pretty one,
who, with the other women, had been listening at a respectful
distance outside the circle, dove for the shelter of a near-by
lodge. The women cackled delightedly. Joe grinned at them all.</p>

<p>Two days later the encampment was broken up. For a time the
whites and Indians were to travel in company. It seemed there was,
farther to the north, a lower and easier pass to the east, The
lodges came down; the travoys were packed. Amid a confusion of
cries, laughter, the barking of dogs, the tribe moved up the
valley.</p>

<p>The first day's travel was in the happy-go-lucky,
go-as-you-please style incident to a country where no danger was
feared. The older men rode ahead in small groups, dismounted as the
fancy took them to sit and smoke. The younger men and the boys
swooped about the country at full speed, skylarking, dashing
regardless through the throng, stirring up trouble among the stray
horses and colts, pursued by shrill protests from the women. Dogs
ran after them, fought among themselves, dodged irate old squaws.
The long loose procession flowed along in a curiously eddying
current, stringing out, overtaking, coagulating, stringing out
again. The clamor was continuous. Only the three whites marched
their outfit with any coherent compactness, Kelly leading the
horses packed high with the beaver skins; Joe bringing up the rear;
Andy cruising about to head in any of the animals inclined to break
away; Over the low passes to the north they climbed, and so into
another and smaller valley.</p>

<p>Near the close of the afternoon Mat-o-suki stopped in the flat
of a stream. Slowly the others drew up to him. Here and there a
favorite squaw took her stand, holding aloft a lance as the
gathering point for the family. The new camp took form.</p>

<p>But the following morning this engaging informality was
abandoned. Camp was struck, the horses packed expeditiously. Then,
instead of setting out at once each was ready, the various families
and fraternities gathered in separate groups and stood waiting. The
men were all dressed in their best and most ceremonial
gorgeousness. Except for the barking of the dogs complete silence
reigned. Only at a signal from Mat-o-suki did they set forth. And
the manner of their riding was this:</p>

<p>In front of each group, and on its finest pony, rode proudly a
young girl in beautifully decorated buckskins. Against her right
stirrup she bore a thin pole, ten feet or more in length, its tip
decorated with brass trinkets, or a flashing mirror, or a gilt
ball, or perhaps a nosegay of bright flowers. Behind her rode the
head of the family or the clan, in full panoply, carrying his lance
and shield, Behind him, again, the women and children and packs.
The younger warriors brought up the rear, They rode in silence,
eyes front, looking neither to right nor left. At the end of an
hour Mat-o-suki stopped and faced his pony about. The tribe
gradually closed in back of him. When all had reached the place and
stopped, Mat-o-suki spoke.</p>

<p>"Here the trail divides," he declaimed in a voice loud enough to
be heard by all. "There is the pass to where the Sun comes
from,"&mdash;he pointed his lance. "My brothers have many horses,
many beaver. Yonder is the country of the Crows. But the Sun-power
of I-tam-api is strong. You will pass through the country of the
Crows. We, your brothers, will make medicine for you." He signed
certain young men in the background, who drove up a number of laden
horses. "Here are more beaver," he continued, "which my young men
have taken. Take them. Trade them for us; and in the Leaves Will
Fall Moon bring us that which the Americans will give."</p>

<p>This was surprising: and just a little disconcerting.</p>

<p>The three whites consulted hurriedly. Considerable
responsibility attached to such a commission.</p>

<p>"Look here," objected Kelly, "you'd better tell him there's more
than a chance we may not get through; that we may not get
back."</p>

<p>But Mat-o-suki waved this aside.</p>

<p>"That is the affair of the Sun," said he.</p>

<p>"All right, if he wants to take a chance," decided Kelly. "But
what does he want us to bring him?"</p>

<p>At Andy's translation a babel arose, presumably from the owners
of the skins. Even the women dared lift their voices in urgence of
their desires. Mat-o-suki silenced them by a lift of the hand.</p>

<p>"Bring guns and powder and lead and knives and tobacco," said
he, "and other things which our brothers will know."</p>

<p>"He's shore got a trustin' natur'," said Joe sardonically.
"Thar's many a plew in them bales. Yo' tell him that," he insisted.
"Tell him mebbe we won't come back a'ter all."</p>

<p>"If my brothers do not come we will paint our faces for the
dead," said Mat-o-suki, unmoved.</p>

<p><i>"Dog-gone!"</i> blustered Joe, when this was translated. "Yo'
tell him he's a tarnation trustin' old fool. No, needn't tell him
that. <i>Dog-gone!</i> Ef'n enybody'd told me I was goin' to like
an Injun like a white man I'd a-crawled his hump! An' yo' know what
you're a-doin', Andy, you tarnation little squirt you? Yo're makin'
me out a <i>trader."</i></p>

<p>"That's a rattling good notion, Joe," said Andy quietly. His
face was grave. Suddenly he seemed to have matured, to have taken
leadership He turned to Mat-o-suki with an air of authority. "We
will do these things," he told the chief. "And this also we will
do. In the Leaves Will Fall Moon we will bring the trade for this
beaver. And we will bring also other trade-beads, and paints, and
axes, and kettles, and fire steels and red cloths and blue
cloths"&mdash;a low murmur of admiration came from the attentive
women&mdash;"and many other things. Some of these will be 'on the
prairie' to show my heart is big for my brothers. Some I shall give
for the skins you will bring in. I have no more words."</p>

<p>He grinned at Joe as he translated. "So now you <i>are</i> a
trader!" said he.</p>

<p>"Dog-gone if I ain't!" cried Joe.</p>

<p>They gathered the laden animals and rode away. A chorus of
farewells followed them.</p>

<p>"Come back! You will come back, I-tam-api!" they pleaded.</p>

<p>Suddenly Joe wheeled his pony and dashed back.</p>

<p>He snatched the little fat pretty one from the ground, implanted
on her startled face a resounding smack, set her on her feet
again.</p>

<p>"So long, folks!" He waved a long arm in general. They toiled
slowly up the slope of the low pass. The Indians stood where they
had left them. From time to time Andy turned in his saddle, waved
his hand. They did not answer the signal. His last look, from the
<i>puerto suelo,</i> showed them motionless, still in the same
place.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>The three white men camped that night just over the summit on
the eastward slope. After supper Andy left the fire and climbed to
the saddle of the pass.</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous evening. The air was crisp with the chill of
altitude, but from time to time a wandering sweet warmth, astray
from the distant plains, touched him inquiringly and passed on. It
was the time of the rising moon. Already that luminary was above
the horizon. As the daylight drained away it took serene
possession.</p>

<p>Andy sat on a rock and fell into a reverie, his chin in his
hand. Past events plucked the sleeve of his musing for recognition.
Each required its own space of dignity, so that the multitude of
them made for themselves an imposing past that had no relation to
the calendar. He saw every detail of his first meeting with Joe
Crane in the woodland glade, but he saw it microscopic, small,
dwindled by the immense distance of experienced time. Yet he had
left the Pennsylvania farm only a little over a year ago! It seemed
impossible. It seemed impossible too that the raw lad he recalled
himself could be the same as him who was now sitting the summits of
the Rockies, of a moonlight night.</p>

<p>From this vantage point he could look both ways. To the eastward
were the foothills and the prairies and the great rivers of the
plains. He looked across them with his mind's eye, leaping in
imagination to the seaboard, then following back again. To him the
white man's civilization seemed at that moment like a flood dammed
back by the wilderness, waiting to overflow and take possession.
Finger-like its first small trickles were feeling their way, like
leakages, into the country prepared.</p>

<p>He turned his eyes from the moon-bathed east to the shadowed
west, and at once his spirit stirred. Those tumbled ranges held in
their folds and recesses something that the groping fingers had
banished from the plains. It called him powerfully. The Unknown!
There was his land, there the obscure destiny of his blood and
breeding called him. For a moment he gave himself up to his
dream.</p>

<p>But his mind, tugging insistently, drew him back to what it
pronounced its reality, calling upon him to face facts as they
were. He could not deny the logic of his mind. His way must lead,
not through the dream, but through the reality. By a distinct
effort of the will he recalled a picture that had faded. It was of
a little old lady, in a Boston rocker, by the open window of a
Pennsylvania farmhouse. She was awaiting, she had been awaiting,
patiently his return. Thither led his way. At the thought of her a
gush of affection welled up in Andy's heart. Yet, disconcertingly,
into the serenity of the night jangled a dissonance; sweet bells
out of tune. Andy was disturbed. He mentally castigated himself for
his disturbance.</p>

<p>And then a curious and beautiful thing happened. Over the little
troubled surface of his uneasiness the spell of moonlight poured,
mystic, wonderful. Andy seemed to himself to be holding very still
in a stillness that was not merely of the body, but of the mind and
soul as well. And this stillness released in him strange quiet
powers of perception. Things presented themselves and stood before
him serene for his contemplation, and quietly withdrew. He saw them
in their significances.</p>

<p>The first of these things that presented themselves was a sure
conviction that the picture he had evoked was no true picture: that
no little old lady sat now in the Boston rocker by the open window
of the Pennsylvania farmhouse. His grandmother was dead. Andy was
as certain of this as if he had learned of it by a sure messenger.
The certainty held itself before him until the first sharp shock of
recognition had given way to the flow of a strange and exalted
peace, as the acceptance of something grateful to her and desirable
and long desired, whose exaltation he must share. Then it faded and
a flood of love bathed him. He was surrounded by it, permeated by
it, uplifted by it, transformed by it as the soft moonlight
transformed the world at his feet. His spirit soared in an eager
uprush of response. It lifted him for a brief moment or so into
what seemed to him a personal communion. The terms of that
communion were very simple, an abstraction almost, the essence of
two things: a deep and satisfying approval: a mighty uplifting
inspiration to a destiny foreordained. It filled him as breath
fills the lungs, flowing to him as a great wind from sources
mysterious but not quite unknown. For at the same time the third
conviction came to him; but rather an impression than a conviction;
of his grandmother; and, more faintly, aloof in the background as
it were, of old Gail Burnett&mdash;perhaps of Boone himself.</p>

<p>It was tremendous, but mercifully brief, for the content of it
was too great for long human endurance. It lost strength, drained
away. Andy awakened to his normal self slowly as one coming to
consciousness. He looked about him still a little dazed. The
mountains had become mountains again. The rock on which he sat was
a piece of granite. The air was cold. Somehow he was not surprised
to look up at Joe Crane, standing at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Wall!" observed Joe. "What do you think yo're a doin' up
yere&mdash;mountain man?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-0" id="ch2-0"></a>PART 2. Mountain Men</h2>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-1" id="ch2-1"></a>CHAPTER 1. Council</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>By 1823 and 1824 the fur trade west of the Mississippi was
balancing in unstable equilibrium. The old order was changing; and
a great many people who were accustomed to it were disgruntled.
Others approved.</p>

<p>Andy Burnett, carrying his grandfather's long rifle from a
Pennsylvania farm, happened to his mountain experience just at the
moment. In order to understand, it will be necessary to review a
bit of history, to picture a situation. But that is no great task:
nothing west of the Mississippi was dull in those stirring
days.</p>

<p>Up to the time of Andy's first sight of the Rockies, the
situation was very simple. The lower Missouri and its tributaries
were traded and trapped in some sort of organized fashion by
companies formed for the purpose. The earliest of them had been
Manuel Lisa, the Spanish-American, who had built the first posts,
and had died in 1820, leaving behind him a reputation for square
dealing and irascibility. In its latter years his enterprise had
been known as the Missouri Fur Company. He was succeeded by
Pilcher, a man of sufficient enterprise to push back as far as the
mouth of the Big Horn River, where he built his outpost fort. By
1822 he is said to have had three hundred men on the upper rivers.
Some of these were trappers, some were executives and clerks and
<i>engages</i> in the various posts, some were in charge of
transport, some were traders whose business it was to search out
the Indian encampments. The Trade was well organized; and busy; and
profitable. It was also exciting, and passably dangerous. Whiskey,
or what was called such, was a big item in the barter; and a
disturbing one. Because of it, and for many other inevitable
reasons, matters were always aboil. There was on the part of the
Indian tribes drunkenness and treachery and surprise attack and
thieving raids and all the rest of it; as also hospitality and
welcome and friendliness. The trouble was that no man knew which to
expect. The Arickarees were the most uncertain. The village that
one day would hail the trader's keel boat with delight would attack
it viciously the next; and with no known reason. The Mandans were
steadiest; but no lone white traveler ever felt quite at ease, even
with the Mandans. Therefore great pains were taken never to become
a lone traveler. The annual supply expeditions from St. Louis were
well armed and strongly manned. The posts were of stout
construction. They conducted their affairs circumspectly after a
safety-first routine; admitting but a few customers at a time;
obtaining their meat and wood and such necessities guardedly. Those
whose business led them far afield&mdash;the trappers and the
itinerant traders&mdash;went in companies. These bands were not
numerous enough to defend themselves against determined hostility,
but were sufficient to discourage wanton aggression when determined
hostility lacked. For it must be understood that as yet the plains
Indians were not concertedly inimical.</p>

<p>And far over the western and northern horizons, similarly, the
great British Company carried on its trade. It had united with the
Nor'westers; it had crowded out Astor.</p>

<p>But these conditions obtained only on the outskirts, as it were.
Within their wide thin encirclement lay the vast and unknown area
described as the Great American Desert. Unknown save to a handful
of daring men who annually disappeared into its mysteries, and
annually returned bearing rich furs and tall stories. They were the
mountain men.</p>

<p>Where they went nobody knew but themselves. What dangers they
ran, what countries they traversed, what peoples they encountered
could only be guessed by the disappearance of familiar faces. Their
numbers were sparingly recruited from the ranks of the most
adventurous. They were trappers, not traders.</p>

<p>Indeed they entertained, at this time, a profound contempt for
and distrust of traders. They preferred to make the long and
difficult journey to St. Louis in order to dispose of their catch,
rather than seek the nearer posts. They were bitterly jealous of
invasion, and eyed with suspicion any symptoms of extension toward
the mountains.</p>

<p>In general they lived at peace with the tribes. Too few in
numbers to arouse suspicion of encroachment their presence was
viewed by the Indians with a certain toleration. At worst they were
in danger only from stray marauding bands, always willing to pick
up easy scalps or plunder. At best, they took Indian women and
moved freely within certain districts, almost as members of the
tribes. In any case there was no general hostility to them as white
men and interlopers. Nevertheless their existence was precarious
enough to develop in them a wariness and craft and independence
that made of them a class apart.</p>

<p>Such was the equilibrium which was now to be disturbed. It was
evident that the monopolistic isolation of these few could persist
only as long as the lower country was undepleted. But as the beaver
there became scarcer the organized trade was bound to go farther
afield.</p>

<p>The mountain men felt this, but did not understand its
inevitability. They resented the portent of invasion. They were
restless before the shadow of its threat.</p>

<p>What might have come of it in the way of opposition, complicated
by the influence of the trappers over the mountain tribes it would
be difficult to say. But at this moment the Trade took a new turn.
General Ashley organized a brand-new expedition for the purpose of
trading, and traffic, not in the zealously guarded Rockies of the
mountain men, but in the comparatively virgin country just to the
east; Sublette, himself a mountain man to a certain extent, was
diplomat enough to make plain that he intended no encroachment. The
trappers under his command would confine their activities to the
upper waters of the Missouri. And the mountain man would be able to
sell his furs and obtain his supplies, practically at St. Louis
prices, at the expense of a journey, not of several thousand, but
of a few hundred miles only. The mountain man was in some respects
a simple creature, swayed by his emotional prejudices. The personal
element bulked large in his psychology. He knew and liked General
Ashley. Ashley's head men, such as Sublette, Henry, and
Fitzpatrick, were of their ilk, of themselves rather than of the
hated professional trader class.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Andy Burnett reined in his mount below the skyline and advanced
afoot. At the summit he drew a wolfskin over his cap, and slowly
thrust his head above the ridge. A hundred paces or so below, the
small cavalcade awaited the results of his inspection, the mounted
men sitting their horses idly, the laden pack animals improving the
opportunity to crop at the short alpine grasses. It was well to
exercise caution. The pack horses carried a rich take of beaver
skins; the men were but four, an easy prize for wandering Crows or
Assiniboins.</p>

<p>For some minutes the young man's eyes swept the prospect below
him, then focused to a detail. After a moment he signaled his
companions. They dismounted and joined him. All four scrutinized
the distant object of his attraction.</p>

<p>"White man," pronounced the young Indian at last in the
Blackfoot tongue.</p>

<p>The others made no comment.</p>

<p>Then at last Joe Crane arose to his feet.</p>

<p>"He's right," he muttered in English. "That boy's shore got good
eyes."</p>

<p>"How do you know, Kiasax?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>But Joe answered, rather impatiently.</p>

<p>"Legs hang down straight. Never saw these Injuns ride long
stirruped."</p>

<p>They remounted and boldly crossed the skyline. The distant
figure had come to a doubtful stop. Andy drew to one side and
wheeled his mount back and forth in the friendship signal. Then
they descended the slope.</p>

<p>The three white men and the young Indian approached the stranger
steadily and observantly, saying nothing. The man awaited them in
stolid silence. He sat one horse and led another. The beasts were
sleek and well rounded, for the new grass was strong; but their
tails and manes were curiously ragged and short, the tails
especially gnawed to the very stumps.</p>

<p>"Hard doin's thar!" Joe Crane muttered to Andy. "Starvin' times!"</p>

<p>The rider, however, was thin to the point of an emaciation which
his long hair and beard only partially concealed. He was clad in a
strange mixture of buckskin and cloth, the former blackened and
shiny with wear, the latter ragged to the point of disintegration.
But these clothes he sat in, and the saddle he sat upon, and the
two horses were apparently his whole possessions. He carried no
rifle, no robes, no utensils, no supplies or equipment of any
kind.</p>

<p>"Good-mornin'," greeted Joe as they rode up. "How are ye?
Stranger yereabouts, eh? Got ary meat? Well, we got a hind quarter
of <i>cimmaron.</i> Come along, camp with us, and eat and talk
awhile."</p>

<p>The stranger croaked in his throat like a raven. His eye was
wild and unsettled. As though he considered the croak sufficient,
or perhaps because he found his voice too rusty from disuse, he
made no other response. He wheeled and joined the march.</p>

<p>All the rest of that day they rode together in an apparently
incurious silence which the varied activities of an extreme
vigilance were not quite sufficient to explain. The main body
plodded along slowly at a methodical two, miles-an-hour gait. But
always two, and sometimes three, of the travelers were circling far
afield, urging their ponies at the swiftest gait possible,
rummaging the pockets and folds of the hills, scrambling to the top
of commanding elevations for long looks abroad, searching the earth
for signs wherever its rocky surface softened. When the ponies
tired, fresh ones were saddled from the little bunch that trotted
about among the sturdier pack horses. When these outriders returned
to the main body, or their circles crossed afield, they exchanged
terse tense comment on the immediate business in hand, which was to
get safely through an alien land. They had no leisure of mind for
extraneous chatter. That must wait. This was serious business. They
paid no attention to the visitor; who, on his part, paid no
attention to them, but rode dully, all watchfulness now relaxed,
his chin sunk in his long beard.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the afternoon Kelly, who was ahead, stopped
short, dismounted. The others converged on him as rapidly as
possible. He had come upon horse tracks.</p>

<p>The ground was hard and flint-like. They could make nothing of
them. But while they were bent in examination they were jerked
upright by the sound of the shrill Arapahoe war whoop. Around the
curve or a butte a mile away charged a half-dozen horsemen.</p>

<p>Instantly the practised mountain men leaped to their
preparations for defense; seizing the rawhide ropes wound about the
horses' necks, with them tying the animals closely nose to nose, in
threes and fours, so they could not run away. Rapidly, but without
flurry, they bent themselves to the task. The job was insistent on
their attention. They did not spare a second glance toward the
attacking party. This came first. The stranger was as active as the
others; and when the last horse had been secured, without direction
he gathered the ends of all the ropes together.</p>

<p>"That shines!" Joe approved him, as he leaped to his post
outside the circle.</p>

<p>So quickly and coolly had this maneuver been executed that the
speeding horsemen had covered no more than half the intervening
distance.</p>

<p>"Why, there are only six of them!" cried Andy.</p>

<p>"Must be a big party somewhere in back, watch out," said
Kelly.</p>

<p>The riders were bending low behind their ponies' head. Straight
on they came. Joe Crane was getting restive.</p>

<p>"They's gittin' purty far from home and mother!" he muttered.
"Ef'n they come clost enough let's pot the lot. We got plenty time
to load afore the main gang can git to us. No use to hold our
fire."</p>

<p>Kelly was puzzled. This performance was contrary to all tenets
of Indian warfare. There must be some trick, new even to his long
experience.</p>

<p>"Better go slow," he advised; then amended his idea, "You and
Andy can fire. Kiasax and I will hold back."</p>

<p>But at this moment the riders straightened in their saddles, and
discharged their guns straight up into the air. This is the most
obvious of the many conventions of peace; for it is evident that an
empty gun is harmless.</p>

<p>And with the discharge came a roar of hearty laughter. The
Arapahoes were seen to be white men, who now trotted to the group
and dismounted hilariously.</p>

<p>"You tarnation idjits," growled Joe, "yo're a-goin' to git yore
fool heads shot off ef'n you keep on with sich monkeyshines. Me and
Andy was jist about to cut loose, and ef'n we had&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the boisterous newcomers refused to be impressed.</p>

<p>They slapped backs and shouted gleefully over their reckless
joke.</p>

<p>"Come on! Turn loose yore horses, you Injin fighters. We got
meat and water. Whar ye headed? Sublette's outfit? So are we!
Wharabouts you expect to diskiver him? Got ary likker?"</p>

<p>"Whar in tarnation you expect we'd git ary likker?" Joe was
disgusted.</p>

<p>"Wall, yo' got Injins and a prisoner, by the look of him, and
hosses and sich like nat'ral curiosities. No harm askin'. How's
yore ketch?"</p>

<p>"Kain't you see? You got eyes." Joe was still grumpy,</p>

<p>"Efn them's all beaver," said the other.</p>

<p>"They are," replied Joe shortly. He unbent a little. "Whar you
been trappin', and whar did you winter?"</p>

<p>"Same as usual. Got to hunt us a new hole next season. Gittin'
caught out. I s'pose you been with yore pet Blackfeet." A tinge of
envy crept into his voice. "Lord! I'd like to have yore luck!"</p>

<p>"Try it," said Joe.</p>

<p>"Not me! I like my ha'r right what she's a-growin'! No Blackfeet
in mine!"</p>

<p>The word seemed to arouse the stranger from the lethargy into
which he had fallen.</p>

<p>"Damn Blackfeet to hell!" he croaked rustily, but with
surprising energy.</p>

<p>"Hullo. Got a voice, eh, old timer!" exclaimed Joe.</p>

<p>Both men looked at the emaciated scarecrow curiously. "What
about Blackfeet?"</p>

<p>But the stranger had retreated again into dull silence, nor did
repeated effort elicit another word.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The trappers' camp had been cunningly chosen for concealment and
protection. The newcomers' horses were unpacked and unsaddled, and
turned out to graze with the others. There was a great deal of
chatter, a rapid interchange of news: the Arapahoes were said to
have found buffalo this year in the Bull Pen; the Snakes had
starved on roots, and were dangerous; there was little game in the
mountains, for some reason, except up towards the Yellowstone; the
grass on the Bow was dry and scarce; nothing but bull beef near
Belle Fourche, so they say. Two of the six men knew Andy, had been
with the original Taos party. He had not seen them since then. He
had to confirm and expand and correct the rumors as to his
miraculous favoritism by the dreaded Blackfeet. They listened to
him eagerly, commenting only by an occasional throat-scraping
"Wagh!" Their eyes shone at his description of what every mountain
man dreamed of, a virgin beaver country, untouched, untrapped. They
frankly envied him and his companions; and said so. How about the
country farther west? South of the Columbia? Some said there were
good trapping streams there too. Some said there was nothing but
desert. How about the Injins down there? Suppose there were good
beaver streams; how you going to get your fur out? Nobody really
knew. Jist have to go see sometime. Mebbe next year...</p>

<p>Andy's eye fell on the stranger. He sat against a rock&mdash;collapsed,
his dull eyes looking straight ahead. Andy sprang to his
feet, snatched from the fire a ramrod on which half-cooked meat was
roasting. His heart reproached him. In the excitement he, and all
the others, had forgotten.</p>

<p>For a moment the man seemed sunk and unaware.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, ravenously he seized the ramrod. He stuffed the
meat into his mouth in great chunks, swallowed it choking,
half-chewed. He uttered eager animal-like noises. Gradually the
talk fell. The attention of all men turned to him. He was oblivious
of them, wholly and greedily occupied.</p>

<p>"Better call a halt," someone advised at last. "He'll done kill
hisself."</p>

<p>Kelly took the ramrod, still half full. He had to use
considerable force. The man clung to it, objecting with strange
inarticulate noises. Suddenly he relinquished it and fell back
against the rock. He looked about him as though just awakening.</p>

<p>"Someone got any tobacco?" he muttered.</p>

<p>He puffed at the pipe, his eyes half closed. As he showed no
present indications of confidence, attention fell away from him.
These men would not ask questions. They returned to their own
affairs. Always the talk veered, from whatever the subject, back
toward the mysteries of the beyond. Merritt said there was a river
flowing into the Pacific Ocean, that cut through the high Sierra.
It must rise somewhere to the south and west. He even knew the name
of it, the Buenaventura. Now if a man could just strike the
headwaters of that river and follow it down&mdash;</p>

<p>"They's no sich river," interrupted Halsey positively. "If there
had been the Spanish would have follered her <i>up</i> from
Californy. That stands to reason."</p>

<p>"Mout be rough whar she heads through the Sierra."</p>

<p>They proffered equably the pros and cons. The argument melted
into vagueness. Only way to do would be to go see. Perhaps they
might some day. If there were such a river there should be
beaver...</p>

<p>"Wall, how about this yere big salt sea they talk about out
beyond the Utes?" challenged Merritt again. "What you think of
that?"</p>

<p>That was nearer, or was supposed to be. This discussion was more
animated.</p>

<p>"Ask yore Blackfoot, Andy," suggested Merritt at last. "Mebbe he
knows something about it."</p>

<p>A sudden stir returned their attention to the stranger.</p>

<p>His eyes were open and blazing, staring at Kiasax.</p>

<p>"Is that Injin a Blackfoot?" he croaked in his hoarse voice.
Without waiting for a reply he leaped to his feet and cast himself
blindly at the young Indian's throat. Kiasax, almost caught
unawares, nevertheless slipped sidewise like an eel, seized the
stranger's wrist, whipped it behind the man's back, and so held him
immobile in a grip against which struggle was useless. But indeed
of struggle there was little. The sudden burst of energy had
exhausted the stranger's feeble strength. After a moment Kiasax
relaxed his grip. The man sank to earth like a filled sack. Kiasax
looked down at him for an instant in lofty scorn, then quietly
resumed his place.</p>

<p>The men looked at one another. Finally Joe Crane spoke up.</p>

<p>"Look yere, stranger," said he authoritatively. "Yo've had a
full belly and a smoke and a sit down, and that's enough for ary
mountain man to find his tongue. If so be yo're a mountain man," he
added. "What happened to ye? And whar yo' hail from? And how come
you got no rifle nor possibles? And what for you try to climb the
hump of one of the party that picks you up, Injun or no Injun,
Blackfoot or no Blackfoot? 'Bout time, seems to me, you declar'
yoreself!"</p>

<p>A murmur of assent ran about the little circle. The stranger
collected himself, with a visible effort. "If you'd a-been-through
what I've been through, you'd do the same," he half apologized in
his hoarse voice.</p>

<p>"We're listenin'," said Joe Crane.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>The party of which this man was one, it seemed, had circled into
the Blackfoot country farther north. For some months they had
trapped with considerable success without encountering any Indians.
Then one day the Blackfeet appeared. They visited the trappers'
camp; seemed friendly.</p>

<p>"There was only twenty-eight of them," said the stranger. "I
counted them."</p>

<p>"Was there ary women? How were they painted? Never mind: go on,"
said Joe.</p>

<p>They had left, still professing friendship. But for some reason
the white leader, whose name was Immel, was uneasy. He insisted
that camp be broken. They set out in some haste down the
Yellowstone. Nothing more was seen of Indians. Some of the men
grumbled at leaving so early such good trapping grounds. But Immel
had authority; he and a man named Jones. Then, just as they thought
themselves safely away, they were ambushed in a rocky gorge.</p>

<p>"So narrow we could only go single file," explained the
stranger.</p>

<p>Some one spat contemptuously.</p>

<p>"It was the only way through," insisted the narrator, "and
Gordon&mdash;he was our hunter, and he was huntin' ahead for
meat&mdash;he went through ahead of us all right. We saw him."</p>

<p>"Sure, they <i>let</i> him through; to toll you on!" remarked
Kelly.</p>

<p>The attentive mountain men grunted agreement. But even
then&mdash;only twenty-eight Indians&mdash;how many in the white
party? Twenty-nine? Any white man should lick ten Injins!</p>

<p>"They was hundreds of Injins; thousands," asserted the stranger
earnestly.</p>

<p>Kiasax grunted. They turned toward him.</p>

<p>"You know about this, Kiasax?" Andy asked him in Blackfoot.</p>

<p>"These white men were in the country of my people," replied the
young Indian. "They shot the game and caught the beaver. The game
and the beaver belong to my people."</p>

<p>It seemed that he had accurate knowledge of the whole affair.
The first small band had made haste back to the main tribe, had
collected some four hundred warriors, had patiently trailed the
white party down the Yellowstone to the favorable spot for an
ambush.</p>

<p>"We killed the two chiefs," said Kiasax calmly, "and five more;
and wounded four. These and the other white man made a raft and
crossed the river. But we took all their horses and their traps and
their beaver. We did not know of this man. White men must keep out
of our country. We will kill them."</p>

<p>"We are white men," Andy pointed out. But Kiasax shook his
head.</p>

<p>"You three are Blackfeet," said he obstinately.</p>

<p>"H'm," observed Andy. "He has heard something about it," he told
the others. Andy did not consider it wise to elaborate.</p>

<p>The narrator, who had fallen behind the main body, doubled back
and escaped. He had lost his outfit in swimming the river. Since
then he had subsisted as best he could. They questioned him. Why
had he not gone straight on downstream to Fort Benton? He feared
the Indians. Attempting a roundabout route to the same end, he had
lost himself in the mountains. The trappers considered gravely.
From their point of view it was a curious tale, for no one of them
but could have better extricated himself. But one explanation could
be valid. However accustomed to or skilled in a trapper's life he
might be, this was no mountain man. Their silent deliberation moved
logically to the next conclusion.</p>

<p>"Look yere, stranger," Joe voiced it bluntly. "Yo're no free
trapper. Who you workin' fur?"</p>

<p>"I'm a Missouri Fur Company man," stated the other simply.</p>

<p>A dead silence followed this admission. The men looked at one
another.</p>

<p>"Now look yere, stranger," Joe spoke up after an interval,
"yo've had hard doin's, and I don't aim to rub salt in sores; but
don't you know you were gittin' out of yore territory? Don't you
know this yere is our kentry, that we done found and explored and
we don't look kindly on no outsiders?"</p>

<p>"I don't know nothin'," returned the company man stoutly. "I
jest go whar my partisan tells me."</p>

<p>"I expect that's right," agreed Joe dryly, and with a slight
contempt. "Wall, we kain't turn no white man adrift. We're goin'
over Belle Fourche way lookin' for Sublette. When we git thar you
kin go on back to yore boss. And you might kind of tell him, next
time he wants to send yo' out to the mountains, that they ain't so
good. That right, boys?"</p>

<p>The others nodded a somber assent. Only Kelly seemed to find
some humor in the situation.</p>

<p>"That's exactly, word for word, what Kiasax, on behalf of the
Blackfeet, would tell these others." he remarked privately to Andy,
as the conference broke up.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Sublette was not at Belle Fourche, nor was there any sign of the
promised fort. A small group of trappers were already on the spot
awaiting him. The situation was most unsatisfactory. It was now too
late to begin the long difficult journey to St. Louis; at least
with any expectation of returning that season. The men were
burdened with many skins; they lacked, and must have, the essential
supplies. The next nearest point where such could be procured was
at Fort Benton, near the mouth of the Big Horn River. To trade
there, the outpost of the Missouri Fur Company, whose constant
encroachments and persistent advances the free trappers so
resented, was like bitter medicine. But what else? A man must have
powder and ball and tobacco and a few "possibles." To say nothing
of a "good time." So they took up their march.</p>

<p>They were now strong enough in numbers to proceed boldly and
comfortably, with only the ordinary precautions. Kiasax, the young
Blackfoot, would go no farther. Already he was too deep into the
country of his tribe's hereditary enemies. So he cut out his
ponies, and took his outfit and turned back, quite alone, but
entirely confident. The tribe's skins he turned over to Andy
Burnett to trade for him, as he had done the year before.</p>

<p>"You will find us, I-tam-api, by the Lake of Bright Stones in
the Berries Ripe Moon."</p>

<p>Some of the men were inclined to grumble resentfully over the
failure to establish the promised fort. But most took it
philosophically. They knew Ashley; they knew Sublette. No blame
probably attached: but they were uneasy lest something had happened
to throw the whole enterprise overboard. In that case, what? Resume
the long journeys to St. Louis? Or trade with the "enemy"? They
argued the point, on theory; and some of the arguments became quite
heated. Especially Joe Crane and a red-headed giant named Tilton
stirred up bad blood that already existed between them. At the
beginning they were not widely apart in actual opinion. But Tilton
happened to make a careless and harmless remark to the effect that
if Ashley wanted the trade he'd better be on the spot or he'd lose
any chance he might have had to establish himself. Joe caught this
up and extended it by implication to hint at disloyalty. Tilton,
who really did not care much either way, was forced to the opposite
side by sheer contrariness. Shortly Joe became a "renegade
Blackfoot" and Tilton a "company spy," with an adjournment to the
prairie imminent. But Kelly and Merritt intervened.</p>

<p>"You're ridiculous, both of you," said Kelly. "You neither of
you know one thing about it. Anything may have happened. A
ten-year-old child would suspend judgment until he found out. I'm
ashamed of both of you, going off half-cocked like this."</p>

<p>Neither took admonition gracefully; but Kelly had the authority
of prestige among these men; and Merritt's slow-moving taciturnity,
when definitely ranged, was formidable. Nevertheless the quarrel
smoldered, and was likely to culminate in sudden violence at any
chance. Joe was stubborn to Kelly's private reasoning.</p>

<p>"I don't aim to be trompled by no red-headed woodpeckers," said
he.</p>

<p>But the next afternoon a lone horseman came into sight riding
across the prairie.</p>

<p>"It's Fitzpatrick, he allus rides humped over like that," a
keen-eyed trapper identified him. "What for he wants to lose his
ha'r ridin' around in the open that-away?"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about Fitz," said Halsey. "When he rides in the
open, they ain't but jist one reason; they ain't no Injins in fifty
mile. That old coot kin smell 'em furtherer than an eagle kin
see."</p>

<p>The lone rider rode up leisurely to the halted party, reined in
his horse, threw one leg across the pommel of his saddle, squirted
a stream of tobacco juice at a passing beetle.</p>

<p>"Howdy, boys," he drawled. "Where away you bound?"</p>

<p>"How are you, Bad Hand," said Kelly, giving the man's Indian
name. "We're angling over to Fort Benton. Looked for Sublette at
Belle Fourche, but he's not there. Where <i>you</i> bound?"</p>

<p>"Lookin' fur you boys," replied Fitzpatrick placidly. "Figgered
you might be goin' Benton way. Aimed to cut yore trail." He
squinted at the sun. "Let's jist camp and talk it over."</p>

<p>"Where's Sublette?" called Halsey.</p>

<p>But Fitzpatrick did not reply. He turned his horse's head and
led the way to the left where a thin fringe of stunted junipers
marked a break in the plains, a queer figure, his knees high from
shortened stirrups, the tail from his wolfskin cap wagging
rhythmically to the stepping of his horse, his long rifle in its
fringed case cross-wise before him, a buffalo ham tied to his
cantle bumping against his thigh. Nor would he vouchsafe a further
word; so that the men at length ceased to question him.</p>

<p>Only when camp had been made, the meat roasted and eaten, the
horses grazed and secured, the pipes lighted, did he condescend in
his own due time to break silence.</p>

<p>"You boys better not go to Fort Benton," then said he. "Yo'
better stick to yore own folks."</p>

<p>"Well, we want to, Fitz," rejoined Kelly, "but where are they?
We've got to trade somewhere. Where's Sublette? Where's
Ashley?"</p>

<p>"Over yander." Fitzpatrick waved his pipe stem vaguely toward
the east.</p>

<p>"What they doing there? How far? What's it all about?"</p>

<p>Deliberately, with aggravating indirection, Fitzpatrick at
length gave his news.</p>

<p>Trouble. The keel boats of Ashley's second expedition had fallen
into difficulties from the start. Big fight with the Arickarees.
Lost a lot of men, a lot of horses; a lot of goods. Delay and loss
all along the line. Nevertheless Henry, with eighty men, had pushed
on to the mouth of the Yellowstone. There he also had been
attacked. Lost four men and twenty-two horses. He had begun a post,
but this reverse decided him to abandon the post and push on up the
Yellowstone. Near the mouth of Powder River he had come upon the
Crows and had bought more horses. Sent Provost and a few men over
the Rockies to see what they could see. Hadn't heard from them yet.
Henry was still up in that country searching for a site for a post.
The main expedition was on the River.</p>

<p>"Better let me take you thar," drawled Fitzpatrick. "It ain't so
much fartherer than Fort Benton." He cast an appraising eye at the
packs piled about. "Good ketch, boys."</p>

<p>But, it developed, the great bulk of Ashley's trade goods had
been lost. Quite frankly, from them he could not pay in full for
the furs.</p>

<p>"We kin let you have a plenty of powder and lead, and tobacco,"
drawled Fitzpatrick in his detached manner, "and mebbe a few
possibles yere and thar. 'Nuff and more to git on with for another
winter. Next season we'll bring yo' back full vally of yore
furs."</p>

<p>"Mebbe we won't be yere next season," spoke up someone.</p>

<p>"The old man ain't licked, yit; not if you boys stand by him,"
proceeded Fitzpatrick, paying no attention to this remark.</p>

<p>"How about Indian trade?" spoke up Andy, thinking of his
consignment from Kiasax. "Kettles and blankets and knives and
vermilion and such?"</p>

<p>"Purty well cleaned," confessed Fitzpatrick, after a deliberate
inspection of this youngest member.</p>

<p>A dead silence fell. Fitzpatrick smoked calmly. The situation
was confusing, dismaying; the choice difficult.</p>

<p>On the one hand, only a vaguely sensed and not yet developed
threat to these men's independence from the fur companies; an
equally vague and undeveloped loyalty to an enterprise still
amorphous; a demand for a sale on sheer credit, a procedure utterly
foreign to their type of thought; a gamble on the integrity, the
solvency, the ability, and above all the tenacity of men personally
known to few. On the other hand a sure and certain trade; the bird
in the hand.</p>

<p>"Ary likker?" someone broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Some," said Fitzpatrick. "A few here's-hows, but no
drunks."</p>

<p>He arose, knocking the ashes from his pipe.</p>

<p>"Wall, thar ye be!" said he, and ambled away to his saddle
robes, spread out as a bed.</p>

<p>The ensuing discussion began calmly enough, but soon grew
heated. It was a hard thing to ask: to wait a year on an
off-chance; to trust the entire proceeds of a harsh and grinding
toil to a vague and indefinite future; above all to forgo that
season of profligate and joyous carousing whose anticipation had
been the leaven of hardship. Only profound trust in their own kind,
and an equally profound prejudice against all others made it even
worth discussion. The affair was emotional. Few besides Kelly were
capable of a broad enough view to vision the far-reaching politics
of the decision. And on an emotional basis it was finally
decided.</p>

<p>Ben Tilton, Joe's red-headed enemy, was from the first loud and
swaggering. He'd worked hard for his furs; he'd be damned if he was
going to throw them down no rat hole for ary man. They were his;
and he'd take them where he could get the most from them. To hell
with Ashley, or any other man.</p>

<p>"And first thing yo' know yo'll have a flock of these yere
<i>mangeurs de lard</i> traipsin' over into that kentry of yores
yo' tuk two years to find, and then whar'll yo' be?" cried Joe
Crane, instantly and automatically on the other side.</p>

<p>Tilton allowed he'd know what to do with anybody who came
traipsing about any of his country.</p>

<p>"Shore!" Joe spat contemptuously. "Yo'd jist fight the whole
United States Army ef'n yo' had to!"</p>

<p>"Wall, they's plenty more beaver kentry ain't been teched,"
Tilton had to recede from his lone defiance of a whole
organization. "And I know how to find it. And I won't have to turn
into no renegade Injin to stay in nuther!" he ended darkly.</p>

<p>Again Kelly had to interpose his authority to prevent a clash.
But in sheer obstinacy Tilton and Crane made the issue clear-cut.
Tilton was going to Fort Benton. Crane was going to Ashley. And as
Tilton's turbulent disposition had at one time or another embroiled
him with almost every man present, it came about naturally that
next morning he and the rescued derelict rode off together in one
direction, while all the others followed Fitzpatrick to the
east.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>At the River was already quite a gathering, for others besides
Fitzpatrick had been sent out to gather in the free trappers
whenever possible and wherever they might be found. A great council
was held. Like the Indians they sat in a circle; like the Indians
they smoked gravely for some time in decorous silence. Then Ashley
addressed them, telling them briefly what they already knew. The
previous year's expedition unsuccessful. Started with trade goods
in keel boats. Almost immediately lost one, containing $10,000
worth of goods, on a snag. Nevertheless some progress, a post
built. This year no better. Nevertheless he was not broke. Next
year he would be back to establish himself. In the meantime, if
they cared to trust him, he would take over their furs. He would
pay them, either through credit in St Louis banking firms, or in
trade the following summer. He sat down, and <i>engages</i> passed
tin cups of whiskey among the trappers. This was not in trade; but
"on the prairie," as a free gift was called. When all had drunk,
Ashley once more rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"I am glad so many of you are here," said he, "for I wish to
tell you what I have decided. This new company of ours will not
trade in opposition to any other unless that other invades its
territory. Let the Missouri Company, or any other, have the whole
of the Missouri River Valley. I relinquish that to them. I'm going
in for the mountain country." He paused. "And one thing more: I
shall make no effort for Indian trade. As far as I can I shall get
my furs from white men."</p>

<p>"Wagh! Wagh!" the trappers bent their closer attention.</p>

<p>Rapidly Ashley expanded his idea. The Indian trade was
uncertain, hazardous, increasingly based on liquor. Indian trapping
was unproductive as compared with the efficiency of the skilled
whites. Indian loyalty to one company or trader as opposed to a
rival was undependable. Of course he would not refuse such trade.
If Indians brought furs in to the posts, he would take them; but he
intended to send out no trading or drumming-up expeditions to the
tribes. Perhaps the white trappers could get hold of them: Ashley
would be ready to furnish the trappers trade for that purpose. He
proposed to send out his own men to trap the fur; but above all to
contract to take the fur of those already on the ground, the free
trappers. They stirred a bit uneasily at the first part of this
statement. After some hesitation Bill Williams arose to his
feet.</p>

<p>"I got a purty good trappin' district," said he. "Done tuk me
goin' on two year to work her out. I'd hate like p'is'n to see yore
hired trappers come trailin' in ater me, cleanin' out my fur."</p>

<p>"That goes fur me!"..."And me!"..."Me too!" cried several.</p>

<p>"If a man is in any district getting the fur, that is enough for
me," stated Ashley emphatically. "No one I have anything to do with
is going to interfere. But there are more beaver streams out
yonder. There must be. Provost and Henry are already afield. We
shall search them out." He looked about him at the attentive
bronzed faces. "All we need to push further west is posts near
enough so that the fur may be disposed of and supplies obtained. Is
not that so? That is why some of you men have not already gone
farther. Is not that so? It isn't the Indians who have kept you
back. Well, I shall build such posts. I shall send men to look for
the new country. Perhaps some of you would like to be of the
number? Ah, I thought so!" Ashley laughed delightedly at the eager
lightening of the faces.</p>

<p>"Now," he resumed after a moment, "I need your advice. You know
the country better than anyone else. I want your opinion as to
where the necessary forts should be built."</p>

<p>Here was a problem! A buzz of discussion burst forth.</p>

<p>Two or three talked at once at Ashley. Other small groups argued
heatedly among themselves. Strange and unknown names: rough maps
traced in the earth by means of sticks: a babel of confusion. Andy,
his eyes bright with a sudden inspiration, leaned to speak in Joe
Crane's ear. Joe clapped Andy on the back.</p>

<p>"That shines!" he cried. "Tell him about it!" He tried to drag
Andy to his feet. The lad hung back, red and protesting, in a
panic. Joe uttered a war whoop that stilled the chatter.</p>

<p>"Yere's a boy got the right idee," he told Ashley. He thrust
Andy into the circle.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," hesitated Andy, as there was no other way for it,
"it was just a thought came to me, that I told to Joe. I doubt it
is of much worth. I am but new in the mountains."</p>

<p>"Let's have it," encouraged Ashley.</p>

<p>"I was just wondering, sir, why you should build forts or posts
at all."</p>

<p>"Not build forts? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I know that is what all traders have done. But why do you need
them? You said, sir, you did not think to trade with the Indians,
but only with us of the mountains. But that can be done all at
once, unlike the Indians, who come in for the trade at any time
that suits them, and so must be accommodated the year round."</p>

<p>"Proceed," urged Ashley briefly.</p>

<p>"Why, that is all, sir. But it seemed to me that if you
appointed a meeting place in the summer where all could gather,
bringing their furs, all purposes of the trade could be
accomplished, and the expense and difficulty and danger of
maintaining a fort could be avoided. And there is also this, sir:
that the place of meeting each year could be shifted according to
the best convenience of all, for the center of trapping moves here
and there. That's what I was telling Joe, sir. I expect it's
foolish," and Andy, confused by the silent attention of so large a
gathering, dropped back to his place, and slyly punched Joe for his
pains.</p>

<p>Ashley considered thoughtfully, then struck his thigh a mighty
whack.</p>

<p>"But the lad's hit it!" he cried. His eyes searched for Andy,
who, sensing renewed public notice, had disappeared. "Who's that
fellow?" he asked. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He's the Blackfoot man," answered someone.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" Ashley was enlightened. "Well, he has a head on his
shoulders. I want to talk to him later. He has the idea. A
Rendezvous. That's it!"</p>

<p>The assemblage of scattered free trappers was rapidly being
drawn into the coherence of that unity which is always the product
of an idea. Already the beginnings of ordered resistance fronted
the advance of the Missouri Fur Company and the more powerful Astor
interests. Though not yet named a definite organization had come
into existence, facing east!</p>

<p>They talked, at length. Swiftly, minute by minute, the project
took to itself the substance of manifest bodily form. The place for
the first rendezvous was decided upon. July was to be the time. It
was planned that Jedediah Smith should, with an aciequate party,
push out into the Snake River headwaters to see what the Flathead
country might offer. At length came a pause. Ashley caused the tin
cups to be refilled. He arose to his feet. "This is the last drink
you'll get until next year, boys," said he. "And here's a toast to
drink it to."</p>

<p>He paused and held his cup aloft.</p>

<p>"The Rocky Mountain Fur Company," he proposed solemnly,
"&mdash;and its godfather, the Blackfoot Man," he added, more
lightly.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-2" id="ch2-2"></a>CHAPTER 2. The Surround</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>ANDY BURNETT, splashing slowly upstream in inspection of his
beaver traps, was suddenly overtaken and passed by an old duck and
two full-grown flappers. One of the latter almost brushed his
elbow. It is not the nature of wild ducks to lose one fear except
in a greater fear. Andy looked about him appraisingly; waded
diagonally to the bank: tossed as gently as he might the long rifle
to the cushion of a low bush. Then he reached upward to grasp the
overhanging sycamore branch his first appraisal of the situation
had disclosed. It was not strong enough to support his whole weight
for long; but it sufficed, aided by a quick supple twist of his
body, to swing Andy several feet across the grass bank. He looked
back critically. Only a scattering of sprinkled water from the legs
of his garments marked where he had broken trail. This might be
sufficient for sharp eyes. Andy retrieved the rifle and slipped
back downstream a few rods. He sat on a log, well within the screen
of alders, and listened.</p>

<p>For some time he heard nothing but the rare autumnal half-songs
of birds, the rustle of the breeze, and the low chattering voices
that always accompany fast water in undertone. Then fitfully,
intermittently, his sharpened senses became aware of occasional
breaks in the rhythm. Someone was, indeed, wading up the stream.
Andy slipped behind his log. Nearly opposite him a small aperture
in the foliage looked through to the surface of the water. Here
Andy would get a fair sight at the intruder.</p>

<p>But while the latter was yet some distance downstream Andy's
intent scowl of attention dissolved to a grave smile of amusement.
He reseated himself on the log; laid aside his rifle; filled a
pipe, which, however, he did not light. His ears had caught one
sound that determined his action, It was the quick high chirk of a
pine squirrel. Pine squirrels may only rarely be seen in midstream;
and in such circumstances they never chirk.</p>

<p>Andy waited on the log. Now plainly could be distinguished the
slow-spaced interruptions of the smooth current's flow as the
unseen wader made his way upstream against it. Andy's buckskins
blended into his background; he held himself still as a graven
image; the opening in the leaves was small, so that only for the
briefest moment could the eyes of one passing align themselves with
it. Nevertheless he was instantly discovered. He grinned again in
appreciation as the young Indian checked, then turned to the shore,
thrusting aside the screen of leaves.</p>

<p>The newcomer was a young man of pleasing and open countenance,
naked save for breech clout and moccasins, of about Andy's own age,
which was in the early twenties.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Kiasax," the white boy greeted his friend in the
Blackfoot tongue, "you have sharp eyes."</p>

<p>"Greetings, I-tam-api," returned the Indian. "But if you will
sit in plain view you must be seen."</p>

<p>"I heard your signal. What do you here? Are our people in the
valley?"</p>

<p>"I am alone. I have come to seek you, my brother."</p>

<p>Andy produced from the buckskin sack his burning glass, and with
it proceeded to light the tobacco in his pipe. Kiasax watched with
enormous respect. The tobacco well alight, Andy passed the pipe to
his friend. For some moments the two smoked in silence, turn and
turn about.</p>

<p>"The buffalo have not come," the Indian at last rewarded Andy's
patience. "There are none. Our young men have looked far to the
Cold Maker's country, to the country whence comes the Sun. Sai-yi
(Mad Wolf) has made medicine. There are no buffalo."</p>

<p>"That is bad," said Andy.</p>

<p>He did not need to be told how bad it was. To the buffalo the
Indians looked for their very livelihood. On its flesh they
depended for their winter subsistence, on its skins and sinews for
their houses, their clothing. Lack of it meant poverty and
privation, perhaps even famine if the not infrequent scarcity of
other game happened to coincide. The season was already shortening.
Soon winter would close in.</p>

<p>"All signs are bad," continued Kiasax. He arose from the log,
hunted about for a moment, returned with a small black and green
cricket cupped between his hand. Andy knew the insect. Its Indian
name was He-Who-Points-Out-the-Buffalo. Kiasax took it gingerly
between his thumb and forefinger and held it out before him at
arm's length. It squirmed about frantically, seeking to escape.
Finally the little creature gave it up, ceased struggling. Its long
antenna quivered, lifted slowly. The young Indian watched it, his
lips parted in complete absorption. The horns waved about, came to
rest, pointing straight up.</p>

<p>"You see!" cried Kiasax. "It is always thus! Are we eagles that
we can seek the buffalo in the skies? Ai-ee!"</p>

<p>He cast the cricket from him with an abrupt gesture, reseated
himself. For some moments he remained sunk in gloomy
abstraction.</p>

<p>"I have come to seek you, my brother," he roused himself at
last. "There are those who say this is because of you. They say the
Sun has withdrawn his favor. He has darkened his face because of
you. He is angry because the Blackfeet have taken white men in
their country. Sai-yi makes much talk. He has made medicine. He
says his medicine tells him these things. His heart has always been
bad. He has not liked it that the Sun has favored you."</p>

<p>Andy nodded. He had been well aware of the old medicine man's
jealousy.</p>

<p>"Some of the young men follow his medicine," went on Kiasax.
"They have struck the post. They have taken no scalps. The young
women will not look at them."</p>

<p>"That is bad," said Andy thoughtfully. He arose abruptly. "Come,
Kiasax, we must talk of this."</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>The trappers' camp, in the willow bottoms, was unoccupied except
by Pai-ó-to-ki. (Flying Woman) Joe had married her the winter
before, "the pretty little fat one" as he had called her. Now she
kept his lodge with great pride, made Joe extraordinarily
comfortable. Joe on his part treated her with a rough, rather
shamefaced tenderness that was entirely genuine. Kiasax did not
deign to take Flying Woman into his confidence; but Andy briefly
detailed to her the situation. She was much distressed, covering
her face with her garment, for she understood instantly the choice
she must make should her white man be banished. Nor did Joe Crane
and Kelly, when they came in, fail to appreciate the full
significance of the affair.</p>

<p>"We've got to do one thing or the other," Kelly summed it up.
"Get out, or go at once to the village and see this out. If we stay
here and do nothing about it, they'll be down here to murder us in
no time."</p>

<p>Joe cursed heartily the necessity that took them from the beaver
streams just at the height of the fall trapping. It meant the
premature finish of the whole season, for by the time the powwow
was over it would be too late to return. However, his annoyance did
not blind him to necessity. Five days later the three trappers,
Pai-ó-to-ki, and Kiasax, with all their worldly goods, including
their traps and fur bales, rode into the bottomland where straggled
the Blackfoot village. Their reception was mixed. Some greeted them
joyfully; but from others they received black glances or met
covered faces. Pai-ó-to-ki erected Joe's lodge near the river bank.
Kelly and Andy left the disposal of their own camp until later: but
when they returned their lodge also stood in place.</p>

<p>The three white men at once sought out old Mat-o-suki, the head
chief. He received them politely, formally. They smoked. Mat-o-suki
evaded all questions.</p>

<p>"There will be a council," he told them.</p>

<p>They left his lodge uncertain whether he was for them or against
them. This was disconcerting: they had relied on him.</p>

<p>The drum began to tap in summons. There was a stir among the
lodges. Many of the warriors had begun to deck themselves at once
on news of the white men's arrival. Others delayed until the last
minute. But slowly the circle filled, each man taking his place
with his own society. There was no compulsion of attendance. But
when Mat-o-suki at length lighted the ceremonial pipe, each
sub-chief, looking down the line of his fraternity, could count
full ranks of all those at present in camp&mdash;the Buffalo Bulls,
the Soldiers, the Buffalo With Thin Horns, Those Who Carry the
Raven, the Prairie Dogs, the Dogs. All were there, and in full
membership; all but the Mosquitoes. These youngsters were not
sufficiently considered to take part in so important a council. The
three white men were given places on Mat-o-suki's left. This was no
bad omen; or at least it indicated their case was not
predecided.</p>

<p>After the pipe had passed the business of the day was taken up.
This was ostensibly the lack of buffalo and what was to be done
about it. Numbers of men spoke, Each was listened to in silence and
with decorum, without marks of either approval or disapproval. Any
interruption would have been considered very bad form. Later in
history this custom was to lend much false cheer to missionaries,
who mistook it for endorsement of what they said.</p>

<p>But the agenda shifted from the ostensible to the real object of
the council when Sai-yi arose to speak. The medicine man, or more
strictly the Sun Priest, had been eaten by a secret jealousy of
these white men's prestige as encroaching too nearly on his own. He
had not dared give this jealousy rein. The signs of the Sun's favor
had been too strong. He dared not, in the first freshness of their
wonder, stand against the plain portents. But now the withdrawal of
that favor, as evidenced by the present buffalo crisis, gave him
his opportunity. It was the old, but ever new, story. No
administration can be overset in prosperous times: no
administration can stand in adversity: even miracles can lose the
potency of novelty. The full freshness of wonder to the beholder is
gone forever at the moment the first airplane's wheels leave the
ground.</p>

<p>The Sun had withdrawn his favor from his people.</p>

<p>The most powerful and reliable medicine was powerless to unveil
his face. Why was he angry? What had his children done that he
should frown upon them? Their consciences were clear. In no
ceremonial of respect had they failed. He, Sai-yi, as Sun Priest
vouched for the full performance of his duties. He called upon
Mat-o-suki to bear witness that in no respect had the people
sinned. These were a virtuous and a pious people. Sai-yi enumerated
one by one the basic precepts of conduct. One must be brave and
cunning in war. One must not suffer his women or his children to
want. One must never betray a friend. One must resent and revenge
insults. One must venerate and obey the old. One must fear and
propitiate the Bad One. One must not fear death. He paused, and
added impressively: One must defend the hunting grounds against
encroachment. In what had they failed, that the Sun should be
angry? He paused again for a dramatic half-minute. The Blackfeet
were the enemies of the white men. Never had they permitted the
white men in their country. The Sun had shone upon them with his
favor. Now they had broken this trust. There were no more
buffalo.</p>

<p>Mad Wolf went on at length, detailing the glorious deeds of the
Blackfoot confederacy in defense of this principle. He told of
fights against the Flatheads, the Assiniboins, the Arapahoes, the
Crows, the Shoshones, others of their hereditary enemies. He told
over one by one the whites who had attempted the forbidden
territory. For the first time the three listening learned
authentically the fate of men who had disappeared. Sai-yi ended in
a grand and boastful and patriotic description of the defeat and
massacre of the Missouri Fur Company expedition under Immel and
Jones, on the Yellowstone River. He sat down, wrapping his robe
about him. The case was opened.</p>

<p>After a suitable pause Kiasax took the floor. He began by
recounting the deeds and portents that led to this first exception
to the ancient rule: the killing of the White Buffalo by Andy; his
power to call down the Sun and make him small to light his pipes
and his fires; the great fight with the Assiniboins in which he and
his two companions had of their own accord returned from escape to
rescue the Blackfeet, to war on their side. Kiasax was very
dramatic and detailed in all this; but it was, after all, what
everyone knew: and was the obvious case for the defense.</p>

<p>"It is true that we have said in council that the white man
shall not come in our country," he argued. "But these are not white
men, but our brothers. We have said in council that they are
Blackfeet, like ourselves. One has taken one of our women to his
lodge. We smoke the pipe under the same tree with them, and walk
the same path to the spring."</p>

<p>Sai-yi, his face eager with malignancy, could hardly restrain
himself for the ceremonial pause.</p>

<p>"My brother says these are not white men but Blackfeet!" he
shouted, extending his arm. "He says that though their skins are
white their hearts are red. How are they red men? Has anyone of
them gone forth to fast alone? Has one of them lived hungry until
the Sun has showed him the vision of his medicine? Look upon their
breasts. Will you see there the medicine bag? Which of them has
danced in the Medicine Lodge the Four Days' Dance of Endurance?
Look again upon their breasts! Will you find there the scars? What
made them Blackfeet? Words! Words said, not in council, by me,
Priest of the Sun; but idly, in the wind. Would such words make of
one of our young men a Warrior? You speak of Sun Power. It is well
known that with every white man come a cloud of evil spirits. Who
knows the power of those spirits? Or in what disguise they come?
These men come into our country. They trap our beaver. They take
them away on the horses we give them. And we give them also our
beaver, that we have trapped ourselves, that they may bring back to
us from the white men, there in the country whence comes the Sun,
rifles and cloth and many things which the white men have given our
enemies but not ourselves. What do they bring back? Words! Next
year! And next year we will give them more beaver, and they will
not come back. My brother says they have done the things he tells
of for love of the Blackfeet. I think the Sun has veiled his face
from his children because they are fools!"</p>

<p>"Tarnation!" Joe muttered at this. "That's bad!"</p>

<p>Kelly shook his head. The failure of Ashley's expedition to
bring in the trade, and their entrusting to him their own and the
Blackfeet's furs on credit against next year, were beginning to
look disastrous.</p>

<p>"I am the Sun Priest," Mad Wolf cried. "I have made medicine,
and I see the sky overcast with clouds. I see no buffalo.
He,"&mdash;he stretched his arm toward Andy&mdash;"let him use his
Sun Power. Let him fast and see his vision and learn his medicine.
Then let him show us the buffalo! If his heart is red, let him show
us the buffalo! I have no more words."</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The three white men, returned to their own lodge, agreed that
the situation had become serious. Sai-yi by no means had matters
all his own way. There were many genuinely friendly to the
trappers; many still in superstitious dread of their Sun Power. But
the opposition was strong. Inevitable jealousies, primitive
distrust, envy, above all the childlike susceptibility to the
appeal of mere change&mdash;all these enlisted themselves on the
side of the Sun Priest. So close was the deadlock, so violent were
the emotions engendered, that the whole controversy came not far
from civil war, or a schism in the band. But Mat-o-suki spoke in
decision.</p>

<p>What Mad Wolf alleged as to the reasons for the withdrawal of
the Sun's favor might or might not be true. His accusations of
embezzlement of the season's furs might or might not be true: but
the season before I-tam-api had brought back the trade as promised,
so now they carried guns, and the white men had never spoken with
forked tongues. However, in one thing Sai-yi had uttered straight
words. The white men had never become red men through the usual
ceremonials and tests. Nor had they each discovered the secret
ingredient of his medicine, as the red man does. Obviously the next
thing in the programme was to rectify these omissions. After that
the question of Sai-yi's challenge to find the buffalo "So I reckon
we'll have to go starve in the timber two-three days," said Joe
resignedly. "I reckon I kin see a vision in less'n that."</p>

<p>The first rite they were to undergo was very simple.</p>

<p>Each would inhabit a pole-and-branch lodge, built apart for the
purpose, without food and without drink for four days; by which
time the giddiness of exhaustion should cause them to see visions.
In one of the visions the Sun would reveal to each the special
ingredient of his own personal medicine. This might be almost
anything&mdash;the leaves or twigs of some plant, the powdered bone
of some animal, the feather of some bird, anything at all&mdash;but
it became to that man sacred, and he must carefully conceal its
identity and carry some of it always with him in a pouch slung
about his neck. Of its especial uses Andy was to learn more
thereafter.</p>

<p>Kiasax and some of his young friends accompanied Andy to his
lodge of retirement. From its apex they hung a buffalo skull, a
kettle, and various furs and robes. These would be left as
offerings to the Sun, and until they had rotted into the ground no
man, Blackfoot or other, would ever disturb them. Andy was touched
to the heart, for the value of these offerings attested his
friends' affection for himself. Kiasax wanted to contribute his new
rifle, bought in the last year's trade, by far his most precious
possession, but from this Andy dissuaded him. The young Indian
finally substituted an eagle crown, scarcely less valuable in his
eyes, Andy himself, on inspiration, contributed the four Assiniboin
scalps Joe had insisted were his. He hated the things and was glad
to be rid of them. The magnificence of this sacrifice greatly
impressed his Indian companions. They left him with a warm glow at
his heart. Whatever the enmity fostered by the Sun Priest, these
were true friends.</p>

<p>Andy lived as patiently as he could through the four days.
Nothing remarkable happened. Hunger did not bother him. He became
very thirsty indeed, but not to the point of light-headedness.
Since his mind was not exalted in anticipation of visions, he had
none. Most of the time he lay on his back, staring idly at the
buffalo skull and the other things swaying gently above him. He
tried to puzzle out where probability had led the buffalo, but gave
that up. He wished he knew more about their habits of migration,
but if Joe and Jack Kelly, who knew the topography of the plains,
were at a loss, how could he make an intelligent guess? Kiasax had
not proved helpful. Kiasax told him that the great herds poured out
of a hole somewhere in the south and went north to the Cold Maker's
land where they were all eaten by the gods; a fresh batch each
year. This was comforting from the conservation standpoint, but had
slight bearing on the present situation. He slept as much as he
could. Even the urgency of the crisis faded in ineffable
boredom.</p>

<p>The afternoon of the fourth day wore on. At sunset the drums
began to tap. Andy heard footsteps approaching. And at the last
minute an idea came to him. He sat bolt upright, examining the
inspiration. It might work.</p>

<p>At the council fire the fraternities were already seated,
waiting. Andy was led to his place. Joe grinned at him.</p>

<p>"Ary visions?" he asked ironically. "Git yore medicine? No?"</p>

<p>"Not a vision," replied Andy. "Only thing I could think of was
that I wanted a smoke."</p>

<p>"Wall, that'll do."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Tobacco, that's yore medicine." He grinned. "Mine's a good slug
of likker, but I don't know whar I'll git it." He composed his face
as Mat-o-suki approached to present the small buckskin pouches
which each was to fill with the secret ingredient. The council
circle waited in silence while the three white men withdrew for
this purpose. Joe and Kelly seized upon the first things that
offered. Andy accepted the suggestion as to the tobacco. All three
took the chance to get a drink of water, which was strictly a
bootlegging operation, but nobody was watching.</p>

<p>"I don't know what good this hocus-pocus is going to do us,"
confessed Kelly, "but we'll play the game and hope for the best. At
least it gains time, and anything may happen."</p>

<p>At the council circle Andy found that Kiasax, as his adopted
brother, had been appointed to instruct him in the proper
procedure. The two squatted together in the center before a flat
ceremonial dish. In it the young Indian reverently deposited a
number of prescribed substances&mdash;common earth, sands of
different colors, the ashes of specified plants, portions of the
bones of certain animals and birds. All these had their symbolic
meanings, which Kiasax explained in a low voice. Then he turned his
back: the warriors veiled their eyes. From the medicine pouch about
his neck Andy sprinkled in some of his "secret" personal medicine.
Under Kiasax's instruction he stirred the mixture.</p>

<p>Sai-yi advanced to the center of the circle. It was his function
as priest to interpret from the resultant combination of colors
whether or not, for the moment, the beneficient influence or the
evil influence was in the ascendant. If the medicine was bad, the
mixture would be carried outside camp and buried, no one touching
it, and the enterprise in hand abandoned. If it was good, it would
be parceled out among the warriors, who would, during that
particular enterprise, wear it as a charm, This put the game
strictly in Sai-yi's hands. Unhesitatingly he pronounced the
medicine bad.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>But Andy would not be defeated without a struggle.</p>

<p>He boldly challenged Mad Wolf's decision on the ground that this
was white-man medicine which a white man only could interpret. It
was a flimsy argument, but a sufficient rallying point for his
numerous friends. Long and passionate discussion. Again the threat
of civil war or schism. The issue was clean-cut; conservative
against radical. Mat-o-suki looked troubled. Andy seized the moment
of confusion to arise to his feet.</p>

<p>"Brothers," he began, "Sai-yi says this medicine is bad. Sai-yi
is Sun Priest and knows medicine. But he does not know my medicine.
I say it is good. There is one way to find out." He paused a long
dramatic minute, looking from one face to the other, then shot his
arm to its full height, pointing toward the northeast. "The Buffalo
are there!" he cried. "I see them there, like leaves of grass! Let
my brothers journey there and see. If it is not as I say, then my
medicine is bad."</p>

<p>He spoke with an air of confidence he was far from feeling, but
so strongly simulated that his hearers were impressed.</p>

<p>"How far, I-tam-api?" asked Mat-o-suki at last.</p>

<p>"Very far," replied Andy.</p>

<p>"Five suns?"</p>

<p>"Farther."</p>

<p>"Ten?"</p>

<p>Andy calculated rapidly. "More."</p>

<p>"But that is in the land of the Assiniboins!"</p>

<p>"That is so, O Mat-o-suki."</p>

<p>A low murmur swept the circle. Bold enough in war and raid, the
Indian, accompanied by his women and children, is much like a dog,
brave in his own country, but timid when out of it. And the hunting
of the buffalo required the presence and assistance of all the
band, male and female, old, and young. Andy seized the moment of
hesitation. The buffalo are there, he stated emphatically. Take it
or leave it. Plenty or starvation. The Sun has spoken. Are his
children brave men or women? After which Andy too indicated he had
no more words, and sat down.</p>

<p>"How come you think the buffalo are thar?" Joe asked him,
low-voiced, as the discussion begun.</p>

<p>"Don't," answered Andy briefly.</p>

<p>"Good lad," approved Kelly. "Gains time."</p>

<p>They voted at last to make the test. The issue was decided by
the very hot-heads among the younger men who had formerly been most
urgent against the trappers. Assiniboin country! War perhaps!
Scalps! Glory!</p>

<p>"Well, so much to the good," commented Kelly in relief. "I hope
to heaven we run on buffalo. If not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll look that trail over when we come to her," said Joe
cheerfully. "But look yere, son, seems like to me yo' ain't much of
a lawyer. Or mebbe yo're a tarnation good one. You made big talk
about white man's medicine bein' different from Injun medicine; and
the whole p'int of the argyment, as I made it out, was that we're
Injuns and not white men."</p>

<p>"I thought of that," Andy grinned. He waved a hand to call
attention to Mad Wolf's figure striding angrily to and fro. "And
I'd lay a small bet that he's kicking himself because he has just
thought of it too."</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Artistic balance would require that they journey to the country
of the Assiniboins, and there find the buffalo to the complete
discomfort of Sai-yi. But things rarely work out that way in real
life. As a matter of fact, they came on the buffalo not ten days
out, which, as to the controversy, settled nothing. Sai-yi's
adherents called attention to the obvious fact that the buffalo
were not as far as Andy had said they would be. Andy's partisans
pointed out that they were in the general direction the white man's
medicine had indicated; the exaggeration of distance was trifling.
They had a little the best of it, for here were buffalo! And that
was the important point.</p>

<p>They camped in the bottomlands well back from the herds. Andy
was to see his first buffalo hunt on the grand scale; for now the
year's supplies were to be laid in. It was quite a different affair
from the ordinary and occasional expeditions for fresh meat. Andy
had taken part in a sufficiency of those. He was by now an
excellent buffalo hunter, according to the methods of both races.
He was skillful in stalking and so selecting his terrain that his
"shooting from a stand" often resulted in six or eight beasts down.
He learned from Kiasax that in open country, and the game
disturbed, it was often possible to approach within close range by
imitating the clumsy motions of a young bear or the sneaking,
prowling gait of the wolf; all this without any disguise whatever.
He had, with a half-dozen or so of the younger men, taken part in
buffalo "runs" from time to time. These were most exciting, and
somewhat dangerous. His rifle was too light and too long for the
best results at this form of the sport; he had none of the
large-calibered pistols often used for the purpose; so he adopted
the short strong Indian bow. Kiasax made him one, and a sheaf of
buffalo arrows, with wider blades than the war arrows, the quicker
to "bleed the buffalo down." To ride at top speed over that rough
and boulder-strewn prairie, seamed with dry water courses,
pock-marked with holes, would have been exciting enough and
dangerous enough in itself. But to do so in clouds of dust, dodging
back and forth among stampeding thousand-pound animals blinded and
maddened by the contagion of herd fear, was either the height of
exhilaration or the height of terror! The rider would take no
thought of his going: his whole attention was concentrated on
picking his animal and in driving, at arm's length, his short
broad-bladed shafts as deeply and as accurately as he could into
the side of his quarry. For the rest he depended on the power of
his "medicine" and his pony. It took a headlong reckless boldness,
an entire disregard of possible consequences of which the modern
steeplechaser or fox hunter knows nothing.</p>

<p>That more hunters were not killed or maimed in this heedless
rush was due more to the horses than the "medicine." The pony it
was who amid all the excitement and distractions kept his head,
watched his footing, checked and turned aside from the impassable;
tense to recognize the obscure, almost imperceptible, movement that
preceded a lunge by the maddened buffalo alongside which he raced
almost within touching distance, and to leap sideways out of
danger. He needed no bridle, no directing rein. A touch of the
rider's leg; he identified the object of pursuit and followed it
tenaciously in all its twists and turnings without further
guidance. It was hard, fast, intelligent work, and performed with
the same eager zest every polo player or cowboy would have
recognized. Disregarding legend, the Indian pony that could, in one
"run," kill four buffalo was considered very good. A "six-buffalo
horse" was remarkable.</p>

<p>Naturally a good buffalo pony was highly prized. It was never
turned out at night with the main herd, but was tethered close to
its owner's lodge.</p>

<p>But, as Andy soon discovered, this, as the big hunt of the year,
was to be conducted on very different lines. The control of the
tribe passed from the hands of the chiefs. The fraternity of Dog
soldiers took charge. They designated the camping place, far from
any chance of disturbing the herd, pitching a lodge in the center
which became their barracks and which they inhabited as a body,
apart from their own families. Their wood, water, and food were
here brought them by the people. They imposed and preserved the
most rigid and arbitrary discipline. Without their express
permission no one was allowed to leave the confines of the camp.
Even excursions to the near-by stream for water, to the adjacent
thicket for wood, were made under their escort. The boys grazed the
horse herd only when and where designated. Kiasax told Andy that if
anyone so much as stepped foot out of lines, his dogs and ponies
would be shot and his lodge cut to pieces. Noone did so. It was
true martial law.</p>

<p>Each day the most skilled hunters rode forth, not to hunt, but
to arrange conditions for the hunt. It was desirable to kill as
many buffalo as possible. In order to do so it was necessary so to
distribute the different components of the main herd that the
hunting of one band would not alarm and drive away all the others.
A general stampede would end matters in a single day. This was
undesirable. To that end various furtive and subtle enterprises
were undertaken: discreet and distant and brief appearances, the
burning of grass, circles far to windward so that a faint scent
should move but not too greatly alarm. The mass was skillfully
maneuvered, herded, without its becoming aware of that fact. The
appointed head hunter, Pi-ta-makan, (Running Eagle) decided these
things; but from his opinion appeal could be taken to the Dog
soldiers.</p>

<p>When matters were arranged the entire camp was up before dawn.
The hunters, on their best ponies, rode upstream under the
protection of the cut banks. The women and old men and children
held themselves in readiness for a summons by messenger when they
should be needed for the butchering. Some three or four miles above
camp the party of hunters dismounted in the bottomland, there to
shiver as patiently as possible in the nipping air while Running
Eagle and a few chosen men advanced cautiously to spy out the
country, to determine whether or not conditions and distributions
had changed. The afternoon before the situation had been ideal. A
segment of the great herd were frequenting a narrow valley with
many lateral ravines. But this morning they had moved out of the
valley to the tops of the tablelands adjacent. Pi-ta-makan
considered that they could not be hunted there without serious
danger of disturbing the main herd. Several of his men dismounted;
sneaked through the grass on foot; at judicious intervals showed
brief glimpses of themselves, so brief that they were not
identified as human beings, but long enough to catch the buffalo's
attention. Thus, partly because of this delicate and gingerly
herding, partly because of natural drift back toward water, the
herd was returned to the valley floor. Running Eagle and his
assistants slipped over the hill, back to the main body of
hunters.</p>

<p>Immediately, on his signal of permission, the company split to
right and left. When near the unsuspecting herd, one by one small
squads, each under its captain, or corporal, made their way to
designated stations, until the quarry was entirely surrounded on
all but the windward side. The white men had been separated, Andy
had been assigned as one of five under the leadership of Kiasax.
Firearms were considered to be too noisy. Most of the Blackfeet
carried bows. A few were armed with lances, but these latter were
mostly Dog soldiers to whom a certain percent of the kill came as a
right. The individual hunter preferred arrows because by them he
could prove ownership of dead buffalo.</p>

<p>When all had taken their places Pi-ta-makan rapidly swung in his
own party to close the gap; and, almost as the startled buffalo
raised their heads to the tainted breeze, lifted his voice in
signal for a concerted charge.</p>

<p>The buffalo, turning to flee downwind, away from their first
alarm, brought up short before the fluttering yelling mob at their
faces. They wheeled sharply to the right; about-faced to the left.
They were surrounded. In confusion they made short individual
dashes, now this way, now that; ended by huddling; crowding toward
the center. The herd was "milled." Around and around the horsemen
rode, discharging arrows at a few yards' range, dashing in to
thrust deep the long lances. Dust rose in clouds. The buffalo
bellowed. The riders yelled. The younger and more daring swooped
fairly into the press of brown bodies, wheeling away like falcons
before the lunge of the maddened bulls. The harassed buffalo
crowded, threatened the nearest of their tormentors with short
vicious dashes which, however, they relinquished as soon as they
found themselves alone. A number broke through the ring and
lumbered away. They were not followed. To do so might alarm the
main bodies over the hills. They could be seen toiling heavily up
the slopes, their tongues hanging, their flanks heaving, their eyes
wild in the terror of their escape.</p>

<p>It was all over in ten minutes, though so crowded with action
was each second that the time seemed to Andy much longer. Over a
hundred dead buffalo lay crowded in an area not a hundred yards
across.</p>

<p>The triumphant hunters sat their ponies while coolly Running
Eagle made a detailed survey of the field, counting the kill,
estimating how much time the women would require to take the robes
and meat. He glanced at the sun; waved his hand in dismissal as he
decided there was not time for another surround that day. Some of
the younger men, who had been watching him with leashed eagerness,
looked disappointed. But there was no appeal.</p>

<p>They drew aside and dismounted.</p>

<p>The women, riding and leading horses, streamed up the valley in
ragged procession. As they arrived they flung themselves from their
ponies, darted here and there among the dead buffalo, identifying
the arrows of their men, establishing volubly their claims. Some
carcasses showed two arrows, or more, of different hunters. The
position as respects vital spots was supposed to decide ownership.
Voices arose in shrill dispute. Not only the claimants but every
woman within hearing took part. The men, seated aside, their
ponies' halters in their hands, disdained even to be aware of these
gusty quarrels. Usually the bickering died eventually into
resentful mutterings; but occasionally Pi-ta-makan intervened. He
alone had remained mounted. When it seemed to him that the quarrel
had lasted beyond all decorum and efficiency, he thrust his pony
into the group; leaned over a moment in scrutiny; stretched forth
his coup stick and lightly touched one of the disputed arrows. That
settled it.</p>

<p>Already in the grass not so very far away, on the hill edges,
lurked the gray wolves, their ears pricked, waiting impatiently.
Coyotes and the little kit foxes weaved restlessly about. Overhead
wheeled the ravens, gathered the vultures. Sharp-eyed young
warriors had long since departed for commanding hilltops where they
lurked in the grass, spying for a possible enemy informed of their
presence by this unavoidable advertisement of the killing. They
were still in what they considered Blackfoot country, but the land
of the Assiniboins was just over the horizon.</p>

<p>The women worked with the speed and skill of long practice.
Shortly, their immediate tasks finished, the first of them, leading
their burdened horses, were straggling back toward the encampment.
By sundown the valley was deserted by all human kind, given over to
the wolves and foxes and birds. From the dusk, gathering like a
mist in its cup, arose a pandemonium of croaks, snarls, growls,
shrieks assaulting the quiet of the evening sky.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>Thenceforward the meat camp was very busy, a place of hard work.
The jerky must be cut and dried; the pemmican of pounded meat and
dried berries and marrow fat prepared and poured into its parfleche
containers; the skins fleshed and dried and given the preliminary
dressing which would preserve them until the winter's leisure; the
sinews and other valuable by-products dissected out. Running Eagle
and his chosen assistants were afield, sizing up the best
conditions for another surround. Skilled and trusted scouts ranged
cautiously and far against the menace of enemies. Nevertheless
there was time for feasting on fresh meat and for dances and
jollifications. It was a light-hearted time. The grim specter of
famine had been exorcised. No matter how hard the labor of the day,
evening found no one too tired to take part.</p>

<p>There was nothing ceremonial or symbolic in the dancing. It was
for fun. Andy had never heard of a cotillion dance; a "German";
nor, in all probability, had most of the world. But here, had he
known it, he was seeing just that thing.</p>

<p>The dance was begun by one woman. After a few steps she selected
a partner. They danced together, separated, and each picked other
partners; <i>but not for themselves, for each other!</i> And so on
until all were afoot. At a signal those together at that moment
seated themselves and the man kissed the woman. The humor of the
situation was to get together those least likely to want to kiss
one another.</p>

<p>A variation was the eating dance. The couples, when they
separated, selected their partners by bringing them something to
eat, as the later civilized dancers of the cotillion offered
favors. Thus at the end each had some thing to eat in his or her
hands, which at a signal must be consumed, This constituted the
sole refreshment for the evening; a sort of supper dance. The more
incongruous the offering to the recipient, the better the fun. An
old toothless squaw mumbled a large bone; a notoriously heavy eater
looked disconsolately at a tiny morsel of tripe.</p>

<p>There were only two conventions: all must take part; all must be
accepted in good humor.</p>

<p>In the daytime, while the women worked at the provisioning, and
while Pi-ta-makan and his hunters were abroad, the men amused
themselves with horse racing and other sports. The races were more
for speed and agility than for endurance. The contestants, starting
from a stand, dashed to touch a certain tree and back to the
starting line. There were considerable jostling, collisions, some
bad falls at that tree. Or they ran to touch a heavy horizontal
pole, suspended breast high, and back; whereby some, who could not
check in time, were swept from their saddles. Or they must run to
where rawhide strips had been laid parallel, ten feet apart, hop
the pony completely into the area thus enclosed, and return. If the
pony did not place all four of his feet within that space, or if a
single hoofmark showed beyond the farthest strip, he was
automatically disqualified.</p>

<p>Andy had not much success against these skilled horsemen; but he
joined heartily in the laughter. He excelled, however, in the
wrestling; and was unequalled at throwing the knife at a mark.
Indeed, so remarkable had become his skill at the latter art that
his accuracy was supposed popularly to derive from the Sun.</p>

<p>But with all this light-hearted gayety the rigid camp discipline
continued to be strictly imposed. The lodge of the Dog soldiers
still stood in the center as its symbol. Some of the youngsters,
especially those inclined to courtship, were coming heartily to
hate the sight of it. They would be delighted when at last it
should be struck.</p>

<p>Within the next week or so they accomplished two more successful
surrounds. The wants of the band were fully supplied. Each family
had its desire. A certain percentage had been given the Dog
soldiers; a certain further percentage had been set aside for the
widows and orphans. Pai-ó-to-ki, Flying Woman&mdash;Joe's "little
fat pretty one"&mdash;and Nit-o-ké-man, the young wife of Kiasax,
gave Andy and Kelly to understand that their share also had been
cared for. At the same time they lectured Andy on his bachelor
estate. They did not quite dare tackle Kelly.</p>

<p>"We have taken your robes for you, I-tam-api," Nito-ké-man
admonished him, "but that is not our business. Our business is to
take the robes for our own men."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you did it," protested Andy. "I was not hunting for
myself. I can kill enough for myself in the mountains. I do not
need the robes."</p>

<p>"It is fitting that you have robes," Nit-o-ké-man interrupted
him severely. "You are a Blackfoot warrior and you must have what
is fitting. My heart is lifted, the heart of Pai-ó-to-ki is lifted,
to do this thing for you."</p>

<p>"Ai-ee," agreed Joe's wife.</p>

<p>"But," Nit-o-ké-man was emphatic, "you should have your own
woman to make warm your lodge."</p>

<p>Andy recovered himself; and since human nature is the same
everywhere, he told his tormentors that if he could find another
Nit-o-ké-man, another Pai-ó-to-ki, he would follow their advice
instantly; but there was no more such. Which of course sent them
into shrieks of laughter, under cover of which he fled.</p>

<p>Joe did not find the suggestion impracticable. "There's a lot
more purty ones," said he, "aside my woman and Kiasax's. Look about
you. Use yore eyes!"</p>

<p>"But I don't want one!" protested Andy. "Why are you all
pestering me? Why don't you get after Jack, here?"</p>

<p>"Jack?" Joe laughed shortly. "He's sot. When it comes to squaws
he's one of these yere misanthrops," Joe's vocabulary sometimes
included the most improbable words, which he invariably
mispronounced. "Yo're too young to git thataway."</p>

<p>Suddenly Andy felt that there was a conspiracy against him. He
was beset: A pressure seemed to be closing on him from all sides.
Every time anybody looked in his direction he thought uncomfortably
to feel an expectation. The men seemed to him to be withholding
approval of him until he, as a Blackfoot warrior, should establish
himself with a family. As for the young girls, with whom he had
joked so freely and familiarly, he imagined calculation in every
eye, and he took to scuttling around corners when a bevy of them
hove in sight. This was in his imagination, of course; but his
imagination was vivid and was, subconsciously, deeply alarmed.
Andy's woman-time was not yet come: and the deep instinct back of
his destiny stirred in his defense. He had a horrible and vivid
dream of himself at bay, like a shaggy old buffalo bull, and the
girls swirling around and around him shooting arrows at him.</p>

<p>Kelly was at first enormously amused: then he took pity on the
lad.</p>

<p>"Don't pay any attention; they're just joking you," said he.</p>

<p>He talked at length in a sensible vein, and Andy agreed with
him; even laughed at himself. But however his mind assented, his
deeper instincts refused. This refusal took the form of a new
restlessness. Yesterday this life with the tribes from which other
white men were barred had seemed to him fully satisfying. Suddenly
new possibilities called. They stirred beneath the threshold, then
rose one day to recognition as an idea.</p>

<p>"Jack," he said to Kelly, "don't you think it would be fun
sometime to take a trip out west?"</p>

<p>"You'll never find better beaver country than right where you
are," Kelly pointed out.</p>

<p>"No. I suppose not," Andy had to agree. It took him some time to
outflank this entirely common-sense objection. "Might be a good
idea between seasons to look around, though," he returned to the
attack. "We'd always come back. I'd hate to leave Kiasax and the
rest. Perhaps he'd come with us."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Kelly bluntly.</p>

<p>"I don't know," confessed Andy.</p>

<p>"Look here," Kelly put it to him squarely. "How could you be any
better off than you are? You are a trapper. You want beaver; and
you want beaver to sell so you can make money. Well, here you are.
You are in the best beaver country I ever heard of. You have it
practically all to yourself. No other white man is going to trap it
out for you. You have a good and honest market within reach. You
are laying up money in St. Louis. You have firmly established
yourself with a people unfriendly to all other whites. What more do
you want?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," muttered Andy.</p>

<p>"And what better can you expect? What is there out further west?
You don't know that country; nobody does. There may not be a beaver
in a thousand square miles of it. There may be no game even. What
do you know about the Indians? If you do find fur, what are you
going to do with it? Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"I guess it is," Andy agreed reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Well, what is your idea?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I reckon I'd just like to go see."</p>

<p>"So would I," said Kelly unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Andy was startled.</p>

<p>"So would I," repeated Kelly. "There is no sane reason for doing
so; but you and I are the same kind of damn fool."</p>

<p>Andy stared incredulously. The older man was entirely
serious.</p>

<p>"How about Joe?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"Oh, Joe!" Kelly was contemptuous. "He'll holler his head off;
but he'll go."</p>

<p>Suddenly Andy's spirit was filled with the wild exultation known
in its purity only to the small boy on the eve of the glorious
Fourth.</p>

<p>"We can always come back," he said, in answer to an inner
reproach&mdash;"to Kiasax and the others," he explained.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;if we get back," said Kelly.</p>

<p>Boylike, Andy was all for starting at once, as soon as they had
returned to the base camp and could collect their outfit. But Kelly
shook his head. Winter was coming on. And, he pointed out, certain
obligations must yet be met. There was the matter of the postponed
pay for the furs the Blackfeet had entrusted to them last season,
the trade for which Andy was yet to deliver. In his excitement Andy
had forgotten that. The expedition must wait until after the
Rendezvous. But after the first small dash of disappointment Andy
found the prospect of another winter with his friends, another
spring season in the rich beaver streams, not unpleasing after
all&mdash;with the Great Adventure warming the horizon of the
immediate future.</p>

<p>It was agreed, on Kelly's insistence, that nothing be said to
Joe as yet.</p>

<p>And Flying Woman? Andy had not thought of her, Kelly shrugged.
That would take care of itself when the time came.</p>

<p>"We can always come back," Andy repeated to himself with a faint
stirring of dismay.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>Sai-yi had subsided, at least for the time being. No opposition
can stand against prosperity; and the ponies were laden. The
subject seemed forgotten.</p>

<p>Only Joe was a little curious.</p>

<p>"What was the idee, Andy?" he asked. "How come you knowed the
buffalo was here?"</p>

<p>"I didn't, I tell you," Andy repeated. "I just shook the dice on
it."</p>

<p>"Wall," said Joe, "yo' shore got luck. That's all I kin say, but
yo' allus did have luck." He cogitated; then a new thought occurred
to him. "But didn't yo' overplay yore hand?"</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"When you told them the buffalo was up in the Assiniboin
kentry."</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" Andy laughed. "Well, I'll tell you. I remember when
my grandmother found out something my grandfather had forgotten to
do or something he had done that she didn't like, and began to get
after him about it, he'd always try to head her off by digging up
something <i>she</i> had done, and starting in to scold her about
that. It never fooled her any. I can see her now. She would tap the
arm of her chair with her thimble and fix him with her
eyes&mdash;she had the snappingest black eyes!</p>

<p>"'Look here, Gail Burnett,' she would say, 'don't you try to
distract attention by raising a dust in the northeast corner!'"</p>

<p>Andy laughed again, and there was a touch of tenderness in the
laughter.</p>

<p>"I remembered that. I thought that even if there were no buffalo
the Assiniboins might raise so much of a dust in the northeast
corner that Sai-yi and his lot would forget all about us."</p>

<p>"Wagh!" exclaimed Joe, profoundly admiring.</p>

<p>Andy arose and strolled to the edge of the traveling camp. A
group of girls crossed before him, making bright eyes. He did not
even see them. He dropped the butt of the Boone gun to earth, and
crossed his elbows on its muzzle. Below him lay the dark fringe of
timber marking the bottomland. From it rose the plain to its
clear-cut edge against the sunset sky. Steady-eyed he gazed into
the golden glow. Like the swoop of a falcon his aroused imagination
leaped on over the curve of the earth&mdash;to the West!</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-3" id="ch2-3"></a>CHAPTER 3. The Raiders</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THE ambition and enterprise of General Ashley in overleaping the
old fur country and establishing himself in what was then the
extreme west marked distinctly a new fling forward. The grounds he
occupied with his new trading company were already known, to be
sure; but only to the scattered free trappers, the mountain men.
Now, in some mysterious manner, the mere presence of the Rocky
Mountain Fur Company seemed to release these men's energies for
further exploration. To be sure as yet the company operated only
informally under that name; and its occupancy consisted merely of
its annual rendezvous and the activities of its hired trappers. The
country was just as wild, just as remote as it had been.
Nevertheless a new restlessness stirred in the wind.</p>

<p>Andy Burnett, Joe Crane, Jack Kelly, returning with the annual
"trade" to their friends, the Blackfeet, were all afire with it.
The only whites privileged to the Blackfoot country, which was rich
in untrapped beaver streams, they should have been satisfied with
their lot. As to fur they could certainly hope to do no better
elsewhere.</p>

<p>But at the rendezvous a first half-determination was hardened by
a chance-met Crow chief with whom Andy made friends. He had a knack
of making friends with Indians, mainly because he genuinely liked
them. For that same reason, they genuinely liked him. As was
natural, being full of the subject, Andy inquired as to the Crow's
knowledge of the country west of the Divide.</p>

<p>"That," signed the Crow, "is the country of the Utes and the
Shoshones. It is not the country of the Crows."</p>

<p>At first he was discouraging, but discovering that Andy's
enthusiasm was proof, he unbent to a little practical advice. Andy
sought out Joe and Kelly.</p>

<p>"He says he knows where there are lots of beaver," he told them.
"It's on a river west of the Divide, toward the south. He does not
know where the river goes: he was down there once with a war party.
But he says there are lots of beaver, more beaver than he ever saw
anywhere before. He says you don't need traps to catch <i>them:</i>
you can get all you want with a club."</p>

<p>"I've heerd them tales afore," grunted Joe, who was still
hanging back in favor of his comfortable lodge and his Blackfoot
wife and the sure rich gains of the Blackfoot country.</p>

<p>But Kelly went with Andy to talk to the Crow. The latter
elaborated the details. He smoothed a place in the sand, and on it,
with a pointed stick, drew rough maps to illustrate what he told
them. Here was the Big Yellow River-the Missouri-and here, far
away, whence came the Sun, was where the River of Soft Sands left
it.</p>

<p>"The Platte," Kelly nodded.</p>

<p>The Crow swept this away with the flat of his hand. The Platte
branched, then forked again. After some discussion of localities
and landmarks, Kelly at length identified one of the forks as
probably a stream known in its upper reaches as the Sweetwater.</p>

<p>Very well! One followed up the Sweetwater until it became small,
until it disappeared. Here were no streams; only the wide prairies
with the mountains far to right and left. And then one came to a
small trickle, that grew as it took in other trickles, until it too
was a stream.</p>

<p>This was the Siskadee Agie. If one followed its course the
mountains fell behind. Thus Andy and Kelly, studying attentively,
heard first of the stream later known as Green River, and of South
Pass through which was to pour the great westward migration of the
covered-wagon days.</p>

<p>Kelly was impressed. The Rockies directly west of the Blackfoot
country were high and rugged. The Crow's description was detailed
enough to seem authentic.</p>

<p>Worth trying, anyway. And now that a real objective had been
defined, Joe's reluctance gave way little by little until at last
he became the most enthusiastic of the three, which was typical of
Joe. He wanted to start out at once; brushed aside Kelly's common
sense as to the rashness of winter travel; grumbled at the decision
to wait until spring.</p>

<p>They returned to the Blackfeet with the proceeds of the fur.
Next spring, even before the last snow had melted, they were on
their way.</p>

<p>The separation had not been easy, though the Indians did not
actively oppose the expedition. It had been sufficient to tell them
that the whites' "medicine" had called them to a long hunt. Noone
went against his medicine. Of course they would return.
Nevertheless Flying Woman, Joe's wife, went about with her blanket
across her face. Kiasax and Nit-o-ké-man were grave and sorrowful.
At odd moments Andy's heart was gripped by a pang sharper than he
would acknowledge, even to himself. But, he told himself, he was
coming back. This was just an expedition. Depression could be but
momentary. It could not persist against the flooding uplift of the
anticipation of new things.</p>

<p>They rode away at last toward the Southwest. A sharp and nipping
wind of late winter or early spring stung the inside of their
nostrils. A thin veil of snow still dimmed the earth, but through
it glowed the pale green of new grasses. Horned larks, heads low,
ran across the bared spaces. Overhead were exultant far cacophonous
cries of geese flying north.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>It was not an easy journey. The grass was still too short for
full strength. The horses weakened. The country, while devoid of
the rugged terrors of the higher mountains, nevertheless presented
difficulties enough. For a time they threaded their way through
sandstone buttes and cliffs, striped in strange colors, cut into
domes and precipices, heaped in confusion; a labyrinth; a maze,
without trees or shrubs; a barren land. Beyond that they entered
upon vast plains of sagebrush. The banks of the rare water courses
were white with alkali; the water almost undrinkable. Horses and
men sickened from it; became gaunt and weak. The grass was sparse;
grew only in bunches here and there. Game was scarce; an occasional
band of antelope, a grouse or so. They were even glad of the
smaller rodents. But the most wearing enemy was simple space.
Before them the gray sagebrush dipped smoothly to the lowest point,
rose smoothly again to the skyline. It seemed that one should cross
it in a few hours.</p>

<p>It took days. Plod as doggedly as they would, they seemed to be
getting nowhere; to be caught in a sort of treadmill.</p>

<p>Nevertheless at last, and unexpectedly, they came to a beautiful
valley, sunk below the general level, in the bottom of which were
groves of veritable trees. Through the trees they discerned
flashing waters. They descended into the valley. The stream was
wide and clear, flowing over a rocky bed. Though thin snow still
covered most of the ground's surface, here and there the sun had
melted it away in patches.</p>

<p>"Buffalo grass!" cried Joe, delighted. Here was heartening
nourishment for the horses, for the dry buffalo grass cures, over
the winter, into rich forage. "And sweet water!" he cried again, as
he scooped up a sample in the hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>They camped for several days, recruiting their animals' as well
as their own strength; for there was game aplenty in the bottoms.
It was a pleasant place; but across the west the mountains ran in
what looked to he an unbroken white wall.</p>

<p>"Told you that Crow was lyin'," said Joe, suddenly pessimistic
again. "Now we got to wait fer the spring thaw, jist like I said.
Never git through them snows."</p>

<p>"Well, we can pull up closer, can't we?" said Kelly. They
traveled up the course of the Sweetwater. The way was easy. At most
times the valley was several miles wide; again it narrowed to a
matter of yards. But never was their progress barred, or even
seriously impeded. Were it not for the steady tumbling of the
stream, and the deepening snow and the colder air, they could not
have told that they were climbing at all. The high mountains had
disappeared, save for occasional glimpses, below the rising folds
of the terrain.</p>

<p>The nights had turned bitter cold: the horses were again eating
the bark of the sweet cottonwood. The Sweetwater had dwindled to a
narrow runnel. The snow deepened. Over its surface had been frozen
a glittering crust, through which the horses floundered and
plunged. The Sweetwater had been lost beneath it too; and when at
last they had won to wind-swept high prairie, whence the snow had
been blown, the Sweetwater had disappeared.</p>

<p>For a long time they rode across the rolling prairie country,
the frost rime over the snow and thick on the low bushes. The
plains, to the eye, seemed nearly flat; but the slow, labored
breathing of the horses indicated a relentless ascent, which a
glance back confirmed. And then, suddenly it seemed, they began to
see things ahead. An immense plain dropped away before them,
rolling in undulations, broken by buttes and flat-topped mesas and
isolated towers and temples and domes, pale mauve with the
atmosphere of distance. Kelly stopped his horse.</p>

<p>"We're on the western slope of the Divide, boys," he said.</p>

<p>They exclaimed in wonder and delight. It seemed incredible that
they should thus easily have crossed the Rockies. The Crow chief
had certainly been right thus far. They pushed on joyously. Now
they were descending, though the grade was barely apparent to the
eye. But the horses breathed easily; and the surface of the snow
was softened at noon. By nightfall they had reached a flowing
spring. There was no fuel, but there was grazing of a sort for the
horses; so they stopped. By evening of the next day they had come
to flowing water, and wood, and a ledge of rimrock where Andy shot
a deer. Their camp this night had fresh meat and a fire; and so
they were comfortable and could relax and talk it over.</p>

<p>"We must be on the headwaters of the Siskadee Agie," said Kelly.
"I suppose it must flow into the Pacific, Think of that!"</p>

<p>"The Crow did not know. He had gone down it only a short way,"
said Andy.</p>

<p>"I hope he's right about the beaver," said Joe.</p>

<p>They smoked for a time.</p>

<p>"That's the easiest mountain pass I ever saw," observed Kelly
after a while. "You wouldn't know you were in one. 'Like a
prairie'-that's what the old fellow said, wasn't it? You'll see a
lot of travel through here some-day: folks wanting West."</p>

<p>"And we're the first!" cried Andy.</p>

<p>Kelly grinned at him. "How about the Crows?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes," Joe spoke up unexpectedly, "and how did they git to find
it? Trails made by buffalo&mdash;or nobody-knows-what walkin' on
four legs, afore them, of these yere prehistoric monsters they talk
about." He settled himself on the broad of his back and puffed
tobacco smoke straight up. Joe was in a dissertative mood. "More I
see of it, more this bein' first business looks funny," said he.
"Jack's right about it. This is the easy way. Time'll come when
there'll be a lot of people use this pass. You could take a wagon
through it right now." He paused to contemplate the image he had
evoked. But even the mood of his fancy could not have foreseen the
plodding thousands of the Oregon Trail; nor beyond them the glitter
of lights and puffing of locomotives as the Overland puffed slowly
up its serpentine grade.</p>

<p>"Well, we're the first white men, anyway," insisted Andy,
stoutly.</p>

<p>"Shore!" agreed Joe. "And when the old original he-mastodon come
on the tracks of the gyasticutis ahead of him, he probably said,
'Wall, I thought I was ahead of everybody, but yere's that old
cuss! Wall, anyway, I'm the first critter with ten-foot tushes that
ever come through here.'" Joe sat up suddenly and pointed his pipe
at Andy. "Yo' kin allus be first of somethin', ef'n yo' want to be,
son. I bet yo' twenty-five year from now some fat squirt or other
will be braggin' his head off because he's the first white man to
come through yere with a plug hat on! You see!"</p>

<p>Next day they followed the creek down. It joined a larger
stream. They followed that. The country was still high and arid;
but as they descended, the spring arose to meet them. The snow
softened, thinned, disappeared. New grasses showed a pale verdure.
The topmost tips of the occasional cottonwoods and willows and box
elders were tinged with green, as though sprinkled by some passing
shower from above. The soil deepened and softened.</p>

<p>Joe and Kelly, who were riding ahead, stopped in examination of
a patch of sand. Andy joined them from the rear.</p>

<p>"Thar yo' be, Andy. Thar's yore 'first," Joe indicated numerous
hoofmarks half defined in the soft earth.</p>

<p>They examined them with care; circled wide for prints in soil
more favorable for the reading. It was necessary to determine
whether the signs were made by a herd of wild mustangs, or by
animals under human control. If the latter, they must be wary; for
the disposition of the people of this country was unknown.</p>

<p>"Loaded horses," said Kelly shortly; then, after a short search
farther, he was able to point to a distinct moccasin track. The
three gathered close about to see what they could make of that.
After a moment Joe threw back his head and laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"Pore old Andy!" he commiserated the latter. "Yo' ain't even the
first white man! And this fellow's a green-horn at that!"</p>

<p>"How do you know a white man made it?" Andy protested.</p>

<p>"Take a good look," advised Joe.</p>

<p>Andy did so; but had finally to shake his head.</p>

<p>"An Injun," explained Joe relishingly, "gits on his horse from
the right-hand side. So do you; so does I and Jack and ary other
old mountain man. Why? Because it's the handiest every way. But
most white men git on from the left-hand side, like this fellow
done; Never seen an Injun do that. Use yore eyes, bub!"</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," muttered Andy abashed.</p>

<p>"Oh, yo' got one-two things to larn yit; but yo're comin' on,"
chuckled Joe, making the most of his triumph, for by now Andy's
plainscraft left him few such opportunities.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know who's ahead of us." Kelly was a trifle put
out. "There's quite a crew of them."</p>

<p>"Wall," said Joe, "I reckon we'll just have to ride and find
out."</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>They caught up with the white men below another fork, where the
main river had grown to considerable size. To our voyagers' relief
the party proved to be of their own men; trappers whom they had
left the autumn before. They greeted one another boisterously.</p>

<p>"Glad it's you, boys," observed Joe as he dismounted. "I was
afeared it mout be some of Pilcher's outfit. Who's yore boss?" he
enquired, recognizing several of Ashley's men.</p>

<p>But it seemed they were all on their own, in a way of speaking;
That is to say, Ashley had supplied them their necessities on
credit, but that was the extent of his risk. He was to be repaid
out of the proceeds of the trapping&mdash;if any. Ashley was too
deeply involved, his new company was as yet too precarious, to
justify him in sending out exploring expeditions. But he was more
than willing to encourage private enterprise. The Crow chief had
talked to others besides Andy and his companions.</p>

<p>Fitzpatrick proved to be, if not the boss, at least the old
he-coon of the outfit, as someone expressed it. He and Jedediah
Smith had collected together these volunteers. Most of them were
mountain men, a few had been members of Ashley's expeditions,
recruited in St. Louis, and so had slighter experience. It was one
of these latter who had mounted his horse from the left. But all
were of the eager and adventurous type; and at this moment all were
bubbling with enthusiasm in a manner unusual to the ordinarily
sober-sided frontiersmen.</p>

<p>The Crow chief had not lied. The valley of the river and its
tributaries swarmed with beaver. The felled cottonwoods lay like
windfalls. The dams and the conical beaver lodges fairly crowded
one another. It was entirely possible to get together quite a
respectable fur catch merely by shooting, and right in broad
daylight at that! As for trapping&mdash;it was simply a case of how
many one could handle! And plenty of country for everybody.</p>

<p>"That's right," Fitzpatrick corroborated, in answer to evident
though unspoken doubt. "You'll see for yourself."</p>

<p>This party had left the mouth of the Big Horn very early, and
had had the devil of a journey getting through as far as Wind
River. There they had left Jed Smith, a half-dozen of the original
party, and the weakest horses.</p>

<p>"They'll move over later as far as the Sweetwater," said
Fitzpatrick, "and wait thar for us. Jed got clawed by a b'ar last
year and he ain't too pert. But we're workin' on shares, and they
kin trap the Sweetwater and git the stock strong for when we go
out. Want to come in with us? Or do you aim to go on your own
hook?"</p>

<p>"We'll come in," said Kelly promptly, without waiting to consult
his companions.&mdash;"Don't you see?" he explained to them later,
"We'll get our share of the fur just the same, and if we don't want
to go back with them in the fall, our share will be taken care of.
Leave our hands free."</p>

<p>That season was a hilarious one. The main camp moved slowly down
the river, shifting location as the main streams and the
tributaries were trapped of the first cream of an absolutely virgin
country. In the morning the men separated, each hunting and
trapping the territory of his choice. There was no friction, for
there was indeed enough for everybody, and to spare, and again to
spare, and one place was as thick with beaver as another. All one
had to do was to set the traps, and none too carefully at that.
These were unsophisticated beaver. If one had to set foot ashore,
all one had to do was to splash water over his trail, perhaps
scatter a few drops of "castrum." By the time the last trap was
set, he could return to the first, certain of a catch. And it was
actually a fact that from the cover of the willows these expert
riflemen collected many a pelt by means of a bullet below the ears.
This suited Andy, who loved nothing better than to exercise his
skill with Knock-'em-stiff, the old Boone gun. When a man had
accumulated a backload, he hurried to camp with them; dumped them
down before the skinners; and hurried back again. The hunting was
as near as that!</p>

<p>The majority were afield; but a few were detailed each day to
keep camp, to skin and care for the fur, to make up the packs. They
took turns at this.</p>

<p>Within a week they had taken four packs! It was unheard-of,
unbelievable! And beaver selling at six dollars the pound! It was
not wonderful that this was the best-natured body of men ever
encamped together; that spirits ran high; that quarrels or even
differences of opinion were absolutely unknown. The thin air of
altitude was like wine; the sun shone through cloudless days; the
spring came on apace. No man was ever tired. From the long hard day
he came in at dusk fresh as at dawn. The campfire under the
cottonwoods shone bravely. Beaver tail; venison ribs; an occasional
duck or goose. Tall yarns; jokes; songs; brave hearts. Every man
was a fine fellow. Sound sweet sleep; and a new glorious day!</p>

<p>It was amazing how the packs grew. At this rate they would have
all the horses could stagger under in less than a month. How
surprised Jed Smith would be to see them come ridin' in so far
ahead of the expected time! And what a story to tell him!</p>

<p>At first they made camp as for a hostile country, arranging it
in the form of defense, driving in the horses each night, posting a
strong guard. But time went on. In all their wide wandering afoot
in pursuit of the beaver not one had come across Indian sign, new
or old. It was a lonesome country. They seemed to be the only human
beings in all its vast extent. And the very exhilaration of success
gave them confidence; for where everything was so right, how could
anything go wrong? Fitzpatrick and the other old timers were too
wary to abandon all caution; but it seemed senseless to take the
animals off the rich bottom grasses, and four men should be a
sufficient guard for them.</p>

<p>If the sentinels had been sufficiently vigilant, this reasoning
might have proved to be correct. It was just before dawn, at the
quietest time of the night. The nocturnal birds and animals had
finished their business and had ceased crying. The breeze from the
plains had established its equilibrium of temperature and had died.
The voice of the stream still murmured on, but at the lowered note
that comes with the chill of the mountains. A light mist arose from
the river and spread over the bottomlands. It was the suspended
hour of the twenty-four, when men asleep sink into the deadest
unconsciousness, and the faculties of men awake lie at their
lowest.</p>

<p>Suddenly the quiet was broken by a burst of shrieks and yells
and the rapid beat of many galloping hoofs. The trappers, snatched
from deep slumber, sprang up half-awake. Out of the mist swept a
whirl of dim horsemen, bending low over their ponies' necks, waving
robes, yelling at the tops of their voices. The younger, less
experienced white men, dazed, ran about in bewilderment! shouting
questions to which nobody paid attention. The mountain men seized
their rifles and fired hastily into the whirlwind of shadows. It
was all over in an instant. The dim figures swept in and out in a
wide circle: a few arrows whizzed <i>floo-plunk! floo-plunk;</i>
they were gone. And with them the horse herd. The white men stood
there still but half-awake, listening to the diminishing beat of
hoofs, the yells of triumph growing fainter with distance.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Here was a pretty situation! The newcomers to the country were
wild with rage: the older mountain men were more disgusted than
angry. They kicked the dying fire together. No, Fitzpatrick
sarcastically reassured an excited Ashley man, there was no danger.
The Shoshones would not come back. Why should they? They had
everything they wanted. The mountain men repressed the excitables.
Maybe the horse guards were asleep; maybe not. What difference did
it make? That wasn't the point. The thing was done, wasn't it? Quit
hollering about what might have been, and let's see what to do.
Andy admired again, for the dozenth time, the directness of these
men's processes.</p>

<p>Some were vehemently for following the Indians at once.
Fitzpatrick withered them.</p>

<p>"That's what they expect," said he. "That's just exactly what
they're ready for. Never do what the other fellow expects you to
do."</p>

<p>"Well, what are we to do? Lie down and take it?" cried someone.
"And what good is our fur, 'less'n we kin git it over the
Divide?"</p>

<p>"Wall," drawled Fitzpatrick, "we come fer beaver, didn't we? And
yere's plenty beaver. We got our traps and our rifles and our
possibles. The season's comin' on. Pretty soon the fur will be past
its prime. If we got any sense at all we better go right ahead
ketchin' beaver. If it comes to that, Jed Smith's got hosses. We
kin cache our take and go back and git them when the time comes.
And we can git more horses from the Crows. Ought to make it afore
snow time. It's gittin' on to daylight. Let's cook up some
breakfast."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't like the idee of ary Injin stealin' me afoot this
away and doin' nothin' about it," grumbled the Ashley man,
unconvinced.</p>

<p>"Me neither," agreed Fitzpatrick, "but beaver ha'r is only prime
for two months, and Injin's ha'r is prime all year round."</p>

<p>There was sense in this, and even the hot-heads came to it. They
continued with the trapping; and as the take continued
undiminished, they gradually recovered their good humor.
Nevertheless each man had tucked away in his inner consciousness a
grudge against the Shoshones; and later, should opportunity present
itself for getting even, you may be certain it would not be
neglected. That the victims of the reprisal might be quite innocent
of&mdash;and ignorant of&mdash;the original raid would have nothing
to do with it. A Shoshone is a Shoshone. It is but fair to add that
this system of responsibility by a whole tribe or a whole race for
the crimes of the individuals was a tenet of Indian policy also.
The eventual deadly hostility between red man and white,
culminating in the great wars from the middle of the century on,
had its inception in just such small incidents as this. Although
the trappers under Fitzpatrick had accepted the situation with the
usual common-sense directness of the mountain man, that did not
prevent a considerable volume of grumbling around the campfires.
Nobody relished the situation. These Shoshones had made a lot of
unnecessary hard work and trouble.</p>

<p>So when, after numerous private consultations, Fitzpatrick and
Kelly offered a suggestion, it obtained an instantaneous
acceptance.</p>

<p>"The beaver are prime yet for a few weeks," said Kelly, "and we
could probably make up a few more packs. But here's the point: it's
a long, hard journey back to the Sweetwater where Jed Smith is
keeping the horses. And when we get there, we've got to go on and
find the Crows. We've got more weight than Jed's horses can carry.
And the Crows might be most anywhere. We'd have to get to hear of
them somehow, and then trail them down, and trade for horses with
them. It might take the rest of the summer."</p>

<p>"So you reckon we ought to quit and start out now?" queried
someone. "Why can't some of us go for horses and the
rest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," interrupted Kelly. "What I want to say is that Shoshone
country is no bigger than Crow country."</p>

<p>"And it's just as easy to find Snakes (The same as Shoshones) as
Crows," drawled Fitzpatrick.</p>

<p>Kelly elaborated the idea. In this high and semi-arid country
the trail left by the raiders and their booty would be plain, would
remain so until obliteration by next winter's snows. The Shoshones
would have fled rapidly for a while; but they would not go forever.
Eventually they would circle back to their village. Why not go get
the horses? By now the Snakes would feel secure; would have
withdrawn the scouts that undoubtedly had been detailed at first to
watch the white men's movements.</p>

<p>One and all, the men acclaimed the idea boisterously.</p>

<p>There was not a dissenting, not even a questioning, voice. No
one pointed out that they numbered just fourteen&mdash;to go out
against a nation. Couldn't ary mountain man lick ary ten Injins
that ever stepped? Nor that they proposed invading an unknown
country afoot. Couldn't ary mountain man take keer of himself in
ary kentry this side of hell? Anyway, they told themselves, they
intended to come back, and these yere Snakes ought to be taught the
lesson that they could not monkey with white men and get away with
it. Save trouble next year. They chuckled and slapped one another
on the back. The swarming beaver were from that moment forgotten,
for here beckoned adventure: and not one of these men could ever
resist that call. And not one of them even paused to consider the
sheer audacity of the enterprise. (The details that follow are all
matters of recorded history. It is usually unimportant to emphasize
that "this is a true story," but in this instance it seems worth
while as a tribute to great daring.)</p>

<p>Next morning they were up at daylight, busy as the beaver
themselves. After some search a suitably dry location was found in
the middle of a thicket, They set to work digging a hole. In lack
of spades they used their knives and sticks, sharpened and hardened
in the fire. The earth they laid carefully on spread robes and
skins. When the excavation was some eight or nine feet deep they
ran a tunnel or "drift," slanting upward, of sufficient size to
contain all their furs and the other items of their equipment. They
lined the drift with cut poles, thatched its interior with grass.
When all the goods had been packed therein, they closed its opening
with another thatching and with more willow poles. Then they dumped
back the earth to fill the original hole. The surplus was carried
to the river. After which Joe Crane and Fitzpatrick, working alone,
did a most artistic job of reconstruction, such as a modern builder
of museum habitat groups might had envied; replacing grass, twigs,
young growths, obliterating the smallest traces, until they were
satisfied that even the keen-eyed Indians could see nothing amiss.
Then, to make the job complete, they moved upstream a quarter-mile;
and as carefully arranged misleading artificial indications.</p>

<p>"Don't want to overdo it," muttered Fitzpatrick. "Jist a leetle
yere and thar. Now let 'em dig! That's what I call a good cache!
Now everybody remember the landmarks."</p>

<p>They set forth that instant. There was no sense in delaying,
even though the day was well advanced. Each man carried his rifle,
his "possibles," and a store of dried meat. That, with the addition
of two traps for the whole party, was all. Every other item of
equipment and property had gone into the cache.</p>

<p>The trail, as Kelly had surmised, was as easy to follow as a
highroad. There had been no rain; and fifty or more horses leave
plenty of indications. After the first rush the Shoshones had
scattered widely, as was the Indian habit, to confuse immediate
pursuit; but later had reassembled. The trail led out over the arid
plain. Five days of steady marching swung it back to the mouth of
that very affluent down which the trappers had journeyed in the
spring. From here on it followed up the Green River. And from here
the indications were that the thieves had concluded themselves safe
from pursuit. Their camping grounds were now so close together that
the white men, though afoot, easily reached one from the other in a
day. It began to look as though the Shoshones were getting near
home.</p>

<p>The pursuing party moved with more caution. All day they lay
concealed. At dusk they set out, marching steadily until dawn. The
moon was full, and its clear, white, and abundant light showed the
trail plainly. Fitzpatrick and Joe Crane moved far in advance of
the main party as scouts. Up to now the trappers had, after due and
careful inspection of the country, ventured an occasional shot in
supply of fresh meat. Now they fell back on their reserve supply of
jerky, helped out by what could be taken in the two traps. Thus
they marched for three nights more, in silence, but with unabated
high spirits of anticipation, like small boys toward a melon
patch.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight of the fourth night Joe Crane arose from
the shadow of a boulder to bring them to a halt. They gathered
eagerly about him.</p>

<p>"Jist ahead, boys," Joe told them, low-voiced, "the whole kit
and caboodle. About a mile."</p>

<p>They followed him out of the river bed to the top of the bluffs.
Andy's heart pounded in his breast. For what seemed to him an
interminable time he followed the man ahead of him in the single
file. Then his nostrils caught the faint acrid smell of wood smoke.
At the same instant Joe turned to sign for added caution.</p>

<p>They crept to the edge of the bluff. Fitzpatrick was there,
lying on his stomach, looking over.</p>

<p>The moon was full and high. The floor of the valley was plain to
see. In a bend of the river stood the lodges of the village, stark
white and black in the moonlight. The embers of scattered fires
glowed red. Some hundreds of yards beyond the village, and
upstream, grazed peacefully a large horse herd. Beyond the herd
again was a thick dark fringe of heavy brush.</p>

<p>For some time the trappers lay flat, gazing down, registering
carefully all the details of this quiet scene. Then at a signal
from Fitzpatrick they wriggled cautiously backward, rose to their
feet, retired farther to the shadow of a great rock, gathered close
in council.</p>

<p>They were fourteen; they were about to go afoot against the
power of a tribe. In case of repulse or premature discovery they
had no stronghold, no reinforcement to which to retire. Their own
slender chance of success depended on the smooth interworking of a
whole series of fortuities, each one of which was itself a minor
miracle. One cannot blame Andy for a shortness of breath, nor for a
bit of exaggeration in the eagerness with which he bent his head to
listen to the whispering.</p>

<p>But Joe and Fitzpatrick and Kelly and the older mountain men
seemed to discover in the situation nothing but a cause for
congratulation.</p>

<p>"Jist laid out fer us!" chuckled Joe.</p>

<p>Rapidly the plan was explained. They would steal past the
village to the cover of the thick brush fringe, Under its
concealment it should be possible to get right up close to the
horse herd. Then each man was to get hold of a horse, mount, and at
a signal stampede the whole herd right through the village and off
downriver and away! Just like that! All that was necessary was to
get by the village without arousing the Indians&mdash;or their
dogs; then to crawl up to the horses without alarming them; then to
get hand on one, to scramble aboard bareback, and to stick on in
the ensuing wild rush. If a dog barked, or if one of the half-wild
ponies became frightened of the sinister crawling figures, or tore
loose from its hold the rider, or if the latter failed in his leap
for its back&mdash;or any of those things&mdash;well, nobody seemed
to think of that; nobody apparently but Andy. He thought of it
aplenty; and his tongue was dry as wood in his mouth.</p>

<p>"How about the wind?" he ventured to enquire, remembering the
whiff of wood smoke he had caught a while ago.</p>

<p>"Sucks upstream&mdash;in the bottoms," whispered Joe. "All
right? Well, let's git agoin'."</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>They slipped by the Indian village successfully, keeping close
to the bluffs, circled to the left until under the cover of the
brushy strip. There they drew together again as a group, whispering
their exultation. They tightened their belts, slung their rifles
across their backs by means of rawhide thongs they had prepared for
the purpose.</p>

<p>"When yo' git you a hold of a hoss, even ef'n it's by the tail,
<i>you hang on!"</i> Joe advised Andy earnestly. "No matter what
happens, don't let these devils git you."</p>

<p>Andy nodded without speaking. This was an occasion when, in his
case, the Blackfoot phrase was literally true: he had "no more
words."</p>

<p>They crept into the open on their hands and knees.</p>

<p>The nearest horses threw up their heads, pricked their ears
forward in inquiry of the crawling shapes. One stamped his hoof and
snorted; whereupon all the herd awakened and crowded together. The
trappers had counted on this: that their crawling figures might be
mistaken for wolves, in defense against which horses crowd together
in a compact body, heels out. The commotion aroused the dogs in the
village.</p>

<p>The moment was at hand! The trappers leaped to their feet,
stooped low, ran as quickly and directly as they could, to the
nearest bunch of milling ponies, trying to get within grasping
distance before the animals could identify them as men, and so make
off. On that success depended. Andy was frankly frightened. The
chances looked so slim to his imagination that he finally switched
that faculty off completely; He concentrated on the moment; and
therefore his impressions were both confused and full of
astonishments. He was astonished that he was actually so close to
loose horses at night; he was astonished they did not run off the
moment the men got to their feet; he was astonished that he was not
brained by the hoofs aimed viciously at him as he ran in; he was
supremely astonished to find himself actually grasping a handful of
mane, to discover that he had somehow scrambled successfully across
the pony's bareback. At that a wild exultation surged up in him.
About him plunged and jostled and snorted the horse herd. There was
a good deal of noise. He found himself yelling with the rest.
Suddenly the stampede surged, started. Andy was with it, part of
it. He had no control, naturally, of the animal he bestrode. Though
he was by now an excellent rider, he found that in these particular
circumstances sticking on was about all he could think of. Across
the tossing heads and heaving backs he made out here and there the
figures of his companions swept helplessly, like himself, in the
ungoverned torrent of the stampede. In the back of his mind flitted
a wonder whether all had been as lucky as himself.</p>

<p>Down through the middle of the Shoshone village poured the
cavalcade of maddened ponies, urged to frenzy by the yells of the
trappers. They were blind with panic, regardless of obstacles.
Lodges went down, fires were scattered. Andy had a brief impression
of heaving and tossing; of screeching women, crying children, of
dogs dashing frantically, of warriors shouting and bewildered. He
saw these things across waving manes: He caught the flash of a
rifle or two, and spared a fleeting admiration for the bold
horseman who could unsling and discharge his piece. Andy was wholly
occupied with the highly desirable feat of staying atop his flying
mount. Then, as suddenly, the village was behind them. They were
thundering down the valley, scrambling up the flanking hills,
streaming out over the spectrally moonlit plain.</p>

<p>For an hour the horses ran wildly. The riders had no means of
controlling them. But at last the headlong speed began to slacken.
The panic was fading: and the long run was beginning to tell.
Shortly they fell into a jog trot. Several of the veteran mountain
men succeeded in looping thongs about the jaws or noses of their
mounts, and thus gaining management. These helped the others.
Shortly the men were in command. They rounded in the strays.
Fitzpatrick pushed ahead as "point." Two others swung to right and
left as flankers. The remainder brought up the rear as the "drag."
Instead of a disorderly mob, the affair became a directed herd.
They headed south. By this time each had made his count. Not a man
was missing!</p>

<p>The night paled. It was morning. All that day they pushed ahead
as rapidly as the tiring animals could travel. Undoubtedly some of
the horses must have dropped out during that frantic stampede; and
undoubtedly these strays would be picked up, in time, by the
Shoshones. It behooved them to burn the trail. At sundown they
rested, but were off again by midnight. Traveling thus, with the
minimum of rest, they were back at the cache by the evening of the
third day. Thus ended one of the most fortunate and one of the most
audacious raids in the history of the West.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Fitzpatrick, surveying the wearied horses
snatching eagerly at the rich bottomland grazing, "that's what the
Gineral would call purty good business. What percent profit would
you call that, Jack. Anyway, we larned them Shoshones!"</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>They had been out twelve days of very long hours each, on short
rations, and nine of them afoot. The horses must eat; but these men
of iron had no leisure to feel fatigue. While the ponies
recuperated in the bottoms, men stood vigilant guard; other men
scouted to the north against the remote possibility of close
pursuit by the Shoshones; the rest of the trappers worked hard all
night uncovering the cache, preparing the packs for a departure at
dawn. By sun-up they were in the saddle and away.</p>

<p>Obviously it would be madness to retrace their route up the
Green River. By that way the avenging Shoshones must come. So they
took up a little tributary toward the east. When they came to the
end of that, they struck boldly across an undulating desert country
toward a horizon impossibly remote. There was no grass, no wood, no
water, no game. There was no known destination. All they had was
the sun by day and the north star by night. The sun was scorching
hot; the night turned bitter cold. At nightfall they stopped for a
single hour; then went doggedly on again. Near morning they
unpacked. Until daybreak the horses were privileged to sleep, if
they would. But they wandered restlessly, pawing the desert sands.
Already they were gaunt and thin, for though the hours of actual
travel had not been many, they were hours long and close-packed
with the famine of necessities. They moved slowly, stumbled. Every
man realized fully that but one more day was allotted. Not one
voiced that knowledge. Straight forward into the unknown. Stout
hearts.</p>

<p>By sunrise the sagebrush had begun. Just before noon the country
lifted to hogbacks and swales. The slopes became steeper, and by
that the more toilsome. As they neared the crest of one of them,
one of the ponies lifted its head. The others pricked forward their
ears. A chorus of neighing rose in the thin air. And every man
lifted his voice in a wild yell of triumph, and perhaps of
thanksgiving. They topped the rise. In the hollow below them
meandered a thin fringe of green willows and cottonwoods. Across
the way rose remembered buttes and tablelands. They had reached the
upper waters of that tributary of the Green down which, early that
spring, they had entered the country. South Pass was but just over
the skyline.</p>

<p>That night they drank deep of the clear fresh water; feasted on
new killed venison. The horses rolled and grazed knee deep in the
grass. A few days later, "fat and sassy," very much on the swagger,
they rolled proudly into Jed Smith's camp on the Sweetwater.</p>

<p>Jed was well, quite recovered from his wounds. His horses were
in good shape, and his men. But with him also was a fresh
expedition under Sublette, down from the Big Horn, waiting there to
see whether Fitzpatrick could report anything worth while.</p>

<p>Worth while! The campfires blazed far into the night while the
tale was told. Look at that for beaver! And plenty more. Easy
travel. Simple as the back of your hand! All but the Shoshones.
Damn the Shoshones! But I reckon we made them come! Won't be so
brash in the future! What's the news outside?</p>

<p>"Pretty good," said Sublette.</p>

<p>Henry had gone downriver with a boatload of furs from the Big
Horn. Expected to return by winter, bringing supplies with which he
would head over this way.</p>

<p>What next? They talked it over. Smith and Sublette were on fire
over the stories of the new country. It was still early. By moving
promptly they could get across the Divide. But how about these
furs? They must be got out somehow. Fitzpatrick had an idea. Why go
'way across the plains to the Missouri?</p>

<p>"Bet a man could float down the Sweetwater to the Platte," said
he.</p>

<p>Nobody knew; but it was worth trying. So they shot him buffalo,
and built him two bull boats, and Fitzpatrick and a few men loaded
aboard the furs and set blithely off down the river in their
cockleshells. They had no slightest idea of what lay ahead of them,
whether of shipwreck in unknown gorges or defiles, or of death at
the hands of unknown peoples. They carried with them the entire
wealth of the company, the loss of which meant the loss of a year's
hardship and risk of life. Nobody bothered about that. As a matter
of fact the party did win through, but not in the bull boats. Those
cockleshells made the length of the Sweetwater all right, but near
its confluence with the Platte were wrecked in the roaring rapids
of a gorge. Some of the furs were lost, but a proportion were
recovered and carried overland&mdash;more than sufficient to
discharge the debt to Ashley for the outfits and supplies advanced
in the spring. Still it is something to play better than even with
any game as stern as this! And the stories there were to tell!</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>Andy and Kelly and Joe Crane turned away as the second bull boat
floated from sight.</p>

<p>"Wall, thar we be!" remarked Joe, "We shore done things this
summer: Fat doin's, and hard doin's too. Times when my belly
thought my throat was cut. Times when it felt like I'd wore my legs
down six inches-a-walkin'. My old lodge is a-goin' to look good to
me. I'm jest goin' to lay back and smoke and look straight up and
let leetle Pai-ó-to-ki bring me things to eat. Look good to you,
Andy?"</p>

<p>Andy was embarrassed.</p>

<p>"What is it, bub? Spit it out," said Joe, looking at him
curiously.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it would be fun&mdash;" Andy hesitated.
"Well&mdash;Jed Smith and Sublette are going back. We didn't more
than begin to look over that country. In the spring they'll be
starting out for somewhere. By the time we get here they'll be
gone. Let's go back with them."</p>

<p>Joe took his pipe from his mouth and stared in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Who, me?" he asked at last. "Not any! I'm a married man!" he
said virtuously. "And how about Kiasax and the rest of them? Don't
you aim to see 'em?"</p>

<p>Andy was distressed. He launched into confused disclaimers. Next
year, of course...</p>

<p>Kelly laughed.</p>

<p>"My boy, you go with Sublette," he advised.</p>

<p>"I don't want to quit you. I wouldn't for a moment think of it.
Only I sort of hoped that perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, that's all right. We'll be back in the spring. I know how
you feel. Joe and I have been partners for years, but we don't
follow each other around like squaws. That right, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Shore!" Joe veered unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"You'll certainly come in the spring?" insisted Andy.</p>

<p>"Sartin shore. We'll be there. But I kain't see what fur you
want to winter down thataway when you got a good warm lodge and fat
eatin' only just across the range."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Andy. "I suppose it is foolish,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thataway floats yore stick," said Joe.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-4" id="ch2-4"></a>CHAPTER 4. Wandering Foot</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>GENERAL ASHLEY, undaunted by the failure, or the very partial
success of his first expeditions, had undertaken yet another. With
keelboats, well laden, he started up the Missouri. As far as Fort
Atkinson all went well. There he transferred to pack horses, and
with them headed for the distant Rockies where should be awaiting
him his own trappers and the free mountain men, with their season's
catches. The General prayed fervently that these should be large
and of fine quality. The furs he had managed to salvage the
previous year had no more than sufficed to keep his credit going.
He was deeply involved. If he was to be privileged to carry out his
plan of an opposition, in the mountains themselves, to the
advancing forces of the American Fur Company, he must gain some
measure of immediate success.</p>

<p>Indeed the General seemed born to misfortune. Indeed his
partner, Henry, utterly disheartened by yet another disaster, was
on the point of giving up in disgust. Certainly no man had made
more gallant sorties into the fastnesses of the Yellowstone, or
been more discouragingly or more repeatedly in disaster. He was
ready to sell out and quit the fur business. Later Ashley did buy
him out! On him and Sublette rested the great moral responsibility
they had assumed; to hold the Rockies for the mountain men.</p>

<p>It was touch and go. At prevailing prices a single good season
would put the new company firmly on its feet. But another failure
would be complete.</p>

<p>Ashlev was no novice on the plains. He was wise in Indian lore.
His orderly habit of mind, coupled with his military training, had
led him to organize and discipline his marches into a precision no
band of free trappers had ever voluntarily assumed. This was more
necessary in the former than the latter case, however. Ashley had
recruited a large proportion of his men by means of
advertisement:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"To ENTERPRISING YOUNG MEN<br>
<br>
"The subscriber wishes to engage one hundred young men to ascend
the Missouri River to its source, there to be employed for one, two
or three years."</p>

<p>Which brought to him the boldest and most adventurous, but not
always the most experienced. Therefore the informal, tacitly
understood precautions sufficient to a band composed entirely of
veteran mountain men must be supplemented by more rigid regulation
in this mixed company. Ashley fully appreciated this. On the march
all men had their places assigned. He himself rode at the head.
Near him a led mule, especially picked for steadiness and speed,
carried the records, contracts, company books, and the like. After
him the pack animals with the goods, each one of which had in
charge a man whose sole job it was to take care of that beast, no
matter what happened. Followed then the hunters and trappers, each
with his own saddle and pack animals; and at the rear Hachter, the
"Little Burgeway," Ashley's most trusted second-in-command. No man,
save the appointed scouts and hunters, was privileged to leave his
position until the day's journey was ended.</p>

<p>Ashley himself, with the advice and assistance of the old hands,
selected the camping sites. Halting at the spot where his own
shelter was to stand, he appointed a place to each as he closed up,
so that by the time the Little Burgeway had brought in the rear a
complete circle had been formed. The horses were unpacked, their
backs carefully examined and treated when necessary, the goods
piled in the center of the ring. Until dark they were grazed under
strong guard; but by nightfall they had been picketed, also inside
the ring, or hobbled closely.</p>

<p>Nor was there anything haphazard about the organization itself.
The men were divided into messes in appropriate proportions of
trappers to camp keepers, each of which was a self-sufficing and
responsible unit.</p>

<p>In the morning the Little Burgeway was the first afoot, shouting
what would correspond to First Call on the bugle:</p>

<p><i>"Leve! Leve! Leve!"</i>
</p>

<p>And in five minutes or so the Reveille:</p>

<p><i>"Leche lego! Leche lego!"</i>
</p>

<p>When everyone was supposed to turn out, dressed and equipped.
Again the horses, under guard, were allowed to graze; but before
they were sent out a rider circled the camp at full speed to rout
out or disclose possible marauders.</p>

<p>Certainly Ashley, considering well the conditions and the
average of materials with which he had to work, took all
precautions.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the wily Pawnees managed to get through them. One
morning found the party possessed of all its equipment, all its
trade goods&mdash;and a half-dozen or so only of its horses! The
rest had been driven off in a surprise attack by these most adroit
of prairie thieves.</p>

<p>It seemed the final blow. Without transportation the trade goods
might as well be in St. Louis&mdash;or in China, for that
matter&mdash;and the fur on the backs of the beaver. For the first
time Ashley was profoundly discouraged. The season was advancing.
Unless he could in some manner get his hands on sufficient fur at
least to keep his creditors quiet, the game was up. Henry's last
take was not sufficient. Other resources seemed negligible. The
free trappers had gone off on a wild goose chase of their own over
the Divide, nobody knew where. The chance of their finding anything
worth while was too slim to be considered.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Ashley went through the motions. He detailed some
of the party to return to the Missouri, where they were to try to
get hold of more horses. The rest were to remain encamped with the
heavy baggage. Then Ashley himself returned to St. Louis to see
what he could do. That was not much, as he soon discovered. So, as
a sort of side line, as it were, he ran for governor of Missouri,
and was defeated in the August elections. Which made it
complete.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>About this time a battered old bull boat containing five men
drifted in to Fort Atkinson, a post on the Missouri River near its
fork with the Platte. The inhabitants strolled to the shore. Every
newcomer was a matter of interest; though bull boats with stray
traders or trappers from the comparatively near-by districts were
not unusual. The crew edged the unwieldy craft to the banks and
stepped ashore.</p>

<p>The leader looked about him.</p>

<p>"Ary Ashley man yere?" he asked.</p>

<p>Several recognized him.</p>

<p>"Howdy, Bad Hand!"..."Howdy, Fitz!" They crowded to greet him.
"Where you from?"</p>

<p>But Fitzpatrick was noncommittal, and his companions proved
equally uncommunicative. The bystanders looked them over curiously.
They were hard-bitten mountain men, to a man, and from the
condition of their clothing and equipment it was evident they had
been long afield. Their expedition, whatever it was, could not have
been profitable. The bull boat was empty, save for small necessary
equipment and a partly consumed quarter of venison.</p>

<p>"Ary Ashley men yere?" Fitzpatrick repeated his question.</p>

<p>As curiosity was apparently not to be satisfied, someone gave
him the information. Five or six or so of Ashley's men were
somewhere about. Collecting horses. Here's one now. Oh, Jim,
someone wants to talk to you.</p>

<p>A keen-looking young man of about twenty years stepped forward.
Fitzpatrick surveyed him attentively.</p>

<p>"You an Ashley man?" he asked at last.

<p>The young man nodded.

"Whar's yore boss?"</p>

<p>"I'm in charge," replied the youth.</p>

<p>"Wagh!" Fitzpatrick looked him over again. "What yo' say yore
name is?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say. But it's Bridger, Jim Bridger."</p>

<p>"I'm Fitzpatrick."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"Wall, I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>They drew aside. The group of loungers gradually broke up. The
four who had come in the bull boat squatted on their heels and
waited in the fathomless patience of the mountain man.</p>

<p>"Whar's the Gineral?" Fitzpatrick wanted to know. Bridger
explained at length. The older man listened without comment until
the tale was finished. Though ignorant of business details his
shrewd mind grasped the general situation clearly.</p>

<p>"Wagh!" he exclaimed at length. "Bad. Fur's goin' to mean a lot.
Wall, I got it; and a plenty more whar that come from."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Bridger.</p>

<p>"Mouth of the Sweetwater. Balance of my men waitin' thar with
it."</p>

<p>"You come all the way from the Sweetwater in that hull
boat?"</p>

<p>"Shore, and down the Sweetwater from the head. (Fitz was
bragging a little. The first boats had been wrecked.) But we
couldn't make it with the furs. Lost a lot of packs as it was. How
many horses you got? Huh? Not enough. Got to git us some more. Then
we'll go back and git us the fur. Kin we git 'em?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Bridger confidently.</p>

<p>"Wall, I'll write a letter to the Gineral. Then we'll
start."</p>

<p>"Sure," repeated Bridger.</p>

<p>Which was all that, for the moment, was said of the first
attempt at navigation of the Platte from its headwaters on the
Continental Divide.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Fitzpatrick wrote his letter, collected his horses, and set out
for the mouth of the Sweetwater, where awaited him the rest of the
party with the furs. It was a good letter, for in spite of its
crude style it drew a picture. It told of the newly discovered easy
pass over the Continental Divide; it told of the Green River and
its abundance; and it speculated on what lay beyond. Ashley's vivid
imagination was rekindled. His original intention had been to open
trade on the upper Missouri and Yellowstone, perhaps pushing over
to the upper Columbia by way of the pass through which, a short
time before, Lewis and Clark had made their way. That was the
direction of all his former and ill-starred efforts. Now, just as
he was about to give it up, here was offered him a brand-new
territory from which were absent, seemingly, the elements of Indian
hostility and the enmity of rivals. He could hardly wait to take
possession. Somehow he managed more credit. Even before
Fitzpatrick's return he had arrived at Fort Atkinson, ready and
eager to set out.</p>

<p>He found the party he had left afoot on the prairie, with the
trade goods, well and in good spirits. They had even managed to get
together quite a respectable number of beaver skins, both by
trapping and by trading with wandering bands of Indians. They were
getting a little tired of wild game by this time; and had been
looking forward to Ashley's return. The season was almost
finished&mdash;it was now early in November. They would undoubtedly
proceed to the comfort of winter post, there to enjoy the supplies
their leader would have brought.</p>

<p>But their first enthusiastic welcome came quickly off the boil
when they discovered that not only had Ashley brought no supplies;
but that actually he proposed setting out at once for Green River.
The leaders among them pointed out that winter was coming on; that
the distance must be near a thousand miles; and, as naturally they
could not go upstream by boat, the route must be both rough and
unknown. How cross the Divide? How find feed for the horses? How,
for that matter, find supplies for the men? Latterly the game had
departed, and no one knew where the buffalo were.</p>

<p>But Ashley overcame the objections. They could get supplies to
do them well enough, until they found the buffalo, from a village
of the Pawnees, about fifty miles up the valley of the Loup. One
by, one he met the arguments, if not always plausibly, at least
eloquently. His insistent enthusiasm was undoubtedly spurred by his
secret thought that with him it was now or never. Among those who
listened were men whose names later were to become famous over all
the West. Besides Fitzpatrick and Bridger, whom we already know,
there was, for example, young Robert Campbell, a tenderfoot, here
present only because, after a hemorrhage of the lungs, his
physicians had sent him to the prairies to die. But so tenacious
was his quality that not only did he refuse to die, but became so
mighty a mountain man that some years later, after Ashley had made
his fortune and wished to retire, he, with Jedediah Smith and
Sublette, bought him out and took over the Rocky Mountain Fur
Company. There was also present a man of wholly different type, a
mulatto named Beckworth. He turned out to be an example of that
rare combination, the tremendous braggart who actually does things,
the man of action alloyed with more than a dash of the charlatan
and the showman. He attained to a chieftainship of the Crows, and
took a prominent part in their long struggle with the Blackfeet. In
fact he became too popular with his adopted people, and so met his
end; for in his old age he wearied of mighty exploits and announced
his retirement to peaceful pursuits in another part of the world.
The Crows gave him a farewell banquet, at which they paid him great
honor. Incidentally, they also poisoned him. This, they explained,
was no mark of disesteem. On the contrary. They ascribed their
success to the cream colored chief, and if they could not keep him
alive, they wanted at least his bones. At this time he too was a
tenderfoot, essaying his first trip to the mountains.</p>

<p>Black Harris was another very much like him. He too was a teller
of tall tales, all about himself. According to their own recorded
accounts he and Beckworth between them killed more Indians than at
that time inhabited the plains. As seems to be the habit of old
timers in all times and in all lands, they threw in a damsel
apiece, fighting Amazons of incredible beauty, for good measure.
Nevertheless Black Harris too must have been a good man of his
hands; for later we find Sublette more than once picking him as his
sole companion for long and hazardous winter journeys, and Sublette
was no man's fool, nor swayed by sentiment. Nor must we forget
Baptiste La Jeunesse, nor Claymore, later one of Ashley's
partisans.</p>

<p>These and a score more listened and doubted and finally
assented. On the morning of November 6th they broke camp and
started up the Loup River toward the Pawnee village. Scouts were
dispatched ahead to warn the Indians that the white men were on
their way.</p>

<p>But Ashley's evil star seemed still in the ascendant.</p>

<p>That very afternoon the wind turned to the northwest. By night
it was snowing. Morning disclosed a white world, and the great
flakes still sifting down. The wind strengthened to a blizzard.</p>

<p>By now the food was almost gone. It was a starving struggle for
both men and horses. A half-pint of flour was the daily ration; the
snow was so deep that grazing was impossible, and the sweet
cottonwood grew sparsely. No matter; in the Indian village would be
warmth and feasting aplenty. Cheered by this vision they struggled
on through the deepening drift.</p>

<p>On the third day the three scouts returned. The village of the
Pawnee Loups was deserted.</p>

<p>Hard doings! Starving times. The horses gnawed off one another's
manes and tails. The men killed one of the poorest of them in order
to survive at all. For twelve long days they persisted, struggling
forward against the cold and the snow and the blizzard wind. They
made twelve miles! Several of the ponies weakened and died and were
eaten. Then at last they gave it up. They turned south, and
retreated to the valley of the Platte. Here were game and fuel and
forage for the horses. They thawed out around veritable fires at
last; ate their fill of elk and deer. A day's rest sufficed these
iron men. They headed, up the valley of the Platte. And in ten days
of bitter travel they came upon a village of the Grand Pawnees.
These Indians informed them that their friends, the Pawnee Loups,
were farther upstream, on their way to their wintering grounds at
the Forks of the Platte. At the same time they were strong in their
advice to give it up, to settle down until spring. Beyond was no
fuel, no horse feed. They must surely perish.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Ashley pushed on. The blizzard continued. Half the
horses died of cold or of starvation. They found the Pawnee Loups.
Then at last they paused. Ashley called a council. He informed Bad
Axe, their chief, that he wished to rest for a fortnight, that he
wanted to trade for twenty-five horses, for buffalo robes to keep
his men from freezing, to buy meat and beans and dry pumpkin and
corn, to be permitted to live with the tribe for a short period of
recuperation. Bad Axe was friendly. He agreed to furnish these
things. At the same time he expressed his opinion that the white
men were crazy.</p>

<p>At the end of ten days the party was recuperated, both in
strength and in spirits. Bad Axe had fulfilled his promises. They
started again, two days before Christmas.</p>

<p>This time it seemed that the evil influence had withdrawn. The
weather was clear and sparkling. The valleys were literally covered
with buffalo. But the night after Christmas it began again to blow
and snow from the northwest. In spite of their new buffalo robes
the men suffered severely. Some of the horses had lain down. By
morning they were so far gone with cold that they could not rise.
When lifted to their feet they were unable to stand. Finally they
were abandoned to the wolves. The expedition went on as best it
could.</p>

<p>They could not have gone on at all had it not been for the
presence of the buffalo. Those animals broke trail through the
snowdrifts, by now impassably deep without such aid; and their
pawings exposed enough of the frozen grass to keep the horses
alive. That was about all, though; and Ashley began to fear he
would have to lighten packs, when at the opportune moment, to
celebrate the new year, they came to a grove of sweetbark
cottonwoods on an island. Here they rested for one day, feeding
their animals. They would have stayed longer, but the cottonwood
bark gave out. They found no more for nine days; then, again when
about at the end of their resources, came upon another island of
the same sort. Fate was grudging; but at least she was relenting
just short of complete disaster.</p>

<p>Ashley was not following quite the route Fitzpatrick had taken
with his bull boats. On the advice of his friends, the Pawnee
Loups, he was ascending a more southerly fork of the Platte.
Therefore when they had at last reached the foothills of the Front
Range, in the first part of February, they made camp in a grove of
cottonwood and willows, there to remain for three weeks while men
explored for a possible pass. Game was again scarce. They had to
fall back on the provisions bought from the Pawnee Loups. But there
was plenty of wood, and forage for the horses, and the weather
behaved. The country was still, as Ashley wrote later, "enveloped
in snow and ice"; but the air was clear and sharp with the
inspiring tang of the high country. To the south rose a huge
mountain which Ashley judged to be no more than six or eight miles
distant. We now know it to have been Long's Peak, and that it was
not less than thirty five miles from Ashley's camp.</p>

<p>The pass was found, or rather the way through to the real
pass.</p>

<p>They started again on February 26th. For three days they
struggled in. the ranges which, they knew, must be but the first
barrier. The Divide must lie beyond. Only by the most incredible
toil were they able to make way at all. No man could have been
blamed for discouragement. If these were the foothills, what must
face them beyond, in the crossing of the main range! Nevertheless
there was no despair, nor even grumbling. Your true man of the open
grumbles plenty over annoyances; but when real difficulty comes
along he ceases to complain. Indeed if his troubles get to be bad
enough, to be complete enough, he begins to find them funny!</p>

<p>Nevertheless the end of that third day was grim.</p>

<p>Bruised, abraded, shaken, without fuel, without forage, the
mountain "frozen and torpid, affording nothing on which an animal
could subsist," the outlook was gloomy. Nobody knew how long a
journey it would be over the main range in the best of conditions.
But this they did know: that if they could not make it in one dash,
they could not make it at all. Horses must eat. Already several of
them must be helped along; "like an old woman" as someone expressed
it. They might easily have turned back to the safety of their
cottonwood groves, there to a wait the springtime. They elected to
go on!</p>

<p>That decision was the end of their troubles, for the time being.
It almost seemed as though Fate yielded in chivalry to the stout
hearts of her antagonists. An hour's climb brought them over the
foothills. Instead of the rocky precipices among which they had
been struggling, the ascent became easy and unobstructed, in fact
so gradual that they hardly knew they were climbing at all. The
snow thinned. Everywhere were bare spots, already turning green.
Buffalo and antelope grazed in the valleys.</p>

<p>Which was a plenty for ary mountain man or mountain hoss!</p>

<p>They had crossed the mountains, to be sure; but not yet the
Continental Divide, as they soon discovered. As a matter of fact
they had merely passed from the country drained by the South Platte
to that drained by the North Platte. So they turned northwest,
angling along the Rockies, looking for a way through. But this was
a picnic. The game increased in number and variety. The slopes were
covered with buffalo, antelope, mountain sheep. Small tributary
streams were alive with beaver.</p>

<p>This, one, would have thought, was what these men were seeking,
a new and untrapped country. Surely here they could have taken a
good spring catch and resolved all their troubles. As a matter of
fact they did move very slowly, averaging no more than five or six
miles a day, stopping over a day or so here and there; and some of
the heretofore unburdened horses had to go to work as the store of
peltries increased. Indeed there was no sane reason for not here
remaining. Except one thing: the challenge of that glittering
mountain wall to the west. They had started for Green River; and
Green River it must be.</p>

<p>So next we see them toiling over a high rough country without
fuel. Water they obtained by melting snow. They had left the land
of beaver and of plenty behind them. Jim Bridger found a pass,
similar to South Pass just north. By the first of April they were
on the west slope of the Continental Divide. A wandering band of
Crows, returning from a raid on the Shoshones, stole some of the
horses. Nine men pursued the marauders and recovered some of the
horses. Ten days later they came to that fork of the Green down
which Fitzpatrick and the free trappers had journeyed the year
before. They named it the Big Sandy. After following it down for
six days they became impatient and struck across country. On April
18th they at last made camp on the banks of Green River. They had
been gone one hundred sixty-six days from Fort Atkinson; they were
the first to cross this country in the dead of winter; they were
the first to travel this segment of what was later to become the
central overland route to the Pacific. Little they thought of that!
Two things were uppermost in their minds.</p>

<p>"Said we couldn't make it! Wagh!" growled Black Harris, in
contemptuous allusion to the dire predictions of white men and red.
"Wall, yere we be!"</p>

<p>"Bring on yore beaver!" cried Bridger, shaking his traps from
their coverings.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>They trapped slowly on down the Green, with all anticipated
success. It seemed that with only a moderate patience and industry
and persistence a sufficient catch might be accumulated to resolve
all financial difficulties. But Ashley's active mind day after day
contemplated the simple phenomenon of water running downhill. Where
did it go? After he had asked of himself this question long enough,
why, naturally, he had to find out! The river bed angled to the
southeastward. Possibly it broke through the Divide, emptied at
last into the Gulf of Mexico. In that case, and if cargoes could be
floated down its whole length, New Orleans was likely to become the
headquarters of the fur trade in place of St. Louis, And what a
glorious outlet for this new country! In no time Ashley had
persuaded himself that he ought to do what he wanted to do. It was
not too difficult to forget his debts for the time being, and the
necessity of meeting them. Those debts were a long distance away,
and their maturity dates in a future whose remoteness was
compounded of both space and time. Besides, Sublette was out
somewhere; Jedediah Smith also. Burnett and Crane and Kelly would
undoubtedly bring in rich trade from the Blackfeet. Ashley did not
know then that the three last-named were also suffering from an
attack of the wandering foot.</p>

<p>"Fitz," said he, "I'm going to give you six men and send you
upstream to find it where it rises. You ought to find good
trapping. Claymore, you and another six can strike out toward that
range of mountains to west-ward. Harris can find out what's in that
other range to the southwest. And all of you try to get news of
Sublette and Smith. Now we'll have to use all the horses the Crows
left us, so we'll have to cache the goods. We'll build me a bull
boat and I'll float them down to some suitable place, say a hundred
miles or so downstream. I'll cache them there, and mark the place.
That will be our rendezvous. We will meet there about the middle of
July. Spread the word among all the Ashley men, and also any
Indians who are friendly enough and who wish trade."</p>

<p>Now that was businesslike! Most of the men would be properly
employed in gainful occupation. Only six would accompany Ashley in
the bull boat. And probably they would find good trapping
somewhere. Ashley persuaded himself that he was looking beyond the
present to the future, in a large general way. Probably he was. But
deep in his heart he was wild to find out whither the water went
downhill.</p>

<p>So they built the bull boat, and loaded in the goods, said
farewell to the three horse parties, and shoved off. But they had
hardly rounded the bend when they realized that they were carrying
too much weight. It was all right in perfectly smooth water; but
the smallest riffles slopped over the rail. So they stopped and
made them another bull boat.</p>

<p>Nothing is more delightful than downstream travel. The boat
slips along silently. The country is undisturbed. Each bend is an
exciting revelation. One comes upon things suddenly and
unexpectedly: ducks preening in a solitude for the first time
broken; knee-deep elk or deer lost in the suspension of slow animal
contemplation; a clown-like bear grubbing and snuffling as he
upturns the sand for lily roots; long lines of shaggy buffalo
filing methodically to the water's edge for drink. None of these
creatures could believe their eyes. They stared incredulously at
the strange, silent, smooth-running apparition; snorted; stamped;
were seized by sudden panic. Sometimes it was very funny. In their
haste of departure they jostled and collided and splashed and
scrambled. Even the smaller birds and creatures were astounded. The
tiny black-cowled chickadees examined them, bright-eyed, then swung
themselves beneath the twigs to see if the thing would look any
different upside down. There was no hurry. There was little work.
The weather was fine; the springtime was in full flood. Game was
abundant.</p>

<p>By the last of the month they came to the base of a lofty
mountain covered with snow. Here a good-sized stream ran in from
the west. It seemed to Ashley a suitable place for the rendezvous,
so he landed and cached the bulk of his trade goods, and made the
marks by which he had agreed to designate the meeting place.</p>

<p>Thus he had accomplished his part of the general plan. It was
now only logical that he and his men should stop here to trap their
quota. It was not only logical but imperative if the full measure
of his financial responsibilities was to be met. But the water
still flowed downhill.</p>

<p>So with a pause of only one day they launched the lightened bull
boats and again floated away.</p>

<p>But toilless travel and peace of mind here abruptly ceased. Not
half a mile below the cache the mountains pinched in, the channel
narrowed, the current accelerated. Ahead they heard the wild and
tumultuous shoutings of turbulence. It was too late to turn back.
Into a narrow dark gorge, whose walls rose perpendicular to a
height of fifteen hundred feet or more, they swept uncontrolled.
The water dashed white against the black and splintered boulders of
a formidable rapids. Round and round whirled the bull boats,
dipping, rushing forward, escaping collision with the rocks only
because they were so light that the backwash flung them aside.
Occasionally their passengers were able to help themselves
momentarily by a lightning shove of pole or paddle to avoid the
bared teeth of destruction. Most of the time they were the helpless
playthings of the roaring unleashed forces of the river. And when
at last they were spewed out into quiet waters, with a pleasant
little park on the margin of the stream, each thanked whatever gods
he knew.</p>

<p>But they were unable to land at the pleasant little park. The
current, though smooth, was too strong. It swept them helplessly
past and shot them into a second gorge, cleft as though with a
knife through the mountain. Another miracle brought them through
this also. Once more the river played them its little joke,
offering to their dizzied eyes a delightful pleasaunce past which
it drew them by its power. A third gorge, a third wild and
terrifying tide, a third miracle. This time they emerged into
bright sunlight, a wider open space, a gentler current.</p>

<p>Although they had come only about ten miles, and fast ones at
that, they needed no orders to paddle ashore. Seasoned to danger as
they were, these mountain men, they stamped their moccasins
gratefully on the solid earth. They looked back at the gorge and
the white water tumbling from it; looked at one another;
laughed.</p>

<p>"Reckon this child's willing to call it a day," drawled one.</p>

<p>"And I reckon we're not goin' to go back the way we came,"
supplemented another.</p>

<p>"We can go back afoot&mdash;over the mountains," said Ashley.
"We will have to. What say, boys? The farther we go the farther
we'll have to come back." He wanted to be fair. "Nobody knows
what's ahead."</p>

<p>They glanced up at the mountains; they turned their eyes
downstream; they looked at one another.</p>

<p>"Hell," said the first man at last, "I ain't no land-lubber; I'm
a sailor man."</p>

<p>"The country looks like it's more open ahead," agreed his
companion. "Let's see whar the dang thing goes."</p>

<p>The next morning they relaunched the bull boats. The river was
very crooked. They could not see ahead. It was also very broken and
filled with rapids, caused by rocks rolled from the sides of the
mountains. After the experience of yesterday these were nothing.
The crews laughed and shouted in high spirits. But at the end of
twenty miles, from the darkness of another mountain cleft, the
river spoke to them in no uncertain terms. They paddled hastily
ashore before the suction could get them. They had learned their
lesson.</p>

<p>"Reckon the old man is talkin' to us this time," said one to
another.</p>

<p>They made their way afoot, cautiously and with some difficulty,
to where they could see what it was all about. A great landslide
had blocked the whole river bed, and over a tumbled barrier of rock
masses the stream rushed in a twelve-foot waterfall. They unloaded,
attached long lines to the empty bull boats, turned them loose,
braced themselves for the shock of their plunge. The light craft
landed smack in the pool below, eddied and tugged, floated quiet.
They carried the baggage down piece by piece, reloaded, floated
away.</p>

<p>"We larned her that time!" they exulted.</p>

<p>Ashley painted his name and the date on a rock. Forty-four years
afterward Major Powell of the Geological Survey found the
inscription, still legible. But the date was so blurred that Powell
misread it, and names Ashley as some obscure hunter rescued by the
Mormons! Such is fame.</p>

<p>Shortly they came to a beautiful pocket in the hills, surrounded
by high mountains with green hanging meadows. It was five or six
miles in diameter, lush with grass, pleasant with groves of
cottonwood and willows, alive with game. They stopped here for a
rest and a hunt. Later this place became celebrated as Brown's
Hole, the site of Fort Davy Crockett, a rendezvous and wintering
ground for hundreds of trappers and literally thousands of
Shoshones. Now they left it alone with its elk and bear and
<i>cimmaron.</i> But ten miles farther downriver they came to a
spot where had encamped several thousand Indians at least. Many of
the lodges were still standing, and in perfect preservation and
intact, for the usual covering of skins had been replaced by cedar
bark, and this had been left in place. This was interesting. They
wondered who these people might be; and when they would be met.</p>

<p>Certainly not in the course of the river: that much could be
guaranteed. It was just one canyon now after another. Some they
passed by unloading and "lining" the bull boats: others they ran.
They were becoming more skillful and more reckless. These canyons
are named now: Flaming Gorge, Horseshoe, Kingfisher, Ladore,
Whirlpool Canyon, Desolation Canyon, and many others. At length
things became a little too thick even for these hardy men. They
landed at what is now the mouth of the Uinta River and cached most
or the goods they had brought with them thus far. The bulk, of
course, had already been landed and left behind at the place
designated for the rendezvous in July. In the lightened bull boats
they turned themselves loose and shot into the maw of Desolation
Canyon. They made the astonishing distance of fifty miles safely;
then they were wrecked aplenty. They swam ashore. Jim Beckworth,
the mulatto, helped Ashley to the beach; and bragged about it the
rest of his life until the assistance became a rescue. They cried
out, and congratulated themselves that they had left their stores.
The bull boats had overset, but were intact. However, everybody,
including Ashley, thought they had come far enough. The river had
bent decidedly to westward. It seemed now highly improbable that it
emptied into the Gulf of Mexico. Ashley had discovered that, go as
far as you like, water continues to flow downhill. He was
satisfied.</p>

<p>They tramped back afoot to the mouth of the Uinta. To do so they
had to take to the back country in places. Thus they ran across
their first Indians. These proved to be Utahs. The Shoshone country
had been left to the north. They were powerfully built and
intelligent-looking Indians, but lacked sartorial magnificence. In
contrast to the plains Indians they looked to be stricken with
poverty. Some wore buckskin shirts; a few had robes or a ragged
blanket: but the majority wore only the breech clout and moccasins.
Their arms were bows and arrows. The leader carried a flintlock
trade musket for which, however, he had no ammunition. When Ashley
signed to ask him where he had procured it, he pointed northwest
and made the sign for white man. Ashley found the letters "H B C"
stamped on its barrel. He loaded the piece and handed it back. The
Ute immediately and joyously shot it off&mdash;into the air. He
seemed much pleased at the noise.</p>

<p>They were entirely friendly. Indeed they seemed overjoyed to
see the white men, and danced about and shouted merrily. They
examined all the white men's possessions with the greatest interest
and curiosity, but did not beg. Ashley presented the chief with a
dozen charges for his musket. The Ute returned the compliment with
a basket of grass and sunflower seeds parched and pulverized. They
smoked and talked by signs. The Utah chief confirmed Ashley's
wisdom in turning away from the river. It continued its course to
the southwest, through rough mountains, and grew bigger and wilder
and more turbulent until it dropped way down below the earth into a
painted country where the sun dwelt. The chief explained it all
very carefully. The sun was the big chief; the moon was his squaw;
the stars were their children. Unfortunately the sun has a bad
habit of eating his progeny. So when he gets up in the morning they
hide, and do not come out again until he has gone to bed at night.
They do not fear their mother, the moon. But once a month the moon
paints her face black and goes into mourning for her lost children.
Then the sun gets his chance and gobbles up enough stars to keep
him going. He is really shaped like a snake, but you cannot see the
snake. What you see is his stomach full of stars. He goes to bed in
a great hole in the ground. The hole fits him so closely that he
has to crawl right on through and out the other end. That is why he
comes up in the east. But the painted country was where he crawled
in. That is where the river went. Not a good place to go, for a man
would there surely be swallowed by the sun. Thus Ashley had news of
the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, could he have interpreted its
imagery. There was little game in that south and west country. The
Indians of that region were poor. They ate roots and fish and
horses. The white men had done well to turn back. Yes, there were
plenty of horses. They ran wild. Yes, the chief could get horses
for the white men. He did so, taking in exchange powder and ball
for the old Hudson's Bay fusee and such small knickknacks as Ashley
had brought from the main stores and had rescued from
shipwreck.</p>

<p>Jubilant, convinced that luck had turned at last, they rode to
the mouth of the Uinta, dug up the little cache. They were ready
and equipped.</p>

<p>The site designated for the rendezvous lay north and a trifle to
the east. It had taken them some three weeks to float downriver
from that point. A vivid recollection of the terrifying canyons
through which they had been bumped and jostled by the torrent
recalled to them the fact that they would have to do some pretty
strenuous mountain travel to get back. It was well to be about it
promptly. That was the only sensible thing.</p>

<p>But here was the valley of the Uinta angling off to the
northwest. It did not appear to offer any great difficulties. How
about following it up? Ought to see where that comes from, now
we're here. To be sure it would lead them far to the west of where
they wanted ultimately to be. On the other hand, perhaps the going
would be easier.</p>

<p>One of the men had climbed a peak after <i>cimmaron</i> and
reported that a big range of mountains, running east and west,
seemed to drop off to flatter country at its western end. Why not
go around that end and outflank the high rough country; come in to
the rendezvous from directly west? They managed to persuade
themselves that this was a sensible thing to do. Deep in their
hearts they knew better. There was no guarantee that the travel
would be any easier; indeed no guarantee that travel would be
possible at all. The farther north one went, the rougher and higher
the ranges. Only one thing, really, was certain; it was much
farther.</p>

<p>From Ashley's point of view such a fling westward was sheer
folly. His business was to be at the rendezvous at the appointed
time; to devote his whole energies to getting together just as many
peltries as he possibly could, and then to transporting them to St.
Louis as directly and as expeditiously as he was able. Otherwise he
was just plain broke; and his associates with him. So, naturally,
the little band of horsemen and their pack animals turned up the
Uinta valley toward the west.</p>

<p>With the acceptance of this her final challenge to the stoutness
of their hearts, Fate smiled at last. That decision marked the
turning point of Ashley's fortunes.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>They found they could not quite outflank the east and west range
of mountains, but the passage through them was easy. They came upon
a large river flowing west; and speculated upon it, and decided it
probably was the Buenaventura, said to flow into the bay of San
Francisco. Only with reluctance did they abandon the idea of
following it down to the Pacific. Later at the rendezvous Bridger
reported that he had found its mouth and that it flowed into an arm
of the sea. He knew it was the sea because the water was salt.
Nobody then could realize that he was probably the first white man
to set eyes on Great Salt Lake; that the Pacific was over eight
hundred miles away on an air line; that the Buenaventura was pure
myth.</p>

<p>But down this river, later to be known as the Weber, they did
travel for fifty or sixty miles. They might have continued down it
to its mouth, in Salt Lake, in spite of their virtuous resolutions.
But one afternoon the scout, riding ahead, discerned a solitary
horseman in the middle distance, and was at the same instant
himself perceived. The two at once set their horses at full speed
toward one another, in the universal habit of the plains. Whether
friend or enemy, the thing to do was to close at once: or at least
to get near enough to discover the other's tribe and intentions. So
when within a hundred yards the two recognized the fact that both
were white men. They pulled in their horses and jogged together.
They recognized each other without outward surprise.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Jake," said the newcomer. "Where you from and what you
doing here?"</p>

<p>"With the Gin'eral. He's comin' back yonder," he jerked his head
to indicate. "You alone, Andy? Whar's Kelly and Joe Crane?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. I wintered with Jed Smith. They went back to the
Blackfeet. They were coming to join us this spring at Green River,
but Jed decided to go west. We went 'way over into the Flathead
country."</p>

<p>"Ary beaver up thar?"</p>

<p>"Beaver everywhere."</p>

<p>"Reckon the Gin'ral will be glad to hear that. I suspicion he
needs plenty beaver this year."</p>

<p>"Well," said Andy, "we got some. But we are looking around
mostly. We got quite a lot off some Hudson's Bay Indians that had
lost all their guns. Shoshones robbed them. They were pretty
desperate. But they had nine hundred skins." Andy chuckled. "Jed
made a bargain with them. He agreed to feed 'em and take 'em to
where a Hudson's Bay man named Ross was located, and they were to
pay him with the skins."</p>

<p>"Nine hundred!" exclaimed Jake. "Would they do that?"</p>

<p>"What else could they do? They had to do it or starve&mdash;or
get gobbled up by the Shoshones."</p>

<p>"Wall, that bargain was some&mdash;fer Jed. Did he do it?"</p>

<p>"Sure! He's a man of his word. We cached what we had and the
nine hundred, and quit trapping and started out. Joke was that just
two days later we ran into a party of Hudson's Bay men who'd been
sent out as a rescue party!"</p>

<p>"Then what? Did Jed give' em back the skins?"</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think?"</p>

<p>A slow smile overspread the trapper's leathery countenance.</p>

<p>"Go ahead,"&mdash;said he briefly.</p>

<p>"Jed said he'd agreed to take these Indians to Ross, and he was
going to do it. A bargain was a bargain. So we all went together.
Ross didn't like it much, but by and by he had to laugh. You know
Jed." Andy threw back his head and laughed full-voiced. "He's got
the nerve of the devil. What do you suppose he did next?"</p>

<p>"You tell," said Jake.</p>

<p>"Ross was just setting out to a Hudson's Bay Company Post up
past the Flathead country. Jed said he thought we'd go along too.
Said he wanted to 'view the country,' and wanted to learn something
about how the British traders worked."</p>

<p>"No!" cried Jake.</p>

<p><i>"Yes!"</i> chortled Andy. "And what's more we did it, and we
spent a month up there, till near Christmas."</p>

<p>"How did they act about that?"</p>

<p>"I reckon they were none too pleased," confessed Andy, "but they
treated us all right. I'll say this for them: they've got a good
outfit, and most of their Indians like them. They told me they
don't let them use liquor, for one thing."</p>

<p>"Don't believe it," said Jake bluntly. "They use a plenty of it
up north."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. I talked about it with Peter Ogden. He was boss
there. He said it was because they couldn't get the fur where other
traders used liquor too."</p>

<p>Jake clicked his tongue against his teeth skeptically.
"Everybody knows you kin make better trade with likker," said he.
"Did ye winter thar?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Andy. "We stayed there a month. Then Ross started
out again, and I reckon Ogden told Jed we'd about wore out our
welcome. Anyway we went eastward with Ross for a while, and
wintered in a stream they called Salmon River."</p>

<p>"Whar's Jed and the outfit now?"</p>

<p>"Up north somewhere."</p>

<p>"Ain't you with him now?"</p>

<p>"No," said Andy. "Come spring we started out trapping, and ran
into Sublette and his party by accident. They'd been all over
farther north, and had wintered up there. Called the place Cache
Valley. Last I saw of them they were sticking together. They wanted
someone to go hunt up Provost's party and tell him where to meet
us, so I said I'd do it. He was going to cut across to the west. I
came down this way and found him. We got a camp just downstream a
ways. Now how about you, where you been?"</p>

<p>But Andy was not yet to hear this tale. The remainder of the
party rounded the bend of the bluffs. He guided it to Provost's
camp, where again he must repeat what he had in the way of news,
this time to Ashley himself.</p>

<p>The General and Provost listened keenly to what he had to say;
though, of course, Provost had heard it before. Ashley, however,
pursued his inquiries more closely. After Andy had finished the
story he had already told the trappers he was subjected to a
searching cross-examination.</p>

<p>No, replied Andy, the British were not established, Their
headquarters were still near the mouth of the Columbia. This
expedition under Ross was a small one, an exploring party. But a
larger party under Peter Ogden had trapped this spring, farther
north. Somewhere between one and two hundred in the party. Andy did
not know what luck they had had; but he had been told they expected
to take fourteen or fifteen thousand skins.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Ashley thoughtfully. He brooded for a moment. "Do
you know about where he is?"</p>

<p>"I think I know," spoke up Provost.</p>

<p>"What does Ogden give for beaver?" asked Ashley.</p>

<p>On this subject Andy could talk at length, for this had touched
his interest closely, and what he had learned had aroused his
wonder. The company paid one dollar for prime pelts!</p>

<p>"That looks mighty little when we're getting five!" submitted
Andy.</p>

<p>"A dollar in trade?" Ashley wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And seemed to me like their goods had a pretty good
price on them. Maybe it was all right: they have to bring it a long
way. But I did hear Mr. Ross bragging that he'd got six-dollar
beaver, China prices, for goods worth sixpence."</p>

<p>"How do the trappers like that?"</p>

<p>"They don't know any different. It's what they are used to. The
company outfits them and gives them what they want. On credit. And
takes fur to pay at the end of the season. Some of the men
complained they could only just keep ahead of the debt."</p>

<p>"I see," said Ashley. "What kind of men they got?"</p>

<p>Andy chuckled.</p>

<p>"They've got gentlemen, white men, and hunters," said he.</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"That's how they divide them up. The gentlemen are the ones in
charge&mdash;like Ogden or Ross. The white men are clerks or young
men in training. The hunters are all the rest. A good many of them
are white men too; but they don't rank as such. There's three white
men with Ogden," he added dryly.</p>

<p>"You seem to have taken a good deal of trouble to learn about
all this."</p>

<p>"It's interesting," submitted Andy. "Why, sir, when one of these
outfits starts out from Fort Vancouver&mdash;brigades they call
them&mdash;the gentleman is all rigged out with cocked hat and
brass buttons and ruffles and satin waistcoats and high boots and
pistols and maybe a sword. Reckon they don't last long, or else
they pack them away. I never saw any. But that's what they
say."</p>

<p>Ashley wanted to know more. He was especially particular to know
about the hunters. A good many Iroquois Indians from somewhere back
east, Andy told him. They were a sullen and mutinous lot. Some
French. A good many half-breeds. A scattering of old Nor'westers
and Astor men, who had transferred allegiance when the companies
amalgamated. Ashley questioned him for a good half-hour. At the end
of that time he seemed to have made up his mind to something.</p>

<p>"Burnett," he said briskly, "I want you to do an errand for me.
I'll pay you, of course. I want you to find Sublette and Smith for
me and take them to the place I have appointed as rendezvous. I'll
draw you a map. Tell them, and the others who meet them, that I
shall be back as soon as possible. I think Provost and I shall try
to get in touch with Mr. Ogden. He seems to have a great many very
cheap skins."</p>

<p>"I don't think you can buy any of him, at any price,"
volunteered Andy.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"He is some sort of officer in the Hudson's Bay: a high one, I
understand."</p>

<p>"Well, I think I'd like to talk to him. I am obliged to you;
Burnett."</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>Andy, dismissed, walked away, leaving Ashley and Provost alone
together.</p>

<p>"We don't go to rendezvous, then?" asked Provost.</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>Provost hesitated. He, with Sublette and Jedediah Smith, was
close to the new company's affairs. Indeed he had every reason to
believe that he was destined to partnership, and when, some years
later, this hope was frustrated, his chagrin drove him into bitter
opposition. But at this moment he had just reason to believe
himself high in Ashley's confidence. The present financial crisis
was well known to him. He, as well as Andy Burnett, knew well the
intense loyalty the Hudson's Bay inspired in her servants.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you'll gain by it. It's a wild goose chase,
General. The boy is right. Ogden won't sell; at any price, no
matter what the profit."</p>

<p>"Etienne," said Ashley emphatically, "we must have beaver."</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>"Do you know the motto of the Hudson's Bay Company?"</p>

<p>"Don't know as I do."</p>

<p>"Well it's <i>Pro pelle cutem."</i></p>

<p>"Does that mean anything in United States?"</p>

<p>"It means a 'skin for a skin.' It's a pretty good motto."</p>

<p>He looked at Provost. Provost looked at him.</p>

<p>"There's nineteen of us and a hundred and fifty or so of them,"
suggested the partisan at last.</p>

<p>"One gentleman and three white men," Ashley reminded him. "The
rest are 'hunters'."</p>

<p>"What you got in mind, General?" asked Provost bluntly.</p>

<p>"Just to go see," said Ashley.</p>

<p>"The boys won't like startin' west and the rendezvous east."</p>

<p>"I think you can handle that."</p>

<p>"Well," Provost admitted reluctantly, "maybe I can." He shook
his shoulders, "Reckon we're travelin' west."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-5" id="ch2-5"></a>CHAPTER 5. Rendezvous</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THE encampment in the river bottom had sprung up almost
overnight. Each day brought its increase; almost each hour. Down
the grassy valley of the bottomlands; over the skyline of rim
rocks; along the winding tributary of the Green new parties
appeared. If they were white men they came in full speed, as fast
as their ponies could step it, waving their rifles and blankets
like Indians, yelling at the full power of their lungs. The fringes
on their black and shiny buckskins snapped in the wind of their
going. Some of them had weighted the fringes with bullets of lead;
or ornamented them with rows of hawks' bills, or little bells, and
these things jangled together. The tails, too, on the skin caps
danced merrily. A few of the wilder spirits had even assumed, for
the purposes of this grand entrance, Indian war bonnets, which they
had packed all this distance, or had gone to some other childish
extreme of barbaric play-acting. Or, rather, it would have been
childish against any other background than the year of "splendid
wayfaring," of hardship and danger, from which they returned.
Emerging from that confused and dim magnificence of emprise, these
bizarre figures rode somehow in appropriate caparison.</p>

<p>They swept down upon the encampment pell-mell. The ponies ran
unchecked and unguided, heads stretched, nostrils wide. Behind
them, at a distance, the pack animals hurried as fast as they were
able, fearful of being left behind, too conscientious in their long
training to cut loose and run, regardless of the integrity of their
burdens. Into the scattered encampment they plunged, among the
tents and lodges, reckless of what they hit or overran, discharging
their rifles in the air! Women screamed and ducked aside; children
scattered like quail.</p>

<p>Indians composed their countenances to stolidity; tall trappers
arose, cursing or laughing, snatched at the riders or the riders'
mounts. The ponies, sensing that the goal of their wild race had
been reached, plunged to a halt, milled around, threw up their
heads, racked away at a high swinging trot as soon as their saddles
were empty, halted again, restlessly puzzled. For a time nobody
paid them any attention.</p>

<p>Some of their riders vaulted lightly from their backs without
troubling to check them. Others came down with a thump, unhorsed by
a grasp on arm or leg. Immediately they grappled with the men who
had thus laid them low, rolling about on the ground in a bear hug,
pummeling, shouting epithets. The blows were heartily delivered,
the epithets luridly insulting. They had to be. Nothing less could
be expressive of this high point of the year.</p>

<p>The first exuberance over, they still continued for some moments
pounding one another admiringly on the back, shouting in one
another's faces. Then gradually they fell apart in pairs or little
groups. The pack horses came up, wandered about uncertainly. Some
of those already encamped were provided with Indian wives; perhaps
the rear of the newcomers was brought up by a woman or so. These
began without orders to take charge of the animals, to unsaddle
them, unpack them; perhaps to erect a lodge or so for their men, or
for the unattached guests. The trappers had no time to fuss with
such things yet. They were too busy. They sat about on their heels,
smoking, gnawing on fat ribs of roasted meat, talking thirteen to
the dozen, pouring forth the jumble of question and of news that a
year of slow taciturnity in a hard and lonesome land had stored up
within them.</p>

<p>Confusedly, in fragments, the mosaic of the tale was patterned.
It was too wide-flung in scope and in incident for any one man's
telling. Men's minds were too exultantly ebullient for
understanding. All that might come later, in the slower, soberer
leisure after effervescence had overflowed. There was a large
impatience of details as yet: and still each man was filled with
details which he must tell. They shouted snatches at one another;
questioned and did not wait for answers. The thing was too big for
them. They must spill over, in a grand general spree of some sort,
a safety valve, a relief of pressure. Not until then could they
settle down to cases. If they only had some likker...</p>

<p>Anybody heerd of the Gin'ral? When was he likely to git in?</p>

<p>Burnett had run across him up northwest a ways. Andy repeated
his story for the twentieth time. Ashley and Provost were certainly
on the way. This was the place of the rendezvous, all right. Yes,
he said he'd be here by July. Well, nigh onto July now, isn't it?
Said he had plenty of trade, did he? Well, let's hunt the cache;
kain't be fur away. The proposal was greeted with derision. Suppose
we ain't looked? Ashley is no <i>mangeur de lard.</i> Wise old
he-coon. Ary man, or Injin, finds his cache has got a good
nose.</p>

<p>So the newcomers finally settled down with the others. The
waiting was not unpleasant. There was plenty of game. Fat eating.
Tobacco a bit scarce with some; but they divided up. Plenty to talk
about.</p>

<p>They found that in one respect the sum total of achievement had
been remarkable. This was the first full season beyond the
Continental Divide. In a brief space of time they had covered an
enormous extent of unknown territory. Jedediah Smith and his men
had been up Green River, over to the Snake, down to the Columbia,
to the Flatheads, and back to Utah, where they had accidentally run
into Sublette's party. Sublette had been to the southwest to the
Bear River, which they trapped all summer; had rounded the Wasatch
Mountains: had, in the person of Bridger, discovered the Great Salt
Lake, and had completed the circle to Cache Valley, where they had
met Jedediah Smith. Etienne Provost and his band had gone south,
then west, crossed the Bear River to the Weber where, Andy
reported, he had fallen in with Ashley, and was still out with the
General's party. The three other groups under Fitzpatrick,
Claymore, and another, into which Ashley had divided his original
expedition, had also ranged wide over the expanse of country toward
Salt Lake, and were now returned, each with its story. Among them
all they had swung back the gateway of the heretofore impassable
mountains. And at this moment McLoughlin, the great Hudson's Bay
factor on the Pacific Coast, was congratulating himself on British
security there forever.</p>

<p>"For all coming time," he was telling a visitor, "we and our
children will have uninterrupted possession of this country, as it
can never be reached by families but by water around Cape Horn.
Yankees? As well might they undertake to go to the moon!"</p>

<p>Within forty years ten thousand wagons, in a single season,
rolled over the long obliterated tracks of the Ashley men!</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>No thought of their successors crossed their minds now. As far
as the country itself went they were interested in two things: it
was rich in beaver; and the British were pushing into it from the
west, just as they were entering it from the east. Jedediah Smith
had run across a small band of Hudson's Bay trappers. He had found
them destitute, to be sure, and had generously relieved them of
their entire catch, some nine hundred skins, in exchange for
succor. Purty slick of Jed! And this year one of their big bugs was
headed in, name of Ogden. Had a big party. Burnett knew something
of that. How about it, Andy?</p>

<p>Yes, that is right, Andy told them. He is said to have somewhere
between one and two hundred men with him.</p>

<p>They whistled mournfully at this. That's a power of men. That
many would clean out a district pretty fast. Why can't they stay
back where they belong?</p>

<p>"Hell," said Hartley, "there's country enough back there for a
thousand men to trap and never run across one another. She's a big
country, I tell you."</p>

<p>But they shook their heads. They did not like it. They had moved
west of the Divide to get rid of the Missouri and American Fur
companies. Seems like they ought to have <i>some</i> place to
theirselves! This last from a new arrival.</p>

<p>"The General headed out to find Ogden," said Andy. "That's when
I left him to find the others and tell them where to rendezvous.
That's what's keeping him."</p>

<p>"That so?" the late arrival brightened. "Wall, I reckon the
Gin'ral will handle him."</p>

<p>"Sure!" they agreed comfortably. "He'll handle him. Wisht he'd
come on in. I could use a slug of likker. Sure he's got cyards,
Fitz?"</p>

<p>Fitz was sure. That was good. Hadn't had a game of cyards since
the devil grew a tail.</p>

<p>They were really quite comfortable and happy. The encampment was
taking on considerable size. It straggled down the river bottom for
a mile or more, its extent augmented by several small villages of
Utahs and Shoshones who had come in, drawn by the rumored trade,
and who were dwelling quietly and amicably together.</p>

<p>There was much visiting back and forth, among white men and red,
renewing old acquaintance. Joe Crane and Kelly had come over from
the Blackfoot country. Joe had with him Flying Woman, his Blackfoot
wife. They were looked upon just a little askance by certain of the
trappers. There was no open hostility, merely a slight but
noticeable withdrawal. Joe was inclined to bristle; but Kelly was
philosophical.</p>

<p>"What can you expect?" said he. "The Blackfeet are as hostile as
ever to all whites in their country. Naturally, since we are the
only men allowed in there we are resented a little."</p>

<p>"Especial since we git the beaver," grinned Joe, recovering.</p>

<p>"The Blackfeet are just as bad toward the British," Andy
contributed. "Has there been trouble on our side this past
year?"</p>

<p>"Not what you call real trouble," said Kelly. "But nobody's
tried very hard to get in. Man name of Holley sneaked in around the
edges. He made out a while by putting his traps out nights and
taking them in before daylight, and lying hid all day."</p>

<p>There was considerable resentment against the Blackfeet. They
were the only people with whom it was impossible to make any
arrangement, either to trap or to trade. It was felt that Kelly or
Crane or Andy should be able to do something about it. In vain they
protested that their standing was purely personal, that they had no
influence whatever on policies. After a time, since the most were
basically fair-minded, this was acknowledged, though grudgingly.
Some day they'd get together and go in there strong enough to trap
whether or no, and the Blackfeet could go to hell if they didn't
like it. Then whar'll you be? Reckon ye don't aim to fight agin
white men, do ye? And ef'n ye don't, them Injins hist ye quick!</p>

<p>"He's right at that," Kelly acknowledged in confidence. "When
the time comes to take sides, we're through."</p>

<p>Andy was troubled. He liked the Blackfeet: he had close friends
among them. Indeed, he had a sneaking liking for all Indians. He
was clear-eyed. He recognized that from the white man's standpoint
they were thieves, that they were touchily and inordinately vain,
that they were treacherous, selfish, revengeful, cruel sometimes to
the point of fiendishness, that they lived by foolish and
relentless war. He had no illusions as to the "noble red man." But
Andy dimly sensed that there was also a red man's standpoint. For
instance, leaving aside the type of robbery under arms which was
the breath of life in their nostrils, and pilfering from the alien,
he could not but see that they were honest, more honest as a race
than the whites. They fulfilled their promises&mdash;to one
another&mdash;to the letter; theft&mdash;from one another&mdash;was
a major crime, but seldom committed. They were hospitable. A guest
waxed fat even at the expense of the host's fasting: his
belongings, his person were sacred. Certainly they were brave. They
had their own ideas as to what constituted silly recklessness or
foolish chances, to be sure, but that was common sense. Certainly
they were deeply and reverently religious. Andy was cursed by the
necessity of taking the other man's point of view; he could not
help it. Possibly the point of view of the red race was a lower one
than that of the white race; but he was beginning to entertain a
sneaking notion that perhaps the individuals on the whole lived up
to it better. Which raised a nice philosophical point that resulted
merely in Andy's confusion of mind. He was no philosopher. At this
point he gave it up. But he did like Indians.</p>

<p>In this he was almost unique. A great many of the trappers, such
as Joe Crane, liked individual Indians, or certain small groups or
bands of Indians. A great many more of them got on well with
Indians in a rough-and-ready fashion, fighting or fraternizing with
equal zest according to the circumstance of the moment. But
Indians, as a race, apart, were to be considered objectively as one
considers any other phenomenon of nature. And already a class was
building up that later was to become numerous. These were professed
Indian haters, "Indian killers." Sometimes their attitude was based
merely on a low and bestial racial antipathy. More often it grew
from exasperation over continued petty annoyance&mdash;valuable
traps persistently stolen, horses raided, highway-robberies which
left them naked on the prairies; or the more deadly feuds
engendered by the killing of a partner or close friend. After such
an episode often bloody retribution was visited at the next
opportunity and on Indians innocent of even the knowledge of the
outrage. These men were implacable; and looked with fierce contempt
on the effeminacy of any sympathy whatever for the "red devils."
Often they joined in with one tribe in their wars on other tribes
solely for the satisfaction of killing Indians!</p>

<p>So we see Andy, in this interval of waiting, often among the
lodges of the Shoshones or the Utahs, smoking gravely with chief or
medicine man, exchanging views and news in the swift sign talk.
Among the former he found many belonging to the band that had the
season before raided away the horses at Green River, and who had in
return been raided by the trappers to the loss not only of the
plunder but of their own animals as well. He discovered in them no
hard feelings because of the episode; on the contrary a genuine
admiration. In spite of this, and of the murder of some of
Provost's men farther north, the Shoshones were inclined to be
friendly.</p>

<p>He learned of curious beliefs, and was inspired with what
amounted to real curiosity to find out whether these beliefs were
general or local to these tribes.</p>

<p>For example, the custom of scalping. It seemed that scalps were,
to these people, not merely a trophy of prowess. To scalp an enemy
meant annihilation of his soul. If a man was killed, but not
scalped, he became for all eternity the servant of his slayer. Each
was condemned to suffer forever in the future life the mutilations
inflicted in this. It was a dreadful doctrine; but it explained
many things. That was why a brave enemy was scalped, but a cowardly
enemy, sometimes, was not. One can manage a cowardly servant, but
not one of sufficient spirit. The soul of a dead man escapes
through his mouth: so that one who meets death by strangulation is
earth-bound. A man killed in the dark dwells eternally in darkness,
which is why, the priest explained, it is bad medicine to attack
before dawn. These things were intensely interesting to Andy, and
he told them to his companions. Joe was not impressed.</p>

<p>"Look out you don't git to be an Injun, Andy," he warned.
"That's bad medicine for shore. Oh, yes," he acknowledged, as
Andy's glance strayed toward Flying Woman, "Injuns is good enough
people sometimes. But they ain't white folks."</p>

<p>In all the careless idle concourse of the river bottom Sublette
and Jedediah Smith alone were preoccupied with responsibility. They
examined carefully the combined resources of peltries brought in by
the various bands, counting and listing the beaver skins available
for trade, not only by the white trappers but by the Utahs and
Shoshones. Closely familiar with Ashley's affairs, they had a very
accurate notion of what would be required to save the enterprise
and set the company in a sure solvency for another season's trade.
Their conclusions were discouraging. Although the total catch was
an imposing one, the St. Louis commitments were heavy. Furthermore,
they must consider the returns as practically complete. The parties
still out under Ashley's direct command were small. Andy Burnett's
report of their condition when he had last seen them had not
indicated they would bring in any appreciable number of pelts.
Smith and Sublette agreed that the outlook was not brilliant, but
they shared their anxieties with none, and the happy-go-lucky
picnic in the valley of the Green continued on until the appointed
date was at hand.</p>

<p>Then, unexpectedly, Ashley returned; and at his tail a long
ragged procession that continued and continued to emerge from the
rimrock until fully half a hundred men had come into view, and with
them a swarm of laden pack animals. As they rode nearer Ashley was
recognized; and Provost; and the American trappers who had started
with them. But who were these others? They were a wild-looking lot;
but wild in some subtle alien fashion. Small differences in
equipment or in arms did not escape the appraisement of sharp eyes,
to be sure; but the strangeness was not a matter of externals
merely. Its outward seeming came from within. They were definitely
foreigners. A few wore red sash belts, and by these the wise ones
identified them.</p>

<p><i>"Canayens,"</i> said they. "Hudson's Bay men."</p>

<p>The strangers bunched together as they neared the encampment,
riding in soberly after the American trappers who had already
charged away in their impetuous fashion. At the river they turned
off to one side and began to erect their lodges and unpack their
numerous horses.</p>

<p>Ashley greeted Sublette and Jedediah Smith aside from the
general jubilation and row. He was in high spirits, blowing away
his associates' immediately expressed anxieties with a laugh.</p>

<p>"See there!" he cried. "Over by the river! Fourteen thousand
five hundred beaver skins! And prime! You never saw better! Ogden's
men come in to trade with us! Our troubles are over!"</p>

<p>"How did you get them?" marveled Smith, who knew the breed.</p>

<p>"Told them what I'd pay," said Ashley simply.</p>

<p>"And what about Ogden?"</p>

<p>Ashley's face became exaggeratedly expressionless. He stared
straight before him.</p>

<p>"There are several ways of skinning a beaver," said he.</p>

<p>That might be. How this beaver was actually skinned has always
been made a mystery; though desertion because of discontent is an
adequate explanation. Whether because they were ordered to silence,
or because there was really nothing more to tell, Ashley's men
never went beyond the General's statement. Andy learned nothing
further from them. But he heard plenty elsewhere, especially in
later years. The stories varied. Ashley had found Ogden destitute
and had taken his furs for the relief of his necessities. This was
probably a confusion with Jedediah Smith's performance with the
Iroquois. He had stumbled on a cache of Ogden's furs and had
appropriated them. This was likely an offspring of the trappers'
resentment against the British invasion.</p>

<p>"Got no business pushin' so fur east. Their kentry's out
Columbia way&mdash;let 'em keep out of our'n!"</p>

<p>The same sentiment was responsible for the story that it was a
plain hold-up, a robbery by force. The disparity of numbers was
glaring; though one might believe almost anything of the audacity
of hard-bitten mountain men. But outside of that the yarn is
absurd. Such a high-handed performance would have been shrieked
aloud through the halls of international diplomacy. As a matter of
fact, neither the Hudson's Bay Company nor Ogden himself ever went
into details.</p>

<p>Andy heard these stories as of certain knowledge from people who
never crossed the Missouri until years later. He grew tired of
denials and speculations. The most absurd was that Ashley had
debauched and stupefied Ogden's men with whiskey and laudanum. This
continued to exasperate him to the last.</p>

<p>"How could he?" he cried, "The General had cached most of his
trade goods at the rendezvous. He lost most of what little he took
with him when his boats upset. Where would he get whiskey?"</p>

<p>At any rate, the beaver was skinned. Fourteen thousand five
hundred, prime. These, with the season's catch of the various
parties, were not only sufficient to lift Ashley's debts, but
assured him a comfortable fortune. The Rocky Mountain Fur Company
was a going concern.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>They dug up the cache and carried its contents to a great lodge
that had been erected to serve as a store. This did not take long,
for there were many willing hands. They stacked the flat wooden
kegs, with their sides curved to fit a pack animal, reverently in a
corner, patting them affectionately. There were two piles. The kegs
of one contained genuine whiskey; the other "spirits," which meant
plain alcohol. The latter were in the majority. This was the most
compact form in which liquor could be carried, for it could be
"cut," diluted down with water as far as the traffic would bear. It
was the usual trapper and Indian tipple. The whiskey was reserved
for the more important officers&mdash;or those who cared to pay a
very high price.</p>

<p>It was announced that trade would not begin until next day.
However, in the meantime, a vessel of liquor was prepared of
diluted alcohol "on the prairie," gratis. Certain of the Shoshone
and Utah chiefs were summoned and included in this ceremony. Their
tin cups too were full, but the dilution was greater than in the
case of the white men. The Little Burgeway justified this to Andy.
Andy enjoyed the Little Burgeway. He was indeed little: a rotund
active man with a high voice, but decisive for all that.</p>

<p>"Liquor affects Injins more than white men," said he, "so it
<i>ought</i> to be weaker."</p>

<p>Andy and Jim Bridger had been appointed by Ashley to assist, not
only in this first free distribution, but also in the trade to
follow next morning. He had noticed that neither of these lads had
helped themselves as freely as the others.</p>

<p>When the ceremony was over Ashley called them, together with
Sublette, Smith, and Campbell, into the trading lodge. The group
under his direction segregated and laid aside a certain amount of
goods and two kegs of alcohol.</p>

<p>"These are for the Hudson's Bay men yonder," he said. "I want
them carried to their camp immediately." Sublette surveyed the
pile.</p>

<p>"Is that what you're paying for those furs, General?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Ashley nodded. Sublette gave vent to a low whistle.</p>

<p>"I got them practically for a song," said Ashley. "And,
Hachter," he instructed the Little Burgeway, "you get some sort of
receipt. That finishes the transaction."</p>

<p>Hachter grinned understandingly.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Next morning the trade began briskly. Sublette had already
listed the number and quality of each man's pelts; had determined
the value of his credit. For beaver skins he was allowed five
dollars. Two otters equaled one beaver. No other furs were then
considered worth while.</p>

<p>Against this credit the trapper drew for his necessities and
desires. Besides such essentials as powder, lead, caps or flints,
blankets, knives, axes, traps, tobacco and the like, he had,
considering everything, a wide field of choice. If he were
gastronomically inclined he could buy tea, coffee, sugar, flour,
bacon, dried fruit, even raisins.</p>

<p>If he were tired of doing everything for himself he could get
iron, copper, or sheet-iron kettles; cloth or flannel, buttons, and
thread, with which to make himself clothes; bridles, spurs,
horseshoes and nails; handkerchiefs, looking-glasses, razors, soap;
a host of most strange and unexpected items of a civilization long
since faded into remote distance. For those who had squaws was a
wide choice among the "Injin goods," despised by the white
bachelors. And you may be sure the ladies saw to it they had what
they wanted before their white man had balanced his account. For
her there was scarlet cloth and blue cloth, calico and ordinary
cotton; and little bells and worsted binding and beads with which
to ornament. She must, if her man was to save his face among her
people, possesses sufficient vermilion for her complexion, finger
and arm rings, colored kerchiefs, bright ribbons&mdash;a host of
astounding items to be seen in this day and age west of the
Rockies!</p>

<p>Everything was open and aboveboard. As far as money went, a man
knew what he had and what he was going to get. Prices were fixed
and were not varied from. To be sure they were high; but why not?
These goods had come a long and difficult journey, uninsured.
Powder cost two dollars a pint; but it was worth it. And a man knew
what he was getting: he could take it or leave it.</p>

<p>That was for white men. When their wants had been
supplied&mdash;or their credit exhausted&mdash;and it came to Injin
trade, that was different. Then figuratively the price tags were
removed. That's where the trading came in. Sometimes you could get
a prime beaver skin worth six dollars for a pair of steel bracelets
that had cost a dollar a pair; and a drink of diluted alcohol
amounting to, perhaps, ten cents. The alcohol came first. It took
only an accurate clerk to attend to white trade: it required a
shrewd reader of desires to handle the Injins to the best
advantage.</p>

<p>Hachter possessed that tact and that shrewdness. Interested in
this phase of his business, Andy volunteered to continue his
assistance, and was accepted. His duty was to parcel out or to
weigh out the commodities each desired, while Hachter computed the
prices against the credits. This was not a very complicated job.
Each man knew accurately what he wanted as far as necessities went:
the variety of other things was not so extensive that it took long
to make a choice. Nevertheless each customer liked to dawdle, to
linger a little. Hachter kept them moving without appearing to do
so and without offending anyone's sense of his due leisure. Each
invariably ended his purchases with a small quantity of liquor,
which he took away in a canteen or a gourd or perhaps a bladder.
This was usually whiskey. The kegs of alcohol stood almost
untouched.</p>

<p>A few of the men had very little credit; in some cases none at
all. The anticipated cards had been busy the evening before. Beyond
the limits of their credit Hachter advanced the barest necessities
only&mdash;powder, lead, caps, tobacco, perhaps new traps or
knives. This was a debt, to be repaid next year. He refused
anything else. Andy was surprised to discover in the rotund little
man with the squeaky voice an uncompromising decisiveness. One or
two of the rougher men were inclined to bully it a bit. But Hachter
paid them no attention.</p>

<p>When the last of the trappers had finished this preliminary
business a messenger was sent to the Indian villages to announce
that trade was open. The entire red population moved up&mdash;men,
women, children, and most of the dogs. Some, a minority, carried
furs for barter; possibly an equal number, mostly women, stuck
close to them to see that their desires too were considered in the
exchange; the majority merely came along for the ride, or on the
off chance of begging something, either from the whites or the more
affluent of the Indians themselves. All these people squatted
themselves silently in a ragged half-circle in front of the trading
lodge. They did not speak; they did not move; they stared. In the
lodge opening sat Hachter. He did not speak; he did not move; he
stared back. A nirvanic aloofness seemed to have replaced for all
eternity the former bustle and activity. Nothing at all happened
for at least half an hour. Then Standing Wolf, the Shoshone chief,
abruptly arose, stalked across the intervening space, and flopped
down at Hachter's side. The latter filled a pipe, lighted it,
passed it to his visitor. Turn and turn about they smoked. When the
tobacco had been burned out, Hachter signed to Andy. The latter
brought forth one at a time the items of the present Hachter had
determined upon as appropriate to the occasion, and laid them
before Standing Wolf; namely and to wit: fifty rounds of ammunition
for that potentate's old brass-bound fusee, eight small plugs of
tobacco, a knife, a package of vermilion, and a yard of cloth for a
breech clout. He added, after a proper pause, a handful of bright
beads, and a length of figured black and white cotton cloth known
as a "cotillion."</p>

<p>"For your woman," signed Hachter as to this contribution.</p>

<p>Standing Wolf made no sign of satisfaction, though this was a
magnificent present even for an important chief. But his lady was
not so stoical. She came forward; gathered up the plunder;
retreated, with every symptom of frank delight. Standing Wolf was
next presented with a standard-sized liquor cup filled to the brim
with so stiff a mixture that his eyes moistened as he gulped it
down. After which he retired in favor of the Utah chief, with whom
the process was repeated.</p>

<p>All this deliberate ceremonial consumed time. By now it was near
sundown. But the trade had begun and it must continue. Men came
forward with bundles which they silently opened for inspection.
Hachter sorted over their contents, appraising the skins, a slow
and careful process, for he must make no mistakes in quality. In
the meantime the Indian, invariably with a squaw at his elbow, was
inspecting the assortment temptingly displayed. She talked a lot:
he made no sign that he had even heard her. When Hachter had made
up his mind the bargaining began. The white man gave in barter just
exactly what he had to, and no more. But first he offered each new
customer a cupful of the stinging trade liquor. Occasionally he
refused to deal, and bundled the would-be seller out, furs and
all.</p>

<p>"He'll be back," he told Andy, "when the liquor works."</p>

<p>But one man at a time was admitted to the trade lodge.</p>

<p>Jim Bridger stood outside to see to this. He and Andy seemed to
be the only two, besides Hachter, to feel any responsibility to the
occasion. In the trappers' camp bright fires burned, about which
moved dark figures. Ashley, Sublette, Smith, Campbell, old
Fitzpatrick, the leading figures of the enterprise, had retired to
the privacy of Ashley's lodge. In these modern days they probably
would have been reported "in conference." They had taken with them
the supply of genuine whiskey for safe keeping. Hachter was very
grateful for the assistance of the two young men.</p>

<p>"You boys are a help," he squeaked, "and I surely appreciate
it."</p>

<p>"Did you expect to do this alone?" asked Andy incredulously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd handle it," the trader assured him. "Sublette is going
to relieve me later. And if he's too drunk there's always Jed
Smith. He's religious, sorta. He don't drink. Consarn those wolves;
they've took all the good whiskey. I could do with a little drink
right now myself. I'm getting tired, sorta." He turned to shake his
head decidedly and to hold up three fingers as a counter proposal
to the deliberate bargain of the moment. A sudden curiosity beset
him. "Whyn't you boys join the celebration?" he asked. "You aren't
getting paid for this."</p>

<p>"I want to see how she's done," replied Bridger. "May want to do
some tradin' myself some day." Andy nodded; he had no present
intention of going into the business, but his curiosity was
catholic. And this scene was fascinatingly full of color, the
wavering fire flames, the spread array of trade goods, the
blanketed savage, the play of light and shadow on metal, bright
color and gleaming eyeballs.</p>

<p>"Here," said Hachter, coming to a sudden decision. "You take
charge for a few minutes. Kick that fellow out if he gets
funny."</p>

<p>He disappeared. The customer prowled about. Only once did he,
tentatively, reach out as though to pick up some object for
examination; but withdraw his hand at Bridger's growl. Hachter
bustled in, carrying a coffee pot. He set out three liquor cups and
carefully filled them to the brim.</p>

<p>"No thumbs in this, boys," he said cryptically. "I think we've
earned this, though it don't pay to drink on this job. Whiskey's
good; but it makes you too bold." He tossed off his portion at a
gulp. "They're having quite a party over there," he confided,
wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. "Can't blame them. Best
trade I ever saw. They'll be rich men. Wish I was on shares. Oh,
well!" He looked at Andy and Bridger. "What's the matter? This is
the good stuff. I took it away from those wolves over there. They
can't hog it all. Don't you boys drink?"</p>

<p>The two looked at one another, embarrassed. "Sometimes," said
one. "Not just now," said the other.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact both Andy and Bridger were always remarkable
for their sobriety in a wild age and a wild country and in
consequence were occasionally, but very temporarily, underestimated
by rough and unthinking strangers.</p>

<p>"Well," observed Hachter, "Jed Smith's religious, too." He
carefully poured the contents of the two cups back in the coffee
pot.</p>

<p>A white man entered, thrusting aside the hesitating Indian buyer
of the moment.</p>

<p>"Gimme four gallons," he demanded brusquely: then, as Hachter
turned to consult his book of credits, "Oh, I'm good for it!"</p>

<p>"I suspect so," agreed Hachter equably, but without hurrying his
search.</p>

<p>"Whiskey," added the trapper.</p>

<p>"No whiskey," said Hachter, without looking up. "Not till
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>Hachter jerked his head toward the leaders' lodge, The visitor
swore gustily.</p>

<p>"Well, make her Panther P'is'n then. But mind ye, none of yore
Injin mixes, yo' little runt."</p>

<p>"Run along and have yore party, Mulford," squeaked the Little
Burgeway, impatiently.</p>

<p>Mulford's eye fell on Bridger and Andy.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys," he invited hospitably. "My treat! Big
doin's'!"</p>

<p>"So do," advised Hachter. "Things will go slow for a while now.
I aim to snatch me a little sleep."</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Drunken men are immensely diverting to themselves and to one
another, but not very amusing to one who remains sober, or nearly
so. Mulford's party was not so bad at first. The men sipped the
liquor from the conventional or standard liquor cups, and talked or
sang. The quality of the talk and the singing became the more
pleasing to its participants in exact ratio to its actual
deterioration in quality. Two or three talked at once, and the
others listened just sufficiently to catch a cue to begin their own
bragging. These ordinarily silent, direct men held forth after the
manner of Homer's warriors. Each had a lot to say about how brave
he was and how many hardships he had suffered and how many narrow
escapes he had had. Each had killed dozens of Indians and hundreds
of grizzly bears. Each was paramount favorite with the Indian
girls; could outdrink ary man on earth. Each possessed the
fastest-riding animal, without exception, that had ever been
foaled. Even Joe Crane, carried away by mob psychology, claimed
loudly that distinction for Buggs, his rawboned mule. This gained
general attention, expressed in a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"Wall, anyways, he's the stiddiest," Joe had to back down from a
position too absurd even for alcohol.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the peace of the company these wild claims came
in bunches, so that nobody really paid any of them any
attention.</p>

<p>"An ef'n you don't believe what I'm sayin'," each concluded his
recital, "I'll prove it!"</p>

<p>The proof offered was medieval in spirit. The protestant was
ready to run a race, or wrestle a fall, or shoot at a mark, or
fight if preferred. One comparative pacificist was willing to leave
the question of his integrity to a game of "cold sledge" with the
cards! Only occasionally now did some particularly picturesque
narration catch general attention for a few moments. As when Old
Man Goddard opened up on a real&mdash;or mythical&mdash;voyage he
had made toward the Southwest. The Southwest was then the land of
mystery. Nobody knew quite what to believe of it. Old Man Goddard
gave them plenty of material for choice. His leathern old
countenance never changed expression; his lank jaws seemed never to
cease their slow champing on his quid; his steady, young blue eyes
calmly&mdash;and successfully&mdash;challenged expression of
disbelief. He had traveled with a certain Jules Lefourey, who was
dead, but on whom he constantly called for corroboration. "Ef'n
Jules were yere now, <i>he'd</i> tell you!" asserted Old Man
Goddard convincingly. (For the details of these tales I am indebted
to Ruxton and Neirhardt.) "Ary man here ever see a carcagne?"
enquired the veteran. "Wall, they's a plenty down yander. Talk
about yore grizzly b'ar!" The old man's expectoration of contempt
completely quenched an aspiring young flame in the fire, "Why a
carcagne'll jump right into camp, and you settin' thar by the fire,
and grab yore meat yo're roastin' and make off so fast yo' don't
see nothin' but a streak, like a lightnin' flash made out of
shadder. I seen one once plain, though. He had a head and shoulders
like a wolf, and the rest of him was b'ar."</p>

<p>"Did you shoot him?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>Old Man Goddard turned, surveyed the lad deliberately for a
moment, and turned back.</p>

<p>"Not this child," he condescended to reply, after a crushing
silence. "He's bigger than a buffalo bull. And when he yells, I
tell you, everything <i>stops!</i>"</p>

<p>He chewed rhythmically. They waited.</p>

<p>"They's some white Injins down in that kentry," he resumed at
last. "They live in a big city on a perairie in the mountings. The
tops of their houses is all made out'n pure gold. The cliffs all
around is about two thousand foot, straight up. They kain't git out
of thar, and nobody kin git down. Munchies, they call them."</p>

<p>Gold roofs! They pricked up their ears. Injins&mdash;even if
white! Might be pickings there! They pressed eagerly, even though
somewhat skeptically, for details.</p>

<p>But Old Man Goddard veered off, became vague, discouraging,
changed the subject as soon as he could. He'd tried to go back.
Never could find the place again. Took some men with him. Clumb
half the high peaks in Ameriky but couldn't find hide nor ha'r of
them. Spent months at the search. No use.</p>

<p>At this the skepticism became vocal. Old Man Goddard fired up.
If they didn't believe him he had a Munchie coin he had found top
of the cliffs. Jules, who was raised scientific, said it had Latin
words on it. The coin? He'd lost that when he was raided by Apaches
back in 1817. But, he hastened to change the subject, the strangest
thing he'd seed down thar was a putrefied forest!</p>

<p>"What's that?</p>

<p>"A putrefied forest," repeated Old Man Goddard firmly. "Sure as
my rifle's got hind sights! It was dead of winter. One day we
crossed over a divide and came on a perairie whar was green grass
and birds singin' and leaves on the trees! This was February, mind
ye. Our hosses was like to die when they see the grass. Hurrah for
summer doin's, sez we. I ups with old Ginger and clips the head
of'n a grouse. I finds it was stone. And Jules lets drive at a
cottonwood with his axe <i>shurk-k-k,</i> and off snaps a piece of
the blade! We looks at the hosses standin' thar shakin' like they
was cold, an' I'm doggone if'n the grass isn't stone too, and it
bruk off like the stems of clay pipes! Jules was raised scientific,
like I sez, and he says it was putrefied."</p>

<p>"Didn't she smell bad, then?" asked someone after a tactful
silence.</p>

<p>"Smell bad!" Old Man Goddard snorted contemptuously. "Wasn't
they froze? A polecat wouldn't smell bad ef'n he was froze! And
what's more," he added, "ef'n you don't believe it, I brung away a
piece of the wood."</p>

<p>"Lose that when the Apaches raided you?" asked someone
dryly.</p>

<p>Old Man Goddard favored the questioner with his slow stare. Then
deliberately he fumbled in his "possible" sack and produced a bit
of petrified wood which he offered for inspection.</p>

<p>"See," he pointed out. "She's got the bark on her, Wagh!"</p>

<p>They passed the fragment from hand to hand. There it was,
indubitable. It was too much for them.</p>

<p>"Let's have another drink," someone proposed. They crowded
forward. Old Man Goddard chewed away in his slow rhythm. It was a
moment of triumph, but his leathern countenance did not change.</p>

<p>Andy and his new friend Jim Bridger were enjoying the show. They
had not been able to dodge the initial proffers of the Panther
P'is'n without giving serious offense. The harsh liquor warmed
them, expanded their hearts and their appreciation. Old Man Goddard
was a wonder! Hachter was a wonder! Jedediah Smith was a wonder!
Everybody in the world was wonderful! Jim Bridger told of his visit
to Salt Lake and how surprised he was to find he could sit upright
in the water without sinking. That was a tremendous joke on old
Jim! They dissolved in laughter over the joke. They could not get
over it. And just as they had managed to reclutch their gravity,
Jim added that the shores stank. That set them off again. Somehow
that extra detail was just too much! It was irresistibly comic.
Mulford stood before them.</p>

<p>"Drink her up!" he was insisting. "Drink her up, I tell ye. Do
you want to make me out a ringtailed gollywop, at my own
party?"</p>

<p>Somehow it seemed highly undesirable to make anyone out a
ringtailed gollywop, if it could be avoided. So they accepted the
brimming liquor cups and drank her up, as requested.</p>

<p>The lights were bright; the singing sweet to poignancy; the
conversation brilliant, though a trifle confused. A great many
wonderful things were awaiting a trifle of focusing. This could be
attended to at any moment, but was not quite worth while. It was
pleasanter to bask in the large general comfort of expanded
consciousness.</p>

<p>But now Andy felt a considerable attention directed his way. He
concentrated. Joe Crane was capering about, doing his imitation of
a crowing cock, leaping into the air and clapping his heels
together three times before hitting the ground. He was bragging at
the top of his lungs; but for once not about himself. Andy realized
at length that he was the subject. That was why he had been called
to concentrate. He listened gravely.</p>

<p>Joe was boasting most particularly about Andy's shooting. He
detailed a few of what he claimed were the boy's most notable
feats. Some of them were based on facts: some were pure figments of
invention. It did not matter; for in both cases the results were
the same. Of the innumerable Indians Andy had slain in battle not
one but was took plumb atween the eyes; of the thousands of animals
he had laid low few were killed save on the dead run and at extreme
distances. Whenever anybody hooted a doubt, Joe met the situation
by the simple expedient of increasing the range.</p>

<p>Andy listened in a spirit of detached appraisal. The precise
instances Joe was shouting had somehow escaped Andy's memory for
the moment. Doubtless they were in that large and expanded area of
his consciousness which he had not focused. But he approved gravely
of the general trend of the recital. He was filled with an
over-mastering indignation at the derisive skepticism of some of
the audience. It made him mad that anybody should doubt good old
Joe! That idea took charge of him. The fact that this was a
question of his own prowess escaped him completely: Andy was a
modest lad by nature. But to imply that good old Joe was a liar! Or
that Knock-em-stiff, the historic Boone gun, could not drive a nail
as far as you could see it&mdash;or farther! Andy was on his feet,
vehemently backing Joe.</p>

<p>They laughed sarcastically; and the more they laughed the more
the point at issue swelled until it filled the universe with its
importance. At length Joe, with a wild whoop, leaped the fire and
disappeared in the darkness. But the laughter at his apparent
retreat had hardly died when he was back, brandishing the long
rifle.</p>

<p>"Yere ye be, Andy!" he cried. "Load her up; load her keerful.
We'll larn 'em! Wagh!"</p>

<p>Andy seized the piece and the horn and shot pouch.</p>

<p>To his surprise he found that this loading business had been
left out in that unfocused area. He had to use tremendous strength
of mind; tremendous concentration to bring it in. And when he had
moved the process of measuring the powder, placing the patch,
driving home the bullet into definition, it became tremendous. The
simple movements necessary assumed a spaced and pompous
deliberation that took all his vital forces to attend, crowding
aside to a periphery infinitely remote from all else that the
universe contained. When the loading was finished Andy returned
ponderously to the immediate surroundings as from a distance. That
was the way things were moving now; ponderously.</p>

<p>Joe was flourishing a small billet of wood, possibly six inches
square.</p>

<p>"Plug her, Andy!" he cried. "Plumb center! Lam these yere
beavers what shootin' is!"</p>

<p>He capered away to the limit of the flickering illumination
thrown by the fire, faced about, and thrust the bit of wood between
his knees.</p>

<p>"Thar ye be!" he cried. "That's what I think of Andy's shootin'.
Plug her, boy!"</p>

<p>"Sure," muttered Andy, "I'll plug her."</p>

<p>He raised the Boone gun and tried to take aim. The sights seemed
dim, and somehow confused. The silver bead of the front sight
divided, moved apart until there were two beads, drew together
again until there was but one. This was an interesting phenomenon,
which Andy paused to consider curiously and with entire detachment.
Its bearing on his present effort did not concern him at all. The
hind sight too was acting queerly. It expanded to twice its natural
size, blurred into a fuzz, and then contracted. This too was an
intriguing prodigy of nature. While Andy was still contemplating it
the reflex habit of his trigger finger discharged the piece.</p>

<p>He came into full possession of his faculties with a shock. Joe
was capering about holding up the split billet, which had been sent
spinning from between his knees, and which he had retrieved. In
some miraculous manner Andy's sure instinct had functioned without
his knowledge or volition. He stared about him a moment, then
lurched into the darkness and was physically sick.</p>

<p>On trembling legs he staggered to his lodge. His brain whirled,
but he had become suddenly and entirely sobered. He threw himself
on his blankets and covered his head, trying in vain to shut out
the clamoring vision of what by grace of Providence he had escaped.
Flying Woman, Joe's Squaw, was bending over him solicitously.</p>

<p>"Napi-awh-ki&mdash;white man's water&mdash;no good," said she.
"You sleep."</p>

<p>"No good," agreed Andy with a groan. But he could not sleep. Too
vividly he was haunted by the picture of Joe, his kneecap
shattered, lying here in this lodge, a thousand miles in the
wilderness. Outside, the sounds of the revel surged and fell like
the beat of a storm.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-6" id="ch2-6"></a>CHAPTER 6. Rendezvous
(<i>Continued</i>)</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THE great spree at the Green River continued. That does not
imply a continuous state of top inebriation on the part of
everybody. The thing rose and fell like a tide. But somebody was
always whooping it up; just as somebody was always just falling
asleep, or waking up, or eating, or quarreling, or pulling off a
little private concert of his own. Nobody was ever completely
sober. On the other hand, few were so drunk as to be out of
control. These iron men could consume astonishing quantities of
liquor before the effects became apparent.</p>

<p>Such was not the case with the Indians. One measuring cupful of
even the much-diluted trade liquor seemed to awaken to life a
personality hitherto dormant and unsuspected. That personality
demanded, with all the strength of the most imperative instinct, an
immediate and continuous repetition of the dose to the point of
stupefaction. It was, once aroused by the first drink, a craving as
insistent as that of a drug addict. There was no question of
denying it, or of controlling it. More liquor must be had, at any
price, at any hazard. After two or three drinks Hachter was able,
by judicious denial, to get almost anything he dared ask for the
alcohol mixture he dispensed. Nor could he buy now with any other
goods. That trade was finished, as far as the Indians were
concerned.</p>

<p>The business was for the most part of "consume on the premises."
Andy Burnett, sobered and scared by his narrow escape the night
before from crippling his best friend, avoided the trappers for the
moment, and helped the Little Burgeway. The lodge was continuously
crowded with Indians, in all stages of drunkenness, jostling and
elbowing, thrusting forward their offerings in barter, each
demanding instant attention. Hachter had barricaded himself behind
a rough counter. He was perspiring freely, and looked tired; but he
kept his head amid all the confusion, and retained control in a
loose sort of way; sensing the temper not only of the crowd but of
the various individuals, thrusting back some, beckoning others
forward, guiding the situation with sensitive fingers as one guides
wild horses. Andy had not been there five minutes before he
realized that there was a lot more in this trading business than
merely passing out some things in exchange for others.</p>

<p>Hachter was grateful for both his help and for his company. He
kept up a running conversation of comment, in relief from long
nervous tension. It developed he had a definite philosophy of
intoxication.</p>

<p>"Long as you keep things running along smooth, Burnett," said
he, "you won't have any trouble. An Injun is good-natured enough;
and they're mostly all alike. White men are different. Some get
crying drunk; some get quarrelsome; some get singing drunk; or
sentimental; never can tell, unless you know them. An Injin is wild
and noisy, but he ain't mean. Only thing is, he's touchy. Got to
watch out his feelings don't get hurt. Can't look cross-eyed at
him. Got to keep your eyes shining. If he gets his back hair
sticking up because he thinks you're neglecting him, then watch
out! Keep looking 'em over, and spot the ones that think they've
been waiting long enough."</p>

<p>While he was talking Hachter never ceased activity for a moment,
flipping open the offered peltries, abstracting what he decided was
the price of a drink, after a keen appraisal of his customer's
condition. The offer was an ultimatum, take it or leave it.
Sometimes, but not often, the Indian attempted to haggle, but
half-heartedly. As a usual thing the savage seized the cup and
drained it without further parley, swept up the rest of his
belongings, and gave way to the next.</p>

<p>Hachter drew the liquor from one of several kegs placed on the
counter. The contents of the kegs varied in their degree of
dilution. The drunker the Indian the weaker the liquor served him.
Andy noticed that in some cases Hachter thrust his thumb into the
cup, diminishing by that much the amount that it contained. He
understood now the mysterious interchange of the day before, when
the Little Burgeway had offered himself and Jim Bridger a drink,
and had assured them that there were "no thumbs in this." Once or
twice Hachter reached below the counter for an especial cup, Andy,
examining it, found that melted tallow had been poured into the
bottom to cut down its capacity. He ventured, hesitatingly, to
doubt the strict honesty of this procedure.</p>

<p>Hachter was astonished.</p>

<p>"Why," said he virtuously, "too much liquor is bad for
Injins!"</p>

<p>It was a grinding, exhausting, nerve-racking business;
especially as the Indians grew drunker, more "touchy," and
therefore more inclined to quarrel. All were armed. At times
tension was stretched fine, close to the breaking point. One savage
in especial, a brawny creature with his face painted black, became
more and more truculent. He thrust others aside, bullied them,
shouted, danced about. Hachter could do nothing with him. The
little man was annoyed.</p>

<p>"He'll have 'em all going," he complained to Andy in his high
voice.</p>

<p>"Don't give him any more," suggested Andy.</p>

<p>But Hachter shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'd hate to risk that," said he. "Guess I'll have to fix
him."</p>

<p>He stooped beneath the shelter of the rough counter for a
moment.</p>

<p>"Here, you big idiot," he said in English, "take that."</p>

<p>The bully seized the proffered cup and drained it at a gulp. He
brandished his warhawk, lurched about, shouldering aside those in
his way. Hachter watched him anxiously. But in a few moments his
movements became more uncertain. He groped his way toward the
entrance to the lodge, but changed his mind, lay down on the
ground, fell sound asleep. Nobody paid him further attention. They
stepped over and around his prostrate body until finally, finding
him too much in the way, someone rolled him through the door into
the open.</p>

<p>"Laudanum," Hachter briefly answered Andy's question. "Don't
know how I'd make out without it." He wiped the perspiration from
his forehead.</p>

<p>The noise and the heat were terrific. Andy's head swam. It was a
nightmare.</p>

<p>A white man entered, thrusting the crowding Indians aside
unceremoniously. They gave way without protest. It was Joe Crane on
the crest of the wave.</p>

<p>"Sot her out, old timer!" he cried. "An' see you give me good
stuff!"</p>

<p>"You giving the party, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Wagh!" agreed the trapper. "Done lost her on a hoss race.
Hullo, Andy. Come on!"</p>

<p>Andy demurred. He was horrifiedly off parties after last night's
experience. Joe seemed to have forgotten all about it.</p>

<p>"I promised to help Hachter," said he.</p>

<p>Joe would have none of it.</p>

<p>"Hachter's gittin' on all right, ain't you, Hachter?" he
asked.</p>

<p>He reached over to grasp at the little man's neckband. "Come on,
you little runt," he cried. "Close up shop for a while and come to
my party."</p>

<p>Hachter avoided him.</p>

<p>"All right, Joe. I'll be there pretty soon. You run along and
start things." He caught Andy's eye. "I'll bring Burnett. You run
along."</p>

<p>"Wall, see you do, or I'll be back to git you!" promised Joe,
aiming a playful blow at the Little Burgeway that would have
knocked him through the back of the lodge if it had landed. He
shouldered the keg and lurched out.</p>

<p>"One side, you red devils!" he shouted at the Indians.</p>

<p>They gave way, laughing, shouting back, then crowded forward
again. Hachter looked after him and sighed.</p>

<p>"I'll give that fellow some laudanum too if he don't watch out,"
said he. "Lord, I'm tired!"</p>

<p>Sublette thrust himself through the Indians.</p>

<p>"How you making it?" he asked. Andy had not laid eyes on him
since the day before when he and Ashley, together with Robert
Campbell and Jedediah Smith, had disappeared into the General's
lodge together with the keg of real whiskey. He was surprised to
see that the young man was clear-eyed and alert, in full command of
all his faculties. Evidently the party was not quite as "some" as
Hachter had implied; at least as far as Sublette was concerned.</p>

<p>"Pretty good," said Hachter.</p>

<p>Sublette looked at him keenly.</p>

<p>"You're about played out," he accused. "You ought to have been
relieved long ago. But there isn't a man who knows anything about
it sober enough to trust. Think you can hold out another two hours?
Some mighty important questions we've simply <i>got</i> to decide;
and the General is set on getting away."</p>

<p>"I reckon I can," agreed the Little Burgeway.</p>

<p>But Sublette was not satisfied.</p>

<p>"Your eyes are like holes in a blanket," said he irresolutely.
"You've got to have rest. Here: I'll take charge. You go get you a
sleep. Stop on your way and tell the General."</p>

<p>Hachter started to protest. Andy intervened.</p>

<p>"Let me," he suggested.</p>

<p>Sublette's piercing gray-blue eyes swung to meet his.</p>

<p>"I'm sober," said Andy. "And I'll remain so."</p>

<p>"What do you know about this business?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," acknowledged Andy, "except what I've watched and
seen. But I'm willing to try. I know Indians pretty well."</p>

<p>"That's right. I remember," Sublette nodded. He hesitated a
moment, then produced two silver-mounted pistols from the belt
around his waist. "Take these; but don't use them unless you have
to.... Come, Hachter. Nay, man, I insist!"</p>

<p>Andy found himself alone, trading liquor with the Indians.</p>

<p>The situation was disconcerting, ridiculous. Andy had placed
himself in it on impulse. Now he could not get out of it. He was no
teetotaller, and had no general convictions on the subject of
liquor. Nevertheless he had sense enough and stability of character
enough to see what too much liquor could do to a man. He had had a
demonstration of that the evening before when, under the influence
of Panther P'is'n, he had shot the bit of wood from between Joe
Crane's knees. He shuddered at the memory of it. He was getting a
pretty good second demonstration of what it could do now. Hachter
was giving less and less of weaker and weaker tipple in exchange
for the skins. Andy had tacitly pledged himself to a continuance of
the policy. It looked perilously close to cheating. Hachter did not
seem to think so: neither did anybody else. It was accepted trade
custom, sanctioned by long use. What alternative? Give them full
strength in full value? That certainly <i>would</i> put them crazy,
or out! No use thinking of trying to trade anything but liquor now;
they would not have it. No use to refuse. Dangerous. They would
tear the place down. Besides, it was his business to get the fur.
The whole thing was too complicated for Andy's simple and direct
mind; so he did as he usually did&mdash;heaved overboard the whole
question, and addressed himself to the immediate present.</p>

<p>He got on surprisingly well. The Indians liked him.</p>

<p>Still it was no sinecure. Trade was brisk. Some of the savages
were near the point of irresponsibility. Their eyes rolled in their
heads, and they brandished their weapons in a muddled and
purposeless abandon that might easily become dangerous. Andy
watched them anxiously. He fingered the vial of laudanum; but he
had no idea of the dosage. He should have thought to ask Hachter.
He did not want to kill anybody.</p>

<p>Joe Crane was in the lodge, very drunk, and one or two others.
He had come to find out why Andy and Hachter had not come to his
party. Hachter's absence at first claimed all his attention.</p>

<p>"The little runt!" he cried. "Whar be ye? Yo' kain't hide out on
me."</p>

<p>He was determined that Hachter must have concealed himself
somewhere in the lodge for the express purpose of insulting Joe.
The trapper insisted on searching the place, ferreting about under
the bales of furs, behind the kegs, rummaging over the few
remaining trade goods, prying into nooks and crevices too small for
the concealment of a chipmunk. He was a nuisance, getting in the
way, scattering things about in confusion and in temptation of
theft by the Indians. Andy expostulated in vain. Finally, when Joe,
failing everywhere else, showed symptoms of an intention to cut
open the carefully pressed bales of peltries, Andy had to jerk him
away bodily, and none too gently.</p>

<p>With a howl of outraged astonishment Joe whirled on him.</p>

<p>"Yo, goddam white-livered farmer yo'!" he shouted. "I'll cut
yore heart out!" and fumbled at his belt for his knife.</p>

<p>Some tension snapped in Andy. He hit Joe squarely on the point
of the jaw, and behind the blow was all the force of long-pent
exasperation and nervous strain. The trapper went down like a
log.</p>

<p>For the split fraction of a second the affair hung in balance.
Anything might have happened. What between the drink-crazed savages
on the hair line of outbreak, and Joe's two inebriated and
truculent companions, there was the making of a very pretty
massacre. But Andy's rage swept it away, beat it down, scattered it
in all directions. Like most deliberate natures, he was slow to
anger, but blind to consequences once aroused. He forgot all about
the silver-mounted pistols in his belt. By the sheer blast of
dynamics he drove them out of that lodge, red man and white; and
they tumbled before him like frightened schoolboys. It was most
unorthodox. If William Sublette had been there he would have said
it could not be done. Possibly it had never been done before.</p>

<p>Then Andy went back and sat down and gradually subsided, and was
filled with compunctions and a small but growing alarm. Joe: one of
his best friends in the world! And what would happen now? What
would the Indians do, once they had recovered? What, for that
matter, would Joe's friends do? Everybody was pretty drunk. Andy
was not thinking much of himself. But he had been left in charge;
and this was how he had handled things! He was very downcast.</p>

<p>What should he do? Call Sublette and the others?</p>

<p>That was the sensible thing&mdash;before anything more serious
happened. Indeed, it was almost the obligatory thing. But Andy's
slow and dogged obstinacy forbade. He had started this; he would
see it through come hell or high water. His straight level eyebrows
drew down. He seated himself on a keg and waited.</p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p>Gradually his tension of exasperation relaxed. He went to the
door of the lodge and looked out. The capricious and simian
inconstancy of drunkenness had passed him by for the moment. Joe's
two companions had brought him to with a gourd of water in the
face; whereupon that hardy citizen, filled with some new idea, had
staggered off to try it. The Indians, their heads awhirl, had
weaved their way to their own encampment to beat up a squaw or so,
or race a horse, or fall asleep as the case might be, Andy was
completely forgotten.</p>

<p>The scene was animated, to say the least, and noisy.</p>

<p>Obstreperous mirth; whooping, howling, quarreling, singing,
mounted Indians dashing into and through the encampment, yelling
like fiends; the barking and baying and snarling and howling of the
savage wolf dogs; the incessant <i>crack! crack! crack!</i> of
rifles, and the occasional <i>whamboom!</i> of a smooth-bore
fusee&mdash;it seemed that the very cup of the heavens must be
reechoing with the row and the racket. But that mystic and poetical
sense with which Andy had been compensated for some of his slower
qualities knew better. Only just aside awaited the wilderness. Its
serenity absorbed, hushed, deadened like felt. Undisturbed and
unaware, the mountains brooded on in the unfolding vision of a
million years. Deep in the clear waters of the river the trout and
the grayling and the whitefish hung motionless against the current.
Frog voices and whippoorwills intoned their unhurried accompaniment
to the largo of the evening skies.</p>

<p>Strangely comforted and relieved of his anxieties, Andy returned
to his upturned keg.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Night fell and the evening wore on. Indians returned, demanding
more rum. Andy served them. Gradually the lodge became again the
center of potential trouble. Hachter did not show up, and Andy
could not leave his charge unprotected in order to search him out.
He had to do the best he could. The brawny savage with his face
painted black had recovered from the dose of laudanum and was back
again. He swaggered and threatened and was apparently always on the
point of making real trouble. Andy wished he knew the Shoshone
language. Only the Indian habit of supplementing talk, even with
members of their own tribe, by fragments of sign language
occasionally gave him a clue as to what it was all about. The big
man flourished his warhawk, shot arrows into the ground at his
feet. Andy became wholly fed up with him. At length the continuous
strain brought its reaction. He fell into a fatalistic mood. If the
fool went too far Andy would give him a ball from one of Sublette's
silver-mounted pistols. Until then, let him rave.</p>

<p>And anyway another crazy idiot showed up who seemed a much more
immediate threat. This was a small man, with vermilion stripes
painted across his face. He rushed into the lodge, a knife in his
hand, talking at a great rate, and obviously very angry. Darting
toward Andy he tore and cut and slashed the turf at the young man's
feet; and then rushed out again. Andy watched him narrowly, his
hand on his pistol butt. The incident passed off without further
trouble. But in ten minutes the Indian was back, repeating the
performance; and at intervals thereafter all the rest of the
evening. It was nerve-racking. Andy never knew what instant he
might work himself up to actual attack. But always he confined his
warlike demonstrations to the inoffensive sod. After a dozen
repetitions Andy was strongly tempted to tap him on the head with
the butt of the pistol and have it over with. But he held unto
himself. It would never do to precipitate a row. He wished heartily
that Hachter would return.</p>

<p>And just about as he had reached the limit of patience and was
dangerously near to ruining the trade and his reputation as a
trader, Hachter was back, very apologetic.</p>

<p>"I just fell dead asleep and couldn't seem to wake up," he
explained. "This is hard business sometimes. It wears on a
man."</p>

<p>"I know that!" agreed Andy fervently.</p>

<p>"Any trouble?"</p>

<p>"No real trouble. Close to it at times. There's one little fool
that comes just short&mdash;here he is now!"</p>

<p>The vermilion-painted savage was back, dancing and howling,
flourishing his knife, finally tearing and slashing the ground at
Andy's feet.</p>

<p>"That's the one! I'd like to have one crack at him!" pleaded
Andy.</p>

<p>Hachter spoke to the man in Shoshone. The man replied briefly,
then dashed out, whooping and yelling, still on high. Hachter
laughed until he had to wipe his eyes.</p>

<p>"What's the joke?" demanded Andy at length.</p>

<p>"Why, he's your friend!" cried Hachter. "He says he's been
protecting you all the evening!"</p>

<p>"Looks like it," said Andy kicking a toe at the slashed-up
ground.</p>

<p>"He says he was showing how he was going to treat your enemies
if they bothered you!" and Hachter at the sight of Andy's face went
off into another paroxysm of laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" cried the lad disgustedly. "I'm going to bed."</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>By next morning things were very considerably off the boil. Andy
had slept the sound sleep of one nervously drained dry. He had not
known when the noise had died down. Now he lay on his back in the
lodge, staring up at the white wood smoke eddying fantastically
across a bar of sunlight. From the branches of the big cottonwood
just outside came the soft contemplative crooning of mourning
doves. Over beyond, a pony nickered sharply. Clear-voiced meadow
larks experimented with new songs. Beneath the accents of sound the
river gabbled in a hurried and confidential undertone. In contrast
to the red-shot murky pandemonium of the night before, this was
full of peace, and Andy soaked it up as his bodily tissues soaked
up the first water after a desert "scrape."</p>

<p>By and by he turned on his side and looked about him.</p>

<p>Joe was back, and sleeping. Flying Woman was moving about. She
caught Andy's eye, and smiled at him. Andy yielded to a sudden
impulse.</p>

<p>"Pai-o-toki, come here," he commanded. "I want to talk to you.
Sit here. Now," he resumed, as she sank to the robe at his feet,
"tell me this. Why do you not drink napi-awh-ki, the white man's
water?"</p>

<p>"Blackfeet do not drink napi-awh-ki," she replied primly.</p>

<p>This was something Andy had not known, although he had twice
wintered with that people. But it was a fact. Later the use of
liquor was reserved for the chiefs. Still later the Blackfeet went
to the other extreme. Which might, or might not, be made into some
sort of argument as to inhibition, prohibition, and the like.</p>

<p>Andy pondered. His mind worked slowly but very surely. He was
verging toward some sort of idea.</p>

<p>"But the women of the Shoshones, they do not drink napi-awh-ki,"
he proffered.</p>

<p>"It is the business of man to fight enemies and to bring game to
the lodge," said Flying Woman. "It is the business of woman to feed
her man, and make for him robes and clothing, to take care of what
her man brings her. Is not that true?"</p>

<p>She paused for Andy's assent.</p>

<p>"If a man brings in no meat; if he runs away, leaving his lodge
and his woman to be taken by the enemy, then he is no man. He may
not sit in council. If a woman leaves the meat that her man has
brought in to spoil, or her man to sleep beneath ragged robes or
wear mean garments, then she is no woman. Is not that true?"</p>

<p>"This is true," acknowledged Andy. "But I asked&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now think of this, I-tam-api," pursued Flying Woman. "If the
man hunts the beaver and brings them in to the lodge, is not that
the same thing as bringing in the black sand for the gun, and the
white man's cloth, and the knife, and the axe, and the red paint
for his face, and the kettle for his food, and all the other things
which the white man gives for the skin of the beaver? Is not that
the same thing, I-tam-api?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," agreed Andy.</p>

<p>"Well, then!" Flying Woman completed her simple logic. "If the
woman drinks up the beaver skin, instead of buying these things, is
not that as though she left the meat to spoil?"</p>

<p>Andy surveyed the small earnest figure with admiration.</p>

<p>Joe sat up with a prodigious yawn. They turned toward him.</p>

<p>"Ef'n yo' could bring in yore river I could drink her dry,"
confided Joe.</p>

<p>Flying Woman, understanding his gesture though not his words,
presented him with a gourd. He drained it with noisy gulps and
flung it aside. "That shines!" he cried. "Some doin's!" said he,
"How yo' feelin', Andy?"</p>

<p>"Fine," said Andy. "How are <i>you</i> feeling, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Wall," confessed Joe, grinning ruefully, "<i>purty</i> fair. I
made me a big diskivery, Andy, that I never knew afore."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Sleepin' is very bad fer a man. Wust thing a man kin do."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?"</p>

<p>"I've proved it," stated Joe. "Looka yere; last night I was
feelin' fine, top of the world, never better. This mornin' I'm
feelin'&mdash;well&mdash;not so good. What's happened atween last
night and this mornin'? Nothin', exceptin' that I been asleep. So I
tell ye, sleep's bad for humans!" He rubbed his jaw thoughtfully.
"I'd like to know who done this to me."</p>

<p>"I did," said Andy.</p>

<p>Joe turned to survey him in astonishment. "You, Andy! Was yo'
drunk?"</p>

<p>"I was cold sober. And, Joe, I'm just sick about it."</p>

<p>"Tarnation! Wall, it feels like it was a good one!"</p>

<p>"Joe, you don't know how sorry I am."</p>

<p>"Wall," said Joe, "ef'n you done it, and ef'n you was cold
sober, I must have been needin' it bad."</p>

<p>He thrust aside the buffalo robe, arose to his feet, shook
himself vigorously.</p>

<p>"Didn't nothin' drop off?" he enquired. "Wall, I reckon I'm all
thar! Let's marvel out and view the survivors. Some doin's! Wagh!"
He chuckled. "Didn't poke Jack Kelly too, did ye?"</p>

<p>"Was Jack drunk, too?" asked Andy, with a faint shock of
disappointment. Somehow he could not associate. Kelly's compact
efficiency with that sort of thing.</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said Joe, equally astonished at the question.
"Whar was yo'? Last I see of him he was makin' a speech or speakin'
a piece, or somethin'. Old he-coon of a speech, too, only it was in
some furrin language so we missed the cute of it."</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>The encampment had fallen back to a quieter pace.</p>

<p>Men lay about in the sun; gossiped, yarned, made plans, played
cards, drank a little. They had a good time. Nobody was bothered
with regret or remorse. Those admirable sequences of debauch are
largely physical, and these iron men could not be affected so
easily. Indeed their psychic equilibrium was rather comfortably
stabilized. The whole affair was in the nature of a safety valve,
blowing off pressures stored by hardship and danger and unremitting
tensities. I think no element of morality was involved. Andy's
instinctive perception sensed this and gave it just valuation; but
his simpler rational powers were not sufficient to lift him from
puzzlement. So, as usual, he gave it up.</p>

<p>Downriver the Shoshones and the Utahs were drifting sullenly
away. They had no more skins to trade. They were even more
instinctive than Andy. All they knew was that their peltries were
gone.</p>

<p>The leaders, Ashley, Sublette, Smith, Campbell, perfected their
plans apart, Hachter yawned in the trading lodge, attending to the
spasmodic trade that still persisted. Men with credit remaining
filled out their needs or their ideas of luxury. A very few, Andy
among them, arranged for deposit of the surplus in St. Louis. There
was considerable card playing. When enough felt energetic there was
horse-racing, wrestling, target-shooting. Fresh meat was supplied
by specified hunters. They made a game in determining who must
perform this task. A pipe was filled with tobacco, lighted, passed
from mouth to mouth. Each must take from it three visible puffs.
The man in whose hands it happened to burn out completely had to
furnish the meat. Its distribution was affected in an orderly
manner. The animal brought in was thrown down before the Little
Burgeway's lodge, and there cut up under his supervision. The meat
was then divided into piles, their number corresponding to the
number of messes, a mess for each four individuals. This
accomplished, the first passer-by was halted and instructed to turn
his back. Hachter laid his hand on one of the piles. "Who shall
have this?" he demanded in a loud voice. "Number six," replied the
arbiter at random; and to mess number six it went.</p>

<p>Thus there was no favoritism.</p>

<p>In the evening things livened up. Somebody with credit remaining
usually gave a party. Until the last evening of the rendezvous
these parties never came near to equaling the first burst of
reaction. Nobody got drunk; that is, not very drunk; but everybody
was comfortably "prime." They told stories, or sang, or played
games of chance. Kelly's recitations were very popular. They liked
to listen to him as he drew from his college lore fine old rolling
ballads of Scott's, or Milton's sonorous lines. They even urged him
to repeat some of his "furrin stuff," and relished with a childlike
appreciation of beat and cadence the Latin of Vergil or the Greek
of Homer. But Kelly had to be "prime" before he would oblige, after
which he sat in a black meditation which shrugged aside intrusion
with a savage impatience.</p>

<p>But now these days were finished. Ashley had perfected his
arrangements, had traded for enough horses to transport his furs.
The trappers began to give mind to their own plans, to prepare
leisurely for their far-flung scattering until the next rendezvous.
That, it was decided, was to be in Cache Valley, the pleasant
game-haunted vale which Jedediah Smith had discovered up yonder, to
the northwest, and where he had ventured the season before. It was
a bold fling, away from the old grounds, out toward the vague
region purported to be controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company. The
old opposition they had left far in the rear, over the eastern
horizon: new lands, new explorations, new rivals! Their eyes shone
in anticipation.</p>

<p>Fifty men were to set out with Ashley on his journey; of whom,
however, thirty were to bring back the horses after the General had
reached the river and so would have finished with them. Among the
twenty who would continue on to St. Louis were Sublette and
Jedediah Smith; but they were immediately to return. To the
surprise of both Joe and Andy, Kelly announced his intention of
joining the party. Kelly's black mood had been growing on him.</p>

<p>"I've been in the mountains now a good many years," he told them
curtly. "I must go back."</p>

<p>He would not argue with them.</p>

<p>Of the other men, each&mdash;or each group&mdash;had his own
ideas, his own pet park, or hole or trapping district. Joe, with
Flying Woman, was going back to the Blackfeet for the fall hunt and
the winter. Andy made up his mind to accompany them. A quiet season
with his old friends appealed to him after nearly two years'
absence: He wanted to see Kiasax again, Nit-o-ké-man. He wanted to
see how the Little Warrior had grown. At the thought his heart
warmed within him. He did not think of the beaver.</p>

<p>Each man, before he set out, was required to go to Hachter, the
Little Burgeway, and from him receive a statement of his credit.
Few of them wanted to do so, or desired the statement.</p>

<p>"Sure, she's all right: I'll take yore word for it," said
they.</p>

<p>Nor did Ashley himself attach any great importance to the
procedure: he was perfectly aware how little documents counted with
these men. But that was the quirk in Hachter's methodical mind; so
he was humored.</p>

<p>Andy found himself in company with Mulford, the man who had
given the first big party when Andy had nearly shot off Joe Crane's
legs. Mulford was grumbling about the necessity of wasting time on
such foolishness. Andy was poking fun at him.</p>

<p>"What's time to you?" he asked. "Where you going that you're in
such a hurry?"</p>

<p>"Wall, I got a long way to go," returned Mulford. "I'm aimin' to
trap 'way over yander. And besides, how about Hachter? Ain't it
wastin' time for him, makin' out all them dozens and dozens of
bills? Makes my head ache to think on 'em."</p>

<p>"Oh, he likes it," said Andy. "Where did you do your trade last
year?"</p>

<p>"Didn't come out. Got ketched in a windfall and bruk my laig,
and had to layover."</p>

<p>"Then you brought in a two years' catch," observed Andy.</p>

<p>"Part. Got raided year ago last spring and lost part of my
spring ketch. Then I had to get out of that kentry and cross over
the mountings..."</p>

<p>He went on, encouraged by Andy's genuine interest, to unfold one
of those long stories of persistence, hardship, suffering, and
sheer dogged courage which never failed to enlist Andy's profound
admiration; and this in spite of the fact that the lad's own
experiences had by now equaled the best of them. Somehow he had
never quite the same point of view toward his own adventures. They
were just part of life. These others were heroic. In fairness it
should be added that Mulford did not see them so. He was just
exchanging the time of day. He did not think he had come out so
badly. He had lost two toes in a blizzard, and had had about a
third of his furs lifted. He had not starved much, except just now
and then. But what could a man expect in a country entirely
unknown?</p>

<p>"I got her located now," he told Andy. "She'll git me more
beaver next year. I brung in a hundred and twenty pounds, all
prime."</p>

<p>About six hundred dollars for two years' work! The thought
brought Andy up short for a moment, He had never considered it in
quite those terms before. He ousted it with an effort, turned his
back on it, refused it mind room. Next thing he'd be looking at his
own situation sensibly.</p>

<p>Hachter had Mulford's account ready, and handed it to him. The
trapper stared at it, frowning, his lips moving slowly, as he
spelled out the items. When he had came to the end he looked up
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Shore this comes out right?" he asked, hesitating.</p>

<p>"What is there about it you don't understand?" asked the Little
Burgeway. "Aren't the items correct? Here, let me see."</p>

<p>"No, I reckon they're all correct," said Mulford hastily. "I
ain't doubtin' you got 'em down all right. Anyways, I wouldn't know
if you hadn't. But I kind a thought I'd have&mdash;Mind if Andy
added her up fer me? He's got book larnin', too."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," agreed Hachter. "He won't make it any
different."</p>

<p>"No, I reckon not," said Mulford deprecatingly; but he thrust
the paper into Andy's hand. Andy read the document slowly. It ran
in part as follows:</p>

<p>JULY 2&mdash;Liquor $8.00, Feast $4.00, Ditto $4.00, shirt
$8.00.</p>

<p>JULY 3&mdash;Liquor $11.00, Feast $2.00, knives $4.00, powder
$12.00, balls $18.00, flints $1.00, tobacco $15.00, kettles $5.00,
ax $3.00, trap springs $16.00, blanket $12.00, sugar $2.00, coffee
$18.00, tea $10.00, suit clothes $70.00.</p>

<p>"That's the day I bought my possibles," observed Mulford, over
Andy's shoulder. "Looks all right, though I was a leetle drunk, and
can't be shore." The account added a number of other
items&mdash;thread, hard biscuit, salt, handkerchiefs, awls, a tin
cup, some rice, and the like. After that the statement continued
with a certain brief monotony:</p>

<p>JULY 4&mdash;Liquor $14.00, Ditto $3.00, Ditto $12.00, with an
occasional "feast $4.00" by way of punctuation.</p>

<p>The last item ran:</p>

<p>Liquor and keg $27.00.</p>

<p>"I aim to take that with me. Mout want to do a leetle light
drinkin' come winter."</p>

<p>"You'll have it all drunk up afore you're two days out,"
predicted the Little Burgeway.</p>

<p>"I mout," agreed the trapper placidly.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do about this?" asked Andy puzzled.
"What do I know about it?"</p>

<p>"I just want to know if it's right, what it says there, at the
bottom. Does that mean I ain't got nothin' more comin'? Don't seem
reasonable with all them beaver; Add her up fer me, Andy."</p>

<p>"Little less than nothing, Mulford," corrected Hachter dryly.
"You owe the company a little. But, of course, that's all
right."</p>

<p>Andy sat down to the job. Hachter watched him sardonically. Andy
was no expert accountant; and his "book larnin'" was of a more
sketchy character than Mulford suspected. After losing track three
times of how much to "carry," he gave up exact balances in favor of
a more or less rough estimate.</p>

<p>"Looks all right to me," said he, returning the invoice.</p>

<p>"Is that so! Wall, wall!" Mulford was plainly non-plussed. He
stared at the bit of paper as though accusingly for a moment, then
with a grin oriented himself to this unsuspected state of
affairs.</p>

<p>"Oh, well!" he cried jauntily. "Easy come, easy go!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-7" id="ch2-7"></a>CHAPTER 7. Lowered Swords</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THE next three years after the first rendezvous in the Green
River comprised in many ways the golden age of the Western fur
trade. To be sure it had been carried on, and successfully, for
many years before. The Nor'-westers, the Astorians, the Hudson's
Bay Company, other organizations east of the Rockies had written
brilliant pages of history. And it was destined to continue as a
major interest for nearly twenty years to come. But the exploits of
the Ashley men had in them a dash of knight-errantry that lifted
them almost into the realm of myth and fable.</p>

<p>The success of Ashley's company was spectacular. It upset all
the steady close-figuring authorities in the St. Louis fur markets.
Not only did his yearly expedition bring back beaver skins in
unbelievable quantities, but their quality was such that the term
"Ashley beaver" came into use as a synonym for the top grade. Men's
minds were fired as later imaginations kindled over the stories of
California gold. The equanimity of the great and old-established
fur companies was disturbed: they prepared to push farther back.
New, wildcat companies of adventurers were formed in all parts of
the country and among all classes of men. Some of them were
composed of reckless irresponsibles. But back in New England,
Nathaniel Wyeth, the son of an old Boston family, left his ice
business to gather together twenty-four solid Puritan citizens and
to set out, trusting in Providence and native common sense, to do
business in the Rockies. Even such foredoomed affairs of ignorance
had no difficulty in filling their ranks. As for Ashley and
Sublette, they were overwhelmed by applicants. They could pick and
choose. About this time an advertisement appeared in a Missouri
newspaper that:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"&mdash;a boy about sixteen years old, small
of his age, but thick set, light hair, ran away from the
subscriber, to whom he had been apprenticed to learn the saddler's
trade...All persons notified not to harbor, subsist, or support
said boy under penalty of law. One cent reward will be given to any
person who will bring back said boy.<br>
<br>
DAVID WORKMAN."</p>

<p>The boy against whom Mr. Workman made this magnificent one-cent
gesture of disdain was named Christopher Carson. There were many
such.</p>

<p>The whole frontier east of the Rockies was restless and astir.
The rival companies were coming more closely to grips. The American
Fur Company had built its string of forts up the Missouri Valley,
was consolidating its trade, was trying&mdash;as yet in
vain&mdash;to push into the Blackfoot country. Kenneth Mackenzie
came in on its behalf from the upper Mississippi. He was brave and
enterprising, hard, severe in discipline, fond of pomp and display,
jealous of his dignity. He wore always a uniform, affected great
state, invited few to his table; but beneath the pomp and
circumstance he was shrewd and vigilant to extend his company's
power. On the whole he succeeded well. The frontiersmen respected
but hated him. His men were loyal and secretly a little proud of
him, but feared him like the devil. He had no regard for human
life. Hearing of an attack by Indians on one of his trading
parties, his first inquiry was as to the horses. It seemed that the
horses had all been killed or driven off; but every man was
safe.</p>

<p>"Damn the men!" said Mackenzie. "If the horses had been saved,
that would have amounted to something!"</p>

<p>If an employee became crippled beyond usefulness, he was turned
out, or made to feel so unwelcome that he left. Even the Indians
took pity on some of these men. Lapenteur tells of finding Joe
Ramsay thus among the savage Assiniboins. In spite of these
qualities, or perhaps because of them, Mackenzie's administration
prospered. Visitors of importance found him most hospitable and
charming.</p>

<p>Doubtless he was harassed by emergencies at which we cannot
begin to guess. The country was becoming overrun by itinerant
independent traders. They were worse than the organized and
responsible companies. The latter would be dependent, as was
Mackenzie himself, on government license to trade, which could be
revoked for cause. The small independent traders came anyway.</p>

<p>Some of them had what Mackenzie called the impudence to build
little log posts of their own within a mile or less of the
company's forts. Mackenzie did not dare run them out by force.
Everything he did must be at least in color of law. It was illegal
to sell the Indians liquor. Later it was illegal even to bring
liquor into the Indian country. Nevertheless no trade could be done
without it. It is probable that the big companies might have
abandoned its use could they have done so. But if one man used
liquor, the rest could do nothing. "Liquor we must have, or give
up!" wrote a trader to his chiefs, in despair.</p>

<p>These individual traders tried to undermine one another as well
as cut into the business of the larger companies. They played petty
politics among the tribes. Each supported some favorite sub-chief
of his own, from whom he hoped influence. That made for dissension
among the Indians themselves. Each vilified the others to the
savages, so that gradually a general impression gained strength
among the Indians that all white men were bad. Did they not tell
bad things of one another?</p>

<p>Few of such irresponsibles lasted long. When it carne to running
out opposition Mackenzie gave his own traders carte blanche,
instructing them to pay anything for beaver, without regard to
profits, and to use any necessary amount of liquor. Thus in some
instances he paid as high as twelve dollars for pelts. It became a
simple matter of who had the most resources; and as to that there
could be no question. But it was expensive.</p>

<p>"It has cost me something to secure the Indians to me!"
commented Mackenzie ruefully.</p>

<p>Once he had broken one of these smaller rivals, he was very
cocky, and would not even listen to offers to sell out. But often
headquarters, at St. Louis, was more politic, and bought in some of
the more important ex-rivals, to Mackenzie's openly expressed
disgust.</p>

<p>Some of the independents who had thus failed in the business
took service with the company; some set out as trappers; others
wandered restlessly from tribe to tribe. "Indian killers" became
more numerous. Men joined certain tribes temporarily so that they
could go to war and indulge in this propensity. They looked on all
Indians as "varmints" to be eliminated on sight. They made for
trouble wherever they went. The prairies were becoming more and
more uncertain, more and more dangerous.</p>

<p>The posts built by the company were fortresses, with blank outer
walls, enfilading bastions, a narrow passage commanded by cannon
between an outer and an inner gate, all dwellings and stores and
shops facing in toward the spacious enclosure. They were capable of
withstanding any siege by Indians. Within them was a whole
community of activities; presided over, in considerable style, by
the overlord and his associates. There was here no necessity for
the extreme of rigorous simplicity imposed by the wilderness. We
hear of linens and silver and fine wines and a sort of feudal
dignity. Hamilton, the Englishman, at Port Union, each year
received boxes of fine clothes from England. He went polished,
scented, and oiled, with ruffled shirt fronts, a gold chain about
his neck, and always a colored silk handkerchief hanging from his
pocket. To him all Indians were beasts. He was rumored to belong to
a noble family, and that Hamilton was not his real name. We hear,
as time goes on, of distinguished visitors, lavishly entertained at
one or another of the company's posts&mdash;Audubon, the
naturalist, Prince Maximilian of Wied, many others. They came in
with the spring boat, and lived in the upper story of the fort with
the commandant and his clerks. Above them, on the battlements, were
the Indian women and the children of the whites. About the
courtyard, whose center was occupied by the huge hide press, French
<i>engages</i> beat out the skins and pressed them into packs.
Along the walls lounged the trappers and traders, gossiping,
smoking turn and turn about the long-stemmed native pipe, gambling
at cards. Someone played, rather sweetly, a lute. Their Indian
wives strutted about, gay in paint, beads, bells, bangles, the
"foofaraw" of trade. Hunters came in with deer and buffalo. Indian
dogs hovered about the open gates, eager to enter but afraid to do
so. Beyond them a fringe of lurking coyotes. Against the outer
walls leaned Indians, clothed in buffalo robes, sulky, forbidden to
enter unless invited to do so. A six-pounder commanded the gates.
Other six-pounders, and some smaller pieces, perched on the walls.
In one of the bastions stood a brass telescope through which the
sentry could examine the distance for suspicious-looking signs. If
he discovered any such, he must signal the herdsmen and the
woodchoppers in time. Not that attack on them might reasonably be
expected, even from tribes normally hostile. They wanted trade, and
would not be likely to spoil the chance of it. Whiskey, or what
passed as such, could be had, a pint for each beaver skin. A pint
made one good drunk.</p>

<p>In the bottomlands, below the fort, the distinguished visitor
could see the teepees of those tribes. Sometimes there were a great
many of them, as high as fifteen to twenty thousand. They were for
the moment friendly because they wanted to trade. Nevertheless the
visitor would be wise not to visit too freely the encampment: at
least, not without suitable and experienced escort. There was
always a chance that some young fool had just purchased his pint.
Better to study them when they carne into the post.</p>

<p>Usually they were moderately reliable, and might be admitted in
small groups into the main court. But if there was any doubt, they
would not get beyond the vestibule between the outer and the inner
gates, whence they must deal through wickets. In any case the
six-pounder was ready for action. The life was colorful,
interesting, but so confined that in time it became monotonous. To
be sure there were, but a short distance away, marvelous swarms of
game. The post's hunters were continually out among them after
meat. Nothing could be more thrilling than a hunting trip. But it
was dangerous. A man could not go alone, or with too few
companions; not unless he was very experienced, and then only in
daily peril of his life. Each notable had his shy at it, of course;
but the necessary preparations were so elaborate that these
excursions were never many times repeated. Better leave that to the
paid hunters. There was plenty to interest one at home, what with
the trading, the coming and going of trappers and partisans, the
endless councils with the chieftains.</p>

<p>These were unending. Each week, almost each day, brought its
quota of visiting native dignitaries. They ascended the short
ladder to the sacred second story, and sat about on the floor of
the big room, and smoked ceremoniously, and drank of the trade
liquor offered, and talked their business in slow spaced speeches.
Yellow Wolf reports trade to be had at his village; a partisan must
be sent there. He-Who-Jumps says that the Comanches, heap mad, have
dug up the hatchet, and warns the whites away from their country.
Peeled Lodge Pole has come in to excuse his people, who have stolen
some of the fort's horses, and promises there will be no repetition
of the offense. He claims he speaks with a single tongue. And after
the last of these had gone, there were the long discussions, over
the evening port, of the company's affairs and policies and plans.
When one from the outside had lived for a time in the busy intimacy
of the post's microcosmos, there grew in his mind an exaggerated
idea of its all-pervasiveness. Its power and influence seemed so to
fill the land as to give an impression of an administered and
occupied country. This was an illusion. The spaced and isolated
posts were connected with one another, and with their parent
civilization on the lower Missouri, by the slender umbilical cord
of the River. Through its channel flowed their life. Outside them,
untouched and untamed, was what for decades to come was to remain
the Wild West.</p>

<p>Nevertheless a network was being slowly spun, its strands wide
apart and slender, but ever more comprehensive. Fort Union was as
yet the outpost. But Mackenzie was looking farther
afield...Repeatedly he urged his directors to allow him to cross
the mountains. As often they denied his requests. "Let the others
break the ground," they stated their policy, "then we will move in
and occupy. Await the moment!" Restrained in this direction,
Mackenzie made repeated attempts in the direction of the Blackfoot
country. They failed.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>In comparison with this restless stir of the germ of a new
civilization east of the Rockies, the Ashley men, west of the
Divide, were still in an earlier historical period. It was as
though the great mountains were a barrier in time, damming back the
steadily mounting flood of a new era. There the mountain men
wandered singly, or in small groups, over a vast extent of
unexplored country, rummaging out their beaver streams, losing
themselves for months in the parks and passes and defiles of the
ranges, reappearing for the period of their rendezvous, squabbling
or fraternizing with tribes not yet made actively hostile, meeting
unknown deaths, accomplishing unknown triumphs, only vaguely aware
of the rising tide beyond the barrier that must soon absorb them
into a new life or thrust them aside. Comparatively few in actual
numbers, their accomplishment was nevertheless astounding, not so
particularly in their rich harvests of fur as in the wide fling of
their wandering.</p>

<p>The winter after the rendezvous at Green River passed. Spring
burgeoned forth. Gradually the scattered bands closed in to the
next appointed meeting ground, in beautiful Cache Valley, northeast
of Salt Lake. It was a large gathering this year, over a hundred
white trappers, many of whom, like Joe Crane, had Indian wives.
Many of them had wintered near the mouth of Weber River, together
with over a thousand Shoshones, or Snakes, who had, as a tribe,
decided to be friendly. Thence they had explored Salt Lake in bull
boats; and had helped the Snakes in a little exercise battle with
the Blackfeet in which everybody fought until they got hungry and
then called it all off in favor of a feast. Many of the Snakes came
to rendezvous. By July Ashley had arrived, having dragged with him
a six-pounder brass cannon, the first wheeled vehicle to cross the
Divide. Andy Burnett and Joe Crane had ridden in only a few days
before. They had wintered with their friends, the Blackfeet. It
would have been nearer and handier for them to have made their
annual trade with either the Columbia or the American Fur Company,
down the river; but they were mountain men, and remained loyal to
their kind.</p>

<p>The take of beaver skins was this year rich beyond all
precedent. Counting his profits General Ashley realized that he
possessed an independent fortune. After consultation with his
associates he made an announcement.</p>

<p>He had sold out to William Sublette, Jedediah Smith, and another
named David Jackson. He was going to retire from active trading in
the mountains and realize a long-cherished ambition to run for
Congress. That did not mean, however, that he severed all
connection with the enterprise. He would continue to represent the
company in St. Louis: he would dispose of the furs sent in, and
would buy for them their supplies. He would not perform these
services for anybody else. He concluded by thanking them all in the
most heartfelt terms for their loyalty. They were stunned. Were
they not "Ashley men"? In that name had they not greatly dared
beyond their own ununited capacity? For the moment they felt
scattered. The "Gin'ral" had been their symbol of cohesion. For the
moment they could not rally to the mere abstraction of the
"Company." Some of them remembered the terrible mid-winter journey,
the perilous descent of Green River in the bull boats; recollected
Ashley's fortitude and courage and persistence. They were much
affected, much moved. Jim Beckworth, the mulatto, wept openly, and
no man's derision called him to account, then or thereafter.</p>

<p>But after the first flattening of dismay they rallied.</p>

<p>Both Sublette and Jedediah Smith were some he-coons at that!
Dave Jackson was all right too. Leastways he was a good proper
mountain man. Later they named a Hole after him, up under the
Tetons. And the Gin'ral wasn't quitting them completely. He was
back of them still, keepin' an eye on things. Hurrah for the Rocky
Mountain Fur Company! They all got drunk to equalize their mingled
feelings! They saw Ashley off on his long return journey, cheering
wildly and firing their rifles in the air.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>The new partners put their heads together. They were in
practically undisputed possession of a vast extent of rich trapping
country. The Snakes were friendly. The British, over the sunset
horizon, were inclined to attend to their Western affairs. Their
excursions up the Columbia were few. Anyway, the mountain men knew
how to handle the British. Hadn't they proved it? The Blackfeet
were still an annoyance. Noone knew when a raiding party might be
encountered. They stole irreplaceable traps, and horses; and lifted
scalps when the chance was favorable. But this was foreign
territory to them also; and they had their uses. Their implacable
hostility interposed a buffer against the pressure of the Astor men
from the East. Surely the mountain men stood in possession of all
heart could desire.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the restless and ambitious spirits of the leaders
were not satisfied with the immediate present. This new district,
as far as the "Grand Lake west of the Rockies," as they called it,
had proved to be a new trapping country rich beyond all
expectation. How about beyond Grand Lake? There seemed to be no
reason why that should not be equally productive. Nobody knew
anything about it. There lay the possibility of future expansion.
The partners talked it over. What wealth of fur might there be
waiting? What mountains, what streams, what paradise of pleasant
valleys untrod by white man's moccasins, unawakened by the echoes
of white man's rifles? And was it not there, in the blue of the
unknown, that the fabled Buenaventura River must rise&mdash;the
mighty stream whose waters flowed westward to empty into the
Pacific? Down its current the furs might be floated to the
Californias, there to be transported to the markets by the New
England trading ships. Big business that! Brand-new! A project to
fire the imagination of these audacious men.</p>

<p>Obviously such a challenge could not be ignored. The main body
of the trappers could attend to Green River, the Bear, the Weber,
the Wasatch Mountains, all the new-found territory. But Jedediah
Smith called for volunteers to go find out. There might be nothing
in it, he warned them. Here was a certainty. They rose to the idea
with a whoop. He had to select his party from a crowd of
volunteers. He picked fifteen. One of those chosen was Andy
Burnett. They set out with fifty horses.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Jedediah, Andy, and Silas Gobel got back in time for next
summer's rendezvous at the southern end of Bear Lake. They had one
horse, one mule; no beaver skins. The horse and the mule were so
feeble they just managed to carry the little camp equipment.</p>

<p>But they had a story to tell. South boldly from Salt Lake. A
barren, open, desert country. Wide-flung, up-rising to horizons
incredibly remote, like the hollow of a great outspread hand. Short
brittle mountain ranges, that looked as empty as pasteboard, bare
of vegetation, but clothed in soft veils of the desert
country&mdash;amethyst, mauve, pearl, lilac; purple-bordered in the
deep canyon chasms&mdash;until the hot noon sun stripped them
naked. Flat-topped mesas, castellated buttes, changing shape
momently as the travelers looked at them, throwing up pinnacles,
absorbing them again, reaching long arms toward one another until
between them arched a bridge, pacing the slow transformations of
desert magic. No life save the jack rabbits and ghost-like
antelope, and the straight-rising columns of signal smoke in the
hills. They ate the jack rabbit and the antelope, and found scant
water high toward the summit of the ranges and sparse forage for
the horses. But the people who had made the smokes they could not
come upon.</p>

<p>Then a small river flowing north which they ascended southward.
On it they encountered a band of Indians clad in rabbit skins,
poor, ill-armed, abject, who looked on the white men with
respectful awe. But there were no beaver, no buffalo. A barren and
unproductive land. The Buenaventura, the trapping country must lie
beyond. So on they pushed; passed the headwaters of the stream;
crossed a divide; came to other headwaters, this time flowing
south. Mountains to the left of them; a sandy desert to the right
of them; perforce they continued down the stream, for water they
must have. There was not much else. Even jack rabbits were scarce,
and the horses became gaunt and weak from lack of grazing. They
wandered widely in search of a mouthful here and there in the
everlasting sameness of cactus and of stunted acrid shrubs. So for
twelve days. Then their stream emptied into another and larger
river. Smith took his bearings, thought it over; and with a truly
marvelous instinct for topography came to a correct conclusion. He
identified the river as the Siskadee, the Green, on which, hundreds
of miles above, he had rendezvoused two years before. Obviously
they had missed the Buenaventura.</p>

<p>What now? Return as they had come? Or ascend the Green back to
their old trapping grounds? Those were the safest, most obvious
things to do. Nothing profitable to be gained in this barren waste.
For some days already they had been living on horseflesh.</p>

<p>They continued on downstream. Perhaps the country would improve.
Perhaps they would find game, beaver again. Perhaps they could cut
the Buenaventura at or near the mouth and follow it back.
Perhaps&mdash;oh, lots of things! They still had the most of their
horses. Hosses ain't so bad eatin'.</p>

<p>They were now, though of course they did not know it, on the
east side of the Colorado River, not far from the Grand Canyon, and
traveling due south. Horseflesh was all very well, but soon they
were down to a minimum of animals for carrying purposes. All of
them had known hunger many times in the past. Now they met it
again, face to face. Nobody knew where this river went, or whether
the character of the country was likely to change. Certainly they
did not want to go south; but water they must have, and they did
not dare leave its course. So south they went. And just as even
stout Jed Smith acknowledged himself "about destitute," they came
to a fertile valley, well timbered, fifteen miles or so wide, in
which dwelt a race of Indians who called themselves Mojaves, and
who bartered with them for more horses and such unbelievable
luxuries as corn, and beans, and pumpkins, and watermelons, and
wheat. The horses they had stolen from the Spanish; the seed of the
food-stuffs they had brought in from Spanish settlements. They were
friendly; and they told the trappers of California.</p>

<p>This was a pleasant interlude. The men rested and ate; the
horses rested and ate. They waxed fat and "sassy," their spirits
revived. At the end of two weeks they had forgotten their troubles
and hardships. With two of the Mojaves as guides they crossed the
Colorado where now the Santa Fe railroad crosses it at Needles, and
again set forth across the formidable desert.</p>

<p>From your Pullman you may follow the next fifteen days of their
travel. Dry; hard; hot; completely barren. Even in later years,
when the route was marked and known, this was a journey of
hardship, of suffering, and of death. For twenty miles at a time,
under the power of the desert sun, they plodded across a crust of
thin white salt, through the surface of which they broke at every
step. They underwent the tortures of a thirst that edged close to
delirium. The horses gave out; laid down: died; and their bodies
were left to parch dry&mdash;the first of many that in later years
would mark the trail. But they arrived. Late in November they stood
on the summit of a pass just south of Cajon looking out across blue
distances to the west. They were alive; and well. They had their
long rifles and their traps, and the most valuable of the trade
goods, and eighteen horses of the fifty they had started out with
and of those they had bought from the Mojaves.</p>

<p>But here were water and strong grass. The blacktailed deer
bounced and bounded down the chaparral-clad slopes. Before them
slumbered the valleys of California.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>The tall mountain men rode down the pass, into the valley,
spying curiously about them. They noted the huge herds of cattle
and horses, the flocks of sheep. They wondered at the Indians they
encountered, mainly because they were so entirely different from
the Indians they had known. One of the savages guided the little
party to the mission of San Gabriel, where they camped.</p>

<p>Here was a fluttering in the sleepy old dovecotes of the
mission! The advent of these buckskin-clad frontiersmen, with their
long rifles and their scalping knives and their compact, hard,
efficient attitude, caught the good fathers all aflutter. Not
knowing what else to do they caused a cow to be killed and cornmeal
and wine to be brought for the men, and invited Jedediah Smith
himself for supper, where he sat at a well-appointed table and had
a variety of things to eat, with wines, and a sup of whiskey, and
cigars. Even their simpler fare was sheer mad luxury to the
trappers, and it is recorded that "they feasted heartily, as they
were pretty hungry, not having had any good meat for some
time."</p>

<p>All of which was most pleasant; but was in reality a temporizing
until the padres could find out what to do.</p>

<p>But when their messenger returned from the nearest civil
authority at Los Angeles, they were no better off than they were
before. That dignitary did not know what to do either. It was bad
enough to have to deal with the occasional Boston traders and
smugglers along the coast. What could be the sinister purport of
this invasion from the east? The old army game of passing the buck
is not so modern. Case referred to Governor Echeandia at San Diego.
Nothing doing. It must probably be referred on to Mexico. Exchange
of letters and assurances. Finally Jedediah, losing patience
himself, went down to San Diego to see what he could do.</p>

<p>They did not see him again until the middle of January. In the
meantime life was not so bad. Lacking a definite policy one way or
another, the padres of the mission reconciled themselves to the
idea that they must support these uninvited guests. Possibly they
rather welcomed this clash of barbaric cymbals across the sweet
monotonous flow of their Te Deums. At any rate they gave to the
adventurers of their best; and that best was very good indeed. Andy
ate and drank things he had almost forgotten existed. He stood by
with interest, watching the intricate and varied industries and
activities of the mission people. There were about a thousand of
the latter, mostly Indians. They raised apples, peaches, oranges,
figs. They grew grain and grapes. They made blankets and wine, and
distilled whiskey. They herded thousands of cattle and horses.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful country, with much flowing water and green
irrigated fields, and beyond them the rolling, low, flower-starred
hills where the cattle ranged. And even beyond that the stark, high
fastness of the timbered, snow-clad mountains. That is where the
eyes of the trappers turned. Mout be beaver thar! But until
Jedediah Smith brought permission, they must not move.</p>

<p>Still, not so bad! There was a wedding; and numberless
<i>fandangos</i> and <i>bailes,</i> and parades of the garrison of
soldiers. They could ride; and there were plenty of horses
available. They had certain necessary matters of their own to
attend. The padres presented them with sixty-four yards of shirting
which they gladly accepted, for they were nearly naked. In return,
and at the request of the priest, they fashioned for him, in the
blacksmith shop, a huge bear trap. When it was finished he told
them he wanted it to set in his orange garden to catch Indians when
they entered there at night. Andy found the priests and the few
Spanish residents courteous and interesting. He spent much time in
their company; and, with his usual facility with languages, soon
picked up a fair working knowledge of Spanish. But he was sorry for
the Indians. In comparison with the wild Indians to whom he was
accustomed, these seemed a crushed and broken race. They were ruled
by fear; disciplined severely for the smallest offenses. Andy saw
five of them whipped at the stake for not going to work at the
proper time. They were all five old men, too. Though the Indians
were Christian converts supposed to be held by brotherly love, the
latter quality was helped out by a strong military force with no
fewer than four field guns. Andy liked to draw a little aside from
it all near sunset. From the low rise of a near-by hill, mellowed
by evening light, with the joyous liquid notes of the meadow larks
and the challenge of quail, the mission and its surrounding
buildings seemed to bask in a golden dream. The hordes of Indians
eddying slowly from their work toward the common center stirred a
dust shot with gold. Gold spread its blankets over the hills where
the rich poppies blazed. And golden the vibrating resonance of the
mission bells sounding the Angelus.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>Jedediah Smith was back. He had used his best diplomacy, but he
had not accomplished much. The Governor could not understand this
invasion: he was suspicious of it.</p>

<p>"We were compelled to enter California because we were out of
provisions and water," Smith pleaded. This was stretching it a bit;
but, in the Governor's ignorance, it would do. Nevertheless
Echeandia did not like it. The best Smith could obtain was that the
party would not be jailed and sent to Mexico. He was privileged to
return the way he had come; and he was permitted to buy such horses
and such provisions and such equipment as he would need for that
purpose.</p>

<p>The men set to with a will on their preparations. They had had
about enough of inaction, even in such pleasant circumstances. They
bought and packed provisions, they jerked meat, they fashioned pack
saddles, they did the best they could in a short time to break the
sixty-eight fresh horses. That was a job, for these animals were of
the good Spanish stock, well fed and mettlesome. When, finally,
they started out, the whole outfit broke away and ran wildly eight
or ten miles, packs and all, before they could be headed.</p>

<p>Obeying orders, like good boys, they back-tracked their old
route until they had passed San Bernardino. Then they turned north.
Cut back over all that desert country? Return without a look at the
mountains of California? Just because some greaser told them to?
Besides, there was the Buenaventura. Had to see where that came
out! Maybe, when they found it, they could ascend its course. So
they crossed the Tehachapis, and for three hundred miles they
proceeded leisurely up the great interior valley.</p>

<p>It was spring. The hills and the plains were paint-new with the
incredibly vivid green of the California season, The poppies glowed
like little suns. The wild mustard gilded the outlines and the
crevices in the folded hills. The spread-wide blankets of lupins
mantled the slopes, carpeted the plains. Only the cloudless sky
outmatched in vividness their blue. The air was golden with the
rich notes of the meadow larks; atwitter with the smaller busy
voices of song sparrows in the grass, of orioles and vireos in the
trees; exultant with the wild clamor of innumerable wild fowl that
from every stream and lake and pond and tule swamp rose before the
cavalcade in clouds, with a roar of wings like the falling of
waters. Small hawks hovered, poised on rapidly beating wings;
falcons darted in pursuit with the speed of arrows; vultures and
eagles wheeled in slow-spaced soarings across the remote, leisured
calm of the upper sky.</p>

<p>The plains swarmed with game. Deer in hundreds; tule elk in
thousands; bear everywhere, very tame and scornful; phantom-like
antelope wherever one looked; herds of wild horses, heads and tails
high, nostrils distended, dashing away, wheeling, circling back in
curiosity; the little brothers of the wolf, the coyotes, adding the
voice of the diabolic to the great exultant wild-fowl chorus of the
night; "blacktail rabbits," as the trappers called them, hopping up
and away until at times the whole surface of the ground seemed
alive. Fat doings! They looked eagerly for buffalo, but there were
none.</p>

<p>The plains spread wide and abundant. To their right rose the
high, glittering, and formidable wall of the Sierras, white with
snow. Far along the western horizon ran the Coast Range, blue in a
distance at which they could only guess. Beyond them must be the
California of the Spanish, and the sea. They did not know how far
that might be. Jedediah Smith guessed it might be a hundred and
fifty miles or so.</p>

<p>They took their time, trapping here and there in the foothills
as they moved on. They found a few beaver, in favorable places, but
many more cuttings in the drift, wood on the bars. If only they had
time to explore back farther up the canyons! There must be plenty
of fur under the high peaks. But if they were to get back for this
year's rendezvous they could not linger, and they did not think
then they could stay over a season without being reported to the
Spanish.</p>

<p>The Buenaventura did not materialize. There were several
good-sized streams, but obviously they rose near at hand in the
Sierras, whose ramparts continued unbroken. Finally they gave it up
and turned east.</p>

<p>It was now well into May; but, to their surprise, they
discovered the snow so deep in the high altitudes that they could
not make way through it. They had to return to the valley, after a
loss of five horses.</p>

<p>What next? They talked it over exhaustively. Smith, who did not
readily acknowledge that he could not do what he set out to do, was
still convinced that he could get through with one or two men. He
had agreed to meet Sublette and Jackson and it was up to him to do
so. He announced his intention and asked for volunteers. From those
who offered he selected Silas Gobel, the blacksmith, and Andy
Burnett. Andy was both pleased and disappointed: pleased that he
had been considered worthy of choice; disappointed that he was not
to remain longer in this fascinating country. Those who were left
behind were to await Smith, who was to return immediately after the
rendezvous, with more men and more supplies; after which they would
continue on north to see about this Buenaventura business and the
possibilities of beaver country, and all the rest of it. In the
meantime they could look about in the vicinity. It was not the
prime of the fur at this season, so it was useless to hunt beaver.
If the Spanish got wind of them they would have to handle the
situation according to circumstances&mdash;fight, yield, or flee.
Only they'd better not fight, if they could help it. Good-bye and
good luck!</p>

<p>So Jedediah Smith and Silas Gobel, the blacksmith, and Andy
Burnett, furnished out with nine animals, again tackled the
Sierras. They were about thirty miles north of the Yosemite. After
eight days of terrible struggle they managed to make the summit of
the main ridge. Here the snow lay eight or ten feet deep, but so
close-packed that the horses sank only a foot or so below the
surface. Still, that was enough to make progress slow and
uncertain. Three of the nine animals had already perished.</p>

<p>To gain the summit was a triumph in itself. But the nature of
the topography, which now for the first time became evident, gave
them another flicker of cheer. From westward the Sierras rise
slowly to their heights, through ridge after ridge of lesser
ranges, so that from foothill to summit is often from fifty to
eighty miles of difficult mountain travel. To the eastward they
drop off precipitously, almost in one jump. So Jedediah Smith and
his two companions, struggling at last to the narrow flat of the
skyline, found they had only to drop down a few thousand
feet&mdash;a matter of hours instead of days&mdash;to water,
warmth, and grass. But before they did so, Jedediah Smith took
careful bearings.</p>

<p>The country, viewed maplike from above, did not look inviting.
Nor did the event belie its first impression. For three solid weeks
they traveled. There was no game, little water, scanty grass.
Occasionally, for as long as two days at a stretch, they found
their way over sandy wastes where was nothing. Then they thirsted.
If the sandy wastes should continue on beyond a certain and very
definite maximum, they must perish. They had no reason to believe
that such would not be the case. But always, just short of
disaster, they found a <i>tenaja</i> of water in the rocky hills,
and with it sparse grasses. They were led to these discoveries by
small indications&mdash;the flight of rare desert birds, minute
differences in configurations of the hills, and the like. At such
places, generally, a few Indians were encamped. They were the most
wretched people Andy had ever seen. They had no clothing; their
hair was long, matted, and unkempt. They appeared to subsist solely
on grass seed, grasshoppers, desert mice, lizards, and snakes. No
information could be had from them. They strayed as little as
possible from the miserable safety of their <i>tenaja.</i> Pausing
only just long enough to draw breath, the white man headed forth
once more into the unknown desert.</p>

<p>The horses died one by one. They were gaunt, dessicated, skin
and bones. Nevertheless each, as it fell, was carefully cut up and
the meat, such as it was, saved. That was all they had to eat. It
was curious, Andy remarked, how a horse seemed to die just in the
nick of time, when it looked as though they would have to take to
grasshoppers or starve; and how the <i>tenajas</i> of water in the
hills appeared to linger in obstinate concealment until they were
so far gone in the tortures of thirst that delirium hovered,
lowering its claws to snatch, and then revealed themselves, again
just in the nick of time. But it was equally curious that they
always did! Of course it was not necessary to wait for a horse to
die. They could kill one. But they could not smite a rock, like
Moses, to call forth a gushing spring. And anyway the horse
business was getting to be a hair-line affair. Horses were needed
to eat; but also to carry. Long since the little party had stripped
down. Long since they had left their saddles, with all else of
their goods but the barest necessities. They walked: but they were
in no condition to carry other burdens than their long rifles. Andy
had plenty of time to think about these things as he trudged along.
There seemed no end to it. The character of the barren and desolate
country never changed. A series of last-moment miracles had saved
them up to now. Suppose one miracle should lack or should delay too
long?</p>

<p>It would have been easy to despair; and despair would most
certainly have disintegrated the last of their slender resistance.
Dogged tenacity can accomplish wonders; but its power has limits.
Here something more was needed: an unwavering faith. Jedediah Smith
possessed it; and his complete and implicit confidence communicated
itself to his companions.</p>

<p>Jedediah Smith was a remarkable character, an anomaly to the
plains and mountains of those days. In addition to being a
practised frontiersman, a man of fierce courage, great enterprise,
and untiring energy he was a sincere and practising Christian. As
his companions were fond of saying of him, "he fit like an Injin
and preached like a parson." His first possession was his rifle;
his second, and equally important, was his Bible, Nevertheless so
eminent was his leadership, so broad his humanity, so shrewd and
efficient his practical qualities, that he gained not only the
respect and admiration but the liking of the rough mountain men.
Jed Smith had no manner of doubt as to the continuance of the
miracles; showed no surprise at them. Andy and Silas could not
doubt either.</p>

<p>"I will lift up mine eyes to the hills from whence cometh my
help," he read to them. "The Lord shall preserve thee from
evil."</p>

<p>"Dang if that ain't right!" the literal blacksmith confided to
Andy apart. "The hills; that's whar we find the
<i>tenajas."</i></p>

<p>And again, when the desert seemed at last outstaring them with
its brazen face:</p>

<p>"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters. Yea,
though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil, for Thou art with me."</p>

<p>That very day, the twentieth since leaving the cold Sierras,
they sighted Salt Lake. They led one gaunt horse, one skeleton
mule.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>This was the story they had to tell at rendezvous.</p>

<p>They brought back no beaver, and no news of beaver near enough
to be profitable. They had failed to find the Buenaventura or to
get any news of it. The expedition might well be considered a
failure. It was a failure as far as its conscious objectives were
concerned. But Jedediah Smith was going back, immediately after
rendezvous. His excuse was that he must pick up the men the Sierra
snows had forced him to leave behind. But they were old mountain
men and could well have found their own way back without waiting to
be led out, like a dog on a string, by Jed. No, it was evident
enough that Jed wanted another shot at the lovely land. The journey
would not this time be so difficult or uncertain. He considered
that now he knew the way!</p>

<p>Andy hurt his foot. It was only a sprain, but it was sufficient
to prevent his being one of the eighteen men who elected to try the
California adventure. At the time he raged in disgust against his
unlucky fate, but he was lucky. Jedediah Smith returned from this
second expedition two years later with only three survivors. Ten of
the eighteen were massacred by the very Mojaves who had been so
helpful before. They had been warned by the Spanish to permit no
more white men to pass. Fifteen more were murdered by the Umpquas
as Smith and his party at last headed out of California, after
vexing imprisonments and difficulties with the Spaniards. The four
men who escaped made their difficult way through the forests of
Oregon to the Hudson's Bay Post at Fort Vancouver.</p>

<p>Here ruled John McLoughlin, the White Eagle of the Indians.
Powerfully made, over six feet tall, with a massive head and a
splendid mane of white waving hair, he was a magnificent figure.
His mere word was the law of the land for a thousand miles about.
In him was vested and personified the mighty power of the ancient
company of Gentlemen Adventurers known as the Hudson's Bay, so that
he was generally known as the Czar of the West.</p>

<p>To his great establishment then, one by one, the destitute
survivors made their way. Arthur Black was the first, brought in at
night by friendly Indians. He was utterly broken by hunger and
destitution. For some time he was so affected by his escape and
rescue that he could not speak. Then he said that he thought
himself the only survivor of all the party.</p>

<p>McLoughlin was a man of instant action. He rewarded the Indians
liberally. He dispatched runners with tobacco to all the Willamette
chiefs, asking them to send their people immediately in search. He
then equipped a strong party of forty to set out from the fort. But
just as they were about to start arrived Jedediah Smith, and
following him two more, who had made their way unaided; "to my
great joy," as McLoughlin records his own feeling.</p>

<p>But while the rescued men were being fed and other-wise
comforted, White Eagle slipped from the room and called to him
Thomas McKay, the partisan in charge of the armed expedition that
had already been gathered. To him he gave written instructions.</p>

<p>"Do not look at them, Tom, until you have reached the Umpqua
River," said he. "It's safer. Some of the officers might learn of
them, and talk among themselves, the men would hear of it, and from
them it would get to the Indians through the squaws."</p>

<p>McKay marched his men to the Umpqua. He opened the sealed
orders. They instructed him "to invite the Indians to bring their
furs to trade, just as if nothing had happened. Count the furs, but
as the American trappers mark all their skins, keep these all
separate, give them to Mr. Smith and not pay the Indians for them,
telling them that they belonged to him, that they got them by
murdering Smith's people."</p>

<p>McKay followed these instructions, and successfully. He
recovered thus not only most of the beaver of the ill-fated party,
but also many of their horses, and some of their personal
belongings. Among the latter was fortunately the detailed diary of
Harry Rogers, from which we learn many things. Its last entry
rejoiced that in only fifteen miles more of travel their troubles
would be over!</p>

<p>These things, all of them, McLoughlin returned to Jedediah Smith
intact. He went further. As it would be difficult or impossible to
transport the peltries overland, McLoughlin appraised them truly
and gave Smith a draft on London for $20,000. From the value of the
furs he deducted only the expenses of the expedition that had
recovered them. He charged against them the men's time&mdash;at the
rate of sixty dollars a year apiece!&mdash;and four dollars apiece
for several horses that were lost on the trip.</p>

<p>Jedediah Smith was overwhelmed by White Eagle's magnanimity to a
foeman completely at his mercy. For by now the Rocky Mountain
Company and the Hudson's Bay had become formidable competitors. But
McLoughlin waved his protests aside.</p>

<p>"I do this from a principle of Christian duty," said he.</p>

<p>Probably both remembered, though neither mentioned, that spring
of 1825 when Ashley and Peter Skene Ogden had met in the valley of
the Great Salt Lake. In March, with his surviving companions,
Jedediah Smith set out on his return journey. In August he ran into
Sublette and Jackson, who were anxiously searching for him, and by
them was guided to the rendezvous of that year, at Wind River.</p>

<p>But this was not quite all; the episode was not finished. In
face of the obstinate resistance of his partners, in face of the
horrified opposition of every mountain man of the lot, Jedediah
Smith persisted.</p>

<p>"My mind is made up," he repeated over and over again. "No firm
of which I am a member shall operate west of the Divide. I will not
trespass on territory that McLoughlin considers belongs to him." In
the end he won. Reluctantly, almost sullenly, they yielded. Back
from the new rich country they trailed, over the mountain country,
to the east. A knightly gesture! Lowered swords!</p>

<p>So Jedediah Smith's three years ended. What had he accomplished?
Nothing, grumbled his associates. Less than nothing. He had
acquired no new trapping grounds. Worse; through his quixotic ideas
he had lost that which had been gained. Why did they yield to him?
He was only one man among many. However, they did.</p>

<p>But here is a curious thing: his trail into California is almost
exactly that of the present-day routes of the Salt Lake and the
Santa Fe railroads; his return journey, that of the Union Pacific;
his way north, that of the Shasta route of the Southern Pacific.
Later, various spectacular pathfinders would discover them. But the
way was already open, waiting only the covered wagons and the
rails.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-8" id="ch2-8"></a>CHAPTER 8. Battle</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>NEARING the second third of the century the general conditions
in the West were becoming more and more unsatisfactory. Three great
companies stood in rivalry. Each had its particular advantages,
each its weakness, in antiphony of balance and counterbalance. Each
possessed roughly its own sphere of influence, its own territory;
but none acknowledged the other's exclusive right, and each crowded
it wherever it could.</p>

<p>The Hudson's Bay Company operated to the north and to the far
west. It had the strength of long establishment, of an almost
fanatical loyalty on the part of able men. Its weakness, as far as
these present rivalries went, was its remoteness&mdash;and its
policy of semi-peonage, because of which some of its rank and file
were discontented and like to prove treacherous. But it was the
most firmly established in its own proper territory, and met
effective opposition only when it attempted to push east toward the
Divide.</p>

<p>The Rocky Mountain Fur Company, the company of the mountain men,
operated, as its name implies, in the Rockies themselves, and
especially in the country just west of the Divide, which the
mountain men had themselves discovered. Its strength was in its
personnel, and in the fact that it trapped the finest beaver
streams, both for quantity and quality, in the West. No men ever
lived possessed of greater courage, greater initiative, or greater
ability to sustain themselves in a hostile wilderness. Its weakness
came from the same root. Its men were individualists. The
organization which they served was hardly an organization at all,
in the sense of its rivals. It was a loose association, serving a
temporary purpose. Until late in its existence it did not even
legally operate under the name by which it was popularly known. Its
ownership passed rapidly through several sets of hands. Ashley and
Henry started it. Henry got discouraged and sold out. Jedediah
Smith, Jackson, and Sublette carried on for four years. By that
time they were satisfied with the profits they had made. Sublette
came to the rendezvous in 1830 with a magnificent caravan of
eighty-odd men mounted on Missouri mules; ten heavy wagons drawn by
five mules each; two traveling one-mule "dearborns." And just to
complete this magnificent gesture, he drove in a dozen cattle,
including one milch cow! Milk in their coffee! Fat doings!
Incidentally this was the very first of the tens of thousands of
wheeled caravans that later were to plod over the Oregon Trail. He
and his partners sold out to five of their associates, among whom
were Fitzpatrick and Jim Bridger. Then they packed the ten wagons
with furs and headed back for St. Louis. They took the milch cow
with them. And thus it went. The Rocky Mountain Fur Company was not
an organization. It was men.</p>

<p>The American Fur Company, the third of the rivals, was, on the
other hand, first of all an organization. It had the
men&mdash;Mackenzie, Crooks, Farnham, Kipp, Chouteau, Foutenelle,
many others almost equally distinguished; and behind them the
mighty figure of Astor himself. But it had also three other potent
weapons: politics, a policy, and a long patience. To back these
qualities it also commanded the almost inexhaustible wealth that
makes for stability. It could weather reverses: it could take a
loss in order to eliminate opposition. It was content to wait. Let
others break ground. When this was done, move in and occupy. That
occupation was the field to which to apply the resources of its
tremendous power in the ruthless crushing of all opposition. One
great advantage it possessed: its right hand and its left hand were
geographically so far apart that there was no reason at all why the
one should know what the other was doing. Business could be one
thing looking east; quite another looking west. "It is enough," the
East virtuously put itself on record, "that our laws prohibit the
introduction of ardent spirits into the Indian country, and it is
our bounden duty to conform honestly thereto."</p>

<p>"Liquor we must have or we might as well give up," grumbled the
West. So liquor they had. Some of it was smuggled. Some of it was
brought in by political influence. Some of it by subterfuge. Thus
permission was obtained to import spirits at the rate of one gill a
day for each boatman during the period of his absence, "to relieve
his necessities." Boatmen multiplied overnight. They were even
employed on routes over high prairies miles from any navigable
waters. And, curiously enough, the period of each one's absence was
never less than a full twelve months! Mackenzie had a brainstorm.
Bringing liquor into the Indian country was forbidden; but the law
said nothing about its manufacture! He imported and set up a still,
and was doing very well for a while. But that was a little too
raw&mdash;when news of it crossed the Mississippi. The virtuous
East had to call him off. But there were other methods too.
Fitzpatrick, entering a Crow village to get permission to make his
fall hunt in their country, was immediately set upon and robbed of
everything he and his men possessed. This was astonishing. The
Crows had always been friendly. They gave him no time, as he says,
for "form or ceremony of any kind." He charged the Indians with
having been instigated by the American Fur Company, The Crows
freely confessed it. The company's agent admitted it and laughed.
Mackenzie wrote Pierre Chouteau gleefully, "Fitzpatrick was robbed
of 100 horses, all his merchandise, some beaver, and traps, his
capote, and even his watch. That party can consequently make no
hunt this fall." As a final gesture he blandly informed Fitzpatrick
that the latter could have back his goods by paying their value in
trade, plus the expense of making the trade with the Crows! "I make
this proposal as a favor, not as a matter of right," said he, "for
I consider the Indians entitled to trade any beaver in their
possession to me or any other trader." It was about this time that
Mackenzie ordered sent out from England, of all things, a coat of
mail! This was considered a huge joke. It might not have been so
much of a joke after all. Fitzpatrick returned to the mountains
boiling mad.</p>

<p>Andy Burnett viewed this slow change of condition with troubled
mind. He had been now in the wilderness for upwards of ten years.
He was a seasoned mountain man. He had had his share of hardship
and narrow escape. He had made his friends and his enemies. The
crack of his long rifle had echoed on the walls of the cliffs and
canyons from the Colorado to the Kootenai, and beyond. It is
probable that at that time he knew more of the topography of the
West than any other one man, for his Indian affiliations opened to
him country into which others were as yet unable to penetrate. For
weeks and months at a time he and his few companions, if he had
any, would travel and trap in what seemed to be a limitless
wilderness. They encountered no human being. There was no
diminution of the game; nor, except very locally, much diminution
of the beaver. General knowledge was yet fifteen years away;
general travel, as many more; general pacification, over a
half-century; occupation, three generations distant. Yet to the
mystic perception that was the basis of Andy's otherwise stolid
character was wafted the uneasy breath of change. To his solitary
camp, remote in some hidden park in the Rockies, came a whisper of
unease.</p>

<p>These were not things seen or experienced. His wanderings and
his rare contacts taught him little. The winters he spent with his
friends, the Blackfeet. Once he varied this by a few months at one
of the white men's winter camps; but he did not especially enjoy
that. It brought to him undeniably what he wanted to forget; and
that was that gradually a great many rough and brutal characters
were drifting into the country. The old mountain men were, many of
them, rough; and some of them were, at times, brutal. But these
were different. They were composed of a coarse blunt bestiality
that the mountains had cleansed from even the worst of the old
timers. When drunk they were very quarrelsome; apt to be dangerous;
at any rate trouble makers. At all times they displayed a good
streak of the loud-mouthed swaggering bully. Andy could take care
of himself; though, as a matter of fact, he had very little
trouble. Even those stranger to his reputation stepped around the
quiet, steady competence of the tall frontiersman. He was
recognized at sight as bad medicine. A great many of them were
killed, for they had not the quiet alert plainscraft of the old
timers, and the tally of reprisals was steadily growing between
them and the Indians. The "bad" men tended to drift together, to
form bands, the beginning of later "gangs"&mdash;Such as the
notorious Deschamps family from Missouri, who constituted a
good-sized gang without going out of the family. There were the old
man, and ten grown sons, and a nephew or so; and they robbed,
whipped, plundered, and murdered the Indians wherever they found
them. They all had squaws and swarms of children. They were a tribe
in themselves. The worst of the lot was the old woman. At last the
country rose against them, white and red, and cornered them in a
log house. They dug holes in the earth floor where fire could not
reach them, and bit back at their assailants like mad dogs. In the
height of the storm the old woman, relying on her age and sex,
stepped to the door brandishing a peace pipe. She was instantly
shot down.</p>

<p>"There's an end to the mother of devils!" cried a white man.</p>

<p>The Deschamps were stamped out to the last living creature. It
was the first vigilante movement; the first dime-novel Wild
West.</p>

<p>Feeling of all sorts ran high. The rival companies bit and
snarled. Men who changed allegiance were often mysteriously shot.
In spite of prohibitions liquor flowed into the country.</p>

<p>In the Blackfoot lodges, during the bitter cold winters, Andy
and Joe Crane and Mat-o-suki and Kiasax and the grave blanketed
warriors talked of these things. There could be no real defense, on
the one side or the other. It was a mess; a wild, dangerous,
exciting mess. Only the older men were able to consider it soberly,
in its consequences, were able to deplore. To the younger it was
adventure. And even among the Blackfeet liquor was making way. They
had been one of the sober tribes. Even when they began to drink,
the privilege was at first confined to the chiefs and upper
warriors. A few years later that convention was to break down, and
the Blackfeet were to go to the other extreme until Washington
Irving was to say of them, "they are extremely fond of spirituous
liquors and tobacco; for which nuisances they are ready to exchange
not merely their guns and horses, but even their wives and
daughters." That had not yet come, but it was on the way. It was in
the air. Sensitive instincts felt its shadow.</p>

<p>Those few possessing spiritual antennae&mdash;Andy Burnett, the
Blackfeet elders&mdash;caught its chill. Each reacted in his own
way. The Blackfeet became more implacably, uncompromisingly hostile
to the whites. Andy, mistakenly, pleaded for a better
understanding, urging his friends to come in to rendezvous, to go
to council with the men he knew&mdash;Sublette, Campbell,
Fitzpatrick. He, like the others, thought in terms of
individuals.</p>

<p>It was all a matter of individuals. Red against white; the
beginning of a bitter struggle. Yet on either side men stood out,
men who had the respect, if not the liking, of their antagonists.
Sublette was one of them; the Indians called him Fate. Fitzpatrick
was another; he was known as Bad Hand. Beckworth, the mulatto, had
a curious prestige. Jim Bridger enjoyed an enormous reputation and
respect. And, strangely enough, the youngster who had so recently
come into the country, the boy who had run away and for whose
return had been advertised the munificent reward of one cent, Kit
Carson, had in a few years made way to the forefront of renown.
There were others, on both sides of the fence. Andy knew these men;
liked them; trusted them. He had not thought the thing
out&mdash;Andy was not a rationalizing creature&mdash;but somehow
he wanted his friends to get together. Long hours he spent in the
Blackfoot lodges arguing his point. He made scant impression.</p>

<p>"These be great warriors, I-tam-api," they told him, "but they
are our enemies. All white men are our enemies."</p>

<p>In vain Andy instanced himself, Joe Crane, Berger, who dealt
with the Bloods. They listened; but as far as he could see he made
no progress.</p>

<p>When spring came he set out for the hidden parks, traveling for
days, until he had reached the solitudes. Under the shadows of the
great mountains it sometimes seemed to him he had escaped. They
encircled him about. On their summits slept the pure calm of
eternal snows. The clear stream of the valley flashed and gleamed
among the cottonwoods and willows; Flowers starred the meadows of
rich grasses bending before the breeze. The sun shone warm through
the nip of the highland air. Game herds grazed on the flats and far
up the fling of the foothill slopes. All the littler creatures
chirped and rustled and sang. As he waded up the smaller
tributaries, setting his traps, or squatted on his heels before his
graining block, or pressed the trigger of the old Boone gun, or lay
before the waxing gleam of his fire as the evening fell, for a
little he was back in the old serenity that here had dwelt for
thousands of undisturbed and undisturbing years. But sooner or
later, over the ranges, like an invisible, impalpable mist crept
the influence of the outside stir, seeking him out. He could not
banish thought or recollection.</p>

<p>However little as yet the vastness of the Western solitude had
been touched, in his world things had changed.</p>

<p>Kelly had never come back. Joe Crane rarely accompanied him now.
Crane seemed to have settled down comfortably to family life, with
a growing brood of half-breed children; to be increasingly
content.</p>

<p>"Hard doin's and I had jist my rifle and my possibles," he
argued comfortably. "Easy doin's and I got 'em jist the same, and a
warm lodge and my woman and young 'uns. I've larned, Andy.
Wagh!"</p>

<p>Jedediah Smith had been killed by the southwestern Indians down
in the Cimarron. Sublette was busy with the demands of the company.
The old mountain men were killed; scattered; lost in the rabble;
or, like Fitzpatrick, increasingly absorbed by the new wild life of
raid and war and adventure. Andy was only about thirty years old;
but, unknowing, he was running true to his kind, close to the
genius of his spiritual kinsmen, the genius that took Boone in his
old age out of his beloved Kentucky to the Missouri when the
country got crowded, and a neighbor only fifteen miles away.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Joe Crane and Andy Burnett drew rein as they surmounted the
rise. They looked down on a beautiful prairie-like valley. Over
against them rose the formidable peaks of the Three Tetons.
Meandering lines of cottonwood and dense willow thickets marked the
course of a main river and numerous tributaries. Elsewhere were no
trees; merely lush grasses starred with wildflowers. This was
Pierre's Hole, and the agreed rendezvous for the year 1832.</p>

<p>"Wagh!" cried Joe in astonishment. "They's a passel of 'em!
More'n I ever see afore! Big doin's!"</p>

<p>He clapped his heels to his horse and plunged down the slope.
Andy and Flying Woman followed more soberly. Long since had he
matured beyond his mentor: Joe was the perpetual boy. He helped
Flying Woman select an appropriate place for the lodge, saw to the
horses, then, and not until then, walked across to the main
encampment to hear the news. As he strode along, he looked about
him curiously. The Indians were more numerous than usual. Nez
Perces and Flatheads he noted. Both were deadly enemies of the
Blackfeet. Among the white men were many strange faces. He nodded
to an acquaintance or so, greeted one or two friends, pressed on to
where the main concourse was squatted about. Joe was arguing
heatedly with someone. Andy saw a shock of red hair, recognized
with surprise a man he had not seen for many years, one who had
been of the Taos party when Andy was new to the plains, and who had
gone over to the employ of the American Fur Company instantly the
latter had established itself. He was now bareheaded and facing Joe
with a sneering grin that indicated to Andy that he was having the
best of it; for Tilton's temper had always been notoriously short.
Andy's arrival broke up the argument, whatever it was, for he had
become a personage of importance in the West and men pressed about
him for recognition or acquaintance. Even Ben Tilton accorded him a
surly greeting.</p>

<p>Andy seated himself; accepted a pipe. Big news! A number talked
at once. Finally he straightened it out. The rival companies were
coming to grips at last. Heretofore a rendezvous had been a
one-firm affair. This year the American Fur Company had advertised
its attendance with a full line of trade, to be offered in
competition. Ben Tilton and a few companions were the bearers of
that news. Tilton was now avowedly an A. F. C. man. He spoke up,
swaggering, bragging what his employers were going to do.</p>

<p>"We aim to git the trade," he boasted, "and when we aim to git a
thing, we git it!"</p>

<p>Joe bristled again at this: they were old enemies, and anything
sufficed as a provocation. But Andy intervened. "Well," he asked
reasonably, "how is the trade going?"</p>

<p>That was just it! That is what made this such a wonderful
sporting event! Sublette was on his way from St. Louis with the
Rocky Mountain Fur Company's goods; Vanderburgh was coming from the
Missouri on behalf of the American Fur Company. Neither had
arrived. Whoever got there first would take the bulk of the trade.
It was a race.</p>

<p>Nobody knew where either of the partisans were by now; how far
they were away. No one, naturally, could guess what difficulties
they might have encountered to delay them. There was always the
good possibility that a skillful Indian raid might have put one or
the other of them afoot. The Sublette party was laboring under one
handicap. It knew of no particular occasion for haste, for it was
unaware of this new <i>demarche</i> on the part of its rival.
Fitzpatrick had set out alone, only a few days ago, to find
Sublette if he could, and hurry him along. Aside from all party
prejudice, here was a grand opportunity for gambling; better than
any horse race.</p>

<p>Although, outside Tilton and his men, there were few active
sympathizers with the American Fur Company present, the majority
were at heart indifferent. Andy looked them over thoughtfully,
reflecting on the changes. The old-time mountain men were already
in the minority. The type was changing. Most of these were bearded
men. In the old days nearly everyone went shaven because one got
along with the Indians if he could, and the Indians looked down on
anyone with a hairy face. Now nobody cared what Indians thought.
There was hardly a flint gun in the lot; Joe was about the only
one, who could afford something else, who still clung to his
prejudice. Strange faces everywhere. Andy inquired about them from
his friend Hal Mulford, who reclined at his elbow. They were a
picturesque mixed lot. That was Chabonard, a half-breed, with a
good-sized band of his like; the generation from the squaw man was
grown up to introduce a new element to the West. That white man
yonder was Sinclair, from the lower Missouri; he commanded a party
of fifteen free trappers, good men all, but hampered by no
allegiances. There was even a scattering of Mexicans from Taos way.
Plenty who did not give a hoot which trading party won the race;
but ready to hail the affair as a grand sporting event on which to
lay their bets. Of course the Indians, the Nez Perces and the
Flatheads, camped yonder in the bottom, would sell to the first
buyer.</p>

<p>"And I'll tell you this, Andy," Mulford informed him, "If'n Bill
Sublette don't top that rise fust, there's goin' to be mouty few of
us old timers gits off with a shirt on our backs or a hoss under
our tails!"</p>

<p>They drew apart to talk it over away from the crowd.</p>

<p>As has been from the dawn of history, the lament was over the
"good old days."</p>

<p>"Hard doin's sometimes," said Mulford. "Injins was bad
sometimes; but not like now. They was more playful-like; not real
mean. They'd mebbe steal yore hoss or lift yore ha'r, ef'n yo'
didn't watch out; but they knowed when yo' had yore eyes shinin';
and when the joke was on them, they'd laugh too, and mebbe give yo'
a woman to keep yore winter lodge warm. Everything was in the
sperrit of play, as you mout say. When you traveled, you tied yore
hosses in rifle shot durin' daylight, and penned them at night.
And, Andy, even the game ain't what it was. I'm tellin' yo. You
don't know. Back in yore kentry it's different. But down whar I
been&mdash;why, in the old days the buffalo bulls were so bold
they'd come right up to the hosspens and paw and snort, so I didn't
go fur for meat. What lettle you see now is bull meat. The
mountains is pore. The game is all gittin' druv out. No place for a
white man; too pore, too pore! In the old days it was sometimes a
leetle more dangersome for a lone man; but more beaver, too; and
plenty grease around the buffalo ribs. Them was good times! but a
white man has no business yere now!"</p>

<p>He spat thoughtfully into the fire.</p>

<p>"They's good kentry yet, this side the Divide," he acknowledged.
"But she's gittin' small. You got a good kentry, Andy. But yore
Blackfeet is bad. You don't know it, but you&mdash;and
Joe&mdash;they's a good deal of talk agin you. Not that I hold with
it; nor the old-time mountain men. We know how it is. But these new
ones&mdash;they don't love you, Andy. I ain't blamin' them much,
nuther." Mulford was fair. "The Blackfeet is bad. Nearly got my
ha'r this year. Stole a lot of traps on me; and yo' kain't make
traps out of greasewood. The Nez Perces and Flatheads&mdash;the
Blackfeet been a-massacreein' them too. Bad medicine, Andy. I wisht
you and Joe could call 'em off. I know you kain't. I wisht old Bill
Sublette would hurry along."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Andy.</p>

<p>"Or anybody else," continued Mulford frankly. "I'd trade with
the devil himself for a slug of likker. I'm low in my mind."</p>

<p>Andy was low in his mind, too, when late that evening he
returned to the lodge. He found that Mulford had spoken truly.
Except among his old friends, he found himself looked upon in many
quarters if not with hostility, at least with a veiled resentment.
The newer elements, it was evident, identified him with the
Blackfeet. In the encampments of the Nez Perces and the Flatheads
men eyed him sullenly, muffling themselves in their robes as he
passed. The Blackfeet had that season treated them roughly. The
Flatheads, in especial, were a broken people. Andy was relieved to
find that Flying Woman had not been molested. He resolved to move
the lodge to a safer place on the morrow.</p>

<p>Joe was not low in his mind. He was sizzling. The old smoldering
enmity between himself and Ben Tilton had blazed up. The red-head
had conducted himself with an arrogance born of his affiliation
with the great company whose waxing power was just beginning to
make itself felt. Joe had bet everything he owned on Sublette.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>He won. Sublette arrived first. But Joe's public triumph was
somewhat dimmed by the cause of the delay. Sublette had sustained a
night attack by the Blackfeet; and, although he had beaten it off,
he had lost horses and mules. Still, he had arrived. With him,
besides his seasoned veterans of the trail, were a number of green
recruits from St. Louis, and a quaint party he had picked up on the
road and brought along out of sheer kindness of
heart&mdash;Nathaniel Wyeth and his New Englanders.</p>

<p>He had found them completely stranded. Knowing nothing of the
country, nothing of plainscraft, nothing of Indian trade, they had
brought goods according to their own ideas of what Indians would
want, had outfitted themselves according to their own notions of
what wilderness travel required, and had pushed off. Not one of the
party had ever seen an Indian, had even handled a rifle! It did not
occur to them to provide themselves with a guide and interpreter!
Sublette found them completely bogged down, took them in tow, and
brought them along. They huddled together, and stared wide-eyed at
the wild assembly that awaited them.</p>

<p>Sublette had seen nothing of Fitzpatrick. He was much worried.
But a few days later Fitzpatrick came in, escorted by two Iroquois
hunters. He was totally destitute, and so emaciated that at first
he was not recognized. The Blackfeet had found him. He escaped from
them at first, losing only one horse and his outfit. After lurking
three days in the mountains he ventured out. Again the Blackfeet
discovered him. Again he escaped; but this time he lost everything
except his rifle and the one charge with which it was loaded. For
some days he crawled among the mountain cliffs. Then, having shaken
off his enemies, he started back afoot for the rendezvous. He ate
berries and roots. He patched his moccasins with his hat. He lost
his rifle in swimming a river. The Iroquois found him as he was
about to perish. His plight aroused the greatest indignation. Again
the Blackfeet!</p>

<p>Vanderburgh of the A. F. C. came in, but his supplies had been
delayed. There were now present several hundred whites, besides the
Indians. It was the greatest rendezvous in the history of the
mountains. Sublette took advantage of his opportunity. For eight
days he had a free field.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Andy finished his business early and would willingly have left
at once for the back country. He had no mood for the celebrations
and sprees. Little given to the surface imaginations, he
nevertheless was keenly sensitive in his deeper psychic faculties.
The portent whose impalpable mist had followed him into the
remoteness of his solitary mountain fastnesses here thickened to
the darkness of a shadow. Andy did not see it; he felt it. All he
knew was that he was uneasy; that he had no stomach for the
companionship of even his oldest friends; that he wanted to get
through and get out as soon as he could. But Joe was having his one
big time of the year. It would be unfair to drag him away. So he
waited with what patience he could summon, and tried in one way and
in others to shake off that growing shadow of portent.</p>

<p>He spent much time alone by the river. One afternoon, returning
to camp, he discovered it violently agitated. Men were gathered in
a close knot about some center of interest. Others were running
toward the group, shouting back fragments of news to others still
more distant. A fight, probably; or perhaps merely some gambling
game with stakes heavier than the ordinary. Andy was not
particularly interested. He was about to pass, but found himself
impelled to turn aside. He was recognized by a few on the
outskirts. They nudged others. Heads turned towards him; a swift
silence spread, licking up the hubbub like a flame. Men drew aside
to permit him a free passage. Curious!</p>

<p>He found himself in the center of the group looking down at Joe
Crane with a bullet hole in the center of his forehead.</p>

<p>He dropped the butt of the long rifle to earth and slowly
surveyed the circle of faces.</p>

<p>"Who did this?" he demanded harshly, after a moment.</p>

<p>For ten seconds no one spoke; then a dozen spoke at once. Ben
Tilton...called him a...slapped his face...no he didn't!...shot it
out...The clamor arose, grew more vehement. There were differences
of opinion. Men disputed one another; grew heated over it. Andy
took no part; asked no question further: listened, his elbows on
the muzzle of his rifle.</p>

<p>Gradually a picture framed in his mind, but whether pieced
together from the shouted fragments or from an instinct of the
situation, it would be difficult to say. With no one present to
restrain it, the old feud had blazed up. The men had fought with
rifles. It was a fair fight, several insisted, a regular duel,
properly carried out. The men had been placed back to back at four
rods' distance; they had turned at the signal. Joe had been much
the quicker. But his piece had missed fire.</p>

<p>"It was that old flint gun." They shook their heads. "He was
obstinate as a mule, hangin' onto that old thing."</p>

<p>Then Tilton, taking his time, had shot his man down. "Joe kep'
his nerve," they paid him tribute, "jist stood thar, stiddy as a
rock, and took it."</p>

<p>Andy listened, without comment, without change of expression,
without a quiver of a muscle, like a bronze fate. Even when the
last man had had his say, and the clamor had died, and all looked
toward him in expectancy, he continued to stare frowningly before
him in silence.</p>

<p>"Were they drunk?" he asked curtly at last.</p>

<p>Joe was pretty drunk, Tilton was sober. But, they hastened to
add, Joe wasn't drunk enough but what he could handle himself all
right.</p>

<p>"Where's Tilton?" Andy next demanded.</p>

<p>Nobody knew. He was around somewhere. It was a perfectly fair
fight, a number insisted, this time a trifle belligerently. Andy
stared at them one by one, but still without comment. These were A.
F. C. men, Tilton's friends. They gave him back stare for stare,
ready to meet a challenge. But there was none. Andy pondered for a
time.</p>

<p>"Take care of him, boys," he said at last, and turned away,
thrusting through the crowd. "I'll be' back."</p>

<p>"Whar yo' goin'!" someone demanded, "ef'n yo're lookin' to make
trouble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I must see his woman," said Andy briefly. He looked about him,
caught Mulford's eye. "See if you can find Tilton," he told his
friend. "Tell him to be looking for me."</p>

<p>They stared after him. Two or three of the A. F. C. men drew
together, whispering apart. Mulford thrust himself among them.</p>

<p>"Yo' keep yore hands off'n this," he told them. "This ain't yore
business."</p>

<p>They bristled at him, growling in their throats, but subsided as
they looked about at the stern faces of the old mountain men
surrounding them.</p>

<p>"We just aim to see fair play," one protested.</p>

<p>"Thar'll be fair play," they were promised grimly, "somebody
find Tilton and bring him yere."</p>

<p>Andy stooped to the low entrance of the lodge. Flying Woman
listened, and covered her head. He touched her shoulder and went
out.</p>

<p>But as he straightened his tall form, he was arrested by a low
whistle from the shelter of the willows near at hand. A man was
beckoning him earnestly. Throwing his rifle forward at ready, and
glancing keenly to right and left, he obeyed the signal. The man
proved to be Chabonard, the half-breed. After a few moments'
conversation Andy turned once more toward the gathering place,
Chabonard clutched at his hunting jacket. Andy shook him off.</p>

<p>"I'll not betray you," he promised briefly.</p>

<p>Chabonard gazed anxiously at his tall figure as he strode away,
then drew back his head, and by concealed and devious ways himself
returned to the main encampment.</p>

<p>Andy, however, turned aside to the bottomlands, where he caught
his horse. At the lodge he saddled the animal, collected certain
items of equipment, filled a skin sack with Blackfoot pemmican.
Flying Woman looked up at him. He nodded to her. Leading the animal
he retraced his steps to where the trappers still waited. Mulford
met him.</p>

<p>"Tilton has gone," he told Andy. "Rode off northward an hour
ago."</p>

<p>"I thought likely," said Andy.</p>

<p>He dropped the reins of his horse and pushed to the middle of
the expectant gathering.</p>

<p>"This was not a fair fight. It was murder," he told them
harshly. "Tilton emptied the priming powder out of Joe's pan. He
was seen doing it. I'm going after him. It ain't going to be
healthy for anyone to follow me. Understand?"</p>

<p>They looked at one another thunderstruck. Andy's straight brows
were drawn level. He stared at them slowly one after the other.</p>

<p>"Understand?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"They won't no one foller you," Mulford assured him grimly.
"'Less'n yo' want some help."</p>

<p>"This is my business," said Andy.</p>

<p>He turned away and picked up the reins of his hcrse.</p>

<p>But before mounting he spoke to Mulford, at his elbow.</p>

<p>"See to things, Harry," he requested briefly.
"Joe&mdash;and&mdash;better get his woman back to her people."</p>

<p>"Rest yore mind easy, Andy," Mulford promised. Andy mounted and
rode away. They watched his figure until it disappeared. Then an
excited buzz of talk broke forth.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>By the middle of July business was over and the rendezvous began
to break up. A substantial party rode together to the southwest,
following the valley of Pierre's Hole, in the upper end of which
the gathering had taken place. Fourteen were trappers of the
company under the command of Milton, Sublette's brother, Sinclair
and his fifteen free trappers, and Wyeth and his Down-Easters
completed the body. They camped the first night about eight miles
down stream. The following morning, as they were about to start,
someone caught sight of a long procession descending the slope of a
pass through the mountains. Wyeth possessed a spy glass. They
unlimbered it, and Milton Sublette took a look.</p>

<p>"Blackfeet!" he cried.</p>

<p>That word was sufficient to throw all those present into a state
of excitement so deeply stirring that clear thought and sound
judgment were thenceforth impossible. Across the actuality of this
occasion drew the lurid veil of past attack and atrocity. The men
huddling hastily together there on the plain saw only what their
emotions permitted them. Thus the painted and feathered warriors
stood out plainly enough, and the numbers of them; but until after
the event few could recollect having noticed the women and children
bringing up the rear, nor the animals laden with household goods. A
dreaded name obscured such details. It must be admitted that the
name had been earned by a consistent hostility. Still it was a
great pity that Joe Crane was dead; that Andy Burnett was away on
an errand of vengeance. It was a great pity that in Milton
Sublette's party were few cool-headed enough to recognize this as a
peace party; and that those few had been embittered beyond fairness
by Blackfoot attack. For these were Mat-o-suki and his entire
village, yielding at last to the often-repeated persuasions of
Andy, and for the first time coming in to the white man's
rendezvous to trade and make peace!</p>

<p>They defiled out from the mountains and onto the plains, yelling
and waving their robes and red blankets exultantly. Mat-o-suki
looked from under his shading hand for a response. He had mistaken
this encampment for the rendezvous itself; thought that he saw
before him all the white men. He was disappointed and a little
nonplussed that Joe or Andy did not immediately ride forward. They
might be out hunting. Still, Flying Woman must have remained in
camp. Mat-o-suki handed a warrior his arms, and rode forward a
little, extending before him the peace pipe for a parley.</p>

<p>All might still have gone well had either Milton Sublette or
perhaps Sinclair answered the summons. But a half-breed named
Antoine Godin mounted his horse and thrust himself forward. Nobody
objected to his taking the job. In general opinion Blackfoot and
treachery were synonymous terms. If Godin wanted to take a chance
he was welcome. He rode out to meet the Blackfoot chief unarmed,
but accompanied by a Flathead Indian. They met Mat-o-suki halfway.
Godin grasped his extended hand firmly, and hung on.</p>

<p>"All ready," he said coolly over his shoulder to the Flathead.
The latter produced a gun from beneath his blanket, leveled it
carefully, and shot down the Blackfoot chief. Godin paused only
long enough to snatch Mat-o-suki's heavily ornamented scarlet
blanket, and back the two raced, bending low to their ponies'
necks, pursued by a hail of ineffective bullets.</p>

<p>It was indubitably an act of treachery. But only the year before
Antoine's father had been surprised by the Blackfeet and butchered
in cold blood as he stooped to his trap in the little stream that
to-day bears his name: only the year before the power of the once
proud Flat-heads had crumbled forever beneath the ferocity of the
Blackfoot attack. Who are we either to condone or condemn? But we
may pity.</p>

<p>The unexpected tragedy threw both parties into confusion. Two of
the mounted warriors swooped down to rescue the body of the chief.
The others withdrew into the river swamp, a tangle of willow and
cottonwood and hanging vines. There the women began at once to dig
trenches, to construct a rough breastwork of brush and fallen tree
trunks. The men, pausing only long enough to assume their war
finery, returned at once to the edge of the woods, ready for either
attack or defense. They were, naturally, burning with anger, which
was deepened by the consciousness of their own good intentions.
They outnumbered the whites, and were nearly as well armed. The
latter should pay, to the last man, for this outrage!</p>

<p>The trappers were not less prompt. A shallow ravine, running
nearly parallel with the river, faced the edge of the swamp. In
this Milton Sublette's fourteen and Sinclair's fifteen took their
stand. Wyeth, for all his inexperience, showed his good sense by
picketing his horses in camp, constructing around them a breastwork
of packs and saddles, and squatting his Down-Easters behind its
protection. They knew nothing of rifles and less of Indians, and
that was by far the best place not only for them but for everybody
concerned. Then, like the stout-hearted New Englander he was, he
joined the combatants to do his bit. A long-range skirmish began.
The Blackfeet were sure of their victims; but they awaited their
chance to finish the job with the least possible damage to
themselves.</p>

<p>But in the meantime a messenger dashed at full speed up the
valley to the rendezvous. As he neared the encampment he stood in
his stirrups, waved his cap, shouted his message.</p>

<p>"Blackfeet! Blackfeet! A fight in the upper valley! To arms! To
arms!"</p>

<p>Men leaped to rifle and to horse. The long-dreaded, long
expected crisis was at hand. From the lodges along the river poured
the Nez Perce and Flathead warriors. It was a common cause:
hereditary enemies, face to face, at last!</p>

<p>Trapper-fashion the white men left their coats, all their
"possibles" in a pile, guarded only by a few of the St. Louis
greenhorns, whom Sublette ordered to stay. It was not much of a
guard, but in case of victory the things could be reclaimed. In
case of defeat they would be ownerless and useless. Sublette and
Campbell raced up the valley at full speed, in front of a headlong
mob of red men and white. As they rode they made their wills, one
to the other. In their minds, and in the minds of all the others
for that matter, the situation was very grave. There could be but
one explanation of this bold daytime invasion against the gathered
rendezvous: The Blackfeet had gathered their full tribal power to
settle the issue once and for all.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>Mat-o-suki's warriors, peering from the screen of brush, were
astounded and dismayed to look forth on the valley swarming with
horsemen. They had thought to deal with a few, outnumbering them
six to one. Then suddenly and unexpectedly found themselves
outnumbered. They withdrew to the dark shelter of their impromptu
fortification. They blackened their faces and began their death
chant.</p>

<p>Sublette took charge. With his usual audacity he advised an
instant attack.</p>

<p>Even the seasoned mountain men for a moment hung back from
attempting the tangled thicket. The Nez Perces and Flatheads
refused.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go alone," said Sublette.</p>

<p>Robert Campbell stepped forward to accompany him. After a
moment's hesitation Sinclair and several of his men followed. One
by one the others, inspired or shamed by this example, wriggled
forward into the swamp.</p>

<p>It was impossible to see more than a few yards through the brush
and vines. They took turns crawling ahead. After a time the woods
opened a bit: they could see the piles of brush, of logs, of
blankets, and buffalo robes and lodge covers, of which the
Blackfeet had made their stronghold. They took the best shelter
they could. The battle began.</p>

<p>Sinclair was shot through the body. Some of his men managed to
carry him out; and returned. Sublette caught a glimpse of a
Blackfoot through a little opening and planted a rifle ball between
the savage's eyes. As he reloaded he was himself struck. Campbell
managed to get him away and out to the care of Wyeth's New
Englanders.</p>

<p>"Let the men fight in twos, and only one fire at a time,'" was
his parting instruction to his partner. "And yell. Yelling is very
essential to Indian warfare." Then he fainted.</p>

<p>The battle became a siege, an affair of sharpshooting.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet were more and more closely beleaguered. They
realized that in time they must be overwhelmed. The death chant
never ceased. For hours men, on both sides, lay flat in their
concealments, tense and taut, awaiting the chance of an incautious
movement. The Nez Perces and the Flatheads were gaining confidence.
The legend of the invulnerability of their hereditary enemies was
breaking at last. They saw the moment of their supreme triumph
approaching. Occasionally some young warrior, carried by excitement
beyond the bounds of ordinary good sense, would dash up to the
breastworks, fire over them at random, seize a robe or a blanket
and dash back, waving it exultantly. Generally he got shot for his
pains; but his deed raised the warlike ardor of his companions. So
sure now were the Indian allies that they vehemently opposed a
proposal to set fire to the fort. Already they looked upon the
Blackfoot belongings as certain spoil, and they did not want them
destroyed.</p>

<p>There was a continuous din. Beside the crackling of the rifles
and the flatter boom of the smooth-bores, the hot close thicket
resounded with war whoop, with the fierce yells of the trappers,
with the tauntings and braggings of the Indian combatants. And
behind it the unintermitting minor wail of the death chant.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet fought doggedly and bravely. They made no offer to
surrender.</p>

<p>"So long as we had plenty of powder and ball we fought you in
the open. Now these are nearly gone and we will die here with our
women and children," chanted one in a lull of fighting. "You may
kill us here; but soon you who are so hungry for fighting will have
enough. Near us are four hundred lodges of our brothers; They will
soon be here. Their arms are strong. Their hearts are big. 'They
will avenge us."</p>

<p>None of the white men understood the Blackfoot language.</p>

<p>"What is he saying?" Campbell asked of a half-breed. The breed
did not know. He enquired of a Nez Perce; the Nez Perce of a
Flathead. By the time the translation had been relayed back to
Campbell it would appear that the men of four hundred lodges were
at that moment attacking the upper camp.</p>

<p>Campbell consulted Sublette, lying in Wyeth's compound. This was
serious. The profits of the entire season, not to speak of the
green St. Louis recruits, were imperiled. Hastily they called in
the besiegers. Leaving a small detachment to try to watch the fort,
the trappers galloped off up the valley as hastily as they had
come.</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p>Returning from this wild goose chase the following morning, they
were overtaken by Andy Burnett on a lathered horse. Several shouted
at him as he passed, but received no reply. And several hurled
curses after him, for the minds of all were sore, and heated by
battle, and Andy was a Blackfoot man.</p>

<p>Arrived at the scene of the combat, Andy hurled himself from his
exhausted animal and, unheeding the shouted warnings of the men
lying hidden in the brush, thrust directly through the tangled
screen toward the barricade.</p>

<p>"Tarnation fool!" growled one of Sinclair's men. "Does he think
he can take the fort alone? Does he want to git himself shot?"</p>

<p>"He's Burnett&mdash;the Blackfoot man," explained the
mountaineer at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Blackfoot man, huh!" ejaculated the other. "Then I hope he
<i>does</i> git shot!"</p>

<p>The breastworks held their fire; frowning in the half-light of
the thicket. Andy stopped.</p>

<p>"It is I-tam-api!" he called.</p>

<p>There was no reply. He advanced, thrusting aside the screen of
cut brush, climbing to the logs of the breast-work. There he stood,
looking about him.</p>

<p>No living creature met his eye. In the darkness the Blackfeet
had stolen away to the mountains. They had carried away their
wounded; perhaps some of the more important dead. Andy's expert eye
marked the traces of their going, and the bloody sign where the
litters had been borne. But some of the dead remained. One part of
Andy's mind automatically began to function with the keen and
careful accuracy of the trained mountain man. That part counted the
bodies that had been left behind&mdash;there were nine. It counted,
too, the dead horses&mdash;there were thirty-two of these, perhaps
thirty-three. It read the signs of departure one by one, and made
its automatic swift calculations as to the numbers involved and the
losses sustained. All these things it laid away neatly for the
future, pending its master's interest in them. At the moment Andy
had no room for them. The first swift and searing horror, the first
vain and discarded regret that his arrival had been too late,
seemed to have cut some umbilical cord that had held him. As though
released he ascended into a plane of impersonal perceptions. His
soul was lost in the contemplation of tragedy; a meaning for which
it must find. The meaning must be found in the pure essence; it
could not exist in these details, these dead bodies, these hunted
human beings in the mountains. That was all useless; horrible;
mistaken. If there was a meaning, it must dwell higher in some
plane above the specific instance, in a realm of pure quality,
where, if anywhere, dwelt justice and right and the reason for
things. It did not seem strange to Andy that he had stepped atop
the crude breastwork, that he had dropped the butt of the long
rifle, and was standing there immobile in his characteristic
attitude, forearms crossed on the muzzle, staring steadily into a
misty land of philosophy far remote.</p>

<p>Nor at the long last did he clearly perceive anything in that
land. It was as though he came-to from a reverie, an especially
ill-timed daydream. He brought no clear thought back with him; only
the enrichment which accompanies perception of the nobility and
sublimity that inheres in catastrophe precipitated not by human
fault but by human imperfection. And in the serenity of this
insight was no room for violent grief or blame or anger. There
dwelt only pity&mdash;and awe.</p>

<p>His eyes slowly focused from his visioning. He found himself
looking directly into the eyes of a living woman. Slowly
realization grew in him. It was Nit-o-ké-man. A dead warrior lay
stretched across her feet. That was Kiasax.</p>

<p>"Nit-o-ké-man!" cried Andy.</p>

<p>She did not reply. Upright against the tree, she might have been
a carved image. Except for her eyes. They looked steadily back at
him, eloquent with a great reproach.</p>

<p>Nor did they waver when a Nez Perce warrior, who had drawn near
unnoticed by Andy, dashed forward past the young man's very elbow.
The thing was over before Andy could move. Nit-o-ké-man sank to her
knees, toppled forward across Kiasax's body. The Nez Perce,
brandishing the bloody warhawk, threw back his head and uttered his
long shrill whoop of triumph.</p>

<p>The long rifle leaped to position; the sights adjusted
themselves steadily; Andy's finger, untrembling, pressed toward the
trigger.</p>

<p>And suddenly he was again in the cold, sad serenity to which
rose no human passion, to which came no faint echo of little things
happening, in which was only weary understanding&mdash;and pity,
and awe. Andy relaxed his trigger finger, dropped the muzzle of his
rifle, and turned away. Why kill? Just more of the same thing!</p>

<p>He made his way out of the thicket, unheeding the rush of men
toward the late battle scene. He was quite calm and collected. At
the encampment he sought out his horse and unsaddled it. The men
there looked at him askance, muttered to one another. This was the
Blackfoot man. He was oblivious of their hostility. He looked about
him, caught Mulford's eye.</p>

<p>"This horse is about tuckered," he said to the latter mildly.
"Got a fresh one you can trade me?"</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Mulford. "Take that pinto there."</p>

<p>Andy deliberately saddled the animal, looking neither to right
nor left. Slowly the men gathered, watching him in silence. Mulford
hovered uneasily, on the point of speech, but thinking better of
it. When the cinch had been tightened Andy stood for a moment lost
in thought as though trying to recollect something. Then he untied
an object from his saddle horn and cast it on the ground. Then he
mounted.</p>

<p>"What yo' doin', Andy?" asked Mulford.</p>

<p>"Pulling out," replied Andy briefly.</p>

<p>Mulford hesitated. "Well, so long," he said at last.</p>

<p>"So long," said Andy.</p>

<p>He gathered the reins and rode slowly up the valley.</p>

<p>They looked after him. One of the men touched the discarded
object with the toe of his moccasin.</p>

<p>"Thought Burnett never took scalps," he observed.</p>

<p>"Never knew him to afore," said Mulford.</p>

<p>They stared at the thing for another period of silence. "This
one's got red ha'r," remarked someone gratuitously.</p>

<p>At the upper camp Andy sought out Hachter, the Little
Burgeway.</p>

<p>"Got any money, Hachter?" he asked. "Give me what you can spare,
and charge against me in St. Louis."</p>

<p>He refused to answer questions.</p>

<p>"They'll tell you," said he.</p>

<p>He stowed the money in his "possible" sack, remounted.</p>

<p>"What you want money for, Andy?" asked Hachter curiously. "Where
you going?"</p>

<p>"Pulling out," replied Andy briefly.</p>

<p>Methodically he gathered his horses, packed his belongings, rode
out of camp toward the west. His face was expressionless. At the
top of the hills he drew rein and for a long time looked back. Item
by item his eyes passed over the scene before him, registering its
details: the encampment, struck small by distance, far below; the
prairie-like valley with its meandering strips of cotton-wood; the
upfling of dark green timber on the mountain slopes; the serene and
brooding peaks of the Three Tetons beyond.</p>

<p>Andy felt drained, old. It was as though a reservoir, heretofore
full and sparkling, had been suddenly emptied, leaving only the
slime of the bottom. A few days ago life had been brimming: now it
was empty. Kelly gone, Joe Crane gone; Mat-o-suki, Kiasax,
Nit-o-ké-man. The whites sullen with hostility against him as a
Blackfoot man; impossible, after this outrage, to show himself
among the Blackfeet. The beaver going. Bitterness and discord and
strife! No good to lose himself in the mountain solitudes he knew
so well. They were no longer solitudes. Into every valley and
canyon and park of them, no matter how remote, seeped that
impalpable, invisible mist of unrest. Andy was tired; tired with a
deadly weariness. He shifted his gaze to westward. Before him
stretched the wide sweep of the high plateau, with its blue brittle
mountains and its castellated buttes and its crystalline clarities
of immense space. But Andy was not seeing these things. His eyes
were filled with a remembered vision of brooding oaks and warm
fields and drowsy peaceful hills; in his ears sounded the mellow
gold of the San Gabriel mission bells. The lovely land!</p>

<p>He gathered the bridle reins, whistled to the pack horses. He
glanced down at the long rifle across his saddlebow, the old Boone
gun.</p>

<p>"Reckon you've done your job&mdash;such as it is!" he murmured,
and sighed.</p>

<p>He looked back. His keen frontiersman's eyes sought the great
cottonwood at the side of the late rendezvous beneath which slept
Joe Crane.</p>

<p>"So long, Mountain Man," he said aloud.</p>

<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p>NECESSARILY in the compilation of this story I have consulted
and used material from a great many volumes dealing with the time,
one hundred and twenty-three of them to be exact. The list runs
through trappers' journals and memoirs; books of contemporary
travelers and chroniclers; the more careful compilations of later
historians. Those familiar with these materials will readily
recognize many of the sources; will be able to detect the fact that
I have journeyed at times not only with Andy Burnett, but with
Dillin, Ruxton, Nierhardt, Chittenden, Irving, Farnham, Dale, and
many others. As this is a work of fiction it seems unnecessarily
cumbersome to publish a complete bibliography, as would be seemly
were it a historical study. It should be sufficient to express my
indebtedness and appreciation and to assure those who may notice
similarities that I am fully aware of having borrowed source
materials as the necessities of the tale demand; and am duly
grateful. Whenever historical characters or institutions have
appeared I have carefully followed historical fact. Estimates of
either are also based on record and can be substantiated.</p>
