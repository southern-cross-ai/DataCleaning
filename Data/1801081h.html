<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>A SLANTED, slashing rain saturated his wool coat while he rigged
the pack animals, and coldness searched his bones. He scrubbed the
wet saddle with a sleeve before he rose into it. Breakers of sand
rolled from the nearby bluff to sting his face and when he lowered
his head water poured from the crease of his hat into his crotch.
Wind went scuffing and squealing along the earth and roared in his
ears and was a cry across the world.</p>

<p><i>"Hup-hup."</i>
</p>

<p>The pack horses moved into single file, the two cows followed
and the four dun oxen came after, swinging their heads at the
ground in fruitless foraging. He used both hands to jam down his
hat and made his way through a camp whose hundred
wagons&mdash;their canvas tops casting a pale glow against the gray
flicker of sand and rain&mdash;lay on a lava beach hard pressed
between bluff and river. Weather-whipped fires burned a violent
yellow, darkly dotted by crouched or moving shapes, and all through
camp was the constant traffic of loose stock herds moving westward
into a farther wall of mist.</p>

<p>At the river's edge log rafts pitched in the smashing rollers,
some half built, some fully freighted with lashed-down wagons and
ready to go; for after two thousand miles and five months of land
travel, this wagon train of four hundred people was readying itself
to make the last ninety miles into western Oregon by water through
the gorge of the Cascades.</p>

<p>Rice Burnett stopped his pack outfit before a large raft on
which two wagons&mdash;Lattimore's and Collingwood's&mdash;were
lashed fore and aft. Lattimore stood on the lava shore with the
raft's mooring rope wrapped around him, thin body swayed back and
forth by the raft's sluggish heaving. A sagged hat rim made eaves
around his ears, down which water steadily ran, and on his face was
the habitual fatigue of a malarial man.</p>

<p>"God-damn' country," he said, voice only a murmur against the
shout of the wind. "If I'd known it was like this I'd not come. I'm
ready to go but Collingwood's off shakin' hands somewhere."</p>

<p>Edna came from the near wagon and came ashore to stand beside
Burnett's horse. She said, "I'll walk a ways with you," and took
his arm when he dismounted. A man's overcoat gave her upper body an
extra heaviness; a shawl covered her head but rain blackened the
exposed part of her front hair and wetted her cheeks and lodged its
glittering droplets on her lashes. Her face was round and her mouth
broad&mdash;an erect and rather taut upper lip lying against the
lower lip's pronounced roll&mdash;and her lids partially closed on
brown eyes as she watched Burnett to create an air of
speculation.</p>

<p>Lattimore said "Now don't rove off where I got to go find
you."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "Collingwood won't be here for an hour." She
moved away with Burnett. "You'll reach the portage ahead of
us."</p>

<p>He nodded toward the river. "I expect so. You've got a rough
ride ahead, on the raft."</p>

<p>Waves rolled high and close-following on the Columbia's
wind-beaten breadth. Earlier departing rafts stood out to
midstream, rising in sluggish motion to ragged crests and falling
into watery valleys and vanishing behind long horizontal streamers
of spray. Through the day's dullness Burnett watched the
little-figured shapes of men strain at the rudder sweeps.</p>

<p>"I don't mind," said Edna. "Things don't bother me much.
Where'll I see you next?"</p>

<p>"At the portage."</p>

<p>"We might be late&mdash;and you'll have gone on."</p>

<p>"Then at Oregon City. We'll all gather there."</p>

<p>They skirted wagons and avoided ox teams dragging logs riverward
from the pine hill where the Methodist Mission lay; they watched a
woman crouched and crying before a fire's dense smoke. Groups of
men, heaving together with their concerted
"Now&mdash;now&mdash;now," moved wagons onto the rafts and other
men stood waist-deep in the November water and flinched when the
breaking surf slapped them. They passed Rinearson's fire. Edna's
glance went to the young men gathered there and stayed with them
until Moss Rinearson saw her, and then she looked quickly to
Burnett and went on with him.</p>

<p>At the far edge of camp he stopped. "No use for you to get any
wetter."</p>

<p>Her voice held half a teasing note, half a sweet tone. "At
Oregon City, for sure?"</p>

<p>"For sure."</p>

<p>"Sleep warm," she said and looked steadily at him.</p>

<p>"Lone man never sleeps warm."</p>

<p>The answer delighted her and her lids again framed a glance
meant to provoke him. "It could be better, couldn't it?"</p>

<p>He rose to the saddle and lifted his coat collar against the
slashing rain, and he looked down upon her with his smile. Wind
colored him and stiffened his face until it assumed a lank length
between temples and jaw point. His eyes were gray, made brisk at
this moment by his humor; the edges of his hair showed a dark
copper cast rough hair, heavy hair. He had an English nose,
high-bridged and prominent, and a long mouth.</p>

<p>"You're slow," she said.</p>

<p>"There'll be a time to answer that."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and watched him ride into the stormy
morning's twilight, body bent and head bent, and when he looked
back she saw his weather face&mdash;everything pulled inside. She
waved and returned through camp.</p>

<p>Abreast the Rinearson fire she paused at the circle of young men
and stood across the blaze from Moss. He was the middle brother of
the three Rinearson boys and, at twenty, a year older than she. She
spread her hands before the fire, slowly revolving them; she gave
each man around the circle a moment of personal interest before
settling her attention on Moss.</p>

<p>"Where's Whit?"</p>

<p>"Went down the trail with the stock."</p>

<p>She moved around the fire. "You ought to wear a heavy coat."</p>

<p>"Wet heavy coat's just as cold as a wet thin one."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, and touched his chest with a passing hand; then
she looked beyond the group and noticed Rice turned on the saddle,
watching her, and she left the fire and went on through camp with
her head lowered in thought. When she came to the raft she found
George Collingwood ready to go. Her father's futile irritation fell
upon her.</p>

<p>"We been waitin' twenty minutes."</p>

<p>George Collingwood shook his head, laughing at her. "No, I just
got here." He was forty, more than twice her age, but his light
blue eyes paid her a strong interest. He wore heavy buckskin
gloves, a fine plaid coat, and beneath his hat the rim of curled
yellow hair showed. She delayed a moment to let him have his look,
then moved to the raft and entered the near wagon's half darkness,
catching the voices of her brother and her mother in the far wagon
where Mrs. Collingwood was. Rain drummed loud on the canvas and the
smell of wet wool clothes and oiled harness and bacon rose around
her. She heard Collingwood say:</p>

<p>"You got any tobacco before we push away, Ben?"</p>

<p>"There's a twist in a can beside my toolbox."</p>

<p>She moved to the toolbox and reached for the can, but a thought
drew her back and she waited while Collingwood came over the raft
and crawled through the wagon's front opening. He said: "You know
where his tobacco can is?"</p>

<p>She settled to her knees on a straw tick and lifted the can. He
crouched beside her and the edge of his body came against her and
stayed there while she opened the can and got the chunk of tobacco.
He reached for it, hand brushing her shoulder, and his pressure
grew against her; she turned her head to observe the tense line
across his mouth and the bright shine of his eyes. She didn't stir,
but as she watched him a speculative smile came about her mouth and
her curiosity was plain. His head came tentatively forward, and
withdrew; he laid a hand on her knee and pushed himself to his
feet. She raised her glance to hold his attention.</p>

<p>Outside her father impatiently called: "For the love of God,
let's start."</p>

<p>Collingwood murmured "Edna," in a smooth, stroking voice and
turned from the wagon. She remained kneeling; she stared at the
dark canvas before her, eyes half closed and her face returning to
its smooth calm. The log chains began to groan, the raft increased
its pitching and the wagon swayed from side to side. She drew a
deep breath and smiled into the darkness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>THE camp and its echoes faded, the whirling rain mists closed
in. Along this well-worn Indian runway loose stock bands moved
ahead of Burnett toward the throat of the gorge forty miles away,
but he saw nothing of them in the blind day. The river was beside
him, bearing its freight of scattered rafts, and though some of
these were forty feet long and sixteen wide the wind-trenched water
shook them as though they were small boats. The trail, too rough
for wagons, crossed an ancient field of lava and moved through a
succession of sand dunes until, about two hours from camp, it rose
in stairstep creases along the face of a hill. Around noon of an
already dying day he found himself following the rim of a bluff
loosely covered by pine. The river was a thousand feet below him,
unseen in the fog, and he was smothered by the twilight of a
cloud's breaking center, and wind shook him on the saddle and the
tumultuous rain came upon him in hard-breaking drops. He was
thoroughly wet, his shoes were water-filled; coldness passed from a
burning to an ache and finally to a lack of sensation in legs and
knuckles and ears.</p>

<p>There was a way to handle weather and the way&mdash;lying in a
man's thoughts&mdash;was to retreat from the surface misery and
build a wall and when the weather broke through that wall, to
retreat to a deeper layer of flesh and build another wall. There
was never any danger until the last wall was breached and the
weather reached that small center cell which housed the will to
exist. At that point a man sat as a spectator and listened to the
battle between his will and the thing which came to kill him.</p>

<p>Loose soil and pine stems whipped by; overhead the steady hiss
of the wind kept on. The horses footed steadily forward from one
rocky ridge to another, down a long slope and across the insecure
ford of a swollen little river near its junction with the big
river; and somewhere in the noisy day he heard a man's weak voice
cry out. Fifty feet distant a horse stood on a rocky flat with its
rump to the wind. A few cows stood under the shelter of a tree and
a small tent, ripped from its pegs, slapped back and forth beneath
a branch to which its peak had been tied. Riding in that direction
he discovered Alpheus Stricklin's head stuck out from a cocoon of
soaked blankets.</p>

<p>Burnett got down and squatted before that hollow face with its
fringe of curly red whiskers. Stricklin's eyes were so deep and
round that they seemed to have no pupils. A rank odor came from
blankets and from man. Too sick to light a fire or to recapture the
tent which had blown off its pegs, Stricklin lay in the day's full
blast and could not muster energy enough to shiver.</p>

<p>"How long you been here?"</p>

<p>"Two days."</p>

<p>Burnett walked to a pack horse, hauled off its pack and got an
ax. He chopped a set of pegs and tacked the tent cloth around
Stricklin; he cut the rope which held the tent's peak to the pine
bough and let the canvas lie collapsed over Stricklin. He rustled
through the trees and collected a stack of wood and from the pack
he got a handful of pitch kindling and crouched close to the ground
to build a fire under the shelter of his coat. He stood by until
the fire caught on well; and he made a frame of wood chunks around
it and found his coffee-pot and filled it from the river and laid
it over the fire.</p>

<p>"When did you eat?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday morning," said Stricklin. "Nothing stays down."</p>

<p>"Any fresh blankets?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Burnett dragged his pack near the fire. He poured half the water
from the coffee-pot into a small bucket, dropped a chunk of jerked
beef into the bucket and a hand scoop of coffee into the pot; and
put both utensils over the fire. Stricklin made a feeble scratching
on the tent cloth and pulled it back until his head was in the
weather. "Jesus, what a smell."</p>

<p>"Crawl out of there and sit up to the fire."</p>

<p>"Can't make it."</p>

<p>Burnett squatted over the man. He shoved back his hat to keep
its drip from Stricklin and short, sharp critical lines of
attention sprang around his eye corners. "You're a down horse and
you've decided to die. Crawl out of there."</p>

<p>Stricklin said nothing but Burnett thought he saw the slight
shining of resentment, and he reached down and ripped the
protecting canvas from Stricklin's body. Stricklin brought an arm
from the blankets, doubled his fist and struck at Burnett's face.
Burnett laughed at him and pulled the blankets back, rolling
Stricklin half over toward the fire. Stricklin kicked out with a
leg. Burnett seized the man at the shoulders and dragged him to the
edge of the fire.</p>

<p>"Sit up to it," he said and took his ax into the nearby trees to
make more wood from the broken deadfall limbs. Stricklin curled
himself at the fire and steam rose from his clothes and fresh rain
sparkled in his whiskers. His deep-set eyeballs rolled from side to
side as he kept his attention on Burnett. Burnett got a cup from
the pack and filled it from the simmering bucket.</p>

<p>"Sit up, Alpheus."</p>

<p>"Can't make it."</p>

<p>Burnett circled the fire and took Stricklin by one shoulder and
hauled him to a sitting position; he steadied the man with gentle
cuffs with his palm until Stricklin made a gesture of protest.
Burnett dropped his hand but stood by to be sure Stricklin didn't
capsize again.</p>

<p>"All right," said Stricklin irritably. "All right."</p>

<p>Burnett handed over the cup and went into the trees to continue
his wood gathering. When he came back the cup lay empty on the
ground.</p>

<p>Stricklin had both hands across his belly and showed his misery.
"It's started again." He lifted his glance to Burnett and dropped
it. Sick as he was, he was embarrassed. "I can't get up."</p>

<p>Burnett lifted Stricklin by the armpits and walked ten feet from
the fire; he slipped down the man's galluses and trousers and he
spraddled his legs and lowered Stricklin to a squatting position.
Stricklin wrapped his arms around Burnett and butted his head
against the latter's stomach for support; he swayed like a
half-filled sack of flour and body cramps shuddered him and the
coldness of the day made fine tremors through him. "What a hell of
a thing," he groaned. "Jesus, I'm ashamed."</p>

<p>"It's all right, Alpheus. Let 'er go."</p>

<p>"No use. Nothing in me."</p>

<p>Burnett pulled up the man's trousers and guided him back to the
fire. He filled the cup from the bucket and passed the cup to
Stricklin. "Keep at it." He built the woodpile until it was big
enough to last a night; he fried himself a chunk of bacon and
warmed himself with the coffee. Three boys crossed the little river
with a band of stock and disappeared in the rain-downed twilight;
wind ripped through the timber and smashed down branches and felled
a tree, and rain walked across the earth wave after wave. Burnett
took Stricklin's blankets from the collapsed tent and laid them
flat in the rain, weighted by rocks, for washing. He pulled up the
tent pegs and dragged the canvas around Stricklin. After he had
restored the loose pack to its proper horse he stood a short time
at the fire, attempting to read Stricklin's face.</p>

<p>"Keep the fire going. I'll leave the bucket with the meat in it.
Just work away at it. You be all right?"</p>

<p>Stricklin dropped his head. He said something which was lost in
the wind; he raised his voice. "Sure."</p>

<p>"That diarrhea lasts about three days. You've had two. Lay over
tomorrow." He got in the saddle but delayed his departure; for
Stricklin's eyes, fixed on him, were like the entrances to the
emptiest of tunnels, and around his mouth an expression had
settled. It wasn't sickness, Burnett thought, as he turned away to
collect his pack outfit. He found the trail and worked his way
about a rocky point and up another ridge. The image of the
expression, with its unremembered familiarity, haunted him. A good
mile down the trail he stopped his horses and sat still a full
minute, and at last he shook his head and turned back to
Stricklin's camp.</p>

<p>Stricklin had dropped flat before the fire and was entirely
covered by the tent. He pushed the canvas back when he heard
Burnett and sat up, and the stiffness dissolved from his face and
left it weak; his eyes glinted in the firelight. Burnett said:
"It'll be dark in half an hour so I might as well camp here." He
unloaded the packs and covered them with the canvas and let the
animals drift. He dragged his bedroll to the fire and crawled into
it and lighted his pipe.</p>

<p>"What's your age, Alpheus?"</p>

<p>"Fifty-three." Stricklin sat up and filled his cup from the
bucket; he curled both hands around the cup and sucked at the beef
water. "If I'd known it was like this, I'd never come West. It's
too late for men old as me. I had a good farm in Missouri."</p>

<p>"You'll feel different&mdash;couple nights' sleep and a few good
meals."</p>

<p>"I'll put ten years' sweat into a new farm, but it won't please
me no more than the last. It's not the constitution of a man to be
happy with what he's got...This stuff ain't cramping me as much. I
think I'll sleep." He fell back and pulled the tent over him.</p>

<p>Burnett left his bedroll and squatted beside Stricklin. He
straightened the folds of the tent beneath the man, and wrapped the
upper part over him. He laid a hand momentarily on Stricklin's
shoulder. "You were at the forks of the creek for a couple of
minutes," he said, and returned to his bedroll. He was hungry, but
he had a short stock of food which had to last him until he got to
Oregon City or Fort Vancouver and so he lighted another pipe,
stored his boots in the bedroll and fed the fire.</p>

<p>Stricklin said: "Been married?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How about that Edna girl?"</p>

<p>Burnett made no answer. Presently Stricklin said: "What'd you do
back East?"</p>

<p>"A little clerkin', a little farming. I was in the Rockies
trapping a couple years. Soldiered in the dragoons."</p>

<p>"If you'd not come back I'd been dead by morning."</p>

<p>"You're not that sick."</p>

<p>"Sick is one thing. This is another. It's like hanging to a rope
forty feet off ground. Pretty soon you can't hold on and you don't
give a damn anyhow."</p>

<p>Burnett settled into his bedroll and scrubbed hip and shoulder
along the ground to make comfortable trenches for them. Night moved
in full of sound; the little river roared over its stones, the
racing clouds broke above camp and rain rattled like buckshot and
blackness closed on him as the jaws of a vise. It was aloneness
which had broken through Stricklin's last wall. Nature, hating the
solitary thing&mdash;for the solitary thing has no
function&mdash;had placed in man a sense of incompleteness which
made him drift toward others; denied this closeness, he shrank and
died. Not that she cared; for man was a vessel she created by the
millions, and it didn't matter how many of these claypots were
cracked along the way so long as a few survived to transmit the
liquid she had poured into them; it was the liquid that mattered to
her, not the pot. Man's dream of dignity was his own creation, not
hers, and his suffering came of trying to make the dream real
against the indifference of earth and sky to his individual
fate.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>MORNING came to him as a feeling he had slept long enough; there
was no other sign of day. Wind rushed along the river's trench and
burst into violent eddies; throughout the night he had heard trees,
unpinned by the rain-softened soil, go down. The air had a biting
chill and now and then the screen of rain thickened with the
half-solid shape of snow; the little river, when he went to it, had
risen two feet. He built the fire, he put on the coffee-pot and
fried breakfast. Alpheus Stricklin sat up with the tent around him
and relished his meal.</p>

<p>"I'm over the hump but I'll lay by today. Tomorrow mornin' I'll
be fine."</p>

<p>Burnett spent an hour dragging wood to the fire pile; he was
another hour bringing in his strayed animals. He packed, he
crouched at the fire to smoke a pipe and to soak in a store of heat
against a day he knew would be bad. He rose and looked at Stricklin
a moment. "Anything else?"</p>

<p>"No. Good luck."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The trail through the timber was a tunnel of furious sound. Wind
knocked him around the saddle when he rose to the crest of a small
ridge, and wet snow spatted more frequently against him. He
followed a narrow strip of open land two or three miles toward a
shadowy barrier, and in the first dismal daylight this barrier
became a rocky point pressing hard upon a river whose half-mile
surface was corrugated by spray-frosted waves closely following
each other. Little by little he was crowded toward the water, the
trail twisting out to the beach, climbing over the shale slopes
which set up minor avalanches under the feet of his horses,
threading gloomy aisles between moss-green rock pillars. Near noon
he paused in the shelter of a cottonwood thicket to smoke a pipe,
glad to escape the wind's beating for a short time; the farther he
rode during the afternoon, the tighter was the river caught between
the mountain's jaws, the more relentlessly blew the wind and
harsher became the weather. From time to time he saw rafts
wallowing in the water, made sluggish by the extra weight of solid
ice around wheels and wagon beds.</p>

<p>It was growing dark at four o'clock when he came upon a meadow
cramped at the base of the lava palisades and found Whitley
Rinearson and the two Lockyears before a fire. With them was Watt
Irish, a boy of fourteen shivering within his shabby coat; in the
background the hundred Rinearson cattle stood dumb against the
blast.</p>

<p>The boy was obviously miserable clear into his bones. He turned
to Burnett with plain relief. "I got two cows mixed in with their
stock and I got to get 'em out."</p>

<p>Whit Rinearson gave a short laugh. "You can wait till we get to
the portage."</p>

<p>"They'll all be mixed up in the dark by then and I'll not see
'em. I got to get 'em now."</p>

<p>Whit Rinearson said, "Walk in and get your cows," and again let
go with his brief laugh.</p>

<p>"I can't walk through all those horns," said Watt.</p>

<p>Burnett dismounted and came to the fire. He said to Whit
Rinearson: "You're slow&mdash;you started three hours ahead of
me."</p>

<p>"Cattle strayed last night and we had a hell of a time."</p>

<p>"It's just two cows," said Watt Irish to Burnett. "I got to get
'em out." The weather wizened his face and in the firelight he
seemed to Burnett not so much a boy as a stunted man; he had his
feet braced apart, he doggedly nourished his hope, but the strain
of facing these three unsympathetic men had been hard with him.</p>

<p>It was now half snow and half rain, white flakes streaking
across the firelight; wind boomed along the gorge and the river
surf crashed on the rocks of this ragged shore. Burnett crouched at
the flames.</p>

<p>"What's the harm of snaking out the boy's two cows?"</p>

<p>"We got trouble enough," said Whit Rinearson, shortly. "He can
wait, or do what he damned pleases."</p>

<p>"There's your permission," said Burnett to Watt Irish. "Go get
'em."</p>

<p>"On foot?"</p>

<p>"Take my horse," said Burnett.</p>

<p>Watt Irish turned immediately to the horse and pulled himself to
the saddle. Cal Lockyear spoke to him. "I've got some stock in that
bunch. You stampede anything and I'll break your God-damned
head."</p>

<p>"Not in this weather&mdash;they won't," said Burnett. He turned
his hands at the fire; presently he lifted his chin to catch the
weight of all three sets of eyes on him.</p>

<p>Whit Rinearson said: "Not right for a kid to have his way
against men."</p>

<p>"The boy's dead-beat."</p>

<p>"If he's goin' to play man," said Whit, "let him stand it like a
man."</p>

<p>"You play it well as he does and you'll be doing fine," answered
Burnett.</p>

<p>He looked beyond the group to see young Irish cut through the
cattle; he brought his glance back to Cal Lockyear. The man wore
buckskins, a big blanket capote around his shoulders, and a
trapper's round fur hat; his neck came up as a stout column through
the capote's collar to flat ears, a round heavy chin and black
eyes. Chest and shoulders stretched the capote; he stood motionless
against the weather and seemed not to feel it.</p>

<p>"If this herd belonged to me," he said in a touchy tone, "I'd
not permit the kid to fool around it."</p>

<p>"Squirrel's pretty small game for a buffalo hunter," said
Burnett.</p>

<p>Cal Lockyear retorted, "You can go to hell."</p>

<p>"Right now that would be a comfort," said Burnett.</p>

<p>Watt Irish came from the herd with his two cows and left the
horse beside Burnett. He spread his hands at the fire, he crept
closer to the heat and he watched the growing night, its
anticipated misery forming around his mouth.</p>

<p>"It will get no better looking at it," said Burnett. "Get on
before your cows stray again." He watched the small shape bend
against the wind and fade with the two cows into the snow-streaked
darkness; he rose to catch the fire on another quarter of his
body.</p>

<p>Whit Rinearson had baited Watt Irish for no better reason than
to cause somebody trouble. Whit was the senseless one of the
Rinearson tribe, and needed to feel a lot of pain before he'd ever
know anything about pity; or maybe he had been making a display of
toughness for the benefit of Cal Lockyear, who was another breed of
cat entirely.</p>

<p>Having put in his time trapping through the Rockies, Burnett
understood Lockyear better than the people of the train did, for
Lockyear had been in the mountains too and such a life reduced a
man to the lean meat of his character. Lockyear would do as he
pleased, let others take care, and that part of him Burnett
respected since he had some of it himself.</p>

<p>But there was about this muscular man a mixture of the unsure
and of the threatening. He was thirty, Burnett's age, and thus old
enough to have achieved some consistency of view, yet he was more
frequently unpredictable than reasonable. He was by turns boastful,
rudely humorous and overbearing; he could swing from a civil manner
to surly silence in the space of a breath; he had spells of affable
familiarity which, when not properly received, turned at once to
insolence; he had great extremes in him and seemed to care nothing
for the effect he made on anybody; and though he usually accorded
Burnett a better manner than he gave to others&mdash;he showed
little liking for the farmers and shopkeepers and mechanics
composing this train&mdash;he was nevertheless offended by
Burnett's defense of Watt and couldn't quite restrain his
ill-humor.</p>

<p>"You want the kid's mother to keep you warm nights? Hell, that's
not hard to do. Go ask her. Won't have to ask twice. She's lookin'
around. She'd take anything that came&mdash;even a cripple like
Veen."</p>

<p>In the background Veen stirred, gave Burnett a short glance and
dropped his eyes to the fire. Whit Rinearson let go with a flat
laugh. Burnett looked from one man to another, ignoring the remark;
he turned again to soak in the heat.</p>

<p>"This ain't our country," said Lockyear. "It's Siwash country.
Up in Jackson Hole we'd be fixed for winter: good cabin, plenty of
meat, plenty of tobacco, no trouble."</p>

<p>"Plenty of cold," added Burnett.</p>

<p>"Dry cold. This air's too wet. What'd we come for?"</p>

<p>"I got to thinking like an Indian," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"That's all right. That's fine."</p>

<p>"Fine for an Indian."</p>

<p>"Well, by God, there's times when I like Indians better than
whites. These people&mdash;I don't know. They ain't our style.
Let's go back and eat buffalo hump."</p>

<p>"Nothing there any more, Cal. Beaver's trapped out. No market
for furs. Ever meet Bill Cash?"</p>

<p>"On the Green once. Bigger liar than Beckworth."</p>

<p>"Fifty years old, looked eighty. Ate his meat raw because he was
too damned lazy to cook it. Crippled up by rheumatism. Lived past
his prime. Good old days gone and no good ones left. He'll drift
around the mountains looking for men not there any more. Then he'll
start talkin' to those fellows. Then he'll crawl off in the brush
and die."</p>

<p>"You been sleepin' cold," said Lockyear. "What you
want&mdash;"</p>

<p>Burnett said, "Now give that a thought before it comes out," and
leveled his glance across the fire; he was cool, he was smiling.
Insolence gleamed in Lockyear's eyes, the prompting of temper was
there, the reckless moment was there; then he let go with a rough
laugh and passed the challenge by. Burnett turned to his horse,
used his sleeve to scrub snow slush from the saddle and rose into
it. Riding over the clearing, he reached the rocky trail and once
more followed its crooked course.</p>

<p>Two hours later, in the trembling blackness of a hard snowstorm,
he heard the rising roar of the river rapids. Fires burned ahead of
him and rafts landed from their down-river run, crowded the rocky
beach. Even at this hour men worked their wagons ashore from these
rafts, to remount the wheels in preparation for tomorrow's land
journey to the foot of the rapids. Neither cargo nor passengers
could live through that particular six miles of water; when the
portage had been made, the rafts would be let go to run the
cascades empty, would be retrieved in the calmer current below, and
would again be loaded for the last thirty-odd miles to the mouth of
the Sandy. From there on the final two days' journey into Oregon
City would be by land.</p>

<p>He drifted forward in search of a camp spot. Traffic had churned
the ground into foot-deep slush, and livestock milled about in
search of forage, and wagons and fires and rough shelters lay
close-crowded along a narrow strip of land between river and gorge
wall. He passed and hailed the Kitchens and the Millards and he
swung his horse to avoid Lorenzo Buck, who crouched close to the
earth in search of some lost object. Directly beyond, Burnett came
into the glow of the Gay fire. Katherine Gay saw him.</p>

<p>"Put up here, Rice."</p>

<p>A ridgepole ran between Gay's landed wagon and a nearby fir;
over the ridgepole hung a large sheet of canvas beneath which
several people were gathered. Six of them were Gays, Katherine, her
fourteen-year-old brother Joe, her parents&mdash;John and Martha
Gay&mdash;and her grandparents, Sophia and the Old Man. The Howards
and the Mclvers had joined the group to save the work of making
their own fires. Dr. Ralph Whitcomb, who as a single man had shared
one fire or another all across the plains, stood beside Harris Eby;
and though the doctor was neither short nor thin, he seemed to be
so against Eby, who was by far the largest man in the train, six
feet six of bone and hard tissue, great feet, thick legs,
maul-shaped fists, and an upper body which had a kind of treelike
sweep to it; all of this topped by a blond head and a round and
quiet face. On Eby's other side was Lot White, though Lot's vanity
always made him step far enough back from Eby to make the
comparison less pronounced; and Lot, as usual with him, was
involved in rather loud and positive talk. He broke off long enough
to cast a short glance at Burnett, to say "Hello, Rice," and to
wait for his audience's attention to return.</p>

<p>Though canvas and wagon afforded some protection there was no
escape from the freezing whip of the wind, or the inslanted snow,
or the mud underfoot, or the reverberations of the river in its
cataract. Burnett picked an empty spot not far from the fire for
his pack pile and unloaded his horses with a slowness he could do
nothing about; he had no feeling in feet, hands or knees, and he
watched his animals drift into the night and pitied them. He stood
well away from the fire to scrub some kind of sensation back into
ears and nose.</p>

<p>Katherine brought him a cup of coffee and tested his overcoat
with her hand. "Have you got anything dry?"</p>

<p>The heat of the cup scarcely registered in his palms though it
scorched his tongue. "Buried somewhere in that pile."</p>

<p>She pushed him toward the fire. She looked around the circle and
said to Lot White: "You've got the warmest spot. Move over."</p>

<p>Lot White said: "Rafts still in the river, comin'?"</p>

<p>"A lot of 'em," Burnett said.</p>

<p>"Lot," said Katherine Gay, "move over."</p>

<p>Lot White gave her a glance and reluctantly moved. He was a
short, turkey-cock man with an upper body shaped by his
blacksmithing trade; his hat, thrust back, showed a half-bald head;
his eyes were a shade of blue too light for his complexion, thereby
lending an unusual insistence to his glance; his mouth, though
forceful, was thin enough to be without color, and his jaw was
stubborn and his words came out with a kind of tumbling effect, as
though sped by the pressure of other impatient words behind.</p>

<p>"They should have sense enough to not creep down this river by
night. Out there the weather's too much to bear, and if they
overshoot this place they'll be in the rapids and that's the
end."</p>

<p>John Gay said: "We ought to keep these fires bright so they can
see the way in." He looked to his son Joe. "If you're fairly warm
go rummage up a few more big branches."</p>

<p>Half beyond the reach of the fire, Joe Gay was overtaken by Dr.
Whitcomb's advice. "Be careful you don't get hit. The wind's
knocking dead branches down like rain."</p>

<p>"He won't get hit," said Lot White; and said it with such
certainty that Dr. Whitcomb's glance moved to him with its small
amusement.</p>

<p>"You trying to throw a mantle of mercy over him, Lot?"</p>

<p>"He won't get hit."</p>

<p>"If he's standing in the right place at the right time, he
certainly will," said the doctor.</p>

<p>Lot White slapped both hands briskly together and meant to carry
on the talk. Katherine Gay stopped it. "Let each other alone.
You're both old enough to know you can't change anything by
talk."</p>

<p>"Lot feels he's got a call to change me," said the doctor. He
settled himself at the foot of the wagon wheel, his face reddened
and made cheerful by the firelight. "What reason brought you to
Oregon, Lot?"</p>

<p>Lot White searched the doctor's face for guile. Then he said: "I
couldn't abide slavery. I won't live where it is." He stared
steadily at Whitcomb. "You meanin' to make fun of that?"</p>

<p>"No," said the doctor, "that's a good reason."</p>

<p>"You got a way of lookin' and just listenin' without believin',"
said Lot White. "It's a way that disturbs people, for they think
you're smart because you're a doctor, and if you don't believe in
things, they get to wonderin' if they're right. You can't do
that."</p>

<p>"That's right, Lot," said Ralph Whitcomb, and smiled at Lot
White's renewed rise of suspicion. "So, why don't you let my
beliefs alone?"</p>

<p>"Because you believe wrong and it's my bounden duty to make you
see it."</p>

<p>Whitcomb was too weary to laugh outright. "You ought to be a
Jesuit.</p>

<p>"And you ought not use education against a man that's got none,"
said Lot.</p>

<p>The doctor's smile disappeared. "You're right about that, too.
Well, a Jesuit's a man who'll use any argument to gain his
end."</p>

<p>Lot White meant to carry on with the talk but Whitcomb turned
from him to John Gay. "Why'd you come here?"</p>

<p>Gay had been only half attentive; his thoughts were with the
fire, which he pushed together with his boots. He looked back
toward the raft pitching in the water, to the ropes which held it
to the shore trees. He stepped to the edge of the covering canvas
and shook away its load of snow, and returned to the fire. The
first sloping of middle age was visible in his shoulders and the
first settling had begun around his mouth, to give it an extra
pinch of resolution. His arms were the long arms of the outdoor
worker, wristbones heavy, fingers enlarged and slightly bowed from
the year of grasping and twisting and squeezing. His face was
composed rather than sensitive; without formal schooling, he was
one of those natively intelligent men who move slowly from point to
point in their thinking.</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "I suppose it was the land I wanted." He looked
toward his wife. "Anyhow, that's what I told Martha." He stopped to
replace a rolled-away chunk of firewood. "Most of the men of this
train lie a little about their reasons. We've all got some sort of
itch in our feet to try a fresh place, and that's almost the main
reason in some of these fellows."</p>

<p>"That's what I think about," said Martha Gay, "when I remember
all the nice furniture I couldn't bring and the new apple orchard
just ready to bear." She looked steadily at her husband. "Sometimes
I just hate the people who bought our place."</p>

<p>John Gay turned to the doctor. "You're such a hand to ask
questions. What for yourself&mdash;what brought you?"</p>

<p>"My maternal grandfather was a young man in the Lewis and Clark
expedition. I listened to those stories for years."</p>

<p>Voices roughly shouted down the trail and the Rinearson cattle
broke through the fire's light toward the shelter. John Gay seized
a limb chunk and waved it before them, driving them back around the
wagon into the farther darkness; the steady stream of beasts moved
past, and Whit Rinearson and the Lockyears appeared in the light
and vanished.</p>

<p>"They'll knock over half the shelters in camp," said John
Gay.</p>

<p>The doctor got up and put his hands to the fire for a last
warming. "I should look at Provost's baby again."</p>

<p>Burnett said: "If you've got any whisky, give Mrs. Irish enough
to mix Watt a toddy."</p>

<p>Whitcomb's departure broke the group, for the Howards and
Mclvers and Lot White soon left. John Gay said, "I hear somebody on
the river," and moved beyond the firelight's reach as Grandmother
Sophia and the Old Man, after soaking in a last warmth from the
fire, entered the wagon.</p>

<p>Katherine walked to the food box and in a moment came back with
a plate of beans and molasses for Burnett. She tipped fresh coffee
into his cup from the big pot on the fire and settled between
Burnett and Harris Eby, the latter balanced on his heels. Wind
fanned hot tobacco ashes from Eby's pipe into his face; he batted
the ashes away, idly laughing. Behind these three, Martha Gay
looked on with a clouded interest and seemed to study her daughter
as a stranger.</p>

<p>Through wind's blast and river's roar a man's lonely voice cried
across the water from a raft; a lantern glinted on the raft and was
lost as the raft sank deep into furious rollers. Shore voices
called outward and the man shouted back. Somewhere behind this raft
were others searching their way down-river, for far away a faint
calling survived the night's rattle and rush and thunder. John Gay,
lost in the snow flurry not more than twenty feet from the fire,
flung out the hardest shout he could produce.</p>

<p>"Turn in here&mdash;be quick&mdash;turn in&mdash;bad water
below!"</p>

<p>Katherine said: "This will be a terrible place tomorrow with all
the wagons landing."</p>

<p>"Terrible place now," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"Turn around and let the other side get dry."</p>

<p>He reversed himself before the fire. She adjusted herself toward
him, thereby placing her back to Harris Eby; and suddenly Martha
Gay said, "I think I'll go to bed"&mdash;and caught her daughter's
eyes and held them a long moment, and went to the wagon.</p>

<p>Rice said: "There'll be some weak stock dying tonight."</p>

<p>She said: "Be some people dying, too, if they didn't believe the
trip was almost over." She took a small branch and crouched to
worry the red-white coals about on their bed. The fire soothed her,
her face lost its weariness and her mouth alternately loosened and
grew firm as her thoughts swung. John Gay's shouted warning rode
the windy night again and woke an answering halloo from somewhere
on the river. The girl drew her shoulders in; a look of pity
crossed her face. Upstream a short distance many men were taking a
raft shoreward through the blackness, and a woman cried, and in the
farther distance a gun went off as a signal.</p>

<p>Burnett's square pack pile slowly changed to a round lump as
snow built drifts around it, and the campfire was a single bright
cell of warmth in a smothered world. Wind cried shrill at the sharp
wagon corners and filled the upper air with tumult as it slashed
through the fir tops; a loose bucket went banging over the shore
rocks, a lone horse thrust its head through the snow screen and
stood with its crusted mane and its eyes shining agate green
against the light. Burnett went to the pack pile to pull his
blanket roll from the protecting canvas. Bitterness began one step
beyond the fire's reach; he was cold again when he dragged the roll
beside the fire.</p>

<p>"Get your feet dry first," Katherine said.</p>

<p>He twisted his boots between his hands and found them soaked
solid to his feet. Harris Eby rose and moved over; he planted a
knee against Burnett's chest, clasped his hands around one boot at
a time and pulled them off with such force that Burnett fell back
into the snow. He laughed, as much at himself as at Burnett.
"Something had to give, boots or feet." He set the boots against
the fire, smile turning his face peaceful; the shrewd blue eyes
flashed in the light, fell upon Burnett and turned to Katherine.
The girl's glance rose along this immense column of a man and she
patted the huge hand hanging near her.</p>

<p>"If you ever got mad," said Burnett, "you'd do considerable
damage."</p>

<p>Eby found pleasure in the thought. "Pull the trees down one at a
time, push the cabins flat, kick holes in the earth...But I never
get mad. It was left out of my system."</p>

<p>"No, I saw you put out once," she said. "You remember the
Bonesteele brothers?"</p>

<p>"Long time back," said Eby.</p>

<p>"Not so long. About ten years. It was just after my fourteenth
birthday."</p>

<p>"Thirteenth," said Eby. "Because when you were fourteen you'd
moved to the house by the creek."</p>

<p>"He never forgets anything," said Katherine to Burnett. "He even
remembers when I was born."</p>

<p>"I do," said Eby. "I was three and my mother came home and told
about it, and same day she got some flowers and I carried the
flowers over to your mother and I saw you. They were lilacs. We had
a big bush in the yard."</p>

<p>"What about the Bonesteeles?" said Burnett.</p>

<p>"I wasn't exactly mad," said Eby. "More like aggravated."</p>

<p>"It was about me," said Katherine. "He was jealous. The oldest
one was Fred Bonesteele and he liked me. He had four brothers and I
guess he thought he'd run Harris off."</p>

<p>"Me," said Eby gently. "Run <i>me</i> off. Fred never had any
sense."</p>

<p>"Well," said Katherine, "Fred got his brothers and three or four
other boys to help him. You tell it, Harris."</p>

<p>Eby said, "It wasn't a great deal. I just pushed that bunch
around till the extra ones got tired and quit. Then I gathered up
the Bonesteele boys." He looked to Katherine, smiling, shaking his
head, and turned his attention to Burnett. "It was the backhouse.
It sat on the edge of a ravine. I shoved those five boys into the
backhouse and shut the door. It was pretty crowded with all five
inside and I had some trouble with the door. Then I gave the
backhouse a push and sent it down the ravine. But I really wasn't
mad." A note of regret came into his voice. "I wish I could get
mad. It would be better." He drew Burnett's boots, now steaming,
away from the fire. "How you going to get that pack string down
this river?"</p>

<p>"There's a trail on the north shore that goes into Fort
Vancouver. I'll ford over at the foot of the rapids."</p>

<p>"Bad thing," said Eby. He shifted from foot to foot. "Lord, I'm
tired." The fire made him lazy. He wanted to turn in but he didn't
want to leave the fire. Presently he gave out a sigh and mustered
his resolution and disappeared into the dense screen of snow.</p>

<p>"Good thing to know somebody a long time," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"Didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I ran away from home when I was about twelve. Mother had died
and I didn't like my stepmother."</p>

<p>"Never went back?"</p>

<p>"When I came out of the Rockies last year I went back. Old man
was dead and my stepmother didn't know me. Well, she did, but
pretended she didn't. She was afraid I might want some of the
property. I hunted up a couple of brothers and a sister, but it
wasn't much good. We were strangers." The sound of voices came on
in short, wind-disconnected bursts from upstream, lively and
imperative. "Raft in," he said. "I ought to go lend a hand."</p>

<p>"Sit still. There's men aplenty to help."</p>

<p>She knelt before the flames, heavy coat collar raised as a frame
around her neck, shawl drawn over her head to shield the heavy
piles of corn-yellow hair. Her skin was light and her eyes were of
that shade of blue sometimes seen at early twilight when shadows
lay powdery against brush thickets. The lowered position of head
and shoulders gave her a false air of submission; she watched the
fire with a fascinated steadiness and its light sharpened the
angles of jaw and throat.</p>

<p>He built the fire and opened his bedroll; he put boots and socks
at the foot of the roll and worked himself into the blankets. She
watched him, half seeing him and half thinking of him while some
other thought gave her expression an instant's austerity. It
presently disappeared before her smile and she rose and bent over
him and worked the bedroll's canvas around him. "You'll be a big
mound of snow by morning." She had a thought which amused her and
she reached back for a thin fir limb scorched bare by the fire and
jammed it upright into the ground at the head of the blanket roll.
"Here lies Rice. In the morning we'll know where to dig." She drew
the canvas on until it covered all but his eyes and head. "You
warm?"</p>

<p>"By patches."</p>

<p>"There's a glitter on your whiskers. You'd have a red beard if
you'd let it grow."</p>

<p>"That's sand shining. Didn't wash my face today. Why don't you
go to bed? Bad day tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I hate to go to bed."</p>

<p>"You're too old to be afraid of the dark."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of anything. I just hate to go to bed. Might
miss something." She folded the canvas around his face. "You look
like a wolf." She pulled it over his head and tucked it around him
and laid her hand on his shoulder and bent nearer. "Good night."
Rising, she watched the snow drift against his covered shape, and
she loitered a short time longer at the fire, and at last turned
into the wagon.</p>

<p>Flat against the ground, Burnett felt the trembling of the
earth; the sounds of the storm&mdash;of trees and river and wind
and snow&mdash;merged into an enormous roaring as night closed down
and the world went crazy.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>DAY was still somewhere far above this storm-choked mountain
trench, but in the small hours a sense of uneasiness came upon the
camp, and the fear of a weather trap worked from family to family
until they rose in common reaction as a herd would rise. Wagons
groaned unseen around Burnett, animals moved in dumb file past him,
and men shouted above the steady cry of the wind. He packed his
horses by the flagging light of the Gay fire, they having earlier
departed, and set his outfit along a trail which was already
crowded. The steady slantwise drive of the snow got at his sense of
balance until it seemed to him the world was tilted; waves of snow
broke against him like spray and lodged on his coat and slowly
hardened to scales of ice.</p>

<p>The traveling column moved sluggishly, halted, moved again.
Behind him a voice&mdash;it sounded like Old Daniel
Rinearson's&mdash;beat forward. "Get on up there&mdash;get on!" He
passed Harper Howard's wagon, the oxen yoked and waiting. Mrs.
Howard crouched before a fire with her arms thrust out as if to
pull heat into her. Her husband had a hand on her shoulder,
prompting her to rise, but even through the mealy blur Burnett saw
the misery on her face.</p>

<p>Blackness was solid beyond the camp site and beyond the string
of fires and there was no guide save the heaving shadow of the
wagon directly ahead of Burnett. He passed the trees and crawled up
a field of loose rock which ran tilted between bluff and river. At
the summit of this place a man waited to warn the passing outfits.
"Take the downgrade easy. You can break your wheels. Watch
beyond&mdash;it's narrow." The wagon's shadow ahead of Burnett
swayed and he heard the small avalanche which its wheels started
among the rocks.</p>

<p>Daniel Rinearson's voice cried forward once again and afterwards
fell still, and the column went on at its groping gait. Presently
the trail moved so close upon the river that Burnett saw the
exploding waters of that rough six-mile stretch which they were now
detouring, the cascades leaping as white fire across the black, and
the sound&mdash;like the tearing of cloth, like the rumble of
smothered explosions, like the escape of live steam&mdash;trembling
against him and disturbing the earth beneath his feet. He had been
more than an hour on the way and had made perhaps two miles of the
portage when a first daylight crept in and the scattered house-high
rocks began to stand forth along the trail and the gorge wall took
on substance close at hand, rising and vanishing in the upper
layers of the storm. The column worked its way between narrow
pillars and crossed a short lowland piece overgrown with willows.
Beyond the willows, as the daylight wanly grew, Burnett had a sight
of the column for perhaps three hundred feet: the straggling stock,
the great wagons slowly careening, men and women trudging in the
deep-churned muck with their bodies bent against the weather.
Leaving the willow flats the trail entered timber, newly fallen
trees indicating where the first riders had cut a way through
yard-high drifts. The column halted and he sat on the saddle and
felt numbness creep along his legs while the wind laid open his
face with its knife slashes; later the column lurched forward and
he passed Henry Provost's wagon off the trail, Provost and two
other men standing beside a dead ox. A good two hours onward from
this point brought Burnett to a pinched beach at the foot of the
rapids where the first arrivals were already scattered through the
loose trees; the cattle had begun to drift for shelter and fires
showed their first feeble eyes in the grayness.</p>

<p>John Gay's wagon stood hard by the river, the oxen unyoked and
gone, the canvas shelter stretched again from wagon to tree. Gay
crouched on his hands and knees&mdash;Katherine holding a blanket
around him&mdash;and blew his fire into life. When Burnett crawled
from the saddle thin ice rattled along his coat and his feet felt
no contact with the earth and his fingers, working at the pack
ropes, were iron rods which wouldn't bend. He struck them against
the packs until sensation came, and struck so hard that blood began
to break through the skin. From one of the packs he got a bundle of
thin pitchwood and went to the fire. Katherine's face was
stone-solid and in her eyes was a withdrawn expression as though,
beaten until sensation had left her, she waited dumbly to be beaten
again. He rubbed a finger along her cheek, he touched her ears.</p>

<p>"Feel that?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He got down beside Gay and drew the blanket around him. The
fire, scarcely larger than the size of Gay's cupped hands, burned
feebly on its dry shavings. Burnett slid the pitch splinters across
the flame, one by one, and Gay crowded the pile between his palms,
flame licking against his skin. He strangled on the smoke and
turned his head from side to side. Burnett built a wigwam of pitch
and sticks and the two nursed the fire until the blanket started to
scorch and the growing smoke drove them back. Gay scrubbed his
crying eyes and returned to the job. Young Joe came in with a load
of wood and Burnett got his ax to trim a short log nearby and to
drag it to the fire for a backstop. He wanted to stay here to soak
in a little heat but the weather warned him and he cruised the
trees until he found a skinny fir and dropped it and began to cut
the twelve-foot sections which, bound together, would make the
small raft he needed to freight his pack stuff across the river.
The wagon column moved steadily forward from the portage trail,
wagon after wagon swinging beside the river to find camp space, and
Rinearson's cattle drifted through the timber hollow-flanked, long
horns tossing, turned into wild game. Burnett kept his eyes on them
while he worked.</p>

<p>Watt Irish crawled from his wagon and ran toward the Gay fire,
calling to Katherine. "Mother wants you&mdash;her feet are
frozen."</p>

<p>Katherine still held the blanket to shield her father at the
fire. She dropped it, caught a bucket and went to the river; she
scooped up water and hurried on past Burnett and into the Irish
wagon. Young Watt came slowly back toward Burnett. He shook, and
braced his shoulders, and shook again.</p>

<p>"What have you got left for food?" asked Burnett.</p>

<p>"A piece of bacon and some onions."</p>

<p>"Go back to the fire and stay there," said Burnett.</p>

<p>Wind struck its sledgehammer blows on the camp and bent the
stunted firs and ripped the snow into shredded streamers. Coldness
was an acid burning holes through Burnett's body, and out of these
holes his energy ran in waste. The swinging of the ax brought
feeling back to feet and legs but his cracked hands continued to
bleed and his motions were awkward. He dragged the raft sections to
the beach and laid them together and he dropped another thin tree
and trimmed out crosspieces to bind the logs. He returned to his
pack for spikes, walking with his feet spread apart; coldness got
at his mind as well as his muscles and he had to push himself. He
spiked the crosspieces to the logs, tied a rope rowlock at each
side of the raft and cut two lengths from the tree to make his
oars. These he carried to the fire and went to his packs for his
jerked meat and his skillet. He pushed Lot White and Daniel
Rinearson aside and squatted at the fire to make his meal. The
crowd had grown larger.</p>

<p>Mrs. Irish sat at the fire, wrapped around in a patchwork quilt.
She let her head fall back against Katherine behind her; pain
flickered around her mouth, put there by the revived sensation in
her feet.</p>

<p>"I thought Oregon was gentle," said Lot White.</p>

<p>"We're in the neck of the funnel&mdash;it all collects
here."</p>

<p>More people came off the trail with the telltale walk of
exhaustion; it was a drunken walk, a swaying, drag-footed, loose
walk; their heads bounced on their shoulders, they were mudcaked
from ankle to knee and a thin sheeting of ice glittered on their
clothes. Ralph Whitcomb moved among them, touching ears and noses
and hands. Mrs. Howard came in and sank beside Mrs. Irish. She laid
both hands over her face and softly groaned.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lot, "it's worse by the hour. We might get frozen
in here. We had better move on fast."</p>

<p>John Gay said: "It's time to send a man back to cut loose the
rafts and let 'em run the cascades."</p>

<p>"I'll be surprised," said Lorenzo Buck, "if they come through
and not be torn apart."</p>

<p>"The risk's to be taken," said Gay.</p>

<p>"How'll we catch 'em when they get here?"</p>

<p>"Row out with my little raft," said Burnett, "and pick 'em
up."</p>

<p>"The man that goes back can't cut 'em all loose in one batch,"
said Lorenzo Buck. "Let's get this timed right."</p>

<p>The men in the circle looked toward the water, visualizing the
little raft going out, the pickup of the big raft, the towing of
the big raft ashore, the return of the little raft.</p>

<p>"Half an hour," said Ben Provost.</p>

<p>"Ever try to tow something heavy?" asked Ryal McIver.</p>

<p>"Forty-five minutes," said John Gay. "That's about right."</p>

<p>Daniel Rinearson said, "Who goes back?" He was, at sixty, a hale
man of moderate size, well-wrapped inside a buffalo coat; he had a
chunk of cloth wound around his head like a turban and this,
covering his ears, made him bend forward to catch what others said;
the exposed part of his face&mdash;a face with frosty brows hanging
above the horse-trading eyes, bold sharp nose, and a chin built
forward&mdash;was whipped to a barn-red by the wind. His scanning
glance stopped on young Watt Irish. "You go back and cut the rafts
loose."</p>

<p>"No," said Rice Burnett and went on eating.</p>

<p>Old Daniel's arguing countenance settled on Burnett. "It's fair
enough for the boy to lend us a hand."</p>

<p>Mrs. Irish had been listening with her eyes closed. She opened
them and looked from man to man, and then to her son standing at
the fire. "If it's thought he should, then he will. But I
wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Burnett. "He's beat-out."</p>

<p>"Well, then?" said Old Daniel and stood with his lower lip
rolled out.</p>

<p>"You've got more men in your family than anybody else," said
Burnett.</p>

<p>"Hell of a lot of free advice around here," said Old Daniel. He
took his silent poll of the crowd and drew his conclusions. "All
right, I'll send one of the boys."</p>

<p>John Gay gently said: "Which one, Daniel?"</p>

<p>"Does it make a difference between my sons?" said Old
Daniel.</p>

<p>"It's a responsible thing," said John Gay. "If they're cut loose
too close together we'll miss some, and then there's trouble. Don't
send Whit."</p>

<p>Daniel Rinearson tossed his head and let go with a loud laugh,
but his eyes lay resentfully on John Gay. He looked about once
more, sensing the will of the crowd. "All right, I'll send Ared."
Then he said, "Think he's got sense enough?"</p>

<p>Harper Howard said: "Send him soon. We got to get out of here.
We're short of food and it's still two-three days to Oregon City.
It wouldn't hurt if we had a solid meal of beef in us before we
started."</p>

<p>Daniel lowered his eyes to the fire, rubbed his hands together,
and ignored the quiet watching of the others. He said, "Well, I'll
get Ared on the way," and left the circle.</p>

<p>"Tell him to cut 'em loose forty-five minutes apart," called
John Gay. He looked to Harper Howard with a short break of humor.
"He didn't rise to it."</p>

<p>"Rich men don't rise," said Howard. "He wouldn't miss a couple
cows from that hundred. But, no, he don't give anything free."</p>

<p>Burnett finished his meal and shaped out the oars beside the
fire. The group around him constantly changed, other settlers
coming in from the trail to thaw the misery in them before they
went on to make camp. The day worsened and when he carried the oars
to the raft a dense snowfall blotted out the far shore. He carried
a third of his packs to the beach, slid the raft into the water and
loaded it. He put the oars through the rope-holes and shoved away;
twenty feet from shore the current seized him and the rollers,
quartering against the raft, threw it sidewise into the air; then
the rollers ran away from the raft and it dropped into the troughs
with a jar that snapped his head. Halfway over the river he saw a
small crowd watching him from the shore but when he reached the far
beach they were lost in the driving mist.</p>

<p>He recrossed and stood at the fire a moment, and reloaded and
crossed again; on the third trip, with the last of the packs, the
rollers caught him and rushed over him and only the support of the
oars held him aboard; he came wet to the fire and crouched there to
dissolve the iron ache in his bones.</p>

<p>"It's about time for the first raft," said John Gay.</p>

<p>Burnett got a coil of rope from his camp stuff; he cut it into
two sections, making a towrope for each end of the small raft.
Squatted low against the beach to scan the river, Lot White
suddenly said, "Think I see it comin'," and John Gay and Ben
Provost got aboard the little raft and flattened themselves on it
as Burnett rowed away. He saw the big raft come through the boiling
cascades, swinging end to end, sinking below the surface, rising
with all the force of the current behind it to leap from the water
like a clumsy fish.</p>

<p>Burnett maneuvered the small raft into midstream and dug the
oars deep to hold it; a wave rushed under him, seized an edge of
the raft and sucked it down, and buckshot pellets of spray drew a
sharp shout from Ben Provost. When they rose from the trough they
discovered the big raft dead ahead, slowly revolving in the
current. Burnett brought the small raft directly against it and
waited for the collision. Provost and Gay, half risen, clung to the
small raft's logs.</p>

<p>"Watch now," said Burnett.</p>

<p>The big raft came on, spray breaking over its downstream edge.
Burnett checked the small raft as a roller lifted it. He
back-oared. The small raft struck the big one and Provost and Gay
jumped and fell flat on the logs. Provost had the towrope from the
little raft; he squirmed around to make a tie on the big raft, and
signaled and rose to follow John Gay toward the lashed downsweep at
the far end of the big raft. Burnett swung the small raft away,
taking in the towrope's slack.</p>

<p>It was like pulling at a stump, for the force of a ten-mile
current surged on the big raft's broad surface, and against such
power his two oars made poor impression. He laid his weight against
them until he felt the green wood give. He used the little raft as
a kind of anchor to haul the big raft around, but it was a
quarter-hour before the little raft was upstream and the big raft
stood below him, so slanted as to catch the shoreward push of the
river. They were four hundred yards downstream when Burnett brought
it to the beach. He untied the towrope and started along the
water's edge with the small raft. Harris Eby came on and took the
rope from him and hauled the raft upstream. Burnett turned back to
give Provost and John Gay a hand with the big raft, the three of
them slowly pushing it through the back eddy&mdash;John Gay using
the sweep as a pike pole at the stern, Provost holding the raft's
nose off the beach, and Burnett shoving from behind, hip-deep in
the river.</p>

<p>By the time they tied the big raft to the trees near the fire,
the small raft was out in the water again, Harper Howard and
Lorenzo Buck lying flat beside Harris Eby at the oars; men crouched
near the beach watching the little craft rise and fall in the
charging current and Mrs. Howard stood at the fire with her two
sons and looked into the river with her engraved anxiety. Through
the almost horizontal flickering of snow, the second big raft
showed itself in the cascades, ponderously bucking the water,
flinging spray over its gray back. Burnett observed Eby's great
shoulders swaying at the oars and he thought: "I should have warned
him," for there was power enough in Eby to snap those oars.</p>

<p>Wind sharpened the ice-chill of Burnett's clothes; he was
suddenly caught by a long, rough shuddering of muscles. He walked
on to the fire. Katherine poured him coffee.</p>

<p>"How many rafts to come down?"</p>

<p>"Five or six," he said.</p>

<p>"It will be dark before then. When are you crossing your
stock?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow."</p>

<p>"How far is it to Oregon City?"</p>

<p>"Three days," he said.</p>

<p>In the semi-twilight a voice came through the trees&mdash;George
Collingwood's voice&mdash;and Collingwood's wagon came from the
trail, followed by Lattimore's. The wagon stopped and Collingwood
called, "The women have got to get warm," and waited while his wife
climbed from the seat. Edna Lattimore crawled through the other
wagon's rear opening, slipped on the snow and, laughing, recovered
herself.</p>

<p>A short cry came from the river's edge and out of Mrs. Howard's
throat rose a penetrating scream. Thrown around by that wild note,
Burnett saw the little raft flung half aboard the larger one, with
Eby bent far back on the oars and one other man lying flat on the
large raft's edge with his arm seizing vainly at the water. Mrs.
Howard's scream rose again and she and her two boys rushed to the
water's edge. Harris Eby backed away from the big raft and swung
downstream in huge heaving shoulder motions. For one moment, on the
water's surface, Burnett saw an arm rise and a face show its pale
disk through the driving weather; then it disappeared and Mrs.
Howard began to run downstream along the water's edge, her voice
crying back through the brutal wind,
"Harper&mdash;Harper&mdash;Harper, oh, my God, Harper!"</p>

<p>Katherine turned about to follow Mrs. Howard. In a moment she
looked back to Burnett and gave him a glance, and he dropped the
coffee cup and followed her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>THE light of half a dozen lanterns, shining through the
wind-crazed snow, threw a speckled glow into the grave pit. Harris
Eby came from it wet to his knees and stained yellow by the mud,
and Lorenzo Buck crawled down to take his turn with the shovel,
flinging the clay around the foot of the other men standing by. The
shovel gritted steadily against the rocks, the scoops of dirt grew
smaller. Buck called for a pick and tried it on the pit's bottom a
little while and quit. "Pure rock. Four feet's the best we can
do."</p>

<p>"Poor grave for a man," said Collingwood.</p>

<p>Cal Lockyear stood slightly back from the group, so indifferent
that Burnett wondered why he shared this dismal chore. Lockyear
said, "What difference does it make?"</p>

<p>Water crept through the underlying gravel and rose in the pit;
it dripped from Lorenzo Buck's feet when he climbed out. John Gay
moved a finger around the circle, choosing his
men&mdash;Collingwood and Lattimore and Old Daniel
Rinearson&mdash;"You come with me."</p>

<p>As they moved back through the trees toward the Howard wagon,
Billy Lord stepped nearer Lot White. "Now for God's sakes, make the
sermon short."</p>

<p>The Gay fire fifty feet away was a ragged yellow hole in the
curdled black. Burnett turned to it and got a bucket from Gay's
wagon and returned to bail out the grave; water spurted through the
gravel as he bailed.</p>

<p>"Dead man entitled to be warmer than a live man?" said
Lockyear.</p>

<p>"Might make Mrs. Howard feel easier," said Burnett. But the
water continued to flow in as fast as he could take it out, and in
a moment he heard people moving through the trees and he climbed
from the grave and set the bucket aside. Gay and the other three
men came forward, awkwardly stepping with the burden of the dead
Howard between them; they skirted the grave and got on their knees
to lower Howard, he covered by a faded patchwork quilt sewed fast
about him. The rest of the camp walked through the trees to make a
semicircle at the grave's foot. Katherine and Mrs. Irish stood to
either side of Harper Howard's widow; the two Howard boys, edging
forward, stared strangely at the black hole in the ground and Mrs.
Howard looked at the quilt cocoon which was her husband, and put
one hand across her eyes. Lot White moved to the head of the grave,
waiting while the four men tried to place Howard gently into the
pit. They were on their knees, each with one hand supporting
themselves and one hand under Harper; they lowered him to the end
of their reach and still were short of the pit's bottom. John Gay,
uncertainly supported by the slick pile of clay dirt, began to
slide head-forward into the pit and he let go and made a rough grab
at Burnett's legs. The other three released their grasp on the
quilt. Howard fell the last foot into the grave.</p>

<p>Lot White, removing his hat, began at once.</p>

<p>"God sent us to suffer, and we've done so accordin' to the plan,
and God calls us back to a just reward. O you falterin' who doubt,
you men that reason too much and trust too little, you people who
listen to wise fools who tell you this is not so&mdash;I tell you
it's so. I tell you there's a road leadin' to the gate, and the
road is real as the one we traveled from Westport to Independence;
and it's summer on that road, and the birds sing and there's shade
for the weary and water for the thirsty, and there's a gate and a
man at the gate, and inside the gate there's a stairway to the
throne, and you can touch that stairway and you can feel it, and on
the throne there's a body and face and a Voice&mdash;and the Voice
will come upon you, and you'll hear it as plain as you hear me; and
a hand will touch friend Howard and make him easy, and the Voice
will come upon him with the secret of life and of death, which is
one and the same secret, and he will turn to his everlastin' peace,
and wait there for his wife and his children and his friends to
pass through this little misery and come to him again."</p>

<p>Billy Lord bent and murmured to him. Lot White looked upon the
roundabout people, dim-shaped in the flickering lantern light, in
the relentless rush of snows.</p>

<p>"It makes no difference when a man dies, May or December, young
or old. We die, and that's the end of it. This snow came yesterday;
it'll be gone tomorrow, no trace left. We were born yesterday and
tomorrow we're gone, no more trace than the snow. For the grace of
man is not here; it is in heaven&mdash;and to heaven I commit this
man, and I envy him the glory of his life eternal, and I yearn for
the day when that glory shall be mine. O Lord, let his wife
weep&mdash;for the Bible says women shall weep; and then, O Lord,
let her cease to weep, for we've got work to do so long as we're
here. Let her smile again, let her find a man, let her be useful
till her call comes. Let her raise her children, and have more
children; let her make butter and spin and weave, let her tend her
garden and be a neighbor in distress, let her sing the good old
songs with a full heart; and when her call comes, let her lie down
with an eager heart. And we ask no questions, but only pray. Be
with us, God, for there's nothin' else."</p>

<p>John Gay spoke a strong "Amen." Most of the women were crying
but Mrs. Howard, chilled and spent, had no tears left; open-eyed
throughout the sermon, she strained forward to see her husband
lying awash in the shadows at the bottom of the pit and, placing
her arms about her two small boys, she moved away with Katherine
and Mrs. Irish. As soon as the women were gone John Gay took up the
shovel to fill the grave, the first few scoops of dirt splashing in
the water which now covered Harper Howard. He worked fast as though
the sight displeased him, and Burnett presently spelled him, and
later Ben Provost finished the job, rounding the dirt about the
grave.</p>

<p>George Collingwood said: "This is a hell of a thing. The wolves
will be down here tonight. We ought to put some rocks over it."</p>

<p>"Wolves or worms," said Cal Lockyear. "It makes no
difference."</p>

<p>George Collingwood turned about and went into the shadows beyond
the lantern light. He soon returned. "The rocks are too big to
move, or frozen fast."</p>

<p>"No matter," said Lockyear. "You've satisfied your conscience
and that's all you meant to do." He walked away.</p>

<p>The group moved toward John Gay's fire, Collingwood coming
beside Burnett. "Damn the man," he murmured, "can't he be civil?"
Wind crashed through the trees, dredging down the last weak boughs,
and the passing lantern light touched white snow mounds drifted
high against the roundabout boulders. People crowded Gay's fire.
Beyond it, at the water's edge, Gay's wagon sat lashed on the raft,
pitching to the shore breakers; the mooring ropes groaned quietly
against the snubbing trees. Burnett halted beside Edna
Lattimore.</p>

<p>"Bad trip down the river?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;just cold."</p>

<p>George Collingwood walked around the circle with his covert
desire to attract attention. He had an actor's streak in him, and
he made quite a ceremony of cleansing the grave's mud from his
hands. He glanced at his wife, who crouched near Katherine and
soaked in the fire's warmth with her fatigued disinterest; then his
attention darted to Dr. Whitcomb on the other side of the circle,
and fell aside. It was, to the observant Burnett, a sudden
revelation.</p>

<p>"Now," said Collingwood, "we've got two widows, Mrs. Irish and
Mrs. Howard. We've got to do something about helpin' them. They
can't make it down this river alone. We're all neighbors and we'll
see no neighbor suffering distress alone."</p>

<p>"That's taken care of, George," said John Gay. "Joe will ride on
Mrs. Irish's raft, and Lorenzo's going to lash Mrs. Howard's raft
to his."</p>

<p>The fire flushed Collingwood's face and gave to it a round,
well-fed cast. "That's fine. We're all together and we'll stick
together. We're neighbors. We can't let anything happen to each
other."</p>

<p>Lucy Collingwood got up. "I want to go back to the wagon,
George."</p>

<p>He said, "Have you got warm enough?" He buttoned his overcoat
and thrust his hands into his pockets; he seemed in no hurry until
Lucy Collingwood walked into the night without him. He showed a
trace of fretfulness as he followed her.</p>

<p>Burnett turned his hands to the fire and looked about and, in
one of those unexpected moments of perception which change the
world so that it is never quite the same world again, he noted the
abrasion of this trip on the silent people around him. It was to be
seen in the bony droop of John Gay's idle hands, in the recesses of
Mose Crabtree's eye sockets, in Mrs. Millard's drawn-together body;
its small signs were everywhere.</p>

<p>The five months' crossing had taken its levy in faith and in
flesh. Lucy Collingwood's baby was dead. Mrs. Irish and Mrs.
Howard, married women at the trip's beginning, were widows.
Summer's heat had boiled the confidence from the group, and this
wintry weather had sapped their vitality so that they moved with
the carefulness of the very old; and the strength with which they
had started the trip&mdash;the almost insolent confidence they had
in themselves as individuals&mdash;was less than it was; in this
final wringing-out of their endurance, they had an intimation of
what weakness was, and they sat here together with the need of
closeness very real in them, and came upon fraternity.</p>

<p>Burnett's moving glance touched Edna and caught the signal she
had for him, and he joined her and moved through the shouting
night. She stumbled and seized his arm and swayed laughing against
him. The hard-driven snow struck like sand against his face until
the repeated attack became an ache. Through the blackness other
fires bloomed out their orange stains, and the beating of a maul
against metal came forward from some part of the camp with
clocklike strokes. A cow blocked the trail before them, its eyes
shining as separate bits of opal flame. They waded through the
knee-deep drifts and reached the dying coals of Lattimore's
fire.</p>

<p>"Long day," he said. "Awful long day."</p>

<p>"Well, go to bed." Then Edna searched him with her lively eyes
and her smile came on with its suggestions. "And sleep cold." She
waited for him to lift; she laughed at his half-roused expression
and she laid a hand on his arm, closing her fingers about it. But
he was still slow and presently she stepped back with a display of
indifference. "When I first saw you come to the wagon train this
spring I thought, 'There's somebody who could be bold.'" She looked
into the fire, but curiosity brought her glance back to him. "You
ought to know what you see, but sometimes I don't think you
do."</p>

<p>"At this minute a gallon of whisky couldn't make me bold."</p>

<p>"Ah, you're not that old, and it wouldn't take that much whisky
or that much of anything." She turned to the fire. "When you came
out of the mountains after a trapping season what's the first thing
you did?"</p>

<p>"Haircut and something to eat."</p>

<p>"Then what?"</p>

<p>"Then I started to look for another job."</p>

<p>"But before that you hunted up a woman." The polar night rushed
about, the fire flame leaped high. "What did those women talk
about?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't say."</p>

<p>"Why not&mdash;why not?" Her eyes pried at him, her fleshy smile
was warm. "I say things other girls think, but don't say. I trouble
you, don't I?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. You're funny." She stared into the fire. "Boys don't
know anything. You're older, you should know, but women still fool
you." Her hands were square-shaped against the fire's light;
beneath her bulky coat the separate roundnesses of her body were
uneasy; she was aggressive and ready, she was uncertain. Her lips
suggested their adeptness, their experience; they struck restlessly
across her otherwise tranquil face. "I wish you'd talk more. I love
to talk to you. Lately I don't see as much of you, and now you'll
be gone in the morning and we'll not be together for three or four
days."</p>

<p>"See you in Oregon City."</p>

<p>"Then what?"</p>

<p>"Then we'll all look for land."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "you never answer what I want you to answer."
Then she said confidently, "What's wrong with you is something any
girl could fix up quick. You know that, don't you?"</p>

<p>He smiled at her and said, "Good night," and moved away.</p>

<p>She crouched beside the dull coals to catch a last bit of heat
before turning into the wagon, her face meanwhile settling into an
expression of light-humored confidence; and her thoughts claimed
her so fully that the coldness, the furious sounds and the wild
motions of the night seemed to make no impressions upon her; but
after a moment she rose and turned toward the wagon and discovered
Cal Lockyear watching her from the shadows, scarcely fifteen feet
away, and then her light expression gave way to a certain
discontent.</p>

<p>"You been watching me all this time?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "only a moment." He came to the fire and stood
across from her. "You're cold."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," she said.</p>

<p>"Will be if you stay out here."</p>

<p>"No, I won't."</p>

<p>There was more often than not a threatening air about this
man&mdash;a combination of black brows, gray eyes and general
unrest within him; at the moment, however, he seemed to wish to
please her, for he made a brief gesture and permitted himself a
trace of a smile. "Been a bad day. Tired?"</p>

<p>"Things don't bother me."</p>

<p>"Want me to build up that fire for you?"</p>

<p>"Not worth the trouble." She watched him with both wariness and
curiosity, not quite at ease with him, yet not ready to quit him.
All across the plains she had felt the effect of his eyes, though
seldom had she caught him directly watching her; and this interest
had piqued her attention so that her treatment of him was a
deliberate indifference softened by an occasional smile.</p>

<p>"It's a mean country," he said.</p>

<p>"I hear it's better out in the valley."</p>

<p>"Wet," he said. "Sort of stuff that takes the curl out of your
hair and the hell out of your disposition."</p>

<p>She let herself be amused. "Well, that wouldn't hurt you."</p>

<p>"Like a man tied to a rope, like him tame?"</p>

<p>She returned to her indifference. "Be what you please, it's none
of my business."</p>

<p>He flung up his head, deviltry bright in his eyes; he laughed,
he grew sober and stared at her a long interval, half respectful
and half scheming; and suddenly he swung and vanished in the night.
Edna turned to be sure he had gone, and settled again at the fire.
Nov her expression was lively, for the meeting had challenged her,
and she looked a long while into the fire and at last, with
reluctance, she rose and went into the wagon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>RETURNING from Edna's fire, Burnett thought he heard the cry of
a wolf in the beaten night but could not be sure. He stopped by a
group of men laboring Jubal Crowder's wagon aboard its raft and he
lent his shoulder; twenty men heaved at the wagon and it should
have been an easy chore, but their strength was gone as was his,
and his pressure was only the dead pressure of his body, no muscle
behind it, and even this exertion dragged wind from the bottom of
his chest. The wagon settled on the raft and Crowder said in a
reedy tone, "We ought to dismount the wheels tonight." There was no
answer from the others; they leaned against the wagon, crooked
shadows, silent, searching for an energy which wouldn't rise, and
Crowder sensed it and said, "Well, the hell with it. Morning's soon
enough." One by one men wavered through the wind and Burnett went
on to Gay's fire.</p>

<p>The group there had diminished to Katherine, and her father and
Eby, and Lot White dreaming on his haunches, and Ralph Whitcomb.
Katherine rose and poured Burnett a cup of coffee and came around
the fire to rest a hand on his shoulder. Harris Eby, puckering at
his pipe, watched the two a moment and let his eyes fall on the
flame. Katherine returned to her place beside him. She looked at
Eby closely, laughed at him, and bent to rest her shoulder against
him.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow will be bad, going down the river," said John Gay.</p>

<p>Burnett said, "Beyond this line of mountains it should be rain,
not snow."</p>

<p>"Well," said Harris Eby, "we're almost there."</p>

<p>Whitcomb listened to the wind's beat. He shook his head. "In
this gorge a lot of people will go beyond their breaking
point&mdash;never quite be the same people again. Their free land's
going to cost more than they think."</p>

<p>"We'll do what's to be done," said John Gay. "We'll do it and
stand it."</p>

<p>"So you shall. You're a wonderful people for sticking."</p>

<p>"Faith," said Lot. "Faith."</p>

<p>"But we're all running from something," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Now," said John Gay, "you're boring a deeper hole than I can
see down."</p>

<p>"We grew up in the American notion we could start from nothing
and become rich or get elected president. That's our religion, much
as any we've got&mdash;that we could turn a dream into beefsteak
and prosperity and happiness, leave our children more than we had,
and so on. When we got older we saw that it wasn't that sure a
thing. But we couldn't admit the dream was bad, for that would be
saying hope is an illusion. So we saw empty land out here and we've
come here to make a fresh start, hoping that what was wrong back
East won't be wrong here."</p>

<p>Like many a man without schooling, John Gay had contempt for men
whose book knowledge made them foolish; but he also respected words
which seemed to come from some source of wisdom denied him. "I
can't say about that," he said presently. "I'd have to think on it
some better time than this. You don't sound cheerful about our
prospects."</p>

<p>"Same weeds of failure that grew back East will grow here. We
bring the seeds with us. The shiftless and the ignorant will fail,
same as before; the thrifty will get along. There's only one
difference. Some people are going to die earlier because of the
trip."</p>

<p>"As for that," said John Gay, "I'm not in agreement. My
opinion's that our lives are in the book. The thing was set down,
borning and dying, long before we began this trip. You have got a
spirit, I observe, that swings mighty low sometimes."</p>

<p>"I don't bear misery well."</p>

<p>"Bear it as well as the rest of us."</p>

<p>"No," said Whitcomb, "it takes a particular kind of people to
live this close to the mud."</p>

<p>Gay looked at his boots, smiling; and stamped the caked mud from
them. "Well, we're damned deep in it at the moment." He gave out a
sigh and turned to the wagon on the raft, his punished body seeming
to be in motion only at the command of his mind. Whitcomb, hearing
his name called, rose to meet Ben Provost coming in from the rush
of snow and the two talked a moment and then Whitcomb, buttoning
his coat, followed Provost into the night.</p>

<p>Lot White said, "Been hard on that Provost baby." He stared at
the fire, his private thoughts making him restless, and presently
he slapped his hands together and rose to follow the two. He
overtook Whitcomb as the latter reached the Provost wagon. Whitcomb
was on the point of climbing into the wagon. "What are you after?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I'll pray," said Lot.</p>

<p>"Pray out here then," said Whitcomb.</p>

<p>"No, I want to bring the Lord right in there."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You've done your best. It's my turn to call on better
help."</p>

<p>Whitcomb's temper slipped. He backed down from the wheel. "Lot,"
he said, "I won't have you dripping your wet clothes on the child,
or laying your cold hands on her, or raising your voice to scare
hell out of her. Pray right here. If your faith's got any power it
ought to travel ten feet from you into the wagon. I don't want any
more foolishness about it."</p>

<p>Lot White's voice rose. "Provost, it's your baby, not this
man's."</p>

<p>"We better do what Ralph says," murmured Provost.</p>

<p>Lot White shouted his anger upon Whitcomb. "Your learnin' has
taken true healin' from your hands, and someday you'll know it. No
man can believe as little as you believe and live." Saying it, he
turned away and was instantly lost in the night.</p>

<p>Whitcomb remained in the Provost wagon half an hour; when he
came from it he started toward his own wagon, already lashed to its
raft and ready for the morning trip, but within a short distance he
swung aside and beat his way through the night, past McIver's
wagon, past Buck's, past Mrs. Howard's. He paused there and
scratched on the canvas. "It's Whitcomb. Are you all right, Mrs.
Howard?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Irish's voice came back. "She's all right." Then he heard
Mrs. Howard say, "But it's nice you came by."</p>

<p>He circled Billy Lord's, listening to the late scrape of Billy's
fiddle, and he visualized the man sitting wrapped around by his
blankets, sawing at the instrument to soothe his wife asleep beside
him. They were, to the doctor, a strange and wonderful couple.</p>

<p>The Lattimore wagon, when he went by, was dark. Collingwood
stood at the Rinearson fire with Old Daniel and the three boys.
Whitcomb paused here.</p>

<p>"Hell of a time for you to be walkin' around," said Old
Daniel.</p>

<p>Whitcomb spread his hands at the fire. The three boys stood
across the flame, each one with his own particular character and
none of the three characters in any respect alike outwardly. The
oldest, Ared, was a settled close-handed man at twenty-two, a work
horse with no particular imagination. Moss, the middle one, looked
the least like a farmer and it had always struck Whitcomb that this
boy, with an education he would never get, might have been a
professional man. As for Whitley, there was no question of his
parentage; he was Old Daniel thirty years younger&mdash;the same
chesty build, the same push, the same self-centered interest.
Neither was there any question of Whit's wildness&mdash;not only
the wildness of youthful energy running in undisciplined riot, but
also the other wildness which was somehow premeditated and callous.
It was in Whit's large, rolling eyes; it was in the foxy brightness
of his face as he looked toward Whitcomb.</p>

<p>"I should think," said Collingwood, "with other people's
troubles and your own, you'd go to bed."</p>

<p>"Bed's a cold place in weather like this."</p>

<p>It was like Collingwood to be overly solicitous. He always tried
to say the thing which would make him seem wise.</p>

<p>"Well, you're the only doctor we've got and you should keep your
own health. You can't be wearing yourself out on others all the
time." Then he had a thought: "Lucy's not feelin' too well. If
you've got a minute to spare, go see her."</p>

<p>Whitcomb studied the wagons shadowed in the weaving snow and
said, "That one?" He hoped that his manner was casual but felt that
it was a poor try, for Daniel Rinearson watched him with a wise
interest and Whit's eyes had malice in them. At Collingwood's nod,
Whitcomb turned to the wagon, seeing the stain of lantern light
come through the canvas. He rose to the front wheel hub and
scratched on the cover.</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"'Whitcomb."</p>

<p>In a little while Lucy Collingwood called, "All right," and he
pushed aside the heavy blanket draped across the front opening and
crawled inside. All sorts of household equipment lay boxed or
wrapped in this crowded space, piled as high as the canvas would
permit; the bed was between this stuff&mdash;a feather mattress
lying on the wagon boards and made up with piles of quilts. She lay
deep in the mattress, the quilts drawn about her neck. Her hair had
been made down into braids; her eyes were light brown, underscored
by a semicircle of shadowed flesh; her mouth was pale. She hadn't
smiled much since the death of her baby back at Fort Laramie, and
she had lost a great deal of interest, but as he settled himself
uncomfortably between bed and luggage he saw no particular symptoms
of sickness. She was relaxed.</p>

<p>"George thought I ought to drop in."</p>

<p>She said: "I don't know why."</p>

<p>He pressed two fingers against the side of her neck to catch the
beat of her heart; thus bent over her he looked straight into her
eyes and had the illusion of dropping into a deep place. "Warm
enough?"</p>

<p>"As warm as anybody else tonight."</p>

<p>He saw an overcoat lying over a box and he took it and added it
to the pile of quilts and drew it around her neck. A small chunk of
hair, escaped from one of the braids, had flattened itself to her
temple; he resisted the impulse to brush it back with his finger.
He said: "Do you sleep well?"</p>

<p>"I don't seem to need it. Listen." She moved her head toward the
shouldering roughness of the wind against the wagon canvas, to the
cascading rush of it through the trees, to the hundred minor sounds
of things moving and groaning and rattling and snapping around
camp. "It's like the earth has lost control of itself and all the
wind in the world is rushing down on this spot, harder and harder,
till we're blown away."</p>

<p>"Trip's been hard on you."</p>

<p>"I'm not delicate. I only look delicate."</p>

<p>"You don't like this kind of life."</p>

<p>"Did George think there was something particularly wrong with
me?"</p>

<p>"He was being considerate. You've lost a baby and it takes a
little time to come back."</p>

<p>"I'm over that. I couldn't grieve long for a child I never saw.
It's just sad to think of that time and hope going for
nothing."</p>

<p>"There's still time enough. How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-four. That's five years younger than you are, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"It's one of the first things women around camp would find out
about an unmarried man. They wonder why you're not married. They
don't like it."</p>

<p>"None of their business," he said. "Why should they care?"</p>

<p>"It's sort of a general insult. They suspect you. They'd love to
catch you mixed up with some woman."</p>

<p>"They know better. Nobody can keep anything from anybody in a
wagon train, or in a small settlement. We live naked to each other,
no secrecy possible. It will be so all our lives."</p>

<p>"That's the thing I hate most," she said.</p>

<p>He drew back on his knees, taking great care not to touch her.
He had removed his hat and his black, unbarbered hair rolled across
his forehead.</p>

<p>His lids were heavy, swollen by the weather, and two days'
whiskers darkened his complexion. "There's nothing wrong with you,"
he said, "that a healthy shock of some sort wouldn't fix up. Good
night."</p>

<p>When he got to the door blanket she called after him. "You know
what I am, Ralph? I'm somebody a long way from home."</p>

<p>"It will be different when you get settled in a cabin."</p>

<p>"That's not what I meant."</p>

<p>He let himself through the opening and down the wheel of the
wagon, and walked straight into the shadowed shape of Collingwood.
Collingwood said, "I guess it's time to turn in. Is she all
right?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Whitcomb.</p>

<p>Collingwood moved around him and entered the wagon. After a
moment's pause to orient himself in the driving weather, Whitcomb
set off for his own wagon&mdash;at that moment realizing
Collingwood had turned into him from the wagon's side, not from the
direction of the fire. Collingwood had been posted against the
wagon, listening, and as he understood this, Whitcomb's last bit of
sympathy for the man ran out. Then he thought, <i>Am I so easy to
read</i>?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>HALF the morning was gone by the time Burnett got his stock
across the river&mdash;towing them behind the raft&mdash;and it was
noon by the time he had his pack outfit loaded. Thereafter he set
forth upon a trail broken by Indians and Hudson's Bay people and by
the emigrants of the two previous years. The way quartered upward
into the hills, the animals had hard going; night halted him on a
windy little meadow hanging to a promontory a thousand feet above
the river, while to his right&mdash;northward&mdash;the mountains
rolled on with their black tangle of timber.</p>

<p>From this high place, the following morning, he sighted the
scattered rafts in the river below, and he then began a difficult
passage downward through mud and rock and windfalls, the weather
meanwhile changing on this western face of the mountains, the snow
turning to a fat rain driven in by intermittent gusts of southwest
wind. That night he camped in half-drowned lowlands beside the
water, and another morning brought him to the river's narrow plain,
mists rolling over him like thin cloud-banks, and the far shore
receding until he judged the river was a full mile wide. Late that
afternoon he sighted the log palisades of Fort Vancouver sitting
hard by the water; skirting the farmed fields and the outer cabins
of the place, he entered a main gate of this Hudson's Bay
post&mdash;whose factor, John McLoughlin, had ruled a northwest
empire for a quarter-century in the name of the company and the
British.</p>

<p>It was a compound large enough for military drill, with the
shops and houses made of milled lumber built against the inner wall
of the stockade; a larger house stood not quite centered in the
compound, a pole flew the British colors&mdash;the sight of the
flag offending Burnett's acute sense of patriotism&mdash;and a good
many men moved about the parade on various kinds of business. He
was approached by a French-Canadian employee who spoke to him in
bad English and moved away to the big house; within a few minutes a
tall man came from the big house.</p>

<p>He was a physically powerful figure of about sixty now beginning
to show the effects of shrinkage and infirmity; he walked with a
degree of care, but with the air of authority, for there was an
austere benevolence about him&mdash;in the firm mouth, in the
strikingly cold blue eyes, in the direct sizing-up he gave Burnett;
he wore a mane of poorly barbered gray-white hair. "Some of your
people touched here yesterday," he said, "in bad circumstances. I
understand the gorge has been severe and I've sent a bateau up
there with supplies. What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Burnett."</p>

<p>McLoughlin gave him a hand and identified himself. "How was the
trail?"</p>

<p>"Choked in."</p>

<p>"It's an early storm and won't last. You may put your animals in
the pastures east of the wall and you will find quarters with the
bachelors. Mr. Curry..." Mr. Curry came over, was introduced, and
was instructed by the chief factor. "Show him where he may
stay."</p>

<p>"I had thought," said Burnett, "to cross tonight."</p>

<p>"You'll save no time this late in the day," said McLoughlin. "As
soon as you got across you'd find it necessary to camp in the rain.
I shall have the ferry take you over in the morning. It will put
you directly on the trail to Oregon City."</p>

<p>Burnett said: "What's the ferry charge?"</p>

<p>"Could you pay?" asked McLoughlin pointedly.</p>

<p>"I could, but I am a frugal man, and it's a fine point with me
between paying and swimming."</p>

<p>"There's no charge. I should like you to know, Mr. Burnett, that
this is a trading company and you someday may be a customer, either
at this place or at our store in Oregon City, which Mr. Ermatinger
runs. If you could look at our books you'd find a good many of your
people carried on credit. Some of them would have gone hungry if
the credit had not been extended. You will find much animosity
toward the company on the part of certain of your people, rising
out of nationality. It is to be regretted&mdash;but you might find
that those who are most bitter toward us are also the ones who have
not seen fit to repay the obligations incurred of me at a time when
they were much less independent than they are now." He turned away,
and turned back a moment to point toward the feet of Burnett's
horse. "You need a shoeing there. Tell my blacksmith that I have
said for him to do it."</p>

<p>"I am obliged," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"There are only two years of migration before you; so much good
land's left in the valley. Let me caution you: Take care with the
bottoms&mdash;for in winter some of them are very wet. If you must
settle there, make your place by the Willamette, which is the only
sure road you'll have for many years. My people, when they have
served their time with the company, go down there to make farms.
You'll find forty or fifty families twenty miles above the fall at
Champoeg...If the river's not to your liking, then find a claim on
the first break of the prairie near Bear Creek. The land's not
quite so good, but you can build roads there."</p>

<p>He moved off with the abruptness of one not accustomed to
terminal pleasantries. Burnett had been prepared to dislike him,
for McLoughlin had been a British king out here until the American
immigration of the previous two years had challenged and set aside
his authority; but, watching him go, Burnett found himself
impressed by a crusty courtesy which had imbedded in it a very real
sense of fairness. He turned off with Curry to the bachelor
quarters; he was introduced to the clerks at suppertime, and found
his bed. In another gray and rainy morning the fort ferry crossed
him with his outfit to the brushy south shore of the river.</p>

<p>The trail was clear, since it was a main thoroughfare between
the fort and Oregon City, twenty-five miles to the south. Before
the existence of that new town, the trail had been the
well-traveled route of the company's brigades trapping as far down
as the Sacramento Valley. A few miles of willow-tangled swampland
ended at higher ground as he passed into the dark fir timber which
covered this country wherever he looked; he saw the Willamette
nearby&mdash;the river which, beginning a hundred miles or more
southward, washed through the heart valley of this Oregon country
and at last dumped itself into the Columbia not far from the Fort.
There had been recent travel on the trail, and somewhere beyond
noon of an increasingly gloomy day he discovered a figure on a
horse waiting ahead of him.</p>

<p>He was a redhead, a lathe-shaped young man dressed in dirty
buckskins, moccasins and trapper's hat. Wind and rain humped him on
the saddle. Across the horn he carried a rifle, both hands resting
upon it. As Burnett came up, the man gave him a searching
inspection, friendliness waiting on certainty.</p>

<p>He said, "Oregon City?" and when Burnett nodded, the redhead
fell in beside him, riding with his knees drawn up on short
stirrups. "My name's Bob Hawn. Been here six years and saw the
first of you people come."</p>

<p>"Burnett&mdash;Rice Burnett."</p>

<p>"I see the fringe of your buckskin coat. You been trappin'?"</p>

<p>"Three seasons on the Missouri headwaters."</p>

<p>"Know it well." He pointed to his moccasins. "Blackfoot woman
made those. Who made your coat?"</p>

<p>"A Crow squaw."</p>

<p>"Your squaw?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Hawn fell silent for as much as a hundred yards, then said,
"I've got a squaw," and searched Burnett's face for a reaction.
"Not a Blackfoot squaw, though. She's Calapooia&mdash;one of the
tribes down the valley. I've got a claim that direction. Here to
settle?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Come down and I'll show you a good place. In '43 and '44 your
first people went out in the Tualatin&mdash;that's good, but the
best's taken there. Some of 'em have squatted around Oregon City.
Few went on farther. Not half a dozen around me. It's all open.
What's news East?"</p>

<p>"Beaver's no good now."</p>

<p>"Well, she was fine while she lasted," said Hawn. "At the
time&mdash;shiverin' like a dog, wet all day, cold all night,
listenin' all the time for Indians&mdash;it seemed like a hell of a
thing. Now it remembers good. First years out here were the same:
the squaw and me and a pretty fine life. Now you people are
crowdin' in and things have changed. I don't know&mdash;I don't
know..."</p>

<p>They stopped at noon, Hawn making up a little fire to boil tea
and fry a chunk of smoked fish which he produced from his possible
sack. The timber grew thicker, giant trunks running upward in a
manner to astonish Burnett, their tops making a canopy so high
overhead that the wind seemed at great distance; and a kind of odd
quietness lay all around. In late afternoon they reached a small
river near its junction with the Willamette, crossed on a gravel
ford and came upon an open piece of land at the edge of Oregon
City, the new buildings of this town making two or three short rows
between a high bluff and the river. Directly beyond town, a wall of
black rock rose in the shape of a semicircular dam across the
river, over which the current broke in steam spray and fell
thunderously to its new level. The wagons of the train&mdash;such
as had arrived&mdash;were parked in the clearing, fires were
burning, and people wandered idly around from town to camp and from
fire to fire.</p>

<p>Burnett turned to a space between the Lattimore and Gay wagons
and chose the shelter of a cedar tree for himself. Hawn, folding
himself comfortably over on his saddle, lingered to talk and to
rummage the camp with his inquisitive glances which stopped nowhere
long.</p>

<p>He said, "Don't stay around this place. There's nothin'." He
ceased to talk and Burnett, looking about, saw the man's eyes
pinned to Katherine Gay moving forward from her fire.</p>

<p>Katherine smiled at Hawn but he, making the briefest nod, said
to Burnett "I'll be around town tonight if you want to talk about
settlin'," and moved away.</p>

<p>"It's an awfully small place to be called a town," said
Katherine.</p>

<p>"Except Fort Vancouver, it's the only town we've got," said
Burnett. "Two stores here."</p>

<p>"We won't need them much," said Katherine. "There's not money
enough in this camp to buy a whetstone." She looked through the
scattered crowd and her attention rested a short time on a small,
round and painfully plain girl who stood alone at a fire with a
blanket wrapped about her shoulders. "Poor Roxy. The Kitchens have
nothing, and I know they're out of food."</p>

<p>"So are a lot of others." He drove his ax deep into a fallen log
and dragged it near the tree to make a backstop for his fire; he
knocked down the overhanging cedar limbs and, with a few pitch
shavings from his pack, made a quick blaze and dragged a pack
forward to supply a seat. "Come out of the rain."</p>

<p>"The natives say not to think about it, for it'll rain all
winter." She settled on the pack and laid her hands together and
stared into the uncertain twining of the flames. She was graver
than he had seen her. "How will they get along?"</p>

<p>"It's not your nature to worry," he said.</p>

<p>"You don't know much about my nature. But&mdash;land to find
cabins to build, and getting something in the ground, and fences,
and everything to do and so little to do it with! And waiting for
harvest on an empty stomach...everything&mdash;just everything. How
will the Kitchens make it, or Mrs. Howard, or Mrs. Irish with only
poor little Watt who's half sick with working too much now?" She
sat still, permitting these things to trouble her. He said nothing;
he fed the fire and walked away to split a log and to bring in its
sections.</p>

<p>"You're no help," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll save my help for those that require it. You don't need
any."</p>

<p>She was smiling, she was a little bit wistful. "Thought I
did."</p>

<p>"All right," he said, and crouched beside her, "we'll grieve
together."</p>

<p>"Don't make fun of me."</p>

<p>"I guess," he said, "it's time for the big drunk."</p>

<p>"You've had a few, too."</p>

<p>"Had some. Missed some I ought to've had."</p>

<p>"Well, there's no doubt a saloon in this town."</p>

<p>"What would I be doing, drunk alone?"</p>

<p>She reached for a stick to poke at the fire's heart. "We'll be
settling in all sorts of places. Where will you go?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. It'll take some talk and a lot of questions."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, here's where the train breaks up. I don't like it. I
don't like things to change. Wish we'd all settle the same
place."</p>

<p>"Four hundred people thrown together for six months is pretty
close business. We're a lodge&mdash;a very particular lodge."</p>

<p>She said: "I don't really make out why you came."</p>

<p>"I'm the sort of man that always thinks there's something beyond
the next mountain. I've sure crossed a lot of mountains to find out
there's nothing on the far side that wasn't on the near one. In
fact, I've run out of mountains. That's why I came here. I'm thirty
and it's high time I settled."</p>

<p>"You sure?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "I expect the wind's going to blow some mighty
nice smells at me smells of things over there, not here.
Tomorrow&mdash;not today. You know&mdash;what we've not got but
what we might get. Same old thing: over the next hill...I expect my
feet will itch." He made a flat motion with his two hands against
the ground. "But I'm on the blanket."</p>

<p>"What's that mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It's what an Indian says when he's through fighting, running
around, raising hell."</p>

<p>She watched him. "You sure?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>She made half a turn and laid her hand flat over his chest, over
his heart.</p>

<p>"There's your mountain you're all the time crossing." She rose
and turned her attention to Roxy at the nearby fire, and her light
manner was overshadowed by thoughtfulness. "They have got to be
helped," she said. "You think about that. And Mrs. Irish&mdash;you
think about how she can be helped."</p>

<p>"Why me?"</p>

<p>"Because," she said&mdash;"Because you should. Because I said
so." She gave him a moment's austere attention; then the sudden
smiling arrived. "I think I'll go look at a store&mdash;not to buy
anything&mdash;just to enjoy looking." She went away.</p>

<p>It was then midafternoon with a light and lazy rain falling from
low clouds. Burnett pulled a canvas over his packs and took his ax
to walk through the scattered trees for fuel, meanwhile noting the
letdown air of people standing at their fires or aimlessly
traveling from one place to another. The long trip was done, yet it
was not done; they were neither in motion nor settled; and
indecision was plainly on them, as though they were waiting for
their energy to renew itself. He heard Gay's voice call to him and
he went to Gay's fire and joined a dozen men gathered there.</p>

<p>Some of the townspeople had come along to offer their advice.
Gay turned to Burnett.</p>

<p>"This man"&mdash;pointing to one of the townsmen&mdash;"said
it's not been settled much on the other side of the river, thirty
miles down."</p>

<p>"What about the Tualatin Prairie?"</p>

<p>"Best is taken," said the townsman. "And it's low. From now till
May you can row a boat from one swale to another."</p>

<p>"I saw a man this morning," said Burnett, "who spoke of the
country off French Prairie."</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Hawn."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the townsman, "the squaw man. He's back of where the
Howells settled, first rise off the prairie. That country rolls.
Some buttes and some ridges. Timber patches and meadows between.
The meadows are fine. Indians used to burn 'em every year to keep
the underbrush clear for huntin'. Good game country&mdash;you're
just elbow-close to the mountains. Bear Creek and a valley. Plenty
of water."</p>

<p>"By God," said Rinearson, passing a hand through the sifting
rain, "you don't have to tell us that."</p>

<p>"You'll get accustomed to it," said the townsman carelessly.
"First year's the worst. The wetness around here is the saturatin'
kind. When you get close to a stove you'll stand around in your own
private cloud of steam. You won't get entirely dry until spring and
you may get to feelin' like a book with the glue about ready to let
go. Your cabins won't be tight and even if they were the dampness
would get through. Your bedclothes will always be sort of clammy
and your iron will rust, so keep your guns oiled." He was enjoying
himself; he smiled at the growing and attentive audience.</p>

<p>"How many rivers we got to cross to get to that place?" asked
Billy Lord.</p>

<p>The townsman shut his eyes a moment. "Molally and the Pudding
not big. And some creeks. Your first business, after cabins, is to
break land enough to get your wheat in. You'll have a hell of a
time turnin' over the sod. Then you got to split out rails for when
your crops start comin' on. The deer will eat you lean if they
ain't fenced out."</p>

<p>Ben Provost said: "Can't break land or seed in this
weather."</p>

<p>"No, you wait for a spell of sun."</p>

<p>"Suppose it don't come?"</p>

<p>"Then you plow and seed anyhow," said the townsman. "You got to
eat next year, don't you?" He was smiling again.</p>

<p>"Well," said John Gay, "to be honest about it, I'm troubled
about eating <i>this</i> year."</p>

<p>"So say we all," murmured Lot Whitc.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can borrow a little wheat from them that's been here a
year or two. You can boil it, you can parch it, you can fry it.
However you fix the stuff, you'll get awful tired of it. There's
fish&mdash;and there's venison. The deer are meager little
creatures towards spring and you'll get sick of 'em...You'll make
out. Don't know how, but you will. It's astonishin' how people
manage to live when it don't look reasonable. Now I'll give you a
tip. Look at my clothes."</p>

<p>He had seemed to Burnett to be a comfortably dressed man until
he drew attention to himself. He let his shirt cuffs come to view,
ragged as French lace; he pointed to the patching in his broadcloth
suit and, turning about, he drew aside the coat skirt to display a
trouser's seat of some foreign gray material sewed over the
original blue cloth. He had a fine set of whiskers which came well
down to his chest but when he lifted the whiskers he presented for
their inspection a hole in the shirt as large as an apple. His
shoes had scarcely any soles. "You see how it is. We've got food,
but our clothes are worn out and there's nothing in that line to
buy here yet. You've got no food but you've got a lot of clothes.
The answer is, swap." Then, the cheerful smile showing again, he
said: "If there's a spare shirt in this crowd of you my size, I'll
give ten bushel of wheat for it."</p>

<p>Lorenzo Buck, standing in the foremost rank of the large circle,
made a gesture to himself as though remembering something and
turned away. Burnett saw him cross the camp to Mrs. Howard's wagon.
Meanwhile Rinearson had another question for the townsman. "Next
year, where do we sell our wheat and cattle?"</p>

<p>"Sell?" said the townsman, and seemed surprised. "Why bless you,
brother, there's no market for anything. Hudson's Bay will buy your
wheat at some sort of a price, but you'll have to wait till the
country grows before you think about makin' any money. There's no
money here. We don't use money. We use script, or orders on the
stores, or we swap." He saw the disappointment on some of their
faces and he went quickly on. "What would you make money from?
Land? There's too much of it. Cattle? You can swap good stock
around among yourselves, but the country's full of wild Spanish
cattle brought up here years back, and roamin' now like deer. You
want to watch out when you meet 'em too. No, there's no chance yet
to make a fortune, but that's not what you need anyhow. What you
want is to settle, make a place, fill your root cellars and your
wheat bins, and get your orchards goin' and build roads and set up
schools. You'll live like kings, for this is the finest country on
earth, spring and summer and fall. What do you want to be rich for?
Why bring that maggot out here, gentlemen, to make life wormy? Let
your earth yield and let your cream pantry be full, and rest on
your porch and rock in your chair. My God, men, have you got to buy
and sell things to be happy?"</p>

<p>The audience viewed him skeptically and John Gay expressed the
crowd's reaction by a pointed question. "Well, friend, wouldn't you
like to be rich enough to buy a new shirt?"</p>

<p>"That," said the man, "is only to please the morals of my
neighbors. I'd do as well with a blanket as a shirt."</p>

<p>Ryal McIver said bluntly: "What in hell do you do for a
living?"</p>

<p>"My name's Sydney Moss and I run the hotel yonder&mdash;the one
with its petticoats hoisted above the river."</p>

<p>"And do you run it for love or for money?" asked Ryal.</p>

<p>"I can tell you something about that," said Sydney Moss. "If
every man who ate at my table had paid for his meal, I'd be rich
and the country would be broke. Gentlemen, I shall not make a
commercial announcement. I shall only say that if you wish to use
the facilities of a hotel while in this city, you will have to use
mine&mdash;for it's the only hotel we've got." With that
good-humored advertisement, he tipped his hat to the crowd and
sauntered toward town.</p>

<p>John Gay said, "Just where did the gentleman stand in the matter
of money?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Rinearson, "he likes it but ain't makin'
any."</p>

<p>"Same as the ten commandments," said Gay. "They're fine things
when there's no sin to confuse the situation...I still have got no
notion where to look for land."</p>

<p>"The country Hawn spoke of sounds likely," said Billy Lord.</p>

<p>John Gay squatted and scooped his big farmer's hand across the
spongy soil before him. "Rolling country," he said. "Well, that's
not apt to be deep loam and what's the point of moving two thousand
miles for second-grade stuff? That Tualatin Prairie interests
me."</p>

<p>"You'll recall he said it was rowboat country in the winter,"
pointed out Ryal McIver. "It could be swamp-sour, and maybe
wouldn't dry fit for plowin' till late in spring, and might bake
during summer."</p>

<p>"It will bear more talking about," said Burnett, and moved
toward town. He noticed Lorenzo Buck and Mrs. Howard in close
conversation. Lorenzo was a short man, his head level with the
woman's; he had removed his hat and the slow rain plastered his
hair to his skull.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Mrs. Howard said: "I can't be leaning on you all the time. You have
got your own work&mdash;and it looks to me like one man's work out
here is from daylight till way after dark."</p>

<p>"Then what will you do?" asked Lorenzo Buck.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Something. I've got to do something." Her
complexion was of the dark Missouri kind, her eyes gray and
unlighted. There was on her face the visible remnant of what once
must have been a high-strung temper and a love of gaiety; but at
thirty-five these things had been quenched. Her body was thin, her
mouth pressed at the corners; facing Buck she seemed on guard
against an undue generosity from him and yet perhaps was hopeful of
it, for she was in the cruel position of a woman who, having
nothing left but pride, knew that pride was too expensive for her.
"I think I can stand anything. I've told myself that more than
once. But I need time to meet these things. It's not decent the
world should change so fast and make me change with scarce three
days to put away the things I've lived with fifteen years."</p>

<p>He was sympathetic, but insistent. "Maybe time, next month or
next year...There's none now. The help that's here will be gone
tomorrow. Have you got any notions?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "except maybe to sell the oxen and the wagon and
look for something to do around this place."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to do. You can't go back and you've got no
relatives in the party. There some other family you can throw in
with&mdash;live with for a while?"</p>

<p>She answered quickly, "I'd never live under another woman's
shoes."</p>

<p>Buck swung his stocky shape to look beyond her. Rain ran down
his hair and across his face. He made a gesture of dashing it away.
"Well," he said, "it amounts to this, don't it? You have got two
young boys and no husband, and I have got a girl and a boy, and no
wife. Coming down the river it occurred to me it would be a good
thing if we joined the families."</p>

<p>She said nothing. He continued to look beyond her, his
expression fixed somewhere between kindness and embarrassment and
he shifted his feet and, hearing nothing from her, gave her a
direct glance. "Wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"I expect it would," she said.</p>

<p>"It had better be done today," he said.</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"I'll speak to Lot White." Buck let his glance fall to the
ground and stood in long thought, and raised his eyes to her. She
made a small motion with her shoulders and he continued to watch
her for a moment, and then turned away.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>EDNA walked through the first town she had seen since leaving
Missouri six months before. There were perhaps forty raw-boarded
houses scattered along a street which dipped and rose to the
contour of the land and had no particular order. Here and there
some enterprising soul had built a fence and at intervals a section
of boardwalk made walking passable; otherwise the street was two
dirt footpaths bordering a lane churned to loose mud by wagons and
rain. She passed a church, a hotel, a blacksmith shop and a
coopering place; she paused at a store's doorway to catch the odor
of goods which came from it; she saw a second store, Ermatinger's,
across the way.</p>

<p>Other people from the wagon train cruised through this town,
something like idle visitors on a holiday. She saw Moss Rinearson
and looked at him until his attention came around; and she smiled
at him and went on. At the farther end of town was a big warehouse
and farther on some sort of mill; out in the river the falls were a
great horseshoe of ragged water overhung by mist.</p>

<p>She paused, half an eye on the water, half an eye on the street.
George Collingwood detached himself from a group of men and moved
toward one of the stores; he saw her, hesitated a moment, and went
into the store.</p>

<p>Retracing her way, she noticed one of the Crabtree boys staring
at her. She had no particular interest in Sam Crabtree, yet his
attention was the golden coin of a man's interest and she gave him
a full answering smile.</p>

<p>Katherine and Harris Eby stood by the Ermatinger store and for a
short time, drawn by the only thing that really interested
her&mdash;the personal relationship between a man and a
woman&mdash;she looked toward them with her warm and suspicious
thoughts. Two Indian women sat on the doorstep of a house as though
it were a public bench&mdash;one very old woman and one very young,
the latter holding a baby across her lap. Edna stopped and her
smile quickly came as she looked down at the baby's round, dark and
dirty face. She laid a finger on the baby's button mouth and softly
stirred it; she made small bubbling sounds with her own mouth.</p>

<p>Ralph Whitcomb's voice came from behind. "What's original about
a baby, Edna?"</p>

<p>She drew back. "It's like a doll."</p>

<p>"Rag doll," said the doctor. The Indian mother's eyes clung to
him, smileless and without motion, and the doctor suddenly said,
"Do you speak English?"&mdash;and seemed relieved when she appeared
not to recognize the question. "I guess she doesn't. It's just a
baby, and it'll grow up half tame and half wild with no world of
its own. That always happens when white people move in."</p>

<p>She said, "I hear Indian mothers don't have much trouble."</p>

<p>"No more than animals, usually."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't speak of her as an animal," said Edna.</p>

<p>"She's younger than you are, but she's already showing age. She
was pretty. She isn't now. Smoke and dirt and gluttony and
starvation have done it."</p>

<p>"We all get old soon enough," said Edna. "In ten years I'll be
fat and ugly." Her broad mouth refused to be serious. "But I'm not
troubled about that. The only thing that would trouble me is to
think I'd never get married."</p>

<p>"You've got no worry there," said Whitcomb.</p>

<p>She lifted shoulders and head, appreciating the compliment. At
such a time it seemed to Whitcomb she had been spoiled by
experience. She liked men and was alert in their presence; yet
there was nothing sly about her. Her actions were impulsive rather
than deliberate, so far as he had noticed them, and though other
and more self-contained women looked at her with reserve it
occurred to Whitcomb that nature had put into her a more than
sufficient capacity and that she was at its mercy. She reached out
to absorb the sensations of life with a spongelike readiness. She
accepted the coarseness of her surroundings and shrank ladylike
from nothing. She was the exact opposite, he suddenly thought, of
Lucy Collingwood.</p>

<p>"Your people decided where to go?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Dad's not said." Her eyes turned to him with speculation.
"Where'll you go?"</p>

<p>"I'm staying here. I've found a house."</p>

<p>"Then we'll have no doctor."</p>

<p>"Yes, you will. I'll ride the circuit. I'll see you all."</p>

<p>"We'll miss you."</p>

<p>"So shall I."</p>

<p>"So you will." Her glance seemed to penetrate the layers he
built up against the world and to come directly upon the desires he
sheltered; it was an illusion of course, created by the half smile
of her lips and the largeness of her eyes. "You'll miss some people
more than others," she said.</p>

<p>"Don't you judge people too soon."</p>

<p>"Why, I don't judge people at all." Her smile lessened. "And I
wish they'd not judge me. I don't ask them to. I don't ask
anything. They like me, or they don't. If they don't like me, they
can let me alone."</p>

<p>"It would be pretty hard to let you alone."</p>

<p>The compliment brought her good humor back and she walked on
with her head lifted to the little sights about her. As she passed
Abernethy's store she looked in to see Collingwood, and a hundred
feet beyond she turned her head and found him coming behind.</p>

<p>She went by the straggling houses and made a turn into a side
pathway which carried her by the back buildings of town and
indirectly toward the wagon camp. She walked without haste and she
was abreast a lean-to shed half-filled with hay when Collingwood's
voice reached forward to halt her.</p>

<p>He had been traveling rapidly and he was excited; he took her
arm, cast a quick glance about, and drew her into the shed. He put
both hands on her arms and he searched her face with his rising
boldness.</p>

<p>"Why'd you come this way?"</p>

<p>She gave him an easy smile; she said nothing.</p>

<p>"You knew I was behind you," he said. "You knew I'd follow." He
was sure, yet not sure enough; he tugged gently at her arms,
waiting for her to come in, to give him some signal. Her body
furnished him with no clue; it was neutral, responding as he
pulled, stopping when he ceased. The half-smiling of her face told
him nothing, but by then her closeness worked him loose from his
hesitancy and he flung his arms around her, thrust himself hard
against her and bore down with his mouth. She let him have his way
for a moment and then, as though the moment were enough to settle
her curiosity, she gave him a short push.</p>

<p>He was roused and his breath sawed heavily against the quietness
of the shed; his nostrils were flared out, his eyes half closed.
The rebuff stung him. "If you didn't want this," he said, "why'd
you let me start?"</p>

<p>"Do what you please," she said indifferently.</p>

<p>"You didn't stop me," he said. "You let me go on. You want me to
think you're too nice, or you want me to just run hell out of
myself trying to get you?"</p>

<p>"Make up your own mind," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a renewed excitement, and stepped toward
her.</p>

<p>"No," she said curtly, "that's enough."</p>

<p>"My God, Edna, don't you know anything? You can't encourage a
man, then slap him in the face."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and was clearly disinterested.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "What was it&mdash;what'd you want?"</p>

<p>She shook her head and her chin moved forward, lending to her
face a heavy and stubborn cast.</p>

<p>"I want to know," he insisted.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said impatiently, "I'm tired listening to you." She
turned from the shed and left her order behind her. "You go the
other way don't follow me. And don't bother me any more."</p>

<p>"Damn cheap fun you had, wasn't it?" he said.</p>

<p>She kept on with the trail, passing into a light stand of timber
which lay between town and camp, and as she walked she soon lost
her air of resentment and began to smile at the memory of the
foolish expression on Collingwood's face; and in this humor she
turned a bend of the trail and found Cal Lockyear working with his
ax on a thin tree which he had dropped across the trail; he was
apparently hewing a plank from it. There was a complete
preoccupation about him and Edna stood at the barrier created by
the tree for a full minute before his eyes rose from his chore. As
soon as he saw her he moved forward to chop aside the upthrust
branches of the tree, and when he gave her a hand across the log
his glance fell upon her with a moment of weight and afterwards he
turned back to his chore.</p>

<p>It was curiosity which made her stand there to watch him. She
was never kind to men who ran after her too hard; she was never
very kind to men who ignored her, and Lockyear had mostly watched
her from a distance. Sometimes she thought she saw in his eyes a
certain malice or a certain belief concerning her, and that made
her think he was rude. But still she knew her attractiveness and
she knew he had his share of man's lustiness; therefore she was
curious and observed him now with an attention which had a certain
wariness in it.</p>

<p>"What's that you're making?"</p>

<p>"Plank for Daniel Rinearson's wagon," he said.</p>

<p>"Daniel's got three sons to do that kind of work for him."</p>

<p>He leaned back from his labors and showed her his rough
amusement. "Daniel's got two sons out hunting cows, and one son too
damned lazy to come in from the rain."</p>

<p>"Funny, though," she said. "You're not much of a man to do
anybody favors."</p>

<p>"Pleases me to work, right now. Tomorrow it might please me not
to. Always do what I please."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Just sometimes we do what we please. Most
of the time we do what's got to be done."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I don't do a damned thing I don't want to
do."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "don't talk nonsense to me. If you want to make
men think you're a big one, go ahead. But don't tell me that. It's
silly."</p>

<p>"You do what you want to do, I notice. With men."</p>

<p>She grew cool toward him, she shrugged her shoulders. "Let them
mind their affairs&mdash;and I'll mind mine."</p>

<p>He stared at her with his bright and driving interest. "You want
'em to do that?" He sat straddled on the log, hands folded one on
the other, but this attitude of rest produced no actual air of
rest. The black brows made a straight strike across his face, the
ash-gray eyes were intent, the long body had its innumerable
suggestions of restlessness about it. As he studied her his
expression shifted until some of the pointedness was gone and he
seemed to find things within her which commanded his attention;
when this more reasonable manner came to him, Edna let him see the
more friendly side of her&mdash;let him see it for a discreet
moment, and then went on through the woods to the camp. His ax
remained silent and by this she knew he watched her; and she smiled
to herself at the knowledge she had broken through his
indifference. It was only a game he had played; and she got the
notion she could beat him at it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>BUCK and Mrs. Howard faced Lot White; and beside them Lige
Ebbett, who was thirty-five, stood with sixteen-year-old Lavina
Baker; for it was to be a double wedding, both marriages fruited
from poverty and necessity, from the pressure of labor which could
not be borne alone, from a young girl's doll dreams, from the
public insistence that in a new country women were too valuable to
remain single after childhood. Ebbett had crossed the plains as a
driver for another man. He owned nothing but a few personal
belongings and he had no trade and no future except that which
strong muscles and an illiterate mind could make for him.</p>

<p>All stood bareheaded in the silver-glittering slow rain, wagon
people and townsmen making a half ring around the principals of the
affair; none of them had changed clothes, their better clothes
being no more presentable than their poorer ones, and the thinly
dressed Lavinia Baker shivered as she waited and looked up to the
much taller Ebbett with a sweet smile of expectation. Lot White had
made a brief thing of it and now waited while the two men placed
the rings. The ring which Buck used on Mrs. Howard's finger was
Martha Gay's, lent for the occasion, Mrs. Gay not able to endure
the thought of the woman wearing either the ring of her first
husband or of Buck's first wife. While he waited, Lot White closed
his eyes and tilted his face skyward and thus mustered his sermon.
To him three or more people gathered together made a congregation,
and a congregation was to be preached at; for the devil was real to
Lot and the devil was always close by and the need to wrestle with
the devil was strong in Lot's soul. The roar of the falls came as a
slow drum roll through the light wash of wind in the trees, and
rain mist began to crowd the earth and pack itself like cotton
between the firs; campfires burned orange in the gathering twilight
but the wetness of the world worked its clammy way through
everybody.</p>

<p>Lot White opened his eyes and made a silent blessing upon the
couples with his blacksmith's fist. "Rain or sun, mud or carpets,
it makes no difference, for it's the Lord's will and so let it be.
Maybe it's better that we should join in the mud, and in full
presence of these elements. Who knows but that this ceremony is a
warnin' to the disbelievers? Take warnin'. The devil's on these
grounds at this moment. He walks among you in some shape or other.
He's in your wagons, he's got the power to creep into your heads
and he can take your tongue and make you speak words that will
unsettle the people you speak to, and he can crawl into a pretty
vase and make you buy it when you ought to be buyin' sugar or
flour. I know it, for I can smell him when he's near&mdash;and he's
near enough to me now to touch." He made a positive cut through the
air with one hand and looked directly upon the newly wedded.</p>

<p>"Women, be obedient, for that's the way of it. Be fruitful, for
how else can we populate this empty land? Dress plain, speak
gentle, and be thrifty if you expect your husbands to get ahead; a
careless wife can kill a man and put her children on charity. Don't
gossip&mdash;it was the fault of Eve and you've got it handed down
to you aplenty. There's work to do and work won't ever end till we
end. Well, do it and don't complain, and don't sigh for pretty
hands and a smooth face, for that will be the devil whisperin'.
Men, be patient, and forbear, and let your commands be just; and
bend your backs like the willin' horse six days the week; for
you're sinners and you were meant to pay, and if you come to bed at
night weary enough to cry, don't be sorry for it&mdash;that's the
Lord's intention. God, come bless these people. God, lay your hands
upon them. Amen."</p>

<p>The crowd moved around to congratulate the wedded ones but Mrs.
Millard, listening to Lot White's final injunctions, turned to her
husband in anger. "That fool with his man's advice&mdash;that
conceited man&mdash;that lump of bigotry. Telling women to be
obedient, like slaves, like animals. Lick your master's hand and
take his blows and cringe. Oh, Millard, when's this world going to
be just, to women?"</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know," he said patiently. He looked around him
with his uneasy glance, for his wife's voice carried far. He saw
the smile on Ralph Whitcomb's face, but that was the only smile.
His neighbors found such talk unamusing and the men of the train
had long since, by indirection or by blunt statement, questioned
his manhood in permitting his wife to speak as she did. He was over
six feet, spare and ruddy, a kind of bland good will shining below
heavy eyebrows. He had a John Bull face, a great nose with its
prominent bridge, lean cheeks and a forceful mouth and chin. His
wife was a full foot shorter, strong-featured, positive in opinions
and ordinarily kind; but when this one topic rose a sense of
injustice so inflamed her that she could not be still; on such
occasions Millard's expression was one of pained benevolence.</p>

<p>"I hate to hear him talk," she said. "Poor Mrs.
Howard&mdash;every stitch she owns belongs to Buck now. The law
says so. He can beat her, he can strip her of her last petticoat,
but she can do nothing about it. Just because men say so."</p>

<p>"I know," said Millard. "Now let's think of supper."</p>

<p>But she was at the peak of her indignation and Lot White, coming
by, was within her reach. She stepped before him and laid her
forefinger as a pistol between his eyes. "You little puffed-up
fool," she said, "go back and do your wife's work for a day and
you'll not have so much wind left in you to lay down the law to
women."</p>

<p>Lot White took a step backward, caught off guard yet not too
surprised. He raked her with his displeased glance, but having
argued with her before, he wanted no renewed argument and he said
mildly, "Now, sister, it will do you no good to pester me," and
escaped into the crowd.</p>

<p>Relieved of her indignation, Mrs. Millard said cheerfully to
Lucy Collingwood, "You look better. Well, Millard, come and we'll
eat." She moved away with the air of victory about her.</p>

<p>During the ceremony Rice Burnett had stood beside Katherine and
Harris Eby, and afterwards he walked with them over the field
toward his fire.</p>

<p>Katherine said: "If it could only have been a brighter day!"
Burnett noticed tears standing in her eyes.</p>

<p>Eby said, comfortably, "It's funny but weddings always make
women cry," and laughed at her as he moved away to his own quarter
of the camp ground. She went on with Burnett, head lowered and her
face half hidden from him.</p>

<p>"Don't be troubled about it," said Burnett. "Lorenzo's a good
man. It's not a bad match for Mrs. Howard."</p>

<p>"It's poor little Lavinia...Ebbett's just twice her age."</p>

<p>"Not uncommon."</p>

<p>"He's shiftless and he won't care about her. They'll never have
a thing except ten children; and he'll sit in the yard, or go
hunting, and every bit of the trouble and the scraping will be on
her shoulders. Such thin little shoulders. They're not strong
enough for it. She'll be dead before she's thirty. I'm downright
sad. It's such a long time since I've seen anybody not being
punished by something&mdash;rain or dust, or heat or cold, or
hunger, or something. I won't let it be that way with Lavinia. I
just won't. You've got to help me make that man work."</p>

<p>They were on the blind side of the Gay wagon, between trees and
canvas, and twilight came fast down. He moved her around to catch
sight of her face. "All right," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't say that just to make me feel better," she said. "I mean
it. I won't stand to have it so hard for Lavinia. She's been
cheated out of girlhood&mdash;and that's enough. She's got a right
to some good luck." She rested, silent a moment; she made a sound
of discontent in her throat and said firmly, "And she shall have
it. Just you remember, Rice, you promised to help."</p>

<p>"All right," he said.</p>

<p>She took hold of his arm and laughed at him. "Meek&mdash;meek.
You sound like Harris when I boss him. He never minds it. You
would&mdash; <i>you'd</i> mind it."</p>

<p>"When you marrying him?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, giving a careless answer, "I don't know...Your
clothes are wet. You ought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Soon as he's got a cabin ready?"</p>

<p>"You ought to get good and dried out...I don't know,
Rice&mdash;I don't know. What're you so curious for?"</p>

<p>"Wish I knew you," he said.</p>

<p>"That's not hard. Just look and see."</p>

<p>"It's going to take a hell of a man to keep up with you."</p>

<p>She bent in until her head was quite near. "Where'd that start?
I don't believe you meant it. What'd you say it for? You just said
it to make talk?"</p>

<p>"All right," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, don't." She was silent a moment, still looking closely at
him. "But why did you say it? What was in your head at that moment,
Rice?"</p>

<p>"Don't know."</p>

<p>Gram Gay, moving around the wagon, came to its back end and saw
them silently bent together in the shadows; and she withdrew until
only her head was in view, spying on them a moment, and presently
returned to the fire. Martha Gay said, "You call her for
supper?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Gram.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what's she doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Gram, and when Martha Gay made a turn to go
after the girl, Gram sharply said, "Stay here." She approached the
fire, she set aside the boiling coffeepot and the Dutch oven. Her
very dark face was like an apple which, evenly aging, had shrunk
away without heavy wrinkling. She murmured to herself; she kept an
eye on Martha Gay whose roused curiosity made her strain to hear
what went on beyond the wagon; she dished meat and dumplings for
John Gay, and dished for her husband&mdash;the old man who sat away
from the fire and said nothing. She murmured to him, "You all
right?" and got from him a small nod. Crouched, she looked beneath
the wagon and saw two pairs of feet still close together on the
wagon's other side.</p>

<p>Katherine said: "It's time to eat. Eat with us."</p>

<p>"I want to see Hawn again." Without warning he bent forward and
kissed her on the cheek. "Tell Eby I took something of his."</p>

<p>"You tell him. Anyhow it was mine, not his."</p>

<p>"If he laid his big hands on me he'd squash me like a bug."</p>

<p>"Not unless I told him to squash you like a bug. He wouldn't let
it trouble him otherwise."</p>

<p>"I'd let it trouble me."</p>

<p>"There's a difference," she said. She was silent, without
motion; she was closely watching him through the shadows. "What
for, Rice?"</p>

<p>"The idea came along. Fine idea. You taste good."</p>

<p>"What's the taste like?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. You mind it?"</p>

<p>She waited a moment before she spoke. "No," she said. "No, I
guess not." Then she left him, but he got the idea that he had
disturbed her.</p>

<p>Fires burned their yellow triangles into the fallen black and
against these bright plaques shapes moved and rain sparkled. He
walked to his own fire half-dead on the ground and built it, but he
stood without decision over it a short time and turned toward town.
When he reached the front of the hotel he thrust his hands into his
pockets and felt the loose change he had and walked into the
saloon. Hawn and the two Lockyears were at the bar.</p>

<p>Lockyear said: "You come to hear the eagle scream?"</p>

<p>"I'm goin' farther up the creek than that," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"And eat your liver raw," said Lockyear. There was enough liquor
in him to draw the veil away, to let the blooded push of his
arrogance come through. Now he was a trapper down from the
mountains, ready for some fun.</p>

<p>"Have a drink," said Lockyear.</p>

<p>"Right with you."</p>

<p>"Have to hump it to keep up with me," said Lockyear.</p>

<p>"You won't have to look around to find me any time," said
Burnett. Lockyear's head reared back, and he laughed as he measured
Burnett, and wildness was in his eyes, ready for the leap.</p>

<p>Hawn remembered his trapping days and was sentimental. He struck
the bar a strong blow. "By God, I'd like to eat my liver raw
again."</p>

<p>"Go out and butcher yourself a settler," said Lockyear. "They're
slower than buffalo and twice as foolish. I've got no use for the
entire God-damned breed; they ain't good for anything and don't
even grow pelts, and if you skinned one it would be a bad hide, the
grease all mixed up with it. They don't roar when they die, they
make a squealin' sound. No, never mind, Hawn&mdash;they ain't game
enough to make the shootin' fun. Burnett ought to know better, but
he likes 'em."</p>

<p>"The trouble with you," said Burnett, "is you want to stay a
wild man. Times are changing."</p>

<p>"Nothing or nobody will change me."</p>

<p>"Then you'll get rubbed out," said Burnett and downed his first
drink. He settled himself at the bar and waited for comfortableness
to begin; he swung himself toward Lockyear, and looked beyond to
Lockyear's brother Veen who stood silent in the background. They
were close, these two men&mdash;the able one and the cripple-footed
one, the protector and the protected; they were both Lockyears in
their calculated indifference to others.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you something about these people," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"Nothing to know," said Cal.</p>

<p>"You're wrong. They've got patience enough to fill a well, but
don't let that lead you to a mistake. The first thing they'll do
here is make some law to cover them. It won't be much&mdash;it'll
be loose enough to let everybody be comfortable. But you better
stay within it, better not make their law look foolish to them.
They'll come quick when you're in trouble. They'll put up with you
long after it seems reasonable. Then one day when patience is gone
they'll turn more cruel than any Sioux you ever saw and kill you
quick as a snake and go back to their plowin' and never give you
another thought."</p>

<p>Lockyear said: "They don't even squirm when they die. It's like
clubbin' porcupines&mdash;no struggle, not a sound."</p>

<p>"Sorry for you," said Burnett.</p>

<p>The remark struck its instant spark in Lockyear and he said,
"Take care who you're sorry for," and then he laughed again. "Well,
I came out here to see this scope of country. It's no good. Be full
of people in another ten years and I don't want to put in my life
lookin' across fences at the next man. Let's you and me light out
for California. I hear there's game aplenty and a man can get a
grant of land twenty miles square from the Mexicans. Women aplenty,
and Indians for work."</p>

<p>"It's only another hill," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing on the other side of that hill, Cal."</p>

<p>"You think there's anything here?" asked Lockyear. "This
miserable damned business of scratchin' a living out of a piece of
land? Squatted between a lot of other people? All the time arguin'?
My Christ, I got a bellyful of arguin' on this trip. Every time
anybody wanted to spit they stopped the train and called a meeting.
That's what you've got out here. What you intend to do?"</p>

<p>"Take up land and make a flour mill."</p>

<p>"And you the man that pulled your picket and lighted out fresh
every morning. Ten thousand miles of country and you tie yourself
to a yard with a flour mill in it." Lockyear gave out his heavy,
jeering laugh and shook his head. "You won't make it."</p>

<p>"What's for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Lockyear, "we'll winter here. Leave in the spring."
He turned and hooked both elbows against the bar; and he watched
the crowd in this barroom with a sparkling in his round, bold eyes;
and suddenly he filled his chest and launched a wild yell into the
room and watched the shocked men spring up or turn about or freeze
in their chairs; and as he looked at them he gave out a ringing
laugh. "Scared a year's growth from the crowd," he said to Burnett.
"Poor stuff, poor stuff." He was restless and the insolence of his
disposition was plainly upon him, for he looked directly from man
to man and seemed to wish for trouble, and brought his hand hard
upon the bar to express his discontent.</p>

<p>Billy Lord brought the townsman to the side of his wagon and
said in a small voice, "Stay here," and climbed into the wagon. His
wife was a huge mound beneath the quilts, the ruffles of her
nightgown nestled about her neck; a lace cap came down over her
ears, pink tie ribbon lost in the deep flesh of her chin. She was
flat on her back, wide awake and waiting for him with a China-doll
placidness; a small tuft of whiskers grew from a mole on her
chin.</p>

<p>"Somebody give you a drink, Billy?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Pity. I wish I had a dollar. I'd let you spend it for drinkin'.
What you lookin' for?" She watched him draw his fiddle and bow from
its case. "What you goin' to do?"</p>

<p>"Man and I got to arguin' about fiddles. I got to prove
somethin' to him." He returned to the man outside the wagon. He
murmured, "Come a little farther," and moved on fifty feet. He
tucked the fiddle beneath his chin in the drizzling darkness, he
tuned it and he drew the bow over the strings. He said: "Hear that?
Thing's been in my family hundred-fifty years. Came from Scotland
and the man that made it learned his business from that Eyetalian
that made fiddles best of all."</p>

<p>The townsman issued a small sound, neither agreeing nor
disagreeing. He took the fiddle and played a piece of a reel; he
retuned the instrument to please himself and played another snatch.
He said, "It's so damned dark I can't see if she's shaken or
sound."</p>

<p>"Give me back my fiddle," said Lord.</p>

<p>"I just said it, man," said the townsman. "It sounds like a good
fiddle."</p>

<p>"It's a God-damned good fiddle," said Billy Lord.</p>

<p>"Well, what you want for it?"</p>

<p>"What you got?"</p>

<p>"Wheat."</p>

<p>"What's wheat worth out here?"</p>

<p>"Sixty cents the bushel. But what's that mean to you if you've
got no money? This is a swap. This fiddle's worth how bad you want
wheat."</p>

<p>"Or how bad you want the fiddle," said Billy Lord.</p>

<p>"I think," said the townsman shrewdly, "you need wheat worse'n I
need a fiddle."</p>

<p>"Man don't live just on wheat," said Billy Lord, "and you know
it or you'd never be a fiddler in the first place." He was silent a
moment, then said: "Hundred bushels of wheat for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," said the townsman. "I'm nowise interested."</p>

<p>From the wagon came Mrs. Lord's quick call. "Billy&mdash;come
here."</p>

<p>"Hurry it," said Billy Lord, "or I can't sell at all."</p>

<p>"Fifty, then."</p>

<p>"You'd never get another fiddle like it if all the fiddles in
the world came across the plains. You'll never catch me another
year broke and wantin' to sell it. Don't grind a man down. You got
the advantage. Don't use it so hard."</p>

<p>"I tell you," said the man. "Sixty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lord's voice rose higher. "Billy, no&mdash;you come in
here. Come here!"</p>

<p>"No," said Billy Lord, "I guess we can starve it out
somehow."</p>

<p>"My last offer. Sixty."</p>

<p>"Billy! Don't you dare&mdash;don't you do it!"</p>

<p>Billy Lord said, "Give me the fiddle a minute, friend," and took
it and put it beneath his chin. He drew the bow slowly across the
strings. He played a measure of "Listen to the Mockingbird," and he
played it over four or five times, and handed back the fiddle. "All
right. Bring you the case in the morning. Tuck it under your
coat."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a scrip for the wheat at Abernethy's," said the
townsman and melted into the dark. Billy Lord returned to the wagon
and made long work of hauling his three hundred pounds up the wheel
and into the wagon. His wife sat bolt upright in bed.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, Billy, you sold it. I can't stand it. You go
back&mdash;go back and get it."</p>

<p>"We got to get through the winter," he said. "Now don't feel
bad."</p>

<p>Her lids crawled together and tears seeped through them and
rolled down the puckered homeliness of her face. He touched her
shoulder. "That won't do."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "you got to get it back. I got to hear you play
it&mdash;you know it was the first thing."</p>

<p>He teetered on one foot and the other, removing his boots; he
shucked his outer clothes and stood stooped and mountainous, the
great folds of his belly swelling against his flannel drawers. He
blew out the light and settled into bed beside her; he put an arm
around her and listened to her heaving cry.</p>

<p>"It was the first thing, Billy. You were playin' it at a dance
when I met you."</p>

<p>"Next year we'll get it back."</p>

<p>"Not that one. I'd rather sell my ring. I'd rather sell my
petticoats."</p>

<p>"Little large for swappin'," said Billy Lord.</p>

<p>"What'll you do&mdash;what'll you ever do when you feel like
some music?"</p>

<p>He was still a moment, thinking. Presently he said, "Just pucker
up and whistle. Old girl, you're crying like a faucet and the damn
bed's gettin' wet."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>THERE had been no call for a meeting, but the crowd grew until
there were a hundred men and women in a loose circle, dark-lumped
against the wet night, reddened and roughened by the glow of John
Gay's winding fire. Most of them had been in town and had found
information. Privately they had weighed the next move, and in
little groups they had discussed it; now they moved toward a common
center to make the problem common and to come to some kind of a
common decision, for though they were people of great independence
they were also political animals by practice, and the push of their
natures was toward the group.</p>

<p>A wise way of listening, and an ability to state opinions
without appearing to seek for authority, had made Gay one of the
leaders of the train; he was straight shirt sleeves, seeming to
want nothing. Had he tried to push himself forward he would have
been resented by these men who believed themselves equally capable
of leadership; since he did not, they gave him the respect he
hadn't asked for. He wasn't entirely without guile; he was a man of
very firm notions, believing in the decency of people yet aware of
the hard core of prejudice, superstition and selfishness in them;
and with this knowledge he fashioned his methods of persuasion,
when the need arose, to the cause he thought sound. On a larger
stage he would have been a statesman tempering his cause with the
practical and possible; on this rough edge of life he was the very
best type of mudsill leader.</p>

<p>So they gathered at his fire to create a kind of tribal
legislature whose deliberations gathered force by the need for
order which brought them here; for they well knew they could not
build roads or cabins or schools alone, and could not starve alone;
argue as they often did, and violently as they might dislike each
other&mdash;and there were bitter hatreds among
them&mdash;necessity made the compact.</p>

<p>There had been much talk concerning locations and a great deal
of personal opinion passed. When at last there was nothing new to
add John Gay, in his mild way, more or less recapitulated the pros
and cons of each location and brought the issue square-on.</p>

<p>"You'll go where you please, naturally, but it would be a good
thing if we could get a sizable group for one place; it would make
settlement a lot easier for all of us. I don't relish saying
good-by to people I've lived with these six months. It seems
unnatural to part, and I wish we didn't have to do it. There's no
question but what the winter's goin' to be severe for us. It would
be comforting if we could go through it together."</p>

<p>"You don't like that country off the prairie?" said McIver.</p>

<p>"What's the use of my coming this far to sit on six hundred and
forty acres of second-best when the best is to be had? But I
recognize the objections to the other land&mdash;the winter mud...I
also know I'd rather have neighbors. So if there's a strong group
inclined to that country around Bear Creek, I'll put my first
preference by, and go along."</p>

<p>"Where's that fellow Hawn?" asked Daniel Rinearson. "He knows
most about it."</p>

<p>Lorenzo Buck said: "He's in the saloon with the Lockyears."</p>

<p>"Well, where's Burnett? He talked to Hawn."</p>

<p>"In the saloon, too," said Buck.</p>

<p>"They been there an hour."</p>

<p>"Just well started."</p>

<p>Gay smiled and shook his head. Edna Lattimore, at the outer edge
of the ring, turned about and walked toward town at a rapid
gait.</p>

<p>Collingwood and his wife stood not far from the fire.
Collingwood had said a great deal during the meeting. When the
argument had gone strongly toward one location, he had spoken
favorably; when it had veered to another location he had found good
in the second place. He strained hard to be in tune with the
majority. With the evening talked out, he now again sought to
reflect the temper of the crowd by speaking the impatience he
sensed in it.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it's time to decide, ain't it? Why don't we
see where we want to go? Let's have hands on this. Who's for Bear
Creek?"</p>

<p>Men looked upon him from the shadowed circle and refused to be
moved. He waited, fire deepening the color of his naturally ruddy
face, and the waiting grew to be an embarrassment to him and
presently he said with a tone half between irritation and pleading,
"Well, boys, we got to go somewhere, ain't we? What's your
pleasure?"</p>

<p>He drew no response; he was the target of unsympathetic eyes, of
a lurking amusement. Having committed himself, he couldn't
gracefully withdraw and he faced his audience with a fixed smile.
Whitcomb noted Lucy Collingwood's glance suddenly drop to the
ground.</p>

<p>It was John Gay who quietly said, "Perhaps it's about time we
did decide. If there's a group for this Bear Creek, I'll join
it."</p>

<p>Rinearson said, "I favor it," and in a little while the circle
broke into pieces, the larger part of the crowd moving toward
Rinearson.</p>

<p>"Who's for the prairie?" called John Strang.</p>

<p>Somebody else spoke. "Anybody want to cross the river and go
down where that fellow Moss spoke of?"</p>

<p>Buck and his new wife turned from the circle, moving back to her
wagon. Buck said: "I'm disposed to throw in with Gay and go to Bear
Creek. Have you got any notions?"</p>

<p>"It's yours to say."</p>

<p>"Don't care to take you somewhere you don't want to go."</p>

<p>"What would you've said to your first wife?"</p>

<p>"I'd have said, 'We go to Bear Creek.'"</p>

<p>"Then that's the way it had better be with us."</p>

<p>They came to the wagon and stopped. She turned and watched the
shadow of his face in the rainy darkness. He said presently: "You
want me to sleep in the other wagon for a few nights?"</p>

<p>She was silent for a long run of moments, at last placing her
hand on his arm. "We can't start that way."</p>

<p>"It's a little quick for you."</p>

<p>"So it is," she said. "But you're my husband now. Come to
bed."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Reaching the town's street, Edna stopped across from the saloon.
When she grew tired of waiting she walked the street's full length,
watched the ragged shimmer of the falls through the black, and
returned to resume her station. It was a full hour before Burnett
came from the place and swung toward the wagon camp. He didn't see
her; he didn't seem to be drunk but he had his head down and
appeared to be absorbed by his thinking. She called over, "That
you, Rice?"</p>

<p>He crossed the mud and took her arm. He was cheerful, he had
just enough liquor to make him reckless. "What are you doing around
here?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "I just wanted to walk."</p>

<p>"You ought to be tired."</p>

<p>"I never get tired. Nothing bothers me much." When they came to
the entrance of the trail which led in a roundabout way toward
camp&mdash;the one along which she had gone early in the
day&mdash;she slackened her pace. "Let's not go right back," she
said, and by a little pressure she swung him into a trail; they
went past the town's houses and came to the lean-to shed. She put
her head through the doorway into the darkness.</p>

<p>"What's here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just a shed. There's some hay I saw this afternoon.
Rice&mdash;we don't get a chance to talk any more."</p>

<p>"All right." He followed her into the shed and heard her settle
on the hay and he dropped beside her and bore her back full length
and rolled her to him. Her arms came around him quick as a trap,
very strong, very needy; she lifted herself and dropped over him,
her mouth searching; he hung on until he grew rough and heard her
wince, and then he relaxed and lay beside her, listening to the
scarcely disturbed beat of her heart. The odor of her hair rose
through the hay smell; her breath fluttered on his skin. "You like
this?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes. Did I hurt you?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead. I know you like me then."</p>

<p>"I could sink into you till I drowned."</p>

<p>"That's a good way to die." She pushed against him, sighing.
"Now you're just yourself. We could have a lot of fine times. Go
on, smother me."</p>

<p>"Fine times&mdash;misery. Like trying to drink a river dry."</p>

<p>"That's nice. Not true, but nice. I'm no river but I've got
enough for you. Why do you keep away so much when you know you
could have kissed me a long time ago?"</p>

<p>"No time, no place."</p>

<p>"People can fix things if they want to."</p>

<p>"Big woman&mdash;big soft woman."</p>

<p>"That's from sitting on a wagon doing nothing. But I'll never
get fat. I don't like sloppy women. You like slim women best, like
Katherine. Slim in places, anyhow. What do you think about when you
look at her in that funny way-off way?"</p>

<p>"Don't know what."</p>

<p>"I know what. What it would be like to have her."</p>

<p>He said nothing. Her small laugh came to him. "If you kissed her
you could probably have her, too. She'd be thinking about
it&mdash;kissing, loving, sleeping. It goes right straight through.
What do you think of me? You do think of me, don't you?"</p>

<p>He moved his fingers over her face, around her neck. "Not hard
to think about when I'm tired, rolled up in my blankets."</p>

<p>"That's a good place. I think about you there too. What do you
think?'</p>

<p>"You're like the earth."</p>

<p>She lay silent, pondering. Her hand patted his back steadily. "I
don't know," she said. "I don't know what that's like."</p>

<p>"Nobody knows. Nothing to say about it. It just is. That's it.
It just is."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, pleased but skeptical. "There's nobody like
that. You've made it up." Gently the pressure of her hands
increased on his back. "If another man was lying here he wouldn't
be still."</p>

<p>"If another man was lying here he'd catch you off guard."</p>

<p>"No man can catch me off guard unless I want him to." She was,
from the tone of her voice, smiling in the dark. "You want to?"</p>

<p>"I want to&mdash;but I'm not going to," he said.</p>

<p>"Sometimes you're just a man, thinking the same thing they all
think. Then you're not, and I don't know what bothers you. I think
it's me&mdash;I mean, what I say."</p>

<p>"You come right out with it, that's for sure," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm the same as all of them only I don't bother to hide things.
You'd like it if I was a little bit mysterious. That's what makes
men so funny. They all would, up to a point. Just mysterious for a
little while, then they don't want them to be mysterious any more."
She moved in, adjusting her body to him. "You'd like to have me
nights. You'd like it a lot. You'd like it right now. But you've
got some other notion&mdash;I don't know, and then you don't like
me so much. You ought to know me. I'm a woman. You know about
women. I'll get married, I'll work, I'll have babies. It's the same
for everybody. That's all it is. I can do every one of those
things, and I'll do 'em fine."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"No you don't. You think there's something else. Tell me and
I'll try to be that way. If it's not foolish. If it's foolish, I
can't do it, Rice. Look at everybody. I mean husbands and wives.
You know how they are when they're running after each other. They
make a lot out of it. Then they get married and they use each other
till it's not new any more. Then they settle down&mdash;work and
babies. Tell me what else there is."</p>

<p>"I'd like to use you up."</p>

<p>She was silent a moment; then she murmured, "Well, go ahead. I'd
like it too."</p>

<p>"You want me to rape you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, the way you carry on, it's more like me raping you. You
know what I think sometimes? I think you're afraid."</p>

<p>"Throwin' rocks at me now," he said.</p>

<p>She pushed her fingers unexpectedly into his ribs and made him
jump. He rolled her away but she came back at him. He pinned her
below him, wrestling for her arms and feeling laughter bubble
within her and suddenly he settled himself and kissed her. Her
playfulness stopped. She lay motionless, sensuously absorbing him;
and in this blackness and stillness he was loosened by tender
feeling and he whispered, "Edna&mdash;Edna."</p>

<p>Her breathing quickened, her arms pulled him; she grew
dissatisfied and was all in motion beneath him, and she capsized
him and was above him, rougher with him than he had been with her.
He flung her around and pinned her below.</p>

<p>"Rice."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Rice! Oh, damn you&mdash;please! Rice!"</p>

<p><br>
<br>
She stirred and ran her fingers over his face, and whispering
sounds came from her&mdash;the light, sighing groan of her
pleasure; he felt ripples of laughter go through her. The pressure
left; she lay content. "Well, you've done it. You happy?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'm all rags, I'm loose feathers, I'm broken to pieces, I've
got no strength. I feel like cream inside, like silk all over me.
Oh, Rice." She rolled her warm, loose mouth around his face. Her
breathing settled. "You're not sorry?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You see&mdash;what's to be sorry for? What'd we lose, what'd we
do wrong? It cleaned me out, cleaned you out, just like fire
burning soot out of a chimney. That's good, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"That's good."</p>

<p>"I told you I could take care of you. I watch you, I see you get
nervous. You walk around, you want to fight something or break
something. I know what it is. It's gone now, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"All gone," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, that's it." She lay half over him, heavy and peaceful.
Her voice was sleepy. "It could be like this all the time," she
said and dropped her head to his arm and seemed to rest.</p>

<p>She had shown him how well she could take care of him in the
same unembarrassed way she might have lifted her hands to show him
the strength of her fingers. She had no doubt of her ability to
take the sting from him, to keep him contented; she had no doubt
that this was his only need&mdash;all other needs only being the
colored fancies rising from this one, like the mirages of cities
and rivers rising from the violent heat of a desert. Where had she
gotten that belief&mdash;from herself or from men? She waited for
him, confident that her body would bring him in. For a little while
he regretted having her, for he knew he'd want her again, that he'd
never quit wanting her. The recklessness of the saloon's whisky had
begun to wear off and, with need temporarily gone out of him, he
realized he couldn't rise and walk away from her with clear
conscience. For if she had been honest with him, this was not a
casual act but the first act of marriage. If she meant it that way,
he had to think of it that way.</p>

<p>She said, "You're thinking about something."</p>

<p>"Half asleep," he said.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "you're thinking. I can tell." She sat up. Her
tone had changed and he knew she was disappointed in him. "I
suppose there's hay all over me."</p>

<p>He rose. "I'll brush you."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said indifferently, "it's dark&mdash;it doesn't
matter." She took his arm and came up and rested against him a
moment, and once more he caught the waiting in her, the strong warm
hope. Then she drew back. "All right," she said and left the shed
with him. They followed the path through the trees into the camp
clearing, passing people moving away from Gay's fire. Short of the
fire she stopped. "I won't go there with all this hay on me. She'd
see it."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Katherine. Now you'll go there and look at her and think you
see something wonderful. Just you remember she's made like me." She
moved away, her manner lighter. "Think of me," she said and walked
rapidly toward her father's wagon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>THE group at the fire had settled to the Gays, the Collingwoods,
and Whitcomb and Lot White. John Gay said: "A lot of us have thrown
in for Bear Creek. You decided?"</p>

<p>"I want a creek with a fall of water for a mill," said
Burnett.</p>

<p>"Where'll that be?"</p>

<p>Burnett poured himself coffee from the pot on the fire.
Katherine's face hung steady, watching him from beyond the flame.
Whitcomb idly said: "Why spoil the liquor's comfort with coffee?
The comfort's hard to come by.</p>

<p>"This was," agreed Burnett. "It set on slow and never went
deep."</p>

<p>"Where'll you go?" insisted John Gay.</p>

<p>"With your outfit," said Burnett. "Hawn's going out in the
morning. He can be guide for us."</p>

<p>John Gay turned to Whitcomb. "You going along?"</p>

<p>"I stay here." Whitcomb sat back on his heels; his turning
glance touched Lucy Collingwood.</p>

<p>"I wish you were nearer," said John Gay.</p>

<p>"I'll ride the rounds," said Whitcomb. "I'll see you all many
times." He made a gesture. "I don't like endings."</p>

<p>"Why, Ralph," said Mrs. Gay, "I had no notion you were
sentimental."</p>

<p>"He ain't," said Lot White.</p>

<p>"You can go to hell for a foolish remark, Lot," said Whitcomb,
and rose from the fire to leave the group.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards Burnett finished his coffee and walked to
his bedroll and soon settled inside it and lay for a short time
with the flap thrown back, feeling occasional drops of rain come
through the sheltering tree. His fire was black, the falls made a
steady rumble in the night, wind ruffled the fir tops. Someone
crossed the soft ground and made a shadow over him.</p>

<p>"Rice&mdash;you asleep?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Katherine dropped beside him. "Feel better?"</p>

<p>"It was a waste of time."</p>

<p>She was silent. Presently he heard a small laugh come from her;
she was appreciating some joke of her own. "Come to our wagon for
breakfast. I'm glad you're going where we are. It makes me happy."
Her voice went unhurriedly along. "I wish everybody'd go to the
same place, stay together."</p>

<p>"What's up between Lucy and Whitcomb?"</p>

<p>"When did you notice that?"</p>

<p>"Tonight," he said.</p>

<p>"I think they're in love."</p>

<p>"I wonder what that is."</p>

<p>"What's got into you?"</p>

<p>"No, what is it?"</p>

<p>"If you've got to ask, then you've not got it."</p>

<p>"That's too easy. How would I know what it is?"</p>

<p>"You'll want a woman." She dropped nearer, catching a closer
view of his face. She waited for his answer; her hand lay idle on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I've wanted women without being in love," he said.</p>

<p>"That's different."</p>

<p>"Where's the difference?"</p>

<p>"That's being thirsty&mdash;that's just taking a drink of water
wherever the water's fit to drink."</p>

<p>"My God," he said and sat up in the bedroll.</p>

<p>"You didn't think I could say a thing like that, did you? You
think women just dream along. But you don't mean these funny
things."</p>

<p>"I want to know."</p>

<p>She shoved him back against the bedroll. "You'd been married a
long time ago if any woman would do."</p>

<p>"You didn't answer the question," he said.</p>

<p>"I said you'd know when it happened. That's enough. That's
it."</p>

<p>"You said a hole in a doughnut is a hole in a doughnut. That's
no answer. You don't know. Nobody knows."</p>

<p>"Crazy man." Her face hung over him, dark, serious, still.
"Don't tell me about my business."</p>

<p>"My business, too."</p>

<p>"Funny man. No it's not&mdash;not so much. Never could be as
much your business as mine."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because...I want you to see that Mrs. Irish gets a good piece
of land. All these men will be looking out for themselves. They'll
have no time for her. They might even crowd her out of something if
they wanted it. First thing we get to this place&mdash;you watch
out for her. You hear me?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>She went away.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
A late-arriving wagon groaned through the darkness, a tired man
cursing, a baby crying; little by little the camp settled and the
halloo of playing children ceased, and fires died to gleaming red
eyes on the earth.</p>

<p>Ralph Whitcomb, pacing the dark, looked toward the Collingwood
wagon to visualize Lucy, strongly attracted to her and believing he
had seen on her face some sign of a like interest. He wasn't
certain of it and his habit of viewing his acts with sometimes a
spectator's irony caused him to think now that he was deluding
himself; that as a lonely man he looked upon a fair woman and saw
in her eyes signals which weren't there. In such a state of mind he
could only believe that this was the old thing which amused him
when he observed it in others. Yet he was in revolt against the
reasonableness which had kept his life in low key; he was at that
stage when, struggling with morals and caution, he was about to
throw these things over and let himself be governed by the
unreasonable, wonderful dictates of his first wants. He would make
the break when he thought he saw some favor in her, and either
would be humiliated by her or would be encouraged. What would come
of it, he had no notion. Probably nothing good, but he was past
caring; he wanted her, he had to make his try. These wagon people
didn't anticipate much, they didn't drag old worries behind them.
They went ahead, rough and ready and a little callous spiritually,
and cried or laughed, and did what they were impelled to do and
took the consequences. They were a wonderful people.</p>

<p>Lucy Collingwood lay awake beside her sleeping husband, and
thought of Whitcomb and imagined the touch of his hands upon her,
and she stirred aside from Collingwood to let nothing foreign
disturb the illusion. Kneeling before a tree on the edge of camp
late this night Lot White called upon the Lord to make Ralph
Whitcomb see the light; crouched over a dying fire Cal Lockyear
listened to Whit Rinearson speak of a Hudson's Bay messenger who
rode on schedule between Fort Vancouver and this town with his gold
pouch; and Cal Lockyear stared long at Whit, and murmured, "That's
something interesting, ain't it?" Side by side in bed John and
Martha Gay quietly discussed the long winter to come, the food they
had, the money remaining, the things they might do without, the
things they had to have, and Martha said: "I don't see how we can
make it," and John Gay said, "We'll make it somehow. These hands
can do what's to be done." But he said nothing of the one hand
which of late seemed half numb. Standing alone in the night, Roxy
Kitchen doubled her fists and listened for the sound of steps to
come along and stop near her&mdash;a man's steps, any man's steps;
and restless in bed, Edna Lattimore pressed her hands hard against
her thighs and tried to think of Rice Burnett; what kept breaking
through this warm reverie was the challenging shape of Cal
Lockyear. Billy Lord and his wife slept, both snoring. Mrs. Irish
listened to the breathing of her son, remembering how worked down
he was, and wondered how much more he could stand. She was both
bitter and sad for the boyhood he had lost, and silently prayed:
"Lord let me last till he's eighteen&mdash;then I'll not mind."
Half listening to the quiet talk of her parents, Katherine Gay
remembered Rice Burnett's question about love&mdash;"I wonder what
it really is?" She could not believe, from that question, that he
was in love with Edna. She remained long awake, thinking of
him.</p>

<p>So the camp lay, a small world of wagons with a spurious quiet
upon it; within the covering canvas all these people rested, but
few were at rest and their cries, if spoken aloud, would have
filled the night. Turning in his blanket roll, Rice Burnett felt
the weight of Edna upon him. He loved her if love was an appetite,
if it was warmth and explosion and rest, and wakening to hunger
again. She was calmer than any living person he knew; and she knew
him and laughed at him for his notions, and perhaps she was right.
He turned again and listened into the night with an outdoor man's
close perception of sound and smell, of small currents of noise
twining through each other, each with a separate meaning. The rain
fell in desultory fashion; the rank night odors lay heavy in the
fog. All the stars were hidden beyond this low ceiling. He was
lonely and not even the imagined nearness of Edna settled the
loneliness. There were other things out there beyond his finger
tips, beyond the next hill.</p>

<p>He had come to Oregon to get away from this search for things
beyond sight; the search was done and it was time to settle and to
accept what he saw, not what he imagined; but the yonder still
haunted him; it would never let him alone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>THE rain had ceased, the morning mist was a silver haze upon the
earth, the odors of fire and mud and fir and river thickened the
air. Men caught up their stock, and wagons began a groaning march,
and here and there women clasped each other, crying. Whitcomb
walked through the crowd to say farewell. He shook hands with Gay,
paid his respect to the other Gays on the wagon, and paused by
Rice. "Best of luck. Best of everything." He came upon the
Collingwood wagon and removed his hat before Lucy who sat above him
on the seat. He said: "It will be a raw day&mdash;are you
warm?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Pull your coat higher around your neck." He turned to
Collingwood. "George, you ought to wrap a blanket about her feet.
She'll be chilled in an hour."</p>

<p>"I'll do that," said Collingwood and grasped Whitcomb's hand
with his overcordial manner rising. "We'll never forget what you
did for Lucy. Come see us often. Door's always open. Whatever we've
got is yours&mdash;anything, any time."</p>

<p>Settlers bound for the plains to the west and south of the river
were already crossing on the ferry, voices calling back.</p>

<p>"So long. See you next spring!"</p>

<p>"Ride over our way!"</p>

<p>"Soon's we get settled!"</p>

<p>"Good luck!"</p>

<p>"Tell Josie to save that big kettle!"</p>

<p>Hawn rode through camp, buckskin legs loosely banging on the
hide of his small horse. He said to Burnett, "We better get
started." Burnett put his pack string into motion, threaded a way
through the column of wagons, stock and trudging people, and fell
into the town street. Somebody began to sing and in a little while
the song caught hold, spreading through camp and along the column
and out upon the water where the ferry was; men and women joined
in, the song growing until the whole area was loud with it:</p>

<p class="poem">Yes, we'll gather at the river,<br>
The beautiful, the beautiful river,<br>
Gather with the saints at the river<br>
That flows by the Throne of God.</p>

<p>A shouting rose along the column and somebody fired a gun. Hawn
shook his head. "They better save that."</p>

<p>Beyond town a black rock bluff came forward to crowd the narrow
road against the river; at the top of the bluff the column crossed
a flat place and entered a long stretch of forest which ended
before a natural meadow. Beyond the meadow the forest began again;
and in such alternation of open and closed land they traveled
twelve miles that day. On the following day the land began to open
up so that they had sight of a prairie flattening into the forward
haze, its plain broken by occasional groves of fir and oak which,
from a distance, seemed like ships standing at anchor. Hawn took
them to the edge of this prairie and swung easterly and followed a
course which kept them out of the sodden bottoms. They crossed an
occasional creek, a small river, and another yellow stream
meandering through the country like a crooked snake. On the third
day a few families fell out of the train, liking the land they saw.
The hills broke into small buttes, short valleys lying between.
Westward the prairie ran into a rain mist which had been with them
during the whole journey, while to eastward they caught a passing
sight&mdash;as the mist briefly thinned during the better part of
the day&mdash;of foothills moving into mountains of great bulk and
height. They went over two more creeks on the fourth morning, and
at this point the train began to shrink as individual families
found their favored places.</p>

<p>Somewhere during afternoon, the remnant of the column passed
through the notch of a low hill and came into a small valley cut by
a creek.</p>

<p>Hawn said, "My place is up that creek two miles. This is all
empty. Down south you'll find rolling hills&mdash;Old Waldo's
yonder&mdash;but there's only two families in the whole scope and
she's a lonely place. Big prairie's out to the west, five or six
families mudded in for the winter. That's all."</p>

<p>The wagons parked and next morning individual men rode off on
their private scouting expeditions; as they returned they took
their wagons away and by nightfall fifty square miles had become a
settlement&mdash;this valley, the hills around it, the short
prairies which adjoined it, and some of the adjacent bottom land of
the big prairie. The trip was done. In twilight campfires winked at
far intervals and even then the sound of axes began, and continued
as darkness gathered, and rang on and on through the night. To
Burnett, listening, it was something like the ticking of a new
clock which, beginning with a first ragged rhythm, slowly settled
for a lifetime's marking of the hours.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>GAY was down the creek three miles from the ford, his farmer's
instincts drawn to the lower, richer land. Upstream from him the
McIvers settled, and the Provosts and the Collingwoods and
Lattimores. Billy Lord dropped back a short distance to claim a
mile square which would include the notch through which they had
traveled and the round knob of a hill on which he wanted to build
his cabin. The view delighted him and he surrendered at least
thirty acres of flat meadow to get it. Burnett marked off for Mrs.
Irish a half-section directly above the point where an Indian trail
crossed the creek's ford. "The road will probably go through here,
and you'll be right on it, and you can put up people and feed 'em,
and make something." The Rinearsons continued beyond the ford and
beyond the shallow ridge which enclosed this valley; over there was
a piece of country undulating from meadow to knoll, perfect for a
stockman with its hay fields and its cool slopes in summertime; and
there was enough of it to let his sons take their claims around
him. Buck was up the trail from Mrs. Irish; the Millards and
Walkers and Mclvers and Kerns and Crabtrees and Kitchens and
Purroys settled in a widening circle around the ford, so that Mrs.
Irish's place was, as Burnett had forecast, a center spot. Eby
dropped westward, his section entirely on the bottom lands of the
big prairie, and one by one the neighbors fitted themselves in
where it pleased them; for there was room enough as far as the eye
might reach. The Lockyears vanished in the timber, seeking the
hills, and Rice Burnett threw off his packs in a narrower part of
the valley, upstream from the ford and not far from the
Lattimores.</p>

<p>He had less tillable land and more timber than most of the rest
but what he wanted was a power site for a grist mill; and he
settled beside the creek at a point where it came upon a ledge of
sheetrock and dropped fully two feet to create a head of water
sufficient to drive a mill wheel. The surrounding meadows would do
for orchard, pastures and tilled fields; the rising hill behind him
had wood enough to supply him forever, and the water-level grade
beside the creek made a mile road to the main road at the Irish
claim an easy thing to build, or so he thought when he first looked
at the land&mdash;before he had touched hands to the trees
scattered along the way. What he intended to be was the miller for
this part of the country.</p>

<p>The Lattimores were nearest him, half a mile downstream, hidden
by a strip of timber which ran from hillside to water. Across the
creek, opposite the Lattimores, the Millard wagon was screened by
an alder clump; and so it went with most of these people: they were
neighbors whose cabins would eventually be from a half mile to a
mile apart yet they were shut away from each other by timber or by
the roll of the land. Sometimes Burnett heard their axes ringing.
At night he caught the glow of their fires. Otherwise he was alone
and thrown upon his own resources.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
For all these people the ordeal by work had commenced. The idea of
a land of milk and honey had grown week by week on the overland
journey until even their powerfully practical minds had become
infected with the notion of an easy life on a beautiful, bountiful
earth. This was the end of it. The rain continued to fall, not in
harsh intemperance, but with a niggling persistence which, the
citizens of Oregon City had warned them, might last until the
following spring. The air was everlastingly damp, not bitter but
clammy and penetrating; the unequal temperatures of rain and earth
brought up sleazy layers of mist from the ground and these lay upon
everything from afternoon through late morning of the next day,
closing in until there was no distance around, no head room
above.</p>

<p>To people accustomed to a positive climate, to strong heat and
sharp cold, to full sunshine or the immediate intensity of
cyclones, this damp, gray, soft drizzling indeterminate kind of
weather was hard to bear. They had been born and raised in a land
of dramatic and even dangerous changes and their tempers fed upon
such change; this monotony of grayness and wetness and softness,
good as it might be for their bodies, was hard on their souls. It
didn't lift them; it flattened them until they complained of
possessing no energy; they slept heavily and woke tired and looked
into the rain again and found no zest in the day's work. They were
moreover worried; for they had to break these tough, sodden fields
and get in the wheat which would keep them alive the following
year, and when they tested the soil their farming experience told
them they dared not put a plow to it short of a week of dry
weather&mdash;and this they feared they might not get.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Burnett's first chore was to set up a tarpaulin as a rude tent
which would shelter his packs and himself. Afterwards he took time
to make a survey of the falls and to dig an exploratory shovel into
various parts of his meadowland. On the first day, with a baited
hook on a long hank of string, he caught four trout and he looked
hopefully on the creek until he remembered that other settlers, as
hungry as he, would fish out this water in quick time. From the
tent, actually standing inside the tent at the time, he watched a
buck deer walk from the woods toward the water and he killed it at
a distance of fifty feet, and he realized that within a month other
settlers' guns would drive such easy game away. He dressed out his
meat, took a quarter to the Lattimore's and left a quarter with
Mrs. Irish.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
When he had time to smoke his pipe late that night he visualized
the things to be done and calculated the work which each chore
required and placed the chores in their order of
importance&mdash;and all this labor came at him in a lump and
pressed him with its urgency; but his handworker's sense of
thriftiness controlled him. Whatever he wasted in time or energy
was forever lost. He was in a race with summer when the wheat came
in and his grist mill would be needed; he was, when he considered
it, ten years too late in the longer race of his life; for he was
thirty and long ago should have settled down. So he took care to
plan the proper location of the mill, to visualize his cabin in
such a place that it could be, at another day, the storehouse of a
frame home which sometime would rise; and he spotted his barns and
sheds where they should go, and the fence lines, and the road which
would run by this place. Having done this much he walked to the
hillside and began to chop down proper-sized firs; he cut them into
lengths, teamed them to the cabin location, and squared them; he
trimmed saplings for rafters and left them in a handy pile, and
found a cedar and dropped it and sawed it into bolts from which he
would later rive his shakes. With this material at hand, he took
his team and his tools and followed the trail to the ford,
recruiting Lattimore, Collingwood, Buck and Provost along the way,
these men occupied with working out their cabin stuff the same as
he had been, and so reached Mrs. Irish's claim with a considerable
work party.</p>

<p>Young Watt had brought in a few logs with the ox team and Mrs.
Irish, when the party arrived, was busy with the crosscut saw; the
first tier of cabin logs was already notched and fitted. Burnett
took the saw from Mrs. Irish and by noon the five men had the logs
ready and the cedar bolts cut. They ate trout which Mrs. Irish had
caught in the creek, and cornbread with blackstrap and coffee;
during the afternoon Millard and McIver came up to join the group
and at five o'clock the cabin was walled in, the doorway
rough-framed, the rafters set and the fireplace hole cut.</p>

<p>"You needn't come tomorrow," said Mrs. Irish. "Watt and I can
split and lay on the shakes&mdash;and we'll put in the
fireplace."</p>

<p>"Dig down till you get straight clay for the fireplace," said
Burnett. "Go along the meadow and cut a lot of that fallen hay to
mix in. Make your first fire a small one&mdash;bake it out slow and
she'll get brick hard. Who's ready next for a raisin'?"</p>

<p>It turned out that Provost had everything ready for his cabin.
The gathered men agreed to meet at Provost's on the following
morning and set off in the graying evening for their claims. From a
distance Burnett looked back to see Watt Irish already riving
shakes from the cedar bolts. Mrs. Irish was at the creek again,
fishing.</p>

<p>"We're all going to get damned sick of fish," said Provost.</p>

<p>"They won't last," said Burnett. "Neither will the deer."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lattimore, "I've got an old pair of boots I can
stew up."</p>

<p>Lattimore was the last to leave Burnett; passing on through a
heavy stand of timber, Burnett reached his tent to find Bob Hawn
squatted in its shelter waiting.</p>

<p>"My squaw's a fine cook," said Hawn.</p>

<p>"I'm your man," said Burnett and, saddling his horse, he
followed Hawn upward along the creek, through one narrowing meadow
after another, until the hills began to crawl down against the open
flats. Hawn's cabin sat face to the water and back to the timber
scarcely a stone's throw from his door. It was the sort of site
that an ex-mountain man might pick, a creek close at hand to remind
him of beaver, the hills for hunting and grass enough for his
horses. To one side of the cabin a garden spot still contained its
old cornstocks and a few rows of late vegetables; along the cabin's
four outer walls deer horns hung side by side. Hawn gave a short
whoop as he neared the cabin and got down with a cheerful, "Here's
my lodge."</p>

<p>He went in first, said a few short words in some Indian tongue
and stepped aside for Burnett. It was the neatest of cabins, a
fireplace ablaze, a bed built against one wall, a table, two
peg-legged benches to sit on and some shelves built into one of the
corners; in the fourth and vacant corner a blanket had been spread
on the floor and a few pouches and trinkets hung from the wall.
Hawn's woman stood in this corner.</p>

<p>She was a pretty woman, pale brown rather than dark copper; she
was, as close as Burnett could judge, somewhere between twenty and
twenty-five, with obsidian-black hair, round, rich brown eyes,
pleasant mouth and small nose. She wore a white woman's waist, a
buckskin skirt and moccasins; and when Hawn spoke to her in her
tongue, her glance went to him and remained with him until he
ceased to speak; then it traveled to Burnett. As soon as she smiled
her face became expressive and pointed with mischief. She said
something to Hawn.</p>

<p>"She says you look hungry and that all my friends seem to be
hungry people. Her name is Louisa."</p>

<p>"You gave it to her?" queried Burnett.</p>

<p>"Sure, she wanted a white woman's name. So I picked it. Then she
wanted to know what girl I'd known by the name of Louisa. You can't
get around a woman, Indian or any kind. The wash basin's out
back."</p>

<p>Burnett washed and returned to take a seat before the table.
Hawn sat opposite; after his woman had laid the food on the table
she stood back, but Hawn hooked an arm around her waist and drew
her down to the bench beside him. "I can't quite break her of that
habit. Alone, she'll eat with me. With company, she goes
Indian."</p>

<p>The woman spoke to Hawn, who said: "She's inquisitive. Wants to
know what I'm saying." Then he spoke to her and she nodded, and
laughed at him.</p>

<p>"She's not Molala," said Hawn. "She's Calapooia. That's a tribe
south of this place. The smartest Indians in Oregon. I was trappin'
that country three years ago and stopped in her old man's camp.
Pretty soon I found myself tradin' six horses, two Hudson Bay
blankets and a rifle with ten pounds of shot for her. It was a deal
between the old man and me, like it always is. But these Indian
women have got a way when their minds are made up and I think she
worked the whole thing. If I want to make her mad all I got to do
is tell her I could have bought her for two horses. I don't make
her mad very much, for when an Indian gal gets mad it goes down to
her bones and stays there a long time." He looked at her; he laid
his arm about her waist and squeezed. She pushed his arm aside and
grew solemn.</p>

<p>"Who are these Molallies you're talking about?" Burnett
asked.</p>

<p>"They're up this valley, in the hills. You'll see 'em passing
back and forth. They're not like Shoshones for honest, but they
ain't Blackfoot for tough, either. Used to be a big tribe until
smallpox reduced 'em. They ain't made trouble so far, and I get
along well with 'em."</p>

<p>"Settlers always bring on trouble," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Hawn, "they've been grumblin'. They see what's
comin'. But they ain't enough for a very big war. If a fight should
come up, some white man will start it."</p>

<p>Burnett said, "Probably," and went on with his meal. It was a
good meal, venison stewed in with potatoes and carrots and onions,
Dutch oven bread baked from whole ground wheat, butter and milk and
coffee, and little blue berries cooked with the stems on.</p>

<p>"Those things are huckleberries," said Hawn. "She picks and
dries 'em in cakes, Indian fashion. They look like hell till
they're cooked...You don't know it but she's got you sized up."</p>

<p>"I'm her friend. You tell her if she wants anybody killed, let
me know."</p>

<p>Hawn laughed and spoke to Louisa, and she smiled and spoke back.
"She wants to know if you've got a squaw," said Hawn.</p>

<p>"Tell her I've got no horses to buy a woman with." Having fed
himself, Burnett lighted a pipe and settled on the corner blanket.
Hawn squatted by him, and the two men smoked through a long silence
while Louisa moved around the table, moccasined feet making no
noise. She ignored the men and when she finished her dishes she
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Now she'll prowl in the dark with her arms crossed, and God
knows what she'll be thinking," said Hawn. "You never can get that
far back into an Indian woman."</p>

<p>"How far up this creek the Lockyears go?" asked Burnett.</p>

<p>"Three miles."</p>

<p>"Don't leave your woman alone too much," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"They won't fool with her. Get killed if they do." Hawn settled
to an elbow. "Louisa and me have been awful happy here. I kind of
got out of the white man's way of makin' trouble. I can squat and
watch a beaver workin' all day long. I can listen, I can smell, I
can just soak in comfort. Don't think of money, I don't think of
gettin' anywhere, don't want anything. What's to want I ain't got?
Now you people come and it won't be the same. In white people's
eyes I'm a squaw man and she's only a red savage and they'll make
her feel it. It'll put trouble in her head, and then she'll wonder
what I'm thinkin' about it."</p>

<p>"Wait and see," suggested Burnett.</p>

<p>Hawn shook his head. "I'd damned near forgotten I was white or
she was red. I'd almost lost the thing that makes white people
unhappy, makes 'em quarrel and scheme and grab everything in sight.
I'd about got myself to where a man ought to be. Now you come, and
I'm just white enough to catch the fever back from you, and there's
nothin' but misery in it."</p>

<p>Louisa slipped into the room and settled bolt upright on the
edge of the bed, watching them. Hawn beckoned to her with his hand
but she shook her head and remained an observant spectator. "Look
at her," murmured Hawn. "Even now she knows, she smells it coming.
She's a wonderful woman." Then he made an abrupt change of subject.
"What you going to do down there by the riffle?"</p>

<p>"Put up a grist mill."</p>

<p>"That your trade?"</p>

<p>"Worked in a mill for a couple years."</p>

<p>"You'll do business," said Hawn. "No mill nearer than Oregon
City or the French Prairie right now. Where you going to get your
stones?"</p>

<p>"I saw a couple at Fort Vancouver which can be bought. They came
from England in a Hudson Bay ship as ballast."</p>

<p>"You people have got to learn a lot of new things out here,"
said Hawn and rose to face the door; the sound of horses came in
and a voice struck over the yard and in a moment Cal Lockyear
entered the cabin, followed by his brother. When he discovered
Louisa, Cal Lockyear's glance settled on her with a round, bold
interest. He stamped the mud from his feet. "That's a neat female
you got there. Where you find her? Might want one myself."</p>

<p>"You go to hell."</p>

<p>Lockyear walked toward Louisa. "Had one like her once. Mandan
woman. This one's cleaner, though, and she's got more of a body to
her. She looks like better sleepin'." He raised his arm to touch
her. Hawn spoke to him in the same idle tone.</p>

<p>"Keep your God-damn hands off that woman."</p>

<p>Lockyear wheeled about and to his face came a very close
expression, a sudden peering interest in Hawn, a tenseness, an odd
smiling. "Don't say that to me."</p>

<p>"I'm no slow buffalo for your stickin'," said Hawn, beginning to
show his amusement. "I been to the forks of the creek too."</p>

<p>"No," insisted Lockyear, "don't say it. You don't know me, so I
let you say it. But don't say it again."</p>

<p>"Now slap your leg and crow," said Hawn. He lifted his head,
gray eyes close-fixed on Lockyear. There was a quarrel here and he
was pleased with it and he threw a side glance toward Burnett and
let an easy laugh drop into the room. "The man's trying to use me
for a greenhorn." He shook his shoulders and laid his glance back
against Lockyear. "Hell, I've heard that story too many times.
You're half an alligator, half a man. You're the big wind and the
trees fall down. Yellowest one started where you spit. You been
havin' fun with these settlers, friend Cal, but don't try to have
fun with me because I was where the fun started."</p>

<p>Lockyear looked toward his brother. "The son-of-a-bitch," he
said. "I'll have to do it, Veen."</p>

<p>Veen Lockyear let his attention hang a long moment on Burnett.
Then he looked back to his brother and made a signal with his chin,
indicating Burnett. Cal swung to Burnett.</p>

<p>"What'll you do? Stay out of it or come into it?"</p>

<p>"I'll do what I please," said Burnett cheerfully.</p>

<p>Lockyear divided his interest between Hawn and Burnett. All
three were coolly amused, were certain of themselves; only Veen in
the background showed concern.</p>

<p>Lockyear said to Burnett: "You and Veen step outside and shut
the door. Take the squaw with you. I don't want her at my back with
a knife."</p>

<p>Burnett said, "It's up to Bob."</p>

<p>"Suits me fine," said Hawn promptly. He spoke to Louisa. She
went by the men with her eyes downward and stepped into the yard.
Burnett put a hand on Veen's shoulder and used a little force to
swing the small brother around. "Come on."</p>

<p>Veen knocked Burnett's arm aside. "I'll stay here," he said.
"Cut it out, Cal, and let's go home."</p>

<p>Burnett seized the small man at the armpits with both his hands,
flung him about and pushed him toward the doorway. "You're a good
rooster, Veen, but you've got no spurs."</p>

<p>Cal Lockyear said, "Let go him. Veen&mdash;run out and get the
gun off my saddle."</p>

<p>"Veen," said Burnett, "if you do any runnin' I'll strangle you
in the creek."</p>

<p>Hawn, more and more delighted by this affair, let go with a
roaring laugh. "You won't get the chance. Louisa's outside the door
with a knife and she'll drive it into his ribs far as the trade
mark."</p>

<p>"All right," said Cal Lockyear. "Call off the squaw."</p>

<p>"Well now," said Hawn, "we ain't had our fun."</p>

<p>"Call her off."</p>

<p>Burnett turned Veen back and dropped his arms. He kept an eye on
Veen, not knowing the little man's disposition; and now and then he
threw a look toward Lockyear. Hawn spoke Louisa's name, summoning
her into the room; she moved to the farthest corner and watched Cal
Lockyear, plainly hating him, plainly wishing to kill him; she had
both hands behind her. Cal Lockyear shook his head at Burnett. "You
should of stayed out of this."</p>

<p>"I like his grub," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"God damn you," said Lockyear.</p>

<p>"And God damn you," said Burnett promptly.</p>

<p>"The hell with it," said Lockyear. "It was a good fight
spoiled."</p>

<p>"Come again," said Hawn. "Any time."</p>

<p>"She have a knife?" asked Lockyear.</p>

<p>Hawn said, "Big enough to skin you."</p>

<p>Lockyear shrugged his shoulders, said irritably to Burnett,
"Don't rub your horns on me any more, Rice," and pushed his brother
through the doorway and shortly afterwards rode on through the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Almost made his jump," observed Hawn. "It was his brother's
skin that stopped him. He always protects the little fellow."</p>

<p>Burnett said: "Tell Louisa she's a fine cook," and rode
homeward, feeling better for the visit.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>HAWN lay in bed with his woman, watching the dying light of the
fire tremble on the cabin walls. She rested, quiet, an arm under
him, an arm on his hip; she said nothing, she let him alone, but
she was waiting for him and would respond when the time suited him.
She didn't have a white woman's ideas of partnership; she didn't
argue or speak her mind. She was his woman, bought and paid for,
and she was proud of it. Even when he went against her common sense
or her ingrained custom, as he sometimes did, she made no fuss; on
such occasions she had a short gesture she used, one finger cutting
across the air before her, and then he knew he had reached a
boundary. He didn't know what lay beyond the boundary; that was a
country he couldn't get into, couldn't even guess at, for it was a
wild land, it was Indian land, not white; and that was the one
difference between them which troubled him. During most of the time
he gave it no thought and the silence between them was good and he
could ask for nothing better, but when he wanted to understand her
and be understood by her, when he wished for that final intimacy
between man and woman, he knew that no matter how long they lived
they would never have it, and then loneliness would come upon
him.</p>

<p>She spoke up. "He said something about me. I looked at your face
and saw it."</p>

<p>"Nothing. It was a bad tongue. He wanted to fight."</p>

<p>"But there was no fight," she said, and he knew she wondered
whether it was he or Lockyear who had backed away. It was suddenly
an important thing between them, for she had the simplest standard
of courage; there were no allowances in her mind, no middle ground
between bravery and cowardice. What might be to him a respect for
life or a sense of pity would seem a weakness to her. It made him
quickly say: "The man saw it was a bad time to fight and went
away."</p>

<p>"He's a snake, he's a Molala hiding in the brush. He'll kill you
when you don't look. You better kill him first."</p>

<p>"That's not the way."</p>

<p>"Not your way, not white. It's foolish."</p>

<p>Nothing he might say would change her mind, but having said it,
she put it aside and lay waiting. She made no motion whatever, but
the restlessness called out of her and when he turned to her she
came at him and then there was no boundary, there was only the man
and the woman business which was the same for red or white (or
brown or black or yellow). He had taught her nothing about that
except one thing; he had taught her to kiss, and what at first had
seemed queer to her she now liked and did well.</p>

<p>Afterwards, lying quiet, she asked the question she had so often
asked. "As good as white women?"</p>

<p>"Better."</p>

<p>"Why don't Burnett have a woman, a white woman?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Not enough white women?"</p>

<p>"Plenty of single ones he could pick out."</p>

<p>"Plenty for you too," she said.</p>

<p>So it had come to her. He sat upright and hauled her against
him. "No," he said. "You&mdash;that's plenty." He wanted to tell
her how he felt about her and the pleasure she had given him; he
wanted to reassure her with words, but there were no words in the
thin language they used. This was a lonely moment and sadness got
into him for the insufficiency, and there came to him again the
fear which he had felt on first seeing Katherine Gay and Edna
Lattimore and the other white girls of the train. In a way he knew
the ending of it already. He rocked her back and forth on the bed,
speaking to her in English.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>UP and down the creek's narrow valley, and along the trail as
far as Rinearson's, the forest began to show fresh-scarred stumps
as the logs fell; and crooked trails appeared where these logs were
skidded down hillsides and across meadows to the various cabin
sites, and crews formed and moved from claim to claim, making quick
work of a chore which for the individual would have been the labor
of many days. There was no such thing as a drawn plan of a cabin
among them; as with everything they did, these people used the
cut-and-dry method. The cabins were small, about sixteen feet long
by ten or twelve wide; such smallness provided little comfort and a
large family, bedded down at night, covered the floor, but the
immediate need was protection from the weather and except for
sleeping and for meals these families were usually out-of-doors. It
was considered impractical to waste labor on a cabin which, in a
few short years would be a pantry off the kitchen of the larger
frame house they hoped to build.</p>

<p>They were thus of one shape and dimension, no man being better
housed than another, the peeled logs shining pallid in the dull
winter's light, ragged at the corners where the chopped butts lay
upon each other in their notches. The chinking was a later labor
when other chores were less pressing; the floors were plain dirt,
to be afterwards covered with split and adzed logs, this again when
time permitted. There was a doorway, stopped by a temporary blanket
or bit of canvas; there was a window opening in each end, also
closed by canvas until deerskin could be cured and oiled and used
as a substitute for glass. The fireplace took a large part of one
wall; the rafters were poles bound with thongs; across the rafters
other poles were placed as sheeting, and on these were laid the
cedar shakes. Into such a quick-built shelter were placed a few
pieces of furniture carried overland; the fresh clay-and-stick
fireplace was lighted&mdash;slowly to dry brick-hard; the crane was
fastened in, the big pot swung over to boil, the Dutch oven laid
nearby; and this was home, wind pouring through every interstice,
rain trickling here and there along the inner walls, smoke belching
back into the room at each strong gust of wind.</p>

<p>Half a day built a cabin&mdash;men specializing in chores long
enough to become quick at them, some teaming in the logs, some
notching and fitting, some building the fireplace, others riving
and laying shakes. Lattimore's cabin went up, then Buck's and
Collingwood's, and Millard's across the creek, and Walker's and
Mercer's. Below the ford other crews worked, at Gay's and McIver's
and Monteith's and Crabtree's. On the little hill back of the ford
Billy Lord's place was a landmark to be seen two miles along the
trail. When all the families were sheltered a crew came up to help
Burnett on his cabin, and late of an afternoon he threw his bedroll
into the finished place and watched his neighbors turn wearily
homeward.</p>

<p>Their fatigue reminded him of his own. Ten clays had passed
since arrival and each day of that time, from first morning light
until darkness set in, he hauled and cut logs at one claim or
another, and hiked his one or two or four miles home. They had all
done this; they were all dull horses plodding back and forth
through the trees and over the meadows, treading out the pathways
and roads which would serve them the rest of their lives. He
lighted a slow fire on the fireplace and walked the meadows to test
the spongy earth; and in the misty twilight he returned to the
cabin and found Edna waiting with a supper she had brought from her
own place.</p>

<p>"It's a housewarming," she said. "What have we got for
dishes?"</p>

<p>He brought in a pack and laid out the dishes, using the bedroll
as a table. She made coffee and dished the food&mdash;a chunk of
venison and molasses and bread&mdash;and sat beside him on the
blanket roll to eat it. "That trail through the timber's an awfully
dark place," she said. "It's going to be pretty, looking out of
this window to the creek."</p>

<p>"I'll get the floor in tomorrow and spend a day dressing it
down. Don't like splinters on my feet."</p>

<p>"Or your woman's," she said. She waited for him to rise to it,
saw that he wouldn't, and went on with her eating. Her expression
was gentler than usual; she was closer to him, she was quieter in
her manner.</p>

<p>"I'll mud the logs in, build a bunk and a table and a couple of
chairs. A shelf in that corner. A door. Then, if the rain hangs
off, it's time to plow."</p>

<p>"It'll look nice. You're handy with tools." She got more coffee
and they sat silent to drink it; she collected the dishes and moved
outside to find a pan for washing.</p>

<p>He said, "Don't bother about that," but she went on with her
business and he lay back on the blanket roll, hands propped under
his head, and watched her.</p>

<p>"If you've got any liquor," she said, "you ought to take a drink
before you sleep."</p>

<p>"Haven't got any."</p>

<p>She did the dishes at the fire, kneeling on the ground; and the
strong light and strong shadow so rounded her that when she was
momentarily still she had for him the thick, indestructible quality
of a statue. She sensed his watching and turned her head, and the
slow smile came; and as soon as she finished her chore she sat
beside him on the blankets. Her nearness kicked sensation through
him. Her face was above him, loosened and heavy; her smiling ceased
and she made a small sound in her throat and lowered herself and
kissed him and drew back to see its effect.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't do that," she said. "I ought to be careful like
other girls. Then you'd think I was modest."</p>

<p>"Can't change what you are," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, what am I?"</p>

<p>"God knows," he said and drew her down. Sometimes the thought
came to him that her appetite was so powerful that it destroyed the
reservations and little modesties and roundabout allures which
other women maintained for the sake of men. This coming against him
with her mouth was as easy and as necessary to her as the drawing
of a breath.</p>

<p>She settled and lay whispering beside him. "I thought maybe if
you were good and tired you'd just take this and let it be what it
is and not make it mysterious."</p>

<p>"You know how it's apt to turn out?"</p>

<p>"Don't always be thinking about things."</p>

<p>"Babies."</p>

<p>"Nobody thinks about that when they want each other."</p>

<p>"Last time&mdash;Oregon City&mdash;I thought about you till
morning."</p>

<p>"I'm glad," she said, and showed her pleasure. Then she said:
"No, you make it too big. Just till you fell asleep." She knew he
had stretched it; that almost clairvoyant realism was in her.
Suddenly she murmured, "Oh, lover, lover," and flung herself
against him, one small explosion of ferocity following another
until she lighted him.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
She lay beside him, looking up to the shadowed ceiling. Her hand
was on his chest and now and then a flurry of affection wakened it
and she patted him and grew still again. She was wide-awake, she
was peaceful and talkative.</p>

<p>"Lot White keeps talking about this earth being pain and
suffering. It wouldn't be if we didn't try to make everything so
important. I don't know about heaven either. Sounds like we're
making something else too big. But I know this." She swung, kissed
him, moved back. "I know that's good, and if it's good, why that's
all there's to it, and why try to make it better by thinking things
that aren't so? Look at Tansy McCormack."</p>

<p>"Don't know&mdash;what about her?"</p>

<p>"She thought Nig Blaine was the only man on earth. Then he died
and she wouldn't eat for days. Six months later she married Rupe
Bond, and they're happy and I don't think she feels anything about
Nig any more. You see? What do you want a woman to be like?"</p>

<p>"Like you."</p>

<p>"I wish I believed it, but I don't. You like my
housewarming?"</p>

<p>"I liked it&mdash;and I like you."</p>

<p>She held up a finger, and measured off a small bit of it with
her other finger. "This much."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it's more."</p>

<p>She ceased smiling, she ceased to be amused. She lifted herself
to an elbow and searched him. "Is it?" she whispered. Her mouth
loosened and she was during that moment almost a homely girl. She
shook her head. "How much more?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that, Edna."</p>

<p>"Almost&mdash;almost. Men don't talk that way when they want a
woman."</p>

<p>"Don't be so sure."</p>

<p>"No, I know. You'd get tired of me, too. You'd get to thinking
again. There's no woman like you want."</p>

<p>"Now who's talking too much?"</p>

<p>"You're funny," she said. "A lot of men would run after me if I
let them. An awful lot have tried&mdash;it'd surprise you if I said
who. I could get married any minute I said so, to all sorts of men.
You think I don't believe nice things. Well, if you'd seen what
I've seen on men's faces, and the lies they've tried to fool me
with...I hate people that try to fool people. I won't say things I
don't believe. If I could, you'd think better of me but I just
can't do it."</p>

<p>He sat up and bent over her. He ran his hand over her forehead,
he traced the edges of her hair; he was close to it, the feeling
rising, the belief growing, the words almost there. She saw it and
waited dead-still. But the impulse stopped somewhere; it couldn't
come freely and he said nothing. As soon as she sensed it she put
his arm aside and got up. "Time to go home." There was nothing in
her words.</p>

<p>"I'll walk through the trees with you."</p>

<p>"No. I'm not afraid. Things don't bother me."</p>

<p>He went with her as far as the timber's edge, but she turned him
back there and went on alone through the blackness.</p>

<p>It was a quarter-mile through this timber, from Burnett's to
Lattimore's, the trail winding around huge trees which, twelve feet
in diameter, had been growing there through the hundreds of years.
The water was beside her, dashing over its shallow rock bed; a
small wind ruffled the boughs far above her, and in this close damp
air the odors of the forest lay heavy. There was no variation to
the dense shadows; all Edna had for a guide was the trail's
yard-wide track in the soft humus, beaten out by Indian feet
generation upon generation. Neither blackness nor animals bothered
her, and the fear of the unknown wasn't in her system, but she had
grown up on the usual Indian tales told by her people&mdash;of
murder, surprise, captivity and torture&mdash;and these made some
effect on her placid imagination; therefore when she heard the
sharp break of a branch directly before her she stopped with strong
fear.</p>

<p>"That you, Edna?"</p>

<p>It was Cal Lockyear's voice, pitched low to reassure her. His
feet lifted slick and sucking sounds from the mud. "You, Edna?" he
asked, closer by.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'll walk through with you."</p>

<p>She said, "How'd you happen to be here?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "I'm a lean hound, always on the run."</p>

<p>"How'd you know it was me?"</p>

<p>"By your footsteps," he said and gave out a short laugh.</p>

<p>"The ground's so soft I made almost no sound," she said
skeptically.</p>

<p>He had a dry answer. "If you'd spent your time sleepin' in
Indian country, you'd sharpened your ears to hear grass rustlin'
two miles off."</p>

<p>She went along the trail before him. Like all women in whom the
sex power is heavily packed, she had a keen sense of the constant
intrigue between men and women, the surreptitious game of chase and
seduction they played. Thus she believed Lockyear to be lying. He
had come here, she decided, because she had at last attracted him
out of his indifference so that he was now running after her. She
had never doubted her ability to bring him around, and suddenly she
was a little scornful of him.</p>

<p>"Go on," she said. "I don't need any protection."</p>

<p>His brief laugh came again. "I said I'd walk through with you,
and so I shall. I can't be handled as easy as Burnett or Moss."</p>

<p>She quickened her pace and said nothing more until the trail
fell into her father's clearing, across which the cabin lamp thrust
a golden bar of light. She turned to him. "You're just talking,"
she said. "You don't know anything about Burnett or Moss."</p>

<p>"Indian country's where I learned to keep my eyes open,
too."</p>

<p>"You're funny," she said.</p>

<p>"You don't like me much."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "you're a hard one. You hurt things."</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "there's hell enough in me." Then he showed a bit
of his underlying truculence. "Who's been telling you stories about
me&mdash;making me out some sort of a damned animal?"</p>

<p>Now that she had him openly interested she grew a little cruel
with him, partly to punish him for his previous indifference and
partly to defend herself against his willfulness. "Oh," she said,
with a touch of mockery, "you're not that wild."</p>

<p>"I'm a damned long way from being as tame as the men you been
running with."</p>

<p>"You don't know what I do, and it's none of your business."</p>

<p>"Know more than you reckon I do," he said. "Like to get a man
stirred up, then knock him down&mdash;that's what you like."</p>

<p>"Don't you get stirred up," she retorted, "and then you'll not
be knocked down."</p>

<p>"I'd not be so easy to stop as the others."</p>

<p>"There'll be no starting, so there's no stopping."</p>

<p>"Then what have you been looking at me for?" he said sharply.
She said nothing but when he leaned forward to catch some sort of a
view of her face he saw that she was smiling to herself. "You don't
know me," he said. "You don't know me at all."</p>

<p>"I know you well enough," she answered promptly. "You like to
make trouble. I mean, you're not kind to other men."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said impatiently, "these dishwater men."</p>

<p>"You're not better than they are," she said promptly.</p>

<p>"Let them try to follow me on hunt, let them stand up to me in a
fight&mdash;we'll see who's the better."</p>

<p>"Fight&mdash;fight," she said. "That's what you think
about."</p>

<p>"Well, by God," he said, "I have stayed alive because I kept my
mind on fighting; your gentlemen, in my shoes, would have been dead
for their easy manners." He was silent and he was dissatisfied, and
stirred and stepped slightly forward to keep his view of her face
in the shadows. "Certainly I'm proud of myself. I have got good
reason to be, for I followed a livin' which kills poor men quick."
Again he was silent, and still not pleased with the way things
stood. "As for being easy with your people&mdash;have they been
easy with me? What family invited me to share its fire or meals on
this trip? Not any. I ain't one of you&mdash;you make that plain.
Lockyear's the greasy trapper; let him alone, let him shift for
himself, keep away from that man."</p>

<p>"More your fault than anybody's," she said. "You've not been
agreeable."</p>

<p>"It's not required that a man should beg his way," he said. "You
people think me no better than a savage, no manners, no talk worth
listening to, no feelings. It amuses me to let you think it. Do you
know why I have no use for your men? Because they are barn-fed
creatures and they've lost the gift to smell, or see, or hear. For
sleeping under a roof they've forgot what the sky looks like or
what comes when you think on it; and for living safe the spirit's
died out of them. No, you don't know me." He stopped speaking, he
drew a long breath, and peered into her quiet face and gave her his
intolerant advice. "Go back to the men you can do what you please
with. You don't know me&mdash;you never would."</p>

<p>She remained still for a while, seeming to reflect on what he
said and afterwards, unexpectedly, she put her hand forward in a
kind of impulsive gesture and touched his arm; and then she laughed
at him. "What's there to know that's so mysterious?" she said, the
mocking manner returned.</p>

<p>He reacted at once; he clapped his hands around her arms and
gave her a rough pull against him, and threw his arms about her
waist with an intemperate squeezing; when he kissed her the
pin-sharp whiskers of his face stung her face and she drew aside
but he lifted a hand and pushed her face back to him in a kind of
cuffing motion and thrust himself against her and increased his
pressure around her until her breath began to draw fast and short;
a short sound in her throat warned him; he released her and gave
her a small shove. "I'm more than the men you've been tinkerin'
with," he said. His tone was guttural with excitement. "If there
was a full-out man in the lot, you'd stay with him, but there's not
and you fool with one and the other. I could teach you what it's
like. Whatever you think it is, I'd teach you it was more." He
sucked in an enormous breath and let it go. "I don't know," he
added, coolly, "I don't know if you've got enough to give back,"
and he turned and entered the trail, immediately vanishing.</p>

<p>She was angry because he had left her before she had sent him
away, and also because this scene, which she had been so certain of
controlling as she wished, had gotten away from her. He had
responded as other men responded, up to a point; beyond that the
surly independence in him had asserted itself and he had defied her
and walked away. She went on to the cabin more and more
dissatisfied with him, yet restless with herself and made
increasingly curious by his final taunt.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Burnett stacked a pile of wood inside the cabin and dragged his
blanket roll near the hearth so that he might keep a slow, even
flame burning against the damp mud of the new fireplace. He brought
up a bucket of fresh water from the creek; it took a great deal of
water to kill the odd cravings which long hours and a limited and
monotonous diet created. He covered the pile of packs with a
tarpaulin and stood in the darkness, listening to the
distance-gentled clank of the bell on the white mare. All the stock
would be feeding close around her. There were cougar aplenty in
this country; he had seen those big cat tracks printed frequently
in the loose mud at the creek's edge, and he thought about the risk
to his animals, and meanwhile let his senses test the night for
rain. The sky was closed out and dim banks of mist hung over the
meadows, but the vagrant wind was from the northwest, directly
opposite the prevailing storm winds. He turned into the cabin,
undressed, laid his rifle handy and rolled the blankets around him
on the hard floor.</p>

<p>She came to him now as she had so many nights before; she
settled warm-flanked beside him, laughing a little, whispering.
This was the imperative reverie of a lone man, flesh's need tangled
through the soul's need so that as he used her he endowed her with
grace. Without grace it was brutal; without flesh it was bloodless.
Lot White would have said that one was evil and the other
perfection, but Lot was wrong, they were not two separate things,
they were parts of one thing and so long as he was alive these
alternate thrusts would have their way; the conflict had been built
into him and he could no more change it than he could chop himself
in halves and live. So she drew him on by the shape of her body, by
the shock of her vitality, by the smiling temptation of her
face.</p>

<p>He heard the scrape of a boot on his threshold and turned his
head to find Lockyear in the doorway's dark square, the firelight
rubbing its rouge stain into the man's cheeks and starting up a
glass bright flashing of his eyes. He was a cat animal prowling,
and the sign of his predatory discontent was all about him. Burnett
rose to an elbow, irritated by the soundlessness of Lockyear's
arrival.</p>

<p>"Next time you come here at night, sing out. Don't play Sioux
with me."</p>

<p>"Sioux was good enough for you once," said Lockyear
indifferently and stepped forward to settle on his heels before the
fire. "Now you're a fat settler snorin' on your back. You're a fool
to leave that door open."</p>

<p>"This is a settlement of white people."</p>

<p>"White or any color, I'd not trust anybody standing yonder in
the dark."</p>

<p>"If you did a day's work," observed Burnett, "you'd get over
this spooking around. Walk off that rock patch you've got up the
creek and find yourself a claim you can farm."</p>

<p>Lockyear spread his hands to the fire and stared steadily at
them. "You think you're going to like scratching holes in the
ground the rest of your life?"</p>

<p>"What's better business?" countered Burnett.</p>

<p>"We're squatted between these ridges like frogs at the bottom of
a well. I've not had a decent breath since I got here&mdash;my
lungs are full of fog. I can't see anything for the timber and
there's no light. It's a damned dull world, it's a country for
gophers. Think a minute of what it looks like on Wind River right
now. Sun's shining and you can see for a hundred miles." He turned
shoulders and head toward Burnett and he said earnestly, "This is
no way for a man to live," and made a sweeping motion with one hand
which seemed to include cabin, settlement and valley.</p>

<p>"What's a better one?" asked Burnett.</p>

<p>"This place will break you before you get it broke," warned
Lockyear. "You'll be a damned old man in five years. You need a
woman to cook, but she'll drive a hard bargain with you. She'll tie
you with a wedding ring and load you with ten kids and you'll not
be free to pick up your gun and roam a hundred miles for the fun of
it." He struck a hand across his thigh with an odd impatience and
murmured, "God damn these white women, they'll have their way. They
wring a man dry and trap him with work; then what's left of him?
Squaws are better&mdash;they let a man stay a man. There's your
white settlement, kids to raise and cows to milk and fences to keep
up, and cabin broke men, and women that have got things their own
way."</p>

<p>"Go find your squaw then," said Burnett.</p>

<p>Lockyear said in the gentlest tone, "God damn these settlers and
all their kind." Changeable humors played over his face and he rose
and looked down on Burnett with his half interest and his half
intolerance. "Think you'll stick it out?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you next spring," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"That business of you siding with Hawn&mdash;I didn't take that
well. Next time, don't do it."</p>

<p>"Next time," said Burnett, "I'll do as I please. You know that,
Cal."</p>

<p>Lockyear turned to the doorway and passed through it and swung
back. He stared a steady moment at Burnett, dry and tense and
preoccupied, and he had something to say; but finally he stepped
aside and vanished in the dark with no further comment.</p>

<p>Burnett turned on his blankets, listening for Lockyear's steps
but hearing no sound of them; and he knew enough about Lockyear to
realize that the man would tramp the trail with an increasing
unrest, at the mercy of one of those storms of discontent which
swept through him at regular intervals&mdash;the same kind of
discontent which, in mild or furious form, was the common misery of
everybody.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16</h2>

<p>GAY had built a pit outside the cabin, in which a deep bed of
coals, three days' burning, had accumulated; and over the pit he
had erected a scaffolding of poles from which hung the butchered
chunks of half a dozen deer. Over the fire too hung Martha Gay's
largest iron kettle&mdash;her soapmaking kettle&mdash;filled to the
brim with potatoes boiling with their jackets on. On a three-day
trip to the French settlement along the Willamette, Harris Eby had
picked up the potatoes, several sacks of onions and half a
wagonload of squashes. Wanting a community meeting to discuss
roads, among many other problems, Gay had sent out word of the
feed, knowing there would be no absentees.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon. Gram had a basting pan and a jug of meat
sauce&mdash;onions and flour and salt and pepper and
water&mdash;and as she turned the meat she ladled the sauce on each
chunk and caught the drippings in the pan. Now and then she tore a
sliver from one chunk or another to test the doneness.</p>

<p>Martha Gay came from the cabin. "Pity we've not got flour enough
for bread, or butter, or pickles, or that damson jelly I made so
much of and left in the old cellar for the new owner's woman." The
memory of it deepened the fretful lines of her face. "Have we got
enough? It's such a lot of people. I wonder if he sent word to the
Lockyears? I hate those men; but Gay&mdash;his heart's like a barn
door, always open...I hope that meat gets done. I won't have Nellie
Lattimore making remarks."</p>

<p>Accustomed to these moments of irritation, Gram sometimes
scarcely heard Martha Gay's words and said nothing now. Gram was
small, weighing little more than a hundred pounds, but she was one
of those people whose vitality would go on and on, outlasting the
personal satisfactions of living or hope of reward or fear of
death, until one day she would turn her mind about and actually
kill herself by ceasing to wish to live. In the tireless way of an
old person, she rose early, found work to keep her moving and at
dark lay abed to think of the past, her memory an attic trunk
crowded with the miscellany of seventy years' living; names,
incidents, the ring of certain voices, the sight of the first dead
face she had seen, the odor of lilac in a room whose identity she
had forgotten, phrases spoken, a boy's hand creeping over her and
the excitement and guilt printed on his face, her third son's body
lying smashed after the horse had killed him, the velvet sensation
of summer's deep dust on her bare feet, the scream of a girl in
Turner's woods, the sound of Sunday's church bells, the flash of
Simon Burke's eyes across the dance hall to her after she was
married&mdash;a confusion of such things lay in the trays of her
mind; mostly the sentiment was gone from them, but once in a while
she touched something still powerful enough to stir her and then
she worked through her day in absent-minded silence. She was close
to only two people.</p>

<p>For the Old Man she had an ancient wife's mixture of affection
and irritability. They were two old horses teamed, sometimes
scarcely able to abide each other, yet so long accustomed to the
pairing that they were lost when alone. More than once he had
failed her, the original heartache of that failure severe but now
of no importance, and long ago she had discovered that her original
faith in him was only girlhood dreaming, for as the years rolled on
he had settled into his obscure place of no great force, actually
insignificant. What held them together was their sharing of things
which meant nothing to anybody else; when one died the other would
be lost in a foreign world.</p>

<p>She paused from her work to look out upon the plowed field
beyond the cabin. In the gray light of late afternoon four figures
moved over the field at spaced intervals casting wheat
seed&mdash;John Gay, young Joe, the Old Man and Katherine. The
field was rough and wet, but neither John Gay nor the other
settlers dared to wait longer on the seeding; and the four, trying
to keep steady pace for an even cast of grain, hauled their
mud-clogged feet along like iron boots. The Old Man was tired; Gram
watched his shoulders and watched the way he flung his arms, and
sent a silent message to him: You come back.</p>

<p>Four people filed from the timber beyond the meadow, the first
to respond to John Gay's call, and at sight of them Katherine swung
from her work and moved toward the cabin. She was good as a man at
almost any sort of rough chore, but she was woman enough not to
want people to see her dirty. Such real affection as was left in
the old woman was reserved for this girl. The strong salts of
Gram's disposition had been inherited by Katherine. Martha was
mild, she was worried over small things, she believed everything
other people believed&mdash;she was one of the soft ones; but
Katherine belonged to the other kind, to the rough ones. There were
only two kinds of people, in Gram's judgment: those who did what
they wanted to do and made no bones about it, and those who were
afraid to act and afraid of the consequences after they acted.</p>

<p>Katherine wore an old dress spattered with mud, a heavy sweater
and a pair of her father's shoes round as cannon balls with the
clinging loam. Work and damp air reddened her cheeks, her eyes had
bright blue shining, her light hair was tumbled on her head and at
the moment she reminded Gram of one of those bulky, fair-featured
German immigrant girls who had come into Iowa in earlier years.
There was a difference; most of those girls were placid, whereas
there was nothing placid in Katherine. She lifted the seed sack
from her shoulders and stood by the fire.</p>

<p>Gram said: "Who's that comin'? I can't see from here."</p>

<p>"Lattimores."</p>

<p>"Edna, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'm surprised she didn't wait to tag along with Burnett. You
need to wash&mdash;fix up your hair. You look like a hired
man."</p>

<p>The Lattimores came on, and elsewhere, out of the timber and
over the roundabout meadows, other people began to appear. The Gay
men made their last round of the wheat field and returned, and the
Gay yard took on something of the cheerful spirit of the trail.
Moving about her chores, Gram watched these people grow warm as
they touched each other again.</p>

<p>They were tired with the steady labor of two weeks, they had
their worries, and the climate had not been kind; it was worse on
the women than on the men; the women showed the grinding-down
caused by their incessant chores and by the monotony and
loneliness. It was in the pinched expression around their mouths,
in their higher tone of voice, in their nervous, restless motions.
But the meeting calmed them. For the women it was the chance to
talk&mdash;and their talk ran around the yard in swirling little
gusts of sound, exclamatory, incomplete and running on and on as if
some dam in their minds had burst. For the men, it was talk too, a
slower talk; but it was also the smell of food and, for the younger
men, it was the presence of the girls.</p>

<p>Gay had doweled long split logs on trestles, thus making a
table; and the visiting women brought what they could spare from
their small stores, a bit of relish, a jar of preserves, a pan of
bread. Mrs. Rinearson, having swapped a string of cheap beads for
dried huckleberries from a passing squaw, came to the meeting with
ten huckleberry pies; the rough table began to have a picnic
appearance. Gay and Eby carved the venison, laying up mounds of
meat in various pans; the potatoes were drained and the huge kettle
laid at one end of the table; the coffeepot stood at the other. Gay
lifted his voice:</p>

<p>"Now here it is! Come and get it or I'll throw it away."</p>

<p>Men moved to the table at once, using dishes their own women had
brought; the women were slower to come, having more pride in the
matter of showing their hunger before other women. Gram Gay
collected the little dibs and dabs of coffee brought by the
families, and threw them into another pot of boiling water,
meanwhile observing the crowd with her greedy interest. Katherine,
changed into a clean dress and shoes, moved among the women, just
talking her way along to find out what had happened to them and how
they'd been; and when she came upon Edna Lattimore, Gram's
following glance saw at once the contrast between the two girls.
The trip over the plains had pulled Katherine down; she wasn't
thin, yet against Edna she seemed thin. Gram, a rock-bottom
realist, had no doubt that it would be Edna men looked upon first;
she was the feather bed in which they wanted to lie. It took a
little longer to see what Katherine had.</p>

<p>She found more joy in watching the scene than meat could have
given her. Ralph Whitcomb rode in with the first shadows and went
around shaking hands; he flattered Gram with his attention. "You'll
live to be a hundred and ten. They don't make people like you any
more." Afterwards, as he walked about, Gram noticed him search the
crowd&mdash;for Lucy, Gram understood.</p>

<p>It was full dark and the men had gathered in a wide circle
around the fire to discuss roads when Burnett arrived. She had
never seen the man look so tired; he walked to the stripped table
and stood by it a moment, as though his mind were somewhere else;
and then Katherine came from the group of women and paused beside
him; she said something to him and gave him her smile, and Gram saw
him look upon Katherine with an extended thoughtfulness. Presently
he answered her, returning her smile. Katherine turned and got a
plate and began to hunt him a meal. She was reserved&mdash;not like
Edna; she didn't show Burnett a thing.</p>

<p>Gram turned her wandering attention now to John Gay. His
shoulders were round with their weariness and the angles of his
face bones were sharp across his face. Even in the firelight there
was a shadow, like the shadow of a cross on him&mdash;and Gram
closed her eyes and felt a chill go through her; there was death on
him, there was death in his voice.</p>

<p>Powerfully it came to her, powerfully she conjured the feeling
into prophecy. She opened her eyes to see what real thing might
have cast the shadow, and found the shadow gone. She thought,
"It'll come three times." She crossed the yard and circled the
cabin until she was in the darkness, and she stood there and let
the superstitions of her nature have their way, the haunted
currents coming out of nowhere and everywhere, the witchery moving,
the evil conjunction of stars and moon and earth.</p>

<p>That wheat won't grow. Everybody'll quarrel tonight. She thought
of thirteens and sevens and threes. Six deer on the spit&mdash;two
sets of threes.</p>

<p>It might be that. Wheat field and wrong moon&mdash;it might be
that. Somebody could have walked around the cabin too many times? A
bird had flown inside the cabin two days ago. She had stepped on a
snail last night.</p>

<p>She stirred and felt a small rock underneath her shoe, and she
picked it up and turned into the cabin and laid it on the bed in
which John Gay slept. Rock could soak up evil, if it were the right
kind of rock. But it was too late, the sign had appeared; it was
too late&mdash;he would die.</p>

<p>John Gay said: "Well, folks, it's good to get together again. I
been a little lonely to sit around with everybody again and hear
some good lies."</p>

<p>"Where'd you get them spuds?" asked Lattimore.</p>

<p>"French people over by the river."</p>

<p>"Hell of a long distance to go for spuds."</p>

<p>Jackson Monteith said: "We'll go farther for grub before the
winter's done."</p>

<p>Gay let the talk go aimlessly on for a while. Men lay close to
the fire; they knelt or stood in the background. Somebody said,
"Where's your fiddle, Billy?" Billy Lord shook his head. Ben
Provost said, "I hear there's some wild cattle around here, strayed
from Ewing Young's place a long time back. Anybody seen any?"</p>

<p>"No, by God, but I hope I do."</p>

<p>Moses Crabtree said, "I came here to get rid of fever and ague,
but I still got it. Anybody else got it?"</p>

<p>"The old stuff's still in your system," said Whitcomb. "It'll
burn out next summer. Or it may be your belly. How've you been
eating?"</p>

<p>"Damned poorly," said Moses Crabtree, and set the crowd into
laughter. John Gay sensed the ease around him and brought the
meeting to its business.</p>

<p>"We ought to talk about a few things. Some things ain't timely
and will wait, but we ought to be thinking about them anyhow.
There's a marshal for all this country, but he's at Oregon City,
and we ought to think about making a county and electing a sheriff.
We have got to think about a school. None of these kids have been
in one since last spring. We ought to talk about roads. Not the
little ones leading into our places&mdash;the main one to go
through the settlement."</p>

<p>Ben Lattimore shook his head and came right in with his
objection. "Now, wait, John. You're hell-for-leather to put a load
on us. What's a sheriff for, when nobody's goin' to shoot anybody?
The schools&mdash;let them that have kids build the school. I have
got no kids for school. As for roads, let's just keep the plan of
wild animals. They just walk back and forth the easiest way and
pretty soon they've got a road."</p>

<p>"That's fine, Ben, but if we all decide on the place for a road,
we'll waste no labor. Don't know about you, but I'm an old horse
and I can't be spending wind on false starts. I ain't got that much
wind."</p>

<p>"No," said Lattimore, "it just sounds like settin' up some more
gover'ment, some more expenses. It's the start of taxes again, damn
it, and I didn't come two thousand miles to saddle myself with
taxes. I came to get away from 'em."</p>

<p>"As for me," countered Gay, "I didn't come here to run away from
taxes or sheriffs or schools, or anything people ought to have. I
was born inside a government and I expect to die inside one. You
can't throw things away, Ben. We're not Indians."</p>

<p>"Well, by God, they ain't got sheriffs and taxes."</p>

<p>"And they ain't got anything else, either," said Gay. "It's a
poor argument. You don't intend to squat in the mud and itch fleas
like they do."</p>

<p>"I'll build my own floor and I'll take my own bath. Don't expect
anybody to do it for me, don't expect to do it for anybody
else."</p>

<p>Daniel Rinearson, listening in, suddenly pounced on Lattimore.
"The hell you'll build your own floor. You had help on it, like the
rest."</p>

<p>"I could of done it alone," said Lattimore stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Now," said Rinearson, "don't argue yourself into a corner
you're too stubborn to get out of. We're all wheat dumped in one
sack. We got to keep the sack sewed tight or we spill out."</p>

<p>"What's schools got to do with that?" countered Lattimore.</p>

<p>"Let's just talk about roads," said Gay, in his reasonable tone.
"If we all go to cuttin' trees and diggin' stumps in the wrong
places, we'll get nowhere. Better to think where we want the main
road to be and all work on it as the occasions come. Where should
it be?"</p>

<p>Cal Lockyear stood at the outer edge of the circle, present but
scarcely a part of the crowd; his brother, shadowlike as ever,
stood near him. Lockyear had come late, hadn't eaten with the
crowd, and seemed to hold himself aside from it. His voice went
roughly at Gay. "You're askin' where should the road be when we've
not decided we need one. What do we want a road for? We got here on
a piece of a road. A piece of a road goes stragglin' through the
settlement. What more do you need?"</p>

<p>Ben Lattimore nodded. "That's what I said." Then he looked
around to Lockyear and his expression turned and he seemed unhappy
with Lockyear's company in the matter. He caught Ryal McIver's eye
and shook his head.</p>

<p>"A piece of road it is," said Gay. "And a damned poor piece. It
took four days to come here on it. That's too much. We ought to
bridge the creeks. We ought to do a little grubbing on the
hillsides. We should knock down some trees."</p>

<p>"What's your hurry?" said Lockyear. "Where we going?"</p>

<p>"Straight down to hell in the mud if we don't do something about
it. When the wheat's in and the cabins are floored and chinked
we'll have time on our hands. It's better to start these things or
they never get done."</p>

<p>He stooped at the fire to light his pipe. Having expressed his
own view, he was wise enough not to press it for a little while,
for he had gone through this business times enough to know how
opinions were formed when men got together. The core of any crowd
was common sense, self-interest and a tendency to do the right
thing&mdash;these elements, loosely blended. He was old enough to
know that men talked somewhat better than they performed; they had
a Sunday suit of good intentions which they liked to wear in
public, but when the chores got burdensome they frequently put on
the shabbier jeans of indifference. What had to be watched for was
the unintentional offense which might put some perfectly good men
on the wrong side of the fence, out of injured pride; what also had
to be watched for was too great shock to that selfishness which all
men had and which could waver them from the standard of public
necessity. In each crowd there were some men who stood fast to
reason, some who sought some personal gain, some who objected to
any program because of an ingrained principle of resistance in
them, and a great many who would listen and at last go along with
what seemed to be the prevailing sentiment. It was a matter of
steering a course through the divergent personalities before him,
and it required some skill. Gay had enormous faith in the
rock-bottom decency of his neighbors; he believed devoutly in the
shirt-sleeve system and, as a product of that system, he could
neither understand nor like any other system. As his neighbors did,
he depreciated the need for leaders and he subscribed to the notion
that though men might vary greatly in capacity, they took on a sort
of God-endowed equality in the matter of making public decisions;
then, the foolish, the illiterate, the selfish and the able stood
on equal ground, all equally endowed with wisdom for the voting
moment. Had the proposition been put to him, Gay would
unhesitatingly have preferred government by a thousand fools to
government by one wise man; for at least the thousand fools would
be speaking the common wish, whereas the wise man would be speaking
only for himself. He would have explained it by saying that if the
thousand wanted to go to hell in their own style, that was their
privilege; but that it was certainly not the privilege of one man
to lead them to heaven against their desires. Yet though he
subscribed devoutly to this theory, his practical streak would not
permit him to stand by while the foolish had their way. By instinct
rather than by reason he felt that a shirt-sleeve order carried the
two streams of redemption and destruction side by side and that it
was the duty of good men to reason with the foolish and temper the
prejudice of the ignorant and the selfish; thus in a society which
disliked authority and distrusted leaders, he was one of those
unwitting minor leaders which such a society thrusts up to protect
itself against the farthest limits of its own theory.</p>

<p>He renewed his argument. "If we get a main road through here
before somebody starts it somewhere else, we'll see a little town
grow at the ford. It's better for us to have it there than ride
twenty miles to somebody else's town. It'll give value to our
claims." Then in mild manner he asked his question again. "Where
ought the road to go?"</p>

<p>Collingwood discovered Whitcomb across the circle. He moved past
the fire, shook hands with a quick turning-on of his cordiality.
"Lucy's not well. I wonder could you drop in and see her a
minute?"</p>

<p>"Come along," said Whitcomb.</p>

<p>"I'd like to stay here and talk this out with the boys," said
Collingwood. "It's directly up the creek, first cabin this side of
the ford."</p>

<p>Whitcomb looked into the man's rather handsome face, and thought
to himself, <i>You're a damned fool</i>. But he said aloud, "I'll
go see her," and moved toward his horse. Riding into the darkness
he hoped his eagerness hadn't shown; the wish to see her was so
powerful that he had a guilty man's fear that even his thoughts
were visible.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>WHEN he saw the light of her cabin shining a hundred yards
distant along the creek he began to feel the mixture of
embarrassment and eagerness he hadn't experienced since boyhood. At
that time this surge and urgence had been shot through with
reveries of the ideal, and passion transmuted into the beauty of
one constant lifelong love. It was, he thought, perhaps the
high-water mark of a man's imagination that capacity of making the
perfect blend of body and spirit. Now that he was older, the
terrible skepticism of experience came in to unsteady the things he
thought about Lucy. He was hungry for a woman. He was poaching
after another man's wife. Strip it down and what else was it? A
jury of twelve men he most respected would have shaken their heads
at him; or perhaps, being men, they would have laughed at him and
told him to go hunt his peach in a less dangerous orchard. It was
against his wishes and against his training but it was happening to
him and there seemed no sort of reasoning or moral judgment he
could use to stop it. He had passed the point of wanting to stop
it.</p>

<p>He left the horse and knocked at the door and heard her say,
"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Whitcomb. Your husband said you were sick." Then he added, "He
asked me to come."</p>

<p>There was a moment's delay, and then she said, "Come in."</p>

<p>She stood with her back to the fire in a gray rough dress
against which a gold locket made a small point of light. Her hair
was loose, coming to a tie at the back of her neck, pulled together
carelessly as a girl might have done it. She had her hands behind
her and she looked across to him with her chin lifted, manner
grave. He thought she seemed less ill than disinterested.</p>

<p>"You always manage to find me," she said, "when I'm a poor
sight." Then a smile destroyed whatever dullness or hint of poor
health she might have had. "It's so good to see you, but I wish
George would quit making me out an invalid."</p>

<p>"Maybe he's concerned."</p>

<p>"Let him wait till there's cause for it. I do my work." She took
the coffeepot from a corner table, spilled hot water into it from
the crane kettle and added coffee and set the pot into the
fire.</p>

<p>"You'd better hoard that stuff," he said. "Long time till
spring."</p>

<p>"So long as it lasts I'll have it for visiting doctors." She had
her back to him at the moment and he sensed some sort of waiting in
her. The silence pulled at him to finish what was unfinished.</p>

<p>"Then there's apt to be a doctor around here pretty often," he
said.</p>

<p>She turned about and again put her hands behind her back. Her
chin rose; he made out the working of excitement within her, the
moment's tenseness of her body. Her voice was pleasant to hear,
level but slightly hurried. "I think that will be nice."</p>

<p>He motioned for her hand and took it and settled his fingers on
her pulse; and meanwhile he found satisfaction in watching her
eyes. They were a heavier blue than Katherine Gay's, almost a
gray-black. Her pulse was faster than it should have been. "Lie on
the bed a few minutes," he said.</p>

<p>Her smile came back. "Oh, I've been turning and stooping."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless..." he said, and waited while she settled on the
bed. "Feel stronger than a week ago?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. How strong am I supposed to feel? I don't
know."</p>

<p>"Sleep all right?"</p>

<p>"When I get to sleep."</p>

<p>"What keeps you awake?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she said half in laughter, "what a question! You've got no
medicine for people who watch ceilings. Anyhow, I'm healthy. It's a
good thing to lie awake at night. It's about the only time when
anybody's alone. I've got a solitary streak in me. I like to go
away off by myself now and then where nobody can find me. You know
about that? Sometimes, people, people&mdash;people...they get to be
too much. Maybe I'm queer."</p>

<p>She was relaxed, she was grave. "We've all lived too crowded on
this trip, so close together that at night times it seems to me we
were all lying in one big bed, snoring together, sweating together,
doing the most intimate things together. It's not good when you see
somebody look at you and you know he knows everything about you;
and you know everything about him. There were times on the trail
when I could hear so much from the next wagon that I cringed. I
even know the words Ben Provost uses on his wife when he loves
her."</p>

<p>"You tell George this?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. She said, "George never gets enough of
people. I could have gone to the meeting tonight, but the thought
of staying home alone seemed awfully good."</p>

<p>"Maybe," he said, "I ought to get out and leave you to your
solitude."</p>

<p>Her fingers curled back on his hand and remained with a moment
of pressure; a softening expression moved over her face. "You stay
right here." Then she shook her head. "That's not exactly what a
female patient should do to a doctor." She rose, murmuring, "The
coffee's ready," and set a pair of cups on the table and poured
coffee, and found sugar and spoons. She had her back to him. "Other
women have tried that with you, haven't they?"</p>

<p>"That coffee smells good."</p>

<p>"But they have," she said.</p>

<p>He sat down to the table. She took a place opposite, crowding
her body into a rounded comfortable position. She laid her arms on
the table. "I guess they've poured everything out to you, one time
or another."</p>

<p>"I guess they have."</p>

<p>"Petty things, terrible things, things real, things imagined.
Are the stories all different?"</p>

<p>"Variations of the same few things."</p>

<p>"That makes me seem more like others." She sipped at her coffee;
her velvet glance came over the cup's rim. "What things?"</p>

<p>He made a tumbling gesture with both hands. He had a large chest
and shoulders, with a first showing of extra flesh of the middle
age he was coming upon, and his hair had some gray at the base of
the sideburns. His profession had given him its particular manner
of listening, half personal, half detached. To Lucy, who had a
romantic imagination, it often seemed that he must have had an
unfortunate love affair, for behind his settled kindness she sensed
an ardent disposition, a love of the colored and fanciful; and on
his face, particularly about his mouth, she noted a taste for the
good things of living. Experience had made him kind; only
occasionally did she see anything disturb the kindness, this a
quick flashing-out from his eyes of an accumulated unrest with
himself and other people. So then he had moods in which he was
sharp, perhaps even cruel, in his judgment.</p>

<p>He looked up from the table. "I believe we were meant to give,
and to receive. When there's not enough given out and not enough
taken in, we're cheated. I think there's no complete happiness
unless we're altogether absorbed by somebody else and we've
absorbed them."</p>

<p>"It doesn't happen much."</p>

<p>"Which is why I make a living by tapping sick bellies."</p>

<p>"I think you've put on weight."</p>

<p>"I'm living in better style. I've got a house and a woman to
cook. I'm not rushed with work. This is good coffee."</p>

<p>"I'm a good cook."</p>

<p>He put down the empty cup; he looked into it. "And a good
wife."</p>

<p>She rose from the table, turning from him toward the fire for
the coffeepot; but she became still, arms wrapped across her
breasts. There was strain in her, for he saw the pressure of her
fingers against her sleeves and the same strain got hold of him.
The critical fragment in his head told him that this was an opening
maneuver in an old game, but it didn't matter. He had the feeling
of being young again&mdash;the same heated images returning, the
same formless wishes, the beautiful pictures, the desire to
possess, to hurt, to pour out. It was all back.</p>

<p>She said quietly: "I didn't say that. I'm not sure George would
say it."</p>

<p>Now he thought he saw half an opening, but he was awkward and
lacked the courage to take the step; much as he wanted her, he
couldn't manage it and for an instant he despised the luggage of
propriety and self-analysis which stopped him from performing this
simplest and most direct act of a man. So he stood silent.</p>

<p>She swung, her returning smile quickened by an awareness of the
thing moving between them. It took the indifference from her; it
made her feel good. If he judged her rightly, it had been a long
time since her husband had troubled himself to go through the
extended niceties of love-making with her; and no doubt she had
earlier learned what the wagon train people had discovered about
his character, so that affection was pretty much dead between them.
Her eyes, with so much aliveness in them, were beautiful; her face
was expressive. She was amused, she shook her head. "Oh,
Ralph&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. It's funny."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it's not a damned bit funny."</p>

<p>She moved around the table and laid a hand on his arm. "I didn't
mean it that way. Have I hurt your feelings?"</p>

<p>He thought to himself, I'm thirty-nine and acting like a fool
boy.</p>

<p>He found humor in it, and the rankling instant vanished. "No,"
he said, smiling.</p>

<p>"You know I'd hate it if I did. Things are so mixed up."</p>

<p>He turned from the cabin and got his saddlebags and came back,
and found her staring at him with a changed expression, solemn. He
opened the saddlebags on the table, found a bottle and shook out a
dozen pills.</p>

<p>"I want you to take one of these each night when you go to
bed."</p>

<p>She said: "You left the room so abruptly. I thought you were
going away without saying a word."</p>

<p>"I guess I had my mind on the pills."</p>

<p>"You were a little bit angry."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You can't hide things. It was there. Please be
gentle&mdash;please be."</p>

<p>He left the pills on the table and put the bottle back and
buckled the saddlebag. It came again. His heart beat quicker and he
thought, Now&mdash;right now. In her eyes was that peculiar
obscurity which so often came to women at the end of their
emotional tether. He stepped forward, meaning to take her. What
stopped him, more surely than a club across his head, was the
slightest expression of dread which seemed to stain the expectancy,
as though she had drifted beyond her restraint and was at his
mercy. She could have done nothing more effective.</p>

<p>"I'll make a try at it," he said. "I think I'd better get out of
here."</p>

<p>Her manner grew impersonal and a coolness came from her and he
became uneasy with the feeling he had failed to do what she had
expected. She said: "One pill each night." She counted the pills.
"That's twelve nights. Then what?"</p>

<p>"I'll be back," he said. He took up the saddlebags and moved to
the door.</p>

<p>"Ralph."</p>

<p>He turned to find her smiling. He had somehow gotten adrift in
the crosscurrents of feeling but she understood them and was sure
of herself.</p>

<p>She said: "What kind of a cook have you got?"</p>

<p>"A good cook," he said. He looked closely at her. "She's
fifty-five," he said&mdash;and suddenly they were both laughing and
the air was clear again. "You know," he said, "I'm a clumsy
man."</p>

<p>"Ralph, think well of me. Please&mdash;always do."</p>

<p>"Sometime I've got to tell you what I think."</p>

<p>She looked down, she moved one hand idly across the other; in a
moment she lifted her head. "All right," she murmured, and he felt
she had made up her mind. "Sometime," she added, and sent him from
the cabin with that deferred promise.</p>

<p>He rode toward Gay's in a strange mood. He was angry at himself
for not seizing the opportunity he thought he had seen; the
cautions in his nature had got the best of him, as they so often
did. Then this sober reflecdon was chased away by the exultation
which came of knowing that she had responded. It was a young man's
intoxication all over again, the great well-being, the fancies
shooting off in all directions, the senses wide open to the
goodness of the night and its flavors, the desire to sing, to
shout, to spill out. His realism whispered that this too was the
old reaction to chase and conquest, but he would not believe it and
he rode on alternately rising and falling to the mood. He was in
love with her.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter 18</h2>

<p>DANIEL RINEARSON said: "Take the trail the Indians made. Widen
it, and you've got a good road with the least amount of work. It
should come past Billy Lord's, same as now. All you need on that
slope is some zigzag grading. It ought to cross the creek at Mrs.
Irish's. That makes it right in the middle of everybody in this
part of the settlement. We ought to put a bridge there. Then it
should go right through the notch valley, pass my place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's the coon in the brush," said Elam Walker. "You're
damned big-hearted where this road ought to go till it gets down
your way. Then you want it right past your place. That leaves me a
mile off the road, and you right on it."</p>

<p>"I'm only figuring the work we'd have to do on a new road," said
Old Daniel with his best show of reasonableness.</p>

<p>"And throw a mile of road building on my shoulders," said
Elam.</p>

<p>"All right," said Old Daniel, "let's all pitch in to help you
build your side road. It would still be less work than swinging the
main road."</p>

<p>"That ain't what you're thinkin' about," pointed out Walker. "A
claim on the main road has got value. My claim, a mile off the main
road, won't have much value. That's what you want. Well, I don't
see it."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking of the others," protested Rinearson.</p>

<p>"Let's just do that," said Walker. "There's Kitchen. He'd be
closer to a new road than to the old one. Ain't that so,
Kitchen?"</p>

<p>Kitchen, not a firm man, found it an embarrassing matter to be
caught between two personalities. "Well," he said, "it might be. I
never stepped it off. Depends on where the new road goes, don't
it?"</p>

<p>"Fifty-fifty," said Rinearson. "You won't gain or lose, one way
or the other."</p>

<p>"Probably so," said Kitchen.</p>

<p>"All right," said Elam Walker, "there's Purroy. What you think?"</p>

<p>"Swing it up the creek a quarter-mile, and I'll be pleased," said
Purroy.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," said Rinearson, "you can't wrestle a way by
that hill. Be a damned mudslide in wintertime."</p>

<p>"You got an answer for everything," said Elam Walker.</p>

<p>"Now, men," said Rinearson, "let us raise our sights above what
might be best for any one man and think what would be best for
all."</p>

<p>That caught the crowd's humor and a quiet laughter went around.
Rinearson spread his feet and shoved his head forward&mdash;a
stubborn little man, penny-grasping as everybody knew, foxy in the
maneuvering of things toward himself. His face was like nothing so
much as a piece of baked wood split by countless small crisscross
seams. His eyes were very small, quick in their roundabout
searching; he was good-natured, infinitely sly, profane, a hard
trader; he was a dirt-common man grown wealthy because he schemed
where other men grew tired of it; but though he schemed and took
delight in skinning a man, he also made it a point to keep his word
and could laugh at his bad luck if a smarter man skinned him. If
others sometimes resented his wealth, it was also a fact that they
admired his shrewdness more; in a society of hardshells he was
harder than the rest.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it's true."</p>

<p>Elam Walker would not be sidetracked. "I'll tell you something
else true. Be damned if I work on a road for your benefit. Either
it's for the rest of us or you build your own road."</p>

<p>Collingwood had done somewhat less talking than usual, for the
issue was not one on which all were agreed, and his instincts shied
away from unpopular argument; it occurred to him now that there was
a shift away from Rinearson and he thought he saw an opportunity to
show his common-sense quality and his ability as a diplomat. "Well,
there's two sides to everything. Daniel wants it favorable to him,
and that's nothing against him, and Elam's got a point too. Why
wouldn't it be a good idea to split the difference&mdash;put the
road through that little pass, then swing it halfway between
Daniel's and Elam's places?"</p>

<p>Walker stared at him. "What the hell good's a road that goes
nowhere and passes nobody?"</p>

<p>Old Daniel said: "We'd <i>both</i> have to build side roads to
it, and so would everybody else!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Gay, "let's have a vote on this&mdash;just among
the men living beyond the ford. Those for the old road..."</p>

<p>There were fourteen in that district. Rinearson had his three
sons and Ebbett with him in the vote; the rest of the neighbors
were against him. Kitchen, sensing the majority, joined it as a
matter of comfort.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Elam Walker to Rinearson, "you won't go along
with us, not gettin' your way."</p>

<p>Rinearson shook his head. "You're dead wrong on the road. You'll
have something stragglin' like a snake with the bellyache all over
the hillslope, the damnedest roundabout thing you ever saw, full of
bad grades, mudholes and stumps. You fellows think I was scratchin'
my back and so I was, but so were you. But we got to have a road
and if the majority's for this one, I'm for it because I'm no fence
jumper, which is more than I can say for you, Elam, and to hell
with you."</p>

<p>"All right," said Walker, feeling generous with his victory.
"It's all right."</p>

<p>Ben Provost said: "Should be another road straight up and down
the creek."</p>

<p>"That's the easier thing," said Gay. "It's mostly level and if
every man will brush it out across his own claim and scrape it a
little, the thing's done."</p>

<p>Cal Lockyear, long silent, spoke up. "I'm three miles beyond
anybody. Don't I get any help, or is this lodge closed?"</p>

<p>"It's your corn if you settled to hell and gone back in the
hills," said Lorenzo Buck.</p>

<p>Lockyear shouldered men aside and came into the circle; he
approached Buck. "Who you proposin' to dress down with that tongue
of yours? God damn you, don't talk that way to me."</p>

<p>Buck said in surprise, "What riles you?"</p>

<p>"Don't give me your advice. Don't ever do it."</p>

<p>Buck, growing on toward middle age, was the mildest of men. He
had made his remark casually, using the common talk of his
neighbors. All the argument had been in the same vein, heated and
sometimes rough but not vindictive. This was something else again,
this growling man ready to make a personal quarrel of it. Buck
couldn't match Lockyear in a fight, yet he couldn't pass over the
way Lockyear went at him. He held his voice on its diplomatic
level. "You've got no reason to be riled, Cal. Your temper's too
touchy."</p>

<p>"It's mine, not yours, and watch out for it," said Lockyear. He
swung to face the crowd with his air of unruly intolerance. "You'll
help anybody, but not me. Well, to hell with you."</p>

<p>"There was no offense intended," said John Gay.</p>

<p>Lockyear gave Gay the raking edge of his eyes; he laughed at
Gay. He threw back his head, silently challenging the men around
him, and had no takers. A good rough and tumble fight they didn't
mind; but Lockyear's vindictiveness, with all its consequences, was
another thing.</p>

<p>John Gay, however, felt impelled to give an older man's advice.
"Cal," he said, "you've got some notions of the rest of us. It's
your business if you want to think that way but it's not your
business to let that temper run wild around here."</p>

<p>"Let somebody take it up," said Lockyear promptly.</p>

<p>"That's not it. We have got to live together and there can't be
bad blood. I'll be damned if I make out why you figure your pride's
such a tender thing. You're no better than the rest of us. It
sounds to me like this Southern honor business, and I had a
bellyful of that in Missouri. By God, Cal, you can't go rummaging
around the settlement like a wild bull, hooking your horns into us
at your pleasure. Think it over."</p>

<p>"Let someone stop me," said Cal, and laughed. "There's your rub:
nobody wants to." He nodded toward his brother and the two wandered
toward the table and stopped to feed there on the scraps.</p>

<p>Rice Burnett had earlier moved to the table for coffee; propped
against it, he watched shapes move around the yard. The fire threw
a red half-light over the people; the sound of women's voices and
the sound of men's voices moved through the night in two
layers&mdash;rumbling undertone and quick, nervous overtone. Edna
Lattimore's smile came across the yard to him and passed to Moss
Rinearson, who walked toward her. For Moss or for him, the smile
was the same, and a ragged irritation moved through him and
unexpectedly he realized he was angry at her. He watched her
teasing way with Moss; he watched Moss respond to it.</p>

<p>The Lockyears came toward him and Cal said: "You know anybody
that wants to educate me?"</p>

<p>"It would be a chore," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"A damned long one," said Lockyear.</p>

<p>"Short one," said Burnett. "You and I take education about the
same way. A quick hole through the head."</p>

<p>Lockyear let go with a rough laugh and helped himself to coffee.
He wanted trouble. Mildness kept most men within bounds; Lockyear's
extra energy tossed him farther out to extremes. "Who'll pull the
trigger? Not any of these country lads. You heard me offer a fight.
Nobody took it."</p>

<p>"Nobody's mad enough tonight."</p>

<p>Lockyear stared at him. "What's it take to make you mad
enough?"</p>

<p>Burnett grinned at him. "I'll let you know."</p>

<p>Lockyear said, "Come on, Veen. There ain't a fight in the
crowd." He crossed the yard to the horses beyond.</p>

<p>Men broke from the fire, business done, and drifted idly around.
Burnett watched George Collingwood pass through the crowd and pause
to speak, to shake hands, to move on; he went about it with a
single-minded gravity as though he had to cover everybody. Ralph
Whitcomb remained at the fire, listening closely as people came to
him, occasionally asking a question, nodding his head. Katherine
came to the table with Gram Gay. The two gathered bits and pieces
of the meat and potatoes into a set of bowls.</p>

<p>"I want one for the Kitchens," said Katherine. "And one for the
Lords." She moved away with the filled bowls, discreetly searching
out Mrs. Kitchen and Mrs. Lord. She came back to the table.</p>

<p>Gram murmured: "Mrs. Buck?"</p>

<p>"No," said Katherine. "Buck will rustle. But one for Lavinia
Ebbett."</p>

<p>Women moved against the table to recapture what was left of the
things they had brought, and their talk went on in bits and
inconclusive fragments, some compulsion making it necessary for
them to exhaust themselves completely of words. Mrs. Irish came
forward with Watt and studied the table and got a deer shank with
its few shreds of meat. She handed it to Watt, murmuring: "You
didn't get enough."</p>

<p>He said, "I'm not hungry."</p>

<p>There were women near her. She lowered her voice until its
meaning was lost to Burnett. Watt chewed reluctantly at the bone
while Mrs. Irish looked on as though she were trying to will some
of her strength into him. She murmured, "Don't waste it&mdash;put
it in your pocket&mdash;it'll make a soup bone." She turned her
back to Watt and fell into talk with Provost's wife.</p>

<p>Somebody said: "Well, great Lord, here's the squaw man and he's
brought his woman!"</p>

<p>Hawn rode into the firelight, the Calapooia girl following. When
she stopped she pulled up her horse behind him, not coming abreast;
her head remained steady, her round black eyes darted their quick
glances about her. Burnett moved forward to speak to Hawn.</p>

<p>"Get down," he said. "There's something left to eat. You're
late."</p>

<p>"We had supper," said Hawn and saw the women standing in their
groups, watching his woman; they didn't come up. He added, "We were
just traveling through."</p>

<p>"Well," insisted Burnett, "get down."</p>

<p>"It's late," said Hawn.</p>

<p>Katherine stepped forward. "Tell your wife we're glad to see
her."</p>

<p>Hawn spoke to his squaw without turning on the saddle. When he
heard what she had to say to him, Hawn looked again beyond Burnett
and Katherine to the white women so silently gathered, unfavorably
watching, and he said in a shortened voice: "No&mdash;just stopped
in to say hello." And he turned about and moved back into the
darkness, with the squaw following.</p>

<p>Mrs. Millard's voice was clear enough to be heard around the
yard. "Look how she tags after him. Lord of creation, he is, and
she ignorant enough to let him be."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ryal McIver, "he's got his bad furrow. A squaw
man's a hard lot."</p>

<p>"He ought to marry her," said Lot White. "I'll talk to him about
it."</p>

<p>"An Indian woman?" said Mrs. McIver. "What makes you talk like
that? He ought to send her back to her people."</p>

<p>"His wife, ain't she?" countered McIver.</p>

<p>"She's nothing&mdash;she's a savage."</p>

<p>"Kind should stay with kind," put in Mrs. Crabtree. "What'd he
bring her here for?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he wanted to get acquainted with his neighbors,"
suggested Burnett.</p>

<p>"Would you take them into your cabin?" asked Mrs. Rinearson.</p>

<p>"Certainly. They took me into theirs."</p>

<p>"Rice," said Mrs. Rinearson, "you're a nice man, but a fool. It
won't do."</p>

<p>The resistance which these white women had thrown across the
yard at the Hawns surprised Burnett. Nothing had led up to it or
had prepared for it; it had come at once, out of the deepest of
prejudice, out of some wrongness. He shrugged his shoulders at
Whitcomb, and Whitcomb pretended to enlighten Burnett with his
amused and lightly stinging words.</p>

<p>"The woman's not married to Hawn, and these ladies regard that
as a threat. They don't like the precedent. And she's a different
color. Any color which is not our color, Rice, is a bad thing. If
you ask me why, I can only say it's because it's not our
color."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rinearson refused to be shamed or baited. "That's what any
man would think. You're all alike, and really you'd none of you
mind being in Hawn's place. It suits your instincts fine. Just you
remember, Ralph, it's the children who suffer. Their blood's
mixed."</p>

<p>"You know the blood of your people a thousand years back?" asked
Whitcomb.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's far-fetched and you know it," said Mrs. Rinearson.
"Then's then. Now's now. What did Hawn bring her here for? To get
us to make her one of us? Why doesn't he go sit in the tent of her
people? No, he wants to be with us because he don't want savage
company. Well, he can't have both things, a savage woman and white
friends. She's not welcome in my cabin." She looked around for her
husband. "Rinearson, don't you ever bring either of them around,
not even if it's mealtime."</p>

<p>"Had no intention of doing it," said Old Daniel testily.</p>

<p>"Well, don't."</p>

<p>"All right, all right. God damn it, don't shout at me for things
I ain't doin'."</p>

<p>Burnett shook his head at Mrs. Rinearson. "Hawn guided us here.
I'm surprised you'd be willing to let a squaw man do you that
favor."</p>

<p>"Now there you go," said Mrs. Rinearson, "trying to string one
thing to another. All you men do it and call it being reasonable.
You're the most impractical people on earth, trying to make things
add right, or sit in a straight line. And don't you be gallant
about it, either, Rice Burnett. It's not gallant, it's just
wishy-washy. She's a female thing with doe-eyes and pretty enough
to turn your head, or Rinearson's. But five years from now she'll
sit on the floor with fat loppin' all over her and dirt on her
face. That man Hawn knows it, too, and he's regretting his bargain.
That's why he came here, because he's lonely and he can't talk with
her." She nodded her head with vigor and said, "I get so aggravated
listening to you men, sometimes."</p>

<p>Daniel Rinearson rolled his eyes at Burnett. "I get to thinkin'
that maybe women use their feet to think with."</p>

<p>The crowd broke up in a sudden yell of laughter. People began to
call back and forth over the yard as they moved homeward. Edna
Lattimore paused at the fire, waiting to catch Rice Burnett's
eye&mdash;and from the background Katherine Gay watched her beckon
to Rice with her smile; then, as though the mood had passed or as
though she had seen slowness in Burnett, she turned to Moss
Rinearson, spoke to him and moved away with him into the darkness.
Katherine observed Burnett's glance follow them and she tried to
read him but found nothing to read. She turned to the crowd, saying
good-by to the last stragglers, and discovered the massive block of
Harris Eby's body before her. Somebody, she thought, had given him
a drink, for he took her arm and gave it his notion of a gentle
lift; she had to catch hold of his sleeve to keep her balance. He
laughed at her and steered her across the yard and around the cabin
into the thicker shadows.</p>

<p>"Katherine," he said, "I want to say..."</p>

<p>"Who's got whisky around here?"</p>

<p>"You a temperance woman?"</p>

<p>"No, I was only curious."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I wouldn't mind a temperance woman. Liquor
don't mean enough to me to be an effort to give up. Tobacco's a
different thing. Your father don't smoke. That your mother's
idea?"</p>

<p>"She persuaded him."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I have got to smoke. It's a comfort and I'm
damned if I see what's unholy about comfort. You ain't that set
against tobacco, are you?"</p>

<p>"I never said a thing about it."</p>

<p>"That's fine. Now, Katherine, I want to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That your horse pitching around the other horses?"</p>

<p>He turned and he bent his head and searched the shadowy line of
tethered animals across the yard at the meadow fence. "No," he
said. "Think it's Ared's&mdash;that fiddlin' sorrel that dumped him
in the Snake." He straightened himself, he looked down upon her
from his height and collected his thoughts to say again what he had
twice started to say.</p>

<p>She made a short and restless swing with her body. "There's a
bite to the air all of a sudden."</p>

<p>"Like to see a little snow," he said. "Would remind me of
home."</p>

<p>"Home's here now, Harris."</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "So I go back to my cabin and think it's
home. Well, it's not quite home yet. What I been squarin' off to
talk about is right along that line&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Somebody's calling me," she said.</p>

<p>He reached out and took her arms and held her still. "Be quiet a
minute&mdash;don't head me off again."</p>

<p>"Whisky&mdash;whisky."</p>

<p>"No, by God, it's not whisky. It's me, and I want you to come to
a stand and answer my question."</p>

<p>"Not tonight."</p>

<p>"Well, when?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sometime. Sometime when we're more settled."</p>

<p>"Never be more settled," he said. The exuberance brought on by
the liquor seemed to leave him and his moment of impatience was
over. "Well," he said, "I can see it's nothing you want to take up
now. But I want you to think on it. I want to settle and start a
family."</p>

<p>"I know," she said.</p>

<p>"Think about it." He took her arm and moved back to the yard; he
looked down, half smiling, and said "Good night," and moved from
the yard, an enormous shadow which took a long time to fade.</p>

<p>Katherine drifted to the table, coming beside Gram. Her father
and Ralph Whitcomb and the Old Man and Burnett were at the fire;
the other neighbors had gone. She was restless, at odds with
herself. She watched the men at the fire until irritation swung her
to the table and set her to work with the scattered dishes. Gram's
voice came at her with a mysterious whispering.</p>

<p>"Pride&mdash;pride. When you eat with it, it's a stone in your
stomach, and when you sleep with it your bed's death-cold. Pride's
got no lips to kiss you, no flesh to cover you and keep the
lonesomes away. It will give you no delight and make you no
babies."</p>

<p>Martha Gay crossed from the cabin to the fire and began to talk
to the men in a tired, half-fretful way and Gram looked on a moment
and presently walked over, leaving Katherine alone at the
table.</p>

<p>"It was a good meeting," said Gay.</p>

<p>"Talk, talk," said Martha Gay. "Men can't do anything without
arguin'."</p>

<p>"Takes time," said Gay. "But we got the idea of the road
started. I expected more trouble, but when Lockyear bucked it, a
lot of others changed their minds to favor it." He smiled. "I hoped
he'd do that."</p>

<p>Ralph Whitcomb said: "You're a sly man with a pious face."</p>

<p>"I know how to use mine enemies," said Gay. He drew a breath and
passed a hand across his chest in a massaging motion. Martha Gay
watched him, the pessimism of her nature taking fresh concern.</p>

<p>"You been doin' that lately," said Martha. "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Just a kink," said Gay. "Well, it was a good get-together.
There's not really such an all-fired hurry to do road work, but if
it hadn't been brought up, Old Daniel might have laid out the road
where it pleased him; then there'd been a scrap, the whole
settlement full of bad temper. Now he knows what we think, and
he'll abide the vote. That's one thing he respects&mdash;the
vote."</p>

<p>"They ate us clean," said Martha. "I don't begrudge it, except
maybe the Provosts, who'd eat anything free if it bust them."</p>

<p>Whitcomb said: "Any Indians been around?"</p>

<p>"They've been to Rinearsons, begging, and one buck popped his
head into the Kitchens' cabin and scared hell out of Miz' Kitchen.
They're a poor lot. Goin' back tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"After I make the rounds, though there's not much sickness here.
You're a healthy lot."</p>

<p>"We better be," said Gay with a touch of grimness. "It's a long
winter yet."</p>

<p>The Old Man, silent on his haunches, rose and moved to the cabin
without a word. Burnett swung to warm his back and noticed
Katherine alone at the table; he walked toward her. "Coffee
left?"</p>

<p>"Yes, cold," she said, and continued her work with the dishes.
He got himself a cup and filled it. He filled a second cup and
watched her circle the table. When she came along his side of the
table he put the second cup before her. She said, "I don't want
it," but he reached for her hand and laid the cup into it. She said
"What do you want?" Then she laughed at him and murmured,
"You&mdash;you're only trouble." She tasted the coffee and took his
cup from him and threw the coffee into the pot. "Put it on the
fire."</p>

<p>He carried the pot to the fire. Katherine followed him, settling
on a log beside the flame; she propped her elbows on her knees and
laid her chin in her hands, and almost at once the tawny core of
the fire drew her attention and carried her a long way off. Gram
and Martha Gay disappeared into the cabin. Presently John Gay went
away.</p>

<p>Whitcomb stood a moment longer at the blaze. "When women speak
of love, they mean possession and security, and these women were
outraged that Hawn's squaw didn't bargain for it with Hawn."</p>

<p>"Is it a bargaining business?" asked Rice.</p>

<p>"Certainly. You heard Mrs. Millard say that men's instincts were
loose. They all feel it. So they want it signed and sealed."</p>

<p>Katherine looked up to Whitcomb. "You're talking crazy,
Ralph."</p>

<p>He looked at her with his smiling easiness; he glanced at
Burnett and moved to his horse. He stripped it and let it go for
browsing; he carried his outfit past them to the shed.</p>

<p>Burnett settled on the log beside Katherine.</p>

<p>She said: "Does he do it just to tease us?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He saw Lucy tonight. Maybe that's it."</p>

<p>He moved around to the coffeepot, filled the cups and came back
to the log. She nested her cup between both hands. "It was a good
meeting," she said. "Except for the Lockyears. I don't like Cal.
All the women are afraid of him&mdash;and a lot of the men."</p>

<p>"That's his fun."</p>

<p>"It's not right."</p>

<p>"Let them stop him."</p>

<p>She said: "No, it's not fair. Lorenzo Buck couldn't fight
him."</p>

<p>"Lorenzo could use a bullet on him, but Lorenzo won't. That's
the way Lockyear judges men&mdash;whether they'd kill or not.
That's the threat he hangs over them. And they back up from
it."</p>

<p>"No man's got the right to do that to anybody."</p>

<p>"Let them stop him. People that want their pride respected have
got to risk their necks for it."</p>

<p>"You sound like Lockyear."</p>

<p>"We both went it alone a long time. He's still going it alone,
but I'm changing&mdash;I'm a tame Tom now."</p>

<p>She turned to him. "You don't like it, either." As she grew
interested her attitude lightened. She rested a hand on his arm,
looking back to the fire with a soothed expression. Her nearness
affected him and drove its momentary aggressive flash through him
and he found himself remembering the many expressions her face had
shown him; the practical air, the mysterious manner when she stared
into the firelight, the stubborn resistance to misery, her helpless
resentment toward Lavinia White's marriage, the bright side-strike
of her eyes when curiosity got the better of her. Her moods were
varied and lively.</p>

<p>"What was it like&mdash;the way you used to live?"</p>

<p>"Too cold or too hot. Plenty of food or none at all. Looking for
a better creek to trap over the next hill. Some fighting, some
drinking. Camp here tonight, camp there tomorrow. Trouble never out
of your head&mdash;that was the main thing&mdash;trouble never
entirely out of your head. Never was a time you didn't listen for
it or look for it. It kept your bristles lifted so much that they
finally got the habit and wouldn't lie down."</p>

<p>"That's like Lockyear," she said.</p>

<p>He lifted his head to listen into the night. Beyond this bowl of
light lay the heavy-accented darkness and night fog hung close down
and all odors were strong around them. There was no wind, no
motion. He said: "Never feel safe close to a fire at night. That's
part of the old business in my bones."</p>

<p>"But you're calmer now than when I first saw you in the wagon
train. You were more like a stranger&mdash;not like a settler."</p>

<p>She laid her arms across her knees and bent forward to the fire.
Her lips were round and idle, her whole face at peace. Light danced
in her eyes and cast its red stain against her hair. "Tonight I
feel at home. It was seeing the neighbors all together that did
it." She turned her attention to him. "You wear a beard in the
mountains?"</p>

<p>"Clear down to my chest. Curly."</p>

<p>"Couldn't be curly. Your hair's not curly."</p>

<p>"Was though."</p>

<p>She narrowed her glance to visualize his appearance with a
beard. "No, I'd not like it. Don't wear one." Her next remark ran
into the rest of her words, without a lift of voice and without a
change of breath. "I hear most trappers had squaws."</p>

<p>"Common thing."</p>

<p>She bent for a small stick and used it to draw tracks along the
ground. Once she looked back to him, the question formed and almost
spoken; then she resumed her aimless pattern making with the
stick.</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>"I didn't ask."</p>

<p>"The hell you didn't."</p>

<p>"I guess I did. What if you'd had a squaw? Would you've told
me?"</p>

<p>"That's best. These Indian women&mdash;do they love their
men?"</p>

<p>"Tell me what that is."</p>

<p>She dropped the stick and let her laugh spring out. She laid her
palm on his hand and closed it. "Rice&mdash;Rice." She gave his
hand a rough shake. Sensation ran through him again.</p>

<p>"But," she said, "it can't be any different, one kind of people
or another. It must be the same thing all over."</p>

<p>"Part of it's the same thing all over."</p>

<p>She dug the tip of the stick deeper into the ground.
"Part&mdash;part," she said, and shook her head. Her face lost
serenity. "Oh, no. There are no parts&mdash;it's just one big round
thing."</p>

<p>He rose and kicked a log into the bright coals and watched the
brilliant ash flakes stream upward; he circled the fire and studied
Katherine over the tip of its flame. Her eyes were a different
blue, the smile was gone. She drew herself straight on the log,
shoulders squared, and she became entirely still as her thinking
seemed to close in on a thought. In a moment the thought went away
and she raised her eyes and smiled. He circled the fire, coming
before her and standing over her.</p>

<p>"Why are you so restless?" she murmured. "Always restless."</p>

<p>"Time to go home."</p>

<p>"So soon? I hate to leave a fire&mdash;hate to go to bed."</p>

<p>He turned over the yard to his horse. She rose and followed him
and stood beside the horse after he had mounted; and she cocked her
head, listening into the night, to a cowbell's steady clanking in
the meadow, to the undulating rumors of the creek. "Will you get
tired of this, Rice? Will you pull stakes and go back to the
mountains?"</p>

<p>"Nothing there to go back to," he said, and rode away.</p>

<p>She returned to the fire and clasped her hands behind her and
took in long, deep draughts of the night air; a thousand odors rose
from the earth in shimmering waves, and rolled in from the timber
and from the hills, and the damp atmosphere blended all these into
a pungent, impalpable liquor. Somebody stirred in the cabin; her
mother, a coat covering her nightgown, came out to the fire and
made a spurious gesture of chilliness with her hands. She had her
hair braided down for the night and she tried to appear sleepy but
her mind was in one of its lively worrying spells.</p>

<p>"What was Harris talking to you about?"</p>

<p>"Same thing," said Katherine.</p>

<p>"What'd you tell him?"</p>

<p>"To wait awhile."</p>

<p>Her mother's voice took on a lightly nagging concern. "Why? He's
got his cabin up. He's got supplies enough to keep himself and a
wife. He's ready, and I should think you'd be too. I just don't
make out why you stand off on Harris like you do. When I was
fifteen I prayed for a husband and a cabin of my own. I couldn't
wait. I was miserable under my mother's feet. I can't understand
why you're not that way. You mean to have him, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Katherine.</p>

<p>"Well, then..."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Katherine, interrupting the inevitable
question. "There's no harm in waiting till spring&mdash;it's a
better time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gay shook her head. "You're not wise to make him wait if he
wants to get married now. Suppose the Snyder girl got it in her
head to make eyes at him? Suppose she went down to his cabin and
fooled around?"</p>

<p>"Well, then?" said Katherine.</p>

<p>"It's happened before," said Martha Gay. "Men can't defend
themselves very well&mdash;and if Debby Snyder trapped him away
from you I'd never hold up my head again. I've been hurt already by
the talk about you bein' nineteen and still single. I just don't
understand why you stand off." She looked curiously at her
daughter. "You've not got strange notions, have you? You don't want
things perfect, I hope&mdash;moonshine and nonsense? It's well
enough to talk of love. That's for people in parlors, with money
and time, that's for those who can send their daughters to
fashionable places, for those who don't have to make their way,
scrub their own clothes and cook and raise their own children.
Don't you get such notions, Katherine&mdash;they're not for you.
You have got to get married and make your way. You have got to take
one of the young men that's here. Harris will turn out a well-to-do
man someday, and he'll not be a willful man, he'll not break your
heart or your back&mdash;he'll not be hard for you to manage."</p>

<p>Katherine stared into the fire, saying nothing; and Mrs. Gay,
knowing the futility of argument with her daughter, gave a small
sound of distress and turned away. An afterthought swung her about.
"Maybe Harris is good-natured, but if you keep so friendly with
Rice, and people get to talkin', maybe Harris won't stay
good-natured." Then she went on to the cabin. Katherine settled on
her heels and began to poke at the fire, dreaming into the yellow
flame.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter 19</h2>

<p>COLLINGWOOD returned to his cabin late, he having stopped in at
the Monteiths' for further talk. The fire was down to its last ruby
coals and Lucy lay curled wide-awake on the bed. He settled on a
bench, he pulled off his boots; he lighted his pipe and settled for
a spell of that secretive dreaming whose signs she knew so well. He
lived a great deal in his fancy; and in his fancy he was quite a
man.</p>

<p>He said: "What did Whitcomb say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, of course. Why did you send him?"</p>

<p>"I thought he ought to look at you again. You don't always seem
well."</p>

<p>"Stop talking to him about me. I'm as well as anybody. I keep up
my work."</p>

<p>Turning on the bench, he crouched to smoke his pipe and to stare
into the ruddy coals. She knew, by the short shifts of expression
on his face, that he was reviewing the meeting; he was remembering
what he had said and the little victories of personal attention he
had won. It was vanity, for he was an actor; but it was more than
vanity&mdash;it was a consuming hunger to be thought well of.
Sometimes it seemed to her that he fought a terrible battle with
himself, for in many ways he was a small person, and perhaps he had
moments when he knew it and hated himself and tried, by standing
before his fellow men, to gather into him the character which he
lacked. He was as transparent as glass in most things, yet in some
respects he had an obscure roundabout method which made him complex
to her.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I do keep up my part, don't I? Or have I
failed you?"</p>

<p>"No, you've done well. You've had a hard time. I don't blame you
for a thing."</p>

<p>"Where have I failed you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say you had," he said; and she knew that though she
might pry at him all night she could never break through the
secrecy of his nature if he chose to be still.</p>

<p>"Stop telling anybody that I'm not well," she asked.</p>

<p>"I only thought I was being honest about it."</p>

<p>"No you didn't. You only say it so that others will say, 'What a
thoughtful man and affectionate husband."</p>

<p>He gave her a short, sidewise look and stared back to the fire;
his mouth settled and she thought he meant to relapse into one of
his extended moody silences. But he surprised her; he became
talkative. "I saw everybody tonight. We got the road business
straightened out. Some of the boys bucked, but Gay and Rinearson
and I more or less settled it. By the way, I asked Rinearson for a
cow. Not as a gift, but as a loan till we're able to buy one."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He would have done it, except for one thing." He gave her a
fuller look, making a smile of it. "He said if you didn't dress so
well when everybody else was so poor he wouldn't mind, but damned
if he would otherwise."</p>

<p>"What did you tell him?"</p>

<p>"I let it go. You can't argue with Rinearson."</p>

<p>"You didn't tell him I make these clothes out of scrap stuff? If
I like to sew, that's my affair. If I like to look well, it's none
of his. Tell him that&mdash;or I shall."</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Lucy. It only makes hard feelings."</p>

<p>"Then let <i>him</i> not make hard feelings."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "He means nothing by it."</p>

<p>She turned on the bed to look toward the ceiling; she lay still,
hands folded, eyes half shut. "You always have some reason but I
never get it out of you. You've got a reason for asking Whitcomb to
come, too."</p>

<p>"Well, you could be pleasant to him."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He travels a lot, he sees everybody, knows everybody. He could
put in a word for me wherever he goes."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>He surprised her again. He rose, and he tried&mdash;she actually
saw him go about it&mdash;to be impressive to her. "There'll be an
election next spring for the legislature of the provisional
government. There'll be a man from this district. Nobody much wants
it. But I want it. That's why I'd like to be on friendly terms with
people."</p>

<p>"What good will it do you? How will you work the claim?"</p>

<p>"Oh, somehow."</p>

<p>"But what's the good of going to the legislature?"</p>

<p>He started to tell her something, changed his mind, and only
said: "It's something to start with."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>He shook his head and returned to the fireplace. For a moment
she thought she had the bottom layer of George Collingwood brought
to light, but it slipped back suddenly into the obscure parts of
him. Then she thought: "But he's willing for me to be nice to
Ralph. I'm part of his horse trade." She turned on her side, away
from him. Some of his trouble began with her; very soon after
marriage she had come upon that pliable and elusive streak, the
shrinking-away from the harshness of even small decisions, the
extreme vanity interlaced with extreme sensitiveness, the ambition
coupled to a courage so frail it wouldn't endure the lightest
shocks; and from then onward, their marriage had turned into the
monotony of acceptance, endurance and personal isolation. She knew
he felt his failure with her and perhaps this was why he wanted to
be in the legislature, to show her and to show his neighbors that
he was better than they believed him to be. It was sad; for her
feeling for him was dead and no dramatic triumph he might achieve
could substitute for the solidness he lacked. It was more than sad:
it was the tragedy of a man who with bottom and forthrightness
might have been great, but who was otherwise only shabby and
laughable in the eyes of his neighbors. She recognized the tragedy
but couldn't feel it; all she could feel was pity, and even this
was gradually crowded out, as time went on, by the desperation
accumulating within her. She was alone, she was unused; the wealth
of spirit and passion which should have passed so freely out of her
into him lay painfully clogged within her, the pressures casting a
most lurid light across her fancies. She was his wife and came to
him when he made his demand, but when they were through she lay
with the urge to love still unquenched; gradually the fear came
upon her that this urge, too long repressed, would dot into the
impotent bitterness of a woman no longer able to give or to
receive. Lying silent, she thought of Ralph Whitcomb and the wish
to have him passed beyond restraint.</p>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter 20</h2>

<p>THE cabin was up, the rear meadow plowed, and the wheat in.
Those were the first things. Afterwards Burnett sat down to arrange
the endless chores in the order they ought to go; for when the
peaceful mood was upon him he was the most methodical of men who
wanted a recognized pattern in his work. It was December, four
months until planting time, seven until wheat harvest. He needed to
run fence lines, to fell cedar trees and buck out bolts from which
to make posts and rails; he had to slash brush, to lay a footbridge
over the creek, to hunt a spring on the hill, to build a barn and a
smokehouse; he had to cut a road as far as Lattimore's through the
dense stand of timber which lay between; he had to lay out his
mill, build a raceway, square his timbers and begin the long
drudgery of sawing lumber; and somewhere during the winter, he had
to make a trip to Oregon City for supplies and to Fort Vancouver
for a pair of millstones and enough strap iron to bind his wooden
construction.</p>

<p>He built a saw pit, and one evening walked down to Mrs. Irish's
cabin. "I'll need Watt for a week or two. I'll give him a dollar a
day and pay you in supplies when I get stocked up at Oregon
City."</p>

<p>Watt stood in the saw pit, under the log laid over the
framework, and got the wood dust and splintered bark in his face as
he guided the saw at the bottom of its cut; straddled above the
log, Burnett hauled the saw up and down, traveling lengthwise with
the log. A deep slab cut from four sides of the log created a
square timber; from this timber he took his inch-thick boards and
stacked them out to season. At the end of a week he had a hundred
boards cut and, observing Watt Irish climb from the pit like a
half-drowned swimmer climbing ashore, he knew he had a dead beat
boy on his hands. "We'll let that do for a while," he said, and
watched Watt move homeward through the graying twilight, small and
sharp-pointed body as loose as a sack of meal.</p>

<p>He knew what the feeling was, for he had some of it in himself
and would have paid a stiff price for a drink to take the
accumulated ache from his bones. He cooked supper; he milked; he
built the fire till its brightness filled the room and took up the
chore of planing out cedar boards for shelving and furniture. At
midnight of one more of the many eighteen-hour days behind him he
fried a meal to take the place of lost rest and walked along the
creek to catch the sound of his stock; all the animals had drifted
to the upper end of his place, liking some kind of feed they found
there.</p>

<p>Darkness was a packed-down thing between the ridges, layer upon
layer of it squeezed together by the million miles of weight above,
and the thick mist rubbed his face with its cobweb tickling. In
such a night the various odors of the land rose from their separate
places like the bubbling water of small springs, a bit of mint
smell here, the aroma of an occasional cedar, the vague pollen
scent of bracken fern; and these rivulets of odor joined and became
invisible creeks coursing the night, to meet other creeks of more
pronounced size, the resin flavor of the firs, the acrid cast of
skunk musk, the reek of smoke from his cabin fire, the
effervescence of mud-rotted grasses through the meadows; and all
creeks fell into one broad river of odor flowing sluggish and
strong and rank and wild through the night. He turned back to the
cabin, rolled into his blanket and was at once asleep.</p>

<p>He rose in morning's dark, and he rose stiff and cranky and
drank half a pot of coffee before his mind would move or his
muscles would respond. The cattle rattled across the creek and
stood soft-breathing in the yard, waiting for him. He milked and
went back to the saw pit; morning's damp cold shocked him and
pulled his shoulders together; his footsteps were ragged prints in
the crystal-beaded grass. It was Sunday and at noon he carried two
big buckets of milk down the trail for Mrs. Irish and returned as
far as the Lattimores' for dinner; afterwards he returned to his
saw pits until dusk unrolled its gauze through the hills. When he
had finished his chores he stepped into the house to make supper.
He had the frying pan on the fire when suddenly the four walls of
the room closed in on him and he couldn't bear the thought of his
own company. He pulled the pan aside, took his gun and saddled his
horse and rode to Hawn's.</p>

<p>Hawn heard the horse coming and was at the door, not in the
frame of light but outside the cabin and shadowed against the wall.
"Wondered how long it'd take you to get cabin fever. Come in. We
got salt pork and beans."</p>

<p>"The salt's fine. I'm sweated flat."</p>

<p>Inside, Louisa smiled at him. She listened to Hawn talk, and the
smile grew broader. She made a motion with her hand and spoke to
Hawn. "She says it's a shame your bed's cold."</p>

<p>"That gets right down to facts."</p>

<p>"Women always do," said Hawn. "When a man bays at the moon and
thinks it's poetry in his soul, his squaw figures different. She
loads his gun and sends him out to fight or she turns down the
blankets and takes him to bed. Far as she's concerned, it's one
thing or the other he needs."</p>

<p>"Might be right."</p>

<p>"Might be," said Hawn. But he was quiet as he said it and there
was a change in his old, free manner. They ate and settled to
smoking, comfortably silent until Hawn unexpectedly said: "You
think so?"</p>

<p>"I was only making talk, Bob. Damned if I know."</p>

<p>"I knew a trapper once," said Hawn. "Tab Boyer. We were up on
the Yellowstone and the Blackfoot jumped us and Tab got an arrow
through the liver. It took him two hours to die. He wasn't afraid
of dyin'&mdash;he'd lost too much blood to give a damn but kept
sayin', 'I'm twenty-seven and I ain't done nothin', and now I'm
dyin' and I'll never get it done.' And I said to Tab, 'What you
ain't done?' and Tab put up a hand and closed his fingers around
the air and he said, 'It's a pity&mdash;it's a God-damned pity. I
had fifty years comin' to me and I ain't goin' to get it. I ain't
goin' to do what I'm for.' And I said, 'What's that, Tab?' And he
said 'I don't know but I'd sure found out, because what's eyes and
ears and a brain put in a man for? Not for nothin': Tab was goin'
out and I was curious, so I said: 'You see anything, Tab?' And he
said, 'Where?' And I said, 'Across the river, where you're goin'.'
He said, 'Not a God-damn' thing over there. But I see somethin'
here and I wish I could live. Because livin' ain't no accident.
Does a man crawl out of a woman just to die at twenty-seven with an
arrow through his liver? That's no sense&mdash;not when grass grows
for a reason and dies for a reason, and comes again for a reason.
Grass is for buffalo and buffalo is for man, and man for somethin'
else, but man's such a God-damn' fool he won't keep his part of it
like the grass and buffalo do. If a man believes a thing, it's so,
and he can go out and make it so, but he won't. He's got to get
drunk or he's got to die before he sees it, and now I'm dyin' and
what I see is no good to me, and it's a Goddamned pity."</p>

<p>Hawn tapped out his pipe; he filled it again. He looked at
Burnett. "You believe that?"</p>

<p>"I'm like Tab," said Burnett. "It comes when I'm drunk. Maybe
once in a while when I'm not drunk."</p>

<p>"What got me," said Hawn, "was the grass and buffalo business,
for that's dead true. It reasons out nice. It sort of stretches a
man's thinkin', he sees these little things tie up. Like the
pattern in one of Grandmaw's comforter quilts. You can't see the
whole quilt&mdash;it stretches to hell and gone out there, way out.
But you can see the pieces of the pattern and you can see the
stitches, so you know there must be a quilt, or what's the pattern
for? Like Tab said, it's not for nothin'."</p>

<p>"Now you're lookin' into the hole that's got no bottom," said
Burnett.</p>

<p>"I never knew a hole without a bottom," said Hawn. "It's not in
nature."</p>

<p>"There's no such thing as a hole without a bottom," said
Burnett.</p>

<p>"Then," said Hawn, "this hole that's got no bottom, has got a
bottom."</p>

<p>"There you are."</p>

<p>"Sure enough," said Hawn.</p>

<p>"All you've got to do," said Burnett, "is find the difference
that makes the two things the same. Then we'll know what we're
doing here."</p>

<p>Hawn chuckled and adjusted himself more comfortably on the floor
blanket. "We got to look a little farther down that hole."</p>

<p>"The man that looks too far down," said Burnett, "falls in. Then
he can't come back to tell us what he saw."</p>

<p>Bob Hawn's glance followed Louisa as she walked through the
doorway into the night. "Those damned Lockyears are makin' whisky.
They packed a lot of wheat from Oregon City last week. It was
covered up on the pack animals but some of the kernels dropped
along the trail."</p>

<p>"Whisky and trouble," said Burnett. He lifted himself and stood
at the fire. "Didn't see much of you at Gay's."</p>

<p>Hawn rose and crossed to the doorway and swung his head from
side to side as he made his search for Louisa. "God damn those
white women, they made a ring around her and stood back and looked
at her like she was an animal."</p>

<p>"They don't know her yet. It takes a little time."</p>

<p>"There ain't any more time for that. She's got their faces
memorized. She'll spend a little time every day keepin' those faces
alive in her mind and every day she'll make a ceremony of hating
'em." Hawn turned and moved around the room, speaking out his
regret. "I wish none of you had come to this country. We were doin'
fine. I had damned near gotten over being a white man, but it's all
back. I'm lonely for my people, and she knows it, and things ain't
the same with us any more."</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd better pull stakes and get away from us."</p>

<p>"I did that once. I came out here. You caught up. If I moved
again, you'd catch up again. There's no runnin' away from
nothin'."</p>

<p>Burnett said, "Tell Louisa thanks for supper," and left the
cabin. When he was a ways down the trail he heard Hawn calling for
Louisa.</p>

<p>The timber closed in upon the trail and Burnett rode
thoughtfully on through this intense blackness, hearing the nearby
rush of the creek. He crossed a small meadow whose wet grasses cast
off the palest light, and entered timber again. His horse grew
restive beneath him, head flung up, body tense, and at this warning
Burnett lifted the rifle from the saddle and cradled it in his
arms. At the upper meadow he heard his pack horses scudding around
the soft earth, sent into aimless flight by something. The cattle
were motionless, the cowbell had ceased to clank. He reined in,
hearing nothing above the datter of the creek and though he waited
half an hour he saw nothing in the night. It was not until he was
in his blankets that he understood the nervousness of the animals;
from the ridge came the undulating cry of a wolf.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Hawn waited for Louisa to return; and watched her come silently
into the cabin and settle on the corner blanket. She looked away
from him. He said, "Why are you angry?"</p>

<p>"I make you sad," she said. "You want your people. You want a
white girl."</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I saw it."</p>

<p>He rose up from the bench and pushed the fire into a small pile;
he went to the yard and circled the house and came back to latch
the door. She was in bed and when he got in beside her he put his
arms about her and said, "Now I'm happy. Women are foolish. They
think wrong things."</p>

<p>But even then her body didn't respond and he knew that she had
sensed the wavering in him, the growing wish to be one of the
settlers. This was why he had taken Louisa to the meeting and this
was why the failure was so painful. He had tried to conceal it but
the girl looked through him as though he were a window. He saw the
end; even now he saw it coming forward and knew there was nothing
he could do to stop it.</p>

<p>She made a small sound and sat up in bed. He said, "What is it?"
She turned and laid herself across his chest, not crying, not
speaking, not moving; she was back from her unreachable place but
she was sadder than he was and this was her way of trying to tell
him how it was with her. He knew they would never be closer than
they were now; he knew they would never again be this close.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
On Monday morning Burnett returned to the saw pit and all that week
made lumber without help. When Sunday came he oiled the crosscut
and hung it in the cabin. He had the one-by-twelve planks in one
stack, the two-by-fours in another, with each layer of boards held
from the next layer by cross boards so that air would flow through
the piles and dry the boards evenly.</p>

<p>It was a comfort, after the long roaming years, to stand on his
own land and to see these possessions, for it brought to him a
revelation of the only way a man could capture the fleeting hours
of his life. The footprints of the roamer faded from the dust at
the first wind's puff and his breath fell into the air and was
lost; but in the ax marks along the cabin logs each swing of his
shoulder lay frozen, translated from nothing to something. This was
what wealth meant, this trading of the impermanent days of life
into the permanent things before him. He could touch one layer of
boards on the pile and say, "This was what I was yesterday," and
touch another and say, "this was what I was the day before." There
stood his day, boards and cabin and fence rails and plowed fields;
these were his hours captured and brought forward into the future
for so long as he lived, and at the end of a lifetime he might look
down from the ridge and see that life lying before him, each day
and week and month of it visible in familiar form.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of that Sunday he borrowed Lattimore's wagon
and oxen and set out for Fort Vancouver to get his mill wheels.
Having scratched one chore from the list, the next one pressed in
on him; and each particular piece of work, as its turn came, rode
him as hard as the rest.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter 21</h2>

<p>WHIT RINEARSON said: "That stuff scrapes goin' down." He
flinched as the liquor hit his stomach; his mouth stretched tight
along his teeth. He poured the last drop from cup to palm and
rubbed it with a finger. It spread like oil, it had an odor which
sickened him.</p>

<p>"You liked it last night," said Cal Lockyear. "For a pup you
drink stcady."</p>

<p>"Two cups."</p>

<p>"Two cups, hell," said Lockyear. "Veen died on three and you
fell down on four. You were reachin' for a gun to shoot me. You get
ambitious when you're drunk."</p>

<p>"Don't remember it," said Whit. He shuddered in the damp morning
air and plunged his hands into his pocket for warmth. His pale
blond hair lay coarse-matted around his skull; his eyes were
flushed and the soft skin around them was darkly puffed. Lockyear
laughed at him and moved to the creek with four half-filled jugs
and added water enough to cut the whisky fifty-fifty. He put the
jugs in the pack rig of a horse standing by. "Well, let's go."</p>

<p>Veen said: "I'm not goin' up there, and you're a fool if you
do."</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Lockyear.</p>

<p>"Drunk Indian's a drunk Indian," said Veen.</p>

<p>"We'll have a little fun," said Cal. He looked at Whit
Rinearson. "Comin'?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Whit and got on his horse.</p>

<p>Morning mist rose from the narrow clearing between trees and
water, and smoke lifted from the chimney in blue curls, and along
the water at this hour gnats hovered in cloudy clusters. On all
sides of this pocket the mountains roughly rose and the trail into
which Lockyear and Whit turned was immediately smothered by the
massive roundabout timber. From time to time as they ascended the
hills a small meadow broke the firs and at intervals they skirted
the creek at some rocky narrow place through which the choked water
thundered in whiteness. Fog rolled sluggishly about them and when
they struck low branches the lodged moisture fell upon them in
heavy sheets.</p>

<p>The trail was a broad trace beaten deep into the forest mold.
Lockyear's head never ceased turning as he searched the way ahead
and the dark coverts to either side of him. They passed another
meadow in which beaten-down sections of ground and blackened fire
circles were testimony of a recent camp.</p>

<p>"We're bein' watched now," Lockyear said and threw his rifle
across his arm. "I been at this too long not to know when an
Indian's lookin' at me."</p>

<p>"How many up here?"</p>

<p>"Twenty&mdash;thirty. Don't know. They shift around."</p>

<p>He halted, he tilted the rifle downward on his arm. Twenty paces
forward on the trail stood an Indian who seemed at first to be
scarcely more than a fat boy; a second look showed him to be a
full-grown man, five feet tall, fat, round-faced and dirty. His
ragged hair fell somewhat below his ears; he wore moccasins, white
man's pants and a short blanket shirt. He carried a carbine which
he took care to point away from the two white men. He said
something in his tongue.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Whit.</p>

<p>"Don't know. Molally, I guess." Lockyear pointed to the Indian's
gun and to his own gun and shook his head. He patted his chest over
his heart, he pointed to the pack horse and made a drinking motion.
The Indian stood still. Lockyear said, "These people ain't smart.
It wouldn't take a Crow or a Sioux long to catch on." But he waited
until the Indian, waggling finger across air, turned about and took
the trail at a half trot.</p>

<p>The Molala village, when they came upon it, lay in a brushy
meadow beside a very small creek; it was less a village than a
temporary camp of eight lodges, constructed partly of brush and
partly of dressed skins, pitched helter-skelter among the alder
saplings. A band of children wheeled and fled away; the little
guide called forward and men and women came through the alders and
out of the tents until there was a group of perhaps fifty standing
in wary semicircle. The little guide made a speech, frequently
slapping his chest. Lockyear said dryly: "Makin' medicine for
himself."</p>

<p>"Scabby-lookin' lot," said Whit.</p>

<p>The men, on average, were taller than the chubby guide but
scarcely up to the stature of either Lockyear or Rinearson. Few
looked particularly muscular and most were scarred by smallpox.
They were dressed in nondescript fashion, some in straight Indian
style, some half Indian and half white; the women were, with few
exceptions, homely, heavy and sullen. The largest man of the group
detached himself from the crowd and spoke first to the chubby guide
and then to Lockyear.</p>

<p>Lockyear dismounted and walked to the pack horse and got out a
jug. He put the jug on the ground. He removed his beaver hat and
ran his hand around the fur; he laid the hat beside the jug. Almost
immediately the Indian spokesman began to shake his head and to
talk in a louder voice; other voices rose up from the crowd to
quarrel with the chief.</p>

<p>"Chief's been bitten by that stuff before," said Whit. "He don't
want it."</p>

<p>"He'll bite again," said Lockyear. "Watch his eyes roll around.
He's talkin' against himself. They'll all be drunker than hell in
ten minutes and we'll have our pick of what's good around
here."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything good except a couple of those young
squaws." Lockyear grinned. "You want one?"</p>

<p>"Not to take back."</p>

<p>"Didn't say to take back. Here we go."</p>

<p>Men broke from the crowd and moved into the lodges and came out
with pint-sized Hudson's Bay tin cups; suddenly a few women ran for
the lodges, returning with similar cups. They came nearer Lockyear,
watching him, watching the jug. Lockyear pointed to the beaver cap.
The chief said a short phrase sharply and the chubby little man
turned to Lockyear and made a pushing gesture with his hands. He
pointed north, made the sign of a man on a horse; pointed to
Lockyear's pack animal and pointed north again.</p>

<p>Lockyear shook his head. The chubby man laid a hand across his
mouth, thinking. He turned into a tent and came out with a blue,
heavy-woven blanket. He pointed to it, to the beaver hat, and once
more pointed north.</p>

<p>"Hudson's Bay blanket," said Lockyear. "I make out they've
traded their furs to the company. Well, we ain't got much to get
here this time. But maybe a little drink will wean 'em from the
company." He picked up the jug and held it under his arm. The
gesture was misunderstood, for a young Indian gave a short shout,
rushed from the circle and pulled the jug from Lockyear; he held it
over his head like a scalp for the crowd to see and was immediately
surrounded by men and women with their cups.</p>

<p>"I see a couple guns in the crowd," said Whit.</p>

<p>Lockyear stepped back to his horse and laid an idle arm on his
rifle. "Might be a little trouble here, but when they sober up
they'll come to me and sell anything they've got for another
drink."</p>

<p>The young Indian took his drink straight from the jug and
surrendered the jug. It went around, cup to cup, mouth to mouth;
the chubby little man said something and pointed to the pack horse,
whereupon the crowd moved around Lockyear and Rinearson; the other
three jugs were taken and passed about.</p>

<p>"Don't get separated from me," said Lockyear. "I've seen this
business before."</p>

<p>He moved through the group with slow care, for suddenly it was
touch-and-go. These people had no resistance whatever to liquor;
the moment it struck their stomachs it broke such restraints as
they had and inflamed them to an unnatural pitch of anger. The
first people to drink were drunk before the last people had managed
to catch hold of the jugs; within five minutes the liquor was gone
and every man and woman in the camp milled about in a smaller, more
excited cluster. Half a dozen women rushed a man holding an empty
jug. He swung the jug around him, caught one woman on the head with
it and dropped her senseless to the ground; the rest of the women
seized his arms and began to claw at him, tearing his clothes into
shreds and entirely stripping him. They slashed him with their
fingers until, shouting his misery, he broke through and rushed
into the timber. The jug, rolling free on the ground, drew the
crowd's attention and squaws and bucks rushed at it, fell on it and
fought with silent venom for its possession. Lockyear and Rinearson
got to a tent and put their backs to it.</p>

<p>Lockyear held his rifle steady, and seemed to find satisfaction
in this swift changing of people into beasts. "I said I'd show you
something. Always the same. In about ten-fifteen minutes they'll
start fallin'. Then it's over, but we might get rushed first. Don't
shoot. Use the barrel over their heads."</p>

<p>"Indian skull hard?"</p>

<p>"No harder than a white's."</p>

<p>"I never hit a white man over the head."</p>

<p>"Try out on one of these then you'll know."</p>

<p>"Brain him?"</p>

<p>"Hell, yes."</p>

<p>Part of the crowd moved toward the pack horse, searching for
more liquor; the horse reared up in sudden fright at the confusion
and a Molala, whipping out a knife, slit its throat in a single
motion. "Now, then," said Lockyear, "that's blood and more's to
follow. Watch sharp." Women wavered slow and sullen along the grass
toward the tents. A pair of bucks fell into a fight over an empty
jug and a knife appeared in one man's fist and left its bright red
track, yard long, diagonally over the other man's body. Up the
street another buck lifted a gun and fired at the crowd and
somebody let out a short cry and dropped and next moment the crowd,
hunting fresh trouble, came about and advanced toward Lockyear and
Rinearson.</p>

<p>Two Molalas came crouched, came running. "Yours," murmured
Lockyear. He stepped aside; he gave Rinearson a clear field and the
younger man, raising the barrel of his rifle, brought it smashing
down into the first Molala's head. The Indian pitched forward,
making no sound; his legs squirmed a moment in reflex and were
still. The second Indian gave a cry and crouched lower to rush in
but as he came on his courage ran out and he wheeled away and
afterwards the crowd gathered caution and its aimless interest
settled on a man-and-woman fight near the creek. The woman struck
steadily at the man, screaming; the man had a piece of short wood
in his hand. He knocked her back, he slashed the wood downward and
broke her arm and as she fell he came upon her and straddled her
and beat her until she made no further motion.</p>

<p>A Molala man settled and crawled a short distance on hands and
knees, and slowly capsized; and now the energy of these people went
away and they moved in slow motion to and fro, past each other;
they stepped into the creek and went down, they staggered toward
their tents and one by one they disappeared or collapsed in the
grass. Lockyear let his rifle sag and walked to an adjoining tent
and he put his head through the flap and withdrew it, motioning
Rinearson forward. He was sharp, he was laughing; he pointed into
the tent. Staring through, Rinearson saw two young squaws, half
upright on blankets, stare outward with an owl-round interest.
Rinearson straightened; he nodded at Lockyear. "They got
knives?"</p>

<p>Lockyear said, "Never handled a woman with a knife before?" He
gave his rifle to Rinearson. "Keep watch," he said, and went into
the tent and closed the flap. Whit made a walking stick of the
rifle and rested his arms on it, counting the drunk-still shapes on
the ground. He got as far as twenty-four and ceased to be
interested. The buck he had clubbed was dead. The woman beaten by
her man was dead, and there was another dead one near the creek. A
very old man walked along the grass, peering into the faces below
him; he raised his eyes to Rinearson, he looked away, and went on
with his search.</p>

<p>Lockyear came from the tent in a little while. He said, "No
knives." He let go with a long laugh and pushed Rinearson into the
tent and for a moment he observed the old Molala and he idly lifted
a gun and took a trial sight on the Indian, but presently the
notion left him and he let the gun drop. A squaw, more ancient than
the old man, crept from the timber and went on to the dead pack
horse. She studied the horse and turned about, going from one
liquor-dead man to another until she found a knife, and returned to
the horse and began to cut a chunk of meat from its ribs.</p>

<p>Lockyear got the two saddle horses from the brush, collected the
empty whisky jugs and tied them to the saddle thongs, and stopped
by the dead horse to strip it of its gear. The old squaw was in his
road. He laid his foot against her shoulder and pushed her
backward, flat into the grass, and went on with his chore.
Presently Rinearson came from the tent and the two, with jugs and
pack gear loaded around them, started down the trail. Looking back,
Lockyear saw the old buck staring at him; the squaw had returned to
her butchering.</p>

<p>When they got home Veen looked at the empty jugs. He said,
"Where's the other horse?"</p>

<p>"Indian cut its throat," said Cal.</p>

<p>Veen narrowly sized up the good humor he saw in both men, the
flicker of deviltry, the sly joke between them. "You're a couple of
God-damned fools," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry enough to eat a cat," said Cal.</p>

<p>Rinearson tossed down the pack rig and said, "See you
later."</p>

<p>"Showed you something, didn't I?" said Cal. "Want to go
again?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Whit, "Oregon City next."</p>

<p>Cal Lockyear said, "You're all right, kid," and watched Whit
ride down the trail. Veen, unfavorably listening, waited until the
boy got beyond hearing and suddenly was jealously angry. "Played
hell up there, you two. Feelin' fine, ain't you? The kid's a
jackass and he'll get you in trouble. By God, Cal, you don't learn
much. You got to bust things up whenever you feel like it. You got
to bust things up just for nothing. Someday it'll sure come
home."</p>

<p>"I'm hog hungry," said Cal and went into the cabin to find
himself a meal. A good humor kept with him during the afternoon. He
pulled the charge from his rifle and cleaned the gun thoroughly. He
sharpened his hunting knife, he cut off a chunk of bar lead and
melted it and molded a pouch of shot, he tinkered with the nipple
spring of his powder flask and, soon hungry again, he butchered out
a chunk of jerked venison and crouched against the cabin wall to
warm himself in the pale moments of sunlight, hound's body settled
into a rare interval of rest, energies for a short time soothed by
the morning's adventure; even his face&mdash;that lank copper-cast
face with its prominent bones and slate-gray eyes achieved a state
of composure. He watched a hawk sailing its steady circle around
the tip of a fir tree across the creek; he swung his head to
consider the dark mouth of the trail gaping at him from the timber
and his glance ran slowly along the base of the trees, pausing to
explore the shadows within the trees and to witness occasional
flurries of motion rippling up from the ground through the brush
tops. He dredged the day for its news.</p>

<p>Veen came to the yard. "We better knock down a couple deer while
they're fat."</p>

<p>"Do it tomorrow," said Lockyear.</p>

<p>Veen moved an old maple at the rear of the cabin and renewed his
job of bucking it into small sections of wood for the smokehouse.
In every partnership of men there was a wife and a husband, and
Veen was the wife of this partnership, the smaller, steadier man
who did the cooking, the washing, the petty chores which Cal
refused to recognize. It was not only Veen's size which cast him in
the role; the difference lay in that thoughtfulness which a
crippled man develops and it lay to an ever greater extent in the
push of Cal Lockyear's maleness. Had the two men been equally
matched in vitality the partnership would long since have dissolved
in a quarrel, for this kind of union&mdash;common along the
frontier&mdash;depended on complementary qualities; and though two
men might begin such a partnership on equal terms, the inevitable
struggle between personalities soon or late brought either a
dissolution of the partnership or an adjustment in division of
duties and authority much like that of marriage.</p>

<p>Somewhere short of twilight Lockyear rose to make a patrol
through the timber which surrounded the house and returned for
supper and stood by the fire to warm himself. By now the ease was
fading from him and he was once more at the mercy of that energy
which rapidly renewed itself and created its tensions throughout
his body; and his mood darkened and he began to stir restlessly
around the cabin floor. There was in him no cushioning layer of
reflection to absorb the shock of his impulses; there was only the
terrible immediacy of force felt and act performed, and when he
could no longer bear the cabin's confinement he seized his gun and
ranged the hills, half bent over, half trotting, pausing to crouch
and to listen, prowling. He came to the edge of the Indian camp and
lay flat, listening to Molala voices inside the tents, and when
this had satisfied him he returned home and fell asleep. In first
daylight he was in the hills again. He shot two buck deer and
dressed them and packed them to the yard; he helped Veen butcher
and slice them for curing in the smokehouse. He was preoccupied and
scarcely heard Veen speak.</p>

<p>"You workin' up to somethin' again?" Veen asked.</p>

<p>Cal went into the cabin, put a chunk of jerky into his pocket,
took his gun and started for the lower trail.</p>

<p>Veen called: "Where you goin'?"</p>

<p>He didn't answer; the flood rush of energy was again in control
of him, carrying him forward to its certain explosion. He walked
with a nervous and loose-gaited stride, head pitched down but
completely aware of his surroundings. He passed Hawn's, ignoring
the redheaded man, who sat in the doorway and watched him without
comment; he moved on through the timber toward Burnett's and as he
came near the latter's place a notion arrested him at the
clearing's margin and for a short time he listened to the ringing
of Burnett's ax somewhere near the cabin. Then he backtracked on
the trail&mdash;and moved forward again, deliberately setting his
weight into the trail's soft soil to produce a clear print;
thereafter he turned to his right and then went quietly up through
the timber of the hillside, climbing the slope until he had cut
another trail, running from Burnett's meadow into the higher ridge;
he then descended this trail, once more leaving deep-cut moccasin
prints in the dirt as far as the meadow's edge. Stepping into the
brush beside this new trail, he settled to observe Burnett
splitting rails in the yard.</p>

<p>Burnett's habits, Lockyear knew, were still a mountain man's
habits; he would watch for signs and as soon as he saw these tracks
he would trace them out and try to read the story. Lockyear found
the idea amusing and meanwhile kept his eyes on Burnett.</p>

<p>The latter drove his wedges into a cedar log, split it,
quartered it and reduced the quarters to rails. He laid the rails
in the growing pile and straightened for a moment's rest, his
glance going idly around the meadow; that was the mountain man's
suspicion still working in Burnett, never trusting silence, never
trusting calm. He let his ax fall and walked beyond the cabin and
toward the creek, passing from sight. <i>Drink of water</i>,
Lockyear thought, and waited. Burnett came into view at the edge of
the creek, and dropped to his belly. Lockyear squirmed his heels
into the ground and made himself comfortable. He calculated the
distance from this spot to the house; he reached forward to snap a
huckleberry bush for better view, and saw Burnett move back to the
yard. Burnett got his sledge, tapped a wedge into a new cedar
log&mdash;the metal ringing like a sharp-struck bell&mdash;and
straightened to begin his steady swinging. Lockyear raised his
rifle and took a long aim on Burnett's upper body, below the
shoulders and above the small of the back; he steadied the gun, not
following Burnett's motions but waiting for Burnett's body to come
into his sights. His face assumed a dry and preoccupied hunter's
cast; he checked his breathing, and in his mind he made the shot to
his satisfaction and lowered the gun; then he rose, retreated into
the timber and completed his circle. Reaching the Indian trail, he
passed through the timber between Burnett's and Lattimore's.</p>

<p>He went as far as the Lattimore clearing. Flattened behind a
tree, he observed Lattimore chinking the outer cabin wall with mud.
It was cold work on a raw day and Lattimore, never a forceful man,
plainly went at the job with half a heart, frequently pausing to
slap his long arms around the thin shirt he wore. Mrs. Lattimore
washed clothes at the back of the cabin and Edna was inside, now
and then passing across the cabin's doorway. Considerably down the
trail, from the direction of the ford, Lockyear made out a solitary
rider coming on, a short man riding a thin horse. The short man
presently turned out to be Lot White and he, dismounting before the
cabin, spoke to Lattimore and to Mrs. Lattimore and went
inside.</p>

<p>From his position, Lockyear had a poor view of the inside of the
doorway. He moved along the edge of timber until the opening was
better squared before him and through it he managed to make out the
blocky shape of Lot White and the figure of the girl. Lot had
removed his hat. Lot's arms rose and spread themselves and fell as
he talked.</p>

<p><i>Damn fool's deliverin' a sermon</i>, thought Lockyear.</p>

<p>He continued to observe this scene until both White and Edna,
shifting position, got into a corner of the cabin beyond his view.
Making a gesture of discontent, Lockyear retreated a quarter-mile
along the trail, toward Burnett's. Here he turned into the heavy
brush and threshed around it; he began to beat it down with his
feet, snatching and breaking the brush with his hands; he tramped
back and forth across an area as long and as wide as his body and
he removed his blanket coat and spread it over the beaten spot as a
mattress; and then he stepped to the edge of the trail and, placing
his glance westward through the dark aisle toward Lattimore's he
drew a rough breath and settled to a waiting. His body continued
restless and tense and occasionally, as though the waiting were
almost unbearable, he struck his fist against the coarse-ribbed
bark of the fir beside which he had posted himself.</p>

<p>"DAUGHTER," said Lot White, "I have come to speak to you."</p>

<p>Edna turned from her breadmaking chore at the table to give him
her moment of smiling attention. Her hands were dusted with flour,
her face had small patches of it, placed there when she pushed back
the wayward bits of hair falling over her forehead. She wore a
loose dress, the sleeves cut off between shoulder and elbow, and
the neck low enough to show the upper half-moon of her breasts. She
noticed the brief conflict of man against preacher within Lot and
was amused by it, and let Lot see her amusement.</p>

<p>He said, "Why don't you wear more clothes?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm working and it's warm."</p>

<p>"You ought not stir men," he said. "They're easy stirred."</p>

<p>"Then let them not trouble me."</p>

<p>"You know the ways of men," he said. "No woman around here knows
'em better."</p>

<p>"Men enough have tried to teach me."</p>

<p>"You brought 'em on to it," he said.</p>

<p>"They needn't come my way if they don't want to."</p>

<p>He removed his hat and laid it on a chair and he faced her with
a single-minded certainty as to his duty. He was powerfully built
but short and when he stood before her she seemed slightly taller,
and this bothered his vanity enough to make him rise a little on
the toes of his boots. So poised, with his stubborn nature showing
itself in the bulldog chin and in the zealot blue of his eyes, he
was to Edna a somewhat ridiculous figure. He was a man, not the
least trace of saintliness about him. He had eyes enough to see her
charm and to be bothered by it; lacking any sort of education to
set him apart from his neighbors, as Ralph Whitcomb was set apart,
he had no mystery in him to impress her.</p>

<p>"They come your way, daughter, because they're men. They can't
help it."</p>

<p>"Then it's none of my business."</p>

<p>"God made you to haul the water and hew the wood. He made your
flesh to close about man, he made you to be the tabernacle of man's
faith. But the snake crept in and now the devil finds his best
hidin' place right there in the creases of your body."</p>

<p>Edna ceased to smile. She was not offended, but her intense
practicalness rose against Lot White's rush words. "That's foolish
talk."</p>

<p>"Well, they come awhorin' after you, don't they? They do, don't
they?"</p>

<p>"Don't come tryin' to drive any snakes out of me. Go drive your
snakes out of men."</p>

<p>"It won't do. Man's frail that way. Woman has got to stand above
him. Woman's got the curse of wantin', same as a man, but woman's
got the glory of turnin' the want into somethin' else. That's what
you got to do, daughter."</p>

<p>"I don't see any curse on it," said Edna. "How'd you get your
wife if you didn't want her? Was that a curse?"</p>

<p>Lot White settled on his heels. "Never you mind about me and my
wife."</p>

<p>"Then don't you mind about me," said Edna. "I saw you looking at
me and I know what you were thinking."</p>

<p>"Cover yourself up," shouted Lot White, "so men ain't tempted.
Don't swing your hips every time a man comes along. Stand still and
let 'em pass by. You got Eve all over you. The devil's in your eyes
now amockin' me."</p>

<p>"That's smoke stinging my eyes."</p>

<p>"You got too many men around here thinkin' things. Get yourself
married, and do it soon. What you need to take the hell out of you
is ten babies nine months apart."</p>

<p>"When I get married," said Edna, "it won't be to a man wastin'
his time in other people's business." She bent forward, tolerating
Lot White, even sympathetic toward him. "Why," she said, "you must
be old&mdash;you must be forty-five; and still you go rammin'
around like a young man bad off for something."</p>

<p>Lot White's color thickened. His pale eyes flickered, his lips
grew thin between pushing jaw and heavy nose. He pointed directly
at Edna Lattimore's face and lifted his voice. "Devil&mdash;devil,
I see you in there and I'm agoin' to get you out!" He seized the
girl around the waist, he kicked her smartly across the legs with
his foot and made her cry out and stumble against him; he sank to
his knees and brought her down with him. She slapped at him,
leaving flour prints around his coat. She said, "You old fool, let
me go! Poppa&mdash;Ma&mdash;come in here!"</p>

<p>Lot drowned her cry with his roaring words. "God, come down here
come down here this minute! Here's the devil. I got my two hands
around him, and I smell him all through this room&mdash;I smell the
brimstone, I smell the burnin'."</p>

<p>"That's wind blowing ashes out of the fire," said Edna. "Let go
me."</p>

<p>He held her when she tried to rise; and since she was a strong
girl he was lifted half from his knees by her force and shifted
around on the floor. He grew crimson; perspiration formed on his
upper lips. He flung his words about the room. "O Lord, I have got
him&mdash;come now, come quick! Rid this girl! I got my arms around
him. Use my arms, Lord. Send down your lightnin' bolt. Send it
right through me. Paralyze my arms, Lord, I don't mind, but get the
devil out of this woman." Edna walloped him on the face. She got
hold of his hair and twisted a hank of it until he squirmed. "Damn
it, girl, don't do that! Lord, he's usin' her fingers to get at me!
I will stand it. I'm your servant, but how long I got to stand it?
Hit him hard so I'll know. Make her cry out when he leaves her
body. Then I'll know!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lattimore ran through the cabin's back doorway, alarmed by
the outcry. She stopped, she called: "What you adoin' there,
White?"</p>

<p>"I'm tryin' to get the devil out of your daughter!"</p>

<p>"Oh, God," screamed Mrs. Lattimore, "how'd he get there?" She
flung her apron over her head and began to cry. Lattimore, slower
moving, stepped through the front door.</p>

<p>"What the hell's goin' on here?" he said.</p>

<p>"The devil's got her," said Mrs. Lattimore. "Lend Lot a
hand."</p>

<p>"It looks to me like Lot's got her," said Lattimore. "You got
anything in you, Edna, you ain't supposed to have?"</p>

<p>"The devil!" shouted Lot.</p>

<p>"Don't see a thing," said Lattimore and broke into a long laugh.
"If this ain't the damn'dest sight I ever saw. Hang tight, Lot,
you're agoin' to get bucked off."</p>

<p>"Lord," shouted Lot, "show me a sign!" That was the end of his
calling&mdash;for Edna, gathering outrage, began to fight him. She
loosened him with a pair of hard slaps to the face; she put her
arms around him, twisted him and threw him to the floor and lay
crosswise over his squirming body. She drove her sharp elbow points
on his chest and pressed down with her weight. He tried to roll her
body around and get it beneath him but she was too much weight for
him. They were both silent, both stubborn, both breathing hard; her
hair came down across her face and she squirmed herself tighter to
him when he tried to roll her away and at last she got part of her
body over his face and used it as a pillow to shut off his
breathing. He began to kick his legs at her. Mrs. Lattimore dropped
her apron from her eyes and seized a broom and struck at Lot while
Lattimore, sagged against the doorframe, laughed until he had to
support himself. Lot released his grip and Edna got to her
feet.</p>

<p>"You plain fool," she said. "You old, ignorant, interfering
fool! Wait till I tell this story around."</p>

<p>Lot rose. He looked at his coat, he ran a hand around his face,
he drew a great breath to calm himself. "Daughter," he said, "I'm
tempted to use my fists and beat the devil out of you."</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Lattimore, "you've had fun enough and that's
all."</p>

<p>Lot White got his hat. He held it between his hands and looked
long at it, the stubborn quality fading slowly from his face. "It
was too strong for me. I wrestled, but it was too strong."</p>

<p>"You didn't get any help from the Lord, either," said Edna.</p>

<p>"It wasn't time. When time's right, he'll come. And I will call
till he does."</p>

<p>"Well, just do your calling somewhere else," said Edna.</p>

<p>Lot stared at her, slowly shaking his head. "Devil's found the
best place of all, right in you. He'll make use of you, too.
Someday when you're clear of him, you'll know it, if he ain't
ruined you by then."</p>

<p>He left the house, got on his horse and for a moment sat
undecided. He had meant to go on to the Hawn's, but he had failed
here and his energy was spent and finally he turned back on the
trail. As he rode he remembered that, looking on this girl, he had
felt a carnal impulse and for the first time a hole opened in his
armor of self-certainty. He recalled he had shouted for the Lord's
assistance in the loudest voice he owned and had got no response.
"It wasn't time," he said. "I got no right to ask questions about
it." But the robustness of his faith was shaken and he found
himself wondering. "I been a good servant, ain't I, Lord? Ain't I
worthy? You goin' to pass me by for some other servant? What ain't
I done that I ought to have done? Let me know&mdash;let me know.
Don't go away from me, don't go 'way, Lord."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter 23</h2>

<p>NOTHING disturbed Edna for long. By the time she had combed her
hair and washed her hands she had ceased to be angry with Lot White
and she returned to her breadmaking and found herself laughing. "If
he wasn't a silly sight!"</p>

<p>"You sure can wrestle," said Lattimore and went back to the
yard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lattimore gave her daughter a strange look. "You sure get
men stirred up in funny ways, but I never before saw one stirred up
that way."</p>

<p>"He's a fool," said Edna. She separated the dough and fashioned
the loaves; her face was sweetened by humor. She was pleased.</p>

<p>"All men are fools," said Mrs. Lattimore. "But they make fools
out of us, too. What you been doin' to Lot?"</p>

<p>"I guess he's just interested in my soul," said Edna and looked
at her mother and laughed again.</p>

<p>"Old boar," said Mrs. Lattimore. She tilted her head to consider
her daughter in a worried, admiring manner. "You can just look at a
man and do it. I was like you. I had 'em crazy, too. No girl had a
better time, right up to the last." Her voice acquired a light
melancholy. "But don't you wait too long. Popular girls always do.
You know what, baby? When you're young you don't like to let go the
fun."</p>

<p>"Work and trouble comes soon enough," said Edna.</p>

<p>"That's what I thought&mdash;that's what we all think. And when
you get married that's the end of it for sure. Nothin' but work,
nothin' but babies, and the old man snorin' in bed, not the same
man he was when he sparked you any more. It sure ends fast. You
want to hang onto the fun and I don't blame you. But you pass good
men by, and they marry somebody else, and pretty soon you get older
and you get scared, and you take somebody half as good as the ones
you could of had."</p>

<p>Edna was thoughtful, her lips were pursed; her fingers made
spatting sounds on the bread dough. Her mother murmured: "Who you
want most?"</p>

<p>Edna shrugged her shoulders, "Oh, I don't know."</p>

<p>"Yes you do. It's Rice. You better watch out for that
Katherine."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Edna.</p>

<p>"Yes you do."</p>

<p>"No, I don't care. It could be Moss, too."</p>

<p>"Those Rinearson's are thrifty. They'll all do well, except
Whit."</p>

<p>"I don't care about that either," said Edna.</p>

<p>"You better care. You want to live like Lattimore and I have
lived? Nothin'&mdash;nothin'&mdash;never nothin'? You think I ain't
been ashamed in front of other women most of my life? The poor
never get so dumb they can't feel bein' poor, and no woman ever
gets over havin' a shiftless man."</p>

<p>"It's not been that bad," said Edna.</p>

<p>"I could have borne it better," said Mrs. Lattimore, "if I
hadn't known that every neighbor we ever had laughed at us behind
our backs. Don't you make that mistake. God, I wish women could
know when they're young what a man's goin' to be like later. Pig in
a poke. The fancy ones say nice things and they fool you, and they
turn out poorly. The plain ones you don't want but they wind up
well off and their kids have fine things and their wives look down
on you. Don't you do it. You got it in your power now to pick what
you want. You ain't goin' to have it long, but you got it now. You
think of yourself and you pick right."</p>

<p>"All right," said Edna.</p>

<p>"They'll take what they can for nothin'. They're all like that.
If they can't get it for nothin' then they'll do it the way a woman
wants, but not till she makes 'em do it. You got to be awful hard,
Edna, because it's so easy to be soft, and men know it, and they
try."</p>

<p>"All right," said Edna, smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, don't forget it," said her mother, sharply. Then she
said, "I wasn't born yesterday," and returned to her washing in the
back yard.</p>

<p>Edna molded the last loaf into its pan and laid a damp cloth
over the pan. She washed her hands and stood in the room's center,
thinking of other things to be done; but she had lost interest and
stepped to the front doorway and stood there with restlessness
working at her. She hadn't seen Burnett for two days; except for
Lot White and her father, she had seen no man for two days and this
made her lonely. She had too much liking for people to be happy
when left by herself and moreover her own situation increasingly
troubled her. She didn't need her mother's reminder of time passing
and chances lost; these things were frequently in her mind. Neither
did she need coaching from her mother, since her own experience was
ample; but no matter how much she knew and no matter how skeptical
she might sometimes be, the pressures within her were greater than
any wisdom she might acquire, and these forced her to a decision.
If her realism rejected the notion that love was registered in
heaven, binding one man and one woman to a full and happy life, and
if she sometimes rebelled at the narrowness and monotony and
drudge-labor and blind chance of marriage, still the insistence of
her tissues drove her to it. There was no rose-glow within Edna to
soften the forty years she saw coming; she viewed the marriages
about her, the injustices, the stolid acceptance, the accumulated
resentments, the poor matchings, the rare pleasures, the things
illy hidden; and these she transferred to herself and saw her days
in much the same pattern. She could smile about it, she could be
sad about it, but rarely could she permit herself to dream of
anything better.</p>

<p>It was early afternoon. Her mother's knuckles drummed a steady
rhythm on the washboard and her father had curled himself in the
shed and was asleep. She looked at the sky to judge the weather and
left the cabin, calling back: "I'm going to Rice's."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
She traveled rapidly along the timbered Indian trail, paying no
attention to her surroundings. Her curiosity was all for people and
in people she found a fascinating variety; nature&mdash;trees or
animals or the changing colors of the earth&mdash;interested her
very little and roused neither poetry nor speculation within her.
She had Burnett on her mind; she was thinking of the things she
might say to him, of all sorts of small stratagems to soften the
gentleman's streak he frequently raised against her. Most men, but
not all men, had some of that gallant streak. So far as she could
make out it was an illusion they created to make their dream the
more desirable, to clothe the raw act of possession with some sort
of golden gauze. She didn't believe in it and frequently laughed at
it, yet she had much earlier learned that it was a weapon to be
used against men when they grew ardently unmanageable; they could
be restrained by a word or a look which threw them back on their
honor. She admired the quality in Burnett and was flattered to hear
it in his voice when he spoke to her, but as time went on she grew
impatient and now, walking along, she tried to understand him
better so that she could bring him on. Honor was well enough, but
it had nothing to do with living or eating or making babies.</p>

<p>The trail took her around a bend and, raising her glance from
the ground, she saw Lockyear ahead, one shoulder against a tree,
gun half lifted at some object in the timber. On this he appeared
to have his attention when she reached him and stopped. "What's
there?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Was a bobcat. Gone now."</p>

<p>"They harmless?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "Nothing around here to trouble you this early in the
winter. Later, take care walking through the place&mdash;there'll
be wolves and cougar around, hungry enough to jump." He lowered his
gun and his rough gray glance struck her and she saw how tense he
was behind his seeming idleness. She guessed at once that he had
been waiting for her and her sureness came back and she watched him
with her covert smiling. Recognizing the amusement, he turned his
attention to the timber with a curtness that offended her. She
moved on.</p>

<p>Yet she could not quit him this way, no matter what her better
judgment told her. Her curiosity was too much stirred and her need
to have better command of him too urgent. She swung and caught his
eyes on her; that revived her amusement. "Oh, no. It was no bobcat
that brought you here."</p>

<p>"No," he admitted coolly, "it was no bobcat." He stared at her
gravely, observing the willful certainty upon her and the old, old
knowledge harbored in her eyes. "I've been here a couple hours,
waiting for you."</p>

<p>"How'd you know I'd come?"</p>

<p>"Sooner or later you'd come."</p>

<p>"Might have been days."</p>

<p>"I can wait days if my mind's made up," he said. He set his gun
against the nearby tree and faced her. "I shouldn't have kissed
you."</p>

<p>"It didn't do you any harm," she said tartly. "But don't blame
me for it."</p>

<p>"You don't know me," he said.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said skeptically, "you're no different than the rest.
I know what's in your head right now."</p>

<p>He looked beyond her, his powder-colored eyes catching the low
light seeping into the woods. He was for that short time unusually
thoughtful.</p>

<p>He brought his attention back to her. "This is what I came here
to tell you. If you've got no interest in me&mdash;pay no more
attention to me at all. None of your looks or your smiles, nothing
of that kind to give me notions. If it's only fooling, as you do
with other men, I want none of it. I don't fetch and carry like
these settler boys. I don't dance in and dance back like a trained
bear. Men have found me dangerous when they crossed me. You'll find
me the same way if you're just havin' your fun. I say it again to
you, let me alone if you mean nothing."</p>

<p>She tossed up her head, prepared to be high with him, for her
pride was offended by his blunt speech; but as she studied the
combination of intensity and stubbornness he displayed she changed
her manner. Curiosity bested her again&mdash;curiosity and that
heavy appetite which a man's interest always set into motion. She
said, half irritated and half kind, "Don't put yourself in my way
and you'll not be troubled."</p>

<p>"A woman's got a thousand tricks," he said; "a man's got damned
few. Use none on me or you'll regret it."</p>

<p>She gave him a narrowed glance, and her sense of intrigue was
strong within her; and suddenly&mdash;to challenge him or perplex
him or keep him further in excitement&mdash;she said, "I'll do
whatever comes to my mind," and laughed at him.</p>

<p>He seized her arm, whirled her and caught her at the waist,
dragging her back to the tree and past it into the brush and to the
beaten-down place where the blanket lay. She fought with him, not
speaking or crying out; she fought with her hands and with her
feet, she tried to drive her elbows into him and to butt her
shoulders against him. He got her to the blanket and released her.
"Stop it," he warned, "or I'll knock you down."</p>

<p>As soon as she noticed the blanket coat on the ground she went
at him again, compelled not only by anger but by the outrage of a
woman who, however generous she was, had always been in command of
herself. What Lockyear violated was her deep-rooted sense of
mastery over men. She arched her fingers and clawed his face, she
kicked him on the legs, she seized his reaching arm and bit into
it. Then he got her around the waist and threw her roughly to the
blanket and pinned her arms and laid a knee lightly against her
stomach. "Stop it," he said. He bent down to kiss her; she threw
her head into his nose and lips, drawing blood. He slapped her
twice full-force across the jaw.</p>

<p>That was the end of her fight. She said, "Oh, no," and closed
her eyes and rolled her head aside.</p>

<p>He got her beneath the shoulders and shook her and he said in a
rising voice, "I don't trust you. You've got every trick there is.
Open your eyes&mdash;don't play possum." She said nothing and his
voice came at her, still rising, growing rougher. "Stop playin'
with me. You're not hurt."</p>

<p>When he slid his hands to either side of her face she opened her
eyes. He was quite close to her, so close that she noticed for the
first time the smallness of his lips against the rest of his face,
the suggestion of the sensuous and the savage in them. There was no
peace anywhere on his features, no light, no sympathy, no relief
from the combination of self-centered anger and melancholy. He
stared at her. He murmured, "Do what I tell you. Always do it." He
was gentle at this moment. He lowered his face and kissed her with
a lightness that puzzled her; but she saw the anger move cloudy
over him again. "Give me something back." That was the end of his
gentleness. He dropped his mouth on her and bore down, rolling it
back and forth over her, shaking her with his arms, giving out
queer half-grunted sounds, and when he failed to move her from her
passive silence he raised himself on his arms and cursed her.</p>

<p>"Have I got to beat it out of you? Have I got to strangle you?"
Then that gust of anger passed and he put his cheek against her
head, whispering, "If I were a dumb ox I'd never look at you, but
I've got to have you. There's no man ever looks at you that don't
wish he had you, and I'm the same. No, I'm different. The rest of
'em have not got the nerve to do more than wish. Come up to me
now."</p>

<p>She met his self-centered stare and remained silent beneath him.
He dug his fingers into her shoulders and wrapped his arms about
her and drew her to him; he let her drop back and the bilked
desperation went through him with its particular agony. He groaned
and smashed his fist into the earth beside her; he fell silent, his
breath hard-laboring against her; he grew quiet and talkative. "You
could pick me up in the hollow of your hand and carry me to hell
and gone," he said. "What's my life now? It's walkin' through these
hills. It's eatin' and sleepin' and growin' older. It's a damned
trap and I'm a animal inside a fence, goin' round and round till my
feet hit the trap, and then I'm done. I have got more in me than
ten men but it won't come out. There's nothin' to bring it out.
They think I'm a wild man. Sure I'm a wild man. If I was happy to
see nothin', think nothin', do nothin'&mdash;I wouldn't be wild. I
have got to have you."</p>

<p>He bent down to kiss her again and his talk came muttering from
him. "You want a better man than Moss. Or Burnett. I'd wear out
that body&mdash;that's what you want. I prowl these hills same as a
wolf. I can walk softer than a wolf. You come with me and there'll
be no prowlin'. Listen to the way I talk. You can hear the creek in
me, can't you? You can hear the wind and the rain. Lightnin's in
there, too, and all the damned Sioux in the hills hellin'. You can
even hear murder if you listen for it but don't listen for it and
it won't be there. Come up to me now. Turn into me. Give me
somethin' when I kiss you. Then you'll know what I am." He settled
on her, waiting; but when he realized the waiting wouldn't bring
anything from her, he flung himself back and rose cursing. He
seized her by the arm and hauled her to her feet; he gave her a
shove that unbalanced her. She caught herself and walked out to the
road and stood still, looking back at him.</p>

<p>She was no longer afraid of him but neither was she indifferent
toward him. She was a little bit dazed by a handling far more
intense than any other man had displayed; and though she resented
his domineering manner, her appetite, much more powerful than her
reason, responded to Lockyear. She said softly: "Why didn't you do
what you meant to?"</p>

<p>"I don't want anything. You've not got it. You're nothing to me.
It's all on your face. It don't go any deeper. You're a board wall
painted pretty, but there's nothing behind the wall."</p>

<p>She watched him steadily; "You don't know," she said.</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"No you don't," she said. "You're like all the rest."</p>

<p>"I'm not like any man you ever ran into," he said. "By God, I'd
get tired of that smilin' that don't mean anything. I'd probably
trade you for a squaw."</p>

<p>She started to speak&mdash;and checked herself, and went down
the trail toward her house. Twenty feet away she heard him call
her; she turned.</p>

<p>"Next time do better by me."</p>

<p>"What next time?"</p>

<p>"I mean to have you," he said. "You're trying to fool with me
now, same as you do with everybody else. It's too late. I won't be
fooled with. I am going to teach you how it is."</p>

<p>She went on. At the trail's bend she looked over her shoulder to
find him still following her with his glance; then she moved out of
his sight, straightening and brushing her clothes; she touched her
cheek and felt the tenderness where he had struck her and her eyes
narrowed at the memory. She crossed the meadow to the cabin.</p>

<p>Her mother said: "Quick trip." Then she gave her daughter a
closer inspection. "What bruised your face? It's all red."</p>

<p>"Walked into a branch," said Edna.</p>

<p>She went on with her work, silent and preoccupied. In late
afternoon she left the cabin, arms crossed before her, and traveled
the trail idly toward the Irish ford, walking simply to be walking.
It was dusk when she got back. Her mother said: "Where you been?"
She shook her head and was silent through supper; she did the
dishes and, still saying nothing, she slipped on a heavy coat and
stepped into the night. Her mother came to the doorway, calling
after her. "Where you goin' now?"</p>

<p>"Rice's."</p>

<p>The earth breathed its fog around her, its silky sensations
tickling her face. In such still, thick air the creek seemed
farther away and the hoarse rustling music of the frogs came muted
about her. Distant in the timber she heard a lumbering bear move
carelessly through the brush but she had no concern. Beyond the
bend she caught the blurred winkling of Burnett's cabin light and
soon came to his door and knocked on it. At the sound of his voice
she opened the door and found him lying dressed on his bunk, so
turned that the firelight fell on a book he had been reading.
"You're comfortable," she said, and smiled at him. "And you
oughtn't be. What's that you've got?"</p>

<p>"<i>The Miller's Practical Guide</i>. I'm figuring how to put
this thing together."</p>

<p>"Just let the stones grind against each other. Is it hard?"</p>

<p>"You want flour or you want cracked chicken feed?"</p>

<p>"It's not those things I want. You're practical tonight. You
always practical?"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Now," he said.</p>

<p>She watched him a moment. "You're fooling me." She looked to the
floor. "You've got the floor in. It's nice and smooth."</p>

<p>"Sawed blanks instead of split logs. Then I used the plane. No
splinters."</p>

<p>She settled on the edge of the bunk and reached down to unlace
her shoes; she moved her feet back and forth on the floor. "That's
good&mdash;that's good," she said, and closed her eyes. "I'd never
wear shoes in here." She had her back to him; he hooked his arm
around her waist and she swung her head and looked down. She was
serious, she was alert. He tightened the pressure of his arm. She
said, "You're different."</p>

<p>He drew his arm away. She laughed at him and seized his arm and
replaced it where it had been. "You're slow." He pulled at her,
drawing her back against him. She resisted him gently, she mocked
him, murmuring: "I let you have something and now you're
brave."</p>

<p>"Edna..."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;don't talk&mdash;yes." She turned about, very easy in
her motions, rolled herself on the bunk and settled comfortably
against him.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
"Cold?"</p>

<p>"No. Things don't bother me. You want to talk now?"</p>

<p>"No." He felt the tremor of amusement in her body. "What's
that?"</p>

<p>"It's a sure cure for talk. All those funny things in your head
go right away. You're just happy. That ought to show you something,
Rice."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You make too much out of things. It's just this. There's
nothing else."</p>

<p>He didn't answer and presently she said: "Don't you think
so?"</p>

<p>"Must be a few other things. People can't stay in bed fifty
years."</p>

<p>"Oh, working and raising a family, and a dance now and then, and
worrying about money, and fighting sometimes. Sure. But you know
what I mean. I mean hunting for something that's not there. I used
to take a needle and pick away the center of a daisy just to see
where it began. When I got it picked away there wasn't any
beginning. It was all gone. That's what I mean." She settled closer
to him. "I could go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Go ahead and sleep."</p>

<p>"Then I wouldn't wake up till morning."</p>

<p>"Think so?" Then they were both laughing and in a rough gust of
affection she drew her arms around him.</p>

<p>"Proud of yourself," she said. She was warm and heavy; her heart
beat steady against his chest, her mouth settled into the side of
his neck; she patted him much as a mother would soothe a baby. She
was sleepy, she was restless. "Talk to me."</p>

<p>"You don't like talk."</p>

<p>"Not before. It just drives me crazy, waiting while you talk.
Now I like it&mdash;afterwards."</p>

<p>"You're good."</p>

<p>"I know it." Then she said, "Oh, you mean the other kind of
good, nice good, afraid good, lady good? No. I'm just what I am and
you can't make me out anything else. Talk to me."</p>

<p>"Beautiful Edna."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's dreaming. You're only seeing what you want to see.
Men say that to girls before they're married. They don't say it to
their wives. I'm not ugly but I'm not beautiful."</p>

<p>He said: "Who'd wear out first?"</p>

<p>"That's years off. There's lots of time to do this."</p>

<p>"Time's not a steady thing. You can't depend on it. One time on
the Sonora Desert my outfit marched all day in the sun. Five men
died. I remember that. I remember a few other things that happened
to me. I'll remember this. This hour. That's all we've got&mdash;a
dozen or two dozen things that stick. Add those things together and
maybe they covered a month of our lives. All the important things
lumped into a month. The rest of our lives&mdash;maybe forty
years&mdash;we don't do much worth remembering."</p>

<p>"Don't. Don't think like that. Don't think. How many other
times, like this, with other girls, stick in your mind?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Everybody lies about that."</p>

<p>"Same reason everybody wears clothes."</p>

<p>"You believe in Adam and Eve?"</p>

<p>"I think that's one way of saying there was nothing bad until
people made sin in their heads."</p>

<p>"Old people. It's always old people that say things are bad.
This isn't bad. I don't feel it that way. You don't either, do
you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She was silent a moment. Her hand, so steadily tapping his
shoulder, fell still and he sensed a change move through her; he
sensed it in her motionlessness, in the currents flowing out of
her; it was as though a damper came down to shut off the warmth.
She said: "You've changed. I mean, now you're sure you can have me.
Like a wife."</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>"Now it's easy, no trouble at all."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "that's not it."</p>

<p>She lifted herself to an elbow and put her hand against the side
of his face and turned it into the light; she was solemn, she was
critical. She gripped his hair and lifted his head and dropped it,
murmuring, "Just easy, no trouble. Damn, damn you. Oh, Rice." She
settled against him. "I ought never have let you have it."</p>

<p>He held her in. "That's not it," he said.</p>

<p>"I guess it's just me," she said. "But I can't help being what I
am. If I thought I was wrong maybe I'd change. Maybe not&mdash;I
don't know. I think about old people. People that don't do this any
more. You see any of them make love, or look at each other, or rub
together, or anything? No. It goes away when they're old. Those
words they said about love being forever&mdash;I wonder what they
think about those words now? It don't last that long. It goes when
this goes. Then they just live together and the things they said
are silly."</p>

<p>As he held her he realized he had lost some of her and he
remembered what Hawn had said about Louisa going across the
boundary, beyond reach. It was the same here. <i>They're all
Louisas</i>, he thought. He got the notion that she had removed
herself from him, had turned to look back at him in a new light;
that suddenly she had discovered something in him she hadn't
noticed before. There was a sense of waiting in her strong enough
to pull at him, and as time went on, she motionless in his arms,
the feeling grew into a strain.</p>

<p>She broke it at last by a short motion back from him, by an
impatient rising to her elbow. She looked at him in a way that was
absent-minded, distant from him. She said, "You're
funny&mdash;you'll always be," and when she left the bed and moved
across the room he felt he had failed her.</p>

<p>"Come back," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm going home."</p>

<p>"Come back."</p>

<p>"Talk, talk. No."</p>

<p>She was preoccupied and she had a different expression on her
face settled, tired, determined. She said, more to herself than to
him, "No use wasting time on what won't happen. There's not that
much time to waste."</p>

<p>He got up. "I'll take you home."</p>

<p>"You don't need to."</p>

<p>He said nothing. He freshened the fire while she put on her
shoes; he left the cabin and went across the meadow with her, and
trailed her through the timber as far as Lattimore's clearing. When
he put his arms around her he received from her the impression that
she was impatient with him. The warmth and willingness weren't
there. He had meant to kiss her but he drew back embarrassed and
even her quick smile didn't help, and the kindness of her words
made him feel too young. "People don't change. A lot of misery
comes from thinking they do."</p>

<p>"What's that mean?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Did you like me tonight?"</p>

<p>"My God, Edna, what a hell of a word for it. I wish..."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"I wish you did."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "you're just trying to make something plain into
something complicated. I'm glad you liked me, though. You should
have. You had your way. Remember&mdash;you had your way. That's
what you wanted and you got it&mdash;but you don't know what you
want. Don't forget&mdash;you had your way. Good night."</p>

<p>She went on before he had time to answer. Going back through the
timber, he felt the barb of her last remark work itself into him
and he realized then he would never shake it free. The remark was
unfair. She had been willing&mdash;it was her way as much as his
way. It was even on both sides. <i>No</i>, he thought, <i>it never
is. Makes no difference whether a man's in love with a woman, half
in love with her, or not at all in love with her. Once he gets that
thing from her, there's no giving it back. The thing's done and
he's mixed up with her. From that time on, he's accountable.</i>
Lying with him on the bunk, she had waited for him to understand
it. He had failed her.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Her father was asleep; her mother waited up. She gave Edna a
searching study. "What was it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Edna.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, baby, I told you not to&mdash;I told you not to. You
went to him too much."</p>

<p>"I won't be what I'm not," said Edna.</p>

<p>"If he hurt you, baby, I'll go slap his face raw. You're as good
as any girl around here."</p>

<p>"That's not it," said Edna. "I'd just get weary of being
something I couldn't be, and he'd get tired of me as soon as he
found he'd fooled himself and he'd think I'd fooled him and I
couldn't stand that."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lattimore came over and put her arms around her daughter.
She was sentimental, she was half in tears. "My poor baby&mdash;my
poor baby. I'd like to cut his damned heart out." Edna said nothing
and in a short while Mrs. Lattimore drew back and gave her daughter
a curious glance. "Why don't you just let it go and have a
cry?"</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Edna and turned away.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said Mrs. Lattimore, "I think you got no
feelin'."</p>

<p>"I've got feeling all right," said Edna in a rare moment of
candor. "I've got so much feeling that I like men too much. I'm
just sloppy with feeling. I know what I am. I don't hold back like
Katherine does. What's she? No different than me, but Rice thinks
she is, because she holds back. If I held back he'd think I was
different too. But what's the good of that? It wouldn't last.
Afterwards he'd still have his funny ideas. She's just as much a
slut as any."</p>

<p>"Baby&mdash;baby," said Mrs. Lattimore, "don't say it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Edna sullenly, "there's that in all of us and I
won't pretend, like she does. If it's there, it's there. I didn't
put it there and I won't cry about it. I won't be ashamed of it
either. I'll get married to a man that's satisfied with me just
like I am. I'll be good enough for him&mdash;I know how to do that,
I know how to do it better than girls that pretend. I'm going down
to stay with Irene Shafer. Might stay two days."</p>

<p>She left after breakfast, walking the four miles across the ford
and through the end of the notch to the Shafer place. She went over
for a while at Daniel Rinearson's, to leave her mother's good
wishes with Mrs. Rinearson. That night Moss Rinearson dropped in at
the Shafers and the two went for a walk. By the time they returned
to Shafers, she had kissed Moss and she had given him courage
enough to ask the proper question and she had taken him.</p>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter 24</h2>

<p>BURNETT reached Lattimore's in the graying afternoon and joined
the neighbors standing in semicircle before the cabin. Everybody
was here, even Hawn, even the Lockyears. Billy Lord drifted toward
him, murmuring, "Hell, Rice, I thought she was your woman," and
stared at him with his eager curiosity and walked on. A fire burned
in the yard and a coffeepot hung over it; and he heard Katherine,
close by, say, "She's pretty." Edna came from the cabin and joined
Moss, and the two came before Lot White.</p>

<p>Lot said: "Neighbors, we're here to make a marriage," and began
the ceremony at once.</p>

<p>Burnett lowered his head and felt a rough inner wind blow him
empty.</p>

<p>Maybe he had been mistaken. What else could he have wanted? She
was the warm room into which, tired and lonely, he could have gone,
closing the door behind. He heard Lot White finish the words of
marriage; he watched Moss, embarrassed by the crowd, kiss his
wife.</p>

<p>"Now then, you two," said Lot White, "put away the fancies of
bein' single and lay by your notions you can go on doin' what
you've done before. It's a young man's nature to hunt and girl's
way to run ahead of the hunter. That's the wine, and the wine's
good so long as it lasts. But it don't last long. The Lord gave you
your runnin', and this is the end of it, so make your hearts firm
and your minds steady, for life is aketchin' up and you have got to
do what you're supposed to do. What's these older women cryin' for
now&mdash;what's these gray-haired men lookin' solemn for? Because
they know what young was, what no care was, but that was a long
time ago. They had it one time. They ain't got it now. You had it
till this minute. You ain't goin' to have it any more. You shall be
useful, and sweat and pain's comin' with it. You shall struggle and
your hearts are agoin' to break, and mend, and break some more. It
may be you'll have peace and plenty, and only small trouble, but
don't count on it, for Beulah Land is on the other shore, it ain't
here. There's only one thing in this world, and you've got to learn
it. You have got to endure; you have got to endure."</p>

<p>Edna, with her pleasant half-smile, seemed to pay full
attention, but Burnett knew most of her thoughts would be
elsewhere. She was her own world, no other world half so
interesting to her. The smile held on, meaning anything,
everything, nothing; it was the same smile which, looking down upon
him with its affection in the cabin, had at the same time concealed
her decision to leave him. He looked away from her, not wanting to
see her again in that particular attitude, softened by that
particular light.</p>

<p>"O Lord," said Lot Whit; "come down here on these people. Open
the doors of darkness just a crack and let them see light. Not too
much light, O Lord, or you'll blind 'em, for they're mortal and
they can't stand the full light. Just a little."</p>

<p>Turning his glance about, Burnett noticed how tired his
neighbors appeared to be; they stood faded within their clothes and
upon them was the silence of worry rather than of peace. He knew
them all, their names, habits and values; they were strongly
themselves, like sharp separate pickets sticking up from the earth,
of unequal length and thickness, no picket being like another. Yet
as he continued to watch they became something else to him, their
separateness blurring into oneness, the bent heads and stilled
bodies joining into a yeasty lump which clung to the earth and
spread shapeless over the earth.</p>

<p>Lot White said, "Amen," and voices rose around Burnett. He heard
the sudden disturbing laugh of Cal Lockyear, an insolent laugh
meant to draw attention. He noticed Lucy Collingwood's expression
of fixed and heavy unhappiness.</p>

<p>Lucy was more than unhappy. She was lost within herself and
could find no way out. She thought of Moss and Edna: "He'll cause
her no trouble. She'll manage him and he'll never know what's in
her head, but he'll never be very curious. But why wasn't it Rice?"
Lucy tried a short side-glance toward Rice and saw nothing on his
face, but her active imagination supplied him with a broken heart
and pity rose to touch off her own loneliness. "We're all standing
here wanting things we can't have." Invisible strings crossed this
yard, dozens of them, leading from one person to another. Back and
forth the strings ran until they wove a web in which everybody was
caught; respectability made them lie quietly in the web but hope
cried at them to tear free. Looking at Katherine, she thought: "She
ought to be glad it's turned out this way."</p>

<p>Katherine heard little of Lot White's sermon. She watched Roxy
Kitchen move forward step by step until she stood directly behind
Moss and Edna, the girl's interest in the scene for a little while
making her unaware of herself. Ragged, homely, simpleminded and
disregarded, she fed her greedy soul on what she saw. Katherine
thought: "Poor thing&mdash;poor, poor little thing." It was only a
short break in her main thought. What did Moss mean to Edna?
Nothing. Nothing but a man to marry. Why wasn't it Rice? Edna had
wanted Rice. She had done everything to get Rice. Everything. She
turned slightly to catch another quick sight of Burnett, and turned
back. It was hard to tell what he thought. "I'll wonder about it
till I die," she said to herself. She was sorry for Moss, poor Moss
with his young man's belief that he had won Edna by his own effort,
or that he had won her at all. In his bed she would be a stranger,
though he'd never know it.</p>

<p>Old Gram stirred beside her, thinking: "She'll shrivel him up
and suck him dry and spit him out like a seed. She's had a dozen
men and she'll have a dozen more." Mrs. Buck thought: "A baby every
ten months until she can't drag herself around, and they'll run
wild, no care from her shiftless and dirty and no-account." George
Collingwood, dreaming of the touch of her mouth, condemned himself
for his poor effort and believed he could have had her. Mrs. Irish
said a kind prayer and from her own experience she saw the misery
coming to Edna, and then the worry settled down again and she
wondered how she and her son would survive the winter. Mrs. Millard
whispered to her husband, "Now, she'll learn what it's like to be a
slave." Martha Gay thought: "Well, she's married," and the feeling
of satisfaction which came to her was the same feeling shared by
all the older people around her. As a girl ready for marriage and
needing marriage, Edna had troubled them by her conduct, for their
realism made them see much and guess more. She violated their
concept of usefulness; she was a girl who ought to be at the
business of making her family. There was a form to be observed and
since all others had fitted themselves to it she could not be the
exception without bringing against her the quiet pressures of the
group. It was this pressure which, as much as her own need, brought
about this marriage, and now that she was inside the stockade of
their general customs much would be forgiven her and much
allowed.</p>

<p>Women immediately surrounded the newly married, their silence
erupting into voluble talk. The men delayed their congratulations a
little while, forming their own group.</p>

<p>Old Daniel Rinearson said: "I'd give a lot for a keg of
whisky."</p>

<p>"There's coffee yonder," said Lattimore.</p>

<p>"Coffee's for warm, and I ain't cold. Whisky's for fun."</p>

<p>Lockyear came up, his brother Veen trailing him. Cal said: "You
want whisky?"</p>

<p>"I said <i>whisky,</i>" answered Old Daniel. "When I want half
blue vitriol and half gun oil I'll make my own."</p>

<p>Lockyear said: "That gut of yours could stand anything."</p>

<p>"It's my gut, and you keep your stuff for the Molallies. Don't
you know that's makin' trouble without need?"</p>

<p>"I'll make what I want to make," said Lockyear. "Keep your
damned mouth shut to me."</p>

<p>Old Daniel straightened his turkey-cock shape. His jaw moved
forward, his scarlet color quickened, and he set the anger of his
eyes on Lockyear. Lockyear stared back. "Old man," he said, "that's
a bluff. You ain't got the mustard."</p>

<p>"The hell I ain't," said Old Daniel. But it was, for him, a
quiet answer, an answer not in keeping with his known character,
and the feeling of witnessing something improper came again to
Burnett as it had when Lockyear had treated Lorenzo Buck the same
way at Gay's meeting. Old Daniel looked around to see his oldest
son, Ared, move beside him. He gave Ared a short nod. "That's a
comfort." Then he turned his attention to Whit who was a little
behind Lockyear. "Come over here."</p>

<p>Whit avoided his father's eyes. The lightly flushed face took on
balkiness. He shrugged his shoulders and he tried a smile which
faded as he became aware of the hard-watching and the
hard-listening of the crowd. Cal Lockyear laughed at him. "Well,
boy, your pa's callin'." Whit's stubborn embarrassment increased.
He flung up his head and gave Old Daniel a resenting glance; he
said something nobody understood and whirled about and walked
away.</p>

<p>Burnett thought: "The yellow son-of-a-bitch." Old Daniel had
been punched through by this blow and he showed the hurt. The
stillness in the circle got worse. Nobody moved and nobody said
anything until Cal Lockyear's voice grated them with its
malice.</p>

<p>"You want a drink, Rice?"</p>

<p>"I'll say when," said Burnett.</p>

<p>Lockyear laughed. He pointed to Edna among the women. "Why
wasn't you standin' in Moss's shoes?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when the time comes," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"I guess you forgot to say when," said Lockyear, and laughed
again. But the carelessness spread only as far as his eyes. He
moved gently on his feet, keeping nimble. He had some liquor in him
and knew it, and he guarded himself. "You ever say when?" He walked
toward Lattimore's lean-to barn at the edge of the meadow. Veen
limped after him.</p>

<p>Ryal McIver spoke to Burnett in a mild, careful voice: "Wasn't
he sayin' something to you, Rice?"</p>

<p>The soft question brought men's glances to him and he knew what
they were thinking. "That's right," he said.</p>

<p>"I didn't quite make out what he was sayin'," said Ryal,
gently.</p>

<p>"You heard it," said Burnett.</p>

<p>Old Daniel hauled himself from his heavy thoughts. "Well," he
said to Gay, "we ought to get some crews together one of these days
and start road work."</p>

<p>Burnett left the circle, moving toward the creek. Behind him Old
Daniel said, "Now, take care," and he turned to see Ared Rinearson
walking toward Whit. Ared came before his brother and he said
something which brought up Whit's head and drew an angry answer.
Ared took half a step back, raised his fist and slammed it into
Whit's face; the younger man lost his balance and fell on his
buttocks. He came up like an angry cat, he made half a rush at Ared
and checked himself and he stood a long moment before his brother,
saying nothing, and at last wheeled and walked deeper into the
meadow. The circle broke and men moved around the yard, toward the
coffee, toward the horses, toward the new bride and groom.</p>

<p>Burnett flattened himself at the creek. He wanted a lot of water
but he took a short drink and rose and turned back. Katherine was
at the corner of the cabin. She looked at him; she looked away from
him. "Go kiss the bride," she said idly.</p>

<p>He pointed to her hand. "What's that cut?"</p>

<p>"A dull knife. You want some coffee?"</p>

<p>"No." He took her hand and ran a finger along the scar; he
reversed it and saw the small calluses in her palm. "Been swinging
an ax?"</p>

<p>"Dad doesn't feel good." She grew restless; she pulled the hand
away.</p>

<p>Lockyear was still standing near the lean-to with his brother.
Burnett watched him a little while, thinking: <i>He'll fight
alligator-style, hands and feet and thumbs. His gun's hanging on
the horse, but he's got a knife and he might use it. Hit him in the
belly first. If I go down he'll try to kick my brains out. Watch
him when he walks toward his horse. He might use the gun. He pushed
twice&mdash;now he thinks it's easy. He'll try it. He's figuring
how to start it.</i></p>

<p>Katherine said: "What's in the air? What's wrong with
Lockyear?"</p>

<p>"Feeling mean," said Rice.</p>

<p>"You're feeling mean, too. I know that snaky look. You two
quarreled?"</p>

<p>"No," said Rice. "He just needs a fight."</p>

<p>"You need a fight?" she said.</p>

<p>"Have to take one if it's offered."</p>

<p>Old Daniel pushed himself through the crowd to Edna and led her
beyond earshot.</p>

<p>"Daughter," he said, "I want you to know I'm glad you're in my
family. Moss ain't a fool. He's reliable. He'll take care of you.
Treat him well."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said Edna.</p>

<p>Old Daniel's wrinkles of smartness sank deeper into his face.
"You got a baby started?"</p>

<p>Her pleasant expression broadened; she laughed at him.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "once I was young and did my chasin' and I know
how these things are. It could be you got a baby started. It could
be it ain't Moss that started it, too. You're a big girl all over
and when the urge comes, it sure comes. I want you to know that if
you're foolin' me I halfways know it and I don't care. Moss ought
to take care of you. If he does, you stick with him and give him no
trouble. If he don't do it enough to make you happy, I wouldn't
blame you much for findin' an extra man." He shook his head and
sighed out his regret. "By God, I wish I was young enough to make
you a run."</p>

<p>She bent forward and gave him a kiss and stood back, smiling at
the brisk scurry of interest about his face as he turned away. She
remained where she was, noting that Katherine had left Rice. She
looked at Rice and waited for his glance to come to her; and she
grew tired of waiting and went over to him.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd come to wish me well," she said.</p>

<p>"I wish you well."</p>

<p>"You knew I'd do it, didn't you? You knew it when I left your
place the other night."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"If you're sad, I'm awful sorry. But I don't think you're as sad
as you think you are." The shortsighted and wondering glance came
to her eyes. At such times, not so certain of herself, she had a
soft, faithful expression which made him believe he had missed much
that was in her; and these were the times when he drew nearer to
her and regret moved through him with its suggestion of love. She
shrugged her shoulders and gave him a small laugh. "Well, it's just
more talk. It'll do no good. We never get anywhere with it. It had
to be done."</p>

<p>He looked at her in a sharper way. "If it had to be done, I
should have been told about it."</p>

<p>"I don't mean that. I mean it was time for me to marry."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I guess I've got nothing to say."</p>

<p>She sobered; she took on a dignity before him. "It's my problem,
it's not yours. Why do you care? You didn't before&mdash;not much.
You had your way. If there's been a mistake made, it's your
mistake. Remember that. It was your mistake."</p>

<p>"Maybe it was," he said. "Clear back to Oregon City, maybe it
was."</p>

<p>She looked about her and saw Moss moving in. She said hurriedly:
"Oh God, Rice, why do we just look at each other and make mistakes?
You like me a little don't you?"</p>

<p>"If there's anything you ever want from me, tell me."</p>

<p>"I'll see you," she said, "I'll see you soon." Then Moss walked
over and said, "We better start home pretty soon." He didn't look
directly at Burnett. He took the girl's arm and moved toward the
cabin.</p>

<p>Ben Provost came through the crowd to Burnett. "Powell Baily
said he heard Lockyear say he was going to tree a coon."</p>

<p>"Where's the coon?"</p>

<p>"Cal was lookin' in your direction when he mentioned it."</p>

<p>Lockyear, at the moment, walked in from the lean-to, his knees
stiff when he struck ground with his boots. <i>He's got a pint of
that stuff burning a hole in his belly</i>, Burnett thought. He
crossed the yard and joined John Gay and the half-dozen men around
Gay. Lockyear walked toward Edna who stood by the doorway. She
noticed his approach and turned into the cabin, and Moss shifted
around and blocked the doorway, trying to make the act casual. Veen
overtook his brother and spoke to him and Cal swung and came on to
Burnett.</p>

<p>"You want a drink now?"</p>

<p>"I'll say when."</p>

<p>"Man," said Lockyear, "the word's not in your head." He seemed
for a moment to forget Burnett; he stared at Moss Rinearson at the
doorway. "Now there's a man who said when."</p>

<p>"Let it alone, Cal," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"She said when, too," Lockyear went on. "She'll say when any
time..."</p>

<p>Burnett stepped on, struck him in the stomach; and as the man
broke backward, half bent over, Burnett advanced to hook a leg
behind Lockyear and drop him. Lockyear struck, squirmed like a cat,
and flung himself to his feet. He let go with a crowing cry, he
shouted, "Here's my coon," and poised himself for a rush.</p>

<p>Men rushed forward with their released eagerness to make a
circle, closing Cal and Burnett within it, closing Veen Lockyear
out of it. Veen yelled, "Let me in there&mdash;watch out,
Cal&mdash;let me in!" He rammed into Powell Baily. Powell wrapped
Veen in his arms, revolved three times and flung the little man
into the meadow.</p>

<p>"Here's my coon," said Cal and laughed and made a forward run.
Burnett stooped low, body clipping Lockyear across the waist. He
gripped Lockyear by the legs, came up with him and threw him
sidewise; he whirled to fall on Lockyear and pin him to the dirt,
but checked himself at the sight of Lockyear's out-striking boots
and waited for Lockyear to rise; he struck, missed his blow and
felt his mouth ripped by the wallop of Lockyear's fist. The force
set him back and dropped him and a red curtain fell over his eyes.
As soon as he fell he curled himself to shelter his stomach; he
pulled in his head, he heard a warning shout and took Lockyear's
hard kick into his kidneys. He rolled against Lockyear's legs and
brought Lockyear down and rolled free and rose and plunged into the
half-upright Lockyear, driving him back to the ground. He fell on
Lockyear and thrust his knee into the man's belly; he got his
forearm over Lockyear's windpipe and let his weight fall.
Lockyear's fingers made their window cuts across Burnett's face and
the steady surging of the other's body began to unseat him.
Reaching aside, Burnett scooped a handful of dirt into Lockyear's
eyes and sprang away.</p>

<p>As he rose, Lockyear sought to squeeze the dirt from his eyes
and in such a half-turned and unprotected position, Burnett found
him, mauled him on the head, in the belly, on the temple. Burnett
closed on him, wrapped his arms around the other's waist and drove
him straight against the circle. Men jumped aside and tripped
against each other in their hurry to clear away. He brought his
knee into Lockyear's crotch, he drove that resisting body on, he
rammed his head against Lockyear's chin, he steered the man
straight at the nearby fire. Lockyear stiffened his legs, sensing
what was behind him, and tried to veer; but he was too close and
his legs caught on the burning fire log and he went haunch-flat
into the flame, dislodging the big coffeepot hanging there. He
rolled wild-crying across the fire's bed, kicked the supports from
the fire crane and crawled away. Burnett seized the coffeepot and
flung it at the man, and missed. Lockyear got on his hands and
knees and began a patient, bearlike crawl toward the meadow. His
trouser seat, in one full contact with the fire coals, had been
burned away and the raw black cheeks of his buttocks undulated as
he moved.</p>

<p>The broken circle of men re-formed itself beyond the fire,
hemming in both Lockyear and Burnett. When he saw he couldn't get
through the circle, Lockyear shoved himself to his feet. His arms
were down, he was absent-minded with pain, both hands were burned,
the sleeves of his coat smoked. He slapped himself, he watched
Burnett with a close attention. He waited for the beating to go on
and he slipped a hand underneath his coat and held it there.</p>

<p>"That's a knife," said Billy Lord.</p>

<p>"Take it and stick it into him," said Lattimore.</p>

<p>John Gay's grave rebuke followed quickly. "That won't do."</p>

<p>Burnett said, "Here's your coon, Cal."</p>

<p>Lockyear cocked his head crookedly and caught sight of Burnett
through his dirt-clogged eyes. He bit his mouth together until it
was no mouth and endured the rising misery of his hurts. He shook
his head.</p>

<p>Burnett waggled his hand at the circle. "Let him out of
here."</p>

<p>Men stood in their places, reluctant to move. Lockyear waited
with his dead-centered patience; his head slowly revolved to cover
one man and another until this individual searching out began to
trouble them; they were still afraid of him and as his eyes pried
away at the ring some of these settlers grew uneasy and in a short
time the circle lost its tightness as men drifted from it. Lockyear
walked toward his horse and toward Veen waiting by the horse.</p>

<p>Lattimore grumbled: "He'll be back, worse than before."</p>

<p>Burnett said: "Lend me your gun." He watched Lockyear pause and
lay both hands on the rump of his horse. Veen stood close to Cal,
talking to him. Lattimore came from his cabin and handed over his
rifle and Burnett stepped to the edge of the crowd, holding the gun
ready. His beaten nerves began to cry and his legs quivered. His
mouth was bleeding, his ear had been cut by Lockyear's fingernails;
the broken skin across both rows of knuckles lay pleated back from
the red underflesh. Cal Lockyear circled his horse, made two tries
and finally got into the saddle, bending forward to take the weight
from his scorched buttocks; and he rode very slowly over the meadow
and disappeared in the trees, Veen behind. Directly before he
passed from sight, Veen turned and shook his fist at the crowd.</p>

<p>"Little fellow's brave today," said Old Daniel.</p>

<p>Gay said, "He won't be sweetened by a lickin'. You feel bad,
Rice?"</p>

<p>Burnett pressed his shoulder against Elam Walker and moved by.
He was still groggy, not so much from Lockyear's handling as from
the pure poison dumped into his blood by the fight, and gusty tag
ends of violence caught him off guard and made his motions jerky.
He left the rifle against the cabin wall, went to the creek and
flattened for a long drink; when he got up he found Katherine
waiting.</p>

<p>"Have you got anything for that?" she asked, and pointed to his
mouth.</p>

<p>"Heat a stone. Wrap something around it. Lay it against your
mouth." Her glance went back and forth across his face; he saw the
tightening of her expression, the faint constrictions of hardness
come and go. "You wanted to fight. You wanted it." She lifted a
hand to lightly touch his scarred ear. "You'd look fine with one
ear, you'd look well with your teeth knocked out. I've got some
salve Ralph Whitcomb left."</p>

<p>"You mad, Katherine?"</p>

<p>"I guess so." She looked at him; she was critical, she was hurt
by his hurts. "My poor man," she said, "why has it got to be so
hard with you?" and left him.</p>

<p>He returned to the yard and found his hat near the fire. Moss
was at the cabin's doorway, waiting for Edna. He met Rice's glance,
held it only a moment and looked aside. Rice went on to his horse
and rode soon into the trees; now the ebb was on him and he was
dull-minded and paid no attention to his surroundings.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Katherine said little as she walked the narrow trail ahead of Eby.
He had seen a big timber wolf during the week and took time to tell
her his experience with it; and this occupied him all the way to
Mrs. Irish's cabin at the ford. When he finished the story she
said, "I wouldn't want to be alone and see one," and fell back into
her silence. Past Kern's, past Provost's and Collingwood's they
walked; it was between twilight and full nighttime when they came
through the last short patch of firs and arrived home. Eby said
cautiously, "Feeling bad about something?"</p>

<p>"The fight bothered me."</p>

<p>"One of 'em could have got killed easy. They were both tryin'
for it. I wasn't surprised Lockyear should try, but I didn't think
Rice would get that crazy."</p>

<p>"How can you fight gentle? Fighting's fighting." She stepped
inside to light a lantern and hang it on a rafter. Eby made himself
useful for a little while, lugging in wood for the fireplace. "We
arguin' about something?" he asked mildly.</p>

<p>"No," she said and returned to the yard.</p>

<p>He followed her. "It didn't settle anything," he said. "Now he's
got to watch himself when Lockyear's around. He ought to've known
that when he started the fight."</p>

<p>"Did he start it any more than Lockyear?"</p>

<p>"Now we're arguin' again."</p>

<p>"I'm picky tonight."</p>

<p>He reached forward to turn her so that the lamplight fell
against her face. "You think I ought to've fought Lockyear instead
of Rice?"</p>

<p>"You had no reason to do it. But he did. Lockyear was picking a
fight with him. All the men saw it. They expected Rice to fight
him." Then she got to thinking about the scene and saw something
new in it. "They made Rice fight Lockyear&mdash;they pushed him
into it."</p>

<p>"Something to that all right," he agreed. "He couldn't back down
before his neighbors."</p>

<p>No, she thought, that wasn't it. They forced Rice into the
fight, not by words so much as by a kind of soft pressure. They
expected him to stand for them. She checked the impulse to tell
this to Harris, knowing it would trouble his pride; for if strength
to speak for them was what they wanted, this huge and amiable man
was the better choice, his enormous fist capable of destroying
Lockyear at one blow. But they had turned to Rice in this matter as
they had, along the trail, occasionally turned to him in other
matters. She hadn't thought much about those qualities in men which
drew the trust of other men, but it was plain to her now that
Burnett had grown in the train's estimation since he had joined it
in the spring. It was a strange and powerful and quiet
thing&mdash;this crowd judgment which cast some men aside and
brought others forward, and put all men in their places regardless
of their own seeking. How hard Collingwood tried, yet was rejected;
how worthy Harris was, and still would never be more than a voice
in the background. Whatever it was that commanded the respect of
men, her father had it and Burnett had it, and because of it there
would be demands made of them they couldn't escape. Burnett had
spoken for them and as time went on they would require more of him.
He couldn't escape that service if he stayed in the settlement.
<i>If he stayed</i>, she repeated to herself, and again wondered
about his intentions.</p>

<p>Harris Eby had been watching her during this long silence, and
drew her interest back to him. "You got no patience with me
tonight."</p>

<p>"I'm just out of sorts," she said. "Don't know why."</p>

<p>"What I ought to do," he said, "is get boilin' mad and raise
hell with you."</p>

<p>"Go ahead. It's what you ought to do."</p>

<p>"I've not got that kind of a temper."</p>

<p>"Oh, Harris," she said, and took his arm, her smile reassuring
him. "You know me well enough to put up with my spells. You'd
better you've got a whole life to endure them."</p>

<p>"Then you've made up your mind to endure <i>me?</i>" he said,
quick to take the opening he saw.</p>

<p>Her reply was not quite an answer. "You'll not make a hard
husband."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "what you require you can have, so long as you
don't expect more than I can do. There's not half a dozen things I
stick fast on. On those I shall want my way. The rest of it can be
what you want." He laid his hand on her shoulder, of a notion to
force the decision; but he couldn't bring himself to be aggressive
and stood rather awkwardly before her. She reached up and brought
his hand down, and held it; and she changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Did you get the well finished?"</p>

<p>"Water came in at thirty feet. I am going to put a coolhouse
around it, with shelves for the milk and butter."</p>

<p>"You remember what Mrs. Dancey's coolhouse looked like in Poplar
Grove?"</p>

<p>"Big square box, like a small room, built into the top of the
well."</p>

<p>"Build it that way," she said.</p>

<p>"You had better come down and look around," he suggested,
"before I get things put together the way you don't want."</p>

<p>"All right," she said. "Now you go home&mdash;it's a long
walk."</p>

<p>She knew him well, but on occasion he had an insight into things
which surprised her; he surprised her now. He stepped back and made
a balancing motion with his hand. "It's yes and no with you, ain't
it? You lean, but you're afraid to fall."</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said. "Maybe it's that way. Maybe I get
scared when I think of it&mdash;a lot of girls are like that just
before the wedding."</p>

<p>"Buck fever," he said. "Lot of men that way, too."</p>

<p>"You feel it, Harris?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "my mind's made up and I'm in a hurry to do
it."</p>

<p>She gave his hand a quick tap and dropped it. "Well, good
night," she said, and watched him go. He followed the trail with no
seeming haste but his great stride soon took him to the trees; he
was a matter-of-fact man, she thought, his sentiment well
contained, for it never occurred to him to turn to wave at her as
he passed into the trees. Turning to the cabin, she found herself
relieved, as though his presence had pressed her too close to a
decision and she said to herself, <i>There's not that much hurry.
After Christmas is time enough. Or early spring. March. For then I
can do summer's work before a baby puts me indoors.</i> She set on
the coffee and started supper and her mind went in another
direction and she remembered how Rice had watched Edna at the
wedding. Why hadn't it been Rice instead of Moss&mdash;and did it
really change anything between those two? Moss&mdash;poor Moss, he
was nothing. The family came home and she listened to the supper
talk without interest, and afterwards the three women did their
chores. The moment the men left the cabin Gram began to talk, as
though the silence had been hard on her.</p>

<p>"That Edna&mdash;she had to do it."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt," said Martha Gay. "Wonder what Miz' Rinearson
thinks? I'd not be happy were I she."</p>

<p>"Moss don't mean anything," said Gram. "He's just a boy that got
fooled into it. That girl's been an excitement to men so long it's
in her blood. She likes it too well to quit. She'll keep right on.
Pull the wool over Moss's eyes half the time, honey him out of
being mad the other half."</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," said Martha Gay. "It was Rice she was
running after."</p>

<p>"He had her, too," said Gram Gay. "More than once."</p>

<p>"Well, then, why didn't she marry him?"</p>

<p>"Something about the girl boggled him. Girl like Edna thinks
it's easy to let a man come on&mdash;then get him that way.
Sometimes it is. Lot of husbands in this settlement were got that
way. But sometimes it boggles them."</p>

<p>"I don't know," reflected Martha Gay. "Maybe she did the best.
That Rice has done a lot of wandering. It's in his blood; he'll
wander some more. Moss will settle down. She's got something
certain to count on."</p>

<p>"<i>Certain&mdash;certain</i>," said Gram. "Don't talk
<i>certain</i> to me. That's for scared people. Get a man you're
certain of and you'll die a thousand times listenin' to
<i>certain</i> all your life, watchin' <i>certain</i> all your
life." She touched the silent Katherine with her glance. "Nothing
more certain than a rock, but what's in that kind of marriage to
please a woman?"</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Two days later Lockyear walked into the Kitchen house, spoke to the
Kitchens for no more than fifteen minutes and walked out with Roxy.
They found Lot White, were married and at once turned into the
hills, Lockyear walking so fast that Roxy now and then broke into a
trot to keep up with him. All her possessions, the few ragged
clothes and the fewer pitiful trinkets, were wrapped in a cotton
towel under her arm. The news spread around the hills, from mouth
to mouth, and was known by everybody that same day. A special
messenger could have carried it no faster.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>Chapter 25</h2>

<p>AS with nearly all other things in this land, the weather made
its change in quiet fashion; the wind swung to the east, the fat
gray clouds dissolved, the sun shone down with its reddened
year's-end mildness, the nights were crisp. Near Christmas it was
bright and clear, and people's spirits lifted as a sense of
elbowroom and distance returned. Eastward the massive Cascade chain
showed a white dusting of snow along peak and alpine timber masses.
To the west the valley whenever the settlers caught sight of it
through the intervening timber&mdash;rolled toward the prairie and
then far-off mountains of the coast. Vine maple had earlier flashed
its light scarlet against the green background of fir, but now
those leaves were gone, and the alder leaves had
dropped&mdash;leaving behind the memory of their last amber-yellow
glow. Beneath russet oaks acorns lay scattered; the ferns were
wilting back to form another layer of mulch for the earth, the
berry bushes&mdash;interlaced with weedy growth&mdash;were ragged
and old-purple; an occasional wild rose bush still held its last
red seed pods; the willows stood bare along the creek. In every
new-plowed field winter wheat made its pale green cast against the
black soil.</p>

<p>It was strange weather to people who at this time in the East
would have been knee-deep in snow and whipped by bitter winds. They
liked this blandness, they marveled at it, but they couldn't quite
trust it and waited for blizzard time to come. Meanwhile they used
the opportunity to burn the slash piles accumulated from their land
clearing, and everywhere around the settlement ash-blue clouds of
smoke rose and the wild-flavored residue of burning wood permeated
the air; at night the dragon-eyes of fire gleamed through thickets
and across meadows.</p>

<p>Burnett made fence while he tended his fires, and as soon as he
had his home lot closed in he brought the stock down from the upper
meadow each night; for both cougar and wolves were moving in from
the higher mountains, the wolves sounding in the dark, the cougar
printing their presence in the soft earth beside the creek. Colder
weather shrank the creek until it fell over its rock barrier as a
thin sheet of curved glass, and at this low stage he had his best
chance to survey the millrace which would cut the creek above the
falls; the actual digging could wait, for he had begun the fencing
and, as with any chore he did, he liked to complete one thing at a
time. He crossed the creek to run his fences along the farther
upper fields.</p>

<p>The self-discipline of the settlers loosened as the year
straggled to its end. The holiday season came on with its increased
sentiment, with its memories of the far-off East softening and
saddening them, and in this mood they wanted company and began to
set out on their nightly visits. Hawn came down from his place with
a big red hen and fifteen eggs.</p>

<p>"She's been settin' for a week. There's your start of fowls."
Then he grinned. "Now you got a female around the place."</p>

<p>"That your idea or Louisa's?"</p>

<p>"Louisa's," said Hawn, and was reminded of some news. "Some
Klamaths have crossed the mountains to join the Molalas for the
winter. Thirty or forty families. They're tougher people. Seen any
bucks around here?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Probably will. They'll get hungry and go to beggin'." He
lighted a pipe and stood lazy in the sunlight. He knew he had
stopped Burnett's work and ought to go; but he had no work of his
own to occupy his time. He was outside; he was a squaw man on the
edge of the settlement, not in it. "The hen's name is Crazy Girl.
Louisa named her." He made up his mind to go. "I wish," he said, "I
could tell Louisa about Christmas, but damned if I can get it
across." He went away, habit causing him to walk in long fast
strides though he had no reason to hurry.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
After supper that evening Burnett heard Millard's voice calling
over the darkness and when he had banked his cabin fire he took up
his gun, crossed the creek and made his way through the thicket to
the Millard cabin. The Provosts had dropped in, and the
Collingwoods and Mrs. Irish and Watt, and John and Martha Gay; and
Katherine. Lot White hailed the cabin a little later.</p>

<p>"We got some tea," said Millard. "What you packin' a rifle for,
Rice?"</p>

<p>"To balance my weight crossing the creek." He said "Hello"
around and settled on his heels in a corner. Katherine sat on the
bed beside him. His pipe, and Millard's and Provost's, presently
fogged the little room. Katherine reached down, took the pipe from
his mouth and tried a few draws on it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Millard said "Women get bad habits enough from men without
learning that one, Katherine." She laid out cups for the tea;
exhausting the cups she used mush bowls. "I better give you one of
the bowls, Lot. Your mouth's pretty wide for a cup."</p>

<p>"Sister," said Lot, "is it agoin' to be war or peace
tonight?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Millard passed around the tea. She moved to her cupboard
and found a piece of bread and spread it with jam from a crock. "I
don't guess we'll ever see those wonderful wild Iowa plums again.
They don't grow here." She gave the bread and jam to Watt Irish.
"You're the hardest-working man in the crowd and you don't waste
time talking or roving."</p>

<p>John Gay, seated next to his wife, laid his head back against
the wall and smiled at Mrs. Millard. "Nancy, don't strain your
mercy so thin."</p>

<p>"She was bit by somethin' when she was ten years old," said
Lot.</p>

<p>Mrs. Millard laid the edge of her glance against him but held
her tongue. This crowd was easy, tolerant. Gently, gently it lay
here. Burnett thought&mdash;the thing that bound them. It hovered
over them, it moved softly through them.</p>

<p>"Any Indians?" asked Gay.</p>

<p>"Saw one across the creek late yesterday afternoon," said
Provost. Burnett said: "Hawn tells me there's some Klamaths living
with the Molallies."</p>

<p>Martha Gay's face darkened; here was something new to worry
about. But it was John Gay's odd motion Rice Burnett noticed
then&mdash;the way he reached over with his left hand to turn his
right arm half around; and he observed again, as he had at Edna's
wedding, the falling-away of the man's flesh from its bones. He was
older by ten years than in the spring of this year at the trip's
beginning; and straight across his lips was the precise streak of
pain. Katherine dropped her hand to Burnett's shoulder. "Tell an
Indian story like the one you told on the Snake."</p>

<p>"Oh, Katherine," said Martha, "they give me the miserables."</p>

<p>"Tell it," said Katherine.</p>

<p>"Murphy and Jo Gantt and Ben Kimmel&mdash;this was in the
Yellowstone country, four years ago. Big party came up the Missouri
and made camp. We worked out from the main camp, up the creeks,
three and four men together, trapping beaver. One night, week or
two from camp, these three fellows cooked supper and settled for
sleep. That's Sioux country and you don't sleep close to the fire.
You get away from it and sleep light. Beyond midnight the horses
made a racket and Murphy and Gantt got up and went over to what was
left of the fire. Kimmel was a different man&mdash;always expected
trouble; so he stayed back and he was half out of his blankets, in
the brush, when he saw Murphy fall down. Arrow went through
Murphy's chest and came out his back&mdash;point on one side,
feathers on the other. Gantt started to run, and ran right into a
big buck. The buck raised his gun barrel first and crushed Gantt's
skull. Maybe you don't know the sound of that&mdash;it's somethin'
like what you'd hear when you break open a good hard squash with an
ax handle. Well, Kimmel was still in the brush and he thought he
wasn't seen, so he crawled away, and he'd got maybe twenty yards
when something hit him on the ribs and a gun went off right in his
face; he felt the powder burn his skin when he faded out."</p>

<p>He bent forward to catch a splinter from the wood pile, to light
it in the fire. He wavered the flame back and forth over his pipe
bowl. Katherine's fingers dug into his shoulders. "So what'd Kimmel
do?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he was dead."</p>

<p>"Then that'd be the end of the story. Go on&mdash;you always
stop to light your pipe."</p>

<p>When he got conscious the fire had gone out entirely and he was
cold&mdash;it gets awful cold in the mountains that time of year.
His face was sticky, full of blood, so he figured he'd been wounded
by the explosion of the gun in his face, and he felt around to see
where'd he'd been hit. When he passed his hand over his hair, he
didn't have any hair. He'd been scalped. Well, he had some
hair&mdash;sort of a rim around the scalped place.</p>

<p>The Indian's bullet had missed him, though his face was powder
burned, and when he wrapped a bandanna around his head the blood
caked and quit running. It was pretty close to daylight, the horses
were gone and Murphy and Gantt were dead. All he could do was start
back for the main camp, about thirty miles away.</p>

<p>When daylight came he went back into the timber, and pretty soon
he topped a small ridge and found out he was being followed, so he
crossed the ridge and got to a lake and broke a big bullrush and
sank under the water, using the bullrush to breathe through. He
couldn't see or hear anything under water, and he didn't want to
risk looking, so he stayed under most of that day; then he crawled
out, much dead as alive, and began to walk for camp. By that time
it was dark again and he missed his way and started up the side of
a ridge. Next thing he got into an old rock slide and fell into a
sort of a pit about fifteen feet deep and maybe twenty feet
wide.</p>

<p>Couldn't see a thing but he began to smell something&mdash;the
sort of a smell you only have to smell once to remember; and he
began to hear some funny noises and then he knew he was in a
rattlesnake den&mdash;snakes all around him. Somehow he'd landed on
his feet without stepping on any of 'em but he knew if he shifted
around he might. It was a pretty cold night and he suffered some,
but the coldness helped him some, too, for it made the snakes
sluggish. Anyhow, he never moved&mdash;not so much as an inch all
night long. Eight hours is a long time to stand still.</p>

<p>"When daylight came again he looked around and saw thousands of
snakes, all twined together in masses big as barrels at the bottom
of the pit, and when he looked at the broken sides of the pit he
noticed snakes curled back in the ledges sort of like Navajo cliff
dwellers. It was a pretty ticklish business climbing out of the
place, because he had to put his hands and feet on these ledges and
once when he was pulling himself up the side of the pit his face
came dead level with a rattler, he staring at the snake and the
snake staring at him, not a foot between them. If it hadn't been so
cold, and the snake so slow, Kimmel would have been bitten right
between the eyes.</p>

<p>"Finally he got out of there and crossed the ridge and found a
river. He didn't know exactly where he was but he stopped at the
river and had a good drink and worked his way downstream. About
noon he got a little careless and next thing he knew he was jumped
by a dozen Sioux. Only thing he could do then was run for it, so he
struck out, Indians a quarter mile behind him. He took to the
timber but they were fresh and he wasn't and pretty soon they
closed in and he thought he was done for, ducking in and out of the
trees and climbing a small hill. They all took shots at him and
missed him. By the time he got to the top of the hill he was ready
to quit. Then he looked down the other side of the hill, and there
lay the big camp&mdash;tents and horses and trappers. He just let
out a hell of a shout and ran down the hill into the camp.</p>

<p>"The Indians stayed on top of the hill and started shooting.
Pretty soon some more Indians came up and the trappers had a hot
time for three or four hours fighting off the band. They lost some
horses and a couple men got scratched. Otherwise it wasn't much and
by nighttime the Indians pulled away. Kimmel didn't pay much
attention. He was too weak to stand up so he dragged himself into a
tent and let the rest of the crowd do the fighting. He'd done his.
Well, when it was all over the booshway, the leader of the
party&mdash;came into the tent and gave Kimmel hell. He said 'You
damn fool, when you come into camp, come in alone. I ought to brain
you for bringing all those Indians with you.'</p>

<p>"That's all the story. Kimmel put a lot of bear grease on the
scalped spot and went back to trapping in a week. It never bothered
him much except when it got hot&mdash;but he's always been mighty
sensitive to flies walking on the top of his head ever since. He
once told me that without hair and hide up there a fly's foot
weighed ten pounds."</p>

<p>Katherine reached down and pulled his head about to catch a
straight sight of his face. "<i>Thousands</i> of snakes?"</p>

<p>"Maybe that was a little large," he said.</p>

<p>"It was a wonderful story," she said.</p>

<p>Martha Gay shook her head. "I don't see how you can bear to hear
such things." She spoke to Mrs. Millard. "Nancy, have you got any
big buttons?"</p>

<p>"Lord," said Mrs. Millard, "when did I see one last? I been
using cut-down nails for buttons on Millard's trousers."</p>

<p>"There's so little to do with," said Martha Gay.</p>

<p>"I've got some," said Mrs. Irish. "How many you need?"</p>

<p>"Three," said Martha Gay. "And that reminds me I've got a stout
piece of cloth at the bottom of my old round trunk. It will make
Watt a shirt."</p>

<p>Billy Lord's sudden laugh came out of him in short scratches of
sound, like a broom sweeping back and forth. "My God, I ain't
thought of Hugh Paddow for most a year!...The shirt reminded
me...Hughie went huntin' in the Ozarks and got trail of a bear.
Trail got pretty warm and Hughie got careless. He following the
tracks through a thicket. Pushed through the thicket and there was
the bear on a log, lookin' at Hughie. It was kind of sudden. Hughie
was sure surprised, and so was the bear. Hughie tried to get his
gun raised, the bear made a run. Bear wasn't after
Hughie&mdash;bear just wanted to get the hell out of there, but it
was kind of close quarters, so the bear knocked Hughie down and
walked right over him. I guess it would of been all right but
Hughie rolled to get out of the way, and got on his hands and
knees. That was sure unfortunate because he had his back end to the
bear and the bear took one swipe at it and kept right on going. It
didn't hurt Hughie much but he didn't have no back end to his
pants&mdash;none at all. So he walked home. When he got to the
village he sort of traveled sidewise along the street with his back
end against the picket fence, and this looked kind of peculiar to
Hughie's wife who was out on the porch with some other women and
saw him comin'. After he got to the gate he didn't know what to
do&mdash;there was the women in front of him, and somebody was
comin' along the street behind him. Hughie just sat down and pushed
himself feet forward across the yard toward the porch, like a man
rowin' himself home. Hughie's wife got right up and ran into the
house and pretty soon she came out with a broom and laid it around
Hughie till she broke the thing, and she said 'You old creature,
you're drunk again.' That's what hurt him most. Usually he was, but
this time he wasn't."</p>

<p>"Want more tea?" said Mrs. Millard. Nobody did. Mrs. Millard
said: "It just offends me not to give company something better. How
I yearn for somethin' green&mdash;it's been such a long
time&mdash;it'll be such a lot longer."</p>

<p>"I got some onion sets planted behind the cabin," said Mrs.
Provost. "I go out day after day to see if they've sprouted any
more."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lord sighed deeply, and Lord said, "You got an ache?"</p>

<p>"No, I was thinking of such good things to eat."</p>

<p>"Hell, girl, you and me can hibernate all winter and still come
out plump."</p>

<p>"That Cartwell girl," said Mrs. Provost, "she sixteen or
fifteen?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen," said Martha Gay.</p>

<p>"Her mother keeps sayin' fifteen."</p>

<p>"That's just to make it seem she's too young to know what she's
doing," said Martha Gay.</p>

<p>"What's she doin'?" asked John Gay.</p>

<p>"Now, you know."</p>

<p>Burnett closed his eyes, listening to the softened talk, to the
back and forth play of easy words. It was here&mdash;softly it
touched them. The room was a small bright cell set in the
downbearing blackness, in the empty blackness, in the windy,
endless blackness; inside the cell fourteen people crouched
together, like common passengers in a crowded coach. He opened his
eyes and saw Lucy Collingwood's face tipped toward the ceiling,
darkened and soft. Billy Lord said:</p>

<p class="poem">Moses, Rufus, Jackson, Joe,<br>
Think of Egypt&mdash;there you'll go.<br>
Think of hell and hell's for you.<br>
What you think is what you'll do.</p>

<p>"That's pretty, Billy," said Mrs. Lord, "but thinkin' won't
bring a big cake a sugar to me."</p>

<p>"It's the spirit we got to nourish, girl."</p>

<p>"Then what'd you sell the fiddle for?
Wheat&mdash;wheat&mdash;that's not spirit."</p>

<p>"Now you're contradictin'," said Billy.</p>

<p class="poem">The green skirt slipped and the green skirt
fell,<br>
And I kissed her in the loft by the big church bell.<br>
The gray skirt whirled and the gray skirt rose,<br>
And I kissed her in the meadow where the lilac grows.<br>
And I loved them both, but I went away.<br>
Oh, where is the green? Oh, where is the gray?</p>

<p>"That's what I mean," said Mrs. Millard. "Men do it and run
away, and they make songs to brag about it. I wish I could make up
a song for what women feel."</p>

<p>Billy Lord said: "Man or woman, it's no difference. The song's
to soak up the cryin'. We all got to cry, but we got to sing to
quit cryin'."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mrs. Millard, "a man might cry till he filled a river
but it'd be thin water. A woman's tears are mighty few and strong
as poison. Ever break your heart, Lord?"</p>

<p>"Every Saturday night till I met Fanny."</p>

<p>"Then you never did."</p>

<p>Collingwood bent forward. "There's no doubt. Women have it hard
out here. I have thought about it a lot, it's a sad thing,
everything they've got to do. Morning till night, no let up, no end
to it. It would break a man's back to follow their steps all day
long. Mothers and helpmeets. They keep the fires lighted and the
cabin warm and say nothing about their sorrows or their aches.
Well, there's a special place in heaven for women. Closer to the
throne than men will get, I'm entirely certain."</p>

<p>His wife cast a short glance toward him and dropped her eyes.
Mrs. Millard studied him with a puzzled, skeptical glance and for
once had no immediate answer. The room was quiet. Collingwood
looked about from face to face and settled back.</p>

<p>"Well, now," said Gay in his comfortable manner, "let's not make
out this world such a terrible thing. I don't pity myself for the
work I've got. What would we do if there was no work&mdash;walk all
day down the road pickin' buttercups?"</p>

<p>Burnett's cramped legs fell asleep and a thousand needles
pricked them. He rose, he stamped his feet, he walked into the
night. Millard's brush fires were a cherry red on the meadow, the
guttural song of the frogs was a carpet of sound along the earth.
He walked to the nearest fire and squatted before it, and he heard
steps come lightly behind him, and Katherine's voice.</p>

<p>"Any snakes in Oregon?" She settled near him and took up a
half-burned stick and began to poke at the flame. "What's that
wood?"</p>

<p>"Alder."</p>

<p>"It's crying."</p>

<p>"Sap in the alder."</p>

<p>"The devil crying. For once he got himself in the wrong place.
Lot would be pleased." She turned the stick steadily in the flames.
"I feel good&mdash;I feel sad."</p>

<p>"Devil ever get in you?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I've got a place for him, I invite him in once in a
while." She stirred uncomfortably in her crouched position. He
peeled off his coat and laid it beside him and steadied her while
she settled on it. She turned to prop her back against his
shoulder. He moved his shoulder and she straightened away from him
and looked around while he adjusted himself; then she dropped
against him again. He braced himself to her weight and circled his
arm around her waist. She folded her hands over his arm and her
head tilted on his chest until she faced the yeasty foaming of the
stars.</p>

<p>"Never changes," she said. "Up there&mdash;always the same."</p>

<p>"Everything changes."</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Everything's old. Every time I look in a fire I
feel something move around me. I've done this before, way, way
back. What's new? How long have people been kissing?"</p>

<p>"Pretty old habit," he said.</p>

<p>"That's what I mean&mdash;old."</p>

<p>"Damned good habit, too."</p>

<p>Talk went on in the cabin; the creek clucked over its stones and
the coyotes prowled the close-by timber, sounding off with their
half bark and half howl. A lifting thread of wind blew the fire
brighter.</p>

<p>"Heavy on you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Christmas&mdash;Christmas."</p>

<p>"Feel it coming?"</p>

<p>"Two days ago. I looked at Joe and I thought, 'What shall I get
him?' Made me sad to think there'll be nothing to get this year.
Then I thought, `We're a long way from home.' Rivers, mountains,
deserts&mdash;a long way off. We'll not see our people again, we'll
not go back. It's like stepping off Noah's Ark. I don't like to
lose track of my people. I like things close around me, place I was
born, everything I knew, old sights, old things. I feel like a
moved tree that's not taken hold. Any old wind could blow me
down."</p>

<p>"No it couldn't."</p>

<p>"The air's good, the wood smells good. Night's peaceful."</p>

<p>He lowered his head to catch the scent of her hair and
possessiveness went through him as a quick puff of flame through
dry leaves, and he rose to drag over the burnt-out heart of the
fire, bringing on a brighter blaze. She sat upright, curiosity
alive. "How much weight have you lost?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. Should weigh a hundred seventy-five."</p>

<p>"It shows here," she said, and pushed in her cheeks with her
fingers. She turned her attention to the fire and he waited for the
faraway expression to come to her again; but she was in another
mood, her thoughts bringing on little shifts of comfort, of
luxurious reaction around her mouth, and her eyes were bluer than
the nap of old velvet and sweetness rose from her as pitch might
rise from a summer-heated tree. She raised her glance, found him
observing her, and erased the expression with a smile. She
motioned, pulled him toward her, and caught his hand to rise from
her place. He got his coat and went into the cabin for his gun;
when he came out she had drifted farther along the meadow.</p>

<p>He caught up with her and they moved on to the creek's shallow
riffles above the Lattimore place. Wet earth's odor and bland air
and creek's coldness met here and became light whirlpools of
turbulence around them. The glow of brush fires wavered against the
alders; voices came from the cabin, echoes bobbing in darkness like
corks on choppy water.</p>

<p>"How deep's the water?"</p>

<p>He put his back to her and she got her arms around his neck and
rode over the creek. "Last time I did that was when Harris and I
went to school at Poplar Bluff&mdash;that was a muddy little creek.
I wouldn't put my foot in it because he scared me with stories
about cotton-mouth snakes."</p>

<p>They crossed Lattimore's clearing. Rice said, "Where we
going?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Where we going?"</p>

<p>He turned to the left, then along the trail, toward Irish's. She
passed a hand back and forth in front of her. "Air's thick. Smell
what's in it trees, fern, brush smoke, mountains, mud. Like syrup.
I feel good. You taking me home? I don't want to go home. I want to
go up there."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the mountains. Way up there, where nobody's ever been.
What's a cougar look like?"</p>

<p>"Big, tawny, short-cropped cat. Beautiful head, clipped ears,
round green eyes."</p>

<p>They passed into the trees, all light vanishing. She moved
nearer to him and took his hand. "Cougars in here?"</p>

<p>"Might be."</p>

<p>"How old you think the Lords are? It's hard to tell about fat
people."</p>

<p>"I'd guess forty."</p>

<p>"Wonder what they were like? I think she must have been one of
those big pretty girls that never ran out of energy and danced all
night and loved everything. It's still in her eyes."</p>

<p>"Forty don't mean anything to them. They're still young."</p>

<p>"Once in a while I see a look on them," she said. "Sad look.
They hate to get old."</p>

<p>"I can't fight or drink the way I did at twenty," he said. "I
hate to get old, too."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd known you then," she said, and immediately changed
the subject. "I like the way my father is. I know he wishes he'd
done other things, but he's never sorry about the past." Her mind
moved from thing to thing; he felt the bubble of her spirit, the
light and active swinging of her thoughts. "I like trees. They
stand right here and don't change."</p>

<p>"Trees don't need much."</p>

<p>"If we could only know what the lives of people were like.
Grandmother, now. Why do some people stay like that, and others
fade till they're nothing? When she was a girl she had a fine time.
I can imagine her then. But I can't imagine Grandfather then. He's
been old since I first knew him." Her mind was arrested by that
notion; she went silently on through the trees and into the Irish
clearing. She made a small sound. "It must have been hard for
her."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"She so lively and Grandfather so quiet."</p>

<p>They passed into the woods beyond the Irish cabin, hearing the
hallooing of voices across the creek at Millard's. From the ridge
beyond Lord's hill came a coyote's cry, short yipping notes
breaking into a sustained howl. Timber's blackness fell upon them
again. "I like that sound," she murmured. "I like the darkness in
here."</p>

<p>"Tonight," he said, "you like everything."</p>

<p>"I do. I wish there was a dance. I wish there was an excursion
boat going down the Mississippi. I wish I could get on a horse and
travel all the way to California. If I were a man, I'd go. Then I'd
come back. Why are you so silent?"</p>

<p>"Like your grandfather."</p>

<p>"Not the same. You're thinking something. But not sad&mdash;I
don't feel it's sad. What is it? I wish you'd tell me."</p>

<p>"Now you're your grandmother. You want somebody to say something
to you."</p>

<p>"I'm my grandmother all over," she said. "Lock, stock and
barrel. I want to be like her, do all she's done and do it as
well&mdash;that would make me feel good. She even shot at an
Indian. No, I don't want to do that. An outlaw came to her house
once, made her cook a meal, left her a gold piece and kissed her.
She's got children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren. She's
plowed land, killed and butchered meat. She's lived in all kinds of
country and weather, she's had every sort of experience. I wish I
knew the things she's done she's not talked about. Things have been
hard with her, but look at her now. I watch her hands and admire
what they've accomplished. It makes me angry sometimes when I hear
Lot White saying what miserable and helpless creatures we are and
how much forgiveness we've got to pray for. Grandmother's never
been helpless. I never saw her cry. Never knew her when she wasn't
busy. I'd like him to tell me what the Lord ought to forgive
<i>her</i> for. She's done her share here."</p>

<p>The trail took them out of the trees into the Collingwood meadow
and past the dark Collingwood cabin. Katherine fell silent, engaged
in an interesting set of thoughts which held her all the way to the
Gay cabin. When they came to the yard she turned on him.
"Coffee?"</p>

<p>"No, I'll reach out for home."</p>

<p>"Next time we walk, you do the talking." She stepped nearer,
laid a hand on his arm, and looked up to him with her curiosity.
"Next time you do the talking."</p>

<p>The short, dry flame once more licked through him. He remembered
Edna's words: "She's no different than I am&mdash;we're all the
same." Maybe, but even so it wasn't the same with Katherine; not
the same thing at all.</p>

<p>Gram's shape darkened the cabin doorway's yellow rectangle.
"That you, Katherine?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Katherine. She dropped her hand from his arm, the
lightness and laughter within her seeming to increase. She was new
to him tonight, she was likc a piece of glass which, under the
changing sunlight, threw off varied colors. "Come to supper when
you're lonesome."</p>

<p>"All right," he said and turned away.</p>

<p>As soon as he took the trail her manner changed; the confusion
of emotions subsided and a kind of flat quiet came upon her, the
strong sense of well-being growing less, and she listened until his
ranging pace died on the trail, and turned to the cabin.</p>

<p>Gram said: "It a good visit?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Katherine. She moved around the room, too restless
to be either idle or useful.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
After their departure the other families began to move away into
the night, over the meadows, into the charcoal blackness of the
timber, through brushy thickets&mdash;voices calling across the
night and fading tone on tone until the Millards, listening from
their yard, heard no more.</p>

<p>"Do hope the Lords don't fall, crossing the creek," said Mrs.
Millard and turned into the cabin.</p>

<p>"Not a foot deep at the ford right now."</p>

<p>"It was good to have everybody," she said. "Lately I've had the
lonesomes. Seems like everybody's got the lonesomes. I guess it's
Christmas so near that makes me feel bad. Do I see John not looking
well?"</p>

<p>"Somethin' wrong there," said Millard. "But he'd be the last man
to say what."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Mrs. Millard, "how long it'll be?"</p>

<p>"What'll be?"</p>

<p>"Katherine and Rice."</p>

<p>"He only got through with this Edna business. You think men got
to be runnin' every minute of the time?"</p>

<p>"Just hounds with their tongues lappin' out a foot."</p>

<p>"Look here, girl," said Millard. "Any time a woman won't want a
man runnin' after her she can stop it in twenty seconds."</p>

<p>"No we can't, not after a man starts it. There's where you men
have got us, Millard. Touch the match to the tow and we burn till
we're destroyed."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Millard in disbelief.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Mrs. Millard, "they lived closer together so
they'd see more of each other. Then it wouldn't take so long."</p>

<p>"I thought you thought he was a hound dog."</p>

<p>"She's got to get married soon or late and he's the best she'll
be able to do."</p>

<p>"Well, by God," said Millard, "he's a damned good best for
her."</p>

<p>"He's a man, like any other and when the newness wears off,
he'll bully her&mdash;try to crush her spirit." She turned on
Millard. "You certainly took your good time watching Lucy
Collingwood."</p>

<p>Millard said cautiously, "Don't seem to remember that."</p>

<p>"Well, you did. In a man old as you it looks silly. But I'm
sorry for her. Her spirit's dyin'. I could cry."</p>

<p>"Collingwood ain't much, and that's a fact," said Millard.</p>

<p>"That came against the grain, didn't it, Millard? Men hate not
to stick up for men. He's such a vain creature I could strike him.
Those meechin', nice-nice, polite ways of his&mdash;all a big lie.
I just see those shadows around her eyes get deeper and
deeper."</p>

<p>"They ain't so deep but what they wouldn't disappear in about
five minutes with Whitcomb."</p>

<p>"Oh, the egotism of man. You give and you take away, and women
ought to be proud to do your slavework and stroke your heads and
give you pleasure, and crawl away humble when you don't want them.
God, Millard, you make me so mad!"</p>

<p>"There you go," said Millard. "You think of something some man
did to some woman, and you take it out on me."</p>

<p>She moved around the cabin, silent, her motions made brisk by
irritation. She finished her work and turned on Millard with a
changed manner. "I've caused you a lot of trouble, haven't I?"</p>

<p>"Times, you have," he said noncommittally.</p>

<p>"I know I have." She came over to stand before him and to lay a
hand on his arm. He watched her with an air of puzzled
resignation&mdash;and this was his defense, for it pleased her to
think he didn't understand the complexity and depth of her nature.
It was true that he had no knowledge of what made her as she was;
when he reflected on it he was sometimes inclined to think that an
extra pinch of sulphur had been carelessly measured out in her
making; at other times he searched the past in order to understand
her, seeking for the things she wanted and hadn't gotten,
considering his own treatment of her. Wondering if there had been
some other man she had preferred. To that extent she was mysterious
to him, but otherwise he had a most accurate knowledge of the
things which set her into revolt; he knew the pattern by heart, the
oncoming storm, the course it ran, the fury it generated, the
period of calm almost of happiness&mdash;which followed. He was,
himself, a man whose days made a kind of steady flat line forward;
but his wife's soul demanded a different rhythm, rising to peaks of
fury, falling into valleys of calm. For her there had to be bursts
of thunder to dissolve the tensions built up.</p>

<p>"Why do you put up with me when I'm like that? Why don't you
just up and strike me?"</p>

<p>"That's just talk," he said. "If I did, you'd rile up
again."</p>

<p>"No, you ought to do it. I swear, I must be hard to live with.
You're such an easy man. If you knew me better you'd exert yourself
more and stop it."</p>

<p>"Kind of late for that."</p>

<p>She looked closely into his face. "Millard, are you saying you
wanted to strike me a long time ago? You been unhappy with me all
these years?"</p>

<p>"Said nothing like that."</p>

<p>"It sounded so. If you're not pleased, speak it, don't hide
it."</p>

<p>He shook his head, smiling. She said, briefly, "It'd be better
if you didn't always close up like an oyster. When I get mad, why
don't you get mad? Then we'd get over it."</p>

<p>She turned from him, the quickness of her motion notifying him
of her renewed displeasure. The scene was done. He stepped into the
yard to make the round of his slash fires, piling on great mounds
of wet brush. It was a wonderful way she had of touching a match to
her discontent and blowing it to hell and gone into the sky; it
gave her the feeling of something accomplished. Now she would hum
to herself and forget about it and expect him to forget about it.
He stood in the meadow, catching the sense of the night. There was
no feeling of rain. Tomorrow would be another fair day.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The Lords crossed the creek with the Gays and the Provosts and
thereafter went on alone, westward up the hill to their place. Mrs.
Lord said: "Where's the trail, Billy?"</p>

<p>"God-damned if I know. Black as the gut of a cat. Come over
here. You tired?"</p>

<p>"Visitin' makes me fresh. I just love it. But I wish you had
your fiddle. Ain't ever goin' to get over bein' sorry. Oh, God,
Billy, I could of snatched that bread and jam from Watt Irish.
Sugar&mdash;sugar, I'm so starved for it. I'd just like to get my
greedy hands on a barrel of honey. I'd eat till I was sick. I'd
smear it on me. I'd drown in it." She went on up the hill, making
little mournful sounds as her imagination tortured her.</p>

<p>Billy Lord reached deeper and deeper for his wind as he climbed.
"I have got to lose weight," he grumbled. "It's killin' me."</p>

<p>"Now don't talk of that. What'd I do out here alone?"</p>

<p>"Marry a man that'd buy you sugar."</p>

<p>Her huge bulk moved over, bumped into him. Her voice was
girl-like. "Oh, Billy, I never said it. I never meant it. You know
I was just talkin'."</p>

<p>"Sure," he said. "But I wish you had it. Wish I could find a bee
tree. Ought to be bee trees out here."</p>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter 26</h2>

<p>WHEN Lockyear brought Roxy home, straight from Lot White's
reluctant blessing, he did an odd thing: he paused at the edge of
the clearing and looked at her with nothing kind on his face.</p>

<p>"Go on ahead, I'll be there in a minute."</p>

<p>So she walked into the cabin. Veen was at the fire, back to the
door; he turned and he rose in surprise. "What you doin' here?"</p>

<p>She was out of breath from the long hike; she said nothing. Her
clothes were muddy; her hair, shaken loose by her exertions and
caught in overhanging branches, lay half down her neck and half
down her forehead. Never a pretty girl, never noticed, accustomed
to nothing but the strays and scraps of attention, she stood mute
before Veen with her heavy lips and irregular features fixed in
anxiety.</p>

<p>He said: "Where's Cal?"</p>

<p>She motioned toward the door.</p>

<p>Veen said, "Jesus Christ, is this one more of his crazy
notions?"</p>

<p>She moved her hands, she tried a strange laugh which came to an
abrupt ending and wheeled when she heard Cal come into the place.
He was grinning. "Meet my wife, Veen."</p>

<p>Veen looked long at his brother, and let his glance fall on the
girl; he turned to face the fire, he turned back and spoke quietly.
"You son-of-a-bitch."</p>

<p>"Stop that," said Cal. "Don't tell me..."</p>

<p>Veen said, "Shut up," and took Roxy's arm and went through the
doorway with her. He pointed to the creek. "You go over there and
stay till I call you." She didn't understand him and he had to give
her a small push to start her away.</p>

<p>At the creek she turned to find him watching her. He motioned
for her to go farther on and she walked another twenty feet and
squatted beside the water, hearing the voices of the two men
rise&mdash;Veen's voice running on with almost a shrillness in it,
Cal's words breaking in. She made nothing of the talk, but the
brawling quarrel was plain enough; then presently it died to a
lower pitch. She dropped one stone after another into the water,
becoming so absorbed in the chore that Veen, later appearing, had
to shout twice at her.</p>

<p>She returned to the cabin. Cal lay on one of the two bunks,
hands over his chest, eyes on the ceiling. He said nothing to her.
Veen stood at the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Well, girl," he said, "you're the cook&mdash;you keep
house."</p>

<p>She looked around anxiously; she saw a broom and went to it.
"Floor's swept already," said Veen. She laid the broom back and
stood in the corner with a straining-to-understand expression on
her face. He spoke to Cal. "I'll make my bed in the shed."</p>

<p>"Don't do it if you don't want," said Cal indifferently. "What
difference does it make?"</p>

<p>"You son-of-a-bitch," said Veen.</p>

<p>"Take your turn with her, too, if you want," said Cal.</p>

<p>"You want to know what I wish right now, Cal? I wish there was a
God and I wish he could catch you and slice you lengthwise one inch
at a time till your screamin' filled the world."</p>

<p>Cal Lockyear swung his head and stared over to his brother with
his pressed grin. Roxy suddenly came from her corner and took Veen
by the arms. She said: "I won't be in your way. You'll like me. I
like you a lot." She kissed him and peered into his face with her
hopeful eyes; her unpracticed laugh made its brief sound in the
room. Veen patted her shoulder and said, "That's all right, Roxy,"
and moved to the door. He paused there a moment. "Oh God, how I
wish it," and went into the yard.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
She settled into the cabin without authority or place and without
encouragement. Her power of self-expression had never been
developed; ignored by Lockyear, she had no chance to develop it
here. She was a poor cook and Cal swore at her and sometimes Veen
stepped in to give her help. Whenever she was puzzled or in trouble
it was to Veen she turned. Time went on. Rarely did she speak to
Cal unless he spoke first; when he set off on his frequent trips
she stood in the doorway to watch him go with the half-lighted
expression on her countenance and afterwards resumed her one
solitary amusement of walking by the creek, head down, toes kicking
at the rocks. At night she sat at the corner of the fireplace,
looking at nothing in particular, listening to nothing in
particular, for it was a silent cabin with little said between the
brothers. Occasionally a quarrel born of some silent conflict
between them which she neither saw nor understood would rise and
she would watch both men and be terrified and crawl deeper into her
isolation. Gradually the little dream of being a wife with the
possession and the assurance of other wives faded. It had never
been a clear dream; it had been only a shapeless thing moving
across the dim light of her world. She learned she could expect
from Cal nothing better than rough usage during the moment he
wanted her, and nothing but indifference afterwards. During his
peaceful periods he scarcely looked at her; when his mood of silent
fury came upon him, he frightened her. Since Veen was always kind
to her it came naturally about that she turned to him, and this was
presently noticeable to Cal. She was inept with her hands and one
afternoon she badly burned herself on the big kettle hanging over
the fire; she was usually stoic enough to endure injury without
comment but on this occasion the long accumulating fears and
repressions caught up with her in her pain and she burst into a
wild crying, and paced the cabin floor, and grew more incoherent
until she had worked herself into hysteria.</p>

<p>Summoned by the sound, Veen came in and caught her shoulders;
and she flung her arms around him and locked her body against him,
and in this attitude Cal found her when he walked through the front
doorway.</p>

<p>"Foolin' around my henhouse, ain't you, Veen?"</p>

<p>Veen pushed the girl into the yard and closed the door; and the
sound of quarreling rose inside again, higher and higher, and
presently she heard things slam against the walls, and Cal's steady
cursing, and the whacking of fists against flesh, and the crashing
of a body on the floor. She ran in from the creek and flung open
the door. Veen lay in the corner, mouth and nose bleeding; he had
taken his gun from its peg and now held it cocked against his
brother. Softly he said one thing over and over, "You
son-of-a-bitch, someday you'll scream. Oh, you son-of-a-bitch
someday you'll scream." Cal turned from the cabin.</p>

<p>He was soon back, his whole manner changed; he was excited about
something and seemed to have no more interest in the quarrel. He
seized his gun and went rapidly from the cabin. Veen said, "What's
up?" and followed him. Roxy, moving as far as the doorway, watched
the scene. Cal was laughing; he pointed diagonally across the yard
and across the creek to a small break in the trees. The break
became a ragged corridor extending perhaps a mile southeastward;
something along that corridor drew Cal's attention.</p>

<p>"See there," he said. "Way down. Looks like the back end of a
deer."</p>

<p>Veen squatted and set himself for a long look. "Indian," he
said.</p>

<p>"Been there, same position, for half an hour."</p>

<p>"Indian watchin' somethin'," said Veen.</p>

<p>Cal lifted the gun and clapped it snugly to shoulder and cheek.
"How far you say it is?"</p>

<p>"Half-mile or better. Don't do that. It'll just cause
trouble."</p>

<p>Cal settled into a long silence as he took aim; the muzzle of
the gun steadied itself, then crept fractionally upward. The
explosion was dry and flat, bouncing over the clearing, bounding
through the timber. The object on which Cal had aimed made a slight
turn and fell and became an indistinct blur on the ground. Both men
watched it a long time.</p>

<p>Veen said: "Just for nothin' you do things like that. He's
squirmin'. Gut shot. Don't leave him like that."</p>

<p>"Hell with him. One shot's enough."</p>

<p>"You finish it, or I will."</p>

<p>Cal rammed a new charge into the rifle, shook powder on the pan,
made another long aim and fired. Veen, watching from his crouched
position, said, "He jumped." Then, a long time later, he added
quietly, "That's all," and rose and went around the cabin.</p>

<p>It was then middle afternoon. Cal disappeared into the timber
with his rifle and was gone until suppertime. The savage mood was
on him&mdash;the swollen energy, the taut nerves&mdash;and he ate
without a word and lay on his bunk to stare upward through the gray
spiral of his pipe smoke, his very motionlessness sending strain
into the room; and suddenly he sprang from the bunk as though he
had passed his endurance and took his rifle and again
disappeared.</p>

<p>When he returned an hour later his gray eyes had a cat's green
shining in them. From his place beside the fire, Veen narrowly
watched the signs of deviltry on his brother's face. Cal laid out
the tin cups and hauled the whisky jug from beneath his bunk, he
filled the cups, he took his own, he signaled at the others. Then
he said to the wondering Roxy: "Go on&mdash;might do you some
good." He watched her sip at the liquor, and press her mouth
together, and sip again.</p>

<p>"Go slow, Roxy," said Veen. "You don't know that stuff." He
stared at his brother. "What you up to now?"</p>

<p>Cal sat on the edge of his bunk and made short, urging motions
at Roxy. "Drink for the bottom."</p>

<p>She was soon drunk. There was no more tolerance for liquor in
her than in an Indian. She stood spraddle-legged, she let the cup
and its remaining whisky drop. Dumbness came upon her. Her lips
thickened, her jaws moved stubbornly forward, her eyes turned on
Cal, round and roused. She moved toward the bunk with difficulty
and sank beside him. She got her arms around him, and buried her
head in his chest, and began to undulate her body against him.</p>

<p>He brought his half-closed hand against her chin, knocking back
her head; he laid his forearm against her chest and broke her grip
and shoved her away. She slid from bunk to floor. She got on her
hands and knees and crawled a few feet and settled and rolled on
her back. She closed her eyes; she opened them and looked directly
at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"She likes you best," said Cal.</p>

<p>"Let her alone," said Veen.</p>

<p>"Ugliest God-damned creature I ever saw," said Cal, "but just
right for a lame bastard like you."</p>

<p>"What'd you bring her here for?"</p>

<p>"I wanted a white woman for a change. This is all I could get.
That ought to make you laugh. This is all I could get. The
country's full of women and they're marryin' men I could break in
two with my hands, slow cattle that won't fight, that stink when
they sweat, that huddle in herds like sheep. And all I can get is a
woman even those cattle won't have."</p>

<p>He rose from the bunk and stepped over Roxy, a foot on either
side of her. Her glance wavered from the ceiling to his face; she
rolled her head slowly on the floor. Lockyear reached out, caught
her dress at the neck line and ripped it apart in one long motion,
and he gripped her petticoat and tore it straight down. She made no
protest; she watched him steadily.</p>

<p>"You son-of-a-bitch," said Veen.</p>

<p>"That's all I could get," said Cal. "I hate the whole God-damned
race of women. They've got us, they can make us crazy, they can
laugh at us and go away. She'd do it too if she could. If there was
one other man in this world who'd have her, she'd run away from me.
That's why I've got her, because nobody else wants her. I don't
know whether to use her or put my foot in her belly and kick her to
pieces."</p>

<p>Veen reached over his head in a quick motion and brought his gun
down. "You fetched her here. I didn't want it&mdash;but you fetched
her and now, by God, you take care of her."</p>

<p>Cal stepped away from her and settled on his bunk. "You sleep
with her tonight. She might as well be useful."</p>

<p>Veen rose, watching Roxy, watching his brother. "When you're
crazy, God knows what you'll do." He put his gun aside and went
over to Roxy. He lifted her with some difficulty and carried her to
the shed and laid her on his blankets, and returned to the cabin
for his gun and for the blankets on the other bunk. He said nothing
to Cal, who sat crouched, eyes fixed to the floor, big shoulder
muscles hardened, lost in his discontent. When he got to the shed,
Veen settled beside her and felt the occasional tremor of her body
before she fell asleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter 27</h2>

<p>THE deer were well away from the settlement and Burnett cruised
the ridges a full morning before he saw a buck working at the
brushy browse in a ravine below him. The better part of the
afternoon was gone when he got it home and butchered it. Half of it
he hung in the shed for himself; the other half he divided again
and set off down the trail, leaving some of the meat at Lattimore's
and taking the rest on to Mrs. Irish.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "you sit right here and I'll make supper."</p>

<p>She had been doing man's work as well as woman's work; she was
thin and her hands were rough and the smile she gave him came out
with the crackling suddenness of unaccustomed muscles responding.
She was about four years older than he was. He remembered her at
the beginning of the wagon trip as an attractive, slightly careless
married woman whose high-tempered husband had more than once staged
a quarrel with her inside their wagon; but that liveliness was
pretty much extinguished. Going into the yard to chop wood while he
waited for supper, he began to think of his other neighbors, to
estimate the changes made within them by the trip, and he was on
this line of thought when Watt Irish came in from the hills with
his gun, empty-handed and discouraged. He said, "Hello," to Burnett
and went to the cabin. Burnett heard Mrs. Irish speak to Watt and
heard the boy's short answer; then Watt, obviously instructed to
keep Burnett company, emerged from the cabin and sat on the
woodpile.</p>

<p>"No luck?"</p>

<p>"No sign," said Watt. "Where'd you get yours?"</p>

<p>"About three miles south and east of Lord's."</p>

<p>"I'll try there," said Watt. There had been no change in him
since the gorge. He had gained no weight, and perhaps had lost a
little, for his shoulders were sharp points beneath the cotton
shirt and his arms and hands were bony. He talked as a man would
talk and on his face was a dry weariness.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Irish called them in for supper Burnett noticed she
had taken time to do over her hair and change her dress. Watt gave
her a curious stare as he sat down to the table, and thereafter
concerned himself with his food. She had cut three good steaks from
the venison rump and had ground enough wheat in her coffee mill to
make gravy; from this same whole dark flour she had made biscuits.
This, with coffee, was the meal.</p>

<p>When they were through Mrs. Irish rose to clear the table.
"Watt," she said, "we've got Gay's big file and he'll be needing
it. You put on a coat and take it back."</p>

<p>Watt left the cabin with some reluctance and Mrs. Irish followed
him into the gathering twilight and walked on a few yards with him;
when she came back she was livelier than Burnett had seen her for
many weeks.</p>

<p>He said: "I'd better be moving on."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "sit awhile and light your pipe. I've not had
the smell of a man's tobacco smoke for so long."</p>

<p>Winter's darkness rolled over the meadow and familiar landmarks
vanished. From the doorway Burnett watched Billy Lord's hill turn
into a conelike shadow; the roundabout tree spires scratched a
ragged silhouette across a star-speckled sky, the far lights of
Collingwood's cabin set forth their wavering wink. He got a big
root chunk from the woodpile and laid it on the fire; he filled his
pipe and found a towel for the dishes.</p>

<p>"You don't have to do that," said Mrs. Irish. She stopped her
work a moment and bent her head into the smoke of his pipe. "That's
so good. I used to hate it. I was spoiled."</p>

<p>The firelight and her own mood erased the lines of her face. He
had never thought of her except as Watt's mother or as a widow, but
it occurred to him that she was younger than his notion of her. She
had round arms and her mouth was pleasing; her hair was black and
heavy, her body looked comfortable to him.</p>

<p>She said: "I had an easy life as a girl and when I got married
to Irish and started house with a very poor man I sometimes was
sorry for myself. I wish I could tell girls how foolish it is to be
proud. They're young, they're good-looking, they make men dance at
their heels&mdash;and they've got everything their way. It's
nothing they've earned, it's just being young. One day they'll wake
to find the tide turned, and they've got to beg for the smiles they
used to take for granted. I think it's the most cruel day in life."
She looked thoughtfully into the dishpan, and corrected herself.
"No, the second most cruel day."</p>

<p>"What's the other?"</p>

<p>"When you look at your child and know he's missed too much, and
it's too late."</p>

<p>"Watt's going to be all right," he said.</p>

<p>She raised her head and shook it slightly and he saw how brutal
the thought was with her for a moment; then she went on with her
washing. "You've been nice to us. I don't know why you should.
You're nice to a lot of people."</p>

<p>"Common thing."</p>

<p>"Not so common. People have to be hurt before they understand
much. Healthy people and happy people&mdash;they don't know."</p>

<p>"I'll be damned," he said mildly. She threw him a side-glance,
and presently they both laughed. When the dishes were done he hung
up the towel to dry; he hunted for the broom and swept the floor
and shook the fire together and stood by it with his pipe. "How
much wheat have you got left?" he asked.</p>

<p>"About three sacks," she said. "Watt's awful sick of it. Boys
hate plain food. I've got a little corn but I hate to touch
it."</p>

<p>"Don't do it. That's your seed. The first good day of spring
I'll come around to break your garden lot. Any salt meat left?"</p>

<p>"Barrel's empty. We've a little molasses and some tea. It
marvels me to see how little people can live on. I don't know how
we're doing it and I lie awake so scared sometimes I shake. When I
think of how much we wasted from the table in the old days, it just
seems sinful. I'll never again throw a scrap of food away, so long
as I live."</p>

<p>"We may get hungry before summer, but nobody's going to let
anybody else starve."</p>

<p>He watched her move about the small room to finish her chores.
Her glance came to him and she smiled and went on with her work,
but the smile faded and she seemed to grow hurried or disinterested
in what she was doing, and she removed her apron and came to the
fire. "It's nice to know we've got somebody to lean on. I wish I
had some liquor to give you a drink. I wish I could help somehow.
Have you got any clothes you need mended?"</p>

<p>"What I've goes too ragged to patch."</p>

<p>"You take good care of yourself." He caught a remarkably direct
glance from her and noticed the growing color on her face. She
seemed uneasy with herself, she made another aimless circle of the
room and returned to the fire. "People think crazy things
sometimes, don't they?"</p>

<p>"That's living alone."</p>

<p>"It's not good." She turned to the doorway and watched the
night; he felt tightness close around and sensation rippled through
him and he was alert. Her voice roughened. "My neighbors are good
to me&mdash;in every way except their advice to accept my lot and
be cheerful. They don't know&mdash;they have got their comfort. I
swear, I sometimes think if a one-legged heathen of a man should
come through here I'd make eyes at him." She caught herself. "I
shouldn't say that."</p>

<p>He knocked the ashes of his pipe into the fire and crossed the
room. She had her back to him, blocking the door. "Cabin fever," he
said.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing when we're young that we don't know what
waits us. Lot White says we deserve what happens to us because
we're sinners. What sin did Watt commit to grow up like he's
growing? It'll take more preachers than the world's got to make me
believe that. When Lot gets to talking about how wonderful a place
heaven is, I think of how Irish used to say what a wonderful place
Oregon would be. It's the same thing. We keep fooling
ourselves."</p>

<p>"Look here," he said. "Watt's going to wind up with six hundred
forty acres of land and you'll both look back and laugh at the
troubles you've had. He's not going to starve, and neither are
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, food, food," she said. She continued to look into the
darkness. Her stillness seemed to grow and to become a waiting. He
noticed the preoccupied expression she wore, the rigidness of her
body. She drew a long breath, murmuring, "I suppose it'll be at
least an hour before Watt gets back," and she swung and let her
eyes touch him. She held the glance long enough to embarrass him
and when she observed it she gave out a small laugh and stepped
aside.</p>

<p>He moved into the yard, conscious of the air's coolness on his
face; he had grown very warm. "Thanks for the meal," he said.</p>

<p>"Come again, Rice."</p>

<p>"All right," he said. The stirred-up expression had left her;
her eyes were rather sad, rather puzzled. She murmured, "Good
night," and turned into the cabin.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter 28</h2>

<p>HOMEWARD bound, he found neighbors gathered at Lattimore's and
Lattimore shouted, "Come in&mdash;come in." He spoke to the Bucks
and the Mclvers and the Kerns and the Millards. Moss Rinearson and
Edna were there. He hadn't seen her since her marriage, but there
was no change; she came around Lorenzo Buck and put a hand on
Rice's arm and kissed him.</p>

<p>Lattimore said, "Look out, girl, you got a husband here."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Edna, "Moss knows I like Rice."</p>

<p>"And whut else does he know?" said Lattimore cheerfully. "Never
mind, Moss. First month of marriage is always the hardest."</p>

<p>"Why," said Moss, "I figure the first month was mighty good,"
and ducked his head at the crowd's laughter.</p>

<p>McIver turned to Burnett. "Been a couple of Molallies sneakin'
around today. See anything along the trail?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Lattimore said, "Long hike to Gay's, ain't it, Rice?" and winked
at the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lattimore said, "Everybody don't think what you're always
athinkin'."</p>

<p>"Well, that's too bad," said Lattimore. "Makes damned good
thinkin'."</p>

<p>Edna stepped to the back of the small room and watched Rice
between narrow-shuttered lids. She ignored Moss, she ignored the
others; she watched Rice and her lips were warm pillows
waiting.</p>

<p>"They were over at Crabtree's," said McIver, still talking about
the two Indians. "Crabtree was gone and they scared hell out of the
women. Bullied 'em around and got some food and went away."</p>

<p>"Hungry season," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"I don't like it," said McIver.</p>

<p>Mrs. Buck drew her shoulders together. "It reminds me of Grandma
Hedges when she was captured."</p>

<p>Buck looked at her. "I don't believe I've heard that story."</p>

<p>"We've not been married so long I've told you all my stories,"
said Mrs. Buck. "It's wise to keep a few for something fresh."</p>

<p>"Men don't think so," said Mrs. Millard. "They tell 'em, and
tell 'em, and tell 'em, and each time the story gets bigger and the
man's more of a hero."</p>

<p>Buck said, "Tell that story, Sophie."</p>

<p>"My grandmother lived in Kentucky, back on the edge&mdash;way
back where the Scotch-Irish went to get away from people. I don't
know why those men always hated to live in towns or near anybody.
Grandmother says there weren't any neighbors around her closer than
twenty miles. She was fourteen and had ten brothers and sisters and
her mother at the time was only thirty-six. They had a big cabin
and a barn and maybe twenty acres of clear land, everything else
was hills and trees. Her father was a great hunter, and when he
wasn't hunting he'd be scouting for the soldiers that went through,
or he'd be trading horses a long way off.</p>

<p>"Grandmother's mother raised that family. Well, it was a time
when the Indians were bad and Grandmother's father was gone. One
afternoon, a little before dark, the Indians came. Grandmother's
mother got the children inside the house and barred the door.
There's one thing Grandmother's father had done&mdash;he'd built a
tunnel from beneath the floor of the cabin to the barn, and the
barn was close by the trees. So when she got the door barred
Grandmother's mother kissed Grandmother and the girls and the
youngest boys and sent them through the tunnel. The oldest boys
stayed to help fight.</p>

<p>"Grandmother got to the barn and sneaked through the back way
into the trees with the other children. By then the clearing was
full of Indians and the top of the cabin was burning. A lot of
Indians were roaming around the barn and Grandmother figured they'd
find the tracks of the children pretty soon, so she led them to a
creek and told them to wade along the creek as far as they could;
then she went back to the edge of the clearing thinking that maybe
her mother and the other boys would come through the tunnel. But
while she was there the Indians broke into the cabin and in a
little while they brought her mother out&mdash;the boys must have
been killed in the cabin, because she never saw them again. She
said her mother's hair was very long, almost to her knees; she'd
measured it once when she brushed it. The Indians unpinned the hair
and one Indian, very tall and powerful, gripped her mother by the
hair and brained her with a club; and then he scalped her and went
around the meadow, waving that long hank of yellow hair.</p>

<p>"Grandmother went back to the children and told them to keep
wading in the creek for another hour&mdash;it was growing dark
then&mdash;and then she told them to strike straight north toward
Fort Mims and she showed them the star to go by. After that she
began to walk in the other direction. She was about ten miles from
home when daylight came; and about an hour later some Indians came
right through the brush and caught her. She saw more scalps in the
party. She recognized every one of the little brothers' and
sisters' scalps. So she was alone. Well, she was fourteen and a
large girl and they didn't kill her. They marched her all that day
and all next day and finally brought her to a village where some
Indian women took her and beat her awhile and set the Indian
children against her. But an Indian man liked her and made her his
squaw and she lived in that village for about three years. She had
two babies by the Indian but each time she smothered the babies.
She said that when she was a captive she'd sometimes get awful blue
and then she'd go to the lodge of the big Indian who'd killed her
mother. He had all his scalps hanging in the lodge. And she'd go
touch the hair of her mother's scalp&mdash;she said the color of
the hair hardly changed at all&mdash;and it would make her feel
better. I remember one time asking her if it wasn't a bad feeling
to see it hanging there. 'No,' she said, 'life's life and death's
death and that's all of it, and there's no use borrowin' from one
side what belongs to the other.' When she was almost seventeen a
band of white men came onto the camp&mdash;they had heard there was
a white woman captive in it&mdash;and killed almost every Indian,
even the women and the older children, and took Grandmother back to
the settlements. There was a young man in that party and he took
her to the home of his people, and about a month later they were
married."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lattimore said: "She ever see her father again?"</p>

<p>"She was about thirty when a man came through the country and
stopped to ask some directions and he looked at her a long time and
he said 'Ain't you Maria?'&mdash;and it was her father. She said
she cried a little, not so much for her father, but because it
brought back the memory of her mother and her brothers and sisters.
Her father stayed over one night with them. Next morning he said
good-by and went on. She never heard of him again."</p>

<p>Silence hung heavy over them. Mrs. Buck looked into the fire
with a kind, dark expression; she was thinking far back. Mrs.
Lattimore stirred uneasily. All the men were thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Things were hard on people in those days," said Mrs. Buck.</p>

<p>"I don't like the notion of those Molallies creepin' around
here," said Mrs. Lattimore. "Who knows they don't mean to come down
here some night and kill us all?"</p>

<p>"If they get to botherin' us much more," said Ryal McIver, "we
better go up there."</p>

<p>Burnett said: "Not worth worrying about. They're just a few
miserable people living in half a dozen hardscrabble lodges."</p>

<p>"You'd regret saying that if they came down and did it," said
Elam Walker.</p>

<p>Burnett held his peace. A winter in a Crow lodge had shown him
the inside of a people as vain, as gentle, as easily hurt, as
lovelorn, as practical, as faithful as these here in Lattimore's
cabin, but nothing was gained by saying it; for cruelty and
infidelity between red and white had put the thing past saving.
Beyond the cabin somewhere a sound began to grow. He turned through
the doorway, listening. In a moment Ryal McIver came out. "What is
it?"</p>

<p>"Hear that?"</p>

<p>McIver listened. He said, "No." Then he said, "Yes, I do," and
called quietly into the cabin. The rest of the men stepped into the
yard and women stirred around the room with their growing
nervousness. The sound grew stronger on the trail eastward and
became the ragged running of somebody. Ryal returned to the cabin
to get his gun, followed by the others, and Mrs. Lattimore said
sharply, "Oh, God, Lattimore, we goin' to be scalped?" With the
steady rushing of the unknown person's feet came presently the
harsh in-and-out sawing of breath. Stooped dawn, Burnett saw the
wavering outline of the fugitive in the meadow. He spoke to
Lattimore, who seemed inclined to shoot.</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;just one out there."</p>

<p>The runner rushed over the yard and entered the fan of cabin
light. It was Roxy, hair down from her running, mud splashed over
her clothes. She brushed by Burnett and the other men and went into
the cabin; she slammed the door against the men in the yard.</p>

<p>"Well, what the God-damn' hell," grumbled Lattimore. He lifted
the latch and gave the door a kick with his foot to show his
displeasure. Over the shoulders of the other men who followed
Lattimore in, Burnett saw Roxy backed against the fireplace. She
used her fingers to throw her loose hair behind her. "I ain't goin'
back," she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Millard said: "He hurt you, girl? He mean to you Beat you?"
Roxy watched Mrs. Millard with uneasy suspicion. "I ain't goin'
back," she said sullenly, "but I won't tell you why."</p>

<p>Burnett retreated from the doorway, turned the cabin's corner
and waited in the shadows; for he had caught another sound on the
trail, this time the rapid beating of a horse's feet; then he
corrected himself&mdash;no, two horses. The horses left the trees
and ran on over the meadow into the cabin light. Cal Lockyear was
on one horse and led the other. He said, "Roxy," and got down and
faced Lattimore at the doorway; he laid an arm on Lattimore's chest
and shoved the man aside and stepped into the room. His voice went
roughly at the girl. "If you want to leave me, do it in the
daytime. Tell me you want to leave and I'll furnish a horse and
take you to your people, but, by God, don't play this running-away
stuff with me and make folks think I'm bad to you. You come out
here and get on this horse."</p>

<p>Burnett turned the corner of the house and passed through the
doorway, thus coming directly behind Lockyear. Roxy faced Lockyear,
chin and mouth stubborn, eyes flat, the anxious and peering look
upon her. She shook her head. "Don't make me do that again."</p>

<p>"Do what?" said Mrs. Millard.</p>

<p>Lockyear said to Mrs. Millard, "It's none of your business."</p>

<p>Mrs. Millard's rage rose and she dumped its acid into Lockyear's
face. "You dog, you! You jackass&mdash;you overgrown baby goin'
around making faces at people. Tell me what to do? Why, I'll tell
you what I'll do. I'll take this gun and do what these men have not
got the spunk to do. I'll brain you with it or I'll shoot you with
it as somebody ought to have done it long ago."</p>

<p>Mrs. Millard lifted the gun and glanced at its pan; she made a
wicked sound of annoyance when she discovered no powder in the pan
and she started forward in the little room with the gun poked
forward like a sword. Millard reached out and seized it from her.
"That will do," he said.</p>

<p>"Millard!"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "that will do."</p>

<p>Lockyear stared at her. "Your husband ought to break your damned
neck."</p>

<p>"That will do, too," said Millard.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me that way," Lockyear warned him.</p>

<p>"I'm about out of patience in both directions," said Millard.
"Now you mind your business or I'll grab you by the neck and take
you to the creek and drown you like a cat."</p>

<p>Lockyear said, "Don't talk to me that way."</p>

<p>"Do your business here and get on."</p>

<p>Lockyear turned to Roxy. "Come out of here."</p>

<p>"You don't have to do it," said Mrs. Millard.</p>

<p>Millard shook his head at his wife. "It is not your affair. He's
the husband and she's the wife and what goes between them ain't for
us."</p>

<p>"Come out of there," repeated Lockyear.</p>

<p>"Roxy," said Burnett, "do what you please."</p>

<p>Lockyear pulled his shoulders around, saw Burnett and swore at
him. "Where were <i>you?"</i></p>

<p>Burnett laughed at him. "Roxy," he repeated, "do what you want."
The girl had no mind for all the voices going at her. She laid her
peering glance upon Lockyear. "You won't do that to me any
more?"</p>

<p>"Come out of here," said Lockyear.</p>

<p>Satisfaction quickened Roxy's expression. Rarely in her life had
she received notice and this scene comforted her, for she was the
center of it, she was looked upon, talked to, made important. She
lifted her chin and was proud of herself. "Well," she said, "I
guess I'm your wife," and went over the room. Burnett stepped back
through the doorway to let Lockyear and Roxy come out; he watched
them rise to their saddles and he watched Lockyear's glance reach
for him.</p>

<p>"Played Sioux with me," Lockyear said to him. "You want to play
Sioux, I'll play Sioux, and we'll see how that comes out."</p>

<p>Burnett laughed at him. "Always get yourself in a crossfire,
Cal."</p>

<p>The two moved across the meadow. Going to his own horse, Burnett
heard Mrs. Millard's voice intemperately rising.</p>

<p>"You heard what she said. She said: 'Don't do that to me again.'
Oh, God, it's horrible to think about! He'll kill her. You men,
have you got no feelings?"</p>

<p>Drifting over the meadow Burnett caught Millard's dry rejoinder.
"Man and wife is man and wife&mdash;foolish to interfere." When he
reached the edge of the timber Burnett turned to discover Edna in
the doorway, the light framing her unmistakable figure. She had
wanted to talk to him. She was experienced enough to see into him
and to understand there were parts of her scattered all through him
as coals waiting a breath of air to flame again; she was certain
she could carry on where she had left off, if it pleased her.</p>

<p>Half through the woods he stopped the horse to listen into the
curdled shadows. There had been no definite sound&mdash;only the
impression of a sound, only the feeling that somewhere a motion had
occurred; it was the kind of thing to which he was particularly
responsive and always had been from his earliest outdoor training;
and so he sat quiet a long while, moving his head in compass-needle
fashion to catch the next warning; there was none, and he went on
to the clearing, put away the horse and entered the cabin.</p>

<p>The fire was only a splinter of red on the hearth. He stood
before it a moment, catching the steady wash of the creek over the
rock ledge; then he turned to the doorway and squatted down,
scanning the yard before him, and in another moment he retreated to
the cabin's back side, pulled away the canvas which served as a
temporary break against the window aperture, and crawled through.
He stood against the outer wall, searching the night; he lifted his
gun and drifted toward the lean-to barn, and circled it and paused
to watch his front door from the distance of fifty feet. Beyond the
cabin a streak of shadow floated against the greater backdrop of
black, and when he noticed it Burnett went to the ground and crept
forward belly-flat.</p>

<p>The shadow strengthened before him; the shadow swung, advancing
upon the cabin's door with short stop-and-go motions. Twenty feet
from the door the shadow rose higher and went the last twenty feet
to the cabin in a silent rush and lodged motionless against the log
wall. Burnett crawled on until the intruder's shape took form
against the logs&mdash;bent over and now beginning to creep toward
the nearby doorway. Burnett changed his direction, angling for the
cabin's corner; when the shape reached the doorway and hung close
upon its edge, Burnett ran his hand along the earth until he found
a creek's stone the size of a musket ball, gathered his knees
beneath him and threw the stone across the yard.</p>

<p>The small report of its landing flung the prowler around and
sent him away from it, straight upon Burnett. Half risen, Burnett
wrapped his arms around the man as the latter plunged into him. The
smell told him enough; it was an Indian he had trapped. He threw
the Indian to the ground, struck him hard in the belly with his
knee and weathered through the explosion of the Indian's energy. He
had learned from Hawn the skeleton words of the Chinook jargon and,
both arms anchoring the Indian's hands against the possible use of
a knife, he tried out his learning. <i>"Tillicum&mdash;kopet,
kopet."</i></p>

<p>The Indian surged against Burnett and brought his stony knees
into Burnett's flank. Burnett said, "Well, the hell with you, stop
it, <i>kopet,"</i> and let go his grip long enough to bring the
jarring heel of his palm full force against the Indian's head. That
stilled the Indian. He grumbled something between the in-and-out
saw of wind. Burnett slapped his hand around the Indian's waist and
found the knife he expected, and hauled it from its sheath and
threw it across the yard. Then he got up.</p>

<p><i>"Sikh tillicum,"</i> he said.</p>

<p>The Indian remained still on the earth&mdash;too still. Burnett
stepped farther back and waited. The Indian rolled and rose in one
motion and flung himself into the night, the padding of his feet
dying at last below the sound of the creek. Burnett got his rifle
from the ground, found the knife and went into his cabin to build a
fire.</p>

<p>It was three days until Christmas and somehow the encounter with
the Indian took him back to the rougher years, reminding him that
during his adult life most of these holidays had been spent in the
camps of men a long way from home. Going backward in his mind, he
tallied them: Winter camp in Jackson's Hole; the Crow village on
the Green; on the side of a bare mountain in Sonora with fourteen
men, nine of whom he knew were dead; in a freight camp halfway
between St. Louis and Santa Fe. They were a little difficult to
pick up as he moved farther into the past. One of them stood out
bright against the rest, this one shared with a woman in New
Orleans. Down in the Old Quarter he ran into Steve Rich, who had
made the march with him across the Sonora desert, and they got to
talking about it, and two women came along and Steve knew them and
they went to supper. All Steve ever said about her was, "This is
Rose," and then he went off with the other woman.</p>

<p>At this moment, reaching with his memory to bring her before
him, he recalled only a face&mdash;now anonymous&mdash;against
black loose hair on a pillow. She had believed too much in other
men to believe him, and he was careless and had no honor to think
about; and it went well with them, nothing asked, nothing expected.
In the beginning he had expected it to be a meeting, a parting, and
no change for either; at the end of it he knew that nobody walked
away intact from such a thing. For on the last day he had felt
loss; and her voice, murmuring to him, was no longer hard. Nothing
was free, nothing without consequence. When he thought of her now
it wasn't the physical pleasure which came back; he had not wanted
to walk the streets of New Orleans alone and she had not wanted to
be alone; and they had joined to escape the loneliness. That's what
he had learned from her&mdash;that loneliness was something nobody
could live with too long. When he got to thinking about it he
realized that so much of what he believed true came of these chance
meetings with other human beings. He touched them and something of
their quality rubbed off on him. As with old Frank Mount who had
said: "Old Ben's out here and I got to help old Ben," and had
walked from the safe shelter of a winter cabin into the blind wall
of a Rocky Mountain blizzard. Whenever he thought of courage, his
own or another man's, it was Frank Mount who set the standard.
Pierre Lazarus had set another standard for him. Pierre showed up
in camp one night as the sole survivor of a trapping party jumped
by the Blackfeet. He had been twenty days lost, he was skin and
bones and his bare feet appeared as two chunks of decayed meat. But
all of that ordeal he boiled into a few words. "Ran three days,
walked ten, swam one, and crawled six." Then he had laughed at the
sight of his feet. "Sure as hell got rid of my corns."</p>

<p>Good people, good people, walking from God knows where to God
knows where, with nothing but bad water, poor luck and not much
relief along the way. Tick Petty had said that. Then he had said,
"But there must be a big village at the end of this trail, or why's
everybody walkin' on it?"</p>

<p>That was the year they worked the Yellowstone and Joe Torpenning
was in the party; and Joe said to Tick Petty: "What you want to do
in that big village, Tick?"</p>

<p>"Well, I want a bath and I want a shave, and I want a meal.
That'll take me a couple hours. How long we goin' to spend in this
place, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Eternity," said Joe.</p>

<p>"Then I want a big drunk. That will take a couple days. Then I
want a bed I can sink two feet deep in, and I want none of your
damned wool blankets or your lumped-up quilts for cover. I want my
blankets to be six beautiful women. And that's eternity for
me."</p>

<p>Joe Torpenning said: "There's the trouble with heaven. It's too
good, it's everything we ain't got here. It's no mud, no fleas, no
rheumatism, no work; it's perfect. You ever find a place like
that?"</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Burnett turned to his bunk and drew out his money belt to count his
wealth. A sound rose over the creek's clatter. He pushed the belt
back into the blankets and got his gun and left the cabin, finding
shelter at the edge of the lean-to. The beat of two horses came on,
from the direction of Hawn's; he saw the shadows rise against the
black, he heard the rattle of bridle chains and the windy heave of
the pressed animals. Cal Lockyear's voice was distinct. "Ease off,
Whit."</p>

<p>The horses dropped to a fast walk. Lockyear and Whit Rinearson
came abreast Burnett and went by. He heard Whit say:</p>

<p>"Take a shot through the logs?"</p>

<p>"Keep on now. We got a long way to go." Horses and men presently
faded into the trees westward.</p>

<p>He returned to the cabin and sat by the fire, thinking of the
money; thinking of what he meant to do. The idea had come to him
suddenly.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He was rigging the horses of his pack outfit, when Edna walked into
the yard the following morning. She said: "Where you going?"</p>

<p>"Prospecting around," he said. "See what the country's
like."</p>

<p>"You're not going to move away?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She stepped into the cabin and paused at the fire. He kept on
with his chore and didn't follow her until he was finished with it.
She had a smile waiting for him but she was displeased. "You're so
busy you can't talk to me? It wasn't that way once."</p>

<p>"Where's Moss?"</p>

<p>"He went home. I'm staying a couple days with the folks."</p>

<p>"Trouble?"</p>

<p>The question amused her. "Don't you think I know how to be a
wife?"</p>

<p>"Damned well."</p>

<p>She laughed, and her head lifted with its gesture of
self-confidence. "You ought to know," she said. But as she
continued to watch him her attitude changed. She was dissatisfied
with him. "You're different."</p>

<p>"I'm different, you're married, we're both different."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "don't talk silly. People don't change because
Lot White waves his hand at them and says they're married. Am I
supposed to quit talking to everybody else because I'm married?
I'll not do it."</p>

<p>"Moss has got something to say about it."</p>

<p>"I took him as he was, and he can do the same with me. I won't
shirk anything. But I won't change." She grew restless. "What do I
bother talking about it for? I shouldn't have come. It's for me to
worry about Moss, not for you, but if it bothers you, I won't come
again."</p>

<p>"That's better."</p>

<p>"You said if there was ever anything you could do for me, I was
to tell you. You didn't mean it. You were just trying to make me
think you were grieving because I married Moss."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I only wanted to say hello."</p>

<p>"You want me to say how much I miss you. You want me to look bad
and feel sad, to be all busted up."</p>

<p>She said: "You never meant anything you said to me. It was just
playing, so you could have your way. You had your way and you were
glad when I married Moss, so you wouldn't have to worry about me
any more."</p>

<p>"You're angry because I don't cry. You want to scratch me."</p>

<p>"Well," she said sullenly, "is it so easy for you to forget
everything? It must be. You're running after Katherine now. You
turned right from me to her. It didn't cause you any trouble at
all."</p>

<p>"You're the one that got married. I didn't."</p>

<p>She said: "That had to be. But does it change anything about you
and me? Can you be close to me and not think of&mdash;of that?"</p>

<p>As soon as he came to her she had her arms ready for him and her
kiss was the same lively thing. She made a groaning sound in her
throat, she put her mouth aside, murmuring: "All week long I've
thought and thought. You didn't want me enough. There was always
something, always something. It just got longer and longer and I
knew Moss wanted me and I couldn't wait any more."</p>

<p>He brought her head back to him and felt the laughter inside her
body. "You've not changed." She looked to the bunk for a moment and
then caught his glance. The hint was there. "I know I hurt you when
I got married. I saw it. I almost cried. I hate to think of you
lonely, Rice. I just don't want you lonely." She made half a
gesture with her hand, she whispered, "It wouldn't be the same with
any other man. But we know each other, don't we? Would it be so
wrong?"</p>

<p>"How about Moss?"</p>

<p>She said, "Oh, never mind him."</p>

<p>"I don't," he said. "I don't give a damn about him."</p>

<p>"I knew you didn't. Men don't think about that. So don't talk
about him."</p>

<p>"I think about you, though."</p>

<p>Her manner shortened. "I can think about myself. You had your
way. What's to be sorry for now?"</p>

<p>He had never been able to speak to her as he wished. Looking
upon her, the fancies in him went wild; but when he came to say the
words, they wouldn't match his feeling&mdash;they were like the
squeaks of a slate pencil against thunder; and her smiling way of
listening to him did the rest&mdash;for he knew the intense
practicalness of her nature would make the words seem foolish to
her and, in turn, to him.</p>

<p>"You know what I'd do for you," he said. "You know you can come
here, any time, and start the whole thing over. I'd break my damned
neck, I'd cheat Moss or kill Lockyear. I don't know what we had
between us, but so long as you're around I can't keep my hands off
you. Maybe there was more than that&mdash;I don't know&mdash;but
it's a little late now to find out. What do you want to do, come
around here once a month, keep the thing burning? I don't want it.
Whatever it is, I want it dead."</p>

<p>She listened to him, head tilted, a trace of laughter in the
engrossed interest of her face. She should have been offended at
his bluntness but instead it pleased her to hear him, it was one
more meal for her self-confidence. She murmured, "All right, Rice,
go ahead and kill it," and she moved to him and put her arms around
him. "Lover&mdash;lover." She kissed him and passed through the
doorway. She was happy. When he followed her to the yard she teased
him with her returned smile. "I won't like it if you go around
other women, having your way. I know too much about you. I know
just what you'll say, just what you'll try to do." Her imagination
made a picture of it and she ceased to be pleased. "And, damn you,
you'll probably get your way."</p>

<p>"You've got a man, Edna. What's this for&mdash;what for?"</p>

<p>The smile dimmed, her face settled and became heavy. She shook
her head. "Well," she said, "someday&mdash;maybe&mdash;someday..."
She shrugged her shoulders and started down the trail.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said. He saddled his horse, banked the fire and
closed the door. Then a thought took him into the cabin again and
he came out with the Indian's knife and stuck it into the outer
cabin wall. Walking the trail with her he explained the fight with
the Indian. "If he comes back he'll see the knife."</p>

<p>"He tried to rob you, maybe kill you. Why fool with him?"</p>

<p>"I want him to understand I put the knife there for him to take.
All his life he's been trained to be afraid of anybody strange.
White people have got the same thing in them. So, somebody makes a
quick move and somebody gets killed&mdash;and there it goes
again."</p>

<p>"Don't you trust an Indian. You'll get killed trying to be
kind."</p>

<p>"If you lived in one of their lodges," he said, "you'd hear them
say the same thing about us. People get afraid and build walls.
Tribes build walls. Settlements build walls. The world is full of
walls. That's a hell of a way to live."</p>

<p>"That Indian won't thank you. He'll think you're easy and try to
rob you again. Indian or white people, don't you take on anybody's
troubles. Don't be like Mrs. Millard, always fretting about things
that are wrong. Nobody likes her for it. She ought to mind her own
business. We all ought to." Her smile took on its meaningful form.
"You and I. That's our business."</p>

<p>They came to the Lattimore clearing. He got into his saddle and
looked down and for a moment he regretted not taking possession of
her in the cabin. The shadowed mockery was in her eyes as she
witnessed his disturbance and she was inwardly laughing at him. It
was a queer thing that they should know each other so well in this
one thing, and fit so well, yet be strangers otherwise.</p>

<p>"We'll see each other soon," she said.</p>

<p>"I expect so."</p>

<p>"Next time don't be so slow."</p>

<p>He said: "There's an end to this, Edna."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "don't always be troubled about how things ought
to be, or end, or start, or anything. Let things take care of
themselves." She smiled at him as he moved away.</p>

<p>He passed Buck's and Monteith's and stopped at Mrs. Irish's for
a moment. "You hear anybody go by here last night?"</p>

<p>"They went over the meadow and through Lord's notch. I think I
heard two."</p>

<p>He followed the creek past one donation claim and another; he
paused at Gay's and in another hour he reached the break of the
bench and let himself into the prairie. Winter's soft, blue-cast
atmosphere dulled the scene before him, the board-flat miles
running on toward a distant penciling of hills, the occasional
groves standing at anchor on this calm sea of space, the curl of
smoke rising from an isolated cabin, the ragged course of
brush-bordered creeks. Yonder, somewhere short of the hills, lay
the Willamette and the settlement of the French-Canadians.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>Chapter 29</h2>

<p>ON Christmas morning Martha Gay watched wave upon wave of
fine-spun mist move over the earth, dissolving timber and rolling
hills into unidentifiable shadows. There had been rain the night
before but this was not rain; this was water whipped finer than she
could have whipped egg-whites, layers of it settling lower and
lower, chunks of it adrift and curling visibly around the corners
of the lean-to barn. When it touched her face she felt it change
into a cool sweat; and every object in the yard was crystal-beaded
with it. Katherine and Gram stood by a big fire burning in the
yard, scarcely fifty feet from the cabin, yet so wrapped about by
the fog that they were indistinct to Martha in the cabin's doorway.
John Gay and Joe were in search of a strayed cow. The Old Man sat
by the fireplace, hands idle, mind idle. Martha stared at the fog,
at the crawling moisture which lay upon everything, at the churned
mud, and turned into the room without a word. When Katherine and
Gram came to the cabin they found her seated opposite the Old Man,
hands folded and expression despondent.</p>

<p>"Back home now, there'd be two feet of snow between house and
barn."</p>

<p>"Blessing it's not that way here," said Gram. "I ain't
sentimental about misery."</p>

<p>"But everybody'd be coming in. Even Alice, and she lived two
hundred miles off. It was always the one time of the year when I
could stand her husband. The house would just be wonderful
crowded."</p>

<p>"Work&mdash;work&mdash;work," said Gram. "I remember it
well."</p>

<p>"This miserable place," said Martha. "It ought to be full of
cookin' smells. It ought to be just suffocating strong with things
roasting and frying and bubbling. Well, it won't ever be the same
for us again. Last year this time I looked on a table with
twenty-five people, and we had twelve kinds of jam, and suet
pudding, and those two suckling pigs and eight ducks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ten," said Gram. "I picked the dratted things."</p>

<p>"We left a whole crock of mincemeat and right this minute I
suppose that new woman's making pies with it, and saying it's
<i>her</i> mincemeat. She didn't look like much of a cook to me. I
don't know why Gay wouldn't let me bring the rambler roses. I don't
know why we had to leave most everything that's been ours since we
been a family in America.</p>

<p>"I don't know why we came at all. We had all we wanted and we
didn't have to lower our heads to anybody. Why have we got to start
all over again? What's the good of it?" She was silent a moment,
working herself into a more rebellious mood. "I wonder if Tade's
alive. I wonder what kind of a baby Mary Lane got. I wonder&mdash;I
just sit and wonder and I can't get anything out of my mind."</p>

<p>"Well," said Gram, "we lived in that one place eighteen years
and I hated every minute of it."</p>

<p>Katherine said, "I didn't know that, Gram."</p>

<p>"I did. It wasn't my country to start with. I hated the heat and
the mosquitoes and the bareness. I never got accustomed to the
people. They had no fun in 'em like the people of my old home. I
saw one of my boys grow up and get drowned there. I watched another
get killed by a horse. That didn't make the country any dearer to
me."</p>

<p>"We shouldn't have moved," said Martha. "We had all we
wanted."</p>

<p>"Look at him," said Gram, and nodded toward the Old Man, who
seemed beyond hearing the things they said. "He worked too hard
there."</p>

<p>"<i>We're</i> working too hard here," said Martha.</p>

<p>"First year&mdash;first few years. But you won't have to fight
the land and the climate like you did there."</p>

<p>"I don't know why we came."</p>

<p>"Because your husband brought you," said Gram tartly. "How
long's this spell going to last?"</p>

<p>"You remember that jolly man in Oregon City? He said there
wasn't any mail service. If you want to send a letter you give it
to somebody who's going East, and maybe it's the long way around
the Horn. It's a year before the letter gets home, if it ever does.
It's a year waiting for an answer." Martha lifted her darker and
darker countenance to Gram and Katherine. "We'll never see them
again. We're dead and buried out here. We'll never see them till
we're in heaven." She turned her face away and sat stiff on the
chair and cried without a sound.</p>

<p>The Old Man lifted his glance from the floor, looked at her
incuriously and turned his eyes away. Katherine crossed the room to
stand behind her mother. She dropped her hands to her mother's
shoulders. "Wait till the sun comes out. You'll feel better."</p>

<p>"No," said Martha Gay, "I never will."</p>

<p>Gram Gay said: "It won't do for you to go around like that."</p>

<p>"I know," said Martha.</p>

<p>"Won't make it any better for John."</p>

<p>"There's something wrong with him, and he won't say what. What
would I do&mdash;what would I ever do if I lost him?" Martha
murmured.</p>

<p>Over Gram's face moved the fleeting shadow of her superstitious
other self. She reached down to lift and throw a clod of mud into
the fire. The expression passed. She said, "Don't bring things on
before their time. Now, if we're goin' to have Christmas supper in
this house it's high time the bread goes in the oven, and where's
that piece of meat?"</p>

<p>Martha said, "Don't ever tell him I said he looked sick. I don't
want him to know I know it."</p>

<p>Katherine returned to the bonfire in the yard and covered it
with wood. Over the fire hung the largest of iron kettles and in
the kettle lay the slow-melting chunks of fat from the half-dozen
bears John had shot during the previous month or two. After she got
the fire burning properly beneath the kettle Katherine moved to the
leach barrel which her father had built on a platform behind the
barn. Into the barrel went ashes from the cabin's hearth and from
the yard fire. Rain and an occasional dousing of bucket water
trickled through the ashes, came from a spigot hole low on the
barrel, and fell into a waiting keg. It was this filled keg of lye
water which Katherine carried to the fire, adding it to the melted
grease in the kettle; the two elements of soap now being combined,
she settled herself to a tedious waiting and skimming and stirring
while the mixture boiled itself to the proper consistency.</p>

<p>It was one of those jobs in which hands went one direction and
mind went another.</p>

<p>Heavy shoes and heavy coat gave her the false immigrant-girl air
Gram had noted; on her light hair the fog particles lodged and
built a kind of crystal lacework; fire and weather tinted her
complexion, and her general feeling of health laid its optimism
across her face and added to the blue eyes an alertness and an
expectancy. Far off in the fog she heard her father's voice calling
the strayed cow. The brindle cow&mdash;that was another
cow&mdash;was not more than two hundred yards beyond the barn, but
the fog had gradually thickened until the cow was a shadow that had
to be looked for. The oxen had not strayed far from the barn; one
of them, Dan, stood a few yards from Katherine with its dew-frosted
muzzle and watched the fire steadily. She could almost see thought
moving behind the animal's eyes. She stepped to the big beast and
rubbed the stony spot between the horns.</p>

<p>The timber at the meadow's edge had become a tall shadow, the
fences were gone, the wheat field lay foreshortened; and with the
fog had come too a soft, thick stillness and a world-slowed-down
feeling; in such quietness the talk of Gram and her mother in the
cabin sounded more than life-size.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful land. In the East at this season everything
would be odorless, growthless, life withdrawn to some
deep-protected cell for survival; and the ground would be ungiving.
But here the earth still contained a mucky ferment and there was
warmth enough in it to keep the meadow grasses emerald green. She
gave the kettle a good stirring and crossed the meadow to the brush
fire which her brother Joe had been tending until the strayed cow
drew him away. She piled on layers of new wet slash. Fresh flame
licked up and gray ashes rose, and the strong smell of green limbs
burning rolled against her. Beyond the meadow, somewhere along the
fog-hidden trail, she heard women's voices briskly break the
stillness. Visitors coming.</p>

<p>She returned to the kettle, gave it another stir, and went to
the cabin. "We should send Joe to the Kitchens with some
butter."</p>

<p>"I used to be sorry for them," said her mother, "but I despise
them now for letting poor Roxy go with that terrible man."</p>

<p>"I think Roxy decided that."</p>

<p>"She's not got mind enough to decide anything. It just makes me
shudder."</p>

<p>"I don't know..." said Katherine. "Maybe it pleases her to have
a husband when she never thought she'd get one."</p>

<p>"Well, she ran away from him."</p>

<p>"But she went back. I don't think it's for us to answer. How
would I feel if I knew I never was to have a husband, and then I
saw the chance?"</p>

<p>Martha Gay stopped her work long enough to place a well-known
glance upon her daughter. "Might be a good thing if you'd just give
that a thought&mdash;for yourself. I never expected to see the day
Roxy Kitchen got married before you did. And you could have been
married long ago. And I just can't understand why you make Harris
wait. I never will understand it."</p>

<p>Katherine smiled. "We should send the Kitchens the butter."</p>

<p>"Well, all right, but my heart's not with it. We ought to give
Mrs. Irish some, too."</p>

<p>"Not butter," said Katherine. "Rice gives them part of the milk
from his cows."</p>

<p>"And why's he so good to her?" challenged Martha Gay. "A widow
and a single man...I don't say anything's wrong. I just say pitch
and fire oughtn't be too close together. He's thirty. Why wasn't he
married before? How many women's he been mixed up in?"</p>

<p>"How do you know there's been any?" asked Katherine.</p>

<p>"At thirty? Well, if he's not been there's something wrong with
him. You know all about Harris. You grew up near him. You know just
what he is. You know he's good. He's thrifty. He works. He'll never
cause you trouble."</p>

<p>Gram turned from the fireplace. "And that's why she don't want
him."</p>

<p>"Don't make light of it," said Martha Gay. "When I think about
it I just can't sleep nights. What do you think the neighbors are
wondering about Katherine?"</p>

<p>"She's not getting married for the neighbors," said Gram.</p>

<p>Katherine said: "I've not seen that little brooch Uncle Ben sent
me from New Orleans."</p>

<p>"It's in the bottom of the green chest. Between the comforters.
Why?"</p>

<p>"I want to give it to Lucy Collingwood. It would look so well on
her. Ivory and gold, and delicate. It just matches her."</p>

<p>"Delicate&mdash;delicate. Not so delicate when Whitcomb's
around."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Pitch and fire&mdash;pitch and fire. And I will tell you
something else, too, since you think Rice Burnett's such a man.
Edna went up to his cabin. Helen Provost told me. It was the same
day he came by here with the pack outfit."</p>

<p>Gram said: "You're a nice woman for talk."</p>

<p>"Well, she did."</p>

<p>The Old Man turned his head. "Where'd the boys go?"</p>

<p>The three women halted their private conversation to look at
him. Katherine stepped behind him and laid a hand on the brown bare
top of his head. "To hunt for the cow that strayed."</p>

<p>"Why didn't they say so? I better go help."</p>

<p>"You stay there, Old Man," said Gram.</p>

<p>"Well, why didn't they tell me?"</p>

<p>Katherine returned to the kettle and began a steadier stirring
as the brew thickened. She had heard of Edna's visit to
Rice's&mdash;there were too many ready eyes and tongues in the
settlement for a thing like that to remain unnoticed. She put her
mind to it as she stirred, puzzled a little but not too much,
growing angry at Edna. Gram came from the cabin.</p>

<p>"Knew about Edna bein' there, didn't you?" commented Gram.</p>

<p>"Moss doesn't mean much to her, it's clear, or she wouldn't have
done it."</p>

<p>"No man means much to her, so long's it's a man."</p>

<p>"That's wrong. She wanted Rice. So it must have been Rice that
broke off."</p>

<p>"She's a miser for men. What she gets she won't let go. She's
chased all her life and she don't want to quit."</p>

<p>"But he's the one that broke it."</p>

<p>"It ain't broke. She'll hang on. She knows what she can do. She
knows she can shame him, too. She's got that string to pull. You
know why she's got it."</p>

<p>Katherine turned the stirring stick around and around into the
kettle; her face was thoughtful. "It would be hard for him to stay
back from her. Damn her, I'd like to drive her clear out of his
life, out of his mind. She's not made him happy."</p>

<p>"There's ways of doing it," said Gram. "But just thinkin' about
it ain't one of 'em."</p>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>Chapter 30</h2>

<p>JOHN GAY walked with his son through the dark aisles of timber,
calling for the cow. The drifting fog tangled itself in the matted
fir branches as ragged hanks of strange moss and the forest,
condensing this thin dew, manufactured its own private rain. Young
Joe's voice broke against the trees and seemed to become separate
voices sounding down one corridor and another. "Co' boss&mdash;co'
boss." They left the grove and crossed a meadow and circled another
grove, John Gay traveling slower and slower; they came to the lower
meadow of the Gay claim.</p>

<p>"I think," John Gay said, "we'll stop a moment," and settled on
a windfall. Young Joe waited, not quite understanding his father's
delay.</p>

<p>"Not feeling good?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It's maybe a cold," said John Gay. He breathed harder than he
liked, he was conscious of the unaccustomed tightness of his face.
He turned himself to let his right hand fall into his lap and he
began to massage it and got almost no sensation from it. Higher up,
somewhere around his shoulder, the steady ache had grown worse; no
matter how he carried his shoulders, the bound feeling remained
across his chest. He thought to himself: <i>Six weeks of it's not
accidental. It must be I've had a stroke without knowing it.</i>
Young Joe ranged the meadow, calling, and came back. "Don't see any
tracks here. She didn't get this far."</p>

<p>"She's sly," said Gay. "Probably not a hundred yards from the
house, playin' possum in a thicket. Cows take notions. Well, dark
will bring her home."</p>

<p>"You want to go back now?"</p>

<p>"We'll wait a moment," said John Gay. "Like this country,
Joe?"</p>

<p>"It's all right."</p>

<p>"If it were just me, I'd not come West. But this is a better
place for you. There's more chance. We only had a middling-fair
farm back East and land was getting too high for me to go buy a
better one for you. All that country's growing but it won't profit
the farmer so much as the speculator, the fellow starting towns,
the lawyer and the storekeeper. It's the speculator who pushed up
land prices and if I'd bought good farming land I'd had to go in
debt for it, and you'd spent half your life paying it off. If a bad
year came along you might have lost the farm. So we came here. The
land's cheap, there's plenty of it and there'll be no debt on it.
You have got to remember that in your lifetime you may see a dozen
years when hogs and cows and hay will sell at a good price. The
rest of the time prices will be low and you'll do well to break
even. So you can't farm on land that costs too much; and debt will
kill you. Don't ever buy anything you've not got money to pay for.
Don't mortgage this land. Don't buy any more land unless you see a
clear way to use it. Never buy land to speculate on and sell. No
man can be two things at the same time, and you can't be a farmer
and a speculator any more than you can be both black and white. God
made the land to use. He didn't mean for it to be passed back and
forth like a dollar piece from one fool to another."</p>

<p>His son nodded and looked beyond John Gay into the deepening
mist; his mind was half elsewhere, and Gay lowered his head a
little while and let the silence go on.</p>

<p>"You want to go back now?" asked young Joe.</p>

<p>"We'll do that in a moment. I'd like to tell you something to
keep fast. You hear talk about this free land. But it's nowise
free. Nothing's free. A lot of men, coming on this trip, lost
something out of their lives by the trip, and that's a costly
thing. We've got to do everything here, build everything, fence in,
plow, fire stumps, clear brush. We have got to travel forty miles
for everything that goes on this place&mdash;and that's time out of
your life. We have got to build roads and schools. We have got to
wait, we have got to do without till better times come. Someday
when you're plowin' I want you to stop and think that the plow
you're using came two thousand miles in a wagon and it took six
months of your life and mine to get it here. There's nothing free
and the fools that talk free are the men that don't know and won't
thrive and will end up busted." He had looked across the meadow
while he talked, but turned to catch his son's glance. He said,
"Remember it."</p>

<p>"All right..." said young Joe. "Maybe the cow went up the trail
toward Collingwood's."</p>

<p>"We'll go home now," said John Gay and rose from the log. He
laid a hand momentarily on his son's shoulder, let it drop and
walked across the meadow with his very slow, very careful pace.</p>

<p>Katherine used a paddle to transfer butter-soft soap into a keg.
She washed the kettle and laid it away, and cleaned her hands and
went into the wagon to change her clothes. She found the brooch in
the green box, intending to walk to Lucy Collingwood's with it; but
she returned to the cabin to spend a little time listening to the
talk which Mrs. Provost and Mrs. Buck brought down the trail with
them. Her mother had made tea and sat temporarily happy. The Old
Man was gone.</p>

<p>Her mother said: "I'd not be that outspoken if I were Nancy
Millard. It makes Millard no more pleased."</p>

<p>Mrs. Provost said: "Men ain't ever pleased to hear the truth
about themselves. They take great stock in their pride."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Walker, "I do admire Nancy's spunk for
spittin' out her mind. More than once, I've wished I could."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Martha Gay. "Seems to me men do <i>try</i>
to be reasonable."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Maude Provost. "They make such a great to-do
about reasoning things out, one side against the other, so much for
this, so much for that, the good of it, the bad of it. Lord,
sometimes I could just scream to hear Provost, for I know all the
time which way he'll decide. He'll decide it the way he wants. But
he's got to go all through the rigamarole. They love to be
reasonable all right but it always turns out their way."</p>

<p>"I don't know," murmured Martha. "Gay usually asks me what I
want to do."</p>

<p>"Well, he asks you but does he do it your way?"</p>

<p>"If it's best, he does."</p>

<p>"There you are," said Mrs. Provost. "If you side in with him,
you get your way. But if you don't there's a long argument why your
way ain't wise, and on and on through the whole rigamarole again
till you just get weary and tell him of course he knows best. How
many times have I said that! Sometimes I'm so mad I could cry.
Sometimes it's so funny it's all I can do not to laugh. You'd think
men would catch on to that but they don't."</p>

<p>"They're thick-hided, that's for sure," said Mrs. Buck.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they're so thick?" said Mrs. Provost. "Sometimes
when Provost looks at me so innocent, I think, 'You rascal, you
being sly with me?' They can be awful sly."</p>

<p>"Ever tell him that?" asked Mrs. Buck.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Then he might be slyer still. I'd rather know what he
was doing, and not tell him, than not know what he was doing."</p>

<p>The remark delighted Mrs. Buck. "That's it. We just play a game
but the men, they don't know it. It's bad to laugh at a man. I did
it once and Harper like to never got over it. How can they be so
thick and still so sensitive? They're funny."</p>

<p>Martha Gay shook her head. "Pride means a lot to them."</p>

<p>"Means a lot to me, too," said Mrs. Provost, "but I've swallowed
it plenty of times. Whenever did that start, I wonder&mdash;that
it's woman that's got to bend and let a man keep his pride?"</p>

<p>"Men started it, where else?" said Mrs. Buck cheerfully.</p>

<p>"It was the men that got us out here," said Mrs. Provost. "Who
would have come if women had had any choice in the matter?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Martha Gay. "I'd despise a man who let me
run him. There's such a thing as bein' so considerate that the wife
don't respect him. It's almost that way with Millard. Poor man gets
trouble from her, and trouble from all the other men because he
don't make her mind."</p>

<p>"They do hate her," said Mrs. Provost. "Because they're afraid
she'll show us how to be independent, and that would be the end of
their lord-and-master business."</p>

<p>"Lord-and-master," said Mrs. Buck and dropped both palms on her
lap and bent forward to laugh. "Until they get sick. Then they act
like roosters swashed around a rain barrel. Such moaning and
groaning and complaining! You'd think they were about to die."</p>

<p>"Sick or well," said Mrs. Provost, "they always got to be the
center of things, they always got to be important."</p>

<p>"Not all men," said Martha Gay. She thought of Gay, and grew
still.</p>

<p>"Never saw one different," said Mrs. Provost. Then she looked
toward Katherine and brought on a brisk smile. "You must think
marriage is a poor thing, listening to us."</p>

<p>"I wonder if men talk about their wives this way?" said
Katherine.</p>

<p>Mrs. Provost said: "If I ever heard of Provost doing it I'd kill
him."</p>

<p>"You'd never know if he did," said Mrs. Buck. "Men don't tell
things about other men."</p>

<p>"And I wonder," said Katherine, "if it's such a trial, why
married women always try to marry off single girls."</p>

<p>The other women were silent a little while. Mrs. Buck, who had
contributed her share of this talk in good humor, made a smiling
gesture of resignation; but Mrs. Provost found humility hard to
come by. "What else could you do? God made us the way we
are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he was a man," said Mrs. Buck.</p>

<p>"There you are," said Mrs. Provost. "It's a trap that's got no
way out. If only men didn't think they were such superior
creatures! That's always the thing. You wait and see,
Katherine."</p>

<p>Voices came through the fog and the brisk tingle of a harness
bell announced a pack outfit. Turning through the doorway&mdash;the
other women with her&mdash;Katherine found her father and young Joe
walking into view with Rice Burnett. Behind them plodded Rice's
pack animals, each one broad-loaded; even Rice's horse had
half-filled sacks swinging from its saddle thongs.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas," said Rice, and halted his string in the
yard.</p>

<p>"What on earth have you got there?" demanded Mrs. Gay. "Do I
hear geese? Where've you been?"</p>

<p>"The French-Canadian settlements," said Rice. "It'd do you good
to look into their barns. Damned near made me cry&mdash;poor man
looking at plenty."</p>

<p>Everybody went along the line of horses, Mrs. Provost patting
the crates and sacks and bundles as though they were animals, Mrs.
Gay issuing small sounds of pleasure for the things she saw. One
pack animal carried three slatted crates tight-packed with geese;
another had crates of chickens. There were big willow baskets from
which wheat dripped, and sacks of onions, and squash and pumpkin
and potatoes, and other baskets of shelled corn. Katherine placed
her nose against a sack and caught the odor of apples. From every
peg and rope-end of the pack outfit something hung, a few strings
of peppers, a cheese in a calico bag, small hams, smoked fish
wrapped about by a coarse cloth. Mrs. Gay never got farther than
the geese; she put her fingers between the slats, murmuring,
"Beasties, beasties, you wonderful beasties!"</p>

<p>Gay said: "All you need is some tinware and calico to have a
travelin' store."</p>

<p>Burnett for a moment watched Martha Gay's complete preoccupation
with the geese, then he walked over to her and ripped open a slat
from one of the crates. "It's like Noah's Ark. Here's your start of
geese&mdash;two geese, one gander. Same of chickens&mdash;one
speckled rooster, three hens. Ought to get a setting of eggs out of
that many hens in four or five days."</p>

<p>"Gay&mdash;Joe!" said Mrs. Gay. "Come here, help. Put 'em in the
cabin and shut the door till we get something provided." She took
the big goose in her hands and hugged it, and she went toward the
cabin, murmuring, "You beautiful, beautiful beastie."</p>

<p>"Bring some buckets and pans," said Burnett. He went along the
line of packs, loosening ropes; he took off half a sack of
potatoes, he measured out some of the corn, some of the
vegetables.</p>

<p>Katherine said: "What will you do?"</p>

<p>"Spread it around the neighbors."</p>

<p>"Then that's enough for us."</p>

<p>He left one of the hams and he had Martha Gay lift her apron and
he put into it an apple apiece for each of the family, and he found
another sack and added a few hands of nuts they knew nothing about.
"Hazelnuts&mdash;wild." From still another sack he took a small
covered crock from which honey oozed. Then he went down the line of
horses, tightening the pack ropes. He said to Mrs. Provost and Mrs.
Buck: "I'll stop by your cabins and leave a little of this. It
spreads sort of thin but it'll make a taste."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Katherine. She went into the house, got
her coat and came out. "I'm going along. I've got to see this."</p>

<p>"Rice," said Martha Gay and called him about as he started away.
She came to him and looked up at his face a moment, and she turned
to her husband and said, "Now don't you mind," and swung back to
kiss Burnett. She started away but Burnett, smiling, reached out to
seize her around the waist.</p>

<p>"Been a long time waiting," he said and returned the kiss. When
he let her go she said, half embarrassed, "You needn't be so rough
with an old woman," and she stared at her husband and seemed to be
displeased by his sudden let-go of laughter.</p>

<p>The pack outfit went on. They stopped at the Collingwoods', and
Kerns'. Katherine noticed that Rice then left more with Mrs. Irish
than at the previous places; that he left nothing but a token at
the Rinearsons'&mdash;a small cheese; that he was almost as
generous with the Kitchens as with Mrs. Irish. He detoured by the
Purroys', Walkers', Crabtrees' and by McIver's, he stopped at the
Mercers' and moved up to the Millards'; he returned across the ford
to climb the notch to the Lords'&mdash;leaving a jug of honey
there; he went roundabout to the Monteiths' and made his final stop
at the Lattimores'. By the time they reached his cabin the cargo
had shrunk to a ham, a few potatoes and onions, and a little
cheese; he had saved a rooster and two chickens; and when they
entered the cabin he laid a bottle of wine on the table.</p>

<p>"Your people drink at all?" he asked Katherine.</p>

<p>"Mother made Father take the pledge when they were married. Come
back to our place for supper?"</p>

<p>It was five o'clock and half dark. He made a short fire to take
the chill from the room and went out to unsaddle his pack string.
His two cows had come down the meadow and waited with their noses
at the fence. Katherine let them into the yard and got a pail and
did the milking. She strained the milk and poured some of it into
the skim pans in the lean-to; she mixed milk and wheat for the
setting hen and went into the cabin while Rice put together a
shelter for the chickens.</p>

<p>As she waited she took in the bachelor's arrangement of the
room, and she looked at the bunk and she thought: <i>She's been in
it with him;</i> and she thought of that affair very closely. What
had it been like, and what had he gotten from Edna, and who had
ended it, and what did he think about her now? Something must be
left. How could anything like that end with nothing?</p>

<p>He washed himself, making a big noise of it, and came in to
stand by the fire. He was in the best of spirits, he was
lighthearted, he seemed to be thinking of something along the route
which pleased him, or touched his humor.</p>

<p>"None of that was free," she said.</p>

<p>"Those French-Canadians have got stuff to burn."</p>

<p>"But it cost you something."</p>

<p>"It's Christmas. We've had a hard year. We're pretty sober. I
don't know why we have to be so sober."</p>

<p>"When did you think of the idea?"</p>

<p>"At Millard's the other night."</p>

<p>"At every cabin it was a little different," she reflected.
"Billy Lord's place was the nicest of all. You almost made Billy
cry...Open the wine."</p>

<p>He looked at her with his approval. "That's a fine idea." He
used his pocketknife to dig out the bottle's cork; he half-filled a
pair of tin cups, he touched his cup to her cup. "To what?"</p>

<p>"To everybody in the settlement."</p>

<p>"Down she goes," he said.</p>

<p>"No, sip a little at a time."</p>

<p>"I don't much like to nibble at things. I like the whole thing
at one wallop."</p>

<p>"Then what's left?"</p>

<p>He took his sip; he watched her taste the drink and like it. "We
can fill the cup again."</p>

<p>"When the bottle's gone&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Another bottle."</p>

<p>Her mouth moved along the cup's rim; her glance came over the
rim. "This is good. I can see why people get the habit." She let
the cup drop a little; the next question was soft. "What do you do
with your empty bottles?"</p>

<p>He said carefully, "I never throw away the kind of a bottle
you're talking about. I never emptied that kind of a bottle. That
kind of a bottle can't be emptied. The more you drink of it, the
fuller it gets. If it begins to empty on you, then it's not the
drink you thought it was. Am I talking straight?"</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," she said; and then they were laughing at
each other.</p>

<p>"Want some more in that cup?"</p>

<p>"Don't know what I'd do if I had another drink."</p>

<p>"Want to find out?"</p>

<p>She looked at him, still smiling. "Is this how it goes? I mean,
a man and a woman&mdash;is this one of the ways?"</p>

<p>"I'll ask somebody that knows and tell you what he says."</p>

<p>She fell into serious thought. "I wonder if that was why my
mother had Father take the pledge&mdash;if she saw something in him
she was afraid of? It's hard to think of him as having been young
and wild. Young people never know their parents. Once I tried to
imagine my father kissing another woman. It shocked me. The younger
we are, the more we think that excitement is all in <i>us.</i> They
know we think it, and they know we'd be displeased to see it in
them. My father and mother rarely kiss each other in front of me or
Joe. But they're not so old. Where does it go, Rice? Does it really
go&mdash;for all of us?"</p>

<p>She put her tin cup on the table and turned to spread her hands
at the fire; and the fire captured her attention, as it always did,
and the shadow and shift of her thoughts got stronger. "No, I don't
believe it."</p>

<p>"There wasn't a hell of a lot of smiling going on today at any
cabin we went to."</p>

<p>"Everybody is tired."</p>

<p>"Why don't they see it a little clearer&mdash;like Billy Lord
sees it? When we grow old enough to know anything we know the
game's got an end and the end's rigged against us. So we get
solemn, we get into arguments, we fix up a lot of rules to make the
game worse."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want&mdash;how do you want it?"</p>

<p>"Tune up the guitar, and play it away."</p>

<p>"You're just talking. No more to drink for us. Remember we've
got to go home for supper."</p>

<p>"I thought I had the answer&mdash;roving around the country for
ten years or better. But it wasn't. Being a shadow's no good. Now
I'm piling up some logs and some stones in this spot so I won't be
a shadow but they'll fall down someday and I'll still be a
shadow."</p>

<p>"Your sons will be here."</p>

<p>He looked through the door and saw the solid blackness move in.
He stepped to the table and got the bottle and put it under his
bunk. "I trust people, but not this far. Ready?"</p>

<p>She held her glance on him; her expression quickened when he
came to her and turned her. She made no protest.</p>

<p>"This is my mistake," she said. "I ought to have Mrs. Provost or
Mrs. Walker around. That's what they were doing when you came
by&mdash;telling me about men."</p>

<p>He dropped his hand from her shoulder and got her coat and held
it for her. Laughter was sharp-creased around her eyes. She said:
"I didn't think you'd be scared away."</p>

<p>"You can scare me awful easy," he said. "Because I don't want to
be wrong with you."</p>

<p>"Would you like it now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She smiled and shook her head as she put her arms around him. "I
never thought it would be this way." She closed her eyes and the
smile stopped.</p>

<p>Her mouth came to him, confident as Edna's but reserved as
Edna's had never been. Half of her came through, half of her held
off&mdash;and he checked himself and put no force on her. She
stayed with him longer than he expected and when she drew away she
was, in some fashion, still with him. She was smiling again. He
tightened his arms on her and she touched the top of her head
against his chest, whispering, "That was nice," and stepped into
the yard. She was cooler than he was, for the kiss went knocking
through him and made him absent-minded for a moment.</p>

<p>He closed the door and looked at the shadowed outside wall where
he had stuck the Indian's knife, and saw that it was gone. He got a
bucket of milk from the lean-to and came back to give Katherine a
hand up to his saddle; she sat sidewise on it, following him
through the dense ground shadows and into the trees.</p>

<p>"I expected it to be different," she said. "What held you
back?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You're not sure about it."</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"Talk&mdash;just talk," she said and avoided an answer. He left
half the milk at the Lattimores' and the rest with Mrs. Irish. When
they moved into the timber again Katherine said, "Give me a
hand&mdash;it's too lonesome back here," and got off the horse and
walked arm in arm with him the rest of the way.</p>

<p>Supper was ready. Martha Gay, whose anxiety was sometimes
stronger than her fortitude, said, "I'd begun to worry&mdash;you're
late. Sit on the milk stool, Rice." Gram went around the table to
see that everything was on, and then stepped to the yard. In the
shadows she looked back through the doorway at Katherine and
Rice.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>Chapter 31</h2>

<p>THE neighbors had come again. They sat close-crowded along the
walls of the cabin, on the bunks, on the floor. Firelight stained
them with its dull red, the leaping of the flame was bright in
their eyes. The Old Man crouched in his corner, nodding at what he
heard but only half understood.</p>

<p>Burnett watched Katherine's hands stir on her lap, come together
and grow still. Her head rolled back against the cabin wall; she
watched the ceiling and lightness made a visible wave over her
face, eyes changing, lips changing. He had his back against the
logs and thought he felt vibration. Turning his head, he flattened
his ear to the log and picked up the thready rumor of a traveler in
the night.</p>

<p>Gay watched him. "Something out there?"</p>

<p>"Horse."</p>

<p>There was a rider in the yard, hailing, "Hello there!"</p>

<p>The barrel-round voice created the image of a big man; and it
turned out to be a big man when he stepped into the doorway&mdash;a
spectacular man in greasy, blackened buckskins so shrunk by wetting
and drying that they fitted like tights at buttocks and calves. He
wore moccasins and a round trapper's hat, and a beard covered most
of his face and fell over his collar button in iron-gray
magnificence. His mouth was largely lost behind the whiskers but
his nose stood out in Roman style and his eyes were lively and
black and cheerful. He was around fifty, Burnett decided, and he
seemed familiar though Burnett couldn't place him.</p>

<p>Nobody in the crowd knew him but the stranger attended to that
immediately.</p>

<p>"Meek, Joe Meek, neighbors. I'm your U. S. Marshal, and I
thought it time to come out and mend my fences. Think I met some of
you when you passed through Oregon City. This man I
know"&mdash;nodding at Gay. He edged and squeezed and sidled
himself through the crowded room, identifying people, shaking
hands. He stopped before the fireplace and turned his back to it
and lifted the skirts of his hunting shirt to warm the bottom of
his breeches. "Snug as a bear's den&mdash;and that's snug, for I've
slept in some."</p>

<p>"I'll make coffee," said Martha Gay, rising.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;had some back a few miles."</p>

<p>Gay said: "If you've got a family why ought you travel on a day
like this?"</p>

<p>"This country's got more corners to it than an old maid," said
Meek. "She goes from there to there, and she goes off there, and
crosses the river and goes off there." With each "there" his lifted
hand made a poking gesture in a different direction. "Keeps me
humping to cover it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Gay, "I don't think I'd travel on Christmas Day to
shake the hands of the President, Pope or presiding elder."</p>

<p>"Depends on the requirements of your soul, I do suppose," said
Meek..."Looks fine down here. You people have dug in quick. You
ain't quite got the Oregon mildewed look yet. Another winter and
you'll have moss on the north side, and then you belong, and you
won't talk about going back. Who's beyond the creek?"</p>

<p>Collingwood began to tell him, anxious to strike up a
conversation. Meanwhile Gay let his attention quietly move to
Burnett, and something like doubt came out of him.</p>

<p>Meek's Christmas Day traveling seemed to stick in Gay's throat.
Burnett closed his eyes a moment, listening to the rumble of the
marshal's voice; he opened his eyes and watched the marshal's
glance make its short darts about the room as he listened to
Collingwood. Gay was right; the marshal wanted something.</p>

<p>"Who'd you say?" asked the marshal.</p>

<p>"Beyond this valley? Daniel Rinearson."</p>

<p>"Didn't I meet him in Oregon City? Had sons?"</p>

<p>"Three sons."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;sure..." said the marshal. "Well, you certain got
good country to settle in..." He thrust his hands into his pockets
and rocked a little on his heels; the heat sent him slightly
farther from the fire, and his upper cheeks grew redder. Casually
he drew one hand from the pocket, bringing with it a round stamped
silver medallion with a pair of buckskin thongs extending from
it&mdash;a saddle ornament fallen from somebody's outfit.</p>

<p>"Anybody lose this? I found it on the trail."</p>

<p>"Where on the trail?" asked Gay in a voice which had grown
dryer</p>

<p>"Few miles back."</p>

<p>Provost caught it then, for his chin lifted slightly and he set
his eyes on the marshal. John Gay raised his good hand, passing it
back and forth across his chin. His face took on a speculative,
horse-trading expression.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Collingwood bent forward to have a clearer look at the
ornament. "Not many of us have got fancied-up saddles. I only
recall&mdash;"</p>

<p>Burnett cut him off with a question for the marshal. "If you
were a few miles back on the trail, wouldn't it have been
dark?"</p>

<p>That was when it came to McIver. So far not much interested in
the talk, he now straightened his shoulders and seemed to see the
marshal as a new man. He passed a glance to Mercer. Mrs. Buck bent
toward Buck, whispering, and Buck turned a little on his chair and
placed both broad palms on his knees to stare at the floor. Lucy
Collingwood's hand dropped on her husband's hand; he looked about
with a small rise of interest. He was the last one in the room to
sense it.</p>

<p>"Well," said the marshal, "it was just getting dark. Thing had a
shine to it or I wouldn't of seen it." His quick eyes went from
person to person; he caught the quality of the silence, he caught
the withdrawing; his question went light and quick at Collingwood.
"You say you know who this belongs to?"</p>

<p>Collingwood said, "I couldn't be sure."</p>

<p>"It's no matter," said the marshal carelessly, and thrust the
ornament into his pocket.</p>

<p>Gay straightened and laid his lame arm in a more comfortable
position. "Any news from anywhere?"</p>

<p>"She rocks along&mdash;she just rocks along."</p>

<p>Gay said: "That won't do. I am thoroughly able to see through a
picket fence."</p>

<p>The marshal let go with his strong laugh, and slyness sprang
over the visible part of his face. "So you can, neighbor, so you
can. Well, the messenger between Oregon City and Fort Vancouver was
robbed and killed last night."</p>

<p>"That's where you got the ornament&mdash;and you want the man
who owns it."</p>

<p>Burnett rose and edged the marshal away from the fire. He used
his boot to roll the logs together. "This thing needs some help,"
he said and went to the door. He looked at young Joe wedged in the
corner. "Where's the woodpile?" he asked, and set his eyes on the
boy before he stepped into the darkness. Young Joe followed
him.</p>

<p>Burnett drew him deeper into the night. "Take my
horse&mdash;walk it easy out of the yard&mdash;get on&mdash;go to
Rinearson's and say the marshal's here with one of Whit's saddle
fooforaws in his pocket." He watched young Joe fade; he circled the
cabin and got a chunk of fir and carried it into the cabin.</p>

<p>"Two men?" Gay was saying.</p>

<p>"Two men," said the marshal. "We don't know nothing about one of
'em. We know something about the other, though."</p>

<p>There was half a suspicion in the marshal's head and he looked
to the doorway and was about to say something when John Gay
diverted his attention. "They make any money of it?"</p>

<p>"I expect there was five hundred dollars, and that's a hell of a
lot of money for Oregon. Any of you men get that much money
together the next two-three years in Oregon, and you can say it's
an accident. When I came here wheat was money and furs was
money&mdash;and a day's work got you credit at old John
McLoughlin's fort, but no cash. Ain't so bad now but she's tight,
boys, she's tight." He looked again at the doorway and his question
came in at the tail end of his other talk, without a break.
"Where's that boy?"</p>

<p>"Sleeps in the wagon," said John Gay. "Might be there."</p>

<p>The marshal drew a breath, unlaced his hands from behind his
back and gave his buttocks a sharp slap. He wasn't angry. He moved
his glance around and laid a civil, wicked set of eyes on Burnett.
"Did me, didn't you? Halfway to Rinearson's, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"Set your trap on the wrong slide."</p>

<p>"I thought you wasn't altogether a farmer," said the marshal.
His short, strong laugh came out again and for an instant white
teeth and red tongue showed in the aperture of his whiskers. "But
if I get there, and he's run, then I'll know I'm on the tail of the
right man, won't I?"</p>

<p>"You want to find him, or you want him out of the road so it
won't be bothersome to you?"</p>

<p>There was at once a rough deviltry in the marshal's side-rolled
glance. He laughed again, but it was the laugh of an unamused man.
"Next time you go to Oregon City ask if Meek's for fun or
fightin'." He looked at Gay. "No hard feelin's, neighbor, but it's
got to be done."</p>

<p>"Then do it and ask nothing from us," said Gay.</p>

<p>"Why," said the marshal, "I tree my coons alone and always
expect to." But he wasn't quite through with Burnett and at the
door he turned and left his last pleasure with Burnett. "It's my
authority to deputize help; and if I got to chase this man to hell
and gone, I might swear you in and wear your legs right down to the
knee joints chasin' him with me."</p>

<p>"Were I you I don't believe I'd do it, though," said
Burnett.</p>

<p>The marshal said most gently, "You tell <i>me</i> what I
oughtn't do?" The deviltry grew brighter and paler in his restless
eyes.</p>

<p>"How many coons you want to hunt at one time?"</p>

<p>The marshal studied him and his teeth showed again and small
half-explosions of laughter rumbled around his chest and throat. He
was interested, he was tempted; that bull boldness was about him.
Then he changed his mind and said, "Good night, neighbors," and
passed into the night.</p>

<p>Martha Gay could no longer keep her anxious question back.
"Who?"</p>

<p>"Whit's saddle ornament, of course," said Gay, and added: "The
wild, ignorant damn-fool kid!" He looked at Burnett. "You sent Joe
up there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, that's good. Whit'll probably slide into the hills."</p>

<p>"That's where the marshal wants him," said Burnett. "Easier to
track a man in the brush than to walk up to a front door for
him."</p>

<p>"Lockyear's the other one," said Provost.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Gay. "But he was too smart to be caught. It
was Whit who had to get himself caught. The fool kid, traveling
around with a bad man so he can make out he's a bad man himself."
He shook his head, he was both bitter and sad. "There's grief for
the Rinearsons. Those three boys are Old Daniel's life. Whit might
as well have shoved a butcher knife right through Daniel." It
seemed to come closer and closer to him. "I can't abide murder, but
as to that, who knows whether it was Whit or Lockyear that killed
the fellow? Well, it makes no difference, there's that
murder&mdash;and there's one more evil against Cal Lockyear. My
God, the man ruins anything he touches, his hands are bloody red to
the shoulders, his mind's squirmin' with the maggots of
destruction, the inside of him is black&mdash;black. Tell me what
good he is on earth? If there's a place for him, then I have got to
doubt creation." He was pale and beyond his own strength. Tissue
and features lay tighter against the bones of his face, the eye
sockets seemed rounder, the lips were shrunk, the outline of the
skull itself grew prominent before Burnett. Disease, so long
working its secret way in this man, made its first visible
break-through. The Gay women watched him, Gram with her crone's
attention, Martha Gay close to crying; and to Katherine came the
familiar closing down of expression, the discipline, the bracing
against disaster.</p>

<p>"Well," said Buck, "I expect the Lord will take care of him; but
if we got to wait too long for that, maybe patience will run out
and we'll do it ourselves."</p>

<p>McIver said: "That marshal get paid?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Gay.</p>

<p>"One more man at the public tit," said McIver, "growin' fat
doin' nothin'. I've got no use for government. Nothin' comes from
it but the excuse of them that work for it for more
government."</p>

<p>"We got to have some government," said Gay.</p>

<p>"Better none than too much. It is a corrupter, a seducer; it
panders to the weak and selfish. It feeds us sugar till we like
sugar too much, and then it has got us, because we need the sugar
more than we need self-respect."</p>

<p>"That's a strong view," said Gay.</p>

<p>"I fear government more than I fear hell, starvation, anarchy or
the devil. I fear it because I fear the instinct in all men to want
things for nothing. I never heard of a government that stayed
small. They all get big and suck the sap out of the people they
serve, and finally kill people, and kill themselves."</p>

<p>From the trees, from the southward darkness, came a long-ringing
shout with a note of emergency which tumbled these men at once into
the yard. A pair of feet pounded the earth at a labored gait, a
shadow grew, Harris Eby stumbled into the yellow arc of the cabin
light. Branches and briars had skinned him, his hands were
bleeding, he sucked the insufficient air into his deep lungs with
an effort painful to hear; he had extended himself almost too far.
Burnett caught him by the arm but the big man's momentum carried
him to the cabin wall and he laid head and shoulder against it and
braced his feet to keep himself erect. Martha Gay cried,
"Harris&mdash;Harris&mdash;is it Indians?" His head rolled from
side to side. Nobody else said anything. Burnett stepped to the
bucket and got a dipper of water; he poured the water on Eby's
head. He filled the dipper again; he pulled back the collar of
Eby's coat and dashed the water down Eby's neck.</p>

<p>Eby said, "Accident," and waited for more wind. "Go get
Whitcomb." He turned around to brace his shoulders on the logs.
Burnett brought him the filled dipper. Eby took the water between
gusts of wind; he let the dipper drop. "George Millard. We were
hunting. I packed him a ways but thought I better let him lie and
come get help. I tied a piece of shirt around his leg. He shot
himself below the knee."</p>

<p>"I'll take your gray gelding, John," said Burnett. "Where's the
saddle?"</p>

<p>"In the shed."</p>

<p>Buck said: "Where's Millard?"</p>

<p>"Two miles up that hill," said Eby. "I'll go back and show
you."</p>

<p>Burnett moved on to the shed, found Gay's saddle gear and
crossed the yard to the meadow fence. Katherine had gone before him
with an empty bucket. She banged the bucket against the fence,
bringing the gray mare in from its distant foraging. Burnett
saddled the horse and brought it back to the cabin light. The group
had talked it out.</p>

<p>"My horse is faster than this one," said McIver to Burnett. "You
take it. This is the nearest house. We'll bring Millard here. You
bring Doc Whitcomb here. How long you think it'll be? It's forty
miles to Oregon City&mdash;that's eighty for the trip."</p>

<p>Burnett thought about it. "Night all the way. Ten hours, maybe a
little better. Five hours coming back."</p>

<p>"Never mind the horse," said McIver. "Break it down if you got
to."</p>

<p>"I'll pick up another horse along the way&mdash;maybe a couple
of changes. Should be back tomorrow afternoon." He was in the
saddle, listening to the talk going back and forth. Buck said: "No
trails where Geroge is. Easier to walk than ride."</p>

<p>"We'll catch up a couple blankets."</p>

<p>"Give Harris a horse. He's done up. We'll <i>need</i> a
lantern."</p>

<p>"Somebody's got to go tell Mrs. Millard and fetch her here."</p>

<p>"I'll do that," said Lord.</p>

<p>"No," said Katherine, "I'll do that." She came to Burnett and
said, "Take care," and touched his hand, and stepped away. He
turned the gray over the yard and set it into an easy run across
the meadow.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>Chapter 32</h2>

<p>HE swung north through Billy Lord's notch and came upon country
he hadn't seen since arrival. The sky was clear and full of stars
from horizon to horizon. A black sky was always flat but a starred
sky fitted down upon the earth with a bowl's curve. There was the
thinnest scratch of a moon but neither it nor the stars shed much
light; the rolling hills made their silhouettes around him, the
meadows sent out a faint glow, the timbered stretches were
tunnel-dark. The trail had not been used enough to be potty, but
neither could he depend on it being free from deadfalls. Had he
been on his own business he would have kept the horse largely at a
walk, but in present necessity he pushed it to a run over the
meadows&mdash;trusting to the beast's sense of danger rather than
his own&mdash;and dropped to a walk in the trees. From Lord's to
the crossing of the nearest creek was a matter of six miles and in
this distance he passed three cabins whose lights still shone. The
sound of his horse brought people to the doors and he heard them
hail after he had gone by, their voices round-shaped in the
pressing night. Beyond the creek there was but one light for
several miles, this to his left in the lower level of a prairie; it
stood alone in the sea of darkness, winking as a star would wink,
and for half an hour it stayed with him until the trail left the
edge of the prairie and moved into a hilly country all through
which the coyotes were crying.</p>

<p>At the first river he spent half an hour in the search of a
crossing. Beyond, the trail broke into several little fingers which
confused him and he found himself sitting on a stopped horse in the
middle of a thicket which apparently had no exit. He beat his way
back to the river, cruising its banks and looking for light spots
against the forest black. He made several tries before he came into
a small valley, and he halted there with nothing to go by but the
stars and his sense of where Oregon City ought to be. He crossed
the open space and reached the edge of timber and drifted along its
edge until he found a break-through where the horse seemed willing
to go. He reached the summit of a low ridge and saw nothing before
him but the dim bulk of more timber and hills; he backtracked to
the short valley, swung along it more directly westward and
followed it, once more reaching timber; but this was a thin stand
and when he got through it he found himself in what appeared to be
a round meadow. Directly before him was a house, all dark; a dog
crouched somewhere and set up a furious barking.</p>

<p>"Hello in there."</p>

<p>Something squealed, something scraped, and a woman's voice
murmured. "Take care." The door opened and a man's voice came at
Burnett. "Who's that?"</p>

<p>"I'm on my way to Oregon City for a doctor and I need a fresh
horse. Think I've lost the trail."</p>

<p>"No, you're on it," said the man. "Do I know you?"</p>

<p>"Rice Burnett."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be dod-blasted," said the man. "Etty, light the
light. Get down, Rice. Etty, make coffee."</p>

<p>"No," said Burnett. "No time."</p>

<p>The woman was up in the room; a light flared and its yellowness
sprang through the door, outlining Alpheus Stricklin.</p>

<p>"Who's hurt?"</p>

<p>"Millard shot himself in the leg."</p>

<p>"I'll get my horse," said Alpheus. He went into the cabin a
moment, later appearing in shoes, flannel nightgown and a knit cap;
he retreated behind the cabin while Burnett removed the gear from
Mdver's horse. Stricklin's wife came to the doorway, wrapped around
by a quilt; her hair hung beside a broad, plain, dark face. "Is it
bad? Poor Miz Millard!"</p>

<p>"I don't know. How've you been, Etty?"</p>

<p>"Fine&mdash;fine," said the woman. "We don't <i>see</i> nobody.
I wish Stricklin had settled closer to folks. Nobody nearer than
the Pettys and they're four miles. How's Martha Gay? How's
everybody? Anything new happened?"</p>

<p>"She's fine. We're set in for the winter, working hard. Gay's
not too well. Lockyear married Roxy Kitchen."</p>

<p>"No!" said Mrs. Stricklin. "Such a thing...It ain't to be
believed!" She was silent a moment, struggling with her curiosity.
Then she said: "You and that Edna girl married yet?"</p>

<p>"Wrong man, Etty. She took Moss Rinearson."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mrs. Stricklin, a long breath falling from her. "Mrs.
Irish makin' out?"</p>

<p>"She will."</p>

<p>"And how does it go with Buck and Miz Howard? And, oh yes, that
poor little Lavinia and her man?"</p>

<p>"They're eating. That's all you can say for anybody." Stricklin
returned with his horse and stood by while Burnett laid on the
saddle and buckled the halter.</p>

<p>"I'm so hungry for talk," said Mrs. Stricklin. "I could sit and
sit and pump and pump."</p>

<p>"Come down and make a visit," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's so far, so terrible far. Everything's so terrible far.
Stricklin says there'll be a good road by here someday with people
goin' back and forth plenty but I don't believe it. We're just all
sort of lost out here. Don't expect I'll ever see a town again.
Everything's so terrible far."</p>

<p>Stricklin said, "Go straight west for maybe an hour. Then you'll
be on the edge of prairie. When you cross the river go downstream a
mile or so, and you'll come to a big clearing&mdash;old Indian
campground. Then you strike north and the trail gets plain."</p>

<p>"I'll change horses coming back. Have you got another Whitcomb
can use?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"So long," said Burnett and left them. The trail was moderately
straight and he followed it from meadow to grove, over brushy
little creeks and past alder thickets and cedar marshes and at last
came upon a river which, nearing a junction with the Willamette,
was broad but shallowed by gravel bars. He made the crossing, he
found the Indian camp spot. The country cleared and cabins began to
emerge more frequently from the shadows; in the first paling of
dawn he saw the glint of the Willamette to his left and for a short
time followed its silver windings. At full daylight he was once
more in the timber. When he passed through this he began to hear
the undertone of the falls in the still morning, and at last came
upon the shock and glitter of the river tearing itself apart on the
rocks. Passing along the base of a black bluff, he entered town,
asked Whitcomb's whereabouts from the first citizen he saw, and so
arrived at a small white house back of Main Street. Whitcomb
answered his knock, looked at him, and said: "Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Millard shot himself in the leg."</p>

<p>"Come in," said Whitcomb. "There's breakfast on the table.
Finish it out while I round up my horse."</p>

<p>"Get another for me."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
They were out of town, bound south, in half an hour. "You might as
well have stayed back and slept," said Whitcomb.</p>

<p>"Rather return with you."</p>

<p>"I know," said Whitcomb. "Emergency, somebody dying...It hits
people that way. They'll do anything when somebody's in trouble and
needs quick help. Turn themselves inside out, ride, give,
nurse&mdash;anything necessary." He went on a long distance but
still had the thing in his mind; for beyond the falls he had
something else to say. "How kind we can be at such times! How
brutal we can be, not meaning it, when there's no crisis, only
average trouble and disagreement. You know what Christmas really
is? It's crowding into one week the things we ought to have done
all year long. If we minded the decencies, just the ordinary
decencies, there never be any need or reason for Christmas. And we
know it, too. How damned well we know it. How bad is Millard's
leg?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. The shot was below the knee. Eby said he tied
something tight above the hole to stop the bleeding."</p>

<p>Whitcomb shook his head at the information but made no comment
on it. The day was clear and warm and beautiful, the sky blue, the
not quite evaporated dew on the meadow grasses sparkling in the
morning's mild sunshine. They passed through long wet-odored forest
aisles in which stillness lay so deep as to seem to be the layered
accumulation of ten thousand years. Little creeks charged briskly
across their route; they forded a river, caught the first sight of
the prairie and moved on at a better pace.</p>

<p>"I'll have somebody in Oregon City take back the horse you
borrowed from Stricklin."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;let him do it. His woman needs an excuse to get to
town."</p>

<p>"Your perceptions," said Whitcomb, "might make you a good
doctor. On the other hand, if they're so strong they soak up other
people's miseries, you might be a bad doctor."</p>

<p>"Misery's hard to look at, any time," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"Physical misery is," amended Whitcomb. "But the Creator did one
good thing when He made us. While it lasts, pain's bad. When it
goes we forget it. If the memory of pain accumulated in our minds
like a bank account, we'd never stand it&mdash;we'd kill
ourselves."</p>

<p>They came into Alpheus Stricklin's round meadow and found
Stricklin, wife, and two horses waiting. Mrs. Stricklin had coffee
and deer meat and bread ready and while the two changed gears,
Stricklin counseled Burnett. "I went down to Petty's this morning.
He'll have a couple more fresh horses on the trail when you reach
there. That's ten miles." They downed the coffee and took bread and
meat with them and went away, Mrs. Stricklin's voice coming after.
"Stop on the way back, doctor. I have got some complaints."</p>

<p>As they ran up the short valley beyond Stricklin's the doctor
finished his meat and bread and grew talkative. "Most of her
complaints are imaginary and I shall wipe them away with a few
spoonfuls of something sweet or something bitter; the things which
are real with her I'll possibly not be able to help at all." Then
he added, "It's a wonderful thing how powerful the mind is."</p>

<p>"Living around people, you don't have to face your mind so
much," commented Burnett. "Living alone, you do. I've seen a lot of
solitary men. They're either damned strong, or damned queer." He
changed the subject. "Have a look at Gay while you're there.
There's something wrong with him. One arm seems lame&mdash;he keeps
rubbing it&mdash;he handles it like a stick of wood."</p>

<p>Again the doctor took the news thoughtfully and made no comment.
They crossed the second river, ran steadily through timber and
meadow, and came to the edge of the prairie. Along that part of the
trail they found Petty waiting with two fresh horses; they swapped
and went on, and in early afternoon they reached Lord's notch and
turned south. The Gay yard contained a dozen neighbors when they
arrived. Whitcomb dropped from his horse, loosened his saddle bags
and went into the cabin.</p>

<p>Burnett crawled from his horse and spoke to McIver. "Your horse
is at Stricklin's, twenty miles up."</p>

<p>"Never mind it&mdash;I'll take care of that."</p>

<p>He walked to the wash rack outside the cabin, and scrubbed hands
and face, and lighted his pipe. Inside, he heard Mrs. Millard
crying, and Millard's very low voice answering the doctor.
Katherine came out and took his arm and led him to the camp bench.
The big fire burned in the yard, coffeepot and stew kettle swung
over it. She went into the cabin for dishes and brought Burnett a
meal from the fire; she sat across the bench while he ate.</p>

<p>"How's he making out?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said. "He's not said much&mdash;not
complained. The leg looks queer."</p>

<p>The neighbors drifted over. John Gay sat on the bench, watching
the cabin's door. Presently Mrs. Gay emerged and walked a few feet
into the yard, twisting both arms in and out of her apron; and then
she turned back into the cabin. Whitcomb appeared and gave the camp
bench a look. "I'll want that bench inside pretty soon." He sat
down and got his pipe and filled it and lighted it; he drew heavy
on it. "You might put a kettle of water on the fire, Katherine. I
want to wash." His face settled, grew bare, grew angular. He seemed
to Burnett to turn himself into another man&mdash;a hard man, a
cold man. Looking about, he estimated the men watching him. He
spoke to Harris Eby. "Have you got pretty steady nerves? I'll need
you." He nodded at Provost. "And you," and his attention moved past
the women, paused at Collingwood and went on, and stopped on
McIver. "You," he said, and finally he noticed Lot White. "I want
you, too, but I want your blacksmith's muscles, I don't want your
prayers."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Burnett.</p>

<p>"I have got to take off Millard's leg above the knee and it will
require four pretty strong men to hold him down."</p>

<p>"Oh, God," murmured Mrs. Provost. "Oh, God." Burnett's muscles
tightened, a short shock hit him in the stomach and left its
uneasiness behind. He watched the stubborn expression come to
Katherine. Mrs. Irish said: "Is there anything you want from any of
us&mdash;anything?"</p>

<p>"I want you ladies to take Mrs. Millard home."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mrs. Buck, "she won't want to go."</p>

<p>"Get her out of this yard," said Whitcomb. "Beyond the meadow.
Half a mile away. When the knife hits him his voice will carry that
far." He rose and moved to the washbasin and took it to the fire;
and he stood there, sucking the last smoke from his pipe, until the
water began to steam in the kettle. He filled the basin and went to
the washstand to clean his hands. Finished, he knocked out his pipe
and walked into the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gay appeared in a moment with Mrs. Millard. Mrs. Millard
said, "I'd rather stay, Martha." She put aside Martha Gay's arm;
she turned to go back. The other women walked over the yard and got
around her and Mrs. Provost said, "We'll go on a bit." Mrs. Millard
moved with the pressure of the women but she moved slowly and she
said in a more rapid voice: "Why&mdash;what's he going to do to
Millard? I'll stay here&mdash;I'd rather&mdash;I won't leave him."
She was carried onward, her voice trying to rise above the other
voices; she made an attempt to swing but arms circled her and the
talk continued quick and smooth, riding over her words, riding over
her questions; they passed through the gate and started into the
meadow.</p>

<p>Whitcomb came to the door and made a sign. The four men he
wanted&mdash;Eby and Lot White and Provost and McIver&mdash;carried
the camp bench into the house. The door closed. From the meadow
Mrs. Millard saw it and she raised her voice and fought at the
other women with her doubled fists, and broke through and came
running back. Lattimore got to the door before her and placed
himself against it; she struck at him, she hit him in the face, she
threw her shoulder against him and tried to go around; her face was
long, stubborn, crazy. Lattimore trapped her hands. "You can't do
it, Nancy," said Lattimore. "Stop that&mdash;stop it." The women
came around her again in a smothering circle. She quit fighting
Lattimore; she let the women move her away from the door; she
turned and put her head against the cabin wall.</p>

<p>Whitcomb's voice went on very quietly inside the cabin, Millard
now and then breaking through with equal quietness. Presently the
talk ceased. The bench legs scraped the puncheon floor. There was
silence for a short time, followed by Whitcomb's voice, much
briefer, much lower. After that the silence built up until Burnett
found himself braced against it. Everybody in the yard stood with
the same stiff expectancy, everybody watched the cabin. Mrs.
Provost's chin lifted, her lips parted, and her shoulders rose
until they could go no higher and she began to tremble. Katherine
turned about and walked rapidly away. Mrs. Millard, against the
house wall, lifted and pressed her hands flat against the logs,
pressed her listening ear against them.</p>

<p>From Millard came a short surprised, "Ah." He caught himself and
spoke to Whitcomb; and Whitcomb's voice went gently on a little
while. Then Millard's voice shot upward in a solid cry of pain
which carried on and on until the waiting for him to run out of
breath strained Burnett. The sound stopped, the man's sucking lungs
threw spongy echoes into the yard; the cry came again, higher and
higher, breaking into surging, grunting gasps of agony.
"Ahhh&mdash;Ahhh&mdash;Jesus&mdash;Ahhh&mdash;Ahhh!" Mrs. Millard
stretched her hands high over her head and began to claw downward
across the rough-barked logs.</p>

<p>Burnett followed Katherine. Sensation went creeping along his
legs. He thought of Whitcomb's knife making its cut straight
through flesh to leg bone, going round and round until the cut was
clear. Sound came steadily from Millard's throat, whooping,
hallooing, gurgling, gasping, cursing, unbearably intense. His
manhood was departing from him; the cry lost its deep quality; it
turned into a scream. Katherine was fifty feet ahead, walking fast;
she had her hands tight-locked over her chest, had her head down.
She looked around and slowed when she saw Burnett and he came up
and caught her arm and they moved on together with the scalding
cries following them. "Ahhh&mdash;ahhh&mdash;a-huhh!" They were
hurrying into the meadow but they never got beyond the sound; they
came to the trees and stopped. Burnett settled his back against a
fir. He listened to Millard's strength die out; the screaming
shifted to a feminine tone, it shortened, it bubbled, it fell to an
exhausted moaning.</p>

<p>Katherine moved against him, settling her head against his
chest. He put his arms around her and felt each sound strike
through her; she was a target, quivering at each bullet.</p>

<p>"Hell's here," he said. "It's right here."</p>

<p>The sound from the cabin slowly diminished; there was nothing
left to come out of Millard. If he survived this, Burnett thought,
he was a good man. Why should he want to survive it? Not for
pride&mdash;there was none of that left in Millard now. The sound
ceased, Katherine grew still, whispering. "I hope he fainted."</p>

<p>"Fainted&mdash;or dead."</p>

<p>Far out on the meadow's other edge he saw young Joe Gay crouched
like an Indian, both hands clapped over his ears. Nobody moved in
the yard; they were statues facing the cabin. Mrs. Millard was
still at the cabin's wall, hands high above her. Time went on,
everybody still, everybody waiting. It was an hour, or perhaps
longer, when the cabin door opened and he saw Lot White come out.
He felt the wire-tense strain leave Katherine; her body settled
easier against him. He said to Katherine, "All right," and turned
her back to the yard.</p>

<p>Lot White moved through the yard and on down the trail, hands
hanging full length and scoop-shaped; he stumbled and caught
himself and went on. Harris Eby emerged from the cabin with
something wrapped in a cloth; sweat streaks, long since dry, netted
a face turned ash-gray. There was a bitter pucker around his lips.
He went on with the bundle, disappeared in the barn and appeared
with a shovel, and crossed the meadow to disappear in the trees.
McIver and Provost came out; then Whitcomb stepped through the
doorway and spoke to Mrs. Millard. "All right." When she turned
from the wall Burnett noticed her bloody fingers and he looked back
to the cabin wall and saw the deep, red-splashed claw marks on the
bark. She went into the cabin, Martha Gay following. Whitcomb got
the basin and went to the water kettle at the fire. He filled the
basin; he stooped to wash, but presently he settled to one knee and
steadied himself. When he was through he filled his pipe and came
over to Burnett and Katherine.</p>

<p>"Did he make it?" asked Burnett.</p>

<p>"So far," said Whitcomb. He was still a bare, hard, cold
man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Millard was crying. She kept saying, "Oh
Millard&mdash;Millard&mdash;God help you! God help you,
Millard!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Provost said: "Gram and the Old Man will stay with us."</p>

<p>"We'll take Joe," said Mrs. McIver. "I guess John and Martha
will want to sleep in their wagon&mdash;but where'll you go,
Katherine?"</p>

<p>"Collingwood's."</p>

<p>John Gay spoke to Whitcomb. "You'll be stayin' awhile?"</p>

<p>"Long as necessary."</p>

<p>"Then you'll sleep in the wagon, Joe and I'll take the barn, and
Martha better go with the McIvers."</p>

<p>Lattimore said: "We'll watch Millard's stock."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gay came from the cabin and stood absent-minded before the
group; she put a finger to her lip and looked around her. It was
her recollecting, "let-me-see" expression. Mrs. McIver said to her,
"If anything's wanted, you'll let somebody know?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Martha Gay. "Now we have got to think of
sleepin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her husband told her how it had been arranged. Martha looked at
him a moment, the smallest trace of shortness on her face. "I'll
not leave," she said. "I'll sleep in the barn. How could I
leave?"</p>

<p>Whitcomb emptied his pipe. "Better think of some sleeping,
yourself," he said to Burnett. The cruelty of the thing was in his
eyes; it was around his mouth, making a stranger of him. Burnett
went to the shed and found his gear and came out to the fence and
clapped his hands, bringing in his horse from the farther end of
the meadow. Katherine followed.</p>

<p>When he was ready to go he turned about and watched her a little
while; she smiled and impulse caused him to reach for her hand, and
her fingers fitted around his palm and held on. "You sleep," she
said.</p>

<p>"See you soon."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;soon."</p>

<p>The neighbors were going down the trail afoot; he passed them
and settled to a steady run and soon reached home. Watt Irish had
cared for the stock while he was gone, for the cows were down the
meadow and milk pans were full and the fowls fed. He pulled off
boots, pants and shirt and rolled into bed. Directly before he fell
asleep, which was almost immediately, he remembered Millard's
agony, and suddenly the shadow of the pattern was there, as
something seen deep in water&mdash;unreachable and shapeless, yet
throwing off the emanation of its presence. Nature built men and
tested them to the limits of their endurance, and was unsatisfied
with even the strongest; and this careless creating hand, failing
to find the form and the substance sought for, built and smashed
and built again. The very persistence of creation seemed to say
that from the dust of the destroyed imperfects would sometime come
the one dreamed shape.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>Chapter 33</h2>

<p>ON the third day following the operation Millard was partially
out of pain and ate a little and seemed to have a chance of
recovery. He was thin, he was dull-minded, his vitality was as a
column of water fluctuating up and down a gauge; but he had gotten
to the point where he saw the possible end of his torture and he
was proud of himself, and pride gave him the spirit to hang on. He
even managed a show of humor. "I must be a sinner. Only sinners
last like this."</p>

<p>Whitcomb had stayed with him without break. There was nothing he
could do. The fight was entirely Millard's. Yet the doctor's
presence gave these people a sense of security which, though he
knew it to be bottomless, he could not disturb. This was the first
day he felt able to break free for a little while. He needed the
air, he had promised to go see Mercer's youngest son, and in his
mind was the hope of a meeting with Lucy Collingwood. When he left
the house Gay followed him to the barn.</p>

<p>"Ralph," he said, "say nothing to anybody about this but I want
you to have a look at my arm."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with it?" asked Whitcomb, although his eyes had
already given him some information.</p>

<p>Gay took his right arm and lifted the left. "It won't work by
itself. It's numb. At first it was only in my finger tips. Now it's
clear up to the elbow and where it ain't altogether numb it's got a
steady ache. I don't sleep any more."</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>Gay ran a finger across his chest from armpit to armpit.
"There," he said, "like I'm bein' pushed together.
Cramped&mdash;crowded. Don't seem to get full breathing. Kind of a
heavy feeling."</p>

<p>At Whitcomb's sign the older man removed coat and shirt and in
the half light of the barn, Gay's ears cocked for the sound of his
wife's voice, the doctor's fingers tested Gay's arm from fingers to
shoulder; and he tapped Gay's chest, made various probing
explorations at various joints, and ended by looking into Gay's
eyes. When it was done Gay put on his clothes. Whitcomb tried Gay's
pulse. "Think it might be a stroke?" Gay asked.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to be headed that way," said Whitcomb and asked
a great number of questions. He filled and lighted his pipe. "How
long has it been going on?"</p>

<p>"It was in the gorge, first."</p>

<p>"I'll give you something to drink when I come back."</p>

<p>"I'm no woman for medicine and I'd as soon know the truth."</p>

<p>"If I had the truth, you'd get it. I don't know. It may be a
strain, or something pinched. It might be the result of a bruise.
It might be rheumatism. The simplest thing's always best to think;
and it's best to think it'll pass. Most things do. But&mdash;it
could be anything else. It could be something a long way off from
your arm. I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well," said Gay, "it's a serious thing. My feeling is I'm going
to die of it. I wish I knew what it was."</p>

<p>"I wish I could tell you. There's not much I know. There's not
much I can do, or any doctor can do. Set an arm, cut a
leg&mdash;simple syrups for simple things&mdash;a little of this, a
little of that. That's not much. A thousand things go on in your
body. Once in a long while I'll reach something and fix it. Not
often. It's your body and most of the time the only thing I can do
is sit by and watch you get well or die. There's not many times in
my practice I can say I helped anything, or saved anybody. We don't
know much."</p>

<p>"Don't tell Martha anything," said John Gay.</p>

<p>"I won't," said Whitcomb and rode over the yard into the trail.
Martha, he realized, already knew.</p>

<p>After Mercer's he took a roundabout way through the settlement,
paying his respects at a dozen cabins; and crossed at the Irish
ford and turned home. For three days the closeness of Lucy had
haunted him. Listening at night to the tortured threshings of
Millard, he had thought of her; since his last meeting with her he
had built a thousand warm and colored images of her in his head,
each one comforting him, tantalizing him; in his mind the love
scene had been played out often, the tentative approaches, the
words so carefully chosen, the touch of her hands, the growing of
the thing between them until, seeing encouragement on her face, he
broke the restraint and took her. The rest was all glory and
delight; it was poetry and cannibalism, it was wonder upon wonder,
it was the matching of soul and appetite so complete that when he
was through envisioning it he could only shake his head at the
great hunger which fed these phantasies until they glowed brighter
than any light the world held.</p>

<p>When he sighted the Collingwood cabin through the trees the
excitement came again and for a moment he was hopeful, he was
eager. But he had not slept since reaching the settlement and
weariness bore him downward. By the time he was abreast the cabin
he had almost talked himself out of the visit; but she had seen him
and she was in the doorway and when her smile came to him the
grayness left his mind and he thought, <i>Why have I always got to
muddy things up by thinking too much?</i> He reined in the horse
before her. He felt wonderful, he felt self-conscious. Her neatness
never failed to surprise him for though she had the common lot of
work to do, and had no more wealth or leisure than any other woman
in the settlement, she always took pains with her appearance. Much
of the time, in his profession, he came upon people in their slack
moments but he had never seen her at such a time.</p>

<p>"Coffee's on," she said. "Come down."</p>

<p>He let the horse stand and went inside and for want of better
conversation he repeated something he had said before. "Coffee's
hard to come by. You should take care to whom you give."</p>

<p>"I do take care," she said. "I'm very particular."</p>

<p>"Where's George?"</p>

<p>She was at the fireplace, handling the water kettle; she had her
back to him. "He went over to Rinearson's to see if he could be of
any help."</p>

<p>"Nothing he could do there that I can see. They tell me Whit
took to the woods&mdash;and the marshal's gone back to Oregon
City."</p>

<p>"It was just his notion," she said. "He likes to be helpful." In
his present mood, perceptions alert, he tried to make something of
the remark, but her tone was casual. It was only a remark, nothing
intended. She made the coffee and set it against the fire. "Be done
in a minute. How've you been?" She gave him a closer attention.
"You've not had much sleep."</p>

<p>"Catnaps. I thought I might see you at Gay's sooner or
later."</p>

<p>"I couldn't think of a thing I could do to be useful so I stayed
away. Katherine's slept here and I've heard how it's been. Is he
really better?"</p>

<p>"He'll make it unless something happens in the next day or
so."</p>

<p>"I admire him so much. I keep wondering why he had to be the one
to go through such a thing." She rose to pour the coffee and set on
cream and butter and bread. "It's silly, but there are times I
can't help rebelling. Even if it's beyond anybody's power, it's
still unjust...No sugar, Ralph."</p>

<p>"Next time I come from Oregon City I'll bring a little in my
saddlebags."</p>

<p>She thought about it and gave him a straight look. "Would that
be so wise?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think of that. But would you take it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I'd take it."</p>

<p>"Well, then, to hell with wise or not wise."</p>

<p>She laughed and she shook her head at him. "You like to pretend
you're one of these hell-for-leather men. But you're not. You're
quite serious. You like to think of yourself as a skeptical man.
You're not that, either."</p>

<p>"I fool a lot of people."</p>

<p>"We all do, and that's a good thing. Wouldn't it be embarrassing
if we didn't&mdash;couldn't? Still, I'm not sure we fool as many
people as we think. When I look at Gram Gay I feel she knows just
about everything about me, and about everybody else for that
matter. She's the only old person I don't pity for being old. It's
not possible to pity a person that strong. You just hope you can be
something like that when your turn comes to be old."</p>

<p>"My turn's come already," he said.</p>

<p>"You've no gray hairs yet, no deep lines." Watching him, her
laughter came back. "Is it sympathy you want?"</p>

<p>Her color was good, her eyes clear, her expression firm; she was
in better health&mdash;or in better mind&mdash;than he had seen her
before. Vigor held her shoulders up and gave her animation. Her
hands were quiet on her lap; her hair was smoothly done and a pair
of earrings stirred when she moved her head.</p>

<p>"Now, Dr. Whitcomb, don't look at me with such professional
eyes. More coffee?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. It amused him to think how carefully he had,
in his moments of daydreaming, fashioned and rehearsed the phrases
he had meant to use. They were no good to him now. He had never
been so unsure of himself. On the previous visit he had gotten
close to her and he had left with the feeling that she had promised
something at the next meeting; returning, he had expected to go on
where they had left off. But he neither saw nor felt anything of
that closeness. She was friendly but she wasn't the Lucy
Collingwood he had almost kissed, and he thought to himself: <i>You
don't know a damned thing about women.</i> Apparently there was no
such thing as progressing from point to point with them; if they
moved to a certain place one time, they weren't there next time. It
was mood that governed them, not logic. He caught himself on that;
he knew better. It was mood, but there was always logic behind the
mood. Not man's logic, but theirs, and their logic was for all its
seeming contradiction more straightforward than man's. Well, she
had thought it over and her common sense had stopped her; perhaps
she was telling him now, in this proper and pleasant way, that she
had better command of her emotions. He put his phrases and his
hopes aside. If this was her wish, he would make no more moves; for
she was old enough to know what she wished to do, and argument had
no part in it. What he wished for was a woman&mdash;this
woman&mdash;coming to him freely. It wasn't seduction he
wanted.</p>

<p>He had finished the coffee and laid the cup on the table and he
had his eyes on the scrolled brown pattern of the cup while he went
through his thinking. She made a small motion with her hand,
drawing his glance, and he saw that her lips were rounded by the
warmest of smiles. "Oh Ralph&mdash;Ralph," she said, and shook her
head at him.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and his own smile, he thought, must
have been wry enough to betray him. "Well," he said, and rose and
moved to the door. He stood there, watching the soft sunshine
sparkle on the deep dull green of the timber. "Strange business.
Christmastime, temperature sixty-five or thereabouts, and green
grass all over hell and gone. Home now we'd have the snow alleys
shoveled from house to barn."</p>

<p>She said nothing. Looking around he noticed she had risen from
the table and stood at the fireplace, turned from him. He remained
irresolute in the doorway, watching the trail's foreshortening as
it ran through the timber toward Gay's. He said, "I hear George
intends to run for the legislature."</p>

<p>Her answer was short. "Yes."</p>

<p>"Who's going to do the work around here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"None of my business, but he ought to give that some
thinking."</p>

<p>"We all ought to do more thinking than we do. We should all be
reasonable, do the right thing, live the right way, never make the
wrong move. It's harder for some people than others. It's not so
hard for you, is it?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have offered my advice," he said. He was
embarrassed.</p>

<p>"But you didn't answer the question."</p>

<p>"You should know the answer," he said. He was as short as she
had been and he was sorry for it at once, and tried to turn it.
"Pretty here with the sun on the meadow."</p>

<p>"Then the sun goes down and it's not so pretty. When I'm here
alone I catch every sound. They're like big boots stamping down an
empty hall. I'm the empty hall. You don't know much about
loneliness, do you? Even my thoughts rattle in the emptiness, and
if I cried who'd hear and what would it matter? Year by year I dry
up little by little. I'm alive have something left. What shall I do
with it, what shall I do with myself? Go crazy like poor Roxy? I
know her better than anybody else around here. I know what was
inside her and I know she heard that terrible rattle in
nothingness. Even Lockyear is better than what she had. These women
with their husbands, so comfortable, so blind&mdash;why should they
judge her? What do they know? I listen to my heart beat and feel
blood go through me to every part of my body, and it crowds so hard
I could burst. But down in the center of me it's dryer and dryer,
emptier and emptier, and it's spreading, and one day there'll be
nothing but dust in me and I'll be afraid to look in a mirror. So
much, so much but nothing to do with it; and then it's gone and I'm
wasted when I wasn't meant to be. Lot White can't tell me we were
given life to spoil like that. That's a worse hell than anything he
can think up."</p>

<p>He swung over the room and turned her about. Even then there was
uncertainty in him; only the shock of her words, with their implied
suggestion of his failure, pushed him through the barrier. When he
put his arms around her and saw the lifting of her face, doubt
died. He kissed her and he was no longer a critical man. He had
meant to be gentle&mdash;that too was his planned way of telling
her how deeply he felt&mdash;but the touch of her lips broke his
restraint, knocking down his reserve; the taste of her made its
demand for a wilder taste; possession bred the intolerable wish for
more possession. He used her roughly but he scarcely knew it.</p>

<p>She drew off, her face tense and dark, and she looked at him in
a strange manner and came back to him with her own rush of feeling.
They hung together, swaying side to side, arms clenched about each
other, pressing in until strain tired them. She slid her face
aside, against his face, whispering: "I was desperate. I thought
you meant to go away and not come back."</p>

<p>"I did. I thought you didn't want me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph, I was only trying to make myself presentable to you
attractive."</p>

<p>"You'd look attractive to me in a wet blanket."</p>

<p>"You just think so. You'll never catch me looking like that.
I've kept my hair combed and my nice dress on for three days."</p>

<p>He glanced around the room, at the two small chairs, at the
rocker, at the bed. He took her hand and crossed the room and sat
on the bed. She stood before him, looking down, prying into him
with her glance, and he saw a streak of uncertainty go through her;
and the delay made him self-conscious. She saw it immediately and
dropped beside him. He put his arms around her but the awkwardness
hung on. She whispered, "Turn about," and dropped back on the bed.
When he swung she drew him to her and then the awkwardness went
away. He was the stag and she was the pool; but no matter how much
he drank there was one more swallow he needed. He eased himself
beside her for comfort and they were motionless for a long run of
time, until he grew conscious of the open door and of the soft soil
across which anybody might silently come. He rose and went to the
door to look around the meadow; he came back and sat beside
her.</p>

<p>"Now that begins," she said. He didn't catch her meaning and she
nodded toward the door. "Expecting to be discovered, little tricks,
wondering when we'll be caught up."</p>

<p>"You're sorry."</p>

<p>"No. Never, never. It's like a lot of things. Maybe it's too
bad, maybe it's wrong, maybe it's&mdash;everything. But it had to
happen. Like poor Millard's leg. What can be done about it?
Nothing. I've wanted this to happen so much that there's been
nothing else in my mind. I've been absentminded&mdash;crazy,
walking back and forth, not knowing what I was doing." She took his
hand and laid it over her heart. "That's got to beat for somebody
or what's the good of it?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, smiling about it, sad about it. "We're worse
off than we were before. We've got something but we want more.
There'll always be more we want. It's like an engagement which
can't end in marriage."</p>

<p>"You knew it would be that way. You've thought about it a lot.
First time was in the wagon, in the gorge, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"After you left I lay there and thought and thought and thought.
Your hand touched me. It burned for a long time. It spread. I
didn't sleep much." She watched him. "I think it's worse on you
than on me. Please don't worry about it. Maybe it'll help you to
know that I think whatever I get from this is good. A little or a
lot, all of it's good. I won't complain." Then she surprised him
with her directness. "Do you want to talk about George?"</p>

<p>"Hadn't given him much thought."</p>

<p>"Then let's leave it that way."</p>

<p>He said slowly, "You know what I want."</p>

<p>"Yes. That's all right."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>She said: "I'll leave it to you." But she saw the quickening in
him and she added, "Right now would be dangerous."</p>

<p>"Could you get to Oregon City?"</p>

<p>"George talks about making some trips. I'll go along when he
takes one there. I know he wants to go to Fort Vancouver for
something, but I can stay in Oregon City while he goes."</p>

<p>"That's it," he said. "How soon?"</p>

<p>"Soon," she whispered. "Oh, so soon."</p>

<p>He went to the door again and had a look into the meadow and
came back. He was amused at himself. "People do the damn'dest
things."</p>

<p>"Are you surprised?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "It's fine to be people." He saw the signal on
her face and he dropped to the bed and it was the same thing over
again until his sense of danger began to work at him. He rose and
drew his watch. "Somebody in the settlement&mdash;Mrs. Provost,
maybe&mdash;is keeping tab, you can be certain." He gave her a hand
and helped her up.</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to be worried," she said. "Maybe I
am&mdash;oh, I don't know. Yes I do know. I'm not." She moved a
mirror and looked at herself and made quick adjustments of her
hair. He stepped behind her, catching her reflection in the mirror;
her lips were swollen and the steel-pointed stubble on his face had
reddened her chin. She looked back to him from the mirror, her eyes
sending their special meaning to him and when she had finished with
her hair she came about and laid her hands on his shoulders. She
was pleased with him and with herself, she was confident and gay;
he couldn't see a single flaw of morbidness anywhere. She gave him
a light kiss and drew her hand across his jaw. "Don't you be
disturbed. It was good&mdash;it will be good. Do you like me?"</p>

<p>"More than that, Lucy. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped him, laughing. "Tell me next time." She gripped his
arms and shook him. "Oh, darling&mdash;soon, soon. Now you go home,
and I hope you'll be as miserable alone as I'll be." She went to
the door with him, watched him lift to the saddle and ride away.
From the end of the meadow he looked back and caught the kiss she
blew to him. Entering the trees he thought of how confident all
this had made her, thinking ahead to the consequences which came of
his interfering in her life. But none of that appeared to touch
her. It was the first things first with women; everything else was
blown away before the wind of their primary reasoning. Thinking of
her all the way to Gay's, he was very gentle, very thoughtful, very
happy.</p>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>Chapter 34</h2>

<p>HE identified Lot White's voice, rolling from the cabin in
prayer, as soon as he reached the yard and he got off his horse
with an irritation quite close to intolerance. But as he stepped to
the cabin's doorway he was taken by a mellower mood and it occurred
to him that in Lot's eyes he was as much a bigot as he thought Lot
to be; and so he kept his peace when he saw Lot, Mrs. Millard and
Mrs. Gay kneeling beside Millard on the bed. Millard's eyes were
shut but he wasn't asleep, for his hands moved across each other
nervously. <i>Exhausting him, and maybe shaking brimstone coals all
over him, he thought.</i> Raising his head, Lot White noticed
Whitcomb and a be-damned-to-you-I'm-goin'-to-do-it-anyhow
expression came to his face. He finished his prayer and rose to
speak to Millard. "You feel better now, brother? Ready to meet your
Maker? Resigned to it&mdash;got the glory of it?"</p>

<p>Millard kept his eyes closed; his voice was weak. "Am I supposed
to be scared or happy?"</p>

<p>"Feel glory," said Lot White. "God and devil are strugglin' for
you don't you worry who'll make out best."</p>

<p>Millard's hand crawled up to his chest; he tapped it with a
finger. "I'm doin' the strugglin', Lot."</p>

<p>"Be humble, man."</p>

<p>"To hell with humble," said Millard. "I made the grade and I'm
damned proud of myself."</p>

<p>Whitcomb caught the blacksmith's eye and drew him from the
cabin. Lot, expecting trouble, met it more than halfway. "Don't
tell me," he said. "I won't listen. I know God&mdash;you don't. I
feel him&mdash;you don't. I love him and I believe in him&mdash;you
don't. I'll not listen."</p>

<p>They went walking over the yard, a long time silent. Whitcomb
saw a stem of grass, gray and dead, sticking up from the mud; he
reached for it, held it between his fingers. "Look. There's
Millard. He's got barely strength to hang on, no more. You ever
been sick? Really sick? Flat in bed, ready to die?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then you don't know how everything pinches down until one small
grain of strength makes the difference. Anything can destroy
it&mdash;a word, a thought, a draft of air, a cough. Then he snaps,
like this." His finger came lightly across the gray grass stem and
broke it clean.</p>

<p>All the while Lot White had steadily shaken his head and when
Whitcomb was through he had his certain answer ready. "You don't
believe, so you don't see. Neither you nor I nor him has got any
say in whether he lives or dies. You think you made your finger
break that stem? No you didn't. God wanted that stem broken and he
moved your finger. If God says Millard stays alive, all the wind on
earth could blow through that door and not disturb him; if God says
he dies, it'll take a wind no bigger than enough to tremble a cat's
whisker to do it&mdash;for God's in the wind, God's the wind
itself."</p>

<p>"So God was the bullet that went through Millard's leg, and God
pushed my hand when I took off Millard's leg&mdash;and he is solely
responsible for the agony Millard went through?"</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It's not for you and me to know, Ralph."</p>

<p>"There has got to be a reason," insisted Whitcomb.</p>

<p>"Buried deep in the book whose pages you and I ain't ever goin'
to see. We're sinners, we're all sinners, and we got to
suffer."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it's so."</p>

<p>"You say I don't believe in God," Whitcomb pointed out, "but if
he guided my hand when I took off Millard's leg, then he must have
wanted me to be his instrument. Why did he choose me? Why not a
better man?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Lot White.</p>

<p>"You think the devil might get in me&mdash;might be in me?"</p>

<p>"He certainly could be."</p>

<p>"Well, Lot," said Whitcomb, "do you think maybe he might crawl
into you, and send you into the cabin to kill Millard by tiring him
too much?"</p>

<p>"I am the Lord's man," said Lot White.</p>

<p>"You're entirely sure of that?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"He sent you a sign&mdash;he spoke to you personally&mdash;he
told you that you were above other men in understanding, mercy,
purity of heart&mdash;past anger, past meanness, past judgment of
others?"</p>

<p>"It would be unseemly to answer that question."</p>

<p>"Well, Lot," said Whitcomb with a show of good nature, "I
shouldn't have begun the argument. I serve my way, you serve yours.
I shan't trouble your people, but you must not bother my
patients."</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Lot White, "I want to talk to you." They were
beyond the yard. Lot White halted, faced Whitcomb full on. He rose
slightly on his heels. "You're an educated man. You've read books.
You can use words like whips and knives and things that stab.
You're proud of your learnin'. You have thought about mysterious
things I ain't ever heard of. You know a lot. You know so much
about so much that there's nothin' fixed and fast in your soul,
nothin' shinin' white, nothin' pit-black. You don't think much of
sin, you don't think much of glory. What am I against you? Nothin'.
I'm an ignorant man. I got no strange ideas, I got poor
words&mdash;I am a rough and homely fellow. But I know one thing,
and it's enough for me, and it's my life, and I believe it so much
I'd cut off my arm for it. There's nothin' in the world big enough
for you to cut off your arm for. That's the difference. Yet around
this settlement you are a respected man and your influence has got
power to move folks, but I am only that old fool Lot White. I know
what they think."</p>

<p>"Why, Lot," said Whitcomb most gently, "everybody knows your
heart's right."</p>

<p>Lot White brushed the remark aside. "There's right&mdash;and
there's wrong. We're all sinners, we're all losers, we suffer and
we pay. It's a hard world, it was meant to be, it's the soul's
testin' place, that's what it is. But there's right and there's
wrong, and men must support right because it's always tremblin' in
the balance. You have got the power, they listen to you. You have
got the example to set, they watch you. I can preach for a month,
but you come along and by a word or a laugh you can wash my
preachin' away."</p>

<p>"Lot," said Whitcomb seriously, "I've argued with you. I've sent
you away from my patients when I thought they needed rest, but I've
never spoken against you. I'd never knowingly unsettle any other
man's faith."</p>

<p>Lot had been looking toward the ground as he listened. Now he
raised his disturbing light eyes and drove his glance into
Whitcomb. "You are about to do a wrong thing. Don't do it."</p>

<p>It took Whitcomb a moment to realize what Lot White meant. When
it came to him he grew quietly and enormously angry. "I'll have no
interference in my private life."</p>

<p>"There's no private life when others are concerned."</p>

<p>"Let it alone," said Whitcomb brusquely.</p>

<p>Lot White sighed and his big shoulders settled; visibly strong
emotion possessed him though he kept his voice down. "You could be
such a good man&mdash;but you're such a bad man. You have troubled
me with your questions. You have made me falter. It's your words
that have got the maggots of doubt in me this minute. I ain't ever
going to forgive you for it. Now you're going to trouble other
lives. If that's all your education means to you then it'd be
better if all the schools were burned and you were dead." He
wheeled, walked over the yard to his horse and rode away.</p>

<p>Beyond the Collingwood place, in the timber, he left his horse
and knelt against a tree; and he made a long prayer, and at the end
of it he said: "He's not your man, God. Not your man at all. Give
him light. Strike him, tear the evil from his bones. Let not this
thing happen which is about to happen, for if it happens, what am I
to think? It'd be better to take him from the earth right now. Give
me a sign, O Lord. Let me know what to believe, for I am lost and I
don't know where to walk. There's no power in my limbs and my voice
has lost the call. Why is this, when blind men thrive around me?
What have I done? Give me a sign, oh my God, for I'm failin'."</p>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>Chapter 35</h2>

<p>LIGE EBBETT had gone into the hills hunting, leaving Lavinia
alone in the farthest southward cabin of the settlement, beyond
Rinearson's, beyond Kitchen's. It was middle afternoon, the
constant grayness of the timber even then creeping across the short
meadow to the cabin. She had eaten a piece of bread with tea, she
had industriously cleaned the room, she had patched a shirt. Now,
stepping to the doorway, she unexpectedly discovered two Indians
crouched against the cabin's wall.</p>

<p>She was a thin, quiet girl of seventeen, possessing little,
expecting little, and inclined to efface herself in the presence of
other people. The shock of this contact with the Indians sent
fright through her and thus temporarily rooted she watched the two
come toward her. One of them made a motion at his stomach, opened
his mouth and stuck a finger into it. She knew he meant food, but
food was the scarcest of their possessions, limited to half a sack
of wheat, some tea, a few cooked pieces of venison and a loaf of
bread on the shelf. Much as she was afraid of Indians, she was
afraid of hunger more, and she shook her head and stood her
ground.</p>

<p>The Indian nearest her made his sign again in a more peremptory
manner. Both were miserable specimens, ragged hair hanging in oily
hanks about their heads, grease-dirty, rank-odored, and with
inflamed eyes overcast by pale patches. She shook her head again,
whereupon both Indians reached out to shove her aside and to go
rummaging around the place, finding the wheat and the cold meat and
the bread. Meat and bread they tore into pieces which they divided
and began to eat on the spot. Seeing herself despoiled, Lavinia's
fear melted before the outrage and she said, "You filthy
creatures&mdash;scat&mdash;scat! My bread, no!" She looked about
her, saw the broom, seized it and rushed forward, striking the
handle into the ribs of the Indian closest by. He was not injured
but he was stung; clamping a chunk of meat between his teeth, he
caught the broom, broke it and took one of its pieces and rapped
Lavinia over the head. She closed in, she scratched him, she
grabbed his shirt&mdash;a white man's flannel shirt&mdash;and
ripped it up the front. Before she could do more damage, the Indian
caught her, kicked her in the stomach with his moccasined foot and
shoved her through the door. She ran around the house to the shed
and seized a pitchfork. Meanwhile the Indians, finding no more
food, upset such hand-made furniture as the room contained, banged
her iron kettles on the floor and jumped through the doorway.
Coming about the cabin's corner she saw one of them packing off her
best blanket and she cried, "You drop that," and ran at the Indian
with the extended pitchfork. She got the bare end of it into the
calves of his retreating legs; she tried to overtake him but lost
distance; she seized a rock from the ground and flung it
fruitlessly at him; and she came to a stop and watched both savages
lightly run to the trees and disappear. Going back to the cabin she
looked at the casual damage about the room and sat down to cry.
When she was through crying, which was the result of failure to
stop the Indians rather than of fear, Lavinia put on a shawl and
started for Rinearson's to spread the news.</p>

<h2><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>Chapter 36</h2>

<p>ON New Year's Eve Burnett had had supper with the Hawns and
found the visit uncomfortable, Hawn very quiet and Louisa
disappearing as soon as the meal was on the table. It seemed to
Burnett that even some of Hawn's friendliness had vanished; and
later, returning to his own place, Burnett made the guess that
Hawn, no longer happy with his wife and watching a good life fall
to pieces, blamed the settlers for it.</p>

<p>Returning, Burnett got a good fire going&mdash;the wind having
brought the snow-chilled air from the mountains&mdash;and lighted
his pipe to do some thinking about himself. The methodical streak
was on him at the moment and a new year was time to take stock.</p>

<p>He heard a horse cross the dark, and Ralph Whitcomb's hail. He
swung the big water kettle over the fire before he turned to the
door. Whitcomb said: "You've got a boarder for the night. I'll
light out for Oregon City in the morning." He stepped down to take
the gear from the horse and to dump it in the room. Burnett slapped
the horse through the meadow gate and came back to the cabin.
Whitcomb had settled himself at the fire. "Had supper&mdash;don't
want anything. I'm here because I didn't want to eat away any more
of the Gay's grub. They've got a hard scratch before summer."</p>

<p>"We'll all scratch, but we'll make it," said Burnett. "I am, at
this moment, pretty sick of deer meat and I've eaten enough boiled
wheat to crow like a rooster. When I was over at the French
settlement I ate half a jug of honey straight. Frenchmen just
laughed at me, but they understood."</p>

<p>"Hunger's a powerful disturber."</p>

<p>"How's Millard?"</p>

<p>"He'll make it."</p>

<p>"How will he get around&mdash;how will he plow, get on a horse,
ford creeks, go hunting, kneel with a crosscut? It's a hell of a
country for a one-legged man."</p>

<p>"This afternoon he told me he'd been thinking about a wooden leg
in his mind, with a flat bottom for crossing soft fields. He's a
Yankee for tools. He'll make himself a leg that looks like a
country store."</p>

<p>"Takes it well," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"He's proud of himself. Not many survive that operation."
Whitcomb bent forward on the chair soaking in the fire; he was a
dark, able-shaped man, large shoulders and arms and hands; he
dressed better than the settlers and his hands were
soft&mdash;otherwise he didn't resemble a professional man. "Even
so," he reflected, "the experience will change him. He's a survivor
when the rules say he ought to be dead. That makes a difference in
what you think."</p>

<p>They talked a little, they sat silent. Burnett made a pot of
coffee, and took a tour around the yard and came back. That
reminded the doctor of the latest news and he told Burnett of
Lavinia Ebbett's fight with the two Indians. Burnett shook his
head. "I'm sorry about that. We're brewing up a fight, and it
shouldn't be."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't expect you to be sympathetic with Indians," observed
the doctor.</p>

<p>"I know Indians. They're people. All people are alike."</p>

<p>Whitcomb said: "The more a man sees, the less he can condemn.
Then he's out of step with his neighbors, for they want life to be
straight yea or nay."</p>

<p>Burnett freshened his pipe. Whitcomb, he thought, acted like a
man with something on his mind which he wanted to share but
couldn't. That classified it as a personal problem, which brought
Burnett's guess around to Lucy Collingwood.</p>

<p>"It goes farther," Rice said. "If a man sees both sides of
everything, he can't be much of a fighter for anything, and then
he's out of step with himself." The remark, like so many others,
came out in its own casual fashion. He hadn't thought much about
it. Now that he had said it, he began to think about it; and other
notions, sleeping as this one had slept, stirred without form in
his head. It occurred to him then that each man&mdash;never knowing
it&mdash;had a good deal of wisdom soaked into him through the
years of his living, an unrealized fund waiting to be drawn upon;
maybe the difference between a man like Gay and himself was that
Gay knew of the fund and drew upon it and trusted it while others
passed it by through ignorance.</p>

<p>Whitcomb nodded. "You're saying the same thing Lot White said a
few days ago. He said if education didn't make a man stand on the
right side of things, it had better be destroyed. I gathered that
he believes virtuous ignorance better than educated doubt."</p>

<p>"I can't follow that all the way," said Burnett. "What's
education? One of the smartest men I knew couldn't write his own
name. But he could describe a piece of country he passed through so
that you saw it and smelled it. Everything he did seemed to be the
right thing to do. Any man that knew him respected him."</p>

<p>"You know damned well education isn't a matter of books," said
Whitcomb. "It's experience."</p>

<p>"That's not enough," said Burnett. "Everybody gets experience.
It's all we get. But some it helps, and some it doesn't."</p>

<p>"If a man looks at the stars and a feeling comes to him and he
wrestles with the feeling and tries to make sense of it, he's being
educated."</p>

<p>"You make any sense from the stars?" asked Burnett.</p>

<p>"I said <i>try,"</i> pointed out Whitcomb. He helped himself to
more coffee, stirred his finger around it.</p>

<p>"It's the old bone we're chewing on," said Burnett. "Stay
ignorant and be happy. Get wise and grow sad. Be ignorant and
believe just one thing, and fight for it, and die feeling you've
had a hell of a good life. Be wise, and wonder if anything's worth
fighting for, and end up asking why you were born at all."</p>

<p>"Truth and beauty, according to the poets, are two names for the
same thing, and truth is supposed to set men's spirits free."</p>

<p>"But it doesn't," said Burnett. "I go tell a man the truth. Then
we get in a hell of an argument, whether it's true or not. If he
doesn't want to believe it, I don't convince him. If I convince
him, it makes him miserable. Men don't want to change their
superstitions. They're like blankets, dirty and full of fleas; but
they're warm and the man's been sleeping in them so long he don't
want any new-fangled blankets." He grinned at Whitcomb. "What the
hell we talking about?"</p>

<p>Whitcomb looked around the room. "Why aren't you married?"</p>

<p>"And the same to you," said Burnett, cheerfully. "But about this
truth business. When I look around I see a form to most
things&mdash;water and soil, sun and rain, seed and
fruit&mdash;everything works out neat. It's only when you get to
wondering about man that you get off the track."</p>

<p>The doctor made a gesture. "We start from here, knowing nothing.
We're going there&mdash;away down there to the end of the journey
where we'll know everything about everything. We're just a little
way along, neither here nor there. We know something, not much.
We're afraid to leave home, because it's familiar. We're afraid to
walk forward because we don't know what we'll find&mdash;we're
afraid there's nothing to find when we get there."</p>

<p>"Round and round she goes," said Burnett. "But don't let Lot
White hear you say that or you've got an argument."</p>

<p>"We've had several," said Whitcomb. He grew serious and
restless. He made a long study of the fire and Burnett sensed the
man's wish to share something with somebody. "Whether it's heaven
or sleep, what does that matter here? We've got this thing to live
as comfortably and as usefully as possible. There's some freedom,
some joy possible. But, no, we must not laugh in the face of
impending doom. We must be grave, we must bow to angry gods and be
fearful. Dead soon enough, we have got to strangle ourselves little
by little before we die." He struck a palm sharp across his knee.
"What mockery. If there's a God with compassion in him, he must be
sad for the barbarisms we commit in the name of morality." Burnett
bent forward to catch another light for his pipe. He didn't look at
Whitcomb. "You talking against the rules or against your
conscience?"</p>

<p>"Ever settle anything with your conscience?"</p>

<p>This was what Whitcomb had come for, Burnett understood. The
doctor, wanting a woman, had got himself mixed up with the right
and the wrong of it; he was on the edge of the great jump and
couldn't quite spring free. He wanted help. Burnett rose and
crossed to the door. He told himself, <i>He thinks I've been
through this enough times to give him some advice.</i> The wind had
blown the mists out of the sky, the stars glittered frost-sharp.
Wind smell was keen around him. The doctor's horse stood with its
head hooked over the meadow fence. He thought carefully of an
answer, and the answer got longer and longer in his mind as he
tried to cover something which couldn't be covered; and he grew
impatient with himself and said it as briefly as he could.</p>

<p>"I knew an old fellow in St. Louis, one time, about ready to
die. He said the only things he regretted in his life were the
things he didn't do. I wouldn't be surprised if he was mostly
right. There's a consequence to whatever we do, even if we don't do
it. We pay for it. So, do we pay for something, or nothing?"</p>

<p>He turned about to find Whitcomb closely watching him; and
suddenly the doctor rose smiling. "Yes and no. The same old
thing."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>The doctor got his bedroll and opened it on the floor. "No,"
said Burnett, "you sleep on the bunk. You've had some bad
nights."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch37" id="ch37"></a>Chapter 37</h2>

<p>DURING the night he heard one of the horses go scudding across
the meadow; and he lay awake a moment, listening for further sound.
In the morning he cooked breakfast and watched Whitcomb travel down
the trail; and he milked the cows and took a short walk into the
meadow to find some kind of print on the ground which might explain
the horse's momentary fright. He saw nothing and, with pick and
shovel and ax, he moved up the creek a short distance to begin work
on the millrace which he had earlier surveyed. Harvest time was six
months away. During that time he had to finish the race way, build
the mill house, make the wheel and mount it, set in the stones and
rig up the bins for wheat and flour. He had to chop a wider strip
through the timber to make a wagon road, he had to plow his land
and plant. He had to plow for Mrs. Irish, he had to spend time with
other neighbors cutting the main road between Lord's notch and
Walker's. Each chunk of labor he set in its order; the
eighteen-hour days ran solid from now until harvest.</p>

<p>As he worked on the ditch, cutting through gravel and roots to
the lower hard soil, he set himself into the slow swing of the six
months. He was a runner who, with long miles to cover, would break
himself if he ran too fast too soon. He had no fat on him now; he
was muscle, bone and calluses&mdash;he was so fined down that he
was conscious of his energy paying itself out pound by pound as he
worked, felt its quick renewal after mealtime, felt it pay out
again in late afternoon. Sometimes, overstrained, he lay in bed at
night with his body a dull lump through which his drawn nerves
traced their streaks of heat; sometimes his energy collected and
broke through his discipline and he rose to pace the floor with the
male torment upon him.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
During the afternoon he became conscious of motion somewhere in the
woods around him and he stopped to light his pipe and to dredge the
day for its reports. Nothing came to him yet his warned senses
refused to settle. Deep in the timber south of the creek a gun
sounded, those out-rolling thicket-strained echoes thinly arriving;
and later he thought he heard the subdued rustle of brush in the
same direction but nearer at hand. This was when he laid down his
shovel and stepped to his rifle tilted against the nearest tree.
Catching it up, he ran his glance along the dark margin of fir,
alder and willow across the creek; close beside a tree&mdash;half
visible and motionless&mdash;he saw a man's shape. In those shadows
the shape was not to be identified but it didn't appear to be an
Indian. Burnett lifted his rifle and took a steady aim. The man
came out of the brush and into full view immediately, waving a hand
across his body. It was the marshal. He waded over the creek.</p>

<p>"What the God-damn' hell?" he said.</p>

<p>"I was about to mistake you for an Indian," said Burnett.
"You're lucky."</p>

<p>"Man," said the marshal, brisk and pointed, "you and me don't
track well."</p>

<p>"Walk in plain view around here," said Burnett, "and you're all
right. What's your business here?"</p>

<p>"To do what I damn please."</p>

<p>"Fly right at it."</p>

<p>The marshal gave out a short laugh and he shook his head. He
raised one hand to make a circle over his head and presently two
men broke from the timber upstream and moved forward. They were
both strangers to Burnett. One of them said, "He ain't crossed the
creek this morning."</p>

<p>"Well," said the marshal, "he's over there somewhere," and
pointed to the woods southward. "And he's got to come out
somewhere." He lowered his head to think about it, and he sighed.
"My God, I could eat the horns off a bull." Having dropped his
plain hint, he continued to look at the ground, waiting Burnett's
invitation. To any other man Burnett would have issued such an
invitation instantly; but the marshal was after a man; good or bad,
the man belonged to this settlement and therefore the marshal was
no friend of Burnett's. The invitation didn't come and after a
spell of vain waiting the marshal shrugged his shoulders and drew
the two men a few yards down the creek and murmured to them. He
came back to Burnett. "If you see that boy, tell him to give up. He
might get out of it easy, on trial, but if he ain't goin' to come
in, then I got to shoot him if I see him, for he's sent me warnin'
through his dad that he won't be took. That's bad business. Tell
him to come in. He can't run east. That's a hundred miles of
mountains to nowhere. He can't go south. That's empty for eight
hundred miles. He's stuck right around here and it's just a matter
of time before I get a bead on him. I told his dad to tell him. He
wouldn't listen to his dad. You tell him I don't fool."</p>

<p>Burnett nodded and watched the three men walk over the meadow
and disappear into the timber toward Lattimore's. He thought:
<i>He'll creep back here to watch.</i> It was late, but he worked
on the ditch until the shadows began to sift in and the cows moved
across the water and stood waiting at the gate. He milked and
turned the cows back to the meadow. When he entered the shed to lay
the milk on the shelf he heard a chunk of wood strike the shed's
wall. He left the shed and stood a moment, thinking about it; and
he got the ax from the chopping block and circled the shed and
stepped toward the timber, not fifty feet away. Whit's voice
arrived from the deeper darkness. "I've got to eat."</p>

<p>"Wait till she's dark then crawl in on your belly."</p>

<p>"He around?"</p>

<p>"Went down the trail, but I believe he cut back. I'll hit a pan
when I want you to come." He took a few cuts at a branch with the
ax and dragged the branch back to the yard with him and threw it in
the shed; that was for the marshal to puzzle about if he happened
to be watching. It was fully dark then. Watt Irish came up for the
milk.</p>

<p>"Pass anybody, Watt?"</p>

<p>Watt said: "Old Man Rinearson's at Lattimore's. The marshal's
around there somewhere watchin'. Old Man Rinearson says to tell you
that if Whit shows up here, tell him to go to Gay's and get a horse
waiting there but to stay off the trail. Tell him to go to the
French settlement then and see if he can't find some trappin'
outfit that's bound for California. Old man says he'll stay at
Lattimore's, so the marshal will keep watching that place."</p>

<p>"All right," said Burnett. "I'll tell Whit. He's here."</p>

<p>Watt marched away with two full buckets of milk. Burnett cooked
supper and fried an extra skillet of meat; he ate his meal, put the
meat on a plate and poured coffee into a bucket and carried these
things to the shed. He banged the bucket with his knuckles,
presently hearing Whit come around the shed. "Here," said Burnett
quietly, and drew him into the shed's full blackness. "Here's your
grub. I told you to crawl."</p>

<p>"Tired of it."</p>

<p>"Your dad's at Lattimore's, keeping the marshal interested." He
gave Whit the instructions. Then he said, "But you're a fool if you
do it. You're better off if you stay here and let me go find the
marshal. That man's foxy and he'll find you anyhow. He's got a
couple others around here. They've got you pretty well pinned down
and they'll give you no time to talk."</p>

<p>"I won't do it," said Whit. "I ain't goin' to hang."</p>

<p>"You might get cleared. There were two of you. Nobody can prove
you fired the gun."</p>

<p>"I ain't goin' to do it," said Whit. "I told the old man to tell
the marshal to go to hell. I'll shoot him if I see him."</p>

<p>"He'll do the same thing."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of myself. Won't go to California, either. Tell
the old man I'll wear that marshal down till he quits and I'll be
livin' around here when the whole thing's forgotten."</p>

<p>"Don't do it. Quit trying to be like Lockyear."</p>

<p>"I didn't say a word about him, did I?" Whit ate the meat and
drank the coffee. Burnett heard him reach around his pocket for a
pipe.</p>

<p>"Not now&mdash;not here," said Burnett. He lost patience with
the boy. "Don't you know you're just short of being dead? That
fellow means business. Stop being careless."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Whit, "to hell with him." He made no more attempt to
smoke. He got up and moved to the edge of the yard.</p>

<p>"Go around the house and get on your belly and crawl across the
meadow. Stay away from the trail."</p>

<p>Whit disappeared, leaving no word behind him; he wasn't crawling
for the soft echo of his traveling feet came back. Burnett washed
his dishes and filled his woodbox and he was about to go to bed
when he heard a shot break over the meadow. He caught up his
lantern and lighted it; he seized his gun and set out at a run
toward the woods.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Old Daniel Rinearson, standing with his buttocks to the Lattimore
fire, heard the shot and flung back his head as though the bullet
had struck him; on that sly, netted face the dry flash of agony
showed. He clapped both hands together and he groaned and rushed
from the house, Lattimore after him. He ran over the meadow and
into the timber. Lattimore heard him say: "Son&mdash;son," and grow
silent. He stumbled in the dark, he collided with trees, he clawed
his way forward, and now he called at the top of his lungs.
"Whitley&mdash;where are you?" A light danced on the trail ahead
and little by little the shape of men grew around it. Lattimore
said, "Daniel, let me get ahead of you there," and he overtook
Rinearson and tried to catch the older man's arm. Rinearson flung
up his hand and struck Lattimore's fist away. He cried again,
"Whitley!"</p>

<p>He ran faster toward the group standing in the trail. Burnett
held the lantern, swinging it back and forth. The marshal and the
marshal's two men screened the ground until Old Daniel, reaching
them, knocked them aside with his shoulders. He stopped and his
head sank toward Whitley on the earth&mdash;the latter's body lying
loose, face down, one hand tucked beneath his chest, one reaching
outward with the fingers dirtied by the soil he had clawed in a
last moment of pain. His hat was gone, his yellow hair streaked
with mud. There was no bullet hole visible and Daniel, going to his
knees, pulled his son half over, saw the drip of blood and the
vacant face, and let the boy roll back.</p>

<p>"My God&mdash;my God!" The broken wind of his running sawed in
and out of him. He cried, he suffered for air, his skin grew
scarlet, the cruel lantern light glittered on tears running down
his raddled cheeks. "Son what for, what for, oh, my God, what for?
Jesus&mdash;my son, my son!" He bowed his head. Kneeling, he laid
his hand on the boy's body and stroked it. He clenched his teeth
and he shivered from inward cold. His words came out between the
gasps of crying, spaced apart, low and stuttering. "What'll I tell
your mother&mdash;oh, what'll I tell her?"</p>

<p>The marshal's voice was dryly regretful. "Couldn't do nothin'
else. He wouldn't be taken, and I didn't propose to be shot. Young
men, I don't know, they can't be talked to. They don't take it.
We'll move him back to Lattimore's." But Old Daniel didn't hear,
and the group was reluctant to break into his tragedy, and stood in
waiting silence.</p>

<h2><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>Chapter 38</h2>

<p>IN January winter came, the kind of winter they had left behind
them and were lonesome for. Even so, it was a mild thing. The wind
blew steadily from the east, bringing sharper temperatures; thin
ice formed in water-buckets and glittered as a ragged edge in the
slack eddies of the creek. The high mountains grew whiter, the sky
was blue, the sun bright and heatless. By early morning the cattle
stood stiff-legged at barn lot gates, their breath cloudy in the
air. Burnett brought the red hen and the young chicks into the
cabin at night. The earth began to harden and frost dropped more
leaves until all the yellow color in the timber was gone, leaving
only the solid green of the firs. Fern and brambles and weeds
settled to their wilted, gray clumps. All through the settlement
chimneys sent up their continuous spirals of smoke and in this
brittle atmosphere voices carried so far that Mrs. Millard's voice,
a quarter-mile away in her cabin, seemed to announce her in
Burnett's meadow; and lights winked across the dark with sharper
brightness. Toward the end of January the temperature dropped and
thick ice formed and one night the snow began and fell vagrantly
for three days, edging the fir boughs, drifting blue-cast hummocks
against tree trunks, layering the earth with its shallow crust; and
the stillness of this still land grew greater.</p>

<p>Burnett finished the ditch before the ground got too hard to
work. At upper and lower ends he came within four feet of the creek
before quitting&mdash;these sections blocking out the creek until
he built a headgate; when he got that done he dug away the end
sections and let the water through; even at low stage the head of
water dropping from upper creek to lower creek, through the race,
was enough to turn his wheel. He built supports at either side of
the race to hold the wheel; the wheel itself he delayed making
until late spring weather, for it was a large affair to be
constructed a piece at a time on its mountings. Meanwhile he
fashioned his other parts at night in the cabin. For the shaft he
ripsawed a twenty-foot length from an oak tree and dressed it round
with plane, drawknife and rasp, measuring his diameter as he went
along; where the shaft sat on the bearings he nailed in a thick
collar of leather. From two large maple roots he designed his bevel
gears which were to transfer the power of the wheel to the shaft of
the millstone. This was the tedious chore, the contrary grain of
the roots bonding the wood into a marblelike stubbornness. For the
first dressing-down he turned the roots over the fire on a spit,
charring the chunks into working shape.</p>

<p>When the snow came he put aside the mill work and set out to
widen the trail between his place and Lattimore's, and now he knew
road making was harder than he first had imagined, for this timber
was old, much of it twelve feet or more in diameter and stretching
upward beyond two hundred feet; the labor of cutting it was too
much. Wherever he struck such giants he bent around them, hunting
clearer patches, hunting thinner firs. He hired Watt to saw the
fallen trees into lengths short enough to be rolled aside; he made
a tunnel beneath the stumps and started fires, and watched them
die, and started them again, and experimented until he had invented
a system of cross tunnels to create a draft; but it was a slow
thing, for the first heat started the wood's wetness and the whole
top of the stump bubbled and sang. At night he watched these
inflamed eyes gleam through the timber; and at night, too, when he
was unable to endure his own company, he walked to the neighbors to
sit, to smoke, to listen to stories he had heard often before; but
it wasn't the stories that mattered&mdash;it was the closeness, the
sound of voices, the thawing out of solitariness, the strength,
more real than the strength of meat, which these meetings renewed.
It was pretty clear to him then: People were compass needles
pointing to each other. People were meant to touch.</p>

<p>He traveled to Lattimore's, to Provost's, to Mercer's; he found
himself going oftener and oftener to Gay's. The four miles grew
shorter.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Toward the end of the month, Whitcomb came from Oregon City to
pronounce Millard ready to move; and Gay hitched the big wagon for
the first time since the crossing and took him home. The neighbors
made a celebration of it. The roundabout women cleaned the Millard
cabin. Daniel Rinearson slaughtered a cow, a meal was cooked, and
everybody was in the yard to meet the big wagon when it reached the
yard with Nancy Millard and her husband and the Gays. Lot White let
go with a huge "Praise the Lord," and made ready to make a sermon;
but Billy Lord started a song, and the song took hold while Lot
White stood solemnly by and shook his head at this lost
opportunity. He looked from face to face and a settled expression
came to him and he seemed to see them all as from a distance; he
was a stranger looking upon strangers, and he dropped his head and
went into his own thoughts. Nancy Millard came down crying from the
big wagon. Men stood by to help Millard, but nobody offered a hand
and Burnett, observing this unexpected backwardness, found himself
stirred by the comprehension and the pity it implied; each man knew
what a disaster such a thing was in this country, and each man felt
himself in Millard's place and knew what Millard wanted. Millard
wanted to be let alone. He had made himself a crutch. He let
himself over the wheel; he rested his good foot on the wagon's hub,
brought his crutch down, hopped to the ground, and clapped the
crutch under his arm. Supported by crutch and wagon wheel, he
looked to the cabin twenty feet away and let go his grip on the
wagon wheel and made it to the house. He hooked an arm around the
doorframe and turned about, the broadest possible smile on his
face.</p>

<p>"Why, hell," he said, "I got this thing licked."</p>

<p>A great fire burned in the yard. Around it they ate, the weather
sharp and still. Millard sat before it in a chair, the rest of the
men standing or crouched nearby. Old Daniel said, "Never mind your
plowin' this spring. The boys and me will do it."</p>

<p>"No," said Millard. "That's no way for a one-legged man to start
life. I propose to do everything I did before and I propose to do
it as well."</p>

<p>"You got a burden to carry," said Lot. "Lord's will. Bear it
humbly."</p>

<p>"I don't hold with that," said Millard. "I had two legs for
forty-six years. That was fine. Now I got one leg. That will be
fine, too. I'll plow, I'll ride, I'll hunt bear. And that's the end
of it."</p>

<p>With that, he settled the subject, and the talk went to other
things.</p>

<p>The women had drifted to the cabin for its greater warmth, for a
greater freedom to discuss the latest gleanings of gossip. Mrs.
Mercer spoke to Old Daniel's wife. "I hear Edna's going to have a
baby."</p>

<p>"So she says," responded Mrs. Rinearson and looked Mrs. Mercer
squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>There was an interested silence in which every woman did some
counting of the months. Mrs. Mercer said: "She don't show yet,
naturally."</p>

<p>"You've had babies, Netty," said Mrs. Rinearson. "You ought to
know when they start showin'."</p>

<p>"No, she wouldn't show. It'll be, let's see, July, won't
it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Rinearson laughed. "I hope so, Netty." Then she said, "You
hope so too, don't you?" And she went into the yard to find
Rinearson.</p>

<p>Netty Mercer said to the others: "Of course I hope so. Heavens,
what else would I hope?" Afterwards, most casually, she added: "I
ain't seen much of her lately." Mrs. Crosby started to speak,
looked toward Katherine and kept her silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gay said, "Where'd Ralph Whitcomb go? He was to've come
here to eat."</p>

<p>"I saw him start back through the notch," said Mrs. Lord.</p>

<p>"Lucy and George didn't come, either," said Mrs. Provost.
"That's strange for George. He don't miss meetings."</p>

<p>"Him?" said Mrs. Mercer. "The man wants attention so much he'd
take a bath in public if he thought we'd look."</p>

<p>"You think they had words?" asked Mrs. McIver. "George and
Lucy?" The ladies hesitated. They had the thing in their minds and
were eager to speak but were restrained by the need to show some
properness.</p>

<p>"He's so wrapped up in himself he couldn't see anything about
anything," said Mrs. Provost.</p>

<p>That remark took care of the proprieties. "Well," said Mrs.
Kern, "if he don't see what's to be seen there he's blinder than
any man I know. Nobody could be that blind."</p>

<p>"He could," said Mrs. Provost.</p>

<p>"I think he knows but pretends he doesn't. Because if he let on
he knew, he'd have to do something&mdash;and what could he do?"</p>

<p>"Same thing any other man'd do," said Mrs. Mercer.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Mrs. Provost. "Not him." There was agreement
around the group on that; the opinion on Collingwood was almost
unanimous.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Mercer, "what on earth's the matter with
him?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Millard threw up her hands and laughed. "Oh, Lord," she
said, and clapped her hands on her knees; everybody else was
smiling. Even Mrs. Gay showed some humor.</p>

<p>"Poor Ralph," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, poor Lucy, too," put in Mrs. Walker.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mrs. Gay in her hesitating, gentle way,
"it's not a thing to excuse, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's for her to stop," said Mrs. Provost.</p>

<p>That was a challenge to Mrs. Millard's sense of equality. "Oh, I
don't know. It's no more a woman's place to stop it than a man's.
Who starts those things, anyhow? Men."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lord turned her fat and seamless face toward Mrs. Millard.
"What if they didn't?"</p>

<p>"And that's where they've got us at their power," said Mrs.
Millard. "They're sly. They start things we can't stop. We do
things we oughtn't. Then they act innocent. Oh, the creatures."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Gay, "as for those two, the right and wrong is
clear enough. And still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let her put up with what she's got, like any woman's got to
do," said Mrs. Millard. "And let him marry somebody, which he ought
to have done a long time ago."</p>

<p>There was no answer. There was neither agreement nor
disagreement; these ladies sat thoughtful, wrestling with a very
practical matter and finding sympathy and judgment at odds.</p>

<p>Katherine, usually silent among these older women, spoke with
some irritation.</p>

<p>"Is it any of our business?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Millard said at once: "Of course it is. We have to live
together."</p>

<p>"No, what's inside a cabin is not our business. I like Lucy very
much. I'd not care to see anything hurt her."</p>

<p>"In a thing like this," said Mrs. Millard grimly, "she'll hurt
herself more than anybody else will. That's where men have got us.
They can walk away and sing songs about it. We can't."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lord's baby face was cool to Mrs. Millard. "Don't you touch
a hair of my Billy's head&mdash;which is gettin' a little scraggly,
I'll admit&mdash;or I'll come down here and peek through your
window all night long, and what'll you think whose business is
whose business then? Katherine's right."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose she is," said Mrs. Millard. "I always do a lot of
talking. I got to put him to bed. He's been up too long."</p>

<p>The ladies rose and went out to find their men and go home.
Katherine stopped at the cabin's corner, catching Burnett's
attention, drawing him over. "Supper tonight, if you want to
come."</p>

<p>"I'll come."</p>

<p>The break in the day had done him good. He was rested, he had
been well fed; he was alert, chesty, and he was strongly aware of
her. She watched him with her smile.</p>

<p>"You're laughing at me," he said.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not."</p>

<p>He made half a motion to take her arm, remembered the neighbors
around, and checked himself. Her smile quickened. She lifted her
head, eyes closing a little as she held his attention, challenging
him until she saw him lift, until he was half of one thought and
half of another, the rashness growing. He had always been proper
toward her but he wasn't now, not quite. She stood a short time
longer, her manner daring him, and thereafter she said: "Tonight,"
and left him. She was pleased with herself. Edna could have done it
no better.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Millard settled into bed with a windy groan of comfort. "By God,
I'm glad to be back. Good as they've been to us I'm glad to be
here. When'd I sleep here last?"</p>

<p>"Christmas Eve," said Mrs. Millard, and went about the room to
pick it up. There weren't many dishes; the neighbors had brought
and taken away their own. "We've got beef for a couple weeks. You
want to eat it every meal or you want to go sparing?"</p>

<p>"Every meal," he said. "I got to catch up with myself." He put a
hand over his head and lay still.</p>

<p>"It hurt?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Just thinkin'."</p>

<p>She went about her work and it was a good five minutes before
she spoke; and her words were somehow stiff. "Well, I'm glad you're
back, too."</p>

<p>"Had a time of it, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Now, Millard, don't make fun of me, don't make me mad when I
don't want to be. I'm trying to be good&mdash;it's your first night
back here I'd hate it if we said anything. Please."</p>

<p>"All right." He stirred himself around the bed. He moved his
good leg; he tried to move what was left of his other leg. He
flexed the muscles of that leg, but nothing happened; he felt the
muscles stir a little bit and he worked at it&mdash;and then he
remembered that those muscles weren't there. He drew in a long
breath; he let it out quietly. He drew a hand over his face and
shut his eyes and was still. He renewed his effort, thinking of the
muscles which remained above the knee. He felt the stump move
slightly. Inside his head he spoke to the stump. "You
son-of-a-bitch, move." He tried again; he tried several times and
felt some response; then he was exhausted and his face was
cool-damp. He discovered his teeth were gritted together. He
relaxed; he lay still.</p>

<p>"Gay don't look good to me," he said.</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask Martha but she never spoke about it."</p>

<p>"Nobody in the family does. Awful queer. Last few days he's
looked feeble, like it was hard to walk or stand up. Hell, he came
off the wagon here slower than I did."</p>

<p>She said nothing. He listened to her work at the dishes and he
felt&mdash;because he knew her so well&mdash;the storm piling up
within her. He had no notion what caused it but it was there. He
waited; behind the hand over his face he smiled as he waited.</p>

<p>"Millard&mdash;you asleep?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She set a dish on the table with force. She came along the bed
until she was at its foot and could face him. "I can't stand it
much longer, I can't. Roxy's been in my head all day, all week. Who
knows what's happened? She hasn't been back to see her people. She
hasn't visited anybody. She might be dead. I waited today for
somebody to say something about it. I held myself back. I waited,
wondering if anybody cared. Not a word was said, not one word. I
can understand why women might not want to speak of it. Women are
cowards. But you men sat around. You talked about everything. Not a
word about her. If there was a spark of decency in any of you, it'd
be on your minds. You're afraid. You don't want to face that man.
You keep saying, 'It's his wife&mdash;don't interfere&mdash;it's
his wife.' You're afraid, that's the only reason. You'll let her be
beaten and starved, you'll let her be killed because you're afraid.
Oh, God, Millard, I can't bear it any longer."</p>

<p>The dam had burst, the flood poured out. This was the pattern.
He held his hands over his eyes and listened to her words go on and
on in their rhythm of violence; her voice rose higher and the
shrill tone made fluttery vibrations against his eardrums; then
suddenly she broke off and turned to her work.</p>

<p>"You through?" he said.</p>

<p>"I mean it, Millard," she said. "I think I have got to do
something or go crazy."</p>

<p>"She'll be down for a visit pretty soon. Then you'll not worry.
It'll work out."</p>

<p>"It'll work out&mdash;it'll work out," she mimicked. "Always
that. That's men."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "we're home again."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
On that afternoon Lorenzo Buck and his wife walked wordlessly home
in the beginning twilight and separated at the cabin, she to go to
her work inside and he to milk, to look after the stock, to do the
little chores. When they were done he circled the place, using his
eyes to see what strange or unusual things might be seen; for on
the way home from Millard's he had noted a wolf track in the thin
snow, larger than any dog's. It was dark when he went into the
cabin. His wife had made coffee and they had their small meal,
bread and coffee with butter. The children were with the Ebbetts
and would remain there for the night. He shook the fire together
and filled his pipe, and stood in the room's center, speculating on
the amount of tobacco he had left and how long it would last him.
His wife had settled to knitting; now and then, with careful
indirection, he watched her. He walked to the door and opened it,
appreciating the path of moonlight running across the snow. Through
the trees he made out the smallest wink of Monteith's place nearer
the creek. He cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Everything all right?"</p>

<p>Having no answer, he turned about and found her looking toward
him, hands lying over the knitting. She said: "You been thinking
about something, Lorenzo?"</p>

<p>"Just wondered if everything's all right."</p>

<p>"I'm not worried about food. We'll need a deer or two, and I
shall have to be careful about wheat. But we'll make out."</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "we'll make out. That don't trouble me."</p>

<p>He returned to the fire, pipe thrust straight out, lips drawn
back; he rocked idly on his heels, he put his hands behind him. The
firelight gave to his mild face a shine of benevolence but his eyes
were thoughtful. He waited quite a while before speaking again.</p>

<p>"You're satisfied?"</p>

<p>She smoothed the piece of knitting against her knee, she watched
her hand. "We've got as good a cabin as anybody. The land's
good&mdash;I like to look out and just see Monteith's smoke over
the trees, not too far, not too near. It's not a lonely place." She
seemed to be thinking of something else to say, but at last resumed
her work.</p>

<p>His head dropped lower, he stared steadily into the fire. "You
miss some things though, I suppose."</p>

<p>"In a strange country, that's to be expected. I'm not
complaining."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, still watching the fire, "I just wondered if
everything was all right." He removed his pipe, tapped it against
the fireplace stones and held it in his hard hand.</p>

<p>"We'll make out," she said.</p>

<p>He made a short nod. "That's right," he said and added, "Believe
I'll turn in. Tomorrow I'm goin' to work on the road." He left the
cabin and made one more circle around the place, and came back.
After he had gone to bed he settled himself on his side, facing the
wall, back to his wife. She abandoned her knitting and sat watching
him, the pleasantness of her face fading. He wasn't asleep, she
knew, for his hand lay finger-spraddled over his head. He was a
considerate, methodical, stubborn little man. He wasn't at all like
her other husband.</p>

<p>Now that was queer, that was sorrowful. It was barely four
months and it was still hard to think of Harper Howard not alive.
Sometimes when people spoke to her and said "Mrs. Buck," she had to
stop and remember that she was the one they meant&mdash;she was
Mrs. Buck, not Mrs. Howard any more. He was a nice man, Lorenzo.
When would the strangeness die? When this quiet way came on him and
he began to ask her questions in soft persistence, she knew it hurt
his feelings to realize she wasn't toward him the way she had been
toward Howard. He had a sentimental streak.</p>

<p>They all had it. Howard had it, but Howard was different; it was
all right to say foolish words and carry on with him, because it
had started when they were both young. It wasn't right with Buck;
she was an old woman, he was an old man. It embarrassed her. They
had need for each other, and that was all right; but it wasn't
decent to talk about it or fuss over it. He wanted to say words
with it which she couldn't say, couldn't ever say again. There was
a time; then the time went, and it didn't come back. She watched
the fire a long while.</p>

<h2><a name="ch39" id="ch39"></a>Chapter 39</h2>

<p>AFTER the meeting with Whitcomb, Lucy was nicer than usual to
her husband. The strain of waiting for Whitcomb to gather courage
and the endless back-and-forth argument in her own mind was over.
The act had been committed, the doubts were no longer important.
She had never felt so well, so happy or so important. She had to
restrain her cheerfulness, for she could never be certain of George
Collingwood's perceptions. Sometimes she was sure that, wrapped
around so tightly by his own interests, he saw nothing; at other
times she suspected his manner to be a screen through which he
watched her most closely. But in her happiness was a pity for him.
Knowing loneliness herself so well, she thought there were times
when he too must suffer from it; and this made her kind. She talked
more to him, though this was difficult. His reticence, so long
developed, was hard to break through. Now and then, in this mood,
she noticed that he watched her as though he were puzzled.
Once&mdash;once only during the succeeding days of the
month&mdash;she was unexpectedly taken aback by the idea that
perhaps it was still possible for them to break the barrier and
come together again as they had in their earliest days of marriage.
That was her bad day. George had gone off on one of his
increasingly frequent overnight trips to visit some settler he
hadn't met before; she walked around the cabin, she slipped on her
shawl and tramped the trail; she lay in bed, thinking about it. But
she knew it was no good. The thought that it might be
possible&mdash;that it might at least be the thing she ought to try
to do&mdash;gave her a dark and dreadful feeling and then she knew
she no longer wanted to go emotionally back to George. She had made
the crossover from one man to another; there was no way of
returning.</p>

<p>But if her doubt was gone, possessiveness took its place and
supplied its own kind of misery. After Whitcomb's departure she
stood in the doorway at some moment in each day to make a ceremony
of remembering how he had turned at the edge of the timber to wave
good-by; and each day she rehearsed the moments preceding the kiss,
and the intenseness of her longing as he stood indecisive between
his desire and his judgment, and the desperateness which had come
into her when she thought he meant to give up and go away; that was
when she had spoken of her loneliness. No, she corrected herself,
it wasn't desire and judgment which had deadlocked him; it was
desire against a lack of confidence in himself. He had passed the
youthful egotism which felt itself irresistible and he had an older
man's acute fear of making himself appear ridiculous. That had been
a hard thing for her to bring him through.</p>

<p>On his second visit, almost a month later, she saw him for only
a moment. George had been home and Whitcomb, pausing at the cabin,
spoke a pleasant word to both of them and went on. He played his
part very well, she thought. Almost too well&mdash;for the
casualness of his manner sent its splinter of fear through her.
Could he have changed his mind? She soon rid herself of the notion
but the rest of the day was bad. Sight of him intensified her
impatience to be with him, the month behind had dragged
interminably, the months ahead grew longer and longer. They had so
little, they could expect so little; each lost opportunity was
tragic. In this state of mind she once more felt her life slipping
by and her body drowned in its stopped-up wants; she had the
greatest difficulty making herself cheerful for George on that
day.</p>

<p>He had long since begun a list of every settler south of Oregon
City, on both sides of the Willamette. He was, in the matter of
names, an industrious packrat, returning from each trip with new
names which he added to the list in his elegant handwriting. He was
very proud of his handwriting; he was most serious about the list.
In some manner, he had made a picture of himself in public life,
and it seemed to fill some need in him as nothing else had done;
and in his quiet, obscure and tenacious fashion he went after what
he wanted, putting on his two suits of appearance for the two sides
of his life. Among people it was the affable, courteous,
straining-to-please suit; at home he sat in the dark shawl of his
ambitions, poring over the lists, dreaming his dream, mysterious,
intent, listening to the whisper of fame.</p>

<p>After supper that day he brought up the thing she had not dared
mention, though she had in a dozen ways tried to lead him to it by
indirection.</p>

<p>"I'll do a week's road work, starting tomorrow. Provost has got
some neighbors for it and we'll grade Lord's notch. Then next week
I'd like to go to Oregon City." He was diffident. "I thought that
maybe you'd like to make the trip."</p>

<p>She said, "I don't know&mdash;I don't know what I'd do
there."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a change. We'll put up at the hotel. I want to go
across the river into the Tualatin for a couple days but you'd not
be lonely waiting. We've got a few dollars you can spend for
things."</p>

<p>She let the silence go on a short time, and said: "I'll go.
When?"</p>

<p>"Week from tomorrow. We'll be gone four-five days. Joe Gay will
look after the stock."</p>

<p>Afterward she had the feeling&mdash;as the lightest breath of
air across her face&mdash;that behind his mild glance was a
knowledge of what was in her mind. Was it real or had her
conscience begun to create its illusions?</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Two weeks after Millard returned home John Gay finished his night's
chores and came in for supper. He struck his foot against the
doorsill, stumbled, and flung both arms around the casing to
support himself. All members of the family were in the room and saw
it but nobody said anything. He didn't look at them. He recovered
his balance and let his shoulder touch the casing a little while,
for he was unusually weary and his breath ran fast. Katherine came
over and put her arm around him.</p>

<p>"Supper will warm you."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "that's it. Supper's what I want."</p>

<p>He ate little, drank a good deal of coffee, and sat by the
fireplace until the dishes were done. Young Joe slipped away to his
night's spooking through the timber; the old couple went to the
wagon. Katherine left the cabin long enough for her father to get
into bed and then returned. Her mother had drawn a chair beside the
bed and sat there with her sewing, saying nothing and pretending to
see nothing; in time of trouble it was Martha Gay's inclination to
grow confused and silent.</p>

<p>Gay spoke to his daughter. "I was telling your mother that I'm a
little run down and I think I'll stay in bed a few days and rest
up."</p>

<p>"Lord knows you got it comin' to you," said Mrs. Gay. She
thought of something and laid her work aside. "I didn't shut in
those geese," she said and left the room.</p>

<p>Katherine settled on the bed's edge. She took her father's hand.
"I'll have Rice go to Oregon City for Dr. Whitcomb."</p>

<p>"That will do no good. I saw him when he was here. Don't tell
your mother. It's something he can't find. I wanted to hold this
off a little longer but it got hard work stayin' on my feet." He
was pale, he was old.</p>

<p>Though not an austere man he had always kept his emotions under
control and it was physical weakness now that brought a glistening
dampness to his eyes. "Awful lot of men have got children that
cause 'em worry. Like Whit, like Edna, or Roxy, or Provost's oldest
boy. Neither you nor Joe ever caused us a minute of trouble. You're
going to be all right, both smart and steady."</p>

<p>She bent to kiss the top of his head, to smooth his
pillow-ruffled hair. "Oh," she said, "I don't know. There was some
trouble. Remember when I fell in love with Harvey Crockett? What
was I&mdash;twelve, I guess."</p>

<p>A smile appeared in his eyes. "That takes me back."</p>

<p>"Mother was worried. You weren't. I was mad at you because you
laughed at me. Harvey and I planned to run away. Did I ever tell
you that?"</p>

<p>"Didn't tell me but I knew it at the time."</p>

<p>"We were awfully sly about it. How did you find out?"</p>

<p>"Harvey's father said he'd found a blanket roll wrapped in the
barn. Harvey had got it ready. There was a pound of bacon in the
blanket roll, an old pistol, some coffee, couple tin plates and
cups, and hickory nuts. So I came home and looked around and
discovered you'd wrapped some stuff and had it under your bed.
Can't recall what all you'd wrapped together. Where'd you and
Harvey plan to go?"</p>

<p>"We were going to walk beyond Lee's Bridge, I don't just know
where, but Harvey said he knew he could get a farmer to rent him a
piece of land and a cabin, and we'd go to housekeeping on
that."</p>

<p>"Well, Harvey's father kept an eye on him, didn't say anything.
I never mentioned it either and it petered out. Always wondered
what happened."</p>

<p>She said: "One day we got to talking and I asked him how old he
was, and he told me, and I discovered he was three weeks younger
than I. It was such a shock. I just didn't love him any more and
the whole thing died. So you knew about it?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Maybe you didn't know everything about it," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment. "You got to remember there was a time
when I was twelve, too."</p>

<p>"Is it always the same, at twelve?"</p>

<p>"Just about. Some people, when they get through it and get
older, regret what they did. That's a foolish thing. Twelve's
twelve. It's wrong to use the knowledge you got at one stage of
life to judge what you did earlier. Anyhow, twelve's a fine time,
mistakes and all. If I went back I'd be glad to make the same
mistakes again."</p>

<p>"I wonder where Harvey is now?"</p>

<p>"Memories," he said. "Sweet as sugar, strong as vinegar.
People&mdash;people are mostly afraid. They hold back their hands
and never touch the apple, and spend the rest of the time wishing
they had. What's the use of digging a well if it don't fill with
water?" He was silent, turning gently on the bed as pain got at
him; he laid a hand over his eyes. "That Edna girl, you think she's
still in Rice's system?"</p>

<p>"How'd you know that?"</p>

<p>"Had a few women in my blood at one time or another. You'd not
think, I suppose, somebody's mother warned me to stay away from her
girl or get buckshotted."</p>

<p>"Weren't you serious about the girl?"</p>

<p>"I did my running around and I was serious each time. That's
what I want to tell you. About a man&mdash;about Rice. It's
possible for him to love a second woman as much as he thought he
loved the first. He will have some sentiment about the first one,
but that's another thing."</p>

<p>"I know that," said Katherine. "But something's got to happen
before the change is any good. He's got to know the first one
wasn't what he wanted."</p>

<p>"That will take care of itself," said her father.</p>

<p>"You don't know Rice."</p>

<p>"Rice or any man, that will take care of itself."</p>

<p>She shook her head; she was silent for a short time. Then she
said, "Why didn't he take her? I wonder what it was."</p>

<p>"You're not apt to find out, for he don't know. No man's got
reasons about a woman; all he knows is what she does to him and how
she makes him feel. A man's a peculiar thing. By himself he's got
no more shape or purpose than a cloud of dust blown over the
desert. He's nothing but a dream of something that might be until
he looks at a woman, and then he sees himself and knows what he is
and turns real. If it's not one woman to show him, he'll go on till
he finds another, for the whole thing's beyond his power to
stop."</p>

<p>She turned to look closely at him. He had not talked to her in
such a manner before. All her life she had been certain of him; he
was the familiar rock of her childhood and girlhood, the one
motionless, unchanged landmark in the changing years. Now he was a
kind stranger watching her. She wanted to cry; she lowered her head
to kiss him and lay with her cheek along his hair.</p>

<p>"It won't be Harris, will it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't think so, but I don't know. If it has to
be, it will be. You know we can't choose things as we'd best like
to."</p>

<p>"Muff..." he said. It was a name he had used on her long ago,
and had put away. "Muff, don't think about that. Not for a while.
Let this work out. Practical's practical, but I want it better for
you. I don't say Harris won't do well. Fine man there. But that's
another thing. Don't you get impatient. You have got a long way to
go and it's best to try for a good start. Talk to your grandmother.
She knows more than the lot of us put together."</p>

<p>"It would please you to see me settled," she said.</p>

<p>"It'll work out," he said. "Keep it in your mind&mdash;that it
will work out. Good and bad are neck-and-neck in the world but I
have always believed the thinking of good will produce it more
times than not. People draw things to them by their thoughts.
Nothing so strong as the pull of a thought. Someday we'll know more
about that." Martha Gay's voice said, "Shoo-shoo," in the yard. Gay
lowered his voice. "I will not get off this bed again, but don't
tell your mother."</p>

<p>She said, "You're mistaken." But her grandmother's strain of
dark-earth mystery was in her, and the touch of her father was
cold. She lay still, her head against his head.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Hawn came down to Burnett's quite early one morning and squatted by
the fire while Burnett cooked his meal. He shook his head at
Burnett's invitation to eat. "Had mine," he said and fell into long
silence. Burnett made no attempt to break into it; he had finished
eating when Hawn made a short one-fingered gesture across the air.
"Well, it's through. She left. In the middle of the night. I was
sleepin'. Crawled over me&mdash;didn't wake me&mdash;it's a trick
she had, I don't know how. She's straight Indian now and a quarter
way back to her own folks."</p>

<p>"How far they live?"</p>

<p>"Hundred miles."</p>

<p>"When you going after her?"</p>

<p>"No good. When she left me, she left a man she don't want any
more. If I went after her I'd be lowerin' myself still more in her
eyes. I could bring her back but it wouldn't be Louisa. It'd be a
squaw crouched in the corner watchin' me like an animal on a
chain."</p>

<p>Burnett squatted on the opposite side of the fireplace. Hawn's
face was the face of a man looking down the sights of a rifle. "She
was like that," he said. "No argument, and nothin' half way. One
day she'd stuck a knife in anybody for me. Next day I wasn't worth
it. I don't know much about white women, only knew two. But they're
not like that. They can be anything, you never know how much or how
little. Maybe God made 'em to be more things than an Indian girl.
But when he did it he took out of them the strength to be one thing
bigger than anything."</p>

<p>"What was wrong?"</p>

<p>"Me," said Bob Hawn. "When you people came I sort of let myself
think I was a white man again and I looked at white girls and I got
a little bit sad. The minute it got in my head Louisa knew it." He
rose. He said, "By God, I'll miss her."</p>

<p>"Go try."</p>

<p>Hawn shook his head. "She won't come back, but I'll wait a
month. Then I'm goin' to burn down the cabin and pull out." He
moved to the door and watched the meadow. "It'll do me no good now.
I was a squaw man and white people didn't want me. I'm no squaw man
now but I was once and the smell's on me and they'll still not want
me."</p>

<p>"Well, what the hell do you want to be, one thing or the
other?"</p>

<p>"That's it," said Hawn quietly. "I'm nothing. I'm halfway
between and I'm spoiled for either."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Burnett turned his back to Hawn to put away the dishes; when he
swung around Hawn was gone.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Mrs. Millard banked the fire, set teapot and cup and bread and
butter on the table for Millard and laid her cloak about her
shoulders. "Just going to Lattimore's," she said. "It won't be long
unless she gets to talkin' too much." She crossed the meadow in a
direct line to Lattimore's but when she got to the edge of the
creek she followed it until Burnett's came into sight. Here she
slid into the screen of alders and went by his place; farther up
she crossed the creek, passed Hawn's and eventually reached
Lockyear's meadow. Along the way she noticed a yard-long chunk of a
fir limb which fitted into her hand and this she took as a weapon,
more and more concerned with Roxy's safety; the most brutal
possibilities worked in her fertile mind and gradually she worked
herself into half a trot, half a walk, growing angrier as she
advanced on the cabin.</p>

<p>Cal Lockyear was at the doorway</p>

<p>She said: "Where's Roxy?"</p>

<p>He looked at her with his sultry disposition showing. "What the
hell you doin' up here?"</p>

<p>She started to move by him into the house; his arm struck across
the doorway, grazing her face and checking her. "I didn't ask you
in," he said. "Go mind your business."</p>

<p>She saw Roxy in the room's corner and in these shadowy quarters
Roxy's face was obscure, but Mrs. Millard thought she saw bruises
and she took a step backward, raised the club with unexpected
quickness and brought the end of it across Lockyear's jaw. His
hands came up; he lunged forward to catch the stick and missed it
and she had the opportunity to jab its point into his chest, and
again into his face before his reaching arm seized the stick,
twisted it from her hand and flung it aside. Boots came beating
around the cabin and Veen Lockyear's voice called, "What in hell's
the matter?" Mrs. Millard, blindly furious, flung herself at
Lockyear. She gave him a full raking with her nails, she slapped
him, she knocked off his hat, she made a grab for his ear. He got
her around the waist, pinning her arms, and he let go with one hand
and hit her three times with his full palm on the side of her head.
"You God-damned meddlesome witch! You're a woman, why don't you
stay a woman? You don't want to be a woman, I'll treat you like a
man!" She tried to bite his arm. He hit her again, harder than
before, bringing blood to her nose. She hung on but she had a
fainting feeling and she was only half aware of Veen Lockyear
driving himself between. She fell backward to the ground. "Oh, my
dress," she thought and got up and found Veen struggling against
his brother.</p>

<p>Veen called at her. "Go on, get out of here."</p>

<p>"Roxy!" cried Mrs. Millard and rushed for the cabin's door.
Lockyear broke away from his brother, reached her, and struck her
in the chest, sending her to the ground. He said, "Where's the
club, you female bastard, I'll give you a taste of it!" He stooped
for the club but Veen kicked it aside and closed with his brother
again and hung on as the larger man flung him around. Veen yelled,
"For Christ's sake, woman, get out of here or get killed! He'll use
a gun."</p>

<p>"I don't care. Roxy!"</p>

<p>Cal Lockyear said, "I'll give you just about a minute to move
out of my sight, woman, or I'll take you and Roxy and strangle you
both in the creek."</p>

<p>Veen said, "He'll do it too. Now you go. Quick."</p>

<p>Mrs. Millard began to cry. She was defeated, she was sad, she
was bitter and outraged. Half blinded she turned away, fearing for
Roxy more than for herself. In the trees, beyond Lockyear's, she
halted and put her head against a fir trunk and let herself go, and
was exhausted when she had finished. Then she went on. Before she
came into her own meadow she looked at her clothes and she tucked
back the shaken pieces of her hair; and she made a show of
cheerfulness on entering the cabin.</p>

<p>Millard had his eyes closed and he seemed asleep. She tiptoed by
him, thankful for the opportunity; but suddenly he said: "How was
your visit?" He was on his back, looking to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was nice, you know Nellie Lattimore, she talks."</p>

<p>"She does," said Millard. "She was here while you was gone, and
she talked." He turned his head and gave her a long look. "Where'd
you go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Millard..."</p>

<p>His voice rolled against her. "Where'd you go? What's the matter
with your clothes? What's your face red for? You go to
Lockyear's?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to see Roxy. I wanted to know. I had to know."</p>

<p>"He hit you?"</p>

<p>She looked at him, she said nothing. Millard rolled on the bed,
got his good foot and his stump over the edge, and sat straight.
"So you did it."</p>

<p>"I couldn't bear wondering about Roxy. Millard, I couldn't bear
it any longer."</p>

<p>"You interfered and he hit you."</p>

<p>"He'll remember me," she said. "I left my mark on him."</p>

<p>"Here I am," he said, "a man with one leg, and he hit you, and I
can do nothing about it."</p>

<p>"Nothing for you to do anything about anyhow," she said. "Not a
thing. He's been beating her, I know. I'll never rest..."</p>

<p>He looked up to her with an expression that stopped her talk. He
said: "You know I've got to take care of that, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort. I don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Soon as I get out of this bed and walking, I'll have to go kill
the man."</p>

<p>"Millard! Don't ever think of it! What would you do against a
man like that?"</p>

<p>"When will you learn," he said gently&mdash;"When will you
learn?"</p>

<p>"I'll not have you thinking such a thing."</p>

<p>"Don't ever speak to me again about it," he said. "I have got to
do it."</p>

<p>She stared at him and meant to argue, but he watched her with a
coldness she had not received from him before and of a sudden she
walked by him into the yard and began to cry again.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch40" id="ch40"></a>Chapter 40</h2>

<p>LOCKYEAR watched Mrs. Millard disappear in the trees. He became
conscious of the stinging tracks of her fingernails on his face and
he drew a hand over his cheeks and found blood on it and for a
moment he swayed forward with a notion to go after the woman. Then
his glance touched Veen close by and his impulse was diverted. With
no warning, he raised an arm and punched his knuckles flat into his
brother's mouth, driving the smaller man to the earth.</p>

<p>"Don't ever interfere with me again," he said and stepped into
the cabin.</p>

<p>Roxy hadn't stirred from her position in the corner. She said
nothing, she watched him with a sly and timid attention, her eyes
following him. He wheeled about, his words jumped at her. "That
time you ran off that got people thinking about you and me." He
moved toward her, witnessing the stiffening of her body, the recoil
from him. "Christ," he murmured. "You pull away. A crazy fool,
uglier than any damned dog I ever saw. You pull away. Nobody'd look
at you, no other man in this country. Nobody wants you but you
don't want me touchin' you." His glance was a hot iron prodding
her. It gave him pleasure to see fear break her face with its
spongelike contractions. "I ought to tie you to a tree somewhere up
in the timber and let you rot there. By God I ought to." He laid
his hand on her shoulder and felt her shiver beneath its weight.
"Don't do that to me," he said sharply. He crossed the room to the
doorway and spoke to Veen standing in the yard. "Don't come in
here," he said and shut the door.</p>

<p>Veen said nothing. He crouched on the dirt. He heard Roxy make a
short sound and he heard his brother's words rap at her. They were
struggling. She said "No," and said it again several times in a
small and desperate tone. She struck the cabin wall and cried out;
then Veen heard her drop on the bunk. He rose and walked to the
creek, the sound of the water covering the sounds from the house.
He settled on his haunches, throwing rock after rock into the
water. It was a quarter hour before Cal emerged with his rifle,
went to the shed for his horse and rode beside Veen. The smaller
man could always recognize the deviltry his brother had committed
by the shifting brightness in the latter's eyes; it was there
now.</p>

<p>Cal said: "If she had as much sense as an animal, I could train
her. The hell with her. You want her, you can have her. I don't
want her any more."</p>

<p>"Send her home then," said Veen, watching the creek.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Veen continued to watch the creek. Cal said, in a slightly more
reasonable tone, "You oughtn't to have monkeyed with me. It's your
own fault I had to knock you down. You know better than try to get
me not to do something."</p>

<p>Veen said nothing.</p>

<p>"You can go to hell," said Cal. "I don't beg anybody's favors,
and not from a cripple like you. You go sulkin' around on me and
you can get out of my way." He turned and drove the horse across
the meadow and into the trees.</p>

<p>Veen rose and went into the cabin. Roxy lay under a blanket on
the bed; her clothes were a heap of torn rags on the floor. She
rolled her head to look at Veen. He settled on the edge of the
bunk. "Too bad," he said. "Too bad."</p>

<p>"He's my husband," she said. "I can't do nothin'."</p>

<p>"Why don't you run off&mdash;go back home?"</p>

<p>"He'd come and get me."</p>

<p>"He's crazy, gettin' crazier. He ain't got any more pity in him
than a snake. He's my brother, but God, I hope someday he pays for
all the things he's done. I sure hope so."</p>

<p>"I got to stay," she said. "I can't go anywhere. He's my
husband. I got to stand it, I guess." One arm came up, slid around
his neck and pulled him down. She said, "Don't you go away. You got
to stay here, if I got to stay here."</p>

<p>"All right, Roxy. All right."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Lockyear forded the creek and bucked his way through brush and
thick timber, thus avoiding Hawn's and Burnett's. He crossed the
low ridge behind Millard's, skirting Walker's, Purroy's, and
Kitchen's. He was unusually crafty this day and when he came to the
break of timber and looked into the small valley occupied by the
Rinearsons he had not been observed by anybody. The cabin farthest
removed from him, half a mile tant, was Old Daniel's; the one
nearest at hand, sitting directly ahead of him, belonged to Ared.
Between this place and Old Daniel's, its back crowded against the
firs and its front facing the long narrow meadows of the valley,
stood Moss Rinearson's cabin. Edna was at the moment busy by a fire
in the back yard, stirring something in a big iron kettle. Across
the meadow from this cabin, a quarter mile from it, the three
Rinearsons were slashing a road between the valley's upper and
lower meadows. Hanging well back in the firs, Lockyear advanced
until he was behind Moss Rinearson's place, left his horse and
crept forward to a tree at the edge of the yard and here settled in
the thicket to watch Edna fifty feet away.</p>

<p>Clothes boiled in the kettle. Edna churned them with a stick,
arms and shoulders swaying in rhythm, mind obviously far from the
chore; her face was stolid with her thoughts and now and then she
lifted her head to throw a glance into the meadow and at times the
fire's turning smoke rose around her and she stepped back to catch
her breath; steam from the kettle dampened and loosened her hair
and she made impatient jabs at it with her hand.</p>

<p>He said: "Don't be bothered about lookin' pretty."</p>

<p>She didn't start at the unexpected voice; she made a slow turn
and saw him and almost immediately she swung her head to look
across the meadow at three Rinearsons. "Always spyin'," she said,
and resumed her work. The stick went around and around in the
kettle.</p>

<p>"Like to make men miserable, don't you?" he said.</p>

<p>"Not you," she said.</p>

<p>She stared at the boiling clothes; she turned the stick. Her
voice was slow and curious. "What'd you marry Roxy for?"</p>

<p>"To have a woman. What'd you marry Moss for?"</p>

<p>"Because."</p>

<p>"He ain't enough," said Lockyear. "He'll never be enough. He's a
man you can lead around like you want. That's why you married him.
You'll get sick of that."</p>

<p>"You better go."</p>

<p>"Come over here," he said.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You're afraid."</p>

<p>"What'd you come this way for?"</p>

<p>"To see you."</p>

<p>She ceased to turn the stick. She stood motionless, she grew
solemn. "Why couldn't you be a good man?" she said.</p>

<p>"What the hell for?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "why couldn't you have been?" She looked over
the meadow again at the Rinearsons and she turned and walked to the
tree. He caught her arm and drew her on, his expression unsteady
and violent. "No," she said. "No." She hung back but her resistance
was half-hearted. He drew her deeper into the timber. She said:
"No, leave me alone." He stopped and put his arms around her and
his accumulated impatience made him jerk her forward. Her head
bobbed back. She stared at him, her face loose and shaded, an odd
numbness on it. She turned her head from side to side. He gave her
a rough shaking, slid a hand behind her head and hauled it hard
against his face; he wheeled her around as he kissed her, he
gripped her hair, he squeezed her head between his hands. He said,
half incoherent, "Pale&mdash;weak&mdash;you're not that! Give it to
me, come back to me! God damn it, you want me or you wouldn't have
come. I want you! Give it to me, slam into me, let it come out,
it's there!" Suddenly he turned and, with his arm around her waist,
half walked and half ran deeper into the trees.</p>

<p>"No," she said, and fought at his encircling arm. "No, I'm going
back."</p>

<p>"It's got to be," he said. He pushed her through the brush, he
halted and looked about him and he gave her a quick shove; as she
fell, he fell with her. She lay still, watching him; her mouth was
slack, the numb, obscure expression more and more pronounced. She
closed her eyes, rolling her head back and forth on the wet earth;
she groaned, she opened her eyes and looked at him. "I can't help
it," she whispered. Her mouth widened in a grimace resembling pain,
she flung her arms about him and brought him flat over her.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Moss's voice rang sharp through the trees. Edna gave Lockyear a
push, knocked him aside and sprang to her feet. She looked around,
caught Lockyear's arm when he got up and shoved him toward the
horse. She made a signal at him to move on, then she thought of her
clothes and swung her skirt and found the green-stained muddiness
on it and she made another gesture at Lockyear and watched him lead
the horse quietly on through the timber. Moss's voice rose again,
but she stood still until Lockyear had gotten beyond sight;
afterwards she brought her fingers down through her hair to
disarrange it and took a bit of dirt from the ground and smeared it
over her face. She drew a deep breath, let out a scream and rushed
through the brush into the clearing, straight at Moss and into his
arms. Old Daniel and Ared, still at the far side of the meadow, ran
forward at the sound of her voice.</p>

<p>"It was an Indian," she said to Moss. "He knocked me down. He
almost did it, but I screamed and he jumped up and ran away."</p>

<p>Moss ran into the house for his gun. When he came out with it
she stopped him. "Don't you do it. He had a gun, too. He'd kill
you. I think there's some more in the brush."</p>

<p>"We'll get in the cabin," said Moss and pushed her before him.
He stood at the rear doorway, gun lifted on the brush. Old Daniel
yelled, "What's up there&mdash;what's up?" He ran over the grass
and came hard-breathing into the cabin, Ared behind him. "What the
hell is it?"</p>

<p>"She was on the edge of the timber and a buck grabbed her and
threw her down," said Moss. "She screamed, scared him off."</p>

<p>Both the other men had their guns in the cabin. Old Daniel
seized his weapon, swearing. "Well, by God, we'll fix that."</p>

<p>"No," said Edna, "don't you do it. I think there's more than
one."</p>

<p>"How you know?" demanded Old Daniel.</p>

<p>"I heard a lot of bushes wiggle," she said. "I heard some
grunting." Moss said: "You sure he didn't do anything to you?"</p>

<p>"I screamed too soon."</p>

<p>Old Daniel said, "We'll go to my place. We'll send out word to
everybody and have a meeting. It's time we got this worry off our
backs. We'll make up a company and go up where they live and clean
'em out. Come on quick."</p>

<p>They left the cabin and went rapidly over the meadow and had
gone a hundred feet or so when Edna said: "My washing," and
stopped.</p>

<p>Old Daniel looked at her. "For the love of God, girl," he said
and caught her arm and hurried on. Two or three minutes later he
turned his head to give her a glance in which a great deal of
curiosity lay. They continued forward as fast as they could travel,
Moss looking behind every few steps.</p>

<h2><a name="ch41" id="ch41"></a>Chapter 41</h2>

<p>THE news spread from one cabin to another in the course of two
hours and by late afternoon all the men of the settlement were on
their way to Old Daniel's place.</p>

<p>Lattimore relayed the information to Burnett. "It's war," said
Lattimore, "that's what it is." He was excited. "Maybe they're out
in the brush now, ready to sweep through&mdash;kill and burn, kill
and burn. Maybe we're too late. Jesus, I think we ought to've wiped
'em out long ago." He was apprehensive and as the two rode the
timber-bordered trail toward Rinearson's he humped himself on the
saddle as though expecting a shot from the brush at any moment.</p>

<p>Everybody had gathered in Rinearson's yard by the time Lattimore
and Burnett reached the place. The attack on Edna, and the earlier
pilferage in Mrs. Ebbett's house, had at last hardened discontent
into anger, Burnett saw, and anger had passed to purpose without a
great deal of discussion. With this also was a changing of the
quality of their fear; to this point they had not deeply believed
they were in danger of a general attack from the Molalas; under the
stimulus of excitement they began to believe it and looked toward
the near hills with their imaginations creating a vision of shabby
warriors erupting from the trees. Gathered in a loose semicircle
before Old Daniel's house, the settlers discussed the situation
back and forth and gradually talked themselves into a frame of
mind. For once in his career George Collingwood caught public
temper clearly, made a ringing, resolute speech and received
general approval. To Burnett's notion that agreement with a man
they regarded poorly showed how far they had gone. He stood silent,
closely listening; he observed Edna occasionally appear in the
doorway to look on. She met his glance and seemed to wish to talk
to him, but he stayed where he was.</p>

<p>Old Daniel said: "We ought to organize a volunteer company."</p>

<p>"Why," said Mercer, "it's scarcely necessary. Let us just pick
up our guns and go up there."</p>

<p>"No," said Old Daniel, "this free-for-all skirmishin' don't tend
for good results."</p>

<p>He had sentiment with him. They understood organization, civil
or military; it satisfied their notion of doing things. Provost
said, "We'll need a captain. I nominate Daniel."</p>

<p>Old Daniel said agreeably, "I don't mind, boys, if that's what
you want, but don't do it just because I called the meetin'. I'll
serve one way or another."</p>

<p>The nomination evoked some favorable response; it ran into
silence elsewhere. Old Daniel's son was dead and it was his
daughter-in-law who had been attacked. That gave him some support.
But Old Daniel was a wealthy man, a close and arguing man who had
showed nobody any generosity with his beef when the need was on the
settlers; and that was against him. Election time of any sort
brought out the independence of these people; their equality was a
hard thing. Billy Lord let his glance roll around the crowd.
"Hell," he said, "the only man here that knows Indians or ever
fought 'em is Rice. I put him up for captain."</p>

<p>Old Daniel's voice was quick to break in, much tarter than it
had been. "I didn't ask to be captain and I don't know as I care to
run against anybody. I ain't goin' to stand around here and have my
teeth examined to see if I can bite an Indian better'n Rice."</p>

<p>Rice said: "Withdraw the thing, Billy. I'm not in favor of a
battle."</p>

<p>"What's that?" challenged Old Daniel. "You want us to stand by
and let this happen some more? You want women to be ruined, you
want people to be killed? Now, then, Rice, what's wrong with
you?"</p>

<p>"You've got thirty or forty Molala men up in the brush. They
feel bad we're here. In their shoes we would too."</p>

<p>"That's no good for an argument," broke in Lattimore. "We ain't
botherin' them. They're comin' down after us. It's no good."</p>

<p>"If a man does something to me," said Rice, "I go after the man.
I don't shoot the hell out of the settlement he lives in. Get your
company and go after the bucks that did this. Don't attack a whole
village."</p>

<p>He had little support. Several men shook their heads at him and
McIver said: "Now, Rice, how you goin' to sort out one or two
Indians from fifty Indians? They all look alike to me. Anyhow, if
two&mdash;three would do it they'd all do it. They're all the
same."</p>

<p>"It makes no difference to you whether you shoot the right
Indians or not, so long as you shoot two&mdash;three Indians?"</p>

<p>McIver answered indirectly. "I ain't tender about Indians and
I'm surprised you are."</p>

<p>Provost said, in a more persuasive manner, "We got to scare 'em,
Rice, or they'll keep pickin' at us. They'll think we're afraid,
then they'll get hold and raise hell. You know that about
Indians."</p>

<p>"So you go up there and start shooting," said Burnett. "And hit
squaws and young ones as well as bucks."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Old Daniel. "I'm a good enough shot to
hit what I aim at."</p>

<p>"It's been done by men with better eyesight and better aim than
you've got, Daniel. I don't like to see a dead Indian woman. None
of you'll like it either, and you'll get to wondering whose bullet
it was. Look here, you're snowballing this thing too big out of
nothing. There's no massacre in sight. There's only some hungry
bucks floating around. Make up a small party and go up to their
camp and have a powwow. Take a little grub for a present. Smoke a
few pipes of tobacco with those people. Talk it out. What we've got
is a situation where one side knows nothing about the other, and
we're both afraid. Let's go see these people."</p>

<p>"I ain't afraid of any God-damned buck Indian I ever saw,"
stated Old Daniel. "And I don't propose to lug grub to any of 'em,
and I don't propose to squat in a circle with some tricky creature
who attacked my daughter-in-law. I don't propose to be friendly
with a shiftless, ignorant, dirty bunch of savages I can't trust,
don't like and don't want around me. You listen to me, Rice. I do
business with my own kind. I stick with my own kind. I don't make
allowances for thieves and thugs when they attack my own kind. I am
downright disappointed in you. You want 'em to come down here and
wrestle with Lavinia and Edna again? It's all right to be fair.
It's fine to be big-minded, but there's an end to that. Far's I'm
concerned it ends right here. If this crowd of men don't want to
march up there I'll take my sons and a few others and go up there
myself."</p>

<p>"That's your business," said Rice.</p>

<p>"You bet it is. And it ought to be your business, too. You live
here."</p>

<p>"So I do. And when a Molala jumps me I'll settle with
<i>him.</i> I won't ask the whole country to march up the hill and
wipe out the entire village of Molalas."</p>

<p>Provost said in a reasonable way: "You're wrong, Rice. If we
don't make a show, they'll get worse. You know Indians."</p>

<p>Rice shook his head. "You boys have made up your minds about it
so there's no use arguing. But it's a mistake. When you start
shooting there'll be somebody killed that oughtn't be killed. It's
unnecessary."</p>

<p>Lige Ebbett broke in: "We goin' to talk all day and do nothing?
Let's vote on a captain."</p>

<p>"All in favor of Daniel say so," called out Provost.</p>

<p>They elected Old Daniel. They chose Ryal McIver and Elam Walker
for lieutenants; there was a lively contest between Gay, Eby and
Moss Rinearson for sergeant. Somebody called for election speeches
and each man made one. Somebody said, "One Rinearson's enough for
office. This thing turnin' into a family affair?" Moss said
immediately, "I'll withdraw." On a show of hands Eby was made
sergeant.</p>

<p>Old Daniel assumed his captaincy without delay. "Now men," he
said, "if I'm captain, I propose to be captain. I ain't goin' to
march half a mile, call for a vote, and march another half-mile. We
got to get this thing done&mdash;and right away. We'll meet at Mrs.
Irish's meadow five o'clock in the morning. Bring whatever guns
you've got and grub enough for a couple days. That ought to be long
enough. If Rice thinks they're such reasonable beasts we ought to
convince 'em without delay. You know a little jargon, Rice&mdash;so
you can do the powwowin' for us."</p>

<p>"Won't be with you."</p>

<p>"Well, by God," said Old Daniel, "that's a fine thing, not to
throw in with your neighbors."</p>

<p>Lot White spoke up. "Rice, what's in your craw?"</p>

<p>Burnett said: "What kind of religion do you believe in, Lot?
Have you got a Sunday kind and a Monday kind?"</p>

<p>"Who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed,"
answered Lot. "There's your answer. There's our command to go
chastise the savage."</p>

<p>"There's no blood been shed."</p>

<p>"Why," said Lot, "it's logical to believe it would be shed if we
don't go forth and stop it. Now don't you argue with me about
Scripture. The Lord fights for us and expects we shall fight for
Him. And there's a heathen race, not fair in the Lord's eyes
whatever. I'll be marchin' right along with my neighbors. If I
ain't squeamish about this thing you got no call to be."</p>

<p>The crowd waited for an answer. The feeling around Burnett was
quiet, odd and reserved. He had gone against the will of the
majority. He said to Lot, "Don't you ever come to me with your
preaching again. I'm like an Indian in one way. A man can't speak
two things with one tongue, and when you divide people into two
meadows, one to eat the Lord's grass and one to starve on the
Lord's stones, I don't want your sermons." He turned to his horse,
got on the saddle and rode away from the meeting. He felt the
sudden isolation from his neighbors, but more deeply than his
isolation he felt his failure to bring them to a moderate temper.
He had argued the case poorly, he had become stubborn too soon, he
had drawn off too soon. John Gay could have brought them to
reasonableness; and as he thought of this he realized how great was
the power of an upright man's reputation and the power of a
reasonable man's voice. John Gay was a great man, the force of his
character working through this settlement in its many ways. Now he
thought he saw something. A word was a weapon&mdash;like any other
weapon, it needed a skillful user&mdash;but a word was the greatest
of all weapons. A bullet reached only half a mile and struck only
one target, and was spent in a second. A word reached through all
these hills, across the land, around the whole earth, and struck
its ten thousand targets and set off its reactions which lasted a
long time, sometimes years; sometimes longer, for the words of some
men spoken ages back&mdash;still were striking around him, striking
inside him.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Men straggled through the five o'clock darkness to assemble at the
ford. Mrs. Irish's cabin lamp flashed against a light-falling rain
and voices grumbled around the group. Daniel Rinearson called the
names of his volunteers. "Where's Hawley, where's Lathrop? Speak
up&mdash;speak up, we can't fight no Indian battles down here. Form
a double line men, form it. We'll make two platoons. McIver, you
command first platoon, Walker, second. Come on, boys, don't stand
rump to the wind. We got this to do and no use draggin'. Form
line."</p>

<p>Lattimore said: "What the hell's lines for? Let's just start
walkin'. We ain't goin' to be in any line when we get to
shootin'."</p>

<p>Old Daniel said, "Who the hell's captain here? I ain't runnin' a
hay crew, I'm runnin' a company and I want it to look like a
company and act like a company."</p>

<p>Not much was said. The settlers milled slow and sluggish into
line; they stood lumplike and silent while Old Daniel moved back
and forth to count noses. More men came into the clearing. Lot
White called out, "Mercer's sick, he won't be here."</p>

<p>"Well, where's Lathrop, where's Hawley?"</p>

<p>"Here," said Hawley.</p>

<p>The line grew longer and as the waiting went on, the settlers
grew restive. "Come on, Daniel."</p>

<p>"We ain't got everybody."</p>

<p>"We got thirty. How many Indians we goin' to fight?"</p>

<p>"All right," said Rinearson. "We'll march in a column of twos. I
want a pair of scouts hundred yards ahead&mdash;Eby and Lattimore,
you start ahead. I want a man a hundred yards behind the column.
Hawley, you do that. I want flankers out, hundred feet to each
side. Kitchen and Moss to the left. Snearley and Cross to the
right."</p>

<p>Kitchen said: "That ain't practical. I'll be snarled up in the
trees, or crawlin' on the side of a hill for the next ten miles.
What we so careful about? No Indians down here."</p>

<p>"God damn it," said Old Daniel, "have we got to vote on every
time we spit or turn around?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's right on that," said Provost. "Nothing down here to
worry about. We won't need no flankers till we're in the
hills."</p>

<p>The crowd agreed with Provost and Old Daniel said irritably,
"All right, don't do it, then."</p>

<p>"Let's go," said Walker.</p>

<p>Lattimore said: "I'd as soon wait till we're sure we got
everybody. The more, the easier."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Hawley, "we talkin' or we goin'?"</p>

<p>"Men," said Old Daniel, "we don't know what's ahead, but we'll
do what we got to do. I want no runnin' back, I want no gallopin'
around if we get in action. Keep cool and do what I call out. Keep
those pans dry." His command came out as a whooping, "Column of
twos&mdash;for'd, march!"</p>

<p>The column set off in its curious fashion, the head stretching
like the pleats of an accordion, the back end lagging. Presently
the line was entirely in motion, tail hurrying to catch up with the
forward part; it crossed the meadow, entered the trees and filed by
Buck's place. Mrs. Buck handed her husband a parcel of food and
kissed him. They passed Lattimore's. At Burnett's, Eby dropped out
a moment to go into the cabin and speak to Burnett at his
breakfast. But Burnett shook his head and Eby went on. It was still
dark when they reached Lockyear's, no light showing in the cabin.
Beyond this place the creek entered a narrow gorge and the trail,
having no other place to go, moved into the timber and up the face
of a hill by one looping turn upon another. The steady rain turned
the dirt slick; they went slipping and grunting along the stiff
grade, plunged into the hard darkness of the forest. Occasionally a
word came down the line, "Keep closed up&mdash;keep up."
Occasionally a faster moving man collided with the man before him
and small explosions of temper broke the preoccupied quiet. Voices
sank lower and the mood of the column settled. A steady wind made
its minor roar far above them in the treetops and at times shook
down sheets of water. Somewhere back in the column a man's
out-of-breath grumble rose, "Tell him not to walk so fast," but Old
Daniel towed his company upward without pause, through the first
coffee-colored stain of daylight, across a short clearing into
whose sodden grasses their feet deeply sank, and on through the
timber again. They reached the creek's canyon and skirted it for a
little while, catching the glitter of the broken waters below; they
labored along the face of a ridge, the trail curling around one
massive fir trunk and another, reached its summit, and arrived at
the edge of another mountain meadow. Here they halted to catch a
wind they needed. Walker overtook Old Daniel. "My God, you runnin'
to a fire?"</p>

<p>"I am sixty-one years old," said Old Daniel. "What's the matter
with you young fellows?" He watched the men at the rear of the
column come from the trees one by one; he watched them sag against
the fir trunks, settle on their haunches, prop themselves against
their guns. Billy Lord arrived last, the sound of his lungs like
the swashing of a crosscut saw through a log. Old Daniel shook his
head. "It's a soft generation, by God. You can't walk, drink or
fight like mine did. Now then, I want flankers out, I want two men
ahead, one man behind. We can't be more'n five miles from that
Molally camp."</p>

<p>At this elevation rain clouds dragged the earth, the light was
gray, steam shimmered on the meadow; the wall of trees beyond the
meadow was obscure.</p>

<p>"She still up?" asked Walker.</p>

<p>"Nothin' but up," said Old Daniel.</p>

<p>"Rather have my Indian fightin' on flat ground."</p>

<p>"Indians and women, you got to catch 'em where you catch 'em."
Old Daniel walked around the group with his bow-legged springy
stride, making a show of his endurance. He cocked his hat over his
eyes. He said, "Keep your guns covered. What the hell you got
there, Durbin?"</p>

<p>Durbin Young extended a ten-foot pole with a butcher knife
lashed to its end; he pointed it directly against Old Daniel's
stomach. "Ain't it somethin', Daniel?"</p>

<p>"You goin' to tickle 'em to death? Now, men, we ain't far off
from that outfit. Keep close together. Don't nobody straggle. Don't
make any more noise than you got to. Don't no man fire till I say
so."</p>

<p>"Think we been seen yet?"</p>

<p>"It's a question," said Old Daniel. "Well, for'd."</p>

<p>The settlers re-grouped themselves; the line curled over the
marshy meadow in tighter shape than before and entered the trees
and tackled a hill rougher than the preceding one. "How the hell
they ride horses on this," said Provost, "I don't know." At the
next meadow they saw the relics of a camp. It was then time for
full daylight but the clouds were still close about them and the
rain hung on. Everybody was soaked through and enveloped in the
steam of their own private exertions. Now the trail made a long
gradual climb through the trees, and the trees grew smaller and
farther apart and presently the company reached the edge of a
larger meadow than they had previously passed. The creek ran
through it, ragged brush grew along its edges, and the tents of the
Molalas stood directly before them.</p>

<p>"Spread out," said Old Daniel. "First platoon right. Second
left. Mind me now, boys."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said McIver. "This is funny. Ain't an Indian in
sight."</p>

<p>"Well, it's rainin'," said Old Daniel.</p>

<p>The settlers trickled through the trees to make a broad front
against the Indian village; they crept, they crouched, they kept
well within the shelter, their talk fell to a whispering, they
looked about with a whetted concern&mdash;to the darkness of the
timber behind them, to their neighbors on either side, to the
Indian shelters shrouded by the pearly fog before them. Nothing
alive showed itself&mdash;man, woman, child or dog. No horses
browsed in the fore part of the meadow; neither were there shadows
of horses in the thick mists which obscured the yonder end of the
clearing; but above each lodge was a small curl of smoke.</p>

<p>"Inside," said Old Daniel.</p>

<p>"Then there'd be dogs or horses outside," said Provost. "They
been here&mdash;they heard us or saw us&mdash;they got out."</p>

<p>"Look sharp behind," warned McIver. "Everybody look sharp."</p>

<p>Everybody, hit by the same notion at the same time, wheeled.
Fred Lattimore slowly circled a tree, gun raised to sweep the
timber behind him; its turning muzzle yawned on Lorenzo Buck.
Lorenzo dropped flat. "You eternal fool," said Buck, "point that
thing somewhere else."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Old Daniel, "they ain't back of us. They're
yonder beyond the lodges. Now, men, don't start shootin' at
shadows. We'll go right straight forward to the tents. If they're
empty, we'll sweep across the meadow to that brush. Come
on&mdash;come on."</p>

<p>He walked into the clearing with his last warning. "Keep them
pans dry." The settlers broke from the trees, the raggedness of the
skirmish line most pronounced. Old Daniel, thirty feet ahead of his
company, reached the first tent and brushed its door flap aside
with the muzzle of his rifle; he put his head through the doorway
and drew back. He shook his head. "Nothin' in there but a hell of a
bad odor." The company moved by the first tent while Old Daniel
pressed forward to inspect the second tent; he walked along the
line of tents, searching each one. The village was deserted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Provost read his own story in the fresh-cut prints on
the muddy soil and followed these prints as they led toward the
creek and continued southward beyond the creek through tall brush
toward the firs farther on. He made a signal with his hand. "This
way," he said and led the company to the creek.</p>

<p>Old Daniel trotted back from the end of the village. "Who the
hell's captain here?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"You want Indians or you want a long walk for nothin'?" retorted
Provost.</p>

<p>Old Daniel hurried to the front of his men and splashed across
the creek. Waving his gun overhead, he plunged into the brush and
became only a noise crashing through the thicket; the settlers
began to take voice as they rushed on, throaty, shrill, lung-deep.
Old Daniel's voice, trying to override the confusion, made no
impression but somewhere a tremendously excited shout rose above
the general racket. "Here&mdash;here!" The crashing grew as men
wheeled in the direction of the summons. A gun exploded, Old Daniel
raised a war-cry. Fighting through this jungle of willow and alder
and chance vines, the settlers broke into an open stretch lying
between the brush and the trees beyond&mdash;and came upon the
Molalas. Women and children and animals were at the moment
disappearing into the trees, but the men had turned to make a stand
with their guns and their bows. Old Daniel yelled, "Charge," and
moved forward at a walk, gun flung to his shoulder.</p>

<p>The settlers advanced a short distance, then began to drop one
by one to their knees to take aim. Provost shouted toward Daniel,
"Come back here you damn fool or you'll get shot from behind!"
Flint smashed on steel, no explosion following; for the steady rain
got at the powder and wetted it beyond ignition. The Molalas,
witnessing that dry volley, ceased their shifting retreat, turned
about and came forward in weaving, evasive motion. Suddenly Harris
Eby, carrying a revolver whose cap was not as readily affected by
the rain, trotted toward Old Daniel, his gun making its lone
explosions in the day; on his heels came Durbin Young with his
butcher knife lashed to the ten-foot pole. Arrows whacked the
ground or went breathing by. At the end of the skirmish line John
Mercer, owning the only other cap-and-ball in the company, began to
fire.</p>

<p>In rain and fog and confusion there was nothing clear. Up and
down the skirmish line men sank to their knees to pour fresh powder
into their pans beneath the shelter of their overcoats. Meanwhile,
Old Daniel, edging farther and farther from his company, found
himself engaged with a Molala who had singled him out. The Molala,
his powder as wet as Old Daniel's, took his dead aim on Old Daniel,
pulled the trigger and got no flash; and he dodged as Old Daniel
took aim and tried again. Both men, slowly circling each other and
slowly drawing together, clicked gun hammers repeatedly on soaked
powder until Old Daniel dropped his gun from his eyes to find the
Molala not ten feet from him. He stood a moment in shocked surprise
at the nearness of the Indian; he stared across the space, he let
go with a wild yell, he reversed his useless gun to make a useful
club of it and sprang forward. The Molala leaped aside and rushed
into the nearby timber.</p>

<p>Half a dozen shots had been fired, all from the two cap-and-ball
pistols which alone worked in the wet day; there had been a brief
scurry of arrows. Durbin Young stood in the clearing with his
butcher-knife lance extended toward the green timber; nobody, red
or white, lay on the ground, nobody had been hurt, and the Molalas
were gone.</p>

<p>Old Daniel rallied his lieutenants around him while the company
tried to pour dry powder into the wetted pans. "Well," he said,
"they got away. We'll follow."</p>

<p>Provost said: "Follow where?" He pointed at the wall of timber
which faced them; it was a barrier which, viewed from the meadow,
seemed a thousand miles deep. "How the hell you travel through that
stuff? There's no trail."</p>

<p>"They did it&mdash;we can do it."</p>

<p>The company gathered around to join the argument. "I don't
know," said McIver. "They might be waiting for us to do just that
thing. Looks like a fine place to get lost in, get cut off, get
butchered up one by one."</p>

<p>"We come up here to get Indians," said Old Daniel.</p>

<p>A single arrow, flung from afar, passed between Old Daniel and
Harris Eby, and to a man the company dropped.</p>

<p>"Men," said Old Daniel, "we'll withdraw to the brush."</p>

<p>The settlers turned, crawled a short distance and rose and
trotted to the shelter of the brush, there pausing to watch the
trees. Nothing could be seen of the Indians, and after squatting a
quarter-hour in the steady rain the settlers grew restless.</p>

<p>"It gravels me to go back and say we did nothing," said Old
Daniel.</p>

<p>"Burn the village," suggested McIver. "That'll make 'em move
on."</p>

<p>"We'll burn," said Old Daniel. The company threaded the brush,
crossed the creek and came upon the village. "Two men go into each
tent, pile everything in the middle and set 'em on fire. Rest of
the company will stand guard. They might crawl back to make a
fight."</p>

<p>But while Old Daniel looked on the company dissolved before him,
each settler struck by an idea that hastened him to the lodges.
There was a great rummaging around and the settlers came out
presently with whatever plunder they had found. "Great God," said
Old Daniel, "ain't this a fine fight? Lattimore, I hope that
blanket infests you with fleas till your woman drives you out." The
fires were started and in a short time the line of tents glowed
bright against the dull day, burst into clear flame and burned
furiously for a little while.</p>

<p>"They won't come back," said Provost. "And they won't bother us
any more, either."</p>

<p>Eby said: "Wonder how they'll live?"</p>

<p>"I ain't goin' to bother my head about that," said Old Daniel.
"Well, men, form lines and we'll start home."</p>

<p>The settlers made a loose shift of a line before Old Daniel's
dissatisfied eyes. Last men came down the street and guards drifted
in from the creek. Harry Mercer, burdened with an Indian basket, a
captured Hudson's Bay blanket, and a gun, dropped his prizes to
take a better grip on the gun. He swung it parallel to his legs,
balancing the piece with one hand; the nose dipped when he stooped
to catch up basket and blanket. He tightened his fingers around the
gun and in so doing he squeezed the trigger, released the
still-cocked hammer and exploded a charge which had failed to catch
on half a dozen previous tries. Old Daniel raised a penetrating
cry, slapped both hands behind him and fell to his knees. "I'm
shot! Boys, I been hit!"</p>

<p>The company rushed around him; Mercer flung away his gun and
rushed forward, shouting "I killed a man!"&mdash;He knocked his way
through the group. "Daniel, you dyin'?"</p>

<p>"Don't think so," said Old Daniel. He was still on his knees,
still with both hands pressed behind him. He had a thoughtful
expression; he drew his hands away, saw blood, and sent them back
for further exploration. Mercer and Eby took him by the arms and
lifted him and, as they turned him about, the company saw that
Mercer's stray bullet, tearing Old Daniel's trousers, had made a
light and grazing trail across his buttocks.</p>

<p>The company waited. Old Daniel showed the men about him a
peculiar expression, took a tentative step or two forward, and
spoke briefly. "We'll go home now."</p>

<p>The company passed into the trees and moved down the dark trail,
each man burdened by his new possessions. Very little was said, but
at the first clearing Harris Eby, trudging thoughtfully along,
suddenly broke into a long laugh.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" asked Old Daniel.</p>

<p>"Men," said Eby, still laughing, "we just fought the battle of
Huckleberry Mountain against the savages. We're Indian war veterans
and maybe someday we'll get a pension. Twenty years from now, the
way we'll no doubt tell it, it'll be a hell of a big battle."</p>

<p>Old Daniel gave him the briefest possible glance. "I don't see a
damned thing funny about it," he said and went on without further
talk. The settlers filed down the trail like a string of gypsies,
Molala possessions hanging from them at every angle. Now and then
Eby broke into his chuckle, drawing the irritable edge of Old
Daniel's glance. The captain's pride festered within him.</p>

<h2><a name="ch42" id="ch42"></a>Chapter 42</h2>

<p>AT noon Burnett returned from his road work in the timber, made
a meal, and stood awhile at the cabin's doorway with his pipe to
watch the smoldering stump fires send their sleazy smoke through
the trees. The work so far done scarcely made a scratch in that
dense stuff; it would require two months' of the hardest labor to
cut a passable way for wagons, and this labor was somehow to be
squeezed in with other chores equally insistent, all to be done by
July harvest time. He knocked out the pipe and started back to
work.</p>

<p>Half over the meadow he lifted his face to the fine rain falling
and knew he would do no more this day. The smell of the earth was
strong, the hills boiled with mist, his restlessness was too much.
Returning to the cabin, he got his gun, tucked powder flask and
hunting knife beneath his coat and struck into the timber. Work
trimmed him too fine, ground him too thin and the feeling was upon
him again that he was a harnessed horse plodding the furrows back
and forth. The strain of this long haul had begun to have its
effect&mdash;the incessant push of things to do, the long hours,
the monotony of poor food and an empty cabin, the gray color of
life, the need for patience and drudgery which never grew less, the
knowledge that harvest time with its release was still months
away.</p>

<p>He climbed steadily through water-drenched underbrush, the mist
growing so thick that his passing body stirred it. He came upon a
trail and followed it until he reached a fork&mdash;one route, made
by the cat animals, sliding beneath the logs and through narrow
places, the other route looping around these obstructions and
printed with the tracks of deer and bear. It was an hour's work to
make the top of the ridge; along this high ground he had previously
shot several deer but none of the tracks he saw were fresh and the
way at last became so rough that he slid into the adjoining ravine
and bucked his way to the crest of the next ridge.
Beyond&mdash;unseen in the day's clogging mists&mdash;the land rose
toward high mountains eastward.</p>

<p>He reached a fallen tree whose root system made a ragged disk in
the daylight and under this partial shelter he crouched to watch
the visible part of the ravine below him and the deer run which
came from the lower depths and passed nearby. Water dripped from
him while he rested and made a pool around his feet and collected
inside his boots. He grew cold and left the shelter, following the
deer run downgrade into the denser fog. On all sides of him the
crowded timber disappeared into the mists above, and through those
far-off tops the wind steadily sighed. The ravine grew more
jungle-like as he dropped into it, brush rising head high about
him, and windfalls and broken branches and litter made a rough
floor from one ravine wall to the other, completely covering the
creek which rattled beneath.</p>

<p>Faint motion in the growing grayness of the mist stopped him. He
ran his glance along the opposite slope of the ravine and saw a
deer poised in the brush.</p>

<p>He dried his pan before shaking in powder; he shielded the pan
as he brought up the gun, fired and watched the deer jump high and
drop; he laid aside the gun&mdash;carefully noting where he placed
it&mdash;and bucked a path through the brush until he found a log
which had fallen in such a way as to make a kind of footbridge
across the tangled debris. He thought, <i>Hell of a place to kill
meat,</i> and tested the log before he began to walk forward.</p>

<p>It lay perhaps ten feet above the unseen creek, supported by
logs beneath it and weighted down by other logs over it&mdash;all
these lying in a matchstick tangle and covered by branches and duff
rained down from the high timber. He kept his eyes on the deer,
which had ceased to struggle; ten feet forward he surged his weight
against the log again to be sure of it and felt no weakness. He
came to a cross-log running more nearly in the direction he wanted
to go; he moved to it, took three easy steps forward&mdash;and
heard the sharp crack of its old wood. As it fell, he threw himself
forward to hook arms and chest over another log nearby; he missed;
he plunged straight down through the heavy layer of branches; he
heard more logs give way; he reached the creek and sank into its
bubbling mud and violently turned himself as he saw a shadow move
past his eyes. He was struck across the thighs and in the small of
the back, and he went sliding and tumbling into the strange
darkness, making aimless motions to defend himself. A log thundered
over him and came to a grinding pause; he was scraped by a falling
knot. He felt no particular pain when the shifting of the deadfalls
ceased and he couldn't immediately discover what had happened. A
rain of old twigs and bark chunks and rotted fir needles descended
for a short time; then that quit.</p>

<p>He sat in a strange position, buttocks gently settling into the
half-water and half-mud of the creek; but as he sank, his knees and
lower legs remained motionless and presently he felt the strain of
his crooked position and reached around in the semidarkness to find
support, and caught hold of a slender, partially decayed log behind
him. The weight of his arm broke it and it fell against him, the
disturbance releasing other logs farther away, so that again there
was a cracking and rumbling and settling around him and a fresh
rain of twigs. This ceasing, he discovered the newly broken log to
be at his back, holding him from further descent into the
creek.</p>

<p>He hooked his arms over the log behind him for leverage and
stiffened his body to pull his legs from the mud. They were lodged
and wouldn't slide. He bent forward and felt a log perhaps a foot
in diameter, smooth with age, lying across his legs above the
knees, so buoyed by the mud that its weight was not painful. He
twisted his legs and sought to drive them deeper into the mud, to
work them around, to shift them into a different position; but none
of his effort broke them from the trap. They seemed to rest on a
broad, water-smoothed stone, the back of his knees fitting into the
curve of the stone, the lower part of his legs hanging along the
farther side; thus, with the log above and the stone below, he was
like a man imprisoned in stocks. He was able to work one leg
perhaps six inches sidewise and to lift it somewhat less than that
distance upward, but the other leg was fast-bound and when he
passed his hand over the log lying across his thighs he touched the
swell of a boll on its farther side and discovered a limb
projecting downward from the boll into the mud. He rocked the foot
of his trapped leg and felt the pressure of it come up the limb. It
was the limb which pinned his foot&mdash;his left
foot&mdash;against the stone.</p>

<p>He rested a moment, then he swung his upper body farther to the
left and raised his right leg to make a straight pull. But the
stone beneath him lay at one level and the found of the log over
him lay at a slightly lower level and he could not maneuver his leg
into any position which would give it clearance; he tried several
times and stopped when he felt pain build up behind his knee; he
was sawing his leg against the stone's ridge. He lay back, resting
again. It couldn't be done that way. He had somehow to free his
left foot from the branch and give himself more flexibility.</p>

<p>He sat in a doubled-over position, hips deep in mud and water.
The first shock had passed and feeling gradually lessened in the
lower parts of his body; sensation came sluggish and delayed when
he moved his toes. He unbuttoned his overcoat and drew out his
hunting knife, and he bent forward to lay the knife across the
limb, and sat idle in this forward cramped position to review the
possibilities he had. The limb, cut through, would free his left
foot and perhaps permit him to sink his whole body low enough into
the creek to slide sidewise until he got himself clear of the
rock&mdash;if the rock didn't extend too far&mdash;and thus draw
his legs from beneath the log. Otherwise he could only chip away at
the underside of the log to give his legs the clearance they
needed. Which was best to do? Would the log settle and crush his
legs against the stone if he chopped away the branch? He struck the
branch with his free leg and felt it give; it didn't seem to be
supporting the log. He struck it again, thinking he might crack it,
but he couldn't move his feet fast enough through the mud to lend
any force to the kick; and then he decided to cut the branch and so
set to work.</p>

<p>He had left the cabin around one o'clock, he had been two hours
traveling the hills; it was now about three with a darker and
darker stain showing in the heavy fog. Above him was the ragged
hole created by his fall and through it came a wan light which was
of no value to him. Hands and knife were in darkness and he worked
by touch, shaving off the limb's bark and coming upon the
cross-grained inner wood. The hunting knife had a six-inch blade
with a handle nearly as long, and a notion occurred to him and he
reached into his pocket for his bandanna, wrapped it around the
point of the knife, and thus was able to make a drawing knife of
it, shoving it through the wood with both hands. This presently
tired him, since his upper body was strained against his trapped
legs, and he rested back and watched the day die through the
overhead aperture.</p>

<p>In another hour his cows would come to the yard fence and stand
waiting to be milked. Usually when he was away overnight he asked
Lattimore or Watt Irish to take care of the stock; this day he had
warned nobody. In the morning the cows would start bawling for
relief and if the wind didn't spring up that sound might carry as
far as Millard's. Otherwise there'd be no likely visitors. Hawn's
visits were infrequent. The Lockyears would pay no attention if
they passed the cabin. Except for the possible warning of the cows,
or for some unexpected visitor, it might be a week before his
absence was noted around the settlement. Katherine would miss him
by that time.</p>

<p>He returned to the limb, shaving it sliver by sliver. There was
some pitch in it and long seasoning had given it a marble hardness;
in his cramped position he could put no great force on the blade
and when it occasionally jumped from the wood he lost his balance
and fell back to the log behind him. It grew dark and the rain
strengthened and he heard the increased roar of the wind high in
the timber. The water no longer bothered him greatly; numbness made
its insulation around him. Some time after dark&mdash;two hours,
three hours, he had no way of estimating&mdash;he gave the limb a
kick with his loose foot and heard it snap, and reached forward and
pounded his fist against the branch until it fell free.</p>

<p>He put the knife in his pocket, taking great care with his
motions; he ground himself deeper into the mud to bring his legs at
a greater slant between log and stone and pulled himself back as
far as the barrier behind would permit, to discover he couldn't
crook himself in any position which would free him from the trap.
Next, he bent forward to hug the log and to slide his legs one
difficult inch at a time toward the left, hoping to find an end to
the stone, or a dip in it; instead he came against a swell in the
log and could go no farther; he worked to the right and made at
best a foot when stone and log stopped him with their tighter
fit.</p>

<p>He returned to the loosest place in the trap and ceased to work;
exercise had warmed him enough to make him feel the contrasting
cold; his mind quickened. Little miseries began to
accumulate&mdash;the stillness of his legs, the steady run of water
against his body, the chafing of wet clothes against wrists and
neck, the cramped position of his crotch. For the first time the
sensation of entrapment spread through him. The effect of it was to
turn him violently active. He plunged himself deep into the mud,
hoisted his legs as high and as stiff as he could manage and hauled
roughly back with his body. He ground his flesh into the stone, he
struck his knees repeatedly against the log. Then that blind revolt
passed and he took control of himself. He was embarrassed by the
moment of panic.</p>

<p>With the greatest of care he took the knife from his pocket,
spraddled his legs and began to stab away the bark at the bottom of
the tree. Only this possibility remained; to carve an alley a foot
wide and perhaps a foot deep through the log to give his legs the
necessary clearance over the stone. The bark was half an inch thick
and soon stripped aside. <i>Eleven and a half inches to go,</i> he
thought, and gouged the knife point shallowly into the slick,
obdurate wood; he drew the knife away and laid his finger on the
track he had made and pulled off a sliver of wood the size of a
toothpick. He sat uncomfortably humped. <i>All night,</i> he
thought. <i>All day, maybe another night.</i> For a short while
doubt moved as loose, greasy ripples along his body, and he
remembered he had done this before, in another fashion, in Sonora:
he had gone out and out until there was nothing but formless pain
in him and nothing but clouds&mdash;as real as this
mist&mdash;about him; he had gone so far out that he felt final
bits of energy roll around within him as the sediment water at the
bottom of a dirty pail. He thought: <i>Same thing again&mdash;but
it's a long way to go before I get that far.</i></p>

<p>He bowed his shoulders and moved the knife back and forth across
the bottom of the log. This was Friday&mdash;Friday, the 12th of
March. It seemed at the moment an important thing to remember,
though he couldn't understand why.</p>

<h2><a name="ch43" id="ch43"></a>Chapter 43</h2>

<p>ON that same day Collingwood and Lucy started for Oregon City,
staying overnight at Stricklin's and reaching Sydney Moss's hotel
in town late on the following afternoon. Lucy lay on the bed to
rest while Collingwood walked around the small room with his
thoughts. He stopped at the window overlooking the street; he
thrust his hands into his pockets and jingled the loose silver
there. "I want to go down and see a few people," he said. "I want
to find where the Kellys and the Nations went."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"They settled somewhere on the other side of the river. They
liked me&mdash;they might do me some good. If they're not too far
away I want to go see them. They'd take me around their settlement
and introduce me to everybody. They might speak a good word for me
among the neighbors."</p>

<p>"These people can't vote for you, can they? Don't they live in
another district?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not running in their district. But making friends,
getting known, it's a peculiar business. You never know where it
begins or ends. You never know where the seed's going to land when
you cast it."</p>

<p>He came back from the window and stood by the bed. He had on his
air of quiet importance; his mind was very active, he was scheming,
he was dreaming. In the private world he had built for himself he
was a happy man, for in that world he was big and hadn't yet known
failure. She realized that even now he was thinking beyond being
elected to the legislature; otherwise he would not be going outside
his own district to meet people.</p>

<p>"You've got something else in mind," she said.</p>

<p>His glance brushed her and traveled on. His habit of secrecy was
too strong to let him be candid with her. Everything he did was by
indirection. It was his enormous sensitiveness which made him hide
himself, she thought, or perhaps his memory of past failure in
other ways caused him to cover himself. Possessed by tremendous
ambition, he nevertheless had a knowledge of his weaknesses, and he
tried to bury them so deep that neither he nor others would see
them. He was shifting and indecisive, he took on the color of his
surroundings, and was easily swayed by the temper of other men; he
scarcely had a positive character of his own. Yet he was quietly
stubborn, he was driven by a wish greater than his fibers could
support. The sadness of it was that, having destroyed himself
before her by his lack of any dominant quality, he would sooner or
later destroy himself before any man who came to know him well. He
could neither hide himself nor create the force he lacked.</p>

<p>He said, in his considerate voice: "You won't mind being
alone?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I'll come back to the hotel before I leave town." He took time
to wash and brush and have a look at himself in the mirror; then,
giving her a short glance and a nod, he left the room. She lay on
the bed and immediately forgot him as her imagination bred its
excitement. Her thoughts ran from one practical thing to another.
"How shall I let him know I'm here? How will we meet? There, or
here&mdash;no, not here, that's impossible. How can I get to his
place and not be seen? It's such a small town. Suppose he's out in
the country on a visit and won't be back until after I leave? O
Lord, don't let that happen." She heard George's voice on the
stairway and she sprang from the bed, gave her dress a swift
smoothing with her hands, looked at herself in the mirror, and was
at the window when George rapped on the door. She said, "Come in,"
and waited until both men were in the room before turning to
them.</p>

<p>"See who I met right downstairs," said George.</p>

<p>Whitcomb made his bow, smiled, looked about the room. "A regular
icehouse of a room. The river makes everything damp. Have Moss
bring you a warming pan."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, she was indifferent. "Remember the
gorge, Ralph? When will you both stop thinking of me as
delicate?"</p>

<p>George said: "Ralph told me where the Kellys live. It's five
miles south, on the other side of the river. I'm going to go over
there now and visit around. It'll be late tomorrow, I suppose, when
I get back." He looked at the doctor. "Would it be too much to ask
you to keep Lucy company at supper tonight? This table downstairs
is pretty much a man's affair. I'd not like her troubled."</p>

<p>She couldn't be certain&mdash;perhaps it was again her
conscience-livened suspicion&mdash;but she thought she saw the
moving of secret knowledge deep back in her husband's eyes. She
gave him an embarrassed, brisk retort. "It's no compliment to be
foisted off from man to man, George, and no doubt Ralph's got his
own affairs."</p>

<p>Whitcomb drew a watch from his pocket. "It's half after four.
I've two things to do. I'll see you downstairs at six. It'll be a
pleasure. And it's best. Some of Moss's patrons warm up at the
saloon before they eat." She noticed the locket&mdash;which she had
noticed several times, and each time with a growing
interest&mdash;fixed into the heavy chain and she thought: <i>I've
got to find out about that.</i></p>

<p>"Will that be all right, Lucy?" George asked.</p>

<p>"Yes." She made it as cool as she could. "Now, then, both of you
go along."</p>

<p>Whitcomb stepped into the hall. George opened his wallet and
found two gold pieces and gave them to her. "We can spare this, if
you see anything you want." He paused a moment and watched her with
his polite, veiled manner. He bent, gave her a light kiss and said,
"Tomorrow late," and left the room.</p>

<p>She called after him, "Take care," and closed the door. It was
one of those remarks, she thought, which had become as automatic
and as meaningless as most polite words between people. It hadn't
meant anything for how long? For ten years. She remembered the day
and she remembered the scene when George, listening to the rough
and suggestive words passed to her by Harker Meloney, had made no
move to knock the words back through Harker's teeth. Later he had
only said, "He had a couple of drinks&mdash;he didn't mean it." At
the time she had thought he was a coward; now that she was older,
she wasn't altogether sure&mdash;for he had a strange tolerance, a
queer forgiveness in him, a shrinking away from things which were
disagreeable. Never had she known him to break into one clear
moment of honest, forceful emotion. It had never been mentioned
between them, but sometimes she thought he knew where it had
begun.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
There was no chance to say anything during supper, for they sat at
a common table crowded with men&mdash;teamsters, travelers, a
settler in from the Tualatin, the ferryman, an attorney, a
scattering of bachelors, a pair of lank, bony-faced
French-Canadians from the Prairie. Afterwards Ralph walked to the
foot of the stairs with her and they had a moment beyond earshot of
the others. "I saw you come into town," he said. "I went directly
home and told Mrs. Barnes I wouldn't need supper and to take the
rest of the day off. She's got people a mile out of town...Would
you come?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It's a small white house behind this street. When you leave
here, go to Abernethy's and turn left at the little lane. I'm at
the end of the lane. There's nothing too close to me, and it's
dark. I'll go there now. How long will you be?"</p>

<p>"Ten minutes."</p>

<p>He smiled. "Too long&mdash;a lot too long."</p>

<p>"That's nice," she said, and watched him go. She returned to her
room and spent a short time with her hair. She watched the mirror
closely, she looked straight into her eyes and had no wish to avoid
them. She felt wonderfully well. She was alert, she was stung by
the thousand needles of excitement, she thought of odd little
things and she thought of the one big thing. She laid on her hat
carefully and bit her lips to brighten their color. The rain and
the fog would redden her cheeks and the darkness would make her
eyes seem deeper and this was how she would look to him when she
stepped through his door. She left the hotel, crossed to
Abernethy's and entered the lane, walking as though going nowhere.
She saw the house and looked around the darkness and discovered no
other travelers in the night; he opened the door before she quite
reached it, shut it behind her and took her immediately. She had a
fleeting glimpse of his face before she closed her eyes and saw the
expression upon it. He was more intemperate with her than he had
been at their first meeting in the cabin and she gave him back the
same intemperance. Presently he stepped away, shaking his head. "My
God, Lucy, I could beat you to pieces."</p>

<p>"That's it, that's just it."</p>

<p>"I ought to have some restraint," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't talk about restraint. I can't bear the thought. It's a
way people kill each other. I'm half dead of it now."</p>

<p>He took her coat and hat and laid them on the room's table.
"Well, here's my house."</p>

<p>"I want to see it&mdash;I want to see where you walk and stand
and sleep and eat. I'll have a lot of time to think about you,
later. I want something to think about, where I can see you when I
think about you."</p>

<p>It was a plain, angular, even a homely house. The front room had
a rosebud paper on it and held a table, four chairs, and a tin
stove. The kitchen was painted brown, walls and floor. There were
two bedrooms, both furnished and both small. "Who sleeps in the
extra one?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Barnes."</p>

<p>She went into the extra room, moved around it and came out; she
walked into his bedroom and stood at the dresser, touching the
things on its top&mdash;brush and comb, scissors, razor and mug, a
jar of buttons, a packet with thread and needles&mdash;all arranged
in a military row. She looked at herself in the mirror behind the
dresser and caught his glance following her from the doorway, and
as she swung about he came forward and put his arm around her
waist. She said nothing; she waited, her head tipped against his
shoulder, and after the silence had gone on a little while she
raised her glance and saw that he had been closely watching her;
she smiled and walked to the front room's stove, holding her hands
over it.</p>

<p>"Cold?"</p>

<p>"I think it's damper here than where we live."</p>

<p>"It's the river."</p>

<p>He came beside her but this time he held his hands away from
her. He said: "Do you want coffee?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not unless you do."</p>

<p>He shook his head and looked beyond her to the front window. "I
think I ought..." He crossed the room and rolled down the shade and
came back. Unexpectedly, she was embarrassed and looked steadily at
the stove but from the corner of her eyes she observed that his
face had settled, both the warmth and the roughness leaving it.
Something struck both of them and changed them; they weren't close
now, they were strange to each other.</p>

<p>He said: "It's odd how George brought me up to you tonight. Do
you suppose he's got anything in his mind?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said. "Would it matter to you?"</p>

<p>"Not to me. I'd not like it for you."</p>

<p>"It's past time to think about that, isn't it?"</p>

<p>She was at the moment in a contrary state of mind, puzzled by
him and irritated at herself. She tried to keep this from her
voice, but the chance remark slid through his guard and hurt him,
for he said, "I guess it is," and though he didn't move she had the
feeling that he drew away from her.</p>

<p>"What did I say, Ralph? What was it?"</p>

<p>"The truth, mostly. I think too much."</p>

<p>"Well, what are you thinking now?"</p>

<p>"You didn't like me to draw that blind, did you?"</p>

<p>"It gave me a funny feeling."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"Just for a moment. It's gone. It did you too. I saw it on your
face. You were thinking this was, well, something that happens all
the time. Now that I'm here and it's possible, it's not the same,
it's not what you thought it might be like."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I was thinking..." He checked himself and he was
angry with himself. "Why have we got to do this&mdash;paw it around
and around until there's no shape to it?"</p>

<p>Now she could look directly at him. She was cool, she was
reckless. "You really meant to say, Why are we ashamed of
ourselves? But I wasn't when I came into your house." She walked to
the table and put on her hat; she let him help her into her coat,
but she kept her head turned from him and when his hands touched
her shoulders she stirred away and went to the door. She faced the
door, more and more angry; she felt beaten and bitter. She thought,
<i>All this&mdash;and nothing comes of it.</i> Her body was so
brittle with the piled-up strains within that she felt one sharp
blow would shatter her. He came beside her, looking down with the
tight expression returned to his face. He was abrupt and distant.
"I'll walk back to the hotel with you."</p>

<p>"I came alone," she said. "I can go back the same way." As he
opened the door she added, "I had something when I got here. I've
got nothing now. We talked it to death."</p>

<p>He pulled her back and kicked the door shut. She whirled and
gripped his arms and settled against him. "Ralph&mdash;Ralph what
happened&mdash;it was bad&mdash;it mustn't ever happen again. Don't
let me say those things&mdash;don't ever look cold at me."</p>

<p>He turned her. She said, "Wait," and threw off her coat and hat
and left them on the table and walked into the semidarkness of the
bedroom.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
She said, "What time's it?"</p>

<p>"Around twelve."</p>

<p>"I'd better go. I'll need a light."</p>

<p>He brought the lamp from the front room and went back to stoke
the stove. When he came in again she sat before the bureau mirror,
working at her hair. He stood behind her and he dropped his hands
over her breasts.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "I'm not modest."</p>

<p>"Time's past."</p>

<p>"Oh? You think you can come storming at me now, any time, day or
night."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, you can." The reflection of her face in the mirror was
soft-amber from the lamplight. She was gay, she teased him with her
eyes. "What happened to us for a minute? What got into us? I was
desperate. Oh, Ralph, that must never happen."</p>

<p>"You had it right. It was too much talk."</p>

<p>"We didn't talk much. But it came so suddenly."</p>

<p>"Too much thinking, then. Too much yes or no. Too much black or
white. All of that nonsense."</p>

<p>"Well, it's gone."</p>

<p>"Entirely gone."</p>

<p>Her hands lay momentarily still; her lips rolled back as she
laughed.</p>

<p>"I got to thinking, right in the middle of it, what would you
have done if somebody had come to the door and said there was a man
with a broken leg to be fixed?"</p>

<p>"He'd've suffered for a while."</p>

<p>"You've got a proud look. You're saying to yourself, 'I did
it.'</p>

<p>"I've got a woman," he said.</p>

<p>She finished her hair and laid her hands on the table and became
thoughtful. "I never thought it would happen to me. All I saw was
years of nothing. I suppose that's what most people see. And put up
with it. I expected to put up with it, too. I don't know when I
noticed something on your face. Way back on the trail. I was
suspicious of you a long time, but I watched you every minute."</p>

<p>"It was pretty easy to see. I was a dead giveaway."</p>

<p>"The night in the gorge you came to the wagon&mdash;that was
when I decided I would, if you asked. You don't know how hard I
hoped you'd ask and all the things I've done to put myself in your
road."</p>

<p>"I'm not good at this business."</p>

<p>"You're not sure of yourself. That's strange. You're a doctor
and you've known so many women that you ought to understand about
them."</p>

<p>"What ought I to understand about them?"</p>

<p>She spoke carefully. "I believe you put too much value on their
standards. You're afraid you'll disturb something. With a happy
wife, you might. But if she were happy she'd not listen to you and
there'd be no harm done. As for the others, like me, what are
standards worth when there's nothing for them to love?" She reached
an arm backward and drew his head to her head. "Now I've got
something and there's my standard. Next time we meet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Next time..." he said. "Now that begins. When's next time?
We've had just enough to want more, to make waiting worse."</p>

<p>"It'll always be that way," she said. "You've thought about it
as much as I have. You know there's nothing for us but a meeting
here and there, a lot of hiding and scheming and heartache when
things go wrong and we can't meet. I don't dare look glad when I
see you. I can't come to you and put my arms around you. I can't
eat with you, and talk with you and sleep with you all the nights
we've got left. But it's all we have&mdash;we've got to stand it.
What if we didn't have this much?"</p>

<p>"Will you be back in town again?"</p>

<p>"Not soon. I can't make this trip often without George
wondering."</p>

<p>"Then I'll have to come to the settlements."</p>

<p>"Anywhere, anywhere possible," she said. "In the brush, behind
trees, in the mud, anywhere."</p>

<p>"If it worked out...in your cabin?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I won't like it too much, but yes. Does it sound so bad? I
can't help it. Oh, maybe I could, but I don't want to. Whatever I
must do with you, I'll do. Don't you know that someday the
neighbors will get wind of this, if they haven't already?"</p>

<p>"No question about it."</p>

<p>"Well, don't mind it. I'll stand that, too." She rose and came
to him, and he held her and felt the light brushing of her mouth
across his cheek. She was gay again and went into the front room
for her coat and hat.</p>

<p>"I'll walk to the main street with you." At the door he stopped
her and they swung into each other. He thought he was emptied out,
but the pressure began immediately and in a little while they were
at each other with the same roughness as in the beginning. She drew
back her head and laughter bubbled in her throat. A dreamlike
looseness came over her; she closed her eyes, she whispered, "It
never quits. Are we natural, or are we peculiar?"</p>

<p>"We're caught."</p>

<p>"I don't like that word."</p>

<p>"There won't be a time when we're satisfied. I want more of
this. I want more beyond this, beyond the moment, beyond the wall
of your flesh. You'll be tired and marked up tomorrow because I've
pulled at you so hard with my arms. I've tried to break through,
get closer. There's the misery of it. We never get that close."</p>

<p>"You have me, though. There's nothing I want to hold back."</p>

<p>"If our bodies were shadows we could pass into each other and
there'd be one shadow. That would be it. That's what we're trying
to do. If Lot White would quit trying to bring lightning out of
heaven and look around on earth he'd <i>see</i> what God is. This
is God&mdash;you and I trying to make ourselves into one shadow."
He looked down at her with his extreme solemnness. "I love
you."</p>

<p>The lightness left her face, her eyes turned brilliant, her
mouth was unsteady. "Say it again and I'll stay the rest of the
night."</p>

<p>"I'm ready."</p>

<p>Her ease returned. "We must be healthy. Now you know I'm not
delicate. Well, it's good to be honest. It's good. Shall I take off
my hat and coat?"</p>

<p>"Won't do to have you go back to the hotel at five in the
morning."</p>

<p>"You're more cautious than I am."</p>

<p>"That's so."</p>

<p>He accompanied her along the lane, kissed her and watched her go
on through the muddy gloom toward the hotel; she walked on quickly,
paying no attention to the few lighted shops around her or to the
straggling men still abroad and it was that confidence which gave
him the worst blow of the day. She knew, as well as he, that they
could have nothing more than they were having, that no happy end
could come of it. It was a trap which would scar her worse than it
would him; still, she stepped smiling into it. In this matter any
woman was braver than any man.</p>

<h2><a name="ch44" id="ch44"></a>Chapter 44</h2>

<p>HE chipped the log, he grew tired, he put the knife cautiously
into his pocket, he rested a little while and drew out the knife to
work again. Now and then he passed a hand through the forming notch
and stripped back the stringy wood slivers with fingers which had
scarcely any sense of touch remaining. He was increasingly slow in
his handling of the knife, for he worked close to his legs and
risked slashing himself if the knife slipped aside from the wood.
During the longest hours between midnight and first light he
measured what he had done and guessed he had cut two inches into
the tree and at that point he drew himself together and brought his
legs back for another try; but his knees wouldn't come between the
space between log and stone.</p>

<p>The strain got him in the base of his neck and at the small of
his back and the stretched muscles along his legs occasionally
registered twinges of pain. Except for these sensations he was a
man without legs, he was a torso bedded in the mud, a stumplike
animal crouched under the dead-falls, swaying forward and grunting
as he worked. The rain thickened, the wind rose to a roar in the
high trees, and he heard the rifle-shot crack of branches breaking.
A considerable distance above him one tree, ready for such a wind,
came down in a series of splintering explosions; the effect of its
fall trembled through the log jam and shortly afterward a small
wave of water splashed against his back.</p>

<p>He put the knife away, the repeated jabbing turning his arm
lame, and he settled into something which was stupor rather than
sleep. The lesser miseries were blocked out; the greater miseries
got through&mdash;the coldness striking the spots in him which were
still sensitive, the raw aching of his wrists, of his cramped body,
the endless sawing of the water against his flanks. But the
greatest of the miseries was the thought of the trap itself. Though
he knew he could not pull his legs free, the wish to pull them free
grew much worse; unable to lift himself from the water, he had
sudden surges of wild necessity to lift himself. Even in the haze
of his half-conscious state these surges came, to make him struggle
as little as possible, for his energy grew thinner and he needed
all of it to work the knife.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the night he was entirely still and almost
nothing got through, and when later he came out of this coma he saw
the hole above him show its raggedness against first light. He was
wet outside, dry inside. He scooped water with his palm, tasting
the woody mud, he beat his hands together until he began to feel
his fingers return to him individually; and he straightened against
the log and reached for his knife. It wasn't there.</p>

<p>He thought a moment: <i>Don't recall using my other
hand</i>&mdash;but he tried the other pocket. Neither pocket held
the knife. He was still slow-thinking; he pushed the front of the
overcoat aside and tried his inner coat pockets. He searched the
overcoat pockets a second time. Then he was still and his mind
began to work. He ran his hand along the top of the log on the
guess that he might have stuck the knife into it for safety. He
went through his pockets another time; he made each motion
deliberate but the knowledge began to close in. He thrust his hands
straight downward into the mud, reaching as far as he could turn
his body, exploring the mud to the extreme limit of each arm. He
drew them out, washed them in the surface water and returned to his
pockets; and after that fruitless gesture he again churned and
squeezed and sifted the mud between his fingers. Once he thought he
touched the knife handle straight below his left side&mdash;which
was where it should have been if it had fallen from his
pocket&mdash;and he turned until his dead knees woke and he tried
for one more inch of depth and failed to find anything. He washed
his arms around the water; he laid them over his chest.</p>

<p>This creek flowed into another creek which, in turn, came into
the settlement's creek below Lattimore's. He would die, he would
rot, he would float down that creek piece at a time. <i>Might even
make a taste they'll wonder about.</i> He would end up a skeleton
crouched under this log jam; that empty skull pan would see or feel
nothing&mdash;but it would know as much, lifeless, about the sky it
faced as he knew now, alive.</p>

<p>He wasn't like Hawn's trapper who, dying, knew too late what he
should have been and what he should have done. How far out did he
have to get before that came to him?</p>

<p>It was better the way the old man had put it: "The things I
regret are the things I didn't do."</p>

<p>He straightened to the log and got his arms beneath it, now
willing to risk what he hadn't before and collecting his strength
into his arms he tried to unseat the log. If it rolled down on his
legs and broke them, he would at least be free. There was no give
to the log and he lay back and ceased to care. The things a man
regretted were the chances offered and not taken. Refusal was a
drawing back; to take was to move&mdash;and to move was to be
alive. Edna...he could have taken more of her. What did his refusal
amount to, he about to die? One thing not bad. What had he refused?
One more shock of life. Against this outward chill of water and
wind and against the inner chill of death, the warmth of her body
was a strong thing. But his turning mind went away from her and he
remembered Katherine crouched by the fire, intent on its mysteries,
and then he had the feeling of a man who, walking steadily toward a
city at the end of a long day, watched darkness cover the city, and
in the dark he took the wrong trail and never saw the city
again.</p>

<p>He watched day grow dismally through the hole above him. He rose
and once again tried to pull his feet clear and had no luck and
settled back. The cold crept deeper into him, the walls went down
one by one; but the central place was still intact, for his heart
beat steady and he had no idea of letting his mind make an early
surrender.</p>

<p><i>Who said the gate was up there in that cold empty stuff? We
live here&mdash;our work's here, but we stand frozen and throw
foolish questions at the sky. When I get out of here I'll ask no
more questions. The gate's down here. Look down, look around. It's
all here.</i>
</p>

<p>Once again he tried to pull his legs through the hole and felt
the smallest possible streak of pain come to him from his knees;
and afterwards he began to pluck at the splinters of the log with
fingers which had no sensation. <i>Better that way. I'll dig this
thing out with my hands. Won't feel a thing when the flesh strips
off.</i></p>

<p><br>
<br>
Hawn heard the bellow of the cows when he came down the trail
around noon that day; he turned in and noticed there had been no
fire in the cabin during the morning. Burnett's saddle horse was in
the meadow but his gun and powder flask were gone from the wall.
Hawn milked the cows and cut a short circle around the yard's edge
to see what he might discover in the way of tracks; on the
rain-washed earth nothing was to be found. He beat about the timber
where Burnett had been cutting road and saw that the stump fires
were dead. From there he walked to Lattimore's.</p>

<p>"No," said Lattimore. "Ain't seen him. Come to think, didn't
hear his ax in the timber yesterday either."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't walk off from the cows that long," said Hawn, "and
them stump fires are too damned hard to start for him to let 'em
die. Horse is home, gun's gone."</p>

<p>"If he'd meant to leave he'd told me about the cows," said
Lattimore. "If his gun's gone he went on a hunt and got delayed.
Couldn't be too far, because he went on foot."</p>

<p>"Sounds like an accident. Which way you think he'd go to
hunt?"</p>

<p>"Don't know."</p>

<p>"I'll cross to Millard's," said Hawn. "I'll move out that way
and hit the settlers and see if I can find anybody that saw him.
You go straight down the trail and ask. Go over to Lord's too. If I
don't find anything I'll come back and we'll see if we can't catch
his trail back of the cabin."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lattimore, listening to this talk, tossed up her hands, "Oh
God, he's dead! Lockyear's killed him&mdash;I know. He's dead, all
bloody in the brush somewhere&mdash;Oh God, poor Rice!" She went
crying into the house. Lattimore cast a sidewise glance at
Hawn.</p>

<p>"Females," he grumbled, "they get so God-damned wrought up."
Rain stung through the thin cotton of his shirt, his ramshackle
body shivered. He went into the house, got a coat and came out.
"But she could be right about that," he said and moved down the
trail.</p>

<p>Hawn crossed the creek to Millard's, found no news of Burnett
there, and passed on to Mercer's, Monteith's and Kern's. Howard
Kern said: "I'll go down to McIver's and Crabtree's. You go
straight on as far as Ebbett's. Come back this way."</p>

<p>Hawn crossed the ridge to Rinearson's and continued to the
Kitchen cabin. There was no news there and none at Lige Ebbett's.
Ebbett said, "He ain't ever hunted on this side of the ridge." Then
he said, "I'll walk back with you," and picked up his gun and went
along. Returning to Rinearson's, Hawn found Old Daniel ready with
Ared. "I sent Moss down to Shafer's place. They'll go to the ford
and come up to Lattimore's and meet us." As he retraced his route,
Hawn found men waiting for him and when they discovered he had no
news they ducked into their cabins, came out with guns and coats
and joined the party. He had fifteen settlers by the time he
reached Lattimore's.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lattimore said, "Everybody's gone on to Burnett's." At
Burnett's all the men of the lower settlement were gathered. Hawn
counted twenty-five in the meadow. Katherine Gay was with them.</p>

<p>Lot White came back from a private search of the upper trail. "I
don't see any tracks."</p>

<p>"You couldn't read a track anyhow," said Old Daniel. He pointed
to Hawn. "That's this man's business. If we all get to trampin'
around the brush nobody's goin' to find anything. Let Bob run this.
What you want us to do?"</p>

<p>"It looks like he went huntin' afoot," said Hawn, "though why
he'd do it on a day like yesterday, I don't know. He didn't go
down-trail and didn't go up-trail. I looked both ways. So he
must've gone into the brush, this side of the creek&mdash;or the
other side." He looked across the creek and shook his head. "Not
there. You couldn't break a way through that stuff with a
cannon."</p>

<p>Billy Lord said: "He hunts them draws over there," and pointed
to the hill directly beyond the meadow. "Because he's come out of
'em by my place a lot of times."</p>

<p>"Stay here," said Hawn and crossed the meadow. The settlers
waited before Burnett's cabin&mdash;their bodies pulled together
against the steady rain&mdash;and watched Hawn reach the brushy
edge of the hill and go along it at a fast walk, bent over, intent
on his reading.</p>

<p>"Like a hound dog," said Rinearson. "He knows his business."</p>

<p>Harris Eby looked at his watch. "Two o'clock. We better find
something&mdash;she'll be dark in three more hours."</p>

<p>"Well, he couldn't go too damned far," said Provost. "He'd not
want to pack a deer more'n a couple miles through that
country."</p>

<p>"Wish we had some whisky. He might require a shot of it."</p>

<p>"We'll take along some coffee," said McIver, and entered
Burnett's cabin to get it.</p>

<p>"You'll play hell lighting a fire up there," said Mercer. That
comment brought a notion to Harris Eby and he crossed to the shed
and rummaged around for pitchwood. He found a chunk of it and
shaved small splinters from it and put the splinters in his shirt
pocket and buttoned his coat. Hawn, ducking in and out of the
brush, disappeared from their view.</p>

<p>Lattimore said: "Lockyear keeps runnin' through my mind."</p>

<p>Rinearson said: "There's no question but what Rice has had an
accident. He wouldn't leave his stock neglected. He's been out in
this stuff all night. If he's alive he's in poor shape."</p>

<p>"He knows how to take care of himself," said Monteith. "He's a
good man."</p>

<p>"A God-damn' good man," said Rinearson.</p>

<p>Hawn's cry from the brush moved the settlers over the meadow. He
had found a trail and had gone part way up the hill's slope. "Come
on single file&mdash;don't get ahead of me and bust up these
tracks."</p>

<p>"New tracks?" asked Rinearson.</p>

<p>"Can't say. Rain's been at 'em."</p>

<p>He worked his way through the wet brush, showering water behind
him; limbs slashed at the party and Billy Lord grumbled, "World
never was made for a big man." The slope was steep, the ground
slick; the party lagged and stumbled and drew deep for wind. Hawn
walked the hill in long strides, upper body so tilted that his face
skimmed the rising ground, and he made his darting turns as the
trail bent, and jumped over logs and went straining on. The party
fell behind him; the thicket crashed to their bodies. "Christ's
sake," called Lorenzo Buck, "where's he at now?" A little later the
column overtook him. He was at a standstill, studying the forks of
the trail in a light that grew duller and duller.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said and vanished.</p>

<p>They heard him rustling around the huckleberry and vine maple
and dead branches somewhere forward; they heard him quietly curse
himself. He came back, eyes pinned to the earth. Rinearson stood in
his way; he gave the older man a quick push and went into another
blind part of the timber, beating a noisy way downslope; in a short
time he returned and led them on. The trail quit and the way
forward was extremely rough, over breast-high logs, winding between
great fir trunks, dropping into deep pits. Rinearson lost sight of
Hawn. "Where you at now?"</p>

<p>"Here," said Hawn from the shadow of a tree ten feet away.</p>

<p>"My God, I'd hate to have you on my trail."</p>

<p>Hawn turned from the crest of the ridge, towing the column into
the ravine, and at the foot of the ravine he caught some kind of
trace that pleased him and he tackled the side of the next ridge in
the same bent-over shape. He waited impatiently for the column to
reach him. He looked into the adjoining ravine and lifted his voice
and sent a great hail forward. "Ayee-ee-oo-o-oo&mdash;Burnett!"
Sound whirled around them, fled off through the corridors and broke
into separate echoes. He turned his head, listening, receiving
nothing back but the rain and the wind and the rasping breath of
the men around him. He got on his knees and crawled downslope a few
yards. "Light's gettin' bad," he said. He disappeared and long
afterwards called to them. "Come on&mdash;straight down."</p>

<p>"Now, by God, I'm lost," said Durbin Young.</p>

<p>They worked their way after him, using arms and elbows to fend
off the sharp brush. Hawn swung and came upon a trace and he
dropped to all fours, head low, rump high, to stare at the mud. He
got up and reached the creek, facing the tangle of logs which
carpeted the ravine's bottom. It was then so gray that the features
of the men around him were indistinct. "He must of crossed over,"
grumbled Hawn, "but we got to scout back and forth to find where he
went through the brush. God damn, I don't know what brought him
this far. Wait."</p>

<p>He parted the brush and came to the log jam; he stepped on a
small log, slipped and plunged feet foremost into the mud; a minor
storm of broken stuff fell around him and he came cursing up and
found another log and crawled over it. By now the shadows had
blackened enough to swallow him forty feet distant.</p>

<p>He called back: "Dead buck here. Shot. One of you fellows fire a
gun."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said Eby. He drew up his rifle, sheltering it
while he poured powder into the pan. The shot, condensed between
the ravine walls, roared around them.</p>

<p>"That ought to reach to hell and gone," said Rinearson; then
everybody stood stone-still.</p>

<p>There was the ruffle of wind above, the spatting of rain on the
brush, the gurgling of the creek beneath the log jam; there were
these sounds but no sound from Burnett.</p>

<p>The settlers struggled through the brush and came to the tangle
of logs and men crawled out upon the logs and stood indecisive in
the growing dark. Hawn moved back and forth, murmuring his
unhappiness to himself. "He came here. There's the buck. What'd he
leave it for? Damn my soul, I wish it was light." He let go with
his chesty call. "Yah-ee-e-o-oo-o&mdash;Burnett!" He reached the
end of a log, jumped to another, disappeared in the far brush,
rattled around it, and returned. Some other settler, drifting over
the debris, lost his footing and went down through the logs with an
alarmed yell. He scrambled back and came over to firm ground.</p>

<p>Lattimore said: "We ain't goin' to find anything and there's no
use standing around here."</p>

<p>Daniel Rinearson's voice went at him. "We'll stay out here, by
God, till we get him. You got the pitch, Harris. Light up a
fire."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Hawn. He jumped from log to another. He spoke
quietly. "Burnett&mdash;where you at? Burnett&mdash;sing out."</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>The settlers rushed forward, all shouting at once. Hawn yelled
at them. "Stand still a minute. Where&mdash;where you at, Burnett?"
He crouched on a log and slapped it with his hand. "Above
me&mdash;below me?"</p>

<p>"Little farther. Under the logs."</p>

<p>Hawn worked his way through the tangle and dropped from sight
and in a moment his voice called out of the darkness. "All right,
boys. He's here."</p>

<p>The settlers moved in. Lot White wrestled a way through the
matted dead stuff and crouched by Burnett. Harris Eby crawled
forward to smash the litter aside. "Broken leg?"</p>

<p>"I just woke up," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"Slept well, no doubt," said Rinearson.</p>

<p>"Nothing's broke. Legs caught under this thing."</p>

<p>Eby scrambled over the log, big body sinking into the loose mud
until his feet located the log and the stone and discovered how the
trap was set. Men edged forward, hopping from log to log, beating
their way through the tangle, dropping through the interstices.
They made a ring around this place and flung their advice briskly
back and forth. Lot White called: "We got to get some axes."</p>

<p>"No," said Harris, "there's hands enough to lift it. This is the
log. See what's on top of it&mdash;and move that stuff away. Then
we'll budge this thing."</p>

<p>They crowded forward, blocked each other on the narrow walkway
of the logs, made useless motions in their desire to be helpful.
"Over here, lend a land."</p>

<p>"We got to have a pry for this one."</p>

<p>"Billy, God damn it, don't roll that thing till I get out of
here."</p>

<p>In the pit, Hawn and Lot White got their arms beneath Burnett to
cradle him above the water. Burnett murmured, "Don't lift me too
high. Legs are caught."</p>

<p>"Say when you feel the strain on 'em," said Hawn.</p>

<p>"Can't feel. Bob, recall the beaver you trapped? I been a beaver
in a trap. Know just what they think. Damned nice of you men to
come."</p>

<p>"Why," said Lot White, "you think we'd let the devil take one of
our own? Lean on me, boy. We got the devil on the run now."</p>

<p>"You're all right, Lot."</p>

<p>Lot grumbled. "Old Lot&mdash;he's all right&mdash;he hollers and
he whoops and folks smile at the old fool&mdash;but he means
well&mdash;he's all right. Lean on me, boy. Don't use your
strength, use mine. I got muscle if I ain't got sense."</p>

<p>"Anything hurt you?" asked Hawn.</p>

<p>"No. A little tired, a little cold."</p>

<p>It was around five o'clock then. At nine the column returned to
the meadow, dog-weary and wet. Burnett, an arm about Eby and an arm
about Lot White, swung his feet and half supported himself as he
walked.</p>

<p>Katherine ran from the cabin. "Rice..." she said and bent in to
catch sight of his face. "Rice&mdash;what...?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing," he said.</p>

<p>She stood aside to let Eby and White carry him into the cabin.
She called, "Get those wet clothes off him." She remained outside,
watching the settlers straggle through the night toward their
cabins; she heard their thin talk waver and sink in the distance.
Eby came out a little later. "He was in water, dropped under a log,
since two-three o'clock yesterday. Lot will stay."</p>

<p>"I'm staying."</p>

<p>"I know that," he said. "But he'll stay in case you need to send
for something."</p>

<p>"I've got coffee. Come in."</p>

<p>"No," he said, and looked at her. "That's too damned many
people," he added, and went away.</p>

<p>She stepped into the cabin and crossed to the bed. Burnett lay
on his back; his face was whisker-black, the bleakness of his
experience hadn't thawed from his features.</p>

<p>"Coffee, Rice?"</p>

<p>"Make a tub of it."</p>

<p>She turned to Lot. "You bring in all the wood you can find. I'm
going to keep this room hot till hot won't have it, all night." She
poured the coffee and came to the bed with it and found he had
closed his eyes. She waited a moment, then said, "Rice," gently,
and saw that he was asleep. She put the coffee away and stood
watching him. Lot White, coming in with a load of wood, noticed the
change and settled the wood quietly on the floor. "It must have
seemed a long time to him," she said.</p>

<p>"God saved him," said Lot. She turned her head from him, but he
was an inquisitive man and he bent to catch sight of her face and
saw tears in her eyes. "Sometimes," he said, "it means something,
don't it? I don't know why folks are so blind and deaf that they
got to be beaten and tortured and crippled before they'll let the
Word come in. I don't know why they cry for mercy when they are
sick, and forget it when they're well. You're a proud and healthy
girl and you give it no thought till this man's hurts make you see.
Now, then, girl&mdash;you ought to give thanks."</p>

<p>"I do, Lot."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you ought to get right on your knees in the middle of
this room and let God see you humble and say so out loud."</p>

<p>"Maybe," she said, "people give thanks in different ways, and
maybe people think of God in different ways. I don't see a face and
a figure the way you do. I think of mercy and kindness and pity and
understanding and love."</p>

<p>"Words," he said. "Words. Everybody says those words. Everybody
believes those words when the believin' is easy. If words made
heaven we'd all have heaven. But till man humbles himself openly in
the eyes of the Lord those words ain't strong enough. Pride keeps
you off your knees, daughter. You don't want to look foolish to me.
Pride makes men fight, they don't want to look foolish to others.
Pride&mdash;that's the devil, too. We believe but we don't believe
enough. Till we cast this pride away and believe one thing so much
we feel no shame to kneel and confess before all men, till this
comes we're sinners bound for hell. You know why we're sinners?
Because we ain't got strength to do in the sight of all men what we
believe in our hearts."</p>

<p>"Lot," she said, "sometimes you say things which go against
other things you say."</p>

<p>"God is a wind which bloweth everywhere, and night is day, and
day is night."</p>

<p>"Why did you go up to fight the Indians?"</p>

<p>"I only know what the spirit tells me. And the spirit said, 'Go
fight the heathen.'"</p>

<p>"Bring in some more wood."</p>

<p>He tramped silently back and forth with his loads of wood until
he had a corner of the cabin filled. She said: "You want me to cook
you something?"</p>

<p>"No," he said and drank his coffee, and stood at the fire with
his stubborn face bemusea. Now and then he looked at her as if to
renew the argument; at times he seemed solemn and depressed and he
made small motions with his hands to accent the silent words going
around his busy head. He drew a great sigh and turned to the door.
"I'll be in the shed should you want me."</p>

<p>"Good night, Lot."</p>

<p>"Good night, daughter."</p>

<p>After he had gone she pulled the blankets around Burnett's neck
and lightly ran her fingers across his forehead to brush away the
drying mud. Color hadn't yet come to his face; it remained sallow.
She settled on her knees, laid her arms across him and had thoughts
which, in their way, were prayers. When this was done she rose and
took Burnett's clothes and hung them before the fire. She spread
her coat on the floor and settled on it and, half waking and half
asleep, passed the night.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch45" id="ch45"></a>Chapter 45</h2>

<p>HE was cheerful next morning and breakfast lifted him with the
quickness of a drink of whisky. He said to Katherine, "You go
outside while I put my clothes on." The rain had stopped and now
the meadow exhaled this wetness as a thick, crystal-sparkling mist
so rank with the odor of earth that it was a taste at the back of
her mouth as she walked abroad. This was early March when,
according to her memory of the east, the land was still lifeless,
but here the yeast was working and ferment was around her and the
fog of it came up like smoke to make its dense pall which erased
hill and timber; from the distance of a hundred feet she looked
back to see the cabin enveloped in this drifting steam. She heard
the cows at the fence and she went to the shed for the pail and
milked them. Presently Lot called her to the cabin.</p>

<p>Burnett was in bed and in poor humor. "Damned legs like rubber.
They bend."</p>

<p>They pained him now, she noticed, for he turned them slowly, he
shifted, he showed a cranky expression; his face was flushed and
his eyes were heavy. Lot said: "What you think you're made of? You
imagine you can sit in the middle of a creek thirty hours and
bounce around like a ball?"</p>

<p>"He needs a bath," said Katherine. "Where's your tub, Rice?"</p>

<p>"I use the creek."</p>

<p>Lot said, "I'll fetch Lattimore's." He was back in half an hour
with a big half-keg into which Katherine poured a kettle of boiling
water. Lot lugged several buckets from the creek to temper it and
Katherine went to the shed and stayed there for half an hour. Lot,
when he called her in, was dripping wet. "I had to hold him in the
tub. His legs are half dead." Burnett lay with his hands over his
eyes; the pain had grown worse. Katherine swept the puddled floor
and set on a fresh pot of coffee to boil while Lot emptied the tub.
He said, "I'll be back this afternoon," and went away with his
burden.</p>

<p>She settled on a chair beside the bed. "Can you feel your toes,
Rice?"</p>

<p>"On fire."</p>

<p>She put the chair at the foot of the bed and shoved the blankets
away from his feet and rubbed them. "Chilblains. What happened up
there?"</p>

<p>"A log broke on me when I started across the creek. I went down
and the log pinned me."</p>

<p>"Suppose," she said, "the search party hadn't found you?"</p>

<p>"I'd've had to drink the creek dry to get out of it."</p>

<p>She was thoughtful. "We're not very strong. A thousand accidents
can kill us. A log, a rock, a little bit of fire, a minute under
water, a cut on the wrist&mdash;just a small blow on the head. It
makes me feel like an ant with the shadow of a big foot over
me."</p>

<p>"That's what Lot would say."</p>

<p>"I know. He talked to me last night."</p>

<p>"He talked to me all the time he washed me, asked a lot of
questions. What did I feel when I was there, what did I think
about, was I humble, was I afraid? Did I hear anything from
beyond?"</p>

<p>"Did you have time to think about very much?" she asked and went
on with her rubbing.</p>

<p>"Mostly it was, 'How do I get out of here.' When that petered
out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean you decided you wouldn't?"</p>

<p>"So long as I had a knife to dig away at the log with, I figured
I'd make it. When I lost the knife in the mud, I knew it was a
close thing."</p>

<p>"Then what did you think about? All the things you shouldn't
have done?"</p>

<p>He shaded his eyes with his hand. "All the things I didn't do.
And I said that if I had this to do over again I'd not ask a lot of
foolish questions that have got no answers."</p>

<p>She smiled, "Oh, Rice," she said, and in a moment they were both
laughing. "Don't tell Lot that. It would hurt his feelings."</p>

<p>She laid the covers over his feet and drew the coffee from the
fire and brought him a cup.</p>

<p>He sat up to drink it and he relished it thoroughly and lay
back. "This business of waiting to get to heaven to lead a happy
life spoils too much here. It's like a traveler eating a meal so
fast he don't taste it because he's got to catch a train. That
coffee's damned good." He shifted on the bed and grew irritable.
"The stump fires are out, the road's a long ways from done. So's
the mill. It'll be time to plow when the weather changes. And here
I am, wasting time."</p>

<p>She looked down at him smiling. "You see, Rice? You think of
tomorrow same as Lot thinks of heaven. Tomorrow&mdash;but not
what's here right now." She walked to the fire and stood before it,
her back to him. "Lot White's not the same. He's
troubled&mdash;he's kinder. I wonder why?"</p>

<p>"Maybe something jarred him out of the notion that everything's
so damned simple. I like him better. He's doing these chores for me
as though it gave him pleasure."</p>

<p>She came back to sit beside the bed. "It does give him pleasure.
Don't you know he's a humble man, even when he seems most positive?
He knows people laugh at him sometimes. That would humiliate you or
me, so it must humiliate him sometimes. But he goes on doing these
things, hoping we'll see something by his example. What do you want
to eat?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you can find."</p>

<p>"I'll fix it pretty soon."</p>

<p>"This settlement," he said, "is a peculiar thing. We're all
inside a circle. We have got to act alike, think alike. I was an
unpopular man for not going along to fight the Molalas. We all bend
the same direction; if anybody tries to bend against the rest, he's
squeezed into shape. But when the crowd came up to find me, I saw
the other side of it. If somebody gets lost outside the circle
everybody else fights like hell to get him back in. We do bad
things to each other, but we hang together against the thing that
tries to kill us. We're killed in the long run&mdash;but we don't
stand alone."</p>

<p>He was drowsy and closed his eyes. "It would be better, though,
if this community didn't use its will like a whip on people that
don't think the way it thinks."</p>

<p>"Maybe it knows we'll only hurt ourselves if we try to be as
free as we'd like to be. The older people have been through it.
They've been in love. They've been strong, they wanted to do as
they pleased. When we get to be fifty, will we hate the rules that
bother us now?"</p>

<p>"I won't waste much time thinking about that. When I'm an old
man I'll act like one. Right now it's a good feeling to be alive,
taste water, do some work, kiss a woman."</p>

<p>"You want that now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She bent down to kiss him. In a moment he was asleep.</p>

<p>She pulled the blankets about his shoulders and watched pain's
uneasiness stir his flushed face. In summer, when he had his place
fixed, his mill started and his first crop harvested, he would turn
to her; there was that much of the methodical mixed in with his
restlessness. It was coming. He wouldn't live alone and he had got
closer to her in the past weeks. If she encouraged him more, it
might come sooner. He would think, when he asked her, that he loved
her; but Edna was the woman most mixed up in his emotions and she
was still there. Part of it, Katherine suspected, was a feeling of
obligation he owed Edna for what she had given him; the rest of it
was Rice's own creation, for he was a powerful dreamer and he had
made Edna into the image of his wishes. Most men dreamed things
into women; this was the way they got married. The hard thing with
Rice was that though he had perhaps begun to know Edna was not all
he had thought, he couldn't put her from his mind and move
immediately to another woman. He couldn't swing lightly from dream
to dream.</p>

<p>She bent forward, watching him with her patience. She thought:
<i>How do I change you?</i></p>

<p>He was still asleep when Mrs. Millard came in with a basket
covered by a towel. "Mrs. Rinearson sent some biscuits and here's a
dab of that plum jelly left. He all right?" She sent her curious
glance about the room, she looked at Rice and at Katherine. "You
been here all night?"</p>

<p>"Lot's been here with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean that," said Mrs. Millard indifferently. The
two stepped into the yard to talk. "Some men are like stumps. They
sit and rot away and nothin' ever happens to 'em. But some are
lightning rods that draw things. The stumps ain't very interesting
to live with, but the lightning rods cause you misery." She shook
her head at Katherine. "Poor child&mdash;poor child. All that
you've got to learn&mdash;all that you've got to bear."</p>

<p>"What would you have done with your life if you'd not married
Millard?" asked Katherine.</p>

<p>"Married somebody else."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;what other thing do you think would have been
better?"</p>

<p>"Better&mdash;better," said Mrs. Millard, impatiently. "This is
no world for better. Katherine, you ought to take a trip to Oregon
City, just for the visit. Ain't Eby goin' that way sometime?"</p>

<p>Katherine smiled, whereupon Mrs. Millard pointed into the cabin
and shook her head. "Wait on him, then, hand and foot. Be a slave.
Waste your time while he plays God and makes up his mind. No, you
go away and see how quick he ain't God any more." She crossed the
meadow and followed the trail through the trees and hadn't quite
got to Lattimore's when she met Lot White, he bound back to
Burnett's.</p>

<p>"You don't need to hurry," she said. "They're all right."</p>

<p>"Fine&mdash;fine," he said. He was never certain of Mrs.
Millard's disposition and never inclined to test it. "How's
Millard?" he asked and stirred his body around to indicate he
wanted to be on his way.</p>

<p>"Come over and visit. He needs company."</p>

<p>"I will," he said. "I'll come tomorrow and console him."</p>

<p>She surprised him with a smile; she took his arm and turned him
about. "No, you come now." He had no ready excuse and so he went
along with her and settled into a chair beside Millard's bed and
made himself agreeable. During the middle of the afternoon he rose
to go, but Mrs. Millard urged him to remain and got him on a line
of talk which occupied him until dark. When he rose again she
insisted that he stay for supper; it was beyond seven when he left
the cabin. Millard swung his guns on her as soon as the guest was
well beyond earshot.</p>

<p>"My God, what'd I have to put up with that for?"</p>

<p>"Well, you're lonely."</p>

<p>"Not that lonely. What've you got in your mind now?"</p>

<p>"Better those two were left to themselves awhile."</p>

<p>He gave out a strong laugh. "If that's what you're after, you
ought to've had Lot stay here all night." Growing serious, he gave
the problem some thought, and disagreed with her. "It won't work.
They both got firm minds."</p>

<p>"Firm minds can be changed," she said. "It's comin' anyhow, but
it ought to come sooner than it is. He might see some other girl,
half as good but twice as bold like Durbin Young's girl&mdash;and
that would be too bad. That Katherine, I don't know why she don't
help herself. It's clear to me she's waiting for him. And it's so
easy. He's a man. He's vain. It wouldn't take anything at all to
stir the animal in him."</p>

<p>"My God, Nancy, you think it's always a man fallin' into some
damned trap a woman sets?"</p>

<p>"They're all the same. Before marriage they got to be encouraged
because they're mortally afraid of being tied down. Afterwards they
got to be subdued because they get too overbearing."</p>

<p>"If women really believe that," he said, "I wonder why they
bother about gettin' married at all."</p>

<p>She swung on him. "That's just what you'd like, too. A new one
every night. No responsibility&mdash;just sleep and run. Oh, you'd
love it. That's why we play our tricks&mdash;because it's a man's
world we're trapped in and we got to play tricks or we'd have
nothing. Millard, don't say things to make me so angry."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Katherine woke him for his meal and found him cheerful; she cleaned
the dishes and stood at the doorway to catch the air, and felt his
restlessness accumulate.</p>

<p>"Your father better?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"When I was arguing with the boys about going up to fight the
Molalas I thought of him. I did a bad job. He could have talked
them out of it."</p>

<p>"You know what he wanted to be when he was younger? A musician.
But he had no schooling and no way of getting it. One time he said
something that made me feel bad, because I knew it came right from
himself. He said nobody'd ever know how many people might have
changed the world with their good ideas if they'd been able to
learn enough to get the good out. That's why he's so strong-minded
about schools." She was at the doorway, watching the meadow. She
turned back to seize her coat and shawl, saying, "I'm going over to
Millard's for a while," and abruptly left him. Down the meadow he
heard voices and in a moment Edna came into the cabin.</p>

<p>She moved on to the bed and her close look said, "Remember?" and
brought back what had been between them. She removed her coat and
settled on the edge of the bed. She said,
"Whiskers&mdash;whiskers," and rubbed her hand across his jaw and
bent to kiss him and rested heavy on him. "What were you doing up
in the hills anyway? Just walking to keep walking? I know why. If
I'd been here, you'd not gone. I could keep you home."</p>

<p>"You could keep anybody home."</p>

<p>She raised back from him, laughing. "I know it," she said and
ceased to laugh. "You mean a lot of things by that. You always
thought a lot of things about me." She looked around the room. "She
been here all day?"</p>

<p>"All day&mdash;all night."</p>

<p>"Damn you," she said and was angry. "What'd she leave for? She
don't like me. Is it so easy for you to change? From me to
her?"</p>

<p>"Stop that."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "she's no different than I am."</p>

<p>"Stop it."</p>

<p>"But you think she is. You always thought so. Where'd you get
such funny ideas about women?"</p>

<p>"Where's Moss?"</p>

<p>"Cutting a road between our place and the old man's."</p>

<p>"Everything all right?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "I guess so." She brushed the
subject aside, impatient with it. "Why have we got to talk about
that? You don't care."</p>

<p>"Better not come here any more."</p>

<p>She rose and moved to the doorway and looked upon the meadow a
moment. She came back to settle beside him. "You want me?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>She tapped a finger on her chest. "That's what I can do." She
waited for him to speak again and presently whispered her
encouragement. "All right."</p>

<p>"It won't do. Why don't you let go?"</p>

<p>She darkened and grew sullen. "I'm not holding you. Let go
yourself if you want," but she bent down. "I can't help it, Rice.
It's not all my fault. It's as much yours as mine."</p>

<p>"I know," he said.</p>

<p>She straightened, her face catching up a keener attention.
"Well, there's no use worrying about it. I don't believe much in
thinking about things. We can't take a knife and cut it out of us.
It's there&mdash;let it stay there. It's good, isn't it?" She
lowered herself. "I miss you."</p>

<p>He said: "You going to come back here every month to remind me?
It won't do."</p>

<p>She lifted herself from the bed. "Won't do&mdash;won't do," she
said, and went around the room, touching the table, touching the
walls. She stopped in the corner of the cabin and kept her sidewise
glance on him. "You're afraid."</p>

<p>He turned on the bed. "What do you want? Make up your mind."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "it's always that. Everything's got to have a
reason, got to be this or got to be that. Things aren't like that.
They just are. God, Rice, how can you be cold, how can you not want
me? You started it. You want me to change, like it never happened?
I won't, and neither will you." She moved back to him. "You marry
that Katherine and I'll never leave you alone. You see. You won't
be free from me. She'll know it, too. She'll know it when you sleep
together. What's she? Ah, Rice&mdash;nothing. But she's made you
think there's a difference and that's what made it bad between us
and made me go marry Moss." She stooped to lay her mouth against
him with a groaning sound and she kissed him and whispered, "I
shouldn't have married him. I know it now." She rose, got her coat
and shawl, flung them carelessly on and moved to the door. She
swung to watch him and the keen look came back to her and her
shoulders rose in a gesture of confidence at what she saw. She
said, "I'll see you again," and smiled to herself as she left the
cabin. Reaching the trail she paused to throw a glance in the
direction of Lockyear's place. Her expression tightened. In a
moment she turned homeward.</p>

<p>She was in the room long after she had gone; she was a heaviness
around him. He rolled on his side and pushed his feet to the floor
and sat on the bed's edge to put an experimental pressure against
his legs; they were stiff and painful and his bruised knees ached.
She wouldn't leave him and he couldn't leave her. He stood up and
stepped over to his clothes and sat in a chair and dressed himself.
He was at the fireplace when Katherine returned.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rice&mdash;don't be foolish."</p>

<p>He was out of sorts with himself. "These feet were made to stand
on&mdash;and I'm going to stand on 'em till they get well or buckle
up. There's too much to do around here to waste time in bed."</p>

<p>She said: "There's a piece of steak in the Dutch oven."</p>

<p>"Where you going?"</p>

<p>"Home."</p>

<p>He came over to her with his ragged temper in his eyes and
reached about her with his arms and kissed her. She swayed back but
he hung on and she let him have his way for a little while and
broke clear. "It wasn't as good as the other time," she said and
left the cabin, walking thoughtfully home. She knew. <i>That damned
woman,</i> she thought. Fury built up as she moved through the dark
trees, and it kept on past Lattimore's, Provost's and Irish's. By
that time it began to settle and her patience came back. <i>How do
I change him?</i></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch46" id="ch46"></a>Chapter 46</h2>

<p>HAWN made his way through the brush and stumps of Burnett's road
work a week later to say so-long. "I'll be gone a week. Take
anything I got at the cabin you need."</p>

<p>"Which way you headed?"</p>

<p>Hawn only said, "Just prowlin'," and departed. At the ford he
paused a moment to visit with Mrs. Irish, then crossed the creek
and soon put Rinearson's and Ebbett's behind him. All he carried
was gun, powder flask and possible sack. That day he passed over
Waldo's hills and camped beside the Santiam and lay back from his
campfire with his pipe, recapturing for a moment the wildness of
this land as he had first known it. This far south no settlers had
yet penetrated and he thought to himself, "This would be good for a
year or two, till they come. Then move another fifty miles and
squat till they catch up. Just keep a little ahead, until I'm an
old man, and then it won't matter." He crossed the river next
morning, found an Indian trail leading southeastward beside the
river and toward noon came to the old camp in which he had first
seen Louisa. There was nothing here now, only the brush growing
where the village had been, and after a short pause for sentimental
reflection he moved on, found a fresher trail and pursued it
through fern and timber and across fire-scarred meadows, and so
eventually caught sight of the village squatted beside a creek.</p>

<p>It was the old man's village, Louisa's old man. It looked
smaller than the other village had looked five years
before&mdash;only a dozen brush-and-skin lodges lined between water
and woods. White man did that, Hawn thought. White man with his
whisky, with his guns; with nothing more than his smell in the
country he did it. He saw a group of squaws crouched at the creek,
at the far end of the camp, and he saw the old man walk from the
tent with a long-legged young man. They both came forward, the old
man squinting between swollen red eyes, the young man's glance
unfriendly. The young man had a gun.</p>

<p>The old man said, in jargon: "I will keep the horses. It is not
my fault if you don't keep the woman."</p>

<p>It was the swap the old man was thinking about, the horses
traded for Louisa five years ago.</p>

<p>"I don't want the horses," said Hawn. "I want the woman."</p>

<p>The young man broke into talk and spoke a long while to the old
man and stepped a pace backward and kept his black eyes on Hawn.
The old man shook his head, answered the young man with one
sentence, and said to Hawn: "Beat her if you want her to go home. I
will not beat her if she wants to stay." He pointed to the
tent.</p>

<p>Hawn walked the length of the camp, pushed aside the tent's flap
and found Louisa crouched at the far side. Her arms were clasped
around her body, her face was dirty and her hair ragged; she looked
at the ground and wouldn't raise her eyes.</p>

<p>"We will go home now," said Hawn.</p>

<p>She said nothing; she sat stone-still with her downcast eyes.
She was beyond the boundary, so far beyond it that he knew he would
never reach her. Clothes and face and manner&mdash;she wasn't the
Louisa he had known. He said: "The cabin is empty."</p>

<p>She had no answer. He settled before her and reached out to
catch and lift her chin, compelling her glance. Her eyes were dead
for him, her mouth tight against him; no stranger could have given
him a look of greater emptiness. He drew his hand away.</p>

<p>"Louisa," he said, and made a gouging motion before his chest,
"your fingers went in there. I have no heart. You took it. We will
go home."</p>

<p>Had she been a white woman, he might have found words to
persuade her; but she was the purest of Indian in her thinking, and
he had no way of reaching her. In her eyes he had failed her, he
had ceased to want her, he had ceased to be proud of her; and when
she believed this to be so, she ceased to value him. Neither
recognition nor feeling got through the walled expression and as he
rose to lay a hand on her head he had a sudden feeling of sickness;
for her hair was gritty with dirt and he realized that she, the
neatest of women, had let it become so; in a way it was her act of
mourning. He left the tent and walked through camp to the trail The
old man watched him go; the young man had disappeared.</p>

<p>Directly beyond camp the trail entered timber. Passing through
the forming shadows he heard a small rustle of brush behind him and
he turned to see the young man step from the brush, gun lifted and
aimed dead on him. He took a sharp step aside but the gun's muzzle
followed and he saw the muzzle jump upward at the same moment he
felt the bullet strike and knock him down. He turned on the soft
earth, blinded, and he groped for his gun and felt his hand lose
its power. In the distance he heard a woman's scream. He ceased to
care about the gun. He made one more turn, catching the soft
rushing of feet toward him, and directly before he died he felt
Louisa's hands on him and he heard Louisa crying.</p>

<h2><a name="ch47" id="ch47"></a>Chapter 47</h2>

<p>IT seemed like spring, but this was now country of which the
settlers had no certain knowledge. In doubtful mind they brought
out their plows and made test furrows across their fields and
crumbled the damp earth in their hands and watched the sky, and
visited back and forth to swap their opinions. The winter wheat was
new-green in the fields, but wheat was hardy. The spuds ought to go
in, but they had too little potato seed to risk it rotting in a
premature planting; as for garden stuff, one good frost could kill.
Presently the more venturesome went at it, and soon everywhere in
the settlement men were rolling the gloss-black coils back from
their moldboards, and harrowing and dragging and casting seed, and
many a woman, hungry for the relief from waiting, took up a shovel
to break her own garden plot.</p>

<p>Katherine dug the great fat angleworms from her shovel chunks
and marveled at them in her hand. It was wonderful soil. They had
been warned about deer working at the gardens and when she had the
first hardy stuff planted she slashed out alder saplings, trimmed
them, dug holes around the garden, set them in and tramped them
down; she interlaced the upright stakes with willow branches to
make a woven fence. Harris Eby came up to do the roughest of the
field plowing, but she and her brother Joe managed the rest of it.
Burnett went down to give Watt Irish a hand; and he teamed with
Lattimore to break Millard's ground, for Millard's stump was still
too sensitive to bear the wooden contraption he had invented for
it.</p>

<p>The clearing went on, the brush fires never ceased to burn.
Fences began to march along from meadow to meadow. The grass lost
its winter dullness, turning tender-green, and the cows picked up
in their milk. Mrs. Provost took her basket abroad to the fields
and harvested a mess of dandelion greens which, wilted down with a
little vinegar and seasoned with a chunk of salt pork, accented her
hunger for green things until she wanted to cry. One day Mrs. Gay
brought in an onion from the winter planted sets; stripped of its
old husk, it was perhaps an inch thick and three inches long, and
she watched Gay eat it and relish it so greatly that she walked
from the cabin and stayed away half an hour. Geese moved south in
V-shaped clouds, the far sound of their voices waking people in the
night. Ducks settled on the swales. Travelers began to come
through, these being winter-bound emigrants looking for land, and
though the hospitality of the settlers was very strong, the strain
of extra meals on their meager supplies troubled them. Yet in every
cabin the feeling of release grew and the sweat and mud and
weariness of spring was good. The long trail across, the long
winter&mdash;this was done; the crops were going in, the time to
harvest lay directly ahead, barring catastrophe.</p>

<p>Buoyancy was everywhere. Men formed crews to do road work; a
rough bridge was put across the ford; the grade through Billy
Lord's notch was worked down and graveled; and during late April a
leggy man with a full beard and a pair of driving gray eyes stopped
in at Gay's to say he was a lawyer in a country that needed very
little law and therefore he was disposed to teach an eight-week
term of school by subscription, ten dollars the pupil. He had heard
Gay was a forward-looking man.</p>

<p>His trousers were patched and his coat met him too soon at cuffs
and shoulders; but this was the shabby uniform common to all men in
Oregon. Gay judged he had a temper, for he was narrow between the
eyes and such a disposition, with wild boys in a classroom, would
do better than Christian meekness. As for his teaching
qualifications, they were better left unquestioned. It appeared he
could speak the English language, write it and perhaps spell it;
since he was a lawyer he no doubt could handle common figures. This
was enough to start a school on.</p>

<p>"I'll pay ten dollars for my son," said Gay. "Now I'll tell you
what to do. Go to Daniel Rinearson's. He's got no sons for school,
but tell him I'd appreciate it if he throws in. If he does, it will
convince some other neighbors. Then go to Provost. He's got four
for school. You had better make him a wholesale rate. Next, try
Buck; then Mercer, then McIver. When you get these, the rest will
see it is a good thing and they will join. Then go to Burnett, up
this creek four miles, and ask if he'll get a few men and put up a
school cabin. It'll take a couple days. As for the location, it
ought to go at the ford. That's central and it's where there'll be
a little town one day. The school will sort of begin it. Tell
<i>Mrs.</i> Irish I said she ought to give the land for the school.
You can batch in the cabin when it's up. Meanwhile, make yourself
at home here. Come back and tell me how you make out."</p>

<p>The lawyer&mdash;his name was, he said, Henry
McGregor&mdash;slapped his knees, rose and went away. In one day of
hard walking he secured ten subscribers and twenty-three pupils.
Within four days Burnett and a crew had a log house forty feet long
and fifteen wide erected; it was larger than necessary for a school
but it would do for a meetinghouse also and for a church. Lattimore
had no children for school and he had made no contribution, but his
objection was violent. "It don't make no difference if it's free
now. I see what's comin'. You'll get the damned thing up and next
year you'll want to slap a tax on everybody to run it. It's just
Gay's way of slidin' through the back door with this education
business."</p>

<p>A week after the lawyer's first appearance in the community he
faced his first day's class. They were of all ages from seven to
Durbin Young's twenty-year-old son; four of the boys were somewhat
taller and heavier than the lawyer; on these he kept his eyes as he
talked.</p>

<p>"Your people have paid ten dollars a head to give you schooling.
I shall see you get it." There was no furniture in the room save
three long benches made of half logs planed flat enough to write
on. The lawyer placed his pupils before these, and nailed two
charts to the wall, one with the alphabet inked on it and the other
containing the numerals and an example of each of the arithmetical
processes. "Now, then," he said, "we'll learn the letters. Then we
will learn words. When I point to a letter you will say it with
me."</p>

<p>"I know the letters," said George McIver, "and I can spell."</p>

<p>"Do you?" said the lawyer, and let his eyes fall on Ryal
McIver's big son. "It will be a treat to you, then, to sing out
louder than the rest, so they can hear how it ought to be. Repeat
after me, <i>A as in cat. Also as in mate. Also as in
ball."</i></p>

<p>The class repeated but George McIver remained silent.</p>

<p>"I didn't hear you, young man," said the lawyer.</p>

<p>"I didn't talk," said George.</p>

<p>"Well," said the lawyer, "you are a strong-minded man, and so am
I, and the room's not big enough for both of us. Do you back up or
do I?"</p>

<p>"It's a foolish thing," said George. "I know all those
letters."</p>

<p>"My boy," said the lawyer, "we are all free and equal in the
courtroom and in the graveyard. But in this classroom I will say,
and you will do. Do you think you can whip me?"</p>

<p>"Think I can," said George McIver.</p>

<p>"I wish," said the lawyer, "all knowledge could be imparted this
rapidly. Come outside."</p>

<p>Lined against the cabin wall, the class had its first lesson.
George was rough and willing, the lawyer was as cool as a man
breaking a horse. He backed away while the young man did his wild
swinging; when George grew eager and rushed in the lawyer struck
him three times and knocked him down and seized him by leg and arm
and threw him in the creek. George rose and started home.</p>

<p>"No," said the lawyer, "I have got ten dollars to teach you and
I'll do it. Go back in the room."</p>

<p>He had been an unfriendly man in the beginning. With the class
again lined before him, he was kinder. "There is but one way to
learn anything and that is learn it. I don't hold with easy things.
I hold with hard things. Cold water's better than hot. Meat feeds
you but sugar won't, and misery's the greatest teacher. We are
going to repeat these letters..." and he smashed his tough palms
repeatedly together..."they wear holes in your head. Fifty years
from now you'll remember 'em. I am going to teach you to know what
you know. Repeat after me. <i>A as in cat. Also as in mate. Also as
in ball."</i></p>

<p>They stood on their feet three hours, singsonging the phrases he
threw at them. They twisted and grew tired and careless, and
suffered from the need of going out; but he held them there. When
he was through with his lessons he said: "Now I will give you a
little taste of the world all this leads to," and he thrust his
hands into his pockets and threw back his head and began on
Shakespeare. His voice rolled and rose; he closed his eyes, his
tongue formed each bump of each bumpy word. He clenched his hands
and roared at them; he opened his eyes and grew sad and his voice
ended on a whisper. His glance searched them a moment; he said in a
dry voice, "Be here at nine tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>When Ryal McIver saw his son he said: "What happened?" George
told him. Ryal said, "Well, by God, I think we got a good teacher,"
and laughed.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Burnett had thought of it and had mentioned it around; and one
morning he came to the Gays' with his crew of ten neighbors and
fell to trimming right-sized logs in the timber. Gay hadn't got out
of bed since he had lain down to rest and it was the general belief
now that he never would walk again; but the one room of the cabin
was too small for day's work and an invalid too, so Burnett's idea
was a dogtrot house, which was a second cabin built in line with
the first, the two connected by a common roof. The covered-over
space between&mdash;about twelve feet wide&mdash;could be used as
summer kitchen. With a fireplace and furniture, the second cabin
became a second room, this for Gay. By noon they had the logs
raised, the pole rafters up and the fireplace framed in. Eby and
Provost mudded the fireplace while the rest split shakes and laid
on the roof.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, everybody being at work in the yard,
Katherine stepped into the old cabin, moving quietly around her
father whom she thought asleep. He had only been musing, with his
eyes closed. "Where's your mother?"</p>

<p>"She and Gram went up to see Mrs. Collingwood."</p>

<p>He had aged so much that it was hard for her to bring back the
image of what he had been. He had no energy and his face showed the
shrinkage and the clawing of a pain which he could no longer hide.
"Nice of those boys to put up that room but you know I'm not going
to use it very long."</p>

<p>She laid her hand on his hand and said nothing.</p>

<p>He said, "I'm not certain your mother knows. She ought to see
it, but she's a great woman for not seeing the things she don't
want to see. Joe don't know&mdash;boys don't catch up with these
things."</p>

<p>"They've said nothing."</p>

<p>"People don't talk about death much when it's close by. I'd like
to see the first crop of wheat cut, but I don't believe I'll make
it. This thing took hold slow but she's going faster now. I feel it
breaking through. I'd like to see Joe a couple years older, I'd
like to see you married. Naturally I have got regrets. But I want
you to know I'm not afraid of it, and I don't seem to feel it
oughtn't happen. If I was stronger I guess I'd fight more, but
things seem to be getting a little farther away all the time. Three
months ago I felt like I owned this place. More like a fellow on a
visit now." She recognized a semblance of humor once so strong in
him. "I've thought lately we're all just visitors."</p>

<p>"That's what Lot would say."</p>

<p>"I have never criticized Lot publicly. He means to do good and
people have got to treat good ideas with respect. But I wish he
wouldn't spread so damned much sulphur around the premises. I'm not
much for this thunder and lightnin' business. Don't see this the
vale of sin and sorrow he makes out either. Believe things work out
pretty well here and will work out better as time goes on and we
learn more."</p>

<p>"I've wanted to ask you," she said. "Would you like to have been
something else?"</p>

<p>"I had some wild notions as a young man. That's a hard age. But
there's only a few people who can ride the big white horse at the
head of the parade. Not necessarily the best people or the smartest
or the most honest, but people that saw the chance and had enough
gall to take it. In the long run I don't think they're any happier
than the rest of us. Little flies bite us. Big flies bite
them."</p>

<p>He hadn't answered her question and she knew he wouldn't. He was
silent, going as quietly through a spasm of misery as he could. She
brought him a cup of water and held him up to drink it; she felt
the unpadded bones through his skin. He lay back. "I want this
claim kept for Joe. When you get married you'll move to your
husband's place. I expect your mother and the old folks will stay
here with Joe. But you'll help out. It will be all right. I'm not
worried. Your mind's not made up yet?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Don't marry till you're clearly certain. I ought not say this,
but for you to marry just for comfort or just to get rid of bein'
single&mdash;that would be as bad as a downright bad marriage. I do
wish one thing. Wish I'd stopped work more often to've played with
you and Joe. We put these things off, and then it's late."</p>

<p>"I remember a lot of fun we had. Nobody could have had a nicer
childhood than I had."</p>

<p>"Well," he said gently, "it was fun."</p>

<p>Martha came back with Gram to make supper and the crew finished
the cabin and came in to visit with Gay for a short time and went
away. Burnett stayed on to eat.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
A little short of twilight Ralph Whitcomb, riding in from Oregon
City, came upon Collingwood's and checked his horse to watch the
yellow light of the open doorway. He hailed the house and when he
stepped from the saddle Lucy was in the yard waiting, immediately
saying, "George has gone&mdash;till tomorrow." She made a small
motion toward him but he shook his head at her and stepped inside.
He was embarrassed by his carefulness but when he put his arms
around her the feeling went away and his kiss had a young man's
force. The same accumulated desire was in her; they clung in this
straining wish to break through each other until she tilted her
head to laugh at him, to show him the brightness of her eyes. "It
gets worse, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Toothache that won't stop."</p>

<p>"Tooth, toes, heart, all over, everywhere."</p>

<p>"I'll go on to Gay's and eat. Then I'll say I've got to make the
rounds and I'll come back. Will that be all right?"</p>

<p>"Come as soon as you can. Don't get to talking and forget
me."</p>

<p>"When I come back I'll leave my horse in the trees. It'll be
about an hour."</p>

<p>"That's so long," she said.</p>

<p>"There's no reason to this thing."</p>

<p>"You want reason?"</p>

<p>"No. I want you. I've been thinking of a thousand things to say
to you. I've been tortured. My bed's a damned cold thing. I go
around with my head full of wool. I feel your hands on my back and
I think, 'My God, how much time we're wasting."</p>

<p>His words moved through her with their incitement and her face
took on a dreamy sensuousness, lips parted, eyes heavy. She
whispered, "I'll take down my hair," and followed him to the
doorway and watched him ride on.</p>

<p>He saw change in Gay and knew there was no hope. After supper he
sent the women out of the cabin and made his examination. Burnett
stood by the fireplace with his pipe, saying nothing.</p>

<p>The Old Man crept close to the bed, looking on with his distant
curiosity. "What's the matter, John? You feelin' poor?"</p>

<p>"A little rheumatism," said Gay.</p>

<p>"Don't run in the family," said the Old Man. "You're bilious. I
used to be bilious. Give him something to purge his liver,
Whitcomb. There was a root my old man used in Kentucky. Wish I knew
what it was. Give him somethin' to clean him out. It's spring. Eat
some new grass. Horses know that much." He stepped into the yard
and went wandering on toward some chore half formed in his
mind.</p>

<p>Gay said to Whitcomb: "Wasting your time. I don't feel much
outside, but I sure feel a hell of a lot all the time inside. How
long, you think?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I told you that before."</p>

<p>"Leave some kind of medicine," said Gay. "It will make Martha
feel better. And don't say anything about it to the family. You're
staying here tonight?"</p>

<p>"I'll sleep in the shed. But I've got to go around the
neighborhood first."</p>

<p>"Fix me a pipe, Rice. I don't taste it much, but I can smell
it." He took it and dragged smoke deep into his lungs and relished
the flavor. "Bad habit's always fine. Got your seed all in?"</p>

<p>"Except the late stuff," said Rice.</p>

<p>"She'll look good about July. Stuff will roll off the vines,
we'll be hog-fat with plenty, we'll forget how hard the first
year's been. In time we'll get tired of poor things and make better
ones. Joe's going to see a better country than I saw, and his son
will see it better than Joe. That's it&mdash;that's the whole
story."</p>

<p>Whitcomb smiled and shook his head. "If we'd be content with
that we could make ourselves a fine life, nobody poor and nobody
rich. But we won't be content. The itch won't let us alone."</p>

<p>"If we didn't have the itch we'd be like the Molallies. It's a
necessary thing. Your trouble is you look at people and see what
they could be, and it makes you sad to see they're not wise enough
to follow a straight road in the direction of the blessed life. We
start for the top of the hill, then we get pulled off on some wild
goose chase and we're back down at the foot of the hill. But I
think we're farther up the hill now than we were couple hundred
years ago. We do make some progress. It's slow, but we make some.
We'll make more."</p>

<p>"Some mornings I believe that," said Whitcomb. "Some mornings I
don't."</p>

<p>"You're an educated man," said Gay. "I'd gladly gone through
life with one arm to know what you know, for learning puts a light
on the world an ignorant man never sees."</p>

<p>"Don't make that mistake," said Whitcomb. "Learning starts with
the man, not with the book."</p>

<p>"I only say one thing," reflected Gay. "Thinking just to be
thinking can be a dangerous business. It can pull you back and
forth till nothing's clear, and it can take the wallop out of your
fists. We're made of rough stuff, for we've got rough work to do
and if thinking makes us too tender to do it, then we're of no
account." He handed the pipe back to Burnett with a look of
distaste. "When tobacco don't taste good there's not much
left."</p>

<p>"I'll see you later," said Whitcomb and left the room.</p>

<p>Katherine came in to stand by Burnett and Gay's eyes went to his
daughter and admired her. He nodded to Burnett. "Like her
grandmother. She's got a firm disposition, good sense and good
health, and a lot of devilment."</p>

<p>"That's the way you used to sell horses in Missouri," said
Katherine.</p>

<p>"I always told the truth."</p>

<p>"So far as you went," she said.</p>

<p>"You see the devilment?" Gay asked Burnett. Then he added, "Good
thing to have," and seemed to lose interest as weariness overtook
him, and presently Burnett left the room with Katherine and crossed
to his horse.</p>

<p>"I'll walk to Collingwood's with you," she said. "I want to see
Lucy."</p>

<p>He took her hand and, leading the horse, went on through the
bland night; a warming soil threw its sweet odors around them and
moonlight was mellow stain in the shadows. She was thoughtful.
"He's never talked like that&mdash;like he wanted us to know him."
Then, as she went on, he knew how much she had thought of her
father's coming death and how directly she had met the fact. "We'll
stay on the place. There's enough of us to do it. We'll not leave,
we'll not give up what Dad started. Joe's old enough to work as a
man, and there's hands enough to help him. In four years it will be
his."</p>

<p>"You'll have all the help you ask for."</p>

<p>"The neighbors have their own troubles. But we'll stay. I hate
change. I hate to be scattered around, a piece here, a piece there.
I didn't want to leave the old home, but now we're here and I'll
never move again. I want to belong somewhere, I want to keep around
me all the things I live with, keep close to the people I know. I
don't even like to see people move away, it takes something from
me. I wish everybody who came here'd live the rest of their lives
here, in this one settlement. I'm going to. Every day of my life I
want to look out and see the same thing, same trees, same meadows
and creek, same trail. People that move and change and throw away
things&mdash;they get smaller and smaller. When I get old and my
children grow up and go away, that'll be the cruelest thing that
can happen to me. Maybe I ought to have been born a tree. They
never move. When I step into a house I expect to stay
there&mdash;and I'll want a big attic to put things in, because
what means something to me one time, always means something to
me."</p>

<p>He said nothing and in a moment she looked at him. "Are you
listening?"</p>

<p>"Was thinking of all the places I've scattered myself
around."</p>

<p>"Men have to roam awhile."</p>

<p>"I saw a lot of places and met a lot of people. An old Crow
grandfather squatted on a hill watching the sky thinks the same
things we think. A Crow mother blows on her baby's neck to make it
laugh, same as you will. Was a time when I traveled with pretty
hard men&mdash;the easy kind don't stand up well in the
mountains&mdash;and I thought then you could boil everything down
to a man's belly. Give him good food and give him a woman and he'd
want nothing else. When I knew those fellows better I found out
they were all packing around appetites that buffalo meat or a
woman's body wouldn't cut."</p>

<p>They came to the Collingwood meadow and walked over it. The door
of the Collingwood cabin was closed but pencil streaks of light
came through the log cracks. He said: "Poor job of mudding in." He
thought he heard voices, softly pitched, in the place.</p>

<p>"Appetites..." she said. "Go on."</p>

<p>"When these fellows came into camp they were sour for being
alone up some creek a long time. Soon as they got together, it was
like a drink of whisky. I never knew but one man that ever pulled
out from his partner when trouble came. Nobody had any use for that
fellow afterward. I never knew a good man that wasn't respected.
Made no difference how rough a crowd it was, those fellows knew
quality when they saw it."</p>

<p>"But you left that life."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it ran out. It..." He shrugged his shoulders.
"I don't know."</p>

<p>They were almost into the timber beyond Collingwood's when she
stopped. "You don't know yourself."</p>

<p>He turned to her, still holding to the reins of the horse, and
when he saw the tense and faintly stubborn set of her face, he knew
she wanted to be kissed; she had made up her mind, she had dropped
her guard. Last time she hadn't liked it, but Edna had been around
that afternoon to disturb the air. Maybe she had even tasted Edna
on him, for women had a keenness about things like that.</p>

<p>He let go the reins, drawn on by a signal from her as clear as
anything Edna could have shown him. In his past affairs such a
signal meant going straight through without limit, and as he
watched Katherine he saw no difference. He wanted to see a
difference, for she wasn't Edna, she was none of the other women he
had known; she was many things in his mind, made up of her talk and
her gestures and of his growing fancies concerning her. But there
was no difference and then he became aware of how much all women
were at the mercy of these old signals and words which were so
brutally inexpressive. Thoroughly bad women and thoroughly good
women used the same signs. There were no other signs&mdash;only
these few which covered everything from the necessity of two
illiterates clamped together and rolling in the dust of a dark
country lane to the loveliest poetry love could stir. He couldn't
know what wonderful images were in her as she waited for him. For
that matter she had no way of seeing the truth in him; they had to
stand here unexplained, frozen into the tenseness of doe and buck
suddenly come upon each other; it was as though nature, wanting
only one thing out of humans, had made them mute to keep this act
unchanged.</p>

<p>The whicker of a horse in the nearby timber checked him, and he
swung with his instant suspicion and seized Katherine's arm and led
her to the deeper shadows. He called, "Who's that?" The horse
whickered again, directly before him; reaching out, he felt its
reins tied to a fir, and he ran a hand over saddle and
saddlebags.</p>

<p>"Don't pay your visit now."</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Ralph's in the cabin."</p>

<p>"Oh. Poor Lucy."</p>

<p>"I'll walk home with you."</p>

<p>"No, it's nothing I mind. I hope nobody comes by. Poor Lucy.
Nothing for a husband and only half of Ralph."</p>

<p>"Half's half."</p>

<p>"You didn't mean that, did you?"</p>

<p>"Best they can do."</p>

<p>"Best a lot of people can do, but it's still poor shrift. It's
twice the misery she had before. And no end to it. You want that to
go on?"</p>

<p>"It'll go on till it runs out."</p>

<p>"I don't want it to go on," she said. "It will break her right
down the middle of her body. She'll be nothing&mdash;not George's
wife, not Ralph's, not anything. She'll get to hating herself and
she'll get to hating Ralph."</p>

<p>"George, too."</p>

<p>"He's not worth hating. I've thought a lot about it. I've..."
She turned back to him. "People have got to make do. They have got
to decide. If I must take a man I don't love, I expect I'd take
him, for a single woman's nothing, she's dead. She has got to send
Ralph away, or she has got to go away with him."</p>

<p>"Looks to me Collingwood's not in love with her now."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "he's not to be respected." She hesitated a
moment, and then he heard the decisive side come up, the lean and
dark side. "If I were Lucy I'd leave Collingwood. I could endure
not loving a husband, that's common, but I couldn't stand not being
wanted. I have got to be wanted to be any good..." Her manner
lightened. "We talk about so many things!"</p>

<p>He thought, <i>I passed it by and she's laughing at me.</i> He
was irritated by his slowness. When he drew her forward she swayed
aside with a light gesture of protest, but he checked her. "No," he
said, "I'm not Collingwood."</p>

<p>She was laughing. "Hurt your pride?"</p>

<p>"Katherine."</p>

<p>"Like that name?"</p>

<p>"Fine name."</p>

<p>"Like the way you say it."</p>

<p>"Katherine."</p>

<p>She put her hands on his shoulders, and the smile settled and
she dropped her head to rest it against his chest. He never knew
where she was, never in the way he knew where Edna was.</p>

<p>"Katherine, lift up."</p>

<p>She pressed her back against his holding arms. He tightened
them. "No," he said. She was motionless, waiting for him to be
through, or listening to herself; then restlessness stirred her and
came through her arms. She raised her head. "It's not fair," she
murmured. She drew a breath, her face shadowed and moving
reluctantly inward. "It's never fair." The weight of her hands
increased on his shoulders and when she reached his mouth he felt a
second reaction against him and a halfhearted impulse to turn away.
He held on. She seemed heavy to him, wanting him and not wanting
him, undecided, liking it but not liking it, afraid. But her lips
stayed with him and the flimsy little strings that held him back
began to break and the rest of it came on, the blind thing, the
unkind thing, the thing that had no conscience; the growling,
bitter, unbearable thing that stiffened his legs and closed his
arms around her and made him scheme to carry her beyond herself.
She ceased to be heavy; she was a willow bending gracefully to him;
she was a willow no more, she was angry with the same anger he had,
she was motion in his arms, mouth feeding at him with strong
appetite. She cried in her throat and flung her head aside. "Let me
stop." She came back in violent aggressiveness, fingers biting
through his coat. She struck her head on his chin. "Make me
stop."</p>

<p>He let go and watched her struggle with herself. She stared at
him, she came nearer and ran her fingers across his forehead.
"You're sweating."</p>

<p>"I'm crazy."</p>

<p>"I'm crazy." She took his hand and laid it against her chest.
"Feel it beat. I'm shaking."</p>

<p>"I'll walk back with you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;it wouldn't do&mdash;it would be&mdash;no." She
lifted her hands and pressed them against the sides of her face and
drew a long sigh to control her breathing. She said, "You stopped.
Put your arms behind you." She came in and gave him a kiss and
moved quickly away. "You stopped."</p>

<p>"Sure you don't want me to walk back?"</p>

<p>"No. Go home now. I'll wait a minute. Get on your horse."</p>

<p>He climbed to the saddle and said, "Good night," and turned
away. As he entered the trees he heard her call his name and he
swung around. "No," she said, "keep going. Good night." He was well
into the trees when she called again.</p>

<p>"Rice."</p>

<p>"Want something?"</p>

<p>"No. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night," he said, and rode on. His sweat-damp body felt the
chill of the colder air lying in the firs, but he felt fine; he sat
straight on the saddle and caught every odor of this dark place and
his spirit made spinning turns through him and waves of tenderness
unsteadied him. Nothing was like this&mdash;not Edna, not any woman
he remembered, was like this. Nothing was like this. The shock held
on, memory bringing back smaller shocks, and the goodness of it
went into the marrow of his bones. Nothing was like this.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
When they were through, Lucy made coffee for Whitcomb and they sat
at the table, very quiet, the hunger of love and the intemperate
words of love exhausted. Her face was drowsy; memory quickened it
and now and then humor lightened it and when she looked at him he
saw the shared thing there. They were comfortable with each other;
the strain was gone.</p>

<p>"I've got to make the rounds before I go back to Gay's," he
said. "But I don't want to."</p>

<p>She smiled. "I did that to you."</p>

<p>He finished his coffee and rose to tie his stock and get into
his coat. He stepped to the fireplace. "When will next time
be?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"That's the bad part of this."</p>

<p>"Don't start regretting. It'll spoil this."</p>

<p>"Not regret. The more we have, the more we'll want."</p>

<p>"We went through that last time. There's nothing to be done
about it." She tapped a spoon against her cup, keeping time to a
tune in her head. The spoon stopped and her manner changed. Her
voice was flat. "He'll be home tomorrow. He'll be polite to me,
he'll ask me how I've been, he'll get out his list and add names
and dream over them, he'll stand behind his queer screen and watch
me from the corner of his eyes. But he'll want me and I'll have to
do it. I can't bear the thought. I'm not his any more, I'm yours
and it's a terrible thing to touch him."</p>

<p>He said, "In this territory it's the legislature that grants
divorces."</p>

<p>"He's ambitious. He wouldn't let me have a divorce. It would
lose votes for him. And what could I say? Do you think I could say
we're no longer in love and I don't want to go on with it? Your
legislature would tell me to go home and put up with something that
a lot of other married people put up with."</p>

<p>"You've thought about it," he said.</p>

<p>"I've thought about everything I could think about. Nothing will
work. We both knew that when we started."</p>

<p>He locked his fingers behind him and watched the fire. She was
the direct one. Most women were; even in the height of ecstasy they
could look forward to the consequences. But he had to admit that he
too had looked forward. All day he had pondered Lot White's
warning&mdash;that was the day he had operated on Millard&mdash;and
he knew that if Lot saw something here so would other neighbors. He
ought to tell her but he couldn't bring himself to it.</p>

<p>Her voice turned him about. "When you're solemn I know you're
fighting something in your head. Don't."</p>

<p>"I knew how it would be," he said, "but not how strong it would
get."</p>

<p>"We're very placid now. We're reasonable&mdash;and that's when
it looks dark." She reached over and took his hand, whispering,
"Wait another half-hour. We'll not be reasonable then. That's
best."</p>

<p>"I have got to have you."</p>

<p>"You do, you know you do."</p>

<p>"Nothing certain, ducking around, waiting for somebody to get
out of the road, making plans that fall through."</p>

<p>"Don't go over it again."</p>

<p>He turned behind her chair and laid his arms around her. She
caught his hands, lowering her head to them. "You're harder to
manage than I am. You're older&mdash;you ought to be
wiser&mdash;you ought to be practical."</p>

<p>"I love you, that's the trouble. This thing will work on me till
I'm apt to tell George he can move out and go to hell."</p>

<p>"Stop it, Ralph."</p>

<p>"All right," he said, and bent to kiss the top of her head. She
drew his face down and whispered to him. "Let's start again."</p>

<p>"I've got to make the rounds."</p>

<p>She left the chair and went to the fireplace to set the
coffeepot aside.</p>

<p>His mood infected her and her temper was no more stable than
his; she grew impatient with him. "It's so long between times that
I'd think you'd think of some excuse to forget the neighbors."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll forget them."</p>

<p>"No, I guess it wouldn't do."</p>

<p>"Well, that's it. When will next time be? Can you get to Oregon
City?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Not soon."</p>

<p>"I'll come here in three weeks."</p>

<p>"Maybe he'll be away again&mdash;maybe he won't."</p>

<p>He was irritated by her sudden distance from him. She was
unreasonable without warning. He moved to his greatcoat and got
into it and stood hat in hand waiting for her to turn about from
the fireplace; she kept him waiting, she was deliberately punishing
him. He wanted to go over and kiss her but even that closeness had
gone. He thought: <i>There'll never be anything settled between
us.</i> He said: "I'll stop a moment on my way by in the
morning."</p>

<p>"Sometimes I don't understand," she said. "One minute you can't
wait, you've got to tell George and get him out of the way. The
next minute you're careful about the neighbors, you're cold."</p>

<p>"We're both that way."</p>

<p>"We ought to know enough to be sensible. We're not young
people."</p>

<p>"It's not a sensible thing," he said. He hadn't meant it to
sound as it did; it came out wrong and hurt her.</p>

<p>"Maybe we'd better stop then," she said. She turned about. "I
suppose that was in the back of our minds from the beginning, that
it was really impossible. We were just pulled over our heads."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "good night," and moved to the door.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to answer me?"</p>

<p>"I can't argue you into something you don't want."</p>

<p>"You never argued me into it in the first place. I made up my
own mind."</p>

<p>"Changed it now?"</p>

<p>"Well, haven't you changed yours?"</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>She stared at him and obviously meant to hold herself against
him, but a swinging impulse weakened her and she crossed the room
quickly and hooked her hands around his neck. "Ralph&mdash;how can
it get this way it mustn't&mdash;I know it's hard&mdash;but it
mustn't! Stop being reasonable&mdash;stop it."</p>

<p>"The hell with the neighbors," he said. "Let's start again."</p>

<p>"All right. Now."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The fire was small, the room cold. "There's still time," she said,
"to visit some of the people."</p>

<p>"It's all right. I don't care."</p>

<p>"No, we've got to be a little watchful. A little. I was
thinking, suppose George came home early?"</p>

<p>"Might be a good way to settle it."</p>

<p>She rose. "You get out of here now." When he was ready to go she
drew him to her. "Next time&mdash;next time&mdash;soon...I wish
this had happened months ago, years ago. Oh, how much time we've
wasted. Wish I could lock you in a closet and draw you out whenever
I wanted you. Haven't some of your women patients ever tried
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One did," he said, and kissed her and left the cabin.</p>

<p>Going back through the night to Gay's&mdash;he had decided
against visiting any of the settlers&mdash;he realized neither of
them had been very levelheaded. It wouldn't get better; it would
get worse. Hope would swing them up, but doubt would shake them to
pieces. How many millions had gone through this misery of denied
possession since the first man had described it in the
Bible&mdash;he himself no doubt having suffered from it?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch48" id="ch48"></a>Chapter 48</h2>

<p>COLLINGWOOD returned from his trip the following day, saying
very little to Lucy; he caught up with his chores around the place
and that night plunged himself into his list of names. He appeared
tired and he was brusquer than usual. She wondered if he had
discovered anything about her through the neighbors and she pried
at him with her indirect questioning.</p>

<p>"Where did you put up last night?"</p>

<p>"At Deans'&mdash;over by the Mission."</p>

<p>"Did you hear about Gay's new cabin?"</p>

<p>"No. What happened?"</p>

<p>Then, she thought, he hadn't stopped in at any of the neighbors
and hadn't heard anything. "Oh," she said, "Rice Burnett got some
men and put up another cabin so Gay would have a place by
himself."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd been here to help," he said. "He feeling any
better?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. Whitcomb was here yesterday. He dropped in to
see us a moment but he didn't say anything."</p>

<p>"Oh," he said and went on with his work at the lists. It didn't
appear to stir anything in him but she wasn't entirely
satisfied.</p>

<p>"How was your trip?"</p>

<p>"All right. There's a man over on the bottom who's announced
himself for the legislature. I don't think he's known, and he's a
sort of a damned fool to boot, but it will make me work
harder."</p>

<p>That was it, she thought. "When is the election?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks."</p>

<p>"There's a good deal of work on this place you ought to do."</p>

<p>"After election I'll get some time. If I make it there'll be
maybe a month at Oregon City, of course."</p>

<p>"That will leave me here alone."</p>

<p>"Come to Oregon City with me if you want." It was so casual an
invitation that she knew he had thought about it and didn't really
want her to be with him. He added, "I've got to make another trip
up there and I thought to start tomorrow. You want to go?"</p>

<p>She picked up her sewing, thinking more and more of his frequent
trips away. Politics accounted for them, yet she knew that he was
quick to see a good-looking woman and that he was warm enough, when
he chose to be, to attract some of them. He had tried Edna, he had
tried others and had been successful more than once. He might have
another woman now. She said: "Do you think you'll win?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"You're not ordinarily that confident."</p>

<p>"The men who could easily beat me," he said, "don't want the
job. They think it a waste of time. They think men in politics are
all crooked or fools and won't sully themselves with it." He leaned
back from his work to display an interest in this subject; in his
voice was the slight tone of cynicism. "If they get crooks or fools
it is entirely their own fault."</p>

<p>"Don't you feel a little strange over what they might think of
you for running?"</p>

<p>"I'm not so blind I can't see," he said. Then definitely she
heard a note of bitterness. "But I'm not too proud to take the
crumbs these gentlemen scorn. I know what they think of me." He
looked at her with an uncharacteristic directness. "You had thought
I didn't. They play a little game with me to my face. I play a
little game with them. In the long run maybe my game's the better.
We'll see."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you hated them," she said. "Is all this
neighborliness you show just a play?"</p>

<p>"I like to be useful," he said, not quite answering her. "I like
to be well thought of."</p>

<p>"You're after something else, not just this job."</p>

<p>He looked back to the pages of names before him and she saw him
struggle with his secretive impulse. Presently he said, "Yes." She
didn't press him. She returned to her work. He sat idle and
afterwards he grew curious. "I expect you think this is all
foolish, as the rest do."</p>

<p>"It's your judgment," she said. "But I'd like to see us make
something out of this place, the way others are doing with
theirs."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll get to it."</p>

<p>"I don't know when."</p>

<p>The remark irritated him. "I'll do it. I'll do it as well as
some of these damned fools going around laughing at me. Someday
they'll know." He checked himself and turned to his names and said
nothing more until they were in bed. "I don't know now why I came
to this damned country. It's not my country, and it's not yours. I
guess I wanted a new start, same as everybody else, but I'm not
going to spend my life digging spuds out of the ground or following
a pair of dumb cattle back and forth across the plowland. There's
opportunity here, everything's just starting. When I get a
foothold, when I get known all around the territory, we'll probably
move to Oregon City. A little political influence opens a lot of
business doors and I shall find where the money's to be had, and go
into some sort of business while I'm playing politics." Once again
the small boy's resentment would not stay down; it slipped through
his careful cover. "I'll demonstrate something to these people, by
God, I will."</p>

<p>She lay still, waiting for him to want her, bracing herself
against it and dreading it; but he made no move to her and then she
knew he had some other woman. She thought of it a long while,
relieved and feeling freer yet lightly stung by the knowledge he
didn't want her.</p>

<p>"We haven't got much of a life, have we?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Haven't had for a long time."</p>

<p>"What's to be done about that?"</p>

<p>His moment of directness was over. He hid himself with an
evasive, "I'm pretty tired. Let's let it go till another time."</p>

<p>He was a failure to himself as well as to her, she thought, and
when he stepped from his secrecy and had to make decisions which
would oppose other men, his world would fall apart; he was like a
man who, having rehearsed a dive from a high place a thousand times
in his mind, walked to the actual cliff and could not force himself
to jump. Now she believed she knew why he was so quiet; he knew it
about himself.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He rose long before daylight, cooked his own breakfast and slipped
away without disturbing her and at three o'clock that afternoon he
entered Oregon City, put up the horse and set forth to begin his
methodical business of entering the shops of this town. Some of the
people he already knew and he took time only to say a few words by
way of keeping himself in their minds. At other places he began by
looking at things he indicated he might need; shortly he introduced
himself, spoke of the settlement from which he had come and in turn
asked a good many questions of the shopkeeper concerning business
conditions, the future of the territory and politics generally. He
had long before learned the art of making a man important to
himself by gravely listening to the man's opinions, and toward the
end of each visit he dropped an opinion or two of his own which
subscribed to the man's opinions; and so he canvassed the town. He
took pains to look up the territory's leading citizens. He talked
to Abernethy and he was introduced to Peter Burnett when the latter
came into the store; both men, being highly political, were
interested in his description of conditions down his way&mdash;for
they too knew the art of listening. This he understood, and played
a sober and not too talkative part; and he left with the feeling
that they would remember him and regard him as a valuable man to
know from his community.</p>

<p>Short of suppertime he stepped into a little white building
which served both as a dwelling and a store with a few shelves of
bolt goods, ribbons, buttons and women's stuff. The bell tinkled
when he went through the door and in a moment a woman came from the
rear of the place; she was about thirty-five, slightly florid but
still attractive, owning hazel eyes which looked upon him a moment
and opened with a delayed warmth.</p>

<p>"You're in town again."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Have you got some ribbon, just a small piece,
about so wide?"</p>

<p>"What color?"</p>

<p>"Some kind of green."</p>

<p>She found two or three spools and laid them on the counter,
watching him while he studied the ribbon. "Your wife would do
better picking it."</p>

<p>"She's not here."</p>

<p>"You must do a lot of traveling."</p>

<p>"I suppose I get around the country as much as anybody. I'll
take just a yard of that."</p>

<p>She cut it and rolled it and took his money; she stood back, in
no apparent hurry to end the meeting. "Have you got a lot of
business around so many places?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said and looked down at his clothes. "Expect I ought
to get back to the hotel and rub some of this mud from me. The
trails are knee-deep."</p>

<p>"So's that street," she said, nodding beyond the door.</p>

<p>"You ought to get a man to fix your walk."</p>

<p>"Men are busy and I've none I can order around."</p>

<p>He loosened his manner toward her and set his eyes on her. She
looked back with what he took to be a considerable interest, and
for a time they were weighing each other, making their guesses. He
judged she had experience enough not to be fooled if she didn't
want to be and experience enough to bring him on if she chose. He
thought he saw the signal. He turned his attention to a bolt of
goods on the shelf and he reached forward to touch it and brushed
her shoulder. "That's a nice thing."</p>

<p>Her smile remained steady. "It'd be too old for your wife."</p>

<p>"How could you tell?"</p>

<p>"You're a young man," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll feel old tonight," he said, "in a dismal room at Moss's
place."</p>

<p>"I expect so," she said. She was listening to him, she was
waiting; there was a wariness about her eyes.</p>

<p>He grew restless, color came to his face and he took a forward
step and half raised his hand toward her; then the gust of daring
blew itself out and he pulled his hand aside to touch the bolt
again. Without warning she tipped her head and laughed at him and
stepped back. "Is that all you want?" she asked, nodding to the
ribbon in his hand. She was no longer waiting as she met his eyes
and he thought he saw dislike in them; she had been ready to play
the game but now, for no reason he could understand, she was
through with him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, and walked out, stung by her amusement,
humiliated by the failure. He returned to his room, looked long at
himself in the mirror. "God damn her," he thought, "what'd she see?
What'd I do wrong?" It was the same as it had been with Edna; both
women had searched him out and hadn't liked what they saw. He
washed and went down for supper and at the common table he listened
to the conversation until he had some notion of the men around him,
and presently he caught the drift of their thoughts and joined the
talk. For a short time he enjoyed himself, for he talked well
before strangers and thought he sensed approval in them. The
proprietor, Sydney Moss, he didn't like. Moss was a man with an
agreeable manner which took men off guard, and a sharp tongue which
upset them; and Moss had a set of eyes which seemed to regard
nothing highly. When they touched him, Collingwood felt
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>He left the hotel and walked to the street's end, and took a
stand by the shore to watch the flooding river cast its waters over
the ragged rock reef. The rumble of that thunder was a pulse in the
night and a tremor under his feet; and a mist rose from the
whirling basin at the foot of the falls, milk-sallow in the
moonlight, and whirlpools rushed round and round and gave out the
sound of a giant mouth sucking. The power of it impressed him;
turning to look along the street, he drew himself square and he
thought: "You people&mdash;you ignorant, greedy, heartless
people&mdash;I'll make you know me. You'll eat it, you
sons-of-bitches. Every one of you that's done it, I'll remember,
and you'll eat it."</p>

<p>He walked back as far as the saloon where, at this hour, the men
of the town had gathered. He was tired and he hated to rub
shoulders with the crowd again, but he took hold of himself and
stepped into the place. Halfway down the bar he discovered Ralph
Whitcomb. Whitcomb motioned to the barkeep for an additional glass
and poured him a drink. "What brings you here?"</p>

<p>"A little business. I'm glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Everything all right in the settlement?"</p>

<p>"Gay's a little worse."</p>

<p>"Nothing's to be done about that," said Whitcomb. He put both
elbows on the bar and considered his glass. He had a sad face,
Collingwood decided, a sad face at times marked by irony. But it
was a square face with a vigor to it and Collingwood, who admired
decisiveness above all other qualities in a man, envied the doctor.
It was hard for him to find a common ground with Whitcomb; he never
quite caught on with the man.</p>

<p>"Lucy's looking well," he said.</p>

<p>Whitcomb nodded and said, "That's fine," and continued to watch
his glass. A question occurred to him. "How you making out on this
campaign?"</p>

<p>"It'll be all right. The neighbors are with me...I meant to ask
a favor. When you go around the country you might mention my
name&mdash;put in a word. I'd appreciate the effect."</p>

<p>"I'll do so if you want it, but I don't know why you want a
time-wasting thing like that. What's it good for?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Collingwood quietly, "I might be useful. Coming
down our way soon?"</p>

<p>"Week or two."</p>

<p>"Be sure to drop in and say hello. Lucy likes you."</p>

<p>Whitcomb pursed his lips; he raised a hand to pass it across his
face and he turned to give Collingwood his attention. "Have another
drink."</p>

<p>"No," said Collingwood, "I'm going to bed. I'll give Lucy your
regards."</p>

<p>The doctor flushed. "All right," he said.</p>

<p>Collingwood returned to his room and stretched on the bed,
physically weary, and he remembered the woman in the shop and he
thought: "What in God's name was the matter?" He thought of his
wife, of Whitcomb, of Moss's strange-regarding eyes, of all the
careless laughter he had overheard men use on him, and he was weary
of his riding and weary of himself; he said aloud, "What's it
worth&mdash;what's the use of it?" He rose, looked long at himself
in the mirror, undressed and went to bed.</p>

<p>He was in the saddle by daylight, bound back; he passed the mill
at the end of town, following the road squeezed between bluff and
water to its summit. He was then above the falls and he thought he
heard a voice penetrate the roar of the tumbling waters; turning
the horse about he rode to the rim and noticed a group of men
huddled at the shore line with their interest riveted to something
in the river. Out there, when he looked, he discovered a raft
lodged at the brink of the falls, precariously lodged between two
boulders and supporting a figure spread-eagled on it, arms gripping
its either side, toes hooked over its end. Collingwood sent the
horse down the road, swung beside the river and galloped toward the
watchers.</p>

<p>The wish to help the helpless figure on the raft pushed them so
close to the river that the lapping water touched their feet; they
were a dozen men and a boy of fourteen whose shaken voice sailed
repeatedly and vainly against the roar: "Gil hang on! Hang on! Hang
on!" The boy broke from the group, raced along the shore to a small
log and shoved it into the stream. One of the men called after
him.</p>

<p>"What you doin' that for, son?"</p>

<p>The boy came back. "I don't know." He gritted his teeth
together. He was crying. <i>"Do</i> somethin'."</p>

<p>The man said: "We got to wait for the rope, boy." He looked to
Collingwood and dropped his voice. "His brother out there. They
were playin' on that damned raft and it slid into the fast
water."</p>

<p><i>"Do</i> somethin'," cried the boy. "It's goin' to slide off
those rocks!"</p>

<p>It was about a hundred feet from shore to the nearest rocks of
the horseshoe reef stretching across the river. Water flowed
smoothly forward to the reef, cramped itself between ragged
boulders and broke into white froth as it reached the lip of the
reef and flung itself into the basin forty feet below. Mist rose
from the basin and settled as fine rain on the watching men.
Through the mist Collingwood watched the raft lift and fall to the
rough waters. It was at present lodged between the rocks, at the
mercy of some extra push of the current which would work it free
and send it and its passenger down the ladderlike falls to the
whirlpools of the basin. Each surge of the raft shifted the boy on
the loose logs; he righted himself; his cry now and then came
through the thunder of the water as the thin piping of a sea
gull.</p>

<p>"Men," said Collingwood, "we have got to do something."</p>

<p>They took their eyes from the river to look solemnly at him, and
returned their attention to the river.</p>

<p>"By God, we have got to think of something," he said. "We just
can't stand here and watch him drown." He scanned the shore and saw
nothing but a sharp point which obscured the beach beyond. He had
no idea in his head; it was only a wish to look well before these
men which made him break into a trot and run around the point,
there to discover a boat drawn on the gravel. Still with no idea,
he dragged the boat to the water and towed it back. He anchored its
bow on the gravel and looked steadily toward the boy on the raft.
The crowd shifted toward him. A man said:</p>

<p>"What you thinkin'&mdash;to take that thing out there? It won't
do. You can't row against the current."</p>

<p>A file of men appeared from the town and ran forward. The boy
broke from the crowd about the boat and raced toward them and came
back with a coil of rope. Men seized the rope and paid it out along
the beach; the new arrivals straggled in with other sections of
rope.</p>

<p>"Ain't long enough."</p>

<p>"Tie three-four coils together."</p>

<p>"That's no use&mdash;you can't throw a hundred feet of
rope."</p>

<p>"What the hell we get it for then?"</p>

<p>"Somebody said to."</p>

<p>Men tied the rope sections together and one man slowly rolled
the joined pieces into a loose coil. Collingwood, standing by the
boat, watched another man take one end of the rope and fasten it to
a chunk of driftwood; then the man handling the coil slowly swung
the driftwood around his head until it gained momentum, cast it out
upon the water and let the current uncoil the rope in kis hand. The
driftwood bobbed along the current toward the falls.</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Collingwood.</p>

<p>"Maybe the current will set it over to the boy, and he can grab
the rope and we'll pull him in."</p>

<p>"It won't set over," said Collingwood, pointing. The driftwood
was far short of raft and boy, sliding toward a side eddy of the
falls; the man operating the rope hauled it in and the group made a
semicircle by the river and stared in silence across the water.</p>

<p>Collingwood reached for the rope's end and tied it to the bow of
the boat. "This current can be rowed against till you're close to
the rocks. We can set the boat right on the mark, drift it down to
the raft. Boy makes a jump for the boat&mdash;and you fellows on
shore haul in."</p>

<p>Collingwood's glance went around the group and found each set of
eyes falling from him. "It'll work," he said. He had no answer from
them. He looked over the river, watching the violent play of the
raft against the rocks. Now the avoiding eyes returned to him, for
he felt the surreptitious interest play against him; but as soon as
he brought his attention back to the group the eyes fell again. He
said: "Haul in when I grab the boy." He gave the boat a shove from
the gravel, jumped in and fitted the oars into their rowlocks. The
current grabbed the boat and swung it downstream, but he pulled the
nose about and rowed upstream and outward until he was in line with
the raft; then he let the boat drift toward the raft.</p>

<p>The rope, stretching from boat to shore, began to catch the hard
push of the current, dragging the boat's nose downstream.
Collingwood rowed against it with full strength and signaled ashore
and saw men tying other sections of rope on to give him the slack
he needed; but each added yard of rope thrown into the water gave
the current more surface to push on, and as Collingwood approached
the broken waters at the reef he could no longer handle the boat.
The raft was twenty yards ahead of him, vague in the mist-clouds
rolling densely over the falls; the sound of the falls shook him,
the suddenly accelerated current seized the boat and flung it
forward. He dropped the oars and knelt in the boat, watching the
turning white face of the boy on the raft. He cried, "Jump," but he
knew it was a hopeless thing, for the boat slid off and the gap
grew greater and then he looked to the men ashore and waved both
hands in signal to haul back. There was no answering pull. The boat
leaped upward as the broken waters tossed it toward the rocks.
Crying again&mdash;scarcely hearing himself above the roar&mdash;he
saw the crowd rush along the edge of the water. They had lost the
rope, he realized, and he fell face forward on the boat's bottom
and gripped the cleats with his hands. The boat struck a rock and
tipped, and water filled it, and he was carried upward and he went
falling, strangling, dying, downward across the rocky ledges of the
falls into the whirlpool.</p>

<p>From the shore, men saw him tossed clear of the boat as it
sailed outward beyond the reef and disappeared and they saw the
raft, struck one time too many by the current, rise vertical and
hurl its clinging passenger free. Collingwood and boy and boat and
raft vanished in the crying mists below the reef.</p>

<p>The boy ashore turned and ran away from the river, crying,
"Mother mother&mdash;mother!" Somebody said: "Who was the man?"</p>

<p>There was a pause until another man recollected him.
"Collingwood, I heard him say in Abernethy's last night. From
somewhere in the valley."</p>

<p>"Damned brave man."</p>

<h2><a name="ch49" id="ch49"></a>Chapter 49</h2>

<p>WINTER was for Lockyear a cage against whose bars he flung
himself with increased resentment. There was no patience in him to
endure himself at idle times, no ability to stand the tedious
hours. He was a man with no cushion between thought and action; as
soon as his mind conceived, his muscles stiffened to execute; and
so he was constantly jarred by the convulsive motions of his
temper, flung back and forth between short spells of brooding and
violent activity. It was as though he had been born with unformed
cells where the reflective part of his mind should have been and
could not receive the gentling lessons of experience; he was a
stallion, knowing only his own existence, dumb to half the pain he
suffered in his search to eject himself into the receiving
mare.</p>

<p>At intervals he ranged the trails for no other purpose than to
release the energies he could no longer contain, but otherwise the
dripping wall of woods held him to the cabin. He had no friends, he
was increasingly unwelcome to the settlers, there were no
diversions during the short gray days and the long nights; once
during February he scouted the land along the Willamette for a
hundred miles; and in March he visited Oregon City. He had nothing
to keep his hands busy, for he had no ambitions, no farm to make,
no buildings to set up. On several occasions he returned to
Rinearson's valley and hung back in the trees, watching for Edna,
but he got no sight of her; and these times he returned home in a
more explosive mood. He ate, he stood at the door, he lay on the
bunk to watch the ceiling, his temper creating its threat. Veen and
Roxy never ceased to watch him, to be cautious around him; he was
an unpredictable animal they were forced to live with. When he was
within the cabin there were fewer than a dozen words said during a
day's time; when he was gone Veen and Roxy relaxed, but even then
they were careful, for he had the stealth of a cat in his walking,
and often appeared with no warning.</p>

<p>Toward the end of April, returning from one more futile prowl
around Rinearson's, he stopped at the top of a ridge to catch a
long view of the settlement along the creek&mdash;the cabins lying
in their cleared places, the groves of timber between, the fences
squaring plowed fields turned green with new crops, the spiraled
smoke rising from chimneys, the occasional moving figure in one
yard or another, the traveler creeping along the trail. He watched
the scene for perhaps half an hour, missing none of its detail,
hands folded across the saddle horn, shoulders stooped; when he was
done with his gazing, and had been further incited by his
thoughts&mdash;for he realized he looked upon a scene in which he
could never have a part&mdash;he moved on.</p>

<p>He reached the cabin at suppertime, ate, and made up a hook and
a line to whip the creek in the twilight, catching nothing. He
squatted against the cabin's wall with his pipe, watching Roxy go
to the creek for water but not thinking about her and ignoring her
when she passed him. He had Edna in his head. The outsideness of
his place among these people, the hours of nothing around the
cabin, the walking for no reason, the appetite which stung like
ginger through his body&mdash;these drove him at her. She was all
he saw; there was nothing else to see. The thought formed and
locked him into his decision; and then he was a man who had to act.
He got his gun from the cabin, oiled it and re-charged it; he
polished the butt with his palm and set the gun away. He went to
the creek, flattened to drink and rose and stood beside it,
listening to some far-off sound. Behind him, Veen dropped an
armload of wood beside the fireplace, that crash roving through
evening's stillness. He circled the yard at a long, loose walk,
traveling faster with each circle; now he was driven by the idea
and he went into the cabin and sat on his bunk, shoulders bent,
hands over his knees, and stared at the fire. Roxy was in her
corner, in the shadows; he knew she watched him though she seemed
to see nothing. Veen, on the floor with his back propped against
the wall, watched him with the same indirection. He couldn't catch
the glance of either when suddenly he looked at them. It pleased
him. They were always afraid of him; they were more afraid
tonight.</p>

<p>"You foolin' with each other when I'm away?"</p>

<p>Veen said: "Stay around and find out."</p>

<p>"I don't care. Go ahead. You doin' it?"</p>

<p>"If you don't care&mdash;don't ask."</p>

<p>Lockyear stared at the girl. "Ugliest woman I ever saw, but
she'll do for a cripple like you. She ain't had much. She's hot. Do
it at night when you don't have to look at her face."</p>

<p>They said nothing. He rose and stood nearer the fire; he turned
and went slowly toward her and then her eyes lifted and she drew
herself back to the wall, shoulders flat against it. Veen said,
"Leave her alone." Lockyear moved in. He raised his arm and let it
settle on her shoulder and felt the shrinking of her body. He
closed his fingers into her skin, not hard. "Let her alone,"
repeated Veen.</p>

<p>"You been doin' it?" asked Lockyear.</p>

<p>Her face was solemn, afraid, homelier than before. Having met
his glance she wouldn't take her eyes away; he tried to stare her
down but couldn't. "What's the matter?" he said. "I'm a snake
that's got you hypnotized? Tell me what I asked. You doin' it?" He
slid his arm downward, fixed his hand around one breast. Her
breathing quickened and he caught the rapid strokes of her heart;
she was afraid of him but afraid to move when he touched her.
Suddenly he dug into her breast with his fingers and twisted. She
screamed.</p>

<p>Veen cried, "You son-of-a-bitch," and he seized a chunk of
firewood and flung it into Lockyear's back. He was on his feet with
another stick when Cal swung and rushed him. He drove the chunk
into Cal's chest, wrenched it back to strike again, and had it
knocked from his hands. The older Lockyear hit his brother flat on
the mouth, caught him and closed his two hands around Veen's
throat&mdash;tips of his fingers behind Veen's neck, thumbs hooked
across Veen's windpipe; he pressed Veen against the wall and
squeezed until he shut off the smaller one's wind.</p>

<p>"God-damned good time to kill you," he said.</p>

<p>Veen punched his doubled knee into his brother's belly and drove
the bigger man away; he leaped forward&mdash;a broken noise in his
throat, a crazy cast to his face&mdash;and jabbed his extended
thumbs forward, missing Cal's eyes but ripping the skin beneath; he
ducked Cal's arms, rammed his head into Cal's chest and got his
arms locked about his brother and pushed him against the bunk. Cal
tripped and fell on it, and used his hands to fend away Veen's
blind swings; then suddenly he gave out a yell of rage, caught Veen
around the body and flung him to the floor; and as Veen started to
rise Cal kicked him back and whirled to catch up a chunk of wood.
"I'm goin' to batter your brains&mdash;this time I'll do it." He
turned with the stick and flung it, missing. Veen wrenched himself
upright, snatched Cal's gun from its rack by the fire and pointed
it at his brother.</p>

<p>"Put that down," said Lockyear.</p>

<p>"Stay there," said Veen between broken gusts of wind.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;put it down," said Cal, and stepped forward.</p>

<p>"I've made up my mind," said Veen. "Don't do it."</p>

<p>Lockyear shouted at him. "Don't tell me what to do!"</p>

<p>"Come on," said Veen. "Come right on into it. I'll put the lead
low right through your gut, right through your liver. You'll scream
for an hour. Come right on."</p>

<p>Lockyear stood still.</p>

<p>Veen nodded to Roxy. "Pick up your things and walk home. You
ain't goin' to stay here any more. We've had enough."</p>

<p>Roxy came out of her corner, ducked under the gun and went to
the door. She turned back, speaking to Veen. "You better kill
him&mdash;you better, or he'll do it to you. Go ahead, kill him. Go
ahead. Do it now."</p>

<p>"Go home," said Veen. "Go on quick."</p>

<p>She disappeared, her feet striking soft in the yard. The sound
died and Veen's coarse breath ceased to rasp the room. He shook his
head, splashing blood on the floor. "I ought to do it," he
said.</p>

<p>"About the girl..." said Cal. "That's all right. I'm sick of
her. She can go.</p>

<p>"Don't go after her."</p>

<p>"I would if I wanted, but I don't want to. Put the gun down.
Better with us when there's no bitch around here. You been usin'
her."</p>

<p>"Shut up," said Veen.</p>

<p>"She was a good thing for you. You ain't had much of that stuff.
Only woman you'd ever get to look at you. Women don't want
cripples."</p>

<p>"Shut up."</p>

<p>"Put the gun dawn. The hell with it."</p>

<p>Veen laid the gun against the wall and stood by it while he
watched his brother. Cal shrugged his shoulders and sat on the
bunk. He reached for his pipe and ignored his brother. "We'll quit
this fighting."</p>

<p>"All right," said Veen and turned to the back door. From the
side of his eyes, Cal watched him drop his guard; then sprang
unexpectedly over the small space, seized Veen, swung him, hurled
him to the floor. He fell on his brother, sinking his knee into
Veen's stomach. He caught Veen's shoulders and lifted and lowered
them and pounded the little man's head against the floor until the
latter's body went loose. Afterwards he rose and took his gun and
settled on the bunk to wait. Presently Veen groaned and rolled his
head back and forth and reached out aimlessly with his arms.</p>

<p>"You hear me?" asked Cal.</p>

<p>Veen sat up.</p>

<p>"That's to teach you something," said Cal. "Don't ever lay a
hand on me again. Next time I'll kill you. I don't care about the
girl. Don't want her around any more. You think I don't know you
been foolin' me? Hell, ten times a day. You been draggin' yourself
around half-dead. She's sucked the sap right out of you. By God,
she wants you to kill me. She's got you where you'd do it, too. I
don't want her here any more."</p>

<p>Veen sat stooped. Blood ran steadily from his nose and he swayed
side to side to soothe the pain in his stomach. He said, "I'll
leave."</p>

<p>"Try it," said Cal, "and I'll tie you down and smash the bones
in your other foot. Then you won't walk at all."</p>

<h2><a name="ch50" id="ch50"></a>Chapter 50</h2>

<p>ALL through April Burnett worked on the road; each morning,
stoked with food, he crossed the meadow, followed the road he had
chopped out and came before the barrier of trees yet to be cut; at
noon, hollow with hunger, he ate again and returned to the barrier;
at twilight, weariness greater than hunger, he turned home. In the
morning he had so much energy to spend; at night he had spent it.
He hacked and twisted and cleared and burned his way through the
forest five feet, ten feet, a day. He left two months of his life
in that timber; during the first week of May he dropped the last
tree at the margin of Lattimore's clearing and he looked back to
see the two months of his life as an aisle between the firs. From
Lattimore's meadow he could see his own cabin half a mile away. He
touched the stumps along the way when he returned home; this was
half a day of his life, this cut stump; this was half a day, this
corduroy stretch over the swampy spot. Later, from his own yard he
watched Lattimore's lamplight dance through the corridor.</p>

<p>The road was two months of his life; the cabin, fences, shed,
millrace, lumber pile&mdash;those were four months of his life. Six
months of his life lay around him; he saw it and touched it; he had
frozen it in this one place so that it would not slide down the
tunnel of the past. It was a good thing to look on his life; when
he was an old man he could say this was what he had been and this
was what he had done. Beyond his time, after he was dead, it would
burn or rot or the creeping brush would erase his work and erase
the memory of him; but that was beyond his time. It occurred to him
that Katherine had this in mind when she had said she never wanted
to move, never wanted to throw away anything she had liked or which
had been part of her life; she wanted all the pieces accumulated
around her in one place.</p>

<p>It had been his habit, after work and supper, to saddle the
horse and go down to Gay's; this night in the odored spring
darkness he traveled the trail again, past the Lattimores',
Irishs'&mdash;dropping a bucket of milk there&mdash;past the dark
shell of the schoolhouse, past Provost's, Collingwood's. The
familiar shadows and sounds and shapes closed about him as the warm
blankets of a bed into which he had beaten out comfortable
indentations for his particular bones; and in such a mood he had
great regret for his traveling years. They were gone; the man back
there was a shadowy man.</p>

<p>Gay and Katherine and Mrs. Gay were in the new cabin. Martha
said: "You see Joe anywhere on the trail? Always running with the
Provost boys, or the Dunmores. You'd think a long day's work would
make him tired. This country's making him wild."</p>

<p>Gay said: "If he ain't wild now he'll be flatter than old beer
later."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that Sophy Cartwell's running with them,
too."</p>

<p>"Joe had any fights with the boys lately?"</p>

<p>"He'd not tell me. Why?"</p>

<p>"I recall the first Sophy Cartwell I knew," said Gay.</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with fighting?"</p>

<p>There was no power left on Gay's face for smiling; his amusement
was back in his eyes, made vague by clouds of pain rising from his
flesh. Observing it, Martha said: "I know what's in the boy, well
as you."</p>

<p>"Then let it be."</p>

<p>"I won't have Sophy Cartwell trapping her way into this family.
Joe's too young for it and if I'm going to have a grandchild I'd
like to be sure whose it is."</p>

<p>Gay said, "Mill finished?"</p>

<p>"Another month," said Burnett. "The road's just slashed."</p>

<p>"If I had it to do over," said Gay, "I'd not've worked so hard.
Back home, every time I picked a peach from the orchard I thought,
'It ought to be a juicy peach, there's a gallon of my sweat in it.'
I got awful serious awful fast. All the people I liked did the
same. I make out now it wasn't intended so."</p>

<p>Burnett thought: <i>He's Hawn's dying trapper, seeing too late
what it ought to have been. He's the old man in St. Louis
regretting the things he didn't do. Right road, left
road&mdash;which was the best road now there's no more
roads?</i></p>

<p>"Go hunting," said Gay. "Go fight somebody."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said Burnett. "I had no luck arguing the
crowd out of fighting the Molalas. You could have stopped
them."</p>

<p>"I'd not've tried," said Gay. "There's time when men are not to
be argued with. You didn't go with the bunch. I'd've gone and tried
to catch 'em when they were in a more reasonable mind. You got to
put up with a lot to gain a little&mdash;and it's better to gain a
little than gain nothing. The only gains we make are little
ones."</p>

<p>His words came shallow from the top of his mouth.</p>

<p>"That's enough talk," said Martha and sent Katherine and Burnett
from the house.</p>

<p>The last of washday's fire glowed red in the yard. Gram drifted
gray and half seen in the shadows beyond it; from the big wagon
rose the Old Man's steady snoring. Katherine said: "You see the
change in him? It won't be long."</p>

<p>They walked toward the trail from it across the meadow by the
creek. Day's warmth rose from the plowed ground, and odor rose with
it&mdash;musky, stale-rotted, effervescent-fresh, yeast muck
stinking, pale green tendrils breathing. The creek broke white
across its stones, this whiteness penciling the shadows, and
moonlight shaped the alders crooked against the water. The creek
flowed; and coolness was a stream flowing above the creek, the
edges of coolness lapping them as the creek lapped the shore.</p>

<p>"He was talking to me&mdash;telling me something," said
Burnett.</p>

<p>"The old always try to tell us something. But it's hard to know
what they're saying. It's all mixed up in them. They
know&mdash;they don't know. They're trying to leave something
behind that's wise, but they're not sure, no more than we are...He
wanted to be a musician."</p>

<p>"Suppose he had been. What would he be saying now?"</p>

<p>"The same thing. It makes no difference." She settled at the
creek, her hand bringing him down. She tipped her shoulder against
him for support.</p>

<p>"Good man&mdash;good man."</p>

<p>"He's been lying in bed all these weeks, trying to think what
his life's been. We'll do it, too." A cloud moved beneath the moon
to darken the night; in the deep hills the coyotes were crying.
"That's lonesome," she said. "Good lonesome. Like bones picked
clean, like rock or fire. It's not mixed up with anything else. Do
your feet still hurt?"</p>

<p>"When the weather's cold."</p>

<p>"They'll trouble you a long time."</p>

<p>He waited for her head to turn, he bent inward. Her mouth was
quiet, almost giving, not quite giving, and as soon as he pressed
forward she drew back and her laughing whisper brushed the
darkness. "Oh, no." She rose and drew him with her. "Cold here."
They crossed the field and came to the trail, and turned into it,
and back again toward Collingwood's. The moving cloud gave motion
to the earth around them&mdash;the meadow creeping beneath their
feet, the fence lines crawling forward, the hills bending. Pale
wool fluffs of light lay banked against the dripping soot of the
fir shadows, the coyotes were calling, the small wind thickened
with the scent of fir resin. They passed into the vault-black
timber and the motion of the earth ceased.</p>

<p>"That a bear I hear?"</p>

<p>"Tree groaning in the wind," he said. "Big tree, deep groan." He
took her hand; her fingers closed solid around his palm. He was
restless, neither pleased with the kiss he had given her nor happy
with her answer; they weren't as close now as they had been before.
She had moved away from him and he didn't understand her and wasn't
easy in her presence. Collingwood's cabin light wavered through the
trees and in a moment they came to the meadow and halted there.</p>

<p>He said: "Whitcomb been back here since George was drowned?"</p>

<p>"They're free."</p>

<p>"We'll see."</p>

<p>"I don't make that out. It's what they've been after."</p>

<p>"Funny things," she said. "Funny things." She turned around.
"Can't work all day, walk all night. I have got to send you
home."</p>

<p>He took her hand but now it was light in his palm, no pressure
there; it waited to drop away. She walked beside him, slightly
ahead, and he quickened his pace to keep up with her, but she was
still ahead of him and he got the notion she was smiling to
herself.</p>

<p>"What funny things?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know? When's the mill to be done?"</p>

<p>"In time for the wheat&mdash;barely. Late July."</p>

<p>"Then the waiting's over. Then we're settled. It will never be
the same again."</p>

<p>"Nothing's over," he said.</p>

<p>"What's not over?"</p>

<p>"Nothing's over."</p>

<p>Gay's clearing was a streak through the trees and the cabin
lights made yellow patches against the dark. "Yes it is," she said.
"Things don't wait."</p>

<p>"What's not waiting?" She was only a step before him but the
illusion of a greater and greater distance between them got strong
and he pulled her to a stop. "What's not waiting?" She was stiff,
waiting to be released; she was on guard and her mouth was cool. He
tried to break through the coolness, and felt a small agitation
within her, a willingness and a coming back to him, but suddenly
she whirled and seized his arm and moved rapidly on, out of the
trees and across the Gay meadow to the fire.</p>

<p>She touched the coals with her foot, rousing a shower of white
sparks. "It's late." She looked at him keenly and he saw the
roundness of her eyes and the almost blackness of them. Laughter
was on her mouth and he felt helpless before her confidence. He
said, "Good night," and rode away.</p>

<p>She crouched at the fire, took a stick, and poked at the coals.
Her mother called from the cabin, "Now don't spook there all night,
we've got a lot to do tomorrow," and she answered, "All right," and
watched the coals. She heard Gram's light feet whispering over the
yard and felt the old woman's eyes peering at her. Sensation ran
through her body, and collected and made its heavy places; she
jammed the stick into the coals, broke it, flung it away and looked
over to Gram. The old woman looked at her and nodded and seemed
pleased.</p>

<p>"No," said Katherine.</p>

<p>Gram moved her shoulders indifferently.</p>

<p>"It's Edna," said the girl.</p>

<p>Old Gram shook her head. "Then why's he come here?"</p>

<p>"Because he can't go to her."</p>

<p>"No," said Gram. "I've seen it too long not to see what I see.
He'll be back."</p>

<p>"It's hard," said Katherine. "It's like being squeezed in a
vise."</p>

<p>Gram settled to the ground, nodded and drew a palm idly over the
ground, gathering dirt; she turned her hand to rub the dirt around
her palm. She said, "That's good stuff. We're made of it." She rose
and walked toward the wagon. From the house Martha called,
"Katherine&mdash;come to bed," in an aggrieved voice. Katherine
hovered over the fire, watching purple color flutter through the
sullen coals. She laid her hands on the dirt, pressed them down,
drew them up, laced them over her knees. She watched the fire.</p>

<h2><a name="ch51" id="ch51"></a>Chapter 51</h2>

<p>EACH finished chore bred other chores. The road was done but at
some slack time it needed widening, grading, and graveling in the
wet spots. These he added to the list of work for fall and winter
work and as the list lengthened he saw that the second year would
be no easier than the first. Throughout the settlement other men
would be discovering the same thing; there was no free land, no
painless plenty. The first people in a new country were the ones
who best knew the cost of every usable thing. Having so much to do
and only his hours and his energy to do it with, Burnett found
himself calculating each piece of labor with a kind of miserliness
he had not possessed before; he had to balance one necessity
against another and to ignore that which was less important. Even a
lost bucket became a serious thing, for it took all of a day's work
to make a new bucket. More and more he became the conservative,
weighing his wish to do things against his ability to do them, and
in this way he came to understand the skepticism of the older ones
when faced with something new, and their preference for the things
which existed as against the things which might be; they remembered
the hardness of creating what they had and were repelled by the
thought of carelessly throwing it aside.</p>

<p>He turned to the mill wheel, lining the shaft from the creek to
the site of the millhouse, and building on paddles and sideboards
and braces; he opened the head gate and watched the wheel turn to
the water, and discovered that it revolved at uneven speed, and he
spent three days changing paddles and adding counterbalance strips.
He laid the bed for his lower millstone, framed-in the millhouse,
built bearings for the shaft which held the stones. With the help
of Billy Lord and Lattimore and the schoolmaster he set the stones
one over the other. He built a loading platform and a chute to feed
the wheat between the stones, and troughs to catch the flour as it
trickled from the furrows of the nether stone. These things done,
he opened the head gate and put his mill in motion and made a trial
run with half a sack of wheat. Now he found that his stones did not
evenly grind and he used up the better part of four days
re-aligning the shaft.</p>

<p>He worked against time as June came on; he worked from the
beginning of light until light faded, and did his chores by lantern
light, and cooked a quick meal, and fell asleep as soon as he
struck the bed. He grew stale, his cooking no longer pleased him.
He shot a stringy deer and found no flavor in the meat; it supplied
him with strength but dissatisfied his taste, and he had spells of
thinking of jams and relishes and sweet and sour flavors until
sensation tortured him. One day Billy Lord came by to say he was
bound for Oregon City and did Rice want anything done there?
Burnett got two dollars from his money belt. "Bring me a gallon of
the rawest, meanest whisky you can find." He was as sour as he had
ever been, he was work-bound, his temper was short. It was the same
with the rest of the settlement. Twelve months had passed from the
time they had left the Missouri, and harvest was nearing; the long
wait was almost over but not quite, and the last of the waiting
squeezed them hard. Though it was coming on summer, the slash fires
never ceased to burn as the land clearing went on and roads were
extended from claim to claim. Somewhere, at any hour of the
lengthening days, the ringing sound of an ax could be heard, or the
"swash, swash" of a cross-cut saw, or a man's voice cursing his
oxen forward. Winter long there had been no release for these
people and with them, as with Burnett, was the growing knowledge
that what had been begun would not be finished for years. They were
accustomed to monotony but they were also accustomed to some kind
of explosion which would temporarily break the monotony and as June
moved on the tension increased. Everybody felt it. When he dropped
down to Gay's at night&mdash;and during the building of the mill he
went only twice&mdash;he found the same tightening of manner; he
sat a little while with Gay; he stood in the yard with Katherine,
the talk between them of no consequence and hard to make; he came
home in a more ragged humor than before, and sat in his doorway to
wrestle with a puzzle that grew worse; and went to bed.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Millard, sitting in the sun, watched his wife come out of the
hillside brush. She carried a bunch of small yellow flowers already
wilting from the heat of her hand; her face was scratched, her hair
snagged by branches, and there was a familiar sign around her
mouth. It meant trouble.</p>

<p>He said: "Where the hell you go on these mountain expeditions?
It's the third time this week."</p>

<p>"Flowers," she said.</p>

<p>"I can pick the same things at the creek, twenty feet from here.
You been gone two hours."</p>

<p>"There's a berry the Indians eat. I was looking for them."</p>

<p>"Little bit early."</p>

<p>"Well, it's good to get out of the cabin and stretch my
legs."</p>

<p>He said nothing and she threw a sidewise glance at him and went
into the house. Presently she came to the doorway.</p>

<p>"I meant nothing by that, Millard. It just came out
careless."</p>

<p>"No use being mealy-mouthed about a leg I've not got," he said.
"I ain't got it. That's the situation."</p>

<p>She said: "I'll be out in a minute. I'll milk."</p>

<p>"I'll milk," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to beseem you," she said. "I don't mind doing
it."</p>

<p>"Done it so long's we've been married," he said, "and I'll
continue to do it."</p>

<p>"Millard," she said, unable to quite restrain her militancy,
"now you know what it's like to have other people do what you'd
rather do yourself in your own way. Every woman born's in that
position. Men doing this&mdash;men doing that. Always men. Woman
does something. Man tears it down and does it over his way. How do
you think we feel&mdash;made helpless when we don't want to be? At
least you've got one leg. For all a woman's permitted to do she
might as well have no legs. It ought to make you more
considerate."</p>

<p>"Ain't I been?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're better than most. But you're a man still."</p>

<p>"Intend to continue to be," he said. "When you want a castrated
animal, let me know and I'll see can I find one."</p>

<p>"Not like you talk that way," she retorted; but she held her
tongue and returned to the cabin. He did the chores and came in
with a weariness he tried to conceal, saying nothing through the
meal, and soon going to bed. She was restless, making two steps of
one; she gave out small exasperated sounds, she walked to the yard
and came back and still could not settle in peace.</p>

<p>"What's bothering you now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Can't I walk around without being bothered?"</p>

<p>"Not that way."</p>

<p>"What way?"</p>

<p>"Like every time you set your foot down you were grinding a man
under it."</p>

<p>"Since you been sick," she said irritably, "you say things you
never used to say&mdash;make it harder for me to bear, make me put
up with it. You know I can't fight you like I did and feel nice
about it. You oughtn't do it."</p>

<p>"All right," he said. But her restlessness continued and he knew
something brewed in her mind.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Burnett hadn't known Edna was in the clearing until her voice
reached for him on the roof of the millhouse. "Come down," she
said. She stood by the cabin corner, the close smile waiting for
him. He dropped to the ground, noting that her shoes were
muddy.</p>

<p>"I came through the trees," she said. "I didn't want everybody
to see me." She moved into the cabin and waited for him and
observed that he gave her body a moment's attention.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Oh, September I guess." Her smile thickened. "No, not Oregon
City. That was too long ago."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>She laughed and let him stand with his thoughts, until he said,
"Well, is it mine?"</p>

<p>"You wish it was?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I do," she said. She had expected him to come directly to her,
but he stood away and her smile wavered and then he knew she was
troubled, for her manner was unsure and she walked to him and got
her arms around him and laid her head on his shoulders. "You smell
like cedar," she said. She raised herself and kissed him with a
flare-up of her old willingness, and tipped her head to watch the
effect on him. "You still like that? Or do you get it better
somewhere else?"</p>

<p>"I like it," he said.</p>

<p>"You don't say it right," she said. "Remember the first
time?"</p>

<p>"I remember."</p>

<p>"You don't say it right. You make it sound like it's a long time
ago. Ever wish things&mdash;this thing, that thing&mdash;were
different?"</p>

<p>"Sure. A lot of things."</p>

<p>"So do I. It hurts to know they can't be. Ever wish we'd not
met?"</p>

<p>He was silent, not for the sake of pleasing her or for fear of
hurting her, but because he had to think about it. "It was a good
thing," he said.</p>

<p>"It was better than good," she said, breathing it in his ear.
"It was the best. But I wish we'd not met. I think of you too much.
Don't you think of me?"</p>

<p>"You know damned well what the answer is."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, and was pleased. "Always think of me."</p>

<p>"Too much," he said.</p>

<p>"Never too much. Just lie in bed and think of me."</p>

<p>"I have got to get rid of that," he said, "when I get
married."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "There's always room for thoughts
like that. What difference does it make, being married?" Then she
was silent, and he caught the displeasure within her. "When?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said, "I was just saying it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, Katherine. She had her way&mdash;she beat me. Right
from the beginning she made herself look like something she wasn't.
You looked for it in me. But it wasn't anything at all. She beat
me. That's when it started."</p>

<p>"What started, Edna?"</p>

<p>She rested against him. "I wish it'd been different. Wish I
hadn't met you. Wish you'd had me more when I wanted you to. Then
you'd known me better and there'd not been all this. I wish I
hadn't married Moss, I wish I'd waited. I wish I'd known
more&mdash;I could have beaten her. Then nothing would have
happened that oughtn't to. We were all right. It was a lot more
than you thought. Lot more than I thought. Because if it hadn't
been you, you wouldn't think of me now and I wouldn't mind about
you. God, why can't people know more, when they ought to know
it&mdash;not when everything's too late?"</p>

<p>She was unhappy in a way he had not felt in her; not sullen, not
offended at a little thing, but bone-deep unhappy. Her voice thick
with it, her body heavy with it. He put his arms around her and at
that motion she lifted her head and laid her broad mouth on him,
arms pulling, body pushing, hard with him, indiscriminate and
unreserved. The warmth soaked through him but he held still. She
drew away, again giving him her close look of curiosity, and
stepped over to the door. "Why has it always got to be too late to
know things? One thing I didn't know. If I had, it'd been
different."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>She kept her back to him several moments. "Don't forget, you
started this." When she turned she had recovered herself, the
assurance and the teasing expression returned. "Ah, why talk about
it? You look thin. I wish I could have come when you got back from
the accident. She was here but she didn't do what I'd have done.
Did she?"</p>

<p>He was embarrassed and she noticed it, her laughter growing.
"That's what I wish&mdash;that I'd known more about you." She
pursed her lips at him for a kiss and left the cabin. But
afterwards, back on the roof, it was the heaviness inside her he
remembered. He straddled the ridgepole and forgot to work while he
thought about it.</p>

<p>He was at the same work&mdash;laying shakes on the mill
roof&mdash;when Mrs. Millard hailed him next morning. "I have
brought you a pan of biscuits. Come down from there and thank me
for them."</p>

<p>This was her way, friendliness laced with vinegar; a pan of
biscuits and a challenge. She liked him, he thought, but she'd
never give him the advantage of being certain of her liking; and
when she was roused to the general injustice of men toward women
she could despise him as readily as she liked him. She was in good
spirits at the present moment. He followed her into the cabin.</p>

<p>"It don't look like the usual rat's nest a bachelor keeps for
himself," she said. "You must have had a good mother to teach you
what was clean and what was nice. That's where it starts." She gave
the room a thorough going-over with her eyes. She looked at the
dishes on the shelf; she ran her fingers across them. She shrugged
her shoulders at his manner of making a bed, snatched off the
blankets and rearranged them. "But you're not near as good a
housekeeper as you like to think."</p>

<p>"Didn't think so anyway," he said.</p>

<p>"Man always thinks he can do anything better than a woman. This
is a nice floor. I don't know another cabin with one as good. Why
don't you scrub it more, before it gets so grimed in it'll never
look clean?"</p>

<p>"Short of time."</p>

<p>"Certainly you're short of time. This isn't what you ought to be
doing. You've got work enough outside to keep two men busy. You
know that, don't you?"</p>

<p>He lighted his pipe and smiled at her obvious hunt for things to
disapprove of. She was a good woman, she was a salt-of-the-earth
woman; she was, for a man to live with, an unbearable woman. She
said: "You know it's silly."</p>

<p>"What's silly?"</p>

<p>"Innocent&mdash;don't look at me innocent. Woman can hide
things, but I never knew a man clever at it. You know what I mean.
It's silly. You trying to be wife and husband. It's silly. I'd
think you'd be a little ashamed."</p>

<p>He went to the shelf and got a bowl and filled it with the
gray-brown flour milled by his own stones. "First batch," he said.
"See if it makes bread. No, I'm not ashamed. Tell you what I am.
I'm sick of my own company and my own cooking&mdash;and the bed's
cold."</p>

<p>"There you are," she said, and said it in a reflective way,
speaking to herself as well as to him. "Comfort, cooking, scrubbing
your floor, washing your clothes. That's what it means to a
man."</p>

<p>"Ever think it might mean more than that to a man?"</p>

<p>"When he's courting her he thinks it does. What a cloud of
things he gets lost in! Makes them up and floats around like a
fool. In a year that's gone. Well, don't you make up those clouds
about any woman. Then you'll not fool yourself or fool her silly
brain either."</p>

<p>"Never heard you run a woman down."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I've got any more patience for a woman than
for a man," she said.</p>

<p>"It doesn't leave you much, does it?"</p>

<p>She looked back at him from the doorway, half amused, half ready
to argue. She was a sharp woman, nobody's fool. "You don't like me
much," she said.</p>

<p>"Was I in a fight," he said, "I'd feel better having you on my
side than on the other."</p>

<p>"I know. That's what they think about me. I can't help it."</p>

<p>"Wonder how it got that way with you," he said.</p>

<p>She turned her back to him, watching the meadow and the hill
beyond. "Same way some people have got weak eyes, long legs. Born
so."</p>

<p>"Born half so," he amended.</p>

<p>She turned again and was curt with him. "Don't you go prying.
It's none of your business." She resumed her scanning of the
meadow. "Pretty here, though I think I'd rather have the cabin
turned about to see the creek. Wouldn't be so lonesome for a woman.
Creek moves and makes noise. You ought to be married. You really
ought."</p>

<p>"Now whose business have we got into?"</p>

<p>"That's different," she said. "What are those berries the
Indians like?"</p>

<p>"Huckleberries."</p>

<p>"I've been walking the hills looking for them. You know there's
a trail on the ridge across the creek? It comes from Lockyear's way
and goes down to Rinearson's."</p>

<p>"Had no time to look yonder."</p>

<p>"He passed me by yesterday but he didn't see me in the brush."
Now her voice was angry in a new way; this was controlled and
single-minded. Her voice was quiet. "He was walking in a hurry, his
face was all animal, all stirred up." She let go with a rough
breath. "That terrible man&mdash;that beast. I hope someday to hear
him being killed. I hope it happens." She was still for a
considerable interval. "There's nothing his hand touches don't get
hurt. Nothing. It's the third time I saw him. Last time I was clean
over on the edge of Rinearson's valley. You know where he's going,
Rice?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. He knocked his pipe ashes into the fireplace and
filled it again.</p>

<p>"It's been going on a long time&mdash;all spring, I know," she
said. Then she said, "I know it because I've seen it."</p>

<p>"Those biscuits look nice," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool. Never mind if her mouth is hot enough to burn
a hole in your face. She'll burn holes in other faces, too."</p>

<p>"I thank you for the advice," he said.</p>

<p>"No you don't. You hate me for it, but I'll give you some more.
Then tell me to go home. Some men get sorry for what they've done
to a girl. Girls know it&mdash;they use it. Well now, if the girl
did it, she wanted to, didn't she? What's there to be sorry
for?"</p>

<p>"All right, Nancy. Go home now."</p>

<p>She turned and considered him and she shook her head; she
crossed the room to lay a hand on his shoulder. "They're devils,
Rice. They're all devils, and you better be a devil to handle 'em."
An expression of compassion came upon her. She bent forward, kissed
him and almost ran from the cabin.</p>

<p>He walked to the yard and caught himself a drink from the bucket
and watched her hurry over the meadow. He took up his hatchet, laid
a bundle of shakes over one shoulder and climbed the ladder to the
roof; he anchored the shakes into the roof sheeting and sat back to
stare at the ridge across the creek. <i>Lockyear. Lockyear and
Edna. For Christ's sake, why? Any man, any other man, but what did
she want with him?</i></p>

<p>That was why she had come here yesterday, straight off the ridge
from a meeting with him, clothes soiled, shoes muddy, with
unhappiness thick enough within her to be cut by a knife. He laid a
shake and nailed it in; and rested again. He thought, "Nancy
Millard never saw that, she's guessing," but he couldn't make it
stick, for he knew Edna, he knew the necessity of those big hips.
Moss couldn't drain her; she would exhaust him, dry him to powder
and blow him away. And she had come here stained and unhappy. He
brought Lockyear before him, face and voice and brutal energy, and
he caught the edge, the faint edge, of the truth. The power was
there. Lockyear was a match for her. She was unhappy, for no man
had penetrated her self-sufficiency. She had never been thrown
beyond herself, never had lost command. His own experience told him
so; from Oregon City onward she was lodged in him, and after
marriage she had returned to keep herself there. But Lockyear shook
her and made her dependent; for she was unhappy. She might hate the
man, but he had her and she'd go back.</p>

<p>He had believed that somewhere within Edna was an untouched part
and this was the mystery which had held him on. Now he couldn't
believe it, not after Lockyear. It was no mystery, it was big hips
churning because they had to churn. She knew that about herself,
and laughed at him because he didn't know it.</p>

<p>He laid down a shake and drove the nail home. There was no
mystery. Then he recalled her phrase, "I'm sorry I met you, because
that's when it started," and he realized she had come back to tell
him it was he who had set her hips into motion. Maybe she wasn't
honest about that, but the words stuck in him. His hammer came
down, drove a nail deep into the shake and split the shake.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch52" id="ch52"></a>Chapter 52</h2>

<p>BEYOND noon, bound out from Oregon City on his rounds, Whitcomb
paused at the Lords' and found both people lazing in the back yard.
Lord had built an outdoor bed between two fir trees, a stout
contraption of poles, laced rawhide and thick comforters, and
sheltered by a canvas canopy which was rigged in such a manner that
when he hauled on a rope hanging near his pillow the whole thing
shifted to meet the weather. Man and wife lay side by side on the
bed, mountainous in shape, faces smooth and childlike. Lord made
great work of rising. "God-damn' weather takes it right out of
me...Stay to eat?"</p>

<p>He wanted, Whitcomb explained, only a drink of water and then he
had to cover the settlement and start back by early morning. A pair
of red hens picked around the yard. Dirty dishes still stood on an
outdoor table, and through the cabin's doorway he caught brief
sight of an untidy room. Winter rain and spring sun had weathered
the newness from the cabin logs; a hard scrabble garden slanted
along the sunny slope of the hill and a makeshift lean-to, scarcely
tight enough to afford animals shelter, stood at the edge of the
trees&mdash;four convenient firs making its corner posts. He saw no
fences about the place. For this easygoing couple, the little they
had was enough; there was no acquisitiveness, no push, no worry in
them. Judged by the settlement's standards, they were lazy and
improvident people and when they got old the community would have
them to worry about; yet to Whitcomb this knoll standing above the
settlement was a peaceful island. He stepped down to the spring
house and had his drink and for a moment admired the view below
him. Mrs. Irish's green meadow, the straight garden rows back of
her cabin, the glint of the creek running its curved course, the
islands of timber along the narrow valley, the clearings lying
between. The wheat was high and turning amber in every field;
cattle browsed the pastures, the small shapes of people moved with
a distance-exaggerated slowness. Everywhere he saw the scars of
slashing, the yellow streaks of road grading and the blue curl of
brush fires. It was a fine settlement, sheltered in this pocket far
from the rumors of trouble.</p>

<p>He found Mrs. Irish and the schoolmaster and young Watt at
table, and he could not refuse a dinner ready before him, and ate
and paid for the meal by such idle gossip as he had at hand. He had
not met the schoolmaster before and found the man a little hard to
know, somehow awkward and ill at ease, a suggestion of the
domineering mixed with a suggestion of the diffident. The gray eyes
were cold and set close, the mouth was fleshy, the face generally
intelligent. At the first opportunity Whitcomb left them, turning
toward Gay's, and as soon as he passed into the trees he began to
look forward for first sight of Lucy's cabin. He was eager to see
her again; eager but strongly apprehensive.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
"There's a good man," said Mrs. Irish. "An awfully good man."</p>

<p>"Don't expect he makes much of a living," said the schoolmaster.
"People have to be pretty sick to call a doctor, and can't pay when
they do."</p>

<p>"I'd not guess he cares much."</p>

<p>"Be remarkable if he don't. We're all out here to root-hog or
die. Were I in his shoes I'd certainly see to it I got paid in some
form&mdash;money, wheat, shoes, calico or something."</p>

<p>"He's an awfully good man," said Mrs. Irish again.</p>

<p>"People always like a man that's kind, comes at beck and call,
and asks nothing. But they don't love him so much when he presents
the bill." He looked at her, he looked at Watt sitting silent over
the table. "I imagine I take the hard side of things. I got
larruped when I was young and I got no favors when I was grown.
Principles get beat in pretty deep that way." He studied Watt a
moment and he tried a lighter manner. "That's the way I teach, as
Watt knows well."</p>

<p>From time to time Mrs. Irish had cast quick side surveys at her
incommunicative son; and now she said, "I wish you'd go up the
meadow and fix that fence the ox broke through."</p>

<p>"All right," said Watt and rose and left the room.</p>

<p>"He's always quiet in front of people he don't know well," said
Mrs. Irish.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster shook his head. "The boy's jealous."</p>

<p>"Jealous?" Mrs. Irish gave out an uncertain laugh, looked at him
and let her glance remain with its smiling. "I never heard of such
a thing. A boy of fourteen."</p>

<p>"Man of fourteen," said the schoolmaster. "A hard-worked man
who's been head of the family and don't take kindly to another man.
And I don't look anything like his father looked."</p>

<p>"But, <i>jealous,"</i> said Mrs. Irish. "What on earth could he
be jealous of?"</p>

<p>The schoolmaster rose, his shrunken coat sleeves crawling back
from lank wrists. He shrugged his shoulders and pulled the sleeves
toward his wrists and stepped to the door. "I have got half a day's
road work to do for Rinearson. He a reliable man&mdash;pays his
bills?"</p>

<p>"Well able to," said Mrs. Irish.</p>

<p>"I'd not want to waste half a day's work otherwise," said he.
"There's too much waste behind me as is."</p>

<p>"I'd never judge you to be a waster."</p>

<p>"It's not that," said the schoolmaster, and took a stand at the
doorway, looking into the meadow. He put his hands behind him,
laced his fingers together. "I'm one of those men that seldom catch
a tide on the full swing. Usually when I jump in to swim, the
current's changing and I have to work harder than should be. It
took me six years to study law&mdash;a twelve-hour job on the side,
and my father's debts to pay. I set out to practice in hard times,
was forced to turn to farm labor. I come here and the country's
full of lawyers with no clients. I don't cry over the matter. It's
the way my life works, and I recognize it and expect it to be the
same way all through. I only say I was cut out to do two day's work
for one day's reward and therefore I have got to rise earlier than
most and go to bed later than most." With scarcely a change of tone
or a pause, he added, "Had you thought of me as a man you might
marry?"</p>

<p>She said, "Why, I hadn't thought of it, I mean I'd maybe
wondered&mdash;" She stopped herself. She said, "Turn around, Mr.
McGregor."</p>

<p>He turned to meet a grave woman. "Yes, I'd thought of it," she
said.</p>

<p>He said, "Don't smoke, don't drink. I'm on the tight side. I'm
never idle if I can help it. The young ones in school are afraid of
me but that's as it should be. I don't make friends easily and
people don't make me out for quite a spell. I guess that's because
I've had no time to waste, and spending time to talk comes hard. I
appear to be a positive man. I guess I am. I appear cold." He let
that much stand and after a short interval he put in a short
defense of himself. "There is, however, another side to me, and if
we got on I'd expect to show it to you."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I don't know. I'd not know what to say about
myself."</p>

<p>"I don't expect it. You've had hard times. I admire the way you
go about it."</p>

<p>She said, "You know I'd have to talk to Watt."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"It's not that I don't know my own mind, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's your son, he's fourteen, and he don't like me. Naturally
you've got to talk to him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he just don't know you yet. But he's not had much of a
life. We've been poor, he's worked harder than he ought, and he
ain't had the fun any boy ought. It's too late now. He's not going
to get it, because he's too old. Sometimes when he's not around to
hear I cry about that. I don't want him to be so grave and I don't
want him going through life with his head down, thinking of the
next chore to do, not looking up, not smiling, not friendly. If it
were only me, I'd give you a quick word on it, for I'm mighty tired
of being alone. But it's not only me. I can't do anything to make
it worse for him than it's been. I can't do it."</p>

<p>"Go talk to him," he said.</p>

<p>"I'll try to make him see."</p>

<p>He looked long at her and nodded. "I know," he said. "I know it
all."</p>

<p>She moved to the door, watching him cross the bridge and move
along the road at his ground-chopping stride; and after she cleared
the table and stacked the dishes she stepped into the yard and
circled the cabin to observe Watt at the far end of the meadow. She
made a false start toward him, halted herself and presently, with
an air of uncertainty, she crossed the meadow. He had seen her
coming but he worked at the dislodged fence rails and paid no
attention; his manner was strange, as though he knew what was in
her head and she thought: <i>Maybe he does, he's old enough.</i>
She said: "The beast gets its head through and shoves up. That rail
will have to be tied to the post."</p>

<p>Watt said: "Then he'll try another section. I have got to nail a
top on these posts."</p>

<p>"That's work."</p>

<p>"Be the end of chasing the critter every day."</p>

<p>He was on his knees and reared back to look toward the road; his
eyes sought and settled on the dwindling shape of the schoolmaster.
"Where's he going?"</p>

<p>"Rinearson's&mdash;road work."</p>

<p>He returned to his job and she stood idle behind him, only half
inclined to speak. <i>Why ought I be afraid of my own son? It's
me&mdash;it's not him. It's me.</i> She grew still. She braced
herself to speak. He looked back at her with his dry face, with the
strained old gravity which hurt her so much to see.</p>

<p>"How long's he going to eat with us?"</p>

<p>"Till school's out, Watt. He's paying. It helps us."</p>

<p>He turned again to his work and his back was hostile. "It don't
help much."</p>

<p>"Everything helps."</p>

<p>"It don't help much."</p>

<p>"You don't like him. Why don't you like him?"</p>

<p>Then she saw that he only pretended to work; his hands moved
around the fence rail but did nothing. His voice was sullen. Below
the sullenness was an uncertainty she hadn't heard from him for a
long while; he was a little boy at the moment and he was afraid.
"You going to let him marry you?"</p>

<p>She summoned up her courage, she thought of what she wanted to
say, she watched his small back stiffen as it waited. "No," she
said. "No, there's nothing to that"&mdash;and turned back over the
field.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Lucy was in the garden hoeing, and she smiled at Whitcomb and
turned again to her work. He stepped from the saddle, and spent a
moment untying the knotted reins to let them hang on the ground; it
was a way of wasting time to cover an awkward moment. Then she
straightened and set the hoe aside and came forward, moving a hand
around her hair. She said, "The weeds get ahead of me." He tried to
catch and hold her glance but it touched him and moved on to the
horse. "Is that a new saddle?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you eaten?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Irish had it on the table when I got there."</p>

<p>"You'll be seeing Gay?"</p>

<p>"I'll see him, and make the rounds."</p>

<p>She brushed her skirt, she kept her hands busy. "It's warm." Her
eyes lifted to him, dropped to her hands. "Well, come in for a
moment and rest." He followed her through the door, still awkward
and a small amount of anger still rankling him. <i>I've to break
this quick,</i> he thought, <i>or it'll get so hard it can't be
broken.</i> He caught her arm and turned her to him and kissed her.
She brought up her hands to his shoulders lightly and her mouth was
still; he felt indecision in her, as though she debated being
generous with him; then it seemed to pass and she waited for him to
be through. He knew what it was and he knew nothing could remove it
but a passionate outburst on his part. He had to wash it away with
words and impetuousness, thereby convincing her that he thought as
much of her now as before. As a married woman she had not regretted
her generosity to him. But this was different; she was free, she
wanted him to look at her as the woman he loved and wished to have,
not as a mistress; and she regretted their meetings, fearing that
he put less value on her because of them. Since Collingwood's death
he had known this would come. The naturalness between them was gone
and he could only bring it back by losing his head all over again.
Much as he loved her he found it a hard part to play. Outside the
conventions they had been themselves; now the conventions required
them to ignore what had been so real and to go through the proper
moves of a game as though their previous closeness had not existed.
He knew what he had to do, but couldn't bring himself to it, and
she sensed the delay in him as he had sensed it in her. She turned
away from him and moved around the room, making talk.</p>

<p>"He's not the man you saw two weeks ago. I think the family
would rather see him die soon than go on suffering."</p>

<p>"Dying has got its own ritual. Nothing to be done about it." How
silly this was, they so far apart when they had been so close. It
was their minds which made strangers out of them.
Reason&mdash;reason&mdash;it killed. He grew more embarrassed; he
had become a small boy, all hands and feet and self-conscious
misery. He said, "I'll go on. Tonight...Would tonight be all
right?" He heard the soft, cautious words and despised himself for
them. The gentility of the gentleman. That's not what she waited
for. She wanted him to come storming in, half out of his head, and
smash her with his insistence. Not these modulated words.
<i>Straight-out...Why can't I be straight-out with it?</i></p>

<p>She moved her hands, she shrugged her shoulders. "Would it be
right?"</p>

<p>"That's what I asked you."</p>

<p>"You're older than I am. You ought to know what's best."</p>

<p>"Since when did we get so concerned about what's best, what's
right?"</p>

<p>Her glance raised quickly. Now it was intent. She was waiting,
she was hopeful. "I suppose people have to think of those things.
Don't they?"</p>

<p>"Why? We didn't before."</p>

<p>"Well, Ralph&mdash;" She dismissed it with a gesture. "Oh, come
if you wish."</p>

<p>"It will probably be after supper, probably dark." He saw the
shadow instantly cross her face and he said quickly, "Or would you
rather have it be before dark?"</p>

<p>Her whole body emitted its impatience. "Come when you want."</p>

<p>He nodded, left the cabin and rode on toward Gay's, growing
angry at her inconsistency, and his own poor showing. <i>In a thing
like that they all want a club. Why do I make so many mistakes with
her?</i> The first forthright impulse of the day came to him and
almost turned him back to knock the nonsense aside, but the
self-critical part of him viewed the showing he would play in such
a stormy role and the impulse shriveled. <i>We're in love. There
ought not be any excuses or regrets.</i> But he shook his head at
his own ignorance. <i>You don't know a damned thing about a woman.
She wants it proper now. She wants it all tidied up.</i></p>

<p><br>
<br>
Gay's voice was a whisper in his chest. Whitcomb had to bend toward
the bed to hear it. Gay's face was yellow tissue, ill-fitted to its
bony frame&mdash;cracked, hollowed and overlapped. His eyes had the
dulled light of water seen at the bottom of a well. He had been a
clean-shaven man; now he was bearded a rusty gray and white; and
with beard and withered body and eyes whose vision was set on
something beyond Whitcomb, he was not only one man dying, he was to
Whitcomb the picture of every man dying. The doctor listened to the
slow heart strike and marveled at its endurance. It was a pity that
men like Gay, constructed for use and durability, could not make an
easy surrender to the inevitable as weaker men did. People paid for
being strong. They paid as much as weak people paid for being
weak.</p>

<p>Lot White was with the family. Whitcomb sat by the bed a decent
while to give out such news as he had and in return received the
local gossip, with Gay watching the group around him but not
seeming to hear. When Whitcomb left the cabin he was followed by
Lot White and Katherine.</p>

<p>Katherine said: "How long?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. When he makes up his mind to quit it will come
quite soon."</p>

<p>Lot White jerked one hand knifewisc toward the sky. "He has got
his cross. He is acarryin' it like a Christian."</p>

<p>Katherine looked into the meadow. She had, Whitcomb thought, the
composure of her grandmother&mdash;its outward bareness and its
inner resiliency. She was not quite Lot White's kind of Christian,
hoarding up this life's misery as a bank account for future glory,
but she made no comment. Little pleasantries and little solaces
didn't impress her.</p>

<p>"You'll stay here tonight?" she said to Whitcomb.</p>

<p>"I'll make the rounds and be back. Anybody in particular I ought
to see?"</p>

<p>"Durbin Young's wife."</p>

<p>"I will ride that direction with you," said Lot and crossed the
yard for his horse.</p>

<p>Katherine laid a hand on Whitcomb as he turned. "Wait." Her
glance possessed more than ordinary directness. "You'll see
Lucy?"</p>

<p>"I've seen her."</p>

<p>She studied him and tried to make something of the remark and
decided it meant nothing. "You'll sec her again?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"She's lonely," said Katherine. It was a bare thing to say, but
Whitcomb realized she meant more and he had the notion that he saw
the whole community looking at him through her eyes. He flushed.
Katherine knew the whole story, everybody knew it&mdash;there was
no secrecy possible. They had watched the affair. All those
eyes&mdash;curious, sympathetic, profane, hungry, amused,
wise&mdash;all those eyes had viewed it. It gave him the feeling
that Lucy and he had played out their affair in the center of a
meadow with an audience rimmed around it. He was offended and yet
could not be, for the curious sensation of a silent good-wishing
came from them to him&mdash;as though, disapproving, they withheld
comment out of their common knowledge of human nature. His thoughts
and his hunger and his rebellion&mdash;and Lucy's&mdash;they knew
about those things because they knew themselves; their silence was
a kindness flowing around him to tell him they knew about those
things. But now they would have their way; through Katherine's eyes
they judged him, they spoke to him. They would have their way.</p>

<p>"Be back at suppertimc," he said and got on his horse and
crossed the creek with Lot and took the trail toward Rinearson's
valley.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch53" id="ch53"></a>Chapter 53</h2>

<p>DAYLONG sunlight played upon an earth still softened by spring
rain, and warmth and moisture unlocked the peculiar fragrance of
fertility, one odor upon another, and quickened the tempo of
growth. Rose sunset, violet evenfall and gray dusk took the day by
soft degrees into night; and the breath of the earth, dry-sweet and
spice-strong, came around Burnett with its vagrant turbulence. The
earth was a woman who, long loved and stroked, grew tense toward
the moment of explosion.</p>

<p>Burnett stood in the yard a moment; then afterthought took him
back to the cabin and he came out with his jug of whisky and rode
toward the ford. The Lattimores had already gone down, the Provost
cabin was dark; across the creek he heard the Millards talking with
one another as they moved to the trail. Farther away, toward Durbin
Young's, a deep-chested call rang through the hill notches. There
was motion and the sense of motion all around him; everybody in the
settlement seemed to be drifting toward the Irish ford. The meadows
sent their mild heat against him; the groves, when he passed
through, were like pools of cold water; but the sun had worked
loose the resin fragrance of the trees and it lay here so strong
that it was pitch in his mouth. From a distance he saw the bright
triangle of a fire in the schoolhouse yard, and voices began to
reach out, sharp notes and deep notes running together in such a
way as to remind him of the babble of geese passing high
overhead.</p>

<p>At the ford he found half the settlement already gathered. He
tied his horse to Mrs. Irish's fence and tucked his jug in the
meadow's high grass and went on to the fire.</p>

<p>"Rice," said Old Daniel.</p>

<p>"Daniel. How's your wheat?"</p>

<p>"Fine as frog's hair&mdash;twice as pretty." Old Daniel gripped
the air before him with his fists. "We got it made, we'll eat."
Fire's flame turned his bargainer's face crimson and slick; his
eyes roved the circle, saw the women in their own group beyond the
men, and settled there with the old stag's interest revived. Ared
stood beside him, a plain dull copy of his father, and Moss was
beside him.</p>

<p>"Moss&mdash;Ared," said Burnett.</p>

<p>Moss nodded; his glance touched Burnett and went away; he had
not been a friendly man since the day of his marriage. Harris Eby
pushed through the circle, his presence reducing the size of every
other man.</p>

<p>"Harris."</p>

<p>"Damned beautiful night."</p>

<p>"It's what they said Oregon was when we were listening to the
stories back East. Remember?"</p>

<p>"Remember well. They said nothing about the rain."</p>

<p>"Maybe they said it but we thought it couldn't be more than
ordinary rain."</p>

<p>"That was a year ago. Long time ago."</p>

<p>"This time last year we were on the Platte."</p>

<p>"Recall the first Indians we saw? My God, how scared we
were."</p>

<p>"Long time ago."</p>

<p>"It was the gorge that like to broke me. Never want to do that
again. Never want to be that cold or tired."</p>

<p>Whitcomb came into the circle. "Gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Ralph."</p>

<p>Lights burned in the schoolhouse. In there a fiddle made
preliminary scratches.</p>

<p>"Billy get his fiddle back?"</p>

<p>"Borrowed it."</p>

<p>"On the Platte I could have killed him for that damned scrapin'.
Later I got to listenin' for it."</p>

<p>"Long time ago."</p>

<p>Rice caught Eby's attention and he gave Whitcomb the same
signal. He drifted from the circle, stepped through the darkness to
the fence line, and got his jug from the grass and watched the two
figures waver across the beam of firelight as they moved forward.
"A little cheer," he said and passed Eby the jug.</p>

<p>"Where'd you get this stuff?"</p>

<p>"Lightning struck the cabin, ran down the log, filled the
jug."</p>

<p>Harris took his drink, lowered the jug. His breathing stopped.
He struck a foot hard against the ground, let out a spongy gust of
air and passed the jug to Whitcomb.</p>

<p>"That is correct," he said. Whitcomb drank. Rice drank, and laid
the jug in the grass. He counted the fence posts. "Two feet to the
left of the eleventh post. Remember that."</p>

<p>"Just say it's behind the post you've got your horse tied to,"
said Whitcomb.</p>

<p>"Horse might shy and take the post with him."</p>

<p>"Then," said Whitcomb, "you'll want a celestial reckoning. Take
that star over that tall fir. Line it up. She's dead on the
jug."</p>

<p>"Suppose the star falls," said Eby.</p>

<p>"In that case," said Burnett, "we'll get right down and roll for
the jug." He brought it back from the grass, passed it around for a
second drink, and hid it again.</p>

<p>"I feel like a good fight," said Eby.</p>

<p>"Who you want to fight?"</p>

<p>"That's the hell of it. I'm too big to fight anybody. Never been
able to fight anybody. You boys don't know what that means. I have
got to be good-natured. I got to be careful who I step on, like a
Percheron."</p>

<p>"I'd think it'd save you a lot of trouble," said Whitcomb,
"never have to wonder whether or not you can whip anybody."</p>

<p>"I do, though. I look at some little bastard and I say to
myself, 'Wonder if I could lick him? Wonder if he's got more brass
than I've got?' But I can't fight him and find out. I'm too big.
It's a hell of a thing. And the little bastard looks at me and jabs
me with the edge of his eyes and hates me because I'm big, sort of
darin' me to fight&mdash;when he knows damn well I can't risk
breakin' him apart. It's a hell of a thing."</p>

<p>Children whirled through the shadows with their mysterious
games, crying, skulking, rushing down the road, vanishing. More
settlers came in. The crowd grew larger around the fire and Lot
White's voice boomed across the meadow, across the creek, and broke
into fragments of echo against the hill trees. "Hallelujah!"</p>

<p>"Everybody packs something like that around," said Whitcomb.
"Everybody's got some sort of private business to wrestle with." He
laid an arm on the big man's shoulder and laughed. "To be or not to
be&mdash;that is the question with all of us. Run, sheep, run. Or,
don't run, sheep, don't run. Or, why don't I run, sheep&mdash;I
want to run but if I do, maybe I shouldn't, but if I don't I'll
regret not running, so why don't I run, sheep?"</p>

<p>Eby said to Burnett, "He's had his drink." The three strolled
back to the fire.</p>

<p>Old Daniel called from the schoolhouse, "Who's for
dancin'&mdash;here's the music, here's the women&mdash;you come
here for politics or for fun?" The younger men began to stir, to
drift away from the fire, and the younger women moved upon the
schoolhouse, their laughter like splinters of silver shining in the
dark. Edna's voice lifted and Moss drew himself together with an
uneasy motion and looked toward her. She was in the shadows, George
Provost and Laughlin Mercer standing by her; she was a magnet
swinging them from their straight course to the schoolhouse.
Burnett watched her shape sway, he listened to her easy voice trade
talk with the two men; the tone was idle and amused, but there was
something else in it, as there always had been when she spoke to
men. He watched Moss grow solemn and fretful and presently move
over to catch Edna's arm and go on to the schoolhouse with her. He
thought: <i>You're not big enough for that, little boy.</i> He felt
sorry for Moss. A small streak of jealousy stirred, a sentimental
regret of things past, a wonder for what might have been. It was a
twinge, it was the last flare of a nerve dying. As much as he knew
about her, she still had the power to hurt him.</p>

<p>Millard swung forward on his homemade crutches. "Ed."</p>

<p>"Old three-legs."</p>

<p>"Rice."</p>

<p>The fiddle briskly began a jigging tune. Old Daniel's voice
lifted. "Choose your partners!" Rice crossed the yard and stepped
inside and searched for Katherine and found her on the floor with
Harris Eby. He saw Lucy Collingwood looking on from a corner.
Whitcomb came in. "Over there," said Burnett.</p>

<p>"You, too," murmured the doctor.</p>

<p>"God damn it, man, don't tell me I wasted whisky on you."</p>

<p>Whitcomb crossed the hall and made his bow before Lucy. There
were women beside Burnett, gathered along the wall, and they had
been talking; they ceased to talk and he saw their eyes hard on
Whitcomb and Lucy&mdash;he saw the closeness of the thought on
their faces, he saw the sensations produced by the thought. Lucy
shook her head. Whitcomb spoke again and took her arm and the two
came over. Lucy smiled at Rice, she smiled sweetly, and stepped
into the yard with Whitcomb. Mrs. Mercer, beside Burnett, said,
"Ah," and bent toward Mrs. Provost with her murmur.</p>

<p>Three sets moved in and out and around and forward and back to
Old Daniel's calling, to the board-flat crash of his hands. He
stamped his feet as he called, he swayed, he laughed.</p>

<p><i>"Ladies to the right, gents to the left!"</i>
</p>

<p>Billy Lord sat on a bench, the double folds of his chin settled
on the fiddle, moon-round face dreaming, little eyes watching the
crowd. Katherine, smiling, faced Eby and flirted with him; they
circled, side to side, back to back, and faced each other again,
and she watched the big man with her lips parted and her head
cocked aside; she flirted with him. Burnett stepped into the yard
and lighted his pipe. The older men were comfortable in the
darkness, talking.</p>

<p>"Dig down, cut the roots, and let the stump rot. No use
burning&mdash;it won't burn unless it's old."</p>

<p>"Dig a pit under and keep a steady fire. She'll burn."</p>

<p>"Not fresh fir stumps. They won't burn."</p>

<p>"They'll burn. Dig a pit."</p>

<p>"I don't know. Corn don't look good. We got to have cracklin'
hot weather. This ain't corn country. If it ain't corn country it
ain't hog country, either."</p>

<p>"It's hog country. There's mast aplenty."</p>

<p>"If it wasn't hog country I wouldn't stay. I have got to have my
bacon and salt pork."</p>

<p>Burnett moved on. Moonlight glowed cream-yellow through a thin
heat mist and paled the shadows lying banked along the edge of the
fir grove. Lord's hill was a dark bump against a darker sky. Music,
sound and light rose from this clearing and was sucked into the
roundabout silence, the endless, bottomless silence. Warmth still
rose from the earth with grass scent and dust scent; the
schoolhouse logs exhaled a raw wood odor. He walked on with his
pipe. Shapes were around him, two and two, drifting beyond the
light, beyond earshot. He came to the timber and drew back from a
sudden-rising pair on the earth; turning, he heard the girl's short
laugh. Deep in the timber was the threshing of children, their
hooting, their long crying. More men stood by the fire and other
settlers moved in, and a horseman's shape was vague beyond the fire
the horse stopped, the rider looking on. In the schoolhouse the
music quit; he turned back and found Katherine still with Eby.</p>

<p>The room had grown warm and Eby dashed the sudden sweat from his
cheeks. "I'd handle a plow all day long and not do this. Which post
was it, Rice?"</p>

<p>"Eleven."</p>

<p>Eby went laughing away. Around the walls older people made thick
witness-rows, and lantern light darkened their faces and flashed
against their eyes until it reminded Burnett of a councilhouse in
Mandan country&mdash;smoky and dim and crowded&mdash;the tribe
listening, the tribe looking on, the tribe judging.</p>

<p>Katherine said, "Sober&mdash;sober," and laughed at him. She was
new to him; there was knowledge in her&mdash;the devil was in
there. Where was Lot? The devil was all over the place tonight.
"Next set?"</p>

<p>"Next set. Where'd you get the jug?"</p>

<p>"Sent to Oregon City for it."</p>

<p>"A man and a jug."</p>

<p>Old Daniel came whooping into the hall, a bucket in each hand, a
dipper in each bucket. "Now then," he cried, "now then: Whisky or
water? Can't dance without one or the other. Whisky or water?"</p>

<p>"Come over here," shouted Billy Lord. "I have got to baptize
this fiddle."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mercer's baby woke from a sound sleep and set up a toylike
crying. Mrs. Mercer opened her dress and put it to feeding. Old
Daniel circled the room with his buckets and dippers. "Whisky or
water?"</p>

<p>Burnett said, "That reminds me&mdash;wonder how my jug is." He
took Katherine's arm. "We'll go see." He started from the
schoolhouse and was halted by the angry bark of a voice and the
sudden collision of flesh. Couples moved back from the center of
the floor&mdash;they were pushed back by the swift, roundabout
rushing of young Hardy Provost and Abe Mercer.</p>

<p>"You been breedin' that scab on your nose," said Hardy
Provost.</p>

<p>"Knock it oil&mdash;knock it off," said Abe Mercer. They plunged
on, fists spatting; they drew back, wary. Old Daniel moved in with
his laughter and knocked down their arms. "You ain't got room
enough to fight here. Go outside." He caught them and shoved them
over the floor, herded them from the place, and turned back to his
chore. "Whisky or water come on&mdash;come on. Warm up that fiddle,
Billy. My God, it's been a long time."</p>

<p>Burnett held Katherine's hand and towed her through the doorway.
He used his shoulders to press men aside and he got Ared
Rinearson's touchy glance; he laughed at Ared as he went by. The
two fighters were shadowy in the suffused moonlight, ringed around
by a crowd; their feet stamped the earth, they grunted as they
struck, their blows were meaty in the night's softness; they were
intent and eager. Burnett drew Katherine on.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;Sophy," she said.</p>

<p>"Which one she like best?"</p>

<p>"One that won't let her alone."</p>

<p>"They're both after her."</p>

<p>"But one will put his will on her harder and make her
believe."</p>

<p>The meadow was pale, the creek glittered, the hills lay silent;
he walked the road's soft dust with her and got down on his knees
to find the jug.</p>

<p>"I'll take a taste," she said and sipped at the jug and
shivered. "That's enough, that's too much, how can it taste so bad
and feel so good?"</p>

<p>He restored the jug to its hiding place and turned with her
toward the Irish yard, and turned again to make a slow climb along
the trail which led to the summit of Lord's hill, the schoolhouse
noise softening as they rose along the slope and the fiddle music
making better melody. In the timber to their near left Lot White's
voice rose in half prayer and half a shout.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Lord, they have been hard pressed, they have worked
till this valley's sprinkled with the salt of their sweatin'. Let
them rejoice tonight, Lord, let them freshen on folly, for they
have got to pour out the staleness somehow. There will be fightin',
and there will be foolin' goin' on in this brush it's around me,
Lord, and I hear it and I could tell you names, but I
won't&mdash;and there will be things done and things said, and bad
bellies tomorrow. But we have got to do it. Angels won't do here,
Lord, not in this dust, not to break these fields and chop these
trees. Devil, devil, he's here tonight. Keep your eye on him and
let me keep my eye on him, but let these people sweeten themselves
tonight and drop the hoops that bind 'em, and let the rich old
curdled stuff drip, for tomorrow's work again, and there's a lot of
tomorrows before we go."</p>

<p>"Listen," she said.</p>

<p>"Good man."</p>

<p>Near the top of the hill they grew tired of climbing and settled
side by side to watch the schoolhouse lights five hundred feet
below. Lean cloud fluffs drifted past the moon and the strengthened
silver light became a motion in the hills, and shadows shifted as
slow waves of water against the fir groves, and a crystal haze
shimmered on the meadows. He dropped back full length, facing the
sky; and distance sucked his spirit outward and upward into that
emptiness&mdash;into that unbearable, beautiful, star-crusted pit
of nothingness. One day he would go out there, falling and turning
and spinning through a blind forever which had no top, no bottom,
no sides, no nothing. Forty years from now, maybe; it sounded like
a long time, but time wasn't anything. Forty years was only the
drawing of a breath&mdash;and suddenly he felt it, the day he went
spinning out into that void; his mind almost reached the actualness
of the moment and of the act itself; almost touched it and
recoiled, and he lay still and small and insecure and felt
loneliness. There was nothing out there; everything was here. He
lifted a hand and flattened it against Katherine's back&mdash;she
sitting close beside him, silent, watching the valley
below&mdash;and warmth came through her dress and comforted him.
She turned her head and looked down at him.</p>

<p>"You warm?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I like that dress, like the way you're in the dress. Katherine,
Katherine, Katherine. Swing your head a little&mdash;that's pretty
against the sky&mdash;you've got a fine chin, stubborn
sometimes&mdash;lower your head, not stubborn now. I see sparks of
light in your eyes. Always admired those hands, big strong ones,
pick a chicken, hang on to plow handles, pat a loaf of bread,
smooth on some man's back, too. Katherine. Very peculiar
thing&mdash;when I look at your eyes I look toward your hair, but
when I look at your mouth the next thing I'm looking at your
breasts. Good ones."</p>

<p>"They're for babies."</p>

<p>"Something else, before babies. Something else after babies,
too."</p>

<p>"I never caught you looking at my breasts."</p>

<p>"I'm sly. All men are sly about it. But you damned well know
I've looked."</p>

<p>"I always know when you're looking at me." She swung and dropped
to an elbow and at this closer range she watched his face. "Know
more than you think I know."</p>

<p>"How many babies?"</p>

<p>"Five, I think. Two have got to be girls. Girls stay close, boys
go away&mdash;and I've got to have a family around me. I want Gram
to stay alive to see all five." She drew a breath. "Time's
short."</p>

<p>Earth's warmth rose from the soil and eddied around them and a
soft air drifted with the slope of the hill. He turned and laid his
hand on her hip, on its round solidness, on its motionlessness;
then he thought of Edna and drew his hand away, remembering the
power below the motionlessness, in Katherine, in Edna, in all of
them; and he closed his fingers against the edges of her hair and
watched a dreaming expression settle upon her face and weight her
eyelids; and he thought about Harris, wondering how that was with
her, but he put Harris out of his head, for Harris was nothing to
him now; he was almost ready. Tenderness had no words; it lay
choked in him, it had drawn his hand from her hip. Though that was
what he wanted, it held him quiet against his strong desire to pull
her upon him and light the blaze.</p>

<p>She dropped nearer and whispered, "Rice," and blew breath on him
and watched him; and her smile broke and she rose and gave him a
hand and pulled him upright. "We'll go dance&mdash;it's been a long
time&mdash;we'll just dance till the fiddlestrings break. You want
to go get another drink? No, not now&mdash;wait awhile. Smell
summer? Listen, I hear crickets&mdash;it's too early for crickets,
isn't it? Oh, it's a beautiful land. Think of it, year after year."
She seized his arm, she surged against him in sudden delight, and
she laughed and swayed and drew him down the hill. He said, "Wait,"
but she was in haste and shook her head. "No&mdash;I want to
dance&mdash;not talk, now&mdash;the music's starting." The fiddle
sawed up and down and the flat slap of hands and the steady stamp
of feet made a current through the doorway. She led him into the
hall and turned to laugh at him, and her lips moved near to
whisper, "Devil, devil, nice devil."</p>

<p>Old Daniel's voice bawled above the fiddle's crying. "We ain't
barely started. Hell for shoe leather. Get your partners, we're
here till daylight cracks! All out&mdash;<i>Partners, salute."</i>
Crossing the floor, Rice saw Edna in the corner with Moss solemnly
beside her, and her eyes called to him and were sullen.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Whitcomb and Lucy went down the road until they came upon the
timber adjoining the Provost cabin; and they turned to the creek
and made seats for themselves on the stones. They had said little.
The strain was still between them and he found himself unable to
break it.</p>

<p>"You're tired?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Hard to be alone in the cabin?"</p>

<p>She hesitated over her answer. "I suppose I ought to say I'm
grieving. You know I'm not. The neighbors know I'm not." Afterwards
she revealed her puzzled mind. "I'll never know what made him get
in that boat and go out there. He wasn't that kind of man. If he
was, then I never knew him. I wonder if he did it to tell me
something&mdash;to tell us all something. He wouldn't kill himself
to do it, I know. But he might have nerved himself to the risk,
hoping he'd come out of it well thought of. To be well thought of
meant everything to him. I wish I knew."</p>

<p>"So you've got some regrets, wondering if you understood him, if
you treated him right."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have made any difference. It was too late. He could
have turned out to be a great man and still it was too late. When
that thing goes, Ralph, it just goes."</p>

<p>He said: "Is there anything else you feel sorry for?"</p>

<p>She gave him a glance and a brief answer. "No." She seemed
offended. She rose from her place. "What made you think of
that?"</p>

<p>"I only wondered what was in your head."</p>

<p>"No use mixing things around and around."</p>

<p>His habit of analyzing things was a sore point with him and her
remark hurt him. He stood up and went with her along the trail,
pride building his silence. Halfway to the Irish cabin she stopped
and turned to face him. "Ralph, would you rather give it up, not
see me any more? I know men feel some sort of obligation about
these things, when they've said things to a woman, when they've had
certain things from her. You don't need to feel that."</p>

<p>"Do you want to?"</p>

<p>"No, it's your decision."</p>

<p>Unexpectedly he was disgusted with himself for his involved
thinking, for his indecision. All she asked of him was to be
straight-out. Meet it and step into it and settle it. She made a
small motion of denial when he brought her forward. "Oh, to hell
with that, Lucy. My God&mdash;what has a man got to do? What change
do you think..." He stopped himself. It was words again. He kissed
her, he drove it in like a spike. She winced for the hurt he gave
her but drew away. "You're a rough beast when you forget about
yourself," she murmured. "I was sick&mdash;I was afraid&mdash;you
didn't seem quite yourself."</p>

<p>"You know I've not changed."</p>

<p>"I know, I know now."</p>

<p>"What about the neighbors? They know. You don't mind that?"</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, and dismissed it. It didn't matter. He had no
doubts in his head about her&mdash;that was what she had wanted to
know, to make this thing neat for all the time they would have
together. The rest, the opinion of the neighbors, was nothing.</p>

<p>He said, "Let's have a dance."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Then let's go back to your place. I've been lonely as
hell."</p>

<p>She said, "I'll make you coffee," and looked at him, and saw the
expression on his face. She tightened her hand on his arm. "Now,"
she murmured, half laughing at him, "you're very impatient."</p>

<p>"We'll get Lot White tomorrow. I can't stand any more of
it."</p>

<p>"All right," she whispered. "But Lot White first."</p>

<p>"I know," he said.</p>

<p>Old Daniel cried, <i>"Partners out and back!"</i> His big hands
slapped the time, all the watchers joining in until the beat was
stronger than Billy Lord's fiddle. Burnett sashayed out to meet
Katherine in the center of the set. Her body swung, her hands made
lively little motions before her, almost touching him, and drawing
away. Old Daniel called, <i>"Other partner&mdash;forward and
back!"</i> She drew away, laughing. Her lips were active, her face
flushed; she clapped her hands while the other pair moved in, but
her glance held him, flirted with him. She was a willow bending in
the wind. She was the tip of a fire, leaping bright against the
shadows.</p>

<p>Harris Eby's voice flung a lonely wolf howl through the room.
Mrs. Mercer's wakened baby screamed. The place grew warm, it
trembled to the stamping feet, to the beating feet. <i>"Out and
around&mdash;and around we go!"</i> He came forward to meet her. He
murmured, "What you afraid of?" He circled and saw the brisker
flash of her eyes as she withdrew. The opposite partners came
together and retreated. He moved in again. "What you afraid of?"
she said, and curtsied and laughed as she fell away.</p>

<p>Rinearson cried, <i>"All hands round!"</i></p>

<p>Turning in the circle, Burnett saw Roxy in the corner, body
strained forward, her dream-anxious face not quite real, not quite
solid through the curling pipe smoke. Sweat burned on his cheeks.
He saw Gram's face staring on with its concentration. Old Daniel
cried again, the fiddle quickened, the fiddle died and the shouting
rose. Rice drew his palms across both cheeks to squeeze them dry.
He fell beside Katherine, walking.</p>

<p>"Of nothing," he said.</p>

<p>She cast a sidewise glance at him. Now she was graver. In and
out. Close and far away. "Solemn&mdash;solemn," she said.</p>

<p>"I'm thirsty. Let's go back to the jug."</p>

<p>Her laughter rose, "Oh, no."</p>

<p>"That's careful. Lock your door. Don't walk through the woods
alone." Her glance sharpened. "Say that about yourself."</p>

<p>They passed Edna and Moss in a corner, Moss glum. Edna's eyes
searched him with somber reproach; she stood aloof. Old Daniel sat
on a bench beside Billy Lord, both men florid. "By God," said Old
Daniel.</p>

<p>"By God, she's a night." Sweat hung like crystal beads from both
Billy Lord's chins and dripped into the relaxed belly; he knew the
loosening his fiddle had caused around the crowd, for he looked
upon the young ones and the old ones with his surreptitious
contentment, with his scheming, and he laughed to himself.</p>

<p>"The whisky run out?"</p>

<p>"There's a little."</p>

<p>"Fiddler needs a drink. I am goin' to draw the festerin' of
their souls right up to a head, and I am agoin' to bust it."</p>

<p>Women's voices were busy knitting needles crossing each
other.</p>

<p>"My mother had got married at fifteen and didn't want me to do
it so early. So I had to run off to do it. She never liked my
children. They made her feel too old."</p>

<p>"I made Baldwin put in ten rows of onions. I ain't ever again
going to be without onions. They keep sickness off."</p>

<p>"If he gets drunk he'll be goaty in bed."</p>

<p>"Look at him watch her."</p>

<p>Hard-shouted laughter rose from a circle of men around the door;
the circle expanded, and drew small again and men's heads crept
close as somebody else told a story. Ray Lampert came up, spoke to
Katherine and took her away to a new set forming. Burnett swung,
but she didn't meet his attention; she stood opposite Lampert
laughing, waiting for the music.</p>

<p>Billy Lord reversed his fiddle on his knees and tapped it with
his knuckles; he shut his eyes and made a shuffling rhythm. Old
Daniel began to beat his hands together: <i>"Tom-Tom&mdash;Eyahhh
Injun&mdash;Injun file."</i></p>

<p>Burnett humped his back, drew his shoulders together and made a
small circle, pumping his hands up and down before him, hopping
from one foot to the other as he turned.</p>

<p><i>"Eyahhh!"</i> shouted Old Daniel and slammed his boots on the
floor to keep time with his hands.</p>

<p>Harris Eby moved in, grinning, while he watched Burnett go round
and round with his Indian shuffling. He clapped his hands across
his mouth and howled; he bent and fell behind Burnett, pumping his
hands, stooping lower. Provost followed Eby, and Old Daniel jumped
from the bench to take his place in line.</p>

<p>Burnett moved down the room with his hop and shuffle. He
remembered the Mandan lodge, the smoke, the reek of bodies, the
dark faces staring out from the walls, the file of Indians in the
center stamping their circle around the fire. The line grew behind
him, snake-crooked. He buckled his knees as he stamped, he flung
his hands overhead. <i>"Yah&mdash;yah&mdash;yah!"</i> The line
howled with him. Out from the walls moved the pounding of feet. He
bent the circle of men around Katherine; he looked at her and
slapped his chest. He shuffled on.</p>

<p><i>"Eyahhh!"</i>
</p>

<p>The log house shook to all those boots driving down. Mrs.
Mercer's baby steadily cried. Billy Lord, eyes closed, had his head
against the fiddle as he tapped it and his voice rang against the
walls:</p>

<p class="poem">Men are born and die too soon,<br>
Lily's in the corn, highaway noon.<br>
Plums don't grow for angel's fare,<br>
Hoe your corn while Lily's there.</p>

<p><i>"Eyahhh. Eyahhh&mdash;uh&mdash;uh&mdash;eyahhh."</i>
</p>

<p>Faces looked in from the yard, high and low in the doorway. Gram
Gay, seated on a bench, tapped her shoes and clapped her hands.
Edna looked on with her unhappy manner. He drew the circle into a
tight knot in the middle of the room; he started his arms low and
lifted them slow and shivering upward and drew a prolonged howl
from the crowd and he turned sweating to the doorway, Eby
following, Eby's big hand weighting down his shoulder, Eby's
exhausted laughter hard on his eardrums. "God almighty&mdash;I'm
dry&mdash;I'm faintin' dry." They moved into the night's fragrant
coolness and past the Irish cabin toward the cached jug. The
schoolmaster's high-raked body was outlined in the cabin's doorway.
They heard Mrs. Irish crying.</p>

<p>"We can't have strangers doin' that," said Eby. "Maybe he's a
man I can fight."</p>

<p>"Not your woman crying," said Burnett. "Let her alone." He
searched out the jug and waited for Eby. Eby drank and surrendered
the jug, whispering:</p>

<p>"I've not got a woman to cry. God damn you."</p>

<p>Burnett tipped the jug, took his whisky and blew a foggy sound
from the jug's neck. "I've not got your woman, and God damn
you."</p>

<p>"Well, if you've not got her, who's got her&mdash;God damn
you?"</p>

<p>Burnett returned the jug to Eby. "I don't know," he said, and
took the jug back. "I don't know."</p>

<p>"It was just as certain as honey in the hive," said Eby,
whispering again. "Just as certain, till you showed up. Now who's
got her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Stop whispering. I can hear all right."</p>

<p>"Well, let's go find out. Let's ask her."</p>

<p>"It won't do."</p>

<p>"Why won't it do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but it won't do."</p>

<p>"I wish I could get damned good and mean when I drink. All I get
is friendly. By God, I wish I could get sore enough to pull down a
house, shake hell out of a few trees and get in a good fight.
That's what they want. I'm an ox&mdash;dumb brute with no harm in
me. They don't want that."</p>

<p>"Who's they?"</p>

<p>"Women. They want steady men, but, hell, they don't like 'em.
God damn you."</p>

<p>A rider drifted down from Lord's notch toward the schoolhouse,
unknown in the darkness; he stopped in the yard, dismounted and
crossed quickly to the house and went in. Suddenly a silence came
to the place.</p>

<p>"What's that?" said Burnett.</p>

<p>"Johnny-come-lately. Not a steady man. Women like men like that.
Out all night&mdash;sleep all day&mdash;"</p>

<p>Burnett carefully laid the jug in the grass and moved forward.
"Let's see," he said, and began to run; for a woman's scream broke
and ran on like fine hammers drumming on a tight-strung wire. Eby
heaved himself into motion, following Burnett.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Lockyear had crossed the yard in long strides, rifle thrown before
him; he knocked aside a pair of men blocking the door, stepped into
the room and faced the crowd. For a moment he was unnoticed; it was
Old Daniel ready to call a new set, who discovered him and pointed
a hand at him and challenged him. "What the hell you want?" Then
the last voices pinched out and the settlers watched him as they
would have watched a loose bear. He had his rifle thrown forward
and as he swung, seeking out somebody, the muzzle of the gun made
its arc. He braced his feet and bent his shoulders, long face
turning and strange eyes hunting; he discovered Edna and there his
glance stopped.</p>

<p>John Millard, on a bench across the room, reached for his
crutches and lunged to his feet, knocking aside his wife's
interposed arm. He said, "You're the man I want to see."</p>

<p>"Stay back there," said Lockyear.</p>

<p>"You're the man I want to see," repeated Millard, and moved on.
"Had I a gun I'd kill you on the spot."</p>

<p>"Stay back," said Lockyear, and flung up his rifle on Moss
Rinearson.</p>

<p>Millard planted his crutches far forward and swung ahead on
them, driving himself into Lockyear. Lockyear swerved, brought the
barrel of his rifle sidewise against Millard's head and knocked the
man down. Roxy, small and shivering against the wall, let go with
her scream of terror as the rifle swung again to Moss Rinearson,
made its gentle, centering motion against Moss's chest and jumped
back from its bullet.</p>

<p>Waves of sound choked the room, to oppress and shake the
surrounding people. Moss wheeled and made a short, painful hop; his
face rose to show its moment of fright, he took one step and began
to die as he fell, his hand seizing Edna's dress and ripping it
straight down; she tried to hold him, was caught by the weight of
his body, and went to the floor with him.</p>

<p>Old Daniel shouted, "Moss," and rushed toward his son. Lockyear
made a full circle on his heels, shortening his grip on the rifle
to make a club of it. He rushed upon the men blocking the doorway
and drove them aside with the gun's threat&mdash;grazing Provost's
face with its butt, striking down Lattimore's arm&mdash;and ran
into the yard; he reached his horse before the shock of the scene
wore off; he was in the saddle, cursing his horse into motion
before the first man&mdash;it was Provost&mdash;came full-throated
after him; he had straightened away from the place when he saw Eby
and Burnett close upon him. He turned his horse aside to avoid
Eby's body, changed his mind and reined the horse into Eby, driving
him to the ground, rolling him, riding over him. The horse faltered
and reared and shook Lockyear on the saddle, and in such awkward
position he swept his club-clutched rifle toward Burnett, missed
his aim and spurred the horse over the yard.</p>

<p>Roxy's scream went on and on. Old Daniel cried,
"Moss&mdash;Moss, boy&mdash;Moss&mdash;my son!" The doorway was
clogged with men bucking silent, single-minded, through it. Mercer
came out of the jam with his rifle held over his head as though he
were fording a stream and Burnett, catching sight of the weapon,
jumped forward to seize it. At this instant Lockyear had passed the
Irish cabin and was at a full run down the trail toward
Lattimore's, his body a diminishing shadow, the horse a diminishing
shadow. On the broader bulk of the horse Burnett took aim, held it
until he was certain of his shot, and fired.</p>

<p>He flung aside the gun and raced on. Lockyear's horse traveled
fifty feet before it slowed, dropped its head and tripped itself,
and for a short time Burnett lost sight of Lockyear against the
darkness of the earth, man and horse mixed in their violent
turnings. Eby, pounding forward, shouted: "Get him!" Then Burnett
saw Lockyear rise and go along the road a short distance with the
evident notion of reaching the timber between this meadow and
Lattimore's place; he had not traveled ten paces when a gun barked
in the yard&mdash;some other settler swinging into action behind
Burnett&mdash;and the shot, though wasted, changed Lockyear's mind
and drove him over the meadow to the creek. He reached the willows
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Burnett passed the Irish cabin, reached his horse and got gun
and powder horn from the saddle. Eby overtook him. "Wait for me!"
Settlers' boots knocked on the hard school yard, scuffing, running;
their voices rose in excited halloos. "Wait for me," said Eby. "I
got to get a gun!" Burnett vaulted the meadow fence, now catching
sight of Lockyear in the pale moonlight, half across the creek.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch54" id="ch54"></a>Chapter 54</h2>

<p>LOCKYEAR was in the trees beyond the creek when Burnett took to
the water and sank armpit-deep in his fording; on the far bank he
paused a moment to catch the reckless beat of the man ahead and,
using that racket as his compass point, he set out to follow.
Lockyear's gun, having been fired, was useless and so long as he
remained in motion he could not reload; therefore Burnett moved
steadily through the trees, bearing from one side to the other as
he heard the other change direction and plunge on with no attempt
to conceal himself. It was this carelessness which puzzled Burnett,
for he knew Lockyear's ability to slip through any kind of thicket
with no sound whatever if he wished to do so. The fall must have
injured him.</p>

<p>Beyond the creek's marginal brush and alders a narrow meadow lay
at the foot of a ridge separating this part of the settlement from
Rinearson's valley. Here Burnett stopped. The sound died and he
thought that Lockyear had turned possum in the shelter beyond; but
in a moment he saw motion and identified Lockyear's shadow sliding
along the foot of the ridge, close upon the trees but using the
meadow's softer ground to dampen his retreat. Burnett changed his
course and moved rapidly down his side of the meadow, less than a
hundred yards to the rear of Lockyear and paralleling the man's
course. He quickened his stride to close the distance; he crouched
to keep himself small.</p>

<p>The shadowy shape limped and went on with a kind of swinging
bearlike clumsiness, apparently intending to cross the trail which
ran between Irish's ford and Rinearson's, and put himself on the
prairie side of the settlement rather than to go into the west
hills as he was expected to do. He was canny enough to know the
settlers would try to throw a ring around him; perhaps he had made
up his mind to hole up in the open rolling hills south of this
country, where escape was easier managed.</p>

<p>His mind was soon changed, for voices and the sound of rapid
running horses came up the trail from the direction of the ford as
an announcement of the settlers' pursuit. Lockyear's reaction was
to turn immediately into the trees and smash his
way&mdash;abandoning his temporary caution upward, along the ridge.
Burnett broke into a trot, crossed the open ground and gained some
distance on the man by the time the latter entered the timber; once
he heard Lockyear let go with a strong swearing at an injury the
brush had caused him.</p>

<p>The ridge was part of a larger chunk of rough land to the east
and it lay like the thumb of a hand, coming down from the greater
mass and terminating suddenly where the trail cut through to
Rinearson's. It was perhaps two hundred feet high and when Burnett
reached its crest he saw Rinearson's valley lying pale in the
moonlight below and the wink of cabin lights at Old Daniel's; and
from that direction he made out the distance-thinned calling of
voices. This elevation gave him his first notion of what the
settlers were meanwhile doing, for he also caught the small, broken
bits of voices along the upper creek where a group apparently had
swung into the hills at Millard's place to lay a barrier before
Lockyear if he tried to fall back to the higher mountains.</p>

<p>Lockyear had started to descend the ridge, evidently heading for
Rinearson's valley; but he had not gone far when he switched his
direction and beat his way along the slope of the ridge toward its
junction with the parent hill on the east. By this maneuver he lost
ground, Burnett now being above him and able to swing his direction
in such a manner that he would come ahead of the man. Listening a
moment, Burnett started forward at a long slant, slipping through
the timber, crawling quietly over logs, meeting the brush with his
forward hands, traveling sidewise, letting the brush softly swing
behind. So engrossed was he in his own progress that he ignored
Lockyear for a short time and pulled himself sharp-still when he
realized the man had quit moving.</p>

<p>He settled and he turned his head slowly, not to see&mdash;for
the blackness of this lower timber was a solid blackness&mdash;but
to catch any sound on the flat of his eardrum. He believed Lockyear
to be no more than fifty feet away by this time, and at such a
distance he ought to make out the man's strong breathing, but he
got no suggestion of it above the labor of his own wind and the
repeated vibration of a man's voice shouting somewhere beyond
Rinearson's.</p>

<p>Then he thought he detected the light and short rustle of brush
from a new angle of the timber, and he rose and moved downgrade in
easy stages, waking no echoes, and reached the edge of the
Rinearson meadows. There was nothing to be seen along the mooncast
meadows, but when he looked to the south, toward the rolling hills,
he again discovered a shadow wavering close beside the timber.
Lockyear was repeating his former trick&mdash;to reach open ground
and travel beside the thicket; by this shift he had gained ground
and possibly thought he had thrown off pursuit.</p>

<p>Burnett followed, using the same shadows to conceal himself. He
stretched his pace and as he walked he debated taking the first
decent chance at a fair shot; he lengthened his stride again and
watched the shadow thicken. A light unexpectedly lifted from the
meadow's other side, from Moss Rinearson's cabin five hundred yards
away, and with the light came the small voices of men who seemed to
be in motion. He watched the light a short time, or until he heard
Lockyear's feet break into a run.</p>

<p>Burnett followed suit, coming down on the balls of his feet,
rising and falling to the ground's hummocks. The shadow bobbed high
and low before him but gradually began to lose the little
distinctness it had as the heavier hill eastward threw forward its
denser color. Presently Lockyear reached the foot of the hill and
left his loud wake behind him as he pressed into the
undergrowth&mdash;and began to climb. As soon as he in turn reached
the brush, Burnett fell back to his quieter pursuit. It became
evident to him now that Lockyear's fall from the horse had hurt him
in more than passing fashion, for his audible course grew crooked
and he fought the brush with his arms for a quarter mile or more up
the hill, and at that point he seemed to understand&mdash;if he had
not already known it&mdash;that he was being followed and being
overtaken; and abruptly his threshing ceased.</p>

<p>Halted, Burnett heard only the diminishing heave of the man's
breath; when that stopped there was an occasional flurry of motion
from Lockyear as he shifted his position; then that too quit.
Burnett rose and moved by in small steps to a place twenty feet
from his original stopping place and by equally cautious motion he
eased forward until he was close enough to Lockyear to hear
whatever motion the latter might make. He had no knowledge of
Lockyear's exact location&mdash;and Lockyear, cornered, would be
dangerous; and so he settled again and waited for daylight to come
on. In the distance, at the extreme edge of hearing, a long call
went over Rinearson's valley; and back in the hills to the east a
gun sent its rolling report outward.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Daylight was at first a trembling of the blackness, a silent
cracking of the frozen night. Overhead the sky lost its dark color
and grew gray, and trees began to stand as charcoal streaks against
the lesser black. Cramped and cold and tired, he rose against a
fir's trunk to orient himself, to sweep the trembling, shifting
twilight around him. He moved to another tree, knowing the man
nearby was awake and somewhere prowling as he prowled, angered by
pursuit and sure enough of himself to stand and play this game out.
He stepped on, exploring the ragged half definite shape of fallen
limbs, of huckleberry bushes and breast-high dead-falls against
which the shadows lay with their stony solidness. He dropped to his
knees and crawled against such a deadfall and followed the
dead-fall's length far enough to find himself at the break of a
small ravine in whose thirty-foot depth the darkness was beginning
to flow as water flows. His stretching hand came down on the
slick-cold surface of a snail and his reaction carried him so
swiftly backward that his feet struck the deadfall with the small
sound of a finger tapping on a broken drumhead.</p>

<p>Somewhere he heard the rustle of brush. It seemed to come from
below him and, running his eyes along the ravine's
bottom&mdash;prying through those sedimentary shadows&mdash;he
caught a wavering reflection of light on the surface of water, on
the puddled beginnings of a creek which seeped from the higher
hills. A stump stood close by in the water, broad-topped and gray.
He watched it a moment and moved his glance onward. Then he
thought: "Stump hell&mdash;can't be a stump here," and brought his
eyes back to it. He saw a pale glow at one end of the stump, like
the sallow scar of an ax stroke; then the light seemed to shift,
for the glow disappeared. He looked at the pool and saw that its
surface was still shining; the light hadn't shifted, but the stump
had. Rearing to his haunches he settled the rifle against his
cheek, laid the sights on the stump, and searched for the target.
The glow appeared again, the scar moved gently into view. It was
Lockyear's head swinging on his crouched body. Burnett took up the
trigger's slack.</p>

<p>The report was a great explosion in the morning silence.
Lockyear's cry followed, ringing desperately through the timber; he
rose from the pool, wavered and rushed into the deeper tangle of
the ravine, disappearing from sight, threshing along the
hillside&mdash;not away from Burnett, but toward him in a
roundabout charge. <i>Cripple shot,</i> Burnett thought, and reared
back to load and prime his rifle before Lockyear reached him.
Lockyear's grunt came up the ravine; his body smashed at the fern
and devil-stock and huckleberry; he got to the rim and plunged into
the trees and somewhere stopped. Burnett poured in powder, rammed
home shot and wad; he primed, snapped down the pan cover, seated
his rod and rose and ran in weaving haste from tree to tree. On the
heights of the hill above him he heard another gun sound in signal;
up from the valley rose a hard long call. He sidestepped from one
tree to another and took temporary shelter beside a deadfall,
waiting for sound; now he heard Lockyear breathing&mdash;to the
right and not far away&mdash;and he straightened and advanced
against another tree and surveyed the matted vines ahead of him,
the stiff tree columns, the crooked arms of a capsized fir root
ragged in the creeping light. He watched the fir root, pointing the
gun on it, and he caught Lockyear's sudden expulsion of breath. To
the left&mdash;to the left and close by. He backed away from the
tree and stepped around it, gun's muzzle forward, hip high.
Lockyear was on the ground, seated and facing him and waiting; he
was hatless, his shirt was ripped down the front and in this bad
light his eyes were a pair of holes burned against pale skin.
Burnett swung his rifle at the hip and fired. The bullet hit
Lockyear, turned him and knocked him over. Curled on the ground, he
made a violent reach for his fallen gun such strength as he had
going into that effort. Burnett ran in to kick the rifle aside.
"Cal," he said, and got no answer; bending, he watched the man
die.</p>

<p>From the heights of the ridge broke another gunshot, signaling
and asking for a signal; from Rinearson's valley lifted the nearer
cry of a party apparently put in motion by the two explosions from
Burnett's rifle. He took up Lockyear's piece and fired through the
treetops, and loaded both guns and set them against a tree; and he
moved down the ravine for a drink and returned to squat beside
Lockyear.</p>

<p>He could think of no good this man had done; act by act Lockyear
had been consistently bad, as though by birth he had been put into
the world to disturb it. With that mind set right and those great
energies harnessed, he would have been a powerful man. How was it
that these gifts could be thus carelessly flung into a bad
instrument? Where was the pattern in such a thing? John Gay called
up the best in men, the influence of his life forwarding a purpose
which men liked to believe governed them; but a Lockyear canceled a
Gay. Where was the pattern there? He reached for a gun and fired
another signal and sat back, hearing the shout of men in the
timbered heights and the clearer call of those in the valley below.
Lockyear lay on a shoulder, his head settled crooked against the
ground, his open eyes filmed and dusty. His face had the usual
claylike cast to it, the mouth was unsettled, the sullen look was
there. With the power gone he was a shabby thing and the threat
which bullied the settlement was now unreal. Either death was
careless or death was subtle.</p>

<p>He rose and fixed his position for the nearing searchers by a
long shout, and heard them rattling through the brush on both sides
of him. He made out Eby's voice, and Provost's. He shouted
again.</p>

<p>Eby shouted through the trees and sighted him and came forward,
leading a party from the valley; the second group shortly
afterwards threshed its way up the ravine. They stood circled
around Lockyear, watching him with their common silence and their
separate reactions. Provost touched the dead man with the toe of a
boot. "Now we got a job packin' him out of here."</p>

<p>"Leave him here," said Durbin Young.</p>

<p>"Nothin' to dig a grave with."</p>

<p>Durbin Young said, "Well, let the wolves&mdash;" but he checked
himself and shrugged his shoulders. "No, I suppose not. Well, we
can lug him to the meadow and load him on a horse."</p>

<p>"Where'll we take him?"</p>

<p>"This settlement needs a graveyard."</p>

<p>"Let's get at this."</p>

<p>Eby stepped around Lockyear and caught him at the armpits; he
nodded to the others. "Catch a leg apiece." Provost took one leg,
Lige Ebbett took the other. They moved downgrade in a roundabout
way to avoid deadfalls and root pits and brush clumps, Lockyear's
buttocks now and then dragging the earth as the supporting men
hunted for their own footing. It was an hour's work carrying him
from the timber to the waiting horses in the meadow. Eby got
Lockyear into his arms and threw him belly-down over a saddle and,
with a man walking at either side of the horse to hold the body on,
the party moved toward Rinearson's. Eby fell back with Burnett.</p>

<p>"Don't believe I'd 'a' cared to monkey around with him in the
dark, Rice. It was his meat&mdash;he was a damned savage. Think
you'll have trouble with Veen?"</p>

<p>"I'll go talk to him."</p>

<p>"You sorry about this?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The party passed the upper Rinearson cabins, filed through a
grove and moved on toward Old Daniel's place, drawing the attention
of a few people standing about the yard. Lot White and Old Daniel
came from the house and women began to appear as the file of horses
and men drew near. Old Daniel stepped forward to stare at the
horseshoe shape of Lockyear across Eby's saddle; he turned and put
his arms around Mrs. Rinearson, pointing to the body. Mrs.
Rinearson shook her head and went into the house, Daniel following
her. Presently he came out with Edna. He said: "There's the
son-of-a-bitch. There he is." He was crying as he moved on to the
horse. He circled the horse and squatted and cocked his head upward
to stare into Lockyear's hanging face. "I lost two sons to this
son-of-a-bitch. Who shot him?"</p>

<p>Eby inclined his head at Burnett. Old Daniel came over, caught
Burnett's fist and shook it, long lines creased his face, his mouth
trembled. "God bless you." He walked around the yard with an
aimless agitation and began to wave his arms. "Get him out of
here&mdash;I don't want him within a mile of the place. Get him
out."</p>

<p>"Daniel," said Lot White, "he's dead."</p>

<p>"Don't want him around. Whit's out there in the grove. Moss'll
be there tomorrow. Get him out of here&mdash;don't want him
around."</p>

<p>Provost said, "Well, where we goin' to put him?"</p>

<p>They stood about, thinking, undecided. Edna laid her back to the
log wall and watched Lockyear; she lifted her head and drew down
her lids until the close, nearsighted expression was on her face
again; and a shadow moved over the heavy-turned features and she
lowered her glance and stared at the ground.</p>

<p>"We got to put him somewhere," said Provost.</p>

<p>"We had better start a graveyard," said Lot. "It will be
needed."</p>

<p>"Well, where? You'll be doin' most of the prayin' over the
graves. Where?"</p>

<p>"Not here&mdash;not anywhere near here," said Old Daniel, and
went on crying. Ared stepped in and put a hand over his father's
shoulder.</p>

<p>Edna raised her eyes and fixed her glance on Burnett and he saw
that she was sad in the close-held way of a woman who had always
kept her own counsel, who had always been somewhat scornful of the
crying of other people. He had thought this air of steadiness to be
the sign of her strength, now it seemed to him it was a lack of
deep feeling. Maybe this was all the sadness she would ever be able
to show for any misery; maybe no misery could register deeper. Back
in her eyes he thought he saw the old call, its suggestion and its
promise, which had once so excited him. From that glance and out of
that body he had built a wonderful image of mystery. Those big hips
remembered him and waited to churn with him again. If he were dead,
they would churn as readily for another; one man or another, that
was their necessity. There was no mystery. Looking upon her, he
remembered her closeness, and the heat of it stirred him and was
good, but there was no mystery.</p>

<p>She had been watching him; in her seriousness there was the
suggestion of a knowledge of what he was and what he thought, and
presently she made a gesture with her shoulders and her face closed
out whatever it had held for him and, casting a short glance at
Lockyear, she turned into the house.</p>

<p>"Take him to the ford," said Lot White. "We will start the
graveyard on the hill below Lord's. It is a good place." Burnett
followed the caravan down the trail.</p>

<p>The three men&mdash;Ared, his father and Lot White&mdash;watched
the file of horses and men move away. "Two of my sons," said Old
Daniel and bent his head as the tears fell again. "Two of my sons,
on account of him. I hope he burns in hell ten thousand years."</p>

<p>"Daniel," said Lot, "that's the Lord's judgment, it ain't yours,
and I want you to cleanse your heart. Come with me. We will go into
the hills and pray."</p>

<p>"Judgment, hell. What've I got to pray for? What'd I do wrong,
what'd Moss do wrong? Maybe Whit did wrong, but what'd Moss do
wrong? Give me no prayers."</p>

<p>"You going to rot your soul by carryin' that around the rest of
your life? It won't do."</p>

<p>"I will do what I have got to do," said Old Daniel. "I will save
mercy for them that deserve it, I'll spend none on them that don't.
If I have got to be judged for hating a man that deserves to be
hated, why then let me be judged, for I won't change. I won't be
meek and mild. Wasn't made that way and can't be that way. I'm dirt
while I'm here and by God, dirt's good enough for me." He stared at
his son, grief giving his practical face a wizened cast. "All I've
got is this boy. What good's my valley to me now, empty cabins
standin' where Whit ought to be, where Moss ought to be?"</p>

<p>"Pride of man," murmured Lot and shook his head. "You atryin' to
hang on to a piece of earth, you atryin' to populate it and fix it
like it was yours. You atryin' to be a king in Israel. You atryin'
to be a Pharaoh and build a tomb that will last forever. This ain't
your home, Daniel. Your home's up there."</p>

<p>"Don't tell it to me," said Daniel. "I'll wrestle with this
earth and fix it the way I want it, if I can. Heaven, I don't know
about. This, I do. Let it be pride, what else has a man got to hold
him together in one piece? No sir, sleep's comin', but I'm awake
now and I will wrestle." He gave his head a violent shake to knock
away the tears and he watched Edna come from the house and go
slowly along the trail. His head rose and he looked upon her body
with his admiration. "Ared," he said, "I want that baby she's got.
I want it in this family. I want no other man to get it. You got to
have a wife. You'll never get a better one. Now you go talk to
her."</p>

<p>Ared said, "I'd not mind, but she's got Moss in her head this
minute."</p>

<p>Daniel studied his son, wisdom of a sort trapped in the seams of
his face. He shook his head. "You never chased enough women to know
'em, Ared. She can't sleep with a dead man, but she has got to
sleep with a man. In a year's time she won't remember the look on
Moss's face, no more than a plowed field remembers who did the
plowin' last season. Now you go talk to her."</p>

<p>Ared turned after her. She had stopped down the trail, her
glance fixed on the column of men and horses now about to pass
around the foot of the ridge toward Irish's ford and when he came
up she ignored him for a moment, her expression dulled and heavy.
Occupied by his own thoughts, he didn't notice her manner. He was a
copy of his father without his father's deviltry, and he had no
subtlety of any sort.</p>

<p>"I'd like you to consider marrying me," he said.</p>

<p>She brought her glance around, paying him no compliment of
surprise or smile or interest. The heaviness hung on while she
considered him; she looked down the trail again until the last
horse vanished from view and as it did so she shrugged her
shoulders and turned to Ared. Now the smile came. She gave out a
short laugh and put a hand on his arm. "All right, Ared," she said.
"It might as well be."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Burnett left the column when it started up the hill beyond the ford
to locate a graveyard; he stopped at his cabin a moment and rode on
to Lockyear's place, finding Veen settled against the cabin wall,
half asleep in the warm sunlight.</p>

<p>"Where's your brother?"</p>

<p>Veen shook his head. "In hell for all I know or give a
damn."</p>

<p>It revealed to Burnett what he wanted to know about the crippled
man's attitude toward his brother. "He might be there," he said,
and told the story.</p>

<p>Veen turned once on the ground while Burnett talked; for a
little while he stared steadily at Burnett but toward the end he
dropped his glance to the ground and when Burnett had finished he
made a short gesture.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "there was a time when I'd wanted to kill you
for that. There was a time when Cal was a good man. He never had
much regard for anybody's rights, but he let people alone. I don't
know when the hate started to get the best of him. Once it started,
it moved fast and he was bound to kill somebody." He reached into
the dust and filled his palm and let it spill. "That Edna woman was
what he wanted most. He saw her a few times. I know that, because
he'd come back tame for a couple hours. But he was no man to take
half of anything. When he wanted something it was a terrible
thing&mdash;he'd get it or he'd kill it. But if he'd got her, he'd
busted her up. Nothin' pleased him long."</p>

<p>"Go down to Irish's. He's there."</p>

<p>"Don't want to see him. It would just stir up the hate in me."
He rose slowly. "Now I got to bear the reputation of being his
brother. God damn him, even dead he can hurt people. You think I
could go see Roxy? You think the Kitchens would care?"</p>

<p>"Go see," said Burnett and rode back to the cabin.</p>

<p>He made a meal, did the chores; he stretched out to sleep and
woke at sundown with a restlessness working powerfully through him.
He felt fine, he felt cheerful; he did evening chores and cooked
supper and sat in the doorway with his pipe to watch twilight sift
through timber and settle across the meadows.</p>

<p>The air was rich and warm, and though no wind stirred there was
nevertheless the sense of motion all around him&mdash;in the rising
heat, in the smell of growth, in the shifting colors; and so still
was this night that he had the illusion he felt the giant whirling
of the earth itself. He could not long remain motionless, and rose
to stroll about the meadow, to walk along the fence, testing the
rails with his hand, to stand in the millhouse and speculate on the
storage space, to return and face the hills with one thought and
another running through his head, no thought complete. He walked to
the creek, listening to its melody while watching the yonder ridge
blacken against the sky; over there, twelve hours before, he had
killed Lockyear&mdash;and the recollection moved through him as a
physically disagreeable sensation. It lasted a moment and was gone.
Deliberately he tried to bring it back; deliberately he sought for
some blackness in his head as a result of it, but could produce
nothing; and then he knew that for him there could be no remorse.
An act produced its consequences, but act and consequences were
swept on and thinned out by the tide of time, covered over by other
acts, and at last forgotten in the accumulating episodes of
life.</p>

<p>He circled the meadow again and returned to his cabin; he
lighted a lantern, he looked about the room and felt its emptiness
to a degree he had not before, and he walked to the yard with
well-being stiff and strong in him and discontent plucking at him;
he lighted his pipe again, started another circle around the meadow
and checked himself. Turning to the shed, he saddled the horse and
rode toward Gay's.</p>

<p>Two lights came over the clearing, one from each Gay cabin; when
he reached the yard he heard Katherine's voice speak. "Over here,
Rice." He found her at the outdoor table, seated idly before it,
arms spread on it. He came around the table, seeing the ivory disc
of her face rise in the shadows.</p>

<p>"How's your father?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I'll go say hello."</p>

<p>"He won't know you."</p>

<p>"Where's everybody?"</p>

<p>"Mother's with him. The others are in bed."</p>

<p>"Beautiful night," he said. He stood behind her, he let his
hands fall to her shoulders. "Beautiful night." He moved on to the
table's end, vitality making motion necessary; he slapped the table
with the butt of his hand. "I smell something good."</p>

<p>"It's a white flower blooming through the brush."</p>

<p>"Like honey, like a woman's hair. I want to see your dad."</p>

<p>"It's no good. Just remember him."</p>

<p>But he shook his head and stepped around the table; she watched
him a little while and afterwards rose. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. They crossed the yard toward the house.
"Some people&mdash;when they're gone you think about them and a bad
feeling comes when you remember they're not here any more. I want
to see him."</p>

<p>She stopped and let him go into the cabin by himself. Martha Gay
was in a rocker at the bed's side and she checked its steady
swaying and watched him for a moment with her thoughts a long way
off. It took her a little while to bring herself back. She rose
over the bed, lifting and replacing the blankets around Gay's
shoulders. "He won't hear you, Rice. He won't know you." She bent
to listen to his breath.</p>

<p>His face even now had the disintegrated expression of death,
flesh careless over hard bones, cavern shadows in the sockets,
temples fallen, placid mystery registered around the hardening
mouth. The fire had retreated to its central place and burned lower
and lower as the cold crept in; his vitality was like the emanation
rising from the blackened bed of a fire in which one buried coal
still held heat. There was no recognition in his eyes. Pain was
about through with him, and he lay with that thoughtful patience
upon his features which was neither thought nor patience; with that
far gazing which saw everything&mdash;or nothing. Burnett dropped a
hand to the blanket-covered shape, drew it away and stepped from
the cabin. Night's air struck him sweet and strong in the face and
sank deep into his chest. Katherine took his arm and walked on with
him, over the yard, past the shed and toward the trail; her
shoulder touched him, fell away, touched again as they went on.</p>

<p>"About all I ever learned that's been worth learning," he said,
"has come from people that never tried to teach me, and never knew
they did. The things in a good man come out of him&mdash;they go
through other people. Even the meanest man born feels it. There's
no power like it. Your father was that kind of a man."</p>

<p>He swung with her and crossed the meadow and stopped at the
wheat-field's edge. She turned, face shining in the moonlight,
alert, listening. He thought she had been silently crying and he
bent in to identify the glitter of tears, but she moved back and
gave her head a sharp, short shake, and the glitter ceased. He
swept his hand across the wheat tops, trapping kernels and crushing
them between his fingers. "Be ready to cut in three weeks or a
month. Been a fine thing if your father could have seen the first
harvest."</p>

<p>She had no answer. She was restless, her hands moved and her
shoulders stirred; she watched him and the silence was roughened by
the turbulence of a discontent making up within her. She stepped
ahead and settled beside the creek and seized a stone, flinging it
outward. Moonlight caught and froze the upstrike of spray into an
instant's streak of silver; the riffles flashed, the tree-crazed
pattern of shadows wavered on the water. Strange things rotted in
the mud at their feet, and fern and grass and brush sucked in this
stuff, and breathed out the damp fragrance of growth. The creek's
motion was a sensation which lifted and lowered him; he felt the
earth's turning in the pit of his stomach&mdash;the giant rolling
of it, the great vibrations of it. The wheatfield's shining was a
cold shining, the darkness of the fir grove beyond the meadow was a
heavy darkness; the mountains were beyond sight but their weight
pressed in.</p>

<p>He dropped beside her. She withdrew from his touch, hands
clasped over her knees, bent forward, stone-still. She was hard,
she was distant. He touched her and pulled her around, but there
was reluctance to her motion and the strengthening turbulence
seemed to stiffen her body until it seemed to him the strain was
ready to break her. Her face moved forward, her mouth was a streak
of shadow, her eyes a streak of shadow. He bent in and kissed her.
Nothing came back to him. She remained still, critically tasting a
flavor; she was wary, locked-up. He put his hand at the base of her
head and he swung forward and pressed her to the ground. She turned
as though to slide away from him. "No," he said, and checked her
turning.</p>

<p>"There's a rock under me," she whispered, and lifted herself
while he brushed it away.</p>

<p>She adjusted herself, she rested her hands on her arms. Propped
above her, he saw the motionless mouth below and the still surface
of her face; and the tension between them was like the coming of a
hard wind whose sound was faint in the distance. He lowered
himself.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>She said nothing. Her hands had no weight on him. She was
waiting, she was listening&mdash;listening to him or to
herself.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He brought her head around. Her mouth moved forward and her
hands closed upon his sleeves and he felt the hard wall break, the
beginning outflow, the gathering insistence. Across the meadow
unexpectedly came Mrs. Gay's voice with its splinter-keen note of
tragedy. "Katherine&mdash;Katherine!" Her body trembled, she crept
nearer, fitting herself to him, knees and hips, and her arms closed
about him with increased strength. Mrs. Gay's voice came crying
again. "Katherine&mdash;your father...!" Her trembling ceased and
he felt wetness break along his cheek. Her hands prompted him and
he turned her head against the soft earth and caught a whisper from
her as he came upon her, and the illusion of the spinning earth was
so strong that he flattened himself to keep her and himself from
being whirled outward into the black.</p>
